[12:12] amen amen we have several needs this
[12:16] evening we want to remember in prayer
[12:18] but
[12:19] before we do that i just wanted to
[12:21] mention as we continue to pray for
[12:23] sister karen
[12:24] amen the lord touching her but we just
[12:28] really need a miracle
[12:29] amen amen but we believe miracles are
[12:32] possible
[12:33] amen when they were at the hospital just
[12:35] a few days ago before they transferred
[12:38] they were getting ready to transfer her
[12:39] to a rehab facility
[12:42] and uh she just wasn't responding very
[12:45] much
[12:45] and the doctors had talked about how she
[12:48] just
[12:48] didn't have any response to their neuro
[12:50] checks and
[12:52] brother tim was in the room and he just
[12:53] leaned over to her and said let the weak
[12:55] say
[12:56] and she looked over at him and said i am
[12:58] strong
[13:00] amen and it was a testimony to those
[13:02] there in the room
[13:03] and i believe even the doctor had
[13:05] mentioned at that time
[13:07] that we need you to work here because
[13:09] you can do things for patients that we
[13:11] can't
[13:13] amen and i know that the bible says let
[13:16] the weak say i am strong
[13:18] i mean i believe we can say that for her
[13:20] for each one of these needs tonight

[13:25] child that was just recently murdered

[13:37] for the family of stephen roberts cousin
[13:40] of sister mandy that just passed away

[13:44] think we can bind together as a church
[13:46] body and say let the weak
[13:48] say i am strong amen let's sing that
[13:50] song together
[13:52] let the weak say

[35:40] grace and your mercy

[35:47] your mercy that you've called us in this
[35:49] generation lord
[35:51] we see a world lord just tumbling into
[35:54] chaos

[36:29] hands that were lifted all over this
[36:30] building
[36:32] you know what that hand represents lord
[36:34] and i believe it's an action to cause a
[36:35] reaction
[36:37] just as that woman would lift a hand and
[36:39] touch the hem of your garment i believe
[36:41] we're that close to you tonight lord
[36:43] to touch your garment father to reach
[36:45] out and

[37:02] making us your people
[37:04] in jesus name amen
[37:09] amen you turn your bibles to hebrews
[37:11] chapter 13 and verse 8
[37:13] also matthew 21 and verse 21
[37:17] amen brother tim is almost here from
[37:20] visiting sister karen today hey man
[37:22] she's
[37:24] just really just still continues to heal
[37:27] and we're just believing for a complete
[37:29] healing and complete deliverance and
[37:31] total restoration
[37:33] amen and she responded to a few things
[37:36] today not really open her eyes much but
[37:39] we know she has before and she'll do it
[37:41] again
[37:42] amen so we're just resting upon that
[37:45] hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8
[37:48] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[37:51] and forever matthew 21 21 says and jesus
[37:56] answered and said unto them verily i say
[37:59] unto you
[38:00] if you have faith and doubt not yet
[38:04] shall not own
[38:04] ye shall not only do this which is done
[38:07] to the fig tree
[38:08] but also if you shall say unto this
[38:11] mountain
[38:12] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[38:14] the sea
[38:15] it shall be done i i don't see that it
[38:19] says it might be or may be
[38:21] it shall be done and all things
[38:25] how many can say all things whatsoever
[38:28] you asked
[38:29] you shall ask in prayer believing ye
[38:32] shall receive amen we'll let you
[38:36] be seated today
[38:39] i'd like to speak to you on jesus christ
[38:41] the same
[38:43] incredible but true
[38:46] incredible but true looking at this
[38:48] scripture in matthew 21 it's a
[38:51] a scripture of no doubt that we draw
[38:54] strength from in our times of need and
[38:56] situations and
[38:58] and i believe that god was speaking to a
[39:00] people that would be
[39:01] standing upon the even though he's
[39:03] speaking to a people there before him
[39:05] but it was also
[39:06] speaking to a people that would come in
[39:08] the last day
[39:10] that would have need of these things
[39:11] that we could draw strength from these
[39:13] things
[39:14] and it says you shall say unto this
[39:16] mountain it's a this is actually
[39:19] in the greek it's a they call it a
[39:21] proverbial phrase
[39:22] used by arabic writing is to remove
[39:25] mountains
[39:27] is to accomplish the most difficult
[39:30] the stupendous which is the extremely
[39:32] impressive
[39:34] and incredible thing amen i don't think
[39:37] he would put that in his word unless it
[39:39] was the ability for that
[39:40] word to come to pass i i don't think
[39:43] that he would come to the place that
[39:45] we're living in and
[39:47] and you know when all of a sudden this
[39:48] word is no longer has power it no longer
[39:51] has strength it has no longer
[39:53] the ability to move in the time that
[39:56] we're living in but it does have the
[39:57] same ability the same power
[40:00] because his word is ever true amen his
[40:02] word is not a temporary word it's not a
[40:04] word that's but he spoke in that moment
[40:06] and that's all it was to it
[40:08] but it's an eternal word therefore we
[40:10] can pull strength from it even in the
[40:12] day that we live in
[40:14] you know brother branham would say this
[40:16] and god talked to moses he said i
[40:17] believe
[40:18] that the age has come now the miraculous
[40:21] the phenomenal
[40:22] the baptism of the spirit the power and
[40:25] signs and wonders
[40:27] this great pouring out of god's spirit
[40:30] in the last days
[40:31] and that's the thing that'll bring faith
[40:33] in the people that will take a rapture
[40:35] in faith
[40:36] that'll take the church into glory i
[40:39] believe it
[40:40] and i'm here to stand on this same place
[40:42] i believe it as well i believe this is
[40:44] the time
[40:45] for the phenomenal this is the time for
[40:47] the baptism of the spirit
[40:49] of the holy ghost it's the time for god
[40:51] to show his power and we got
[40:54] many quotes that we could i was actually
[40:56] playing the tape
[40:57] to my mom yesterday as brother branham
[40:59] would say god loves
[41:00] to display his power and so he'd bring
[41:03] you to a place so he would have to show
[41:05] you
[41:06] who he is and he says all of these
[41:08] sayings coming in this
[41:09] last days and this moment that we're
[41:12] living in now
[41:12] as we've been on this thought of jesus
[41:14] christ the same you know the devil
[41:16] doesn't
[41:17] doesn't he don't he don't mind if you
[41:19] think of god in a time
[41:20] past or a god of history or or you think
[41:23] of a god maybe in the future and we keep
[41:25] putting it off in the future
[41:27] but what he really don't want you to
[41:29] believe is the god of now
[41:31] amen a word of now a time of now that
[41:34] this is the time for these things to
[41:36] come to pass amen
[41:38] you know i brother brother i seem
[41:40] brother window was ministering on this
[41:41] this title if not now when you know as
[41:44] we've seen it
[41:46] repeated several times in the last few
[41:48] months
[41:49] on the chosen you know and i thought
[41:50] that was a very good thing as no doubt
[41:52] jesus
[41:53] would wrestle within himself you know
[41:55] when is my time to step into the place
[41:57] that god has called me to be
[41:59] because he knew when he stepped into
[42:01] that place where it would lead to
[42:03] and so he would battle with that but you
[42:05] know i believe that we're also come to a
[42:07] place to where if not now
[42:09] when are we going to believe for the
[42:11] supernatural
[42:12] if not now when are we going to believe
[42:15] for the baptism of the holy ghost to
[42:17] fall upon our lives to
[42:18] to changes to lift us up to to rewrite
[42:21] our whole lives amen
[42:23] if not now when are we going to believe
[42:25] for the power of god and the church of
[42:27] god
[42:28] if not now when are we going to believe
[42:30] for the signs and wonders
[42:31] to be in our midst that god's the healer
[42:34] and the deliverer and the savior
[42:36] amen if not now when are you going to
[42:38] believe for your family to be
[42:40] amen to be saved if not now when are you
[42:42] going to believe
[42:43] for the healing of your body if not now
[42:46] when are you going to believe that god
[42:48] can come and do exactly
[42:49] what he did 2 000 years ago what he did
[42:52] 60 years ago
[42:53] he's still the same today i believe the
[42:56] time is now that people begin to believe
[42:58] with all their hearts
[42:59] that this is the moment this is the time
[43:01] look we see the world getting in this
[43:03] position we see the world
[43:05] going into complete chaos say man
[43:07] thinking about the believers in south
[43:09] africa right now as their countries
[43:10] being torn apart
[43:12] and turned upside down to where they
[43:13] can't even get a loaf of bread and they
[43:15] can't go to the market they can't go to
[43:16] work
[43:17] because of some rioting that has taken
[43:19] place and and destruction everywhere
[43:21] listen it's just a foretaste of what is
[43:23] coming upon this earth
[43:25] this earth is going deeper and deeper
[43:27] and deeper into darkness
[43:29] it's going deeper and deeper into chaos
[43:31] it's going deeper
[43:32] and deeper and deeper into sin so if we
[43:35] can see the world
[43:36] of coming into fruition of what the word
[43:39] spoke of it
[43:40] and the word is also spoken of a people
[43:42] that's coming into their place
[43:44] into their position to believe that all
[43:46] things are possible
[43:49] i don't know yeah and then we're coming
[43:51] to moments and we're going to have to
[43:52] believe
[43:53] for some incredible things amen and
[43:56] even more incredible than a healing or a
[43:58] deliverance amen what's more incredible
[44:00] than the rapture for a change of the
[44:02] body
[44:03] amen you know what brother branham would
[44:04] talk about in the paradox he said
[44:06] and you know webster would describe the
[44:09] word paradox as something
[44:11] that seems incredible but true therefore
[44:14] a paradox
[44:15] would be the same as a miracle amen a
[44:17] paradox is something that seemed just
[44:19] like it couldn't be
[44:21] the knowledge of human mind it's all
[44:23] together incredible but yet
[44:25] it's proven true how has it proven how's
[44:28] god's word proven true
[44:29] by it coming to pass it's not proven
[44:32] true by science is not proven true by
[44:34] intellectual abilities to put it all
[44:36] together god's word
[44:38] is proven true by coming to pass the
[44:41] word that says he the lord god that
[44:42] heals all our diseases
[44:44] is proven true by coming to pass in a
[44:46] body
[44:47] that is sick but now is now made well
[44:49] amen
[44:50] the word that is spoken of it he will he
[44:53] will forgive all iniquities is proven
[44:55] true
[44:55] by the blood of jesus the holy ghost
[44:58] coming into a life
[44:59] and so changing their life amen to where
[45:01] it's so incredible who they used to be
[45:03] they're not no more
[45:05] what they used to do they don't do that
[45:07] no more that's an incredible thing
[45:09] in a world that is so driven by sin and
[45:12] and the attributes and the things of sin
[45:15] until people are actually drunk on
[45:17] on sin they're so consumed with it
[45:20] they're so bound by it but in the middle
[45:22] of a sin
[45:23] consumed world a person can be born
[45:25] again of the holy ghost
[45:27] and their desires be so changed and so
[45:30] turned around to where they're no longer
[45:32] the same person
[45:33] they no longer have the same desires
[45:36] they no longer have the same wants the
[45:38] same
[45:38] amen whether we used to go where they
[45:40] used to go they don't go no more
[45:42] what they used to do they don't do no
[45:44] more amen if god can do that
[45:46] in an age that we're living in it's an
[45:49] incredible thing but it's a true thing
[45:53] i'm looking at the manifestation of the
[45:56] holy ghost and lives amen
[45:58] in the middle of chaos in the middle of
[46:00] laodicea
[46:01] when this world is at its worst and sin
[46:04] is at its apex
[46:05] apex right in the middle of it god has
[46:08] raised
[46:09] up a people to show him my power is
[46:12] greater than satan's power
[46:13] my power is greater than the fear my
[46:16] power
[46:17] is greater than unbelief my power is
[46:19] greater than drugs and
[46:21] alcohol and every spirit of the devil my
[46:24] power
[46:24] is greater than sex since my power is
[46:27] greater than the enemy
[46:29] [Applause]
[46:30] and he's allowed him to come into this
[46:32] world so great
[46:34] to show he's greater
[46:39] oh hallelujah amen it's a miracle
[46:42] a miracle it's all together incredible
[46:45] but yet it's proven to be true
[46:48] it's incredible but yet it's the truth
[46:51] people today a lot of them he said a lot
[46:53] of modernist believes
[46:54] that the days of miracles are past
[46:58] or some of them believe they're coming
[47:00] he said they don't believe there's no
[47:02] such a thing many times as a miracle
[47:04] he said i believe that the world is full
[47:07] of miracles
[47:09] believe that this church this evening is
[47:12] full of miracles
[47:15] it goes he goes on he said i believe
[47:18] it's a paradox
[47:19] constantly that in a sin-filled world
[47:22] there's a miracle
[47:24] oh hallelujah in a world full of
[47:26] sickness
[47:27] there's a miracle in the world full of
[47:30] sin
[47:30] there's a miracle he said for instance i
[47:33] believe that ever
[47:33] born to excuse me every born-again
[47:36] member
[47:36] of the body of christ is a miracle or a
[47:39] paradox
[47:40] in themselves i believe that each one of
[47:44] you methodists and presbyterian and
[47:46] lutheran
[47:47] that never had experienced the baptism
[47:49] of the holy spirit
[47:50] but she was in some formal church that
[47:52] did not believe in the genuine
[47:54] new birth but now have you ever received
[47:56] the baptism of the holy ghost
[47:58] he said it's a perfect example of a
[48:01] paradox
[48:02] he said because something happened to
[48:04] you that
[48:05] changed your whole being and anyone can
[48:08] look at that
[48:09] and know that that is a miracle
[48:13] oh hallelujah amen you can look at your
[48:15] neighbor and say you're a miracle
[48:18] to be honest we're all miracles to be
[48:21] sitting where we're sitting under the
[48:23] deluge of sin and the deluge of unbelief
[48:27] and
[48:27] how dark and how how impossible it may
[48:30] seem
[48:30] but yet we still remain yet we're still
[48:34] here even though all the mind battles
[48:36] and all those pressures
[48:37] of satan's eating yet we're still here
[48:40] yet we still remain amen it's incredible
[48:44] but it's true
[48:48] unless you experience that miracle
[48:52] of receiving the baptism of the holy
[48:53] ghost which
[48:55] changes everything about you
[48:58] unless that happens you cannot be a
[49:00] christian there must be that
[49:02] paradox for you to become a christian
[49:04] because no one can change a spirit in a
[49:06] man
[49:07] and give him the new birth unless it's
[49:09] god outside of god
[49:11] god alone is the only one that can do it
[49:14] and it's a miracle how that god can take
[49:16] a man's thinking
[49:18] and take his ways take his life take
[49:21] everything that he ever thought was true
[49:23] and change it from what it was to what
[49:26] it can be
[49:27] and what he can make it oh my i might
[49:30] have to read that again
[49:31] it's a miracle how that god can take a
[49:34] man's thinking
[49:36] and his ways and his life and everything
[49:39] and change it from what it was to what
[49:42] it can be
[49:44] what he can make it
[49:48] oh think about it the devil thought he
[49:50] had you
[49:51] the devil was trying to destroy you but
[49:54] god
[49:54] rich in mercy came on the scene and he
[49:57] called you
[49:58] from the place that you was and he
[50:00] changed your ways
[50:01] he changed your thinking he changed your
[50:04] life
[50:04] he changed everything about you to what
[50:07] you can be
[50:08] in his thinking to what you can be what
[50:11] he thought about you before the
[50:13] foundation of the world
[50:17] it's incredible but it's true
[50:21] that moon standing now today
[50:24] they say 238 900
[50:27] feet i don't know how they got that long
[50:29] of a tape measure but they said it was
[50:30] that
[50:30] many miles away from the earth and yet
[50:33] controls
[50:34] the tide on the seas it's incredible
[50:38] you know you go down the beach and
[50:40] sometimes
[50:41] where you're standing looks like it's
[50:43] lower than where the sea is
[50:45] and you're wondering why the ocean ain't
[50:47] coming ain't coming in on you because it
[50:50] seems like
[50:50] it seems incredible that it's not just
[50:52] washing over you because you look like
[50:54] anybody ever been there where it looks
[50:56] like the ocean is higher than where
[50:57] you're standing
[50:58] and it seems like at any moment it
[51:00] should come in and wash you but there's
[51:02] a power there controlling it
[51:04] it's incredible but it's true amen
[51:07] there's a power the moon as it would
[51:08] move around the earth and how it
[51:10] rotates or whatever goes on with that
[51:12] and the gravity pull
[51:13] it pulls the tides in and it pulls them
[51:15] out and it was put in a perfect place it
[51:18] was put in a perfect
[51:20] exact marker from the earth to do its
[51:23] job
[51:23] you know if it would move out of that
[51:24] place chaos would ensue upon this earth
[51:27] even floods and every tsunamis and every
[51:30] kind of thing would take place
[51:31] but yet it stands there amen controlling
[51:34] the tide
[51:35] and the moon rocks you know if it would
[51:37] rock out like that from the earth
[51:39] the tide goes with it it comes back and
[51:41] the tide comes back in
[51:42] god has put the moon over the tides to
[51:45] set the boundaries
[51:47] that they cannot pass this boundary
[51:49] where
[51:50] god drawed the line
[51:53] god drawed the line but the moon holds
[51:55] it in place
[51:58] amen we heard not too many years ago
[52:00] brother donnie reagan talking about the
[52:01] ministry of the moon
[52:02] and how he typed it out with the bride
[52:04] of jesus christ
[52:06] god has drawn the boundaries but he's
[52:08] got a people here
[52:09] holding it in his place that all of
[52:12] these things cannot be unleashed upon
[52:15] this earth
[52:15] until this people gets off the face of
[52:18] this earth
[52:18] [Applause]
[52:21] you can all when god drove the line and
[52:24] said you can only come this close
[52:26] you cannot take the rest of it for i put
[52:29] my guard over you
[52:30] oh hallelujah that moon thousands of
[52:33] miles from the earth
[52:34] calls to that sea and it sets its
[52:37] boundaries and it controls it
[52:39] incredible what is on that moon
[52:44] we're just a few miles off the earth all
[52:46] gravitation all air
[52:48] it goes and it go out into space and
[52:50] there's not even air for millions and
[52:51] millions and millions multiplied on
[52:53] millions of miles
[52:54] and yet it controls what's going on on
[52:57] the earth
[52:59] saying you can only go so far you can go
[53:02] no further for i am the guard of god
[53:04] i am the watchdog that's been set here
[53:07] and you cannot pass these boundaries
[53:09] that's a paradox it cannot be explained
[53:12] it's incredible but it's true
[53:16] amen you know and then we've got a
[53:18] winter time that comes and this year was
[53:20] one of our worst that i could
[53:21] i can ever remember snow on the ground
[53:23] and cold
[53:24] and grounds freezing but there's this
[53:27] little seed
[53:28] that's laying down the inside and it
[53:30] freezes and it bursts open and
[53:33] and the pulp runs out of it and that
[53:35] little germ of life
[53:36] is laying there in the dust and a frozen
[53:38] sheet of ice
[53:39] that would kill any life how is it
[53:41] preserved
[53:42] because alone comes springtime here it
[53:44] comes up again
[53:47] it's incredible but it's true
[53:52] you know we look at hebrews 11th chapter
[53:54] and we understand paul
[53:55] said the world was framed and put
[53:57] together
[53:58] by the word of god a word that could
[54:01] speak
[54:02] and out of that word with material
[54:04] materializing earth and
[54:05] out of that word would word when we
[54:08] materialize the sun
[54:09] out of that word would materialize moons
[54:12] and stars
[54:13] that's incredible that he could say
[54:17] let there be and he was so
[54:23] he would speak out of nothing to form
[54:26] something
[54:30] so that things that do appear today
[54:33] were made out of things that did not
[54:36] appear
[54:40] you're sitting on something today that
[54:42] once did not appear
[54:45] you looked at the sun today that once
[54:48] did not appear
[54:49] tonight you'll go out and you'll see
[54:51] stars that once did not hang there
[54:54] amen you know once there was nothing it
[54:56] was blackness it was
[54:57] it was just nothing but void and empty
[54:59] space but a word spoke
[55:02] and the holy spirit began to woo over
[55:04] that word and bring that word to pass
[55:06] amen
[55:07] until we're amen now we can look and
[55:09] we've got solar systems that they can't
[55:11] even get to the end of
[55:12] and we got stars that they can't even
[55:15] measure the distance of them and we've
[55:17] got things around us
[55:18] and we take so for granted
[55:23] and the word of god spoken to existence
[55:31] so i ask you this question
[55:35] why would we be afraid
[55:39] to trust the one who gives such a word
[55:43] with power and authority
[55:47] why would we be afraid this is the
[55:49] prophet of god
[55:50] why would we be afraid to take that word
[55:54] to ourselves
[55:55] and apply it to ourselves
[55:58] it shows he said if we're afraid that we
[56:01] fall into unbelief
[56:03] but it's a paradox you know it's a it's
[56:05] an incredible thing that
[56:07] that god would call abraham in his old
[56:10] age
[56:11] and he would tell him you're going to
[56:12] i'm going from you i'm going to bring
[56:14] forth a nation and
[56:15] i'm not you're 100 years old and sarah's
[56:18] 90th and you're buying past all the
[56:20] child bearing but
[56:21] out of you is going to come a seed
[56:25] it was incredible it looked impossible
[56:32] but it was true because it came to pass
[56:35] abraham
[56:36] was good as dead sarah passed barry her
[56:39] womb was a good or dead yet
[56:40] god said he was going to bring a child
[56:43] as ask the doctor if a woman 100 or 90
[56:45] years old can raise a baby or have a
[56:47] baby it's impossible
[56:48] it's incredible but she did it
[56:52] why because god said she would
[56:55] it's an incredible thing to think that a
[56:58] man could sit there with his back to a
[57:00] tent
[57:00] a stranger with dust on his clothes and
[57:03] tell a woman who was behind him
[57:05] what she was thinking about it's
[57:07] incredible but it's true
[57:10] it's incredible you can listen to the
[57:12] text that god would come in our
[57:14] generation
[57:15] and time after time after time say
[57:18] you've done
[57:18] you have this song on you and you got
[57:20] this and you got that and
[57:21] you live at this address and you're in
[57:23] this certain city oh she's to miss it
[57:27] stella
[57:32] incredible but true
[57:37] it was incredible when abraham took
[57:40] isaac to the top of the mountain
[57:42] after he received him and god said take
[57:44] him and sacrifice him unto me
[57:47] when he got to the top of the mountain
[57:49] and he laid isaac on the wood
[57:51] and was ready to take his life and when
[57:53] he was coming down with his hands
[57:54] something caught his hand and there was
[57:58] a voice that spoke
[57:59] and said don't do it abraham there's
[58:01] something that's already been provided
[58:03] and he looks around
[58:04] and there's a ram hung in some bushes
[58:08] he wasn't there when he walked up he
[58:10] wasn't there while he was preparing the
[58:12] altar
[58:12] it wasn't there when he isaac laid down
[58:15] it wasn't there as he pulled back his
[58:17] knife
[58:18] but all of a sudden out of nothing came
[58:20] around
[58:22] it's incredible but it's true
[58:26] how did it get there
[58:30] on top of the mountain there should have
[58:31] been something killed it should have
[58:33] been wild dogs maybe grab it or
[58:35] no water up there why was it there when
[58:37] he picked up the rocks
[58:40] why wasn't it there when when isaac was
[58:43] looking around and
[58:44] saying well we got the wood we got the
[58:46] we got the rocks we got it all
[58:48] where's the sacrifice
[58:52] and abraham would would speak some
[58:55] incredible words
[58:56] my god will provide that
[59:00] hallelujah and out of them words came a
[59:03] creative force
[59:04] that put a ram and a bush
[59:08] well come on now he's called that place
[59:10] jehovah jireh
[59:12] the lord will provide himself a
[59:15] sacrifice
[59:17] true but he is still jehovah jireh
[59:22] he's still the provider he's still the
[59:25] need supplier
[59:26] he's still what you have need of he's
[59:28] just looking for somebody
[59:30] to speak the word and watch him bring it
[59:32] to pass
[59:33] [Applause]
[59:43] it was a paradox when jesus would say
[59:47] if you say to this mountain be moved
[59:52] and don't doubt in your heart but
[59:54] believe that what you have said will
[59:56] come to pass
[59:57] you can have what you said
[1:00:01] it's incredible but it's true
[1:00:07] we saw it demonstrated in this very age
[1:00:09] that we're living in
[1:00:11] brother brown would be in the woods
[1:00:14] setting by the side of a tree
[1:00:16] no squirrels in the woods but when a
[1:00:20] voice spoke and said say
[1:00:21] where they'll be
[1:00:24] and he would point his finger to a bare
[1:00:26] limb walnut tree it said
[1:00:28] he'll sit right there and there he was
[1:00:32] it's incredible but true he said where
[1:00:35] will the next one be
[1:00:36] over and that bunch of couple stuff and
[1:00:38] i never took my finger down to there he
[1:00:40] was
[1:00:41] where will the next one be out on that
[1:00:43] snag over the field
[1:00:45] and there he was it's incredible but
[1:00:47] it's true
[1:00:50] and there he went to hattie wright's
[1:00:52] house and there she's sitting there
[1:00:54] two boys had been a bunch of renegades
[1:00:57] boys of the world
[1:00:58] and there she's sitting there and he
[1:00:59] said howdy the lord god you said
[1:01:02] the lord god he provided those squirrels
[1:01:05] he's jehovah jaira
[1:01:08] and she responded that's nothing but the
[1:01:11] truth of god
[1:01:14] oh hallelujah you don't have to have a
[1:01:16] big scientific formula to try to come up
[1:01:19] with what to say
[1:01:20] just respond to his word and say it's
[1:01:22] the truth he said it i believe it
[1:01:25] he said it i'm going to stand upon it
[1:01:28] his word declares it and i'm not backing
[1:01:30] up from it
[1:01:31] [Applause]
[1:01:32] it's nothing but the truth
[1:01:39] she said the right thing
[1:01:42] seems incredible that a human could
[1:01:44] speak a word and god bring it to pass
[1:01:48] brother branham would say you know it
[1:01:49] says as dirty and filthy as we are
[1:01:53] who are we who is he that sits back
[1:01:56] yonder beyond the moon stars in space
[1:01:58] and time and eternity
[1:02:01] even the angels are dirty in his sight
[1:02:05] who are we he said but a woman said the
[1:02:08] right thing
[1:02:09] and that called on the heart of jehovah
[1:02:14] said ask her what she wants and it'll be
[1:02:16] given to her
[1:02:18] incredible but true right here now in
[1:02:20] our sight he says there's visible
[1:02:22] evidence
[1:02:23] she asked for her boy souls to be
[1:02:25] christians and
[1:02:26] god gave her her desires he said oh
[1:02:29] that's incredible
[1:02:30] that's more of a miracle than healing a
[1:02:32] sick person
[1:02:34] he said that changing a man's life so
[1:02:36] body
[1:02:37] and all he is it changed their whole
[1:02:40] makeup
[1:02:44] well that tells me if i'm looking at a
[1:02:46] bunch of people
[1:02:47] that's been their whole makeup's been
[1:02:49] changed
[1:02:51] i'm looking at people who once were
[1:02:53] druggies and once were alcohols and
[1:02:55] well into alcohol once were smokers and
[1:02:58] once was all kinds of every kind of
[1:03:00] spirits
[1:03:01] hanging over their lives but god rich in
[1:03:04] mercy
[1:03:04] came down upon their lives and the
[1:03:07] prophet of god said that's more of a
[1:03:09] miracle
[1:03:10] than a healing when i say if god could
[1:03:12] change a life
[1:03:14] god can heal a sick person
[1:03:17] if god can lift up brother hell from the
[1:03:19] darkness of sin
[1:03:21] and every kind of spirit of hell and
[1:03:23] change his motives and change his mind
[1:03:26] and change his heart the same god that
[1:03:28] did that for him
[1:03:29] it's the same god that can go to room
[1:03:31] 106.
[1:03:35] oh hallelujah because he's the same god
[1:03:40] and if he can do that great thing he can
[1:03:42] do that great thing
[1:03:43] if he can open your eyes he'll open her
[1:03:46] eyes
[1:03:48] it's incredible but it's true
[1:03:50] [Applause]
[1:03:56] hallelujah
[1:03:58] if he can restore the thinking of a man
[1:04:00] amen going down the wrong path
[1:04:02] got it all made up and all planned out
[1:04:05] and god
[1:04:06] changed it in a moment
[1:04:09] and a person laying there with brain
[1:04:12] blades
[1:04:15] this is no hard thing for my god
[1:04:21] not what i'm seeing around me
[1:04:26] you know i i was talking and trouble he
[1:04:28] was me and andrew was talking
[1:04:30] the other day we went to go pick up
[1:04:32] something in town as the brothers needed
[1:04:34] something here for the
[1:04:36] the little play area was talking about
[1:04:39] it i said you know
[1:04:42] i said i don't understand somebody that
[1:04:45] can't believe in god
[1:04:49] i said because if you don't believe in
[1:04:51] god you can't call on him when you have
[1:04:54] a need
[1:04:56] and then if you don't get the answer you
[1:04:59] want it
[1:05:00] you can't be mad at him because you
[1:05:03] don't believe in him
[1:05:05] so i don't understand where somebody
[1:05:07] like that where they rest
[1:05:08] where where is the rest for a person
[1:05:10] like that
[1:05:13] i know where my rest is
[1:05:16] my rest isn't the incredible but true
[1:05:22] hallelujah amen you know it ain't a
[1:05:25] scientific thing i ain't got to get it
[1:05:27] all figured out
[1:05:28] figured out how god's going to do it i
[1:05:30] just know he's going to do it
[1:05:32] i ain't got to add it all up it ain't my
[1:05:34] intellectual ability or some doctor's
[1:05:36] intellectual ability
[1:05:38] that's going to produce the healing that
[1:05:39] my mom needs want to produce the healing
[1:05:42] that she needs is this word
[1:05:45] and this word's the same word that saved
[1:05:47] you and you
[1:05:48] and you and you and me and everyone here
[1:05:50] that's saved and filled with the holy
[1:05:52] ghost
[1:05:52] that same word that done that is the
[1:05:54] same word that'll heal every sick person
[1:05:57] in this church
[1:06:00] amen it's time that we start believing
[1:06:03] more than we ever
[1:06:04] have believed it's time we start
[1:06:06] standing upon the promises
[1:06:07] more than we've ever stood upon the
[1:06:09] promises you think the devil's giving up
[1:06:11] no he's pushing harder
[1:06:14] amen but what do you hear in service
[1:06:16] after service
[1:06:17] is cannon shots going back
[1:06:20] nuts i'm not giving up i'm not backing
[1:06:23] off the promise
[1:06:24] what good is it going to do me to start
[1:06:26] disbelieving
[1:06:27] what good is it going to do me to take a
[1:06:29] step back and say god ain't saying
[1:06:32] god what good is it going to know i'm
[1:06:34] going to go forward
[1:06:35] i'm going to speak the word of god by
[1:06:38] his stripes
[1:06:39] she's healed
[1:06:40] [Applause]
[1:06:45] it's incredible but it's true
[1:06:55] it's a paradox incredible
[1:06:58] and noah's time that he would come in a
[1:07:01] scientific net age
[1:07:03] with an unscientific message
[1:07:06] couldn't be proven prepare for rain to
[1:07:09] come from heaven when there was no rain
[1:07:12] never had been no rain there was no way
[1:07:13] to get rain up there
[1:07:15] it had never rained there was no seas
[1:07:17] there was no waters but yet god told him
[1:07:19] to make an ocean for saving of his house
[1:07:21] making heart for saving of his house
[1:07:23] and god brought the rain down
[1:07:26] unscientific in a scientific
[1:07:29] age and you know jesus said as it was in
[1:07:33] the days of noah so shall it be
[1:07:35] so therefore there would have to be
[1:07:36] another message come that's
[1:07:38] unscientific to a scientific age
[1:07:42] amen we're not to build a boat christ is
[1:07:45] building a body
[1:07:47] amen a place a word a refuge that we can
[1:07:51] walk into amen it was a paradox
[1:07:55] when the hebrew children that had
[1:07:56] decided it was going to stay with god's
[1:07:58] word
[1:07:58] regardless of what happened that's where
[1:08:02] you got to be
[1:08:02] regardless of what happened and the king
[1:08:05] built the furnace seven times hotter
[1:08:07] than it ever been
[1:08:08] heated and threw those man in there and
[1:08:10] the intense heat of the fires
[1:08:12] furnace killed the men that walked up
[1:08:14] the gameplay with them
[1:08:16] they died and yet those men walked in
[1:08:18] the furnace for maybe perhaps three
[1:08:20] hours
[1:08:22] there should have been no more than dust
[1:08:24] left of them
[1:08:26] the human life that was in them should
[1:08:28] have perished
[1:08:30] it made other humans die just getting
[1:08:32] close to the fire
[1:08:35] they throw them in there you know maybe
[1:08:36] say three hours maybe five
[1:08:39] after a while the king went back had
[1:08:41] lunch he'd come back and said open up
[1:08:43] that door
[1:08:44] there won't even be dust left to them
[1:08:46] anymore but when he opened them there
[1:08:48] they were
[1:08:48] in the middle of the fire unharmed
[1:08:51] walking around
[1:08:52] incredible but true
[1:08:57] how did you how many did you put in
[1:08:59] there we put three
[1:09:01] well i'm counting four
[1:09:06] hallelujah and that one looks like the
[1:09:09] son
[1:09:09] of the gods he wasn't the son of the
[1:09:12] gods he was the son of god
[1:09:16] they were heathens but god in his great
[1:09:18] word came down
[1:09:20] to where they were it's incredible but
[1:09:24] it's true
[1:09:32] you know i let's tell a few things for a
[1:09:36] moment
[1:09:39] one of my first times to ever go
[1:09:41] overseas to minute where the first time
[1:09:43] the minister was with brother danny
[1:09:44] steeman and brother jackie benton
[1:09:47] 2003 been ministering a couple of years
[1:09:51] very young in the ministry and
[1:09:54] brother danny had met him up there when
[1:09:56] he moved for a brief moment up to
[1:09:58] missouri and
[1:09:59] we became bosom friends and still are
[1:10:02] today
[1:10:04] and uh so he invited me to go with him
[1:10:07] and
[1:10:07] brother jackie had kind of took brother
[1:10:08] danny under his wing when brother danny
[1:10:10] was a young man and took him different
[1:10:12] places and
[1:10:13] brother daddy took me down there with
[1:10:15] brother jackie and
[1:10:17] and uh just say this brother jackie was
[1:10:19] a great man of god
[1:10:21] he's a great man of god he traveled the
[1:10:24] world over and
[1:10:25] they wrote songs about his exploits
[1:10:29] and uh just done some amazing things
[1:10:31] matter of fact that trip
[1:10:32] he would get off the plane from the
[1:10:34] philippines next day get on the plane to
[1:10:36] go with us to guyana that's what kind of
[1:10:38] man he was
[1:10:39] he was the kind of man that when he was
[1:10:40] down in the middle of a jungle
[1:10:42] unbelieving kids would walk out of this
[1:10:44] jungle and say hey brother jackie's back
[1:10:48] quite a reputation
[1:10:51] i know people want to criticize him but
[1:10:53] that's quite a
[1:10:54] reputation amen and
[1:10:57] and so here we went down into the
[1:10:59] jungles for just a little brief
[1:11:01] excursion and
[1:11:02] and on a boat down into the river and
[1:11:04] we're you know we're preaching down at
[1:11:05] this little place and you know when i
[1:11:08] you you just try my actually at that
[1:11:10] time my papaw just went in to
[1:11:12] have some heart his heart checked and
[1:11:14] there was a lot of ifs about that and
[1:11:15] didn't know if he was going to make it
[1:11:17] or not and
[1:11:18] here i'm down in the jungles no
[1:11:19] communication and
[1:11:21] you know he's worried he starts setting
[1:11:23] in and things
[1:11:24] and uh so we're walking back and forth
[1:11:27] to the church
[1:11:29] and uh i i i was i can't remember who
[1:11:32] ministered that night seemed like
[1:11:33] brother danny did but anyway
[1:11:34] we're walking back into some moonlit
[1:11:36] night
[1:11:38] and i was in the lead and i was walking
[1:11:41] down this path we'd been walking it for
[1:11:42] several nights now and so we kind of
[1:11:44] knew the way and so i'm walking it
[1:11:46] and i literally as i'm walking i felt a
[1:11:47] hand a pressure hit me right here in the
[1:11:50] chest
[1:11:51] and it stopped me brother danny kind of
[1:11:54] bumped up behind me and he said what's
[1:11:55] wrong i said i don't know
[1:11:57] i said but something stopped me and we
[1:11:59] started digging in our pockets for our
[1:12:00] flashlights and
[1:12:01] shined and there was their most
[1:12:03] poisonous snake laying right there in
[1:12:05] our path
[1:12:07] but god was showing me very early that
[1:12:09] he's with me
[1:12:12] it's incredible but it's true we'd go
[1:12:16] later on that journey and we'd fly 45
[1:12:18] minutes off into a
[1:12:20] basically a wilderness out into the
[1:12:21] jungle way off and they're laying
[1:12:23] landing a little dirt strip and we'd get
[1:12:24] in a boat and we'd go up the river for a
[1:12:26] few hours and
[1:12:27] we'd preach there would move over here
[1:12:29] for another few hours to another church
[1:12:30] and preach there and
[1:12:32] and and the brother taking us wanted to
[1:12:34] go way on up about eight hours into the
[1:12:36] jungle areas
[1:12:37] further and and and to go to this nomad
[1:12:40] tribe that he had been witnessing to
[1:12:42] and and so he said i don't know if
[1:12:44] they'd be there he said i can't get
[1:12:45] communication i've been trying he said
[1:12:47] but
[1:12:47] what do y'all feel to do and so we felt
[1:12:49] to go so we got in the boat about two
[1:12:50] o'clock in the morning
[1:12:51] because it was a river to catch the
[1:12:53] tides you had to go with the tide coming
[1:12:55] in it went out went in and out with the
[1:12:56] tide
[1:12:57] so we jumped in the boat and we going
[1:12:58] with the tied up river
[1:13:00] about 10 o'clock in the day the days
[1:13:02] breaking
[1:13:03] had been broken and we pulled under this
[1:13:06] canopy of the jungle and
[1:13:08] you know i'm trying to figure out what's
[1:13:10] going on and i sit up for a moment and i
[1:13:12] look around and
[1:13:14] out of the bushes just almost like they
[1:13:15] just come out of nowhere it's coming
[1:13:17] this white-haired indian and these two
[1:13:18] other indians with them and
[1:13:20] they got these sticks in their hands and
[1:13:21] this white-haired indian screaming to
[1:13:23] the
[1:13:23] just screaming like this and i'm
[1:13:25] thinking lord have mercy
[1:13:28] yeah you delivered me from a snake and
[1:13:30] i'm about to be lunch
[1:13:33] i didn't know what was happening and so
[1:13:36] i
[1:13:36] i'm just sitting there kind of looking
[1:13:38] trying to figure it out and look at
[1:13:39] brother basil there
[1:13:40] taking this up and i see a tear coming
[1:13:42] down his eye
[1:13:44] and i said oh we got something's
[1:13:46] happening here and so
[1:13:47] i i he finally turned around and looked
[1:13:49] at me and brother danny and brother
[1:13:50] jackie and he says
[1:13:51] this is the chief of that tribe that i
[1:13:54] wanted to visit
[1:13:55] he said he was in his tent or tp
[1:13:58] whatever they have little mud hut
[1:13:59] and he said he was there and he went to
[1:14:02] him he prayed and went to sleep and he
[1:14:03] said an angel woke him up
[1:14:05] and said go to the mouth of the creek i
[1:14:07] got three white men bringing fire
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:11] it's incredible but it's true
[1:14:15] hallelujah hey that's a moment that you
[1:14:17] feel like i catch
[1:14:20] amen god knows exactly what we're going
[1:14:23] through
[1:14:24] he would show us this a few weeks ago
[1:14:26] brother ron spencer's as we're
[1:14:28] ministering
[1:14:29] and i'm asking god and asking god to
[1:14:31] move
[1:14:32] and to speak and dad's asking for him to
[1:14:34] speak and people
[1:14:35] and because my mom was having these
[1:14:37] situations and all of a sudden out of
[1:14:39] nowhere my ipad would begin to play
[1:14:41] about a song down from his glory
[1:14:46] showing us he's riding the fire with us
[1:14:50] it's incredible but it's true
[1:14:52] [Applause]
[1:14:54] it's so true to me i'd go to my mother's
[1:14:56] bedside there in the icu
[1:14:58] and she hadn't spoken in 18 hours and
[1:15:00] i'd begin to speak to her and i said mom
[1:15:02] i know god has come down in this fire
[1:15:06] and out of her mouth she'd begin to sing
[1:15:08] down from his glory
[1:15:10] every living story my god and savior
[1:15:13] care
[1:15:13] and jesus but it's true
[1:15:21] hey man she has been seen in the kitchen
[1:15:23] shouting she's been seen in this church
[1:15:24] shouting
[1:15:26] people having dreams god is speaking god
[1:15:29] is moving
[1:15:30] it's time we believe all things are
[1:15:36] possible
[1:15:44] read something today that gave me
[1:15:46] encouragement brother brown would preach
[1:15:47] the gates of hell
[1:15:48] shall not present prevail
[1:15:52] and you would think of that sometimes
[1:15:53] many times as satan being on the attack
[1:15:56] and he is on the attack but this writer
[1:15:59] was right and he said you know it's time
[1:16:01] that the people of god
[1:16:02] go on the offensive it's time
[1:16:06] we quit sitting back and letting the
[1:16:08] devil come on our property and
[1:16:10] moving back a little further and going
[1:16:12] back a little further and going back a
[1:16:13] little further
[1:16:14] he said it's time that we'd go on the
[1:16:16] offensive
[1:16:18] he said i want to encourage your hearts
[1:16:20] because the scripture says
[1:16:21] the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:16:24] he said a gate is not an offensive it's
[1:16:27] a defense
[1:16:30] so hell is trying to defend itself
[1:16:34] come on somebody amen it's time you
[1:16:36] realize your enemy
[1:16:38] it's not it's not you know it's not us
[1:16:39] being afraid of him
[1:16:41] it's him being afraid of what's on the
[1:16:42] inside of you
[1:16:44] it's time we grab our swords and we
[1:16:47] start taking the word of god
[1:16:48] and we say no you're not having this
[1:16:50] child and you're not having this body
[1:16:53] it don't belong to you
[1:16:54] [Applause]
[1:16:57] hallelujah it's time something rises up
[1:17:00] on somebody's heart and saying devil
[1:17:02] i've had enough of you i'm not taking it
[1:17:05] one more night
[1:17:06] i'm not taking it one more moment but
[1:17:08] today
[1:17:09] your head's coming off
[1:17:15] the gates of hell will not prevail in
[1:17:17] other words the gates of hell
[1:17:19] are not going to be able to stand before
[1:17:21] the army of the living god
[1:17:23] [Applause]
[1:17:29] hallelujah
[1:17:32] it would be a paradox incredible
[1:17:36] but true that a little boy could defeat
[1:17:39] a goliath
[1:17:40] a giant when the rest of the army
[1:17:46] was sitting back in fear and brother
[1:17:49] wayne said something that really
[1:17:51] struck me the other day he said when
[1:17:52] saul tried to give david his armor
[1:17:56] david looked at saul and said well
[1:17:57] you're scared to fight with it what good
[1:17:58] is it going to do me
[1:18:02] and that's the truth people want to hand
[1:18:06] you their favorite quotes and they want
[1:18:07] to hand you their favorite
[1:18:08] things and they you know their favorite
[1:18:10] ideas but they're scared to fight
[1:18:15] but i'll take what's proven and what's
[1:18:18] proven is the lord
[1:18:20] said in mark 16 they shall lay hands
[1:18:22] upon the sick
[1:18:26] they shall recover it's proven that by
[1:18:30] his stripes
[1:18:31] they shall be healed it's proven
[1:18:34] amen the promises unto you and your
[1:18:37] children
[1:18:39] proven amen it's incredible but it's
[1:18:42] true
[1:18:46] you know it'd be an incredible thing
[1:18:49] which is what the lord spoke
[1:18:51] maybe used a different word but
[1:18:53] basically basically
[1:18:54] basically the same thought that brother
[1:18:57] wayne
[1:18:58] lawson was right over here on this side
[1:18:59] of the building pushing around
[1:19:01] some dirt there to build so we built the
[1:19:03] parking lots and things
[1:19:05] had to build up that side over there
[1:19:06] about two foot
[1:19:09] maybe more and we're fighting the
[1:19:11] weather and we're fighting people
[1:19:12] our dirt man quickness is on a wednesday
[1:19:15] and rain is supposed to come in just any
[1:19:16] moment you see the
[1:19:17] clouds back here gathering darker and
[1:19:19] darker
[1:19:21] i'm stewing and i'm upset brother
[1:19:24] wayne's just pushing dirt
[1:19:27] finally we get that last truck in and he
[1:19:29] pushes it over smoothes it out and the
[1:19:31] bottom falls out
[1:19:33] and he i run and grab the truck come
[1:19:34] around grab him he jumps in
[1:19:37] it's about five o'clock on a wednesday
[1:19:40] and he has a look at him brother wayne
[1:19:43] i'm sorry i
[1:19:44] i don't know what to say i mean you're
[1:19:47] supposed to be preaching tonight
[1:19:49] he kind of looked at me with his look
[1:19:50] and kind of smirked he said well
[1:19:53] he said you know i was worried like that
[1:19:54] too he said until about 2
[1:19:56] 30 or 3 on on the dozer the lord came
[1:19:59] down and said i'm going to do something
[1:20:01] significant tonight
[1:20:05] i said brother wayne it's been real nice
[1:20:06] if you'd have told me right after that
[1:20:12] he kind of chuckled he's i'm sorry you
[1:20:14] know didn't even think about it
[1:20:15] when we go to the church or to the house
[1:20:18] he gets ready and
[1:20:20] my mom you know what just had her was
[1:20:21] that her first brain bleed
[1:20:23] yeah her first brain bleed and uh
[1:20:27] you know and she's in a weak condition
[1:20:29] and things
[1:20:31] but god has spoke a word and he backed

[1:20:36] i mean he's witnesses of it he backed it
[1:20:39] up
[1:20:40] he said i'm going to do something
[1:20:42] significant tonight
[1:20:43] oh hallelujah oh my we know what

[1:20:47] after midnight of god pouring out the
[1:20:49] blessings of god

[1:21:11] still had them all over and they're gone
[1:21:12] today
[1:21:16] was everyone on here but i didn't
[1:21:17] realize there was a little girl
[1:21:19] had come down to an altar and said i
[1:21:20] want my brother saved
[1:21:23] and there was a word that was released
[1:21:25] and it was a creative word
[1:21:27] it was a word with power and it was
[1:21:29] released into another realm into another
[1:21:32] atmosphere
[1:21:33] over into a place where demons of hell
[1:21:35] had a boy
[1:21:36] bound and they had to back away at the
[1:21:38] presence of god
[1:21:39] and they backed away enough that he
[1:21:41] could get in his truck and come to the
[1:21:43] house of god
[1:21:48] hallelujah i say there's
[1:21:52] more words to be spoken against the
[1:21:54] enemies of god
[1:21:58] hallelujah it's time we put the word of
[1:22:01] god on our lips
[1:22:03] and go to speaking and saying god you
[1:22:05] promised it
[1:22:06] you said it and i believe it and i'm not
[1:22:09] backing away from it
[1:22:10] but i'm going to hold the promises high
[1:22:13] because i believe you're once again the
[1:22:16] same god
[1:22:17] what you did on that wednesday night you
[1:22:19] can do it again on this wednesday night
