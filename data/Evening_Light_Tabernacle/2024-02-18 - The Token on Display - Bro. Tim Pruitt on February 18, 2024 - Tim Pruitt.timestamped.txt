[1:00:24] blessed
[1:00:25] in your presence we ask in Jesus name
[1:00:29] amen and amen God bless you let's turn
[1:00:33] to John 4 and verse 19 and as we're
[1:00:36] turning there I want to thank you for uh
[1:00:39] your continued Mission offerings that
[1:00:42] you give and things that um you know we
[1:00:45] continue to support the little church in
[1:00:48] Japan with um with uh help every month
[1:00:52] on their rental facil ities and we have
[1:00:56] um we have had since the time that you
[1:00:59] uh gave that nice wonderful Mission
[1:01:02] offering here some months ago back in
[1:01:05] 2023 we we've been able to have another
[1:01:09] 100 nearly
[1:01:11] 130 more
[1:01:13] translations um made and put there on
[1:01:16] the on the web for every Japanese
[1:01:18] believer anywhere around the world and
[1:01:20] some of these are are just very very um
[1:01:26] pertinent sermons that that will be
[1:01:28] something that will strengthen them and
[1:01:30] help them and um we we want you to
[1:01:34] realize um you know that you're part of
[1:01:37] this ministry and a part of that so you
[1:01:39] know if you ever have a mission offering
[1:01:41] you want to give or always just take an
[1:01:44] envelope and put a missions on it we'll
[1:01:46] make sure that it goes for that purpose
[1:01:49] and sometimes it it will be um maybe
[1:01:53] maybe to uh places in Africa sometimes
[1:01:56] it will be to Japan sometimes to to the
[1:01:59] Philippines I can't promise you unless
[1:02:01] you designate it exactly where it will
[1:02:04] go but um I will tell you we'll use it
[1:02:07] try to use it for the glory of God so if
[1:02:10] you'll turn with me to John 4 and verse
[1:02:12] 19 we're going to read from there this
[1:02:16] morning and this of course is a woman at
[1:02:18] the well who has had a Divine
[1:02:20] appointment Jesus had a need to go by
[1:02:23] her way and the woman said to him sir I
[1:02:26] perceive that thou art a prophet our
[1:02:29] fathers worshiped in this mountains and
[1:02:31] you say that in Jerusalem is the place
[1:02:34] where men ought to worship and Jesus
[1:02:36] said unto Heroman believe me the hour
[1:02:40] cometh when you shall neither in this
[1:02:43] mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship
[1:02:46] the father you worship you know not what
[1:02:50] we know what we worship for salvation is
[1:02:54] of the Jews but the hour cometh and now
[1:02:58] is when the true worshippers shall
[1:03:01] worship the father in spirit and in
[1:03:04] truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:03:08] worship him God is a spirit and they
[1:03:11] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:03:15] spirit and in truth amen God bless you
[1:03:18] can be
[1:03:20] seated we're going to today speak on the
[1:03:24] um the token on display now we we have
[1:03:29] come to the hour of true worship where
[1:03:32] that we have just read today and and I
[1:03:35] believe it is an hour like that of true
[1:03:38] worship where we must be worshippers of
[1:03:41] God in spirit and in truth and of course
[1:03:45] you know this is a a special hour a day
[1:03:49] that we're living in because this is the
[1:03:52] day the hour that the bride must be
[1:03:56] glorified you remember in the days of
[1:03:58] Jesus the hour came that he had to be
[1:04:02] glorified and and um and of course we
[1:04:05] are in that very same hour now as we
[1:04:08] have moved from from the calvary now to
[1:04:12] through seven Church ages um to the last
[1:04:15] day and it is the hour then that the
[1:04:19] token must be on display and and and
[1:04:22] this is such a vital subject uh even
[1:04:26] brother Bram recognized this to his soul
[1:04:28] because he and referring to his sermon
[1:04:31] on the token he said it's the highlights
[1:04:34] of my entire Ministry and I think what
[1:04:37] kind of emphasis that he placed on this
[1:04:41] vital subject that it would be the
[1:04:43] highlight message of my entire
[1:04:48] Ministry and so the highlight of course
[1:04:50] is the highest point or you know or what
[1:04:53] all of his ministry was pointing to and
[1:04:57] and and just sharing what he said about
[1:05:00] it I I know that everything is worked
[1:05:02] for months and months and months up to
[1:05:05] that one message and moving to come to
[1:05:08] that place it was a capping off time of
[1:05:10] it so he spoke of it as being the height
[1:05:14] of his ministry the climax the the
[1:05:17] capping off and he and and of course he
[1:05:20] uh spoke about that after and then at
[1:05:24] thinking about the Seven Seals that had
[1:05:26] been revealed he said with all the
[1:05:27] messages I ever brought that was
[1:05:30] absolutely ordained of God outside of
[1:05:32] course the regular commission like the
[1:05:34] Seven Seals and things that was directly
[1:05:36] the word of God I'm talking about a
[1:05:38] message to preach I believe that was one
[1:05:41] of it see that that needed to follow
[1:05:43] those Seven
[1:05:45] Seals and then he said now what's what
[1:05:47] came after the seals uniting of the
[1:05:49] people he spoke on uniting time and
[1:05:51] signs and United signs and there
[1:05:54] the red light flashing in the last days
[1:05:57] the sign of women getting prettier and
[1:05:59] man what they would do and all these
[1:06:02] signs of the holy spirit head leading up
[1:06:05] then come back here to the capping off
[1:06:07] of all those messages since the seals is
[1:06:10] kept up in this one thing the token that
[1:06:14] we're all right just check ourselves to
[1:06:17] see if we're in the faith and of course
[1:06:21] I you know I think even in this moment
[1:06:23] as we go now forward now actually many
[1:06:26] years from that we I I am convinced we
[1:06:31] have we have arrived at the zero hour
[1:06:36] where the death angel of course is in
[1:06:38] the land and there are screams of death
[1:06:41] and dying
[1:06:43] everywhere and and of course there's
[1:06:47] going to be a people that is going to
[1:06:49] escape the things that are coming on the
[1:06:52] earth and they will be like Israel when
[1:06:54] they left Egypt out that first time that
[1:06:57] they left out with a high hand and I I
[1:06:59] believe we're going in a Rapture I I
[1:07:02] believe there is an escape there is a
[1:07:04] way out of here that we won't go through
[1:07:07] the judgments that are coming upon the
[1:07:10] Earth but we are at that Zero Hour where
[1:07:13] that you must be
[1:07:16] prepared and and you said well brother
[1:07:19] Tim I made that a long time ago it's
[1:07:21] time to really make your calling an
[1:07:23] election sure there can't be any
[1:07:26] guessing any wondering any pondering any
[1:07:29] any anything there you got to be sure
[1:07:31] that you know that you know that you
[1:07:34] know because to leave here you must have
[1:07:37] a a ticket a a sign a token that your
[1:07:41] sin debt has been paid and the only
[1:07:45] token sign that will be accepted is the
[1:07:48] Holy Ghost when I see the blood I'll
[1:07:51] pass over you now of course of course
[1:07:54] you know um Peter would would tell us
[1:07:57] like this he said you you got to add
[1:08:00] your faith virtue virtue knowledge
[1:08:02] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[1:08:04] brotherly kindness and then of course be
[1:08:06] capped off with the love of God and of
[1:08:09] course this is a process of
[1:08:11] sanctification that caps off a person
[1:08:13] with the very divine nature of God the
[1:08:17] Holy Ghost this is the same charity that
[1:08:21] the same basic quality of divine
[1:08:24] nature that Paul spoke about charity is
[1:08:27] not some Meely Meely um we see wasi
[1:08:32] gooey love charity is the Holy Ghost you
[1:08:36] see it's the divine nature of Christ
[1:08:38] it's God's basic nature and and though
[1:08:42] you speak with tongues of men and angels
[1:08:45] though you have prophecies though you
[1:08:48] have all Faith to move mountains and
[1:08:51] though you give your body to be burned
[1:08:54] or though you you give away everything
[1:08:57] you have to feed the poor and though you
[1:09:00] understand all of the Mysteries and have
[1:09:03] all knowledge if you lack the Holy Ghost
[1:09:06] is all for
[1:09:10] nothing so this is how important is now
[1:09:13] of course you have the Pentecostal say
[1:09:15] we speak in tongues that's our sign we
[1:09:19] have the charismatics that says we move
[1:09:21] mountains with our faith you know we
[1:09:24] have the the Catholics will say our nuns
[1:09:27] our monks take a our poverty the
[1:09:30] Jehovah's Witness will say we have
[1:09:33] actually given our bodies to be burned
[1:09:35] we we believe what we believe so much
[1:09:37] that we have actually you know been
[1:09:40] killed and persecuted by it for it and
[1:09:43] many message people will say well we
[1:09:46] understand all the Mysteries but I just
[1:09:48] want to say again if you lack the Holy
[1:09:52] Ghost it is all for nothing Peter said
[1:09:56] this in second Peter 1 and8 for if these
[1:10:00] things be in you and abound it shall
[1:10:03] make you that you shall neither be
[1:10:05] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:10:07] of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that
[1:10:10] lath these things is blind and cannot
[1:10:14] see a far off and has forgotten that he
[1:10:16] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[1:10:19] the rather Brethren give diligence to
[1:10:21] make your calling an election sure
[1:10:24] notice what he said give diligence to
[1:10:27] make your calling an election sure oh
[1:10:29] I'm elected brother Tim I'm
[1:10:32] predestinated I I know I'm a
[1:10:34] predestinated seed and I know that God
[1:10:37] is has called me and I I'm elected and
[1:10:40] and whatever he said make
[1:10:42] sure give diligence to make your call
[1:10:46] and election sure because if you do
[1:10:48] these things and he's just talking about
[1:10:50] adding your faith virtue virtue
[1:10:51] knowledge knowledge Temper Temper
[1:10:53] patient patient brother uh brotherly
[1:10:55] kindness and godliness and so on and he
[1:10:57] said if you do these things if you have
[1:11:00] been capped off with the Holy Ghost you
[1:11:03] will never
[1:11:04] fall for such an entrance shall be
[1:11:07] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:11:11] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[1:11:13] Savior Jesus Christ this is what we the
[1:11:16] token is it's an entrance that is
[1:11:19] ministered to
[1:11:20] you and God is requiring a token is it's
[1:11:23] a sign that the lamb
[1:11:26] has and that the death of the Lamb has
[1:11:29] been applied so that the death angel can
[1:11:33] pass you see a token is a sign there
[1:11:37] there is a train that is Bound for Glory
[1:11:41] and you must have a ticket a ticket
[1:11:43] showing that the purchase for your
[1:11:45] journey has been paid for you cannot
[1:11:48] just show up you know even to get on an
[1:11:51] airplane without a ticket that's right
[1:11:53] with without some kind of proof of
[1:11:56] purchase that that it is your fair has
[1:12:00] been paid for you now a a Baptist might
[1:12:04] present his works and and say you know
[1:12:07] I've made my profession of faith and I
[1:12:10] confess with my mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:12:13] Christ and and yeah if you do that you
[1:12:15] shall be
[1:12:18] saved did anybody get that you shall be
[1:12:22] saved if you you really make a
[1:12:24] profession with your mouth a confession
[1:12:26] with your mouth and Believe on the Lord
[1:12:29] You're Going To You shall be saved
[1:12:30] you're going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:12:32] that's right but just a mere confession
[1:12:35] with your mouth ain't going to get you
[1:12:38] there a Catholic will present his works
[1:12:41] I've been baptized since an infant I I
[1:12:45] pay my pray the Rosary every day I burn
[1:12:48] a candle every night a Pentecostal will
[1:12:51] say well I spoke in other Tong s a
[1:12:54] charismatic will say we have performed
[1:12:56] Miracles and many marvelous Works in his
[1:13:00] name and you know the answer to that
[1:13:02] there'll be many like that that day
[1:13:03] he'll say depart from me you workers of
[1:13:05] iniquity I never knew you and some some
[1:13:08] others will say well I believe every
[1:13:10] word the prophet said I believe the
[1:13:13] Mysteries you know I believe but none of
[1:13:16] this won't work to get on the
[1:13:20] train so some of you will say depart
[1:13:23] from
[1:13:24] me now the first time this word token
[1:13:30] was used in the Bible was to use to
[1:13:33] describe the sign of the Covenant with
[1:13:37] Noah God set a rainbow in the
[1:13:40] sky and proclaimed it as a sign of the
[1:13:43] Covenant that God would not destroy the
[1:13:46] world again with water so again it's a
[1:13:49] the rainbow is a sign of a covenant the
[1:13:52] second time it was used USS was when God
[1:13:54] made a covenant with Abraham that God
[1:13:57] required a token and that token was a
[1:14:01] sign of circumcision the penalty of not
[1:14:04] having the sign of circumcision that
[1:14:07] token was to be cut off from God and His
[1:14:11] Covenant God used the word again to
[1:14:14] Moses giving him a token a sign saying
[1:14:17] that this will be the sign that I will
[1:14:20] surely be with you that I'm not only
[1:14:22] giving you this sign of a pillar of fire
[1:14:25] but you will bring the people uh from
[1:14:28] Egypt and worship me upon this
[1:14:31] mountain now what a comfort that ought
[1:14:33] have been that no matter what the
[1:14:36] opposition that he knew that you you
[1:14:39] know the word of God said you will serve
[1:14:42] me on this mountain I'm going to give
[1:14:45] you this mountain as a
[1:14:47] sign I appeared here on this mountain
[1:14:50] and you will bring the people right back
[1:14:53] here
[1:14:54] oh I don't know how many times Moses
[1:14:56] must have have looked at it when he felt
[1:14:59] opposition when he saw the the the the
[1:15:03] Pharaoh do what he did and hardened of
[1:15:05] his heart but God you said you would get
[1:15:09] me to that mountain with his people he
[1:15:11] gets boxed in with the Red Sea and maybe
[1:15:14] Moses forgot but God had said and God
[1:15:18] didn't
[1:15:18] forget amen I've given you a sign and
[1:15:22] that sign is is uh you're going to get
[1:15:24] across this Red Sea I you know makes no
[1:15:28] difference what's around you how much
[1:15:30] enemies behind you you're surrounded
[1:15:32] everywhere there's no way through just
[1:15:35] go forward because you know the
[1:15:37] mountains on the other side sometimes I
[1:15:40] don't know what to do sometimes I don't
[1:15:43] know how to respond sometimes I don't
[1:15:46] want know how in the world we're going
[1:15:47] to get through the the the troubles and
[1:15:50] the problems that are in this age but
[1:15:52] I'll tell you God promised amen he gave
[1:15:55] us a Holy Ghost and he said with this
[1:15:58] sign I'm going to take you in a Rapture
[1:16:01] I'm not leaving you here and when I see
[1:16:03] the calamities when I see death
[1:16:05] everywhere when I see problems in the
[1:16:08] world and problems in our nature I know
[1:16:11] this he said he said I'm going to take
[1:16:15] you through I'm not going to leave you
[1:16:17] here I'm going to take you in a Rapture
[1:16:21] I there will be an escape for the thing
[1:16:23] that are coming upon this
[1:16:27] Earth no matter the
[1:16:29] opposition now in Exodus
[1:16:33] 12 God you know it was declared that God
[1:16:37] would judge the people in the land of
[1:16:41] Egypt and you can be making your way
[1:16:44] over to Exodus 12 in your Bible we'll
[1:16:46] read it here from verse 11 here in a
[1:16:48] moment you can actually put it up and
[1:16:50] just hold it there but I want to talk
[1:16:52] about it just for a
[1:16:54] moment as we as we look at
[1:17:01] this that there was coming an a death to
[1:17:07] ever
[1:17:09] firstborn so it was announced in that
[1:17:12] Exodus death is
[1:17:14] coming death is on its
[1:17:16] way and look all had
[1:17:20] sinned there was nobody that was
[1:17:25] Guiltless and I look upon you today
[1:17:28] that's exactly what you were all of us
[1:17:31] have sinned and none of us was worthy
[1:17:35] right every one of us if we got what we
[1:17:37] deserve let me quote brother brandom
[1:17:39] said you'd go to
[1:17:43] hell that's what we're deserving
[1:17:46] of we don't deserve a rapture we don't
[1:17:50] deserve
[1:17:52] heaven
[1:17:54] we don't deserve to escape death if
[1:17:56] we've got what we deserve listen listen
[1:17:59] you say brother Tim I I've been a very
[1:18:01] very Wicked person every one of us have
[1:18:04] been there maybe not doing what you did
[1:18:06] or what you did but just to be if we
[1:18:09] sinned in one point we were guilty of
[1:18:11] all of
[1:18:14] it I was a sinner just like you are a
[1:18:17] sinner right if I have got what I
[1:18:20] deserved I'd have went to
[1:18:21] hell and and I didn't you know May and I
[1:18:25] you know I've served the Lord since I
[1:18:26] was a very young boy so I certainly
[1:18:28] didn't get into a lot of you know
[1:18:30] horrible
[1:18:35] sins but that don't make a
[1:18:38] difference every one of us has to have a
[1:18:42] token because every one of us you know
[1:18:45] are in that place look all deserve
[1:18:50] punishment I want that to be clear all
[1:18:52] all deserved punishment Israelites
[1:18:57] foreigners Egyptians everybody in Egypt
[1:19:00] deserve
[1:19:02] punishment and death was on the way and
[1:19:06] a representative of every house of
[1:19:09] firstborn of every home in the nation
[1:19:12] would die in that home it didn't matter
[1:19:15] if it was an Egyptian or an Israelite
[1:19:18] none words
[1:19:21] exempt every place had to have death in
[1:19:26] it it was under judgment death will be
[1:19:29] in Egypt from the Prest house to
[1:19:32] Pharaoh's Palace there will be death and
[1:19:35] Goan in every Israelite
[1:19:38] dwelling and there too the firstborn
[1:19:41] will
[1:19:42] die I want you to understand every one
[1:19:46] of us without
[1:19:48] exemption have been under the sentence
[1:19:51] of death that's right that's
[1:19:54] right all the way back from Eden the day
[1:19:56] you eat thereof that day you
[1:20:01] die but you see in that moment of time
[1:20:04] there was not just a message that death
[1:20:06] was coming but there was also a message
[1:20:10] of
[1:20:11] Grace that favor was also of all the
[1:20:15] people who would hear a message that
[1:20:18] would be brought by a pillar of fire to
[1:20:20] a prophet and here he would come out of
[1:20:23] the Wilderness with a message from God
[1:20:26] and saying listen the death is coming it
[1:20:29] is a judgment is on the line judgment is
[1:20:32] everywhere but I tell you what and we're
[1:20:35] we're all under that message of judgment
[1:20:37] but I tell you God has a covenant with
[1:20:40] you amen and in that Covenant God has
[1:20:44] provided a substitute a firstborn lamb
[1:20:48] without
[1:20:50] blemish and he will die
[1:20:53] in your
[1:20:56] house and there will be a death take
[1:20:58] place in your house and with that death
[1:21:03] there will come an Escape
[1:21:06] right that's right the Wrath that you
[1:21:11] deserved would be poured out on the lamb
[1:21:15] and the lamb would die in your
[1:21:19] place thank you
[1:21:21] Jesus
[1:21:26] a firstborn lamb without
[1:21:28] blemish its blood would be a token a
[1:21:32] sign a sign on the door on the
[1:21:37] lentil a sign on the sides this sign
[1:21:41] would be would show that a firstborn the
[1:21:44] lamb had been accepted as a
[1:21:46] substitutionary death and his blood has
[1:21:50] been
[1:21:51] applied and now displayed and this is
[1:21:54] what we're seeing here the displaying of
[1:21:56] the blood on the
[1:22:03] door and this would show it would be a
[1:22:05] sign that the death angel would pass
[1:22:08] over here because there's this sign
[1:22:10] shows the first born's already
[1:22:14] dead are you with me amen now there were
[1:22:18] to be seven days of unleavened bread
[1:22:21] which would represent seven Church ages
[1:22:24] where nothing but pure unadulterated
[1:22:27] word was to be eaten the seventh day
[1:22:30] would of that Feast would be a feast to
[1:22:33] the Lord of unleavened bread and we come
[1:22:36] to Zero
[1:22:38] Hour and we are like Israel in that same
[1:22:42] time as like Israel when they were
[1:22:44] leaving Egypt and the Death Angel is
[1:22:47] going through the land and let me just
[1:22:49] say again in America our freedoms are
[1:22:52] dying
[1:22:54] people are dying
[1:22:55] spiritually families are dying churches
[1:22:59] are dying and I I tell you you can see
[1:23:02] the effect of it that is happening
[1:23:05] everywhere that you
[1:23:07] look you can see death happening in the
[1:23:10] families Death happen in fathers death
[1:23:13] happening in mothers Parenthood there's
[1:23:16] death in it motherhood there's death in
[1:23:20] it in our school RS of learning death in
[1:23:25] it we have a whole leftist agenda that
[1:23:28] is there being pumped out and a whole
[1:23:31] generation of people filled with
[1:23:35] death our values are gone families are
[1:23:38] dying churches are going dying there's
[1:23:41] hardly a there's hardly a thing that is
[1:23:44] happening you know it's more and more
[1:23:47] and more going more secular toward just
[1:23:51] dead religion
[1:23:53] that's right cycle of Revival and death
[1:23:56] never fails yeah I'm trying to PL paint
[1:23:59] a bleak picture because that's what it
[1:24:01] is I'm trying to get you to see we ain't
[1:24:04] in haha
[1:24:05] land this is not a time of of of to be
[1:24:10] frivolous and you know just having a
[1:24:12] bunch of gity this is a time of really

[1:24:33] the blood the Life of Christ the very
[1:24:35] life of Jesus the Holy Ghost
[1:24:40] applied so you see he would tell them
[1:24:44] you will eat it as a people prepared to
[1:24:50] leave let that sink in for me a moment a
[1:24:53] people

[1:26:25] God's doing something among his people
[1:26:28] amen and and so therefore let's get
[1:26:31] ready to leave for I will pass through
[1:26:34] the land of Egypt this night and I will
[1:26:36] Smite all the firstborn in the land of
[1:26:38] Egypt both man and Beast and against all
[1:26:41] the gods of Egypt I will execute
[1:26:44] judgment I am the
[1:26:46] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a
[1:26:49] token that's a sign a up on the houses
[1:26:53] where you are and when I see the blood I
[1:26:57] will pass over you and the plague shall
[1:26:59] not be upon you to destroy you when I
[1:27:02] smite the land of Egypt now listen it's
[1:27:05] not going to do any good to have that
[1:27:09] blood sitting in a bucket in the
[1:27:15] house it's not going to do you any good
[1:27:18] to have a
[1:27:19] collection of 1100 k
[1:27:23] and Bible's in every translation
[1:27:26] imaginable none of that's going to
[1:27:29] work what he says I've got to see the
[1:27:33] blood I got to see that the a lamb died
[1:27:37] for you or otherwise death is coming
[1:27:41] here and death is coming on churches
[1:27:44] death is coming on homes death is coming
[1:27:47] on individuals
[1:27:51] sir we're in that
[1:27:54] hour but in that hour there's a people
[1:27:57] going to escape
[1:28:00] death The Pale Horse is about to be
[1:28:03] released for his ride and if you know
[1:28:05] anything about the horse riders of the
[1:28:08] Book of Revelation you know it starts
[1:28:09] out as a white horse and then it becomes
[1:28:12] red it's same horse same Beast same
[1:28:14] power same Antichrist and he finally you
[1:28:18] know it morphs as it was and changes red
[1:28:20] with the blood of the Saints as it kills
[1:28:22] and then the Dark Ages it becomes dark
[1:28:25] and black and then the finally it goes
[1:28:27] into the pale but this Mars from one to
[1:28:31] the other and I want to say it's more
[1:28:35] gradual than
[1:28:41] instant the first splashes of the red
[1:28:44] blood of the Saints turning that bloody
[1:28:47] red would may maybe still had Part White
[1:28:54] further it went it's all
[1:28:56] red right then it starts turning
[1:29:00] dark and it goes in from dark red into
[1:29:04] black into total
[1:29:06] darkness and then we're moving now from
[1:29:09] that and you can see the pale begin to
[1:29:12] mix right in and the Bible said his name
[1:29:15] is
[1:29:17] death so if I'm not right if you don't
[1:29:19] think I'm right this is the Bible the
[1:29:21] Bible said in the Book of Revelation
[1:29:24] that he's coming and his name is death
[1:29:29] right well it was death all the way in
[1:29:31] the first age when it was a white horse
[1:29:34] it was come on it was the Antichrist it
[1:29:36] was death then it was death and there
[1:29:39] but now he's coming in his full
[1:29:42] power and the Bible said hell follows
[1:29:45] him and I'll tell you what if you want
[1:29:48] to stick around here for hell you can
[1:29:50] but I don't want to to do that
[1:29:55] Hallelujah and I'll tell you this the
[1:29:57] fourth horse rider cannot go
[1:29:59] incompletely he cannot turn totally pale
[1:30:02] until the bride leaves but we're so
[1:30:07] close you talk about the lamb that rose
[1:30:11] up in Revelation 13 with freedom of
[1:30:13] religion with civil and ecclesiastical
[1:30:15] Powers he looked like a lamb but in the
[1:30:17] end he started speaking like a
[1:30:19] dragon and we're hearing him more more
[1:30:22] speak like the dragon Satan
[1:30:28] himself this is where we are that's
[1:30:31] right we're in that
[1:30:33] hour look at you know we we can we can
[1:30:37] hear him
[1:30:39] coming and man we we hear coming we see
[1:30:42] the precursor of at the forerunning as
[1:30:45] as the Winds of War and strife are
[1:30:47] already
[1:30:50] blowing we look at Israel now we see
[1:30:53] them there having to cope with the most
[1:30:57] evil murderous Spirits killing young and
[1:31:01] old ripping open bellies of pregnant
[1:31:04] women taking infants and putting them in
[1:31:06] the oven hideous heinous crimes hate
[1:31:11] like you've never SE it is not just a
[1:31:13] war it's a spiritual
[1:31:18] war I I hope you hear what I'm saying
[1:31:20] because right now even against you it's
[1:31:23] a spiritual war and it's a it's a the
[1:31:26] devil hates
[1:31:28] you and he's pouring out his Venom
[1:31:31] everywhere that he can amen and there he
[1:31:34] comes to Rob and to kill and
[1:31:37] destroy your life your home your
[1:31:40] marriage your everything your husband

[1:32:07] hurts the old people he don't care there
[1:32:10] there's there's no mercy with him
[1:32:19] that's the spirit of the world hates

[1:32:53] there to find some way some
[1:32:56] justification to kill

[1:34:55] was an agricultural land and their diet
[1:34:57] according to numbers 115 was mostly fish
[1:34:59] and cucumbers melons leaks and onions
[1:35:02] and
[1:35:04] garlic some say sheep were detestable to

[1:36:07] desert heat you know and pure linen is
[1:36:10] also has a quality of being odor
[1:36:14] resistant but Shepherds were low class
[1:36:16] of
[1:36:17] people they were not rich enough to
[1:36:19] afford linen but certainly had access to
[1:36:23] animal skins which to make their
[1:36:25] clothes so wool and other animal skins
[1:36:28] were the most popular materials from the
[1:36:31] for of them who would come from Canaan

[1:36:35] class they wor like the low class

[1:36:47] unclean I want you to get it I want you
[1:36:50] to see there there was a class
[1:36:53] difference there was different emphasis
[1:36:57] on dress and how that they did homes of
[1:37:00] middle class Egyptians were kept to a
[1:37:02] high standard to an Egyptian Lamb's
[1:37:06] blood on a door was an would make it an
[1:37:08] unclean
[1:37:11] dwelling Lamb's Lamb's offer to God was
[1:37:14] a high offense and this is why Moses
[1:37:17] said let us leave it and go to the
[1:37:19] Wilderness for our sacrifices on our
[1:37:21] Abomination to the Egyptian the very
[1:37:23] thing you are offering to God our people

[1:38:03] here for but for a moment but for you to
[1:38:05] understand I mean I I raised animals
[1:38:07] butcher many of them but they would take
[1:38:10] and just stroke that animal there find
[1:38:12] this little juggler there and quickly
[1:38:14] take a knife and it would begin to spurt
[1:38:16] out blood with awe every heartbeat and
[1:38:19] you can't do that without getting blood
[1:38:21] on
[1:38:23] you and I just want to tell you if you
[1:38:26] ever get in a church where the blood is
[1:38:29] Flowing where the holy spirit is moving
[1:38:32] and you really are a worshipper you
[1:38:35] can't help it but get spirit all over
[1:38:38] you and the world hates it but God loves
[1:38:46] it you get so bloody listen that's the
[1:38:49] way that an eagle is he is a ripper of
[1:38:52] the beat amen a a real a real Eagle can
[1:38:56] be forced not to eat carrying but he
[1:38:58] will eat the Al and when he rips with
[1:39:01] the beak the blood flows he gets blood
[1:39:04] all over his head he gets blood all over
[1:39:06] his body amen but it shows he has been
[1:39:09] eating live food and I tell you we got a
[1:39:13] Living Word and when an eagle begins to
[1:39:16] eat on it all the life of that gets all
[1:39:19] over
[1:39:20] you
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:28] Hallelujah you got Lamb's blood on your
[1:39:32] clothes and you apply it and I'm going
[1:39:36] to say and we're going to we're going to
[1:39:38] take this to a spiritual turn for a
[1:39:40] moment cuz we're talking about the blood
[1:39:42] of Christ which is the Holy
[1:39:45] Ghost understand we don't have a vial of
[1:39:49] blood we we don't have a cup of his
[1:39:52] blood so how are you going to be how are
[1:39:55] you going to be cleansed by the blood
[1:39:57] well you see at Calvary when his blood
[1:40:00] flowed the the blood cell broke open
[1:40:03] releasing the life of God it came back
[1:40:05] on the day of Pentecost that the holy
[1:40:08] spirit so you know today when we say
[1:40:12] when I see the blood we're talking about
[1:40:14] when I see the Holy Ghost when I see the
[1:40:17] spirit Jesus God said I'll pass over you
[1:40:21] this is how the death angel will will
[1:40:23] pass over you cuz I see the spirit I see
[1:40:26] there the death of the Lamb has brought
[1:40:29] his life upon you and that's the sign
[1:40:32] amen that something died
[1:40:35] here and paid the penalty for your
[1:40:43] sin so you apply Lamb's blood on your
[1:40:45] clothes on your house on your body on
[1:40:47] your spirit and on your
[1:40:49] soul
[1:40:53] in
[1:40:57] fact you're
[1:41:06] God the one the world
[1:41:09] detests is the great Shepherd
[1:41:13] himself and you are the Sheep of his
[1:41:17] fold and the world hates you
[1:41:23] you are in Passover from the moment you
[1:41:25] get the Holy
[1:41:28] Ghost the blood applied with his three
[1:41:31] stripes upon your body three places your
[1:41:35] body your spirit your soul every bit of
[1:41:39] that the blood has to be applied that's
[1:41:42] in three places that is the Gateway into
[1:41:45] the body through the body through the
[1:41:47] body comes the the the senses the the
[1:41:50] gate
[1:41:51] the doors which is see taste smell
[1:41:54] feeling here that's how you contact this
[1:41:57] body through the gates of your senses
[1:42:00] the inner sense which is which is on the
[1:42:03] inside of that we is this human Spirit
[1:42:06] and the human spirit is the intellect so
[1:42:09] there's there is memory imagination
[1:42:12] reasoning conscience and
[1:42:14] affections and all of those are are
[1:42:17] Gates now into the spirit that's why you
[1:42:20] got to be careful what you feed
[1:42:23] on Amen you know and even with what what
[1:42:26] you look at with your eye that no evil
[1:42:29] thing before you this is why why we get
[1:42:32] rid of
[1:42:33] Television that's why many of you needs
[1:42:36] to it needs to really apply the token
[1:42:38] the blood to your
[1:42:41] internet amen why because you see from
[1:42:49] there
[1:42:52] I talked to a dear young
[1:42:57] girl the first
[1:42:59] one the first one now we we had evil
[1:43:02] spirits cast out before but this is the
[1:43:04] first one that was so
[1:43:08] demonstrative came up into the meeting
[1:43:11] and as I anointed her with
[1:43:14] oil she changed to a grotesque creature
[1:43:19] crouching down with the aest look on her
[1:43:22] face swinging her hands and saying I
[1:43:26] won't come out I won't come
[1:43:34] out tried to strike me I get just feel
[1:43:38] like brush of wind come by
[1:43:41] me but she could never touch
[1:43:47] me and that prayer line that demon was
[1:43:50] was cast
[1:43:51] out I talked to her the next day I
[1:43:54] said where did this come
[1:43:57] in you know this just seemed like a
[1:44:00] little innocent girl an innocent
[1:44:02] teenager raised up in a Christian home
[1:44:05] come from a good message
[1:44:06] Church you know that with with great
[1:44:11] preachers and
[1:44:13] she
[1:44:15] said it was not something I physically
[1:44:19] did it was things that I was looking
[1:44:23] at they came into the eye
[1:44:27] gate into the realm of the
[1:44:32] mind and now took over her until she was
[1:44:39] possessed oh she ate lunch just like
[1:44:42] everybody else she had breakfast while
[1:44:44] like everybody else she did things like
[1:44:47] another normal teenager but something
[1:44:50] was is on the inside of her controlling
[1:44:57] her that's why the blood has to be
[1:45:02] applied the Holy Spirit applied to what
[1:45:07] you look at what you listen to that's
[1:45:10] why you don't want to just go and listen
[1:45:11] to the gossip of
[1:45:13] unbelief because Spirits travel on
[1:45:18] words come on now and you you are you
[1:45:22] are we are right now in Passover from
[1:45:24] the moment you get the Holy Ghost you
[1:45:27] are in Passover the blood is applied
[1:45:29] with three stripes on your body your
[1:45:31] spirit and soul the Bible said they
[1:45:33] shall take the blood strike it on the
[1:45:35] two side post and the upper
[1:45:39] doorpost now so it must be applied to
[1:45:41] three places let's look at it 1
[1:45:43] Thessalonians 5:23 and I pray God your
[1:45:46] whole Spirit soul and body be preserved
[1:45:49] blameless unto the coming of our Lord
[1:45:52] Jesus Christ so here's how it's
[1:45:55] preserved blameless you get the blood on
[1:46:01] it
[1:46:03] now without the sign displayed on your
[1:46:06] door now what sign that the life of
[1:46:09] Jesus is applied to the body spirit and
[1:46:12] soul notice the Holy Ghost is the sign
[1:46:17] that God requires he he's not looking
[1:46:19] for your how great you speak in tongues
[1:46:22] and how often you speak in tongues and
[1:46:23] how much you dancing the floors not
[1:46:26] looking for you know uh giving your body
[1:46:30] to be burned or knowing all the mystery
[1:46:32] he looking for his
[1:46:36] life so the question comes is the Holy
[1:46:39] Ghost on your soul has it changed your
[1:46:43] nature you know you might have put it on
[1:46:46] your body and you danced down the aisle
[1:46:48] but did it get beyond the body into the
[1:46:50] SP Spirit real and cleanse your spirit
[1:46:52] did it go from there into the soul and
[1:46:54] put God's nature and seal you to the day
[1:46:57] of
[1:47:00] redemption you see the Holy Ghost is a
[1:47:03] sign that God
[1:47:05] requires is the Holy Ghost on your soul
[1:47:09] as it change your nature that's what we
[1:47:12] want it doesn't matter how much you
[1:47:14] prophesy and it was right how much you
[1:47:17] spoke in tongues and they were genuine
[1:47:20] how much you danced and it was really
[1:47:22] the spirit that moved on you or how much
[1:47:26] your dress is Holy and there is nothing
[1:47:29] anybody could say about the way you
[1:47:37] dress what he's looking for is the Holy
[1:47:45] Ghost
[1:47:48] now is it keeping your human Spirit
[1:47:51] under control some of you listen some of
[1:47:54] you don't haven't even had the Holy
[1:47:55] Ghost on your spirit on your human
[1:47:59] spirit it's not even got that far it it
[1:48:02] hadn't ever went past you know it got
[1:48:04] into your ear and you know maybe in your
[1:48:06] intellect a little bit but it didn't go
[1:48:08] any further you know is it keeping it
[1:48:10] under control what about your
[1:48:14] temper your affections your desires what
[1:48:18] are they set on does it keep you from

[1:48:24] pornography does it keep you you know
[1:48:27] are your are your affections set on
[1:48:29] things above that's right that's what
[1:48:31] you want to ask you know are your
[1:48:33] affections where are my affections where
[1:48:35] where is my heart what are my
[1:48:41] treasures what is it that I

[1:55:58] know you know that they think I don't
[1:56:00] really care what the Egyptians
[1:56:03] think when when I went to Israel here
[1:56:06] some years ago you know we were getting
[1:56:08] on the plane and I looked and there's
[1:56:10] all these funny people you know with
[1:56:12] their prayer deals and their prayer
[1:56:14] Shaws and their hats and their their
[1:56:16] habits and and and all of the stuff that
[1:56:19] they had and I looked at you know
[1:56:22] these I'm I'm riding to Israel with
[1:56:25] these they they're pretty strange
[1:56:28] looking
[1:56:29] people they had their you know and they
[1:56:32] they're Orthodox with their ringlets and
[1:56:34] whatever
[1:56:35] and
[1:56:38] and I I'm looking at them we're getting
[1:56:41] on the
[1:56:43] plane you
[1:56:45] know I get to
[1:56:48] Israel and when I get in Israel ain't
[1:56:51] none of them look
[1:56:52] strange they look like they belong
[1:56:56] there this way they this is what this is
[1:56:59] what they look like they they were
[1:57:02] dressed like the place they were
[1:57:05] from amen we have a citizenship of
[1:57:09] heaven we are to reflect
[1:57:12] [Applause]
[1:57:13] Heaven come on we're not to change to be
[1:57:16] like the world we are the representative
[1:57:19] heaven we dress like this because we are
[1:57:22] of heaven we live like this because we
[1:57:25] are of
[1:57:26] [Applause]
[1:57:27] Heaven go ahead and worship your cats if
[1:57:30] you want
[1:57:32] them I worship the
[1:57:36] lamb now you know so is brother Brandon
[1:57:39] said a little Acts 2 and four it washes
[1:57:41] you up you won't be made up the look
[1:57:44] glamorous in the eyes of the world Satan
[1:57:46] is the author of that kind of beauty
[1:57:48] Acts 2 and4 will put some cosmetic on
[1:57:50] you that Max Factor knows nothing about
[1:57:53] see their faces all live lit up but the
[1:57:55] glory of God is an eternal beauty that
[1:57:58] won't fade away it's a meek and quiet
[1:58:01] Spirit that's acceptable to the
[1:58:04] Lord ma Max Factor was one who you know
[1:58:09] learned how and invented makeup in these
[1:58:12] modern
[1:58:13] times you know because he took and first
[1:58:16] did it for onscreen people to make up
[1:58:19] under the lights and whatever but he he
[1:58:22] take took and began to make products so
[1:58:24] women could look glamorous all the
[1:58:29] time and so he said now it ain't pain
[1:58:32] and scissors that cut your hair that
[1:58:35] bothers you it's that spirit in you that
[1:58:38] makes you want to go get it that's what
[1:58:40] it is Max Factor could make all of it he
[1:58:42] wanted to and laid over there and if you
[1:58:44] was a Christian you'd never touch it I
[1:58:48] mean if you were baptized with the Holy
[1:58:49] Ghost and living where you ought to live
[1:58:51] and your pastor preached the truth and
[1:58:53] let you know about it you wouldn't even
[1:58:55] care a
[1:58:58] bit I'm thankful I preach to a church
[1:59:00] that most of them are like that I don't
[1:59:02] have to even speak about these things
[1:59:04] very often why because they're living
[1:59:06] such a life beyond
[1:59:08] that but I'm just telling you
[1:59:15] peanuts you don't have time for it we're
[1:59:19] to be eating the Passover with haste
[1:59:21] getting rid of the leaven in the first
[1:59:24] Exodus there was a physical display of
[1:59:26] the blood that a lamb without blemish
[1:59:29] died brother Bram tells us in the
[1:59:32] message token that he said but in this
[1:59:34] glorious place under this Covenant there
[1:59:36] is a difference between the blood and
[1:59:38] the life so we don't have a physical
[1:59:39] paint we have the life that was in the
[1:59:42] blood the token for the believer today
[1:59:45] is the Holy Ghost not a blood of
[1:59:47] chemistry but it is the holy spirit of
[1:59:49] God that is the token that God requires
[1:59:53] of the church today God must see this
[1:59:55] token he must see it in every one of us
[1:59:59] so God must see the Holy Ghost today
[2:00:03] even as he had to see the blood in that
[2:00:06] day he must see the blood for the death
[2:00:10] angel to pass you know why because the
[2:00:13] evening Shadows are
[2:00:15] appearing the Wrath is about ready to be
[2:00:18] poured out from on high
[2:00:20] upon ungodly
[2:00:22] Nations you know upon ungodly
[2:00:25] Believers upon professors without a
[2:00:29] possession you see and and so you know
[2:00:33] we are living with the shadows and the
[2:00:36] Wrath is ready to strike and God In This
[2:00:38] Moment is requiring a token that you
[2:00:42] yourself have received his token the
[2:00:45] Holy Ghost and it's the only way and the
[2:00:48] only sign that God will ever pass
[2:00:50] because it is a literal life of Jesus
[2:00:53] Christ returned back to the believer
[2:00:56] God's life his Spirit his literal life
[2:01:00] must be on display on your job at
[2:01:05] school at home yes
[2:01:09] listen if it doesn't live at home it
[2:01:12] ain't worth
[2:01:18] nothing
[2:01:20] Christianity has to display its
[2:01:23] token publicly in your public life at at
[2:01:27] your office on the street with troubles
[2:01:30] around in the church and of course most
[2:01:33] definitely at home you know the blood is
[2:01:36] the token and the token must be applied
[2:01:39] you know because without it the coven is
[2:01:42] not in effect This Promise of a Rapture
[2:01:46] has no meaning to you this promise to
[2:01:49] escape the tribulation is not even
[2:01:51] applicable to you without the
[2:01:55] token you can talk about it say well
[2:01:58] I'll tell you what I can't wait for the
[2:02:00] Lord to come I've seen him do it oh
[2:02:02] brother Tim I as he draws on his
[2:02:05] cigarette and he's lit one off of that
[2:02:07] one smokes another said I'm convinced of
[2:02:09] my salvation I know I believed on the
[2:02:12] Lord Jesus Christ and and I am a
[2:02:16] Christian I know right now you know if
[2:02:19] if the trumpet would sound I'm ready to
[2:02:21] go as he drew on his
[2:02:25] cigarette but no matter how much you say
[2:02:28] you
[2:02:29] believed how much without the token
[2:02:33] without the Holy Ghost it's all for
[2:02:39] nothing now you're when you receive the
[2:02:43] Holy Spirit you're
[2:02:46] absolutely so different from anything
[2:02:48] thing the world ever
[2:02:50] saw you know you're you're a creature of
[2:02:54] a new creation with a new
[2:02:58] identity are you with me amen Jesus was
[2:03:01] the first of this new
[2:03:04] creation and he was so different from
[2:03:06] the rest of the world hated him
[2:03:08] religious people hated him everything
[2:03:10] hated him crucified him is that right
[2:03:14] yes amen but with with his death he
[2:03:17] brought forth many brethren
[2:03:19] and on the day of Pentecost I'll tell
[2:03:21] you what that's when the that's when
[2:03:24] Satan went into a nervous
[2:03:27] panic when he saw not just one Jesus but
[2:03:31] 120 born of the same spirit that was out
[2:03:34] the same species come out of the upper
[2:03:37] room speaking in Heavenly
[2:03:40] languages oh yeah come on impowered by
[2:03:43] the Holy Ghost are you with me amen and
[2:03:47] what was that that was the first of a
[2:03:49] new race and everyone that is born of
[2:03:52] that is a brand new species you are not
[2:03:56] of the old creation you are of the new
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:04] creation put up put up Galatians 2:20 I
[2:04:07] want you to see this and let me just
[2:04:09] paraphrase it as we do the old man is
[2:04:12] dead yes yet I'm living and again it's
[2:04:16] not me but Christ is living in me and
[2:04:19] the life that I live by the flesh that I
[2:04:23] live by the In the Flesh I live by the
[2:04:26] faith of the Son of God so look what he
[2:04:29] says the life I now live that old life
[2:04:33] is dead I'm crucified with Christ we're
[2:04:38] going to we're going to dwell on that
[2:04:39] for a moment
[2:04:42] crucified with
[2:04:44] Christ now so you see here he says I
[2:04:48] it's not me anymore but it's Christ
[2:04:50] Living in me it's the identified token
[2:04:53] that God requires you know that
[2:04:55] identified that we're identified with
[2:04:57] our sacrifice the life of Jesus Christ
[2:05:01] Our Savior so it's a Holy Ghost is our
[2:05:04] identification it identifies
[2:05:07] our our us as Christians now it's not
[2:05:11] our membership in church you can belong
[2:05:14] you can go belong to this church all you
[2:05:15] want to that's right
[2:05:19] going into a a barn don't make you a
[2:05:23] horse coming to a church does not make
[2:05:25] you a Christian right so I would like to
[2:05:28] get get them in church I I really don't
[2:05:30] want them in church I want them in
[2:05:37] Christ now I do believe that church
[2:05:39] ought to be a gateway to to show them
[2:05:42] Christ where they can get in the
[2:05:44] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost I get that
[2:05:46] but really I'm not wanting members
[2:05:49] what we want to see is bonafied Born
[2:05:52] Again Sons and Daughters of God Blood
[2:05:55] Washed Church who knows who they are who
[2:05:58] lives by faith the what faith God's
[2:06:02] faith a living faith because a living
[2:06:06] Christ is on the inside of them it's not
[2:06:08] how much you know about the author it's
[2:06:10] how much is the author living in you you
[2:06:13] reckon yourself dead and the token is
[2:06:16] what lives in you it's not your life
[2:06:17] it's him
[2:06:19] so we're in a cycle of
[2:06:21] time a new cycle of
[2:06:24] time I'll explain yourself him well it's
[2:06:27] the time of the Holy Ghost it's the time
[2:06:31] that the literal life of Jesus Christ
[2:06:34] must be there
[2:06:36] am well hasn't that always been the case
[2:06:39] no in the type that
[2:06:42] were different aspects of the whole
[2:06:46] process now you bear with me just for a
[2:06:48] moment
[2:06:50] the first step a firstborn lamb without
[2:06:53] blemish was to be chosen and kept up
[2:06:55] from the 10th day of the month
[2:06:58] Abid until the 14th day of the
[2:07:02] month so now from the 14th or the from
[2:07:05] the 10th to the
[2:07:07] 14th that would that would be the the
[2:07:10] first lamb the firstborn lamb without
[2:07:13] blemish was chosen and kept up examine
[2:07:17] made sure he was without blemish
[2:07:19] cuz he's got to be an acceptable
[2:07:21] lamb now that was Luther's
[2:07:25] day what a great message you know there
[2:07:28] there was five days of celebrating the
[2:07:31] lamb we we have found the lamb the one
[2:07:34] that die in our place he's without
[2:07:37] blemish and and we're not without
[2:07:40] blemish but our lamb is without
[2:07:43] blemish now remember again let me just
[2:07:46] go over it I want you to get
[2:07:50] it they
[2:07:54] looked for a lamb without
[2:07:59] blemish not a worshipper without
[2:08:06] blemish and when the lamb was brought
[2:08:08] before the priest for the sacrifice
[2:08:11] never was it that he would look at the
[2:08:14] worshipper and say is he without
[2:08:16] blemish is there in him is his nose
[2:08:21] crooked does one finger Bend
[2:08:24] out is he crippled is he lame is he halt
[2:08:27] is he
[2:08:29] blind you see it had to be an acceptable
[2:08:32] sacrifice but he wasn't looking at the
[2:08:34] worshipper
[2:08:36] than he was looking at the
[2:08:39] lamb and that's the way it is with you
[2:08:41] we're not looking at you the worshipper
[2:08:46] you're a sinner that's what you were a
[2:08:50] sinner you did wrong you were you were
[2:08:53] blemished that's right you were damaged
[2:08:56] goods you are
[2:08:59] awful you had sinned you were worthy of
[2:09:02] death but what happens when you take the
[2:09:05] lamb without blemish you place your
[2:09:08] hands on the lamb and what happen it
[2:09:13] transfers your sins to the lamb and the
[2:09:17] lamb dies for your
[2:09:19] sins that's all we're trying to get you
[2:09:22] to do is to recognize that your lamb is
[2:09:26] without blemish and lay your hands on
[2:09:29] the
[2:09:30] lamb and transform transfer your sins on
[2:09:35] the lamb now the problem with that blood
[2:09:39] is that the Lamb's righteousness or
[2:09:42] without blemish could not pass back on
[2:09:45] the
[2:09:46] worshipper but in this Covenant it is
[2:09:48] different in this lamb when you lay your
[2:09:51] hands on Jesus Christ and accept his
[2:09:54] dying and death in your place it
[2:09:58] transfers your sins onto him and his
[2:10:01] righteousness Onto You Yes hallu
[2:10:05] Hallelujah so that you become the
[2:10:07] righteousness of Jesus
[2:10:10] [Applause]
[2:10:15] Christ now that won't make you want to
[2:10:17] speak in tongues I don't know what
[2:10:18] would I could I could speak in tongues
[2:10:21] in every language right now over
[2:10:25] that so
[2:10:28] therefore you see from the 10th to the
[2:10:33] 14th was when this lamb was taken a 10th
[2:10:37] day the lamb chosen 11th day they
[2:10:40] celebrated the
[2:10:41] lamb oh he was a perfect savior he went
[2:10:44] to the Cross he paid the price look what
[2:10:48] he did 12th Day celebrating the lamb
[2:10:52] 13th Day celebrating the lamb but at
[2:10:56] evening
[2:10:57] time on the 14th day of the month the
[2:11:01] lamb is slain and it's blood
[2:11:05] applied get this watch the type the
[2:11:10] blood the token has to be applied in the
[2:11:13] evening time it is no longer just
[2:11:17] talking about the worthy
[2:11:19] lamb what he did at Calvary how he died
[2:11:22] on the cross you hear him preaching
[2:11:24] today it's the cross it's the cross sure
[2:11:26] it's the cross sure sure he was a
[2:11:29] righteous lamb you know all of that is
[2:11:32] true but if that's as far as you go the
[2:11:35] death angel still gets you to have your
[2:11:38] lamb kept up is not going to save you
[2:11:40] from the death
[2:11:44] angel the blood has to be on display
[2:11:47] that's right
[2:11:49] now brother bam tells us the token never
[2:11:51] came into existence until the evening
[2:11:53] time and this is the evening time of the
[2:11:55] age we live in this evening time for the
[2:11:57] church this is the evening time for me
[2:11:59] it's the evening time of my message I'm
[2:12:01] dying I'm going I'm moving out in the
[2:12:02] evening time of the Gospel we've been to
[2:12:04] up come up through justification and so
[2:12:06] forth but this is the time the token
[2:12:08] must be
[2:12:10] applied so now the message
[2:12:13] changes it's no longer just about
[2:12:16] celebrating the chosen sacrific the
[2:12:20] cross and how he died for me but the
[2:12:24] evening time message is to apply the
[2:12:29] token the Lamb's blood must be
[2:12:34] applied the blood's been applied the
[2:12:37] token of life that was in the blood is
[2:12:39] upon you and you're safe from wrath see
[2:12:41] the hour is here with the token himself
[2:12:43] is identifying himself right Among Us
[2:12:47] and proving he's the same Jesus
[2:12:48] yesterday today and forever and he's
[2:12:50] right with the word and it's got to be
[2:12:52] applied and a man that says he's got the
[2:12:54] token deny this word and what about it
[2:12:56] you can't do it the token has got to be
[2:12:59] there and when the blood was shed the
[2:13:01] token was sent down on the day of
[2:13:03] Pentecost it were like a rushing Mighty
[2:13:06] Wind now that was the theme of every
[2:13:10] Apostle amen have you received the Holy
[2:13:12] Ghost since you believe that should be
[2:13:14] the theme of the bride of Christ have
[2:13:17] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[2:13:18] believe you believe the message but have
[2:13:20] you receiv received the Holy Ghost since
[2:13:23] that's have you you know repent every
[2:13:26] one of you be baptized in the name of
[2:13:27] Jesus Christ for the remission of
[2:13:30] sin for it's a token that you pass from
[2:13:33] death into
[2:13:35] life when you receive the gift of the
[2:13:37] Holy
[2:13:38] Ghost is an hour the token must be
[2:13:42] displayed so does the message
[2:13:45] live that's the question is the Holy
[2:13:48] Ghost being applied there must be the
[2:13:51] dying of the
[2:13:52] Lamb I'm going to get this part if I
[2:13:54] don't get any other there must be the
[2:13:57] dying of the lamb but how different was
[2:14:01] that for with us this is much different
[2:14:05] today then the lamb died blood was
[2:14:08] applied but with us the old man has to
[2:14:13] die with our
[2:14:16] sacrifice understand Galatians 2:20 put
[2:14:20] it back up again I am crucified with
[2:14:25] Christ so it's not just the lamb dying
[2:14:28] but you are dying with your lamb I'm
[2:14:30] talking about your own
[2:14:31] man judgment has to come on
[2:14:35] it amen Jesus spoke of the brass serpent
[2:14:40] let's just take that type for a minute
[2:14:42] John 3:14 watch this Moses lifted up
[2:14:46] he's talking to Nicodemus about you must
[2:14:48] be born again as Moses lifted up the
[2:14:50] serpent in the wilderness John 3:14 and
[2:14:54] even so the son of man must be lifted up
[2:14:57] that whosoever believeth in him should
[2:14:59] not perish but have eternal life a't
[2:15:02] that strange put that first verse up ver
[2:15:04] 14 again Moses lifted up the serpent in
[2:15:09] the
[2:15:10] wilderness even so the son of man must
[2:15:14] be lifted up is't that
[2:15:16] strange that Jesus would liken his death
[2:15:21] his dying his offering to a
[2:15:28] serpent a
[2:15:31] snake why would he liken himself to the
[2:15:34] serpent that Moses lifted up for all to
[2:15:37] see as an
[2:15:39] atonement how in the world could Jesus
[2:15:43] be represented by a
[2:15:45] serpent notice the serpent
[2:15:48] represented
[2:15:51] sin and it being made of brass
[2:15:55] represented
[2:15:57] judgment so when lifting up the serpent
[2:16:00] it was showing sin has been judged
[2:16:04] yes now remember them in the wilderness
[2:16:07] they had been bitten of the serpent they
[2:16:08] had been bitten of sin and they had
[2:16:11] sinned against God and had was Dy a
[2:16:13] snake bite and the antidote was that to
[2:16:16] lift up a serpent a Brazen brass serpent
[2:16:20] showing their sin had been
[2:16:22] judged and anyone who would look on that
[2:16:27] would
[2:16:29] live amen somebody with me now Jesus was
[2:16:34] not sin we know that he was not sinful
[2:16:38] but he became our sin the Bible said he
[2:16:42] became our sins that we might become the
[2:16:46] righteousness of God in Christ so you
[2:16:50] see the the sacrificing of the lamb as
[2:16:54] the worshiper laid his hands upon
[2:16:56] transferred the wor worshippers sins on
[2:17:00] the lamb and died in his place the
[2:17:02] serpent was dead there was no life in it
[2:17:06] notice I want you to notice it was a
[2:17:09] crystallized Brazen serpent no life
[2:17:13] couldn't move couldn't breathe he was
[2:17:15] dead no life amen somebody with me amen
[2:17:19] when
[2:17:20] Jesus Jesus
[2:17:24] died and and
[2:17:26] there when he died let me just say it he
[2:17:30] died so dead everything said he was
[2:17:36] dead no life in
[2:17:39] him he died completely totally
[2:17:43] completely for
[2:17:45] you that when we put our hands on him by
[2:17:49] faith we transfer our sins to him and
[2:17:52] yes it's awful but let me tell you Jesus
[2:17:56] took our sins to hell and when he did he
[2:18:00] paid it
[2:18:02] all Hallelujah every sin ever ever sin
[2:18:06] of pornography fornication adultery
[2:18:09] drinking smoking whatever it is he took
[2:18:11] it to
[2:18:13] hell he paid the penalty are you with me
[2:18:17] but that's not all when we truly believe
[2:18:20] on him he not only takes our sins to
[2:18:23] hell but our own life our old sinful man
[2:18:27] is crucified with him and not only did
[2:18:31] he himself go to hell but he took you to
[2:18:34] hell with
[2:18:39] him every SE Gene of God come on with me

[2:18:59] been to Hell you have already conquered
[2:19:01] it you already raised up on it and
[2:19:03] that's why hell has no hold on you

[2:19:23] crucified with him and not only did he
[2:19:26] go to hell but he took you with
[2:19:30] him now go all the way back to Abel and
[2:19:34] the first offering of sacrifice Abel
[2:19:37] died on his altar with his
[2:19:43] lamb is that
[2:19:45] right and in order for you to B be born
[2:19:48] again you have to die on The Altar with
[2:19:51] your
[2:19:52] sacrifice you got to become just as dead
[2:19:54] as he was and you're born again the
[2:19:57] serpent had no life in and you have no
[2:19:59] life in you for you are dead and the and
[2:20:01] the Bible said and your life is hid in
[2:20:04] Christ through God so you cannot keep
[2:20:07] your Same Spirit you see this this is
[2:20:10] this is the problem you say what but
[2:20:13] brother Tim I've asked God for the Holy
[2:20:15] Ghost he's not going to come and give
[2:20:18] you the Holy Ghost as long as you got
[2:20:20] sin nature still living in you him
[2:20:23] listen you cannot have two Thrones on
[2:20:25] your or two two kings on your throne he
[2:20:29] will not sit there and and coign with
[2:20:32] Satan in your
[2:20:33] life and you were born with sin nature
[2:20:37] as the king of your life and that sin
[2:20:40] nature has to
[2:20:42] die and a new king come this is why
[2:20:46] people don't get born again it all goes
[2:20:48] back to repentance listen it would make
[2:20:51] God a liar if you repented and was
[2:20:55] baptized and in his name and didn't get
[2:20:58] the Holy Ghost it would make God a
[2:21:04] liar well I I tell you I asked God and
[2:21:08] I've asked
[2:21:10] God nothing's wrong with
[2:21:12] God nothing's wrong with the formulary
[2:21:15] it's the Divine vaccine
[2:21:17] it's Eternal prescription nothing's
[2:21:20] wrong with the medicine don't go and
[2:21:21] adjust it go back and look and see if
[2:21:25] you took it right there's directions on
[2:21:27] the Battle of Salvation that starts with
[2:21:32] repentance and repentance is dying from
[2:21:35] your
[2:21:36] sins come on now it's turning away you
[2:21:39] can't keep your same thoughts you got to
[2:21:43] die you got to die like he died you got
[2:21:46] to die on The Altar like Abel did with
[2:21:48] his lamb you got to die with your lamb
[2:21:50] you got to die to your thinking to be
[2:21:52] born to his thinking so that the mind of
[2:21:55] Christ can be in you you got to think
[2:21:58] God's
[2:22:01] thoughts how can you think his thoughts
[2:22:03] and deny his word how can you claim
[2:22:05] you're born
[2:22:06] again if you're born again you got his
[2:22:09] thoughts you got the mind of Christ in
[2:22:10] you you're a new creature you're new
[2:22:12] species
[2:22:15] amen amen
[2:22:18] the word creature in the Greek has
[2:22:20] translated a new creation If any man be
[2:22:24] in Christ he's a new creature he's of a
[2:22:27] new creation old things are passed away
[2:22:31] All Things become
[2:22:33] new now so think of that go back for a
[2:22:38] moment make sure I covered this

[2:25:21] out sin poured out upon him and as life
[2:25:25] would leave him and the wrath of God
[2:25:28] poured out upon him till the sun shut
[2:25:31] off off its light the moon refused to
[2:25:33] shine the Earth had a nervous breakdown
[2:25:36] would have bursted to pieces if there

[2:30:07] on
[2:30:08] you amen you you remember when Elijah
[2:30:12] challenged
[2:30:14] baale you remember that there was no
[2:30:19] answer to the to the gods of Baal or to
[2:30:23] the priest of Baal to their God there
[2:30:24] was no answer you see you see when the
[2:30:29] god of Elijah consumed the
[2:30:32] sacrifice are you with me and when you
[2:30:35] just accept a Creed it can be a message
[2:30:37] Creed or a form of baptism or you might
[2:30:40] have emotions where you get up shivering
[2:30:42] speaking in tongues and running all over
[2:30:44] the floor you get up weeping he but if
[2:30:46] that offering has been received by God
[2:30:49] and consumed and the world is dead to
[2:30:52] you your old life is dead and gone and
[2:30:55] where we recognize reckon ourselves dead
[2:30:58] and buried with him in
[2:31:02] baptism that's what baptism is for it is
[2:31:06] a sign it is a proclamation it is a
[2:31:09] testament that the old man is dead
[2:31:12] rotten and we're burying
[2:31:14] him that old s life is going under the
[2:31:18] watery
[2:31:19] grave but thanks be to God we don't
[2:31:21] leave them there we raise them up to
[2:31:24] walk in the newness of
[2:31:29] Life the Bible said in Colossians 3:3
[2:31:32] you are
[2:31:35] dead and your life is hid with Christ
[2:31:38] and
[2:31:39] God Romans 6 And1 what shall we say
[2:31:43] shall we continue in sin that Grace May
[2:31:45] abound that's
[2:31:48] disgrace that's what happens we turn the
[2:31:50] grace of God into lasciviousness or
[2:31:53] licens to sin God don't care what I
[2:31:57] do so when you turn the grace of God
[2:31:59] into lasciviousness that's that's a
[2:32:02] license to sin that's what the Bible's
[2:32:05] talking about you take God's favor and
[2:32:08] use it for license well God loves
[2:32:12] me yeah he
[2:32:15] does
[2:32:17] but the Rich Young Ruler he loved him
[2:32:21] and he went to
[2:32:22] hell I tell you what God loved you so
[2:32:25] much he provided a lamb but you can
[2:32:28] decide I don't want Lamb's blood you see
[2:32:31] I I I I don't want the the the Society
[2:32:34] of Egyptian to see that stinky blood on
[2:32:37] my door I don't want to live like that I
[2:32:40] don't want to life like that I don't
[2:32:42] want to dress like that I I I I'm I
[2:32:45] we're of the high society we're a better
[2:32:47] class Death Angel
[2:32:51] comes we're talking about salvation from
[2:32:53] the death
[2:32:55] angel listen church if the Holy Ghost is
[2:32:59] applied to marriage you're going to have
[2:33:00] a wonderful marriage if the Holy Ghost
[2:33:03] is applied to your children you're going
[2:33:04] to raise wonderful children if it's
[2:33:07] applied to your home you're going to see
[2:33:08] the fruits of it are you with me amen
[2:33:12] there's going to be things happen but
[2:33:13] watch now shall we what shall we say
[2:33:16] that shall we continue in sin that Grace
[2:33:18] May abound and he says a resounding God
[2:33:27] forbid how shall we that are dead to sin
[2:33:30] live any longer therein know you not
[2:33:33] that so many of us were baptized into
[2:33:35] Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[2:33:37] death this is the whole symbology of the
[2:33:40] whole thing therefore we are buried with
[2:33:42] him by baptism into death that like as
[2:33:44] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[2:33:46] the glory of the father even so we
[2:33:48] should walk in the newness of life for
[2:33:50] if we have been planted together in the
[2:33:52] likeness of his death we shall also we
[2:33:55] shall be also in the likeness of his
[2:33:57] resurrection knowing this that are old
[2:33:59] of
[2:34:00] man say it with me old man is
[2:34:05] crucified with him that the body of sin
[2:34:09] might need to be destroyed that from now
[2:34:11] on hence forth we should not serve sin
[2:34:16] for he that is dead is freed from
[2:34:20] sin and that was his whole point of the
[2:34:23] whole thing he said is a woman as long
[2:34:25] as her husband is living she'd be
[2:34:27] married to another man she she is an
[2:34:29] adulterous she's under the law of that
[2:34:31] husband so you had your first husband
[2:34:33] which was sin and you cannot be married
[2:34:36] to Christ cuz and I live with that old
[2:34:38] husband he's got to be
[2:34:43] dead and once he's dead you're free from
[2:34:46] that law and you're free to be married
[2:34:49] to another man this is the whole thing
[2:34:51] that he's talking about and teaching
[2:34:53] right here in order for you to be
[2:34:55] married to Christ the old man's got to
[2:34:57] be dead if you're going to come in Union
[2:35:00] with him the old life's got to be
[2:35:03] [Applause]
[2:35:05] past our souls are placed upon the brass
[2:35:08] altar of his Divine
[2:35:10] judgment what was the penalty when you
[2:35:13] lay yourself on the altar of God which
[2:35:15] is pronounced death upon the sinner how
[2:35:18] can you rise from their alive and sin if
[2:35:21] God's accepted the sacrifice you die
[2:35:24] you're consumed and you're as petrified
[2:35:27] as that brass Serpent and just like the
[2:35:29] brass serpent there's no more left to
[2:35:32] you but just this form you're standing
[2:35:35] here you're just like Christ when they
[2:35:38] took him cold and dead off the cross
[2:35:41] you're dead why because you're on God's
[2:35:44] altar of judgment that that's what the
[2:35:46] altar is for it's an altar of judgment
[2:35:49] to judge your
[2:35:51] sins take them and and there bring them
[2:35:55] there and the sacrifice received by fire
[2:35:58] and the smoke goes up and you rise with
[2:36:00] your sacrifice into the heavenlies and
[2:36:03] you're sealed away from the things of
[2:36:04] the world then what happens after you
[2:36:07] have
[2:36:09] died you're conceived a
[2:36:12] new he don't leave you
[2:36:14] dead you you're conceived a new and you
[2:36:18] were first conceived in iniquity and now
[2:36:20] you're conceived in the something new
[2:36:23] The Living Word and what does that mean
[2:36:26] you're are a new creature in a new
[2:36:29] creation for the old creation is passed
[2:36:32] away and All Things become new what is
[2:36:35] it the word becomes alive in you then
[2:36:39] and when you once couldn't see the
[2:36:40] things of God now you do amen and there
[2:36:44] that makes all the scriptures D tail
[2:36:46] together that makes all scriptures agree
[2:36:50] and and now you're dead to the old
[2:36:53] creature and the creation with all your
[2:36:55] old thoughts your desires dead and you
[2:36:58] conceived a new and wash by the washing
[2:37:02] of the water of the word so when you're
[2:37:06] conceived a
[2:37:08] new you're born like you when you were
[2:37:11] born of your Earthly parents in your
[2:37:13] first birth you had their nature
[2:37:16] natur but now that you're born again you
[2:37:20] have God's
[2:37:22] nature look back up here Galatians
[2:37:25] 2:20 and let's focus on
[2:37:28] this because now your new nature is to
[2:37:32] believe faith is your nature faith is
[2:37:36] your life Galatians 2:20 I am crucified
[2:37:39] with Christ nevertheless I
[2:37:41] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[2:37:45] and the life that I not live in the
[2:37:46] flesh I live by
[2:37:49] what the faith of the Son of God
[2:37:53] therefore I can believe for things I
[2:37:55] previously couldn't believe
[2:38:00] for because why the life I'm now living
[2:38:04] I once was this I once was dead but now
[2:38:09] I'm
[2:38:10] alive and because that I'm called to be
[2:38:13] his bride because everyone with the Holy

[2:40:00] play Let The Musicians come
[2:40:05] now this is a very serious
[2:40:09] hour very serious
[2:40:14] time
[2:40:18] so to day you make your call in election
[2:40:21] sure this is not a moment that I want to
[2:40:23] get every person down here to the altar
[2:40:25] I'm not even trying to do that that is
[2:40:28] not even something I
[2:40:33] want not my efforts
[2:40:38] today if you
[2:40:41] know in whom you have
[2:40:44] believed
[2:40:46] if you have experienced his holy spirit
[2:40:49] sure doubters will come the accuser of
[2:40:53] the brother lays everywhere to accuse
[2:40:56] you of the slightest
[2:40:59] thing always pointing fingers always
[2:41:02] pointing out your your your your human
[2:41:05] failures and
[2:41:09] flaws but if you're a real
[2:41:12] Christian the
[2:41:14] moment something wrong come you just
[2:41:17] take it and plunge it under the blood
[2:41:19] and say Lord forgive
[2:41:21] me brother Brandon would pray Lord
[2:41:25] forgive me of my
[2:41:26] sins he wasn't out drinking and smoking
[2:41:29] and committing adultery and you know his
[2:41:33] life but every one of us grapple
[2:41:36] unbelief comes and hits us every
[2:41:39] way storms hit our lives and sometimes
[2:41:44] even we the strongest of us flustrated
[2:41:46] and
[2:41:48] doubt like I said when you're filled
[2:41:51] with the Holy Ghost you're filled with
[2:41:52] Divine love so well I I don't that
[2:41:55] brother hurt me brother timy wounded me
[2:41:58] so bad I I I don't know if I have that
[2:42:02] Divine love maybe you hadn't been able
[2:42:03] to release it yet but it's
[2:42:06] there it's
[2:42:12] there you know you know how it is
[2:42:15] there's no two mortals can condemn
[2:42:18] another you stand before God and you
[2:42:20] take a brother up in
[2:42:22] prayer and he's done you wrong terribly
[2:42:26] wrong you get in the presence of God and
[2:42:29] you're reminded of your own
[2:42:31] shortcomings and you say Lord if you
[2:42:33] forgiven me so much will you forgive my
[2:42:36] brother cuz no no mortal can condemn
[2:42:39] another that's right we're not here to
[2:42:43] condemn we're here
