well you can get it God wants you to have it you lost your peace well God wants you to have your peace but you'll never make peace with the devil amen the only the only way you can ever have peace with the enemy is defeat him amen he was defeated at Calvary but you've got to take your promise and possess your inheritance amen God bless you and going to have you to be seated just for a moment I just want to just encourage you um to worship with us this weekend as we welcome you from wherever you are from around the world actually we got we got folks here from Australia and Belgium and Netherlands and Canada and the Philippines and uh even some foreign places like Arkansas and Texas and Mississippi so you know but anyway we're really happy to have you amen here in this good old state of Louisiana and um you know good things have God has um done done in this generation here right here at sort Louisiana was um was a birthplace of um the the herald of of the voice of healing magazine and where brother bram's Ministry took off and and uh he called this home many times and uh we're really happy tonight to be representing the message of the hour in this area amen holding forth the Word of Life in this last day and we want you just to be a part of us this weekend and enjoy yourself in the presence of the Lord and and uh just may the Holy Spirit just have preeminence in every service and now listen you know you you you have come with expectation I know you wouldn't come from uh the East and the West North and the South with without an expectation amen and and it's expectation uh that brings results cuz you're going to get what you expect and I hear brother bandam say this as I share this with you tonight of course we know we're living in the evil day and people are in the spirit of it and he said that's the way today brother that sitting us saying today of all this conglomeration of Blackness and darkness and sin and things that's going on in this world they're setting a stage for the greatest drama that was ever acted out in all ages the coming of Jesus Christ do you realize you are a part of this great drama tonight do you realize you are on the stage amen that God has called you and ordained you for this hour for this time and for this day and now it is your time to step into the prophecy of what has been prophesied of you in this last day because all of the scripture has been pointing to this the culmination of all things you know we had the the initiating of redemption 2,000 years ago at Calvary the foreshadows of it before that with the offering of lambs and and and the blood of bulls and goats but now we are here in the finishing of redemption we realize the lamb has stepped forth and broke the seals and and sent by Revelation the mysteries of God to us here in this last day and which makes us the people of the book we are here in the land of the book where every promise of God belongs to us so if you lost your healing there is healing for you if you lost your peace there is peace for you amen if you if you need the Holy Ghost there's a Holy Ghost in This Land if you need the power of God in your life the the power of God is in this land everything you have need of has been provided for you in this promised land and the whole land is open for you to go and possess your portion amen your portion you have a part in this promised land and brother Brandon said we cannot have the last day until the people get in the spirit of the last day and he said we cannot have a healing service here until people get in the spirit of a healing service we cannot have a filling of the Holy Ghost until the people get in that kind of atmosphere and the people in the atmosphere in that day to bring judgment upon the Earth and they're in the same atmosphere today eating drinking marrying giving in marriage and this kind of thing like that and the glory of God is being preached and demonstrated in the power of the Holy Ghost setting forth an example of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's going to take the earth into Glory just as certain as I'm standing here that's right and men are ignoring it paying no attention to it walking away from it because they are in the the spirit of the last day but I tell you that's not us tonight amen we we are of course in the spirit of the last day but not that evil spirit we're under the anointing of the hour amen anointed by a mighty angel that has come down and and revealed the mysteries of God and open up the whole word of God for you to enjoy and participate in but I'll tell you what we're right here on the cusp of the coming of the Lord Jesus Jesus and and and for that coming for that coming it's going to take a refilling of the Holy Ghost but the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost so I'll tell you if you didn't come for anything else you ought to come for that one thing Lord fill me fill me fill me again until I'm overflowing with the spirit of God I don't care how long you've been a Christian and how how and maybe your experiences dated but bring bring it up to date and fresh amen under the anointing of the god in this hour be under expectation as the spirit of God passes your way let's stand together we're want to welcome tonight brother Kelly hilderbrand he's going to be ministering tonight we also have our brother Ron Spencer that will be ministering this week on Saturday tomorrow brother Wayne Wayne Lawson will be here so you know we're we're just looking to and anticipating a great time in the Lord may this be the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus I want to sing an old song as brother Kelly comes because this is the burden of my heart somebody's got to begin to pray the last prayer of the Bible even so

and the praise we commit it to you now in Jesus Christ's precious name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to turn tonight to St John 1 verse 11-13 St John 1 verse 11-13 very familiar scripture I trust that it will be a blessing to you tonight he came onto his own and his own received him not but as many let's say many many as many as received him to them gave he gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Amen God bless you you may have your seats tonight tonight I'd like to start with a just a little thought tonight called bride Authority bride Authority I believe we're living in in a hour that is one of the greatest times that a person could be living that's right it's a time where the Bride of Jesus Christ is awaken aing to the reality of the word for her hour and Awakening to who she is as a as a person we're no longer in the former ages of justification sanctification and the restoration of the gifts but we're at the climax of all climaxes at a time when the bride has come into a place of maturity and the bride has to come into a place of maturity because we are the ones that would be we would say that by thoughts of grace we'll be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen so every time we come into the house of the Lord or we read our Bibles or we pray we have to have a re we have to realize within ourselves who we are as a people that we're not a downtrodden people we're not a people that the enemy can can push us around but it's our time to push back at the enemy it's not a time where where as the song was sung before that I'm going to take back everything the enemy stole from me amen we're in that timeline where we can do that yes sir amen it's not the time where Satan will will will will come against us but it's a time where we push back at him and we say Satan you stop right here we're not going any further with this because we have that Authority in the word of God Amen I I believe with all my heart that the that the prophets of old have looked for this hour but we are privileged say I'm privileged let's say it with passion tonight I'm privileged I'm privileged to live in this hour in this timeline in this day we would say that God has saved the the best for the last amen this isn't a weak bride this is a strong bride it don't matter what the devil brings toward us we've got power and authority over the powers of Hell amen it shouldn't be the enemy tormenting us but it's you that wake up every morning and you torment the devil because you know your position in the word of God I say it's time to learn who we are and recognize who we are that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen not just any bride but we're his bride amen I'm so thankful to be part of that amen we're living in the closing hours of the Gentile dispensation it's not a time to play Church no sir I don't know where you are in your walk with the Lord but if you're on the fence it's time to get off the fence it's time to make a clear-cut decision Amen to serve a living God Amen a lot of times I've heard back home even some people say well you know what I seemingly start and I can't can't get going I say get up again amen if you fall down get up again if you fall down again get up again amen don't stay down but get up again amen keep persevering keep pressing forward amen have a determination in your heart amen have passion in your life that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen I believe we should have passion in this hour I see people go to ball games I see people people go to a lot of places they got a passion for it but I say we should have a passion for the word of God we should let the devil know what side we're on that we're on The Winning Side in this hour that Christ is with the bride amen he promised never to leave us or forsake us time to take a reality of who we are have some passion about it amen not come to the house of the Lord all downtrodden but have some joy in your step and bounce in your step amen we're here to meet with God Amen you've been given Authority in this hour it's time to take our Authority amen when I think of the word Authority I I think of it as a person who who has owned a business and when I walk into the into our Factory or into our places nobody has to give me clearance to walk in I just walk in yeah amen if you're a CEO of the company you don't have to ask somebody can I go into this part of the building or that part no you've got clearance to go into that part of the building and brother brandom told us that that the promises of God and the word of God has been been given to us in this hour to the place that we have a great arcade amen and he said we need to take out a ladder sometime amen just go inside of it and take out your portion amen because you've got Authority amen you can go into the presence of God you can say Lord I've got a need of my life amen Lord I know you're more than able to meet the need of my life I'm going to trust you to meet this need in my life he's promised us in his word that he would meet the need of the people amen 1 John 3:2 it it tells us that beloved now we are the sons of God and the daughters of God Amen let's say now tonight amen let's say with passion let's say now amen now we're the sons of God Amen that doesn't mean that that it's a future event that means it's right today amen it's going to be tomorrow morning as well that now we are the sons and the daughters of the Living God Amen not we will be we are now and if you don't have that Revelation in your heart may the Lord impress upon you this this evening hour that now I am the Son of God now I'm the daughter of God Amen God has me here for a purpose amen we're not just here putting in time amen we're here as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the prophet told us that Satan may bring diseases but we have the authority of the word of God to cast out those diseases you're afflicted by the devil we've got the Authority today to cast out the powers of Hell amen we got to we have to know who we are in this hour amen we're the Bride of Jesus Christ and I emphasize that tonight amen that we are the bride not we will be the bride we are the bride somebody say praise the Lord tonight prise the Lord one of the quotes that I that I I really appreciate is the revelation of Jesus Christ and and one of the reasons because it speaks so directly to us as a people and brother Brown says Satan knows ass surely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God is Mark 16 in action it's the true church that Jesus claims as his own it says all else is false it has to be amen so we need a church with Mark 16 and action I believe we're standing in front of a people today that believe Mark 16 is an action and put it into action amen he says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts it's something that continues on Amen if the if the vine ever puts forth another Branch it'll be the same as the original Branch amen he says but the Book of Revelation shows how that Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it and make it lukewarm and make it powerless amen I want to say I I'm not going to be no lukewarm no sir I am not going to be formal I'm certainly not going to be powerless if I'm going to put my whole life into this gospel that Christ called me for this I am not going to be no lukewarm I'm not going to be formal and I'm not going to be powerless amen I may not know my ABCs but I want to know Jesus Christ amen a personal experience with him amen where there's a power of God moving in my life the power of God moving in your life amen what would it be at the end of it all if we would stand there and miss it amen we would have wasted our whole time amen because of being formal and power and lukewarm but I say I'm not I'm determined not to be formal or powerless or lukewarm I want a passion in my life a passion to hold on to this word a passion to believe this word a passion to walk in this word hallelujah sometimes people may think that oh you just want a lot of enthusiasm we should be enthused and people say we shouldn't be enthused I don't understand that thought we should have some enthusiasm after all we're people if we're people we got enthusiasm yes sir I never seen anybody yet say wow you know I got me a new truck and that's I got some enthusiasm about it got myself a new truck amen what do you think about him yeah come on Amen if if your wife makes you some good pie I love pie we get Pie when the brothers come to visit us we get pie we get pumpkin pie pean pie I kind of say that cuz our our Thanksgiving is this Monday so I'm here in our Thanksgiving as well amen we got our peon pie peacon pie PE pumpkin pie and our apple pie and sister Mar's laughing at me and all different kind of Pies but I never get them unless I get company so come come visit me at least we'll get some pie or something like that but if your wife made you a pie and you say wow you know it's not bad I've done that and she says there that mean that's it I took a couple hours to make this and yeah it's not bad I mean what do you think the Lord thinks what do you think the Lord thinks the Lord's giv you the Holy Ghost he's taking you out of sin amen he's taking you from addictions and your life amen he's taken you from from a wayward walk and brought you back into the economy of God what do you think the Lord think am he wants us have passion about it he wants us to thank him before it he wants us to glorify him for it amen because he's a living God Amen he wants you to adore him he wants you to make love to him he loves his people he likes to do good things for his people amen you give your wife a nice ring or something oh that's not bad no she I'm I'm happy about that I never seen one yet put her hands in her pocket not to show it it's something she wanted to make sure somebody saw amen I refuse to be lukewarm formal or powerless he says it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and they discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true Revelation let's say true Revelation the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can let's say can she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army amen not just any army but an invincible Army amen not just a halfhazard army but an invincible Army this Army will be the army of God hallelujah it's no wonder Satan hates Revelation because he knows when you realize who you are that you can't do the greater work he's powerless he's powerless in front of his children he says that they get the true Revel get the true revelation of two Spirits within the framework of the Christian Church see one spirit wants you to be formal and Powerless in luk Warren but the other Spirit wants you to be on fire for [Applause] God Amen on fire for God hope that's okay tonight amen says if you get the true Revel true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless let's say powerless power powerless before her for he will be definitely toward today as when Christ with stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation amen what does revelation do it gives you a gives you who it shows you who you are amen and when God gives us revelation we realize who we are then we realize that we are Sons and Daughters of God right now Satan hates it but we need it and we love it right with true Revelation in our lives like our brother Braham says that with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will let's say we will we will prevail over them amen there's two words that were that were here that were that I think are important one is invincible and one is powerless you know the word Invincible brother Brown says the bride she will be an invincible Army let's say that's me that's me Hallelujah that's me Invincible means incapable of being conquered incapable let's say incapable incapable that means totally impossible it don't matter what the devil tries he cannot conquer you he's incapable of conquering you amen it means that he's Inca you're incapable of being conquered incapable of being overcome or cap incapable of being subdued in other words we become an invincible Army amen not just a one person but a multi-member bride of Jesus Christ amen standing upon the Earth in the last daysall incapable of being conquered say well if I give my heart to the Lord then then then I I don't know if I'm going to be able to stand you can stand the same way we stand you say how do you stand brother Kelly by the power of God Amen through a new birth experience that puts the holy ghost in my life so that it's no longer me but it's Christ Living Through Me amen it's Christ inside of us the great conqueror himself which makes us the in the Invincible Army of Jesus Christ Jesus's last words in St Matthew 28:20 was Lo I'll be with you to the end of the world Amen I believe he's still with us he's never forsaken us sometimes we don't realize and we think well I don't know if the Lord's with me it's not how much we feel it's how much we believe do you believe it's our brother brownon was trying to get the people to do to believe if the people believe then all things are possible to them that can believe amen this last day bride can't be stopped come on hello this last day bride cannot be stopped it's impossible because this last day bride is predestinated let's say predestinated predestinated to go through amen God already saw you on the other side amen this end time bride cannot be stopped she's not like the first bride and she's not like the bride after the day of Pen cost this bride cannot be stopped why because you've got Revelation you know who Jesus is you know who you are it's impossible for Satan to stop it so you can get up every morning and say Boo devil because you can't be stopped that's the truth it's a rising of the Sun but now the true Trinity of God being one manifest in Christ who who was life and had broke the seals and conquered the enemy rose up and the one true and living God I am he that was dead and I'm alive forever more and have the keys of death and Hell God in one made man not two gods or three Gods but we got one God his name is Jesus Christ amen not two Gods one God not three Gods but one God and his name is Lord Jesus Christ amen he's my Lord and he's my savior he's your lord and he's your savior amen one God made man and dwelt Among Us and conquered every enemy let's say conquered conquered conquered every enemy and had proved that the Trinity of Satan was conquered well we could close up the Bible right there and go home cuz the Devil is a defeated foe I know we hear it all the time the devil's defeated then why do we allow him to boot us around and kick us us around when it should be the opposite way where we should take our Authority as the Bride of Jesus Christ Glory Hallelujah Trinity of God was made known Satan was conquered that the Trinity of God was made known because only God Alone had power to bring life back again he was that Emmanuel God had been manifested in the flesh says no wonder he claimed there Matthew the 28th chapter all power right is G in Heaven and Earth is given into my hand I send you to be my witness to all the world Amen he had conquered both death and Hell In The Grave not only did he do that and came out triumphant with all the power of Heaven and the Earth all that was the father and all that was the Holy Ghost and all that there ever was was in him all powers in heaven and an earth is given unto me I love these next four words everything else is powerless Hallelujah let's say it together everything else is powerless let's try it one more time everything else is powerless so when our Lord conquered the devil on Calvary everything else is powerless amen then you've got a defeated foe that we face every day and he's just a bluff in this hour Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Amen brother Brown said he had conquered it powerless as we read Satan will be powerless before the bride amen that gives me courage yes sir because it's an affirmative statement I'm an invincible Army you're an invincible Army and Satan is powerless before the Invincible Army in other words he's incapable of conquering you that's just what make you want to shout amen that just what make you want to dance amen Satan is powerless incapable of conquering you amen why because you are the true bride of Jesus Christ walking in this hour that we're living in blessed be the name of the Lord somebody say praise the Lord tonight amen I know we're getting to know each other so just bear with me but we love the word yes that's what I love I love the word amen Satan is powerless that word powerless means devoid of strength it means devoid of resources in other words he's got nothing else that's it well brother Brown said that he he he said Satan's powerless only if he can Bluff y so I say he's powerless he's powerless in your life on Amen he's powerless in your neighbor's life amen he's powerless in our lives amen we're an invincible Army we know who we are that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ he's given us bride Authority you can just go into the presence of God ask the Lord anything you want if you're sick in your body the lay call the Elders of the church lay hands on their sick they shall recover amen sometimes we think well what if it what if it takes so long we we we look but what if it it didn't happen immediately I suffered with asthma for 17 years still have some some problems that I deal with but God was my healer amen it took 17 years but it came a time when my time was there amen and I say that it makes me happy when I think about that he's my healer amen it gives me something to shout about because I know he's my healer amen when somebody else comes in a prayer line you can say God heal me from this you say it took 17 years that's a long time in God's economy it's a short time it may feel long for us but in God's economy it's a short time he's still the Healer it's a greater miracle if you can walk for a longer time than immediately immediate healing hope that's okay am he's a Healer he's a savior and Satan is powerless before the bride powerless he's devoid of all strength he's devoid of all resources he's the void he's lacking Authority or capacity to act he has no capacity or authority to act we read in the word of God that Satan can't even touch a hair of your head unless he gets permission from almighty God Amen so God knows all about our life he knows all about what's happening in our lives there's nothing that's taken him by surprise come on church amen he's in control of Our Lives when we really realize that God is in control then we get an understanding in our heart my steps are ordered of the Lord and then in my ordering of the Lord I'm going to act myself act as if as if everything is perfectly fine it don't matter how I feel it don't matter what happens it matters what does God Work say Amen because we are believers in this end time hour we're not unbelievers we're Believers that's what we do it's no wonder the scripture says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil goes about as a roaring Li sicken whom he may devour it says whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren better in the world that's right amen as long as we're in this flesh body we're going to get SI that's just part of being in this flesh body but we have a God that's our healer by his stripes we're already healed amen glory to God I feel like shouting right about now I'll be honest with you power of God on the platform here yes sir amen Mighty conqueror I can hear him as he said straighten himself out said Satan I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood's still wet on the cross I paid the price I've conquered and I've come down to take over strip you of everything that you claim that you have he reached over to his side and jerk those keys of death and hell off of him kicked him back into the place where he belonged he conquered hell when he arose he had the keys of death and Hell hanging on his side I like what brother Brown said what's the church scared about then that's right come on church amen what are we scared about brother Brown said amen he conquered Satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell amen no matter what you have need of he conquered it amen he's my conqueror and he's the one that's living in our heart amen and he's the one that's working through our lives it's Christ in you the hope of glory working through your life amen the word power that we read in our scripture reading in St John chapter 1 it sign ifies both power and ability Authority and ability in other words he's given you not only Authority but he's giving you the ability to use his word amen if you if he gave you the word but you had no ability what good would the word do but he gave you a sword in this hour and a sword is to be used a sword isn't to be in the sheath and locked up and rusted in amen a sword is to be used every day that you're walking amen we have an adversary he goes above like a roaring lion you've been given authority over him but you got to fight for every inch of ground that you need to take amen he doesn't just give it all to you in a flowery bed of yeast he wants an invincible Army he wants people both capable of fighting amen we got to fight if we're going to rain we're the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah with the ability Authority and ability amen power to become the Sons and Daughters of God yes amen he don't just drop it in your lap you got power to become the Sons and Daughters of God Authority and ability to stand faithful in this hour brother Brown told us a policeman has no power to stop a car no but he's been given Authority by the government and that Authority by the government when he puts up his hands all cars come to a stop amen he don't got no no power to stop those car right but he's got a poor authority to say that's far enough right there amen you've got that same Authority amen through the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your life amen you can put up your hand and say devil that's enough I I ask you to stop right there you say well he still comes back I say devil stop right there amen that's enough sir you've got Authority amen all Heaven is behind you hallelujah hallelujah take your Authority church is take your Authority the moon stands faithful in his position and his place with all the authorities of Heaven behind it amen and as the moon starts to starts to rise Amen in the evening times it's watching over the waters tides of the earth amen if there would be no moon there then the waters would overcome the Earth but the Moon is there to tell that's enough that's far enough amen it's signifying the power and authority that you have as a bride member amen that you can stand in that same position as a Son of God you don't have to go walking around like all downtrod and put your shoulders back amen and act like Sons and Daughters of the Living God Amen we should be the happiest people on the planet Earth Joy should be in our heart you say brother Kelly I just got a a doctor appoint a a doctor uh uh uh gave me a doctor's um U pron noxic and and you say it's not a good good thought but we should have uncontainable joy in our heart amen not because we're not feeling well but because we know who we [Applause] are it's not about the feeling of this flesh it's about what's in our heart that's what counts is what's in our heart Hallelujah wonderful water can only come so far then it has to retreat it has to move back that's right I say what about the Bride of Jesus Christ being part of the groom with power and authority in this hour Christ being the groom of the Bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoken of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride amen because she is flesh of his flesh and B B of his bone and life of his life and power of his power she is him as a man and woman are one and the woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made the mechanics and Dynamics in other words you've got that Authority the moon stands with his authority the policeman stands with their Authority and you stand with your Authority [Applause] amen yes we're living in an hour where energy is talked about all the time yeah I don't know about in America but in Canada they have this this idea that we're all going to drive electric cars by 2030 I don't think it's going to happen and and powers on everybody's mind we can't even support our own local grid let alone everybody plugging a car in that's kind of going to be a disaster amen even some of our people in in in our public offices and things like that they're they're acting like oh we're driving this electric car but they got designated charging stations so nobody else can to take them that's kind of convenient but power is on everybody's mind and power is is something that is needed in the hour that we're living in you know we've gone from the horse and buggy age in 100 years years to the jet age to the rocket age amen rockets that they're making today can travel at incredible speeds horse and Buggies you didn't go very far because that was that was only the spear where you could go but today we can get on a plane we got here in good time brother Timothy was there in time to pick us up everything worked out great we can travel great distances today yeah be in different places because of the hour that we're living in that's right cuz there there's more power that's available for us as people to use amen I can remember not very very many years ago and this kind of maybe dates us a bit but when our church actually we used to heat our church with coal oil and with wood many many years ago didn't have indoor plumbing on it so you know what kind of Plumbing we had it was called outdoor plumbing and and nowadays we just go into the church and we turn up the heat and we turn up the cooling system and everybody's just about happy not everybody's happy that happens that way too I guess here same what we do I always thought if somebody could come up with a Pew without had a heat and in a cooling spot for every person to sit on that'd be a wealthy M but we're so used to just coming in we just turn the heat up we don't think anything about it anymore if the power goes up we panic because we're so used to it but we're moving away from fossil fields or they think we are to El El everything's electric amen LED lights and no doubt we have them in here tonight they're brighter and more effective than than anything's ever been before amen take less energy to run cordless tools that that are available today with brushless motors there they more power all the time it seems like it's a power race who's going to make something lightest with the most power available to it amen electric cars are something that is starting to be prevalent and they're incredibly quick they go from 0 to 60 in a couple of seconds of time amen because there's one there's more power all the time when it becomes more power all the time then people can move quickly and more quickly to places they want to go one thing I I did some I did some research on it one time and and they say that you can charge up a car in 80 80% in about 30 minutes if you're at one of these supercharger places I kind of like that thought of supercharger amen when I come to church I want more than just a supercharger for 30 minutes amen I want a full charge every time I come to the house of the Lord amen I don't want no little sermanet amen I want something to have some Vitality something that has that that that's going to give you a full charge in this hour not just a half a charge or a part charge but a full charge amen when I heard that I thought well what good is that battery so you only got 60% you can use cuz you got 10% here and 10% there and the whole thing's gone amen I thought we need a full charge of the holy spirit all the time in our lives amen I say we don't want quick charges but we want we want full charges but powers on the people's mind amen Satan's trying to make it more convenient to travel amen but God is trying to get us to look upwards Amen to give us the power and the Authority for one day we're going to take off from this whole world somebody help me preach now amen there a time we need to get ourselves in a position for the w church for the change of the body Hallelujah I don't know about you church but it's going home time heyen I'm getting tired of this old P this world this world's gone crazy in this hour the only Saint people in this hour is the children of almighty God Amen I'm getting sick and tired of this place I'm ready to put my dancing shoes on and get out of this CH house it's time to go home it's time for the dead of Christ arise again it's time to move on and move on Hallelujah God bless you brother Jackie nice to see you amen it's time to move higher amen it's not time to go lower it's time to move higher Amen in this message go wake Jesus brother Brown said when a man or a woman is Anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he might not be able to read his name and Box Car siiz letters with education but he's got Authority from God Amen that he is the Son of God let him take his authority and stand and say stop and Satan's wheels will slide and breaks and his brakes will something will take place because he's been given Authority by the holy ghost in my name they shall cast out Devils that's it sure amen he has to know Jesus and know what he's been given him there he stands yes sir are the bride has to know who she are she is Satan's going to come to a hall amen everything we have need of has been paid for there's nothing Exempted church amen we read a quote before where brother Brown says why is the church scared why are we scared amen how can we be scared when our conqueror conquered everything death Hell In The Grave every sickness every disease every addiction Our Savior conquered it all amen there's nothing Exempted in it that's right amen this is the hour to take our Liberty and take what God's given to us amen and walk with what's God given us not a time to sit back heyen that's one thing I I look at and I feel for the people I say my Lord how can we shake the people sometime it reminds me the story where brother and I'm talked about that one that one person that baby nothing would attract its attention atton shook everything before that baby nothing attracted his attention she started to scream out and he said that God has shaken everything in front of the people and she just sits there and stares I say it's time to let the devil know what side of the ledge or war that we are the sons of God somebody say praise the Lord here tonight amen it's time to move [Music] upwards everything's paid for there's nothing Exempted in amen every promise in the Bible is to the believer amen the devil can't keep one promise but God keeps all his promises we have received a payment everything's paid in full let's say it's paid in full our transgressions are paid in full amen everything's taken care of Amen sin debt is paid in full he never save me to lose me he never save me to lose me the Bible tells me that he which begun a good work in me is going to complete the good work in me amen he saved us to keep usj Glory our iniquities paid for healings paid for freedom of worship is paid for sir he I'm going to repeat that one more time freedom of worship is paid for amen we got a right to worship God we got a right to shout we got a right can dance we got a right and thank God it's our God given right it's been paid for Glory everything is paid for some devil would try to stop the church of living God I say I'm moving onward and upward amen I'm not going to let some person try to steal the joy out of my heart what it's been paid for Joy paid for Victory is paid for peace is paid for amen eternal life is paid for everything we need has been paid for let's say it's been paid for it's been paid for you been paid for every one of us there's a quote that I that I've been sharing with the church for for a few weeks now once you see this message you can't see nothing else there's nothing else you can see because you realize who you are yeah amen you're not groping in darkness you're not wandering around with in the in the dark but you've got light in this hour Revelation in this hour amen not just something to argue the word about but to make you to to show you that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen people want to argue nowaday what do you want to argue for let's let's just read the prophets message

hours I know if I should tell your people that but but I thought man he shut it off real fast I'm not an hour and a half preacher just so you know that when God has giving you the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're then the life of Jesus Christ is within you hope these quotes are okay he says now that's true every Theologian will have to admit to that yes sir it's a new birth you are born a new of the Holy Ghost and because that God has did this and you know you're no good in yourself and you accepted what God did then he seals you into his kingdom by the Holy Spirit and everything that Jesus purchase and promis you in the Bible it's yours it's your property amen because it's paid for brother bradam says amen and we can say Amen tonight amen everything we have need of is paid for

support ignorance but I I'll tell you what we need is we need to know who we are as a people amen this meeting is just starting I hope this is a good start to the meeting amen we just got to let the devil know who we are amen that we've got the authority over him it's not him with the authority over us but it's you with the authority over the powers of Hell we've got the authority over the devil not him but he he thinks he's got Authority he's got no Authority brother Brown said his back was broken on Calvary he'll gum you to death if you let him to cuz you don't got no teeth anymore you've got the power and authority over him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah prise God God of this evil age and when the entire word of God incomplete was healed headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ and their God made me pay for my sins and him there then he rose me raised me up with power in the res in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil Amen in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established amen it says and now let's say now and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what God has given if we could only believe what God I trust he takes him some Amnesia office this weekend amen I hope he does that even tonight that we know what God has given he's given us the best he could give us he gave you the word he gave you the promise he said it's yours take it excuse me if I'm yelling I just I know you're not deaf but it's the only way I know how how to do it thank you we're in the South that's how I do it in the north too amen I made up my mind long time ago not going to be formal powerless and luk Warren not going to be no mossback if I'm want a shout I'm going to shout if I want to say Amen I'm going to say Amen if I want to say hallelujah I'm going to say hallelujah amen if I want to dance I'm going to dance amen because it really don't make any difference what the critics have to say they'll criticize whatever they want to criticize amen but I've got we've got the authority in the word of God can you imagine when John and Peter were at the gate called beautiful and the Bible said there was a certain man at the gate it doesn't even give the man's name he was imp poent from his mother's womb 40 years old standing sitting at the gate amen the Lord made sure he was there for a long time as a witness and a testimony of the power of Jesus Christ 40 years he bed 40 years he was asking for somebody to help him but there came one day a it just took one time one moment in the presence of God just one moment Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give it unto you and he grabbed him by their heart and picked him off from that spot and he started to leap and run oh hold it hold it certain man don't get too excited I know you have his walk for 40 in your entire life but don't get too excited amen the Bible says that he leaped and he jumped maybe we haven't had experience with God but when you one time get an experience with God you can shout you can leap you can jump you can give God the glory mayy because he's a living God in this hour just one moment in the presence of God hallelujah it's time to thank God for what he's done for the Church of Liv God I say great thanks has our God done blessed be the name of the Lord he jumped and he [Applause] leaped on the day of Acts acts 238 there was 3,000 men that came to the Lord 3,000 people brother Brown said the devil didn't even get out of bed but that day they had to take note that they'd been with Jesus because they were doing the same works as always happened when Jesus was there amen they wanted to quiet them down they said we're not quetting it down no sir well we're going to threaten you you go ahead and threaten us it don't make no difference we're going to go find our group of people and we're going to have an oldfashioned prayer meeting time and we're going to pray and and not say Lord oh they've been threatening us Lord what are we to do no they didn't do that no sir they they went before the Lord they say Lord you hear their threatenings what we need from you Lord is another dose of the Holy Ghost I wonder if the church of living God don't need another ghost of the Holy Ghost in the hour that we're living in today an hour of the time today that we're living in that will punch us the rapture we need the holy ghost in a greater measure and my Bible says your Bible says the house was shaken and they came up with a double portion with more power and more authority to speak about the things of God that's what we need in the Pulpit is more power and authority that's what the people need in the Pew is more power and authority in the word of God to withstand the demon power of this age that we're living in oh hell must be empty know but we've got all of God in us now amen we've come back to the final revelation of the word who Jesus Christ is I emphasize that for a reason I don't know who all Tunes in here but I want them to know where I stand brother brandham said that the greatest revelation of this time the Capstone revelation of this time is that Jesus is God not two or three but he is God and he's the one who I serve and he's the one who's empowering Us in this hour it's not a second person or a third person or some other person or just an elder brother is Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior the Living God hallelujah hallelujah yes sir he says oh if you can only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there and don't and don't you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you are seated there let's say I am I am I'm seated there but if you are seated there you will use it for you're ordained to do what you do therefore we have no fear it's unlimited to what God will do in this hour and the true bride of Jesus Christ amen when we go be brother R said we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God it's unlimited what God can do with a man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of men amen the camp of men I say we're gone beyond the camp of men this isn't about about a Ministry just of your church or our church or for the Ron Church anybody else church this is about God moving amongst his people amen and I desired him to move in a greater measure amen all the time amen I'm never satisfied to say Lord if you you're here we're still here that I need more Faith Lord let our faith bring us higher amen what what what what brings healing is our faith you say well really Kell you waited 17 years yeah my faith didn't grow grow weaker it grew stronger because he's my healer amen so one day that healing was going to come because as I would confess it I would walk into my healing as you confess it you walk into your healing amen because he's he's promising in his word wellow maybe I'll heal you maybe I no he said by my stripes you are already let's say already you are already healed amen it's unlimited what God can do there's no higher name than the name of Jesus Christ he's the one that's personified in your life amen there is no there there is power in his name there's healing in his name there's redemption in his name amen there's Deliverance in his name there's Resurrection

them he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also Al called amen so if he's called you he's called you for a purpose that word called in the Greek means to go to the marriage supper it means to go to the banquet he's called you for a reason amen when I go from when
