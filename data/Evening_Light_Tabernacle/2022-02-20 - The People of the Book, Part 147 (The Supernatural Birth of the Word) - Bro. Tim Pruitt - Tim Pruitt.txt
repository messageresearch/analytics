yourself to me in a mighty way i i need you compass by me speak to my heart lord don't pass me by father i pray that you'll do that today forever heart that reaches out to you lord may they listen closely because you're calling out the names of your people today you're identifying us in the scripture you're helping us to know our placing and seeing ourselves in the prophecy lord we know god your word is being fulfilled in this hour we want it fulfilled in our lives and we're just saying lord pass by our way speak to our senator in a great powerful living way revealing yourself to us to the word god i pray lord as you'll speak today lord may it be a day that we can walk out of here and say we heard from god god spoke to us spoke to me revealed itself to me i pray o god that you would do that bring healing and deliverance to your children salvation and understanding lord bring enlightenment to your word lord shine on us father illuminate the truth of your scripture make it real to our hearts heal our diseases lord save us from our afflictions lighten our burdens as we cast our burdens upon you knowing that you care for us i ask father now that as we look into the word of god today that you'll minister to hearts and lives and you'll just step forth from the pages of the bible and make the word live among us today we need your anointing without it we can do nothing and we're asking god that you would anoint us now as we read the scripture as we go forward in your name we're just believing lord that you'll just speak in a tremendous way today let your word be illuminated our hearts be touched our lives be changed in jesus name may today lord this service have eternal consequences we ask it for we believe in you in jesus name amen and amen god bless you it's good to be in the house of the lord today and we want to welcome you today and thank the lord for his goodness to us and his grace in our lives man we we miss our young people and probably 75 75 or 80 people that we got over in in dallas texas today that are out um the young young people in their chaperones and those that attended there and we just pray that god will bless them in a mighty way today amen and i pray that the lord will anoint you to make up for them amen we need your amens and your rejoicing in truth i believe we got truth to rejoice in you know i i found a couple of little nuggets here as i was studying this week and little quotations from the message queen of sheba and the other one is um from a from a sermon uh very similar to that one uh as far as year in time as the eagle stirs her nest this actually was in beaumont texas this one and they and i i wound up um you know just placing them kind of in over into my notes and just at the top of my page to find a place maybe to use them as i i would i would go through different things and look and i wound up leaving them right at the top of my notes and i didn't realize that till i was just about to walk out that i hadn't done it so i'm going to start with them amen and so it says from the queen of sheba here oh what if the christian church today could believe the gift that god sent them the holy ghost what if they would receive it what if all denominations would rally around the holy spirit as israel rallied around solomon with that gift the holy spirit is a gift to the church and the church turns it away and sets it off with our doctrines and our theologies and things that are manmade creeds and we shut christ right out and we don't let the holy spirit come in no miracles no shouting no speak with tongues no praises of god well if the holy spirit done that in the book of acts it'll do the same today because it's the book of acts and the the book of acts is not the acts of the apostles it's the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles it's the same holy spirit in the church today it would act the same way it would give the same results and why accept a substitute when the skies are full of real pentecostal power we don't have to have a substitute we can have the real amen and then as in the eagles turret they're nasty he speaks about an eagle in the cage that he was born to be a son of god creeds put him in a cage god wants him out oh he was born that was a work of man that put the eagle there but it's so and it's a work of man that puts you in them creeds and denominations they're all of the devil they're sir creed of man down days of miracles is passed no such thing as joy the holy ghost no such thing as shouting no such thing as speaking in tongues no divine healing oh my it's pitiful sons of god born to be free then caged down i'll tell you what we need to walk in freedom today let's go to the book of john chapter one we'll read from verse one here we have matthew mark luke and john parallels the four the four gospels parallels the four living creatures of the lion the man the ox and the eagles we're going to hear from the eagle here the eagle is a prophetic anointing and here as you know as he goes back to in the genealogies of jesus he doesn't start with mary and joseph and tracing back through david whatever but he says this when he goes to the genealogy of jesus and this is your genealogy your genealogy doesn't go through mary and joseph and david and abraham and that in a natural way your genealogy starts right here in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in the darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not there was a man sent from john from god whose name was john and the same came for witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world the world was made by him the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave ye the power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the wheel of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen god bless you can be seated we're going to be speaking today on the supernatural birth of the word we're going to be looking at a supernatural birth now starting here at the beginning of jesus we find that um of course as it speaks of his genealogy it goes beyond the natural man and the natural flesh and he goes back and traces where that he came from and so it says in the beginning god and and as it speaks of this it gives us the earliest glimpse that we can get of god and that's in the beginning where the invisible god the spirit began to move out toward the tangible and the invisible then was from there from the invisible there was birth the word and of course in that form we speak of him being the son of god and that he came out of the invisible but different from man who gives birth to another into a separate individual the indivisible or the invisible and the word was god now the the invisible god dwelt in the word and from the word every living thing that was made and every non-living thing like the earth and soil and trees of course is a living thing but but you know every tangible thing would be brought back by the word of god and each particle was an expression of a part of god through the spoken word saying let there be and so through the release of the word there as the word came out of god and here where it would begin to create and would bring forth the light and out of the light it would bring forth a substance and out of that substance the earth would come and the the sun the moon the stars and everything else and then then of course he would bring keep on creating until he would bring forth the sun in his own image now um this this i know was truly a son a son in the manner that we humans think of a son because a son is separate from his father and and but this son was um separate from god in that he was not god he was of the god life and he was of the god's likeness but he was a little god upon the earth with power that laid within his tongue to through which he ruled the world he until after the curse he did not rule by the sweat of his brow by his cunning mind of trapping and snaring animals and and living by the sweater brow chilling the soil but by the power that laid within his tongue by the word of god he moved the trees he said he spoken to this tree and moved it how do we know that because when the sun the second son of adam or the second adam rather came well he did the same he spoke to the tree and and it quit having life he spoke um and and created and he he would pull from one and make another and and this this is what he did as a son of god now and we know this would happen with adam there is a little god upon the earth with a power within his tongue through which he ruled the world and then of course we remember and know how sin entered and man fell when he mixed the unbelief with the word and that of course brought forth a hybrid life and that we are no longer in that original image of god as with immortal life but we have mortal life and everyone that is born in this world we're born hybrids we're born of doubt and not of faith and we're we're we're sexual born and born into sin and born into death we are born to die that's our first birth and but i want you to know that true religion won't let you remain a hybrid amen that's why you must be born again but again you know we with our first born birth we were born of the flesh as the bible said is you know um that we were born of the of not we were born of blood and the will of the flesh and a man this is how we were first born but the second birth it is not a birth of the will of the flesh or blood or the will of the of man but it is a god for as many as received him he gave power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name so you see again we we can believe on his name because we are born of him any son of god is born into the supernatural he is born by the supernatural a lot of times you have men that criticize for example divine healing well how can you keep from believing in divine healing when it's the very nature of the holy spirit is a very part of his redemptive work and what he did at calvary so every man that is born of the spirit of god he will have to believe in the supernatural because he is a part of god he is an offspring of god just like when you're born you can find traits of your father you got to maybe you got a nose like your dad a mouth like your dad well you have a right to look like him because he's your father so if god is your father we have a we have a right then to favor him to be in his likeness amen to believe in the supernatural because we are born of the supernatural spirit and outwardly we might be a man of clay or person of dust but inwardly you're born of the spirit of god and having a supernatural being in there that supernatural being hungers and thirst first heavenly home younger amen so it it looks into things that the eye cannot see in the supernatural and believes in things that you cannot obtain by the physical flesh of man now we come an offspring of god within our soul then that our soul is got to be something like on the order of god it believes the supernatural it can believe anything it can believe for anything you see if a man's come in contact with god and you talk to him about divine healing for example you know sure he believes that you know do you believe in miracles sure because why he's a part of god and he believes that anything can happen with god right amen so when he's born of god he becomes a son of god and the supernatural power of god dwells within him and and so we know we have a supernatural god we have a supernatural life and a man that is born of god has a supernatural spirit and that that supernatural spirit believes in the supernatural amen and and we it has um it believes in a supernatural heaven it believes in a supernatural rapture where it believes we're going to be chains supernaturally from from in a more in a moment in a twinkling of an eye if a man is born in the spirit of god he can't help but believe that because he is a supernatural person and so you know that's the reason though we have so many of these cold formal indifferent god forsaken backslidden churches because we got too many that are not filled with the holy ghost and all they know is theology and that's the reason you can't get them to believe anything because they're just filled with theology and not filled with the holy ghost but let me tell you something that every man that is born of god he is a miniature creator he has the spirit of god in him which is a creator and so that makes him a miniature creator he can create an atmosphere for faith he can create an atmosphere for healing he can create an atmosphere for salvation that's what ought to happen when saints of god get together they ought to create an atmosphere where the supernatural takes place amen that because you know we are in the image of god god is a creator and that's the reason we can believe god can heal because god is in you and god made the world and he spoke it and it became material and so therefore we know that the very ground we are living on is god's word made manifest and and so again he brought it into existence by the word of god and we know we can take the word of god that speaks of our healing and bring healing into existence we know we can take the word of god that speaks of salvation and bring the holy ghost right to a person we know that we can speak the word of god and we know things are going to happen the earth is going to shake demons are going to tremble amen the power of god will work out of the word when a believing christian takes that word and places it in his lips and my mountains will move and then demons will flee the blind will see the death will hear the sick will will receive of their healing the lost will be found hallelujah amen and they'll not just be found they'll be delivered are you with me they'll be delivered that there's no nothing that the devil put upon their lives that can hold them back their sons and daughters are the most high god [Applause] man that is born in the spirit of god he is an offspring of god part of god is in him he believes every word that god said will materialize amen so that makes him a part of god it's the holy spirit in the man that makes him a part of god then god is your father the problem is we have too many that are born of the church rather than born of the word amen now as brother branham told us in spoken words original seed he said all god's sons must be the same to be born of the word and the spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in john 3 to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do it brings you back to the place you should have been at the beginning now we know that at the at the beginning when adam fell and man was been birthed sexually instead of coming as adam came by the spoken word of god and this is how a son of god was to to bring life in was by the spoken word of god but when man fell man fell and became mortal living in a mortal life and so we were born wrong every one of us were born wrong this is why jesus said you must be born again every person must be born again to go into eternal life amen it's a birth that bursts you into that life a birth burst you into human life a birth versus a dog in the dog life a birth of birth a cow into the cattle life amen a birth of son of god will produce another son of god when god gives birth he's going to give birth to his own and it'll be a son of god like he is god now so again we have a lot of problems here today we got a we got a nest full of rotten eggs we got a lot that have never been germatized and man we have too many that have just been sitting in the nest for a long long time and they they don't have life in them somebody with me right now amen this is the problem that we have today is the church is is not been with the mate christ jesus you take an old hand that hadn't been with the male it's not that i don't care how much she mothers over the eggs how much she warms them and incubates them and it's not going to hatch she'll when it's over with after all her efforts he has a bunch of rotten eggs this is what the bible said in the book of revelation that there's a cage of ever unclean and hateful bird and that's what the church becomes backslidden people people that are calling themselves saved and still living dirty lives with alcohol and tobacco and drugs and sex sins and pornography and everything else is because that the church has left off being with the mate christ jesus and the eggs are not germatized so you bring forth baptists or methodists or presbyterian or pentecostal but you don't bring with christ if you hadn't been with the mate christ jesus been born into supernatural you can't believe the supernatural and when a man's born in the spirit of god god's a creator he's a part of god and so therefore he's going to be like god he's an offspring of god in his soul and he bleeds for the supernatural and you can you can know that it's it's the truth now i want just i just want to take a few moments now as we look here because we're we're living in a time where we're at the end age we're at the last age of laodicea and it is a time where christ is put outside the church now it's not that they're not that they don't make a profession because they're still professing to be the church but christ is not on the inside he's on the outside knocking behold i stand at the door and knock he's actually been put out amen because he was once in the church but laodicea shows he's outside the church and he said i'm standing there knocking i'm asking to get in now what a day what point what a problem we're having today look where we're at in time look at the problems of the age and the troubles that we're having in this time we're in a very serious hour amen this is a time of great darkness upon the face of the earth and confusion everywhere but now let me just go for a moment i want to take a few times and and i'm going to have to wing a lot of this today and i'll maybe tell you why a little bit later but um but i'm just going to kind of wing some of this as we go along let me just preach let me just preach from my heart for a moment let me just tell you you know exactly what we are in time and what is happening you see every revival that there's been has produced twins the twins would start in heaven there would be two archangels michael and lucifer amen and and you know lucifer would of course begin to um he was he's actually a the bible calls him in ezekiel 38 a a covered cherubim he was to be one of the angels that protected the word likes depicted on the on the um um the the holiest of holies there upon upon the what is that called the ark of the covenant and there with their with that ark of the covenant are two angels two cherubims and their wings would overshadow the word and he was to be one of the overshadowing cherubims a protector of the word of god but the bible said he began to look upon himself and he began to he began to think of what a great person what a great person that he was he began to lift up his self and he began to have a thought different from god's word and he began to hybridize the truth so he said i will exalt myself this is isaiah chapter 12. i will exalt myself above god and all that is called god i'm going to put my dominion over god and everything else it'll all be under me and there as he began there he began to preach and he deceived angels now he's a great preacher the devil's a great preacher and he deceived angels with his preaching are you with me and they were cast out of heaven down to the earth this is where we get demons and powers of darkness and rulers of darkness and high places this is where that we get that where we get demon oppression and everything they're fallen angels once once messengers of god but fell from their estate now then i want you to notice it comes down to the earth he comes down to the earth and what's he find he finds there's adam and one right next to adam now the one right next to adam is the serpent he is the he is the most subtle beast he's not a serpent he's not a snake on the ground yet that don't happen until after the curse he's not a snake in the tree he is a beast of the field and he is very cunning and he's he can talk he has intelligence come on this listen we're not some greek mythologists that believe in a magic apple and a talking snake no sir god created and he brought up and here the serpent was right next to man he could reason he could talk and there satan entered into him to deceive by so now you've got twins on the earth you've got adam and serpent everyone both of them are saying yeah hath god said both of them are saying god told me this and the other said god told me that and he believes the lie of the devil amen and the fall takes place the same thing as the fall happened in heaven now the fall happens on earth and now we're dealing with fallen man but it don't stop there you have two twins with cain and abel the bible said that that that she conceived and brought forth cain and then brought again his brother abel and then what happens next there is a contention between the seeds where where does the vault take place at the worship they come to the altar to worship and god shows what he receives and the kind of worship that he accepts which is blood and the given of life amen portraying christ and what will come there and he shows what he will bless as the as he recognizes abel's sacrifice and refuses canes and cain knows what god wants and he knows what god accepted he can see god's vindication but he refuses it so he sees a supernatural move and god's acceptance but he refuses the supernatural for his own works now of course what happens is there's a persecution takes place now as we're as we come down to this for a moment with this persecution that takes place here we come where cain kills abel but now it moves on from there because every revival produces twins so the next place and this is where we're going to deal a lot with today is ishmael and isaac now they're not twins in the sense that they're born at the same time but they're two seeds of abraham now god will use abraham and his seed to project everything he's going to do redemption so we call abraham the father of our faith and we can look back and we can see the journeys of abraham and the stations of his life where god brought him to and we find that he was a man in the ur of the chaldeans he was a gentile and a heathen worshiper like everybody else but he got a divine call and god by predestination called him out of the heathen and said come walk with me and i'm going to give you a land i'm going to give you a promise and i'm going to make of you a great nation now as we look at this for a moment we can see as he does he comes to this divine call and that is justification you see that's where the church has been in the great restoration process it started with luther the just shall live by faith believe on the lord jesus christ and they started out their believing walking with god coming back heading back to the promised land which is the holy ghost and as they're as they're heading back we're heading to this promised land and and whatever god is praying bringing him through different stages of the journey and then he will bring him up to the blood age from there the blood age he will bring him to the altar you see he didn't know how to worship until god taught him out of worship and he would tell him go make me an altar come give me you know offer this sacrifice i'll meet you here and god would meet him there and there he would he would build an altar worship god offer the blood this again is the stage the church has come through we come through the wesleyan revival where the church in his in his process of restoration has come to that and and in this restoration process that learned it was the blood that sanctifies and so they will wash the robes and the blood of the lamb to make them white and by works of righteousness they do and wash them in the blood they become sanctified so they've moved a little closer now and and they're they're coming into the promise now we come to the pentecostal age and there in the pentecostal age we find that he makes the promise of el shaddai which we'll get to it in a little bit perhaps where he he says just come nurse from me and when i am your strength giver i'm your life giver i know said i i'm the almighty god i am your provider i'm your need supplier it's all in me now but the problem is that it was brought before the early pentecostals and and instead of doing it it was like what happened in the days of sarah and abraham sarah decided through reasoning that she could not bring forth the promise she was weak in faith and it produced an itch meal she said let my bones woman let my bones woman which is a type of denomination let that bring forth a child i can't do it i don't have the faith to do it i'm too old i've been waiting on this promise too long and she made all her excuses and her unbelief produced an ishmael yet it was a seed of abraham now so instead instead of nursing from el shaddai just before they come to el shaddai which is the god almighty in genesis chapter 17 what did they do they grabbed the breast of a denomination rather rather than the than the real breast of el shaddai and so what happens it left it there bringing forth a wild man who wouldn't be subject to the word somebody with me now so let me explain as we just kind of go over it again and god has brought us like abraham called him out of babylon brought him from the earth the chaldeans took him across the euphrates now that was justification as the church moved toward greater revelation of god and and then god taught him out of worship by blood and wesley brought out about sanctification washing their by works their their garments making them white in the blood of the lamb and then we come to the pentecostal age and i want you to understand we are in the age of pentecost there's the era of many around the message today they don't know where we're at we are in the age of pentecost this is a day where the day of pentecost fully comes all the types that have spoken of it is now being manifested now so again this this is where the real twin though comes in the manifestation because here would come the supernatural as the word was coming to view for people to be born of and just before the supernatural takes place what happens they take instead a natural approach the working of abraham's strength and his own works and it produces a child that is an ishmael not the promised child and god never recognizes as the one he had spoke about he says in isaac shall thy seed be called and i you know this one came out of your own works the what i'm doing it comes without your works it comes by grace alone it comes by the power of god it comes by supernatural birth now here was god about to offer himself as el shaddai in this age of pentecost where god where the bride was to return to the bride she was at pentecost is where the church was to return to the bride she was at pentecost in other words the original grain that was planted would come to harvest again the seed there would be seed here so here god was going to offer himself his el shaddai the blessed god where the birth would come through the word and and he he said nurse from me the blessed god all the a new testament here the word would be revealed the full word would be uncovered made known come on church amen and from there a word from the word bride would come a child born of the supernatural not a child born of works amen whether it's the works of a man walking down and accept and join in the church that's works where it just says well i believe the message and i accept this doctrine that's works where it's a worked up emotion that works amen but this child will be born as a supernatural apart from the works of man where god comes down and bursts him by his spirit amen without without man's efforts but of the creation because when the word brings forth is a new creation it's not the molding of a man it's not learning how to dress it's not learning how to do good works it's not learning anything it's being born and when you're born his life is in you because his nature is in you it comes out automatically so we had it began to break forth as the spirit of god was poured out in this age of pentecost and and we had the zoos of movement but instead of producing a child of the supernatural and isaac it produced a child of the bonds woman just another denomination an ishmael now if you look with me to um genesis chapter 16 verse 7 the angel lord found hagar by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the by the fountain in the way to sir and verse 6 of 10 it says and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed that it shall not be numbered for multitude notice this is going to be a multitude without number now when it comes to the church it's not a lost bunch of people that come up in revelation chapter 7 out of great tribulation they miss the rapture but they're there they're given apart they're given an inheritance they're given a portion i mean and they are great people a multitude without number who do works of towards salvation of washing physically washing their robes in the blood of the lamb to make them white but i want you to understand that's not how you are dressed you're dressing white too you're but by a royal grant revelation 19 he said and it was granted to her to be arrayed and finally and clean and white amen one did it by what's the other it's supernatural is it ground it's something they didn't work yourself into it wasn't something they tried to earn it wasn't something they did on their own it was a great given to them by god by grace [Music] now john saw them come up through great tribulation not having the holy ghost but works of justification sanctification a multitude without number you see there is a bride and she's going in a rapture and there's a church who's going to go through tribulation and the difference will be the supernatural because i'm going to tell you you cannot on your own make yourself go into rapture we cannot own our own with physical means bring a resurrection it's supernatural we cannot change our bodies on our own nothing we can do nothing science can do nothing we can work ourselves up to we can't shout our way to it we can't dance our way to it it's all supernatural now 16 11 it says and the angel lord said to her behold thou art with child and shall bear a son in his name shall be you shall call his name ismail because the lord has heard thy afflictions now you probably don't know this unless you really were a bible student studying it out and just contemplating maybe did a little search but this is the first time the first time the very first time that an angel is mentioned in the bible and it comes to hagar abund's woman notice what's now it's an abraham's group it's in abraham's church are you with me but it comes to bomb's woman that's right and it comes concerning abraham's seed an israelite an ishmael now you know i i i want to just i just want to say something about it you know the angel of the lord that has come in our day because we know it's come 1946 it appears to a a man a prophet of god and it it gifts him and sends him out with a message gets word that it went to first the pentecostals amen the angel first came to pentecost so you see the azusa street pentecost wrote the first books a man sent from god amen a prophet visits south africa they're the ones that took the first sermons as the eagles stirred their nests in the eleventh commandment and different other ones and began to print them they're the ones that made the campaigns and set it together and it was in their churches that it happened what i'm telling you the angel came first to hagar the bomb's woman now but but notice what they did is brother branham told us he said they denied the supernatural birth you see they took speaking in tongues over the supernatural you said brother timothy speaking in tongues is supernatural it can be but that's not what they had they worked it up getting people down the altar shove them on the back and jabbing their chins and getting them to say a word over and over and it was a work of man and not the work of the holy ghost but what were they doing trying to wash their robes with works there is a real genuine speaking in tongues and it doesn't come by jabbing your chin it doesn't come by somebody saying jesus jesus until they have a confusion of language that's not the way it happened on the day of pentecost amen it was supernatural on the day of pentecost and it's got to be supernatural when god does it are you with me it's not a learned behavior i've been in charismatic meetings where they when they say okay everybody right now raise your hands like this and just start saying whatever comes to your mind i'll speak of him later a little a little bit you know but i listened a little bit to john osteen who was the father of joel osteen and and and he he started moving from the baptist into a charismatic baptist in 1958 and i'll talk about that a little more later but there he said the first word i got from god was tah so i said [Laughter] you see you see it was men with an earnest desire to see the supernatural to see the promise come to pass but what they do they took a manufactured a manufactured tongue something you could do by your own works and you can work up you can work up dancing or shouting or or crying or speaking in tongues or you can work up any of that and you can also work up a theology or just accept this creed and if you say you believe this and you know if you if you claim to believe that you can work up any of it it's all works and when it does it bursts and hiss me out amen so now here come ishmael he came by doctrine by man's own efforts to bring it to pass remember sarah got this idea the weakness of her faith produced an ishmael the weakness of the church's faith produces ishmaels it produces the bondsman receiving the sea rather than the true woman it produces hybrids instead of the original sea or the promising now so ishmael came by sarah disbelieving the word was for her she believed now listen this is where a lot of people do it they can believe jesus can do it they can believe jesus did it they can believe he opened the eyes of the blind they can believe that he can work to supernatural they can believe come on somebody they can believe he can heal the sick they can believe she rose from the dead but they can't believe the church can do it and sarah was good at believing oh abraham it's for you it's for you you can do it you know there's many of them around around today they believe the prophet can do it but not you they don't have enough faith to believe the promises to the church yes they'll say they look back and say oh yeah he could do it yeah it happened then and those kind of things produces his meals because people desire the church has got to give birth and so you know to bring this word to past we manufacture either doctrines and creeds or emotion now i want you to get it i want you to understand something as we look at ishmael because ishmael does not represent a lost people it represents a multitude without number who go through the tribulation or given life at the white throne judgment read revelation 7. their children are the bondswoman but now i want you to hear this for a moment you see the the the angel showed care for even hagar in the ishmael i i don't want you to miss that point it's too important the angel showed care benevolence love understanding for hagar and her offspring now he would he would come in genesis chapter 16 verse 12 and he will be a wild man and his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him so to literally say what the bible actually said in the translation he'll be a wild donkey of a man that's what the bible calls him the bible in the original hebrew says he will be a wild ass of a man and his hand will be against everybody and everybody's hand against him and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers well look at them today 40 000 different denominations and every one of them's right and they're everyone's the ones that's going to heaven everybody else is going to hell why their hands are against everybody you see he was a child of the bonds woman but god is determined would you understand and determine god he is that the instrument will not be heir with the free that there is a rapture of a bride of christ who is the church and then there's a church that goes through the tribulation and they're not going to be heirs together now let me tell you again i want you to get it god bless them god blessed ismail god made him a mighty nation you know you look around and you say well they've got mighty buildings yes god bless them they've got big congregations yes god bless them they even have miracles yeah god blesses them he's the angel cares for them you know a lot of times people are surprised because they hear somebody out there you know a miracle happen don't get surprised the angel cares for them you know god did mighty miracles for oral roberts for a.a allen brother branham mentions a man by the name of john osteen he calls him brother osteen from texas but it was john osteen the father of joel osteen john was about the age of my mother said boy he was born in 1921 he'd be 101 years old now in 1958 his daughter lisa was born with a cerebral palsy and he had a hunger for god and for more god he longed he began to long for the god of the book of acts he was a baptist believer but he said there's more to it there's there's more to it than this and his his daughter was born in 1958 daughter lisa was born with cerebral palsy and and having a hunger for more of god and determined to know god as a healer he did not accept what the doctor said that she'd never walked she'd never crawled she'd never talk she'd never be mentally able to do anything and he would not accept it i think that's a good policy when we hear the doctor say something that's his report but what did god say who hath believed his report to whom is the arm of the lord revealed amen if you believe his report the arm of the lord is going to be revealed to you that's the whole thing you'll never see the arm of the lord do you believe the report you have to believe that he is and that he's going to reward those who diligently seek him you have to realize he's going to be your healer and that his word is true and it's for you remember he that cometh that god must believe that he is not that he was but that he is not that he's going to be but that he is we can look back at yesterday to see what god is today we can look into the future and know he'll be that in the future is that right amen but he didn't rep he didn't accept the doctor's report the doctor said your daughter will never live it'll never never thrive and and he hungered more from god you know there and and and so he said you know we're going to we're going to take god at his word doctors can't help us so he anointed his child with oil him and his wife prayed over that child and believed god and it was a process but today she's a well woman man she's a well woman she has a ministry she she's been a missionary she's been there she's done a lot of works why because her dad refused to believe the doctor's report and later his church in houston would grow up to between eight and fifteen thousand people and and and his emphasis if you ever listen to him which i did because i just got curious about it after you know hearing some of joel osteen and what joel speaking i thought what does daddy preach what does daddy preach because he refuses to preach on hell and sin and evil and wrong and he just preaches on god's blessings and faith and the feel-good message and i said well what does daddy preach and so i went back to listen to his daddy and his daddy his emphasis was on receiving the baptism in the holy spirit and he said he preached you know you received the new birth first and then and then after receiving the new birth which he believed he had done in the baptist church he got a he got a baptism into the holy spirit with evidence of speaking in tongues and and so this is what he believed he believed the supernatural and he saw it work his wife his wife duty would come down with terminal cancer and with terminal cancer there that would pray the prayer of faith and now she's in her 90's still cancer-free under son joel the emphasis changed now to faith-build and feel good message and it's grown they got a stadium full of 35 000 and they're praising god for that and i thank god for ever solely help every person that attends amen i'd rather see them in there than in a bar room somewhere amen but i tell you these again was the children of the bonds woman and the supernatural was there you can't deny it but they were never born of it i'm going to get to this here in a minute even even the abraham he wanted he wanted ishmael when god said i've got something better i've got a better plan i'm going to do something supernatural he said well he says in genesis 17 18 oh that israel might live before thee he begins to immediately say god make out of ishmael you know i've already got a seed there's already you know bless this bless this bless this work take it in the rapture take it to the chain two for it and god said you know there he said as for ishmael in verse 20 i have heard thee behold i have blessed him i will make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly and twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation are you with me amen this is what he said i'm going to bless them i'm going to prosper them i'm going to use them and then they can say well listen the angel came to us the angel gave me my name it's me he named me the angel showed us the spring of life the angel was there to guide us and help us but he was never born of the supernatural i want you to get it now i want you to understand that the angel there was in charge of the whole church both the foolish and the wise virgins and he moves in both of them and he blesses both of them and he honors both of them but only one gets born of the supernatural only one goes through a body change so the promised son can come only one receives the experience of el shaddai god almighty so there is a church and there's a bride amen now i want you just i just want i want you to go through this just for me with me for a minute psalms 91 verse 11 because i've been thinking a lot in this past week about the angel in charge there is an angel in charge let me go back again there is an angel specifically given to see this church into a rapture there is an angel that guides the church into the tribulation and are saved in the tribulation there is an angel blessing now hold this thought revelation i mean psalms 91 verse 11 for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in thy ways now notice there is an angel given in charge to keep thee in the ways in all thy ways so god had an angel that was given charge over this message this message came by an angel the anointing came by an angel the gift came by an angel i want you to get it now and an angel has been given charge now he would appear to brother branham and and commission him to take a message of divine healing and will lead him all the way to the opening of the seven seals where that we are today preaching from the full word of god an open book not a closed book now and brother branham now has been gone as long as he was here 56 years but there was an angel that was it was that was given charge over this message and the word must come to pass i do want to say to you god cannot come here to the laodicean age the last age to the gentiles and find it too difficult that they're too lukewarm too many christ rejecters too many failures too many faults with her and abandon his project he cannot abandon redemption he cannot back up on his work he has to finish what he started are you with me now you see the angel appears to abraham and separated um hagar and ishmael from the other group and there comes a separation and then he appears to sarah discerns our hearts and gets her to believe and again what was he doing turning her back to the original pentecostal faith coming back to the original faith the original word and then he says as he as he comes into certain heart he said i will return again according to the time of life and sarah shall bring forth a son so he's watching over his word somebody help me preach amen even when they stray out of the promised land and go down to carrer and a young philistine king wants to take sarah and defiler the angel in charge says don't you touch her you're a dead man unless you restore the that man his wife and that man is my prophet and he's got to pray over you what was that an angel was in charge he was watching over the seed he was watching over the womb he was watching over the promise and i want you to know today the angel has not forgot his promise [Applause] hallelujah i want you to remember i don't care what's happening in the world and your eyes are out here on russia and your eyes are out here on the walk liberal agenda that they got and their eyes are all here on the president and your eyes are there turn your eyes back on the angel of god and realize the angel of god is in charge hallelujah the book of revelation said he holds up the four angels hold the four whims of the earth wars and strife and he ain't gonna let it loose until he seals 144 000 and before that he's got a seal of pride and take her in the rapture in the glory hallelujah are you with me amen they they can do nothing listen listen even until he gets locked into the place he said i can do nothing until you come here hallelujah you're worried about everything else don't worry about that there's an angel in charge you're worried about the deceptors and the deceiving don't worry there's an angel in charge there's young kings that want to take and take that womb for their own seed but let me tell you there's an angel in charge i'll have a bride and she'll be without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing amen he comes right there discerns a heart but he said that ain't all you're going to see of me i will return according to the turn of light time of life i'm telling you it's the time of life it's the hour of the change it's the hour of the resurrection we've talked about it we preached about it we believed about it but we're here hallelujah amen why because i know i know there's a people drawing from el shaddai and we draw on him until we are changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye jesus the promised son like isaac must come somebody with me now you know sometimes we make a real mistake we place it all in the past we pass place it all in brother branham we want to just say here timothy open that here we we want to we want to say um you know have some idea you know you know about it or it can only happen in brother branham it can only happen in his ministry it only happened back then and the pillar of fire it's not present today it's not it's not for us today well i want you to know there was a church had it long before brother branham had it came on the day of pentecost and let me just tell you what he said the pillar of fire has nothing to do with me i'm just a man the pillar of fire is in the church not only with me it's with every one of you it's in all of us hallelujah when you were born of the holy ghost of the supernatural amen the pillar of fire was given birth and as it give birth tongues of fire came out of it and they were filled with the holy ghost every one of you that's got the holy ghost has the pillar of fire residing in you [Applause] hallelujah the same one that was in the burning bush the same one that appeared to paul on the day on the road to damascus the same one hallelujah that appeared in our day and discern the hearts that would make known the mystery that same one is abiding in the church today hallelujah amen abiding in the bright body because he is a supernatural people born of the supernatural birth now here's what he said i have nothing to do with it he said actually he can fail to come tonight i have nothing to do with it it's your faith that believes that that brings it down here to present tense your faith that believes it that brings it to present tense i have nothing we don't we don't need brother branham here to have it amen that your faith can bring him right to your pew right for your need right to your situation hallelujah your faith can cause the pillar of fire the locals of god the word of god that come right down to you to your need psalms 69 91 you see when we live our lives in the shadow of the god the most high god ours makes him our secret hiding place we're shielded from harm you know what that makes me think of the holiest of holies there were three approach to god with israel there was the outer court then recording the most holy in the outer courtyard and the inner court it was all but in the inner court and the most holy court or somebody with me amen it wasn't anything with works in that place and man there was the shekinah glory it's like never went out on the outside on the outer court the sun was the light and it would get them and cloudy days and and rainy days and dreary days and ups and downs and ins and outs out there their manna would grow old and gr and breed worms and stink that's what's wrong with a lot of them they're on the outer cord and your experience gets maggots in it amen and you're like those damn amen you got it up and down in and out experience same happy thing happens in the inner court justification sanctification now baptism of the holy ghost your approach to god the most holy and i want you to read here in psalms 91 let's talk about it just for a minute and i'll come back to that because god has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation wait a minute you did what you mean a man-made temple dawn isn't your refuge you pray your preacher isn't your refuge your creed your dogma is not your refuge no you had a supernatural birth and yours is where the supernatural is it's the very presence of god himself it's not a gift it's it's not a just an anointing that comes and goes it's him and you have made the lord your refuge which and he you made him your habitation this is your dwelling place if you abide in me and my word abides and you ask what you will this only comes by the holy ghost that god don't come by fasting in prayer and reading work books of works and sanctification and holiness it comes by a birth listen brother branham pulls a rapture from this verse let me in in psalms chapter 27 verse 4 one thing i have desired of the lord psalms 27 4. one thing i've desired of the lord that will i seek after oh that there be a people seek after this that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life not in and out and up and down but a constant everyday walk with christ hallelujah that's a real christian not just a christian on sunday and on and wednesday and some other days he lives different amen but oh one thing i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord and in all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and inquiry in his temple verse 5 for in the time of trouble and we're here he shall hide me in his dwelling place his pavilion in the shelter of his promises he and the secret of his tabernacle he shall hide me he shall set me up on the rock i'll be in the innervale in the time of trouble somebody with me now amen oh yeah i'll be in the interval in the most holy in the holiest of holies you know what's in the holiest of holies is a lot different from the outside in the holiest of holies there instead of an artificial light like like on the inside of the holy place they had seven golden candle sticks and if the oil got down and the the lamb went dim and could go out it was man-made the wick could get dirty or burnt over and the glad that globe could could get could get dirty and smoked out and that's what's the matter with a lot of people hey man you you've had a little fire of god and you've had a revival and you had a little experience but you you become smokey and you you don't bribe it doesn't shine real bright and it loses its real glow don't give off the light it should that's what's a matter with a lot of you christians that are backslidden in your experience you ain't went far enough i mean you said well i need to clean the globe no don't go through works again go a little further with god come in behind the veil into the holiest of holies somebody help me preach amen because in that holiest of hole is there your light never goes out it's a shekinah glory it's the pillar of fire and it's always there when it's cloudy outside when there's war that is coming when hovind is right wrecking people's bodies when people are running for fear you are safe in god's pavilion hallelujah you know who you are you know where you come from you know you're in the presence of the almighty you have made the almighty god your habitation you dwell on him he dwells in you and you can ask anything in his name and he's going to do it holiest of holies they had manna there now out here that manner they kept it over a day you know it had they had to get it fresh every day and if they didn't they tried to keep it over one day it bred worms and stink that's what's wrong with a lot of church theology today that's what's wrong with a lot of message theology nothing wrong with the manners where it's kept amen that same manner taken in the holiest of holies it never goes old it never breach worms it never stinks it's for every generation hallelujah god put it up in an homer and he said i want you to put this in the holiest of holies so that every priest of every age amen can go in there and get the same thing that the original church had you can get the holy ghost just like it was on the day of pentecost hallelujah amen in the holiness of holiness that's where dead sticks come to life and bear fruit hallelujah it's time you take your old dead stick that is backslidden and in a in a lust condition just withered up an home yet stick bring it in the presence of this kind of glory and it'll it'll break what leaves it'll bring forth through amen he'll bloom in the presence of that pillar of fire hallelujah i feel religious right now hallelujah if it do any good i'd speak in another language but you wouldn't know what i said but in the time of trouble he'll hide us in the secret of his tabernacle this is a rapture hour this is a rapture place i'm taking a people into an experience that's beyond the other ages and i want you to look here in verse 10 there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling well we know what the plague is it's death it's the last plague that is hitting and death is in the land and death is in the nation death is in our government death are in the churches death is in families deaths and marriages but i want you to know if you'll dwell in the secret of the most high there will be no evil plague strike your dwelling hallelujah oh glory to god they will not come by your dwelling when the death angel comes and wipes out families brings divorces brings sickness brings trouble brings everything else brother you're hiding under the shadow of the almighty you're in a place that is safe and secure the holy ghost keeps you in the hour of your temptation hallelujah amen amen death ain't coming near you i said death ain't coming near you spiritual death ain't striking this church we're going in the rapture we're going in an exodus [Applause] for he shall give his angel charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways there's an angel been given a charge about you hallelujah i believe i can run and shout right now amen amen he shall give his angels charge over you amen to keep you in all your ways and they shall bear thee up with their hands lest thou that's thy foot against the stone hallelujah jude said it this way in verse 24 not to him that is able to keep you from falling than to present you thoughtless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy hallelujah i'm talking about a church who's predestinated not to fall amen a church who will overcome attacks who is victorious church they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dast thy foot against the stone thou shalt tread uh-oh upon the lion and the abra and the utter the dragon and that shall trample under feet thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder the young lion that's the one with strength not the old lion that's so crippled that you know he can't hardly make it on the young lion amen the and the dragon the child shall trample him under your feet hallelujah brother this is a word to you you will walk unharmed amongst the fiercest powers of darkness trampling every one of them under your feet hallelujah i mean this is the people that the angel has time so far i'm going to cause sickness to be under your feet why you're even going to triumph over death hell in the grave hey man i'm going to change your body in a moment and a twinkling of an eye i'm gonna even bring up the dead that's been in christ we're gonna have a complete total victory and even those we laid around in the grave for seven ages all the way 2 thousand years will come up in young glorified bodies [Applause] why because there's a people that have made him their habitation this will this verse parallels romans 16 20 and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly say it hasn't happened yet brother damn well shortly it will hallelujah amen you know a lot of times people will come to me and they'll say i'll i'll be with you shortly i said you don't have to talk about my height you don't have to make you keep making fun calling me shortly but i'm telling you what right now this is calling me shortly shortly you may look little you may look insignificant you may look like nothing but i tell you shortly i'm gonna put devils under your feet hallelujah you're gonna be more than a conqueror you don't just be a conqueror you're gonna be more than a conqueror little david's gonna bring down goliath he slayed the bear he slayed the lion and now he'll slay goliath hallelujah and besides that the grace the grace the favor of our lord jesus christ is with you the favor is upon you yeah i bless the nomination and i bless them out there and i've done miracles for them but i'm gonna really favor you you're highly favored of the lord because i tell you what that that holy thing that is conceived in the church is of the holy ghost it came not by the works of man but it come by the overshadowing of the holy ghost why is all of this because here's the reason because he has set his love upon me hallelujah amen because he has set his love upon me psalms 91 listen this he said because he has set his love up on me therefore will i deliver him and i will set him on high because he had known my name i have revealed myself to him i am a personal god he knows me by name come on hallelujah amen and we wasn't baptizing some titles we took on the very name of the lord jesus christ amen and what did he say he said he set his love upon me therefore i will deliver them this is why he's going to deliver the bride not because you've worked good you made everything right you did everything perfect you've always been good it ain't that it's because he set his love upon you hallelujah when did he do that amen before the foundation of the world [Applause] he saw you in his mind he shall call on me ha and i will answer him he shall call upon me i'm going to answer his prayers he shall call upon me whatever i ask in his name he's going to do it amen i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him amen i will honor him and there ain't no greater honor than god going with you amen because jesus i walk to the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me i know i miss sheep his rod and his staff comforts me with long life eternal life i will satisfy him and show him my salvation you will enjoy the fullness not partial salvation not a justified walk not a sanctified walk but the fullness of my salvation hallelujah what an hour are we living in what a day that we're in now listen a lot of this hybrid stuff ain't going to make it it won't produce the crop he would save ishmael oh that is not live before then god said i'll bless him but that ain't who i'm after amen i want one that is born not of your human strength i want one born of the supernatural [Music] i don't want one that's borne up by work up or by theology i want one that is born of the holy ghost that make me their habitation that i dwell in and they dwell in me why brother it's time we clean out the nest hey man this time a lot of us start over again but man we we've we've sat on these old eggs long enough throw them all rotten eggs out and start over again but start with the mate hallelujah start with the anointing of the holy ghost start with the power of god amen start there until you've got a nest full of eggs but brother it ain't something that won't hatch it's something to bring forth under the right atmosphere you wonder sometimes why is it that you're gonna have the atmosphere of the holy ghost and the power of god moving the great atmosphere and people sit there rot they didn't get with the mate they're unfertilized that's what's a matter with the churches they don't have they can't believe in the supernatural power because they haven't got nothing to believe with amen but you know how can you get faith out of a person that has nothing to have faith with if you've never been born again in the spirit of god you don't know the first principle of the power of resurrection so therefore again you know it takes a super natural birth god's going to take a supernatural people who believes in a supernatural birth in a supernatural rapture amen and brother when they come forth they're going to come forth with life in them you get some of these and they're born and listen i'm just going to take it for a moment you know you can you can take and and breed a sheep to a goat and they will actually will conceive it's called a gap i've seen a lot of geeks in my ministry they're not shapes or gates and a gape is a cross between us a sheep and a goat and science there's science that as i read upon it there are signs still denied today that won't ever breathe the breath of life said the chromosomes are off they can't do it they all they will bring forth but it'll always be still born and so they will be birthed now you know you can go up and google and whatever else and you might find somebody that claims it but you know there again you know i'm just using it for type let me tell you hybrid is not going to work are you with me a mixing of creeds and mixing a mixing of darkness with with the word is not going to work it's got to be a birth of the word and it's supernatural it is not natural it's supernatural amen and so you know a mother can she can be as loyal as he can be and hover over that age and i see people you know ministers have churches and they're hovering over them and watching over them and you know and they're turning them all the time and you know come on to church and what's the matter with you this week well we were out of peanut butter why didn't you come we were out of peanut butter what did

unconverted said if you can go with me to work if you go with me on my job if you can go with me to to the discount store if you can go with me everywhere i can live right i said i can't go with you everywhere you need the holy ghost and i'll tell you what if you you you get with me amen i can't go with you when you're clothed shopping i it ain't my job even to pick out your clothes to see if

do that and everywhere you turn he'll keep you from falling [Applause] you say brother jim i'm a christian i'm still tempted well yeah duh you're always gonna be tempted temptation is not sin jesus was tempted and didn't fall but i'm no one who can keep you from falling i know a power of the holy ghost if you listen to him you can walk right and talk right and do right but it smell he's gonna bulk it every promise he'll bucket the word he'll take some of it and he'll step into that and he'll balk at another he's a donkey i'm sorry to say it he's a donkey and he bucks at it and you can show him divine healing he'll block his divine healing or maybe he'll take divine healing but he'll block it holiness maybe he'll take this by the word but he won't take it all but i want you to understand
