ministered to them here in the office on a zoom meeting and was able to speak to them their sunday morning service and spoke to them on jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that we're a continuation of the book of acts and i believe god is continuing his work right there in japan they're going out and they're doing mission work and reaching to far out places from their local assembly they're able to meet every sunday they're together and god's blessed them with different ones who can can operate technology and things so we can do something like this so we had a wonderful time with him last night and they of course send their greetings to you today amen they listen in all the time and they listen to every service and so we're there more than what we think but one one day maybe lord willing we can go back again we are looking to help brother danny del mundo to go and spend a couple of weeks there and and uh minister to them and do some work in the outlying areas as well so just be praying about that be happening sometime maybe this year coming up very soon japan's still pretty closed in a lot of ways as far as their coveted restrictions and things and and so we're just asking the lord to open the way where there seems to be no way because i mean governments think they're in control but they're not in control because if there's still a seed of god there and i believe there is god a tear down the walls whatever he has to do to go to them and to minister them and to lift them up and and brother fed there the pastor is doing a wonderful job and appreciate that god placed somebody like that there during this time especially when when we could not go and could not be apart but uh amen they're thriving they're moving forward and we're thankful for that amen so today we don't have any written prayer requests but i know there's a lot of needs here in our local assembly he may want to continue to remember healing for different ones sister ruth and sister nancy herron back there and amen our elderly among us and all of us we need a touch from god this morning i want to really ask again for prayer for brother ron he's been really sick in the last few days i

amen and ask the lord to minister to our hearts how many would say lord come by my way today i need a special touch you want that special touch then reach out and touch the hem of his garment as he passes by and i believe it'll be an action to cause a reaction do you know that you have the power this morning to reach out and touch heaven and stop heaven on your for your behalf that's a powerful

announcement for mariah pruitt and weston davis so they're both here today so we'll have them just come forward here just a moment and uh we're just really happy for this young couple we uh we've seen him i saw him without his parents here you know he's just a young man and without his parents here i didn't i didn't recognize and place who he was and i said who i finally said who is that boy that looks like my grandson andrew who is that boy and finally they you know i found out it was it was uh weston davis and he's of course a grandson of brother bob king my good friend and brother junior davis um again my good friend and they have gone on to be with the lord one's a great grandparent to him and a grandparent so you know um anyway um it was just so great to see this young man come and and enter into the service of the lord and show his joy for the lord and and then i found out there was a fatal attraction and that was to mariah so y'all come on down here just a moment we know what god did in mariah's life and she's a testimony of the grace of god and we so appreciate that and matthew and elizabeth pruitt they've been a part of the church here but matthew's a deacon here and we have been so blessed with um with this family and our church and so to to have our young people you know come to this point as as i said you know when i built this church i said you know as i looked around at our our people our young young people i said well you know they're going to get being married and you know and i said if half of them stay well we're still going to be out of room so you know um we we have some that get to come and they get to stay and we get to have some that you know go on to other churches and become a part of that and they're going to be making their home there at brother donnie reagan's at the happy valley church and we're we really support brother donnie and appreciate him uh i'll send him a message you owe me a big one though amen so we appreciate the lord for his goodness to us and his blessings on us you know friendships through the years you don't know where it's going to lead you to and i made friends with brother bob king many years ago and um you know i can remember karen and i flying into phoenix and and then you know they were an older couple in in the big busy city of phoenix i said now karen i said after we get off this plane here we're going to embark on the most dangerous part of our journey riding with bob king in phoenix he was a country boy and it didn't belong in the city but anyway um you know we we had wonderful times together i remember the time and brother bob just passed on just a little bit ago and one of his last things he was doing was i was listening to one of the sermons that i preached here and and you know just relishing in the presence of god and i remember as we crossed the mountains between um tucson and and phoenix and we were listening to the sermon things that are to be and uh brother branham said something about those uh that those homes that we're going to go to those um those palaces we have he said some are black-headed and brown-headed and blue-eyed and brown-eyed and those are mansions and i stopped the tape and i said brother king i said did you hear what was said he said well yeah no what what are you talking about and i said well i said he said when we go over there our mansions are going to be black-headed and brown-eyed and blue-eyed and why he sure did i've listened to this tape i don't know how many times and i've never heard that before that's amazing i said well you know and he was kind of following a little doctor in the return ministry at the time and kind of had all his eggs in that basket and i said well you know there's a lot of things you hadn't been hearing on those tapes and so that just gave me an opportunity and right there on that mountain drive the lights just came on and revelation struck his heart and and there was a great change that happened for him and for the church there in phoenix and and uh then on for his family and today i feel a part of this great heritage and and and a part of your life western and uh certainly a part of yours mariah amen you are you know such a blessing to us a wonderful couple we're going to pray i could talk all day about this but let's just talk to the lord father we thank you for this young couple today [Music] here coming up in august on the 5th i understand they'll stand before this altar again and say their vows of holy matrimony pledge to one another and go off lord and live together as a couple and the two will become one lord what a privilege it is that we have sons and daughters of god that fall in love with each other and reflect the great bride and groom from heaven i pray lord in anticipation of that day that you'll bless them continue blessing them with health and strength and the plans for their future give them leadership and guidance and keep the hand of satan away from them i commit them to you in your hand in jesus name and bless them in their engagement for your glory amen god bless you congratulations to both of you amen give them a hand folks praise the lord bind us together lord bind us together with course that cannot be broken [Music] bind us together bind us together or bind us together with love let's stand together now [Music] you'll turn with me to romans chapter 4 we'll read from the 16th verse we want to say thank you to our musicians and to all of you that make the worship part of the service the the blessing that it is thank you very much romans 4 and verse 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed notice this all the seed not to that only which is of the law that is of the jewish law and the jews but to all but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all now he's speaking to the romans here and they are gentiles and he credits is now abraham being their father and he says that is written i have made thee a father of many nations before whom before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and call it those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform therefore he was imputed to him for righteousness and the hebrews chapter 11 verse 11 through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable amen god bless you can be seated now this morning we're going to be speaking again concerning el shaddai and we're going to be speaking on of on there of filling every fiber you'll see where we're going here in a little bit but um as we're just making some uh background to this if you notice that doubt and unbelief and of course it's um offspring which is fear they are no benefit for all unbelief is sin and but when but faith is imputed to you for righteousness when we believe god imputes that to you as righteousness and so it puts actually puts righteousness in your account and so paul proclaims that it is a faith and not of works or something you merited and received a reward for doing something good but so that it would be of grace to all his seeds so it wasn't and keeping the law and you get merits for ken for how well you kept the law but it was of faith that it might be by grace to all of his seed and verse 16 declared that abraham is the father of us all verse 17 says as it is written i have made you a father of many nations in the presence of him whom he believed god who gives life to the dead and calls those things that do not exist as though they did now this was el shaddai almighty god given life to the dead who and who calls things that do not exist as already as though they already did and so even right now if you're looking at it god looks at everything is done it is finished so your healing is finished your salvation is finished everything has been provided for you and god calls it it's already done amen and so he acts as though it already exists in time because for him it's already settled and and that is true he called for light and of course light did not exist but he called it as though it did and light came and he called abraham the father of many nations before those nations existed and this was the point that that um paul was making here that that abraham was called our father father of many nations before we even were existing but you see that's god he calls those things which do not exist as though they already did and that's why you can say i am healed before it even happens you say well i need some evidence of my healing faith is the evidence of what you are not seeing you may not see it but your faith is the evidence of that healing you need no other evidence but faith now and of course when hope is gone you still believe so he said be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead this is verse 19. when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of sarah's wombs if you notice this he was not weak in faith and the reason and and not being weak in faith his faith would not consider his body that was dead or the deadness of sarah's womb faith does not consider that that negative faith only considers what god has done amen at calvary he finished it once and for all your healing was provided for your salvation was provided for your children was provided for everything you have need of was provided for and we need no other evidence than faith we believe it and when we believe it god declares that's righteous [Applause] so you want to be righteous with god you got to believe him this is what makes you righteous with god is by believing him he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief now the promise was staggering let me just say it again it was staggering to think a 99 year old man is going to have a child a woman that hadn't had a child since she was a young girl and had this problem all her life and now she's 90 years old and and the whole promise was staggering amen i want you to understand you see the promises of god are always staggering they're beyond the mind they're beyond the ability of reasoning they are young beyond the ability of the flesh amen but they're not beyond the ability of your faith but being strong in faith he gave glory to god hallelujah you see he was already declaring it as though it was when he didn't even see it as yet amen if you want to be righteous with god that's what you have to do you have to declare it already i am i am sinless i am blood wasp i am a child of god i am the rapture under the resurrection life lives on the inside of me i am healed i am delivered i am free and when you declare what god says that's righteousness now he staggered not at the promise of the god through unbelief but was strong in faith given glory to god and being fully persuaded amen that what he had promised god was able to perform it now abraham didn't say now i can make this happen abraham didn't say i can do this he said he was fully persuaded that what else shall i almighty god had promised he was able to do it amen so how did abraham do that when there was no hope for it happened he did it by giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what god had promised god was able to perform it so he did it by dwelling on the promise and god's ability and consider not his body now dead neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb and sarah did the same she simply judged that god was faithful who made the promise amen well you know i'm 90 years old but god's faithful abraham is 99 years old but god is faithful this has never happened before in all recorded history but god is faithful what he promised he is able to perform it we've got to believe that for our body change we got to believe it for every promise of god for the rapture come on we've got to believe that what god promised he is able to do it now this is where she receives strength by judging him faithful by looking at his word and saying it's true and you know i can't i'm not looking at my symptoms if i look at that i'll stagger but i'm looking over here at my god and my god's the almighty god and my god is faithful whatever he said he's faithful he will perform it now as we have been through it god appeared to abraham at the age of 99 genesis 17 1 when abram was the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect so here he introduces self as the almighty god or el said i in the hebrew itself said i meaning the breasted god and this is or this represents or types out the holy ghost from whom we drink life from where where was abraham going to get strength from what the almighty god had said he was going to draw his strength from el shaddai he met with me he stood in my midst i had a personal experience with him he provided for me and gave me a promise and i'm going to believe what that promise said even though i don't have no hope i'm going to believe in hope amen i'm going to start believing in the hulk i'm going to we're going to bring forth a child now else said i was bringing a message full of promises and that's the message that we have received from god in our generation and it was given to us to nurse on until the body changed the the holy ghost says elsa died that we are to drink in with refreshing after refreshing notice again they received strength they were refreshed from el shaddai on the promises of el shaddai this is where they got their strength from they did not give their strength on by considering their body now dead or the deadness that serves when you won't get strength from considering what the doctor said amen what the symptoms are you're not going to get strength from that you'll get depressed you'll be getting worried you get fearful you become afraid but when you consider what god said and that he is able [Applause] now again at this junction it is a junction that we must constantly receive of the holy ghost a constant continual renewing a constant nursing from el shaddai now more than ever before it is why it is why so many are dead without life they aren't nursing daily remember to re if you just walk if you don't walk with jesus every day you're just taking on a denominational life that's all it is organizational life you're just a denominational believer you might come to a message church but you'll act like the baptist or the methodist or presbyterian just have an organizational life amen when you when you there to have a life worthy of the gospel you must follow jesus every day is that right now you see nursing daily it comes in many forms with lots of nutrients amen we got we got far more vitamins than what abraham had come on we got a whole bible full we got a lot more examples than what abraham said we got types and shadows throughout all the bible from the old through the new testament from genesis to revelation amen so again you know we we we have plenty of nutrients amen el shaddai gives life through prayer meetings through altar calls through prayer lines through reading his word hearing his word fellowshipping with the saints singing and worship the family altar at home at work or while driving down the road or when trying when praying in the spirit amen or or you know you turn on the tape there's no limit i want you to understand there's no limit he wants to pour himself into us and now in this age there are more ways to nurse from him than ever before amen we've got to avail ourselves of every chance of every opportunity of every channel that he gives us come on now god gave us gadgets brother branham said to and it recorded his voice amen gave us 1100 tapes i mean your phone is more than for social media and to keep up with the news there's the bible that you can listen to and read there's a message you can listen to and read there's a five-fold ministry around the world that is ministering life encouragement strength and you've got to avail yourself of every channel that he gives us this is why we will be at the church every time the door is open amen we're not denominational christians who comes and sporadically you know and are there sometime or you know here on vacation this other time doing this another time and going all the time come on we are not denominational christians we are dedicated consecrated black wasps such as the daughters of god [Applause] amen so when the doors is open we don't act like baptists on wednesday night and don't show up till sunday and miss half of them we're not denominational christians we don't have an organizational life we have a bright life because we are in bright time with a love affair between us and the bridegroom this is why that we will sacrifice jobs to go to to travel to special meetings with believers this is why we have prayer meetings and bible studies and family altered home and more than ever before we must be connected can i get that word to you connected to the life-giving flow hallelujah keep nursing keep nursing oh brother tim we're not babies we're grown up well even peter types us as newborn babes who desire the sincere milk of the word don't you want the word it's milk amen you say we're not newborns let me tell you friends we we are not now listen to me we're not born of the other ages we are newborn people in this last age who have been introduced to the fullness of god and the open book where that is unlimited in its resources that you can nurse from there any time any place anywhere it is unlimited amen oh well but we're not newborn babes well abraham was 99 years old but to god he was still a baby i want to say in comparison to eternity you might be 65 but i'll tell you what you're a baby in the sight of god you just barely even started into life is that right now in this type you can never quit nursing it's not one and done it's not a sip of the holy ghost once in a while it's not a sip of the holy ghost and it's just a special meeting and then we go through drought times the rest of the time amen no it's expecting amen amen you know a little a little a little kid or lamb or a calf it'll go to his mama there and it'll it'll punch it'll take that that nipple in its mouth and it'll punch at it what's it doing it is causing the flow to start coming down all of your mothers that carry babies and the nurse your baby know what it means for the milk to come down amen and it comes by stimulating and we come in the presence of god and we stimulate him with amens and hallelujah and songs of praise and he starts pouring down the milk and he starts dropping it down in your mouth you'll scream out hallelujah may this be that kind of service where men and women have come prepared and they're punching there and punching and punching and stimulating pour it out lord pour it out give it to me give it to me i need more of you broken cisterns you're old and your strength is gone just lay up on my bosom and nurse your strength from this fountain amen what did he nurse himself to a new body yeah i knew something was pulling on me now so what he nurses himself to a new body you see again he changed abraham back to a young man by again just by holding on to his word hold on [Music] don't let go of it take a hold of that promise amen pulled strength from el shaddai his words of spirit and life without the word you have not the spirit and without the spirit you have not the word so we got the full word and no spirit you don't have the full word you say well we got the spirit of no word come on the doctrine ain't right you don't have the spirit amen they're both one and the same so as he said in god's covenant confirmed or abraham's covenant confirmed so he gave him his own name abraham when he did that the next thing after he did after he give him that name placed out on his name what'd he do he gave him a sign that he was absolutely ready to absolutely destroy all sin that was around him and i want you to listen to his words and positionally put his body in condition to receive the promised son that he waited on amen exactly what he's done to the church notice what he said he positionally put his body in condition to receive the promised amen now remember it it quickens your mortal body romans 8 11 put that up for me romans 8 11 he quickens your mortal body i want you to understand it makes your mortal body alive to god and dead to sin amen but it's more than just a mental knowledge it is even more than a work in the soul and i'm going to show you the quotes for this it's more than just the soul it's your body your physical body that's going to be changed already starts a chain starts in amen oh my it quickens your mortal body but if the spirit of him is that the holy ghost is that else said i the almighty god that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you come on he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen so now for those who say the holy ghost comes without feeling or without knowing it here's how brother branham demonstrated this in the easter seal he said you are quickened this is 1965 just months before he would leave and he said this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already your body gets in a raptured condition hallelujah amen what do you think that is happening there when you shout and rejoice and you dance in the spirit and you speak in a heavenly language and what are you thinking your body is getting in a raptured condition hallelujah it's a quickening up it's a life-giving power what's what he said already notice the pentecostal people up there they got quickened by the holy spirit listen to me when those pentecostal group up there on the day of pentecost receive their abstract deed from god sure it glorified their souls oh it glorified their souls brother tim you're you're missing it listen he said sure it glorified their soul they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon them and it so quickened their body till they couldn't even speak in an earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a heavenly language the place that they're going to hallelujah quickening power of god shook their mortal bodies so their entire mortal language was transfigured mortal language transfigured transformed into an immortal language what a quickening power if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal body it shall also quicken your mortal bodies we are quickened them by the power of the living god tongues quicken to a new heavenly language to speak to them a rapturing up listen a rapturing up raising them up into a different atmosphere than they ever lived in what in the world you think is happening with a man or a woman that gets touched by the power of god and they react to it and they run or scream or shout amen hallelujah or if there's nothing but just like hattie wright said it's nothing but the truth amen whatever it was and what happened was you see it quickened them listen ray's rapturing up raising them up into a different atmosphere than what they had ever lived in hallelujah also with the new quickening life to them that came in on them that could that come on them it quickened their language they spoke with new tongues oh yes now watch them it was designed to give them after this abstract it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds watches every promise that was on the grounds so you see they didn't have to just take one thing luther took justifications and that's all we want to eat wesley said sentimentation that's all we want to eat or we'll have a little bite of justification too but and then azusa street said well we'll have the gifts give us a platter of gifts come on but there's more to it amen brother branham was saying there's more two tongues more than comes to the pentecostal people and you say but we've got the word brother tim then the word that has everything that's on the ground and there is justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost gifts of the spirit speaking in tongues divine healing and working of miracles faith hallelujah every bit of it lays there hallelujah you can sit at his table today and say pass me some divine healing i need him pass me a dose of holy ghost i need a refreshing pass me a big piece of that pie i won't i walk but the love of god a glory of jesus in my life hallelujah it gives you everything on the grounds [Applause] now it was designed to give them every promise on the ground every promise on the grounds of god's word that was promised in the bible that quickening power was given to them to quicken that promise to them el shaddai was right there quickening by the words he spoke to abraham of faith to start believing oh did he smell my ah i didn't call ishmael i'm gonna bring isaac he's gonna be a child of the supernatural won't be your own ability it'll be a child of the supernatural and so he said he said therefore therefore they laid hands on the sick and they were healed they spoke in new tongues they did great signs and wonders because that was in god's promise and when jesus tried to redeem that back to them the grounds that belonged to the sons of god he demonstrated what god was so all you have to do is look and see what god was you can see him he was a healer a worker of miracles a savior to save from sin amen giving of doctrine of truth amen all of it he gave it all come on you just look back at the ministry of jesus christ and the same attitude that he had then is the same attitude he has now that was thou shalt i then this is how said i now and he's the same at every detail except now he's not dwelling in that corporal body he's now living in the body of his church and when jesus died to redeem that back to them the ground that belonged the sons of god he demonstrated what god is how dare we socialize that and put it to an organization we have no rights to do that how dare we say how dare we say that this is only for the pentecostal denominations the assembly god or the upc you have no right to put that in organization it is an experience amen pentecost is not a denomination our prophet told us over and over it is an experience you cannot hand it back and say that belongs back there to the assembly of god in the upc and the azusa movement the church of god and all the organization you cannot put it back there you have to look at it and say that is ours every promise on the ground amen how dare we to minimize that power that quickens the body until it overflows with such joy that our feet can't keep still our hands can't help but be raised amen are the tears are just overflowing and the mouth is speaking with both the heavenly language and an earthly language glorifying god hallelujah as he said it's the holy spirit today hunting out on his hearts that will believe that message everything in the bible that was promised is through that believer somebody say everything everything that was promised is to that believer you say brother jim why tell you what you're doing is you're advocating gifts and miracles and signs and wonders no i'm advocating the full word every divine promise if it's in there it's mine not just the doctrines of the message the life of the message hallelujah every bit of it is mine and when you accept it in its fullness and god knows you'll do it he'll give you the abstract to that and then every promise that's made is in your possession and the holy spirit is there to quicken that to you what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see the great holy spirit here to do that power think of it when the holy ghost itself here to bear witness of this hour jesus said so he's the same yesterday today and forever how dare any man to wipe that out of there hallelujah the works that i do shall you do also and they try to wipe it out by saying that was only for the prophet come on amen that's not the truth the the truth is is to every believer amen the signs that follow them that believe if god can get you to believe then all things are possible the works that i do you will do them and greater than these because i'm going to do it in a multi-membered body amen hallelujah on earth i could have but one prayer line now you can have prayer lines all over the world amen come on amen greater works you say brother brother tim brother tim my greater work should speak in the word let me tell you just do these other works first and then we'll worry about you speaking the word just start doing what you can do lay hands on the sick and they shall recover come on amen cast out devils in my name amen you can have it it's yours it belongs to you you're the children of the most high god how jerry any man to wipe that out oh this when we see a group of people sitting together and those signs manifesting themselves that's the assurance the abstract is there to vindicate that's property of god you know what god did to us in this day when he ripped the seals off the book he was clearing the deed he was giving the church an abstract hallelujah an abstract that means that the deed the title was searched and every debt against it was wiped off [Applause] amen god sent a prophet to do a title search and he searched back of the handing of the book down from the different ages and the liens that was against it the depths of the trinity doctrine the depths of unbelief and faults doctrine down to the ages and false baptism but god in this day and hour took the book and loosed the shield cleared the deed and gave the church an abstract [Applause] that means the devil ain't got no claim on this bride [Applause] amen come on he might be able to keep the lutheran hayes from having a rapture because of their trinity doctrine he might have had did the same with wesley and keep them from having a rock but he can't keep up and have a rapture hallelujah we've got the debt paid in full and cleared the blood the holy spirit has been put on every false doctrine i'll open the book to you and me that false doctrine itself days of miracles would pass that false doctrine said that god don't heal no more that's about doctrine that says there [Applause] you talk about a fourth of july celebration and fireworks going on there ought to be fireworks going off in the house of god you've got an abstract to this message that everything against us have been wiped off hallelujah take a moment just worship god your debt is clear i said your debt is clear even so much so clear until he said you never did it in the first place you are justified that i am righteous because you believe you're on the ground and you believe every promise is yours that's righteousness amen and take a seat for a moment and it is the horizon of the sun now this is the easter message it is the rising of the sun in april just before it be his last easter sermon and he said listen close now i'm trying to show you you're ready for what he's trying to show the quickening power wasn't only in their soul that was through the you know death we don't want it brother we don't want it we don't want it we don't want no manifestation we don't want no fleshly demonstration we don't want it we don't want somebody shouting and jumping and speaking in tongues we don't want them blabbering screaming youngins in our church amen listen he said the quickening power wasn't only in their soul but it was all over them all over them amen not only the dynamics to come in to quicken but it quickened the mechanics you see what i mean they were so quick until their tongues began to speak in another language they were so quickened by the power of the resurrection of christ until they laid their hands they were so quick and with the quickening power until they laid their hands on the sick and they got well it quickened your mortal body [Applause] hallelujah amen what did we see when we when we saw mariah get healed hair got to going back the glory returned what did we see we saw her mortal body quicken what happened when atlanta ran all over this building amen what happened that day it quickened her mortal body hallelujah are you with me amen what happened when sister karen's sight came back and the glory of god moved over and little drew jumped up and ran around the room never had walked before never crawled before got him all by himself what happened it quickened his mortal body [Applause] hallelujah they were healed by laying on their hands and the spirit quickened their fellowship together with god the spirit quickened their fellowship with god and they were so quickened in the presence of god to when a person died and their soul had gone off it called him back to life again amen glory now i'm feeling religious that's right quicken not only was there his resurrection for himself but for whosoever will to this predestinated seed that's laying there quick it quickens the mortal body they laid hands on the sick and they s they recovered they prayed in the spirit they saw visions that called the dead back to life that's right it quickened their mortal body now here's his prayer for the church at the end of the sermon it is the horizon of the son you want to know the prayer he prayed over you may then father if they're sick may they walk out well may if they're crippled they walk out under the power of the holy spirit if they've been sinners may they walk out lost and clean and the mechanics by going in the dynamics from above the holy spirit and catch them away lord and quicken their mortal body then we shall hear genuine new tongues and powers of god love and told dying grace and living grace and a resurrected christ a body of bride representing him on the earth hallelujah you've been prayed over hallelujah the prophet prayed over you amen quicken their mortal bodies quicken now now now the holy ghost gives faith for the rapture faith for the rapture lays within the holy ghost the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost it lies within the life-giving flow from how shady i when it's received in its fullness now listen church and here's a danger we are living in a an awful age and it's an age where there's scoffers not only scoffers there's impersonators and these impersonators also scoff and cause the word to be scoffed at now i want to get this we've been preaching a bit evangelistically now i want to i want to deal with this scripturally for a moment because we cannot look and see how the devil has impersonated this experience and cheapen the gift of speaking in tongues and the nine spiritual gifts and then dismiss that and take it from your inheritance we cannot do that you cannot preach the open book and part of it missing you cannot say the true or the true understanding of godhead is important baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ is a necessary part predestination and knowing we were in his thoughts before the foundational world and all that's necessary part but then speaking in tongues is not are the gifts of the spirit which that's just the least to be against any of the word is antichrist but you say but brother tim it's been impersonated it's been so impersonated standing in the gap now this is at the end the age that we're living in where we come through justification sanctification baptism in the spirit holy spirit had signs and wonders and all different things and the gifts has returned to the church such as divine healing and prophecy and speaking with tongues and interpretation and though it's been misrepresented terrifically this is this is after the seal stand in the gap jeffersonville sermon but yet that don't take away there is a good one there is a good one of a real genuine a gift to speak in tongues in tongues that's always supposed to be in the church now though it's been misrepresented terrifically there is a genuine gift that is always supposed to be in the church now listen listen we have what has happened in this age is a resisting of the truth if you'll talk with me in second timothy 3 and 7 the bible said they're ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth all they learn doctrines and this and that but they don't ever never know the knowledge of the truth because the knowledge of the truth is jesus christ to know him as life now janice and jamborees withstood moses now i want you to know we're standing against the true prophet so does these also resist the truth so the bible is telling you truth is going to be resisted men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith but they said proceed no further for their folly shall be made manifest in all men as theirs was also was now i want you to get this god sends moses down to israel now remember it was the coming of the lord it was he said i have come down to deliver them he meets them in a pillar of fire he said i have come down to deliver them so it was the coming of the lord now what did they see a prophet with a message from the pillar of fire that's what we've received in this day a message from the pillar of fire amen why because god has come down amen from heaven with a shout with a message are you with me amen now i want you to notice god gave him signs to prove he was from god now notice this he would come he said jehovah sent me and here's the science and at first the israelites rejoiced when they heard the message of god exodus 4 30 and aaron spake all the words which the lord had spoken to moses and did the signs and the sight of the people and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had delivered or visited the children of israel and that he looked upon their afflictions then he they bowed their heads in worship so the first response on seeing the signs this is of god and it's for our deliverance is that right and they believed but now the resistance of the truth was caused by the impersonation of the miracles and it hardened the hearts of the egyptians didn't it not it also hardened our hearts to the israelites and made them to disbelief exodus 5 21 and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because you have made our savior to be a horde in the eyes of pharaoh so here they come and said here in the eyes of pharaoh and his servants had put a sword in their hand to to say is what you have done is put a sword in your hand didn't deliver us at all you just put a sword in their hand exodus 14 12 and look again they referred back to this and said is this not the word that we did tell thee in egypt say it let us alone that we may serve the egyptians look at these here again these people after seeing the signs but then the impersonators came and they changed their whole tune about the signs no longer are they believing because they're signs they're saying we told you just leave us alone in our denominational egypt amen but you you brought us out because there was no graves in egypt and he said you've made us to be abhorrent in the eyes of pharaoh we you made a mockery out of us all by showing his signs so they began believing but the impersonation caused them to resent the signs watch now i want you to see the strong delusion caused by the resistance of truth by impersonating the signs that even called israel the seed of abraham and the children of the promise to begin to doubt it cheapened the gifts of god and its signs and wonders until they didn't want them and the same thing has happened in our day the same thing happened in our day the very signs that brother branham was sent to do to show us that the word was present to deliver us that i met with the pillar of fire by the time the impersonation started to happen among the pentecostals it cheapened it to the point that today some of the seed of abraham the message believers don't even want to sign now let me just tell you they knew it was being cheapened john g lake said that you know just a few years after azusa street and he was one of the elders at azusa street he said you know our tongues have become a bit rattly and they don't sound right they come right down i just listened to a testimony of brother valdez senior from the full gospel business man this is in january 1968 now he was contemporary with isaac shakarian he was father of demon security he was 10 years old he was 10 years old at azusa and isaac karen was 14. and then and this is his testimony now he's at the gospel businessmen and he's seeing a proliferation of tongues among them he's seeing baptists and methodists in this episcopalian and all of them begin to speak with tongues and listen this is what brother branham had problem there was no holiness there they still write on would would not submit to the word bob and hair pain in her face dressing like jezebel had their shorts on cross-dressing doing all the things come on and yet claiming the holy ghost and speaking in tongues at the drop of a hat until it cheapened the gift of god and i'm trying to get it to you until it made it so cheap till the seed of abraham didn't want it now valdez says brother valdez he was there 10 years old at azusa street when the power of god fell 62 years ago in los angeles and this is 1968 that our hearts were open to what god was taking place and oh what a glorious experience it was and if you ask me this question brother valdez what is it after all these years of watching this wave of pentecost all over the world and what is it today that concerns you more than anything and this is my answer we have seen wave after wave of the power of god accompanied with healings and miracles and we thank god for our healings and signs and wonders and all those things but as we approach this very soon coming of the lord jesus christ and the terrific things that are going to take place proceeding is coming this one thing concerns me more than anything else let us not forget the most important thing of all remember this i believe in speaking in tongues i believe in gifts of the spirit i believe in manifestations of the power of god and i don't enjoy a dead pentecostal meeting however i know this is that saint paul if saint paul was trying to tell us anything more than anything else in first corinthians 11 12 13 and 14 he's telling us that no gift is a true standard of deep spirituality now stop for a moment janice and jambrice were magicians and they impersonated and threw their rods down and they become a serpent they didn't do that by the power of satan he can't create they did that by the power of god god allowed it for the hardening of hearts yes to bring a strong delusion not hold the thought now and and so this is it he said no gift is a true standard of deep spirituality now they had gifts they could even turn water into blood like moses did they they could stand there and bring plagues like moses did right yes amen they could cast their serpent their rod down and become a serpent like moses did the only thing moses swallowed theirs up their folly was made manifest but nevertheless you know no true gift or no gift is a true standard of deep spirituality hear it folks there is no gift that is a true standard of deep spirituality he said you can have all these gifts and if you haven't got the love of god it profits you nothing now we're approaching the coming of jesus and the thing as far as i'm concerned it is more important than anything else is holiness without which no man shall see the lord and pentecost was losing their holiness wouldn't it be a terrible thing to be correct doctrinally on the second coming and everything else and then be lost this is what he's warning this is a people and he goes on to say listen folks the most important thing from now on is the fruit of the spirit oh my god help us not to forget it listen in the midst of our shouting you can become so obsessed with the idea i've got to speak in tongues the first thing you know the big thing is speak in tongues and and that's what they did they made that the important thing it was more important than repentance it was more important than holiness it was more important than anything else as long as we speak in tongues we got the holy ghost and i want you to understand he said you become obsessed with the idea i've got to speak in tongues the first thing you know the big things that speak in tongues a brother came to me and he said you know i had a hard time receiving the baptism until a certain preacher come along and he showed me how easy it was and he says well all you have to do is start with one syllable and say da and keep saying da and then he said add another syllable and say do and then you say da do and then he said another one and say add another one and say da du di da du de and he said say that again brother that's wonderful wonderful you know dottie d daddy d daddy d oh hallelujah you received the baptism he said brother is an old-fashioned preacher with 52 years of pentecostal preaching behind me as far as i'm concerned those folks have that receive that that kind of experience only have a lot of da duty the bible still says your innermost being shall flow rivers of living waters say can you say man hey hallelujah i said rivers of living waters hallelujah that was his testimony amen what was this point you see it's not something you manufacture it's not something you work up it's out of your innermost being shuffler rivers not of wd not of an impersonation but the holy ghost overflowing in you hallelujah speak it out in your life glorifying god impersonations have done the same today until the mixed multitude of among believers say we don't want the anointing we don't need it you know because of the anointed ones at the end time remember the anointing was not sent for the terror it was sent for the wheat and just because the tear raised its hands up and dances and shouts because the rain don't mean we don't have the right to raise up our hands and dance and shout hallelujah because that rain was sent for us not the tariffs i want to submit to you we are the anointed ones at the end time the true anointed first john 2 and 7 but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you this anointing a man abideth in you that you need not any man treat you but the same anointing teaches you of all things and it's a truth and there's no lie and even as it taught you you shall abide in him that's first john 2 27 so you see the anointing that you receive abideth in you it's more than an anointing that comes and goes but this anointing that abides within you and you don't need anybody to say now that sin and that sin don't do this and don't do that and go with you to the grocery store to the clothing store and pick out your clothes amen but no he abideth in you and he teaches you all things and you shall abide in him now easter seal brother branham said while we're right at an easter when he raised we raised with him he sent the abstract back we hold it as a baptism of the holy ghost he is alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever hebrews 38 proves that he is the same his messianic his anointed ones believe that what is the messiah what is messiah messiah is the anointed one and now if he was the messiah but being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer and the anointed one and god raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day hallelujah i'm looking at a bunch of anointed ones anointed with the holy ghost amen not a holy ghost that comes and goes but it abides with you forever hallelujah i can hear him say and and who do you say this is give me a church that's so completely anointed with god until their ever action and move it's just saith the lord walk in that shekinah glory and i'll show you a messiah an anointed one upon the earth hallelujah he says in christ the mystery of god revealed that there would come a time he would express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminent church the anointed man now the anointed people oh to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom hallelujah you see that's it we have the anointing amen and of his anointing we have received grace upon grace and that anointing breaks the yoke of unbelief and doubts and fears come on causes us to believe but we can become reluctant to embrace signs and wonders and yet the signs and wonders of casting out devils and speaking new tongues laying hands on the sick and seeing them recover or to follow them that believe just because we find a bogus hundred dollar bill we can't allow counterfeits to cause us to burn our money that's right amen we cannot allow impersonators to cause us to despise the signs that god has given us we cannot disbelieve the signs why am i saying this because we must believe all the word amen it must saturate our entire being it must fill every fiber and to do this we must have all the word of god mark 16 20 what's this and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them confirming the word with signs following this is what is to happen after we preach the word amen the word confirmed with signs following you say brother tim you don't need confirm brother branham it was confirmed in him let me it was confirmed in jesus so we didn't need brother branham if you're going to lose use that reasoning come on jesus did it all your bodies will become a denominational baptist church of christ you must be against the anointing amen they went for them priests everywhere and the lord was working with them confirming the signs with signs following hallelujah hebrews 2 and 4 god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will god burying them witness god's going to bear the church witness the signs will follow them that believe this is the day again where the word is incarnate in a people as it was in christ 2 000 years ago and it's now being rejected now yeah let me just stop for a minute remember that's laodicea i stand at the door knock he's on the outside the church and they put him out is that right now i want you to know you see it's the fullness of the holy ghost that we have received not a portion it's the fullness of the word that we have received not a part no part of the book is closed it is even more than the first age for now it's the full word in bride form getting ready for a rapture are you with me the fullness of the godhead in the bride christ in bride form i want you to look it's lined up online and brother branham uses the scripture in the seals after the seals and before the seal in isaiah 28 10 for precept must be upon precept we cannot deny any precept with the truth precept upon precept line up online we cannot disclude any part of it they might hear a little and dare a little for his tamarind lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith he calls the weary to rest and this is refreshing yet they would not hear it oh this is a refreshing the refreshing is lined up online lying up online precept upon precept and stammering lips with other tongue i'll speak to this people and this is the wrath speaking of the holy ghost that would come paul would refer back to this scripture as being speaking in tongues by the holy ghost you see it's the hour of joel's prophecy i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh my sons and daughters shall prophesy they shall dream dreams and they shall see visions amen now and turn on the light brother brandon said did you know realize we've moved on from that we are in bride time i mean believe we're in bride time the selecting time the time the bride that said we would have all that the caterpillar left joel 2 28 all the caterpillar the palmer worm eaten the palm worm left the locust eaten you see it's restoration power somebody with me mighty god unveiled he said it this way in joel 2 28 he promised in the last day there'd be a ladder rain poured out upon the people in the last day i think the greek word there is kinos which means he emptied himself out hallelujah this is a day he empties himself out in other words we receive all of god not just one doctrine of truth like luther had but the entire word revealed back again and with the entire word comes the entire power amen notice he said he emptied himself out not in the way he was said like something was inside of somebody that he emptied out but he poured himself out he changed him his morphine he changed from what he was to what he is he never changes his nature but on the day of pentecost he changed himself from being the son of man to the son of god and he came not he came not with the people he came in the people see the same god to carry his ministry on through in this great age amen pouring out his spirit into every fabric to every fiber of our lives i'm telling you there's still more fibers within you to be filled with god [Applause] in the message oneness he said you've got to get with the word and get yourself killed out i'm persuaded many of us friends have received the holy ghost but we receive just enough holy ghost to make us to a place we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything amen but god wants to fill every fiber of his church listen it's god wants to feel every fiber of you not just get you aware that you listen out you'll stop this for a minute this is what he said in the message paul a prisoner he said what did moses do he said there with his campaign and things that he tried to do in his self-effort what did he do he killed one egyptian he did not deliver the people [Music] amen he killed one egyptian he said maybe may the man live true to his wife you see that's as good as denomination can take you but he said he didn't deliver the people and he said that's what we've done with our campaigns and are adding to church and a million more than 44 and they this great revivals of the past he said made somebody look good conform people listen this is more that get you conformed this is about you getting transformed are you with me it is more than just being a good message member and we have a church called message church it's more than that amen there is a deliverance a complete and total deliverance that must be in this day that delivers the bride from this world of egypt and takes her in a rapture and to do that god wants to fill every fiber of your church of his church he wants to feel your thinking he wants to fill your mind amen he wants to feel every bit of you and just make you so completely ted totally dead yourself you're thinking until you're so surrendered in god till his words just living right through you you don't know nothing else but god's word you stay right with his word it's life my words are light said jesus and he plays with them teachers believe in the bible prophets that say the truth that showed the same prophecy they always did down to the age what is he doing he's showing himself alive among them confirming his word his word the kingdom of god is god's word made power again he see he goes on on there and picks up that story and said here we are at the end time and we're coming from the east and the west and the north and the south there's been a great call went out come on church amen and it gathered some of you here and some of that but to the word that's where it's gathering you remember what are we doing getting ready for that rapture getting ready for holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the holy ghost then she'll go up you want jesus to come back you're tired of this sinful world you want the rapture to happen i mean you want the resurrection to take place amen we got to hold ourselves steady a man for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the holy ghost then she'll go up oh my calling his people to gather to himself in one true oneness with himself because it is his one holy spirit eat the book eat from el shaddai the whole book and then prophesy and then preach the whole book that's all i'm asking let's just preach the whole book come on but you see in that hour there also comes a strong delusion and a resistance to the truth now you see all satan needs to do is to get us to deny one word of the bible to be true and to refuse it to allow in our in our life to work in our lives that's the same as denying it come on amen listen listen well you said brother tim we believe we believe in healing we just don't preach it listen it won't work it's got to be preached are you with me you've got to prophesy the whole book [Applause] so what we we believe in the gifts but you know they're on the shelf well i doubt you even got a shelf but nevertheless you know if they're on your shelf for crying out loud get them off and use them they wasn't given to you to store in the jewelry box they were given to gil keep the church clean to chase out devils with to bring words of encouragement give faith in the hearts of believers to bring healing to the sick to cast out devils to speak in heavenly language to pray in the spirit to sing in the spirit [Applause] but in this hour there comes a strong delusion and a resistance to the truth all satan needs to do is to get us to deny one word of the bible to be true for today you might agree that's true oh yeah it happened and brother branham stopped but what about today well no that was only you see you become church of christ amen and and i'm i'm speaking about alexander campbell's church of christ where you're against the anointing because you say it all happened in brother branagh's ministry and we don't need it now i don't know who we are but i'm not part of you amen but anyway you see all he needs to do is get us to deny one word of the bible or refuse it to work now laodicea is the last church agent is to be blind and satan comes along with that blindness until christ the anointing and the word is refused entrance go with me to revelations 3 17 but thou saith i am rich i'm increased with goods i have needed nothing and no it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now i want you to notice in the day in the day when god pours out his spirit there is also a blindness that comes in that same age look at what is happening here laodicea the last expression of deity to the church the amen of god the final say the full word and it gets rejected by his own church now watch i want you to notice in the day when god pours out of spirit i want to read joel 2 23 because brother branham constantly pointed us back to joel chapter 2 as happening today this is the latter rain now in joel 2 23 be glad you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately he will cause come down for you the rain to form a rain and the latter rain in the first month the floors should be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil don't sound like a time of starvation does it amen it's a full crop it's harvest time there's plenty and i will restore to you the years that the locusts the cancer war and the caterpillar and the palmer my great army which i sent among you now if you stop here just for a minute this was originally spoke to israel about their captivity and their restoration but it was speaking to israel spiritual israel also that there would be a come a time of restoration there would be four insects which would be as you saw the locust the cankerworm the caterpillar and the palmer worm all of these all of these four insects would go forth these are the same as the spirits under the seal a white horse a red a black and a pale now they would ride there would be an army and they would strip away the promises of god from the church brother branham would go at great lengths and he said some of that was joy that would strip off the tree healing he would strip off the tree working some miracles and he'd strip off the tree he would strip the bride tree down but he says i will restore saith the lord amen and ye shall eat in plenty amen and be satisfied hallelujah said eyes not going to run out and praise the name of the lord your god that it that wonders with you and my people shall never be embarrassed i'm not gonna let them down when they need healing it's gonna be there when they need the holy ghost it's gonna be there hallelujah amen when they need deliverance it's gonna be in the house of god come on hallelujah my people shall never be left holding the bag and standing there empty-handed but every promise that i have is going to be yours [Applause] and you will know that i'm in the midst of my bride and i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterwards i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see vision and upon the servants upon my handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wonders in the heavens and the earth and blood and fire and pillars of smoke and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon in the blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion that's the bright yes and in jerusalem that's israel and in the remnant that's the foolish virgin 144 thousand whom the lord shall call there's going to be deliverance in all three of those places are you with me now peter picks up on this and he preaches this and he says this coming of the holy ghost which brother branham said was el shaddai the almighty god coming down to live in them to do in them what they couldn't do their self and he says now he said this is that which the prophet joel spoke of amen now brother branham comes along and he also declares this is that and he adds to it if this ain't that i'll keep this till that comes is that right but i want you to notice in acts chapter 2 and verse 20 again it says the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord shall come now the notable day of the lord is the time of tribulation and there is going to be a time of darkness in the time where great light is coming this is what brother madam preached us in shalom he said his darkness to the world and they're keeping on getting darker he said look at the darkness there in the homosexuals and what is happening with them the perversion he said even they wear blue blue suede with purple shoes and you know he's just talking about a feminine dressing are you with me amen don't let me just tell you this there there is there is there is perhaps physical darkness that will come upon the earth during the tribulation like in the days of the plague upon egypt but the spiritual darkness will come first i want you to get this this is very pertinent to the hour we're living in that before before right here before the the great and dreadful day comes there's going to come a time of spiritual darkness on the earth and it'll get blacker than you ever saw it would get so black for brother branham said he said i couldn't see beyond 77 and we're now how many years into the hour of darkness now so as i said i'm not trying to do away with physical darkness perhaps there will come you know a darkness over the earth but let me just say there is a spiritual darkness that is here now now remember christ is being rejected and the last place he's been made welcome is the bride and i'm just saying let's be careful not to reject him in the closing of the gentle jewish dispensation they became so blinded by satan the sun and the moon the light of god became darkness so that in that darkness they rejected and crucified the messiah and the gospel turned to the gentiles that's how dark it was now peter said on the day of pentecost this is that and there was there was a spiritual darkness right then on the earth and they crucified their messiah under the cover of darkness and rejected him they there the mother they're in the most holy city they the most holy people crucified the most awful punishment him the lord of glory now this very same thing happens at the pouring out of the spirit in the end time now it happens as joel 2 repeats until there's such a strong delusion until the light becomes so dark sun in the moon that represents the light of both night and day and the word becomes so obscure until they crucify the word they can't crucify the man so they crucify now the word and put it to an open shame and christ is on the outside of the church rejected and the gospel turns back to the jews now are you with me now now brother branham tells us in the indictment he said today there is a new calvary in this time of darkness there is a new calvary and he said where where is it found at in the most holy places the church where is he crucified at from the pastors amen and he calls them you hypocrites you know better than that that i'm not angry but something inside of me is stirring god has been thoroughly identified among you where did he get his spears that is in his side where did he get his piercers on calvary where did he get it today in the pulpit where did they come from jerusalem where do they come from the denomination the ones who claim that love him that that's who did it so christ is being crucified from the pulpit listen we are going to stand for him in this pulpit we're not going to crucify the lord of glory we're going to say he's the saint yesterday today and forever we're going to declare he's alive that he's not dead hallelujah but he's living among us you say brother tim it's just the denomination no he said i indict the denomination and many of the independence there are many today even in message pulpits that are crucifying jesus christ afresh his hardest spear points have come from the pulpits that criticize don't go hear such stuff as that don't want our kids going to that youth camp come on amen and it's called the devil where from the pulpits men stand in the pulpit oh to fall out under the spirit that's only demons do that well they did it all the time in john wesley and brother brannon said it was a holy ghost amen they did it when it happened when john fell at his feet it's dead it happened in daniel's day it happened all down to the bible come on amen they stood in the presence of god and couldn't stand amen and then the call that the devil is blaspheming me and it's crucifying the lord of glory are you with me where he's getting the hardest pierces from the pulpit crowned from the audience by scoffers he's got a new crown of thorn scoffers pierced from the pulpit crowned by the scoffers is he crucified again stripped by or striped by man-made creeds teachers of denominations against the word they stripe it in shame condemn it so you see if there's a crucifixion of christ today it is not physical it is spiritual the word is being crucified the spirit is being rejected and any place or pulpit that rejects or crucifies a word that scuffs it healing shouting rejoicing dancing to the spirit prayer lines according to revelation 11 they are spiritually called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified amen in hebrews 6 he says they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open chain now let me just show you in matthew 27 verse 45 at the sixth hour there was darkness over the land unto the ninth hour so at the crucifixion of christ there was darkness yes over the land are you with me now so if that is so and he's being crucified again then what is it darkness has now come over the land today now in this darkness a strong delusion arises notice brother branham in junction at a time as he moses goes down to egypt he took his stomach stuff her stick and he cast it down he healed with his hands with leprosy and done those things and then i want you to notice every time the miraculous done satan was there to counterfeit it and as he was counterfeited in that day he's still the same counterfeiter today and his counterfeits only point to the end time at the junction he had some old soul sayers down there by the name of janice and jamboree who stood up and they could throw their rods down turn them the serpents and so forth and do just like they did but god vindicated who was god's they could bring pledge but they couldn't perform divine healing so only god alone can heal they could bring a boil but they couldn't take it away god stood in his power there to show that real divine healing was his miraculous to prove the omnipotent was at the junction road yes amen now so again he goes right on down through this and he talks about it that that here at this very time he said the moon shall fail to give her light and the sun won't shine will turn as black as sackcloth and like blood and when she hides her face and weeps herself and sweats out dropping bloody drops of grief god will be on the earth omnipotent doing the miraculous so when this happens god will be on the earth when the light is held back from the church and rejected god will be doing on the earth omnipotent doing the miraculous hallelujah so just as there was darkness in that day there's darkness coming upon the land in this day creeping right in a blinded delusion so deluded to christ and rejected and satan sits within the church and is worshipped as god for ii thessalonians 2 and three and four tells us this but i want you to look at verse 10 of second thessalonians 2 2 10. it says with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish my what deception because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them a strong delusion because they didn't love truth that day god sent him a strong delusion that they would believe a lie now of course you see this is where we're at that people are today under a strong delusion under the shadow of darkness amen now go with me to revelation 9 1 and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven to the earth and the hymn was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there roses smoke out of the pit as a smoke of a great furnace it wasn't a little smoke it was a smoke of a grapefruit and look the sun and the air that's atmosphere were darkened by the reason of the smoke of the pit and they came out of the pit or either smoke locusts or demons listen when this atmosphere was created demons began to come out of it notice the sun and the sun was blackened the sun is the light of the word and the word was rejected and when it happened it it comes now black and then with a strong delusion black in the light of the word where you can't see clearly the word of god and what is promised and it's disdained and unwanted come on church amen and out of there it causes something to happen in the air and the atmosphere becomes charged with demons spirits of affliction oh my we could read all about it brother branham said they were supernatural chargers demons writing coming to torment men this is what is happening in right now it only gets worse when the tribulation starts right now hell has opened its mouth right now the atmospheres are being charged what do you think is happening in the atmosphere of our school they're charged with every kind of blackness of sin evil perversion of every kind i mean teaching kids it can be become a cat or a dog put a litter box there for them i mean teaching them you know uh castigating them because of you using the gender pro death pronoun that they were born with insanity and it's happening in politics where our supreme court justice could not even define a woman she couldn't i'm not a biologist well a stupid human being would know whether you're a boy or girl amen this is a basic but it's insanity and it kills a third part in other words there's a temporary adjustments that are poured out on the earth a third part of the men are killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone that open out of their mouth that's verse 18. so you see it brings death i'm telling you the atmosphere is charged to bring death spiritual death your word about covet covet is not the killer spiritual death is the killer and it only becomes worse in the tribulation in the tribulation revelation 6 12 and when it opened the sixth seal which is tribulation seal there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as exactly of hair and the moon became his blood amen and the stars fell into the earth even as the fig tree casted her untimely figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind listen when in the tribulation the the the sun becomes blacker than ever this is what it says it said black is a sackcloth of hair this this is a description it has come to where there is no light because that's the way the laodicean age ends no light goes out into total darkness and the stars of heaven fell into the earth as a fig tree casters are untimely fish when she's shaken out of a mighty wind now there may be spiritual darkness or physical darkness sure but but for sure there is spiritual darkness look at the stars of heaven fall to the earth think of that for a moment one star not stars one star would annihilate the earth one true star ball of fire would totally disintegrate the earth watch now one star would annihilate so these are not all the stars fallen these are angels falling in revelation 9 1 and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fell from heaven and to him to him he was a prison was was a being was not a planet it was not a ball of fire to him was given permission to open the bottomless pit are you with me now amen as the bride goes up satan is cast down revelation 12 and the great dragon verse 9 and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the earth and his angels was cast out with him and the bible said that he his tale drew the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth because with him come fallen angels and these fallen angels were demon powers that we're reading about supernatural charges attacking the mind of man this is exactly this is exactly again isaiah 14 12 how has i fallen from heaven or lucifer son of the morning how does thou cut down the ground which weakens the nation you see the sun and the moon represents christ and the true church and with rejection of christ and his bride this causes the whole world to go in complete total darkness where the fullness of evil prevails and i want to get this to you because we're preaching about every fiber every fiber and fabric of humanity will be filled with perverseness and wickedness if god don't feel every fiber of yours the devil will take that place this is why it is so important to be filled with the fullness of god because he can hurt only those who have not the seal of god in their forehead [Music] hallelujah i'm telling you there is a protection amen from the spirits of darkness it might be knocking at your mind and pushing at your mind and trying to make you disbelieve and to doubt but there is a protection it's called the seal of god hallelujah it's called the holy ghost it's called because he has filled every fiber every fiber of your mind [Applause] give god that anxiety give him that anxiousness give him that worry give it over to him let god feel it look in the tribulation revelation 16 70 and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air atmospheres and there was a great voice at the temple of heaven from the throne saying it's done and there were voices and thunders and lightning and there was a great earthquake such as not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so and so great of course those vials are fully poured out during the tribulation but the trumpets and the vials correlate together and we've already had temporary which causes a third of men showing it's only temporary it's not getting all just it's a portion and the and the trumpets and the vials correlate together and they've already been poured out temporary judgments and i want you to know the seventh one pours it out into the air so you see in the atmosphere it's poured out in in i i i'm not talking about these contrails up here i'm not preaching some stupid crazy uh conspiracy theories and trying to kill all the old people with these contrails up in the sky i'm talking about the atmosphere of homes that have been changed the atmosphere of people's lives that have been changed the atmosphere of the fabric of our country as he turns from lamb speaking with freedom of religion to a dragon and speak says the devil because she becomes under that atmosphere and it's now in the fabrics of our nation in our supreme court in our presidency in the senate in the house in the republicans in the conservatives because the only way you're going to be a conservative of truths conservatives be the bride of christ come on now we're an endangered species in the democrats oh yeah them democrats let me tell you the republicans are the same they're a bunch of sinners a whole bunch of them what is it and their atmosphere of our country and world has to has changed men unto evil chile will come and possess a young man and cause him to go into a into school and just murder kids indiscriminately without feeling and that's just not an isolated case it's happening over and over and over and over and our world is going crazy and the spirit of lawlessness has taken over because the man of sin is now being manifested in his people but at the same time the son of man is being manifested in bright form hallelujah and there is a people that's got a thinking man's filter that gave them a holy man's taste hallelujah for our taste is not of the world it's not a perversion it's not a sin our chase is a heavenly taste give me that book it's in my mouth sweetest honey [Applause] look we can see the releasing of demon spirits that has brought about santa and the insanity in the world in that first year of covenant 19 pandemic global prevail prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by massive 25 i didn't say it's just 25 i said it increased 25 percent unhealthy diets lack of physical exercise loneliness family breakup childhood neglect trauma the pressure of competition in schools and workplace and a lot of this a lot of this can be can be put upon motherhood who represents the church women represents the church a lot of this can be blamed on radical feminists people aged 18 to 33 suffers the highest level of stress in our nation we got a new we got a new generation it's called generation z that's what the world's calling generation z think of that you know we we we are we are generation omega amen come on he is alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first letter the greek the last letter a to z amen amen but the devil's got their own c generation a generation where rates of mood disorder and suicide related outcomes has increased significantly mental health problems among the generation z you know why it's z because it's the last generation it's the last generation you know why we're omega because we're the last generation we are generation omega we're the same god that was in the alpha is now in the omega amen the first is the last the beginning is the end it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i say hallelujah [Applause] and the bible said there are roads of smoke out of the pit a smoke is a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened the word of god blocked out come on now amen the son the light of the bible has been blocked from you is no longer considered is no longer considered in our halls of learning it's no longer wanted in our in our schools it's no longer they they say we will not live by that old book the word of god is rejected it's not wanted in the supreme court it's not wanted come on somebody in our forms of government they don't want it they want to remove even now our newest our newest george washington coins has his face or his back now turned to in god we trust why is it because it's a sign that america has turned her back on god completely and totally and is now under depraved mind and understand a rap of being cast away from god and unredeemable lost souls politicians could care less what the bible said and so is it with the majority the bible that gives a moral code and a sense of decency has been stripped away it's light blocked by the smoke from the pit not only that the air the atmosphere has been darkened the bible said your atmosphere when you were born in sin was was in darkness he said you had your understanding darkened and that's all that can happen when you're alienated from the life of god through ignorance that is in them and the blindness of your heart your understanding just becomes more dark more dark paul would say it like this in this translation i insist and god backs me up on this that there's no going on along with the crowd the empty-headed mindless crowd they refuse for so long to deal with god that they've lost trust not only with god but with reality itself they can't think straight anymore feeling no pain in other words having no conscience they let themselves go in the sexual obsession addicted to every sort of perversion notice the blindness that is caused by the smoke from the fires of the bottomless pit it says it will be in the last day amen but i want you to know god did not leave us without a remedy amen come on he said to you in this last days yes it's going to be blind but i'm providing an asset hallelujah i'm providing an ointment anoint thine eyes when i sound reach and else shady eye into that wounded side and bring what anointment and rub it into those eyes keep rubbing the darkness out keep saying in the word of god until you see clearly oh the smoke from the fires of hell will sublime you and make you where you can't see but i'll tell you god has provided a remedy are you with me amen it blinds them from the sun and the moon the light the word and its fullness and it blinds them to the reality of god it brings fear and anxiety and doubt instead of faith and the only cure for it is i have that is offered only in this age and it's the preaching of the word it's the holy ghost rub that in your eyesight the eyesight into your eyes until you can see jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever then you'll see his healing power then you'll see his deliverance come on brother branham told us as how as an old young boy he would sleep up in the loft in their home it was a poor home he could see the stars through the holes in the tent an old piece of canvas was put over and they slip under old blankets and the drafts caused a cold in their eyes and they would get matter in them and upon awakening in the morning they couldn't get their eyes open to see it was also mattered up and his grandpa was a trapper and he kept the family in food and cooking the raccoons the fat would drip from the meat and his mama would save that and she would warm that grease and come up the ladder and rub grease in their eyes to soften the hard matter so they could see and brother branham said in the laodicean church age i'll tell you we've had an awful draft there's been an awful cold and sweep the country the baptist said the days of miracles are past there's no such thing as the holy ghost no speaking in tongues there's no baptism in the name of the lord jesus and oh all kinds of draft in his clothes a lot of eyes with spiritual coldness and it'll take more than congress to open their eyes brother it'll take a fresh baptism of the holy ghost to massage your eyes and you can see and take the nearsightedness out so you can see the word of god is true hallelujah amen no matter what the draft is god has got a remedy no matter how bad come on somebody how bad the smoke is and how blind you've been and how blind the church is until they crucified the lord of glory and scoff at the word of god hallelujah there is a remedy and that is the holy ghost massage it in those eyes amen beside you like the man down like gaheza did or whatever his name was down there where the light said dalton when he looked out and he saw only the symptoms he saw all kinds of things the men out there they were surrounded and the enemy was around and you may feel like you're surrounded this morning but if you get a little eyes out you'll see there's more than the insanity the age you'll see there's more than demon oppression you'll see there's more than that great army that's against us you'll see there's more than spiritual charges that are against us you will see hallelujah that the hills are of fire with the glory of god the pillar of fire is in the church you'll see you'll see with your eyes open the angels of god are encamped about those that fear him and they deliver them hallelujah if we could only open our eyes we'd see moving up and down this isles this morning his angels of god the holy spirit present god wants to feel every fiber amen listen but i want you to notice and i'm trying to bring this down to close this is what's been prophesied by the prophet joel let's go back verse 16 of chapter two i'm going to try to close on this scripture but this is that which is spoken by the prophet joel in the last days it shall come to pass in the last days said god i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall seize visions your old men shall dream dreams and of all my servants and my handmaids i will pour out in those days my spirit and they shall prophesy whatever what does revelation 10 11 say to us or 10 8 thou shall prophesy again amen and i will show wonders now god is going to show some wonders the devil is showing some wonders bringing his spirits out into this age i will show wonders in the heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapors of smoke god's got a smoke god's got a smoke and that smoke smoke it gets into every fabric remember whatever smoke you're exposed to you it will get in your fabric in your eyes and your hair and every crack and crevice of your home it'll start filling every fiber hallelujah it's a smoke what's here in revelation 28 and verse one and when he opened the seventh seal how many believes were in the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour what was happening now the silence was being broken the seal was being opened and i saw seven angels that stood before god to them were given seven trumpets and another angel come and stood at the altar having a golden sensor that there should be given unto him much in sin that he should offer it with the prayers of the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne and the smoke what the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended before god out of the angel's hand and the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire the altar and cast it to the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightning and an earthquake hallelujah now what's this correlate this together what's now god it said i was so wonders and there's going to be pillars of smoke and now the bride listen has had prayers that have been stored up for his coming that get anointed amen and mixed with the incense and a smoke rises up before god hallelujah and what happens god begins his coming amen and he comes as a prophet come on comes as a word to a prophet and then continues on that same word in the bride are you with me you are part of that coming and it brings up a pleasing holder unto the lord a smoke rising up out of the church oh we're creating an atmosphere we're changing the atmosphere our prayers are changing the atmosphere there's an atmosphere being created among believers and in that atmosphere demons flee they don't come they flee in that atmosphere blind eyes come open in that come on now in that way and that atmosphere cripples well cancers are healed heart troubles are gone hallelujah everything happens in that atmosphere created by the prayers of the saints and they ascend before god now then i want you to turn with me to first thessalonians 4 17. i'm trying to trying to wind this up now and then we were to our alive and remain how can you many can say that's me we which are live we're not dead we're alive hallelujah we which are alive and we remain until we shall be caught up or rapturing up amen our bodies are raptured caught up in an atmosphere and we shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord where in the air in the atmosphere that is created by our prayers and our praise ascending and as it does it causes power and his smoke to descend hallelujah i will show wonders in the heavens above and the earth beneath pillars of smoke hallelujah there will be an atmosphere of praise an atmosphere of faith an atmosphere of power an atmosphere of joy hallelujah and it's in that atmosphere we're caught up to meet the lord in that atmosphere your atmosphere is bringing him down your praise is bringing him down your worship is bringing him down hallelujah i think god fill every fiber fill every bit of us we're holding ourselves steady until we're filled with the word of god come on musician hallelujah and it shall come to pass in the last days i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your men young men shall see visions in the air in that atmosphere where my spirit is poured out in that atmosphere where sons and daughters prophesy becoming the voice of god in that atmosphere where men dream anointed dreams and see visions in that atmosphere is where i'm going to meet you i will not meet you in the atmosphere and stink of satan's delusion but i will meet you in the atmosphere of praise and prayer where visions and prophecy and anointed dreams are that's where the dead will raise that's where people are caught up in a sin and take their position hallelujah i said hallelujah amen oh i threw it to the earth and there were thunderings and lightnings and a great earthquake hallelujah there was an earthquake in his resurrection there was an earthquake and the temple veil was rant there's an earthquake and the graves were open at this resurrection of the bride in this last day out of dark denominationalism there's it was caused by an earthquake come on seventh seal was open silence was broken the book was given come on every promise was made come on somebody i'm trying to wind up now amen all right what happened after resurrection we are resurrected once i was dead but i am alive i was in a dark tomb of denomination but i am alive forevermore and i got the keys to satan's eden i got the keys to death of hell amen i am an overcomer i'm a blood watch son or daughter of god the veil has been rent the mercy seat is open the creeds of man is gone what hid god from man is now gone an earthquake the graves were open the denominational tombs of religion unsealed an earthquake from paul meant freedom paul and silas had shook the shackles away voice and thunderings when god said something it was not understood the voice is interpretation amen the voice is the interpretation of it thunderings and voices god said something it wasn't understood but voices made it understood the gentile ages ends with tongues let's get them started on something i'll preach all day gentile ages ended with tongues it's a sign of death that god is raining down the curtain and closing the gentile dispensation the tongues were a god the tongues was from god's own hand many many take on your farce tongues follow believers some of the signs the tongues weren't evil they were god they were declaring the end of satan's kingdom it is a sign of death to the kingdoms of the world you see tongues isn't the evidence of revival of that old system of religion it's the evidence of death it's a sign from god they have been weighed in the balance and found wanting but tongues of pentecost proclaimed the evidence that the ceremonial religion of the jews was over and a new era had begun and today the tongues it's ringing down the curtain on the gentile church ages and the gospel going back to the jews you see they call that a great revival among the a great spiritual move among the denominations they missed the boat the truth is it's the finish speaking in tongues is heralding the finish to all men's ideas and programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of our god is being ushered in [Music] and i don't mean if we speak in tongues it's a sign of death to us [Music] it's quickening power given life given power at work within you [Music] paul said when you do it you refresh yourself or edify yourself i will pray in the spirit and with understanding also i was seeing in the spirit and with understanding also we're here in the last days he wants to feel every fiber everything you've got one little shred that isn't saturated with god is there a little part maybe it's a spirit of
