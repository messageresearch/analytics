[0:05] hello everyone we're happy that you
[0:09] joined with us today we are the ministry
[0:11] team that even in like tabernacle and we
[0:15] come together again to discuss the Word
[0:17] of God today we're going to be talking
[0:19] about how the New Testament church was
[0:21] born and how that had changed from the
[0:26] law to grace and the it was a changing
[0:30] of dispensation that was taken place in
[0:36] we would find in the book of Acts that
[0:39] there was a question among the believers
[0:43] at that time whether or not to continue
[0:46] with outward circumcision that we talked
[0:49] about in one of our sessions and because
[0:52] there was some Judaizers that were
[0:55] saying unless you're circumcised
[0:57] according to the law of Moses you cannot
[1:01] be saved and so this to them was still
[1:05] the sign of the covenant which there was
[1:08] a fulfillment of this sign by the
[1:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and so in Acts
[1:15] chapter 15 14 simeon had declared how
[1:20] god at the first did visit the gentiles
[1:23] to take out of them a people for his
[1:27] name
[1:27] so god was doing something very specific
[1:30] here wasn't he very very different and
[1:34] that's maybe something important too to
[1:38] say is that god does not deal with the
[1:42] jews and the gentiles in the same way
[1:45] God deals with Israel as a nation and
[1:49] the Gentiles as a people as a people for
[1:51] his namesake
[1:53] now there is the transition that we see
[1:56] in the dispensational change from the
[1:59] Jews to the Gentiles but the majority of
[2:03] Israel was blinded and then God moved to
[2:07] the Gentile people for his namesake
[2:10] does this mean that a
[2:12] Jew today cannot be saved or cannot come
[2:14] to Christ not at all
[2:17] the Paul spoke of it in the in the Bible
[2:20] that he said that for the elects sake
[2:23] they were saved but the rest were
[2:25] blinded and so when when Christ founded
[2:31] the church it's composed of both Jew and
[2:33] Gentile hmm and the beginning church was
[2:37] primarily Jews at that time there was
[2:40] Peter there was Paul there was you know
[2:42] James and many of them but for the most
[2:45] part Jesus came to his own his own
[2:48] received him not
[2:49] and he said lo returned to the Gentiles
[2:53] multi-well so this would be the wisdom
[2:56] or the revelation that Paul would speak
[2:59] about a for example he said we speak the
[3:02] wisdom among them which are perfect or
[3:04] mature yet not the wisdom of this world
[3:06] nor of the princes of this world that
[3:09] come to nought but we speak the wisdom
[3:11] of God in the mystery even though his
[3:14] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[3:16] the world unto our glory which none of
[3:19] the princes of this world knew for had
[3:21] they known it they would not have
[3:24] crucified the Lord of glory and then he
[3:27] goes on to say God was revealing some
[3:29] great things that I had not seen and he
[3:31] isn't not heard what God was going to do
[3:34] and so this would be further explained
[3:37] by Paul in Ephesians chapter 3 how that
[3:42] by revelation he was made known to him
[3:45] was made known the mystery and the
[3:49] mystery was that the Gentiles should be
[3:53] fellow heirs and of the same body and
[3:56] partakers of his promise in Christ by
[3:59] the gospel amen so this was actually a
[4:03] new revelation well he's going from one
[4:06] nation and one people and one locality
[4:09] to all the world all nations whosoever
[4:13] will let him come every nation tongue
[4:15] kindred tribe his now all is welcomed
[4:19] through the blood of Jesus
[4:20] very wonderful which makes a holy nation
[4:23] a holy priesthood right a peculiar
[4:27] people right and so God never done away
[4:30] with his separated nation that's right
[4:32] but this is a higher place way we find
[4:35] when you go back to the Old Testament we
[4:37] know that Solomon was commissioned to
[4:39] build got a temple yes sir and it was a
[4:41] glorious temple there was never wouldn't
[4:42] like it
[4:43] but we find that it due to the neglect
[4:46] of God's people the temple was destroyed
[4:48] and inherit came on the scene
[4:51] Herod reconstructed the temple almost
[4:53] identical to Solomon's Temple by trying
[4:56] to make it more grander and glorious but
[4:58] we find that in that that's man's work
[5:00] to do something they were presenting a
[5:02] sacrifice declaring that there was still
[5:04] an arc of the Covenant there was a mercy
[5:05] seat because God gave his people a
[5:07] promise I will meet you between the
[5:09] mercy seat yes and you come and we knew
[5:11] that the high priest can only enter into
[5:13] that holy place once a year and he would
[5:15] present to sacrifice for the people but
[5:17] we find here in mark 15 38 the veil of
[5:20] the temple was rent in twain from the
[5:22] top to the bottom what was he declaring
[5:24] Jesus when he died on the cross he rent
[5:26] that temple veil from top to bottom
[5:28] showing that it wasn't man but it was
[5:30] him and what he did is he put the mercy
[5:32] seat in plain view that the Mercy ceased
[5:34] not behind that veil the mercy seats
[5:36] hanging on a cross so now where it was
[5:39] sin for anybody to come into that holy
[5:41] place they would die the high priest had
[5:44] a pomegranate and a bell on his feet and
[5:46] we would go in he would sing holy holy
[5:48] holy unto the Lord and if it wasn't loud
[5:50] it wasn't making any music they knew he
[5:52] was dead and now we find that if our
[5:55] life isn't crying holy holy holy unto
[5:58] the Lord that we are dead as believers
[6:00] but where the high priest went in once a
[6:02] year and for those that wasn't a high
[6:05] priest to go in it was death now for us
[6:07] not to go in because the mercy seats in
[6:09] plain view no longer is is a high priest
[6:12] presenting our sacrifice Jesus is our
[6:14] sacrifice right he's become that lamb
[6:16] that dispensation has changed no longer
[6:19] we under the law now we're under the
[6:21] grace of God and he's gonna meet us on
[6:23] the mercy seat which is Christ - were in
[6:26] this hour yeah that's right the the
[6:30] incomplete sacrifice
[6:33] sacrifices was finished at that point
[6:36] that you spoke of when he died and cried
[6:39] it is finished it was right there and
[6:41] Daniel spoke of it in in Daniel chapter
[6:45] 9 yeah it says that seventy weeks would
[6:48] be determined upon Daniel's people and
[6:52] upon the holy city which the seventy
[6:55] weeks was representing a designated time
[6:59] for the Jewish people as a nation and
[7:02] then it said in the midst of the week he
[7:05] will cause the sacrifice of oblation to
[7:08] cease exactly and so Christ was
[7:11] fulfilling that as his ministry was
[7:14] three-and-a-half years when he was
[7:16] crucified the the that would be the
[7:20] middle of the the the middle of the week
[7:22] that's correct
[7:23] the sacrifice had ceased now it's really
[7:27] important to understand at the closing
[7:30] of the law and the Jewish dispensation
[7:32] that God deals with the Jews and the
[7:35] Gentiles in two different ways he deals
[7:38] with the Jews as a nation so God is
[7:41] closing now bringing down the curtain on
[7:43] the nation of Israel and the Jewish
[7:46] dispensation as it were and he's moving
[7:49] into another dispensation and at this
[7:54] time when Jesus Christ it is finished
[7:57] mm-hmm he says he Lila box and I why is
[8:01] that a canoe and he gave up the ghost
[8:04] the earth began to quake the veil was
[8:08] rent as you said from top to bottom
[8:09] showing this was God's work salvation is
[8:12] of the Lord right that it was God's
[8:14] working then something amazing took
[8:17] place and it's just a tiny little
[8:19] scripture there in verse Matthew 27 52
[8:25] let me read 51 and it says behold the
[8:28] veil of the temple was rent in twain
[8:31] from top to bottom and the earth did
[8:34] quake and the rocks rent and the graves
[8:37] were opened and many bodies of the
[8:41] saints which slept arose
[8:43] and came out of the graves after his
[8:46] resurrection and went into the holy city
[8:48] and appeared to many so there was a
[8:52] resurrection then that took place as as
[8:55] the Old Testament and the Jewish
[8:58] dispensation came to an end that there
[9:01] actually was a resurrection of all the
[9:04] saints of the Old Testament so when we
[9:08] come to the end of the Gentile
[9:09] dispensation there's also to be another
[9:12] resurrection of all the Gentiles from
[9:15] the seven ages and and so you know this
[9:20] is exactly another parallel you know
[9:22] that Jesus actually we've been talking
[9:25] about him fulfilling the law even at the
[9:29] Passover he fulfilled another feast and
[9:32] that was the feast of firstfruits this
[9:35] goes along exactly with what you're
[9:37] talking about and and Paul would say in
[9:40] 1st Corinthians 15:20 but now is Christ
[9:43] risen from the dead and become the
[9:46] firstfruits of them that slept wonderful
[9:50] so he was he also was a first fruit
[9:54] Jesus Christ fulfilling the feast of
[9:58] firstfruits you know you'd have the
[9:59] Passover the the unleavened bread the
[10:03] feast unleavened bread and the feast of
[10:05] firstfruits all happened right there
[10:07] bang bang bang right in a row and then
[10:09] 50 days later would come and Pentecost
[10:12] and so again Jesus when it was not only
[10:17] unleavened and the unleavened bread and
[10:20] sinless bread from heaven but now he's
[10:23] also the firstfruits of them that slept
[10:27] so he's the first one up from the dead
[10:30] of the Old Testament and with him with
[10:33] comes all of the saints
[10:36] there is a revelation that runs down
[10:39] through the Old Testament and it's
[10:41] typology it was it was the Holy Spirit
[10:44] showing that there was going to be a
[10:47] resurrection and if you remember Abraham
[10:51] bought a field yeah to to bury Sarah
[10:56] and he himself was buried there then you
[11:00] find Jacob was buried there Isaac it was
[11:03] buried there and many of those prophets
[11:07] longed to be buried in the Promised Land
[11:11] yeah what Joseph tell him don't you
[11:13] leave my bones here that's exactly why
[11:15] don't you leave my bone here he
[11:16] prophesied you will carry my bones out
[11:19] of Egypt yeah yeah so while those 400
[11:22] years they were being whipped and being
[11:24] abused by the Egyptians they would look
[11:26] at that lead coffin and they'll say one
[11:28] day yeah we're coming out of this
[11:30] bondage one day God made a promise right
[11:33] and what a what a comfort that must have
[11:36] been but we have a better comfort yeah
[11:38] because we can look over to Palestine
[11:40] and see there's an empty grave that fans
[11:42] is finding that one day we're coming up
[11:46] and so down through the ages you'll find
[11:50] that prophets looked and wanted to be
[11:53] buried in that land you'll see that Ruth
[11:56] said your people will be my people your
[11:59] God will be my God where you're buried
[12:01] I'll be buried in man and you'll see job
[12:04] he talked about you know though I the
[12:08] skin worms destroy this body yet in my
[12:10] flesh shall see God right they were all
[12:13] looking forward to that resurrection and
[12:17] that resurrection was was coming so they
[12:20] all fell down under the blood of bulls
[12:22] and goats and that's a very good point
[12:25] because before the atonement they did
[12:30] not go under the altar in heaven as it
[12:34] were they went to a different place
[12:37] called paradise in the belly of the
[12:39] earth because the atonement was not
[12:41] there they did not go up they went down
[12:43] mm-hmm right that's right so this brings
[12:47] us to something that really happened
[12:49] then during the time of Jesus death
[12:52] barrelled resurrection before he raised
[12:54] from the grave and the Old Testament
[12:57] Saints the Bible tells us that he had a
[13:01] ministry while he was in the Tuesday
[13:03] yeah and so he said in first Peter 3:18
[13:06] for Christ
[13:08] hath once suffered for us force in the
[13:11] just for the unjust that he might bring
[13:12] us to God being put to death in the
[13:15] flesh but made alive by the spirit are
[13:18] quickened by the spirit by which also he
[13:22] went and preached unto the spirits in
[13:25] prison which sometimes were disobedient
[13:28] when once the long-suffering of God
[13:30] waited in the days of Noah while the ark
[13:33] was a preparing wherein few that is
[13:35] eight souls were saved by water so you
[13:39] know Jesus actually was alive he was he
[13:44] was ministering he went down into the
[13:47] the bowels of the earth yes and he would
[13:51] actually empty paradise yes amen so he
[13:55] was not a dead lifeless form you know
[13:57] the grave whose spirit was non-existent
[14:00] our soul sleeping he was actually alive
[14:04] and these souls were there yes and
[14:07] though their bodies slept in a grave and
[14:10] with the Saints that slept yet they were
[14:12] very very much alive because he preached
[14:15] to souls that were even in prison even
[14:19] those who didn't repent and said I am
[14:21] the fulfillment of what Noah preached
[14:23] amen amen
[14:25] I've heard you say it before it's always
[14:27] excited to me you know Jesus told the
[14:29] thief on the cross he said this day
[14:31] you'll be with me wandering in Paris so
[14:34] we know Jesus was going there but we
[14:35] also know that the thief went there and
[14:38] you've mentioned it in a sermon before
[14:39] and I think about how exciting it must
[14:41] have been when the thief came running
[14:43] through that door and he let him know
[14:44] he's right behind me ready he's coming
[14:46] get him everything you've been waiting
[14:49] for it's it's right you're honest you
[14:50] know what a witness that must have been
[14:52] him coming in letting them know you're
[14:54] only going to be here another moment and
[14:56] even the rich man who was in hell lifted
[14:59] up his eyes and he saw Lazarus in the
[15:02] bosom of Abraham right and there was a
[15:04] great gulf fixed but they were in the
[15:06] belly of the earth and they could not
[15:08] come right and if you remember in the
[15:11] book of Revelation jesus said I have the
[15:13] keys of death and hell so first he paid
[15:16] our price and he descended into hell
[15:19] where we belong
[15:20] but he went down to Satan himself he
[15:23] took his keys gave him a swift kick in
[15:25] the pants yeah he came he preached to
[15:27] the souls in prison up through Paradise
[15:30] he unlocked paradise and at his
[15:33] resurrection those over comers rose with
[15:35] him that we're looking for the coming of
[15:37] the Lord that were justified by their
[15:38] faith in those substitute or
[15:41] substitutionary offerings looking for
[15:44] the coming in the Messiah they rose with
[15:45] him and he led captivity captive and
[15:48] gave gifts unto man a man calls the
[15:50] blood of bulls and goats would not cover
[15:52] sin wouldn't yell covers and so you know
[15:55] it would not annihilate or do away with
[15:57] the sin it was only something that would
[16:01] was it's kind of like paint over over a
[16:04] blemish but if the blemish is still
[16:07] there it's just painted over but the
[16:09] blood of Jesus is a bleach that totally
[16:12] annihilate ever since taint a man and so
[16:15] when Jesus went to paradise he actually
[16:18] there his blood now was a greater blood
[16:21] than bulls and goats and he delivered
[16:24] them from this place price and moved to
[16:27] all of paradise into into heaven and to
[16:30] his entities in one lorry because no man
[16:33] could ascend into heaven except the he
[16:36] that came down from heaven even the Son
[16:39] of Man which is in heaven this is John
[16:40] 3:13 and so the Bible would also say
[16:44] that he led captivity captive so he took
[16:49] them from paradise and they ascended up
[16:53] with him and and of course he said now
[16:56] he that is ascended what is it but he
[17:00] also descended reverse into the lower
[17:04] parts of the earth yes this is Ephesians
[17:07] 4 the night man he that descended is the
[17:10] same also that ascended far above all
[17:14] heavens wonderful so he said he led
[17:17] those that were captive in and held
[17:20] there in question until the Redeemer
[17:23] could come and and take away their
[17:26] and then move paradise into heaven so
[17:30] that when when we die now we do not go
[17:33] to the bowels of the earth racing Lord
[17:35] amen but we are there under the altar of
[17:37] God hey man how wonderful man and so
[17:40] they the Old Testament or the Jewish
[17:44] dispensation closed with a resurrection
[17:47] yes yes and the Gentile dispensation
[17:50] will also close with a resurrection
[17:53] hallelujah praise Allah then not only a
[17:55] resurrection but a rapture exactly yes
[17:58] sir because Jesus ascended and the
[18:00] Saints with him they marry man wonderful
[18:03] you notice one thing to curse for we
[18:06] close this out you said he ends it with
[18:08] the resurrection the Jewish dispensation
[18:10] but it also ended with the rending of
[18:13] the temple veil God showing I'm not in
[18:15] where you think I am but I'm somewhere
[18:17] else yes I think we found it today that
[18:19] he's not you know the Bible says he's
[18:22] seated in the throne of God showing
[18:24] himself to be God but that's where the
[18:26] church sees him but he's somewhere else
[18:28] that's a good point
[18:29] so what happened to those Jews who had
[18:33] not turn the corner yes well that's
[18:36] where tribulation came upon a people and
[18:39] they fell out from the grace of God and
[18:42] and only grace now was gonna be shown by
[18:46] accepting the blood atonement of Jesus
[18:49] Christ and that's why that the Jewish
[18:51] nation has been scattered and dispersed
[18:54] people for all of these years but God
[18:56] has promised I will restore
[18:58] cinnamon-raisin Lord amen this is God he
[19:01] will not forgive man amen amen
[19:03] god bless you today thank you for
