tongue speaking or gifts but Lord It's the fullness of the word being made manifest it's every promise of God being made real and father because of that Lord we have all the rest of it so Lord I pray today for your people may they expand their borders to reach out and into places that they've never put their foot upon things that the enemy has held back from them that today Lord they would make progression and that they would they would have the courage to step out by faith and place their foot on the promise of God for theirselves Lord those that are needing healing Lord we know that that

Lord I pray father your blessings upon us now as we love you in Jesus name thank you Lord amen what Grace what Mercy we thank him for that mercy and Grace God bless you turn with me to Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 and we want to read together this morning the word of God we welcome you today in his lovely name and praying that he will bless you from on high amen Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus ever knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of the Father God bless you you can be seated amen but may he bless his word today amen we are we're going to speak this morning on a little subject that I as I thought of different things to title this today as we know brother brandham spoke many many times about identification and identified Masterpiece and and different different sermons like that and I I just thought I would speak on this this morning and just call this real ID amen you know we're we're in the Third Exodus and as we have been speaking about the token and as the blood of the Lamb it identified every Israelite dwelling as a follower of the message You Could See Clearly there was a market distinction between the Egyptians and their dwelling and Israel and their dwellings and of course it was the blood upon it that identified it and so must the Holy Spirit and his word be our identification amen that we must be identified in the word and the word must be our identification we must be identified by the blood for we must be born of that blood and we know that in that day the token or the blood was a token a sign or an identification and it identified that the worshipper had slain the lamb and it that of course had previously had accepted the lamb first and then um slain the lamb and then applied the blood as a token as a sign to his dwelling and and that that he was not ashamed he didn't care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it and it was placed in such a position that everybody passing by could see that token nobody had to wonder whether that was an Israelite dwelling or whether it was identified with the message of the hour it was identified by the blood upon the upon the upon the doorpost and upon the the lentil and today you know of course um you know today identification is very very important before you can travel on a on a plane or you're required to have what they call now real ID your identification has to be proven and they were use different sources not just one but a birth of records and proof of citizenship and proof of residence and all you know they're they're looking for proof that you are who you say you are and to say you are a Believer is not enough your your identification has to be verified amen we we're about to get on a flight to glory and you must have real ID the blood the Holy Spirit of the perfect lamb Christ identifies that we are dead to ourself and we have been identified with our sacrifice and the lamb through the his blood the spirit and the person becomes identified together that you know the sacrifice and the believer both identified together as as one so you see it it shows us that um as I said you know that when they applied the blood of course that was a reproach in that day they uh you know sheep or lamb was an Abomination to the Egyptians so it was a reproach in that day to take the life of that blood and then of that lamb and place it upon the doorpost and you know that was um uh a scorn it was uh ridiculed it was um it was hated by the Egyptians but they wanted everybody passing by to be able to see that the token had been applied you know some want to be a secret Christian I reminds me of like a couple of young men who were in college and one was saying man I have been so persecuted for my faith the professors the students have all just ridiculed me and made fun of me and said how about you and the other replied oh no I I've had no problems I I've never even told anybody I was a Christian you know really it shouldn't be something we have to tell it ought to be something that is so on our lives that identifies us that there's something different about that man or something different about that woman they're not like everybody else there there there's a mark of Distinction upon them you know and so many wants to be a Christian and do it secretly and I don't want my associates to know uh you know I want to be a Christian but I don't so and so to know well you know that's not real Christianity Christianity has to display its token publicly or at the office or on the street Street or whether it's trouble around or whether it's good times anytime in church everywhere it must of it must publicly display the token and the token of course is the blood and and it must be applied and without it the Covenant is not even an effect you know before judgment fell before anything happened they had already been uh they had already been redeemed for by faith they had applied the blood you see it would have been too late to wait until after the Wrath had fallen there would be a time where you wouldn't even have any blood to be applied it would not even be effective and seeing the Destroyer with those big black wings dropping down from the sky like like smoke settling over Egypt and there were screams coming from every dwelling and every house the Destroyer was was was not looking to see if they had a collection of Moses books in their house it was not looking to see that they had Eagle belt buckles you know that would identify them with a certain group or that they were wearing the certain label of a certain denomination you know that on the outside there was something that was um you know a poster that that identified them themselves with some kind of church but when the death angel came and and the the destroyer and these screams were coming from everywhere he was looking for real ID the proof you see the proof that the blood in our case that the holy spirit is there and without it the death angel of course would pack you out now Satan is after the church he will do everything he can to destroy it you know he will use those even who identify themselves as message Believers to destroy the church you know like balam always looking for flaw always looking for a fault you know you know someone can do more damage they can do more damage inside of a church you know than what than what a what the Vatican itself can do exactly right if an edict came from Rome that was passed against us you know what it would do it caus us all just to cling together amen bind together but when someone even within our ranks Rises against the church he's identified himself as a Believer he can destroy more than what the pope could ever do you see filled with poison he could start through the church and picking off weak ones it's the serpent it's death and brother brandom saw it as a as a black mamba instant death and you see Satan hates us he's no friend of the church he he hates the church he hates the ministry he hates this message and he'll do whatever he can to destroy even and discredit even years of faithful Ministry if he can't make a pastor to sin he will try to find some fault that he can exaggerate where that you know confidence is lost in that Ministry he'll kill the pastor's influence so that his ministry can no longer be effective you know there's more than one way to kill a man than taking a gun and shooting him just kill his influence and that's why you as a as Believers must discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Paul said that wolves would come in and sheep clothing using false ID and and they would not spare the block now here we we even see it in the church ages no sooner than Christ leaves the scene and the Holy Ghost Comes Here Comes death riding in the first age and here he comes riding on a white horse impersonating Christ you know first it's a spirit and and then it gets into some of the people and some you know sometime you know it even gets in some of those that it gets in even becomes officials in the church you know Judas Judas was seemingly a nice guy he was a sound seemed like a real believer and he warmed his way right into leadership and the next the next move he comes to kill with the sword to bring a betrayal and and the next move you know his horse becomes dark as as truth is distorted and and finally when it's too late you find out it was death all the time you see it's important that you know who you are and it's also important that you know what is yours what belongs to you as a Believer it's important that you also discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit that you're going to have to look for real ID to see what you know whether they're really what they say they are anybody can make claims but but we got to be real in this hour amen you know so it's important to know who you are it's also important to know that you know who you are and that you know what is yours you see brother bam told us again that this age will suffer in with an identity crisis and he would he would call it spiritual Amnesia that the that the church would actually forget who they're supposed to be and what they are supposed to do and what lays within their realm of power so you see this would be the work of antichrist and and this is what you see even among the world today is is a a real identity crisis everybody is trying to be something that they're not or you know pretending going on or you know um if they're not something that they want to be well then they will paint theirself up like a barn to prend there something else it's it's it's an age of where you know true identity is really lost and people are in an identity crisis so you see it's it's a is a time where you know uh where as brother brandham described this Amnesia he said a man or woman could get it and and um you know they still have the same education the same background same knowledge and things that they had as far as that but they don't know where it came from and don't know who they are don't know where they belong and of course that's Amnesia and sometimes we forget who we are and sometimes in doing so we'll forget even who people that we love are sort of like the elderly man who was telling about a good restaurant and he he had just went to it the day before and someone asked him well what was the name of the restaurant and he tried and tried and tried to remember and he said well finally he said well you know you'll have to help me here said um um um let's see um what what what's the name of that flower that smells so good you know they give it at Valentine's and someone said a rose yeah yeah that's it so then he called out to his wife said hey Rose what's the name of that restaurant we ate at yesterday you see that's a horrible thing when you can't even remember who your wife is or which are your children it gets in you know where that you can't identify you know you have this memory lost and and I find with every move of God Through the Ages they start out with a youthful Vision but as the movement ages they forget why they sacrificed they forget why they even separated and and become this consecrated group they forget the glory and The Wonder of what God had done among them and then it becomes difficult to remember when we had when we had a god of Miracles and we forget the outpouring of the spirit and how it was to feel His blessings and know his power and we forget the excitement and the joy of the word being revealed and it just becomes uh you know it's a secondary or nothing to us you know it's kind of like the Methodist movement it forgot the sawest trail where men wallered in their te tears they forgot how the spirit moved and until men and women would actually fate be so overcome by the power of God until they would pour water on them and soon it became just a form of I believe to the message I I subscribed to the Methodist beliefs and that's what we are and it became just a formal religion and they forgot their Beginnings they they forgot the you know the what the men who were persecuted to John Wesley who would who would stand and preach and and the power of which it was preached and he they've so forgot it until that even in Methodist churches the preachers no longer preach with that same power they lost that power they lost the identity that they originally had when they started out and they become just another formal religion and another daughter to the you know it's an awful thing when we when we think about movements as they Age and what happens to them and and how they forget where they come from how that God moved how the angel of the Lord was present how the pillar of fire was there and then when it goes missing from the church they give you know well you know that that's just the way that it is they they forget what they used to be and they lose their original identity and they take on a another identity an identity of another movement of another with a form of godliness that denies the power thereof you know you know again men can get in this in such a way that when they will uh when they drift away from God you remember there was a king in the in the Bible his name was Nebuchadnezzar who exalted himself and and um God let him God let him go for a while and then you know here because have so exalted himself he was brought down he got got to the place he thought he was an animal he lived out in the wilderness he ate grass like a ox his hair grew grew down his body like eagle feathers and had a heart of a beast in him you see he forgot he was King here he was King of Babylon but now this comes and takes over him where he can't identify with with who he is anymore he is now you know in his mind the Beast and and on all fours and eating grass and and whatever and and brother brandham tells us he said that's so easy today sometimes what the Christian church is we act like the world and it shows we got spiritual Amnesia because you don't act like a Christian you see you receive the heart of the world and it causes this so the church will will suffer this Amnesia because they will be caught between two opinions as as brother random talked about this and he talked about two classes of people and I just want to deal with this for a moment he talked about two classes of people one was the fundamentals and the others was the Pentecostal and he said the fundamentals positionally studies the scriptures and figures out and said we are sons of God and they believe that but they have no faith with it so here's one opinion then you see again here's the Pentecostals he said there got a lot of faith and they don't know their sons so here there you know people CAU between two opinions some on one side over here that that positionally they know what the word says they know what the word promises they know that they're sons of God they're born again by the spirit of God but they don't have any faith to go with it they can never put it into work the other you know is claiming faith and power and you know and and and the manifestation of God but they don't know who they are you see you see they know the principles of Faith but they don't know their position in the word it's like a man that's got money in the bank and he can't write a check and the other man he he can write a check but he ain't got no money in the bank so you see it's caught between two opinions you know can you imagine the poor fellow who has lots and lots of money in the bank but don't know how to access it he's forgot how to write a check remember this was Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar was king he had a two at his command all the resources of Babylon but he forgot who he was that's right amen he got caught he got caught there in in and there was in that situation acted like an animal rather than a king you see again can you imagine the poor fellow who's got lots and lots of money in the bank but don't know how to access it he's forgotten at how to write a check the other knows how to write a check but he's forgot he's air to all things oh can can you imagine that I I think how horrible that that would be to a people who are the people of the book who have access to every Divine promise amen who who can look and say well the word says we're this and the word says we're that and here's our position and we we're sons of God but they don't know how to access the power amen oh brother random always long he said if I could just get the two of them together I believe what the that's what real ID will do it'll bring the two together it'll make you know every promise of God is real every promise of God is there it was a posited Calvary amen it is mine amen the promise is not coming it's already here just let me right out to check if you could ever get the two together this is the right mind until men and women could realize that you that's been truly baptized in the Holy Spirit and you have the token that you have a right to every Redemptive blessing that God promised everything that he promised is yours so you hold your token that's the Holy Ghost over your unwavering Faith as you pray and over his word now it's like the those with spiritual Amnesia I get amazed at it I get amazed at where we are as our movement ages you know we we forget where what we have I I hear some preaching you know oh you know cap off the Pyramid of my life with Divine love as as if it's something coming anden something that lies ahead that you know don't put that as a carriot on the stick Divine love is God's nature and it comes by receiving the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is perfect love and only Divine love can be perfect love and that has to be God and the token is a sign the real identification that the Capstone amen the ultimate the Supreme sign has come down upon you that the Capstone has come it's not something that you're going to grow into it is something that has been enjoyed to you by receiving the Holy Ghost amen if you have the Holy Ghost today you don't have to wait on Divine love to come that's what you receive God is love and the Holy Ghost is God and when you have been joined with him you have Divine love just put it to work you got it you can forgive your enemies you can love those that hate you you can say good things about those who can't say something good about you you got it it's in you it's possible sir you have it amen you have it love will cover a multitude of sins love will cover a multitude of faults amen come on and you got it just let it go work you've got the Holy Ghost let me see your hands you have Divine love release it release it release it in forgiveness release it in healing release it when a sinner comes that is seeking God that you love that Soul amen you love that so you you have such a love for the gospel that you say and you cry for the Abominations done in the city release it you got it you have it it's come if you got the Holy Ghost you have it use it amen well somebody did me wrong brother Tim I can't come to church no more why don't you just release the love you got God had to love you when you were unloving so did we amen you see you see they don't recognize that the Holy Ghost for through the baptism of the Holy Ghost you and God who is love are sealed and United together as one and you have his nature we are not waiting for this we have received this we can release love love that will cause a feeling for the lost love that will have a desire for the sick to be healed amen it was love that made brother randam have compassion for the blind man and enter into his suffering you see he wasn't just a number in the prayer line he was a poor suffering mortal in need and brother brandham you know kept going looking at this man until he had he released the love for him he needs shoes my shoes won't fit him he's too big for my coat he's in rags this poor man you know all he went down to all the things he could he could do for him and couldn't do anything but he had something he could release amen you got some love to let go of Amen if people let go of their love there wouldn't be no criticism of a prayer line if people let go of the love of God there wouldn't be no criticism for an altar call they would want souls to find Jesus amen they would know that God had done something in my life I want it to happen to everybody amen if you really had the love of God in your life you wouldn't close the door of mercy and say you were the only way you got to come by me you see Som have adoption is something based on earnings something that is impossible to get something you don't know how to get or when you got it something that you're working for adoption is the token it's the true baptism of the Holy Ghost sure if the if the birth is C characterized as as just believing or even sanctification then adoption is not the new birth but a adoption like the Holy Ghost comes when a person surrenders their life completely to the will of the father amen it's you know tell me anything else when else is it that when when other than when you are adopted and placed as a son that you get the robe of the Holy Ghost that you get the ring of authority on your finger that you have the power to use the name of Jesus Christ amen you see again you see when the the Holy Ghost comes when a person completely surrenders his life to the will of the father and and it's spiritual Amnesia to say well I have the token but but now I I need to to have the power to to become adopted you know I I got to have that you see you don't know who you are if you have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you are placed in the body amen you are placed as a son you are recognized as a child of God a Son of God Amen and I I as I and I quote from the token message we have been given the supernatural Supreme token and all that was foreshadowed has been given to this generation has been given the token now we have the Holy Ghost is our token and it is our identification that we've accepted the death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus just human life to come back on us but it was God himself manifested in flesh that brought back up on us the adoption of sons that now we are Sons and Daughters of God that's the token amen if you have the Holy Ghost you have been adopted plac in the body position amen you have the power release it amen amen amen you have the same power they had at the gate called beautiful that was released at Silver and Gold Have I None but I have something I've got something I can release something oh the church needs to realize we need to be releasing not binding not holding back not binding Mercy but releasing Mercy not binding salvation but releasing salvation not binding healing but releasing healing we got it it ain't coming it's here so well we'll wait for the persecution well I tell you what you know the the next thing for us is a Rapture not the persecution so well when we get that we'll have the third pull no we already have the third pull we're not waiting on it but people have forgot that it was the opening of the word the revealing of those Seven Seals that put the word put the book in your hand ask what you will amen release it as brother brandom talked about these two classes I've always found two classes of people one's a fundamental positionally he knows where he is in Christ because of the word but he doesn't have any faith in what he's doing he hasn't received the Holy Spirit and then I find the Pentecostal many of them has received the Holy Ghost but don't know who they are just like a man who's got money in the bank and can't write a check nothing can write a check and don't have money in the bank if I could get the two together if I could get the Pentecostals to realize who he is and come back to the real full word of God with that baptism of the Holy Ghost it set the world a fire again with a new Pentecostal Revival well then what's wrong with a new Pentecostal Revival it we could just get the two together if we could just get rid of those who have the Holy Ghost to realize amen who I am as a son amen identify myself in the scripture and realize the message was sent to me it's not brother Brandon's message it's my message amen this is my message this is my Ministry this is my word and it's mine to use amen we need to know and this hour sometimes we want to talk about the great Mysteries of the word and and yet can't figure out how to apply it how do I get the word to work for me I need healing but because of no faith to access it it's like being bankrupt no money there no power there that's an awful place to be in yeah we used to have Miracles but not now we you know we we need the Holy Ghost to cause us to live right but we can't have it and people sit in spiritual poverty because we have forgotten how to write the check we forget God we forget where we come from that's right we forget our origin that's right we forget we forget our beginnings and the god of our beginnings and we tend to become then secular in our beliefs stale in our spiritual walk stagnant in lukewarm because we forget who we are you know it's like Israel of old you know God by his grace he chose Israel from all the families of the earth you have been chosen of all the families of the earth God chose you you are not here by happen stance you are the chosen of the Lord never forget who you are chosen elected precious my delight his Joy come on the apple of his eye that's who you are and Israel forgot you know what God had did for them that God had done that he he had give them their choice lands he'd give them houses they never had to build he gave them Farms they never had to buy he gave them food they never planted he gave them Wells they had never dug he gave them victories they never won he gave them Grace they never merited amen he did that for his chosen people amen the Bible said he found her in a field as a little girl sitting in their own blood and he washed her and cleaned her up and and and after God showed all these mercies to her and she got rich she forgot about where those things came from you know it reminds me of our nation America you know America is suffering with this with the same disease it's a great this is a great picture of the USA because you see we are a great powerful people millions in numbers now but we forgot where these things came from Israel had the same B bad case of it if after God had been good to them and give them these Heathen lands and made them a separated people and separated them to himself and he as he said I I took a vine out of out of Egypt out of another country and I planted it over here and I made it grow and I made it fruitful but the vine forgot where where its blessings come from and he says so is God's people in these last days has forgot what a testimony of being a Christian means and this Amnesia that has come upon the people they can't identify themselves they forgot all about it they forgot his Holiness they forgot his law women were living like the rest of it I just want to say don't take your freedom for granted today we have leaders in our country that like the vice president who is not even connected to America at all her mother's from India her dad is from Jamaica her family has no connection to America to Heritage they have been G given Liberties and freedom that they cannot identified with you see it's like brother brandham said to be in America when I'm born here in this country I become a citizen I I'm identified with this nation all it is I am all that has been I am for I'm identified as American I I have to take all its shame all its Glory whatever it is I am identified with it I want you to get it he said I'm identified as an American citizen than all it was I am all it is I am I must be a a part of it I if I'm American citizen I'm a part of America and he said I must never forget this if I want to remain a true American citizen I must remember what I am what my nation is I'm identified with my nation to forget her to or to fight for her or die for her or to to stand for all she is I must stand for it what my nation is I am what it stands for I stand for to be a loyal American I'm ready to die for it fight for it stand for it do anything there is I'm a part of it you can't pick on without picking on me when you say something against it you say it against me for I am an American to say it against you as an American what they say against this nation they say against you for you're a part of it don't you never forget it when you do then you got amnesia and remember you're no more American citizen when you can't become a part of it you must be what America is you must be also I must be partakers of this is my nation I must be partakers of what is I am what she was I am no matter what she was I am still what she was to be an American I landed on Pilgrim Plymouth Rock and with her with the forefathers I was a part of her I rode with Paul R to warn her of her dangers if I'm a real American citizen I landed on Plymouth Rock I rode with Paul Ria to to warn her of her danger you know what I'm meaning I cross the icy Delaware with George Washington with his barefooted soldiers I was there I'm identified with this nation what he did there was a part of me what I do now is a part of him I was identified with Washington at Delaware to be American I am identified with him and his stand crossing the Delaware's fighting battles but you look today that don't describe the majority of Americans what is what is happening in our country Coles well you know is in what is supposed to be the places of Higher Learning we have protest against Israel we have protest against the only democracy in in the Middle East we have protest against that because you see they're trying to do everything to destroy the very fiber of our nation of our freedoms you know but but I want to just say about Israel for a moment have we forgotten the promise given to the Seed of Abraham I will bless those who bless you and him that dishonors you I will curse and in you will all the families of the earth be blessed and I want you to say the same is true of spiritual Israel the bride of Christ I will bless those who blesses you and him that dishonors you I will curse and in all the families of the Earth in you will all the families of the earth be blessed do you realize that you do I'm talking about you the bride of Christ not just here in this building but around the world is what is holding off the Wrath that is coming upon the Earth do you realize you being here holds back the Judgment of God do you realize here that you are the only Grace the world has right now and that when we are raptured out of here hell will break loose and Satan there will come down and take over the Earth completely you are the little the little Last Stand of Hope for the nation for the world the hope is not in a new president you are the Hope amen you are the hope as long as you are here amen wrath is held off the holy spirit is here but when he lifts his holy spirit we're going to go with him and you can tell the holy spirit is lifting from the nation it's lifting from homes it's lifting from families it's lifting from schools amen it's lifting from churches yes even message churches the holy spirit is lifting but I'm telling you this friend I don't want to be departed from that spirit I don't want nothing to separate me from the Holy Ghost when he Le I want to leave with it when he goes up I want to go to I have decided this old world ain't my world let them have it for a little short season amen I'm going away and I'm going there onto there to marriage supper of the lamb and I'm returning back with him and acts Revelation chapter 19 with him as he shown in the power of the word coming back and we'll take it over for the millennial Reign Hallelujah but you realize Israel is the anointed of the Lord don't lift your hand against him the Bible said in 1 Corinthians 16:22 he let no man oppress them he rebuked Kings on their behalf said saying do you know touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm amen oh yeah let me tell tell you that same word speaks of the bride of Christ be careful what you say against her be careful how you rail against her because to touch his anointed is to touch God amen amen oh you see well I tell you what I'm bright too let me just tell you something when I was when I was raising my family and even right now you know but but when I was raising my family family my children were all my children but one couldn't pick on another one couldn't persecute another one couldn't hurt another they did they had daddy to answer to and I'm just going to tell you the same thing well you know you you cannot you cannot hurt one member of the Bride without hurting Christ amen if you belong to God he'll chastise you if you don't but you just going your way but re remember this brother Bram tells us in the Ephesian age he said no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his F fellow man doing nothing but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the Holy Ghost and tongues and prophecies and healings and miracles he will be condemned the Spirit of this world hates the spirit of God and because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells so it can't destroy the Lord it tries to destroy the vessels now Jesus said that signs would identify Believers here's how you're going to know Believers these signs will follow them to be a believer you must have the true anointing but you see the world will hate you yes amen like the blood on the Israelite dwelling it will be a sign of disc scorn of scorn it will be a sign of that that is mocked made fun of hated disdained ridiculed that's right now let me tell you today we have a new Calvary the word of God is crucified from pulpits Brother bradam talked about it he said the most holy places there he receives his heart as pierces a new Calvary where's it found at in the holy places the church where he's crucified from the pastors you Hypocrites you know better than that I'm not angry but something in side of me a Stern God has been thoroughly identified among you where did he get his fears at in his side where did he get his feares on Calvary where does he get it today in the Pulpit where did they come from Jerusalem where did they come from the denomination you know every movement becomes its own Jerusalem you got to come here to get it only here is where salvation is and that's what brother Brandon was talking about the Jerusalem the ones who claim to love him that's who did it that's who desert day his second Calvary where he receives his pieres against the word that's what pierces who is he he's the word where is his pierce the hardest from the pulpit in the Holy in the holy places just like it was then so I've got a right to I indite this generation I've got a right to do it as a minister of the Gospel with signs and proving that he's God I've got a right to bring indictment against this generation CA his hardest spear points has been right from the pulpits where they've criticized and said don't go out to hear that stuff that's of the devil right in the place that's supposed to love him and the Very signs Jesus said would take place the word of God is sharper than the two-edged sword the word a discerner of the thoughts and intents of heart is called the devil we from the pulpits the holy places oh God how can he look down just Mercy that's all just Grace we we can't do nothing else but head for judgment think of it is heart is pierces come from the pulpit that's where his new Calvary is they crucify him the word at the pulpit how they do that by their forms of godliness crowned from The Audience by scoffers he got a crown of thorns scoffers pierced from the pulpit crowned by the scoffers is he crucified aresh Stripped by man-made Creeds teachers of the denominations against his word they strip it in shame and and condemn it Jesus said in vain do they worship me and said they in vain don't do no good who do they worship they worship the same God there was worshiping that same God in his first crucifiction and it was vain worship and it's the same thing today in vain they build these denomination in vain they build seminaries in vain they have these Creeds teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of man denying the word of God they're guilty of crucifying the Prince of Life teaching man's doctrines for his word in vain they worship me so you see that's exactly what it would be so lost the identity of the of the Messiah until in that hour of Darkness They Crucified him I wonder today if it won't even happen that there will be those who crucify their own Revival the Holy Spirit working among the people amen and it's not a it's not a Revival that's made by man it's not a Revival that come from even and light came from the evening light but not from this Tabernacle not from this church the Revival came because Seven Angels Came From glory and the book was taken and the Mysteries revealed and it open up to us the entire Covenant are you with me church amen it open it all up for us every word of God word that every promise is ours Hallelujah I I like to emphasize every promise say well brother Tim we don't believe in altar cause I said every promise well we don't believe in prayer lines every promise we don't pray we don't believe in in Gifts of Spirit ever promise we don't believe on the the Thunders and the mysteries of God ever promise ever prise belongs to us now we realize Jesus said in Mark 16 when he sent out a commission that those who got the commission would receive a confirmation of their commission and that confirmation that they were truly sent was these signs shall follow them that believe amen now he didn't say they might follow or they could follow or or they maybe will follow he said go into all the world now people want to chop the commission off say it's all already over let me tell you it's only begun today we picked up where the book of Acts left off they had the commission the original commission and you you read in in invisible Union of the Bride where brother bradam said that denominational Church World cannot take these Seven Seals therefore they cannot fulfill the Great Commission amen it's something he said it has been revealed to the undenominational bride so guess who fulfills a Great Commission is now in effect if it ever was in effect back then it's an effect now maybe down Through the Ages they lost vision of it but it's been brought back again come on Jesus said this gospel must be preached in all the world and then the end will come amen and this gospel could not be preached until it was restored God sent a message of restoration so now it has to we have a commission and that commission is now to all the world every creature this is where brother bradam would always taken every creature and he said if it hadn't reached it commission isn't over amen we're still Commissioned Don't Matter How wounded how embattled we're still commissioned we got a job to do we got to work to finish and and of course the confirmation of that commission is that these signs was to follow to approve the identification so well brother Tim the seals are open to us well then where's the signs well we don't seek them okay but they follow amen I ain't about seeking them I'm I'm about seeing that they follow amen when we believe they happen come on these signs should follow them that believe when we believe they happen in my name they shall cast out devils in my name they will speak with new tongues amen come on church this is the word that is given to us it is our promise we lay hands on the sick they shall recover oh brother Tim we're in the dirt pool we don't we don't believe in laying on the hands that's you that's not me I'm in the third pull and I believe in all the word third pull is the opening of the word it's the opening of The Seven Seals there not some magic something that's going to happen in the future it's already Among Us it's already been Vindicated it is this message you don't have to wait on the squeeze to come you don't have to wait till you're persecuted you don't have to wait till you're good enough the third pull is right here is the word that has been delivered to you in this hour and it just takes somebody to believe it and when they believe it speak it and when they speak it it'll work I don't care how it is if it's laying hands on the sick if it's casting out Devils if it's speaking with new new tongues whatever it is it works now the Bible tells us the gospel did not come in word only but through Power manifestations of the Holy Ghost so our message is not just a word only message as far as letter it is the word which is the spirit it's the Holy Ghost taking the word and making it manifest you see it must must be demonstrated so you know as brother bradam said now I'm only defending what Jesus said he said these signs have follow them that believe Jesus said in John 14:12 barely verely I say to you that's absolutely absolutely I say to you he that believeth on me the works that I can that I do shall he do also and how can a man believe he's sent from God and then turn around and deny the very commission that God said would that would be the identification of every person somebody say every person that he sent out so he said how can a man say there's no such thing as a baptism of the Holy Ghost how can a man say there's no such thing as Healing The Sick how can a man say there's no such thing is speaking in tongues and casting out Devils when that was the very credentials that Jesus pinned onto every believer that he sent out amen that's the The Authority amen now you know you can go to a seminary you can go to Bible schools you will get credentials and you will get a paper that identifies you as having received their diploma and you have went through their school of learning right that's their identification but that's not the identification a Believer amen the identification when God sends a man is these signs shall follow them that believe that he sent from God this has to be the identification you can say well brother Tim I believe the message okay if you believe then work's the signs amen remember we we have been this age this generation has been indicted has been indicted for not having the identification let me read it from the indictment he said God proved himself alive God has proved that this is his word how have you what have you got but a bunch of dogmas and Creed how where can you show the Living God because you turn down the word of life that would have given you these things yes sir oh wow what an hour that we're now living there saying oh I call you Peter said you took my Wicked hands and crucified and slain whom God raised up having loose the Pains of death because it was not possible he should be hold and through your Creeds and organization denomination with your former godliness still talking your former godliness you denied the power of his resurrection but the hour has arrived that the last days are here when God promised according to Malachi 4 that he would raise up in the last day and would turn the hearts of the children back to the original blessings and the Pentecostal faith of the fathers and you can't deny it and you can't withstand it now I condemn you guilty and challenge you and indict you before God that with Wicked selfish denominational hands you have crucified the word of God before the people and I call you guilty and ready for judgment I call the same thing that Peter did he called repentance of that generation I call repentance to this generation repentance back to God come back to the original truth of the word come back to the Faith of Our Fathers come back to the Holy Ghost cuz God gave change it when he when God said these signs shall follow them that believe he has to stay with that through all through eternity it's his word when you say shake hands take communion something like that or something some on that Creed or something on that idea any man any drunkard any unbeliever can do it but any impersonator any prostitute can do it they take communion have for forms and things like that you can do it but Jesus said this will be the identification these signs shall not they may be they will in all generations to them that believe in my name they will cast out Devils they will speak with new tongues and take up serpents and drink deadly things it won't harm them lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils as freely as you receive freely give this was our original commission we can never forget where we came from what was originally given to us now of course signs and wonders Miracles tongues gifts no that's not our only identification amen we must have christlikeness because you see Devils use false ID also so they also can speak with tongues amen and so you know but remember that's false ID that's amen you see you say well I shouted well muhammadans Buddhist everything else they shout too that can be false ID amen Colts Clans everything SC they scream holler at a baseball game you know again it's a devil presenting false ID to try and discredit it the real move of the spirit amen but but when Christ is identified in you you are Christlike amen the word Christian means to be Christlike and there is your identification amen and so we're identified with him by living for him in our lives now as brother brandom said in the message token if it's in you and you say well I don't steal and I don't lie and well that's just good that's just something you can quit you can quit stealing you can quit lying a good moral man does that I keep the Ten Commandments they did that before Jesus died amen but the thing of it is Christ Living in you not coming from external rules of Commandments or I'm going to reform and do better but Christ Living in you and Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever proving that God has raised up him up for us from the dead according to his promised word and it is identification that Jesus Christ is living today and we accept his sacrificed blood that he gave his life the token seal of the Holy Ghost is our promise Ephesians 4:30 said grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption being baptized by this token into the body of Christ 1 Corinthians 12 now we are subject to gifts of the Spirit that's in there the world don't believe in gifts that church don't believe in gifts but God's word says there are gifts and it only takes only that token to identify those gifts amen so you said now so so he goes right on and he brings it right down and he says now here you have the authority of a Believer as an identified child of God if Satan puts his hands on you and he tries to Temp you into something you hold your token in your hands and show it death angel you're not getting me you have to Passover amen I am a redeemed product of Jesus Christ I will not be a slave to sin I will not be subject to your vices I will not be pulled down into your hell amen and I am a redeemed child of God the blood the Holy Ghost is on my life and the Death Angel has to Passover amen hallelujah sickness come and you can command it sickness flee I am a redeemed product of the Holy Ghost if you say you're Christian and the identification of Christian the Bible Christian is not worked in you then there's something wrong see because these signs shall follow them that believe brother bradam preached a sermon you know of calling Jesus on the scene and he talked about the church again what was it they forgot that's right here he had been identified among them here he was in their boat there he is with us amen amen but in the crisis they forgot they had some Amnesia and in that moment they forgot his power over over evil spirits if he can control the evil spirit in the nature of Mary Magdalene he can control the evil spirits in the nature of that water and the winds they forgot you see he had been identified and they had identified with him but in their trial in their moment they had a crisis an identity crisis they forgot he was among them amen I I wanted to say this to you the pillar of fire has not left the church it didn't fly away when brother brandham left right the angel of his presence didn't leave I want you to know the message that we have is still Vindicated by the Holy Spirit God is here still among his people but in our crisis we forget and he identified himself he showed himself if we could just realize he's here the same yesterday today and forever amen there he is but he's go to sleep in your boat I I I just wonder you know in in in all of our resting after Revival if we haven't just kind of let him go in a corner and be ignored I wonder if the unwashed feet is now happening in our churches Jesus sitting in the corner and we sing about him we talk about him and you know talk about his glory of his past but don't recognize him in his presence I wonder if we know how to awake him how do you awake him by believing his word faith brings him on the scene amen that's what brings him on the scene is when he can get you to believe amen you got the money in the bank you got Jes Jesus in the boat amen all power come on there it is there brother Timothy just preached a sermon from and used from from the the ever everpresent water from the Rock and said he's always with you even Israel he was he never left them the rock followed them the Rocks following us today and I want to know what you know he's in speaking distance amen he's not out of touch he's not out of hearing he's not out of reach your voice can reach him Hallelujah if a maniac could come to his senses way over in Gat on the other side of the of the sea and come to his senses for a moment and say Jesus help or God help me and just whisper prayer and on the other side of the sea was Jesus and it says I got to leave here cuz there's one calling me hallelujah amen friends he's closer than what he was to the man in Gat he's right there in your boat you received the Holy Ghost come on don't have an identity crisis here and forget who it is you can write out to check this morning you don't have to be bankrupt you don't have to live in spiritual poverty you do not have to do without theine promises they're yours sir brother Bram called the Holy Ghost our Badge of identification amen Joshua buts is a fireman he walks into he walks into the coffee Sho the other day in uniform amen he had a badge he had a badge there up on his uniform that identified him as a fireman nobody had to guess who he was amen the way he was dressed the the the authority upon his chest the the you know the the whole thing there identified him I'm certified I am ready I am prepared to fight a fire any fire I'm ready I'm ready for the call amen well why because he had a badge of identification amen every believer has a badge of identification when you walk in a sick room amen you should be wearing that badge I am a born again blood Buck son or daughter of the Living God I have been commission to cast this devil out ain't no weapon formed against me go going to prosper amen I am an overcomer I have the badge of identification that I am a Son of God I have been filled with his Spirit washed in his blood my sins are gone from me I'm pure as pure can be therefore I have the right to use his name and in his name in his stead I am here to cast out devils in his stead I can speak in Heavenly language in his stad I I lay hands on the sick and they shall recover because I am here operating and with real IDE amen with a guaranteed Badge of authority am oh yes Jesus knowing who he was he looked into the scripture I wonder when we're living in a day when the Mysteries have been revealed not one mystery concerning the bride has been left to be uncovered except for the moment of his coming amen until except for that day and hour you come along to me and say and they have the Lord's coming he's going to come this certain certain time you'll see I said yeah I'll see I'll say yeah you'll know I said yeah I'll know they com and gone I knew because I knew already don't have to come to me and tell I know I know exactly when he's coming well I do too I even know the hour the hour you think not amen got you didn't I amen so you see again here here we are you know here we are we we we you know we we know every mystery has been revealed we're not waiting on it we ain't waiting for on another truth to be discovered to release some power to us it's been revealed amen it's up to you to draw from it the resources to take it listen don't go sit up and say this is a good Ox go you know it's great it's great for Golden oxen it'll do more than I than than that you take it in the hand of a Believer shamgar and it'll defeat 600 Philistines amen what in the hand of Faith you you can you can look at a promise of God well that's good for something it is good for anything take and use it you got an enemy amen amen don't don't strike at him a little bit hit at him till he's consumed show you mean business I want the enemy gone completely that's what's the matter with a lot of people come down to the altar they want to beat just a time or two you know and go back to their seat listen you know you you might you beat a little couple of times you know that's might be how much Victory you have why don't you beat on it until you know that enemy's dead that he he's so pulverized he'll never have control over me again I'll never be a slave to that thing amen but you see the identification of a scripture Christian brother bradam told us over and over again these signs shall follow them that believe now how can you call yourself a Believer and deny those words how can you do it and deny any words you can't do it you're not a Believer therefore signs can't follow because you just accept what you want to believe and the rest of it you don't believe it amen now so you see when the but comes the point comes the point that we become as the Bible said EAS and Zion we become comfortable with where we're at and we you know we we we don't want anything spiritual anymore we don't want nothing to to jar us out of of our comfort zone we get comfortable where we're at so we don't want thus sayth the Lord you know we want to just say we're a Christian and just go about our life and live however maintain our commission our our our confession that we're a Christian until sometimes we can't even identify with the supernatural anymore now I I want to just say to you I I want I I want it be I want it to to be where we have sons that are led by the spirit and I'm not talking about some super duper thing God showed me this and God showed me that and it's all a bunch of hoop nonsense but I'm talking about real leadership of the Holy Ghost where men and women are directed by the Holy Ghost and and they can identify with Supernatural things but of of course When sin disease afflicts us you know we we really can't see what God is doing the Supernatural and the preaching of an ordained messenger from God never stirs anymore it get it gets a point that it scorned and laughed at remember I want you to remember part of the Rapture if you study the Rapture sermon the first part the first half almost half of the Rapture that brother Brandon preaches on the Rapture sermon is he deals with there will be scoffers in the last days now I want you to remember this because that's very much a part of rapture hour if there were no scuffers we could say there is no Rapture because the Bible tells you in the last day scoffers shall arise so it is a sign it is an identification of the last days that there would be that there would be these times go ahead and answer it hello no it's not Jesus hang up so you see but but here again there will be scoffs in the last days you know where where there will be where they don't want to hear that don't hear such stuff as that they want don't want to hear about the power of God and the working of the Holy Spirit you know look look at the identity crisis that is in the world today look at the The Rage of the tattoos and they're for identity you know to show off for to express Rebellion or to identify yourself with some rock group or some cult you know to it it identifies as one who says to God I don't like how you made me you know it identifies you as one outside of Christ now I believe you can be born again repent of that and and I'm sorry your your past sin marks and everybody will look and see yeah but I also believe I also believe that even our God can remove that I remember a little girl in our youth camp a young lady that came and she'd cut herself so many times cuz she had scars across her wrist and she sat in the Youth Camp service and she said I'd love to raise my hands up and praise God but everybody would see my scars and they you know it's it identifies me with my past and my shame but oh I want so bad just to worship him and she just said just going to forget about my scars and what other will think and what they will see and and my past just rais my hands and worship him and she raised her hands and started worshiping God and all the scars went away yeah that happened right at l a camp it can happen again and again but you see they're looking for identification you see again your your spiritual attitude toward God's word identifies you as where you're standing you can say all you want to I'm a Christian and then you you have this attitude about church and going to church being subject to a pastor being subject to the word of God and you know you have this attitude you can say all you want to is a Christian your actions identify you as who you really are you're a fake you have false idea you're trying to get on the plane with a wrong identification you see again because a a real child of God can't wait till the church doors are open to get in there and worship their God Amen you see that will be an identification as an eagle they will gather where the carcass of the word is preached because that identifies Eagles amen I I just want to say it here we we we don't we don't serve up something that that has got maggot maggot Eden and something of a day pass we have the fresh meat of the word that is being preached here and where it's preach Eagles gather amen they gather there where where they can get blood all over them oh I like it when you get the Holy Ghost all over you brother Joe when you start worshiping when you start eating amen and this amen comes out what is a little blood here and Hallelujah and somebody jumps about in his seat they're getting all covered with the blood and the blood begins just just to get they're identified with what they are eating I'm an eagle I don't eat the caring of the world so well brother Tim there's Eagles I'll eat carrying let me tell you if anything will eat if they're starved I used to raise register Dairy goats and you couldn't get a goat to drink out of a mud butle they wanted their water fresh they would go and smell out of it and they had any kind of contamination it they'd walk away from it but if you starved them like the old man said about him you know he had a pack of dogs said Well mine's expensive what about yours no I my ey I feed them pretty cheap what do you feed them turnup greens I grow turnip greens for them and they eat turnup greens my dog would never eat turnip greens he said I wouldn't either after but but after two weeks he did starving things will eat anything starving Eagle will eat on anything amen a Thirsty Goat will drink out of a mud puddle I seen them do it in Africa I said My Goats won't do that I have to change their water five times in a show because they won't drink it and they didn't drink it they didn't produce milk they didn't produce milk they couldn't show so you see you see there again but what we have is is is the pure fresh meat of the word we ain't got the last bull out of the Vatican that by the way that's what they call it Papa bull amen we ain't got the last bull the latest bull out of the Vatican we have the Holy Ghost we have fresh Mana from Heaven amen we've got Mana amen that is kept in the presence of God in the kind of Glory that never breathes worms or stinks amen and we are identified with that kind of word and that kind of message and that's what we want we want it where the Holy Ghost is all over the word [Applause] amen now what about our message and this messenger are we so set in our educated ways and we you know made the message for just sophisticated people that we forgot how to shout we forgot how to sh oh they shout at ball game yeah they do but they shout at church too believers do they dance in dance hall yeah they do but they dance in church too believers do amen you know goodness I I've heard message preachers scold other preachers said if you move two foot away from the pulpit that's just Pentecostal Showmanship they forgot what kind of Preacher Brother brandom was by the way I happen to be in his meeting so I know a little bit about it but here's here's his description he says I haven't got very many Pulpit manners according to the I guess the Theology of the day so I get I get a little unruly and I think I I jumped on the pulpit like that and grabbed the microphone in my hand and sat there with my feet swinging off preaching as hard as I could and I come to myself I I didn't know what I was doing in a few minutes I got lost again and I found myself down in the middle of the aisle rolling up my trouser leg I don't know why but I would really like to stay there a while that's one thing I'd like to say was somewhere that I was sure enjoy myself and I lived up with that several days hallelujah I think we have forgot I think we have forgot how message preachers are to preach under anointing with the spirit of God that they get so beside yourself amen so well I'm a teacher okay be a teacher but get beside yourself get anointed with the Holy Ghost get the spirit of God moving until it moves on you you're rolling up your counter leg amen you're jumping off of the on the pull pit you're swinging your leg you're rejoicing and what you have received you're in the spirit make excuses if you want to get in denial if you want to others will come want to condemn dancing in the spirit they forget that's sitting in the seat of the scornful they forget where we came from they forget how a message preacher the original message preacher preached and he's sitting there watching some of them there as they're singing some songs and get the dance in the spirit and begins to criticize in his heart and he says well maybe I hadn't got enough Victory as he began to try to think in the Bible okay where's dancing in the Bible Bible where dancing he's sitting over in the seat of the scornful and he said I sitting over there and he said well first thing you know he said I kind of got my Methodist foot a Paton I wonder if people even got a Methodist foot he said I got my Methodist foot padding and he said you know I got to thinking I got to going back you know where is that in the Bible and they're dancing they're they're making a Tavern out of my church you know what where is that in the Bible so he sitting there oh marryam oh yeah maram what' she do she danc yes why cuz after a victory David danced what after the word came back oh you say Brother D he he was out of the will of God and he got out there and did God Serv out his will and he danced and God cursed him that's not why God cursed him cursed him they cursed there and the and and the man died because he tried to handle steady the and they were bringing it the wrong way that's why he died not cuz they were dancing cuz the next time he goes to dancing in front when when the when the word is coming back and the Ark is there and David now dances before the Lord come on Amen and again it was Victory and brother Brandon began to look and he said it Victory it was Victory it was Victory maybe I ain't got enough Victory and out in the aisle he went dancing with them I think they forgot yeah amen I think amen I tell you what I I think they forgot brother Brandon preaching about David and he said David was a dancer yes he and he said he got five stones and put it in a sling there in his pouch and got one in the sling and he went out dancing amen he went out dancing cuz he knew that giant was going to fall down amen you say we got to dance after or that he falls no we can dance before he falls we can dance until Satan's kingdom comes down amen don't sit in the seat of the scar ball amen rejoice in the god of your salvation amen we got a real identity in this day and I tell if that identifies us as a Believer hallelujah hallelujah can you imagine claiming a message and condemning tongues and inter ration and forget the original message preacher amen our prophet got so carried away in the spirit that while preaching he spoke in other tongues and interpreted saying he's a rock in the weary land and a shelter in the time of storm I want to tell you today he's still a rock he's my rock today amen he's a shelter in the time of storm that interpretation is still good today that word is still real today man it's a real identification of a Holy Ghost Church Hallelujah but we forget where we come from we become like the mule who don't know his daddy or his mama and the haha days of Mires are passing you know because they can't remember they're now they don't have a pedigree they have nothing to identify themselves with but our identification goes all the way to the book of Acts Hallelujah our identification goes back to the day the Holy Spirit came and filled 120 with the Holy Ghost and they were moved with the with the spirit of God somebody help me preach amen our identification comes up when the Holy Ghost came immediately the sick were healed amen that power came that Deliverance was there that's the real identification sir your pedigree may not go back to a horse and and a donkey but let me tell you that's a mule and you can ha ha hul all you want to days of Miracles have pass it only happened when brother brandham was here and let me tell you brother bram's gone but but God did Miracles before brother brandham and he'll do Miracles after brother Brown he still heals cancer today he still delivers come on he still saves us the Lost he still heals the sick be a new with a new religion if you want to but but I know my pedigree Hallelujah I know I have been birthed from above I know I have a birth certificate and my name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and ain't no devil in hell can take it up ain't no preacher can remove it nobody can keep me out the Rapture I am a bloodb Son of God washing his blood anointed for this hour I am too anointed to be disappointed I am too overcome with the spirit to be overcome by the world I am more than a coer I'm not just a little coer I am more than a coer hallelujah hallelujah and so are you you are a coer that's your real IDE blessed be the name of the Lord I said blessed be the name of the Lord amen get the do together let the two come together let the two come together put some faith on the word by his tring heal demon have to go every evil spirit has to be accepted to the name of
