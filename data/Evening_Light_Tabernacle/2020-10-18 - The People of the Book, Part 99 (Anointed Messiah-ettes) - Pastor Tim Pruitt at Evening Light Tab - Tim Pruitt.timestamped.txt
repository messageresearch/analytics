[39:57] when we can have
[39:58] full deliverance amen
[40:01] let's talk to the lord today maybe you
[40:04] want to take your request before him
[40:06] today as we pray
[40:09] father as we bow before you we want to
[40:12] express our thanksgiving
[40:15] what a mighty god we serve an awesome
[40:18] lord
[40:19] father who has given us such a mighty
[40:21] message such a mighty word in this last
[40:24] day
[40:26] that you would call us sons of god and
[40:28] daughters of god and
[40:30] ordain us to be here in this very hour
[40:34] we believe that we have been predestined
[40:36] for this moment in time
[40:38] we're asking lord that you'll minister
[40:40] to hearts and lives
[40:42] you'll speak to souls lord according to
[40:45] the needs
[40:47] you'll just bring deliverance in in your
[40:49] children's life lord
[40:50] as we said not just deliverance but
[40:52] total deliverance
[40:54] oh god we're looking for people to be
[40:57] totally surrendered
[40:59] we want to be totally surrendered
[41:01] totally committed
[41:03] our whole lives surrendered to you i
[41:06] pray lord that you'd anoint the word
[41:08] lord as we
[41:09] read it today and anoint us as your
[41:12] children
[41:13] anoint here is to hear and anoint the
[41:16] speaker to speak
[41:17] lord wherever the people are around the
[41:19] world i pray that you'll just
[41:21] minister to them in a mighty way lord
[41:24] for we ask it in jesus name we thank you
[41:28] for it lord in jesus name
[41:30] amen amen god bless you
[41:34] let's turn to romans chapter 8 and verse
[41:36] 17
[41:37] for our scripture reading this morning
[41:40] and i hope you're ready for
[41:41] to have church today to enter into the
[41:44] presence of the lord and let him speak
[41:46] to you
[41:48] amen so may the holy spirit just
[41:51] reveal himself to you in a very very
[41:54] spectacular way today
[41:55] romans chapter 8 verse 17 and if
[41:58] children didn't heirs and heirs of god
[42:00] and joint heirs with christ
[42:02] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[42:04] may be also
[42:05] glorified together
[42:08] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[42:10] present time are not worthy to be
[42:12] compared with the glory which shall be
[42:14] revealed
[42:15] in us for the earnest expectation
[42:19] of the creature waiteth for the
[42:21] manifestation
[42:22] that word is display of the sons of god
[42:26] then turn with me to john
[42:29] [Music]
[42:30] i think his first john 1 and john 1 and
[42:33] 12.
[42:34] but as many as received him
[42:37] to them gave he power to become the sons
[42:40] of god
[42:42] even to them that believe on his name
[42:45] amen how many believe on his name today
[42:48] amen he gives you power then to become
[42:51] sons of god god bless you can be seated
[42:55] as i was thinking this past week there's
[42:57] certain things that has
[42:59] kind of rolled over my heart as we
[43:02] ministered sunday on and hit different
[43:05] points and different things
[43:07] that um maybe we will emphasize again
[43:10] this morning
[43:12] we will see how the holy spirit leads
[43:14] there's some really
[43:16] really um wonderful things that lay
[43:19] in the scripture and in the message that
[43:22] god has seen in this last day
[43:24] i you know i was reflecting back um
[43:28] to what was available back in the
[43:31] early 1970s where there was little print
[43:35] in those days of brother branham's
[43:37] sermons
[43:39] and there was a man by the name of
[43:41] brother jack palmer
[43:43] whose name sometimes you'll hear on tape
[43:45] brother branham referred to him he
[43:47] compiled a
[43:48] book of quotes and actually i later
[43:51] would find out
[43:52] some of them were misquotes and called
[43:54] it the nugget book
[43:57] and one of the questions that was asking
[44:00] there
[44:00] what does the bride of christ look for
[44:04] and then you know the the conclusion was
[44:08] um as you can kind of stack your quotes
[44:11] any way that you want them to get the
[44:13] desired
[44:14] um answer that you want
[44:17] that um he the conclusion was that there
[44:20] was to
[44:20] be nothing happened but the coming of
[44:23] the lord that we're just to wait
[44:25] for his coming and and i found that he
[44:28] was
[44:28] he was right at least he was partially
[44:30] right anyway
[44:32] but what he didn't realize was that the
[44:35] coming of the lord was
[44:37] to be in bright form where
[44:40] where there must be manifested messiahs
[44:43] and this would take place before the
[44:46] meeting in the air
[44:48] as um they're the coming of the lord is
[44:51] in
[44:51] phases we could see that outlined in the
[44:54] scriptures that shout the voice and the
[44:56] trump
[44:57] and um so three different phases of his
[45:00] coming
[45:01] and um we we didn't understand
[45:05] or comprehend or wrap our minds around
[45:08] all that god was doing i'm not sure that
[45:10] we have totally wrapped our minds around
[45:13] all that god is doing in this age
[45:16] um the song says i want to know more
[45:18] about my lord i think
[45:20] that should be something we should be
[45:22] looking into
[45:23] the message daily and into the bible
[45:26] to see what is promised and prophesied
[45:29] for this hour
[45:31] um but nevertheless um you know there
[45:34] there were three different phases that
[45:37] would come and
[45:38] and there would be the word coming to a
[45:41] prophet and of course that is the coming
[45:43] of christ and then there would be the
[45:46] the bride coming of christ which would
[45:49] be the word
[45:50] made manifest in a body of believers
[45:54] and then finally and ultimately and what
[45:56] we still look along for
[45:58] is the groom coming to christ where we
[46:01] will meet the lord in the
[46:02] air but all of this is part of his
[46:05] coming
[46:06] it was very necessary for god to send a
[46:09] message of restoration
[46:11] to send his word in this generation to
[46:15] open it back
[46:16] up where that we could understand um
[46:19] what had been lost down to the ages
[46:22] and so it's very important for the word
[46:24] then to be revealed to prophet because
[46:27] that's not god's only way
[46:29] of revealing his word and it wouldn't be
[46:32] a new word but it would be a restoration
[46:35] or an uncovering or
[46:37] another look back into the scripture
[46:41] as um the um the dust and the
[46:44] dirt of that had been covered by
[46:47] fragments
[46:48] of man's ideas down to the ages had
[46:51] covered up the truths of god's word and
[46:54] and god would he would reveal his
[46:57] secrets to his servants the prophets
[47:00] and um there would be a restoration
[47:03] of that word and then of course some
[47:06] many of us who were in that era of time
[47:09] we thought because we had the word the
[47:11] message was come we was
[47:13] already ready for the coming of the lord
[47:15] and so
[47:16] therefore you know it was we were
[47:19] ready we were prepared because we had
[47:22] the message
[47:23] and we didn't realize that it had to
[47:25] take on flesh
[47:28] we didn't realize that not only would it
[47:30] take on flesh but there were many
[47:32] that would that would be there in the
[47:34] promise of that word that
[47:36] wouldn't even be materialized yet they
[47:38] were we had to wait for them to come
[47:40] because their names were in the book of
[47:42] life
[47:44] and and of course um you know then
[47:47] then we we um
[47:50] we looked there in that era of time as
[47:53] as we have
[47:54] reflected back um in the in the sermons
[47:57] that we preached on is there hope for
[47:59] revival and
[48:00] you know go away jesus and how that you
[48:03] know we
[48:04] we've let christ our let the faith
[48:07] and the word of promise just kind of
[48:09] grow dormant in our lives and
[48:12] the churches settle down just content to
[48:15] argue out the message as we sail
[48:18] along the way and you know debate this
[48:21] part or talk about this great event or
[48:23] that
[48:24] event of the past and and uh
[48:27] not not realize that we're
[48:30] we're we were coming to a time where
[48:33] that there had to be there has to be an
[48:36] awakening
[48:38] where we has to come to a realization
[48:41] that it's more than just talking about
[48:44] the message and
[48:46] and discussing its higher points or
[48:49] it's more than just talking about the
[48:51] great
[48:52] miracles of that would take place and
[48:55] and now that god would singularly use a
[48:59] man to be a messenger in this
[49:01] last day an elijah prophet a forerunner
[49:05] to forerun the second coming of christ
[49:09] we didn't even realize that not only is
[49:11] he was he the forerunner
[49:12] of that meeting in the air but he was
[49:14] also the forerunner of the bride coming
[49:16] of christ
[49:18] that he would that he would point to a
[49:20] word
[49:21] born bride even as john the baptist
[49:24] pointed to the groom when he came
[49:26] and so he was identifying that there
[49:28] would be a bride that would come
[49:30] in this last day and and she would be a
[49:34] people in whom the word would be on
[49:37] display in
[49:39] she would become manifested messiahs
[49:43] now of course you know those who only
[49:46] saw the word coming of christ to a
[49:48] prophet
[49:49] and they stopped there they missed a
[49:51] very important phase of the lord's
[49:53] coming
[49:54] and you know so the church kind of
[49:58] settled down and put everything on the
[50:00] hold as it was
[50:02] and we were just told to wait and just
[50:04] grow and mature
[50:06] and get adopted and what most don't
[50:10] realize is that
[50:11] the true baptism of the holy ghost we
[50:14] are adopted and placed in the body of
[50:17] christ
[50:18] if you have that true baptism you are
[50:21] adopted sons
[50:23] and as adopted sons you do not have to
[50:25] crouch down
[50:26] like scared children and hide when a
[50:29] goliath comes stomping around and makes
[50:31] his threats
[50:33] we know that even a little slingshot
[50:36] of faith that we we have played with
[50:40] as census children that some pass off is
[50:43] just a
[50:43] child's toy or or something very
[50:46] elementary or
[50:47] thought is something not very deep but
[50:50] yet
[50:51] that little slingshot of faith can make
[50:54] giants fall when it's loaded with a
[50:57] stone
[50:58] from the name of jesus
[51:01] amen and and of course it is something
[51:04] that
[51:05] is is maybe this thought is elementary
[51:08] but it's something of great necessity
[51:11] that we be a people of faith in this
[51:14] last day
[51:16] and brother branham would would even
[51:19] remark about this
[51:20] and as he said and what it takes to
[51:22] overcome all of unbelief
[51:24] our faith and he says um god said i've
[51:27] heard the cries of my people
[51:29] i remember my promise which i had with
[51:31] abraham and today
[51:33] when the church is sick and the sickness
[51:36] is piled up
[51:37] and the people because of intellectual
[51:40] pride and so forth is getting away from
[51:42] divine healing
[51:43] getting away from the holy spirit god
[51:46] still hears the cry
[51:48] of his people i'm so glad for that here
[51:52] today
[51:52] that god still hears the cry even after
[51:55] men
[51:56] forget even after
[51:59] you know we just kind of lollygag around
[52:02] or just
[52:03] may enter into a slothful dormant stage
[52:06] god doesn't forget his promise and he
[52:10] hears the cry of his people and he sees
[52:12] the
[52:13] need that is in the body and if there
[52:16] was ever a need
[52:18] it is a time that we should awaken
[52:21] our faith to claim every redemptive
[52:24] promise that god made in his word
[52:27] amen but as brother branham would remark
[52:30] himself he said we have not used his
[52:32] faith in so long
[52:34] and his spirit and his faith so long
[52:36] till it merely goes to sleep in our
[52:38] souls
[52:40] and that's why we've got to come back to
[52:42] a faith to a
[52:43] living faith that works amen
[52:47] that's that's where brother branham
[52:49] would point it out and
[52:50] feast of the trumpets and he says that
[52:53] we find the scripture in malachi 4
[52:56] there's an anointing that comes down
[52:59] to restore again that original faith
[53:02] and i just want to say that that's
[53:04] exactly where we stand today
[53:06] there's an anointing that has come down
[53:10] it wasn't just a word but an anointing
[53:13] an anointed word a word with life in it
[53:17] a word with transforming power in it a
[53:20] word that will change you
[53:22] amen there has to be anointing come down
[53:24] and restore that
[53:26] original faith and that's what we see
[53:29] revelation 10 shows that that mighty
[53:32] angel
[53:33] christ an anointing coming down
[53:36] you say it wasn't an anointing it was an
[53:38] anointing it was not a physical return
[53:41] of christ it was an anointing coming
[53:43] down
[53:44] to anoint a word in this day
[53:48] and some messiahs who will take that
[53:50] word
[53:51] and press it down toward the end time
[53:54] now here we are in this time you know
[53:57] but
[53:57] you know even even now we stand and
[54:00] we're we've been
[54:01] in a in a really really serious time as
[54:04] we've entered into
[54:06] 2020. you know and it's it's a it's a
[54:09] it's a struggling time it's a difficult
[54:12] time
[54:12] for many that is in the world i think
[54:15] you could agree with that
[54:17] amen and and you know i i just shared
[54:20] this little
[54:21] little thing with someone with several
[54:24] people
[54:25] you know brother joe preached on
[54:26] impossible math
[54:28] and and then someone said but if 2020
[54:31] was a math problem
[54:33] if you're going down a river at two
[54:36] miles an hour and your canoe
[54:39] loses a wheel how much pancake mix would
[54:42] you need to
[54:43] re-shingle your roof
[54:47] you see it's been one of those kinds of
[54:49] a year you know
[54:50] every kind of thought every kind of
[54:53] mix-up idea
[54:55] everything to try to to scatter
[54:58] men's faith and to keep their faith from
[55:01] the promises of the word of god
[55:03] and everything to try to to do but it's
[55:06] in those
[55:07] moments that we as sons of god can
[55:10] exercise our faith that we can put the
[55:14] faith that we have been taught
[55:16] to work amen and and
[55:19] many of us even in this building today
[55:22] we have met
[55:22] with the thing that was feared and we
[55:25] have risen above it
[55:28] amen that our faith has conquered it
[55:32] amen i think of brother kenny sister
[55:34] genie today that
[55:35] that are home and and they're recovering
[55:38] they're on the man
[55:39] i just want to tell them again your
[55:42] faith
[55:44] your faith has had an opportunity to go
[55:48] to work and you see it working
[55:52] i mean this this is exactly where we
[55:55] stand in this day it's a troublesome
[55:57] time
[55:58] but it's a day where faith has to be
[56:01] fine-tuned
[56:03] and we've got to know how to use faith
[56:06] in this hour even brother branham would
[56:09] tell us
[56:09] in his in his discernment that he would
[56:13] that god would gift him with and it
[56:16] would tell them who they were and
[56:18] where they come from and what their
[56:20] situation was
[56:21] and it made them know that god knows
[56:26] that there's a god present amen that god
[56:29] had to be there
[56:31] and that he could be touched with their
[56:33] feelings
[56:35] right amen but but he said you know many
[56:38] of them
[56:39] will stand before me and he says they
[56:42] think their faith is way up here
[56:44] but he said they hadn't got faith and
[56:47] they you know they're saying they got
[56:49] faith but it isn't up here it's like
[56:51] it's like
[56:52] tuning a string on an instrument when it
[56:55] comes up and coincides with this up here
[56:58] and then things are ready it's got to
[57:00] come up and coincide with the word
[57:04] and any demon that's got that person
[57:06] bound has got to turn
[57:07] loose when that kind of faith comes
[57:11] that was the whole purpose of god's sin
[57:13] and a prophet
[57:14] and our generation was to tune our faith
[57:19] amen to make it tighter to bring it to
[57:22] where it is saying
[57:24] every time you strum it jesus christ the
[57:27] same yesterday today and forever
[57:30] not a people whose faith is out of tune
[57:32] but a people
[57:33] whose faith matches the word
[57:36] whatever the word said they believe it
[57:39] and it
[57:40] demonstrates it amen now again
[57:43] this is what he would say i'm catching
[57:45] your spirit
[57:47] i'm trying to get your spirit where it's
[57:50] caught and
[57:51] and i can catch it and then tune
[57:54] that spirit he didn't use the word tune
[57:57] in there but he said i'll catch
[57:59] that spirit and he says there's
[58:02] something hindering them
[58:03] and laying in the way and one little
[58:06] shadow
[58:07] will vibrate it away and then he said it
[58:10] then he said
[58:11] there was a little lady standing on the
[58:13] platform a moment ago and he says
[58:16] here's a little inside something i was
[58:18] catching her spirit
[58:20] and he said and when you're projecting
[58:23] when he gather her spirit
[58:25] to hold steady and that would would
[58:28] project to her your very thought and you
[58:31] change her thinking
[58:34] and get her centered on christ
[58:39] you know you know again this is the
[58:41] whole problem with sickness
[58:43] and the and problem with diseases is
[58:46] because
[58:47] your your thoughts are centered on will
[58:50] i ever be well
[58:51] again the pain that i'm feeling
[58:54] the situation at hand what the doctor
[58:57] says
[59:00] even what miss google says you know it's
[59:03] it's all
[59:04] on on that and brother branham would
[59:06] take and by a gift
[59:08] center the person's mind on christ
[59:13] they might change her way of thinking
[59:15] said she can't change herself
[59:17] she's in a world she's in a canoe
[59:20] and there's a then she's from the wheel
[59:23] and and you know
[59:24] how much pancake mix will it take to fix
[59:27] the roof
[59:28] it's just scattered from here to there
[59:31] from here to there
[59:33] but if you can ever get them centered on
[59:35] christ
[59:38] amen not a christ of the past
[59:41] not a christ who walked the shores of
[59:43] galilee but a christ that is here
[59:46] that is present that's a healer that's a
[59:49] deliverer
[59:51] that there's nothing too hard for our
[59:54] lord
[59:55] amen that he can change situation
[59:57] remember that's what he had to do with
[59:59] sarah
[1:00:00] he came and called her name and told her
[1:00:03] of a promise
[1:00:05] and she was doubting and he had to pull
[1:00:07] her thoughts
[1:00:08] back to the the word and she he pointed
[1:00:12] back to himself and he said is there
[1:00:13] anything
[1:00:14] that it's too hard for the lord
[1:00:18] and that's the whole thing when we can
[1:00:19] get centered back on christ again
[1:00:22] amen that he is god that is the same
[1:00:26] today
[1:00:27] that is here present among us amen
[1:00:30] there's no
[1:00:31] sin that can stand in front of that
[1:00:34] there's no sickness there's no disease
[1:00:36] there's no problem you can stand in
[1:00:38] front of that when you get them
[1:00:40] centered on christ the devil has to go
[1:00:45] amen and that's why preaching on faith
[1:00:47] is so
[1:00:48] necessary and that's why i'm pounding
[1:00:51] service
[1:00:51] after service to change your thinking
[1:00:55] and get it centered on christ
[1:00:59] amen now brother branham talked about
[1:01:02] a woman that who you know went to see a
[1:01:05] young girl
[1:01:06] she actually was um in her mid-30s and
[1:01:09] was teaching
[1:01:10] college and she met a psychiatrist and
[1:01:12] she'd never smoked or drank or
[1:01:15] uh and all her life she's a fine girl
[1:01:17] her parents were christians
[1:01:19] and her father a doctor and she gave her
[1:01:21] life to the
[1:01:22] to christ at a a young stage but this
[1:01:25] man began to work on her
[1:01:27] and he began to be begin to work on
[1:01:30] her thinking now i want you to stop and
[1:01:33] think a minute
[1:01:34] because this is where we are today you
[1:01:37] know it's here
[1:01:38] there they've got you where you don't
[1:01:40] know what to believe
[1:01:44] amen i mean every every kind of opinion
[1:01:48] every kind of thought the president's
[1:01:51] got one his opposing party's got another
[1:01:53] and
[1:01:54] the cdc's got another and everybody's
[1:01:57] got their own
[1:01:58] thought and weekly it changes
[1:02:01] and they got people's mind in a world
[1:02:06] amen but do you see this and this is
[1:02:09] what the world wants to do to you
[1:02:11] get your mind in a world
[1:02:14] exactly right oh is it really wrong to
[1:02:17] cut your hair is it really wrong to
[1:02:19] paint your face
[1:02:20] is it really wrong or can't you have a
[1:02:22] couple of beers and still be a christian
[1:02:26] you see it's trying to put the minds of
[1:02:28] the people
[1:02:29] in a world and you're hearing it from
[1:02:32] every side
[1:02:33] every side every side a barrage of
[1:02:36] voices
[1:02:39] am i coming against you and this
[1:02:42] this this psychiatrist began to work on
[1:02:45] this girl and
[1:02:46] said you mean to tell me you never
[1:02:48] kissed a boy
[1:02:50] you know not one time in my life no you
[1:02:51] mean you've never had a little drink in
[1:02:53] a party
[1:02:54] never well girl you just don't know what
[1:02:56] you're missing
[1:02:57] you know and him being a psychiatrist he
[1:03:01] swung the girl's mind
[1:03:03] until she became so evil and bad
[1:03:08] until she don't even want to hear the
[1:03:10] name of jesus
[1:03:11] spoke in her presence think of that
[1:03:15] that's what america has come
[1:03:19] got the minds of the people the nation
[1:03:22] in such a world
[1:03:24] amen until she's become so evil i'm
[1:03:26] talking about america
[1:03:28] and don't smirk out there in the world
[1:03:30] today your country is just
[1:03:32] as bad and mandarin all of them are
[1:03:34] controlled by the devil we got a whole
[1:03:37] world whose mind is being given to the
[1:03:39] beast
[1:03:40] are you with me amen and she
[1:03:43] america the the the world has become so
[1:03:47] evil and bad
[1:03:48] till she don't even want to hear the
[1:03:50] name of jesus spoke in her presence
[1:03:53] and even her father and mother can't see
[1:03:55] her no more and she lost her mind and
[1:03:58] this week we'll go to institution for
[1:04:00] shock treatment it's because
[1:04:02] her thoughts were turned from
[1:04:05] christ unto what a psychiatrist was
[1:04:08] moving her mind
[1:04:13] and what are we here for this morning is
[1:04:15] to move your mind
[1:04:18] this is what brother branham would even
[1:04:20] say what he was doing i'm moving your
[1:04:22] mind
[1:04:24] even paul would say let this mind
[1:04:28] be in you that was also in christ jesus
[1:04:32] amen and what we are here for is to move
[1:04:35] your mind
[1:04:37] and your thinking from the things of the
[1:04:39] world unto the things of god
[1:04:41] which is eternally and that's what
[1:04:43] preaching is for is to convert the
[1:04:46] thinking
[1:04:46] to a higher and better to a place where
[1:04:49] christ is
[1:04:50] until you become converted then your
[1:04:53] mind
[1:04:54] reaches for those things that are above
[1:04:56] so here we are
[1:04:58] we're living in a time where we've got
[1:05:00] to have our mindset
[1:05:03] on christ and now we've got television
[1:05:07] movies education media social media
[1:05:10] that have changed the thinking of our
[1:05:12] world
[1:05:13] as you've learned in the last few days
[1:05:15] our social media
[1:05:17] and twitter and facebook and google and
[1:05:19] all of them you know if they
[1:05:22] if they don't want if they don't want
[1:05:25] something heard that would
[1:05:26] would hurt their candidate they don't
[1:05:28] want that spoken
[1:05:30] they silence those voices they might
[1:05:33] say it's like nobody can make or is
[1:05:36] allowed to
[1:05:37] look at all of the facts or all the
[1:05:39] things and make up their own mind
[1:05:41] they want to make up your mind
[1:05:45] and when the bible said these have one
[1:05:47] mind and they give their power and their
[1:05:49] strength to the
[1:05:50] beast here we are
[1:05:53] it's a crazy world that we're living in
[1:05:56] the world has lost
[1:05:57] all sense of decency there's no
[1:06:01] let me just say to you if you're looking
[1:06:03] for normal times again
[1:06:05] it's never going to be normal again what
[1:06:08] you knew
[1:06:08] is normal will never come again the
[1:06:11] world is loss
[1:06:13] of sense of decency there's never
[1:06:16] there is no going back to what we
[1:06:19] knew is normal
[1:06:23] what you're seeing now is becoming the
[1:06:25] norm for the world
[1:06:26] and i'm telling you that's why we must
[1:06:30] leave it
[1:06:39] we must leave it
[1:06:43] amen listen the bible said
[1:06:47] as it was in the days of noah in genesis
[1:06:51] 6 and 5 and god saw the wickedness of
[1:06:53] man
[1:06:54] was great on the earth and that every
[1:06:57] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[1:06:59] was only evil continually certainly that
[1:07:03] describes
[1:07:04] again our day amen the bible said in
[1:07:08] that time
[1:07:09] there were great men and men of renown
[1:07:12] great sciences that came up and we're
[1:07:15] living in a day
[1:07:16] where that that education has reached
[1:07:19] its height and
[1:07:20] and science has reached its glory and
[1:07:22] all these other things
[1:07:24] and men are now men are renowned you
[1:07:28] with me
[1:07:29] amen but you see what does it produce
[1:07:32] these men of renown what are they
[1:07:34] producing an
[1:07:35] age of wickedness an age
[1:07:38] where where the wickedness of man is
[1:07:41] great in the earth
[1:07:42] and every imagination of the thoughts of
[1:07:45] his heart
[1:07:46] on evil continually
[1:07:51] you know you cannot read a news article
[1:07:55] whether it's conservative or whether
[1:07:57] it's
[1:07:58] the other it doesn't matter if it's a
[1:08:00] conservative
[1:08:01] news site or whether it's a liberal news
[1:08:04] site
[1:08:05] they've got expletives you know with
[1:08:07] with that
[1:08:08] where they don't leave nothing really to
[1:08:11] your imaginations
[1:08:14] fewer you know asterisks there to block
[1:08:16] out a few
[1:08:17] letters as if that makes any difference
[1:08:22] things that would have never been said
[1:08:25] but it swung
[1:08:26] the minds of men until they're on evil
[1:08:30] continually
[1:08:33] amen but i want you to remember in the
[1:08:36] days of noah
[1:08:38] there was not only noah representing the
[1:08:41] church who found grace and decided the
[1:08:43] lord
[1:08:43] and went through the flood of
[1:08:45] tribulation but and passed over into a
[1:08:48] new land of the
[1:08:49] uh of um to a new earth but i want you
[1:08:53] to know
[1:08:54] that in that same time while men were
[1:08:57] choosing women
[1:08:58] such as they desired there was a man
[1:09:01] who walked with god there was a man who
[1:09:05] was
[1:09:06] also a man of renown the world didn't
[1:09:09] call him a man of renown but he's a man
[1:09:11] of renown
[1:09:13] in fact in that matter the names of
[1:09:15] those men of renown
[1:09:16] are not even known today but this man's
[1:09:19] name is still known
[1:09:21] enoch who walked with god enoch met
[1:09:25] dedicated a man a consecrated man who
[1:09:29] was
[1:09:29] dedicated to a purpose to a walk with
[1:09:33] god
[1:09:33] who kept going hype
[1:09:37] who didn't stay where he was you
[1:09:40] cannot be an enoch and stay where you
[1:09:43] are
[1:09:44] you've got to advance you got to take
[1:09:47] another step higher
[1:09:51] enoch brother branham would
[1:09:54] use him and he said you're going to have
[1:09:56] to be
[1:09:57] an enoch you're going to have to have an
[1:10:02] enoch type of faith
[1:10:05] and he would even say you know i
[1:10:09] i i don't might not have the faith
[1:10:12] to walk like enoch dud and take an
[1:10:14] afternoon walk with god and
[1:10:16] and and not die and just go on up home
[1:10:19] he said i may not
[1:10:21] i may not have that but i don't want to
[1:10:23] stand in the way of someone who would
[1:10:26] amen he kept saying i don't want to trip
[1:10:29] up
[1:10:30] or stand in the way of someone who does
[1:10:34] have that kind of faith
[1:10:35] because she said it's the kind of faith
[1:10:37] we're going to have to have we will be
[1:10:39] who are alive and remain that they come
[1:10:41] the lord shall be
[1:10:42] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:10:45] eye and caught up together
[1:10:46] with the resurrected dead to meet the
[1:10:48] lord in the air
[1:10:50] and forever be with him
[1:10:55] this would make brother branham cry out
[1:10:58] as he come to the end of his time and
[1:11:00] he's
[1:11:01] and he would he would say this and just
[1:11:04] once more lord
[1:11:05] lord years i wanted to see this happen
[1:11:09] maybe it will
[1:11:12] just once more lord one more great move
[1:11:16] of the spirit
[1:11:18] one more time lord and the church might
[1:11:21] receive
[1:11:22] rapture and faith to go in
[1:11:27] my certainly as we look at it
[1:11:31] as he and he would say in the message
[1:11:33] token i'm looking for a
[1:11:35] time of the break forth of the spirit
[1:11:39] of god in these last days that we're now
[1:11:41] living in
[1:11:42] for another surge of the holy spirit
[1:11:44] into the church
[1:11:45] a rapture in faith for a rapture and
[1:11:48] faith just before it comes
[1:11:49] and everything is setting straight in
[1:11:52] order for that
[1:11:54] i believe we received the rapture and
[1:11:56] message
[1:11:58] i believe we have raptured revelation
[1:12:02] amen that the word has been revealed
[1:12:05] but at the same time you know they're
[1:12:08] they're still
[1:12:09] we still must have our faith too
[1:12:14] to move up another notch
[1:12:17] amen until that we are beating in step
[1:12:21] with the word that is prophesied for
[1:12:23] this hour
[1:12:26] oh my now brother branham would talk
[1:12:29] about this
[1:12:30] and why christ speak and and he would
[1:12:32] say
[1:12:33] you know i i i said i think anyone
[1:12:36] any boy a girl man or woman you know an
[1:12:40] intellectual
[1:12:41] that have an intellectual conception of
[1:12:43] what
[1:12:44] they think the word is they can never
[1:12:46] have a full foundation
[1:12:48] until they've met that light that brings
[1:12:51] the word to reality
[1:12:53] and i said that i think the church and
[1:12:55] his practice
[1:12:56] no matter how intellectual and
[1:12:58] fundamental it might be
[1:13:00] that church cannot strive until the
[1:13:04] supernatural is made known among that
[1:13:06] people
[1:13:07] and they see it something they can talk
[1:13:11] to that will talk
[1:13:12] back to them that vindicates this
[1:13:14] written word
[1:13:15] you know moses heard that amen he had
[1:13:18] heard that
[1:13:19] already the word was there it was
[1:13:21] written in the word
[1:13:23] that that abraham your your people will
[1:13:26] sojourn
[1:13:27] in a strange land and but after 400
[1:13:30] years
[1:13:31] i will bring them out i can't bring them
[1:13:34] into it now because
[1:13:36] the iniquity of the amorite is not yet
[1:13:39] full
[1:13:40] you see they had to reach a certain
[1:13:43] level
[1:13:44] until god would be justified to drive
[1:13:47] him off that land
[1:13:50] is that right sin would have to reach a
[1:13:53] certain height
[1:13:55] and god has also had to let it
[1:13:58] wait until this last age where sin
[1:14:02] reaches a certain height until god is
[1:14:05] justified to call it an
[1:14:07] end and take a people in a rapture and
[1:14:09] send tribulation on the earth
[1:14:13] amen but moses you know he
[1:14:17] he he there was was called out by god
[1:14:21] because god had written in the word but
[1:14:23] it's not enough
[1:14:25] for god to write it in the word
[1:14:29] you know it's not enough just to write
[1:14:32] it in the word it's got to be quickened
[1:14:37] and then god's also wrote it in the word
[1:14:39] that after
[1:14:40] seven church ages i will call a bride
[1:14:43] out
[1:14:45] and i'll bring it to an end and i'll
[1:14:48] pour judgment out upon the earth
[1:14:51] now moses knew all of this
[1:14:53] intellectually
[1:14:55] the seed that was born in him was laying
[1:14:58] in his heart
[1:14:59] and he cried through his intellectual
[1:15:01] experience with the word
[1:15:03] to try to deliver the children of israel
[1:15:07] and he knew it was the time and he
[1:15:09] believed that he was the man
[1:15:11] he you know that the scriptures had said
[1:15:14] that they had already been there 400
[1:15:16] years and
[1:15:17] it was now time he could look and he
[1:15:20] said but the bible the word what he told
[1:15:23] abraham
[1:15:24] is now come to pass we've been here 400
[1:15:26] years
[1:15:29] amen we've been at that time
[1:15:32] and and we we have we have
[1:15:35] blocked time along until we're here and
[1:15:38] yeah
[1:15:39] i was born a strange child and and
[1:15:42] my mother and dad said there was a light
[1:15:44] that accompanied me my birth and
[1:15:46] and all of the things that took place
[1:15:48] and they knew i was a special child
[1:15:51] and i've been raised up and trained and
[1:15:53] i'll take this training
[1:15:55] and i'll deliver the children of israel
[1:15:58] but it didn't work it was only
[1:16:01] intellectual
[1:16:04] that's why we've got to take what we
[1:16:06] have received and heard
[1:16:08] intellectually and have it quickened to
[1:16:11] us
[1:16:13] amen we we know we have lived a time out
[1:16:17] also
[1:16:18] come on you know the the bible didn't
[1:16:22] say after 400 years for us
[1:16:24] but he didn't leave symbols in the
[1:16:26] scripture right
[1:16:28] amen he said he he left in revelation
[1:16:32] chapter one through three he left a
[1:16:34] whole
[1:16:35] diagram of the word that he would lay it
[1:16:38] out and he was
[1:16:39] able to show it you know from here it
[1:16:42] would go from here and to the messenger
[1:16:44] and these are angels and these are men
[1:16:46] and
[1:16:47] and these are ages and these are times
[1:16:52] and we know now we have run out of time
[1:16:56] we have run out of ages in fact the last
[1:17:00] messenger
[1:17:00] has come and gone
[1:17:04] is that right amen and we've lived the
[1:17:07] time out
[1:17:09] and we know it's laying in the word that
[1:17:11] that
[1:17:12] that that we which are alive and remain
[1:17:15] will not hinder those that are asleep
[1:17:18] and we can look back and we can see
[1:17:20] nearly seven ages
[1:17:22] of sleeping ones
[1:17:26] and yet we got a word from the apostle
[1:17:29] paul
[1:17:30] like joseph's bones they're not going to
[1:17:32] lay there forever
[1:17:34] but one day they're they're leaving here
[1:17:38] and they're going there to the promised
[1:17:40] land
[1:17:42] are you with me amen and we have went
[1:17:44] through time we have went through
[1:17:46] stages we've went through ages
[1:17:50] and brother brandon said the time of the
[1:17:53] rapture
[1:17:53] is at hand and we're looking for a
[1:17:56] rapture in faith
[1:17:57] that can pull the church together and
[1:17:59] give it some supernatural strength
[1:18:04] that can change their bodies that we
[1:18:06] live in
[1:18:07] when we see a god that can raise the
[1:18:10] dead
[1:18:11] off the floor and out of the yard and
[1:18:13] bring him back to life again
[1:18:15] and present him before us when we see a
[1:18:17] god who can take a cancer that's eat a
[1:18:19] man to his shadow
[1:18:21] and raise him up to a strong healthy man
[1:18:23] that ought to give rapture and faith to
[1:18:25] the people
[1:18:27] amen the things we've been seeing
[1:18:29] happening
[1:18:31] of healings and deliverance even things
[1:18:33] that god has allowed you
[1:18:35] to to overcome and defeat a very
[1:18:38] wicked disease
[1:18:43] and we don't know we'll you know we
[1:18:46] don't know we may have to face it again
[1:18:51] six months later three months later here
[1:18:53] come again
[1:18:55] and hear it come again and hear it come
[1:18:57] again
[1:18:59] we don't know
[1:19:03] amen but we have seen what god's done
[1:19:08] and it's an hour that we should be
[1:19:11] holding a
[1:19:12] clear deed in our hands
[1:19:15] of a token the holy ghost that the debt
[1:19:18] has been paid
[1:19:20] and wave that in the face of satan
[1:19:25] amen and say you can't stay here you've
[1:19:27] got to pass over
[1:19:30] amen it ought to give rapture and faith
[1:19:32] to the people that when the light
[1:19:34] flashes from the sky and the trumpet
[1:19:36] sound
[1:19:37] and the body of christ will be quickly
[1:19:39] gathered together
[1:19:40] and changed in a moment and taken in the
[1:19:43] heavens
[1:19:45] schools of theology says will never
[1:19:48] produce it you've got to meet that light
[1:19:53] and i just want to say all the schools
[1:19:55] of and the halls of message theology and
[1:19:58] training will never produce it either
[1:20:02] you got to meet that light you got to
[1:20:04] find that something
[1:20:06] people talk about in illustrator he said
[1:20:10] you know if you if but the loss of your
[1:20:13] senses
[1:20:14] if you bound them up you know you take a
[1:20:18] bandage and bandage the eyes of children
[1:20:20] the eyes become weak
[1:20:22] they're never used the thought was if
[1:20:25] you bind up those senses
[1:20:27] you know long enough and enough
[1:20:30] generations pass
[1:20:32] you'd have people who were blind born
[1:20:34] blind and unable to see
[1:20:37] and brother branham would say if you
[1:20:39] don't use your senses
[1:20:41] they become dormant they won't act at
[1:20:44] all
[1:20:44] now i'm just going to say irregardless
[1:20:47] if that
[1:20:48] is true of the natural it is sure true
[1:20:50] of the spiritual
[1:20:52] you bind faith you're buying visions
[1:20:56] you're buying tongues and
[1:20:58] interpretations
[1:21:00] you bind prophecies it won't take two
[1:21:03] generations
[1:21:04] and it will become dormant and
[1:21:07] non-existent
[1:21:13] don't hang up on me it's the truth
[1:21:17] and that's what you're seeing that is
[1:21:18] happening around
[1:21:20] the world that they have been bound up
[1:21:24] by men's theology until they're
[1:21:27] almost non-existent
[1:21:31] the church don't know how to use this
[1:21:33] faith
[1:21:34] brother brandon said they placed their
[1:21:36] faith off you know
[1:21:38] that and he called preachers doing it he
[1:21:41] said place
[1:21:42] of faith off in miracles and signs and
[1:21:44] the things that contacts god and gives
[1:21:46] him the holy ghost
[1:21:47] and he plays that off back there
[1:21:49] somewhere or somewhere else
[1:21:51] till the thing has become dead and he
[1:21:53] don't know how to use it
[1:21:56] oh you'll say yeah god's a healer and he
[1:21:58] said
[1:21:59] you know what about that god's a healer
[1:22:01] if he ever was a healer
[1:22:03] he's still a healer if he ever was a
[1:22:06] savior he's still a savior
[1:22:09] if he ever was god he's still god so you
[1:22:12] see
[1:22:12] it's a lack of faith that has been
[1:22:15] preached into the people
[1:22:19] and that makes them let that sixth sense
[1:22:22] which is faith lay dormant
[1:22:24] and he cries out oh god we're supposed
[1:22:27] to be the children of abraham
[1:22:29] what a poor excuse we are oh god wake up
[1:22:33] that sixth sense in this church among
[1:22:36] these people
[1:22:38] faith is what subdued kingdoms faith is
[1:22:41] what wrought righteousness
[1:22:43] faith is what did all kinds of miracles
[1:22:46] and signs down through the ages
[1:22:48] you see wake it up take the bandage off
[1:22:52] and that's what we got to do in this
[1:22:54] hour if there ever was a time we take
[1:22:56] the bandages off
[1:22:58] amen and we open up our eyes and begin
[1:23:01] to look
[1:23:02] and see our god's still god and he still
[1:23:05] got to heal
[1:23:06] he's still god to deliver to awaken that
[1:23:10] faith amen by hearing the word
[1:23:14] there's seven thousand promises that lay
[1:23:18] in this in this bible seven thousand
[1:23:21] promises of divine healing
[1:23:23] awaken that faith by remembering his
[1:23:26] testimonies
[1:23:28] that's why testimonies are so important
[1:23:32] we gotta testify the grace of god
[1:23:35] amen notice brother branham would talk
[1:23:38] about that
[1:23:39] and he said in his own gift he said that
[1:23:42] he said now the gift doesn't heal
[1:23:43] he said what it's trying to do is get
[1:23:45] you in a condition
[1:23:47] to receive him as a healer he said
[1:23:50] something stimulate the faith that's in
[1:23:52] you for being a christian is
[1:23:54] there but it may be laying dormant
[1:23:59] the bible said he has given to every man
[1:24:02] a measure of faith
[1:24:05] but faith ain't any good if we don't use
[1:24:08] that faith
[1:24:08] [Music]
[1:24:10] amen and he said if they will just
[1:24:14] halfway believe they'll get a blessing
[1:24:18] well what would happen if we would fully
[1:24:20] believe
[1:24:22] we'll get a blessing just by halfway
[1:24:23] believing what would we get if we fully
[1:24:25] believe
[1:24:27] i say god tuned the strings of our faith
[1:24:30] i say god awakened that faith within us
[1:24:34] amen it laid in past generations it laid
[1:24:37] in lois
[1:24:38] and laid over here in eunice but it's
[1:24:40] also indeed
[1:24:42] and don't be timid to use it
[1:24:45] it's an hour to use faith like we've
[1:24:48] never used
[1:24:49] faith amen for sons of god to be on
[1:24:52] display
[1:24:53] manifested messiahs
[1:24:59] brother branham would say in revelation
[1:25:01] book of symbols
[1:25:03] god is waiting and trying and pressing
[1:25:05] to get at the mystery of god revealed
[1:25:07] his church that's
[1:25:08] what's holding back the coming of the
[1:25:09] lord now the great millennium
[1:25:11] is a supernatural power that really lays
[1:25:15] dormant in the church
[1:25:20] potentials are there the potentials are
[1:25:24] there
[1:25:27] this is why he would say in the message
[1:25:30] pardon why we ought to be
[1:25:32] a million miles up the road jesus is
[1:25:35] waiting on the church to get ready
[1:25:37] his bride has made herself ready we got
[1:25:39] the potentials
[1:25:40] the holy spirit is here god is here the
[1:25:43] power to heal the sick
[1:25:44] the power to do all things that christ
[1:25:46] did i've seen it demonstrated myself
[1:25:48] by the holy spirit so the potentials are
[1:25:50] here
[1:25:52] but he said what is holding us back what
[1:25:54] god is waiting for us
[1:25:56] is to get away from his our traditions
[1:25:58] and come back under the blood of his
[1:26:00] sons
[1:26:01] jesus christ and become the church
[1:26:05] of the living god how many is ready to
[1:26:07] be the church
[1:26:09] i mean the church that the gates of hell
[1:26:11] will not prevail against it
[1:26:14] amen the church that is an overcoming
[1:26:17] church
[1:26:18] that is his body amen
[1:26:22] oh my the bible said in romans 8 14
[1:26:25] verse many are led by the spirit of god
[1:26:28] they are the sons of god
[1:26:30] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:26:31] bondage again to fear
[1:26:33] but you've received the spirit of
[1:26:34] adoption
[1:26:36] whereby we cry abba father
[1:26:40] the holy spirit is the spirit of
[1:26:42] adoption
[1:26:43] it is the baptism of the spirit of jesus
[1:26:46] that
[1:26:46] makes us recognize that we are the sons
[1:26:50] of god
[1:26:51] and all creation is waiting on us
[1:26:54] to recognize and act in our position
[1:26:58] as we sit with christ with authority and
[1:27:01] power
[1:27:03] now thinking of that brother branham
[1:27:06] would talk about it like
[1:27:09] you know the german natural life
[1:27:12] germantis from father the father the
[1:27:14] father the father and he said
[1:27:16] so in such a way is the life of christ
[1:27:20] he said that's the reason god uses
[1:27:23] the spirit elijah five times it's the
[1:27:26] handing down
[1:27:28] so you would hand it down you know from
[1:27:30] elijah
[1:27:31] to elisha from elisha to john the
[1:27:34] baptist to john the baptist
[1:27:36] to elijah the prophet in this day
[1:27:38] brother branham
[1:27:39] and then right on down to um israel
[1:27:43] and as the final time that the spirit of
[1:27:46] elijah comes
[1:27:48] so he said it's a handing down
[1:27:52] and he said it just as your natural life
[1:27:54] and traits is handed down
[1:27:56] from the natural breeding of your father
[1:27:58] so is the spirit of god
[1:28:00] that was predestinated before the
[1:28:02] foundation of the world
[1:28:03] and when the entire word of god
[1:28:05] incomplete was headed up
[1:28:07] in a human body called jesus christ in
[1:28:10] there
[1:28:10] god made me pay for
[1:28:14] my sins in there
[1:28:18] hallelujah you look at the crucifix up
[1:28:20] there when
[1:28:21] jesus died you were in him
[1:28:25] and there's a handing down of
[1:28:28] righteousness
[1:28:32] amen that comes to everyone that is born
[1:28:35] of him
[1:28:37] amen and he said when he rose he
[1:28:40] raised me up with him in the
[1:28:41] resurrection and now
[1:28:43] we are seated with him with power and
[1:28:47] authority over
[1:28:48] every devil oh if you could only believe
[1:28:51] what god has given
[1:28:52] amen but if you're not seated there you
[1:28:54] don't have it and if you are
[1:28:56] seated there don't believe and afraid to
[1:28:57] move you'll never use it but if you're
[1:28:59] seated there you will use it for your
[1:29:01] ordained to do what you're to do
[1:29:03] a handing down amen
[1:29:08] and if god is present they're
[1:29:12] supernatural
[1:29:15] if it's jehovah god in god's presence
[1:29:18] they're supernatural romans 8 19
[1:29:22] says for the earnest expectation of the
[1:29:26] creature
[1:29:27] waiteth for the display
[1:29:31] the manifestations of the sons of god
[1:29:34] the display of sons the demonstration of
[1:29:38] sons and christ the mystery
[1:29:42] brother branham would would talk about
[1:29:44] this and he said you know today
[1:29:47] he said that in the last days men will
[1:29:49] become
[1:29:50] lovers of pleasures the apostle paul
[1:29:52] said
[1:29:54] truth breakers and false accusers and
[1:29:56] high-minded and
[1:29:57] heady despisers of those that are good
[1:30:00] having a form of godliness
[1:30:02] denying the power thereof and he said of
[1:30:04] this sort
[1:30:05] leads silly women led away with divers
[1:30:08] lust with shorts and bobbed hair
[1:30:10] everything else led away with divers
[1:30:12] lust never able to come to the knowledge
[1:30:14] of the truth
[1:30:15] and these men resisted it as janice and
[1:30:18] jamboree
[1:30:19] wistered moses able to produce a church
[1:30:22] produce a group of people
[1:30:23] but their folly will be made known
[1:30:27] when jesus takes his bride and
[1:30:30] sets her up here and says this is her
[1:30:34] and away he goes with her
[1:30:38] remember their folly has got to come
[1:30:41] know are you with me
[1:30:45] amen and he said what happened when
[1:30:47] jesus takes his bride
[1:30:49] and lifts her up puts her on display
[1:30:52] amen and and sets her up and say
[1:30:56] this is her and the way he goes with her
[1:31:00] i'll tell you what we're here on the
[1:31:02] greatest display
[1:31:04] of sons of god that there ever was
[1:31:10] don't you forget don't you forget
[1:31:14] we're not elijah
[1:31:17] but every time god sends an elijah
[1:31:20] there's an elisa who follows
[1:31:25] come on i'm not talking about another
[1:31:27] man i'm talking about a group of people
[1:31:30] when jesus was here come on the great
[1:31:32] prophet what was it a double portion was
[1:31:35] sent back to the church
[1:31:36] more than this said you do amen we have
[1:31:40] seen the display of god's supernatural
[1:31:42] power
[1:31:43] i'll tell you you ain't seen nothing yet
[1:31:47] am i we're here on the very brink of the
[1:31:51] display of sons of god
[1:31:53] where god will make their folly known
[1:31:56] of all the impersonators all the mockers
[1:32:00] all the scarners all the heavy the
[1:32:02] high-minded
[1:32:04] hallelujah and he'll take a bride up and
[1:32:06] say this is her
[1:32:09] and away he'll go with her
[1:32:22] what does creation why does creation
[1:32:26] have this expectation
[1:32:28] if there's no promise at the last day
[1:32:31] that the sons of god will rise up and
[1:32:32] conquer in the last days
[1:32:36] why is it the bible said
[1:32:40] all creation is under expectation
[1:32:45] the world is all concerned because
[1:32:49] creation is groaning
[1:32:54] it's easy you know they they're looking
[1:32:57] at it and
[1:32:57] the scientists are saying and they're
[1:33:00] counter science and
[1:33:01] and again you know you don't know
[1:33:02] whether you're putting pancakes on the
[1:33:04] roof
[1:33:07] because you know everybody's got their
[1:33:09] idea
[1:33:10] and everything else is as the minerals
[1:33:13] are
[1:33:14] depleted from the earth and dug out of
[1:33:16] it and the oil and the
[1:33:17] and the fumes and the gases and the
[1:33:19] dying and the
[1:33:20] the world that we're living in nature
[1:33:24] is groaning
[1:33:27] and the very reason they're travailing
[1:33:30] is they're
[1:33:31] crying for sons of god
[1:33:35] you know these tree huggers think that
[1:33:38] the earth is crying for them to save it
[1:33:41] they can't save it
[1:33:45] are you with me i'll go on all of this
[1:33:48] stuff
[1:33:48] and his ideas and what he can't save it
[1:33:52] all the money that would jump into it
[1:33:54] can't save it
[1:33:56] the world is groaning not for fallen
[1:34:00] sons
[1:34:00] but for adopted sons to bring a
[1:34:03] millennium back upon the earth again
[1:34:07] are you with me and let me tell you
[1:34:09] there is coming a renewed earth
[1:34:14] and all that you're hearing about the
[1:34:16] groaning of the earth
[1:34:18] and they cannot answer to the groaning
[1:34:21] but you can
[1:34:25] and the change will not start with the
[1:34:28] earth
[1:34:29] those chains will start with you the
[1:34:32] king of the earth
[1:34:38] when man fell the earth fell with him
[1:34:43] so the only way for the earth to rise
[1:34:46] again
[1:34:47] is for the king to come back into his
[1:34:50] place
[1:34:55] and we're right on the brink of it
[1:35:00] let me tell you something there is
[1:35:01] future for this earth
[1:35:06] there may not be future for cosmos the
[1:35:08] world
[1:35:09] but there is future for this earth satan
[1:35:12] cannot destroy it
[1:35:16] he can contaminate it but he can't
[1:35:18] destroy it
[1:35:20] amen we're we're going to have a
[1:35:22] thousand years of eden upon the earth
[1:35:25] and after that a new heavens and a new
[1:35:27] earth
[1:35:28] and it won't be a new heavens or a new
[1:35:31] earth in the sense of
[1:35:32] uh a brand new one something that didn't
[1:35:35] exist before
[1:35:36] but it'd be the same one turned inside
[1:35:38] out and
[1:35:39] sin eradicated and unbelievable all the
[1:35:42] scars of it
[1:35:44] taken away until the whole heavens will
[1:35:46] catch on
[1:35:47] with the fervent heat but the earth will
[1:35:50] have bone and on and on and on
[1:35:53] because she's in the thoughts of god as
[1:35:56] you are in the thoughts of god and look
[1:36:00] at this body that you're laying in
[1:36:02] and living in of earth let me tell you
[1:36:05] it may
[1:36:05] look like it's grown in it may look like
[1:36:08] it's decaying
[1:36:09] but satan can never destroy it
[1:36:13] hallelujah even if it goes down in the
[1:36:16] ground it will rise again
[1:36:18] he can plug it with sickness but it'll
[1:36:20] be healed again
[1:36:21] and we're here on the brink of the
[1:36:23] greatest healing campaign that there's
[1:36:25] ever been
[1:36:26] will we be changed from mortal to
[1:36:29] immortality
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:36] first john 3 and 1 behold what manner of
[1:36:39] love
[1:36:40] the father hath bestowed upon us
[1:36:43] oh my what love he's bestowed upon us
[1:36:47] oh my that we should be called the sons
[1:36:50] of god
[1:36:52] therefore the world knows us not because
[1:36:54] it knew him not
[1:36:56] beloved now we are the sons of god
[1:36:59] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:37:01] be what we know that
[1:37:03] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:37:06] him
[1:37:07] for we shall see him as he is
[1:37:12] turn with me also to ephesians chapter 1
[1:37:14] and verse 17.
[1:37:16] let's just look at this together now
[1:37:19] ephesians 1
[1:37:23] that the lord that the god of our lord
[1:37:25] jesus christ
[1:37:27] the father of glory may give you the
[1:37:29] spirit of wisdom
[1:37:31] and revelation and the knowledge of him
[1:37:35] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:37:37] enlightened
[1:37:39] that you may know what is the hope of
[1:37:41] his calling and what is the riches of
[1:37:42] the glory of his inheritance in the
[1:37:44] saints
[1:37:45] and what is exceeding greatness of his
[1:37:48] power to us word who believed
[1:37:50] according to the working of his mighty
[1:37:52] power which he wrought in christ
[1:37:55] when he raised him from the dead and set
[1:37:57] him at his own right hand in heavenly
[1:37:59] places
[1:38:00] far above all principalities and power
[1:38:04] and might and dominion and every name
[1:38:06] that is named
[1:38:08] not only in this world but also in that
[1:38:10] which is to come
[1:38:12] and have put all things
[1:38:18] hallelujah under his feet
[1:38:22] amen far above all principality
[1:38:25] and power and might and dominion
[1:38:29] and every name that is named
[1:38:33] not only in this world but the world to
[1:38:35] come
[1:38:36] amen what is it and it put all things
[1:38:39] under
[1:38:39] his feet and gave him to be
[1:38:42] head over all things to the church
[1:38:46] which is his body the fullness of him
[1:38:48] that filleth
[1:38:49] all in all so again
[1:38:52] what did he say he put the christ
[1:38:56] and his body which is the church
[1:39:01] and he triumphed over everything
[1:39:05] put it under your feet if it's under his
[1:39:08] feet
[1:39:09] come on somebody it's under your feet
[1:39:12] i might put all things under seed and
[1:39:14] gave him to be the head of the church
[1:39:16] which is his body the fullness of him
[1:39:19] that filleth all in all the church
[1:39:21] is christ's body in which he speaks and
[1:39:24] acts
[1:39:25] and by which he feels everything with
[1:39:28] his presence
[1:39:30] this is where he acts this is where he's
[1:39:32] going to move
[1:39:34] amen let me tell you you're looking for
[1:39:37] the second coming of christ and the
[1:39:38] meeting in the air
[1:39:39] he'll not even come to the earth
[1:39:43] we meet him in the air he'll not even
[1:39:45] come to the earth
[1:39:46] so everything god's going to do on the
[1:39:48] earth right now he's going to do it in
[1:39:50] his body the bride
[1:39:52] amen wherever his church goes there is
[1:39:55] his presence
[1:39:56] for he's acting and speaking in her are
[1:39:58] you with me
[1:39:59] amen when she can overcome her creeds
[1:40:02] brother branham said
[1:40:03] and the world that's drawn her in there
[1:40:06] she'll come back to be in the bride of
[1:40:07] jesus christ
[1:40:08] miseries jesus christ come to realize
[1:40:12] who we are we are miss each jesus christ
[1:40:15] we're miss jesus christ
[1:40:18] brother branham would say mr jesus and
[1:40:20] miss jesus
[1:40:21] he says elijah and elisha
[1:40:26] hallelujah i'm telling you there's an
[1:40:28] elijah people here upon the earth
[1:40:33] amen that god will do a double portion
[1:40:38] people worried about us impersonating
[1:40:40] brother branham forget about personally
[1:40:43] impersonating brother branham you know
[1:40:45] we are the we are the elisha
[1:40:47] to the light of jesus christ
[1:40:50] received a double portion of his spirit
[1:40:54] amen as he poured out himself in the
[1:40:57] message of token he said it has to be
[1:41:00] because a woman and her husband become
[1:41:02] one they become one
[1:41:03] and so does the bride and christ become
[1:41:06] one
[1:41:06] the ministry of the bride and the
[1:41:09] ministry of
[1:41:10] christ is the same
[1:41:14] that was so good i'm going to repeat it
[1:41:16] amen the ministry of the bride
[1:41:19] and the ministry of christ is the same
[1:41:23] and remember these former treaties of
[1:41:25] the theophilus
[1:41:27] have i wrote into you that jesus began
[1:41:29] to do and continues to do
[1:41:30] his death didn't stop him no sir he
[1:41:33] returned again not a third person but
[1:41:35] the same person
[1:41:37] returned in the form of the holy ghost
[1:41:40] and to continue the work on
[1:41:43] and continues on said the book of acts
[1:41:46] jesus christ the same
[1:41:47] yesterday today and forever that's the
[1:41:50] token
[1:41:50] that's the sign
[1:41:54] now so you see that's why that's why we
[1:41:57] need
[1:41:58] to be in that place of revival
[1:42:01] where that our faith is tuned and awaken
[1:42:04] our faith again
[1:42:05] to the reality of god and why god has
[1:42:08] called you in this day
[1:42:11] amen he hadn't just called us to sit out
[1:42:14] here
[1:42:15] on the highway now and display us out
[1:42:17] here and where we were once in the back
[1:42:19] woods and
[1:42:20] way back out in claiborne parish and and
[1:42:23] some little donald trump roads
[1:42:25] you know and now put us out here where
[1:42:27] everybody can see us that's not the
[1:42:29] display god wants
[1:42:31] god wants a pride a people who is called
[1:42:34] by his name
[1:42:36] who does the works of jesus christ amen
[1:42:39] that they are anointed messiahs
[1:42:42] amen he's the great light they are
[1:42:44] little lights
[1:42:46] amen they are anointed ones christ means
[1:42:49] the anointed one
[1:42:51] and if a church is anointed by the
[1:42:53] messiah spirit
[1:42:54] it becomes a lesser but still a messiah
[1:42:57] amen because it's his light reflecting
[1:43:00] his power
[1:43:02] people wonder well where is the pillar
[1:43:04] of fire
[1:43:05] well where do you think it's supposed to
[1:43:08] be
[1:43:11] some people can only find it at the
[1:43:13] grave of brother branham
[1:43:19] that's the only place they've ever seen
[1:43:22] it
[1:43:24] hello hey man i i you know i
[1:43:28] i you know the the the holy spirit is
[1:43:31] everywhere
[1:43:33] perhaps he passes by there sometimes i
[1:43:35] don't know
[1:43:38] but that's no vindication
[1:43:41] the pillar of fire is not with the tomb
[1:43:45] the pillar of fire is with the people
[1:43:49] are you with me and the angel of the
[1:43:51] covenant brother branham said
[1:43:52] that pillar of fire he said if i die
[1:43:55] this very night
[1:43:55] now that pillar of fire has nothing to
[1:43:58] do with me
[1:43:59] i'm just a man that pillar fire is in
[1:44:02] the church
[1:44:04] not only with me it's in every one of
[1:44:06] you it's in all of us
[1:44:10] hallelujah amen this is where he said he
[1:44:13] was baptized with the holy ghost and
[1:44:15] fire
[1:44:16] every person in the upper room received
[1:44:19] a tongue of
[1:44:20] fire a portion of that pillar of fire
[1:44:24] you say well where is the pillow fire
[1:44:26] it's in the church
[1:44:28] not in the building in the church it is
[1:44:32] people
[1:44:34] amen in the paradox brother branham said
[1:44:38] again this pillar of fire is identified
[1:44:41] scientifically
[1:44:42] by reaction by its character everything
[1:44:45] else is the same
[1:44:46] as it was when it was dwelling in the
[1:44:48] body of god's only begotten son
[1:44:51] so does it dwell in the body of his
[1:44:54] adopted sons for the last day
[1:44:59] hallelujah the pillar of fire dwells
[1:45:04] it lives in the adopted sons
[1:45:08] for the last days now you want to know
[1:45:12] where the pillar of fire is
[1:45:14] it's in every holy ghost-filled person
[1:45:18] amen amen it's the son of man being
[1:45:22] revealed in the bride body
[1:45:24] amen again go away jesus brother branham
[1:45:27] said
[1:45:28] you know i believe his earthly ministry
[1:45:31] has never ceased
[1:45:34] because he's in his people now
[1:45:38] so think about that the earthly ministry
[1:45:40] of jesus still goes on
[1:45:44] it's in its people this is why i would
[1:45:47] say
[1:45:48] it is it is under your feet every
[1:45:51] principality every power
[1:45:53] every spirit is under your feet
[1:45:57] amen because it's under his feet and his
[1:46:00] earthly
[1:46:00] ministry has never ceased because he's
[1:46:04] in his people now
[1:46:08] the hebrew book he would say it this way
[1:46:11] he said now god has always been on the
[1:46:13] earth
[1:46:16] god has never left the earth
[1:46:23] if he'd ever leave the earth i don't
[1:46:25] know what would become of it but god's
[1:46:27] always been here in some form
[1:46:29] oh praise his name in case you're
[1:46:32] wondering
[1:46:33] even after the bride leaves god will
[1:46:35] still be here
[1:46:38] amen filling and sealing 144 000 with
[1:46:41] the holy spirit
[1:46:42] anointing in you and and using elijah
[1:46:45] and moses
[1:46:48] come on amen leading them as he's seen
[1:46:51] in revelation
[1:46:52] 14 15 16 there uh
[1:46:56] that group there that 144 thousand
[1:47:00] up up on to mount zion
[1:47:03] all of that he's shown there even god
[1:47:07] will never leave the earth
[1:47:10] brother branham said when he when he was
[1:47:12] preaching campaigns
[1:47:13] he said now when i leave here the holy
[1:47:16] spirit will not leave
[1:47:22] amen somehow another you know people's
[1:47:25] faith
[1:47:25] wound up dying with the prophet again
[1:47:29] it's not in a tomb
[1:47:31] amen it's not in a tomb our faith is not
[1:47:35] to die with the prophet of god
[1:47:37] amen it's a handing down if it was in
[1:47:40] the prophet
[1:47:41] god there's a handing down of the spirit
[1:47:44] of god
[1:47:44] the same spirit that was upon elijah
[1:47:47] rest upon elijah
[1:47:55] he said he was with the children in the
[1:47:56] wilderness
[1:47:58] coming out of egypt in the form of a
[1:48:00] light
[1:48:01] he spoke to abraham in the form of a man
[1:48:05] he spoke to moses in the form of a man
[1:48:08] he spoke to the church in the form of a
[1:48:10] man
[1:48:11] his son christ jesus and he's speaking
[1:48:15] through his church today
[1:48:17] through the anointed church of the
[1:48:19] living god through vessels of clay
[1:48:22] you are the branches i am the vine and
[1:48:24] god is still speaking
[1:48:25] and the world sees jesus as you present
[1:48:28] him
[1:48:30] that's how the world is you are written
[1:48:32] epistles read of all men
[1:48:34] your life tells you what you are
[1:48:37] god has been building he's been building
[1:48:40] the church
[1:48:41] through the years until we come up
[1:48:44] even brother branham said it would come
[1:48:46] up like a pyramid not a pyramid but like
[1:48:49] one coming up narrow narrow as it comes
[1:48:52] and
[1:48:52] and to receive a capstone and
[1:48:56] and and he says there to meet the
[1:48:58] capstone
[1:48:59] there has to be a ministry
[1:49:03] that's exactly like him so that the two
[1:49:07] will unite together
[1:49:11] but that's why again there has to be
[1:49:13] manifested messiahs in the last day
[1:49:16] because there has to be a ministry that
[1:49:19] matches him
[1:49:24] it's the messiah the anointed one
[1:49:27] that anointing that we that we referred
[1:49:30] to that must come down
[1:49:31] that had to come down to malachi 4 an
[1:49:34] anointing coming down
[1:49:36] to bring back the faith this is why he
[1:49:39] would tell us
[1:49:40] in christ or the mighty god and veil
[1:49:44] he said that you know god was in christ
[1:49:47] god in a man the fullness of godhead
[1:49:49] bodily in a man god and a man now is god
[1:49:52] in men
[1:49:54] the fullness of the god hit bodily in
[1:49:57] his entire church
[1:49:58] manifesting himself fulfilling his word
[1:50:01] the fullness of the godhead
[1:50:03] bodily now
[1:50:07] in the ages past we had luther that had
[1:50:09] a portion
[1:50:11] we had wesley with a portion with azusa
[1:50:14] street with a greater portion
[1:50:16] but this is not a day of portions
[1:50:20] this is the day are you with me where
[1:50:22] the fullness of the godhead
[1:50:24] bodily is in a people
[1:50:32] now he's not here just as a portion of
[1:50:36] his spirit
[1:50:37] he's not here just as a dead hopeless
[1:50:40] theology
[1:50:42] he's here in his fullness
[1:50:45] amount brother branham would talk about
[1:50:48] that and he said
[1:50:49] he would first reveal itself in christ
[1:50:53] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[1:50:56] then to bring that fullness of the
[1:50:57] godhead body
[1:50:59] into a people
[1:51:02] this is god's plan it's the handing down
[1:51:07] this is why i would say god expressed in
[1:51:10] jesus christ
[1:51:11] who was both father son and holy ghost
[1:51:13] the fullness of the godhead
[1:51:15] bodily but now the complete fullness of
[1:51:18] the
[1:51:19] godhead bodily dwells in his church the
[1:51:22] preeminence
[1:51:23] and that all that god was he poured into
[1:51:25] christ and all that christ was
[1:51:27] was poured in the church the believers
[1:51:31] amen it was the anointed man
[1:51:34] but now it's the anointed people
[1:51:38] amen the anointed with the fullness of
[1:51:40] the godhead body
[1:51:41] how can we doubt it it's been promised
[1:51:44] for this
[1:51:45] hour you know when we can look back at
[1:51:46] jesus and moses fortunately
[1:51:49] partially had him and david had him and
[1:51:52] parsons you know had him partially
[1:51:54] and solomon and the songs of david all
[1:51:56] of them had him
[1:51:57] in portion but when jesus came he was
[1:52:00] all of that
[1:52:02] in one body hallelujah
[1:52:05] amen here we are in the last days you
[1:52:08] know
[1:52:08] he did that remember he did that the
[1:52:11] purpose
[1:52:12] of him doing that was that he could give
[1:52:14] his life on calvary
[1:52:17] and to bring that same fullness
[1:52:20] back into the church again about where
[1:52:23] that
[1:52:24] luther had him in portion wesley had him
[1:52:27] in portion and
[1:52:28] others had him in portion now the
[1:52:30] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:52:32] have been poured out into a people
[1:52:35] for the last day for messiahs to be on
[1:52:38] display
[1:52:41] are we at the time brother branham said
[1:52:46] in there there would come a time
[1:52:50] and i want to deal with this just for a
[1:52:51] minute
[1:52:53] there would come a time
[1:52:58] he could express himself in the fullness
[1:53:01] of his godhead deity through his church
[1:53:05] have the preeminence in this church
[1:53:09] what oh my the anointed man now the
[1:53:11] anointed people almighty bring back what
[1:53:13] the anointed bride and bridegroom
[1:53:15] anointed by what accepting what he
[1:53:19] turned down and adam coming back with
[1:53:22] the anointing of the word because he
[1:53:24] said my word is spirit
[1:53:25] and the anointed with the word what he
[1:53:28] turned down he comes back
[1:53:32] and we accept
[1:53:41] now brother branham said there would be
[1:53:43] a time
[1:53:44] come forth i think
[1:53:48] brother branham when he would look at
[1:53:49] the seven thunder is going to be
[1:53:51] revealed
[1:53:51] and he said sirs is this the time
[1:53:57] and i'm looking at this right here at
[1:53:59] the moment when a prophet would say
[1:54:01] there would be a time come forth
[1:54:05] when he could express himself in the
[1:54:07] fullness of his
[1:54:08] godhead oh god
[1:54:12] think these message preachers say you
[1:54:14] can't express him in the fullness of his
[1:54:16] godhead
[1:54:17] and deny the holy ghost deny
[1:54:20] the power of god deny divine healing
[1:54:25] just turn it into a cold hopeless
[1:54:27] theology you can't do it
[1:54:29] there is a time that has come forth word
[1:54:32] that he would express himself
[1:54:34] in the fullness of his godhead i say
[1:54:37] sirs is this the time
[1:54:40] is this the hour well if we're not
[1:54:44] who is
[1:54:50] if it's not the hour when is it
[1:54:54] if it's not the age when will it come
[1:54:59] somebody help me we're out of ages
[1:55:02] we're out of messages we're out of
[1:55:04] prophets
[1:55:06] i'm talking about messenger church ain't
[1:55:08] messengers
[1:55:09] we're out we we've reached the end and
[1:55:11] we there hasn't come a time for that he
[1:55:14] can express
[1:55:14] himself in the fullness
[1:55:18] of his godhead bodily deity through his
[1:55:20] church
[1:55:22] had the preeminence
[1:55:25] oh my i'm in the middle of something
[1:55:27] right here
[1:55:28] oh god help me today the anointed man
[1:55:32] now the anointed people
[1:55:36] to bring back the anointed pride and
[1:55:38] bridegroom
[1:55:40] anointed by what accepting what he
[1:55:43] turned down
[1:55:45] did that go over your head what did he
[1:55:48] turn down
[1:55:49] she turned down the opportunity to bring
[1:55:52] forth a spoken word
[1:55:53] child to become
[1:55:56] impregnated by the word
[1:55:59] she chose labor and child baron
[1:56:03] and sorrow
[1:56:06] come on instead read the bible
[1:56:10] you know what happened through the
[1:56:12] choice that she made
[1:56:14] when she turned down the opportunity
[1:56:19] amen yes yes she had she
[1:56:23] she had she was made out of the soil
[1:56:27] yes she was made of the dust of the
[1:56:29] earth
[1:56:30] yes she but she was the highest of all
[1:56:33] of the cattle in the field the fowl of
[1:56:36] the air
[1:56:37] she had dominion and she was more
[1:56:41] she was more than dust
[1:56:44] she had a soul and that soul was in the
[1:56:47] presence of god
[1:56:49] and then could bring heaven down on the
[1:56:51] earth and a millennial condition was
[1:56:54] there
[1:56:54] on the earth
[1:56:58] the lion laid down by the lamb nothing
[1:57:01] heard or destroyed in all my holy
[1:57:03] mountain
[1:57:05] amen what eve turned down
[1:57:08] what did she turn down she
[1:57:12] turned down the opportunity to have
[1:57:15] a spoken word child
[1:57:19] a child of the word come on
[1:57:23] amen she turned it down and the end
[1:57:26] and because of that it entered into
[1:57:28] sorrow
[1:57:30] trouble death affliction
[1:57:35] and everyone that was been bored of that
[1:57:38] way has been born in that condition
[1:57:42] amen what did he turn down she object
[1:57:45] she turned down the opportunity to bring
[1:57:47] forth a spoken
[1:57:49] word child a child of the word
[1:57:53] and if we're not careful that's exactly
[1:57:55] what the second eve will do
[1:57:57] again in this last day i mean she don't
[1:58:00] want any of them screaming hollering
[1:58:02] acts 2 38 blabbering screaming miserable
[1:58:04] creatures she thinks they are
[1:58:06] come on a man he would ruin her
[1:58:09] and her educated ethical scientific
[1:58:12] society
[1:58:13] church that she belonged to it would
[1:58:15] throw her out at the next council she
[1:58:17] can't have it she don't want to be
[1:58:18] pregnant with the word
[1:58:20] because that's the only kind
[1:58:23] that the word can bring forth
[1:58:28] amen invisible union
[1:58:32] he would say this way again and at the
[1:58:35] end time both trees are coming to seed
[1:58:37] and proving themselves
[1:58:39] we're right here today laodicea and the
[1:58:42] bride just clear and pretty as it could
[1:58:43] be
[1:58:44] in the scripture right before your faces
[1:58:47] you can't serve god and mammon you can't
[1:58:49] be a virtuous believing christian and
[1:58:51] associate self
[1:58:52] in a denominational affair and i'll tell
[1:58:55] you church
[1:58:55] when you just have this easy believer
[1:58:58] when you have justice
[1:58:59] coming to the altar accepting christ and
[1:59:01] and that's
[1:59:02] it and never really getting changed
[1:59:05] are you with me it's a denominational
[1:59:08] affair
[1:59:11] amen and he says you can't do it at the
[1:59:14] same time one's got to be dead
[1:59:16] let the other live neither can you bear
[1:59:18] god's word son
[1:59:20] neither can the church bring forth they
[1:59:21] don't want one of them of screaming
[1:59:23] shouting speaking in tongues and all
[1:59:24] them things you can't do that
[1:59:26] in a denominational church can't do it
[1:59:29] in message churches because they're
[1:59:30] denominations
[1:59:32] they won't have you they don't want to
[1:59:34] bring them like that
[1:59:35] they will they take them up and shake
[1:59:37] their hands that if you believe it you
[1:59:39] got it
[1:59:40] as long as you put your name on the book
[1:59:41] that's all you have to do see it's
[1:59:43] illegitimate
[1:59:44] children to the word and still claim to
[1:59:46] be religious
[1:59:48] amen you see
[1:59:52] jesus would say if i don't do
[1:59:55] the works that is written to me don't
[1:59:58] believe me
[2:00:01] but if i'm doing the works that's
[2:00:02] written of me then believe what i'm
[2:00:04] telling you is the truth
[2:00:07] that's why there always must be signs
[2:00:10] following them that believe
[2:00:12] because we must do what is written of us
[2:00:16] it is written as us we shall lay hands
[2:00:19] on the sick
[2:00:21] and they shall recover come on
[2:00:24] it is written of us jesus would say who
[2:00:26] can condemn me of sin
[2:00:28] you tell me one word the father said to
[2:00:30] me that i hadn't done that
[2:00:33] you can't if you can if i hadn't
[2:00:35] fulfilled all the word that's written to
[2:00:36] me then you can point your finger at me
[2:00:38] but i've done exactly what the scripture
[2:00:40] said i would do
[2:00:42] said oh if the church would take that
[2:00:44] stand
[2:00:45] tonight as a representative of jesus
[2:00:48] christ
[2:00:49] where are we short
[2:00:53] amen god i want to live to see the day
[2:00:55] that the church of jesus christ can be
[2:00:58] one in purpose
[2:00:59] and heart and body standing in the full
[2:01:02] anointed power of the holy spirit
[2:01:05] to perform and work like jesus did with
[2:01:08] god in them too
[2:01:11] amen now there are there again
[2:01:15] who can condemn me a sin who can condemn
[2:01:17] me who can say i disbelieve the word
[2:01:22] well when you've got a church and
[2:01:23] there's no signs and wonders among them
[2:01:25] they're disbelievers of the word
[2:01:29] amen when all the births are stillborn
[2:01:32] babies
[2:01:32] they are disbelievers of the word but
[2:01:35] when you have believers in the word
[2:01:38] true belief come on who can condemn us a
[2:01:41] sin
[2:01:43] amen god still heals cancer
[2:01:46] yeah god still heals heals brain bleeds
[2:01:50] yeah god still heals alopecia yeah
[2:01:53] god still heals crippled children yeah
[2:01:56] god still is a deliverer
[2:01:59] he's the same in principle amen who can
[2:02:03] condemn me of sin
[2:02:05] show me where what the father said we
[2:02:07] would do that we're not doing
[2:02:10] that's where the church has to stand
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:16] because in this day we can't just claim
[2:02:19] to be messiahs
[2:02:21] we must be messiahs on display
[2:02:26] a bride that he will say this is her and
[2:02:29] the way he lifts her up and the way he
[2:02:30] goes with him
[2:02:36] let me find a stopping place
[2:02:39] but i want you to look at your life
[2:02:42] and see if he's doing the works that he
[2:02:45] promised
[2:02:46] he would do
[2:02:49] the works of christ of course is not
[2:02:51] just miracles and healings
[2:02:55] amen what about the what about the
[2:02:57] miracle of truth-telling
[2:03:00] if you're still lying he's not there
[2:03:04] amen what about the miracle of keeping
[2:03:06] your tongue
[2:03:09] i mean that's a miracle you know if
[2:03:12] you're still cheating and stealing he's
[2:03:14] not there
[2:03:16] if you're still in porn jesus not in
[2:03:18] your ship
[2:03:19] you went off without him hey man you
[2:03:23] might
[2:03:23] you might have met him down at the altar
[2:03:25] and talked to him a little bit you
[2:03:26] didn't take him with you
[2:03:29] hey man what about the miracle of never
[2:03:31] drinking or smoking or doping again
[2:03:34] i mean i you know i you know we we
[2:03:38] again we have those trying to destroy
[2:03:41] the faith and it's not being preached
[2:03:46] i know we got preachers that tell you
[2:03:49] yeah you know you're you're bright
[2:03:51] and you you just grow out of it but
[2:03:53] these
[2:03:54] you just grow out of these sins they're
[2:03:56] lying to you
[2:03:58] i mean they're folks representation of
[2:04:01] the message
[2:04:03] amen all you don't have to listen but a
[2:04:05] few tapes and
[2:04:06] you'll know that that teaching that kind
[2:04:08] of teaching's an absolute
[2:04:10] lie amen it's no different what's taught
[2:04:13] in the denomination somewhere
[2:04:15] it denies the power of the gospel that
[2:04:18] will enable you to live and overcome in
[2:04:20] life
[2:04:22] let me tell you this gospel works
[2:04:26] it ain't just a charismatic religion
[2:04:29] you know of a tongue or a prophecy if
[2:04:31] something comes to pass once in a while
[2:04:33] or healing or a miracle it's more than
[2:04:36] that
[2:04:38] it's a life that is changed
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:45] you know let me just help you here a
[2:04:47] little bit if you're always struggling
[2:04:50] to live a christian life to overcome
[2:04:52] dope and alcohol
[2:04:53] and all these other you you need jesus
[2:05:00] you don't have him you're not born again
[2:05:05] amount and just let me just tell you a
[2:05:08] shocker
[2:05:10] you're not bright
[2:05:17] i don't whip some people's head off and
[2:05:20] spin them around
[2:05:24] but some of people need a head spun
[2:05:26] around
[2:05:30] i saw an old silence film of laurel and
[2:05:33] hardy years ago a silent film
[2:05:36] was on 16 millimeters how far back it
[2:05:39] was
[2:05:40] they went into some ritzy place and one
[2:05:42] of them knocked over a statue
[2:05:45] and you know it scared them because they
[2:05:47] were
[2:05:48] supposed to be moving a piano and it was
[2:05:50] expensive place and they had never seen
[2:05:52] and they were all
[2:05:52] goggle eyed and they looked over this
[2:05:54] statue and
[2:05:56] touched it and it fell over and the head
[2:05:58] fell off and
[2:06:00] so the guy grabbed it and he puts it
[2:06:02] back on but he sets it on backwards
[2:06:07] the other guy he's coming along behind
[2:06:09] him some
[2:06:10] steps later from one room to the other
[2:06:13] and they're looking at this
[2:06:14] marvelous place and so ritzy and
[2:06:17] everything else
[2:06:18] and he sees that statue there with his
[2:06:20] head on backwards and he goes
[2:06:29] and that's what i want to do sometimes
[2:06:32] when i look around and i see these that
[2:06:34] have got their heads on backwards
[2:06:38] turn it around
[2:06:44] people might have got used to it ahead
[2:06:46] on backwards but i ain't used to it
[2:06:50] amen i know i know this you're not bride
[2:06:53] let me tell you why you're not bright
[2:06:55] because you can only become
[2:06:56] bride by being united and married to him
[2:07:02] and you cannot be united christ and
[2:07:04] still be
[2:07:05] do be doing cocaine or drinking a beer
[2:07:08] or two
[2:07:11] dabbling in this or that come on you
[2:07:14] cannot be the bride of christ and be
[2:07:16] doing that you're not
[2:07:17] married to him you've got another
[2:07:20] husband
[2:07:23] you might claim to be bride and i would
[2:07:25] say potentially i hope you are
[2:07:28] with all my heart i like to believe you
[2:07:31] are
[2:07:31] but i don't see any evidence yet
[2:07:35] the evidence is a changed life
[2:07:40] where you hate sin
[2:07:44] well i hate it but i can't help but do
[2:07:46] it no you don't hate it
[2:07:48] you still love it it's still your love
[2:07:50] life
[2:07:52] although you might claim to hate the way
[2:07:55] you are
[2:07:56] and maybe even say i hate that i hate
[2:07:59] that cocaine i hate that alcohol i hate
[2:08:01] that
[2:08:02] tobacco i hate that those drugs i hate
[2:08:04] that
[2:08:05] you know that porno but the truth of it
[2:08:08] is you still love it
[2:08:10] you're still at slate it's still your
[2:08:14] master
[2:08:15] and you might protest but i love jesus
[2:08:17] perhaps so
[2:08:19] but you love sin more
[2:08:22] it's still your master you can't serve
[2:08:25] two masters you'll love one and hate the
[2:08:27] other
[2:08:29] come on of course you would never say
[2:08:32] you hate jesus
[2:08:34] but you just let him left
[2:08:37] and here's the truth of matter you don't
[2:08:39] know jesus
[2:08:41] you might know of his word but you don't
[2:08:43] know him
[2:08:44] you might know of some of his truths but
[2:08:47] you don't know jesus
[2:08:48] to know jesus is to know of his power
[2:08:52] to save and deliver
[2:08:57] amen now i'm not saying there's no hope
[2:08:59] for you
[2:09:01] i'm telling you that your only hope is
[2:09:03] jesus
[2:09:05] amen you'll never find jesus by digging
[2:09:07] until you find some preacher that'll
[2:09:09] comfort you
[2:09:10] amen by telling you your bride and that
[2:09:13] god will never lose you
[2:09:15] that you're predestinated and you'll be
[2:09:17] okay the truth is you're not
[2:09:19] bright and you're not okay and you're
[2:09:22] lost
[2:09:23] and the only way for you to come bride
[2:09:26] is to die
[2:09:27] is sin what sin nature is dead and
[2:09:30] you're born again a new creation
[2:09:32] a brand new species and that's who i'm
[2:09:35] talking about the bride of christ
[2:09:36] she's a brand new species she's born
[2:09:39] again
[2:09:41] that's why she can believe so well where
[2:09:46] will i find jesus
[2:09:48] well well i find him at the altar maybe
[2:09:50] maybe not
[2:09:52] well i find him at my pew maybe maybe
[2:09:54] not
[2:09:56] will i find him there when i'm driving
[2:09:58] down the car one day maybe maybe not
[2:10:01] or where you're going to find jesus
[2:10:04] when you get rid of your stinking pride
[2:10:09] and you realize i must get to jesus
[2:10:13] when you realize you're a dying man and
[2:10:15] you're grasping for straws and these
[2:10:17] trials
[2:10:18] come from false preachers and they ain't
[2:10:21] saving me
[2:10:23] finding jesus comes only to repentance
[2:10:26] by turning from sin
[2:10:27] and being born again and your old man is
[2:10:29] dead
[2:10:32] sorry until that happens you're not
[2:10:33] bright
[2:10:36] but you can be but you got to let go of
[2:10:39] the other lovers first
[2:10:47] i'm predestinated you don't know that
[2:10:49] until you get the holy ghost
[2:10:52] the bible said you're predestinated to
[2:10:55] adoption
[2:10:59] is that right amen and so you see when
[2:11:03] you get the holy ghost and you know
[2:11:05] i always was his
[2:11:09] when you get the holy spirit you can
[2:11:11] look back and say i never really belong
[2:11:13] to the devil
[2:11:15] he has no claim on me i'm blood washed
[2:11:20] i'm not just blood washed and my sins is
[2:11:23] gone they're annihilated
[2:11:25] and they're not just annihilated they've
[2:11:27] been changed by the chemistry of the
[2:11:29] blood
[2:11:30] until it lays on the head of the accuser
[2:11:34] and the one who accused me is going to
[2:11:37] hell
[2:11:38] not me hell was created for the devil
[2:11:43] and his angels
[2:11:44] it was never created for one son of god
[2:11:47] and i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of
[2:11:50] god
[2:11:55] it's a positive token it's not a hopes
[2:11:58] of religion
[2:12:00] the bible said to he that's born of god
[2:12:02] does not commit sin for he
[2:12:04] cannot sin for the seed of god remains
[2:12:06] in him
[2:12:07] and how can he sin when a sinless god is
[2:12:09] in him when he's
[2:12:10] when a sinless god he's in a sinless god
[2:12:13] how can he sin
[2:12:15] no matter what he's done the blood's
[2:12:16] covered him he is a new creature now his
[2:12:19] desires and ambitions
[2:12:21] is in heaven that's what you want to
[2:12:22] find out where are your desires
[2:12:27] amen worries what is your ambitions
[2:12:30] amen what is your heart set upon amen
[2:12:33] his
[2:12:34] desires and ambition is heaven because
[2:12:36] he's chained
[2:12:37] from a cup of bird to a wheat his
[2:12:39] desires aren't the same as it once was
[2:12:41] and he displays it
[2:12:45] you say well i believe that and you're
[2:12:47] still sinning
[2:12:48] now you're deceived it can't display
[2:12:50] nothing but the token
[2:12:56] oh yeah
[2:12:59] well i'll tell you what brother tim this
[2:13:01] body is mine
[2:13:03] and i can i can do what i want to with
[2:13:06] it
[2:13:08] i want you to remember he also created
[2:13:10] your body
[2:13:16] and our bodies will have to obey him
[2:13:20] you surrender your thoughts to him
[2:13:22] surrender your life or into your faith
[2:13:24] you watch his body your body start doing
[2:13:26] what he says
[2:13:28] automatically if you're a drunkard you
[2:13:31] can't quit drinking
[2:13:32] surrender that life to him you won't
[2:13:35] drink no more
[2:13:37] amen if you're a mitchell smoker try to
[2:13:40] give it up and can't do it
[2:13:41] surrender that to him watch what happens
[2:13:45] amen he'll make that body come in
[2:13:47] subjection to the word
[2:13:50] but you've got to surrender it to him
[2:13:51] you've got to believe him
[2:13:54] as many as received him to them he gave
[2:13:56] you power
[2:13:57] to be sons of god he makes our body
[2:14:00] they obey his will
[2:14:04] they obey his will also you believe that
[2:14:06] if you're a christian
[2:14:07] you have to you say he makes our bodies
[2:14:11] obey
[2:14:12] oh i believe we have jurisdiction over
[2:14:13] that and there are some of you do
[2:14:17] so you put a still put on paint still
[2:14:20] cut your hair
[2:14:21] still wear the wrong kind of clothes
[2:14:23] still use
[2:14:24] abusive drugs and alcohol and this and
[2:14:27] that because you got jurisdiction of it
[2:14:30] but you're not fully surrendered
[2:14:35] amen but when them whole worldly
[2:14:38] thoughts die
[2:14:40] and that old man that old sin nature
[2:14:43] dies
[2:14:44] and you're born again anew you're a new
[2:14:47] creature in christ
[2:14:48] jesus and old things are passed away
[2:14:51] and behold all things become new
[2:14:54] and it's not hard anymore to live a
[2:14:57] christian life
[2:14:58] there's no struggle
[2:15:02] it's natural and it's supernatural
[2:15:07] what you could not do before it does for
[2:15:09] you
[2:15:12] amen it changes you and what a secure
[2:15:15] feeling that is is knowing and watching
[2:15:16] the holy spirit
[2:15:17] change your nature from a vile person
[2:15:21] and then know you pass them death into
[2:15:23] life and see his holy spirit
[2:15:25] living in his life and so then his works
[2:15:29] become on display
[2:15:33] manifested sons
[2:15:40] your little sisters new men all of us
[2:15:44] we walk down the streets displaying
[2:15:47] the gospel of jesus christ
[2:15:52] amen displaying the gospel of jesus
[2:15:56] christ
[2:15:57] it's lived out of our lives it's
[2:15:59] manifest
[2:16:01] it's messiahs on this play
[2:16:05] no not not just oh we all we healed the
[2:16:07] sick we did this we had a
[2:16:09] miracle here you know that no our lives
[2:16:12] are displaying his character
[2:16:16] you know we're we're missing something
[2:16:18] you know we're we're doing a lot of
[2:16:20] preaching on the flash and
[2:16:22] the flash and the flash and listen get
[2:16:25] the holy ghost
[2:16:26] and you won't have to worry about the
[2:16:28] flesh
[2:16:30] you'll have something that will rule the
[2:16:32] flesh
[2:16:34] there is therefore now no condemnation
[2:16:37] to them who are in christ jesus who walk
[2:16:40] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[2:16:45] sure you feed your flesh it's going to
[2:16:47] destroy you
[2:16:48] but if you get the holy ghost you won't
[2:16:50] feed the flesh
[2:16:53] you'll walk in the spirit it'll teach
[2:16:56] you and guide you and lead you into all
[2:16:58] truths
[2:17:00] that's why brother branham said we find
[2:17:02] there's something missing in our
[2:17:03] churches it's the power of christ
[2:17:06] it starts on the very elementary level
[2:17:08] we've got to live right first
[2:17:12] it's not a bunch of do's and don'ts it's
[2:17:15] about a nature change
[2:17:18] you know you no more have to tell
[2:17:20] christians anymore don't
[2:17:22] don't do this and don't do that and
[2:17:24] don't do that
[2:17:25] any more than walking out looking at
[2:17:27] apple trees don't you never
[2:17:29] bear any pears
[2:17:34] you never have to tell that apple tree
[2:17:36] don't bear pears
[2:17:38] you're an apple tree
[2:17:45] right because why it's from the nature
[2:17:50] it's from the nature it's from the root
[2:17:55] and when you are from the root christ
[2:17:58] then christ is going to be through all
[2:17:59] the branches
[2:18:01] then these signs will follow them that
[2:18:03] believe
[2:18:05] hallelujah then they live overcoming
[2:18:07] lives and then
[2:18:08] there will be that power
[2:18:12] that is in the church brother branham
[2:18:15] said we're missing something
[2:18:17] we're missing power we ought to have
[2:18:19] where the big machine ought to be
[2:18:21] running and great signs and wonders
[2:18:23] which building ought to be full of the
[2:18:25] power of god till sinners couldn't stay
[2:18:27] in here
[2:18:27] the holy spirit condemned it right
[2:18:29] quickly like that
[2:18:30] like ananias of our and we're missing
[2:18:36] something
[2:18:40] then he say where are we short
[2:18:44] god i want to live to see the day
[2:18:50] that the church of jesus christ can be
[2:18:52] one in purpose
[2:18:54] heart and body standing in the full
[2:18:58] anointed power of the holy spirit
[2:19:00] to perform and work like jesus did
[2:19:03] with god in them too
[2:19:09] too often we're still preaching
[2:19:10] reformation
[2:19:12] instead of restoration
[2:19:16] pastors are trying to reform the church
[2:19:18] and she can't be reformed
[2:19:21] without making just another
[2:19:22] denominational child
[2:19:24] denomination of children still had to be
[2:19:26] reformed by constant preaching
[2:19:28] against the sins of flesh if you ever
[2:19:30] get that man or woman converted
[2:19:32] you don't have to worry about the deeds
[2:19:34] of the flesh
[2:19:36] amen
[2:19:41] what god is once he wants sons of god
[2:19:45] with power
[2:19:47] and that power starts with your flesh
[2:19:52] bringing it subject
[2:19:55] bring it to the obedience to the will of
[2:19:57] christ
[2:19:58] listen when when man sin he yielded his
[2:20:02] members to satan to sin with
[2:20:07] right in other words his hands his feet
[2:20:10] his eyes his mouth
[2:20:11] his mouth that never spoke guiled was
[2:20:13] never dishonest
[2:20:16] he yielded that to satan and now he
[2:20:18] begins to speak that
[2:20:20] now he begins to behave in ways that he
[2:20:23] would have never done as a son of god
[2:20:26] because why sin nature had taken hold
[2:20:30] but when you're born again you're a new
[2:20:32] creature in christ
[2:20:34] and sin nature has no more dominion sin
[2:20:37] does not have dominion over you
[2:20:39] it does not reign over your body you
[2:20:42] reign over sin
[2:20:45] and you bring that body subject to the
[2:20:47] word of god
[2:20:48] now you are members we're at
[2:20:50] righteousness
[2:20:56] amen
[2:21:00] we're going to stop right there because
[2:21:03] i want to deal
[2:21:04] in the next time what sin did
[2:21:08] it made a chasm between man and god
[2:21:14] but then i want to show you what the new
[2:21:17] birth does
[2:21:19] it takes the chasm completely away
[2:21:23] where there's never even a remembrance
[2:21:26] anymore
[2:21:27] that god can never look at and say one
[2:21:29] time you were over there
[2:21:37] and you don't ever have to worry about
[2:21:39] falling in the chasm again
[2:21:41] because it's gone forever
[2:21:49] and you stand under the blood as an
[2:21:51] adopted son
[2:21:53] and operate as a son bringing
[2:21:56] everything under dominion
[2:22:01] sin unbelief
[2:22:06] doubt every kind of sin whatever you
[2:22:09] name it
[2:22:10] you bring it under it's dominion
[2:22:14] you have dominion again you're a son
[2:22:21] a messiah on display
[2:22:26] let's stand together that the musician
[2:22:28] comes
[2:22:29] let me just read this to you remember
[2:22:32] when sin
[2:22:34] entered the picture it put a breach a
[2:22:36] chasm between god and man
[2:22:41] but reformation will never bring you
[2:22:43] back only restoration
[2:22:45] and brother bradley said in the future
[2:22:47] home just like all the curse of sin is
[2:22:49] gone
[2:22:50] when the holy ghost accepts you
[2:22:54] you don't accept it it accepts you
[2:22:58] because it's god's attribute see if it's
[2:23:00] the holy ghost it means god's spirit and
[2:23:02] it's the attribute
[2:23:03] the thought of god has accepted you
[2:23:06] because you were
[2:23:06] ordained for that purpose yet you were
[2:23:09] born in sin
[2:23:10] but god had that attribute and here you
[2:23:13] expressed yourself on here on earth
[2:23:15] and he comes down and gets you
[2:23:19] and your back here here is where you
[2:23:21] belong
[2:23:22] see sin has lost its power that's right
[2:23:26] this desire of sin has done gone
[2:23:29] from your heart when the holy spirit
[2:23:31] comes in
[2:23:32] you are a restored person
[2:23:40] not a reformed person a restored
[2:23:44] person restored to what what god
[2:23:48] had in his mind of you before the world
[2:23:51] began
[2:23:56] a restored person
[2:24:02] that's where we're standing that's what
[2:24:05] the message is about
[2:24:07] restoration is not about reformation
[2:24:13] find that old song redeemed how i love
[2:24:16] to proclaim it redeemed by the blood of
[2:24:18] the lamb
[2:24:20] let's just worship god for a moment
