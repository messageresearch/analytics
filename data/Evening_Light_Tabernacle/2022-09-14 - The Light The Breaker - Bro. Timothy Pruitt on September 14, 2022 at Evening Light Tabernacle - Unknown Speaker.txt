god would just break out over our hearts drive out all the darkness away and all the funny feelings and all the things lord and we've allowed to build up just to let this wash it all away by your blood we submit our hearts to you today father we love you we thank you for all that you've done in jesus name amen amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen i said it's good to be in the house of the lord amen micah 2 and verse 12 and uh also second samuel 5 and verse 19. i'd like to speak to you tonight how this chapter says i will surely assemble o jacob all of thee i like that he's not he's not interested in leaving a hoof behind he's not interested in making a pact with the devil you take these and i'll take these no all that are mine i'm going to take all of thee and i will surely gather the remnant of israel and i will put them together as the sheep of basra as the flock in the midst of their fold and they shall make great noise by the reason of the multitude of men and the breaker has come up before them they have broken up or in other words they have broken out of what held them and have passed through the gate and are gone out by it and their king shall pass before them and the lord on the head of them also i want to look at a second samuel 5 and verse 19. we know this story of david ziglag he said the lord and david inquired of the lord saying shall i go up to the philistines wilt thou deliver them into my hand and the lord said unto david go up for i will doubtlessly deliver the philistines into thy hand i love that i will doubtlessly deliver doubtless deliver the fl plistings in thy hand and david came to bail parism and david smote them there and said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place bel-perezem you know i was just looking back there as we was preparing preparing to come out it means that word bill perism means the lord of the breakthrough the lord of the breakthrough amen we'll let you be seated i'd like to speak to you on the light the breaker the light the breaker the breaker is a word that means to break through to break over to burst to breach to break out to break open to break in pieces to break out violently upon and that's what he's described here in our scripture as the breaker amen is the breaker and i was just thinking of the word breaker you know we use the break of dawn how the light when it breaks over the horizon it actually begins to sends the ray of light out and no matter the darkness or whatever is going on light begins to push back all the darkness and as you know we've been on that for quite some time and and i was just thinking about that though and where we're living amen we know that in the evening time there shall be light again and we see the light that is breaking upon amen the evening time which is a has an evening time people that are receiving the light of the word and and i believe that there is a breakout or a breaking upon that not only is he breaking up the enemies that has held us and the enemies that has tried to keep us from our inheritance amen but he's breaking us out of our our things that we've our traditions or the things that we've held amen for hundreds of years or 50 years or 40 years or five years he's allowing those things to be broken off of us so we can go on with him and i love how the scripture puts it the breaker shall come up before them but not just before them he's also the one who leads the way and i looked at that you know the breaker there's different things that are that it goes to that you know there's a ship that goes into the frozen tundra or the frozen north and the arctic and you can go through just very thick ice and begin to push its way and it begins to break through that ice so that other ships could pass through there and you know what i i think of i think of that as we're not on this battle or on this trail alone but there's already been somebody that has made the way there's already been somebody that has went through the trials that we're facing he's already been somebody that's facing the situations that we're going through even today amen the things in our lives or the situations that we don't know how to handle or we don't know how to get he's there breaking it he's already broken it up he's already handled it he's already got the answer for it and we know we can trust him in this time that we're living in and you know and i i was looking at this thought on david just just very briefly i haven't actually got to really delve into it but just before i came out and he's the lord of the breakthrough amen and he's the god of the breakthrough and so david here is in a very tough situation as we know as he's lost his family and he's lost things and and david you'll follow david's life you'll find this from one battle to another battle it's from one moment to another moment dealing with the enemy amen sounds like a lot like us you go from one moment you get past that and it's another moment again you get past that and you go through another moment amen it's like every enemy is listen we we sing the song god never start in the waymaker miracle worker he never stops working well let me tell you the devil don't ever stop either he's constantly coming against us he's constantly trying to push us back he's constantly trying to make us stop for just a second and doubt our god-given call and position in this life and so he's always there and this was david's life it was constantly from one battle to another battle and i thought i was very well put together here as i was looking at this real quick he was going from one battle to another battle if he would drive the philistines out and he'd face them again somewhere else and later down in the in the scripture it was a valley of referendum which is which means from which i've already been healed from or means i've already dealt with this and so here he is going from one battle to another battle amen but the breaker was there with him every step of the way and we know the stories he inquired amen he went down and he was able to gather back all of his family and all the goods and bring them all back and he brought them back and he said behold my god has come like a flood upon my enemy he's come against him and he has broken them up that i may be able to gather what is rightfully mine and i'm thankful i've served that same god god is not interested in leaving us behind he's not interested in leaving one person behind but he's going to go through the hardest valleys or how what the darkest places wherever he's got a seed he's going to go after them amen and we know that he's going to be there with us and he's going to move that through in possibilities when things look impossible he's going to move through that because he's the breaker he's the battering ram he's the head he's leading this army you're not alone you're not the one in charge he's the one in charge and he's pushing it on through to victory i'm thankful for that we're not pushing to another defeat or another let down we're pushing to a victory and that's what we're looking for and i and i was looking at this thought and i began to think about brother branham would bring out arnold von wrinklerit of switzerland and how he would look at his homeland and how they had been attacked and surrounded by the german armies and things and and they they were there to try to defend their homes and defend their families and and defend their their god-given rights and their god-given privileges and they're looking at a great army that was trained and seemed impossible looked like a brick wall and spears and shields and the top the top-notch helmets and the top-notch shields and everything and all they had was a few sickles and a few holes and a few things that they could get together and it looked like they were going to to face utter defeat it looked like they were very they were helpless they had no answer but there was this young man that said you know he said inspiration struck him and he he began to look at that army and he began to get very angry but he said because because behind him was his sweetheart behind him was his homeland behind him was what god had given him and before him was the enemy that was trying to take that from him amen i believe we ought to get angry at our enemy amen the light of god actually brother madam said he would look there at that red sea out of that light out of that pillar of fire with angry eyes and that red sea would begin to move back and begin he said he said matter of fact it moved back and so fast in such a way and that fire began to burn down through there he said they walked across on dry land he said why they didn't even get their feet muddy ever been in a slop you know an old pond somewhere and step off in it i remember when we used to baptize you would go up to almost your knees and mud you know how long it would take for you to be able to walk across something that's been wet that long and not just get your feet not get your feet wet but not even get mud on there amen the fire of god began to look at the blockage that was before the people of god with angry eyes and begin to look at it and begin to challenge it oh i love it when the holy spirit begins to challenge the devil amen begins to say you don't belong here you're in the you're in my people's way you're in the way to the promised land and you're going to move back and my people's going to cross you hallelujah amen i believe that the pillar of fire tonight is looking through angry eyes and cancer and looking through angry eyes and bitterness and looking through angry eyes of unforgiveness and looking through angry eyes and saying you will not hold my people back you will not hold him back for the promises of god but you're going to let them go through amen you're going to let them go through your victory hallelujah amen you know this man began to look with angry eyes and he got tired of what was before him and and the shouts that was over there and the taunts that was over there and he said look man i just kissed my wife and three children goodbye there's a little home there and they're standing in the door watching for me to come home but this day i'm going to get my life for switzerland what are you going to do you just follow me and with whatever you got to fight you fight with all that's in you amen what are you going to do he said he threw down what he had in his hand and he seen that great army coming he looked all over it until he found the very thickest of spears where there was the greatest garrison where it was the worst where was the toughest to make it through and he began to make his way straight for the worst and he screamed out make way for liberty and he screamed again make way for liberty and he ran straight to those spears and he gathered them and plunged them into his chest and it was such a display of heroism that it rattled the army and those little swiss men with sticks and stones and single blades begin to fight and begin to fight with everything they have and they haven't had a war since [Applause] amen that that kind of heroism is seldom compared with and never exceeded switzerland today still remembers it what that man did he said oh brothers and sisters that was such a small thing one day our race was backed up against a wall or they had prophets they had laws and they had killed the prophets and destroyed the law and adam's race was backed up helpless and hopeless against an oncoming enemy he said but the devil and all his hosts were saying i got him i got him but one stepped out of glory hallelujah the breaker came down and he looked at the worst part he looked at hell itself and he said i'm going to take it and i'm going to put it in my body and i'm going to overcome it so the rest of them can overcome [Applause] hallelujah he said well-trained spirit beings these demons of hell mortals there was no match for them what could they do they were helpless but there was one who wasn't helpless and he stepped out from the glories of glory amen and he said i'll go down i'll go down and get my life for adam's race and when he was here on earth he found the darkest spot of spears it was death the darkest place and he grabbed an armful of them at calvary and plunged them to his death and he left the commission with his church that little ragged group uneducated illiterate he never left them with just sticks and stones to fight with but he left him with the greatest weapon in the church's hands it's ever had he said follow me and fight with all that's in you he led the way he led the way you might feel helpless tonight you might feel hopeless tonight but there's somebody that's already went there there's already somebody that fought cancer and overcome there's already somebody that fought sugar diabetes and overcome there's already somebody that fought mind battles and overcome i'm going to tell you something tonight i'm looking at something with angry eyes there's a devil that's coming and attacking one of our young girls in the night and coming and taunting her i'm sick and tired of that nonsense the church of the living god ain't got to put up with it we got to put up with that torment spirit it's already been one they've come and conquered it and i'm here to let that torment devil that wants to show up to a little girl's house and torment her you come to the wrong place there is a light here that is looking at you with angry eyes so you take your slimy hairs and you go back to hell where you came from hallelujah we're not putting up with it we don't have to put up with it when he was on earth he conquered he was the breaker he conquered sicknesses he conquered blindness he conquered leprosy he conquered deafness he conquered a palsy he conquered uh uh mental problems he conquered it all even just in case i left one out he conquered it all amen he showed i am the breaker and he broke amen he broke blindness he broke deafness he broke spirits of torment he broke amen that would hold me in and hold him down for years and he would walk out of a boat across the stormy sea and go what was it he was the breaker the waves were trying to break him but they couldn't conquer him because he was the breaker and he would stand there and say peace be still because he had a job to do there was somebody on the other side that were being tormented by spirits and tormented by demons of hell and tormented by things in their lives and he had the word that would set them free and he wasn't going to let a few waves get in his way he wasn't going to let a little trouble get in his way oh church of the living god we also have the breaker with us and we're not going to let a little trouble get in our way we're not going to let nothing stop us we're going to go to victory we're going to go to complete victory do we set every captive free that's god's children he knew the authority man a man when a man lay in the grave he conquered death sicknesses when maniac came out to destroy him the maniac realized he was the son of god he said oh if you'll cast us out sufferers to go to that bunch of hogs for he knew the authority that jesus christ had he conquered the devil everywhere he met him hallelujah and he not only conquered in himself but he left the commission to the church that you ask anything in my name and that i'll do fight with what's in your hands well i'm not a preacher okay let's quote if it's singing sing the gospel if you can't do nothing but whistle whistle as loud as you can for the glory of god hallelujah if you can't do no more than patch your hands pat them with all you got conquer with whatever that's in your hands clap them in such a way that all the neighbors will love you amen hallelujah whistle in such a way that all the denominations will know that you belong to christ conquer them we're living in a day where this social gospel is becoming predominant when churches are uniting themselves together making a social religion by it's a terrible day that's right to take all the deity and all the glory away from christ trying to make him just a prophet if christ was just a prophet where everyone lost but he was more than a prophet he was god amen he said that's just the nomination no no no that's right here in our ranks brother brown would tell that story heard it many times about a woman says there's one thing i don't like about your your meetings you're speaking what is it you try to magnify christ too much you brag on him too much he tried to make him more than what he is i don't know if we could ever make him more than what he is amen if he said if i had 10 000 languages i would exhaust them and never could never explain what he really is he's worthy of every praise hallelujah she said well mr branham i heard you away from the platform that your fundamentals according the word yes if i explain to you and prove to you by the word that he was just a man you try to make him deity i said he was deity god was in christ reconciling the world to himself i said if he's if he's just a prophet we're all lost he said i'll prove it we'll prove it if the bible said that she said well we went down the grave of lazarus in saint john the 11th chapter of the bible said he wept and if he had been deity he could not weep so that made him nothing but just an ordinary man no that made him god because he knew where he was bringing lazarus from and he knew what he was bringing him back to again come on somebody amen he said sister your argument's no good i you failed to see you saw the man but you still fail to see god in the man it's the truth when he went down to the grave of lazarus he was weeping like a man but when he pulled those little shoulders back devil you seen him before when he pulled those little shoulders back and he said lazarus come forth he said that was more than a man hallelujah hallelujah and he's pulling them little shoulders back tonight again and saying you devil amen there's been toward men and sister leah carr you let her go we ain't taking your nonsense no more i'm sick of it hallelujah it ain't just me god sick of it you have tried to destroy her you were trying to take her down and you hadn't won yet and you're not going to win so take your drizzy homie slimy hands over god's property and when that resurrection force went for a dead man well let me tell you the resurrected voice resurrection voice the power is in this building tonight you may not be dead behind a stone somewhere but you might be dead in sins and trespasses dead and unbelievable and don't know who you really are but there's a voice and there's a god here that's square and his shoulders back and he says come forth come forth the devil's trying to seal you in terms of bitterness and tombs of unforgiveness come out of there he's a mighty conqueror oh he was a man when he came off the mountain and was hungry and had nothing to hear but when he looked at that fig tree and it didn't have no fruit he said cursed be you and it was withered in just a few moments the disciples marveled at it he was a man when he was hungry but when he took five biscuits and two little fish and he fed five thousand that was more than a man he would tear that fish off and another piece was there and it wasn't just just caught he didn't have to clean it gut it cook it it was already prepared do you realize god's got a blessing prepared for you just as i heard about if you ain't listening to it i believe it's still online brother wayne's lawson's preaching a few times in line for a miracle what you do is you don't get out of line you don't let a devil get you out of line amen nope i'm here to receive it i'm here to get my portion i ain't leaving until i got it because the breaker is here and he's breaking off love and he's breaking off compassion and he's breaking off forgiveness and he's breaking off all the things that i have need of and i'm going to receive what i have need of fed 5 000 that was more than a man that was god in a man christ jesus deity truly if he was a man in the back of a little boat the night when ten thousand devils swore they'd drown and flopping around like a little bottle stopper in that sea the devil see it all we got him now but when he woke up and he put his little foot on the bow that boat and he said peace be still could you imagine devils were riding in waves we got him we got him all of a sudden they seen him stand up i'm almost there just waiting i'm almost there let me get there let me get there no peace be still the breaker was there he was more than a man he was a man when he cried for mercy he died like a man but on easter morning [Applause] when the seal of the roman government was put over there and they tried to seal the tomb and they try to put guards around and they try to do everything they could to keep him in it i heard something the other day i thought was so wonderful if he wanted to in that body he could have just walked out and that stone still be there it could have still been sealed the roman army could have never known nothing about it but he broke out of there and he rolled that stone away so you would know he came out hallelujah amen he broke it and he protested to the side amen and he said and when they when the children because the two women came what was it there was an angel sitting on the stone the very thing they had used to try to hold him in a turn they were now sitting on it what happened the breaker came and it cast that old thing away and now you can sit on it now you can rise above it now it's not holding you you're holding it come on somebody that devil can be broke out of your life and it won't no longer hold you but you'll be holding it he's under my feet he's under my feet he's under my face he was more than a man he was more than a man he was god's mighty conqueror he said oh how we should love him tonight how we should praise him how should we should love one another as he loved us and gave himself for us that we might be more than conquerors through him who conquered sickness death and hell you understand that thought on more than a conqueror it wasn't muhammad ali got to check for the fight he was a great conqueror but when he got home he handed to her wife his wife she was more than a conqueror she didn't have to fight a lick she didn't have to take a punch she didn't have to go down to death come on now she didn't have to go down to hell she didn't have to do none of that he came back and said here it's yours i give you the keys you don't even have to go down there you don't even have to experience what's down there i already experienced it for you so you're not just a conqueror you're more than the conqueror because you don't have to go to hell you don't have to go down to death amen death and hell you have the keys to it it's been given to you and you have authority over it did you hear what i said you have the authority over death did we not just say that death was the darkest spot he took yes well then if you got the authority over death it's the strongest most powerful amen the the worst part and you got it it's under your feet so under death is cancer sugar diabetes any kind of sickness any kind of sin any kind of thing it's all stacked up underneath him amen what was that when the breaker came and he and he brought those five kings out and he sat there and he laid them all out and he put them they said you come put your foot on their neck and they all came and they put their foot on what was they doing they were showing i got the king but also got his kingdom i have authority over the king and i also have authority over his kingdom do you realize when the devil lost at calvary he does not even have authority at his own house [Applause] he can only go as far as the pillar of fire let him go there's something called a breaker in your house some of you have to look for it because all of a sudden you'll be cooking some popcorn pop something wrong with this dumb thing you realize oh the electricity's been cut off let me go find the issue and you go searching for your breaker box how many knows you got to break your box okay good and there you know there's breakers in the breaker box okay good and you go and you open it up and you say no no there it is and you flip it back over and electricity comes in a breaker is something that cuts the current off it makes it where it can't go no further it can only go so far and when amen when it's time for it to to be broke and you can go in there yourself you may need to work on a certain outlet or certain sometimes you got to flip off every switch till you find it but if you got them you've done the right thing and you marked them you're going to say well this is the one i'm working on pop and you go check it yep it's off and you go work on it but if you ever turn the wrong one off you'll know it right but there's a breaker there and it is not it's only allowing the electricity to run through it but once the flip the switches flip it can't go there no more and this is the breaker amen he's allowing the devil to do certain things and allowing him to go certain places but there comes a point that he just switches it off and he can't go no further he lost his power he don't have power to do anymore he can scream he can holler he can do all he can throw a fit he can throw a five five-year-old hissy fear it doesn't matter he don't have power to go any further this is what he told you when he came up to job he said well he serves you because you got a wall built around him he said well i'll tell you what i'll take the wall down he said but you do anything but take his life there was a breaker put there he said you can only go so far and you won't go any further did you hear me devil you can only go so far and you can't go no further because there's a breaker that's been placed upon you from calvary the sickness he never preached a funeral death couldn't stay in his presence and it still can't how could death and life live together they can't do it that's the reason today when the church is born of the spirit of the living god death and life can't hold together something takes place and christ comes in and it conquers our passions conquers our desires conquers everything ungodly about us because he lives we can live also he conquers everything already dead and it's laying in our hands just to receive it we see him on this earthly ministry as a conqueror certainly we do but now let's watch him after he died he still went on concrete it never ended in the grave his soul descended into hell and he preached in the spirits that were in prison souls that were in prison and it repented not in the long suffering days of noah i can see him as the heavens and earth turned black and rocks and belched upon the mountains whole heavens the moon and stars refused to sign shine he conquered it he went down there to where they were at where the people made fun of enoch and they made fun of noah and they laughed but they knew now the conquerors here the breakers here the devil he says i'll see him go past all of them i love how he puts and he knocked on the devil doors of the devil's hell the doors of the devil's hell and the devil comes to this door and we can see him as he looks here you are after all i sure thought i had you when i killed those prophets down through those ages i sure thought i had you when i had cut john's head off in prison but now after all you're here stupid deal all of a sudden he said i can hear him as he begin to speak he straightens his shoulders back must be a sure sign of something shoulders come back satan i'm the virgin born son of the living god my blood is still wet on the cross i paid the price i've come i have come down i have conquered and i've come to take over i've come to strip you of everything you ever claimed you had and it reached over on his side satan's side and he jerked the keys of death and hell off with him and he kicked him back into hell where he belonged and he liked to shook the hinges off the door when he slammed it in his face oh hallelujah he now put him on his side he said what's the church scared about tonight we don't have a reason to be scared he conquered satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell and remember there was some more that went with him he passed by paradise and all of a sudden the doors come open and say and abraham said hey that's the one that made us under that oak tree there he is amen there's a mid-wheel in the middle of the wheel daniel said there's the one who was with me in the lion's den three hebrew children said yep i've been telling you boys that's the one that met me in the fire he was there when i was about to die he was there when my last hope but here he is now what we doing lord what's the next command come on with me we're going to take a little trip we're going to make a little whistle stop hallelujah and he made a little whistle stop and they began to appear among many until they was beginning to be recognized i pray he makes a real whistle stop here tonight on that four o'clock sunday morning he stepped out of the grave more than a conqueror conquered as he was speaking in his last moments he was had so conquered everything around him that gravitation began to be conquered and light began to come under his feet and hundreds of brethren watching as he begins to move up ascending him in the old testament saints going into glory and they just moved right into the air all of a sudden old testament saints came inside of that beautiful city and they screamed out with one great blast that shook to heaven lift up you everlasting gates be lifted up let the king of glory come in let the king of glory come in and i say lift up evenly like tabernacle lift up let the king of glory come in who is the king of glory who is the king of glory who is the king of glory he's the lord mighty in battle hallelujah lift up your heads amen we're not going down to the feet we're rising up hallelujah we're about ready to walk over every cancer every spirit of hell everything as we they watch us take our body chains lift up you talking about a welcome home those gates swung open oh hell the power of jesus name he came to the father's throne father here they are they were faithful over a few things get up here son and sit on my right hand until i make thou foes thy footsto and there he stands tonight lo behold the mighty conqueror lo and behold him in plain view for he's the mighty conqueror since he rent the veil into it used to be a problem to go beyond the veil now it's a problem not to go beyond the veil because the breaker came they couldn't go there only the high priest could go there and they could only one go once a year into the holy of holies but now because the breaker has come you have the right every moment of your life to go into the holy of holies the breaker has made the way he said every angel every archangel of hell ever principality ever power he tore down and spoiled at his crucifixion and resurrection everything satan had he broke through the veil of sin he tore it apart and he's the high priest's blood of his own body he came to the next what was it there was a veil of sickness that held over the people and he tore it apart he was wounded for our transgression and by his stripes were healed he went to the great veil yonder of sickness the great bell of sin and he went through the great veil of worry he went through the great veil of fear he tore every one of them down he's the breaker and he ascended so high and he received a name above every name that's named in the heavens above or the earth below and the world to come god taking that lovely one who stooped down solo but he took our place so we didn't have to break it and so it wouldn't break us he sits today the mighty conqueror he would come down in luke chapter 4 and verse 18. and he'd say the spirit of the lord is upon me amen you better not do anything without the spirit of the lord you need his spirit it's the anointing that breaks the yoke the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives to the recovering of the sight of the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year or the year of jubilee the acceptable year of the lord amen that is so what is it don't don't keep pushing that off to another time this hour that we're living in is our hour it's our time it's our moment it's our year of jubilee so therefore we cannot sit still and let the devil put clamps on our worship put clamps on what we believe or put chains of circumstances upon it we can't allow that to happen it's already been broken [Applause] psalms 107 13 said they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses he brought them out of darkness in the shadow of death and what break their bands in sunder oh that man would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he has broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder this is what we we heard you know brother branham talk about the the bars that held people and they were held behind bars and brother branham helped me and he said i don't have no strength to do nothing about them bars i can't break them i can't open it up i don't know what to do and they said help us please help us and he said i i he said all of a sudden he saw a great light and it began to begin to save in house of hell give way to the name of jesus and he said when he spoke those words that bar began to break what was it it was the breaker brother branham couldn't deliver this message on his own he couldn't deliver the people of god for an exodus no law no more than moses could with a rod and a donkey he was ill-equipped but he had the light and the light was going before him moses didn't go there by himself to egypt the light was already there william branham didn't come to laodicea by himself the light was already here and it was breaking and it was breaking upon the people that you don't have to sit where you are you don't have to be bound by drugs and alcohol and spirits of hell you can be free this is a year of jubilee this may turn take just a bit of a left turn but bear with me matthew 21 and verse 12 look at the breaker jesus went into the temple of god and he cast out all them that was sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and he said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves the next verse and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple what did it have to be it had to be a breakthrough take place these people had set with traditions after year after year after year and they'd put clamps upon their worship they'd put clamps and you had to do so much to do this pay pennies buy this do that and they'd put it all there and god said your offerings are as a stench i didn't want an offering that you bought somebody else raised and you they went through all the sacrifice i wanted you to come and present a sacrifice i wanted you to lay it on the altar and it'd be something that meant something to you but you was giving it to me but they turned the house of worship amen into nothing but a tradition it was just a good service on sunday and we'll have another one on wednesday and we're going to do this and we're going to sing so many songs and we're going to have a prayer and we're going to sing so many songs we're going to have this we're going to do that and there's no room for the spirit of god to move in the house of god and it's all been clamped down somebody gets to shouting and singing people online are making fun and they're making jokes and caring all what is it they're trying to put clamps on the worship but the breaker came through he said let's clean all of this out so we can have some church so that's what he's doing tonight he said let's go ahead and let's clean out all the bitterness tonight let's clean out all the unforgiveness tonight let's clean all out the old hard feelings tonight let's clean out all the things that we've been holding on for hundreds of years traditions of men let's just clean them all out and if he has to he'll braid a will whatever he's got to do to clean it out he's going to thoroughly purge his floor why because he wants to be worshipped he wants to be praised he wants to be adored he wants everything you got he wants a sacrifice of praise not a tradition not just well i'm here tonight i'm just going to pay my due no i'm here for one thing god saved me god healed me god delivered me god's done so much for me god's done so much for me i can't but help tell it all i can't help but praise him i can't help but worship him oh let the breaker come through tonight hallelujah let him break those hard feelings let him break those complexes let him break those fears let him break it all off of you then the lame can be healed and the blind can be healed and cancer be driven out let the breaker come through i don't care if it breaks me into pieces i want to be broken and laid upon his altar hallelujah can you stay standing and when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple saying hosanna to the son of david worshipping him and giving him glory that he was due this was what he was desiring not a forced worship something coming from the heart how long has it been since your heart worshipped and you allowed yourself to just let go and let god have his way he said what are you trying to get us to dance no i'm trying to let you get you to let go i don't care if you sit in your seat and you squall like a baby or whatever happens to you it does not matter as long as you let go and let god have his way that's all that matters amen amen so the breaker can come through and he can heal and he can deliver and he can set free and then you can begin to scream hosanna to the son of david but they were so displeased and he said unto them hears thou what they say and they said unto him here you hear what they're saying to you he says yeah have you never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise those that have been on the breast of el shaddai [Music] those that have been nursing strength the mouth of babes thou has perfected praise god don't want sloppy praise he wants perfect praise god don't want half praise he wants all of it god wants everything you can offer don't you ever forget how powerful when you begin to just lift up your hands and begin to worship god and thank you for what he done for you today [Applause] i wonder i heard a scene a sign just the other day said what would you have tomorrow if you only thanked him for that you only if you only got what you thanked him for today [Music] mercy jesus amen you got to he wants perfect praise he wants you to lay it aside and say you know what i got time cause he took time for me and he came down and he laid down his life and he went down to hell so i ain't got to go to hell and he went down to took death so i ain't gotta take death oh god's done so much for me has he done something for you has he set you free has he delivered you oh praise the name of the lord then i would say let the perfected praise come forth let it come forth out of your mouth and say god
