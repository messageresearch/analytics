[47:55] hey man let me just find my place here
[47:57] just thinking about wednesday night and
[48:00] trying to figure out what to preach you
[48:02] know sometimes you just
[48:03] a minister will study and have things on
[48:05] his heart and then only to get to it and
[48:08] things just completely change at the
[48:09] last minute and i'm just thinking about
[48:11] wednesday night and how the lord just
[48:12] used the end of the service and we had
[48:14] all the evidence of the land and we know
[48:17] that it's a good land and you know i
[48:19] just couldn't get away from it so today
[48:20] we're just going to look at the promised
[48:21] land and
[48:22] as it pertains to the believer and i
[48:24] want to speak to you on god does
[48:25] impossible math part 17
[48:28] but i want to give this a subtitle make
[48:30] your move
[48:31] i want to be personal to each of you
[48:33] this morning not your neighbor not your
[48:35] mama not your daddy not your brother not
[48:37] your sister but you got to make your
[48:40] move
[48:41] amen we find here in deuteronomy verse 1
[48:43] or chapter 1 and verse 19
[48:45] and when
[48:46] and when they had departed from horeb
[48:49] we went through all the great terrible
[48:50] wilderness which you saw by the way of
[48:53] the mountains of the amorites as the
[48:55] lord our god commanded us and we came to
[48:57] kadesh barnea and i said unto you you
[49:01] are coming to the mountain of the
[49:03] amorites notice he's telling them where
[49:05] they're coming you're coming to the
[49:06] mountain of the amorites which the lord
[49:09] our god doeth give unto us
[49:12] behold the lord thy god set the land
[49:14] before thee go up and possess it as the
[49:16] lord our god of thy fathers hath said
[49:18] unto thee fear not
[49:21] neither be discouraged
[49:24] and you came near unto me every one of
[49:26] you and said well we will send men
[49:29] before us that they shall search out the
[49:31] land and bring us word again by
[49:33] what way we must go up and into what
[49:35] cities we shall come and the saying
[49:37] pleased me well and i took 12 men of you
[49:39] one of a tribe
[49:41] and they turned and they went to the
[49:42] mountain and they came into the valley
[49:44] of escola and they searched it out and
[49:46] they took the fruit of the land in their
[49:47] hands and they brought it down unto us
[49:50] and brought us word again and said it is
[49:52] a good land which the lord our god doeth
[49:54] give us
[49:55] not withstanding you would not go up but
[49:58] rebelled against the commandment of the
[49:59] lord your god and you murmured in your
[50:01] tents and you said because the lord
[50:03] hated us
[50:05] now notice how the devil can flip the
[50:06] script the lord hateth us
[50:09] and he has brought us forth out of the
[50:11] land of egypt to deliver us into the
[50:14] hand of the amorites to destroy us now
[50:16] god just said i've taken you to the land
[50:18] of amorite so you can have it it's going
[50:19] to be yours
[50:21] whether whither shall we go up our
[50:23] brethren have discouraged our hearts
[50:24] saying the people is greater and taller
[50:26] than we the cities are great and walled
[50:28] up to heaven moreover we have seen the
[50:30] sins of anakin's there then i said unto
[50:32] you dread not
[50:34] neither be afraid of them the lord your
[50:36] god goeth before you he shall fight for
[50:38] you according to all that he did for you
[50:41] in the in egypt before your eyes
[50:43] and in the wilderness where thou seen
[50:45] how the lord thy god bear thee as a man
[50:47] do with bury his son and all the way
[50:49] that you went until he came into this
[50:51] place yet in the thing you did not
[50:54] believe the lord your god who went in
[50:56] the way before you to search out the
[50:58] place to put your tents in in the fire
[51:00] by night and to show you by way you
[51:02] should go in the cloud by day you can
[51:04] have your seats this morning
[51:06] like i said we want to speak to you this
[51:08] morning and i'll make your move
[51:10] and we find that the children of israel
[51:12] have come through egypt they come out
[51:14] they crossed over
[51:16] uh the red sea god done miraculous
[51:18] they've seen the ten supernatural signs
[51:21] being performed and yet they get to a
[51:23] place brother will call it as the
[51:25] scripture says kadesh barnea and this
[51:27] word cadish barnea means a holy place of
[51:30] desert wandering
[51:31] it's uh the judgment seat of the word a
[51:34] judgment seat of god it's a it's a word
[51:36] showdown it's a place that the children
[51:38] of israel had to make their decision on
[51:41] what they were going to do were they
[51:42] going to trust god and move into the
[51:44] land or were they going to listen to the
[51:46] unbelief of the spies and camp down on
[51:49] where they were at and and i believe
[51:50] before us lays here this morning we have
[51:53] a kadesh bar near setting before us do
[51:56] we allow our doubts to keep us out of
[51:57] the land do we allow our doubts to keep
[51:59] us from living free do we eventually die
[52:02] in the desert in this wasteland of never
[52:04] overcoming never ever been able to rise
[52:06] above some sin or some habit never able
[52:08] to claim the promise for myself because
[52:10] we're afraid to trust god maybe you've
[52:12] seen somebody go out in faith and or go
[52:14] out and try to trust god and they failed
[52:16] and you're looking at their failure and
[52:18] you say well if they couldn't do it i
[52:19] can't do it either and we realize every
[52:22] person here this morning you're seated
[52:24] at a k-dish barnea you have a decision
[52:27] that you must make every service is a
[52:30] showdown every service is have to make a
[52:32] decision will i believe the message will
[52:34] i move further with god or will i will i
[52:36] allow the word to change me or will i
[52:39] continue to circle around the mountain
[52:41] of unbelief that i've been camped out
[52:43] around
[52:45] so they come and they come out of sin
[52:46] they come out of unbelief they left the
[52:48] harsh treatment of egypt they left the
[52:50] world they put all these things aside
[52:52] and here they followed the word they
[52:54] followed the prophet until they got to
[52:56] this point and this was a very pivotal
[52:59] point in their walk in their journey
[53:04] do you take god at his word do we
[53:06] believe god sent a vindicated prophet do
[53:08] we move into the land or do we listen to
[53:10] all the hearsay and all the negativity
[53:12] that surrounds the messes of the hour do
[53:14] we do we believe all the negativity
[53:17] about brother branham and about how he
[53:19] missed it and about has humanity got in
[53:21] the way and and we listen to all the
[53:23] lies of the enemy or do we listen to
[53:25] what the word of god says i've given you
[53:27] the land the land belongs to you i'm
[53:30] bringing you to the place of the
[53:31] amorites but the land is yours you must
[53:34] go in at once and possess the land
[53:38] now brother baby tell us here in the
[53:40] message the results of decision he says
[53:42] we're no longer in egypt we've done
[53:44] pulled up our tent stakes and left
[53:47] we've come through the red sea the blood
[53:49] of the lord jesus we've seen all the old
[53:51] habits and things of life drowned
[53:54] the taskmasters that drove us through
[53:56] the bar rooms and to the cocktail
[53:57] lounges and so forth we've seen all that
[54:00] drown like pharaoh and his horses and
[54:02] now then we're in the wilderness moving
[54:04] along following the angel of the
[54:06] covenant the holy spirit and knowing
[54:08] that we're on the road to the great land
[54:10] he says they'll be here and during the
[54:13] days of the millennium he says and we're
[54:14] going for a thousand years in a million
[54:16] but he's saying we're on the road to the
[54:19] great land we're on the road to our
[54:20] millennium we're on the road into the
[54:22] promised land so there they were taking
[54:24] a physical exodus they were leaving
[54:27] egypt behind and if we're in another
[54:29] exodus church that means we're going to
[54:31] find another cadence barney that means
[54:33] god is bringing a people to a pivotal
[54:36] point do you move on with god do you
[54:38] move on with the word or do you stay
[54:40] camped out what i believe do you stay
[54:42] camped out with your sickness do you
[54:44] stay camped out with the things that
[54:46] beset you before or do you pack up your
[54:48] stead steak and move forward say god i'm
[54:50] trusting you i don't know how i'm gonna
[54:52] get through it god but i'm gonna believe
[54:54] anyway god i don't care what's in the
[54:56] land i'm trusting you lord because you
[54:58] gave a promise you gave a word you gave
[55:01] us an exposition to go forth into the
[55:03] land and possess what belongs to you
[55:07] see we got to get to a point in the
[55:08] journey where we have to make a decision
[55:11] trust god and go
[55:13] or listen to the negativity
[55:16] and we find that because of their
[55:18] negative report they discouraged and
[55:19] disillusioned many
[55:21] of the would-be believers
[55:25] and if we listen to the discouragement
[55:27] we listen to the lies we listen to
[55:29] believe the sign and all that filth and
[55:31] garbage
[55:32] what is it does it discourages the
[55:34] believer
[55:35] it disillusions because what is satan
[55:37] trying to he's trying to plant a seed of
[55:40] negativity he's trying to plant a seed
[55:42] of doubt and if you give reason if you
[55:44] give a credence to that doubt that doubt
[55:46] begins to overtake you and you can't see
[55:49] the blessings that's in the promised
[55:50] land
[55:51] program says the greatest sin i find in
[55:54] the church today is unbelief notice not
[55:56] out in the world but the greatest sin
[55:58] that he finds in the church today is
[56:01] unbelief that's the only sin there is
[56:04] there's no other sin but unbelief how
[56:07] much of that is night out there how much
[56:09] is dark you couldn't say this much as
[56:11] dark go out from my hands it's all dark
[56:13] he says now there's only one way to
[56:15] designate and determine sin and that
[56:17] isn't about whether you drink or whether
[56:19] you smoke or whether you gamble is
[56:21] designated this way because you are an
[56:24] unbeliever you do that
[56:27] because you're an unbeliever he said if
[56:29] you was a believer a firm believer those
[56:32] things will be dead and black as the
[56:33] night is before you certainly those
[56:35] things are attributed to unbelief and we
[56:38] find unbelief kept those out of the
[56:41] promised land and unbelief in the church
[56:43] of the living god today will keep us out
[56:46] of the promised land it'll keep the
[56:48] spirit of god from moving it'll hinder
[56:50] every service it'll keep people cramped
[56:52] down and they can't rise up and accept
[56:54] the promises of god we need to get our
[56:56] belief out of our midst and trust god
[56:58] and believe god and serve god and say
[57:01] yes lord your word is james your word is
[57:04] amen your word belongs to me i'll take
[57:07] the land
[57:07] [Applause]
[57:10] see their failure the failure of the
[57:12] children of israel at cadence barnea was
[57:14] due to their unbelief
[57:16] toward god and toward his promise
[57:19] see god is faithful and his word cannot
[57:21] fail
[57:22] but the people neither believe god nor
[57:25] do they believe the promise that's right
[57:28] well i know
[57:29] we all have at some point have the enemy
[57:32] sit on our shoulder and whisper in our
[57:33] ear
[57:35] it's not for you you can't take it
[57:37] you're not good enough you're a nobody a
[57:39] has been never will be
[57:42] right
[57:43] see their unbelief though offended god
[57:47] their unbelief offended god they refused
[57:49] to go up
[57:50] and possess the land and they began to
[57:52] murmur
[57:53] in their houses around the dinner table
[57:56] they begin to murmur in the tents where
[57:59] brothers so and so this and brother
[58:00] seven said that and this sister and that
[58:03] sister and the first thing you know is
[58:05] they killed the
[58:06] influence they killed the influence of
[58:09] the land the land had this and the land
[58:12] had that but because they began to
[58:13] murmur and show all the negativity and
[58:16] all the faults in all the humanity it
[58:18] kept others from wanting to enter into
[58:20] the land
[58:23] it discouraged all the other believers
[58:25] from going into the land
[58:27] and we find those that genuinely don't
[58:29] believe
[58:31] they're the ones that don't fully obey
[58:35] they may dress like a believer
[58:37] they may act like a believer
[58:39] when they're around believers they may
[58:40] talk like a believer but when it comes
[58:42] to the showdown deep in their heart they
[58:45] don't believe
[58:46] there's something that's nagging that
[58:48] them said this is not for you
[58:50] this is not for you and we find
[58:53] they're willing to die out there in
[58:55] their own ideas than to take god at his
[58:58] word
[58:59] they're willing to circle out in the
[59:00] wilderness versus go into the promised
[59:03] land of truth
[59:05] deuteronomy 1 and verse 6 it said the
[59:07] lord our god spake unto us in horrible
[59:10] saying
[59:11] you have dealt long enough
[59:14] in this mount
[59:15] you have dealt here long enough and some
[59:17] of us
[59:18] we have camped down on ideas we have
[59:20] camped down on why we can't do it why we
[59:23] this why aren't we that i believe i can
[59:25] say
[59:26] that we have camped down and we've been
[59:27] at this mountain long enough
[59:30] it's time this mountain of sickness has
[59:32] to leave and we move forward this time
[59:34] this situation it may be unsurmountable
[59:36] it may be a great big mountain in your
[59:37] life but you've been camped there long
[59:39] enough it's time to go forward maybe
[59:41] it's some habit that's keeping you from
[59:43] receiving the holy ghost it's time that
[59:44] you go forward you've camped out there
[59:46] long enough you've
[59:48] you disbelieved the word long enough now
[59:50] it's time to go forward some of you
[59:52] camped down on justification but i want
[59:54] you to know you need to move on into the
[59:56] sanctification and those of you here
[59:58] today that you camped down on
[1:00:00] sanctification you're just good we're
[1:00:01] living a sanctified christian life it's
[1:00:03] time that you move forward into the
[1:00:05] baptism of the holy ghost you move
[1:00:07] forward into the promised land of the
[1:00:09] word and either the things of the lord
[1:00:11] even the greatness of god it's time that
[1:00:13] we pack up we dealt in this mountain
[1:00:15] long enough it's time to move church
[1:00:17] it's time that the church of the living
[1:00:19] god makes its move right now
[1:00:21] [Applause]
[1:00:24] it's time that we take our journey into
[1:00:25] the promised land of the opening of the
[1:00:27] word we're no longer look this message
[1:00:29] is no longer in its infancy
[1:00:32] we're no longer a little baby this
[1:00:34] message has been the pride has come to
[1:00:37] maturity and it's time that we possess
[1:00:39] all that belongs to us we were without
[1:00:42] excuse today
[1:00:44] the word has been opened and we now know
[1:00:46] what he wants done with this bird he's
[1:00:49] looking for somebody brother aaron that
[1:00:51] will believe
[1:00:53] somebody that will believe against all
[1:00:54] the naysayers somebody's gonna take him
[1:00:57] at his word god gave the promise that
[1:00:59] the land is before you and all he's
[1:01:01] looking for is somebody that'll say i'll
[1:01:03] go
[1:01:04] i'll go
[1:01:05] i don't care what they say i don't care
[1:01:07] what they criticize i don't care how i
[1:01:09] have to act i don't care what our
[1:01:11] service looks like i'm willing to go i'm
[1:01:13] willing to trust god i want to let
[1:01:15] myself go and get be influenced by the
[1:01:18] supernatural if it means i speak in
[1:01:20] tongues i'll speak in tongues if it
[1:01:22] means i'll dance in the spirit i'll
[1:01:24] dance in the spirit if it means i'll run
[1:01:26] around the church i'll run around the
[1:01:28] church if it means i'll say amen to the
[1:01:30] word i'll respond back to the word i'm
[1:01:32] ready to go
[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:36] go and occupy the land belongs to you
[1:01:40] the promise belongs to you
[1:01:44] deuteronomy 1 and verse 20 and i said
[1:01:46] unto you you are come unto the mountain
[1:01:48] of the amorites
[1:01:50] which the lord our god does give unto us
[1:01:53] notice it's a promise
[1:01:55] he's given it to you
[1:01:57] behold the lord thy god
[1:01:59] has set the land before thee go up and
[1:02:01] possess it as the lord god of thy
[1:02:04] fathers has said unto thee fear not
[1:02:06] neither be
[1:02:07] discouraged
[1:02:09] see every promise is yeah and amen to
[1:02:12] the believer every promise
[1:02:15] in the book brother brown said belongs
[1:02:17] to the believer now how many is a
[1:02:19] believer this morning
[1:02:20] so every promise belongs to you now you
[1:02:24] search your life you do an inventory of
[1:02:26] your life is there a promise out there
[1:02:29] that's just in reach that you haven't
[1:02:30] attained to yet
[1:02:32] it belongs to you
[1:02:34] make your move
[1:02:37] it's time to make your move
[1:02:39] you can't sit i don't you can't stay
[1:02:41] where you are you're going to die
[1:02:46] bro man says now christ keeps all his
[1:02:48] words he has to he has to do it i don't
[1:02:52] have to do it i'm mortal subject to
[1:02:53] mistakes
[1:02:55] but he is immortal infallible
[1:02:57] he has to keep it but i don't have to
[1:03:00] keep mine you don't have to keep yours
[1:03:02] but he does oh doesn't that place
[1:03:04] something in you to know that he he
[1:03:07] absolutely is or he's absolutely bound
[1:03:10] to that word
[1:03:11] god is absolutely jesus is absolutely
[1:03:14] bound to that word
[1:03:16] and we find here in ephesians 5 and
[1:03:18] verse 27
[1:03:20] that he might present to himself a
[1:03:23] glorious church
[1:03:25] now that's a promise god is going to
[1:03:27] have a bride
[1:03:28] he's going to have a glorious church not
[1:03:30] having a spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:03:32] thing but that it should be holy and
[1:03:34] without blemish
[1:03:36] and then the message is invisible union
[1:03:38] the prophet of god i believe he tapped
[1:03:40] into the mind of god and show you us
[1:03:42] exactly who we are in this hour
[1:03:45] he says you are the pure
[1:03:48] virtuous sinless bride of the son of the
[1:03:50] living god
[1:03:51] every man woman that's born of the
[1:03:53] spirit of god and washed in the blood of
[1:03:56] jesus christ and believes every
[1:03:58] word of god stands as though you never
[1:04:01] sin in the first place you are perfect
[1:04:06] this is a promise given to you oh you
[1:04:08] make wake up in the morning you look in
[1:04:10] the mirror and the first thing you see
[1:04:11] is false first thing you see is failures
[1:04:14] first thing you see is shortcomings but
[1:04:15] god doesn't see your faults he doesn't
[1:04:18] see your shortcoming he doesn't see your
[1:04:20] affairs he says you are the pure
[1:04:22] virtuous sinless bride of the son of the
[1:04:24] living god every man and woman that's
[1:04:27] born of the spirit of god and washed in
[1:04:29] the blood of jesus and believes every
[1:04:32] word of god every word of god you stand
[1:04:35] as though you never sin in the first
[1:04:37] place
[1:04:39] see you're standing completely you never
[1:04:41] seen it the first place god don't even
[1:04:43] know it's in the sea of forgiveness you
[1:04:46] never did it you were accused of it by
[1:04:48] the accuser but really from the
[1:04:50] beginning you were predestinated to be a
[1:04:52] son and daughter of god you're standing
[1:04:55] there washed
[1:04:58] see your old book of divorcement is put
[1:04:59] away it's dead absolutely out of
[1:05:02] existence even in the mind of god you're
[1:05:04] the virtuous bride of christ washed in
[1:05:07] the blood of christ precious virtuous
[1:05:09] sinless son of god standing with a pure
[1:05:13] unadulterated bride word that he's
[1:05:15] washed by the water of his own blood
[1:05:18] that become flesh and manifested that he
[1:05:20] might take you which was predestinated
[1:05:22] in the bosom of the father before the
[1:05:24] beginning the same as he was hope that's
[1:05:27] who we are church that's the promise to
[1:05:29] you this morning oh you're not some
[1:05:30] little sinner you're not some castaway
[1:05:33] you're not some cast down i know you're
[1:05:35] the pure the sinless bride of jesus
[1:05:37] christ that's who you are that's what
[1:05:40] the word claims that's manna leave from
[1:05:42] the heavenly land that's the word from
[1:05:44] the promised land telling you who you
[1:05:46] are not what you want
[1:05:49] see that's the promise to every believer
[1:05:51] that's promised land man you never
[1:05:53] sinned in the first place
[1:05:56] in the first place you were in the mind
[1:05:58] of god in the first place god never seen
[1:06:00] you as a sinner in the first place you
[1:06:02] were a thought of god and god saw you as
[1:06:04] the son
[1:06:06] and a daughter of god you're standing
[1:06:08] the pure unadulterated bright word
[1:06:10] that's who you are that's what god wants
[1:06:12] you to understand this morning and you
[1:06:14] can claim that that's your promise now
[1:06:17] go and take the land
[1:06:21] so but israel made their mistake
[1:06:24] they turned and went into the mountain
[1:06:25] they came to the valley of escort they
[1:06:27] searched it out they took the fruit of
[1:06:29] the land and their hands noticed they
[1:06:31] partook of it
[1:06:33] even like tabernacle we are without
[1:06:34] excuse
[1:06:37] we have seen cancer delivered cancer
[1:06:39] delivered cancer delivered we have seen
[1:06:41] the supernatural we have seen eyes being
[1:06:43] opened we have seen god moving the
[1:06:46] miraculous in this church we have tasted
[1:06:49] of the land we have placed it in our
[1:06:51] hands
[1:06:53] service after service after service we
[1:06:56] have seen the dynamics follow the
[1:06:58] mechanics and produce what the word said
[1:07:00] it would produce
[1:07:03] he says they took of the fruit of the
[1:07:05] land in their hands
[1:07:08] and they brought it down unto us and
[1:07:09] brought us word again and they said it
[1:07:11] is a good land which the lord our god
[1:07:13] doeth give us
[1:07:14] notwithstanding
[1:07:16] you would not go up but rebelled against
[1:07:18] the commandment of the lord notice
[1:07:20] israel made its mistake when it stopped
[1:07:23] israel made its mistake when it stopped
[1:07:26] see if they had went on they would have
[1:07:28] possessed the promised land right there
[1:07:30] for god gave them the promise he's good
[1:07:32] to his promise if they had gone on over
[1:07:34] but they stopped marching and notice he
[1:07:36] said when they stop or when they stopped
[1:07:39] marching they started wandering
[1:07:43] now you're at a cadis
[1:07:45] you can keep marching or you can start
[1:07:47] wondering
[1:07:49] see when you stop moving forward
[1:07:51] in this present truth
[1:07:53] you start wondering
[1:07:55] is it for me
[1:07:57] is it for my family have my kids gone
[1:07:59] too far have they sent away their day of
[1:08:01] grace i got all these faults you begin
[1:08:03] to complain we begin to murmur we're
[1:08:05] thinking to find what so and so did this
[1:08:07] and so and so it said that you know the
[1:08:09] problem church is not so and so the
[1:08:11] problem is you stop short of the promise
[1:08:15] you find people you've been around
[1:08:16] people we all have it seems like every
[1:08:18] time you get around they're talking
[1:08:20] about a problem they're talking about
[1:08:21] this they're talking about that and they
[1:08:23] fail to do a deep dive into their own
[1:08:24] self and realize there's a common
[1:08:26] denominator and all this in the common
[1:08:28] denominator it's me
[1:08:29] it's because i stop short of the promise
[1:08:31] because if you keep walking into the
[1:08:33] promised land you're not looking at this
[1:08:35] and you're not looking at that you're
[1:08:36] tasting you're feasting on the grapes
[1:08:38] you're feasting on the heavenly manna
[1:08:40] you're not worried about what this one
[1:08:41] said or how that one acted no you've got
[1:08:44] the land in your hands and you're a
[1:08:45] potato of the heavenly promise
[1:08:49] we wonder about this and we wonder about
[1:08:51] that is this right and that's right what
[1:08:53] about the cloud was it really a rocket
[1:08:55] or was it the head of christ what about
[1:08:57] the bridge how many fell you know we
[1:08:58] were we're wondering about the humanity
[1:09:00] of a prophet not allowing him to be a
[1:09:02] human are you making him infallibly
[1:09:04] wonder about is the holy ghost for us
[1:09:05] can i be healed have i gone too far can
[1:09:08] i even enter into the land is there
[1:09:09] enough time for my children to come back
[1:09:11] see the promised land is unto you
[1:09:14] unto your children
[1:09:16] unto them that are far off
[1:09:19] those that ain't even looking to come to
[1:09:21] church those that ain't been looking for
[1:09:22] god the promise is still unto them
[1:09:24] because the promise pertains to you you
[1:09:27] got sons you got daughters out there in
[1:09:29] the wilderness wasteland you keep
[1:09:31] believing you keep trusting because the
[1:09:33] promise is yours the promise is unto
[1:09:36] them that are far off not even looking
[1:09:38] for god god's able to reach down and get
[1:09:40] them
[1:09:42] keep believing until you see it
[1:09:44] manifested
[1:09:47] notice what they said in numbers 13
[1:09:50] verse 27
[1:09:54] and they told him and they said we came
[1:09:57] unto the land whether thou sentenced us
[1:09:59] and surely
[1:10:00] surely it floweth with milk and honey
[1:10:03] and here this is the fruit of it
[1:10:07] could you imagine
[1:10:10] you come before a prophet
[1:10:12] he sent you down into the land and you
[1:10:14] come back bearing fruit
[1:10:19] the pet scan
[1:10:21] two months before showed cancer
[1:10:24] two minutes after after you visit the
[1:10:25] promised land for 40 days there's no
[1:10:27] cancer
[1:10:29] and then you refuse to go in
[1:10:31] you refuse to tell people god's a healer
[1:10:34] god still does miraculous god still
[1:10:36] saves
[1:10:38] because you're worried all the days and
[1:10:39] miracles has passed let the naysayers
[1:10:41] say what they
[1:10:42] want we got the promised land in our
[1:10:45] hands
[1:10:46] see nevertheless the people notice the
[1:10:48] people be strong that dwell in the land
[1:10:51] the cities are wall they're very great
[1:10:53] and moreover we saw the children of anak
[1:10:55] there and the amalekites rather than the
[1:10:57] land of the south and the hittites and
[1:10:59] the jebusites and the amorites dwell in
[1:11:01] the mountains and the canaanites dwell
[1:11:03] by the sea and the coasts of jordan
[1:11:05] notice these
[1:11:08] 10 of the 12 spies came back
[1:11:10] and all of them had evidences
[1:11:13] they were non-believers
[1:11:15] to this point
[1:11:16] but they went into the land and they
[1:11:18] come back
[1:11:20] with fruits
[1:11:21] the evidence all over their life they
[1:11:24] were probably wiping grape juice off of
[1:11:25] them they had the evidence it was all
[1:11:27] over them they've been in the promised
[1:11:29] land but notice they walked through the
[1:11:32] land they explored every inch of the
[1:11:34] promised land their eyes witnessed the
[1:11:36] amazing amazing things of the land the
[1:11:38] beauty in which it be held they tasted
[1:11:40] of all that it had to offer they said it
[1:11:42] was a land that flowed with milk and
[1:11:44] honey and milk and honey depicts
[1:11:46] fertility of the soul productive in a
[1:11:49] prosperous land a land that was rich in
[1:11:51] natural resources that you could
[1:11:53] cultivate and produce in the oriental
[1:11:55] the milk and honey represented food for
[1:11:57] the gods and we find this land here they
[1:11:59] come back they said this land is only
[1:12:01] fit for god and what am i telling you
[1:12:03] church i'm telling you this is your land
[1:12:05] you are sons and daughters of the most
[1:12:07] high god he will call you messiah that's
[1:12:10] where we're going it's the land only fit
[1:12:12] for god not for unbelievers and we're
[1:12:15] not unbelievers but we're believers this
[1:12:17] morning and the land belongs to you but
[1:12:19] you got to take your time you got to
[1:12:21] make your move and enter into that later
[1:12:23] possess everything
[1:12:25] but notice they went in for 40 days
[1:12:28] and explored the promise
[1:12:31] man they've seen cancer healed they've
[1:12:33] seen the supernatural man they seen one
[1:12:35] event after another event they had
[1:12:37] speaking in tongues they had all kind of
[1:12:39] supernatural experiences in the land
[1:12:42] but when they came back
[1:12:46] there's giants in the
[1:12:48] land we can't take it
[1:12:52] we can't take it it's not for us
[1:12:54] there's the sons of
[1:12:56] of anakin are there and the jebusites
[1:12:58] and this one there the people they're
[1:13:00] strong in the land the cities are walled
[1:13:02] up
[1:13:04] every excuse
[1:13:06] they could come up with to not occupy
[1:13:08] the land
[1:13:10] every excuse
[1:13:12] see it's like the devil to bring a
[1:13:13] negative report to scare you
[1:13:15] from going beyond the negativity and
[1:13:17] reaching into the promise
[1:13:19] you know i love how brother man would
[1:13:21] say and he would say the devil is
[1:13:22] nothing but a scarecrow
[1:13:25] he just scares you into something he has
[1:13:28] no legal rights at all he was stripped
[1:13:30] of every right principality
[1:13:33] he spoiled everything when he died at
[1:13:35] calvary he said there was a man that
[1:13:37] lived down here who really loved birds
[1:13:44] i'm not sure what's going on here on the
[1:13:46] platform but something is
[1:13:50] not right
[1:13:53] okay
[1:13:55] there was a man that lived down here and
[1:13:56] he really loved birds and he had a wild
[1:13:58] strawberry patch and he wouldn't let
[1:14:01] nobody bother
[1:14:02] he kept that for the birds he went to
[1:14:04] florida one year he didn't come back in
[1:14:06] time and some fella wanted to pick them
[1:14:08] barry so he he put a big old scarecrow
[1:14:10] out in the field like that notice
[1:14:12] somebody came into his land and erected
[1:14:15] a scarecrow
[1:14:16] because he wanted the berries for
[1:14:17] himself he wanted what was in that
[1:14:19] promised land for himself he says now
[1:14:22] he said well all these birds are making
[1:14:23] their habit of coming every year they
[1:14:25] come and they found this great big patch
[1:14:27] and it had this scarecrow in it and some
[1:14:28] of them were just sitting way up in the
[1:14:30] trees some of the telephone wires some
[1:14:32] on the poles and some were just
[1:14:34] squawking and carrying on about it why
[1:14:36] is this scarecrow there we can't get in
[1:14:38] there we used to come here time and time
[1:14:40] and we used to go and we used to eat
[1:14:42] these strawberries but now we can't go
[1:14:44] in there's a big scarecrow he goes well
[1:14:46] i thought that was amazing but somehow
[1:14:48] right in the middle of the patch setting
[1:14:50] right there the arm of the scarecrow
[1:14:52] said two big crows just eating till
[1:14:54] their belly was full and they was hard
[1:14:56] as they could go two big scarecrows
[1:14:58] wasn't worried about with a staircar two
[1:15:00] big crows they wasn't worried about the
[1:15:02] scarecrow they knew what was beyond the
[1:15:04] scarecrow what am i telling you church
[1:15:06] satan is there to put scarecrow after
[1:15:08] scrackle in your life but just go beyond
[1:15:10] the scarecrow we have tasted up the
[1:15:13] evidence we have tasted on the land we
[1:15:15] know that it belongs to us we've been
[1:15:17] here once before we've been here before
[1:15:19] now go beyond the scarecrow
[1:15:22] go beyond the things that you see the
[1:15:24] things that you feel the things that the
[1:15:26] little awkward moments in your life and
[1:15:27] move into the blessed promised land
[1:15:32] they come to the borderland
[1:15:34] cadis barnea
[1:15:36] but they make a great mistake
[1:15:41] notice they made a great mistake
[1:15:43] we can't take it
[1:15:46] they're three days journey from enter
[1:15:48] and in
[1:15:50] three days
[1:15:51] three days journey
[1:15:53] from the blessed promised land
[1:15:55] all the trouble
[1:15:57] all the tolls of life all the hardships
[1:16:00] all the fear of pharaoh all that behind
[1:16:02] them
[1:16:03] three days journey from moving in
[1:16:07] and here they were they go in and they
[1:16:09] said
[1:16:11] there's grass we're grasshoppers
[1:16:13] so they looked at their circumstances
[1:16:15] instead of looking at the promise
[1:16:18] they looked at the walled cities instead
[1:16:19] of looking at the promise
[1:16:22] they look at what we're not able to do
[1:16:23] in our humanity instead of looking at
[1:16:25] the one who gave the promise
[1:16:27] see we've been taught by this message
[1:16:29] though not to look at circumstances
[1:16:30] we've been taught to look at the word in
[1:16:32] the word only we've been taught to
[1:16:34] believe the promises of god and so many
[1:16:36] believers continue
[1:16:38] to look at the giants
[1:16:41] so many believers today continue to look
[1:16:44] at the giants and allow the scarecrows
[1:16:46] from keep you from living a victorious
[1:16:48] life
[1:16:49] scarecrows are complexes
[1:16:52] scarecrows of depression
[1:16:53] scarecrows of fear
[1:16:55] scarecrows of unbelief scarecrows of
[1:16:58] sickness that you're never going to get
[1:16:59] well to keep you from feasting within
[1:17:01] the land
[1:17:03] see because they lack faith all the
[1:17:05] spies except caleb and joshua were
[1:17:07] discouraged
[1:17:08] and we find many preachers and many
[1:17:10] pastors today they don't want prayer
[1:17:11] lines
[1:17:14] they don't want prayer lines they don't
[1:17:15] want to move another spirit in their
[1:17:16] church
[1:17:17] though they've been in and received and
[1:17:20] testified of the promised land
[1:17:23] well they've been in there and they've
[1:17:24] seen the tongues of
[1:17:25] the real initial tongues they've
[1:17:27] received a genuine tongues they've seen
[1:17:30] the miraculous take place they've seen a
[1:17:33] real dance
[1:17:35] they've seen
[1:17:36] a real movement of the spirit but when
[1:17:38] they come back they don't want their
[1:17:39] churches to have that
[1:17:42] they don't want their churches to be
[1:17:43] labeled pentecostal
[1:17:45] though they were willing and they
[1:17:46] enjoyed their time in pentecost in the
[1:17:48] promised land
[1:17:50] but because everybody else was nay
[1:17:52] saying this and you know we got to get
[1:17:54] away from pentecost and we're not going
[1:17:55] back to azusa pentecost but in order to
[1:17:57] go into the promised land we got to go
[1:17:59] back to the original
[1:18:01] we got to go back because look this book
[1:18:02] of acts is going to produce the same
[1:18:04] book of acts it's going to produce the
[1:18:05] same signs the same wonders this branch
[1:18:07] ever puts forth another branch it's
[1:18:09] going to be exactly like the first
[1:18:10] branch
[1:18:13] but see their doubt had turned to
[1:18:14] unbelief and their unbelief
[1:18:16] caused them to rebel against god
[1:18:20] see their doubt turned to unbelief
[1:18:22] and their unbelief caused him to rebel
[1:18:28] numbers 13 and verse 27 we came unto the
[1:18:30] lamb whether thou sent us notice how
[1:18:31] they interpret this
[1:18:34] we came into the land whether thou sent
[1:18:36] us
[1:18:37] not
[1:18:38] the land the lord our god is giving us
[1:18:41] see they didn't take possession of the
[1:18:43] promise
[1:18:44] lord you're sending us here but not this
[1:18:47] is the land that god is giving us
[1:18:50] and i want you to know church god has
[1:18:51] given us a great land god has given us a
[1:18:55] tremendous land this is not a land that
[1:18:57] that we're just to go into that he sent
[1:18:59] us out to explore no he's given us this
[1:19:01] land and yet when they got there they
[1:19:03] saw grasshop or they saw josh and they
[1:19:05] they saw themselves as grasshoppers and
[1:19:07] they looked at the obstacles they looked
[1:19:08] at the giants they looked at the walled
[1:19:10] cities they allowed everything that they
[1:19:11] saw with their flesh to influence their
[1:19:14] perception of the land
[1:19:16] they looked at the people they looked at
[1:19:18] all these things and i wonder how many
[1:19:20] times we look at the circumstances
[1:19:24] it's not for me
[1:19:25] how many devils ever told you that it's
[1:19:27] not for you
[1:19:30] see their eyes were on the obstacles on
[1:19:32] the giants on the walled cities and
[1:19:34] their eyes wasn't on the promise
[1:19:37] and they allow what they saw in their
[1:19:38] flesh to influence their perception
[1:19:41] i wonder you know and we think about
[1:19:43] this
[1:19:45] we only see how big our situation is a
[1:19:48] lot of times we only see how difficult
[1:19:50] our trial is because we're human
[1:19:52] and that's what we can relate to
[1:19:56] but church we got to realize how big our
[1:19:58] god is
[1:19:59] we got to realize who made us the
[1:20:01] promise
[1:20:03] he made us the promise
[1:20:05] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:20:07] not even cancer
[1:20:11] see if they would only looked at god by
[1:20:13] faith they would have seen the one that
[1:20:15] made the promise
[1:20:16] they would have been another caleb and
[1:20:18] another josh would have been 12 caleb's
[1:20:19] and 12 joshuas versus 10 and 2.
[1:20:23] but we find back their crowd of unbelief
[1:20:25] had such an influence and a sway over
[1:20:27] the people that the entire congregation
[1:20:29] began to withdraw themselves from the
[1:20:30] promise they were excited at one point
[1:20:33] man they've seen the miraculous they've
[1:20:35] seen the the evidence of the land they
[1:20:36] were willing to go but as they heard all
[1:20:38] the negativity and all the the bad
[1:20:40] report they were willing to settle to
[1:20:42] live on the outskirts of the promise
[1:20:45] and never obtained and never occupy than
[1:20:48] to go in and possess the land for
[1:20:49] themselves
[1:20:51] they were willing to live on the
[1:20:53] outskirts of the promise
[1:20:55] just so far looking over
[1:20:58] just so far looking over looking over to
[1:21:00] somebody else's house that has victory
[1:21:02] looking over in somebody else's house
[1:21:04] that their children are serving the lord
[1:21:06] looking over in somebody else's house
[1:21:07] that where they got true divine healing
[1:21:10] and miracles taking place they were
[1:21:11] willing to sit back on the outskirts
[1:21:14] and look what god is doing
[1:21:17] versus partaking of it themselves
[1:21:20] they resolve themselves just to be
[1:21:22] wilderness wonders
[1:21:24] rather than possessors of the promise
[1:21:27] and i hope i'm speaking to possessors of
[1:21:29] the promise this morning
[1:21:31] not wilderness wonders see we're not a
[1:21:33] people that are to pull back from the
[1:21:34] promise god gave us a promise and he
[1:21:36] said heavens and earth will pass away
[1:21:38] before his word will pass away and we
[1:21:40] know that the word of god will not
[1:21:41] return boy so we need to train our
[1:21:43] attention to look away from our
[1:21:44] obstacles look away from the situations
[1:21:47] and the hard trials and look to the word
[1:21:49] of god look to the one who gave the
[1:21:51] promise to us as believers see our
[1:21:53] unbelief will always see the obstacles
[1:21:55] you can always count on that your
[1:21:57] unbelief will see the obstacles your
[1:21:59] unbelief will see the challenges your
[1:22:00] unbelief will say we are not able i
[1:22:03] can't measure up
[1:22:05] but faith will always see the
[1:22:06] opportunity
[1:22:08] your faith in the promised world will
[1:22:10] place you into the land of promise
[1:22:13] and we find here in philippians 4 and
[1:22:16] verse 13 the bible says i can do all
[1:22:17] things through christ
[1:22:19] see that's faith that's not unbelief
[1:22:21] unbelief says you can't measure up
[1:22:23] unbelief says we can't take the land but
[1:22:24] we find faith says i can do all things i
[1:22:27] can do whatever the lord tells me that i
[1:22:29] can do and we find notice moses here in
[1:22:32] numbers 13 and verse 1 the lord spoke to
[1:22:34] him they said moses pick you some men
[1:22:36] and send them over into the lamb and
[1:22:38] moses picks every he picks a ruler among
[1:22:41] them notice he picks a special man out
[1:22:43] of every tribe and this man wasn't just
[1:22:46] men they wasn't just some fly by light
[1:22:48] but they were preachers moses
[1:22:50] hand-picked certain preachers to go into
[1:22:52] the land and tell them how good the land
[1:22:54] is and these preachers got down there
[1:22:56] and they enjoyed the benefits of the
[1:22:58] land they enjoyed the supernatural
[1:23:00] presence of the land but when it came
[1:23:02] back to influence earth to influence
[1:23:04] their churches they said it's not for us
[1:23:08] we don't want to be labeled pentecost
[1:23:10] it's all emotion it's all work
[1:23:14] we're okay with our psychology we're
[1:23:16] okay with our intellectual doctrine we
[1:23:17] got the message and that's all
[1:23:19] we got the mechanics
[1:23:23] church if we're not careful
[1:23:25] that's where every message church is
[1:23:27] headed
[1:23:28] oh we got the message and absolutely
[1:23:30] right we got it we got the
[1:23:32] evidence we've got to have more than
[1:23:34] just the evidence we've got to have the
[1:23:36] land
[1:23:38] don't settle for just the evidence
[1:23:43] notice brother brown would say when they
[1:23:44] got to cades the judgment seat
[1:23:47] then the testing time come so i want you
[1:23:49] to notice after the great miracles and
[1:23:51] things that were ready to go over and
[1:23:53] possess the land and the testing time
[1:23:55] come they were afraid to go and i think
[1:23:57] brethren today that's what the matter
[1:23:59] with the church is at the end of the
[1:24:00] great doctors
[1:24:02] and the theology i think the testing
[1:24:04] time for the church he goes i think it's
[1:24:06] a testing time for the church i wonder
[1:24:08] how many
[1:24:09] see the great miracles that are done
[1:24:10] here at even like tabernacle
[1:24:12] how many witness the living god
[1:24:14] manifesting here in our church how many
[1:24:16] look and they desire the freedom of
[1:24:18] worship that we have here but when it
[1:24:20] comes time to say let's go
[1:24:22] we can do this they pull back we don't
[1:24:25] want that in our church
[1:24:27] well they they like it they like what
[1:24:30] they see or maybe even someone will say
[1:24:31] well you know what that's just emotion
[1:24:33] or that's just work of them young kids
[1:24:35] they need to have some church order
[1:24:40] obama says now he says and just before
[1:24:42] going in they sent 12 spies that come
[1:24:44] back and when they did 10 of the spies
[1:24:46] oh it's a good land the 12 said it's
[1:24:48] good said it had a bunch of grapes cut
[1:24:50] down that two of them in packed and
[1:24:52] there it's a land flowing with milk and
[1:24:53] honey he goes i imagine that it was a
[1:24:55] pretty good bait don't you milk and
[1:24:57] honey
[1:24:59] that would make a good pentecostal
[1:25:00] cocktail
[1:25:04] he goes
[1:25:05] wine milk honey all stirred together man
[1:25:09] talk about vitamins that's more than a
[1:25:11] drugstore ever did have
[1:25:13] oh what's wrong with a pentecostal
[1:25:15] cocktail
[1:25:17] no today we got dead churches
[1:25:20] we've got dead preachers
[1:25:22] we've got churches that don't got no
[1:25:23] young people because there ain't no
[1:25:24] preaching to inspire them there's
[1:25:26] nothing there they went into the land
[1:25:28] they know that the land they know that
[1:25:29] the land of the message is good they
[1:25:31] know that it can produce the results but
[1:25:33] they're afraid to let the land be to be
[1:25:35] manifested in their church
[1:25:38] he says now notice he said it's flowing
[1:25:40] with milk and honey ten of them's oh but
[1:25:42] brethren we can't do it it's all walled
[1:25:45] up it's impossible the denominations are
[1:25:47] too high i'm telling you just because he
[1:25:50] goes down but one little old fella
[1:25:52] knowed what it was talking about two of
[1:25:54] them caleb and joshua he says we can
[1:25:56] take it that's what it is today they
[1:25:58] said can we have an interdomination or
[1:26:01] old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost
[1:26:03] filled with arrival he says certainly we
[1:26:05] can can we have divine healing certainly
[1:26:08] we can can we have divine healing in the
[1:26:10] presbyterian in the methodist in the
[1:26:12] lutheran in the baptist churches let me
[1:26:14] say can we have it in the masses
[1:26:15] churches
[1:26:16] can we have he said certainly we can god
[1:26:19] said so he said them man was looking at
[1:26:21] the circumstances caleb and joshua was
[1:26:23] looking at the word that made the
[1:26:24] difference
[1:26:28] he said these spies were looking at the
[1:26:29] conditions what the price they had to
[1:26:31] pay but caleb and joshua was looking at
[1:26:33] the promise of god and
[1:26:35] what god had given him go and possess
[1:26:37] the land
[1:26:38] see the the holy ghost is for whosoever
[1:26:41] is called to the wedding supper and i
[1:26:42] trust this morning that you've been
[1:26:44] called he goes i don't care what the
[1:26:45] price you got to pay he says go get it
[1:26:48] god says it's yours if you don't get it
[1:26:50] then he's going to ask you why
[1:26:54] if you don't get it he's going to ask
[1:26:56] you why why didn't you get it why it was
[1:26:59] there for you
[1:27:01] see if they didn't possess the land
[1:27:03] there's too many against us he said he
[1:27:05] said well if god said i'm for you then
[1:27:07] who can be against you what's the matter
[1:27:09] there's something wrong with the
[1:27:11] individual not the church there's
[1:27:13] nothing wrong with the promised land
[1:27:15] there's nothing wrong with the evidence
[1:27:16] there's something wrong with the
[1:27:18] individual why didn't you get it yes
[1:27:22] so if god be forced and who can be
[1:27:24] against it but we find borderline
[1:27:26] believers
[1:27:27] they come right up to the border and
[1:27:29] they see the supernatural they witness
[1:27:32] and testify the greatness of god and
[1:27:34] they sit there
[1:27:35] and they refuse to go in
[1:27:37] brother brown would tell it like this in
[1:27:39] the message why in phoenix he said then
[1:27:41] when he brought when he talked about a
[1:27:43] borderline believer when he brought
[1:27:44] right up to the borderline sit right in
[1:27:46] the meetings and watch the working of
[1:27:48] the holy spirit see others get healed
[1:27:50] hear them speak with tongues and see
[1:27:52] signs and wonders done they'll sit
[1:27:54] around and watch it but afraid to put
[1:27:56] their hand on it
[1:27:58] they'll sit around and watch it but
[1:28:00] they're afraid to put their hands on it
[1:28:03] he said that's a whole lot like today
[1:28:04] that's what the matter with many of the
[1:28:06] churches they've taken their carnal
[1:28:07] intellectual route and being cut off
[1:28:09] from the supplies of god's blessing and
[1:28:11] healing and power in the baptism of the
[1:28:13] holy ghost and they have took to the
[1:28:15] desert route
[1:28:17] therefore we have argument
[1:28:19] we have fusses we have stews we have
[1:28:21] complaints but those who are still
[1:28:23] remaining in the way it's joy
[1:28:24] unspeakable full of glory with god with
[1:28:27] the pillar of fire over them with power
[1:28:28] with joy with the signs and wonders how
[1:28:30] the real born-again church is moving on
[1:28:32] into the promised land the promise of
[1:28:34] eternal life a land flowing with eternal
[1:28:37] life he says where there's no sickness
[1:28:39] no death no sorrow nor nothing to harm
[1:28:42] that's where we're headed church
[1:28:44] let's keep our eyes on the promise but
[1:28:46] he says when the carnal minds begin to
[1:28:48] come among them and finally drove them
[1:28:50] off the main path into the desert he
[1:28:52] said they made their fatal mistake when
[1:28:54] they failed to go on
[1:28:57] and many people have failed to move on
[1:28:58] into the promises of god's word
[1:29:02] they failed three days journey
[1:29:05] so close
[1:29:06] but yet because of unbelief they were so
[1:29:08] far away
[1:29:10] in church we're so close
[1:29:13] we're so close don't let unbelief keep
[1:29:16] you from enter into that land
[1:29:18] see when they got there they camped
[1:29:21] god have been good to them showed them
[1:29:22] how great and wonderful signs he'd done
[1:29:24] in egypt on their journey he had
[1:29:25] prepared everything for them but when
[1:29:27] they got to kadesh barnea
[1:29:29] they resolved to settle down right there
[1:29:32] and refused to move forward
[1:29:34] they came back with heavens they cut
[1:29:35] down branches they cut down clusters of
[1:29:37] grapes but when they came back they
[1:29:38] brought the great big clusters brother
[1:29:39] brown said he said they all gathered
[1:29:41] before the congregation the lord they
[1:29:42] brought the report and god had told them
[1:29:44] of the truth that the lamb is flowing
[1:29:46] with milk and honey it's a good land
[1:29:48] it's a land of seed it's to grow it'll
[1:29:50] grow anything it's a wonderful place
[1:29:52] we've got plenty of water rivers
[1:29:53] irrigations everything to make the the
[1:29:55] great nation but
[1:29:59] but there's amorites there's hittites
[1:30:01] there's other things there and some of
[1:30:03] them are giants and we are as
[1:30:04] grasshoppers
[1:30:08] see but two of them
[1:30:10] two of them said we're able
[1:30:12] two of them said we're able
[1:30:15] we're able to take the land
[1:30:17] we're able to possess the land we're
[1:30:20] more than able we're well able to do it
[1:30:22] and brother baby said it all depends on
[1:30:24] what you're looking at
[1:30:26] this morning churches all depends on
[1:30:28] what we're looking at if you're looking
[1:30:30] at your affliction you'll never go any
[1:30:31] further
[1:30:32] but if you're looking at the promise you
[1:30:33] can be healed and delivered
[1:30:35] see if you look at the promise of god
[1:30:37] you've got it right to every redemptive
[1:30:39] blessing that god promised in his word
[1:30:41] the christian always looks to the unseen
[1:30:43] every redemptive blessing
[1:30:46] belongs to the believer
[1:30:49] but you have to fight for every inch
[1:30:52] you have to fight for every inch
[1:30:55] i remember when i first became a
[1:30:56] christian you had to fight for every
[1:30:57] inch but you know now as a believer you
[1:30:59] have to fight to keep every inch that
[1:31:00] you gain
[1:31:03] see god's given every sick person in
[1:31:05] here divine healing every one of you
[1:31:06] jesus was rooting for our transgressions
[1:31:09] with your stripes we were healed it's
[1:31:10] yours but you'll have to fight for every
[1:31:12] inch you possess everywhere the soles of
[1:31:15] your feet travel god told joshua i've
[1:31:17] given it to you
[1:31:20] footsteps means possession let's move in
[1:31:22] tonight he said let's go on footprints
[1:31:24] is possession let's take every inch of
[1:31:26] ground that god gave us if you haven't
[1:31:28] got the of the holy ghost peter said the
[1:31:30] promise is unto you to your children to
[1:31:32] them that are far off even as many as
[1:31:34] the lord our god shall call
[1:31:36] the works that i do he said you're going
[1:31:38] to do also that's a promise that's in
[1:31:40] the promised land
[1:31:42] let's possess it let's let's god's
[1:31:44] promise be made manifest don't look at
[1:31:45] the circumstances don't look how hard it
[1:31:47] is let's look at the promised land and
[1:31:49] let's possess what belongs to us see
[1:31:52] joshua fought for every inch
[1:31:54] and he says whether there's giants
[1:31:56] whether there's atheists prom he says
[1:31:58] whether it's infidels whether there's
[1:31:59] cold formal churches what different does
[1:32:01] it make god give the promise let's take
[1:32:04] it it's ours it belongs to us it's our
[1:32:06] possession let's go get it don't be
[1:32:08] afraid
[1:32:11] so you got to fight for avery inch
[1:32:12] church
[1:32:13] it ain't going to come we're not in a
[1:32:15] flowery bed of ease
[1:32:16] when others fought to win the prize who
[1:32:18] sail through bloody seas we got to fight
[1:32:20] if we should reign increase our courage
[1:32:22] lord strengthen us lord god's promises
[1:32:25] are true nothing can stop them and
[1:32:26] they're god's promises he give the
[1:32:28] promise to every believer that's here
[1:32:30] this morning
[1:32:32] now you must occupy
[1:32:34] you must take possession but the man
[1:32:36] says now he says i can't tell you how
[1:32:38] divine healing works
[1:32:40] i can't tell you how a black cow can eat
[1:32:42] green grass and give white milk but i'll
[1:32:45] drink it anyhow
[1:32:47] i can't tell you how divine healing
[1:32:49] works i don't know the form of it but
[1:32:51] i've tasted it
[1:32:53] i've witnessed
[1:32:54] we've seen it here in our own church
[1:32:57] i know it's part of the promised land i
[1:32:58] know it's results i know it's it's for
[1:33:00] me and i may not be able to produce it
[1:33:02] in my own life but i'm not going to
[1:33:03] stand before anybody else that can i'm
[1:33:05] not going to i may not have the faith to
[1:33:07] believe but i'll tell you what i'm not
[1:33:08] going to stand in somebody else's way
[1:33:10] that does have the faith to believe but
[1:33:12] see they made their mistake when they
[1:33:13] begin to murmur and complain
[1:33:16] and i say let them murmur and criticize
[1:33:18] our worship
[1:33:20] let them make fun of us and say what
[1:33:21] they will
[1:33:23] we're only rejoicing about the evidence
[1:33:28] oh if they know what we know
[1:33:30] they knew how good those grapes tasted
[1:33:33] they knew how good it was to believe for
[1:33:35] the promise they knew how good it was to
[1:33:37] be
[1:33:38] miraculously healed see we're just
[1:33:40] rejoicing about the evidence in the land
[1:33:42] we're not focused on all the obstacles
[1:33:44] we're not concerned about the giants
[1:33:45] we're not concerned about how high the
[1:33:46] walled cities are our focus is on that
[1:33:49] the land belongs to us and i'm going
[1:33:51] after it
[1:33:52] see there's healing in the land there's
[1:33:54] deliverance there's miracles there's joy
[1:33:55] there's peace he said but the carnality
[1:33:58] had cut their spiritual supply off
[1:34:00] carnality had cut off their joy and they
[1:34:02] began murmuring and fussing and they
[1:34:04] took them off in the desert
[1:34:06] so there is a principle right here you
[1:34:08] go and you start murmuring you start
[1:34:10] complaining and you start murmuring
[1:34:11] it'll cut your spiritual supply right
[1:34:13] off
[1:34:14] you won't move past that point
[1:34:18] so be careful what you murmur about
[1:34:20] be careful what you complain about be
[1:34:22] careful how you criticize the ministry
[1:34:25] furthermore refuse don't criticize the
[1:34:28] ministry
[1:34:29] we're human just as much as you're human
[1:34:32] there's not one of us that's perfect he
[1:34:34] walked 2 000 years ago and made a way
[1:34:36] for us who are unperfect to be made
[1:34:38] perfect through his blood
[1:34:41] see they left the garlic pots of egypt
[1:34:43] eating angels food they crossed through
[1:34:44] the red sea and yet they get to a place
[1:34:46] where they're three days away and they
[1:34:48] complain
[1:34:50] i gotta go to church again
[1:34:54] i mean really didn't we just hear
[1:34:56] brother joe wednesday night we just
[1:34:57] heard them last sunday we got to go
[1:34:59] through this rigmarole all over again
[1:35:03] begin to murmur but we've seen the
[1:35:05] presence of god the evidence begin to
[1:35:07] flow through our young people begin to
[1:35:09] flow through the older people we've seen
[1:35:11] the fruit of the land we're tasting on
[1:35:13] it nobody can tell us that it's not real
[1:35:17] nobody can tell us that it's not for us
[1:35:21] but see we've been around here 40
[1:35:23] 40 years brother graham said 40 years is
[1:35:25] up
[1:35:26] they stayed on that mountain 40 years we
[1:35:28] stayed in our denomination 40 years
[1:35:30] fussing this way in that way do you ever
[1:35:32] think them people done he goes did you
[1:35:35] ever think what them people done out
[1:35:37] there for 40 years
[1:35:39] 40 years they wandered around the
[1:35:41] mountain looking at the promise
[1:35:44] that was for you
[1:35:46] that was for you that was for you 40
[1:35:49] years they wandered until the old
[1:35:51] fighters had to die off
[1:35:54] those ones that said we can't take it
[1:35:56] it's not for us
[1:35:58] oh they want to fight with this group
[1:35:59] and they want to fight with that group
[1:36:00] and they want to fight with this group
[1:36:01] and they want to fight well you can't
[1:36:02] listen to you know if you don't listen
[1:36:04] to my tapes you're not going to make it
[1:36:05] they just keep fighting here and they
[1:36:07] keep fighting there or you got to push
[1:36:08] play and we just keep fighting here and
[1:36:10] we just keep fighting there all the old
[1:36:12] fighters has got to die off
[1:36:14] and brother brown said there's a new
[1:36:15] generation being raised up the entire
[1:36:17] time
[1:36:18] he goes oh but the end of the 40 years
[1:36:20] is up brother he said there's a new
[1:36:22] generation being raised that's right
[1:36:24] there was a joshua raised up one day he
[1:36:26] absolutely believed the word every bit
[1:36:29] of the promise he says now he says this
[1:36:31] new this new group they wasn't fighters
[1:36:34] he goes he let all the old fighters drop
[1:36:36] when the old fighters died off he took
[1:36:38] the sons raised them up among joshua and
[1:36:40] sent them over into the full promise and
[1:36:42] i believe that's where we're seeing
[1:36:44] today we're seeing not old fighters
[1:36:46] anymore we're not seeing sons being
[1:36:48] grafted down and they're taking the
[1:36:50] mantle from their pastor or their mantle
[1:36:52] from their dad and they just continue to
[1:36:53] want to fight with this group and fight
[1:36:55] with that group we're talking about a
[1:36:56] new generation that's looking at the
[1:36:58] land it's time that we possess the
[1:37:00] promised land it's time we put our
[1:37:02] shields and us and our scammers and move
[1:37:05] to the promises of the word of god quit
[1:37:07] fighting with one another great fighting
[1:37:09] with the churches and let's move into
[1:37:11] the promises of god
[1:37:14] let's move upward he says let's get off
[1:37:16] this mountain move up into the promised
[1:37:17] land let's start going up possess the
[1:37:19] land god told them go and possess it and
[1:37:22] all the old fighters is gone now
[1:37:25] they're dying off one by one
[1:37:27] one by one put your sword back in this
[1:37:29] sheath and don't fight
[1:37:31] he says listen man don't make the same
[1:37:33] mistake your fathers did
[1:37:35] or you'll be here for 40 years
[1:37:38] how many years
[1:37:39] have we been circling around this
[1:37:40] mountain after the prophet went off the
[1:37:42] scene for some 50 60 years
[1:37:45] waiting to go into the land but we're on
[1:37:48] our road
[1:37:50] we're on our road
[1:37:51] and notice
[1:37:53] he says now don't go over by mount sir
[1:37:56] he says don't bother him don't fuss at
[1:37:58] him just pass him on by
[1:38:01] he goes how do you do brother walk right
[1:38:03] on by you've been you've been wanting to
[1:38:04] get to him and shake him and tell him
[1:38:06] that he hasn't he ain't got nothing he
[1:38:08] said that's esau mount syria belongs to
[1:38:10] esau he said don't go over there because
[1:38:12] he goes i'll give that to esau that's
[1:38:14] all that's all the fathers that he's
[1:38:16] supposed to that's all the further he's
[1:38:17] supposed to go that's all that he knows
[1:38:19] about that's the only thing that he
[1:38:21] knows in his denomination
[1:38:23] he goes that's all that god gave him
[1:38:25] just pass him on by don't go to fussing
[1:38:27] and fighting with him just pass by
[1:38:29] quietly but look here jacob you
[1:38:31] pentecostal jacob you're really born
[1:38:33] again got the experience and led by the
[1:38:35] holy ghost don't go fussing with him but
[1:38:37] pentecostal jacob has the full promise
[1:38:39] down in the land
[1:38:42] oh church we ain't got to try to
[1:38:43] straighten everybody else out
[1:38:45] that's not our promise no we let them if
[1:38:48] they want to criticize let them
[1:38:49] criticize that's as far the further they
[1:38:51] can go but somebody's going into the
[1:38:53] land somebody's tasted of it somebody's
[1:38:56] made their way we're going lord we're
[1:38:58] going to make our move
[1:39:02] possess the promise possess the promise
[1:39:05] the promise is unto you
[1:39:07] we've been here 40 years
[1:39:09] he says using this as an evidence
[1:39:10] speaking in tongues he says we've been
[1:39:12] using that as an evidence for 40 years
[1:39:15] speaking in tongues and divine healing
[1:39:17] he goes that's just a few grapes brought
[1:39:18] back from the promised land the land is
[1:39:20] ours it all belongs to us he goes don't
[1:39:23] be afraid that the other fellow is going
[1:39:25] to beat you down there no he says join
[1:39:28] up with them and go take over
[1:39:31] go join up with them let's take over
[1:39:33] worried about this church having
[1:39:35] something we ain't got we don't need to
[1:39:36] worry about that let's just join up with
[1:39:37] him and go take over
[1:39:39] because we've been on this mountain for
[1:39:41] 40 years let's get off of it and let's
[1:39:43] go toward the promised land
[1:39:47] see our difference has turned him away
[1:39:49] our separation of brotherhood he says in
[1:39:51] the way that we have sent after all
[1:39:53] these things of the world instead of the
[1:39:54] things of god
[1:39:56] you find men today they're kingdom
[1:39:57] building
[1:39:58] they got something that's different from
[1:40:00] than this message
[1:40:02] oh that they proclaim that they have the
[1:40:04] message but yet there's something that's
[1:40:06] different in their ministry different in
[1:40:07] their church different in their circle
[1:40:09] of influence
[1:40:11] but when god sent us a prophet he sent
[1:40:13] us a prophet
[1:40:15] and that prophet revealed to us the
[1:40:17] fullness of the word he didn't break
[1:40:19] anything out different
[1:40:21] so why are we separating brotherhood why
[1:40:22] are we separating fellowship it's time
[1:40:24] that we move into the promised land of
[1:40:26] the world and keep what the prophet of
[1:40:28] god had said
[1:40:30] stop all the division and bring back to
[1:40:32] unity so we're not fighting against the
[1:40:34] men we're fighting against the spirits
[1:40:35] just trying to come in there he goes
[1:40:37] what have you done he goes in the
[1:40:38] wilderness for 40 years walking around
[1:40:39] over and over the same old grounds we
[1:40:42] got acts 2 and we got acts 4 and we got
[1:40:44] acts 2 and we got acts 4 where he goes
[1:40:46] we're going to run that to death
[1:40:49] let's go on the promised land is there
[1:40:51] for whatsoever things you desire when
[1:40:53] you pray believe that you receive it and
[1:40:56] you shall have it he says acts 2 and 4
[1:40:58] is all right but it ain't all of it
[1:41:02] oh acts 2 what is that repent and be
[1:41:04] baptized in jesus name you shall receive
[1:41:05] the holy ghost he goes that's good but
[1:41:07] that ain't all of it
[1:41:09] oh church there's more to the promised
[1:41:11] land there's more for the believer don't
[1:41:12] just camp out on the outskirts let's go
[1:41:15] in let's make our move
[1:41:18] god don't want you to be the borderline
[1:41:20] believer god wants you to go in and
[1:41:21] possess the promise the promise is just
[1:41:24] beyond the river just beyond there
[1:41:27] he says now let me start bringing this
[1:41:29] down to a close i got a few more minutes
[1:41:31] but we're gonna we're gonna get you out
[1:41:32] here a little bit early this morning
[1:41:34] he goes don't take these new things
[1:41:37] we find ministers today they got this
[1:41:38] new idea
[1:41:41] you got them all over the place we got
[1:41:43] elohim now and we got this one and we
[1:41:45] got that one we got men all around the
[1:41:47] world
[1:41:48] raising their self up to a pinnacle now
[1:41:50] we're in the laodicean church age which
[1:41:52] is completely are the bright age which
[1:41:53] is different than the lay of the cna so
[1:41:55] now we've got to have a messenger that's
[1:41:56] going to bring us in and out and all
[1:41:58] this kind of garbage we got more
[1:42:00] man-made hoopla than we have but god
[1:42:02] sent us a message
[1:42:05] and it's clearly one thing the land
[1:42:06] belongs to you
[1:42:08] he goes don't take anything else new he
[1:42:10] goes they're flying everywhere there'll
[1:42:11] be more than that come he says don't
[1:42:13] take these new things the lord your god
[1:42:15] has declared to you what is truth
[1:42:18] he's declared to us what is truth the
[1:42:20] lord your god has vindicated what is
[1:42:22] truth and by his word and by his spirit
[1:42:25] he says not by power not by might but by
[1:42:28] my spirit saith the lord god seeks those
[1:42:30] that will worship him in spirit and in
[1:42:32] truth and he has thoroughly vindicated
[1:42:35] jesus christ to be the same yesterday
[1:42:37] today and forever he showed the evening
[1:42:40] seeds to you
[1:42:43] he's revealed it to you in the word he
[1:42:45] has proven it to you by his spirit he
[1:42:47] says now don't never get nothing among
[1:42:50] you
[1:42:53] if you see something coming in your
[1:42:54] heart against somebody
[1:42:57] get it out of there right then
[1:43:00] oh you know some some of us you know
[1:43:02] we're so supernatural and spiritual we
[1:43:04] like to just keep that thing there just
[1:43:06] in case we need it to let it loose
[1:43:10] oh
[1:43:11] prick the nerve era
[1:43:13] well i'm just going to put that thumb
[1:43:15] and push it back a little bit and when
[1:43:16] it needs to come out there's going to be
[1:43:18] a line
[1:43:22] he says don't never get nothing among
[1:43:24] you
[1:43:26] if you see something come in your heart
[1:43:28] against somebody get it out of there
[1:43:30] right then
[1:43:33] don't let that thing fester don't let
[1:43:34] that thing boil over don't let that
[1:43:36] thing
[1:43:37] keep you from the blessings of the
[1:43:38] promised land
[1:43:40] he says don't let and satan will do his
[1:43:42] best to get among you so it's not your
[1:43:45] brother some of you probably had a
[1:43:46] squabble on the way to church this
[1:43:48] morning it's not your wife
[1:43:50] it's not your kids parents hey man to
[1:43:53] that one huh
[1:43:54] yeah you got teenagers you know what i'm
[1:43:56] talking about he says it's not your wife
[1:43:57] it's not your kid satan will do his best
[1:44:00] to get among you
[1:44:02] why because he wants to block the
[1:44:04] blessing that you're about to receive he
[1:44:06] doesn't want you to enter into the land
[1:44:08] he wants you to stay on the outskirts
[1:44:10] and just fester a little bit
[1:44:13] let them come say something to me today
[1:44:15] and i'm just not in the mood for this
[1:44:17] don't you mess with me today
[1:44:20] my boss told me one time it was so funny
[1:44:22] he just got newly married and at this
[1:44:24] point in time and his they it was about
[1:44:26] three o'clock in the morning
[1:44:28] and the baby done something i don't know
[1:44:29] and and apparently she was not in such a
[1:44:32] good mood and she looked over and
[1:44:33] thought you start with me today three
[1:44:35] o'clock in the morning my good lord they
[1:44:37] starting early
[1:44:39] that's how sometimes we feel don't you
[1:44:41] say nothing to me hey i'll go to church
[1:44:42] today but they better not say the thing
[1:44:44] because i just probably gonna get into
[1:44:45] carnal i'm gonna be fleshy flesh
[1:44:49] he said don't let that get among you
[1:44:50] that keeps you from the promise
[1:44:53] it keeps you from the joys of the lord
[1:44:55] it keeps
[1:44:56] fellowship and brotherhood broken god
[1:44:58] doesn't want us to break our fellowship
[1:45:02] he wants us to enter into the land he
[1:45:04] says some slick tongue fellow might come
[1:45:06] along and try to take you away says you
[1:45:07] think that they could talk moses out of
[1:45:09] the presence of god where he stood there
[1:45:11] and he seen he says no he goes we don't
[1:45:13] take it we don't add to it we don't take
[1:45:15] from it we just keep the word the way
[1:45:17] the lord gave it
[1:45:19] that's what we're to do church
[1:45:21] so they can add all they want to ask
[1:45:24] they can take away all they want to take
[1:45:25] away they want the blood out take the
[1:45:27] blood out that's fine he saw you can do
[1:45:28] what you want
[1:45:30] you don't want the emotion you ain't got
[1:45:31] to have the emotion you don't want the
[1:45:33] presence of god you don't have to have
[1:45:34] the presence of god you don't have to
[1:45:35] have none of that but for me in my house
[1:45:37] we're going to serve god in the fullness
[1:45:38] of his word we're going to trust god
[1:45:40] we're going to enter into the promised
[1:45:42] land i'm not looking at this family or
[1:45:44] that family what this one's doing or
[1:45:46] what that was doing i'm looking right
[1:45:48] here i know what the word declares and
[1:45:50] it's time for somebody to make their
[1:45:52] move
[1:45:55] caleb steal the people before moses and
[1:45:57] said let us go at once and possess it we
[1:45:59] are well able to overcome he goes i
[1:46:02] thank god or thank god

[1:46:36] slobber eating the grapes of canaan

[1:48:18] you if we have something that's not
[1:48:19] junior-wide i'd rather have a little bit
[1:48:21] of wildfire than no fire
[1:48:24] because you can't get warm by a painted
[1:48:26] fire
[1:48:28] but if you've got a little bit of
[1:48:29] wildfire it'll get you heated up and
[1:48:31] that wildfire begins to move and begin
[1:48:33] to move to this one and begin to jump
[1:48:34] over on this one and then finally you'll
[1:48:36] find that the whole church is set on
[1:48:38] fire why because they're tasting of the
[1:48:40] land they taste another goodness they
[1:48:42] taste another milk and honey they taste
[1:48:44] it in the blessing of god vacation of it
[1:48:47] hold on fire don't scare you i want more
[1:48:50] for her i want more word i want more
[1:48:52] revelation i want more pills i want more
[1:48:54] honey of the word of god

[1:49:03] goes just let the devil squall and
[1:49:04] scream have all his chances that he
[1:49:06] wants to thus saith the lord this is
[1:49:09] right

[1:51:27] other
[1:51:28] night wednesday night
[1:51:30] as a evidence of the
[1:51:32] land there's five out there saying you
[1:51:35] can't have it
[1:51:38] five to one
[1:51:39] ten against two
[1:51:41] the odds are against you
[1:51:44] the odds are against us just play
[1:51:45] something
[1:51:47] yes
[1:51:49] last year there was a two-year-old colt
[1:51:51] finished dead last in his first race
[1:51:54] and i'm bringing this to a close and i'm
[1:51:55] gonna end it right here
[1:51:57] disappointed his owners placed him on a
[1:51:59] claiming race where anyone can take
[1:52:01] ownership of the horse four feet thirty
[1:52:03] thousand dollars was the price paid for
[1:52:06] this horse
[1:52:07] thirty thousand that looks like a big
[1:52:08] number
[1:52:09] but it's immaterial
[1:52:12] an older man claims a cold after missing
[1:52:14] his chance to claim another horse that
[1:52:15] he wanted he says his last this is his
[1:52:17] last attempt to find some success in the
[1:52:19] racing industry
[1:52:21] in the next race the colt wins by 17
[1:52:23] links and his new owner is encouraged
[1:52:26] but in a few races that follow he
[1:52:27] finishes third twice fourth once and
[1:52:30] fifth once but his owner still believes
[1:52:33] oh i think we got an owner that's
[1:52:34] looking down upon us he still believes
[1:52:36] in this little cult
[1:52:39] this year in 2022 is the colts only
[1:52:42] chance to race in a major thoroughbred
[1:52:44] race which is limited to three-year-old
[1:52:46] horses the day before the kentucky derby
[1:52:48] the field of horses is already full but
[1:52:51] then at the last moment a famous trainer
[1:52:53] scratches and he withdraws his horse the
[1:52:56] colt takes his place in the field of 20
[1:52:58] horses just 30 seconds before the entry
[1:53:01] deadline
[1:53:03] 30 seconds that's all you need today
[1:53:06] church
[1:53:07] just 30 seconds
[1:53:09] 30 seconds before the entry deadline now
[1:53:11] he's in the game
[1:53:13] now he has a chance
[1:53:15] but all the metrics and all the
[1:53:17] predictors are against him neither his
[1:53:19] own or his trainer nor his jockey has
[1:53:22] ever been associated with any horse in
[1:53:24] the kentucky derby this was a brand new
[1:53:26] area
[1:53:28] his jockey had never won a major event
[1:53:30] and the they they were outsiders and
[1:53:32] newbies in the elite arena and on the
[1:53:35] morning of the race the odds of winning
[1:53:37] are set at 80 to 1.
[1:53:41] this horse shouldn't even been in this
[1:53:43] race
[1:53:44] this jockey shouldn't even been on this
[1:53:46] horse
[1:53:47] he had never won a major event this
[1:53:49] horse has never won a major race and now
[1:53:51] they find herself in the kentucky derby
[1:53:54] and all the odds are against you
[1:53:57] all the odds are against them and
[1:53:59] halfway around the track the colt is 16
[1:54:02] horses back from the lead just as we
[1:54:05] suppose why are you even here
[1:54:08] look at you you're 16 you're way at the
[1:54:10] back of the pack you're just four horses
[1:54:12] from the back he can't even be seen in
[1:54:14] the field of view by the drone that's
[1:54:16] flying over and look he's a nobody he's
[1:54:19] a throw away he's an on
[1:54:21] insequential participant he's just there
[1:54:24] to make sure they have a a quorum to
[1:54:26] have a race
[1:54:28] just to make sure they got 20 horses but
[1:54:30] then he makes his move
[1:54:33] oh there it is church but then he may be
[1:54:36] 16 back nobody may give him any
[1:54:38] recognition but then he makes his move
[1:54:42] he begins to work his way through the
[1:54:44] crowd he begins to find little paths
[1:54:46] here and a few opportunities there and
[1:54:48] he has as they head toward the finish
[1:54:50] line he's moved up the fifth then he's
[1:54:52] moved up to the fourth and still no one
[1:54:54] notices him no one sees him no one
[1:54:57] mentions him everybody's attention's on
[1:54:59] the first two the two well-known horses
[1:55:02] but only seconds before the finish
[1:55:04] before the finish he suddenly and
[1:55:07] magically passes the two front horses
[1:55:10] and the announcer struggles to identify
[1:55:12] and to say his name he almost almost in
[1:55:15] a single breath rich strike is coming up
[1:55:17] on the inside oh my goodness the longest
[1:55:20] shot has won the can derpy derby i'm
