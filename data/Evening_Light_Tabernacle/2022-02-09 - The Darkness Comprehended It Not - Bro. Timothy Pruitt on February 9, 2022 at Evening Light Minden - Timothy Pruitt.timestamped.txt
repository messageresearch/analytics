[41:49] one
[41:51] amen i bring you
[41:53] greetings from brother kelly hildebrand
[41:55] this
[41:56] assembly there
[41:58] just outside of saskatoon
[42:00] we had a wonderful time this past
[42:02] weekend
[42:03] it was uh
[42:04] quite cold
[42:06] uh glad to be back
[42:08] hey man i guess they got off got off the
[42:10] plane it was negative 28
[42:13] and uh you know after a long day of
[42:15] travel and you wore out and
[42:17] get there about two o'clock in the
[42:18] morning you walk outside
[42:20] it's negative 28.
[42:22] it'll wake you up real quick
[42:24] and uh but uh we
[42:26] thankful the services wasn't negative
[42:28] 28. amen but the fire of god moved in
[42:32] our midst there was many that gave their
[42:34] hearts to the lord and healings that
[42:36] were brought in
[42:37] and uh man a man over 70 years old gave
[42:40] his heart to the lord
[42:42] amen makes it worth it all amen for one
[42:45] soul
[42:46] to walk down the aisle it's worth every
[42:48] trouble it's worth every mile
[42:50] amen so we're thankful for that thank
[42:53] you for your prayers amen john chapter 1
[42:56] and verse 1.
[42:58] in the beginning was the word
[43:00] and the word was with god and the word
[43:02] was god
[43:03] the same was in the beginning with god
[43:06] all things were made by him and without
[43:08] without him was not anything made that
[43:11] was made
[43:13] but in him was life
[43:15] and the life was the light of men
[43:17] and the light shineth in darkness
[43:20] and the darkness comprehended it not
[43:23] there was a man sent from god whose name
[43:25] was john the same came for a witness to
[43:27] bear witness of the light that all men
[43:30] through him might believed
[43:32] now he was not that light but was sent
[43:34] to bear bear witness of that light
[43:38] that was the true light which lighteth
[43:40] every man that cometh unto the world
[43:43] he was in the world and the world was
[43:45] made by him and the world knew him not
[43:48] he came unto his own and his own
[43:50] received him not but as many as received
[43:53] him to them gave he power to become the
[43:57] sons of god
[43:59] even to them that believe on his name
[44:01] which were born not of blood nor the
[44:03] will of flesh nor the will of man but of
[44:06] god
[44:07] and the word was made flesh
[44:10] and dwelt among us
[44:12] and we beheld his glory the glory is as
[44:15] of the only begotten of the father full
[44:18] of grace and of truth
[44:20] amen we'll let you be seated this
[44:22] evening
[44:24] i'd like to just speak to you this for a
[44:26] moment on the darkness comprehendeth it
[44:29] not
[44:32] quite um
[44:34] wonderful scripture
[44:36] reading here as we
[44:38] read john and his
[44:40] uh you know you can read the other
[44:41] gospels and john puts it in a way that
[44:44] no other gospel put it
[44:46] and he would go back not to just the
[44:48] beginning of genealogy but to the
[44:50] beginning of the creation of the world
[44:53] and he would begin to explain things and
[44:55] and begin to unfold things and but you
[44:58] know it was amazing that he would come
[45:00] to this verse and the light shineth in
[45:03] darkness speaking of this life that was
[45:05] the light of men and this light shineth
[45:07] in darkness but the darkness
[45:10] comprehendeth it not
[45:12] now you know darkness can never stop
[45:14] light from shining
[45:16] but the benefit of light must be seen by
[45:19] those who walk in the light
[45:22] if your eye if you know if your eyes are
[45:23] closed while you're walking in sunlight
[45:26] the light does not help you in the steps
[45:28] that you take
[45:29] amen you're just as good as a you know
[45:32] walk as much as or good as a blind man
[45:34] would walk with your eyes closed that is
[45:36] what it what it's like for those who did
[45:38] not comprehend the light in the days of
[45:41] jesus their eyes were closed
[45:44] something had blinded them now we could
[45:47] read in second corinthians 4 and verse 3
[45:49] it says but if our gospel be hid it is
[45:52] hid to them that are lost in whom the
[45:54] god of this world has blinded the minds
[45:58] of them which believe not
[46:00] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[46:03] christ who is the image of god should
[46:05] shine upon them so we see that the god
[46:08] of the age had blinded them the people's
[46:11] mind had blinded the people's minds so
[46:13] they could not see him nor understand
[46:16] him they would hear his words but they
[46:18] could not understand what he said they
[46:21] would see the miracles that would take
[46:23] place and yet still not understand who
[46:26] he was
[46:27] uh which is a you know paradox how could
[46:29] someone come and do things that no man
[46:32] could do you know
[46:34] it's a it's a paradox to think that
[46:35] someone could open the eyes of the blind
[46:38] and actually will get to it actually
[46:40] create eyeballs
[46:41] actually uh
[46:43] you know to cast out spirits of men of
[46:46] children that were cast into the fire by
[46:48] the by spirit casted out and do many
[46:51] mighty wonderful miracles but yet they
[46:54] still could not see who he was
[46:56] that's quite a blindness that has taken
[46:58] place when when you see the that those
[47:00] things can be done and in such a
[47:03] marvelous way but yet still not know who
[47:06] he is
[47:07] and you know it comes there's an
[47:09] entrance and psalms 119 and 130 says the
[47:12] entrance of thy words giveth light it
[47:16] giveth understanding to the simple so
[47:19] darkness can't stop it but it tries to
[47:21] hinder it it tries to block it it tries
[47:24] to stop up the entrance where the light
[47:26] comes to into the nerves and to the
[47:29] receptors amen you know i was just
[47:31] listening to a tape actually that was
[47:33] preached there in saskatoon there's
[47:35] about five services on tape he would
[47:37] preach more than that but there's five
[47:39] on tape well brother branham in the in a
[47:41] in a time there would describe of
[47:43] blindness he would just describe
[47:45] blindness as an individual invisible bam
[47:49] that would be over your hand cutting the
[47:51] blood flow off to your fingers and
[47:53] eventually the fingers would fall off he
[47:55] said that's exactly what happens in
[47:57] blindness he says a spirit to get over
[48:00] those optical nerves and begin to pull
[48:02] on them and squeeze them down and cut
[48:04] the blood flow off until that person
[48:07] becomes blind and he says see if it says
[48:10] if you could cut that ban
[48:12] then the blood flow would return and he
[48:15] said there is a power that will break
[48:17] that ban over the optical nerves of an
[48:20] eye and so the blood and light can come
[48:23] again and the word of god is a power
[48:26] there's a voice that speaks there's a
[48:27] word that goes forth there's a spirit
[48:29] that brings it to pass amen and then
[48:32] it's to curse the demons of hell that
[48:34] wants to cut the blood flow off to that
[48:37] part of the body and you know i thought
[48:39] it was very interesting as i i would
[48:41] listen to these tapes while i was in a
[48:43] motel there in saskatoon and brother
[48:45] brother kelly would give me some of the
[48:47] background of what had taken place well
[48:49] brother brandon would come and he said
[48:51] they would actually had rented a place
[48:52] that would hold three or four thousand
[48:54] people but somewhere around four or five
[48:56] hundred people would show up and you
[48:58] could tell brother branham would look at
[49:00] this and wonder about it and say some
[49:02] things as he would begin to say you know
[49:04] look we have this big building and not
[49:05] very many people here he said brother
[49:08] kelly said what had happened was all
[49:10] those churches around there those
[49:11] preachers and pastors had told their
[49:13] child their people if they showed up
[49:15] they would excommunicate them and so and
[49:18] then not only did they do that they came
[49:20] and said on the front row and to see who
[49:22] was there and to try to stop the
[49:24] presence of god the preaching of the
[49:26] word and the flow of the spirit amen and
[49:29] you know and i thought it was very
[49:30] interesting interesting in about the
[49:32] second service as i was listening to it
[49:35] brother branham comes in the prayer line
[49:36] and he's discerning now he's sitting he
[49:38] says now i want to get away from that
[49:40] for a moment and he begins to just ask
[49:42] people what their needs are and you know
[49:44] he said i just want to show you what
[49:46] prayer can do
[49:47] and he said he began to ask them and
[49:49] they would say this and they would say
[49:50] that and he'd begin to pray and in the
[49:52] middle of all this
[49:55] obstruction in the middle of all these
[49:57] people trying to hinder and trying to
[49:59] stop amen god came down and there was
[50:01] blind that received their sight it was
[50:03] death that heard there was a crippled
[50:05] boy that walked it was a little mute kid
[50:08] you can listen to him on the tape as he
[50:09] couldn't speak and hear his mama say he
[50:11] can't talk and brother branham prays for
[50:14] him and he said now i want you to say
[50:15] aye
[50:16] little boy would say i say love love
[50:19] jesus jesus in the middle of all of that
[50:22] god was still displaying his power amen
[50:26] because darkness will never stop light
[50:28] it'll try to hinder it it'll try to keep
[50:30] it back it'll try to hold it back but
[50:33] lightness light will always prevail amen
[50:36] and we see that satan had had blinded
[50:39] their eyes and the light had been put
[50:41] out and their hearts were hardened so
[50:43] they couldn't receive the light that had
[50:45] come into the world and no matter the
[50:47] signs he done or the miracles he wrought
[50:50] they never could receive that light and
[50:52] i thought that was interesting that
[50:54] those men that would you know i i feel
[50:56] like maybe if i had that attitude and
[50:58] but i saw the things god was doing i
[51:00] would i would say hey i'm wrong i'd call
[51:03] my church members say every one of y'all
[51:04] get down here come and see what god is
[51:07] doing amen because you know there's
[51:09] something about that when you begin to
[51:11] see god doing things only god could do
[51:14] it opens our eyes and we begin to
[51:16] realize who he is amen but in the middle
[51:19] of all of that those same men sat there
[51:21] same critics still critics say man would
[51:24] hold on to those things for years and
[51:26] years and years amen just as the
[51:27] pharisee amen shows you those spirits
[51:30] never die they're always trying to push
[51:32] out the supernatural they're always
[51:35] trying to hinder the move of god they're
[51:37] always trying to stop the blood flow in
[51:39] the church amen but god will have a
[51:42] people amen that has their eyes open has
[51:44] their hearts ready to believe amen the
[51:46] blood flowing through their bodies to
[51:49] receive all that god has for them but we
[51:51] see you know
[51:53] they stay you know there's also a thing
[51:54] about the sun that if you all right
[51:57] light if you stare at it too long and
[51:59] you try to figure it out it'll put your
[52:01] eyes out
[52:03] amen what they thought you know in that
[52:05] time was real light was actually
[52:08] darkness
[52:09] because they hear when they came to the
[52:10] real true vindicated light of their day
[52:14] amen they stared at it and they
[52:15] questioned it and they wondered about it
[52:18] and until their eyes were completely put
[52:20] out
[52:22] amen this is what you know it's i think
[52:24] it's quite a statement that jesus would
[52:25] say in luke chapter 11 verse 33 he says
[52:29] no man when he lighteth a candle putteth
[52:31] in the secret place neither under a
[52:33] bushel but on a candlestick that which
[52:36] may come and may see the light and the
[52:38] light of the body is the eye therefore
[52:41] when thy eye is single the whole body is
[52:44] full of light but when thy eye is evil
[52:47] thy body also is full of darkness take
[52:50] heed therefore that the light which is
[52:52] in thee be not darkness
[52:56] amen standing right there to people who
[52:58] thought they had the light
[53:00] they thought they had the words they did
[53:02] they had the words of isaiah they had
[53:04] the words of the prophet and
[53:06] right there trying to put out the very
[53:08] light that came into the world
[53:11] amen because they were living brother
[53:12] man would talk about their live was
[53:14] living now in the glare of another age
[53:17] amen we we see even ii corinthians satan
[53:20] transforming himself into an angel of
[53:23] light you say well i got the word but
[53:26] amen jesus said be careful that the
[53:29] light that is within thee be not
[53:31] darkness amen that it's not something
[53:34] that satan has interjected amen into
[53:37] your thoughts into your heart into the
[53:39] things and what you think is light is
[53:41] actually darkness amen we you know we
[53:44] see things as going on in the age that
[53:46] we're living in we see people that
[53:48] thought they had light and now they're
[53:50] realizing it's darkness
[53:52] amen darkness is dwelling in their lives
[53:55] and taking over them you know i i think
[53:58] it's amazing that that that a child
[54:00] could actually see something that that
[54:02] us adults many times can't see you know
[54:05] uh you know there was a there was a
[54:06] little child one time that would come to
[54:08] his mama and i'm going to just leave the
[54:11] names out of it would come to his mama
[54:13] and say you know i don't understand how
[54:15] this preacher is saying my granddad is
[54:17] not going to make it to heaven when my
[54:19] granddaddy is the one who will treat us
[54:20] right who will do right to us who
[54:23] who acts more like a christian than now
[54:25] this little kid was about eight years
[54:26] old actually more like a christian than
[54:28] anybody that i know of amen you know but
[54:31] yet this other ones was was full of
[54:33] darkness yet they were saying they were
[54:35] the light
[54:36] amen and a child could pick it up a
[54:39] child could see it a child could discern
[54:41] between the two spirits amen you know
[54:43] what is it it was a false light
[54:47] amen it was a false creed or a false
[54:50] dogma that was portrayed as light
[54:53] amen satan is trying to deceive the
[54:55] church world today by false light
[54:58] amen what is perceived to be light what
[55:01] is perceived to be the truth what is
[55:03] perceived to be right and inside of them
[55:06] is darkness
[55:08] they can be speaking things that they
[55:09] considered to be light and yet treating
[55:12] people and kicking people out and
[55:13] judging and saying you're not going to
[55:15] make it unless you do a certain thing
[55:17] that i do or you act a certain way or
[55:19] believe something that i believe what is
[55:20] it it is a false light
[55:24] you know the the greatest robbery at the
[55:26] time brother branham speaks about was a
[55:28] robbery i looked it up actually in
[55:30] england amen it was a false light that
[55:32] call that they robbed a train they held
[55:35] up a train because they put up a fault
[55:37] stop sign light
[55:39] and it caused this train to stop in a
[55:41] certain place amen am to where they
[55:43] could jump on it and they could rob it
[55:45] of millions of dollars one of the
[55:46] greatest robberies at the time amen by a
[55:49] false light where they could put a light
[55:51] on a railroad track and caution it and
[55:54] stop it and there the robbery took place
[55:56] a false light gave the greatest net
[55:59] robbery that the nations has ever known
[56:03] it robbed the nations of the greatest
[56:05] hold up the greatest robbery was done by
[56:08] a false light and the greatest robbery
[56:10] the church of god has ever had is a
[56:13] false light
[56:14] it's robbed people of their uh of their
[56:17] homes it's robbed people of their
[56:18] families this is separated then why by a
[56:22] false light portrayed to be the true
[56:24] light
[56:26] amen amen taking trying to take the
[56:28] place of the true light
[56:32] right amen rob there it is robbed the
[56:35] church he said a false light has robbed
[56:38] the church of the moving of the holy
[56:40] ghost
[56:42] a false life it delighted took the very
[56:45] lifeline from the church it robbed them
[56:48] of the word and they accepted the creed
[56:50] instead of the word it robbed them
[56:55] you know actually on my way home i i i
[56:58] went into the delta lounge there and i
[57:00] was sitting back there we had a few
[57:01] hours to in atlanta and i went into the
[57:03] lounge and i was looking at some things
[57:05] and this man come and sit across from me
[57:07] at the chair there and we he just began
[57:09] to strike up a conversation and so i
[57:12] began to talk to him we talked about all
[57:13] kinds of things but he asked me what i
[57:15] did for a living i said well i'm
[57:17] actually a a full-time minister in the
[57:20] gospel i said i i'm an assistant pastor
[57:22] at a home church there in louisiana he
[57:24] said oh he said that's wonderful he said
[57:26] you know he said our church is really
[57:28] having some problems he said you know i
[57:30] don't i don't know what i i don't know
[57:32] what to do about it he said i tried to
[57:34] tell he said we got an aids problem
[57:37] he said everybody in our church is dying
[57:39] he said because there's no young people
[57:41] there there's no youth and
[57:43] and he said i've tried to tell him you
[57:45] got to do this and you got to do that
[57:46] you got to do that we tried all kinds of
[57:48] things and he said i don't know what to
[57:50] do anymore because it's
[57:52] dying and he said what are y'all do
[57:55] y'all have any do you all have what do
[57:56] y'all do at your church do you have any
[57:58] young people
[58:00] i said well yes sir we got this many and
[58:02] probably in sunday school and about this
[58:04] many above sunday school he said well
[58:06] what are you doing
[58:08] i said well we're not we're not you
[58:10] haven't give them a creed or a dogma or
[58:13] some program we preach the gospel to
[58:16] them
[58:17] and there's a gospel that's not just a
[58:19] gospel of yesterday or our gospel that
[58:22] and there is a gospel that works
[58:25] and then there's a gospel that lives
[58:27] there's a light that can shine upon a
[58:28] heart and illuminate them to where they
[58:31] can realize who they truly are
[58:33] amen amen you know listen we want more
[58:37] than just light we want the true light
[58:40] we want more than just a word we want
[58:43] the true word we want more than just the
[58:45] spirit we want the holy ghost moving in
[58:48] our hearts and our lives we want what he
[58:50] has for us amen and some demon of hell
[58:53] wants to wrap himself around and cut the
[58:56] blood flow i say let there be a preacher
[58:58] rise up with enough power of the holy
[59:01] ghost to speak against that thing and
[59:03] cut it off the body
[59:08] amen but people get caught up in false
[59:10] lights
[59:15] but you know what's amazing about light
[59:18] when you go home tonight and it ain't so
[59:20] bad in the time in this in this season
[59:22] that we're in but come summertime you go
[59:25] go home at night
[59:26] and the light is giving you direction
[59:28] it's showing you amen the path that you
[59:31] need to take
[59:32] showing you of obstacles that rise maybe
[59:34] a tree fell over deer that jump out but
[59:37] it's also attracting bugs
[59:40] it's also attracting things that you
[59:42] don't really want to hit on your car
[59:44] and you know make make marks and things
[59:47] and all that kind of stuff what is it
[59:48] they are also attracted to the light
[59:52] amen and we find it amen wherever
[59:54] there's a true light it attracts true
[59:57] seed of god but it also attracts those
[59:59] who wants to see a miracle take place or
[1:00:02] see signs and wanders maybe interested
[1:00:05] about something about a better life and
[1:00:06] a better way of living amen but inside
[1:00:09] of them there's darkness they never
[1:00:10] allow they might allow the light to
[1:00:13] light up their outside but they never
[1:00:14] allow it to come on the inside and open
[1:00:17] up the secret compartments of their
[1:00:19] heart until the darkness begins to push
[1:00:22] back against the light
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:27] but this robbery came from a false light
[1:00:30] and i you know i thought this is very
[1:00:32] interesting also
[1:00:34] brother man i'm talking about this he
[1:00:36] said
[1:00:36] it costs the church this false light has
[1:00:39] cost the church the great greatest
[1:00:41] robbery it's ever had
[1:00:44] cold
[1:00:45] creeds
[1:00:46] won't ripen a vindicated word grain
[1:00:51] cold creeds will not ripen a word
[1:00:54] vindicated a vindicated word grain amen
[1:00:57] jesus said the word of god is a seed
[1:00:59] crow cold creeds will not ripen the word
[1:01:05] cold blizzardy days won't ripen the
[1:01:08] wheat
[1:01:11] amen no no he says no indeed it it takes
[1:01:14] the warmth of the sunlight
[1:01:17] because it was god's spoken word to do
[1:01:19] such a thing it'll take the word spoken
[1:01:22] of god to show the saints of god
[1:01:24] that jesus christ lived just the same as
[1:01:27] he was yesterday he is today creeds and
[1:01:30] denominations cold and indifference the
[1:01:33] grain will rot right in the ground
[1:01:37] it takes the heat of the sun it takes
[1:01:40] the light of god's word it it takes more
[1:01:43] than just a theology or or a psychology
[1:01:46] it takes a living word made manifest
[1:01:56] he said i believe that's what's matter
[1:01:58] with the world today friends is because
[1:02:01] the world is trying to live in the glare
[1:02:03] of the light that shined in another day
[1:02:06] and that's what this man was speaking
[1:02:07] about he i believe he said he was a
[1:02:09] lutheran
[1:02:10] and and you know and i thought you know
[1:02:11] luther had a light
[1:02:13] but the light moved on
[1:02:15] but many people refused to move with the
[1:02:17] light
[1:02:18] they didn't want it amen they didn't
[1:02:19] want it
[1:02:20] you know it's they moved on they moved
[1:02:22] on to wesley to sanctification and they
[1:02:25] didn't want that no more you know they
[1:02:26] didn't want to move when it moved to the
[1:02:28] pentecostals and the restoration of the
[1:02:30] gifts and then they didn't want to move
[1:02:32] until it moved to the message and the
[1:02:33] things that we're doing it's happening
[1:02:35] in this day in this generation
[1:02:38] and of course people today say well we
[1:02:40] don't need no more the gifts
[1:02:43] that's the light of another day well why
[1:02:45] don't you throw the sanctification out
[1:02:46] and the justification out with it
[1:02:51] amen you know it takes it's still light
[1:02:55] it still takes justification it still
[1:02:58] takes sanctification it still takes the
[1:03:00] restoration of the gifts it still takes
[1:03:03] all of that
[1:03:05] amen but people want to throw out the
[1:03:08] pentecost and they but they don't want
[1:03:09] to throw out the other stuff listen i
[1:03:11] want all that god has
[1:03:13] i want everything that he has i want all
[1:03:16] of the light of god's word
[1:03:19] amen we need to be in the harvest time
[1:03:22] and in the harvest time amen the sun is
[1:03:24] shining the light of god's word is
[1:03:27] heating the ground and heating
[1:03:29] atmospheres around us why because seeds
[1:03:31] are coming to manifestation
[1:03:35] and then the sun is not only just
[1:03:37] bringing the wheat seeds to
[1:03:38] manifestation it's also bringing the
[1:03:40] weeds and the tears to manifestation
[1:03:45] amen the same light
[1:03:49] but we go you know it says what happens
[1:03:52] he said people are living in a glare of
[1:03:55] false light
[1:03:56] just like a mirage on the road how
[1:03:59] many's ever seen a mirage on the road
[1:04:01] they say you know you get out in the
[1:04:03] desert and you get real thirsty the sun
[1:04:05] kind of hit the desert and it looked
[1:04:07] like just like waters out there
[1:04:09] people have actually took off running
[1:04:11] and ran till they died
[1:04:13] thinking they're running to water
[1:04:15] amen it's a false conception
[1:04:17] it's a false idea of the sun he said
[1:04:20] when you get there it hasn't produced a
[1:04:23] thing but something false he said
[1:04:25] because you can't walk in the glare of
[1:04:27] the sun because it's a mirage always
[1:04:29] showing you something that there is that
[1:04:32] there's nothing to it he said when
[1:04:33] people try to tell you that jesus christ
[1:04:36] isn't the same yesterday today and
[1:04:38] forever they're leading you to a mirage
[1:04:42] he said when you get into a church and
[1:04:44] you join church and some creed or
[1:04:46] something there's nothing there no more
[1:04:48] than what you had in the world he said
[1:04:49] let me tell you don't ever refuse the
[1:04:52] true light of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:04:54] which brings the warming rays of the
[1:04:57] holy ghost upon you
[1:04:59] and makes you a new creature in christ
[1:05:01] jesus don't walk in some glare of
[1:05:04] another age that glare might have all
[1:05:06] been right in that age it might have
[1:05:08] been all right for them it's proof so in
[1:05:10] the day of our lord jesus he was a
[1:05:12] scriptural light for that day he was the
[1:05:15] light
[1:05:17] now i thought i thought it was very
[1:05:18] interesting how john put it he said john
[1:05:21] the baptist came representing the light
[1:05:24] but jesus was the light
[1:05:28] i know a lot of people's got it mixed up
[1:05:30] in this day that we're living in and
[1:05:31] they're looking to the wrong one for
[1:05:33] light
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:35] william branham was not the light but he
[1:05:38] came representing him
[1:05:41] but there is the light and there is a
[1:05:44] light that can shine upon your heart and
[1:05:46] change you from glory to glory to glory
[1:05:49] and change you from a
[1:05:51] immature seed to a son of god
[1:05:59] he proved so
[1:06:01] he was a light
[1:06:03] when he came upon the earth to vindicate
[1:06:05] the promised word
[1:06:07] john was a bright and shining light
[1:06:10] certainly john had been prophesied by
[1:06:12] isaiah 700 years or so before his boy
[1:06:16] before his birth a voice of one be
[1:06:18] crying in the wilderness
[1:06:20] and malachi speaking up i'll send my
[1:06:22] messenger before my face to prepare the
[1:06:24] way here was john on earth making the
[1:06:26] written word live he was a voice of one
[1:06:29] crying in the wilderness
[1:06:31] amen and jesus said you want love to
[1:06:33] walk in his light because he was a
[1:06:36] bright and shining light but john said i
[1:06:38] must decrease my light must go out
[1:06:41] because i've served my time that the
[1:06:44] prophecy said of me but hear ye him
[1:06:47] he is the one follow him amen the jews
[1:06:50] thought they were worshipping in a true
[1:06:52] light they thought they were worshiping
[1:06:54] the same god and the very one they were
[1:06:56] thought they were worshiping was the one
[1:06:58] that was turning down
[1:07:01] there where everyone they thought they
[1:07:03] were worshiping was the one that was
[1:07:04] crucified
[1:07:07] and it's the same thing today there
[1:07:09] where one they call themselves
[1:07:11] worshipping is the very one they're
[1:07:12] criticizing
[1:07:14] it's the very one they're making fun of
[1:07:16] and making folly of and joking about and
[1:07:18] saying there's a bunch of emotional work
[1:07:20] up
[1:07:21] saying there's a bunch of this or that
[1:07:22] and the other amen but you know we need
[1:07:25] something sane and sensible there is
[1:07:26] something insane and sensible it's the
[1:07:29] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:31] it's the warmings of the son of god
[1:07:33] that'll warm your hearts amen out of a
[1:07:35] cold form of condition
[1:07:38] give you an amen inside of you a
[1:07:40] response to the word of god
[1:07:45] the one they thought they were
[1:07:47] worshiping they were crucified
[1:07:50] the one they were making fun of the very
[1:07:51] god
[1:07:52] making him a life in stock of the people
[1:07:54] the very god they thought they were
[1:07:56] worshiping
[1:08:02] jesus said the blind lead the blind
[1:08:05] they all fall in the ditch
[1:08:08] the hour at hand now when the light is
[1:08:10] shining that gospel light and the power
[1:08:12] the resurrecting the direction of jesus
[1:08:14] christ manifest himself that jesus
[1:08:17] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:08:19] forever he lauded that for this day the
[1:08:21] things that he promised for this day
[1:08:23] must happen in this day if the church
[1:08:25] won't accept it god is able these stones
[1:08:27] to rise children up to abraham he'll get
[1:08:29] his message over
[1:08:32] hallelujah oh hallelujah because he's
[1:08:34] always done it and he always will do it
[1:08:37] people thinking they're walking in the
[1:08:39] light
[1:08:40] and they're walking in the traditions of
[1:08:42] their fathers and the first thing you
[1:08:44] know they're walking in a glare of a
[1:08:45] light not the light but they reject that
[1:08:48] light that they claim to be worshiping
[1:08:54] his works thoroughly vindicated who he
[1:08:56] was
[1:08:58] search the scriptures in them you think
[1:09:00] you have eternal life they are they that
[1:09:02] testify me
[1:09:04] amen who can prove what i've said
[1:09:06] anything or claim that i've made that
[1:09:08] the heavenly father hasn't vindicated
[1:09:10] that through me he's proved to us he was
[1:09:13] the light of the hour because it was all
[1:09:15] prophesied that this messiah should be
[1:09:17] the way and here it bloomed alive but
[1:09:19] their traditions had separated them from
[1:09:22] the real light of the word
[1:09:25] pharisees sadducees herodians
[1:09:29] whatever might be they'd got the world
[1:09:31] so gamed up
[1:09:33] like they do in all ages
[1:09:36] there's some pharisees sadducees the men
[1:09:38] may have died but that spirit still
[1:09:40] lives
[1:09:43] they gone up
[1:09:44] so people cannot see the real light and
[1:09:48] then in the place of the true light they
[1:09:50] put a false light
[1:09:52] i mean remember just a few years ago
[1:09:54] maybe it was our last banquet i can't
[1:09:56] quite remember but brother danny steeman
[1:09:58] came and ministered
[1:10:00] and he talked about the turtles
[1:10:02] how they're born on the beach you know
[1:10:04] and and under a light of the moon
[1:10:07] they're to look at the light of the moon
[1:10:08] and that moon leads them back to where
[1:10:10] they came from he said but in the time
[1:10:12] that we're living in in cities have come
[1:10:14] up amen and they built great
[1:10:17] highways and great walls and and great
[1:10:19] buildings and things and they put street
[1:10:21] lights up there amen it is a false light
[1:10:23] to a turtle
[1:10:25] it's an artificial light amen it's a man
[1:10:28] made light and those turtles get
[1:10:30] confused when they come and their eyes
[1:10:32] are open and they begin to go after what
[1:10:34] they think is the moon but it's a false
[1:10:36] light and it leads them to a place to
[1:10:39] where they become dead on a highway run
[1:10:41] over by a car and this is what we're
[1:10:43] seeing the time that we're living in
[1:10:45] amen men have put up their own
[1:10:47] yard lights they're on street lights and
[1:10:49] say this is this street and this is this
[1:10:51] way and this is the way there's only one
[1:10:53] true way
[1:10:55] and that is the light
[1:10:57] jesus christ is only one way to
[1:10:59] salvation it's not through a creed it's
[1:11:02] not through a dogma it's not through a
[1:11:04] message idea it's through jesus christ
[1:11:09] but we got lights up and they're
[1:11:11] man-made lights and thousands are going
[1:11:14] after them
[1:11:16] and dying
[1:11:17] and you see their homes wrecked you see
[1:11:19] their lives wrecked you see them scarred
[1:11:22] up
[1:11:23] beat up
[1:11:24] mangled up
[1:11:26] messes because they followed after a
[1:11:28] man's light
[1:11:31] because i'm going to tell you every
[1:11:32] man-made light will go out
[1:11:37] every false doctrine will die
[1:11:42] but when that man's light goes out
[1:11:45] it leaves people in darkness
[1:11:48] that's all they got left
[1:11:50] but if you'll follow after his light
[1:11:53] that light will never go out
[1:11:55] all hell can't put that light out it can
[1:11:57] blow it ain't got no time of exp
[1:11:59] expiration date amen these lights right
[1:12:02] up here they got expiration days they
[1:12:04] may last longer than what they think
[1:12:05] they're probably gonna last less than
[1:12:06] what they promised amen but one day
[1:12:08] they're going to go out
[1:12:10] because their man made lights
[1:12:12] their man made ideas put on paper
[1:12:14] brought to a factory and put amen and
[1:12:17] made and manufactured and put up in this
[1:12:19] ceiling but one day they'll go out
[1:12:22] amen amen and every man may creed every
[1:12:25] man made doctrine every man-made idea it
[1:12:29] will go out
[1:12:31] amen that it's going to happen ain't
[1:12:33] matter hell and put it out winds of
[1:12:35] every every kind of devils of hell will
[1:12:37] come against it but there is a light
[1:12:40] amen hell can come against it demons can
[1:12:42] fight against it every kind of critic
[1:12:44] can beat their brains out against it but
[1:12:46] it'll still shine
[1:12:49] still pulsate down into the darkest of
[1:12:52] nights amen to reach out to the farthest
[1:12:54] places
[1:12:56] to go to the furthest souls that's
[1:12:58] conquered i want that light
[1:13:05] i wanted jesus christ as real today
[1:13:08] not just a church not just a creed not
[1:13:10] just a dogma i want a powerful living
[1:13:13] presence of almighty god
[1:13:17] he said lo a little while and the world
[1:13:19] won't see me
[1:13:20] why won't they see him
[1:13:23] he was vindicated in this age
[1:13:26] more than any age there's ever been
[1:13:28] since 2 000 years ago he walked on the
[1:13:30] shores of galilee and the world didn't
[1:13:33] see him
[1:13:37] they said well
[1:13:39] that was just that was just a
[1:13:41] hocus pocus you know this that they got
[1:13:43] all kind of a bunch of nonsense
[1:13:48] they're blind
[1:13:51] the light has put them put their eyes
[1:13:52] out
[1:13:54] the god of this world has blinded them
[1:14:00] he said been thoroughly vindicated by
[1:14:02] the word and by the works that he's been
[1:14:04] doing
[1:14:05] but yet none of them wanted to believe
[1:14:07] it
[1:14:08] proving his light was his word he said
[1:14:10] search the scripture but the traditions
[1:14:12] that we're living in well we believe
[1:14:14] moses
[1:14:15] moses is who we believe we don't know
[1:14:17] when you come
[1:14:18] we don't we where'd you get your
[1:14:19] education what can you prove that you're
[1:14:21] there his works testified who he was
[1:14:24] if they'd only read the bible they was
[1:14:26] reading it but they couldn't see it my
[1:14:28] works identified amen a man is known by
[1:14:31] his credentials and the credentials of
[1:14:33] the word of god to be sent by the word
[1:14:35] of god with the word of god same in
[1:14:37] every age it's always been you can't
[1:14:39] live by yesterday's light yesterday's
[1:14:41] light is history
[1:14:43] you can't get warm by sun that shine
[1:14:45] yesterday you got to have a sun for
[1:14:47] today
[1:14:48] amen what's the matter with the churches
[1:14:50] today that's what's the matter with
[1:14:51] people they're trying to live by what
[1:14:53] happened yesterday you cannot get worn
[1:14:56] by a painted fire
[1:14:59] amen you can paint it just as beautiful
[1:15:01] as you want to paint it but if it ain't
[1:15:03] got life in it there's no heat in it
[1:15:08] listen we can paint a fire as big as
[1:15:10] this wall and have fire licks of fire
[1:15:13] going up and it wouldn't none of us get
[1:15:15] worn by it
[1:15:16] you can paint it as big as whatever you
[1:15:18] want to paint it's painted on there and
[1:15:20] men have painted jesus christ and they
[1:15:23] made him a certain way and they made him
[1:15:25] this and they know life inside of there
[1:15:28] but if you'll bring the god back to the
[1:15:30] scriptures to where he's vindicated and
[1:15:33] life can flow through the body and he
[1:15:35] can go it'll warm you
[1:15:38] it'll make you where you're not cold and
[1:15:40] indifferent no more it'll make you where
[1:15:42] all those cold creeds have fallen off
[1:15:44] and there's something on the inside of
[1:15:46] you there's life
[1:15:51] the sunlight is sent to the earth
[1:15:53] to ripen the grain for the advancing of
[1:15:56] harvest
[1:15:57] each day brings forth a new sun the sun
[1:15:59] the shine of the day bringing the wheat
[1:16:01] up
[1:16:03] and shine it and shine until that week
[1:16:05] comes to fruition
[1:16:10] but you know
[1:16:11] we see
[1:16:13] people are looking back
[1:16:15] looking at something else
[1:16:18] their past experiences
[1:16:20] their past moments
[1:16:24] what kind of condition would you be in
[1:16:26] right now if the last time you saw the
[1:16:28] sun and the last time you felt this
[1:16:30] raise
[1:16:31] was even four days ago
[1:16:34] weeks ago i'm talking about it was gone
[1:16:37] probably wouldn't take but just a few
[1:16:38] seconds
[1:16:40] we cold
[1:16:41] block of ice
[1:16:44] now we understand
[1:16:46] why churches are cold blocks of ice
[1:16:49] because the sun hadn't been shining
[1:16:50] there
[1:16:52] a false light might been shining the
[1:16:54] lights may have been on but something is
[1:16:56] missing
[1:16:58] there's no there's no moving of the
[1:16:59] spirit of god and they they want to
[1:17:01] clamp down on it about why they want to
[1:17:04] they want to put out their own light
[1:17:06] portray their own light show who they
[1:17:09] are instead of who he is
[1:17:18] but he says here
[1:17:23] let me find this spot i'm wanting to
[1:17:25] find
[1:17:28] let's just go back to john chapter 1.
[1:17:31] and the light verse 5 the light shineth
[1:17:33] in darkness
[1:17:34] and the darkness comprehended that not
[1:17:37] now there's many there's actually
[1:17:39] several different meanings to this word
[1:17:41] comprehend
[1:17:42] comprehend perceive
[1:17:44] obtain
[1:17:46] attain
[1:17:47] lay hold of there's also another meaning
[1:17:50] which is to take or to overcome
[1:17:53] as of the evil overtaken one
[1:17:56] you know i've looked at different bible
[1:17:58] translations and some use the part
[1:18:00] comprehend as the king james does
[1:18:03] and some use the word extinguish
[1:18:07] you know there's different translations
[1:18:09] of the same word
[1:18:11] perceive overcome extinguish never put
[1:18:14] out did not overtake apprehend overpower
[1:18:16] the light so as all of these are
[1:18:19] our definitions of the same word used
[1:18:22] for comprehension but you know i believe
[1:18:24] that john 1 5 has a double meaning
[1:18:26] brother branham would say it speak that
[1:18:28] all scriptures have a compound meaning
[1:18:31] and you know i believe one light came
[1:18:34] and as hard as it tried darkness could
[1:18:36] not overcome it
[1:18:38] darkness could not stop it satan had
[1:18:41] tried for years he tried to put it out
[1:18:43] all down to the prophets amen but light
[1:18:45] kept moving it kept moving it kept
[1:18:47] moving and here it came the great and
[1:18:49] shining light and he tried to kill it he
[1:18:51] tried to put it a grave he tried to he
[1:18:54] tried to put it out but that light rose
[1:18:56] again
[1:18:57] amen it could not comprehend it could
[1:18:59] not overtake it it could not stop it
[1:19:02] also number two light came and the
[1:19:04] people in darkness could not understand
[1:19:07] it you know why because you must
[1:19:09] experience light before you can
[1:19:11] comprehend light
[1:19:14] amen you must experience what true light
[1:19:18] is amen until you can really comprehend
[1:19:21] what it is now if you lived in this
[1:19:23] building all your life from the day you
[1:19:25] was born and you never went outside you
[1:19:27] never saw the sun you could not
[1:19:29] comprehend what that sun does and what
[1:19:31] all it does what all it you know entails
[1:19:34] what it looks like how it acts what it
[1:19:36] what it feels like you could not
[1:19:38] comprehend it unless you experienced it
[1:19:43] and this is exactly where people are
[1:19:45] today they can't comprehend the holy
[1:19:47] ghost they can't they can't preach the
[1:19:49] holy ghost why because they have never
[1:19:52] experienced the holy ghost but once you
[1:19:55] experience the holy ghost in your life
[1:19:57] that's why brother branham said a man
[1:19:58] should never preach the gospel until
[1:20:00] he's been on the backside of the desert
[1:20:03] in the desert where the sun is beating
[1:20:05] down and it's beating out all the creeds
[1:20:07] and it's beating out all of his ideas
[1:20:09] and the holy ghost is burning inside of
[1:20:11] him amen he shouldn't never preach until
[1:20:13] he has that experience and once he's
[1:20:16] experienced it then he can preach it
[1:20:18] once he's experienced it he can let it
[1:20:20] flow from his life because amen he has
[1:20:23] been in the presence of almighty god
[1:20:25] listen i don't want a preacher that's
[1:20:26] never i don't even want to listen to one
[1:20:28] that's never been in the presence of god
[1:20:30] i don't want to listen to one who ain't
[1:20:32] been in the presence of god in the last
[1:20:33] few days or last few hours i want to
[1:20:36] listen to a preacher that's experienced
[1:20:38] god for himself and he knows a real
[1:20:41] living christ that way he can preach it
[1:20:44] where i can understand it
[1:20:46] because he has experienced it
[1:20:49] and comprehends it
[1:20:52] but the problem is we've got too many
[1:20:53] preachers that don't comprehend
[1:20:57] they don't comprehend what the holy
[1:20:58] ghost can do in this hour therefore they
[1:21:00] want to put their own light on it and
[1:21:02] they want to put there in a box and it
[1:21:03] shines only in this box
[1:21:06] it only moves in this box it only
[1:21:08] operates in this box he only does this
[1:21:11] and this time and the holy ghost ain't
[1:21:13] interested in your boxes he ain't
[1:21:15] interested in your walls he ain't
[1:21:17] interested in your ideas amen the son of
[1:21:19] god the sunshine trying to go beyond the
[1:21:22] walls of man it'll go beyond your flimsy
[1:21:25] box and it'll burn down on the inside
[1:21:28] amen if you'll ever let him go and let
[1:21:29] him into your heart it'll begin to
[1:21:31] illuminate every section of your life
[1:21:33] every section of your body amen there is
[1:21:36] a light that wants to shine upon you
[1:21:40] and break you out of your darkness
[1:21:46] but you must experience it
[1:21:48] before you can ever comprehend it
[1:21:52] you must experience the sun before you
[1:21:54] could ever say what it is
[1:21:58] you must experience fire before you
[1:22:00] could ever understand what it could do
[1:22:04] because if you hadn't ever experienced
[1:22:06] fire chances are you'd walk up to it and
[1:22:08] put your finger in it but if you know
[1:22:10] what fire is
[1:22:12] no you'll just gather the warmth of the
[1:22:14] fire
[1:22:15] enjoy the bask in its glory
[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:19] you know this is
[1:22:21] this is one of my favorite events in
[1:22:24] jesus is life just personally i mean i
[1:22:26] love the miracles this is a miracle but
[1:22:29] i love the fishes and loaves and love i
[1:22:31] mean all the things but this is one of
[1:22:32] my favorites it's john 9 and verse 1.
[1:22:34] so when jesus passed by
[1:22:37] he saw a man which was blind from his
[1:22:39] birth
[1:22:40] and his disciples asked him saying
[1:22:42] master who did sin
[1:22:44] this man or his parents that he was born
[1:22:46] blind
[1:22:48] ain't that the way the devil likes to
[1:22:49] question
[1:22:51] i've heard that same question before
[1:22:53] amen when my little boy andrew was born
[1:22:55] with no surfactant in his lungs amen the
[1:22:57] first question that was asking me was
[1:22:58] walking down the hallway the devil said
[1:23:00] what did you do
[1:23:02] you must have done something
[1:23:04] for you to be going through what you're
[1:23:05] going through for your son to be about
[1:23:07] he's he's going to die because of what
[1:23:09] you did
[1:23:10] and i'm going through my mind wondering
[1:23:11] what i did
[1:23:14] amen but jesus answered them saying
[1:23:16] neither has this man sin nor his parents
[1:23:19] but that the works of god should be made
[1:23:21] manifest in him
[1:23:23] so the light can shine upon him
[1:23:26] oh hallelujah
[1:23:28] amen if we can get this eye this
[1:23:30] understanding tonight that whatever
[1:23:31] we're going through is for purpose is
[1:23:34] for a reason it's not necessarily
[1:23:36] because you've done something wrong or
[1:23:38] sinned in your life or thing but it's
[1:23:40] shy that the thing that you're going on
[1:23:42] going through is there because god wants
[1:23:45] to shine especially upon you god wants
[1:23:48] to reveal himself to you he said i must
[1:23:51] work the works of him that sent me while
[1:23:53] his day the night cometh when no man can
[1:23:55] work and as long as i am in the world i
[1:23:58] am the light of the world and when he
[1:23:59] does spoken he spat on the ground and
[1:24:02] made clay of the spittle and he anointed
[1:24:04] the eyes of the blind man with clay and
[1:24:07] said to him go wash in the pool of
[1:24:08] siloam which is by our interpretation
[1:24:11] sin and he went his way therefore and
[1:24:13] washed and came see
[1:24:17] oh my that was kind of a different deal
[1:24:19] right there hey man he didn't just speak
[1:24:21] to it he watered up a good water spot a
[1:24:23] spit and spit in the ground and got him
[1:24:26] a piece of clay and he began to mold it
[1:24:28] just like he did back there amen in days
[1:24:30] of adam as he was creating that first
[1:24:33] man he'd done this before and if he done
[1:24:35] it before he can do it again and he's
[1:24:38] putting it there and he's placing it in
[1:24:39] his eyeballs and he spits again and
[1:24:41] makes some more little mud and some clay
[1:24:43] and the right kind of ashes and right
[1:24:45] there he knew what it took to make an
[1:24:47] eyeball and he put it in his eyes and he
[1:24:49] said now you go wash and he went washed
[1:24:52] and he came back seeing what was it now
[1:24:55] he could experience light for himself
[1:25:00] while he was blind he couldn't tell
[1:25:02] anybody what light was while it was in
[1:25:05] darkness he didn't have a clue what
[1:25:06] light was but now his eyes were open
[1:25:10] now he could see and therefore he could
[1:25:13] tell somebody i know what it's like to
[1:25:15] be blind but now i know what it's like
[1:25:17] to see
[1:25:18] [Applause]
[1:25:21] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:25:25] and the neighbors therefore
[1:25:27] they which before had seen him that he
[1:25:29] was blind said
[1:25:31] is this not he that sat and begged
[1:25:34] some said this is he
[1:25:36] other says well
[1:25:37] he's like him but he said
[1:25:41] i am he
[1:25:46] amen see listen
[1:25:50] nobody could ever rob you of that
[1:25:52] experience
[1:25:54] we heard brother ben talk about that
[1:25:55] they might rob you of the of the moment
[1:25:58] and the memory of it all but they'll
[1:26:00] never rob you of that experience
[1:26:03] amen others you know it's amazing
[1:26:06] we read here and we really find out that
[1:26:07] the blind man wasn't the blind man
[1:26:14] you know there's a there's a song that's
[1:26:16] real good kind of catchy it talks about
[1:26:18] the lame man that walked and
[1:26:20] and the deaf man that heard and the dumb
[1:26:21] man that spake he said but won't you
[1:26:24] just ask the blind man he saw it all
[1:26:28] amen jesus amen knows how to orchestrate
[1:26:32] and move amen in possible situations and
[1:26:36] to where other people may not know
[1:26:39] i think this is who the i thought it was
[1:26:41] kind of looks like him something about
[1:26:42] him different
[1:26:44] something's something strange here
[1:26:47] but he said i'm
[1:26:48] he therefore said they unto him how were
[1:26:52] thy eyes open
[1:26:53] he said well i mean a man named jesus
[1:26:56] made some clay and going on in my eyes
[1:26:58] and said to go washing i went and washed
[1:27:00] them i received my sight
[1:27:03] and they said where is he so i don't
[1:27:05] know
[1:27:06] and they brought the pharisee to him
[1:27:08] that was a four time was blind and it
[1:27:10] was a sabbath day when she uh oh
[1:27:15] you know
[1:27:16] it was some false light that got messed
[1:27:18] up
[1:27:19] the sabbath day was jesus made clay and
[1:27:22] opened his eyes and again the pharisees
[1:27:24] also asked him how he received a sight
[1:27:26] and he said well he put clay upon my
[1:27:28] eyes and i washed and do therefore
[1:27:30] said some of the pharisees this man is
[1:27:32] not of god because he keepeth not
[1:27:34] our light
[1:27:37] he don't respect our light so he can't
[1:27:39] be the man of god
[1:27:41] others say well how can this man how can
[1:27:43] a man that is a sinner do much miracles
[1:27:46] or do this miracle
[1:27:48] and there was a division among them
[1:27:51] some said well there ain't no way it
[1:27:52] could be god because he's a sinner
[1:27:54] others said well how can a sinner do
[1:27:55] this and not be god or how can it be a
[1:27:57] sinner
[1:27:58] a
[1:28:01] they didn't have very good light
[1:28:04] their light wasn't very bright
[1:28:06] it was a false light
[1:28:08] amen it was no longer the true light it
[1:28:10] was a division among them they said in
[1:28:12] the blind man again what sayeth thou of
[1:28:14] him that thou has opened thy eyes he
[1:28:16] said he's a prophet
[1:28:19] amen something was beginning to dawn
[1:28:22] inside of him
[1:28:23] amen just like the woman at the well
[1:28:25] amen when she came there amen her life
[1:28:28] was her water pot
[1:28:30] that was the light of her her amen
[1:28:32] that's all the light she had left when
[1:28:34] jesus asked for a drink he said she said
[1:28:36] she said well you know you ain't
[1:28:38] customary you'd ask me of a drink he
[1:28:39] said well if you knew who i was you
[1:28:40] would ask me of a drink she said how are
[1:28:42] you going to give me a drink you don't
[1:28:43] even have a water pot
[1:28:45] that was her light
[1:28:47] but the scripture by the time it was
[1:28:49] over with the light began to shine upon
[1:28:51] her and she began to realize you know
[1:28:53] what this flashlight i walked up here
[1:28:55] with it ain't no good no more
[1:28:58] it don't do what i thought it did amen i
[1:29:00] found a greater light amen because she
[1:29:02] went from a jew to a prophet to thou
[1:29:05] must be the messiah what was it light
[1:29:07] was dawning upon her heart until the
[1:29:09] scripture said she went into the city
[1:29:12] and left her water pot
[1:29:15] what she thought was important wasn't
[1:29:17] important no more when you see the true
[1:29:20] living word of god manifested in your
[1:29:23] life what you thought was like what you
[1:29:26] thought was important is not important
[1:29:28] no more you'll leave it and run to the
[1:29:31] city and say come see a man who's told
[1:29:34] me all things
[1:29:43] this jews did not believe concerning him
[1:29:46] that he had been blind and received his
[1:29:48] sight until they called the parents
[1:29:50] they asked them is this your son who you
[1:29:54] say was born blind
[1:29:56] how does then does he now see
[1:29:58] his parents answered him said we know
[1:30:00] that this is our son
[1:30:01] and we know that he was born blind but
[1:30:04] by what means we know he now seeth we
[1:30:06] know not or who hath opened his eyes we
[1:30:09] know not
[1:30:10] he his of age ask him
[1:30:13] he shall speak for himself
[1:30:16] now we see that when the light shines on
[1:30:18] their hearts this word spoke to parents
[1:30:20] because they feared the jews for the
[1:30:22] jews had agreed already that any man did
[1:30:24] confess that he was a christ he'll be
[1:30:26] put out of the synagogue
[1:30:28] yeah just like saskatoon
[1:30:31] same spirit same false light same dogma
[1:30:35] therefore his parents said he is of age
[1:30:37] ask him and then again called they the
[1:30:39] man that was blind and said to him god
[1:30:41] give god the praise we know this man's a
[1:30:43] sinner
[1:30:45] what
[1:30:50] he answered and said
[1:30:53] whether he'd be a sinner or not
[1:30:55] i know not
[1:30:57] but one thing i know
[1:31:00] whereas i was blind now i see
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:05] they said then said then to him what did
[1:31:08] he what did he to thee how open he thou
[1:31:10] an eyes and he said i've already told
[1:31:13] you
[1:31:17] and you did not hear wherefore will you
[1:31:20] hear it again will you be his disciples
[1:31:24] if i tell you one more time will you
[1:31:27] hear it again
[1:31:31] if i testify one more time that i once
[1:31:34] was blind but now i see will you be as
[1:31:37] disciple
[1:31:39] [Applause]
[1:31:42] and they reviled him and said thou art
[1:31:44] his disciple but we are moses's disciple
[1:31:49] we got the prophet
[1:31:52] we got his tapes oops sorry we got his
[1:31:54] books
[1:31:55] we got him
[1:32:01] we know that god's speaking to moses but
[1:32:04] as for this fellow we know not from
[1:32:06] which he is
[1:32:09] now this man didn't get fed up
[1:32:12] he said i just found i just realized
[1:32:14] y'all just stupid
[1:32:17] the man answered said well herein is a
[1:32:19] marvelous thing
[1:32:21] that you know not from whence he is and
[1:32:23] yet he has opened my eyes
[1:32:26] now we know that god here is not sinners
[1:32:28] but if any man be a worshiper of god and
[1:32:31] doeth will him he heareth since the
[1:32:34] world began was it not heard that any
[1:32:37] man opened the eyes of one that was born
[1:32:39] blind if this man was not of god he
[1:32:42] could do nothing
[1:32:46] oh hallelujah if this man were not of
[1:32:50] god he could do nothing and the answer
[1:32:53] and said thou was altogether born in
[1:32:54] sins and thus teach us
[1:32:58] like they wouldn't born in sin
[1:33:01] they was born in the same sin shaped in
[1:33:03] the same iniquities anybody else needed
[1:33:05] the same blood
[1:33:07] but somehow
[1:33:08] by their light they convinced themselves
[1:33:10] i'm all right
[1:33:14] yet the cage of every unclean and
[1:33:16] hateful bird
[1:33:19] this is what happens in false lights it
[1:33:21] don't expose the true darkness
[1:33:25] hello somebody false lights does not
[1:33:27] expose the true darkness therefore in
[1:33:30] false lights and false light churches
[1:33:32] that teaches false light you can have
[1:33:34] every unclean bird you can have
[1:33:36] homosexuals you can have deacons
[1:33:38] committing amen ungodly sins on their
[1:33:40] own on granddaughters you can have all
[1:33:42] kinds of stuff why it's a false light
[1:33:45] but if a true light shines inside of
[1:33:48] there it'll expose every roach it'll
[1:33:50] expose every dome it'll expose
[1:33:52] everything the devil's ever done
[1:33:56] because it's the holy ghost in fire
[1:34:03] and they cast him out
[1:34:05] the best thing that ever happened to him
[1:34:10] and jesus heard that they had cast him
[1:34:12] out
[1:34:14] and when he found him he says does thou
[1:34:15] believe on the son of god and he said
[1:34:18] answer and said lord who is he
[1:34:21] that i might believe on him
[1:34:23] and jesus said unto him thou hast both
[1:34:26] seen him
[1:34:27] and it is he that talketh with thee
[1:34:30] and he said lord i believe
[1:34:33] and he worshipped him
[1:34:37] and jesus said for judgment i've come to
[1:34:39] this world
[1:34:40] that they would see
[1:34:42] my not see not might see
[1:34:45] and they which see might be made blind
[1:34:49] the same light gives light to some and
[1:34:52] blinds the other it depends on how
[1:34:54] you're looking at him
[1:35:00] some of the pharisees which were with
[1:35:01] him heard these words and said them are
[1:35:03] we blind also
[1:35:05] jesus said if you were blind you should
[1:35:08] have no sin
[1:35:09] but now you say we see
[1:35:12] therefore your sin remaineth
[1:35:16] if you would say god i'm blind
[1:35:18] i'm worse than that blind man
[1:35:21] i don't i didn't see it but now i see he
[1:35:23] said then your sin would be taken away
[1:35:25] but because you said we see
[1:35:28] your sin is going to remain
[1:35:31] darkness has tried for thousands and
[1:35:33] thousands of years to put out light it's
[1:35:36] tried to cancel it
[1:35:38] amen but darkness will never extinguish
[1:35:41] light darkness will never suppress light
[1:35:44] darkness will never overcome light
[1:35:46] darkness will never put out light amen
[1:35:49] darkness will never comprehend light
[1:35:51] amen as long as god has a people here on
[1:35:53] the earth amen that will always be the
[1:35:56] supernatural light of god shining
[1:35:59] it's an eternal life as we said before
[1:36:01] light is an attractant it also not only
[1:36:03] does it attract the true it also
[1:36:06] attracts the faults it attracts bugs it
[1:36:08] attracts spiders it attracts insects it
[1:36:11] attracts things by giving you light
[1:36:14] as it lights your path it's always a
[1:36:17] it's also lightening
[1:36:19] the evil
[1:36:20] and attracting them
[1:36:22] pulling the bugs in
[1:36:23] and the spiders in
[1:36:26] brother brandon would talk about this
[1:36:28] as we bring this down he said you know
[1:36:30] because i went to the statue of liberty
[1:36:33] with that big arm out there
[1:36:35] holding that
[1:36:36] light and he said laying under there was
[1:36:39] a bunch of dead sparrows
[1:36:44] and he says
[1:36:46] a bunch of dead sparrows
[1:36:49] he said looking at those little sparrows
[1:36:51] laying there i said
[1:36:52] said to the guard that was with me i
[1:36:54] said what's the matter with them little
[1:36:55] birds
[1:36:56] he said they died last night
[1:36:59] said there was a storm come up
[1:37:01] and they were flying in the storm
[1:37:03] and they came into the light but instead
[1:37:06] of using the light from the statue of
[1:37:08] liberty
[1:37:10] as a peaceful thing
[1:37:11] as a safety
[1:37:13] they came and tried to black the light
[1:37:15] out
[1:37:17] and they beat against it until their
[1:37:19] little heads were beat their brains out
[1:37:21] and they're laying dead because they
[1:37:23] refused to follow the light and now they
[1:37:26] beat their brains out he said oh god
[1:37:28] what an example of this the men and
[1:37:30] women raising up today people who try to
[1:37:32] deny god's bible people and i'll say
[1:37:35] this people who try to deny god's
[1:37:37] prophet
[1:37:38] tries to deny the true living word today
[1:37:40] instead of accepting this life as a
[1:37:42] place of safety
[1:37:45] as a guidance
[1:37:46] they beat against it
[1:37:48] and they beat against it and they beat
[1:37:51] against it you can beat all you want to
[1:37:56] but you'll never put out the light
[1:37:59] you can beat against this message oh you
[1:38:01] want to you can make all the videos you
[1:38:03] want to make and post them on youtube
[1:38:05] you can beat and you can beat and you
[1:38:07] can be until your brains are beat out
[1:38:10] but you will never
[1:38:12] i said you will never put this light out
[1:38:16] amen and just says that light donated by
[1:38:18] another country is still standing there
[1:38:21] as a sound of freedom so is this gospel
[1:38:24] line
[1:38:26] it's still standing against every storm
[1:38:29] against every wave against every black
[1:38:31] bird that wants to come and beat against
[1:38:33] it and try to black it out you'll never
[1:38:36] black it out
[1:38:37] but it'll stand throughout eternity as a
[1:38:40] sound of freedom
[1:38:43] as a sound of a peace and harmony as a
[1:38:46] place of safety
[1:38:48] for those who desire safety
[1:38:53] they're beating their heads out but this
[1:38:55] word will remain forever upon this rock
[1:38:58] i'll build my church and the gates of
[1:39:01] hell shall not prevail against it when
[1:39:03] peter first made his confession thou art
[1:39:05] the christ the son of the living god he
[1:39:07] said blessed art thou peter for flesh
[1:39:09] and blood has not revealed this to you
[1:39:11] you've never learned it in a seminary
[1:39:13] you never learned it from what somebody
[1:39:15] else said but my father has given it
[1:39:18] unto you and upon this rock this
[1:39:20] revelation of who i am the gates of hell
[1:39:23] will not prevail against it
[1:39:26] it'll be against it it's going to try to
[1:39:28] block it out and there's going to be
[1:39:30] more critics there's going to be more
[1:39:32] videos there's going to be more than
[1:39:34] nonsense but they'll be the ones laying
[1:39:36] dead amen beyond below the line as we
[1:39:39] rise
[1:39:42] and go towards that great and shining
[1:39:44] light into that body change don't forget
[1:39:47] as i told you last wednesday it's
[1:39:49] getting dark it's getting dark and it's
[1:39:50] getting darker until you almost can't
[1:39:52] see the hand in front of your face but
[1:39:54] why is it getting darker because behind
[1:39:57] that darkness it ain't darkness is
[1:39:59] pushing it's light is pushing
[1:40:02] if you'll begin to realize that ain't
[1:40:03] darkness is getting greater it's light
[1:40:05] that's getting greater and light is
[1:40:07] behind the darkness and it's pushing
[1:40:10] pushing pushing pushing and darkness is
[1:40:13] trying to hold and darkness is trying to
[1:40:15] hold but light will prevail
[1:40:18] and it's going to break through one
[1:40:19] glorious day and out of that line amen a
[1:40:22] little 19 year old woman named karen
[1:40:24] pruitt is going to step out and tap us
[1:40:27] on the shoulder a little man called
[1:40:29] jerry show is going to step out and tap
[1:40:31] you on the shoulder
[1:40:33] hallelujah light is pushing light is
[1:40:37] pushing i'm not going to fight against
[1:40:39] the light i'm going to stand with the
[1:40:41] light
[1:40:42] i'm going to stand with what it has and
[1:40:45] say god
