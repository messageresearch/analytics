[37:23] hearts that are ready Lord to get up and
[37:25] go ready to respond to the call and
[37:28] return home Lord where we're truly from
[37:30] because we're just pilgrims and

[37:38] service anoint my lips Lord Lord you saw
[37:41] Lord what you laid on my heart I'm just
[37:43] asking you'll help me to deliver it Lord
[37:44] in a right Spirit Lord understanding
[37:47] Lord that this is a late hour and it's
[37:49] time to go and we don't have time to
[37:51] play with the world we don't have time
[37:52] to flirt with the world
[37:54] but lord it's going home time
[37:56] hold I just pray that you'll take
[37:58] control of this service now each person
[38:00] each Heart Lord in Jesus name we pray
[38:02] amen
[38:04] amen if you have your Bibles with you
[38:06] tonight we're going to look into the
[38:07] book of Ezra
[38:09] first chapter the first verse
[38:12] and we'll be reading quite a few
[38:15] scriptures as we go
[38:17] may even read some from a few historical
[38:20] accounts
[38:22] you know the Lord lays things on your
[38:23] heart sometimes and I I was even telling
[38:26] brother Tim earlier tonight I said you
[38:27] know and within ourselves as human
[38:29] beings what we always want to do is
[38:31] preach the people happy you always want
[38:33] to come with something within yourself
[38:35] that that is going to make everybody
[38:37] happy but the thoughts that the Lord
[38:39] gives you isn't always that way and so
[38:42] you know um I was sitting there in his
[38:45] sermon Sunday really blessed me because
[38:47] the Lord was already leaning me in this
[38:48] direction and
[38:50] and as he preached that it just really
[38:51] confirmed to me where I was supposed to
[38:53] go so you just join in with me tonight
[38:55] and we'll and we'll Feast on the word of
[38:58] God
[38:59] Ezra 1-1
[39:01] says now in the first year of Cyrus King
[39:04] of Persia that the word of the Lord by
[39:06] the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled
[39:08] the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus
[39:11] King of Persia that he made a
[39:13] proclamation throughout all his kingdom
[39:16] and put it also in writing saying thus
[39:19] say Osiris King of Persia the Lord God
[39:21] Of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms
[39:23] of the earth and he had charged me to
[39:25] build him a house at Jerusalem which is
[39:27] in Judah who is there among you of all
[39:31] his people his God be with him and let
[39:34] him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah
[39:37] and build the house of the Lord God of
[39:39] Israel he is the god which is in
[39:42] Jerusalem amen you have your seats
[39:45] tonight we just ask the Lord to add His
[39:47] blessings
[39:49] to the reading of his word
[39:53] amen what we're seeing here what we're
[39:55] looking at is we read this scripture
[39:57] we have come to the end of the
[39:59] Babylonian Empire
[40:01] and the beginning of the Persian Empire
[40:05] we know that up until this time the Jews
[40:08] have been serving the king of Babylon
[40:09] for 70 years just as the Prophet
[40:12] Jeremiah had foretold in Jeremiah 25 and
[40:16] it says in Jeremiah 25 11 and this whole
[40:19] land shall be a desolation and an
[40:22] astonishment and these nations Shall
[40:25] Serve the king of Babylon 70 years
[40:28] the Scripture it also told that Babylon
[40:31] itself would be destroyed he that it
[40:34] would be destroyed and that the Lord
[40:35] would pour out his wrath upon that
[40:37] nation and recompense them according to
[40:40] their deeds and it says in Jeremiah 25
[40:42] 12 and it shall come to pass when 70
[40:45] years are accomplished that I will
[40:47] punish the king of Babylon and that
[40:49] Nation saith the Lord for their iniquity
[40:52] and the land of the Chaldeans and will
[40:54] make it perpetual desolations and one
[40:58] thing that I want to point out right
[40:59] here even as before we go any further is
[41:02] that in your life and on this Earth to
[41:05] all Humanity the devil has not gotten
[41:07] away with one thing there is not one
[41:10] thing that he's gotten away with the
[41:12] Lord says that I'm going to use Babylon
[41:14] I'm going to use King Nebuchadnezzar to
[41:16] punish you for your evil Deeds he says
[41:19] you have not heard all of my words you
[41:21] have not regarded my judgments and
[41:23] because of that I'm going to allow these
[41:25] things to happen to you I'm going to use
[41:27] Babylon as my instrument are meant but
[41:29] then I'm going to punish that King and
[41:32] that Nation for their iniquities and
[41:34] what they do unto you and if we look
[41:36] back we know that man was in the mess
[41:38] that we're in tonight because of the
[41:40] fall and Satan has had this run because
[41:43] of the fall and because of the deception
[41:45] that he brought in the beginning but it
[41:47] was because of man's decisions we're in
[41:50] this mess because of man man did this
[41:52] and God says okay you chose wrong and
[41:55] you've done wrong and you didn't listen
[41:56] to my word and because of that things
[41:59] are going to be hard things are going to
[42:01] be difficult and Satan is going to do
[42:03] some awful things but I promise you he
[42:05] says Satan will not win he may do this
[42:09] and he may do that and he may make
[42:10] things very hard but I promise you that
[42:13] the prayers of the Saints are being
[42:14] stored up there's not one that's been
[42:16] forgotten he has not gotten away with
[42:19] one thing in your life sometimes it
[42:21] seems like he's gained a toe hold
[42:22] sometimes it seems like things are going
[42:24] his way but if you'll just look in the
[42:26] back of the book he has not gotten a way
[42:29] with one single thing he will be paid
[42:32] back for all that he has done to God's
[42:34] children
[42:36] so God tells him he says I will visit
[42:38] you and perform my good word towards you
[42:41] in causing you to return to this place
[42:44] talking about the Homeland that they're
[42:46] being taken captive from listen he says
[42:49] I'm not going to leave you in that
[42:50] sinful condition Satan has had him he's
[42:53] doing his work and he's got Satan's
[42:55] eating but I'm not gonna leave you there
[42:57] but I will visit you I will bring my
[43:00] good word to pass he says because I know
[43:02] the thoughts that I have towards you he
[43:05] says I'm going to bring you back I'm
[43:06] going to pour out my wrath upon this
[43:09] Kingdom and upon this King but I'm going
[43:11] to bring you back to where you came from
[43:15] Israel had gone into captivity because
[43:18] they had fallen away from the one true
[43:20] and living God
[43:23] had done everything that he could to get
[43:25] the people of Israel to repent
[43:27] he had sent servants he had Sent His
[43:30] prophets and they had come and told them
[43:31] to turn from their evil ways he had told
[43:34] them to stay true to the Lord he had
[43:36] told them over and over and he was very
[43:38] long-suffering with them but they would
[43:40] not turn they would not repent they
[43:43] would not quit flirting with the world
[43:46] so we see in Jeremiah 25 and 5.
[43:49] they said turn ye again now every one
[43:51] from his evil way from the evil of your
[43:54] doings and dwell in the land that the
[43:57] Lord hath given unto you and to your
[43:59] fathers forever and ever and go not
[44:02] after other gods to serve them and to
[44:05] worship them and provoke me not to anger
[44:07] with the works of your hands and I will
[44:09] do you no hurt and yet Israel
[44:12] continued to sin they continued to to to
[44:16] not hearken to the voice of the Lord and
[44:19] in so doing they fall into the Judgment
[44:22] of the Lord they continue to flirt with
[44:25] the world even though a prophet told
[44:27] them not to
[44:28] hello somebody
[44:31] they continue to flirt with the world
[44:33] they continue to pursue other gods even
[44:36] though the word told them not to listen
[44:39] one thing we have to come to to
[44:40] recognize is that sowing and reaping is
[44:43] a law of God
[44:44] there are consequences to your decisions
[44:47] there are consequences to your actions
[44:50] many times we look around we say why God
[44:53] why God why God and the answer is you
[44:58] you know I hate to be that way but we
[44:59] have to be real with ourselves so many
[45:02] times it's the devil and the devil and
[45:03] the devil and the devil didn't even do
[45:05] it
[45:06] you did it why am I here Lord because
[45:08] you chose to be there
[45:10] why am I going through this situation
[45:12] because that's the road you chose
[45:15] there is sowing and reaping to every
[45:18] decision that you make in your life we
[45:21] cannot flirt with the World Church
[45:24] we cannot act like the world we cannot
[45:27] dress like the world we can't give the
[45:29] world in worldly pleasures all of our
[45:31] time and then just expect God to
[45:33] continue blessing you continue
[45:35] protecting you continue in this umbrella
[45:38] where Satan can't get to you there comes
[45:40] a time where if you act like this
[45:42] Kingdom
[45:43] and you live like this Kingdom and you
[45:46] dress like this Kingdom then but you
[45:48] can't expect the protection from that
[45:50] Kingdom
[45:51] he says if you want to look that part
[45:53] and play that part and act that part
[45:55] then you get that part with them
[45:57] we have to recognize that we can't keep
[46:00] flirting with the world
[46:02] you can't just expect the blessings to
[46:04] continue especially when you identify
[46:06] more with the kingdom of the world than
[46:08] you do with the kingdom of God
[46:12] you're going to have to reap what you
[46:15] sow
[46:16] brother Brown says then these Brethren
[46:18] who has gone away from the promised land
[46:20] down into Babylon carried away because
[46:22] their sins had separated them from God
[46:25] in other words he didn't say because the
[46:27] Babylonians did this why were they in
[46:29] Babylon their sins
[46:32] their sins had separated them from God
[46:34] he says that I'm just old-fashioned
[46:37] enough to believe tonight this that when
[46:39] the church or any individual begins to
[46:42] play and flirt with the world you're
[46:44] going to have the same experience
[46:47] you get away from God you get away from
[46:49] truth he's saying your sins will
[46:51] separate you from God he says when you
[46:53] get away from God and you begin to flirt
[46:55] with the world and do things of the
[46:56] world you're going to have the exact
[46:57] same experience that Israel had
[46:59] somebody's going to come in and take you
[47:01] some spirit's going to come in and take
[47:03] you something's going to come and bind
[47:05] you up something's going to carry you
[47:07] out of the house of God it's going to
[47:08] carry you out from the protection of the
[47:10] of the word it's going to carry you out
[47:12] from the protection of your brothers and
[47:14] sisters when you continually flirt with
[47:17] the world brother Brandon says when you
[47:19] get away from God when you get away from
[47:21] truth you're about to end up in the
[47:23] exact same place that Israel ended up in
[47:26] captivity bound up your flirtations will
[47:30] always lead you further than you ever
[47:32] intended to go
[47:34] because you take that first step and
[47:36] you're scared and you're like oh I
[47:37] wasn't supposed to do that but then you
[47:38] take it again and you get a little bit
[47:39] more comfortable there
[47:41] and and everything's okay you know God
[47:43] didn't strike me dead I'm okay and
[47:45] eventually you go further and further
[47:47] and what happens is your conscience
[47:49] becomes seared
[47:51] to where things that used to be little
[47:54] things now are nothing
[47:57] and things that used to be big things
[47:59] are now little things
[48:01] and you progress in sin and you progress
[48:03] in your flirtation to where it becomes
[48:05] much more than a flirtation you become
[48:07] identified with the things of the world
[48:11] your flirtations will take you to a
[48:13] place of captivity
[48:15] take you to a place of slavery and
[48:17] imprisonment and when you get there
[48:19] there will be no joy there
[48:21] 'll be no Victory there there'll be no
[48:24] overcoming life there in that place you
[48:26] are defeated
[48:28] what are you saying brother I'm saying
[48:29] break your flirtations with the world go
[48:32] with our whole heart into the word go
[48:34] with your whole heart into serving the
[48:35] lord recognize there is but one true and
[48:37] living God well brother and I don't
[48:39] serve other gods what do you do with
[48:41] your time
[48:42] what do you do with your time what Idols
[48:45] you have lifted up in your life what
[48:47] Idols of Hollywood or Idols of
[48:49] entertainment what other gods are there
[48:51] that's drawing you away pulling you away
[48:53] to where God's looking at he's a jealous
[48:55] God
[48:56] and you've turned your back and you've
[48:58] got time for this and time for that and
[49:00] time for that but I just can't make it
[49:01] on Wednesday I'm too busy you aren't
[49:03] busy For Your Entertainment you aren't
[49:05] busy for your fun you are busy for your
[49:08] job but you look at this listen when
[49:10] you're proud you will always fulfill
[49:12] your priorities period
[49:15] you will always fulfill your priorities
[49:18] period if you didn't read your Bibles
[49:20] because it's not a priority if you
[49:22] didn't pray it's not a priority if
[49:24] you're not at church it's because it's
[49:25] not a priority
[49:34] and in that place you get drug away to
[49:36] where you're living in a lukewarm place
[49:37] and you don't even realize it but you're
[49:38] captive
[49:40] and you're bound up and there's no joy
[49:42] there and there's no Victory there but I
[49:43] don't want to leave you in that place
[49:44] tonight I want to tell you you don't
[49:45] have to stay there tonight you don't
[49:47] have to stay in that place tonight you
[49:49] don't have to stay bound tonight you
[49:50] don't have to stay defeated tonight I'm
[49:52] thankful you don't got to stay there but
[49:54] there's one who came and made a way
[49:55] there's Mercy for you tonight there's
[49:57] Grace for you tonight there's
[49:58] Deliverance for you tonight but you have
[50:01] to accept it you have to make the move
[50:03] you have to walk towards it tonight if
[50:06] you've been taken captive if your
[50:08] victory's been robbed if your Joy's been
[50:10] robbed if your dance is long forgotten
[50:12] if you've backslidden into captivity
[50:14] don't stay there tonight there's one
[50:16] saying come home I want to bring you
[50:18] back home I want to bring you back to
[50:20] the cross I want to bring you back to
[50:22] fellowship I want to bring you back to
[50:24] where you were robbed from where you
[50:26] were taken from he wants to bring you
[50:29] back home tonight you don't have to stay
[50:31] in that condition
[50:33] Jeremiah 29 and 10.
[50:36] for thus saith the Lord
[50:39] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[50:41] Babylon I will visit you
[50:43] and perform my good word towards you in
[50:46] causing you to return to this place
[50:50] for I know the thoughts that I think
[50:52] towards you saith the Lord thoughts of
[50:53] peace and not of evil to give you an
[50:55] expected end
[50:57] what he's prophesying of
[50:59] is the end of the Babylonian Kingdom
[51:03] and there's a new king coming
[51:06] there's a Persian king coming
[51:08] oh come on Church you were bought you
[51:11] were taken into slavery you were taken
[51:12] into sin you had to serve that King you
[51:15] were Bound by that King but there's
[51:16] another king coming there's another
[51:18] kingdom coming there's one on the way
[51:20] that's going to break your bonds there's
[51:22] one on the way that's going to set you
[51:23] free there's another king coming to
[51:26] crush this Kingdom there's another King
[51:29] on his way
[51:32] let's go back to the beginning
[51:35] in the beginning man was taken captive
[51:37] of his own decisions
[51:39] he flirted with the world
[51:42] she flirted and she sidestepped one word
[51:44] of God
[51:47] what did Brother Branham say when you do
[51:48] that same experience
[51:51] same experience
[51:53] and so what you find just as Israel is
[51:55] taking down into Babylon
[51:57] we see that man is exiled from God
[52:00] man is carried away from the guard man
[52:02] is carried out of his presence
[52:04] and now they're serving another king
[52:07] now they're servants to death
[52:09] there was reaping now that must be done
[52:11] there was captivity there was sorrow
[52:13] Satan now ruled Satan now accept
[52:15] Authority
[52:17] brother Brown says sickness disease
[52:19] Affliction sin everything held the
[52:21] little group of Adam's race at Bay that
[52:23] no one could do nothing about where the
[52:25] law and the judgments and the prophets
[52:27] and everything that had been sent had
[52:28] failed nothing could be done human race
[52:31] was doomed the great armies of hell was
[52:34] marching on well trained and in their
[52:36] ranks every man to his place
[52:39] we were held captives
[52:41] we were held captive but there was a
[52:43] word that said there's another king
[52:45] coming it's equal saw him as a will in
[52:49] the middle of the wheel Daniel saw him
[52:51] as a stone hoot out of the mountain
[52:52] without hands Abraham ate with him
[52:54] underneath the tree there in mammary oh
[52:57] the prophets prophesied of him there's
[53:00] one coming that will perform his good
[53:02] word because he knows the thoughts that
[53:04] he has of you he's not going to leave
[53:06] you bound he's not going to leave you in
[53:07] captivity but he's coming to break your
[53:10] shackles there's another kingdom come in
[53:12] and he says I'll take you back home I'll
[53:15] take you back to where you were once at
[53:20] the Yoke of the oppressor is broken
[53:23] and that doesn't just go
[53:26] for Sinners tonight
[53:28] foreign
[53:31] it's not just Sinners that need to go
[53:32] back
[53:35] it's not just people off the street that
[53:37] don't know God that need to return
[53:42] you know good and well
[53:43] there's a lot of us who haven't returned
[53:45] all the way
[53:49] there's a lot of us that haven't gone
[53:51] all the way back to where the message
[53:52] was taking us to
[53:55] all the way back to the land of the Holy
[53:57] Ghost all the way back to the land of
[53:59] all things are possible
[54:01] all the way back to everything that
[54:03] Jesus died for back to every Redemptive
[54:05] blessed back to the faith of the fathers
[54:08] some of us still got some ways to go
[54:10] some of us may be a turn but he wants to
[54:12] take us all the way back all the way
[54:14] back not just part of the way not just a
[54:17] little bit he's not leaving us out here
[54:18] in the wilderness he wants you to cross
[54:20] over he says I'm taking you back I'm
[54:23] taking you where you came from this is
[54:25] not your home there's another home and I
[54:27] want you to go back I want you to go
[54:30] back come home All My Children
[54:33] he wants to take you back tonight
[54:36] but in order to go back there
[54:38] we got to go back where the message was
[54:40] taking us to
[54:42] you're not going to go back there if you
[54:44] don't go back now
[54:49] Cyrus the King of Persia
[54:52] had arrived in 539 BC
[54:56] and he crushed the Babylonian Kingdom
[55:00] then we'll go back to Ezra one
[55:03] and verse 1.
[55:06] now in the first year of Cyrus King of
[55:08] Persia he's come in and he's taken
[55:10] control that the word of the Lord by the
[55:13] mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the
[55:15] Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King
[55:16] of Persia
[55:18] that he made a proclamation throughout
[55:19] all his kingdom and put it also into
[55:21] writing saying thus say Osiris King of
[55:24] Persia the Lord God Of Heaven hath given
[55:26] me all the kingdoms of the Earth
[55:28] he had charged me to build him a house
[55:30] at Jerusalem which is in Judah
[55:32] now notice
[55:34] Here Comes The Challenge
[55:36] who is there among you
[55:40] of all his people his God be with him
[55:43] and let him go up to Jerusalem which is
[55:47] in Judah and build the house of the Lord
[55:49] God of Israel he is the god which is in
[55:52] Jerusalem
[55:54] years ago before my daughter Aaliyah was
[55:56] born brother Tim preached a sermon about
[55:58] this
[55:59] but this word
[56:01] go up or Ascension
[56:04] the Hebrew word is Aaliyah
[56:07] today today it commonly refers to the
[56:10] act of Jewish people returning to live
[56:12] in Israel from other parts of the world
[56:15] if they if they go back to their
[56:16] Homeland it said they've taken an Aliyah
[56:19] and they've returned to their Homeland
[56:21] and the call of Cyrus here the King of
[56:23] Persia down Through the Ages has been
[56:26] used as an adage for an Aliyah very
[56:29] specifically this scripture
[56:31] speaks of via Leah it speaks of it again
[56:33] in second chronicles 36 and 23 thus
[56:37] saith Cyrus King of Persia all the
[56:40] kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God
[56:41] Of Heaven given me and he had charged me
[56:44] to build him a house in Jerusalem which
[56:46] is in Judah who is there among you of
[56:49] all his people the Lord his God be with
[56:51] him and let him go up
[56:54] or let him take an Aaliyah he says now
[57:00] tonight this is where the rubber is
[57:02] going to meet the road
[57:04] because the challenge goes out who is
[57:06] there among you
[57:08] who's willing to return
[57:10] not who's there among you that's willing
[57:12] to say I believe the message no that's
[57:13] not what he said
[57:15] it was a proclamation the whole nation
[57:17] heard it they knew it was true it was
[57:20] signed by the king
[57:22] there was no debate as to whether or not
[57:24] this edict was from the King but he's
[57:26] saying who will go
[57:28] who's willing to take the challenge
[57:30] who's willing to go back this is where
[57:33] that we can we see that your shackles
[57:35] can be completely broken the prison
[57:37] doors completely opened but you still
[57:39] have to walk out
[57:41] you can see your captor defeated a
[57:43] message of Freedom delivered by the king
[57:45] and you still have to be willing to go
[57:51] history says if we were to attach a
[57:53] percentage
[57:55] perhaps those who left Babylon
[57:57] now Persia it would amount to no more
[58:00] than 10 percent
[58:02] possibly as little as five percent
[58:04] that is 90 to 95 percent of Jews who had
[58:08] been living in the Babylonian Empire by
[58:11] their own choice elected not to return
[58:14] home
[58:19] we'll stay here
[58:22] we believe the message brother Brown's a
[58:24] prophet but I'm not going all the way
[58:26] back there
[58:27] I'm not going all the way back to
[58:29] Pentecost
[58:31] I'm not following I'll follow it as far
[58:33] as that we're not a denomination I'll
[58:36] follow it as far as dress code
[58:38] but I'm not going all the way back
[58:41] I'm too comfortable right here
[58:44] where I'm at
[58:47] tonight we're speaking to you on the
[58:49] Comforts of Babylon
[58:51] the comforts
[58:53] of Babylon
[58:55] I read this and I thought
[58:57] wait what
[58:59] 95 percent declined to go
[59:06] and the reason is because for most of
[59:08] them Babylon was home
[59:13] they were no longer looking at
[59:15] themselves as pilgrims and strangers
[59:19] they were looking at themselves as this
[59:21] is where we live
[59:22] the Jews had assimilated and they were
[59:25] now in harmony with their new
[59:26] surroundings God forbid that we can ever
[59:28] become in harmony with the surroundings
[59:31] of this world
[59:32] they were now in harmony they were
[59:34] generally at peace with the Persians the
[59:38] medes and the scores of other ethnic
[59:40] cultures that formed the empire
[59:43] it doesn't even really seem possible
[59:46] how it got to this point these people
[59:48] that had yearned to go home
[59:51] these people that when it first started
[59:53] out and they and they were called out of
[59:54] denominations all they wanted was to go
[59:56] home
[59:57] all they wanted was was the power of God
[1:00:00] in their services
[1:00:01] all they wanted was to leave this place
[1:00:04] all they wanted was to get back home
[1:00:06] with the Lord Jesus these people yearned
[1:00:09] for whom they were pilgrims and they
[1:00:11] were strangers and they said we don't
[1:00:12] belong here
[1:00:14] they had once been so homesick that they
[1:00:17] struggled to even Worship in Babylon
[1:00:19] they couldn't worship
[1:00:23] Psalms 137 1 says by the Rivers of
[1:00:26] Babylon
[1:00:27] there we sat down yea we wept when we
[1:00:31] remembered Zion
[1:00:33] oh they wanted to go back
[1:00:36] we hanged our Harps upon the Willows in
[1:00:38] the midst thereof they couldn't even
[1:00:40] sing the songs of Zion
[1:00:43] they were so homesick they were so
[1:00:45] broken to think about it just hurt them
[1:00:46] so much
[1:00:49] for there they that carried us away
[1:00:51] captive required of us a song
[1:00:53] and they that wasted us required of us
[1:00:55] Merc saying sing us one of the songs of
[1:00:57] Zion oh they were being mocked
[1:01:01] I was saying about your great God now
[1:01:04] sing about your great king Now sing
[1:01:05] about your Homeland now
[1:01:07] oh and it hurts so bad
[1:01:10] how so we sing the Lord's song In a
[1:01:12] Strange Land
[1:01:14] if I forget thee o Jerusalem let my
[1:01:17] right hand forget her cunning
[1:01:20] if I do not remember thee let my tongue
[1:01:22] cleave to the roof of my mouth if I
[1:01:24] prefer not Jerusalem above my chief Joy
[1:01:28] remember O Lord the children of Edom in
[1:01:30] the day of Jerusalem who said raise it
[1:01:32] raise it even to the foundation thereof
[1:01:35] oh daughter of Babylon who art to be
[1:01:37] destroyed happy shall he be that
[1:01:40] rewardeth thee as thou has served us
[1:01:42] happy shall he be that taketh and
[1:01:44] dashest thy little ones against the
[1:01:46] stones
[1:01:48] does this sound like people that are
[1:01:50] wanting to stay in Babylon
[1:01:53] does this sound like people that are
[1:01:55] happy and content
[1:01:58] and after a while many of the ones who
[1:02:00] originally had come died off and you had
[1:02:04] generations of those who had never
[1:02:06] experienced the Homeland for themselves
[1:02:09] they had never experienced freedom for
[1:02:12] themselves they had been bound up and
[1:02:14] held captive in dead churches their
[1:02:16] entire life
[1:02:17] the movement of the spirit was just a
[1:02:19] story
[1:02:21] the healings of people was just a story
[1:02:23] being filled with the Holy Ghost was
[1:02:25] just a story they had been captive their
[1:02:27] whole life and so they were comfortable
[1:02:29] where they were
[1:02:30] they were okay where they were they were
[1:02:33] born in Babylon
[1:02:34] it was all they knew everything was just
[1:02:37] a story
[1:02:38] and so when the king made the call to go
[1:02:40] up listen Israel knew how difficult this
[1:02:43] would be they knew the condition of the
[1:02:45] Homeland
[1:02:46] they knew between here and there there
[1:02:48] was no safety they knew it would be a
[1:02:50] difficult Journey they knew there was so
[1:02:52] much work to be done once they returned
[1:02:55] they knew the road was long and hard
[1:03:00] and when you're surrounded by difficulty
[1:03:02] and you're surrounded by laodicea and
[1:03:05] evil and sin and lukewarmness is all
[1:03:07] around and it's harder than ever to take
[1:03:09] in Aaliyah it's harder than ever to go
[1:03:12] up if all of this is just a story to you
[1:03:15] if all of this is just a story if it's
[1:03:18] not a reality to you then you're going
[1:03:19] to sit back and go no I'm good
[1:03:21] I'll stay in the condition I currently
[1:03:23] find myself in
[1:03:25] oh brother Aaron have you ever been to
[1:03:27] that home and know I've never been there
[1:03:28] but I've been in contact with it it's
[1:03:31] not just a story it's a reality and when
[1:03:34] it becomes a reality you don't care the
[1:03:35] hardship you don't care what you go
[1:03:37] through you don't care about the mocking
[1:03:39] I want to go back I want to be there I
[1:03:42] want to live there forever that's my
[1:03:44] home I can't stay here I'm not
[1:03:46] comfortable here the sins of this world
[1:03:49] make me sick I just want to go back
[1:03:52] because I've been in contact with that
[1:03:54] place
[1:03:55] but if you haven't and it's just a story
[1:03:59] then are you willing to fight for a
[1:04:00] story
[1:04:02] are you willing to give your life for
[1:04:03] what may be true
[1:04:06] it's got to be a reality to you
[1:04:10] you have to contact a living God for
[1:04:12] yourself
[1:04:15] because if you don't when it comes time
[1:04:17] to take the journey you're going to stay
[1:04:18] right
[1:04:20] Where You Are
[1:04:26] at first they hated Babylon
[1:04:29] at first they dreamed of home they
[1:04:32] prayed for home
[1:04:33] still in Psalms 137 verse 4 read this
[1:04:36] again how shall we sing the Lord's song
[1:04:38] In a Strange Land
[1:04:40] they say if I forget thee o Jerusalem
[1:04:42] let my right hand forget her cunning if
[1:04:44] I if I do not remember thee let my
[1:04:46] tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth
[1:04:49] if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief
[1:04:51] Joy
[1:04:52] oh they longed for home
[1:04:54] it was their desire at that point to be
[1:04:57] in every service
[1:05:00] it was their desire at that point
[1:05:03] to pray every night
[1:05:05] they craved devotion time in the
[1:05:08] presence of their maker
[1:05:10] they couldn't wait till the doors open
[1:05:11] on Wednesday night
[1:05:13] it was their desire to serve him with
[1:05:15] their whole heart
[1:05:19] but soon they began to become focused on
[1:05:21] tarrying in Babylon
[1:05:25] you say brother Aaron we have to live
[1:05:27] we have to go about our regular life we
[1:05:30] have to have a house we have to have a
[1:05:31] car we have to have some pleasures
[1:05:34] that's fine I won't argue with that but
[1:05:37] you can never allow those things to
[1:05:39] replace your desire to leave here
[1:05:42] to replace your desire to go home
[1:05:45] you know Israel was actually given
[1:05:47] instruction to do just that they were
[1:05:49] given instruction to Terry
[1:05:51] they were given instruction to plant
[1:05:53] their potatoes as it were
[1:05:55] they were given instruction to thrive
[1:05:57] where they were at while they were there
[1:06:01] here are the instructions Jeremiah 29
[1:06:03] and 4.
[1:06:05] the prophet says to him thus saith the
[1:06:08] Lord of hosts the god of Israel until
[1:06:10] all that are carried away captives whom
[1:06:12] I have caused to be carried away from
[1:06:14] Jerusalem unto Babylon
[1:06:16] build ye houses and dwell in them and
[1:06:20] plant Gardens and eat the fruit of them
[1:06:23] take ye wives and beget sons and
[1:06:26] daughters and take wives for your sons
[1:06:27] give your daughters to husbands that
[1:06:30] they may bear sons and daughters that
[1:06:31] you may be increased there
[1:06:34] and not diminished and seek the peace of
[1:06:37] the city whether I have caused you to be
[1:06:39] carried away captives and pray unto the
[1:06:41] Lord for it for in the peace thereof
[1:06:44] shall ye have peace
[1:06:47] oh brother Aaron it sounds like they
[1:06:48] were doing exactly what they were told
[1:06:50] to do
[1:06:51] they were
[1:06:52] that's exactly what they were told to do
[1:06:54] but in so doing they lose focus
[1:06:58] verse 10 is the important part
[1:07:00] for it thus saith the Lord after 70
[1:07:03] years be accomplished at Babylon I will
[1:07:06] visit you and perform my good word
[1:07:08] toward you in causing you to return to
[1:07:11] this place
[1:07:13] they lose focus on this right here it
[1:07:16] became about tearing it became about
[1:07:18] being successful here it came about
[1:07:20] staying here how comfortable can we be
[1:07:22] here instead of he's coming back he's
[1:07:25] coming back and he's going to take us
[1:07:27] home yes I want to provide for my family
[1:07:29] yes I want a good living but he's coming
[1:07:31] back this is all the atomic father it's
[1:07:34] all gonna burn I want Eternal things
[1:07:37] he's coming back
[1:07:43] they get too caught up in the tearing
[1:07:47] too busy to think about leaving
[1:07:50] too busy for Wednesday nights
[1:07:57] they get comfortable in Babylon
[1:08:03] why shouldn't the opportunity to return
[1:08:05] to the promised land
[1:08:07] Why didn't it cause a mass Exodus from
[1:08:10] Babylon
[1:08:13] total I believe the scripture puts it at
[1:08:15] about 42 to 43 000 that came back out of
[1:08:18] Millions
[1:08:21] and they didn't all come at once
[1:08:23] they came in four different alias
[1:08:27] they didn't all just up and decide to
[1:08:29] leave
[1:08:31] they had become full and active members
[1:08:33] of the Babylonian Society
[1:08:36] many prospered
[1:08:38] so many second and third generation
[1:08:40] Jewish Babylonians
[1:08:45] had no interest in leaving
[1:08:47] that term their Jewish Babylonians
[1:08:49] struck me sounded a lot like message
[1:08:51] laodiceans
[1:08:56] they were no longer Jews of the Homeland
[1:08:58] they were Jewish Babylonians
[1:09:02] guys we can't be layout of sin this
[1:09:04] bride will by no means be a laodicea
[1:09:08] you have to break free of that tonight
[1:09:10] there's a king that broke those chains
[1:09:12] there's a king that said you don't have
[1:09:13] to stay here you can go back to the
[1:09:15] Homeland you can go back but you ain't
[1:09:17] gonna get back staying where you're at
[1:09:18] you're not going to get free staying
[1:09:20] where you're at you got to be willing to
[1:09:22] move you got to be willing to admit
[1:09:24] where you are before you'll be willing
[1:09:26] to move that's the problem that's why so
[1:09:29] many people don't Journey on and take
[1:09:30] another step because they can't admit
[1:09:32] where they're at and they're lukewarm
[1:09:33] and they're backslidden and they're cold
[1:09:34] and they're formal
[1:09:37] and so they stay in Babylon
[1:09:44] message layout of sins
[1:09:46] identifying as message but never
[1:09:49] breaking free from the hold of laodicea
[1:09:53] accumulating too much stuff along the
[1:09:55] journey and it keeps you from crossing
[1:09:58] over
[1:09:59] that's exactly what happened with Reuben
[1:10:01] and Gad and we dealt with that a few
[1:10:03] months back to where along the journey
[1:10:05] in the wilderness they had accumulated
[1:10:07] so many herds
[1:10:08] and they had so many animals that when
[1:10:10] they saw the grasslands on this side of
[1:10:12] the Jordan they said well it'd be better
[1:10:14] for us if we don't cross over
[1:10:16] I'm more comfortable on this side than I
[1:10:18] am in the promised land because of
[1:10:20] everything I've accumulated because of
[1:10:22] all My Success because of all the
[1:10:24] blessings I have don't let your
[1:10:26] blessings become a curse
[1:10:29] the Rich Young Ruler was mighty blessed
[1:10:32] but it's the blessings that turned into
[1:10:33] a curse that took him straight to hell
[1:10:34] because he couldn't walk away from him
[1:10:36] don't let your blessings be a curse
[1:10:39] don't let them make you comfortable here
[1:10:44] you can't get to listen look I don't
[1:10:46] know if you looked around lately church
[1:10:47] but things are getting pretty bad things
[1:10:49] are getting pretty awful if you're still
[1:10:51] comfortable here it makes me wonder
[1:10:52] about the spirit on the inside of you
[1:10:54] how can you be comfortable here I want
[1:10:56] to declare tonight we can't stay here
[1:10:58] much longer we can't stay here the fire
[1:11:01] is gonna fall and somebody's gonna take
[1:11:04] it Aaliyah somebody's gonna Ascend
[1:11:06] somebody's gonna go back somebody's
[1:11:08] going home you can't stay here much
[1:11:11] longer turn your focus from staying and
[1:11:14] turn your focus into leave it here go
[1:11:17] home go home go home
[1:11:20] go back
[1:11:24] we can't get comfortable here
[1:11:26] there's a call tonight there's been an
[1:11:29] edict by the king and he says who will
[1:11:31] go up
[1:11:33] who will take an Aaliyah who will do the
[1:11:35] Lord's work
[1:11:36] but Israel had settled down and got
[1:11:38] comfortable where they were because well
[1:11:40] we're God's chosen people
[1:11:43] we're in the message
[1:11:46] yet first it was awful in this foreign
[1:11:48] land you remember how it was when you
[1:11:50] first got saved when you first got that
[1:11:53] first touch of the Holy Spirit you
[1:11:55] wanted nothing to do with the world
[1:11:56] prayer was easy church was all you look
[1:11:59] forward to all week because you were
[1:12:01] miserable in a foreign land you didn't
[1:12:03] feel at home until you came into the
[1:12:04] presence of God
[1:12:07] and yet in this condition at first they
[1:12:10] pressed on
[1:12:12] and they even the the histories would
[1:12:14] say they maintained their National
[1:12:15] Spirit that's good
[1:12:17] and their religious identity they
[1:12:19] maintained it even in the midst of the
[1:12:21] persecutions even as the Babylonians
[1:12:24] would mock them sing us one of your
[1:12:26] songs
[1:12:27] but they hung their harps on the willow
[1:12:29] tree because in Babylon songs of Victory
[1:12:31] were hard to sing
[1:12:35] there was no dance in Babylon
[1:12:39] foreign
[1:12:40] at this time there were elders and there
[1:12:43] were prophets such as Ezekiel that kept
[1:12:45] the hope of returning home alive
[1:12:47] scholars believe it was during this time
[1:12:49] that synagogues were established
[1:12:52] no notice this is a good thing
[1:12:57] but they allow it to turn into a curse
[1:13:01] because Services began to be held they
[1:13:04] observed holidays in these synagogues
[1:13:06] they prayed in these synagogues they
[1:13:08] practiced circumcision here the
[1:13:10] Traditions the Traditions the traditions
[1:13:14] of their religion was carried on in
[1:13:17] these synagogues
[1:13:19] why do I need to go back to the temple
[1:13:22] synagogue right here in Babylon
[1:13:26] we're keeping the Traditions alive
[1:13:29] everything's going just fine right here
[1:13:32] and over time as their oppression
[1:13:33] seemingly got less they began to get
[1:13:35] very comfortable staying in Babylon and
[1:13:38] practicing their religion in a Strange
[1:13:40] Land
[1:13:41] why go home when we have synagogues here
[1:13:43] why go home and we can keep the law here
[1:13:46] and we can worship here why go back when
[1:13:48] we can still go to church and fulfill
[1:13:50] our duties and still be message and we
[1:13:53] can keep all the traditions of the
[1:13:54] message
[1:13:56] why do we have to go back we have this
[1:13:58] and they begin to settle into the
[1:14:00] tradition of the message
[1:14:02] the tradition of the law
[1:14:05] the tradition of what they were supposed
[1:14:07] to be
[1:14:08] they settled into the traditions of the
[1:14:10] Homeland and they began to allow listen
[1:14:14] there's nothing wrong with tradition if
[1:14:16] you're in my house
[1:14:18] my daughter is such
[1:14:21] tradition is very important
[1:14:23] like if you're like on Thanksgiving
[1:14:24] reading this well that's not what we ate
[1:14:26] last Thanksgiving and we have to keep
[1:14:27] tradition
[1:14:29] so I'm not against Traditions but they
[1:14:31] began to allow tradition to satisfy
[1:14:33] their craving for a living God
[1:14:37] they're Traditions began to satisfy them
[1:14:40] and instead of being miserable they
[1:14:42] began to feel comfortable
[1:14:45] instead of an overcoming life they had
[1:14:47] tradition
[1:14:48] instead of the power of God they had
[1:14:51] traditions
[1:14:52] and that tradition bound them
[1:14:57] and now the sum of those who had longed
[1:14:59] in the early years to leave Babylon who
[1:15:02] had longed to get back they had hung
[1:15:04] their Harps up on the willow tree and
[1:15:05] sorrow and now they decided I don't need
[1:15:08] to take my heart down again
[1:15:10] it looks just fine right there
[1:15:12] I don't need Joy on a Wednesday night
[1:15:16] I need you I'm Gonna Leave My harp at
[1:15:18] home I'm just coming to sit because
[1:15:19] that's my tradition
[1:15:22] I don't need my harp why do I need to
[1:15:25] dance in church that's not my tradition
[1:15:28] my tradition is that I come and I sit
[1:15:30] there
[1:15:34] and the Traditions begin to settle in I
[1:15:37] don't need praise
[1:15:39] I don't need to sing and dance I don't
[1:15:41] need to return to the faith of the
[1:15:42] fathers I have my traditions and their
[1:15:46] harp stayed on the willow tree
[1:15:48] and there were many who read the word
[1:15:50] and there were many who read The
[1:15:51] Prophet's message and yet they had no
[1:15:53] intention of leaving
[1:15:56] so there was no victory dance there was
[1:15:58] no shout there was no Deliverance there
[1:15:59] was no worship because they were
[1:16:01] comfortable
[1:16:03] they had their traditions
[1:16:05] brother Brown would say because they
[1:16:06] wouldn't walk after the ordinance of God
[1:16:08] wouldn't keep his Commandments God
[1:16:10] called King Nebuchadnezzar to come in
[1:16:12] and take them captive down into the land
[1:16:14] of Babylon many of us remember the
[1:16:16] famous old story of how they hung their
[1:16:18] harps on the weeping willow tree and
[1:16:20] they could not sing the songs of Zion
[1:16:22] all their victory was lost not because
[1:16:25] that God wanted to take it away from
[1:16:27] them but because their own sin had
[1:16:29] separated them from God that's the
[1:16:31] reason tonight that many of the
[1:16:32] Christians hasn't got the victory is
[1:16:34] because their sins have separated them
[1:16:36] from the blessings cut off out in a
[1:16:39] desert Place alone and our hearts are
[1:16:41] hanging on the weeping willow tree and
[1:16:43] we can't enjoy the songs of the church
[1:16:49] well I don't like that song then people
[1:16:52] run around the church
[1:16:53] and that song just works them people up
[1:16:56] and I don't like that beat I'm sorry
[1:16:58] that you're in Babylon
[1:17:00] I'm sorry that your harp is hung up
[1:17:02] somewhere and you have no Victory and
[1:17:04] you have no dance and you have no shout
[1:17:05] but don't get mad at me because I do
[1:17:09] and I'm also not mad at you for where
[1:17:11] you are I'm just telling you ain't got
[1:17:12] to stay there you can get your harp and
[1:17:14] you can join us you can taste of the
[1:17:16] Homeland and it won't just be a story
[1:17:17] anymore you can taste of the Homeland
[1:17:19] and suddenly you'll have a little bit of
[1:17:21] a shout you'll have a little bit of a
[1:17:22] dance why because you'll have a little
[1:17:24] bit of Victory and then you won't be so
[1:17:26] critical you won't have time to be
[1:17:28] critical because you'll have your own
[1:17:30] shout you'll have your own dance you'll
[1:17:32] have your own Victory and you'll look up
[1:17:33] and you'll be down the road from Babylon
[1:17:36] heading home going home go back home you
[1:17:40] can't go home with your heart still hung
[1:17:43] on the willow tree
[1:17:45] take your heart down enter into worship
[1:17:49] or stay where you're at and die
[1:17:52] [Music]
[1:18:04] and in that condition they lose faith
[1:18:07] and the task of returning home seems
[1:18:09] difficult
[1:18:11] the journey seems too long
[1:18:13] the work that awaits them seems
[1:18:15] overwhelming
[1:18:16] and they get bound up in Comfort
[1:18:19] they get bound up in Tradition
[1:18:22] history says there was another reason
[1:18:23] that so many of these Jews elected to
[1:18:25] stay in Persia
[1:18:26] it's because Judah was a disaster area
[1:18:29] the main city of Jerusalem had its
[1:18:31] defensive walls torn down
[1:18:33] that's exactly why they needed to go
[1:18:34] back and the temple was in shambles
[1:18:37] that's exactly why they needed to go
[1:18:38] back
[1:18:40] there was practically no working economy
[1:18:42] what would the returnees do for a living
[1:18:44] where would they live tents and
[1:18:46] temporary shelters didn't look very
[1:18:47] attractive compared to the well-ordered
[1:18:50] mud brick homes in organized towns and
[1:18:53] Villages that they resideed in in Persia
[1:18:58] you know they didn't have a problem
[1:18:59] staying intense when they were journey
[1:19:00] into the Promised Land
[1:19:02] when their goal was on getting to the
[1:19:04] promised land
[1:19:05] but now no no we don't want to stay in
[1:19:07] that kind of lodging look at our nice
[1:19:09] home who's going to take care of us the
[1:19:11] same God that fed you in the wilderness
[1:19:13] same God that brought water from a rock
[1:19:15] and Rain Mana down out of Heaven the
[1:19:17] same God that seen you through every
[1:19:18] other trial that's the god that's going
[1:19:19] to take care of you don't be comfortable
[1:19:21] in Babylon if you've got to leave a job
[1:19:22] leave a job if you've got to walk away
[1:19:24] from Friends walk away from friends I'm
[1:19:26] no one that'll be closer than a brother
[1:19:27] to you I know one that'll provide for
[1:19:29] you but whatever you got to do get out
[1:19:31] of Babylon get out of Babylon let go of
[1:19:34] your Comforts there's a call to go home
[1:19:37] do whatever you gotta do but you gotta
[1:19:41] leave Babylon
[1:19:47] their trust in God is no longer there
[1:19:49] they're looking at how hard it's going
[1:19:51] to be they're looking at material things
[1:19:53] listen tonight this ain't a message
[1:19:55] against stuff
[1:19:57] this ain't a message against being
[1:19:59] comfortable because you have air
[1:20:00] condition in your house
[1:20:03] amen
[1:20:06] this is about getting comfortable and
[1:20:08] too complacent where you're at in your
[1:20:10] walk
[1:20:12] being comfortable where you're at in
[1:20:14] your walk
[1:20:16] you should be desperate tonight for more
[1:20:18] of God you should be desperate to go
[1:20:20] back you should be desperate to return
[1:20:22] home
[1:20:23] this message didn't come so that just
[1:20:25] that you could stay in a denominational
[1:20:27] mindset
[1:20:28] the message didn't come so you could
[1:20:31] claim message and have the spirit of
[1:20:32] mystery Babylon on you
[1:20:37] sit by comfortable where you're at
[1:20:39] listen there's no victory in your
[1:20:41] comfort
[1:20:43] there's no Victory there in Babylon
[1:20:45] brother Brown says notice when they were
[1:20:47] captured and carried away into Babylon
[1:20:49] because they tried to impersonate the
[1:20:50] nations of the world what a beautiful
[1:20:52] picture today of the church trying to
[1:20:54] impersonate the world out yonder and
[1:20:56] carried away listen to this carried away
[1:20:58] carried away with their living
[1:21:03] the church lives just the same as the
[1:21:05] world does carries on acts just like it
[1:21:07] and everything else claiming to be the
[1:21:09] church you can't do that no sir your
[1:21:11] very life proves what you are
[1:21:13] you can't get so comfortable here that
[1:21:16] you began to live like the Babylonians
[1:21:21] you can't get caught up in living like
[1:21:23] the world you can't get caught up in
[1:21:25] your Pursuits of the world or the jobs
[1:21:28] that these yes you must have a job but
[1:21:30] always remember that we've been called
[1:21:32] to come out of her my people if that job
[1:21:35] will keep you here you need to leave
[1:21:37] that job
[1:21:39] come out of her my people it can't be a
[1:21:42] denominational life it can't be a Sunday
[1:21:45] in Wednesday life
[1:21:47] but here in laodicea that lukewarm
[1:21:49] Spirit tries to lure you to sleep and it
[1:21:52] tries to make you feel comfortable
[1:21:54] and it offers so many pleasures
[1:21:56] it offers so many Pleasures to keep you
[1:21:58] from advancing
[1:22:01] and yet because we got our traditions
[1:22:04] and because we do our duty
[1:22:07] and because we come to church on Sunday
[1:22:09] and Wednesday we feel like we're okay
[1:22:12] but it was their very Traditions that
[1:22:14] gave them a false sense of security
[1:22:17] it was the very traditions and the
[1:22:19] attending the services that made them
[1:22:21] think I don't have to go back
[1:22:26] it was those very things
[1:22:28] that made them think I don't need to go
[1:22:30] back and help with the temple
[1:22:32] I don't need to go back and help rebuild
[1:22:34] the wall
[1:22:35] I don't need to return why go back to
[1:22:37] Pentecost when I can just say I believe
[1:22:39] God sent a prophet
[1:22:44] why go to the upper room why shout and
[1:22:46] dance and do all those things when I can
[1:22:48] just say I believe on the Lord
[1:22:51] why go back because there's an edict
[1:22:53] from the King that says You must go back
[1:22:55] there's an edict from the King that says
[1:22:57] I'm sending you a prophet to turn your
[1:22:58] hearts back that's why you must go back
[1:23:01] it's not up for debate it's not up for
[1:23:03] well I think this and I think this the
[1:23:05] prophet was sent to turn your hearts
[1:23:07] back to the faith of the fathers you
[1:23:10] have no choice but to go back and if you
[1:23:13] won't go back it shows your colors
[1:23:14] brother Brown said that's what separated
[1:23:16] Judas from the others when it came time
[1:23:18] to go to the upper room he couldn't go
[1:23:19] there so when you refuse to go back
[1:23:22] there just look at the company that
[1:23:24] you're choosing to keep
[1:23:27] you are identifying yourself with one
[1:23:30] who will follow Christ up until the
[1:23:32] upper room
[1:23:34] which makes you a betrayer
[1:23:39] that's harsh brother and that's just in
[1:23:41] the west that's what brother Brown said
[1:23:43] that that's what separated him he could
[1:23:46] follow all the way up till
[1:23:48] The Upper Room
[1:23:49] you got to be willing to go all the way
[1:23:51] back
[1:23:52] you gotta be well brother and I don't
[1:23:54] have the Holy Ghost yet are you saying
[1:23:55] I'm Judas no
[1:23:57] I'm not saying that at all I'm saying
[1:23:59] you can't have the attitude of I'm not
[1:24:01] going
[1:24:03] you can't have the attitude of I don't
[1:24:05] need more
[1:24:06] you got to have the attitude of God if
[1:24:08] that's what I gotta have that's what I'm
[1:24:09] getting if that's where I gotta be
[1:24:11] that's where I'm going if you're calling
[1:24:13] me out of this place tonight that's
[1:24:14] where I'm heading I'm gonna do whatever
[1:24:16] you're asking me to do that's what I'm
[1:24:18] saying to you tonight
[1:24:19] that's what I'm saying to you tonight
[1:24:21] don't be like one that says I've got
[1:24:23] enough so I don't need to go anywhere
[1:24:25] you're too comfortable in Babylon
[1:24:28] foreign
[1:24:31] some of the Jews probably refused to
[1:24:33] move due to the Comforts of Babylon this
[1:24:35] is straight out of encyclopedia
[1:24:37] many of them had been born in Babylon
[1:24:39] during the Exile and they knew nothing
[1:24:41] else they were comfortable where they
[1:24:44] were
[1:24:45] what snared them
[1:24:47] what snared them
[1:24:50] the thought that they could have our
[1:24:52] religion in Babylon too
[1:24:57] the thought that I can be a message
[1:24:59] believer in partake of laodicea II no
[1:25:02] you can't
[1:25:04] no you can't what's gonna happen is one
[1:25:06] day there's gonna be a Rapture and
[1:25:07] because there's layout to see it found
[1:25:09] in your heart you're not going
[1:25:11] if you're gonna go then you have to turn
[1:25:13] back now
[1:25:15] you have to return home now
[1:25:18] they were snared by believing that they
[1:25:20] were okay because they were doing what
[1:25:22] Jeremiah the prophet said do they were
[1:25:25] building houses they were taking wives
[1:25:26] they were planting gardens
[1:25:28] are you saying they were snared by the
[1:25:30] message nope
[1:25:32] they were snared by what man made out of
[1:25:35] the message
[1:25:40] be careful
[1:25:42] say what the prophet said
[1:25:45] don't put your own little season into it
[1:25:47] don't put your own little twist to it
[1:25:48] because what men make out of the message
[1:25:51] is what snares people where they're at
[1:25:53] not what the message said not what
[1:25:55] brother Brown taught
[1:25:57] smeared by traditions
[1:26:00] and so because of this they no longer
[1:26:02] sense the need to return to Jerusalem
[1:26:04] and their faith became bound up their
[1:26:06] worship became bound up the tasks seemed
[1:26:08] too hard why do that when I can stay
[1:26:11] right here and still worship
[1:26:13] don't ever let that Spirit of Babylon
[1:26:15] cage up your worship cage up your walk
[1:26:17] cage up your relationship with the Lord
[1:26:19] don't ever get into a lukewarm walk and
[1:26:21] let that Spirit of Babylon of Leia to
[1:26:23] see us settle on your heart don't let it
[1:26:25] come in and bind your faith we got too
[1:26:27] many people sitting around with bound up
[1:26:29] Faith tonight well I don't have any
[1:26:30] faith that's not true Every Man Has a
[1:26:32] Measure of Faith but a lot of us have
[1:26:34] allowed that Faith to be bound up by
[1:26:35] lukewarmus and bound up because why do I
[1:26:37] need one it's time some of us turn our
[1:26:39] faith loose tonight quit speaking in
[1:26:41] doubt well my kids this and my son that
[1:26:43] my daughter this and this sickness and
[1:26:45] that sickness your faith is bound up

[1:27:02] telling you tonight one time if you'll
[1:27:04] just turn and lose if you'll just turn
[1:27:06] your faith loose come out of the cage
[1:27:08] get loose get free go home turn your

[1:27:22] Freedom return to Victory Return To Joy
[1:27:26] turn your faith loose tonight

[1:27:48] but you can't do it if you're
[1:27:49] comfortable here in Babylon

[1:28:19] shake off Babylon
[1:28:21] come on it gets on all of us it's like a
[1:28:23] smoke
[1:28:24] gets in everything
[1:28:27] but some of us get to where we kind of
[1:28:28] like it
[1:28:30] it's
[1:28:35] you walk around smelling like smoke all
[1:28:36] the time
[1:28:38] the stench your sins all over you
[1:28:41] the stench of a life that isn't overcome
[1:28:43] is all over you
[1:28:46] well nobody knows oh please
[1:28:51] everybody knows
[1:28:55] it's because people are talking no the
[1:28:56] stint Just Smokes all over you
[1:29:00] nobody gotta say nothing
[1:29:02] ain't no victory
[1:29:06] yeah I'm gonna leave that alone
[1:29:09] it was easier to live in Babylon
[1:29:12] the clothes the food the houses the
[1:29:16] gardens
[1:29:18] this ain't even in my notes but it comes
[1:29:19] to me so I want to tell you
[1:29:21] how many of you have ever heard of the
[1:29:22] Seven Wonders of the World
[1:29:24] well one of them
[1:29:26] was the Hanging Gardens of Babylon lots
[1:29:29] of debate about those Gardens
[1:29:31] because they haven't found
[1:29:32] any archaeological evidence but lots and
[1:29:35] lots of writings from that time period
[1:29:37] would say they were there
[1:29:39] and a lot of people think they didn't
[1:29:40] actually hang but they were actually
[1:29:42] built on rooftops so it looked like
[1:29:44] Gardens in the sky
[1:29:46] but the writings of more than one writer
[1:29:48] say
[1:29:50] and boy this has hit me when I read this
[1:29:52] that the king of Babylon built those
[1:29:55] because he had taken a queen from
[1:29:57] another country
[1:29:59] and he built those Gardens to make her
[1:30:01] less homesick for her home
[1:30:05] he made it so beautiful and so nice so
[1:30:08] she would forget about home
[1:30:10] because At first she wasn't happy there
[1:30:12] she didn't like it there she missed the
[1:30:14] rolling Lush Hills of home she missed
[1:30:17] all these things and he says I'll fix
[1:30:18] that
[1:30:20] if I don't care what Pleasures the devil
[1:30:22] brings in your life don't let it make
[1:30:23] you forget about home I don't care what
[1:30:25] he offers you or what he presents you or
[1:30:27] what sin and what Pleasures the
[1:30:29] pleasures of sin for a season forsake
[1:30:31] those things there's a Homeland we got
[1:30:33] to go to don't forget where you came
[1:30:34] from don't ever quit being homesick
[1:30:37] don't ever quit be drawing back home
[1:30:38] don't get comfortable here in Babylon no
[1:30:41] matter how beautiful they make it no
[1:30:43] matter what they offer you
[1:30:47] but Israel began to live like
[1:30:49] Babylonians they begin to eat like them
[1:30:52] they begin to dress like them
[1:30:54] uh oh
[1:30:56] enjoying all that Babylon had to offer
[1:30:59] and they were lulled to sleep because
[1:31:01] they had a form of godliness
[1:31:04] they were lulled asleep by their
[1:31:06] tradition of worship they still had
[1:31:08] service still called on God and the King
[1:31:11] says go up
[1:31:13] return to the Homeland
[1:31:15] I said no
[1:31:17] no we like it here
[1:31:19] brother Brahm says many times we let the
[1:31:21] world slip in that's what's the matter
[1:31:23] with our churches today we let down a
[1:31:25] little bit here and there the devil has
[1:31:27] come in from one place to the other
[1:31:28] taking a little bit slip in here just a
[1:31:31] little of this place here a little that
[1:31:32] place there and the first thing you know
[1:31:34] it's got the whole thing in a confusion
[1:31:35] but I pray to God that during the time
[1:31:37] of this old-fashioned rally that we're
[1:31:39] having here that men will forget their
[1:31:41] Traditions all the things that has
[1:31:43] hindered and lay aside every weight and
[1:31:46] come back to an Old-Fashioned meeting
[1:31:47] where people will be born again I pray
[1:31:50] that God will give us hundreds of
[1:31:51] Spirit-filled people at the altar there
[1:31:53] praying through to God over Sinners and
[1:31:55] things that comes in during this meeting
[1:31:57] he says oh what a difference
[1:32:01] but we don't feel like we have to do
[1:32:02] that because laodicea Babylon has
[1:32:05] produced an age of soft living
[1:32:07] and comfort
[1:32:09] he says the pressures of the Dark Ages
[1:32:10] was either bent or be broken bow or die
[1:32:12] it was the Inquisition the power the
[1:32:15] Empire backing up satanic worship be
[1:32:17] organized or pay with your life each age
[1:32:20] had its pressures for example a great
[1:32:23] burden of this last age is the pressure
[1:32:25] of riches
[1:32:26] and self-living and nervous tensions
[1:32:30] tensions in a complex age that were
[1:32:32] seemed unfit to live in
[1:32:34] one of the attacks is soft living
[1:32:36] comfort
[1:32:40] listen that's the last thing I wanted
[1:32:42] even like Tabernacle that's the last
[1:32:44] thing I want is a church where I can be
[1:32:46] comfortable in a lukewarm condition
[1:32:48] oh come on we're gonna get real here for
[1:32:50] just a minute because see that's what
[1:32:51] happened there in Babylon I don't want
[1:32:54] to be in a place where sin isn't dealt
[1:32:55] with from the pulpit
[1:32:58] I don't want to go to that church in
[1:33:00] mystery Babylon that denominational
[1:33:02] spirit says we don't have to go back we
[1:33:04] can worship on Sundays and Wednesdays
[1:33:06] and we can keep the tradition that is
[1:33:08] exactly what the message called us out
[1:33:10] of how dare us walked right back into
[1:33:12] that thing into that denominational
[1:33:14] spirit
[1:33:15] run from that comfort
[1:33:17] run from that Comfort there's no victory
[1:33:20] in that Comfort there's no overcoming
[1:33:22] life in that comfort
[1:33:23] there's an Aaliyah happening right now
[1:33:25] there are people turning their hearts
[1:33:28] back there's a people getting ready to
[1:33:29] leave there's a people getting ready to
[1:33:31] go and there's people that are
[1:33:33] comfortable
[1:33:36] there's people preparing to leave
[1:33:39] don't sit in your current condition
[1:33:41] get your heart down from the willow tree
[1:33:45] see originally they wanted to go back
[1:33:46] where to where they to what they were
[1:33:48] called to be to the land they were
[1:33:50] called to be in but they got so
[1:33:52] traditional look we get so true we get
[1:33:54] so dignified
[1:33:56] in churches and how we think people
[1:33:59] supposed to act
[1:34:01] to where everything has to be just a
[1:34:02] certain way
[1:34:04] we get so to where you can't say nothing
[1:34:06] in the church tradition get so into
[1:34:08] where it'll bind the ministry to where
[1:34:09] they're afraid to say something without
[1:34:10] somebody going
[1:34:12] because that just goes against our
[1:34:14] tradition a little bit well you
[1:34:16] shouldn't say listen
[1:34:19] I saw reading they were brother Branham
[1:34:21] he's talking about going swimming with
[1:34:23] his friends with no clothes on and then
[1:34:25] he turns around and equates that with
[1:34:26] how we ought to come to Jesus
[1:34:29] how dignified does that sound
[1:34:33] yeah I put it here in my notes he would
[1:34:36] preach about swimming with no clothes on
[1:34:37] in the creek and then relate that to how
[1:34:39] we ought to come he says he says didn't
[1:34:41] have much clothes to begin with and his
[1:34:42] overalls was only held up with a nail so
[1:34:45] while the other boys trying to get all
[1:34:46] their clothes off I just pulled the nail
[1:34:51] he says I think that's about the way we
[1:34:54] ought to come to Christ that's right
[1:34:55] with not too many Traditions to lay down
[1:34:58] just pull one nail and jump in that's
[1:35:01] all amen so I pulled the nail and the
[1:35:04] clothes stood there in the air
[1:35:06] how dignified
[1:35:10] he said I pulled the nail and the
[1:35:12] clothes stood there in the air he says I
[1:35:14] hit the water before the clothes hit the
[1:35:16] ground running as hard as I could go and
[1:35:18] never hardly able to get a haircut I
[1:35:20] come up my hair was hanging over my eyes
[1:35:22] they wanted to know whether the water
[1:35:23] was good or not they were sitting down
[1:35:25] taking off their shoes and stockings and
[1:35:27] things if I held up one finger it was
[1:35:30] cold two fingers was right well brother
[1:35:32] I got into another water one time let me
[1:35:35] tell you something it's the Waters of
[1:35:37] Salvation I hold up two fingers he said
[1:35:40] it's good come on in it's good come on

[1:37:09] you're too comfortable in Babylon
[1:37:11] well we sing exactly so many songs and
[1:37:14] the preacher preaches exactly so we'll
[1:37:16] be dismissed by this time will you
[1:37:17] obvious ain't never come to church here
[1:37:21] and we're going to have one special

[1:37:23] to have we'll sing as long as the Lord
[1:37:25] leads us to say We'll worship as long as
[1:37:27] the Lord leads us to worship we're not
[1:37:29] getting too comfortable here in Babylon
[1:37:31] to where we can't let the spirit move
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:38] going home going home
[1:37:40] foreign
[1:37:44] you've got too comfortable in your
[1:37:46] traditions
[1:37:47] I like not being too comfortable
[1:37:50] let me talk to you about this just for a
[1:37:51] minute
[1:37:53] I'm glad it's not just some tradition of
[1:37:55] worship
[1:37:56] to some traditional God
[1:37:58] in this church I'm glad that you can't
[1:38:01] be comfortable here with Babylon in your
[1:38:03] life
[1:38:05] when Babylonian garments are seen in the
[1:38:07] house of God it should be called out
[1:38:11] when Babylonian styles are seen in the
[1:38:13] house of God it should be called out
[1:38:16] when the pleasures of Babylon are
[1:38:18] becoming the pleasures of the people of
[1:38:20] God it should be called out
[1:38:28] cause then you won't leave
[1:38:30] we are not to assimilate into this
[1:38:33] culture there is still to be a distinct
[1:38:36] difference between the people of God and
[1:38:38] the world
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:42] when he gets to the place that Brothers
[1:38:44] have to turn their head in the house of
[1:38:46] God that is a shame
[1:38:50] and if that girl that's dressed that way
[1:38:52] ain't an adult it's a shame on the
[1:38:54] father that let it happen
[1:38:58] what about boys boys Babylonian style
[1:39:01] same thing goes for you so now that's a
[1:39:02] little bit easier to hide but we see
[1:39:04] those Spirits at that most of the
[1:39:07] spirits of fashion are homosexual
[1:39:08] Spirits you say well I don't like that
[1:39:10] well if you look up one time who designs
[1:39:12] the clothes and it'll explain itself
[1:39:16] they talk about things that I read an
[1:39:19] article the other day saying they are
[1:39:20] purposely designing genes in a way that
[1:39:23] that would make the male shape look
[1:39:25] female
[1:39:27] by the way they designed the genes
[1:39:30] that's what they say not what we say
[1:39:35] that's what they say to make man's
[1:39:38] shoulders not look so Square
[1:39:40] give them outfits that take away the
[1:39:42] broadness of their shoulders
[1:39:45] when we see those things creeping into
[1:39:47] the house of God it should be called
[1:39:48] down
[1:39:49] we can't get comfortable
[1:39:51] those are the things of Babylon
[1:39:54] I want a place where there's Victory not
[1:39:55] a place where the harps are hung on the
[1:39:57] willow tree
[1:39:58] I want a place where the dance of
[1:40:00] Victory isn't mocked
[1:40:02] I want a place where the ministry can
[1:40:04] say what the word of God says so that I
[1:40:07] don't get too comfortable here
[1:40:12] it's good to be made uncomfortable from
[1:40:13] time to time it makes you check yourself
[1:40:16] at least if you have the right Spirit if
[1:40:19] you don't have the right Spirit then
[1:40:21] getting called out will make you angry
[1:40:25] [Music]
[1:40:26] listen I'm gonna talk a little bit about
[1:40:28] me for a second
[1:40:30] because it makes it easier to swallow
[1:40:31] when the preacher has a real moment
[1:40:33] all right
[1:40:35] I've always loved Sports
[1:40:39] shocker to a lot of y'all right
[1:40:41] now Hey listen now it's okay it's real
[1:40:45] moment
[1:40:46] I grew up in them my dad played my
[1:40:49] brother played I played my dad was a
[1:40:52] coach I was a coach
[1:40:55] enjoy sports
[1:40:57] do you think
[1:40:59] that I get upset when brother Tim or
[1:41:01] another brother comes and points out the
[1:41:03] dangers of loving those things
[1:41:08] or how wrong it is to make those
[1:41:10] athletes and those people a God or an
[1:41:12] idol in your life
[1:41:17] because it's a balance that needs to be
[1:41:20] brought that I need to hear
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:25] because I might get too comfortable
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:32] so when the man of God comes and he hits
[1:41:34] on something that you like to do
[1:41:37] and we go he's talking about me I go
[1:41:41] thank you Jesus for talking about me
[1:41:43] thank you Jesus for calling me out thank
[1:41:46] you for pointing me back to a balance
[1:41:48] thank you that you love me thank you
[1:41:50] that you care thank you that I'm not
[1:41:52] getting too comfortable here in Babylon
[1:41:55] I needed that balance
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:42:00] look at that
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:03] I don't want to get too comfortable
[1:42:06] here in Babylon
[1:42:09] brother Branham says and I know I've got
[1:42:11] you standing I'm done brother Brown says
[1:42:14] what did David say yea either I'll walk
[1:42:16] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:42:17] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:42:19] with me walk with him now he will walk
[1:42:21] with you in the valley thy rod and thy
[1:42:24] staff they comfort me now here's the
[1:42:26] Comfort we're supposed to look for
[1:42:29] the correction of the Lord comforts me
[1:42:34] they let me know that God is with me
[1:42:37] because he corrects me from my wrongs
[1:42:40] maybe he's trying to correct you tonight
[1:42:42] why don't you let the rod and staff
[1:42:44] comfort you the rod is the hard
[1:42:47] preaching gospel but it's a comfort to
[1:42:50] let me know that God speaks to me when
[1:42:53] that type of gospel is being preached to
[1:42:55] correct me he loves me he wants me to
[1:42:59] come walk with him now and then he will
[1:43:01] walk with me in that hour
[1:43:04] church we can't stay here
[1:43:10] I left so much unsaid
[1:43:13] about how the evils of this world
[1:43:16] tries to comfort you they can't the
[1:43:18] world can't offer you real comfort
[1:43:21] they can't offer real because they try
[1:43:23] to offer material comforts
[1:43:25] try to offer you The Gardens of Babylon
[1:43:26] to get you to take your mind off a home
[1:43:29] try to get you comfortable living here
[1:43:31] but the king said who will go up
[1:43:34] who will return
[1:43:36] who will go back
[1:43:38] he says is there any among you who's
[1:43:41] willing to go back home and do the
[1:43:43] Lord's work
[1:43:45] I'll go
[1:43:47] I'll go Lord I hadn't got too
[1:43:48] comfortable here I don't want to stay
[1:43:50] here no more
[1:43:51] Lord I don't want to be bound down with
[1:43:53] the Comforts of Babylon I don't want to
[1:43:55] get so comfortable that their Pleasures
[1:43:56] are running through my home and running
[1:43:58] through my life and then I get offended
[1:43:59] when those things are caught I call it
[1:44:01] out Lord let the man of God call it out
[1:44:03] and show me that rod and I staff they
[1:44:05] comfort me you love me you care for me
[1:44:09] he's gonna get
[1:44:11] those back home that are supposed to go
[1:44:13] back home

[1:44:43] down in Iran he said you read it in Luke
[1:44:45] magazine this is the last thing I'm
[1:44:46] reading how they took big planes and
[1:44:48] went down there and got plain loads of
[1:44:50] these Jews
[1:44:51] towels and something been down there
[1:44:53] since they're carrying away of Babylon
[1:44:55] they were still there
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:45:02] been in there for 2500 years
[1:45:05] and they've been left down there they
[1:45:07] were plowing with old wooden instruments
[1:45:09] they know nothing about Jesus even being
[1:45:10] on the earth they know nothing about
[1:45:12] anything but their old Jewish Traditions
[1:45:15] Traditions that they had lived by
[1:45:17] and when these planes set down and begin
[1:45:19] to load these Jews on to take them back
[1:45:21] to the Homeland the prophet prophesied
[1:45:23] 2800 or or Thirty hundred years ago and
[1:45:26] said when they come out of that
[1:45:27] captivity God's gonna bring them forth
[1:45:29] on the wings of eagles
[1:45:31] the prophet saw that plane coming he saw
[1:45:34] them sitting down and picking them up
[1:45:35] and taking them back to the Homeland he
[1:45:38] didn't know what to call it just looked
[1:45:39] like an eagle to him
[1:45:41] so he said they'd be brought back on the
[1:45:42] wings of eagles
[1:45:44] and when they got out of that Airship
[1:45:45] and the young was helping the old and
[1:45:48] they were interviewing when they said
[1:45:50] have you come back to the Homeland to
[1:45:52] die
