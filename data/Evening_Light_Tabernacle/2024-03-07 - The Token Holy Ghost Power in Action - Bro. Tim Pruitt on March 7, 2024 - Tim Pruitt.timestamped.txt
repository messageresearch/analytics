[40:14] Chinese food it was so good and had lots
[40:18] of Fellowship together talking about the
[40:20] things of God and the message that God
[40:23] has given us in this day and and he as
[40:27] he mentioned the the T the the name
[40:30] Menan means bright light or
[40:34] Lighthouse so you know we're a
[40:36] lighthouse here in this area but I'm

[41:11] have him and we're so thankful and he's
[41:15] brought her through those um very
[41:18] difficult times just like I explained to
[41:20] her you know we believe in Mark 16 if we
[41:24] take any deadly thing it'll not harm us
[41:27] so we believe that with all our hearts
[41:30] and uh every time as I instructed every
[41:33] time you had to take that stuff the
[41:35] doctors recommended you pray over it I
[41:39] say that with any kind of medicine it's
[41:41] off the tree of knowledge it's not off
[41:43] the tree of
[41:44] life it's off the tree of knowledge and
[41:47] it has good and evil in it it has its
[41:49] side effects but we believe in Mark
[41:53] 16 we believe that we'll lay hands on
[41:55] the sick and they shall recover cover we
[41:58] believe that God heals even without
[42:00] doctor's
[42:01] assistance but if God chooses to use a
[42:04] doctor that's he'll heal through that
[42:07] way too medicine cannot heal doctors
[42:11] can't heal it's God that's a Healer I'm
[42:13] the Lord God that he said that heals all
[42:16] thy
[42:17] diseases so therefore it's all inclusive
[42:20] what he does he he heals us today we

[48:47] hours of the morning so you know God is
[48:50] still moving he's still delivering and I
[48:53] know there there are many many reports
[48:55] that are coming out we we are not a
[48:58] defeated people we are
[49:01] Overcomers we aren't surprised when the
[49:04] Devil comes and hits back you know after
[49:07] we make such a bold attack upon him and
[49:11] his kingdom we're not surprised that he
[49:13] comes back and and attacks us you know
[49:16] but we just we just stand our ground and
[49:19] hold the promise firm amen knowing that
[49:23] knowing who has called us and sent us in
[49:25] this hour if you'll turn with me to
[49:27] Exodus 12 we will read again from this
[49:31] passage of scripture I want to speak
[49:33] from it another time and today we're
[49:36] going to be speaking on the token holy
[49:40] ghost power in action if you'll read
[49:44] from verse 21 with me now then Moses
[49:48] called for all the Elders of Israel and
[49:51] said unto them draw out and take you a
[49:54] lamb according to your families and the
[49:57] Passover and ye shall take a bunch of
[50:00] hisp and dip it in the blood that is in
[50:04] the Basin and strike the lentil and the
[50:06] two side posts with the blood that is in
[50:09] the Basin and none of you shall go out
[50:12] of the door of his house until the
[50:14] morning for the Lord will pass through
[50:17] to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth
[50:20] the blood upon the lentil and on the two
[50:23] side posts the Lord will pass over the
[50:27] door and will not suffer the Destroyer
[50:30] to come into your houses to Smite you
[50:35] amen I'm going to let you be seated but
[50:36] I want you to turn with me to John
[50:39] 14:12 for another scripture reading John
[50:43] 14:12 and I want you to remember that
[50:45] this scripture um it was not only
[50:48] speaking of a prophetic Ministry in this
[50:51] day where we saw the ministry of Christ
[50:54] repeated but it also speaks of a uh of
[50:58] every
[50:59] believer this is not just for a prophet
[51:02] alone this is for every believer and it
[51:05] says verily verily it says which means
[51:09] absolutely absolutely I say unto you he
[51:13] that believeth on me the works that I do
[51:18] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[51:21] these shall he do because I go unto my
[51:24] father and whatsoever you shall ask in
[51:27] my name that will I do that the father
[51:31] may be glorified in the son if you ask
[51:34] anything in my name I will do it and
[51:38] then turn with me to Mark 16 and verse
[51:41] 14 where we read the Great Commission of
[51:44] the Lord and remember because in this
[51:48] day that the seals have been taken off
[51:50] the book and has restored the Gospel of
[51:53] Jesus Christ to us that we are the ones
[51:56] now that are commissioned to fulfill the
[51:59] scripture because the gospel must go
[52:02] into all the world and not only that be
[52:06] preached into all the world and and um
[52:10] be demonstrated look what he said in
[52:12] verse 14 afterward he appeared unto the
[52:15] 11 as they sat at meat and up braided
[52:18] them with their unbelief and Hardness of
[52:20] Heart because they believed not them
[52:23] which had seen him after he was risen
[52:26] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[52:29] world and preach the gospel to Every
[52:32] Creature he that believeth and is
[52:35] baptized shall be saved but he that
[52:37] believeth not shall be damned and these
[52:40] signs shall follow them that believe in
[52:44] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[52:47] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[52:50] take up serpents and if they drink any
[52:53] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[52:56] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[52:59] shall recover what a wonderful promise
[53:02] that is Amen brother Leo I'm going to
[53:05] ask you a question and I want you to
[53:07] think about it as we're as we're doing
[53:11] this for a moment um I want you to be
[53:14] able to tell me about how many
[53:17] Christians in the three self church and
[53:19] then how many Christians Al together and
[53:21] now how many are message Believers
[53:24] estimating today so how many in the
[53:27] three self church that's the government
[53:29] church for
[53:32] Christianity is did I understand right
[53:34] 70 million all right and then how many
[53:39] um all total of Christians in in
[53:43] China 100 million and then about how
[53:47] many Believers now do you estimate are
[53:49] in
[53:51] China about how
[53:55] many more than 1,000 all right so we
[53:58] have Believers there in China and um you
[54:02] know today God has done marvelous
[54:05] marvelous Works already as the gospel
[54:08] goes there and you know I I think about
[54:11] many years ago one man had a burden on
[54:14] his heart that was brother John le and
[54:16] he went he went there into China not
[54:19] knowing anybody not knowing how to speak
[54:21] the language um but just had a burden
[54:24] and and started taking Bibles in in and
[54:26] from there uh taking the message in and
[54:29] now there are churches that are started
[54:31] all over um where I when I was there in
[54:36] Shanghai I've ministered to over 40
[54:38] pastors there that was 10 years ago and
[54:42] uh the government has done what it could
[54:44] to try to to to shut things down and to
[54:47] keep uh Christianity out but it just
[54:50] keeps rising up and you know God's going
[54:53] to have a bride no matter what amen
[54:56] he'll have a bride and she'll be without
[54:58] spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such
[55:01] thing but to think about it you know we
[55:03] have a a
[55:06] responsibility then as the bride people
[55:09] to take the gospel to all the world and
[55:12] what a day that we're living in when God
[55:15] has made available even even through the
[55:18] through the meain means of internet and
[55:21] and the website so we can get it out and
[55:24] right now um on the message Hub is is
[55:27] almost every sermon I'm pretty sure it's
[55:30] all complete of uh brother bram's
[55:33] sermons that that he preached that is
[55:36] available to the people and we've been
[55:38] doing some of the same things for the
[55:40] Japanese Believers and and so there are
[55:43] many of them there today that are out
[55:45] there for the on the web that anybody
[55:48] around the world Chinese Japanese can go
[55:50] there and listen to so you know it's
[55:53] just um it's it's just the gospel going
[55:58] into all the world because we have a
[56:01] commission to
[56:03] fulfill amen and so as we are looking at
[56:07] this today I read these three scriptures
[56:10] one of course from Exodus that we have
[56:13] been speaking about on the token where
[56:16] that he he told them to take a lamb
[56:20] according your families and kill the
[56:22] Passover and then take the blood and
[56:25] that is and put it in a basin and then
[56:28] take a bunch of hisp and dip it in the
[56:31] blood and then strike the lentil and the
[56:33] two side post of the with the blood
[56:36] that's in the Basin and so the blood has
[56:39] to be applied and of course the blood
[56:42] was representing a lamb had died and it
[56:46] was also the the the sign of the life of
[56:52] the Lamb upon the doorpost and and so of
[56:57] course today we don't have the literal
[57:00] paint of the blood we have the literal
[57:04] life of Jesus Christ which is the Holy
[57:08] Ghost which we apply instead of with
[57:12] hisp we apply it by faith and of course
[57:16] it must be applied to every house then
[57:20] of course we read from Mark uh John
[57:24] 14:12 where that he talks about the
[57:27] works that I do shall you do also so
[57:31] there will always be then signs as in
[57:34] Mark 16 that follow that Believers and
[57:39] of course there had to be signs over the
[57:43] doorpost over over the doorpost of the
[57:47] every dwelling and of course we bring
[57:49] that down to every individual must have
[57:52] it upon the lentil on the two side host
[57:56] in other words the body the spirit the
[57:59] soul everything brought under the blood
[58:02] and of course it's not just that but
[58:05] families our house must be under the
[58:08] blood and we have spoken about a lamb
[58:10] for a household and and just the
[58:13] practical application of it to our
[58:16] houses to our homes to our family life
[58:19] and all of those things and now we're
[58:21] speaking about the token upon on the
[58:23] church because it is also a house every
[58:28] house must have the token applied now
[58:31] the the Destroyer is passing through the
[58:34] neighborhood now and nothing is safe
[58:38] except that which is under the token it
[58:42] must be under the blood which in our
[58:44] case is the Holy Ghost again we do not
[58:48] have the literal chemistry of the blood
[58:51] the the substance of blood we have the
[58:54] life that is of the the blood of Jesus
[58:57] Christ and that life is the Holy Ghost
[59:01] so the Holy Spirit must be applied to
[59:05] the to the individual it must be applied
[59:08] to the family home it must be applied to
[59:13] the church and as I have as I spoke some
[59:16] time ago on being in Passover that we
[59:20] will be in Passover until the time that
[59:24] we hear the trumpet sound
[59:26] for us to leave this world of Egypt so
[59:29] we will be here not going out from under
[59:32] the blood staying under the blood eating
[59:35] the lamb and the bitter herbs with
[59:38] preparations made for the trumpet sound
[59:41] cuz any moment we're going to hear the
[59:43] trumpet sound now so but as we know the
[59:48] Destroyer is in the land everybody knows
[59:51] even that and and they telling us over
[59:54] and again we are on the verge of World
[59:58] War II and and of course you know in
[1:00:02] these kind of times we have a job to be
[1:00:05] doing and that is that is to make sure
[1:00:08] the blood is applied even to our church
[1:00:12] that under in the church the power of
[1:00:16] the holy spirit is working amen but we
[1:00:19] need it for salvation we need it for
[1:00:22] healing we need it for deliverance the
[1:00:25] Holy Ghost is is not an option it is a
[1:00:28] must amen and and of course as a church
[1:00:32] our job is to impart life by having
[1:00:36] Jesus Christ in action now I want you to
[1:00:40] see brother brandham told us in the
[1:00:43] message that day on Calvary and as I
[1:00:46] paraphrase this he says the Greater
[1:00:48] Works was to have power in the church
[1:00:52] not only to heal the Sick by prayer and
[1:00:54] cast out Devils by prayer but to impart
[1:00:58] eternal life to the Believers amen so
[1:01:01] the The Church Must Be a place where the
[1:01:04] holy spirit is present and the
[1:01:06] atmosphere is there where that eternal
[1:01:10] life is imparted now I cannot give you
[1:01:14] eternal life as far as even by laying on
[1:01:17] of hands or by praying a prayer over you
[1:01:20] or by certain rituals but we impart
[1:01:24] eternal life and return and remit sins
[1:01:28] just like they did on the day of
[1:01:30] Pentecost repent every one of you and be
[1:01:33] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:01:36] the remission of sin and you shall
[1:01:38] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[1:01:41] The Church Must Be imparting eternal
[1:01:44] life and and to do that the you see the
[1:01:48] the church had had to receive the
[1:01:52] eternal life coming into the hands of
[1:01:54] the church to impart life and that
[1:01:56] really that's what Calvary meant if it
[1:01:59] if it had just stopped at the at the
[1:02:01] shedding of the blood and Jesus had not
[1:02:04] come back in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:08] we would be just as bad off as they were
[1:02:10] in the Old Testament our sins pass
[1:02:13] forgiven but no power to live it amen
[1:02:17] but this Holy Ghost is the power to live
[1:02:20] it it is to put Jesus Christ in action
[1:02:25] in our lives and in the church and we
[1:02:29] are the
[1:02:31] continuation of the book of Acts because
[1:02:33] of having been restored back to the
[1:02:36] place that the original Church fell from
[1:02:40] down to the church ages we know the
[1:02:42] truth was lost Luther brought back a
[1:02:45] strand of Truth with justification
[1:02:47] Wesley did the same with sanctification
[1:02:50] but we today are no longer holders of
[1:02:54] scattered truths holding strands of
[1:02:56] loose ends we have the fullness of the
[1:03:00] word and with the fullness of the spirit
[1:03:03] for the with the restoration of the word
[1:03:07] comes the restoration of the power amen
[1:03:10] the Church of Jesus Christ is not to be
[1:03:14] a powerless church but she she is not to
[1:03:17] be a lukewarm church but she is to be a
[1:03:21] church that is on fire where the spirit
[1:03:23] of God is in action working in lives and
[1:03:27] hearts Healing The Sick saving the lost
[1:03:31] and forgiving sins filling with the Holy
[1:03:34] Ghost casting out Devils It All Belongs
[1:03:37] to the church and she must be Jesus
[1:03:41] Christ in action upon the Earth and
[1:03:44] shall I say she
[1:03:47] is hallelujah she
[1:03:51] is the Holy Ghost is here not in a
[1:03:55] person
[1:03:56] not in a fragment as was given to Luther
[1:03:59] or Wesley or even ausa street but it is
[1:04:02] here in its full power amen the Holy
[1:04:07] Ghost and the true church makes it a
[1:04:10] continuation of the book of Acts looking
[1:04:12] back through history of the ages you can
[1:04:15] see how the Antichrist Spirit would come
[1:04:18] into the church and defile it and making
[1:04:21] it lukewarm and formal and Powerless but
[1:04:24] that is not where we are today that is
[1:04:27] not we are what we are under amen but by
[1:04:31] the opening of The Seven Seals it is
[1:04:34] exposed Satan revealing the man of sin
[1:04:38] and his Works were were not were not
[1:04:41] only would he destroyed God's people
[1:04:42] through the Dark Ages but discredited
[1:04:45] God's word but he today has been
[1:04:49] exposed if you notice with the seals it
[1:04:51] was not only revealing Christ it was
[1:04:54] also exposing the animal Christ why
[1:04:57] because God is determined there will not
[1:04:59] be a people deceived in this last day
[1:05:02] but there will be a people who are
[1:05:04] victorious Overcomers who are the
[1:05:07] continuation of what was lost in the
[1:05:10] book of
[1:05:13] Acts now so therefore Luther's token
[1:05:17] sign was
[1:05:18] justification Wesley's token sign was
[1:05:22] sanctification tongues was the Zeus's
[1:05:24] streets token sign but there is a people
[1:05:28] on the Earth today who have the
[1:05:31] supernatural Supreme token amen the
[1:05:35] abstract of title with every Creed of
[1:05:39] man every false Doctrine struck off
[1:05:44] every mistruth
[1:05:46] corrected amen and a book that is no
[1:05:49] longer close to us and his promises
[1:05:52] withheld to us but I want to say that
[1:05:55] every promise is more real to you than
[1:05:58] any other age since Pentecost since the
[1:06:02] early ages amen but God has done a work
[1:06:05] of restoration to restore a people back
[1:06:08] to the original word with its original
[1:06:12] Power
[1:06:14] amen now brother Brandon would tell us
[1:06:17] in the message token he said now we have
[1:06:19] a token in this day we have been a to
[1:06:22] given a token which is an anot type of
[1:06:24] that type
[1:06:26] of that natural token he's speaking of
[1:06:28] the Lamb's blood we have been given the
[1:06:32] supernatural Supreme token amen all that
[1:06:37] was foreshadowed has been given to this
[1:06:40] generation think about it even while
[1:06:42] it's forshadowed in Luther or Wesley or
[1:06:46] isusa Street has now been given to us
[1:06:49] even what even what we saw in the early
[1:06:53] Church in the book of Acts has now been
[1:06:56] restored back to us so all that was
[1:06:59] foreshadowed has been given this
[1:07:01] generation has been given the token now
[1:07:05] we have the Holy Ghost is our token and
[1:07:08] it is our identification that we have
[1:07:11] accepted the death of the Lamb Not only
[1:07:14] was Jesus's human life to come back on
[1:07:17] us but it was God himself manifested in
[1:07:20] the flesh amen that brought us back upon
[1:07:24] the adoption of sons that we are now
[1:07:27] Sons and Daughters of God Amen think
[1:07:30] about that we didn't just receive a
[1:07:32] man's spirit and this message is not
[1:07:35] about receiving a man's Spirit it is not
[1:07:39] even receiving the spirit of of a man of
[1:07:43] you know of William brandom or some
[1:07:45] great preacher somebody it's not about
[1:07:48] receiving his spirit it's that Spirit of
[1:07:51] a man won't do you any good you be just
[1:07:54] as lost as lost can be but if you ever
[1:07:57] get God's spirit that came by Jesus and
[1:08:02] receive of the Holy Ghost let me tell
[1:08:05] you friend amen that life will give you
[1:08:07] overcoming power it'll make you
[1:08:12] Victorious
[1:08:14] hallelujah amen it brings you back to
[1:08:17] the adoption of
[1:08:19] sons amen praise God that now we are the
[1:08:24] sons and daughters of God think about it
[1:08:28] the adoption and the you know the
[1:08:30] adoption that we're speaking about is
[1:08:33] like not adopting a baby but taking a
[1:08:35] man when he's he comes into his full
[1:08:38] statue and when he's fully matured and
[1:08:42] in that mature State he has given the
[1:08:45] father's Kingdom he's put a robe upon
[1:08:49] his shoulders he is he's given a special
[1:08:52] robe he's put a ring up on his feet
[1:08:55] finger that identifies him with the
[1:08:58] right to use his father's
[1:09:01] name amen he has the father's seal amen
[1:09:06] whatever he stamps is stamps whatever he
[1:09:08] binds is bind whatever he looses is
[1:09:12] loose Hallelujah that's what I'm talking
[1:09:15] about this Holy Ghost positioned you as
[1:09:18] a son fully adopted fully positioned
[1:09:22] with the robe upon you
[1:09:26] amen you don't have to wait for
[1:09:27] something to come you don't have to wait
[1:09:30] for persecution or squeeze right now you
[1:09:33] are the sons of God every promise is
[1:09:36] your promise every word is your
[1:09:44] word it is our
[1:09:47] identification that God has accepted
[1:09:50] us we are
[1:09:53] accepted in the Beloved
[1:09:56] in
[1:09:57] Christ the message of this last day is a
[1:10:00] revelation of the true church and what
[1:10:03] she stands for it is a revelation that
[1:10:06] she can do the Greater Works and that
[1:10:10] the blood has made the death angel pass
[1:10:14] over we're talking about the death angel
[1:10:17] that is killing
[1:10:18] fatherhood that is destroying
[1:10:22] motherhood that is Wrecking families

[1:11:00] their jaw it's a ring in their nose it
[1:11:04] is something there it is something there
[1:11:06] where Satan has a a hold upon their life
[1:11:09] and it's a sign that they're in bondage
[1:11:13] that they're in
[1:11:14] sin amen I see boys who don't know how
[1:11:18] to be men eminate necklaces and
[1:11:23] bracelets mhm M pering their hair and

[1:12:22] ride right into the
[1:12:24] church amen if you're not careful he'll
[1:12:26] ride right into evening light Tabernacle
[1:12:28] and pack you
[1:12:30] out amen because he can get to anybody
[1:12:34] without the
[1:12:35] token no matter how much blood that we
[1:12:39] have here it's only for those who have

[1:14:37] have new births by genuine birth of the
[1:14:39] Holy Ghost it's against our constitution
[1:14:42] it's against the word of
[1:14:45] God it's against the dictates of the
[1:14:50] Bible onlu we can talk about George
[1:14:53] Washington fought for this Constitution
[1:14:56] and this one there he signed it and this
[1:14:59] one gave his life and this one said Give
[1:15:01] me liberty or give me death we can talk
[1:15:03] about them but let me tell you for a
[1:15:05] moment Peter stood for this gospel Paul

[1:15:11] his life for this gospel amen we we have

[1:16:07] message of this last age is a revelation
[1:16:10] of the true
[1:16:12] church that's what the message is about
[1:16:15] it's a revelation of the true church
[1:16:19] Christ in the true church and what the
[1:16:21] true church stands
[1:16:23] for it's a revelation that she can do

[1:16:55] death angel pass
[1:16:57] over that we stand Justified and pure
[1:17:00] before God as we stood back there in his
[1:17:03] mind before the world began so therefore

[1:18:53] Prevail against them

[1:19:00] but now the blood had come and with the
[1:19:04] death of that lamb the penalty of sin

[1:23:46] God Amen if we can just get you to
[1:23:49] reform this is not a Reformation this is
[1:23:51] a
[1:23:53] transformation
[1:23:55] well if we can get you to change your
[1:23:56] habits it's not about turning a new page
[1:24:00] it's about receiving Christ and having

[1:24:39] conspiracist here but you know I'm just

[1:24:47] it so we we we work and work and we we
[1:24:51] take funds and more funds and we don't
[1:24:52] ever get a cure but that's not what
[1:24:55] Jesus
[1:24:58] did amen he paid sin's debt once and for
[1:25:03] all and he provided not a treatment for
[1:25:06] it but he provided a cure for
[1:25:09] sin hallelujah amen let me tell you
[1:25:13] it'll cure the worst disease there is I

[1:27:45] Christians see it must take effect there
[1:27:48] was a story of the wealth survival
[1:27:51] happened in the in Great Britain in the
[1:27:54] country of Welles Britain is made up of
[1:27:57] of several different countries like
[1:27:58] England and Welles and and there
[1:28:01] Scotland and then and then of course
[1:28:04] there's Ireland and and over in the all
[1:28:07] in the British
[1:28:08] Isles but in in a meeting in Wales in
[1:28:11] 1904 this is just before the isua
[1:28:15] Revival they had a gathering of people
[1:28:19] there it was um it was a time of a
[1:28:23] Revival destru truck where they they
[1:28:25] estimated nearly 100,000 people would
[1:28:29] converted in those couple of years there
[1:28:31] just in in those countries and it was a
[1:28:34] precursor to the isua Street Revival in
[1:28:38] 1906 and it would be in February
[1:28:42] 1904 that in in a meeting there one
[1:28:45] young lady her name was Flory Evans she
[1:28:49] is quoted as saying that she just got up
[1:28:53] and made a proclamation
[1:28:54] and she said I love the Lord Jesus with
[1:28:58] all of my
[1:29:00] heart and that caused such an impression
[1:29:04] it was said with such fervor with such a
[1:29:08] uh with such sincerity that it drove
[1:29:12] others to their knees and a Revival was
[1:29:15] started this event would actually
[1:29:18] initiate that Revival and this this uh
[1:29:21] this would spark an Awakening to the
[1:29:24] rest of of Britain Scandinavia parts of
[1:29:26] Europe North America the mission fields
[1:29:29] of of India and the Orient and Africa
[1:29:32] and Latin America and there were great
[1:29:34] men who had heard about this and they
[1:29:38] were
[1:29:39] dignitaries some of them were doctors of
[1:29:42] divinities with all of their collars
[1:29:44] maybe turned around backwards and they
[1:29:47] come from the USA to see what this
[1:29:49] revival is all about they want to
[1:29:51] discover how it happened you know people
[1:29:54] want to know how it happened I'll tell
[1:29:56] you what how it happened just get in
[1:29:57] love with Jesus you want Revival in your
[1:30:00] heart that's it get to the place like
[1:30:02] that I love the Lord Jesus with all my
[1:30:05] heart amen that that'll do more for it
[1:30:08] than anything else opening your life to
[1:30:10] Revival and here it just walking down
[1:30:12] the street looking for the building
[1:30:14] where it was being held where where
[1:30:17] where the where the Revival was
[1:30:19] happening they saw a policeman who they
[1:30:23] heard whistling the hym and so they
[1:30:25] walked over him asked him directions to
[1:30:27] where the Welsh Revival was and asked
[1:30:30] him said where is the well survival and
[1:30:33] this little cop you know was directing
[1:30:37] traffic and all and he just said the W
[1:30:40] Revival well the W Revival isn't me I am
[1:30:44] the W Revival you see they wanted to
[1:30:47] know what building it was in amen but
[1:30:51] you see he had
[1:30:52] become the we
[1:30:55] Revival let me tell you the Revival the
[1:30:58] bride's Revival is not in a building it
[1:31:01] ain't contained and even even like
[1:31:03] Tabernacle but if a man or woman can get
[1:31:07] on fire for God the brides Revival will
[1:31:10] be in their life and they will be the
[1:31:13] bride's Revival Hallelujah and that will
[1:31:17] make them be Jesus Christ in action upon
[1:31:20] the
[1:31:21] Earth but Jesus said because I I live
[1:31:24] you shall live also my life will be in
[1:31:27] you and the works that I do shall you do
[1:31:29] also you see we must get to that place
[1:31:33] he promised it would do it and it's got
[1:31:35] to come that way you see but it's not
[1:31:39] just to the
[1:31:41] individual it is the church must be
[1:31:45] displaying the token as brother bradam
[1:31:48] told about it in his token sermon where
[1:31:51] he preached about this he said today
[1:31:53] every church every individual that isn't
[1:31:56] and cannot display that token of the
[1:31:59] Holy Ghost is spiritually dying and will
[1:32:02] die so every church I want to emphasize
[1:32:06] because we we've dealt with the
[1:32:08] individual we dealt with the home now
[1:32:11] just telling with the church every
[1:32:13] church that cannot display that
[1:32:16] token the token has to be on
[1:32:21] display it must be seen you see it it's
[1:32:24] got to be displayed amongst the people
[1:32:27] making him Jesus Christ the same
[1:32:30] yesterday today and forever we must have
[1:32:33] the word the word is
[1:32:35] important you see you see we must have
[1:32:39] the word but the word in his power we
[1:32:43] must have the word in his power but to
[1:32:45] release that power it must be mixed with
[1:32:49] faith because Faith releases the power
[1:32:52] from the word you remember in the book
[1:32:55] of Hebrews said the word preached did
[1:32:58] not profit them because it was not mixed
[1:33:02] with faith in them that heard it it is
[1:33:04] not enough just to have the message but
[1:33:08] it also must have of that Faith there
[1:33:11] that quickens it the spark that makes it
[1:33:14] alive in other words it cannot be just
[1:33:16] the
[1:33:18] mechanics it must also have the
[1:33:21] Dynamics because the mechanics without
[1:33:24] Dynamics is no good the same as as
[1:33:27] Dynamics without mechanics is no good
[1:33:30] you can scream and shout and run the
[1:33:32] aisles and dance all over and not have
[1:33:34] the word of God and you still it's no
[1:33:37] good you'll never get anywhere you're
[1:33:38] just cranking on the engine you're just
[1:33:41] spattering there and making a bunch of
[1:33:43] Noise We don't want to just be a church
[1:33:46] that makes a bunch of
[1:33:48] noise amen but we we do want the noise
[1:33:52] because it's a sign of life
[1:33:55] life amen you can't crank an engine and
[1:33:58] there not be
[1:34:00] noise amen and young people like to have
[1:34:02] a nice nice loud muffler
[1:34:07] on Amen and you get a bunch of young
[1:34:10] people filled with the Holy Ghost they
[1:34:12] make a lot of
[1:34:13] noise Glory hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:34:17] and I tell you it it gets at the old
[1:34:19] people they will start making noise too
[1:34:22] and they will be shouting and
[1:34:25] rejoicing hallelujah amen but but you
[1:34:28] see it's not one without the other it
[1:34:30] takes both of them a mere confession of
[1:34:34] faith of of I believe the message is
[1:34:38] isn't sufficient but when we really
[1:34:41] believe it it'll display his power you
[1:34:44] see when the true word is preach in the
[1:34:48] believing Church it will create an
[1:34:50] atmosphere of
[1:34:52] faith
[1:34:55] now when when that
[1:34:58] atmosphere is more than a more than a
[1:35:01] mere confession of oh I believe the
[1:35:04] message is true but when we really
[1:35:06] believe it it will display his power
[1:35:11] remember the blood was applied by hisp
[1:35:16] by faith the life on display is what
[1:35:19] makes the death angel pass over it is
[1:35:22] not enough to have it in the in your
[1:35:27] Bible it is not enough to just have it
[1:35:30] in a bucket it is not just enough to
[1:35:33] have a collection of
[1:35:37] paraphernalia or or a message library
[1:35:41] that ain't
[1:35:43] enough come on Church am but when the
[1:35:47] word is believed and obeyed you and the
[1:35:50] word become one and it works through you
[1:35:54] you remember the works that I do shall
[1:35:58] you do
[1:35:59] also now when the word in you become one
[1:36:02] that it lives itself out and you become
[1:36:03] a walking Bible an Epistle of Jesus
[1:36:07] Christ you are the Living
[1:36:10] Word now what good is the blood if it
[1:36:14] doesn't give power over the death
[1:36:19] angel what good is the Holy Ghost if it
[1:36:23] doesn't give you power over
[1:36:26] sin hello if it isn't keeping the
[1:36:29] Destroyer the death angel from your door
[1:36:32] see your body is to be the Temple of the
[1:36:35] Holy
[1:36:36] Ghost and it must be the blood must be
[1:36:38] on display there if it isn't keeping
[1:36:41] porn out of your temple what good is
[1:36:44] that
[1:36:45] blood the Destroyer is coming
[1:36:49] destroying if it isn't keeping adultery
[1:36:51] out of your marriage
[1:36:54] if it isn't keeping you clean of alcohol
[1:36:57] and tobacco and vaping and Sexting in
[1:36:59] your
[1:37:02] texting amen you know then I ask is it
[1:37:05] really the blood of
[1:37:09] Christ if it's really the blood it's
[1:37:11] going to keep that out of your
[1:37:14] life it not only will save you but it
[1:37:17] will keep you
[1:37:20] clean I'm glad today to talk about a
[1:37:23] power of the Holy Ghost that just will
[1:37:26] do more than save you from hell but will
[1:37:29] save you from the hell on this Earth of
[1:37:33] [Applause]
[1:37:37] sin in the Old Testament the blood of
[1:37:40] bulls and goats could not take away sin
[1:37:42] our sin
[1:37:43] desire it could only treat sin it could
[1:37:46] not cure sin had no cure for sin in the
[1:37:50] Old
[1:37:51] Testament you see
[1:37:54] it as the inoculation that they received
[1:37:57] wasn't too good it's kind of like you
[1:38:00] know this covid shot they
[1:38:03] gave government required it I couldn't
[1:38:06] couldn't go to Canada without it so I
[1:38:08] took it but did it keep people from from
[1:38:11] Co
[1:38:14] no no it you know it the inoculation
[1:38:18] wasn't too
[1:38:20] good so they tried this one and they
[1:38:22] bragged on that one and this one will do
[1:38:24] it and you know this one will do it and
[1:38:26] everybody line up and get it you know
[1:38:28] the president shows he gets it but it
[1:38:30] doesn't do no good he gets
[1:38:33] Co but you see the inoculation wasn't
[1:38:36] too good and that's the way the Old
[1:38:38] Testament was you know it's a big claim
[1:38:41] the blood of the lamb and and slay the
[1:38:43] lamb and whatever and it just rolled the
[1:38:45] sins
[1:38:47] ahead amen it it it could only cover sin
[1:38:51] it could not annihilate sin right so you
[1:38:54] see there was always a conscience of sin
[1:38:57] and every year he had to come back again
[1:38:59] make his offering year by year but the
[1:39:03] Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews
[1:39:05] that the worshipper once Purge has no
[1:39:08] more conscience of sin in other words no
[1:39:11] more desire to sin the whole thing is
[1:39:15] gone from him you see you do not no
[1:39:19] matter what they tell you have to sin
[1:39:21] every
[1:39:22] day
[1:39:24] amen you do that because you willfully
[1:39:27] want to and the reason you willfully
[1:39:30] want to is because you've never died to
[1:39:34] yourself amen yeah that's right because
[1:39:37] when you die to sin that thing is gone
[1:39:39] the desire is gone amen but you know
[1:39:42] people are doing what like a black bird
[1:39:44] trying to put a peacock feather and say
[1:39:46] look I'm a peacock you know he's not a
[1:39:48] peacock he just got something to stuck
[1:39:50] in himself it's got to grow from the
[1:39:52] inside out
[1:39:54] and that's a whole deal this is not
[1:39:56] about a Reformation this is not a even
[1:39:58] about changing your way of dress and
[1:40:00] I'll conformed to what what the word
[1:40:03] says you know and I'm going to do this
[1:40:05] because that's what's preached here
[1:40:07] listen that won't save you it's got to
[1:40:10] be a change on the inside it's got to
[1:40:13] grow from the inside out it's got to
[1:40:16] change sin's desire so when you have the
[1:40:20] world in sin and cutting hair and
[1:40:22] painting that comes out against the word
[1:40:23] of God it shows the holy spirit is not
[1:40:27] there you know it's a direct
[1:40:30] evidence so you would call it we would
[1:40:33] call it prostitution because you're
[1:40:36] you're you got two
[1:40:39] lovers you're claiming to love God and
[1:40:42] still sering sin I'm going to preach a
[1:40:45] little bit about this and I'll bring a
[1:40:47] balance here in a minute just for those
[1:40:49] of you that thinks I'm
[1:40:51] not but until then I'm going to just
[1:40:54] leave you hanging right where I've got
[1:40:56] you amen so you see you see the Bible
[1:40:59] said he that is born of God does not
[1:41:01] commit sin for he cannot sin for the
[1:41:04] seed of God remains in
[1:41:06] him so how can he sin when a sinless God
[1:41:10] is in him when he's in a s when he's in
[1:41:13] a sinless God how can he sin no matter
[1:41:16] what he's done the blood's covered him
[1:41:19] he's a new creature now he his desires
[1:41:22] and ambition is of Heaven because he's
[1:41:24] changed from a cuckle bird to a wheat
[1:41:27] his desires are not the same as it was
[1:41:30] and he displays you say I believe that
[1:41:33] and still s it nah you're deceived you
[1:41:35] see it can't display nothing but the
[1:41:40] token the token of the Holy Ghost must
[1:41:44] give power over the
[1:41:47] Destroyer are it's
[1:41:52] worthless amen just just like I said you
[1:41:55] know when I was preaching about the
[1:41:56] illegitimate child if the IL you know if
[1:41:58] the blood of Jesus Christ could not take
[1:42:01] the sin away of your parents something
[1:42:03] you never did and it would keep you out
[1:42:05] of the Rapture then the blood of Jesus
[1:42:07] Christ is no more effective than the
[1:42:09] blood of bulls and
[1:42:15] goats it took 10 generations to breed
[1:42:18] that
[1:42:19] out 10 Generations before they could
[1:42:21] come back in the house of the Lord
[1:42:22] that's how bad adultery was but by one
[1:42:27] offering he has Sanctified you forever
[1:42:31] you don't have to go 400 years back in
[1:42:33] your pedigree and prove that there is no
[1:42:35] illegitimate Birth come
[1:42:37] on you are born again you've got another
[1:42:41] birth and in that birth there is no
[1:42:45] illegitimacy
[1:42:52] Hallelujah
[1:42:54] but you know the devil wants to hold
[1:42:55] things over people's lives and let me
[1:42:57] just tell you Friends when the blood
[1:43:00] takes care of it it's all
[1:43:02] gone no matter what your mother did your
[1:43:04] daddy did your grandparents did or
[1:43:06] whatever did it's all
[1:43:09] gone
[1:43:11] amen you said well brother Tim I got a
[1:43:14] quote just read the just read the whole
[1:43:17] quote that's all just just don't stop
[1:43:20] just keep reading you'll see exactly
[1:43:23] what I'm talking about the token of the
[1:43:26] Holy Ghost gives power over the
[1:43:32] Destroyer the
[1:43:34] blood when I see the blood the Destroyer
[1:43:37] will pass over your
[1:43:40] dwelling the token of the Holy Ghost The
[1:43:44] Life of Christ gives power over the
[1:43:48] Destroyer let's go to Luke 24:49 and I
[1:43:51] want you to see this and behold I send
[1:43:54] the promise of my father upon you but
[1:43:57] tear you in Jerusalem the city of
[1:43:59] Jerusalem until you be
[1:44:05] endued with
[1:44:07] power from on
[1:44:11] high glory to
[1:44:13] God wait into the city of Jerusalem this
[1:44:16] is what his instruction and what was
[1:44:19] they going to receive they would be
[1:44:21] endued with power
[1:44:24] I want you to see the holy ghost's
[1:44:29] power so if you read acts 1 and8 you'll
[1:44:32] see also that but ye shall receive power
[1:44:37] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[1:44:41] you right amen so the Holy Ghost is
[1:44:46] power when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:44:48] it's
[1:44:50] power amen the Holy Ghost is not weak
[1:44:54] the holy ghost's power to
[1:44:57] overcome oh don't tell me that sin still
[1:45:01] has dominion over you and you got the
[1:45:02] Holy
[1:45:04] Ghost don't tell me you can't love your
[1:45:06] brother and you got the Holy
[1:45:09] Ghost that's right don't tell me you
[1:45:11] can't create the right atmosphere in
[1:45:13] your home and in the church and you have
[1:45:16] the Holy
[1:45:17] Ghost is somebody with me don't hang up
[1:45:20] on me I ain't through I got a lot more
[1:45:23] to talk about this morning to preach
[1:45:25] about amen but don't tell me that sin
[1:45:28] still has dominion over you and you got
[1:45:30] the Holy
[1:45:31] Ghost Amen in other words that you got
[1:45:34] the Holy Ghost and you still remain sin
[1:45:37] slave when the token was given when the
[1:45:42] blood was applied they were no more
[1:45:45] slaves they were free to
[1:45:49] go the blood was their Liberty
[1:45:55] amen amen the Bible
[1:45:59] said that sin shall have no more
[1:46:01] dominion over you so how can Jesus be
[1:46:05] Lord over your life and sin still reain
[1:46:09] over you
[1:46:13] too you cannot serve two
[1:46:15] masters and Christ will not share a
[1:46:18] throne with the
[1:46:20] devil amen the Bible said you you are
[1:46:23] free from sin it is no longer your
[1:46:29] master amen do you know the Holy Ghost
[1:46:32] will give you Mastery over the devil how
[1:46:35] else could you cast him
[1:46:39] out come on the Holy Ghost will give you
[1:46:42] Mastery over the devil how else will he
[1:46:44] flee from
[1:46:47] you now you see the Holy Ghost is power
[1:46:50] the word in the Greek is dunamus
[1:46:53] it's from the it's from the root word
[1:46:57] what we use in English is
[1:47:00] dynamic amen so really when we're
[1:47:02] talking about Dynamics we're talking
[1:47:04] about the power of the Holy Ghost so
[1:47:08] this is what he says when he talks about
[1:47:10] mechanics and Dynamics and the Dynamics
[1:47:13] is the power of the Holy Ghost the word
[1:47:15] without the Dynamics or the power of the
[1:47:17] Holy Ghost is no
[1:47:19] good so you see Dynamics is something is
[1:47:23] energetic it's functioning it's live
[1:47:25] it's operative it's working which
[1:47:27] describes uh which is marked by uh
[1:47:30] usually continuous continuous and
[1:47:33] productive activity or change and that
[1:47:36] which is dynamic is characterized by
[1:47:39] energy or forces that produces motion as
[1:47:42] opposed to that which is
[1:47:45] static our
[1:47:47] motionless or
[1:47:50] lifeless so I'm telling you the Holy
[1:47:52] Ghost gives
[1:47:54] unlimited
[1:47:57] strength that is at your
[1:48:02] disposal
[1:48:05] unlimited
[1:48:07] strength show me where Jesus limited
[1:48:09] even your
[1:48:11] prayer that's right ask the father
[1:48:14] anything in my name I'll do
[1:48:18] it if you would even say to this
[1:48:20] mountain and be removed and be cast in
[1:48:23] the sea it will obey you Jesus did not
[1:48:27] put limits on the power to
[1:48:30] Believers amen I'm talking to people
[1:48:33] with Mountain Moving
[1:48:36] Faith Hallelujah that has Mountain
[1:48:38] Moving power come on church amen dunamus
[1:48:42] which is power especially achieving
[1:48:46] power you know what it refers to it
[1:48:49] refers to Intrinsic our inborn power or
[1:48:52] inherit ability when you are born again
[1:48:56] you have an inherit power that you
[1:48:59] inherited from God by your new
[1:49:05] birth there's no weaknesses in God so
[1:49:07] you didn't inherit
[1:49:09] weakness you inherited weakness from
[1:49:12] your parents so did
[1:49:14] I but when from this parent and this
[1:49:16] birth there is no weakness to
[1:49:19] inherit it is the power of the ability
[1:49:21] to to car carry out a function it is a
[1:49:25] potential for functioning in some way
[1:49:27] power might strength ability capability
[1:49:30] the power residing In A Thing by virtue
[1:49:33] of its Nature by Nature you have power
[1:49:38] in you when you're born again of the
[1:49:40] Holy Ghost you have God's power in
[1:49:43] you amen you receive power from on high
[1:49:47] because of your new birth from the
[1:49:51] spirit that comes into you by the new
[1:49:53] birth it is the energy and the power to
[1:49:55] make Satan
[1:49:58] move it is the force to cast him out
[1:50:02] amen it is it is the power to complete
[1:50:06] completely defeat sin until it is
[1:50:11] dead now I know that is
[1:50:17] contrary to all of Christianity secular
[1:50:20] Christianity Today denies us power
[1:50:23] because their religion is
[1:50:28] powerless it just instructs you to do
[1:50:31] good and try to do
[1:50:35] better
[1:50:37] now and although claims are made to be
[1:50:41] converted to powerless against sin so
[1:50:46] they're like this they're described in 2
[1:50:49] Timothy 3 and5 having a form of
[1:50:54] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:50:58] so they go to
[1:51:00] church you might be that way this
[1:51:03] morning and you go to church and you
[1:51:06] have a form of godliness a profession of
[1:51:09] Faith say well I received the Holy Ghost
[1:51:13] I shouted I spoke in tongues or I danced
[1:51:15] or I did this I did that having a form
[1:51:18] of godliness but then deny the power
[1:51:24] right you you see the point is that the
[1:51:28] so-called godliness of of these men's is
[1:51:31] a
[1:51:32] sham because it's devoid of any real
[1:51:35] divine power to break the power of sin
[1:51:38] you know that and and of course those
[1:51:41] that possess the indwelling spirit and
[1:51:44] and have this Divine dunamus this power
[1:51:49] have been inherit have inherit are the
[1:51:52] born ability to wage Victorious battle
[1:51:57] with the three with the believer's three
[1:51:59] mortal enemies the World the Flesh and
[1:52:02] the
[1:52:04] devil amen all of them are seeking to
[1:52:06] turn you away from God and self the
[1:52:09] Flesh and its ungodly Unholy attributes
[1:52:12] and actions but let me tell you the Holy
[1:52:15] Ghost gives us victory over the
[1:52:18] flesh because Galatians 5:24 said they
[1:52:22] that are Christ and you can only be heed
[1:52:24] by birth and that birth is the
[1:52:27] indwelling of the spirit of God and they
[1:52:29] that are in are Christ have
[1:52:33] crucified killed the
[1:52:36] Flesh and with the affections and
[1:52:39] lust so you see we are
[1:52:43] crucified let's take an important
[1:52:45] scripture for a moment Romans 6
[1:52:48] and6 knowing this oh yeah that our old
[1:52:52] man
[1:52:53] is crucified with him that the body of
[1:52:57] sin might be destroyed that henceforth
[1:52:59] we should not serve sin so our old man
[1:53:03] is crucified with
[1:53:06] Christ if your old man is still
[1:53:10] breathing if he's still living if he's
[1:53:13] still controlling
[1:53:16] you you need to take him to the
[1:53:20] Cross get him crucified and killed out
[1:53:24] self-willed dealt with that the body of
[1:53:27] sin might be destroyed that from hisence
[1:53:30] forth or from now on we should not serve
[1:53:35] sin you see this is it if our old man is
[1:53:39] crucified from then on we do not serve
[1:53:43] sin slavery is
[1:53:47] over amen verse seven for he that is
[1:53:51] dead is freed from
[1:53:53] sin now you know if you have died that
[1:53:57] old man has died then you are freed from
[1:54:00] sin watch knowing if we be dead with
[1:54:02] Christ we believe that we shall also
[1:54:04] live with him so this is why Paul would
[1:54:07] say in Galatians 1:20 put that scripture
[1:54:10] up please Galatians 1:20 he says I am
[1:54:12] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:54:15] live not
[1:54:19] I did I get it wrong 220
[1:54:23] try again one more
[1:54:26] time I am crucified with Christ
[1:54:29] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:54:32] liveth in
[1:54:34] me and the life which I now live in the
[1:54:40] flesh I'm living a life and it's in the
[1:54:43] flesh but I live it by the faith of the
[1:54:46] Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[1:54:48] for me I'm no longer a Slave to
[1:54:54] sin Hallelujah the blood has made me
[1:54:57] free and he that the son has set free is
[1:55:01] free
[1:55:04] indeed
[1:55:08] Hallelujah so in verse 8 where we were
[1:55:11] reading in Romans 6 knowing that Christ
[1:55:14] being raised from the dead died No More
[1:55:16] Death have no more dominion over
[1:55:19] him amen so does death have dominion
[1:55:22] over for
[1:55:23] Christ it has no more dominion over you
[1:55:26] either because in that he died he died
[1:55:29] into sin once but in that he liveth he
[1:55:31] liveth to
[1:55:33] God likewise reckon yourself also to be
[1:55:36] dead indeed to sin but alive unto God
[1:55:39] through Christ Jesus Christ Our Lord let
[1:55:41] not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[1:55:45] body that you should obey it in the
[1:55:47] luster of Amen you say are you
[1:55:54] saying are you saying we are
[1:55:59] sinless I
[1:56:03] am well how is
[1:56:06] that now here I'm going to reel you back
[1:56:09] over it's is it because we never made a
[1:56:13] mistake no but it's because the desire
[1:56:17] of sin is
[1:56:20] gone and when you do make a mistake it's
[1:56:24] like stepping into a pile of
[1:56:30] manure now I got a neighbor around here
[1:56:32] that they got a dog and when I walk in
[1:56:35] their yard I have to watch for the
[1:56:40] manure I have to watch it as I go in the
[1:56:42] house and when I get into my
[1:56:44] car because I don't want to step in the
[1:56:48] stinky
[1:56:50] stuff it tracks it's smells it
[1:56:53] contaminates it gets on me and I hate
[1:56:57] it I will not purposely put my foot in
[1:57:01] the middle of
[1:57:03] it amen but if I make a
[1:57:07] mistake I will quickly wash it
[1:57:19] off and you do not do that on purpose
[1:57:22] purp but when you do Jesus blood washes
[1:57:25] you and cleanses you from all
[1:57:31] sin
[1:57:34] Hallelujah that's why he said if you sin
[1:57:36] willfully you have to come into the
[1:57:37] knowledge of the truth there's no
[1:57:39] sacrifice that remains for you in other
[1:57:41] words if you sin willfully you got to go
[1:57:43] back to Calvary cuz you don't have a
[1:57:46] sacrifice but if you got a sacrifice
[1:57:49] you're not going to be sin in willfully
[1:57:51] you're not going to be purposely doing
[1:57:53] things wrong and willfully doing things
[1:57:56] wrong oh yeah you do my you'll do things
[1:57:58] wrong you'll make mistakes along the way
[1:58:00] but it will not be something you
[1:58:03] contemplated it won't be something you
[1:58:07] desire are you with me now you see
[1:58:10] you're not living under the old Covenant
[1:58:13] and its blood because it had no power to
[1:58:16] take away sin desire it loved
[1:58:21] sin
[1:58:23] amen now the life that's in Christ came
[1:58:27] back upon the repented Sinner and that
[1:58:29] life being the perfect life of Christ
[1:58:31] sinless and righteous then the guilty
[1:58:34] one could go free for he had no desire
[1:58:36] to sin the life of Jesus had come back
[1:58:40] upon him and that's what has men in
[1:58:42] Romans 8 and2 the law of the spirit of
[1:58:46] life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
[1:58:50] from the law of sin and death hallelujah
[1:58:56] amen amen now we are
[1:59:01] sinless right but now let's think of
[1:59:06] it we are sin we are sinless because his
[1:59:09] blood has cleansed us but in the other
[1:59:13] sense I'm not
[1:59:16] sinless I got plenty of things hanging
[1:59:18] on
[1:59:21] me but every hour I confess it I
[1:59:25] constantly when I see my wrong I turn
[1:59:27] from
[1:59:28] it amen and I try to do what's right I
[1:59:31] wouldn't try to go to heaven on my
[1:59:33] merits I I wouldn't get there on my
[1:59:37] merits amen I'm trusting solemnly in
[1:59:41] Jesus
[1:59:43] Christ you know you know what I I I I do
[1:59:47] the same thing I do the same thing when
[1:59:50] I walk through that neighbor's yard and
[1:59:52] they have that dog and I watch out for
[1:59:54] the piles I do the same thing when I get
[1:59:56] on the
[1:59:59] internet I watch the piles and I avoid
[2:00:03] them not because I desire them but
[2:00:06] because I don't want to be
[2:00:10] contaminated the thing stinks and I
[2:00:12] don't want it on me and I don't want to
[2:00:14] be contaminated with
[2:00:16] it amen I hate it the desire for that is
[2:00:20] gone oh those beautiful women them women
[2:00:24] are beautiful they're the gate to
[2:00:27] hell they never make you a wife they're
[2:00:31] not even
[2:00:32] real a woman a woman like that there's a
[2:00:35] model out there she won't be a model all
[2:00:37] her life baby or two if she ever becomes
[2:00:40] a real mother it'll stretch her
[2:00:44] out I mean I'm telling you they're not
[2:00:49] real amen that's why you want a real
[2:00:51] wife a real woman that'll be a real
[2:00:53] mother and you don't want to be looking
[2:00:56] over this and trying to compare with
[2:00:58] that it's filthy and besides that it's
[2:01:01] sin the Bible said if you look upon a
[2:01:03] woman to lust after in your heart you
[2:01:05] committed adultery with her
[2:01:07] already in your heart
[2:01:11] Hallelujah so what is it you walk You
[2:01:13] Walk Through This World you're in this
[2:01:15] world but you're not of it right say
[2:01:18] well brother Tim I walk down the street
[2:01:20] and there's pornography there and then
[2:01:21] and I look over that way and there's
[2:01:23] another bunch of girls with pornography
[2:01:24] and I look over there well start looking
[2:01:27] up when you see these things come to
[2:01:29] pass turn your head and look up for your
[2:01:34] Redemption draws
[2:01:36] nigh sure we sin we make mistakes but
[2:01:39] not willfully sin desires are gone what
[2:01:42] I'm trying to do today is tell you to
[2:01:45] step up in
[2:01:46] faith amen come up into a higher
[2:01:49] sphere there there's a higher life than
[2:01:52] what you're than than that where that
[2:01:55] you are endued with power from on high
[2:01:59] where the powers of God come down as the
[2:02:02] rain from heaven and we are to live in
[2:02:05] Heavenly places where there is nothing
[2:02:07] between us and God and that that would
[2:02:11] hold back the rain from
[2:02:14] Heaven you know the nominal church with
[2:02:16] it has its cold professions just rituals
[2:02:21] and they get a little
[2:02:22] very little of the spirit because of its
[2:02:25] rituals and and and cold professions or
[2:02:29] La an umbrella holding back the
[2:02:32] spirit trusting that their profession of
[2:02:35] faith in Christ will has saved them but
[2:02:38] saved them from
[2:02:40] what still habits of porn and alcohol
[2:02:44] and cigarettes and vaping and rock and
[2:02:47] roll and wrap and all the other stuff is
[2:02:52] just a cold
[2:02:55] profession well I'm in the message
[2:02:58] brother Tim that can be a cold
[2:03:02] profession maybe some are Justified or
[2:03:05] Sanctified but they need to move
[2:03:07] higher then you get in the Full Gospel
[2:03:10] ranks of the zoza movement they get a
[2:03:13] little more many times fanaticism holds
[2:03:16] them back from the full blessings maybe
[2:03:19] get the Holy Spirit on their human
[2:03:21] spirit and and they'll shout or dance or
[2:03:23] even manifest A Gifted tongues but they
[2:03:26] too need to move higher we've got to
[2:03:29] move into that this next sphere into the
[2:03:32] fullness of the spirit where nothing
[2:03:35] neither cold forms nor rituals nor nor
[2:03:38] fanaticism holds back the blessings
[2:03:41] before we can ever have the Rapture you
[2:03:44] see God wants us to have more than
[2:03:46] ritualistic
[2:03:48] forms this would this had happened even
[2:03:51] with Israel
[2:03:52] and and God's complain against him in
[2:03:54] the in the book of Isaiah he said you
[2:03:57] have comeing with your sacrifices in
[2:04:00] your worship and you make me
[2:04:03] sick he said your your offerings you
[2:04:06] know in your sacrifices are they they
[2:04:09] nauseate me he said because you're
[2:04:13] coming in with just a ritualistic form
[2:04:17] you know and yet it's the truth you're
[2:04:19] doing exactly what I said do but you're
[2:04:22] not doing it with
[2:04:24] sincerity you're not doing it in the
[2:04:27] right atmosphere of realizing I sin I'm
[2:04:30] wrong I you know I'm bringing a lamb but
[2:04:34] it's me that should have
[2:04:37] died you see originally that that's the
[2:04:41] way it was they took this lamb they kept
[2:04:43] it up and you know it was it was a pet
[2:04:47] it was it the life meant something but
[2:04:51] after a while you know money got into it
[2:04:54] and you could just go buy your
[2:04:58] lamb you know do you ever raise
[2:05:01] something and have trouble eating
[2:05:05] it you know we were talking the other
[2:05:08] day you know I I was I was a farmer and
[2:05:10] so you know brother Craig Bo he was City
[2:05:13] Slicker come down to our place and and I
[2:05:16] gave him a bottle to feed the baby
[2:05:19] calf you know we didn't have a market
[2:05:21] well we milk goats and so we didn't have
[2:05:24] a market for the milk cuz it's illegal
[2:05:26] Louisiana to sell it so I could I could
[2:05:29] feed it to a calf and raise a calf and
[2:05:31] sell that make soap out of other things
[2:05:34] so anyway you know I could do that or
[2:05:37] make meat for the
[2:05:38] table so he looked at that little Jersey
[2:05:42] calf you know which is not really a meat
[2:05:44] animal but you know could be used for
[2:05:46] that purpose little little
[2:05:50] steer see his big brown eyes you know
[2:05:53] and and reach out his tongue and wrap it
[2:05:56] around the big nipple on that bottle and
[2:05:58] sucking he's oh this is so cute so cute
[2:06:02] what's his name I said
[2:06:04] [Laughter]
[2:06:10] tasty but you know it's like that you
[2:06:12] know when you when you know
[2:06:14] there it's sometimes hard you know to to
[2:06:18] eat Betsy when you raised
[2:06:20] her
[2:06:22] you
[2:06:23] know but but the same thing was with
[2:06:26] with them you know to begin with there
[2:06:28] was pain in
[2:06:31] this there was pain in this you know you
[2:06:33] took a a lamb and and you said I should
[2:06:37] have died but this Lamb's going to die
[2:06:40] in my
[2:06:41] place and they didn't do like we did
[2:06:45] take a 22 and end its life and then cut
[2:06:47] his throat they would hold it back there
[2:06:50] and then they would cut the juggler vein
[2:06:53] and with every heartbeat it would spray
[2:06:56] out
[2:06:58] blood and the worshipper would get blood
[2:07:01] on
[2:07:02] him I I'm sorry this is Gory I don't
[2:07:05] mean it that way I'm trying to get a
[2:07:08] point to
[2:07:09] you that it came with
[2:07:14] feeling you know with
[2:07:17] remorse of taking a life of the
[2:07:20] seriousness of a sin but it got where we
[2:07:24] just go buy one at the
[2:07:25] market we just go get one you know we
[2:07:29] just offer it well that's what we've
[2:07:30] done for
[2:07:32] Generations that's way it CS with church
[2:07:35] sometimes well Mama went to this church
[2:07:37] and Daddy went to this church and
[2:07:39] Grandpa went to this church and it
[2:07:41] begins to lose its
[2:07:44] feeling and the sincerity isn't there
[2:07:48] you know and and there there God I'll
[2:07:51] hide my face from you I don't want it it
[2:07:55] stinks in my nostrils read the book of
[2:07:57] Isaiah and you'll see it that they had
[2:08:00] come to the point that that there was
[2:08:03] the the atmosphere wasn't right the
[2:08:05] feeling wasn't there the remorse for sin
[2:08:08] wasn't there and and the Bible warns us
[2:08:12] that in the last day the church would
[2:08:14] get away from sincerity and faith that
[2:08:16] they would have a form of
[2:08:20] godliness but would deny the power
[2:08:25] thereof and God hates a powerless
[2:08:29] religion any religion that doesn't have
[2:08:32] Christ in it is
[2:08:34] powerless amen any religious that any
[2:08:37] religion that Christ in is is under his
[2:08:40] own blood and it's got power in it you
[2:08:43] know God hates a religion without power
[2:08:46] that's why he told this leoan church you
[2:08:48] are lukewarm you make me sick yeah and
[2:08:53] it will get to the place right there in
[2:08:55] the very Church itself where sin will be
[2:08:58] done and wrong is done but then the
[2:09:02] power to live above it is
[2:09:08] denied because we have a form of
[2:09:11] godliness but the power to live an
[2:09:13] overcoming life isn't there so it's
[2:09:16] never in
[2:09:20] action
[2:09:22] I'd like you to turn with me to
[2:09:23] Ephesians 1 and verse
[2:09:26] 18 in this letter to the Ephesians Paul
[2:09:29] did not pray that Believers might be
[2:09:31] given divine power but that they might
[2:09:34] be aware of the divine power they
[2:09:36] already
[2:09:38] possessed what I'm trying to tell you
[2:09:40] with the Holy Ghost you have been given
[2:09:45] power and it must be
[2:09:48] displayed it must have the inoc
[2:09:51] to ward off the
[2:09:54] destroyer in Ephesians 1:18 the eyes of
[2:09:57] your understanding be enlightened that
[2:09:59] you may know the hope of his calling and
[2:10:02] what is the riches of the glory of his
[2:10:03] inheritance of the Saints and what is
[2:10:06] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[2:10:08] usw who believe according to the working
[2:10:11] of his mighty power which he wrought in
[2:10:13] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[2:10:15] and set him at his own right hand in the
[2:10:17] Heavenly places far above all principal
[2:10:21] ologies and power and might and dominion
[2:10:24] and every name that is named not only in
[2:10:27] this world but in that which is to
[2:10:32] come ain't that a wonderful scripture
[2:10:35] look what he says I want you to
[2:10:38] understand you've been given a
[2:10:41] power and that power is the same power
[2:10:45] that raised up Jesus from the
[2:10:47] dead that quickened his mortal body so
[2:10:50] don't you know if that Holy Spirit did
[2:10:52] that to Jesus dead in the grave what
[2:10:57] will it do to you who are dead in sins
[2:11:00] and trespasses and Quicken you and make
[2:11:02] you alive in Christ Jesus it'll raise
[2:11:05] you up to serve the Living
[2:11:09] God so it is not powerless it has power
[2:11:12] in it to take a man dead for three days
[2:11:16] and raise him up again so much power
[2:11:20] that it'll take you
[2:11:21] and raise you up to walk in the newness
[2:11:24] of
[2:11:25] Life notice what it is he he raised him
[2:11:28] up far above principalities and power
[2:11:32] and might and everything that is every

[2:25:14] raw but roast it with
[2:25:16] fire you know I'm afraid that's what's
[2:25:19] wrong ain't nothing wrong with the
[2:25:22] lamb but I'm afraid the fire ain't
[2:25:25] getting around it and giving it the
[2:25:29] taste you see he don't want it boiled
[2:25:31] and flavored with some doctor to man he
[2:25:34] wants to fire the flame of the Holy
[2:25:37] Ghost to flavor the lamb to give it that
[2:25:41] Savor and as they're

[2:26:32] he's getting us ready for the journey
