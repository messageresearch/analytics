[32:26] Psalms 37 verse 35 I have been young and

[33:30] multiplied I want to preach this evening
[33:34] on preserved in Christ let's bow our
[33:36] heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly
[33:39] Father we love you with all of our heart
[33:41] and father as we come into the house of
[33:44] God and sing the songs of Zion fill the
[33:47] Spirit of God move among us our hearts
[33:50] are warmed and encouraged burdens are
[33:53] lifted faith is lifted and dear God we
[33:56] asked Lord as we gathered together may
[33:58] it not be in vain but may we unite our
[34:01] faith together collectively as the body
[34:03] of Jesus Christ flesh of your flesh and
[34:06] bone of your bone come down Lord and
[34:08] live in the hearts of your people we
[34:10] welcome you here we want you to have
[34:12] preeminence in the service
[34:14] father we commit ourselves to you we ask
[34:16] Lord God that you would send the answers
[34:18] to our hearts Lord as we have need in
[34:21] Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you
[34:25] can have your seats I cannot express the
[34:36] importance of the message of the hour
[34:39] that God has sent to us in this day and
[34:41] the treasure of the Word of God that God
[34:44] has given to us
[34:46] it is beyond words god help us never to
[34:49] allow it to be common to us never to
[34:53] lose focus of it the importance if we
[34:57] had the wealth of the world if we were
[35:00] the richest people on the face of the
[35:02] planet if we sat upon the throne of the
[35:05] world it could never compare to what we
[35:07] possess as Christians and what God has
[35:10] given us in his word
[35:12] there is no value that we can place to
[35:15] it there is nothing that we can compare
[35:18] to it it is God in letter form and to
[35:23] leave the word is to leave God but to
[35:27] receive the word is to receive God and
[35:30] in every age down through the ages as
[35:33] God revealed himself to each age he
[35:36] always revealed himself as the word can
[35:39] you say men brother Branham said in the
[35:41] church age book he said don't ever let
[35:44] anyone or anything get between you and
[35:47] the word he said for I am giving you the
[35:51] word which is the revelation of myself I
[35:54] am the word but the random said remember
[35:57] that jesus said the words that I speak
[35:59] to you they are spirit and they are life
[36:02] and to have the word is life if we
[36:07] regarded as life how many regard the
[36:10] Word of God is life Peter said Lords
[36:13] only you have the words of eternal life
[36:16] but down through the ages Satan has
[36:19] sought to devalue the word to deflect
[36:23] the word to to discredit the word to
[36:27] destroy the word to pervert the word to
[36:29] corrupt the word to corrupt the effects
[36:32] of the word in our life
[36:34] Satan is against it in every age he has
[36:37] been you look at atheists and agnostics
[36:40] and how they discredit the story of Noah
[36:43] how they discredit the story of Jonah
[36:46] how they just kind of watered-down the
[36:49] Bible laugh at it or market but yet God
[36:52] has preserved his word down through the
[36:55] ages down through all of the skeptics
[36:58] and all of the agnostics down through
[37:01] all the ages yet jesus said heaven and
[37:05] earth shall pass away but my word will
[37:08] never pass away it will
[37:11] for God's trucks will endure this
[37:14] promise will endure he'll endure forever
[37:18] because the word is God can you say Amen
[37:21] brother branham was talking about a
[37:24] family in his church he said Satan had
[37:27] destroyed their home and their living he
[37:30] said they had a trailer everything was
[37:32] burnt to a crisp and he said that the
[37:35] only thing that was left surviving was a
[37:37] couple books by brother Branham brother
[37:40] Osbourne and he said no in a blessed ol
[37:43] Bible he said it was the only thing that
[37:45] survived the fire he said one day I'll
[37:48] take a text that heaven and earth will
[37:51] pass away but my word will never fail
[37:54] brother Branham when he was preaching in
[37:56] 1937 he had his maybe it's Wednesday or
[38:00] Sunday service he had his Bible open he
[38:03] had left and brother Branham said almost
[38:05] overnight the 1937 flood come if you
[38:09] remember he said water went right over
[38:11] top of the tabernacle and he said that
[38:14] the pulpit went plumb up to the ceiling
[38:16] and all of the pews went plumb up to the
[38:19] ceiling his Bible was there on the
[38:22] pulpit and he said it was open to a
[38:24] scripture when he said he went right
[38:26] over top of the tabernacle in a boat we
[38:30] now all the waters receded but the
[38:32] random came in to the tabernacle that
[38:34] same Bible was open to the same
[38:36] scripture that he had preached from
[38:38] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[38:42] words shall never fail how many
[38:44] appreciate the word of God it is life to
[38:47] those that regarded his life and Satan's
[38:51] attack is upon the Word of God the word
[38:54] of life the message of life but to them
[38:57] that regarded his life they will live
[39:00] forever because the word is him
[39:03] and they abide in the word forever all
[39:07] through history Satan's attack has been
[39:10] upon the Word of God
[39:12] Diocletian how he hid band bibles and
[39:16] shut down churches down to the ages men
[39:19] have corrupted it in their translations
[39:21] and so forth but they have never been
[39:23] able to stop it down to the ages they
[39:26] banned it men come under a burden to
[39:29] copy it to translate it and to preserve
[39:31] it and notice these men like Tyndale and
[39:35] so forth
[39:36] that protected the Word of God they were
[39:39] fighting for a sealed book they laid
[39:43] down their life's blood for a book that
[39:45] was sealed what a happy people we ought
[39:49] to be tonight to know that we're not
[39:51] standing for a sealed book but were
[39:54] standing for a revealed book that God
[39:57] has sent to his people it is divine it
[40:01] comes from the heart of Almighty God can
[40:04] you say men brother Branham said after
[40:07] 1900 years of criticism trying to
[40:11] destroy the Bible infidels have rised
[40:14] and fallen persecutions of more
[40:17] persecutions upon this Bible than any
[40:20] book in the world but yet it still
[40:24] remains aren't you happy and you think
[40:29] of how many people have sacrificed their
[40:31] life so we could have a Bible in our lap
[40:34] tonight men that have given the supreme
[40:37] price died spent their entire life
[40:40] translating or persecuted or running but
[40:44] the Word of God has been preserved
[40:46] because it's not the words of a man
[40:49] that's the words of God and every time
[40:52] we read this blessed old book it blesses
[40:55] our heart because God reveals something
[40:57] more isn't that amazing you can read a
[41:01] scripture a hundred times but it never
[41:03] loses its value we can come here
[41:06] Wednesday and Sunday Wednesday and
[41:08] Sunday and there's always something else
[41:10] that's released to us out of it how many
[41:12] appreciate the word of God
[41:14] you know brother Brennan told a story
[41:16] about how they had found the Garner's of
[41:19] Joseph the grain Garner's of Joseph and
[41:22] in there they found grain that he had
[41:25] stored up in their time of famine and
[41:27] they took that grain and they put it in
[41:29] the ground and buried it and you know
[41:31] what
[41:32] it came to life brother Branham said
[41:34] they found a sunflower seed in King
[41:36] Tut's tomb and they took it they planted
[41:39] it after a four thousand year old seed
[41:42] or say you know five thousand-year-old
[41:44] seed they planted it in the ground and
[41:46] you know what it came up because there
[41:50] was the germ of life that was preserved
[41:53] in that seat and though many read the
[41:57] Bible persecute the babe there is a term
[41:59] of life in this word that the devil can
[42:03] never stop because it is life God's life
[42:08] is in his words God is his word he loved
[42:14] the Lord that's why it is the Word of
[42:16] God that brings forth every revival
[42:20] every revival in history was based upon
[42:24] the Word of God every awakening that
[42:27] awakened churches awaken nations
[42:29] affected the nations came by the Word of
[42:33] God because life is in the Word of God
[42:36] every revival that ever happened was
[42:40] because men began to regard the word as
[42:43] life received it thus an awakening took
[42:46] place you love the Lord every time that
[42:51] men died in his tracks is when he left
[42:54] the word every time God judge donation
[42:58] is because he left the word and Satan
[43:02] always tries to destroy the word and if
[43:05] he can't destroy the word he destroys
[43:07] the effects of the word the effects of
[43:11] the word in your life jesus said that
[43:13] day by their tradition he said make the
[43:16] Word of God of none effect
[43:19] see there's an effect that comes by the
[43:21] word of God to those that believe it it
[43:24] heals those that believe it it's sane
[43:26] souls that believes that it brings joy
[43:29] to those how Satan would like to
[43:32] discredit it to you to just devalue it
[43:35] to you so your attention is off on
[43:38] something else that really don't matter
[43:41] amen and so Satan will always try and
[43:45] you watch the fanaticism that follows
[43:48] every revival God sends the word a
[43:51] revival breaks and fanaticism will
[43:54] follow it to try to throw off on the
[43:56] truth the devil turns all kinds of false
[43:59] things and so forth brother Branham said
[44:02] now people as brother said this morning
[44:06] pulling splinters he said 19 different
[44:09] nails today organizations are claiming
[44:13] that they have the original nail that
[44:16] went into Jesus hand he said what if it
[44:19] was he said I wouldn't want anything to
[44:22] do with it god never left us relics and
[44:25] tokens he said the Holy Ghost something
[44:30] that cannot be destroyed he sent the
[44:34] Holy Ghost something alive a nail what
[44:37] good would it do me the original cross
[44:39] what good would it do me to know him his
[44:43] life now we're holding nails and relics
[44:47] and holding on to places like city of
[44:50] Jerusalem that ain't got nothing to do
[44:52] with it the thing is condemned it is
[44:56] rotten it is gone he said I went to
[44:59] church and Rome where they rubbed the
[45:01] skulls of the people's heads and so
[45:04] forth bunch of nonsense and superstition
[45:07] God sent the Holy Spirit the life of God
[45:11] to be in you not a nail not a place not
[45:16] a history but a living reality of God's
[45:20] Word made flesh
[45:22] in you in the church God is not trying
[45:25] to preserve history God is trying to
[45:28] preserve his words in us glory God is
[45:35] preserving us for the future home the
[45:41] world if he can't destroy the word then
[45:44] he destroys the vessel in whom the word
[45:47] of truth dwells amen do you love the
[45:51] Lord
[45:52] notice this genesis 3:15 if you're
[45:55] writing it down you don't have to turn
[45:57] there and now I'll put enmity between
[46:00] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[46:04] and her seed in it shall bruise thy head
[46:07] and thou shalt bruise his heel this was
[46:12] a prophecy it was the first one speaking
[46:14] of Christ and the devil must have really
[46:17] aroused and paid real close attention
[46:20] when he heard the word thy seed because
[46:24] he was showing the Messiah was coming
[46:26] that would destroy the devil but it
[46:29] would come through a seed it would come
[46:32] through a genealogy so Satan begins to
[46:35] watch the genealogies it begins to watch
[46:39] the righteous line and so Cain races up
[46:43] and he attacks Abel thinking he will
[46:47] stop the plan and purpose of God by
[46:51] stopping the righteous seed that was
[46:53] coming down and when Cain killed Abel
[46:56] God rose up Seth
[46:59] a type of death burial resurrection God
[47:04] would bring forth of seed no matter what
[47:07] the devil could produce and the devil
[47:10] began to attack the plan of God watch
[47:14] him in the time of Moses he tries to
[47:17] attack and cut off the seed watch him in
[47:20] the time of Joseph and he's always
[47:23] trying to stop God's program
[47:26] and brother branham said he can almost
[47:29] see it before it gets there Satan as
[47:32] always he tried to cut off Moses he
[47:35] tried to kill all the male children he
[47:37] cut off a bow
[47:39] watching because Abel was the chosen
[47:41] tool that God was going to use Moses was
[47:46] the chosen tool Pharaoh was the Chum
[47:49] sorry the Joseph was the tool that God
[47:52] was going to use but brother Branham
[47:54] says this now God had somebody that
[47:58] would serve Him and his purpose will not
[48:01] be defeated nothing will defeat the
[48:05] purpose of God's plan no hydrogen bombs
[48:09] in the world can defeat the resurrection
[48:12] of his church he said all the explaining
[48:15] of way mathematics and intelligence he
[48:18] said to destroy the faith of God's
[48:20] children it'll never do it this faith
[48:23] will live on forever don't you love the
[48:27] Lord remember the days of Noah Noah now
[48:33] and good and Noah's day the world's had
[48:36] become corrupt they began to build
[48:38] cities man's imaginations were
[48:42] continually evil man's hearts were
[48:45] continually set upon evil God said I'll
[48:49] destroy man whom I have created the
[48:53] Bible said but Noah found grace in the
[48:55] eyes sight of God and so when God
[48:58] destroyed the earth there was one man
[49:01] one seed that God would preserve to
[49:05] carry his promise through the judgments
[49:08] though he would destroy all the earth
[49:11] every living creature that had breath
[49:14] would die every mountain washed away
[49:17] then the floods would cover the whole
[49:19] earth God would preserve one man with a
[49:22] vision who would stand by the Word of
[49:25] God see God preserving his own words and
[49:32] everything was destroyed everything was
[49:35] utterly destroyed under the judgments of
[49:38] God dead bodies are floating everywhere
[49:41] it's desolation but yet in an arc here
[49:45] is God's seed they're being carried
[49:48] right through all the judgments when
[49:51] nothing could live God preserved his
[49:54] seeds when nothing on earth could
[49:57] breathe God was preserving his seed hey
[50:02] God sometimes that are being reduced to
[50:05] one but God will preserve a seed upon
[50:07] the face of the earth God preserved his
[50:11] purpose in Noah because God had already
[50:14] made the promise thy seed will bruise
[50:18] the head of the serpent he'd already
[50:20] made that promise he could not back off
[50:23] that promise he had to fulfill it and
[50:26] Appling brother Branham said I'm so
[50:28] happy he said how happy we ought to be
[50:31] today resting upon the beautiful
[50:34] revelation of the word of the Living God
[50:36] that there neither things present nor
[50:39] things to come nor sickness nor sorrow
[50:41] nor death nor perils nothing will
[50:44] separate us from the purpose of the
[50:46] Living God what God imagines in his mind
[50:49] what God purposed and it's hard to bring
[50:52] the past there is no devil
[50:54] there is no power there is nothing that
[50:57] can separate us from the eternal plan
[51:00] what God said then we find in the day
[51:04] that all the world would be destroyed
[51:05] God preserved his purpose and Noah he
[51:10] made his own purpose God he will have a
[51:13] church he will protect the people he
[51:16] will protect his domain that death
[51:19] cannot destroy it what an assurance upon
[51:23] the solid rock the resurrection of our
[51:27] Blessed lover
[51:28] nothing will destroy it it has been
[51:31] planted it is
[51:33] seat of God it is the purpose of God to
[51:36] give you the Holy Ghost
[51:38] it is God's purpose to show signs
[51:40] wonders and miracles
[51:43] it is God's purpose and nothing will
[51:45] destroy it
[51:47] he said teacher sir who will rise isms
[51:51] will rise there may be things that look
[51:54] like that it would be destroyed but it
[51:57] will never be destroyed
[51:59] it is God's purpose to see that it
[52:02] prevails it's up to God we can rest
[52:06] assured that God will never let our
[52:08] heritage be destroyed he is purposed
[52:12] to give it to us don't you love the Lord
[52:15] God's gonna have a family God is gonna
[52:19] have a future home God and you have a
[52:23] seat there you have a home there I've
[52:27] gone to prepare you a place he did not
[52:30] build you a place to see you come short
[52:33] but God put your name there knowing you
[52:37] would be there knowing he would preserve
[52:39] you in this dark hour he sent the Holy
[52:43] Ghost to seal you and to hold you it
[52:47] ain't you holy God is God holding you
[52:50] you're not here by coincidence don't let
[52:54] the devil tell you that you're here by
[52:56] the keeping power of God
[53:00] angels of God and camp about them that
[53:03] fear the Lord God has watched over you
[53:07] you've been the very apple of his eye
[53:10] God is watching over his word to protect
[53:14] it you watching it brother Branham said
[53:18] God would bankrupt the heavens before he
[53:21] lets his word go defeated how many
[53:24] believe that I want you to watch your
[53:28] you are Abraham how many Abraham seed is
[53:31] there God made a promise to Abraham and
[53:37] he told him through thy seed all nations
[53:42] of the earth will be blessed so God's
[53:45] purpose was wrapped up in one man in one
[53:48] place in that age
[53:50] God's purpose was all God invested it
[53:55] all in one man and one woman think about
[54:00] it even in their mistakes God preserved
[54:06] his seed
[54:08] remember when Abraham and I love it
[54:10] because Abraham staggered not at the
[54:12] promise of God through unbelief but was
[54:14] strong giving praise to God but yet the
[54:16] Bible tells he did stagger
[54:19] I mean think of the coward of a man that
[54:23] would not even stand for his wife
[54:25] could you imagine Sarah's face when he
[54:28] looked at him and said she's my sister
[54:31] she by abrahamic shut up woman
[54:34] I could imagine well that's just your
[54:41] sister I think I'll have that girls my
[54:44] wife she looks I mean think about it
[54:54] under pressure you know the Lord so
[54:59] brother branham talks about ambling and
[55:01] he said ambling was a righteous man and
[55:04] so he said he got his hot bath that
[55:06] night put on his jammies his little hat
[55:10] lays down on his bed sticks this great
[55:13] big old feet up on the bed Wiggles his
[55:15] toes feeling happy and free hands behind
[55:18] his head just think about it tomorrow
[55:21] I'm gonna have that man sister what a
[55:25] time that'll be wonderful he goes to
[55:28] sleep
[55:28] having the sweetest of dreams and future
[55:31] home white picket fences just think
[55:34] about it
[55:35] fairest woman in the land and God comes
[55:38] and said you're as good as a dead man
[55:42] you know brother branham said he said
[55:45] Lord his name Blake said Lord you know
[55:49] the integrity of my heart that man could
[55:52] have told me he didn't have to lie he's
[55:56] the one that lied he's the one that
[55:58] backslidden brought her into my kingdom
[56:02] Lord I'm innocent
[56:04] he said that's right but that's my
[56:06] prophet and if he don't pray for you
[56:09] I'll wipe out your whole nation brother
[56:14] Branham said think about it she said do
[56:17] you see what grace does could you
[56:19] imagine
[56:20] Abraham doing a trick like that he said
[56:23] you talk about a coward he said am black
[56:26] that night the Lord appeared to him said
[56:29] you're as good as a dead man you have
[56:31] that man's wife he said Lord you know
[56:34] the integrity of my heart
[56:35] he said you look at the grace to his
[56:37] prophet when he was wrong he said he
[56:41] said I won't hear your prayers you give
[56:44] him his wife back restore her back but
[56:48] the Branham said why was it why was it
[56:50] grace he said because through Sarah she
[56:55] was the bloodline to the Jewish race and
[56:58] out of that blood
[56:59] would come the Messiah and God already
[57:02] made a promise that through her the
[57:05] Messiah would come this was not about
[57:08] Abraham this was not about Sarah this
[57:11] was about a promise that God had made
[57:14] and God would bankrupt heaven before he
[57:19] let Amla touch her
[57:20] that's why brother Branham said amazing
[57:23] grace it's not about you it's not about
[57:27] me it's about God's unconditional
[57:30] promise in this hour you'll have a bride
[57:34] you'll have a church restore her Satan
[57:39] take your hand off of her it's about
[57:43] God's promise he'll bankrupt heaven
[57:47] before he backs off of it God will have
[57:50] a church whose fullness of God dwells in
[57:53] her Sarah's the type of the true church
[57:59] she's a type of when he said restore her
[58:02] no man could touch her because he had
[58:07] already put his purpose in one man
[58:11] everything was invested in one man just
[58:15] think about your position here God in
[58:19] all the world not all churches but one
[58:22] woman and God has invested his entire
[58:26] purpose in one Church in this thing
[58:31] and he said restore her no man could
[58:36] touch her no devil can touch you no
[58:39] counsel treasures can touch her you're
[58:42] under the preserving power of Almighty
[58:45] God he is our shield that's what he told
[58:49] Abraham I am your shield an exceeding
[58:52] great reward
[58:53] a company of angels are surrounding you
[58:57] you can't breathe without my knowing it
[58:59] you can't do anything without my knowing
[59:02] it and even in your mistakes my grace is
[59:06] sufficient Sara was a type of the true
[59:10] church she was a type of the true
[59:12] Pentecostal church and he says don't you
[59:16] touch her take your hands off of her if
[59:20] God protected the natural seed how much
[59:23] more will he protect this seat how much
[59:27] more will God watch over touch not my
[59:30] anointed touch not the oil and the wine
[59:36] did you know brother Branham said Sara
[59:39] when the visitation of the angels
[59:41] she laughed up her sleeve he said he
[59:44] could have struck her dead because of
[59:46] her unbelief but he could not God could
[59:52] not because he already made a promise to
[59:57] Abraham and she was flesh of his flesh
[1:00:00] and bone of his bone and brother Adam
[1:00:03] said he cannot kill us though we deserve
[1:00:07] it though we're guilty of Hell he cannot
[1:00:11] because we are tied into Christ we are
[1:00:15] flesh of his flesh and bone of us bone
[1:00:17] we are preserved in Christ
[1:00:21] oh yeah God's grace is holding us it
[1:00:27] ain't nothing about us it's all about
[1:00:29] God's promise restore her restore her
[1:00:36] back he loved the Lord see God invested
[1:00:41] his purpose in Abraham remember Joseph
[1:00:46] Joseph you know loved of his father
[1:00:48] hated of his brethren God had sowed his
[1:00:52] purpose into Joseph and remember how he
[1:00:57] got in trouble because of what God was
[1:00:59] showing him he said we were all binding
[1:01:02] sheaves out in the field and all the
[1:01:04] eleven sheaves bowed down to my sheaf it
[1:01:06] made him angry he said but wait wait
[1:01:09] I've got another dream he said then the
[1:01:12] Sun and the moon and all the stars bowed
[1:01:15] down to mine and they hated him because
[1:01:19] God was working something out Joseph was
[1:01:23] gifted
[1:01:24] Josef's God's hand was on Joseph he had
[1:01:27] a coat of many colors meaning he was the
[1:01:30] Covenant child God's promise was to
[1:01:33] Joseph just like the rainbow covenant to
[1:01:35] Noah God's purpose wasn't Noah God's
[1:01:38] purpose wasn't Moses
[1:01:40] God's purpose wasn't Joseph God was
[1:01:45] showing his purpose was wrapped up in
[1:01:47] one to save the entire age and so he
[1:01:52] gets sold off I thought of Joseph much
[1:01:55] have been a 17 year old boy how homesick
[1:01:58] he must have been how confused he must
[1:02:02] have been when he went to Potiphar's
[1:02:04] house and it just he can see God
[1:02:07] blessing him in every decision he makes
[1:02:09] making the way for everything that he
[1:02:12] does but then everything goes south with
[1:02:16] Potiphar's wife then he gets put in the
[1:02:19] lower dungeon sitting in the in the
[1:02:21] darkest regions of of prison thinking
[1:02:25] how is that vision ever going to come to
[1:02:27] pass you know he'll test our faith he'll
[1:02:31] test our faith do we
[1:02:32] believe what we say we believe you say I
[1:02:36] believe this message is of God even in
[1:02:38] our darkest trials even in our hardest
[1:02:43] times even when things go wrong and God
[1:02:46] don't tell us why they're wrong and this
[1:02:50] isn't just a week and it's over this is
[1:02:53] years of missing his daddy and being in
[1:02:56] a foreign land and Egyptians and their
[1:02:59] culture and their food and everything
[1:03:01] about it not only that not just Egypt
[1:03:05] but the very worst part of Egypt a
[1:03:07] prison cell how confused Joseph must
[1:03:13] have been but then God starts prosper
[1:03:16] him in a prison Lord where are you I'd
[1:03:19] see you in prison but I don't know what
[1:03:22] you're doing up so confused anyone ever
[1:03:27] been there but brother branham said the
[1:03:30] vision had to come to pass or the dream
[1:03:33] and so now he was he was a slave for
[1:03:37] many years
[1:03:38] he's an impossible situation but yet
[1:03:42] God's purpose his and Joseph Dean of the
[1:03:47] Lord God is good so then all of a sudden
[1:03:51] things take a turn Pharaoh has a dream
[1:03:56] that nobody can interpret and out of
[1:03:59] nowhere they remember Joseph after two
[1:04:01] years they remember all there's a man
[1:04:05] that interprets dreams he comes before
[1:04:07] Pharaoh he interprets a dream and that
[1:04:10] he rises to the top over night let me
[1:04:12] tell you the salvation of Jehovah will
[1:04:15] come in the blink of an eye it can turn
[1:04:19] around overnight things can change
[1:04:21] overnight things can change right now
[1:04:25] because the salvation of Jehovah
[1:04:28] calm in the blink of an eye one moment
[1:04:32] here's a prisoner the next moment every
[1:04:35] knee is bowing God don't need years God
[1:04:39] just needs willing hearts believe him
[1:04:42] that are ready ready to step out on the
[1:04:46] front line glory they believe God no
[1:04:51] matter what the circumstance prison cell
[1:04:54] or no prison cell homesick or no
[1:04:58] homesick ready to do the will of God no
[1:05:02] matter what the cost
[1:05:04] all the 7/7 famine years begin to strike
[1:05:10] and all of a sudden the prophecy begins
[1:05:13] to form
[1:05:14] God's purpose brought Joseph all the way
[1:05:18] to this point and notice power without
[1:05:22] character satanic Joseph had some trials
[1:05:26] to go through Joseph had some schooling
[1:05:28] to go through before he could make
[1:05:30] decisions for Egypt we think that our
[1:05:33] our trials are hurting us there were
[1:05:35] only betraying us for the power that God
[1:05:38] wants to invest in his people glory
[1:05:43] the prophecy begins to take form turn
[1:05:46] with me to Genesis chapter 45 verse 1 we
[1:05:50] come to the climax now of the entire
[1:05:54] story God's story the whole story of
[1:05:57] Joseph is to bring us to one place and
[1:06:00] this is where where I want to look at in
[1:06:03] Genesis chapter 45 verse 1 when Joseph
[1:06:07] is revealing himself to his brother and
[1:06:10] watch this now in verse 1 and Joseph
[1:06:13] could not refrain himself
[1:06:15] before all of them that stood by and he
[1:06:18] cried cause every man to go from me it's
[1:06:23] a type of the rapture and there stood no
[1:06:25] man with him while Joseph made himself
[1:06:28] known unto his brethren and he wept
[1:06:31] aloud and all the Egyptians in the house
[1:06:35] of Pharaoh heard it
[1:06:36] and Joseph said to his brother I am
[1:06:39] Joseph just my father yet live his
[1:06:44] brethren could not answer him for they
[1:06:46] were troubled at his presence and Joseph
[1:06:49] said unto his brother and come near to
[1:06:51] me I pray you and they came near and he
[1:06:55] said I am Joseph your brother who you
[1:06:58] sold into Egypt verse 5 now therefore be
[1:07:02] not grieved or angry with yourself that
[1:07:05] you sold me here for God did send me
[1:07:09] before you to preserve life for these 2
[1:07:13] years have to famine been in the land
[1:07:15] yet there are five more years in which
[1:07:18] there neither be earring nor harvest
[1:07:20] watch verse 7 and God sent me before you
[1:07:24] to preserve a posterity in the earth to
[1:07:28] save your lives by a great deliverance
[1:07:32] in other words a posterity is a
[1:07:35] surviving remnant in other words the
[1:07:38] seed of Abraham would have been
[1:07:40] destroyed by that famine but God had to
[1:07:44] preserve the line of Abraham in order
[1:07:46] for the Messiah to come and God invested
[1:07:50] his purpose into one Joseph to save us
[1:07:54] righteous line that the Messiah could
[1:07:57] come God took years to do it the seed of
[1:08:05] Abraham would have been wiped out but
[1:08:08] God preserved his seed then in the
[1:08:13] revelation of Jesus Christ we find out
[1:08:17] that it's more than story of Joseph and
[1:08:19] his brethren but it was a type of the
[1:08:22] blinding of the Jews that God might save
[1:08:25] a Gentile people he was preserving life
[1:08:29] in the world who God preserving a seed
[1:08:35] Joseph dies and he says as he's dying
[1:08:39] his dying breath God will visit you and
[1:08:44] he dies there rises up a pharaoh who
[1:08:49] knows not Joe
[1:08:50] and then the prophecies come to pass as
[1:08:54] Egypt begins to afflict the children of
[1:08:56] Israel for 400 years but it was the time
[1:09:00] that the deliverer was to come and just
[1:09:04] as the time that Moses was to come you
[1:09:07] find out that God rose up midwives that
[1:09:10] fear God and would not kill the children
[1:09:13] like they were trying to get him to do
[1:09:15] and God bless those women for preserving
[1:09:19] Moses or preserving the lives of the
[1:09:21] children rather and then as the devil
[1:09:24] was trying to cut off God preserved a
[1:09:28] seed of Moses as the Bible said chock a
[1:09:31] bed hid him for three months then the
[1:09:37] Bible said she couldn't hide him no more
[1:09:39] and I don't want to go through all the
[1:09:41] story it's beautiful the way brother
[1:09:42] Adam describes it but he said
[1:09:44] Amram had a dream to build an ark and
[1:09:46] jakka bet makes yaki exactly they go
[1:09:49] down about three in the morning down to
[1:09:50] the Nile River and now she's going to
[1:09:53] push her baby out into a Nile River
[1:09:56] swarming with crocodiles heads the size
[1:09:59] of elephants and just munching on babies
[1:10:02] and munching and now she's gonna put her
[1:10:04] baby and a now pull of crocodiles this
[1:10:07] is not a mother this is an act of faith
[1:10:10] that God had told her put him in an ark
[1:10:14] shove him out into a crocodile-infested
[1:10:17] River tails are swishing jaws are
[1:10:21] stopping but when she commits it to God
[1:10:24] angels form a line
[1:10:27] the river they draw their swords and
[1:10:30] they're escorting the baby right to a
[1:10:33] predestinated place guru crocodiles open
[1:10:40] their mouths
[1:10:41] angels break their teeth then that's a
[1:10:44] little precious cargo goes over the
[1:10:47] whirlpools and over around and straps
[1:10:50] back over the top what is it God is
[1:10:53] preserving his purpose and Moses as it's
[1:10:59] gone down the little now river imagine
[1:11:03] shining angels or escorting this
[1:11:05] precious thing till it comes right to
[1:11:10] its pre decimated place where God is
[1:11:12] going to raise the deliverer right under
[1:11:15] the nose of Pharaoh God is going to
[1:11:21] destroy Egypt he's not going to use Scud
[1:11:25] missiles weapons have mended mass
[1:11:28] destructions he's going to use his
[1:11:31] secret weapon mother because it's going
[1:11:37] to be a godly mother his saying you were
[1:11:39] born with a purpose God's purpose is
[1:11:42] wrapped in your child always believe in
[1:11:45] God
[1:11:45] always love God he's gonna use your one
[1:11:48] day brother branham said it was her that
[1:11:51] developed the character of Moses
[1:11:53] now Moses has in him what he needs to
[1:11:57] deliver Israel from the jaws of the most
[1:12:00] powerful military that the world has
[1:12:03] ever known
[1:12:04] so God says turn them loose let my
[1:12:07] people go and Pharaoh says no I don't
[1:12:12] think that I'll do it and so God starts
[1:12:16] dropping plagues all over Egypt but
[1:12:20] while God's plagues are falling like
[1:12:22] bombs not one plague touched Israel
[1:12:26] they were in Goshen and they were
[1:12:28] preserved and Goshen they were preserved
[1:12:32] from death they were preserved under the
[1:12:35] blood they were preserved by God amen
[1:12:42] God preserved Israel when they left his
[1:12:46] Egypt he preserved him in the wilderness
[1:12:48] turn with me to Hosea chapter 12 verse
[1:12:51] 13 Hosea chapter 12 verse 13 I love the
[1:13:02] word of God it's a wonderful food for
[1:13:05] the Soul sheepy food how many love
[1:13:08] sheepy food Hosea chapter 12 verse 13 by
[1:13:15] a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of
[1:13:18] Egypt and by a prophet he is preserved
[1:13:27] that was the first Exodus this is the
[1:13:31] last Exodus and God has preserved us in
[1:13:35] this day by a prophet of God you know
[1:13:42] Joshua went into the land of promise
[1:13:44] fought joints brother Branham said
[1:13:46] without a scratch when David had become
[1:13:50] king from the time he was anointed he
[1:13:52] went through ten years of hellish
[1:13:54] haggling but the Bible said God
[1:13:55] preserved David in all of his comings
[1:13:59] and goings God preserved him everywhere
[1:14:02] that he went that means to keep from
[1:14:04] injury to keep from harm and I want to
[1:14:09] just I've got a little time can I carry
[1:14:11] on when God used to Elisha to prophesy a
[1:14:18] famine that it would not rain till he
[1:14:21] called for it you find that a famine
[1:14:25] struck the land of Israel and they
[1:14:28] didn't have Red Cross and humanitarian
[1:14:31] efforts to help the people in a time of
[1:14:33] crisis I mean there was really people
[1:14:37] starving
[1:14:38] cattle was starving people were dying
[1:14:42] but during this time that judgment was
[1:14:46] upon the earth God takes Elijah up to
[1:14:49] the brook of Sidra he's dropping down
[1:14:52] sandwiches to him he's drinking out of
[1:14:55] the brook God had preserved his faithful
[1:14:58] servant that stood by the word in a time
[1:15:01] of famine Jezebel was as wretched as
[1:15:04] they come but Jezebel had a daughter
[1:15:07] that was worse than her
[1:15:08] stay with me pay real close attention
[1:15:11] her name was a kalila and after Lila
[1:15:14] married to harem the son of Jehoshaphat
[1:15:17] the king of Judah if you remember a hat
[1:15:20] was the king of Israel Jehoshaphat was
[1:15:23] the king of Judah because Israel had
[1:15:25] split into two sides back in that day
[1:15:27] and so the daughter of Jezebel married
[1:15:31] the son of Jehoshaphat and two harem
[1:15:35] done evil in the sight of the Lord as he
[1:15:37] murdered his six younger brothers and if
[1:15:41] you'll remember to harem died of a
[1:15:44] disease in the bowels and the Bible said
[1:15:46] he departed without being desired sin
[1:15:49] he'll take you farther than you want to
[1:15:51] go so to harem had a son by the name of
[1:15:54] a hazy eye and a hazy eye rained one
[1:15:57] year in Johor instead but a hazy I was
[1:16:01] killed by Jehu who was given anointed of
[1:16:05] God to cut off the house of Ahab and it
[1:16:08] was at that time kalila realizes that
[1:16:11] the throne is vacant and she begins to
[1:16:14] kill all the royal seed trying to
[1:16:18] destroy the lineage and she killed her
[1:16:22] own grandchildren she was a wicked woman
[1:16:26] and she was trying to cut off the house
[1:16:29] of David and defiance to God's promise
[1:16:33] that out of your throne will reign the
[1:16:36] seed of David forever
[1:16:38] it was the devil trying to discredit
[1:16:42] God's Word but God's perp
[1:16:44] was in the lineage of the David and
[1:16:46] while a kalila is killing her own infant
[1:16:50] grandchildren and killing all the royal
[1:16:53] seed in the land Jehoshaphat takes joash
[1:16:59] and hides him the Bible said she stole
[1:17:04] him one of the Kings s sons and hid him
[1:17:07] in the house of God for six years see
[1:17:12] down to the ages God always raises up
[1:17:15] protectors like the midwives and the
[1:17:18] time to Moses are down to the ages God
[1:17:21] would always raise up people with a
[1:17:23] burden to protect the Lord and Joel Ash
[1:17:27] was hiding in the house of God for six
[1:17:30] years that's why he was safe because
[1:17:33] atha lillah didn't go to church and God
[1:17:38] knew she wouldn't find him there and
[1:17:41] notice this the place of his safety was
[1:17:45] the house of the Lord turn with me if
[1:17:49] you would to Psalms 27 verse 1 this
[1:17:52] scripture ought to be very familiar to
[1:17:54] you Psalms 27 verse 1 the Lord is my
[1:17:59] light and my salvation whom shall I fear
[1:18:04] the Lord is the strength of my life and
[1:18:07] whom should I be afraid with the wicked
[1:18:10] even mine enemies and foes came upon me
[1:18:13] to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[1:18:15] fell the hosts Shallon camp against me
[1:18:18] my heart shall not fear the war should
[1:18:22] rise against me in this will I be
[1:18:24] confident one thing have I desired of
[1:18:27] the Lord that I would seek after that I
[1:18:29] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:18:31] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:18:34] of the Lord and to enquire in his temple
[1:18:37] watch verse 5 for in a time of trouble
[1:18:40] he will hide me in here
[1:18:43] pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:18:46] he will hide me
[1:18:48] sometimes God seed it dwindles down very
[1:18:52] low sometimes it will even be one that
[1:18:55] God invests his whole purpose in but
[1:18:59] nothing will ever destroy the purpose of
[1:19:02] the Living God it was in the seventh
[1:19:05] year how did the temple came forth King
[1:19:09] Josh and they revealed that he had been
[1:19:12] preserved down through those years do
[1:19:16] you love the Lord God had someone that
[1:19:20] would serve Him
[1:19:21] so his purpose would not be defeated
[1:19:25] fire cannot defeat God's plan he said
[1:19:30] I'd love to say this is spoiling all the
[1:19:32] hydrogen bombs in the world can never
[1:19:35] defeat the resurrection of his church
[1:19:37] all the explaining away all the math
[1:19:41] nothing will destroy the faith of God's
[1:19:43] children is it an amazing how the Jews
[1:19:49] are so hated it's because the devil
[1:19:52] knows the promise and the purpose
[1:19:54] wrapped in the Jewish race so that's why
[1:19:57] we see Hitler do what he did but that
[1:19:59] spirit of Hitler lived in Haven when
[1:20:02] Haman wanted to exterminate all the Jews
[1:20:05] but it was at that time God takes a
[1:20:07] little orphan girl puts her in the
[1:20:09] throne for such a time as this to
[1:20:12] preserve the seat of his realm finally
[1:20:18] that seed came finally that seed came
[1:20:23] that seed came that seed of a woman a
[1:20:25] saviour to the world God made flesh
[1:20:28] Herod tried to destroy it but he could
[1:20:32] not destroy the seed they could not stop
[1:20:35] him they kicked him out of church they
[1:20:38] they tried to stop it but nothing could
[1:20:40] stop him they crucified Him they could
[1:20:43] not stop it
[1:20:44] they put a seal over the tomb to try to
[1:20:47] keep him in
[1:20:48] string but nothing could make him
[1:20:50] historical he rose from the grave he
[1:20:56] buried he carried my sins far away
[1:20:59] rising he justified freely forever he
[1:21:05] rolled away the stone they could not
[1:21:09] keep him down don't you appreciate the
[1:21:12] Lord they're doing the same thing today
[1:21:15] but they'll never be able to stop the
[1:21:17] resurrection because he yanked the
[1:21:19] stinger out of death those apostles
[1:21:23] looked upon him they said that which we
[1:21:25] have heard from the beginning that which
[1:21:28] we have heard and seen with her eyes
[1:21:30] that which we have looked upon and our
[1:21:32] hands have handled the word of life
[1:21:37] because they realized that the word was
[1:21:40] not a dead ten commandments but a living
[1:21:43] Oracle they actually was living on the
[1:21:46] inside of them Peter said why look upon
[1:21:49] us as our own power who rose this man
[1:21:52] the way he did those disciples believed
[1:21:56] the Living Word of God they begin to
[1:21:59] proclaim the gospel and it calls to
[1:22:01] religious disturbance and every one of
[1:22:04] those disciples gave their life and
[1:22:06] martyr him every one of them they could
[1:22:09] not stop the purpose of God
[1:22:11] I read the foxes Book of Martyrs they
[1:22:14] drug him through the streets they hung
[1:22:16] him they hung him upside down but they
[1:22:18] could not even slow down the momentum of
[1:22:21] the Christian Church they were so angry
[1:22:24] with Paul beaten and stoned and rejected
[1:22:27] and shipwrecked
[1:22:28] they throwed him that down in prison and
[1:22:30] he writes two thirds of the New
[1:22:32] Testament
[1:22:33] you would have thought that they would
[1:22:35] have slowed him down his eyes hurting
[1:22:36] the way it was and they did the greatest
[1:22:38] thing they could ever do slow him down
[1:22:40] so he could catch his breath and write a
[1:22:43] note to use telling us that the Lord is
[1:22:45] coming and he's coming to them that
[1:22:47] believe in
[1:22:48] and is coming to them that love is
[1:22:49] appearing thank you Lord for allowing
[1:22:53] that man to go in prison so you could
[1:22:58] tell me about it
[1:22:59] same thing they did the John you know
[1:23:02] John I I'm amazed at Peter I like the
[1:23:05] way he's quick at the trigger you know
[1:23:07] he asked the Lord a question the Lord
[1:23:08] said that they're gonna hang you it
[1:23:10] tells him what death he should die he
[1:23:11] looks back at John said but what will
[1:23:13] this man do he said what's that to you
[1:23:15] if he tarry till i come follow thou me
[1:23:17] and there went out of saying that John
[1:23:19] would not die but Jesus never said that
[1:23:21] John would not die said what is the U of
[1:23:23] he tarry till i come PO about me but the
[1:23:25] madam said we got to be real careful
[1:23:26] that we don't say what we think we need
[1:23:28] to say what it said and leave it alone
[1:23:31] but you see that John they thought he
[1:23:33] was a witch and they boiled them in oil
[1:23:35] in the whole night and I imagine it felt
[1:23:38] like a hot tub Oh John been working hard
[1:23:41] and God just lets him rested the angels
[1:23:43] of God Fanning him and they said this
[1:23:48] man has lost his mind
[1:23:50] banished him to the Isle of Patmos he's
[1:23:53] sitting out there rocks and lizards and
[1:23:55] there he writes the book of Revelation
[1:23:59] and it's sent to an endtime Church the
[1:24:03] only age it'll ever know what it's
[1:24:05] talking about he writes a letter to you
[1:24:08] brother and new he writes a letter to
[1:24:10] you he writes it to us and to prepare
[1:24:14] our hearts it's God preserving his seed
[1:24:16] he preserved John to write a letter to
[1:24:20] us so we could preserve be preserved in
[1:24:23] the end time you love the Lord God is
[1:24:28] good by going too long just a little
[1:24:31] more brother madam said if you want to
[1:24:34] make a rapture get the word in your
[1:24:36] heart he said eat the book because the
[1:24:41] word of life always brings Satan coming
[1:24:43] in like a flood all down to the age it's
[1:24:46] always been that way that the Word of
[1:24:49] God brings the enemy coming in when God
[1:24:51] is manifesting his word so when men
[1:24:56] received the word and the effects of the
[1:24:57] word they could never be the same and
[1:24:59] the church went down
[1:25:01] - the aegis and the martyrs if you ever
[1:25:04] read foxes Book of Martyrs I have a copy
[1:25:09] that was ordered from England about this
[1:25:11] thick and I got about through four
[1:25:14] hundred and fifty pages I said it's
[1:25:15] enough I can't go no more but you know
[1:25:18] you would think they'd run out of ideas
[1:25:20] of how to torture people and how to
[1:25:22] create suffering upon people but it is
[1:25:25] just beyond human comprehension that
[1:25:28] human beings could stoop so low or go to
[1:25:30] such extent to do such evil things they
[1:25:34] tried to beat it out of him starve it
[1:25:36] out of him freeze it out of a burn it
[1:25:37] out of them they tried everything but
[1:25:39] they could never stop the gospel no
[1:25:43] matter what they did they could never
[1:25:44] take it away from them God had preserved
[1:25:47] him the Bible says in Revelations
[1:25:51] chapter 2 verse 10 the devil shall throw
[1:25:54] some of you into prison did you ever
[1:25:56] catch that the devil shall throw some of
[1:25:59] you into prison it wasn't the devil as
[1:26:02] we would know as the spirit of the devil
[1:26:04] it was the Catholic Church throwing them
[1:26:06] into prison but it was the devil behind
[1:26:08] that church that was doing it and I
[1:26:11] noticed this that governors they fed the
[1:26:13] Saints to Lions there in Rome and they
[1:26:17] put all kinds of evil things upon them
[1:26:19] it was the spirit of Jezebel living in
[1:26:22] the church those martyrs gave their
[1:26:27] lives
[1:26:28] warriors priests would hold out a
[1:26:31] crucifix and they'd pull their limbs
[1:26:34] apart by beasts and they say all you got
[1:26:37] to do is kiss the crucifix and we'll
[1:26:39] turn you loose you can bypass all this
[1:26:42] suffering if you just say I'm sorry
[1:26:45] eirick hand but those men wouldn't even
[1:26:49] better I they died like heroes because
[1:26:52] the Word of Life was beating in their
[1:26:54] hearts even women they dip their hair in
[1:26:58] the tar and light it on fire and women
[1:27:01] gave their lives I read one account of a
[1:27:03] man they started stretching in between
[1:27:05] mules and he recanted and a 17 year
[1:27:09] girl said miserable wretched give up
[1:27:12] eternal life for a few moments of
[1:27:14] pleasure and she went and took his
[1:27:17] murderer
[1:27:18] these people were anointed to stand on
[1:27:22] the Word of God it was God preserving
[1:27:25] his seat in the face of the worst
[1:27:28] adversity but those martyrs knew whom
[1:27:31] they had believed down through 1000
[1:27:36] years every every invention imaginable
[1:27:41] now I want you to think of this brother
[1:27:44] branham said in the church age book we
[1:27:46] often think how could we do it and Bram
[1:27:50] said that same faith that was in the
[1:27:51] polycarp's is in us today but this is
[1:27:53] this is the the part that is amazing to
[1:27:56] me they had already stripped away the
[1:27:59] truth of Godhead a baptism of heaven
[1:28:02] purgatory is paying for sins they did
[1:28:05] not even have a God that resembled the
[1:28:07] nature of our God by the time the church
[1:28:11] had done corrupted the Bible but they
[1:28:14] were dying for the tiny sliver of truth
[1:28:17] that they had I want you to think of the
[1:28:21] abundance of Revelation that God has
[1:28:23] given us
[1:28:23] I mean God has literally pulled the barn
[1:28:26] doors off of his coffers and let us look
[1:28:29] into the wealth of eternity this message
[1:28:34] is literally God opening up his treasure
[1:28:36] chest and showing you the very
[1:28:38] unsearchable riches of Christ how many
[1:28:44] say Lord helped me to have cherish this
[1:28:47] message and it was amazing because the
[1:28:51] hell over as time progressed the Bible
[1:28:54] says it actually became Satan's seat and
[1:28:57] he said these Warriors were like David's
[1:29:01] mighty men going right into Satan's
[1:29:04] and overcoming the devil right in his
[1:29:07] throne room faith of our fathers living
[1:29:13] still then pretty soon the Bible said
[1:29:17] she Stoops down into the very depths of
[1:29:20] Satan where they had taken away
[1:29:23] everything stripped him of everything
[1:29:25] that people had nothing and Christianity
[1:29:28] was almost completely exterminated bear
[1:29:32] with me just for a little bit and
[1:29:34] brother and him said that True Vine
[1:29:35] struggled to survive but God was with
[1:29:39] that little faithful flock in spite of
[1:29:41] what Rome might do to their bodies Rome
[1:29:44] could not kill the spirit that was
[1:29:46] within them and the light of the truth
[1:29:49] shown on backed by Holy Ghost and power
[1:29:55] those that believed the word were killed
[1:29:57] and the great was staggering drunk
[1:30:01] tottering drunk with the blood of the
[1:30:04] martyrs burned churches destroyed
[1:30:07] churches the word was kept from the
[1:30:09] believers and in the darkest hour a
[1:30:13] thousand years of it remember King Tut's
[1:30:17] tomb that life was still there after
[1:30:21] 4,000 years remember Joseph this ancient
[1:30:24] seed God preserved the life and if they
[1:30:27] buried it and it come to life
[1:30:29] you never would have thought that the
[1:30:32] church could ever live again after a
[1:30:34] thousand years of church and state
[1:30:36] United them eradicating Bibles preaching
[1:30:39] and Latin killing anything that would
[1:30:41] even peak the Word of God but there was
[1:30:44] a life that was in the seed when God
[1:30:47] planted that church there was a life
[1:30:50] going down to those dark ages and at
[1:30:54] after a thousand years when you would
[1:30:56] say she can
[1:30:57] come back when the devil thought that he
[1:31:00] had the trick squashed all the sudden
[1:31:03] there came forth a revelation by Luther
[1:31:06] the just God the life that was in his
[1:31:16] words and he began to proclaim the just
[1:31:21] shall live by faith
[1:31:23] and the justification was born and all
[1:31:27] the sudden the church rose out of a
[1:31:30] thousand years of dark ages he nailed
[1:31:34] the 97 theses on the door of Wittenberg
[1:31:36] said here I stand god help me the word
[1:31:43] has life almost overnight God rose up
[1:31:47] warriors around Luther to fight for the
[1:31:50] message and to pull them out of those
[1:31:52] dark ages aren't you glad that God was
[1:31:56] preserving his seed that was Jezebel the
[1:31:59] Catholic Church but alpha Lila was the
[1:32:01] daughter which represented the
[1:32:03] Protestant denominations that would be
[1:32:05] born after her and atha Lila rose up
[1:32:08] after Luther to squash the Lutheran
[1:32:10] revival then there rose up ten dailies
[1:32:15] one of my favorite he could speak seven
[1:32:17] different languages very fluently and he
[1:32:20] translated the Bible into English he
[1:32:22] smuggled the Bibles into England until
[1:32:25] eventually he was arrested there was one
[1:32:28] time that his burden was to get the
[1:32:31] Bible into the hands of the common
[1:32:32] people at one time he was in an argument
[1:32:37] against this blossom Esclarmonde who
[1:32:40] told Tyndale we had better been with
[1:32:43] without god's law than the pope's law
[1:32:46] and Tyndale responded and said hard to
[1:32:49] fire the Pope and all his laws and if
[1:32:53] God spares my life there's many years
[1:32:55] I'll cause the boy that drives the plow
[1:32:58] to know more scriptures than you do and
[1:33:01] he did so Tyndale was arrested and 19
[1:33:07] I'm sorry 1536 convicted of heresy
[1:33:10] executed by strangulation and his body
[1:33:14] was to be burned at the stake and as he
[1:33:16] was dying he cries out God opened the
[1:33:23] king of England's eyes within two years
[1:33:26] his prayer was answered and they brought
[1:33:30] forth the Cloverdale addition it was
[1:33:32] mostly I'm sorry the great Bible where
[1:33:34] Tyndale's work who was mostly used I
[1:33:38] think 90% of Tyndale's work was used but
[1:33:42] he gave his life for it God was
[1:33:45] preserving this Bible to get into
[1:33:48] English you know we know by God's grace
[1:33:53] we know who the messenger the
[1:33:55] Philadelphian age is as william i'm
[1:33:58] sorry that was some Charles and John
[1:34:03] Wesley and there they had a parsonage
[1:34:07] and that parsonage was burning and John
[1:34:11] was trapped in the upper storey of it
[1:34:13] and the roof was about ready to collapse
[1:34:16] and his mother saw John he was under six
[1:34:19] years old up in the upper storey and the
[1:34:22] place is going to burn and so two men
[1:34:25] get on each other's shoulders and they
[1:34:27] grab John and yank him from the building
[1:34:28] just as the building collapses from that
[1:34:32] time he called himself a brand plucked
[1:34:34] from the fire see God had all of his
[1:34:37] purpose wrapped up in John don't you
[1:34:40] think because that car didn't hit you
[1:34:43] that that that was a coincidence
[1:34:45] God is preserving you for this hour
[1:34:48] don't you think because God healed you
[1:34:51] of that sickness it was a coincidence
[1:34:52] God has preserved you for this moment
[1:34:56] just seconds away from death and it was
[1:35:00] John and Charles that that turned the
[1:35:02] world upside down amen
[1:35:05] I'm bringing this down to a close
[1:35:07] watching the time a few more minutes
[1:35:11] thank you we're living in the most
[1:35:13] deceptive age of all the ages and 1909
[1:35:19] in the hills of Kentucky a cabin out
[1:35:23] there insignificant mountain people it's
[1:35:28] a little woman named Ella Branham she
[1:35:31] has a little infant she's three or six
[1:35:34] months pregnant with her next child
[1:35:38] Charles needs money so he goes to a
[1:35:41] lumber camp and he's out when a terrible
[1:35:45] blizzard comes in and they're left alone
[1:35:48] Ella an infant baby koala three or six
[1:35:51] months pregnant with the next child and
[1:35:54] it was a terrible blizzard Charles's
[1:35:56] nowhere around
[1:35:58] and so as food begins to dwindle fuel
[1:36:03] for the fire begins to dwindle she uses
[1:36:06] everything she can to burn they're
[1:36:08] running out of food she grabs her baby
[1:36:11] and wraps up in bed and it's just trying
[1:36:15] to preserve the child's life after the
[1:36:18] winter storm blows over there's a
[1:36:21] neighbor man up on the hill and he's
[1:36:24] working and he looks out and he notices
[1:36:26] there's no smoke coming up off of the
[1:36:29] chimney he says that's strange I saw
[1:36:32] smoke before the blizzard and as he
[1:36:36] begins to meditate on it he said now
[1:36:38] they couldn't have got out during the
[1:36:39] blizzard someone might be in trouble and
[1:36:44] so when he got down to the cabin he
[1:36:46] realizes there's no prints someone is in
[1:36:50] trouble he knocks on the door no answer
[1:36:52] and he forces himself in and there was a
[1:36:55] little mother and a baby starving to
[1:36:58] death weakened and freezing to death and
[1:37:01] the man goes and he gets groceries
[1:37:04] brings it in he gets a doctor he gets
[1:37:06] fuel for the fire and it saves their
[1:37:08] life that baby could have very easily
[1:37:11] died right there
[1:37:14] but God preserved his life because there
[1:37:18] was to be a message that would restore
[1:37:20] the endtime Church
[1:37:22] and if you watch as brother branham is
[1:37:26] growing out they tried a little girl you
[1:37:29] know says smoke this cigarette bill he
[1:37:31] said I don't want to she said are you a
[1:37:32] that challenged him he said I
[1:37:34] grabbed that cigarette and I went to
[1:37:37] smoke it he said I wanted to smoke it he
[1:37:40] said but then he heard and he said I
[1:37:43] threw it down and took off running he
[1:37:45] said it wasn't any good of me he said it
[1:37:47] was God preserving this gift for the end
[1:37:51] time he said I was out on a boat with my
[1:37:54] dad and they called me a and they
[1:37:56] were trying to get me to drink he said I
[1:37:58] wanted to drink it he said but it wasn't
[1:38:01] no good of me it was God preserving the
[1:38:04] gift in my life then the time he was
[1:38:07] carrying the little girl's books home
[1:38:09] from school those guys grabbed him and
[1:38:11] took a rock and beat him until he was
[1:38:13] unconscious he said let me go home just
[1:38:16] let me go I'll go home they beat him
[1:38:18] unconscious he got up and he run home
[1:38:20] and he grabbed his 22 he went out and
[1:38:23] waited for him and as they come around
[1:38:25] the corner he stepped out and said which
[1:38:27] up you want to die first so you don't
[1:38:28] have to see the other ones died he said
[1:38:30] one by one he was a crack shot one by
[1:38:34] one he tried to kill them boys and none
[1:38:37] of those went off he said I threw that
[1:38:40] gun down and wept and laughed at the
[1:38:42] same time put every bullet in and every
[1:38:45] one of them shot he would have been a
[1:38:47] murderer but it was God preserving his
[1:38:49] seat to bring a message to us restore
[1:38:55] her back restore that woman back to me
[1:39:00] God has preserved an endtime bride he
[1:39:05] has preserved her for a future home the
[1:39:09] Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit is a
[1:39:12] preserver of life how many believe that
[1:39:16] we believe in the power of the Holy
[1:39:18] Ghost he says in 1st Thessalonians
[1:39:21] chapter 5 verse 23 and the very God of
[1:39:25] peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God
[1:39:28] your whole spirit
[1:39:30] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[1:39:34] unto the coming of the Lord Jesus isn't
[1:39:39] it amazing what God has done he has
[1:39:41] preserved the truth of the Godhead he
[1:39:45] has preserved the truth of baptism in
[1:39:47] Jesus Christ's name
[1:39:48] he has preserved the truth of the
[1:39:51] original sin he has preserved the truth
[1:39:53] of holiness he has preserved the truth
[1:39:56] of the power of the blood and the power
[1:39:59] of the Holy Spirit he has preserved
[1:40:02] Paul's gospel Oh Joe Ash was hid for six
[1:40:12] years in the temple and on the seventh
[1:40:17] the doors were opened and the trumpet
[1:40:20] sounded and hear when they thought they
[1:40:24] were dead God opens a mystery to that
[1:40:27] age and out comes one where did he come
[1:40:30] from he come from the temple in the
[1:40:35] seventh year we've come down through the
[1:40:39] ages in this last stage when you would
[1:40:42] have thought denominationalism would
[1:40:44] have squashed the true gospel all of a
[1:40:48] sudden out of his pavilion out of his
[1:40:53] hiding place whom shall I fear the Lord
[1:40:57] is my life and my salvation
[1:40:59] now David was speaking of an endtime
[1:41:02] people as brother Branham preached the
[1:41:04] rapture out of Psalms 27 was he speaking
[1:41:07] of joash maybe maybe it's a compound
[1:41:10] prophecy I don't know but we do know in
[1:41:13] this seventh age not a king but a queen
[1:41:17] has been revealed God has preserved a
[1:41:21] church for the end time God has
[1:41:25] preserved you for the end time don't you
[1:41:28] take it for granted your knowledge of
[1:41:31] the Scriptures is not a coincidence
[1:41:33] God has preserved it in your heart God
[1:41:37] has preserved the Holy Ghost and the
[1:41:39] Holy Ghost has preserved us
[1:41:42] how many appreciate the Lord with all
[1:41:45] their hearts I want to say this in
[1:41:48] closing all of God's purpose was wrapped
[1:41:53] up in one man Noah all of God's purpose
[1:41:58] was wrapped up in Moses all of God's
[1:42:03] purpose was wrapped up in Joseph all of
[1:42:08] God's purpose was wrapped up down to the
[1:42:10] ages one now we've come down through the
[1:42:16] ages we've went from Genesis all the way
[1:42:18] to the end do you think God's going to
[1:42:21] abandon the work now brother branham I
[1:42:24] don't know maybe I have the quote let me
[1:42:27] see if I've got it here brother Brenner
[1:42:28] makes an astounding quote here it is
[1:42:32] here it is he says I'm bringing us to a
[1:42:36] close
[1:42:38] same as they do today the religious
[1:42:42] system in this big machine that they got
[1:42:44] set up now will absolutely turn down the
[1:42:47] promises at the end time with the
[1:42:48] endtime message the end times signed the
[1:42:51] end time he said that's supposed to be
[1:42:53] as God predicted word by word it's on
[1:42:57] tape
[1:42:57] if they shoot me down or whatever they
[1:43:01] might do they'll never stop that message
[1:43:04] it'll go on the same it's already out it
[1:43:08] staked it's gone a message approved of
[1:43:13] God among you by signs and wonders a
[1:43:17] message that Christ is not dead but he
[1:43:20] is living the same as he's ever lived
[1:43:25] he said it's too late it's released it's
[1:43:29] out brother branham died in a terrible
[1:43:32] car crash but the word has fallen upon
[1:43:36] pleasant places the word has fallen
[1:43:39] apart upon fertile hearts and while the
[1:43:43] devil has tried everything to throw off
[1:43:45] the effects of the Lord it's been
[1:43:48] growing in our hearts it's been growing
[1:43:52] in his people and God's purpose he's
[1:43:56] wrapped up look in the mirror
[1:44:01] God has invested his entire purpose
[1:44:06] right here
[1:44:08] worldwide those who have received the
[1:44:10] message hey man I'm closing how many say
[1:44:18] Lord let me be faithful where you lead
[1:44:22] me I will follow whatever you want me to
[1:44:27] do Lord I'll do it I know we
[1:44:31] underestimate ourselves because we look

[1:44:48] those weaknesses to every one of us we
[1:44:51] could actually look at one another and
[1:44:53] pull out weaknesses on one another God
[1:44:56] ain't looking at that he's looking at
[1:44:59] his covenant did you ever wonder how
[1:45:02] Samson got done everything that he did
[1:45:05] God wasn't looking at Samson God was
[1:45:10] looking at the Covenant and as long as
[1:45:12] that covenant was there the power was
[1:45:15] there it's God's grace upon every one of
[1:45:19] us let us stand our feet where he
