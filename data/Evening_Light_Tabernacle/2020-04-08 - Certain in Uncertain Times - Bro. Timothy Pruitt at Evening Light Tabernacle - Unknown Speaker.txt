surrender to you in Jesus name Amen [Music] let's turn our Bibles to first King 17 mandus in listenings that our study into different messages brother Branham spoke on be certain of God like to speak to you tonight on amen certain in uncertain times certain in uncertain times first King 17 verse 1 it says an Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be Dew or rain these years but according to my word and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get the hints and turned the eastward and hide thyself by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and as I have commanded and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according to the word of the Lord and he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith which is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while the brook dried up because there been no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get the in Zarephath which belongeth the Zion and dwell there behold I've commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he rose and went to their paths and when he came to the gate of the city behold a widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called her and said fetch me I pray thee a little but water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in the hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little old and a cruse and behold I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die and I just said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make it for thee and for thy son for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel a meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of all fail until the day that the Lord sent his reign upon the earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did he many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him and she said undal idea what how about to do with thee or thou a man of God or thou coming to me to call my sin into remembrance and to slay my son and he's sitting heard give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up to a loft where you bowed and laid him upon the his own bed and he cried to the Lord and said O Lord my god has thou brought the evil upon the widow who my sojourn by slaying her son and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the Lord and said O Lord my god I pray thee let this child soul come again come into him again and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived and Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and Elijah said see thy son liveth and the woman said to Elijah now by this I know that thou art a man of God and that the word of the Lord is in thy mouth is truth hallelujah amen we'll let you be seated this evening certain in uncertain times I got to looking at these words certain and uncertain certain means to be known for sure or to establish beyond doubt or to be beyond the reach of doubt uncertain means not to be able to you can't rely on it or not known or definite and you know when brother Brandon would speak actually on both words he would speak about the uncertain sound and he would speak on certain be certain of God and you know in an uncertain sound he said things of the earth was shaking you can't put no confidence in anything everything is uncertain and anything that's uncertain he said I would just I like to stay away from the negative side he said I like it positive to be on the positive side but it goes on he said home life has become uncertain national life is uncertain the world is uncertain and I would like to just say right here that even in the best of times under the best conditions a life is uncertain it doesn't take a pandemic for life to become uncertain it it may become more uncertain but even life in general is uncertain we're not guaranteed or promised tomorrow our life is but a vapor and it can be here today and gone in just a few minutes but where he said we're just living in a place where the whole world is having a nervous prostration like shaking everything every nation everybody one of us everyone is afraid of another one and he says everything is shaking national light political life everything is shook up he said even Church life is shook up uncertain people don't even know hardly what to do anymore and we know this very much goes with what we're living in today you know it's very real the things that you read here in the uncertain sound because talking about church life you know this one thinks they got this right and this one's got this right and that one's got this figured out and all that's going on but he said though you know everything is uncertain we know the Bible speaks about everything that can be shaken will be shaken and you know and the world is uncertain that we're living in governments are uncertain life is uncertain amen people are grasping at ideas or whatever to prop themselves up because of uncertainties no one knows what it's next even the best of known people that are experts in their field they don't know what's next they don't know what's around the next corner amen you know and as I said even in the best of times this life is uncertain but we don't know when the last times together here on this earth you know just a few Sundays ago we met for the last time in a normal circumstance and for now and and what we see is normals and we hope to maybe one day get there we don't know nobody knows that's uncertain so life is uncertain you say well you're painting the awful dark picture and brother Branham said you asked me that question he said I intend to do that he said I want to do it I did it for a purpose is you asked is there anything certain and he says yes there is something certain there's one thing that's certain one thing you can put your confidence one thing you can make sure is right when everything else is gone when everything else is faded away when everything else is falling away heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall not fail God has placed us or given us the ability to stand upon a certain foundation it's a foundation that's beyond the reach of doubt Amen I don't mean doubts will come that'll mean doubts won't enter your mind that will mean you will face fears or have fears but we wouldn't when you come down to it and you get down to the bottom of where you're standing on you want to be standing upon the Word of God amen and be certain in uncertain times there's only one thing we can place our trust in in this hour there's literally living in is God's Word our money isn't certain our homes in certain our lands are not certain nothing earthly or temporary is certain but some are making this into something that is not this thing that we're going through they're drawing lines in the sand they're propping themselves up with quotes and things to try to make it to work you know making sayings that where the bride will get this virus and that's not certain it's no more certain than some someone in the bride or somebody that's a part of the bride it won't die in a car wreck or I won't to have some other disease or have some of the thing what is certain is the Lord God is he is he he will heal all our diseases and there we can have faith there we can stand upon I can't stand upon what somebody has come up with or what somebody thinks or what somebody got it all figured out I can only stand upon the Word of God you said well we have faith we won't get this disease brother man was saying like this he said sometimes faith will do great miracles and it still don't come from a spiritual heart hello somebody sometimes faith will do great miracles but still it doesn't come from a necessarily a spiritual heart our Lord said this he said many will come to me in that day and said have I not done this or done that in your name and then he said I will say to them depart from me you workers of iniquity what is iniquity is something that you knew to do right and you didn't do it and he will say I never knew you in the first place he said we're living in that day today he said but what we need today is not a lot of material things thank God not a lot of material things we have that but we don't need greater churches we don't need greater congregations we don't need more radio more television we don't need more of these save what we need today to be spiritual is a person that will humble themselves before God if anybody if you hadn't even got a penny but we'll pray to that spirit within them is satisfied all hallelujah it's satisfied with the goodness of God now listen you can have this moment and don't depend on you having a lot of people around you you can have it regardless if you got yourself by yourself or your family or maybe a hundred or five hundred but the point is you want to get to a place that when that spirit on the inside of you it's satisfied with the goodness of God and a revival can take place listen a revival is not dependent upon a big congregation a revival is not dependent upon church full Amen he said one or two people on fire for God Amen you can have revival in your home you can have a revival in your car you can have a revival but until that takes place inside our hearts and that will change our attitude that will change our atmosphere that we live in hallelujah that's what we need today Amen some people's attitudes and atmospheres got all out of whack and things are going the wrong way for them right now and and people are running in fear and things are happening but what gets you back to the right attitude and the right atmosphere it's getting in the presence of God not in the news not in the things of this world but getting in the presence of God and how do you get in the presence of God start thinking on him start praying to him start asking for him to move start feeding upon his word and letting this presence around you amen see we might not have a pair of shoes on our feet we might be dressed in rags but something will be in your heart singing a melody listen I don't know how far this is going to go we might get to these places I don't have no idea but you might get to where you don't have any sitting on a pair of shoes now that your dress may be rags but if you get to this place you'll still have something in your heart singing the melodies of God hallelujah the goodness of God and he said I would rather have that that all the money in the world cuz money ain't certainly can be here today and gone tomorrow he can be worth of a hundred dollars one day and not worth a cent the next day hallelujah so you can't save natural things you know we're always a blessing of God you know David spoke to the Lord that the Lord seen the wicked spread forth you know like a great tree and then you know he said but did you God ask him he said did you ever consider that big tree at the end no matter how good a clothes they had or how much they had to eat but that isn't what gets you into the presence of God this body that we dwell in perishes regardless of how well is taken care of but it's the soul that matters it's a condition a condition of the spirit that moves us into the presence of the Living God you know anything we begin to talk about this woman that we read about this widow woman he said how that this little woman must have been of the calibre of Elijah but I thought that the people of God wouldn't suffer you know he's he talks about in many places he talks about the famine that had come in the land was because of the sin that was there but not everybody in the land was sinful come on now not everybody had bowed their knee to bail and we found that out a little later when God lied to us said I'm the only one that's serving you and then God told her what was his five seven thousand seven thousand heading bowed their knee amen so just because that was sin the land that didn't mean everyone was sinful and just because it was famine the land it didn't mean that those that were not sinful didn't suffer they suffered they went through things and she went she was tied down to her last meal her last time but just to give it just to eat and I'm gonna die I'm gonna give up my life because you know and said but see this woman must have been of the same caliber of Elijah but yes she was suffering yes she was going through things just as everybody else was going through things she had to go to the marketplace and go through whatever everybody else was going through or however it was set up in that day she had that she was gone she was starving she was in famine no water this she was going through it just like everybody else was going through it but yet she was of the caliber of Elijah hallelujah amen and see she had bent but she had been chosen to entertain God's prophet hallelujah it wasn't her that chosen it was God who chose her hallelujah unbelievers there's a people on earth that's of the calibre of Elijah that knows the God of Elijah it's not just a God of books and tapes and quotes and scriptures but it's a God that stepped out of it and became a living amen a living God among them producing the same signs and wonders hallelujah and she had been chosen to entertain him oh god I want to be chosen to entertain you hallelujah I'm talking about I want to be chosen to entertain the Spirit of God hallelujah the land was burning up and no doubt that sort of woman being of that caliber but a believer type Oh how many's a believer type hey man I love that is and brother Tim brought this out about her brother John Laird spoke about doing some work for my sister and all the things that you needed done or whatever and he said well that's what we do you know I mean and as believers we believe that's what we do don't matter what if it's good times or bad times were still believers right no matter for up or down or over sick or wealthier way wealthier we poor if we're believers that's what we do we believe and she was of the believer type he says for we see that God would not have called her if she hadn't been worthy to entertain God's prophet for he would have never sent his prophet to a house that was unworthy so it was not it was not the prophets choosing it was God's choosing it wasn't her bidding him he was God bidding him and he had been placed by a Brooke and Ravens were feeding them but in God's get God's commandment for something to take place and God surely went to a believer the same nature of Elijah but yet she was suffering she was going through the same things that was going on in the land she wasn't exempt from it Amen then she was going through things she was she was facing hardship she was and she was too but she was of the same caliber Amen others so she was of the believer type even though she was struggling she was a widow woman so she had a lot of problems things that happened in her life nobody to take care of her young husband her husband dead and the young boy to raise in the land they depended on crops you know and they did a boys a name you know no doubt wasn't able to go to a grocery store like we've been accustomed to go and do and and you know but had to put in the crops in the field to have anything to eat but everything now was decaying and it was because of the iniquity of the people and their moral decay had brought a drought on the land and they was all starving and dying believers and non-believers all starving and dying and then we find that no doubt she prayed night after night all night and she began to see that miracle barrel going down down down down and it must got to a place it was not even another cup full of meal in the barrel all she had was a little handful just a few drops and death was coming right to her door but there was no way of getting anymore the whole nation was starving and the oil was running out just a spoonful little just enough to make another bridge piece of bread and eat it and die well you told my sincerity in prayers he said you let's that strike your home you'll be a little more sincere in you were this morning when you know death lays at the door he's I believe we think perhaps like this we prayed all night long for one more day settle it it was going to be over she looked at the pale lips of her little boy three or four years old see his own bowels doing of the way as the flesh was coming to them it must have been a terrible thing as his mother seeing this going on day after day after day going down down down down he said may God let this soak and every one of you you if you never hear me preach again let this be a message it's strange most strange that sometimes let's things get that way hello somebody God lets things get that way you know when we've confessed our sins and we met every requirement that God requires and we believe on god there's a circumstance has to be met and according to the will where we met them all and yet he lays silent he won't answer us I'm sure I'm speaking to people this morning who's come to that place I've been there myself many times hello somebody I've been there myself many times this is his words and I have been there myself many times he said I've went back and I've traced my life many times I've turned over every stone and I'd find where I'd maybe done something wrong I'd go make it right Lord God I'll make it right and go do so come back again say now Lord now our God you'll have some assure that I've met the requester required to me to do and every requirement I've met and still seemingly he won't move he seems to sit silent that's when you've got to be sure he's God if he answers or not he's God if he does something about it or not he's God if he heals me or not he's God you know I got the privilege of meeting brother Giovanni Coenen there right there in New York been praying for them he goes to brother Yvan carry-ons Church and and it met him at a meeting up there in Canada a couple of last year's sometime and he was given a testimony of his wife and her longing for a child I don't remember exactly the details may not get it all exactly right but the gist of it is this she was born without something very needful in the reproduction in the organs and the female and she was born without it and and and it just the doctors told her it's impossible you can't have a baby but it just was on her I want a baby I want a baby she would not give up just day and night calling wanting the baby so he was just trying to occur finally you know not me but I think that went many times and talked with the pastor and finally this last result again he takes her to the pastor there it says look you know this is she's just so down and you know just constantly I want a baby I want a baby and the pastor asked her of these words he said what if sister he don't give you a baby then what said her head was bowed she lifted up their eyes tears streaming down and she said I'll still love him in just a few months later a little time later she had a and she got pregnant now they have a little daughter hallelujah no matter what you're going through you need to be certain he's God that's something you've got to stand on no matter how hard it may get no matter how terrible it may be no semen no matter how bad it may get it doesn't matter he's still God and he can get to your last meal he can get to your last crumbs and he moved on the scene just like he did for this woman he can get to your last breath and he'd come and move on the scene and everything be made totally whole he's that kind of God be certain in these moments you have to be certain he's God and if he's God he's got it all in control he's not lost it it's not waver waver always shaken is not because he's lost control come on somebody he's stealing control he's still orchestrating this all about to come to an end to a projected to his that to what he knows by is foreknowledge he's getting it to move right to that place hallelujah you must be certain before you do anything you must be certain in your heart that is God and when you met everything he said when you sure he's God then your faith goes right there and your faith stands and stands steady for it knows he is hallelujah it know he is and it will hold steady it won't move faith won't move for its sure that God is and it's sure that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him and he said may this go way down deep and never moved from you Brenham Tabernacle in evening light time for that coin timothy pruiting Joe Adams and whoever's listening may it go deep down into you if you met God's requirement and in your heart you believe that he is God's only testing your faith he loves to do that you confess your sins you met a requirement and yet he still lay silent remember faith says he is and faith holds own not knowing what is going to happen or how it's going to happen it just knows it will happen and he knows that he is and he's certain that he is and remember if he is then his word is true and if he required you to meet those circumstance and you did then he's obligated to take care of his word oh my god maybe I read that one more time let it sink in real deep it says if you he required you to meet these circumstances and you did he's obligated to take care of his word he's obligated to that word he has to bring it to pass because it's his word and it cannot fail hallelujah he says everybody knows moments don't back off and say well I never got healed he said you poor weak faith don't believe that if everything anything if everything's confessed everything's meant faith holds don't let nothing nothing but there's nothing will move it he is you're sure they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings of an eagle they shall run and not be weary and if they walk they shall not faint wait when you met his requirements wait and it will bring your faith to a showdown Godric Herman has been met and you have fully considered it and you've done everything he said to do then your faith rests right there that he is be certain of God be certain of God he loves to test us he loves to see the reaction of faith hallelujah God loves to see how you will react hello God loves to see how you will react when you hear bad news do you react in fear is that your first reaction is that your first go to or if you hear something it's something going on up this pandemic what's what's guiding you is it fear come on now how are you reacting I'm not saying you got to go out and test God and prove God you know we've read it here with the first Wednesday night of Martin Luther how he operated I believe that's a good guideline amen you know do what do what's required to do what you supposed to do he meant wash your hands do all of that be smart fine but don't fear believe God if you do happen to get it he can heal you he will it's his word God likes to see how you were react when you say O Lord I believe you thou art my Savior I believe that you're my healer I believe that you're the one who gives the Holy Spirit the things that I'm requiring you're the God who gives that and when you confess all your sins and promise God that you do if you he'll let you get where well and then don't and then because it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere God can use that there's no way for him to use it there's no way for him to hit you because the only answers faith then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer you but true faith stands there being sure that God is and being certain that he is and if God asks just thing to be done to confess your sins and so forth and you've done it says he is and it's a certain is going to happen and your request has been granted hallelujah your request has been granted God is sure of his word and he knows his word will produce the healing that's required hallelujah I'm sure of his word I know that there's a serum here hallelujah but listen those where it says it's been said the virus that were really worried about ain't the co V of 19 the virus we worried about coldness and formulas and ungodly listen and sins of this world that's the virus we worried about but there is an inoculation there is a bla that I've taken all away from you and make a life out of you that you never thought possible to live you couldn't live on your own be sure he's God you know in so many cases of people that went through hard times you know yet Daniel and the Hebrew children that were taken off but they had purpose in their heart they was gonna serve God there wasn't ungodly people they were godly boys they purpose we're not going to eat the Kings meat we're not going to do this we're gonna pray even when the decree says not to we're gonna pray we're gonna give we're going to serve God we're gonna do what's right you know but yet even though good people and children of God they suffered they went through things they think they went through this like everybody else was going through and here they had to go for four or five Furness facing the certain death seemingly it was impossible seem like they'd to survive it a hundred percent death rate to be thrown into this fiery furnace seemed impossible but they said king we're not going to bow do what you wanted to do we're not gonna bow our God is able to deliver us but if he doesn't we're still not going to bow see they were sure and certain he's God the fire didn't change who he was the floods don't change who he is sickness don't change who he is problems don't change who he is financial struggles does not change who he is hallelujah storms don't change you you they knew he was Jehovah they knew he answered prayer whether he did in their case or not he would have to be for the good for they had made their statement they confess their sins and they were willing to walk into death and when they were going to the fiery furnace knowing that they were certain that if God let them burn up he would raise them up again they were certain of God because they knew that God would work everything for their good yah I mean we need to not forget that scripture even Romans 8:28 to them that are the called according to his purpose all things work together he man he's working it all out for our good hallelujah I don't know that I just got a text from our God in Israel reminding us that today actually starts the celebration for Israel there started their holiday celebrating amen they're leaving Egypt their Exodus are leaving Egypt so Alleluia their Passover are coming now and then and then then being under the blood and watching the things that took a place Amen listen we're right here at the same times the same places hallelujah and I'm thankful I'm under the blood people get the idea as do the Jews the Jews thought that he was coming to save them from the Romans you know and he was going to raise up an army and he was going to defeat them by like he'd like he did though he's gonna drive out the Romans and set them free but that wasn't the freedom he was coming for he was coming to set them free from sin hallelujah in the first Exodus he set them free from the Egyptians and he took him to a landing the second one he set us free from sin that's what that blood is for amen that blood is an inoculation from sin but just because we're under the blood or the token does not mean we won't get sick come on people had get cancer I mean we have bad accidents our prophet died in a car accident and people made statements because he died he's anti word and you're anti word if you nonsense ridiculous nonsense this blood is an inoculation against sin but it also in that has a healing power but it does not make you a meme unit to in the sense of you'll never get sick you will get sick these bodies or not they men eternal bodies their temporary bodies their bodies is growing old just because you're under the token or on the blood don't mean you're not getting old then go our bodies are going down down down down down but this blood does produce an inoculation an immunity against sin but in it it also gives us the ability to draw strength from it to receive health again hallelujah and this is what he was talking about he said they go through the through the fire furnace you go through things in your life and you don't know if he's going to deliver you or not but that doesn't matter what matters he's God their statements was not depending on whether he was going to deliver them or not but there was depending on he's God here O king you're not God you don't have a final say in this matter I may go to a fire furnace but that's not the end of my life I got another life coming ha - look you're not God and I like to tell the devil you're not God you don't have a final say - when we draw our last breath God has that it's in his hands and I am in his hands and you are in his hands and be certain he is God because if he they died he they would raise up on the resurrection so they made this statement they were certain they walked right to the fiery furnace no matter to the decrees we're not going to bow they bound their hands are bound their feet they started them to the fiery furnace God standing there looking at it they were certain he was God they'd made their confession they had made everything right that they knew what they were certain and as they walked to the fire furnace right as the lapse moment came there he come riding out of heaven on the chariot of wind and began Fanning the breezes off of him while he talked with him and fellowship with them in the fire God let your faith comes to a spot where it will react there was job in the Old Testament another believer who had hard times lost a lot of things had a bad days real bad days Satan his accuser accused him of being a a secret sinner but joka knew he had sinned he knew he had offered his sacrifice he was certain he had met God's requirements Satan took his camels he took a sheep he took his children but still joke stood free certain he's God he had met the requirements he'd searched he found out I made the burnt offerings I made the sacrifice I made the feast I've done what God required I've made the burnt offerings for my children and confess their own Oh God he says when a man keeps what God said dude he's certain he's God he has to answer faith calls him on the scene every time and when you've done what you know is right when you met his requirements when you confessed and made right and done restitutions and lady before God I don't care how silent he is he's still God and he's waiting to put that faith there you've done your works now he wants to see your faith by your works he wants to see what you would do he wants to see how you were react he wants to see what you will say hallelujah this is where job god one day God took him back beyond all of his problems even beyond his good times on earth because at one time no doubt Jobe had a wonderful life seemingly a very rich man had many like how many camels many oxen marks and many this that and the other many houses many children in a few days it's all gone but there were good days before the bad days but God took him back before even the good days even that's where our company has to lie in these hours and these bad times that we're in it's got to lie and even more than our good times are our future good times it's got to go back before all of that who were you before the foundation of the world where were you joke before the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang and shouted for joy you were in the mind of God job I had you in my mind even before you had a bad day or a good day or a great day or just a so-so day I already had you in my mind Oh hallelujah if we could just get that tonight he already thought about it before there was ever a coronavirus cancer surgeon died being his problem situation financial struggle he already had us in his mind and what he had of us in his mind he cannot change his mind and he holds on to it and he said I'm going to have a bride without spot without wrinkle there will be an overcomer of laodicean church age hallelujah who were where were you maybe I need to ask you this just real simply where were you before the coronavirus came where was your faith that is it really shook you that much what's going on in your life listen if you had to wait for so if you have to wait for some pandemic to come to get right with God you ain't right with God hey man you know where I was in the post office the other day and hearing a man speak about his church and how what he's trying to do is speaking to another lady in line he said I'm just trying to encourage trying to help you know he said you know it's amazing he sought fully expect we get to go back I'm gonna have a church for he said because 9/11 came he's in my I couldn't you want to find the seat for everybody he said all of a sudden within about a half a year or so he said it was about half of them gone another year that was about half of those gone so I had just a handful again he said you know you get somebody baptized and they were hanging around for a little bit and then they're gone he said all right you know I hope people realize the real need for God and get to God and find him in and and really put their trust in him and he was pouring his heart out this needs to be a confession on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand the best day of your life is sinking sand your body's decaying his getting older things are happening the best days only Christ is a solid rock only he's a place that can hold you even job his wife walked out on him his health walked out he bowls all over him scraping himself she said you might as well just cursed God enjoy job you're so miserable miserable I'll just curse God and die he said out speakers like a foolish woman though God's lame me yeah and I'll trusty he was certain there was God and he hadn't met the requirements oh I feel religious he said he knew he had met him all that settled it God was just testing his faith and he will test yours and he will test mine and just because we're the bride don't mean we're a meaning from tests and when we meet his requirements repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost as promised any of them you sick call the elders of the church let them anoint more and pray a prayer of faith shall save the singing God shall raise them up that settles it confessed make things right pray for one another you met it these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out dead bulls hey man hallelujah Devils up no matter what gets named tomorrow Devils no matter what new disease comes up Davos no matter what new problem comes up Davos cast them out by the Word of God and they'll speak with new tongues and if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it shall not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that settles it be certain of God hallelujah Satan loves to throw things at you well you have prayed for you know better they pretty and preachers pray for you know better now and preachers ain't right in the first place it doesn't matter about the preacher it's your faith in the Living God that counts it's not what the preacher is is what God is the preacher never made the promise God made the promise it's not up to the preacher it's up to God and your faith to believe that God is so be certain of God be certain that it's God that God's Word and God's in his word and he will keep his word going back to this little widow woman she knew that he was God and the bed with the barrel kept going down down down circumstances got worse worse worse God was letting it get that way he just loves to do that I don't list of hurts he loves to put your faith to a test to see how you act let you be anointed and pray for it then let you get worse and say come son Satan put him to a test I know he believes me did you hear that he says let you be ignored it and pray for you and then let make you worse say come on Satan put to the test I know he believes me blessed God forever put him to a test now I know he took my word for it could he say that about you he said that about Jo do anything to him you want but don't take his life for I know he loves me he made that offer he made the requirements he did what I told him to do he believes it now roll him over the coals if you want to he took everything away from him but God doubled it when he give it all back to him oh my we may lose everything on this whole world but we lose our this whole world what are we gonna gain when we get on the other side I think that's gonna be more than double I don't know if you can put a number to it I think if you put it in a calculator to put the weird letters dot whatever X T something other it's it's insurmountable joy and happiness and love and health and peace beyond measure when we get on the other side but that'll mean we're not gonna be tested here he puts our faith to this test to see if we really believe he's God you know Jesus spoke about it it wasn't there many widows in the days of Elijah but he only sent to one and he said I prayed maybe she's seeing that little cake dance that entered the gate and was walking up to her door one more bite apiece and her and her son was going to die I can see her all night praying hot winds blowing earth parts people crying screaming in the streets she was walking through the house talking to her Lord she looked at her little boy looked at the little pajamas they were all wore out or little little feet sticking out looked at her own hands wrinkled up walking back and forth but she said I know he's God I made that I met the requirements I'm asking for our lives for his glory God seen her and the rest of them are going out having a good time petting himself up you know having this and that carrying on but that woman was alone with God daylight broke and she said the little fella and cried all night for something he what would I do one little glass hand feeling full of meal you know that meal was Christ that meal will horan had to be ground with a special bird till it was cut and says little pieces of court every one of them was the same because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and ever believer believes that and rests upon it come on somebody if God was God yesterday he's got today and he'll be gone tomorrow every believer rest upon that you can have your cold former religion anything you want but for me I believe Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and my make my stand upon that then burst cut every way showing he's the same God he's the same God tonight he's the same garden in the morning he's the same God tomorrow he's the same God next week he's the same God next month when they're gonna lift it up there's this problem this pandemic was he gonna he's the same God he's the same God when we gonna get back to normal he's the same God he's the same God what about my health he's the same God what about my situation he's the same God and they all represent the Holy Ghost the Spirit of God spirit and truth making a cake to give you nourishment if you want nourishment take the spirit and truth and feed on it hallelujah ready and then of course the two sticks representing the cross sacrifice late opponent mind so much here I'm going down to these to this moment where he came ask for it ask for that meal he said bring me that morsel of bread and listen to this she turns in her gloom in her gloom and I can hear her say something like this sir you're different from any other man I've seen the man I can hear speak you seem to be so positive what you're saying but I only got enough meal just a spoonful of all I've dressed it I'm gonna cook it with these two sticks me and my son are gonna eat it and we're gonna die that's all I got but what do we hear next but fetch me the little cake first see God first maybe in these times you forgot God before things are so busy life going on God's won't remind you he's first no matter what anybody else says what any evidence how gloomy it looks whatever it may be take God first doctor says I can't get well take God first I'm a sinner take God first I'm a prostitute I'm a drunkard take God's word first though your sins be as scarlet there'll be me white as snow though they are red like crimson he'll be made white like wool bring me a little cake first all that you got bring it to me are you willing to give everything you got and put it in his hands we like to be in control we like to be able to dictate where our money goes and where this goes and where that go can you put it in his hands are you willing and give it to him bring me a morsel of bread fetch me a little water there was something in her there was something that this is there's something in her that's moved and told her that man knows what he's talking about that man has met God that man has been in the presence of God that man is not just speaking empty words but that man is vindicated hallelujah amen what happened she turned in her gloom and she began to walk and it came to the place where she was obeying what he said she was listening to what he said she tuned out everything else anybody else said what her own thought says what everything else around her and she was only listening to what he said the gloom broke the gloom broke that saith the Lord the barrel will not go empty and the cruse run dry until the day that the Lord God sends rain upon the earth she made a cake and she gave it to the Prophet she went back and she got some more and the next day she went back and she got some more and the next day she went back and she got more every morning every day why because she took God at His Word listen the gloomy times that's looking right now may not look good gloomy if you'll just take his word and be certain he's God but the reason it looks so gloomy is you're looking at it the wrong way in Germany where the bottom talks about a picture I haven't ever seen the picture love to see it talk about the cloud land so when you see it off in a distance it's the horriblest looking gloom you ever seen clouds matted together looking them from a long distance but when you get up close to it it changes its angel's wings beating singing Hallelujah to the Lord so that's what gloom is sometimes if you look at it at a long distance it looks gloomy and dark but you just stay with God's Word and be certain is God and when it moves up close you'll find is just angel's wings beating together bringing it all about to serve his purpose and serve his will he said I know the thoughts that I think of you there are thoughts of an expected end whether it be a rapture whether it be going home by the grave whatever it is it's going to be worked for his will and for his way she was somewhat like Abraham was called on to give everything she had and lay it upon the altar he said maybe you're cold like that today give up your ways give up your unbelief give up everything you got and just take the oil and the word and mix it together and put it on the altar of self-sacrifice and you'll find out it'll call God on the scene as certain as I'm standing in the pulpit you need God tonight mix the meal together take you some meal take a little bit of Jesus and the Spirit of God and let it begin to mix together in your heart be joy unspeakable and full of glory and all of a sudden what looks so gloomy looks so dark and so dismal looks so helpless and so hopeless you realize angels have drugged clothes it's angels among us in her homes on her a job a wall of fire moving about us God working everything according to his purpose and his plan and his will we can be certain in uncertain times because we have a certain God god bless you tonight as we bow our heads maybe a little different maybe a little different speak just want to soak in real deep turn your eyes back on Jesus keep him on him don't let him drift off in these times look only into his wonderful face and the things of this world will go strangely dim the gloom would just dissipate and the jaw bells of heaven open up in your heart and your soul [Music] he's here for you tonight are you willing
