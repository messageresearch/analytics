grown weak and you feel like you're all alone [Music] just don't give up for the god you serve he won't leave you and there's a miracle for you just keep holding on and there's a miracle [Music] in

making for you today [Music] hallelujah how many just take that for yourself today my prayers have been heard oh hallelujah you know it's like brother branham taught us that 25 cents as good as the loaf of bread so if you know your prayers have been heard and the answer is on the way well you can go ahead and rejoice before you even receive the answer because it's just as good as done praise the lord oh my let's just praise him this morning for all that he's done all the goodness that he's stowed upon us what a mighty god hallelujah who talked to some where to stand in the morning [Music] who

savior my king what a mighty god he is how we thank him this morning for his grace to us my his mercy endures forever right now his mercies are new every morning we have new mercies today oh his grace which is sufficient it's grace for us today amen [Music] sometimes you go through things like job did and it's never without a purpose or other words otherwise god would be the author of confusion and frustration but god's got a purpose he's got a plan and when it was all over with job had a deeper revelation of god than ever he could say i know because he looked ahead in time and and could see all the way to the redeemer coming and saying i know my redeemer liveth for the last days he'll stand upon the earth and though these skin worms would destroy my body yet in my flesh i'll see god who i will see for myself and not another you see that's the way it is every time that we have a troubled situation comes it is for the purpose of giving us a deeper revelation of god may god reveal himself to you today in a deeper way amen until turn every trial into a blessing that's he said all things work together for the good of them that love god to know that god is doing that he's working all things for your good he's got a purpose a plan for your life just walk in that plan amen we're blessed people today i'm looking across this congregation and we're able to worship together just about all almost unhindered today [Music] unfettered um [Music] i got a a a a text from a brother um stephen francis in south africa today and he said pray for us more restrictions or may be coming upon us that will keep us from worshiping and having church and i thought oh god how blessed we are to be able to assemble like we are this today and worship the lord together you know satan knew that we're here in the end time he knows his time is short so right here in the middle of this he sends one of these diseases to the country because he knows that we are to assemble even so much the more as we see that day approaching we're not to assemble less but more as we see that day approaching and so because of that the enemy comes in to try to hinder but you know when the spirit of god raises up the standard [Music] amen and i believe you're that standard that god's raising up in this last day amen against the enemy may speak today to the hearts and lives of each person jesus knows what your need is he's able to supply it we heard the song song there's a miracle in the working for you today do you feel the spirit of god come down as we heard that saying today the anointing just come down to confirm that that's because there's a miracle for you no matter where you are no matter how steeped in sin no matter how much trouble amen there's a miracle to turn that life around to move in your life to deal with your situation so expect him today to move on your behalf amen now let's just talk to the lord together father we love you and we thank you for your blessings to us the joy that we have of serving you the privilege that we have of coming together lord we thank you for each one that is here lord we ask for those that are not here that you'd be merciful to them that your holy spirit the angel of god the angel of your presence would just go right down to the rooms the houses where your believers are gathered that are not able to assemble together some are sick in their bodies some approaching surgery other situations are coming but may they know there's a miracle for them today that there's a healer there's a healer for he was wounded for our transgressions by those traps we were healed when you walked among the shores of galilee you healed all that were sick and you showed us your will concerning all that there is all in the atonement you heal everyone lord you're the god that heals all and i pray lord for everyone under the atonement today you'll bring healing for those that are outside of the atonement may they receive that atonement the blood of jesus and cleanse them from sin so they can be recipients of the grace of god i pray lord you bring healing everywhere lord everywhere this goes healing in the body the soul the spirit that you'll do a work of grace we ask it in jesus name amen amen god bless you we're going to turn to john chapter 14. very familiar scripture really but one we want to speak on this morning that's upon our hearts to minister on john 14 and verse 12 amen it's so good to be in the house of the lord today and be able to worship together with you believing that he will minister to you in a very special way amen john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you that he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go into my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it amen thank god for his unfailing words a promise second kings chapter 2 verse 9 will be our second reading today 2 kings chapter 2 verse 9 it would do well maybe to have read even more this chapter but we'll read this portion and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and elijah saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took also up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan and took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the god of elijah and when he had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elijah and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him amen god bless you you can have your seats there is this type of elijah and elisha and me we're going to be speaking about that this morning as we speak of a people of a double portion this is going to be our title for today a people of a double portion it's always good to look in the promises of the word because it positions us in our place it helps us to know where we are in the word of god and what the word spoke about us in this last day and this great type of elijah and elijah if it's correctly placed is concerning jesus and his bride because she is to continue his ministry and you can see here in this very story that there was elijah that was going to be taken up in a whirlwind and yet the continuation of his ministry in in elisha and then we see again you know in um the same thing with um with jesus that his ministry is to continue upon the earth now in a prophecy concerning the bride the holy spirit put up on brother branham's pen some things to write and these are prophecies that are spoken about in this last day that someone must fulfill how many believes that you're in the fulfillment of prophecy so as he said that those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still and they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through his bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now he will now fulfill through the bride that work that which he left for this specific time and remember there's always a word to be fulfilled and we have a purpose here in this last day in fulfilling the promises now in all truthfulness we know that there is an elijah for our day malachi 4 said that very clearly that before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord that he would send unto us elijah the prophet and it would be that an elijah anointing upon a man that would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers in other words bring a restoration and and so as we know there is an elijah for our day but that type does not include another to take his prophetic anointing now there is no elisha ministry to follow this great prophet in this last day which we know is william branham there there's no elisha ministry to follow him he was the seventh angel and there's not another to follow him there is not another gentile prophet there's not an apostle or uh or another who will follow this messenger an eighth messenger he is the last to the gentiles and next elijah will be to the jews and we are in the bright age but it is not an age separate from the seventh angel and his message however the type of the double portion certainly applies when it comes to jesus amen and what a greater one to receive a double portion from amen and and because he said the works that i do shall you do also and greater than these shall you do now this promise was not all given to brother branham only although it included him but we and we saw the ministry of christ manifested through him but it was not exclusive to him you see is a promise given to the entire church who believes on him how many is a believer amen so the whole ones that believe john 14 12 is applicable to every believer let's read it again john 14 12 verily verily it's when jesus makes uh an emphasis it's it's like an oath it's like um a double confirmation you know he is saying verily verily i say unto you he's placing emphasis on something that he wants you to get he said i say to you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go to my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do for the father that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything say anything anything in my name i will do it now of course when when leaving jesus said these words you know the works that i do if you'll notice this place right in john 14 as as jesus begins to um even in chapter 17 begins to pray over his disciples and and say his parting words before the crucifixion and this is part of those very things because um he will he will say in in the early part of this chapter you know again that i'm going to go away and if i go away i will come again to receive you to myself and i won't leave you comfortless but i will come to you you see he was giving all of these parting words and as he gave these parting words he said greater works than that i have done you will do and and of course the word greater we know means more because you didn't couldn't do greater in quality but just in quantity because he was there in one person but god represented in one man the fullness of the godhead in one body the man christ jesus but now today he is represented in the universal church worldwide everywhere so you see more than this shall you do because it wouldn't just be one doing the works of christ but it would be multitudes doing the works of christ and so he says the world will see me no more but you will see me i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world now these are promises that are left to us that we must hold on to with all our hearts today i just shared this from the five identifications of the true church he quotes john portion of john 14 12 and he said he gives a teaching of what the church should do verily verily i say to you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go to my father that's the message of the church about jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever living in the church king of the church raised from the dead same yesterday today and forever performing the same works doing the same things jesus did that is the message of the church if the church isn't teaching that it's teaching some false theology that's what jesus commanded them to preach so now notice this is our message our message is john 14 12 the works that jesus did shall you do also and greater than these shall you do you see it is what has been commanded to be our messages our instructions that he left as he was as he was departing from the earth he would leave these instructions to the church the works that i do shall you do also of these signs shall follow them that believe mark 16 some more of his parting words according to mark you see again these works would be done you know if you look in the greek it's more shall you do because why god was just in one man but now he's in his whole church you see he god was in one man then all men who believe him now more than this shall you do for i go to my father i'll turn back to the light that i was and i led the children of israel through the wilderness i'll turn back to that and in a little while i'll come again john 14 12 the works that i do shall you do also and now he said and more than this now in this day an indictment was brought against the unbelieving generation for the purpose of killing the effect of the world and this is how they crucify christ and put him to an open shame and i just want to say it is a shame to let the sick lay unhealed it is a shame to not give people the opportunity to die out on an altar and die there with their sacrifice you see that's the whole secret of the new birth it isn't just making a little profession of faith oh i believe jesus is to be the savior of the world but it's more than that it's you it's you dying out to sin and to unbelief and being born again you've got to die with your lamb die as dead as jesus died died to the old man your old desires your own sinful nature amen that old perverted spirit amen you've got to die to the whole thing in order to be born again now we find out this light this tree christ was is rejected again by the church what do they do they'll take a false glare of the light rather than taking the true light amen these are false glares and and listen church to us he's got to be the same today in every detail as he was in his corporal body amen doing the same thing now again we we're at the end of the last age and i'm quoting brother branham on this one and and there's a man that can turn on the light if we're at the if we're at the last end of the age where is them greater works going to come and he says we're here amen we're here it's the day at the last of the age that the greater works that jesus spoke about must be fulfilled there cannot be a rapture there cannot be the change of the body there cannot be a resurrection without fulfilling the word are you with me amen but now notice it's not to be less of his works but more of his works it is actually to be magnified let me just share with you the way he spoke about it he said the east or the west here has come back and met the east in other words it's come right back around to the same thing again it was moses even picked up sand and said let there be fleas and so and so forth like that on the earth but in the last day he don't take anything just the word let it be and what is it what is said and that's the way it will be and he said i'll testify some of the things tonight of what's happened you'll see he is still god his words cannot the works that i do shall you do also and greater than this shall you do i took a fish to make a fish you didn't but you don't even have to have a fish amen the same son of god that took a fish off of a fish is the same son of god today the works that i do shall you do also and greater than this will you do it will be magnified greater than this so we're living in the day where the works of christ is not just to be here but they are to be magnified now bear with me if i labor a little bit on this but i i want you to get it clearly because this helps us to know our position what is expected of us in this hour what parts are we to fulfill amen he said did you notice when he went to make water in the wine he took water first and already created sepsis and turned it into wine when he fed 5 000 people he took a fish that swam in the water and broke it and handed it out and multiplied creation he took bread that was once weed and baked into bread and broke it and hung it out or handed it out to the people and it returned back again multiplied creation but in the last days where there was no sign of creation he speaks it in the creation anyhow chose to be the same god that was at the beginning amen he can create squirrels he can create what he wants to because he's god and greater than this shall you do for i go to my father the word is infallible and it has to be manifest and has to be fulfilled greater than this shall you do not multiplying but speaking out into creation no wonder the bible tells us in revelation 10 8 you must prophesy or speak the word again now you see satan knows now if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works are you with me she will be an invincible army this is what we got to know we can do the greater works we are ordained commission ordered to do the greater works the works that i do shall you do also and greater hallelujah now it's in the atonement so if it's in the atonement it's for every one of us that's in the atonement the church claims a greater work by preaching the gospel all around the world that's where they claim they're doing the greater work so we're doing the greater work than jesus did and some fellows said to brother branham that said oh we do the greater works he said well just do the works that he did you know do that first and so what we got denominational brethren that's preaching the gospel all around the world he couldn't do that he said okay so that's the greater words we'll just do the works and then we'll talk about the greater works and then he says are you lecturing because that's what the devil wants to turn us into is a bunch of lectures with just a bunch of fancy teaching amen with with all mechanics and no dynamics are you with me he said are you election but jesus never said go into all the world and teach this or that he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and to preach is to demonstrate the power of the holy spirit amen these signs shall follow them that believe it doesn't come by lectures and then it comes by the presence of the living god moving among in human flesh proving himself that he was in the that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen but it comes so simple and it's the simplicity that drives the intellectual mind away from it it can't be that's too simple now but i want you to know we're preaching the gospel that works and it's not just lectures when i think about the 10 that was there at youth camp and thereafter the the last camp that we had and one after another of demon spirits that were cast out amen because of young people being bound with pornography and sex demons that was driving them out of their minds am i but deliverance came and because there is a church today doing the greater works that are not just given a lecture but are actually given a preaching the gospel and that means to demonstrate the gospel now of course the believers are to be identified and they are they are to be marked or identified by signs the bible said these signs shall follow them that believe that would be their identity is that right i mean i i thought about it as i as i raised animals down through the years and and you know i had a prize heard and there were registered animals i had my initials was given to me as tdp to put in their right ear every animal that was bred and known by me that was that was born on my farm got that tattoo in his ear he was marked forever and identified with me amen anybody anywhere can pick up the ear of that of that goat and pick it up and look at it and see that in that ear is my initials and they can trace it back to who to the very person there where it was born in his herd because that animal is identified with me now do you know jesus is also a great shepherd but i want you to know that in his this case not only is his sheep marked but he himself is marked and he puts his own mark that's what i was doing putting my mark up my own name in that goat's ear amen now isaiah 49 14. i want to read it to you where he's marked he said but zion said the lord has forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me and he gives a he said wait wait wait a minute he says can a woman forget her suckling child that she would not have compassion on the son of a womb and he said yep they might can it's possible a woman to forget yet i'll not forget thee for i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thou walter continually before me so now he says of zion which is jerusalem your name is engraved in the palms of my hand but that is true for every believer he can never ever forget you [Music] that mind his whole body carries the mark of why he came to earth and it was for your redemption amen oh my no when the sheep is mark you're saying and i'm quoting this from shepherd to the sheepfold when the sheep was marked here's a beautiful part that's all right preacher but what about all these marks then everybody we're marked one's marked this way and one's marked the way once an orthodox or episcopalian or this let me just say that's why you can many times easily look at a person and see the mark of satan all over them come on you can see in their dress their behavior their walk their attitude the mark of satan you'd say brother tim oh i'm worried about this mark of the beast that might come up oh i'm not going to take this vaccine because they'll get my my they'll get my social security oh forget it they already got you you already got a number but what i'm worried about is the mark of sin on your soul the mark of satan that is in people's lives where they are where they are identifying themselves with with another shepherd a false shepherd are you with me but i want you to know that that god's sheep will hear his voice amen and you might be lost and away from god you may be one of the the ones that left the 99 and went out and you're in the office mess there is in the world but i tell you there comes a voice of god that will awaken the seed gene on the inside of you hallelujah and when it does you will come to the shepherd amen maybe you don't even know why you're here this morning but that's exactly why you're here it's the drawing of the shepherd it's his voice reaching out to you [Music] know what he's trying to tell you you never originally belonged to the devil what i come to realize i never was the devil's child he tried to make him be with him but i never was his amen he says i'm going to tell him for the sake of all those who've never maybe heard this story but the story of a of a little boy you know that made him a little sailboat he made this little sailboat and he loved that sailboat oh man he crafted it by hand he made it so beautifully to sail and he you know he he would get it out and he would run it up and down the seashore or the the shore of the lake and and and oh it was a beautiful little boat he had lots of fun hours playing with it one day a big wind came along and blew it out of his reach and he looked out there and he saw his sailboat out of his reach and they're drifting further and further and further away from him and every day he would go down to the shore looking to see maybe today it washed up maybe today and he'd walk along that seesaw looking for it and there you know he never found it and he would look and every day oh my sailboat i i missed the hours of fun and you know all that i had with you and all of this one day he was in the town and he he saw in a pawn shop looked into the window and there was his sailboat all this sailboat my sailboat he looked in there and he saw the price it was a price it was a high price he didn't have the money for it i don't know if i've scraped up all my change if i brought my piggy bank i wouldn't have the money so you know what he did he went and sold all that he had all of his toys he sold them all and he went down to that pawn shop and he bought that sailboat oh i remember another gravemaker amen he left all the glory left all that he had to come right down to earth for us come on and when that little boy when he grabbed that sailboat and he clutched it in his arms he could be heard as he walked out of the pawn shop little boat you are mine you are twice mine you were mine when i made you and you were mine when i bought you and i'm preaching to people today there are christ gods you were kids before the world began you were in his mind you were in his thinking and he said i'll never ever forget you hallelujah and when you were lost from him he left all the glory to find you he left all of heaven he left the throne he gave it all up to come down to find you and he found you in the devil's pawn shop but he didn't leave you there and he can save you today you are fine you are twice mine [Applause] this shepherd bore the mark of his sheep in his hand he was nailed to the cross a mother can forget her suckling's bait but i'll never forsake you because your names are written in my hand i know my sheep my sheep know me they're marked with the same mark think about that now so then his church has got to have the same mark what kind of mark did he have spiritually speaking when he's here on the earth he was despised and rejected a man of sorrow acquainted with grief but god was with him signs and wonders accompanied him everywhere he went and he could discern the thoughts of their heart and he said i do as the father shows me the sick was healed the dead was raised up the poor had the gospel preached and the church of the living god bears the mark of the living god these things that i do shall you do also saint john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater than thee shall he do for i go to my father you're branded that is to be the mark of the church the the church must bear the marks of christ identified by his signs and wonders amen you know and again it's to be more works because no one can do greater because but but the because because the works would now be done in a multi-member body god happened every one of you to do the works of god amen now so again the works that i do now as i say in saying this great because no one could do greater because he raised the dead he stopped nature he done everything that could be done he stopped the roaring sea he made the winds be still he raised up the dead after they were corrupted in the grave and no one could do that any greater in quantity but being that his spirit would come into church and reach out it would be a universal church all around the world and they could do more of the same things that he was doing amen now this is important because this is a last day scripture this as i read you was to be fulfilled in the end of the last age now i don't know what you're going to do if you done left this last age but if you're here in this last age you'll do the works of christ now notice the again brother branham said he would continue he wants to bring the holy ghost to you to continue the same works that he was doing in christ the work wasn't so needy in the days of luther that was god's church but it was a bit more neater in the days of wesley because the world the bible said would get weaker and wiser and more wickeder all the time the world is getting more wicked we know that why do men do what they're doing a hundred years ago you would never thought there'd be a human being that cruel more wicked all the time and the wicked shall do wickeder all the time said the scripture more and more how many knows we're in a day of increased iniquity amen and he would even be in a time of the increased iniquity that the love of many would wax coal it would be as more wickedness would abound and and evil would continue until men would be of a reprobate mind concerning the truth they're depraved they'll do things that are unseemly and brother timothy read that from romans 1 the other day the perversions that's in the land today amen god never intends that it's not of god god made them one male and one female amen this is what true marriage is you say brother tim but i have tendency that's a lie of the devil amen that's a satanic anointing that didn't come from god it didn't come from your maker it's the mark of satan trying to destroy life are you with me amen but jesus came that you might have life and life more abundantly and i'll tell you there is healing and deliverance in the name of jesus amen as we said today is a day of miracles now satan has been moving and moving steadily why brother we're seeing things even in our nations here we came across the across from the other lands as the pilgrims why did they come they come for religious freedoms amen because rome had put such pressure upon them until they couldn't worship with freedom of religion is that right now today they want it they take they take liberty so far they want freedom from religion and man they press it further than what was ever intended freedoms are taken further than it was ever intended amen the rights to marry is taken further than ever intended never was intended for men to marry men and women to marry women that wasn't never intended our constitution didn't didn't write that they didn't believe that it's when our liberties you see they turn the grace of god into lasciviousness or a license to sin permission to do evil amen and what does it do it's a horrible influence upon young children my mind it you use uh it corrupts the mind it destroys lives now satan satan has been moving steadily as i said we came over here for freedom of religion and and as a as a nation what no no time here the catholics followed right behind us today the very rome that persecuted the church that exterminated 68 million of believers come on this is their history they know hey man just read fox's book of martyr's day it's written it's recorded but he's been moving steadily and now of the eight supreme justices that we have all a roman catholic but two jews and then mr biden is elected which i don't know what's going to happen there he'll be the you'll be a roman catholic president so here we are and now but you know what's so amazing the horror of the book of revelation the bible calls her a horse she sits on seven heels she's reading purple and scarlet you know why she's a because she was to stay true to the word and she mixed her seed with others she took in other lovers come on that's what made her a i mean i know that's plain but still that's what made her hard the bible calls her and her daughters are like her the other denominational systems are harlots the bible says so somebody's got to fulfill that but thank god there's a virgin bride too and somebody's going to fulfill that too is that right amen but you see the world is becoming so immoral it takes the horror to appear as moral she is a mother trans iranian sum of the immorality of her children oh don't do that you know but you know but it's for her own agenda and for the most part let's just take it on the other side mr trump is a vile man but the uh but the but the ups but upside these left wingers he appears as a saint amen because the world is extremely wicked and it is children for destruction so why are you preaching like this not to preach politics i am preaching this because there's somebody going to escape the things that are coming up on the earth there's somebody going in a rapture there's somebody hallelujah will be translated like enoch was like elijah was we read about [Applause] and we're in the days of it that's right so brother branham says he says again it's been more wickeder all the time the world is getting weaker and wiser more wicked all the time but what's this so has the holy spirit been moving that's why i told you when we heard about this kobe coming and people was calling death angel and they was getting all afraid and all of this and that and i said but every time you see the devil move god is moving somewhere hallelujah amen and we've faced mr covete and overcome [Music] amen come on amen you see because let the devil do his worst jesus christ is at his best that won't be enough for us this morning amen we can lean on those everlasting arms and no we're secure from all harm so he says the holy spirit has been moving there was a little breath of it with luther a little blow of it with wesley and a deeper blow with the pentecost and now the breath and the spirit has become the same and she's united and bringing forth that same powerful blow with the holy ghost like he did back there is a manifest in the same works that he did back there is being manifested right today the same thing watch what jesus said verily verily i say to you the son can do nothing except he sees the father doing it first what the father does he shows the son the father dwelleth in me he doeth the works amen and you know what part of the greater work says part of the greater works is to impart life are you with me amen you know there's it's great work to heal the sick it's a great work to cast out devils by prayer those are great works amen and and like i said that ought to be the principal job of the church to cast out devils because every time a man is saved the devil is cast out amen you say well brother tim i got devils and i need to be delivered i'll tell you how repent invite another king to come sit on your throne amen but he's not going to come in and co-occupy the throne you've got to get rid of one for another to come the lord dealt with me this morning three o'clock about this brother joe asked me in the back what are you troubled about i said that's why because at three o'clock this morning god was dealing with me in order for christ to reign in you there's got to be a dethroning of satan's sin nature inside of you the two cannot dwell together but impart eternal life to believers is part of our works in fact it's greater works it's a greater work than healing the sick that's right casting out devils amen to impart eternal life you see this is what calvary meant it meant to take stoop degraded men listen this is where we are in time remember the last call the last call that comes out is to go out in the highways and the byways and compel them to come in the last call is for those that looks unredeemable that looks unforgivable that is so messed up that only grace could turn their lives around that's where the last call comes and i'm looking at some of you that are saints today that were them kind of people but of god god-rich and mercy turned your life around he wouldn't let you stay there he wouldn't let you rot in the mire in the muck of sin we got deacons in this church we had preachers in this church we got we got all all kinds that have been that were in the lowest levels of sin but god rich in mercy and i'll tell you if he can do it for you if he can do it for me he can do it for you hallelujah and the last call goes out in the highways and the byways and compels them come and say i must have men and women at my feast hey mom they reject my marriage feast say you reject being united with me amen i made the call once said i i've got to riches and mother says i i've got uh goods to look after and i married a wife you know that's a lot of men's problems a lot of women's trouble too they married a man and it was a hindrance and i'm not even preaching about you saints that are married right there don't take that one god gave you a wife and you say she's been my hindrance you know what i'd do i'd get down to an altar somewhere until i got rid of the hindrance in my own soul until i become a priest in my home that i could bring down heaven into my home and change situations rather than change wives too many times we're so interested in changing others we forget to look in the mirror and see i'm the one let it start with me but you see what calvary did it took stoop degraded men and women and lifted them to a place to be sons and daughters of god to heal the sick and they empowered eternal life by giving the holy ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers were made believers and in impart spiritual life this has got to be the work of the church no wonder the devil is so against altar cults did you hear what i said the devil said brother tim in our church we preach against altar because it's the devil amen he said well brother tim we don't have to have an altar everybody has to have an altar you read the book of hebrews you can't approach god except through the altar there may not be this altar right here but it's an altar somewhere if it's in your heart or in the closet or wherever it is you've got to have an altar where you die to sin and the unbelieving are born again by the holy spirit and it's a crying shame when the church is around around even around the message remove the altar out of the church and put it in the basement because our principal work ought to be to preach calvary well brother tim we're in the day mercy is over oh wait a minute when did god die and leave you in charge mercy's not over man just you you have never tasted mercy so you haven't undergiven when you have mercy jesus said freely as you receive freely gift so if you receive mercy you're going to give mercy that's the whole thing of what it does for you it it takes the hearty and the proud and it makes somebody with a soul that longs to see someone else saved what is one of the signs he said i'll put a mark on those that sign cry for the abominations in the city amen i'll identify mine elect by desiring their heart they will have a desire to see the law saved now when jesus was there he could not impart the holy spirit he said if i go not away the comforter cannot come in me dwells upon us to the godhead bodily i'm with you now but i will be in you but in order to do that i got to go to calvary and in order to go to calvary there i'll get my life i'll raise from the dead i'll send the glory i send the glory but i'll come again people talk about the coming of the lord and they don't know the first thing about it the first thing about is coming is the day of pentecost amen because on the day of pentecost he came again not another jesus not another spirit the same spirit the bible said if you don't have the spirit of christ you're none of his the holy spirit came down on the day of pentecost to impart life now so you see the church is to do the greater work in other words they are to preach the baptism of the holy ghost so this has got to be one of our main thrusts as a church to preach the baptism of the holy ghost and no it's not emotion but emotion comes with it it's not a sensation but it is sensational it's not a feeling but it can be felt somebody help me preach hey man amen it's not a tongue but it does have tongues with it it's not a shout but shouting does come with it oh man rejoicing it's not rejoicing people get happy over a piece of pie bring me a piece today after church and i'll show y'all get out but it is let me tell you happiness is not the holy ghost but the holy ghost brings happiness amen so as elisha received the mantle of elijah and thus double his anointing even so the church is to be baptized with the same baptism that baptized jesus isn't that wonderful i'm going to show you in the bible where he said his disciples would receive his baptism amen let's go to matthew chapter 20 verse 20. we all hear this a lot of times we kind of skim over it because of this selfish mother this mother wanted her children want them to sit uh uh you know one what to sit on the right hand on the other left verse 21 now and he said in her what will thou she said unto him grant that my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom you know they had it in their mind it was going to be a physical kingdom and he would be the reina son of david and they wanted she wanted her son's position so she's asking this positions i want one to my right and on your right and on the left and jesus answered and said you don't know what you're asking that's right and he said are you able to drink the cup i shall drink up and to be baptized with the baptism that i'm baptized with and they said unto him we are able and he said unto them you shall indeed drink of my cup and be baptized with the baptism i'm baptized with so jesus promised that his disciples would receive the same baptism oh brother them that was water baptism no they had already been water baptized amen and so they asked him are you able or he asked them are you able to drink up my cup are you able to be baptized with the same baptism i'm baptized with and he said unto them in verse 23 ye shall indeed drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i'm baptized with but to sit on my right hand on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom is prepared of my father so notice he said you shall surely drink you're going to drink my cup and you're going to be baptized with the baptism i am baptized with that's right amen now this cup that the disciples would drink from would be the cup of bitter persecution amen and every child of god goes through it bitter persecutions tribulations troubles and then jesus said in this world you will have tribulation this is a given as long as you're in this world you're going to have tribulation come on somebody amen but that ain't all he said but he said but be of good cheer i have overcome the world you're gonna have tribulation in this world but i'm with the world already don't worry about it amen as i conquered you're going to conquer as you will as i overcame you're going to overcome isn't that what he said to the last church age amen he that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne now you want to know who's going to be granted to sit with him ever overcomer amen i'll grab to sit with me in my throne that even as i overcome right you see you're gonna overcome just like he did you know the thing about jesus when he was inoculated from sin god didn't worry about it he led him by the spirit right away to be tempted of the devil we want to thank old man you know this new god this new new christian keep them away from sin that's not what god did with jesus he said take him down there and tempt him let lucifer himself trying because i'm not afraid of the baptism that he's baptized with i am not afraid that he's going to get down there and get lost again come on i'm not i'm preaching about you now because jesus could ever be lost but you amen you can but once you're saved you can never be lost again and he's not afraid of it hey man this is why he would say about his salvation you ever yeah some people say i need the joy of my salvation it ain't your salvation he never said it was he said restore to me the joy of thy salvation the salvation is of the lord it wasn't you saving yourself it was him saving you amen and because he saved you he will never lose you he said the devil there is nothing can ever pluck him out of my father's hand oh hallelujah no wonder you're oh the welcome matters laid out come unto me everyone that is heavy laden and i will give them rest my yoke is easy ah the yoke of sin is not easy it'll put you through hell on earth yes a lot of people feel hell out in the hereafter you ought to feel fear the hell is going to come to you by living in sin it'll be hell in your marriage be hell in your homes it'll be hell at night when you're trying to sleep [Music] amen it'll be hell everywhere you look come on amen you say brother tim they think that wait for me well let me just tell you something if you're a child of god it'll be hell for you because if you're predestinated of god you wasn't made to live in the devil's hell i mean satan's children may be happy in hell but we're not going to be happy in hell amen any believer that would wind up in hell would be the most unhappiest people because they're out of place so they ain't going to go to hell because hell was not created for them it was created for the devil and his angels [Applause] somebody said to me it was an account at one time i sat down across from he was doing my taxes and he looked at me and he said preacher i don't understand something about the bible what y'all are preaching i said what are you what are you talking about he said well how could a loving father send his own children to hell and i said he won there won't be one of his in hell not a one hell was not created for you amen and let me just tell you the hell if you're a sinner today and you're living in the hell it was god didn't create that for you your own sins created that hell i said well i need to change well i'll tell you there is a change amen there's a change that is needed there's a change of a heart he said he said in his very word he said a new heart and a new spirit i will give them and then he said i'll place my spirit in them so you see god will do the greatest exchange that could ever be given to change a soul there whose heart is hardened from sin and i believe and change that heart and give them a new attitude toward god and a new spirit a new desire i want to do right but god knows you can't make it alone with just a new heart and a new spirit so he said i'm not going to leave you there i'm not through with what i'm doing i'm going to put my spirit in you and my spirit will cause you to walk in my statutes and keep my judgments and do them that's what god's spirit will do in a person it'll make them obedient to the word so you see the cup that the disciples would drink would be the cup of bitter persecutions to be scoffed at to be ridiculed to be made fun of that brother tim they make fun of my long hair and as a girl and well you know you're identifying as one of his that's right since you're identifying as one of his that make fun of him i might you know you say i'm identified with wearing you know i i'm made fun of rather with wearing a dress well yeah because you're not to put on a garment that pertains to a man this is a bible god said i hate it say well brother tim that's just the old law there deuteronomy 22 5. that's just the old law there well what about a man putting on a woman's garment that's what the bible said amen god never wanted the seeds to cross he made them distinctly male and female it's the devil that comes along and brings the perversion are you with me amen but you see when you when you come and drink of his cup you're going to be scoffed at and ridiculed and you ought to rejoice and and counted a great honor to be accounted worthy to suffer various namesake he suffered so much on your account why don't you want to be identified with him ought to be identified with him oh holy rollers and emo holiness people well what do you want to be identified unholy people amen to be scoffed at ridiculed and made fun of you to drink that cup to be called beelzebub ah that church is a bunch of black stalking people they're uh they're they're they're weird they're different all these long skirts and long hair what's called the bible the bible told you the bible told a woman not to cut her hair the bible told a man not to have long hair said nature itself you even go against nature itself to go and wear long hair because you see again because but but again it is showing the mark that is on you but you know what stay that way let me let me just say it this way the reason why now look you know you know with one of my animals i could take and i could put some other numbers through there and wipe out my my name my letters but it was still there it was just covered over my name was always there in that animal's ear he was marked forever and maybe it is with you you've been marked forever maybe with by the devil you were marked your old forever you know your old man your old life marked mired amen scarred up by the evils of sin and you bore boring your body to marxist satan but i got something for you you see that animal could never be born again with a clean ear come on but you can be born again and god can put his mark upon you and mark you with the shepherd's mark and say this is my sheep that old man i'm not identified with that verse murk but this new birth that is my son that is my daughter and i'm identified with them and that's how we're identified is in our new birth now let's just go a little further now to be baptized with his baptism did you notice he they said they were asked yes they were asked can you be baptized with the baptism i was baptized with what a glorious baptism yeah it happened after his water baptism as an obedient lamb he come to be washed in the in the water came to the prophet in the water but think about this for a moment you see there was not just a water baptism that took place and i want to get this to you you can be baptized in water and go down a dry center come up a wetland but i want you to hear something jesus didn't just have a water baptism but the heavens opened and the dove like a light a pillar of fire are you with me come fluttering down like a dove amen and dwells upon him is that right it abode upon him and it came in him the very light of that pillar of fire come on the inside the great i am that i am came to dwell in that vessel and that's what jesus said can you be baptized with this same heavenly baptism i'm baptized with this is why on the day of pentecost this is what happened there in the upper room come on you know there is that flattering dove came down at the river jordan it was a light fluttering around the heavens open he was a pillar of fire a whipping whirling fire here it comes on the day of pentecost and there cometh sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind as the wings of the holy spirit and that pillar of fire came and it looked like clove and tongues are whipping wings of fire and it abode on all of them in the upper room and they were baptized with the same baptism that jesus received hallelujah there it is the same baptism that jesus got there on the day of pentecost they received that same baptism amen do you see that's exactly why you've got to have to get this holy ghost just like jesus receive the spirit now notice now as we're saying this because you see this this is really important to to grasp the the importance of it we're baptized with this important with the same baptism and that was the mantle like elijah's mantle came down from elijah as he went up in the whirlwind and he took there the mantle and now begin to do the works of elijah that's right the same things that elijah had done elijah had walked up to that river smote it with his mantle hallelujah and the water's open and now jesus comes and and and of course he sends the holy spirit and when he does he sends back the same mantle oh hallelujah you want a licensed man let me just tell you the battle of jesus has been passed over to you hallelujah we're coming down from his ascension he sends back the holy ghost to rest upon the church that they can be baptized with the same baptism the same holy ghost to do the works of jesus that the works that i do shall you do us and greater than these for shall you do because i'm going to the father and when i go to the father i'm sending back you got to see me and my going away you got to see me in my ascension you got to see me as i leave as i left the earth i'm sending back something for the church what is it it's a double portion this is what this is what we're preaching about to open the book the transfer title does for the sins of god it makes us kings with domain and that domain is the word of god and the priests to to to intercede for every promise and this blood positions us as sons and being positioned as a son then you have the authority and the right to speak hey but this is where we come back around brother branham said greater works he said there he took bread and broke off and made more bread he took water turned it into wine he took fish and made more fish that's right but he said i'm showing you some examples of what god's done in this day to create things and speak them right into existence we're talking about a people of mountain moving faith the blood positioned you as the sun and under that blood create moses would strike to strike the ground it would turn into into insects he would strike the water he would turn into blood he would call for the frogs to come up out of the water he called for the flies are you with me but now he says the works that i do this church is going to do also so what will it do it will heal the sick it will cast out devils it will speak with new towns amen if they drink any deadly thing it will not harm them i'm just i'm just quoting the scripture come on church amen and the works that i do shall you do also and greater than these and it's not exclusive to one man anymore it wasn't jesus but not any longer because he said more than this shall you do because i go to my father amen so why should we take something artificial when the heavens is full of the genuine and the fullness of the holy ghost why should we take just a church joining when we can be filled with the spirit washed by the blood do the works of christ be have the mark of christ i'm gonna close this service a little early today because you have come to the place of a people of a double portion there is healing for the sick spiritually or physically there is healing for the sick no matter how sick you have been there's a double portion been given to the church that no matter how far you stray away from christ he's here to bring you in and birth you again and mark you as one of his own he promised to send back his holy spirit a double portion to the church which should bow your head with me by having musicians come yeah i usually preach a little longer than this and no i'm not out of notes but the holy spirit has taken me down some avenues today dealing with me very early in the morning very early are you willing to drink of his cup will you receive of his baptism the holy spirit calling speaking dealing with man he said i'll not always strive with man and he would cut the work short in noah's day and destroy all flesh with water and he said i'll not do it with water again. but he said he'd send fire when the days of atomic fire nuclear warfare can destroy this world over many times it will burn we've already seen the elijah ministry come and go to turn hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers we've already seen the holy spirit send that elijah ministry we're so close to the burning so you say brother tim i i'm not afraid so afraid of hell today what about the hell you're living in what about the hell that you made for yourself my life is all mixed up who did it you turned down the voice of god time after time i'm confused by the tim what brought that confusion you listen to the wrong voice [Music] do you want to rule and reign with him do you want to be an overcomer you want to rise up above that hell that you're in [Music] and find mercy at the foot of the cross say i'm really needing a change brother tim well here's the greatest change could be offered to man a change of heart a change of art a change in your spirit spirit all gets mixed up and messed up it's time to surrender to god it's the only thing that can change you you can be changed in his presence and you don't have to remain the same let's just break it by this just break through it just a little bit by raising your hand to god and say god i need out of this hell i'm in just raise your hand to god that's it god sees you there up in the mezzanine there back in the back back over here over there there here i need out of the mess that i've made for myself i need to find a god reaching mercy so what did that do brother tim that little move toward god might not have been very much but it was a move he said draw nigh to god and i'll draw nigh to you this is his word of promise if you reach out to him right now let him deal with your heart you say uh brother tim i really need deliverance i've got spirits that really bind me there's only one way of deliverance and that's through repentance [Music] you gotta hate sin you gotta hate that evil spirit that has caused you to sin has pulled you down in the muck of the world got to come to place you don't love that spirit you're not gonna worship him no longer you worshiped him you you've done obeisance to him you've fallen down you let him come and take control of your life [Music] but it can be different from this day on you don't have to be the same anymore [Music] everyone every child of god been born again can tell you that when they were born again a little heaven came down unto them life from heaven eternal life came down into that soul and changed them change their atmosphere change their attitude change the spirit [Music] right now that's exactly what can happen to you if you want to no longer live in hell there is a heaven for you it can be a heaven in your marriage it can be a heaven in your home because heaven's in the soul that's where it all starts it starts right there with you [Music] you see you started out in life and we walked away from god [Music] and the spirit took you maybe it was a lie from there you took another spirit you took another first thing you know you're like legion you're just full of every kind of evil vile thing but today can be a day today can be the moment while you're in the midst of a people of a double portion that your life can be changed forever so but you don't know brother jim you don't
