praise because you deserve it because our lord and we are god blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah thank you lord we appreciate you jesus today we bow before you in your presence knowing that you are here because you said we're two or more gatherer i'll be there lord but we feel the witness of your presence lord as it moves out across the congregation and they rejoice because whether it's elohim or adonai or whether it's el shaddai or whether it's whatever name you manifested yourself in you came in the fullness of all of that when you came flesh and dwelt among us so that the fullness of the godhead would dwell in jesus christ and today lord we call on that name we know the name of god we know the name of our redeemer we know the name of our savior it's the name of jesus christ and that that name every knee has to bow and every tongue confess he's lord lord we have done that we have owned you as our lord but more than that father we have been born and birthed into your kingdom you're not just our lord but you're our father and we're your children we are heirs and joiners with you lord what a blessing it is to serve you today god as we have this morning kind of our easter service being that our services will be down at camp lord i pray that you'll bless your people anoint us in your presence for your resurrection life and power i ask it in jesus name amen and amen one should remember the services down at dry creek in louisiana we're going to not have a service here wednesday or our next sunday here our easter services will be down at dry creek louisiana as we have done you know the last 35 years except for the covet period so you know if you can attend them or you can find them online or we're going to try to live stream them and but if not you can catch the archives so god bless you and it good to be in his presence well in his presence is the fullness of joy amen thank you we're going to read from genesis 17 as we continue looking at el shaddai we're going to be speaking of resurrection life and power amen resurrection life and power what a gl what a great god we serve amen full of power full of resurrection life genesis 17 and 1 and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god that's el shaddai walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make that covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying you can be seated now we as i look at things in this time and this hour that we're living in and some of the climate and the atmospheres around us i find it amazing sometimes how some can constantly criticize how god moves on others and sometimes to the point of blasphemy in the message respect brother branham cautioned us he said when we receive the holy ghost it is not shaking hands with the pastor receiving the holy ghost is receiving christ into you because he's god's messenger of the day the holy ghost is god's messenger and we must respect him when he comes don't say he he look at that woman shouting there and crying and tears running down her cheeks look at that man shaking his hands and trembling and crying you know what that is that's a bunch of worked up emotion you are blaspheming the holy ghost you've got to respect that now you know if you noticed in here when we read the scripture and i'm going to deal with this just for a moment but the bible said and abram fell on his face and god talked with him you know there are instances in the bible were actually demons through a boy to the ground and oftentimes would throw him into the fire and and and of course what what is called today fallen out in the spirit which is been a phenomena actually since um um sanctification in the methodist era um you know and it's become impersonated until it's become a sham or a charade among the pentecostals and some charismatics but someone who just classified all is of the devil but there's many instances of the bible of the presence of god coming upon a person and then falling in god's presence so overwhelmed by the powerful presence of the almighty you know what we we think about this and you know let me just interview moses for a moment moses well what about you he said well when me and aaron entered the tent of meeting and when they cut and we came out and we blessed the people the glory of the lord appeared to all the people and the fire came out from the presence of the lord and actually consumed the burnt offering in the fat portions of the altar and when everybody saw it they shouted for joy and they fell face downward what about you joshua what happened when you saw the captain of the army of the lord with the sword drawn and he said well i tell you when i saw him i fell on my face and i worshiped him and what about humanoid when the angel lord told you about your son samson and how he would be born he said yeah we offered a kid a goat kid with a meat offering and we offered it up on a rock and the angel of the lord did wondrously and a flame of fire went up toward heaven and the angel lord went up in that flame and my wife and i we fell on our faces well solomon what about the priests when the glory of the lord filled the temple well you know he said solomon said well i was praying the prayer of dedication and when i finished praying the fire came down from heaven and it consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the temple so that the priest could not stand the minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord filled the house of god let me just say to this we know when you know that was the old testament temple how much greater is it when the holy ghost comes and he fills the temple of the individual and they feel that that's the temple he wanted it was never a building of stones and precious jewels it was sons and daughters of god what about it when the power of god comes down in our life and transforms it and moves by the holy spirit don't you think that would be rather dynamic too what about you daniel well he said you know i was speaking i was i was there on the uh on the banks of uh and um i heard a man's voice it said gabriel say make this man to understand the vision and gabriel came near me and i was afraid and i fell on my face but he said to me understandable son of man for at the end time shall be division and as he was speaking to me i went into a deep sleep on my face on the with on my face on the ground but he touched me and he set me up right but let me tell you another time another time i was standing on the bank of the tigris and i looked and there was a man that was dressed in linen he had a belt of fine gold of eu flies upon around his waist and his body was like topaz kind of a yellowish green and his face was like lightning and his eyes was like flaming torches and his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze and his voice like the sound of a multitude and he said i was the only one that saw the vision the rest around me didn't see me but such terror fell upon the rest of them it overwhelmed them and they fled and they hid themselves but me i was left alone i was gazing at this great vision and i had no strength left and my face turned deathly pale and i was helpless and i heard him speaking and as i listened to him i fell into a deep sleep my face to the ground these are pretty awesome experiences with the almighty what about you ezekiel well i saw him like the appearance of a bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain it was uh the appearance of brightness all around such appearance as the likeness of the glory of the lord and when i saw it i fell on my face and i heard the voice of one speaking well all of that's old testament well when peter james and john saw moses and elijah and jesus glorified and heard a voice from heaven declaring that jesus was his beloved son saying here you him they fell on their face what about you paul well i was on the road to damascus it wasn't really a spiritual time for me i was going along i was threatening to kill everybody that believed in the name of jesus and as i was riding along on my horse said i there was suddenly a light from heaven flashed around me and fallen to the ground i heard a voice saying saul saul why are you persecuting me and i said who are you lord and he said i am jesus whom you're persecuting well what about you john did you have an experience that you could talk about yeah i heard the voice of one there and i turned to look and see and i i saw seven golden candlesticks and these lampstands standing in the middle of those lampstands was one like the son of man he was clothed with a long robe and a golden sash around his chest and his hairs of his head they were white like wool watched snow and his eyes was like a flame of fire his feet was like burnished bronze and and refined in the furnace and i and his voice was like the sound of many waters and in his right hand there was seven stars and from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword and his face was like the sun shining in full strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand on me and he said these words fear not i am the first and the last i am the living one i've died but behold i am alive forevermore and i've got the keys of death and of health now let me just tell you brother branham often spoke of this happening in their wesleyan revival where men were so overwhelmed by their need of god and and they they fell sometimes senseless to the ground and they would throw water upon them to revive them and he never condemned it he always said it was of god and i just want to say what's wrong with having an experience that is so profound and so real that you fall at his feet is dead what is wrong with having an experience that you can feel that you can that you can know that you can walk away say i know i met him i no it was not an illusion it was not an imagination it was real [Applause] well someone say i i know someone had experience like that and was never converted and became ranked center yep that's true i know some who just accepted the message and claimed the holy ghost and became rank sinners too no emotion is not the holy ghost but the holy ghost does what make one emotional we often fear becoming like a pentecostal and instead we become a formal baptiser presbyterian or episcopalian and so as we would see jesus brother branham said philip after he was converted he was all in twos and any man when he finds jesus and gets saved there's an enthusiasm oh i wish i could give that to men like jack shuler and billy graham both of them he said at times that they were messengers to sodom and those those who great evangelists who god is using and the people who profess to come are too starchy he was seeing them come to the altar too starchy they just seem to say yes well i believe and what is that it is an intellectual conception but that won't work you've got to be born again and when you're born there's an enthusiasm rises with that birth and sets the soul of fire and takes all the differences away in isms and comes straight to calvary recognizes christ with a burning love and seal for the lost and fallen world new birth is an experience this was an experience that abraham was having it types the holy ghost you watched brother branham in all of his ministry he said this is abraham living out chipping the coming of the holy ghost what it does now we've been told through abraham's journey that he walked with god that's the progression we saw him like a heathen you know like the rest of the world but called out by god and began to walk with him and that was justification in that divine call later we saw him where he come to the altar and was sanctified by the blood and and here at 99 you would think the journey is now complete it's all over with he's too old it's he's beyond anything else there's no more progression there's no more furtherness of it but now he is just now about to fulfill his real purpose and here god reveals himself as almighty god el shaddai and so in genesis 17 1 we saw when he was abram was 99 years old the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty i am el shaddai and and this word el shaddai almighty god is in the hebrew it comes from a root word meaning breast this is a type of the holy ghost so he's saying i am the breasted god i am the life giver i am the strength giver you're 99 years old but you're just a baby to hey me you're you're thinking you're you're too old to receive it you're too old to get healed you're too old for a miracle you can never get too old for a miracle oh man i always remember bill dowell who's past 90 and god raised him up there to shake brother at brennan's hand in front of the blue blue boy restaurant by vision he saw him coming there are you with me amen and he walked step by step in his healing until he stepped into that vision and he would live 90 years old and live many many years after that you're never too old and you're not too young i was five when i gave my heart to the lord you're not too young now again this word almighty god is this hebrew word that comes from el shaddai or el shaddai come and from that comes the breast this is our age where god is revealing himself right now even as el shaddai when sarah who is in his past bearing brings forth a child and and abraham whose body is now dead i want you to notice it's going to take a resurrection life sarah her womb is dead abraham the body the bible said his body is now dead amen and and so in type he is born again by receiving the holy ghost and this again is where his faith begins it really begins his faith yes he had faith before but now it comes to a new level operating in the holy ghost now abraham was not not expecting a son by sarah he was that wasn't furthest thing out of his mind you know he was satisfied and he was happy with his son by hagar are you with me as far as he was concerned the promised son had come you know abraham's faith had to be resurrected amen it had to have a restart a renewing and his heart had to be turned toward the promise are you with me now now here when median el shaddai he would receive a restored faith he would be required to believe in the miraculous a dead womb a dead seed a dead promise a dead faith a dead church is being brought to life its resurrection power at work this is the baptism of the holy ghost this is the fullness of god coming into an individual amen it's more than a sanctification which cleanse your vessel it's more than a justification that declared too worthy to receive it it's more than that it is god coming down and living in tabernacle himself in the individual in this we're also seeing the coming of the lord he has come in the fullness of his word because of the opening of the seven seals that opened to us the truths of the book that would been once mysteries that were covered up and left in obscurity partial truths were known but this was a restoration to the fullness of the truth and because of this you know because of the misconceptions of the past down through time you know then then we we it required that god would send a message that the first part of his coming would be to a prophet now he wouldn't come in his fullness and dwell that prophet no he was not the fullness of the godhead bodily and never will be don't ever get that in mind we're not deifying the man the word was just coming to a prophet but that word was god are you with me amen it was a mighty shout of the archangel coming through the voice of a man oh yeah in that there was many things like brother branham would say you got to realize there's a human part you got to realize i'm a man you got to realize you know this comes in progression and revelation unfolding itself and and i might have said one thing back here but now you know understanding has come light is shown on this amen now but this is part of his coming is christ returning in the form of his word amen it's working in human beings and showing the signs that he promised but now i want you to notice there's something about his face we saw this when john fell at his feet but if you'll turn with me to revelation 10 1 he said and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven in his clothes with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head and i want to focus on this and his face and his face was as it were the sun his face was out as it was the sun with this mighty angel the full word come because his face his countenance was as the sun now light is being shown on things that had never been seen before this is the light that zechariah prophesied of it shall be light in the evening time and that light was now shining on the book the word the bible come on amen and it was causing it to be open a book whose mysteries were sealed and his contents could not be understood amen but but now his face shines upon it and when it does it becomes opened light shines upon things that were not understood people are claiming the opening of the word yet much of it is closed to them amen they closed the door mercy sealing up and shutting down divine healing miracles the holy ghost now jesus spoke a woe against the religious men of that day and it applies to this day whoa do you scribes and pharisees it's a whoa amen great what sorrow awaits you that's what it means when he says whoa hey man it's not woe like stop it's w-o-e like great sorrow great sorrow is coming upon you for you shut the door of the kingdom of heaven and people's faces and you won't go in yourself and you won't let others go in either now when the book was opened to john he saw his name in the promise and it caused the emotions to rise and ring up praises to the lamb who who opened the seals now the open of the word causes the word to live that's what it does it brings light upon it and when it's illuminated it has to be manifested amen and it opens up a fountain of living water amen a bountiful supply of the holy ghost amen now you cannot turn the message into a stagnated cistern where we just store up our creeds and dogmas and revivals of the past amen but you see you know even good fresh water will become stagnant if left in a cistern amen and that's what we've done we've tried to denominate the message and it becomes stagnant it didn't become a living water it became a stagnant pool and we take truths together and let it become dirty old unfit for drinking we had an old cistern down at a farm we had the well would always run dry so they had a cistern on an old farm and playing teelan when i was a kid we spent six years six months there when i was a boy and lived there for time as i told you my family was always preppers before preppers were popular we stored up food for the and we got prepared for the missile crisis and down down and and um that castro was causing and all the other things we you know it was there you know in the cistern you you would have to take a rag and strain the water in order to get you know the bugs out of it the wiggle tales amen it was leftovers from the a revival and that's a way that people many have done the message and many churches are only sisters and many of them are broken sisters that the revival is leaked out years ago because they forsook the fountain of living waters i want you to know that when the the word opens up it is a life given flow and it's a bountiful supply and it's pure and it's clean and it's free of wiggle tails and the dust of the past and the washing of dirty lives now brother bradham told us in december 1963 what we need today is an opening of the word that lives and then he says and he's the same yesterday today and forever he cannot fail they call it mental telepathy they call it whatever they want to or spiritual sort of devil as long as that word is flowing free and producing exactly what it said it would do it's a fountain in the house of david again back in bethlehem where that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever to his bethlehem dwellers live with it live in it it's a life journeying water for us as israel had hallelujah what a promise that is now this is el said i and here he is you're bringing forth a church born of the supernatural we've had ishmael that was born of the bonds woman and man's strength but this is a supernatural church a supernatural people a super race hallelujah amen these this is one born of the spoken word of god this is one that is born of a supernatural work of an appearance of the almighty romans 4 19 says being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of sarah's womb and he staggered not i love these words he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith oh to be a people strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded amen that what do you promise he was also able to perform it oh that there would be a people who has met its el shaddai and their faith becomes a faith like this that they are fully persuaded nothing can change their mind a doctor's report can't change their mind circumstances symptoms cannot change their mind what the internet says cannot change their mind amen they've staggered out at the promise of god through unbelief but are strong in faith fully persuaded amen that what do you promise he's also able to perform it [Applause] hallelujah that is the kind of people the holy ghost produces that is the people of el shaddai that is the people who have received that appearance [Applause] that becomes so really fell to the ground i'm not in any way trying to get some emotion started or falling out that ain't what i'm trying to do i'm trying to tell you the experience is real profound life-changing shattering it has to be supernatural abram's body is dead sarah's womb is dead why why is he able to believe and not disbelieve or stagger at the promise why how is he with a dead body and so with the dead womb able to be strong in faith look there you look at the circumstances it's dead it's impossible you know but what is he doing you know how is he able to do this he is drinking and receiving life from el shaddai amen in type he is receiving the baptism of the holy ghost and it's a river of living water amen and it keeps flushing out unbelief it keeps pushing out doubt amen you can throw the gossip of unbelief adam and it pushes it out i don't hear it i won't receive it i don't believe it i believe what god's word said amen what god said is true and i believe it he's strong in the faith giving glory to god do you notice this if you have faith you're going to give glory to god amen when your faith is complete and you know you receive the holy ghost it causes you to give glory to god look what happened in the book of acts every time it did they spoke in other tongues glorifying god amen amen they spoke in other languages but they heard them and what were they doing glorifying god more than just coming out of your mouth it'll start coming out of your life hallelujah your life will glorify him your life will declare he's my god he's my lord he's my king there is no other about no other name but the name of jesus i will bow to the pressure of peer pressure i won't bow to the pressure of the world i will not bow to the presser of hollywood amen i will not bow to those who say they disbelieve the sign i will not bow to them i will not give them time i have no time for them flesh out unbelief in the faith easy the devil wants to cut off our praise when we drink from el shaddai when you really get the holy ghost it's going to bring a praise out of your life it makes the hallelujahs rule and it don't just happen in church but it does happen in church amen even when you hear the songs assigned when you see when you see the word going forth it causes the hallelujahs to begin to roll and thank you jesus and i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them it's a sign that the resurrection is already working and how can it be a sign without a voice it must be the voice of the resurrected if it's the resurrection it must give voice amen now it's more than just receiving a message as luther and wesley did and then becoming the voice of a denomination there has been bride's brides in churches churches and but there must come one who is the word not a partial word but the fullness of the word the word made flesh dwelling here with resurrection life and resurrection power and give voice to the word now brother branham tells us in trying to do god a service without his will he said it's right at the end of the church age where they got things ecclesiastical has got so messed up until god sends a messenger and that's the message to that church age and then they take his message i want you to watch this what's the matter because he lives just for a little while and god then when they they take his message instead of carrying on with the rest of it they make a denomination you see they stop with the man and don't go on with his message they make a personality cult out of the man and don't follow his message are you with me amen so they make a denomination and so another messenger comes so it's been the cycle just like that by the way we just passed where brother bratton's been gone longer than he was here his birthday would have been a 113 years old and so that's 57 years he he lived only 56. but then he says you seen in my book be drawn out in the seven church ages where he told me and i stand by it as i stand by as a witness to god to be judged at the day of judgment for it this is a good one on the church age book listen to this you've seen it in my book it'll all be drawn out in the seven church ages which he told me i which i stand by as a witness to god to be judged at the day of judgment it come from god not from my thinking notice here i thought different from that and he said if i was going to have my thought like brother jack told me about the angel there the the one was with white wig he said he said that was christ and the glorified body but it wasn't it was showing the message being right the supreme deity he was god and the very thing i've been preaching from the word the word always bears what the record of the word now so the message of malachi 4 then brings us to the birth of the word for it turns to heart notice the others make a tradition of the messenger's life but there's some that go on with the message and so it is from that word a people comes that are born of that word and where the word is made flesh in their flesh and i want you to get this today if you don't get anything because we're talking about the holy ghost but a constant refilling from el shaddai is so needed it's not a drink of wine and done it's not a sip a man it has to be an everyday event continually like a baby nursing street from its mother amen god has opened unsealed his breast to us opening up the scripture of both breasts both old and new testament listen he doesn't do it to the world he doesn't do it publicly he does it to a chosen people it is only to them the book is unsealed the rest of them is still sealed it's still closed up they will never see it open but for you it has been open and because it's been opened you have an access to everlasting ever flowing all the time life you see old in the new testament every type of the bible being manifested you see how else could abraham be strong in the faith and not consider this that his body was now dead in the sarah's womb he wasn't thinking on that he wasn't allowing that to sit on the throne of his of his mind somebody help me he wasn't allowing listen if you are you got cancer and you allow yourself to dwell on my cancer for the first thing it shouldn't be yours [Applause] and the second thing you shouldn't be dwelling on it you should be looking at the promises confessing the promises amen stagger not at the promises strong in the faith giving praise to god every time your mind goes to the sickness you go back to praise again thank you jesus for healing me thank you lord for saving me thank you lord for your report the doctor's report wasn't good but your report and i believe because you're looking for somebody that i believe you're my report joy he was wounded for my transgression bruised for my iniquity the weapons i should have got amen because i didn't pray enough and i didn't fast enough and i didn't read the bible enough and i've never done nothing enough and i can't be enough but i'm drinking from one who is more than enough he had to believe for resurrection life sarah's womb was dead he had to believe the resurrection life for himself his body was dead somebody got to start believing for resurrection somebody's got to start believing for a new body somebody's got to start preparing and getting ready dressing himself in the word for a wedding yeah come on somebody amen you see he had to believe in resurrection life and how could he do that being weak in faith that was rapturing body changing faith that was coming from the holy ghost don't hang up on me that's right i'm not through and i'm fixing the value back in listen to me you dropped the call this was rapturing body changing faith and it was coming from the holy ghost but how could it be strong in the face of a dead body on a dead wound how could he be strong enough to consider not or to consider what was that he did not consider what was dead he did not consider his dead parts he considered what el shaddai promised you see he drank continually on the promises of god this was the holy ghost a well of living water what good does it have abundance of water if you drink one time and that's it come on now amen it's a water it's a well of living water a constant refreshing and we're not a revival in youth camp and we've got to wait another year for another revival or we got to wait till the october meetings or a special youth service but a continual reviving [Music] hallelujah living in the holy ghost not just one service and and we go to we go and we have another good service after after ohio camp or after oklahoma camp and we we have that but now we but we we come again and we have a another good service and then we just kind of let things die down down down down it is refreshing and it is to be continual his body was now dead but his spirit was a living spirit a life within him that drove back death that drove back doubts that drove back fear the holy ghost is far a constant and a continual communion we must go back again and again for refreshing if you can want to be refreshed on this subject just go back to the sermon i preached on the the passover you remember that one hey man if you don't know it i'll get the link to for you because you know it's it is something that we live we are to have communion forever again it's not one and done it's not even once a week it's not even it's not even twice a week when we come sunday and wednesday it's a praying people amen you know this this is going way over your head it's a praying people amen it's a praying people constantly pulling on the promise amen not a prayer of god help johnny today and be with susie it's where your soul comes up in the presence of god and you just bathe down in his presence it's praying until the holy ghost comes and you begin to pray in the spirit we're the supernatural begins to happen this is not to be one and done this is not to be once a week this is not to be once a month this is to be every day pulling from el shaddai you pray in the spirit until the supernatural comes you pray in the spirit and that's where the supernatural comes it's now look it's always mechanical at first amen come on brother always it's always mechanical at first look when i when i preach you know you know we we always start out in the mechanical we do you you you could call it also in the flesh people were worried about being in the flesh you came here in the flesh you probably leave here in the flesh but you see when you're preaching you just keep yielding you know you we we start out in the flesh and we pray we ask for god's spirit and we feel a little tug there and then we read the bible and something strikes us there it's still mechanical we keep yielding and soon the anointing drops down and the holy spirit takes over and something happens and you you must you see you you begin to say things you never dreamed of saying if words come out of your mouth it flows as prophecy amen the spirit is speaking to the church but it starts out mechanical same thing happens you start out mechanical in prayers the problem with too many of you your prayers start and end mechanically you must pray in the spirit you start mechanically until he comes that's when you're really drinking from our shadow that's when life starts flowing from the holy ghost into you where you start praying in the holy ghost now and it is the rising of the sun brother branham said mechanic and the mechanics by going in notice by going in mechanics and the dynamics come from above holy spirit and then catch them away lord quicken their mortal bodies then we will hear genuine new tongues powers of god love and told dying grace and living grace and a resurrected christ a body of bride representing him on the earth that's what it means when you when you start mechanically but then the dynamics come from above the holy spirit and catches you away and then it quickens your mortal body amen then you hear genuine new tongues powers of god love and told dying grace grace to die by and grace to live by about a resurrected christ a body a bride representing himself on the earth brother branham explained it this way when he went out to pray for georgie carter you remember he was he felt a burden come upon him have you ever felt burdened i don't mean your troubles burdened you and you couldn't pay this bill in your burden i'm talking about signing crying because of the sins in the city and their country and all around you that sin made you so sick you sighed and cried over it you wept brother branham told us in 1964 that's the evidence of the sealing of the holy ghost it causes you to sigh and cry it puts a burden within your heart see somebody else saved oh god don't let them be lost he went to pray for george carter went up to on the hill and he said i started to kneel down and the green briars was cutting me so i moved a little further and it got so rough on the ground that the rocks was hurting me and i couldn't get comfortable and so i went around to the side the heel and it was leaning sideways and you know the devil was just trying to keep me from getting the blessing he said that's all it was and then i climbed up a little farther into the ticket and i knelt down the mosquitoes was just humming all around my ears and i could hardly pray and i believed then it was the devil so i said oh lord god be merciful and just threw up my hands and started praying anyhow and just let the mosquitoes fill up if they wanted to but but there was something burned my heart and after after i become so lost in prayer this is nursing from thou shalt i yes this is getting strength instruction life from the holy ghost amen i became so lost in prayer i guess you christians know what it means to be lost in prayer and just forget where you are that's praying in the spirit you just closed your book walked outside didn't want to hear that did you well i got some more when the spirit is moving the church that's another time to drink from el shaddai the holy ghost a lot of people will sit there and watch what's going on and say oh don't that look silly and oh that's nice they're getting a blessing instead of entering in and receiving something from god themselves you needed just as much as they needed it you old truck how hide amen you need the holy ghost and it ought to be in every oh the church we are eagles and when the eagles feed the blood swells they don't eat on denicarion they eat on something with life in it and when they eat the blood flows it gets all over them everybody can see that's what every church service ought to be like that's what your prayer life ought to be like that's what your life your daily life ought to be like this is not one and done you are nursing from the shut eye and you're going to nurse on it till you're changed your faith is going to go from faith to faith the level your faith is you'll never take a rapture your faith has got to be elevated i i i know you you didn't like that slap but i have to say it very plain to you you're going to have to drink and drink and drink my sister delores said bill when the power was in the church i felt like i could just fall away and then everybody the holy ghost began to fail on person one person i just sat and looked around and he said now the law of sin and death works in your flesh you always have it the law of the spirit of life works in your heart so your heart your spirit and your heart will make your body obey what it says to do and that's exactly right paul said always the flesh i'm too tired i'm unable i'm not sufficient i can't do it i said dolores they i said to delores has been talking to me about the holy ghost and she said what made me feel that way just at the time i should have felt good he said the devil he seen you just about ready to receive it and said i'll put a damper on her and fan her a little bit and cool her off cool her down a little he said but that's when you rise and you claim your god-given rights [Applause] amen that's what paul said when i would do good evil as present and your flesh will always say oh i'm too tired i'm too weary oh that's not for me i i don't want to look like that i don't i don't want the spear to get all over me like that your flesh will always say and give every kind of excuse but you got to realize that's the devil and press it [Applause] and make your flesh obey god see you have to press through to the holy ghost when a baby nurses it stimulates the flow you know that even the cry will cause the milk to come down dude you got it and then you can drink of the water of life freely you know i i was a dairy farmer for years and milking goats you know i always said you know god gave us goat milk i don't drink it now because it's not available but i said if god intended us to milk a cow to give us four hands but you know with the goat when you bring him in or any animal today the dairy cow it doesn't matter you have to stimulate the animal for the milk to come down all right so we would we would begin with washing with warm water and and massaging the udder and first thing you know you'd feel it come down because before that you got a little squirt a little drip here there but then when it comes brother you can milk because the flow was free now let me just say you know god's not a goat or a milk cow but you're gonna have to stimulate the flow even a cry from a saint of god will cause his breath to let down nourishment life amen it will you must nourish until the stimulation makes the dead to come to life again driving out death like israel down in egypt they had to start groaning they had to start travailing the church has to get so sick of sin that they want out of here did you hear what i said the church is going to have to get so sick of sin and evil and sodom i wonder if that's what this covet is about you know israel had to get sick of egypt before they would leave come on they had to get sick of where they were in the slave belt and being mistreated they had to get replaced until they groaned because of it this is the bible you sign cry and it's those that are signed and crying i put a seal on them amen that that's the whole thing you know again brother branham told us this very concept and he did it after the seals were open in 63 he said a baby he said you got to be like a baby and cry for it cried if something happens [Music] brother tim i'm afraid it's just flesh you're gonna start out there you're going to bring your old stinkin hide down to the altar and you're going to start out like that but if you just stay like that in the flesh and walk back to your seat it ain't going to have done you a bit of good fact to the moderator diminishes your faith for the next time you go on you get in the spirit you see i wonder if this and if this is what this woke society is about i wonder if companies like disney who use who used to be wholesome family films you know uh now beating at the door in sodom screaming about accepting the transgender the teaching our children to to accept homosexual mentality and and accept their agenda it's sodom knocking at the door i wonder i wonder when it's going to cause when it's going to get enough it's going to cause the bride to start signing and crying [Music] am i moaning and crying and the sealant angel only seals those whose sin makes them sick the rest of them belong to the world brother branham said in voice of the sign israel was waiting on god god was waiting on them he had his prophet out there in the wilderness but he was only waiting for people to call him into action i believe he's got the same thing today waiting for his church to call it on the scene so he can act the promise of today is ready but he's got to get the people to pray and and groaning like they were down there and then it'll come on the scene so he's got to get people there pulling on god stimulating the flow amen are you with me somebody hearing me amen listen now brother brandon said politics voting in and out and saying this and that the other holy spirit has no more right away in the church than nothing no more prayer meetings no more agonizing with god to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is the same still the same yesterday today and forever they just vulgarized down got a denomination put their name on the book god's lazy and soft set back there gloating on some kind of denicarion and then they're supposed to be like as a hawk that's similar to brother to the eagle the brother the prophet that brought the true word and manifested i wonder what is this jedicarian he's talking about what makes something dedicated he's speaking about bible truths i want you to get this he is speaking about bible truths of the reformers that have become stagnant because it no longer lives or manifests its promises that's what a caring is it's bible truths that have been brought that no longer lives but is stagnant and does not manifest his promises that's the same with the truth of this message if we allow it to become stagnant and it not manifest itself you know and showing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever in every detail but his corporal body is dedication and like a bunch of vultures that gather around it gloating because god sent a prophet and become like a slobbering drooling vulture idolizing him instead of manifesting the word i know that's hard and difficult maybe for some to swallow but you see no more prayer made no more agonizing with god to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever they just vulturized down got a denomination the name on the book they got soft and lazy sets back bloating this is 1965. did you hear me this quote is from from his last sermons and the word had been open now for two years with the seals being taken off the book and brother branham isn't there sitting back there gloating about what god did yesterday he was looking for fresh oil of the spirit to make the word live that's what i'm saying this self said eye not a drink from yesterday but a word that's open and alive if this message won't open the blind eyes if this message come on if what we've got if the power we have will not heal the sick but if it will not give a genuine experience to the holy ghost if it will not produce prophecy if it will not produce itself it is dedicated [Applause] a lot of us being fed out and served out don't get mad at me brother branham said this happens they have made and are carrion bait made it dead dead dead rotten meat for buzzards the world falling apart he says just exactly what jesus said when he come down to the earth he said god sent them prophets down to the age and every time that their world system would fall apart their religious system what did you do with him god sent the prophet and you put him in a tomb and then about another generation you wake up and realize that was a prophet and then what do you do you garnish the tomb what do you do make a tradition of his life that's exactly what israel had done had taken the prophet moses made a tradition out of his life and that's the way we do martin luther oh john wesley other men were always looking back see those things and you make a tradition of their life and garnish the tombs of them and their message was for another day by the time you wake up well that day's done live by and we're in another day and the whole system has worked that way since the beginning man-made systems and that's how a message from god becomes carrion dead rotten is when it becomes just a tradition when what you have becomes stagnant and doesn't live when you lack a buzzard sit gloating over the past god used to heal but not now you see it just ain't the same as it was back there what jesus is amen when they you know god used to heal in the past but not now when they got the holy ghost they shouted they spoke in tongues that glorified god but not now that's not how we get it today you know what god used to move in prayer lines but not now we're the bride we don't need prayer lines anymore you're bribed for a buzzard you're certainly not an eagle amen oh we don't want to get emotional yeah because what you have no one would ever get excited over here what you got what you're offering nobody would get excited over i mean it's become a tradition it's a form of godliness it's a baptist approach of we believe and we got the holy ghost there's certainly nothing to shout about amen it's carrying there's no healing to it life is going out of it there's no more longer a miracle it's a dead carrion choosing of the bride he said a church member if your church isn't like a bible church like that that measures up to god's qualification of the word which is by the way is a book of acts church get out of it and get into christ amen politics voting in voting out saying this down to the other in other words the pastor going by the opinions of the members can you can you imagine a church actually voted on whether the seventh seal was open can you imagine that why do we need to vote on whether it's open god opened it the devil's trying to close it but god opened it amen yeah yeah brother branham couldn't say things publicly and parts of it was not released until after his death so he would say you know god would not permit me he wouldn't allow him to put out that tape at that time but all the seven seals are open every mystery of god is revealed amen are you with me and the holy ghost the holy spirit has no more right away in the church than nothing so we have church ordered god out of the church i'll let that sink for a moment selah pause and think on this for the butts baby saila pause and think on this well gifts should be in the back room backroom that shows the attitude of preachers toward the gifts of the spirit something that's precious wonderful and real and of god you see their attitude toward them back room they want them in the back room never did brother branham said gifts are to be in the back room amen because the problems he was having in the tabernacle and misuse of gifts in the pentecost arena they interrupt his sermon and their altar calls they said and he said they were to wait on their ministry in an appointed room not a back room by the way where is your appointed room but don't worry about a gift of tongues and interpretation interpretation and interrupting your altar call today you don't have them anymore [Music] what do you got to worry about brother tim have you read all 3 300 quotes that brother branham said about altar called yeah but obviously you haven't well they didn't have them in the bible yeah they didn't have church buildings in the bible or altars in the new testament i thought about new testament churches they didn't have a temple they didn't have altar they didn't have nothing there was there was no church building when when when those three thousand were added to the lord and received the holy ghost from the day of pentecost [Applause] amen now but of those 3 300 quotes he never told us to take the altar out he scolded the churches back then and i quote the old altar was taken to a full fashion mourner's bench was taken out and put down in the basement instead of souls on the altar it was lilies on the altar that's why when i built this church i wanted an altar all the way here and all the way there we use the steps the front everything for an altar amen because because again you say well it's a methodist tradition yep he said that and the methodist did turn it into a plea of well your mother died and she wanted you to come to christ and pull on them from because of some human emotion instead of coming to christ because you realize you're a sinner and you need jesus but before he left us in 1965 in december he says the old fashioned altar calls they're out of style today but god still moves in them can't you feel it moving on you church and it's without sensation i guess but it can be felt can you imagine now that this is true of many churches that follow the message i've been in churches where they took the altar out didn't want nobody snotting and screaming and crying at their altar no but you know when we talk about these things and we talk about even church order and some things like that let me deal with something just for a moment i am still pausing and letting you think you you're only making a law out of what you want to be law you know if you took church order and made it a law and we follow every dot and tittle like you're one to do about the gifts of the spirit sermon leaks are only 30 to 40 minutes and if you're legalistic about it then you turn every preacher into a preacher at and is sermon into a sermon that and the people in the christianettes hello and the holy spirit no longer has the right-of-way in the church because a legalistic system a man orders he stops at 40 minutes oh and where is your bell and there should be a belt said here and when that bell is tapped or either the church bell when it taps on the outside that's dismissing sunday school and when that bell rings that means everything comes to order right there so and where is your sunday school report every teacher dismisses their class comes to the audience out there give the report sunday school report and then dismiss the whole thing and then let all that wants to save for the preaching service be next so it sounds like the preaching service is optional we all know that church order is a guideline it is not a law it never was intended to be a law and but if you're going to make it a law don't make those parts laws that you want law let's apply it across the board every jot never tittle and oh what about the rest of it you're only to have two songs then take the offering read the prayer requests have prayer then a song then the pastor walks out and somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes lay your sermon out so now you can go 45 we stretched it so if you speak for 46 you broke in church order just as much as somebody speaking in tongues has broken it and if you have four songs you have broke church order just as much as somebody prophesied and i'm quoting from church order now 1963 and then take your altar call uh-oh uh-oh and take your altar call so if you want to do church order you've got to have altar calls and if anybody here in the church you you say if anybody here in the church would like to sit accept christ's service well a savior we're asking you inviting you to the altar right now just to stand your feet and if no one stands then you say is there anyone that's a candidate for baptism that has already repented and wants to be baptized in water for remission of sins so got to give an invitation for baptism and if they wish to come we're giving you the opportunity now you will you come while the organ is still playing and nobody comes well is there anyone that never received the baptism of the holy ghost and want to do so tonight would you want us to pray for you well i thought just by accepting the message and coming down and accepting the mess and saying brother branham was the prophet we got it what do we need the holy ghost for well somebody comes up then let two or three lay hands on them and pray for them send them right back into one of the rooms and somebody in there instruct them or somewhere to come through with the baptism of the holy ghost the congregation is all away from them but oh we don't have altar calls no neither do you have a back room for the gifts either neither an appointed room because you have made it where the holy spirit can have no more right away through your traditions somebody help me preach now amen i i know i i'm screwing the screwing it down right here and making it tight hammering it in and clenching it hey man maybe i'm laboring on it too much i don't mean to be mean about this i want to be straight about it am i not and because you have done this you have made it where there are no gifts people say well you know they preach against the gifts i say what gifts what are you worried about there hadn't been one in your church for years prophecy has become despised among message churches speaking in tongues forbidden we have done what the apostle paul told us not to do first corinthians 14 39 wherefore brothers covet to prophesy we are a cabinet prophecy amen and forbid not to speak in tongues but let everything be done in decency and order now the bride is the last sign the sign has to have a voice you can only hear what the sign is saying if it has a voice a voice without a sign is a sign with no meaning put a sign out there nothing on it has no meaning amen a sign without a meaning is a sign without purpose if it's then it's a false sign it's thunder without lightning a cloud without water now i'm not railing against the backsliding of the methodists and the baptists and the pentecostal neither am i at all trying to return to zoos of pentecostalism i am railing against messaged churches who are afraid of being pentecostal book of acts believers who deny the power of the gospel deny his power to heal so they deny prayer lines and pretended to be spiritual because now they believe in the third pull of the speaking of the words you see that's how we do it now you know i just wish you would use it well we we don't lay hands now we we got spoken word well use it why are the sick still laying why are the why are the needs not met why aren't you using what you're claiming to have that's something greater and then turn around and deny mark 16 and the great commission i wish you'd use it like i said i've had the miraculous happen when speaking the word absolutely amen but miracles still happen when we lay hands on the sick you can't put god in a box and i happen to be commissioned by jesus christ himself to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen but brother brother tim jesus didn't have prayer lines it's not in the bible you're mistaken or a willful unbeliever if you think that you'd you don't think people lined up to have jesus pray for them really don't deny the obvious if you saw jesus come on praying for the sick open the eyes of the blind and you were crippled would you not get in the line no prayer lines in the bible it's the obvious amen you see besides that all we have to do is remember the thousands of times that brother branham called for altar calls besides that jesus commissioned us to do it listen where did he commit lay hands on the sick they shall recover james 5 says if anybody is sick let them call the elders of the church as the call goes forth amen they shall anoint them with oil a type of the holy ghost anoint them with oil an action to cause a reaction and they in the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise them up and if he's committed sin they shall be forgiven there's a lot of things happen in a prayer line sin is forgiven demons drum out sickness go proving his word brother branham said if we can only see brother sister if you could touch him with that certain touch oh sick people i'm trying to i'm fixing to pray for you just in a few minutes i do believe i have the holy spirit no more holy spirit than you have right here out got out there these men have got here i don't have more holy ghost than you got hallelujah i'm here today and i have as much holy ghost as brother branham had he said i did he said i don't have more than you you got as much as me and that goes forever brother sister every young person everyone that's got it amen oh if you can only realize just one touch of god he don't have no well heavy spots a little weak spot one touch of god is omnipotent [Applause] hallelujah these the same holy spirit but it's a commandment of god and if you believe that to be the commandment of god of praying for the sick and laying hands on them and casting out evil spirits and the promises he has made it'll be the same with you you'll get what you ask for if you can believe it commissioned by god can't stop believe i'm able to do this jesus said to jairus remember he's a secret believer afraid afraid somebody would find out he really believed that jesus was a messiah yeah lord i believe and the man with the child with the epilepsy said i believe you are the son of god that's come in the world oh now that they that can come only take that attitude to bring the results that attitude is what it takes the attitude amen if you can set an attitude while i'm preaching the word you could be healed while i'm preaching the word you can receive the holy ghost hey man you know what when i was listening when when sister atlanta there was sitting up there in the mezzanine sick after taking chemo lost all her hair sitting back there with a mask on because of immune um what do you call it depressed immunity anyway she's sitting back there heard me preach about a bible god a bible jesus a bible promise and we're bible days and we've got a bible god who does bible healings and bible miracles hallelujah and as i was preaching now that word settled down in her heart and there i see we begin to sing leaning on the everlasting arm up she jumped and run around the building healed by the glory of god what was it while peter spoke these words the holy ghost came on them but it was not without sensation or emotion for they spoke in tongues and prophesied they don't like to read the rest of that there was a reaction there was a strength come from el shaddai there was something happened now quickly think of him a moment here he's on his road up little priest come down no doubt little fellow was a borderline believer there's many of them in the world today little born again borderline believers they want to believe that they want to believe the holy ghost is real they want to believe that this is the apostolic move as god promised in the last days he'll pour out his spirit he wants to believe malachi 4 they promised the last day the original pentecost of faith would be restored back to the church again we got to have a message and bring the people out of these denominational conditions back to the original genuine pentecostal faith and we're seeing it done it's fulfilling a scripture and that has to come all scriptures must be fulfilled so jesus commanded us to pray for the sick and lay hands on them i don't care what you say out there we're going to have a prayer line at youth camp all your criticism oh you're calling it pentecostalism it ain't going to stop it we're going to have all to toss we're going to see the power of god move we're going to see the holy ghost get down i don't care what you say you don't stop me one bit i don't listen to the gospel of unbelief remember but i'm strong in the faith am i praising god already forever miracle ever healing ever delivered every salvation everyone filled with the holy ghost and the power of god hallelujah and said hallelujah praise the lord so if jesus commanded us to pray for the sick and lay hands on them and more one more than one comes that's a line a prayer line a line of people coming from prayer so why deny the people of god the rights to the blessings of god why do we want to be that backslid in message churches that deny the obvious of god and the commission he gave us god has equipped us for every battle we have got to take the limits off of god oh god help me i could preach three hours today thank you i hope you could say that at the end of three hours god has equipped us for every battle we've got to take the limits off of god abraham staggered not at the promise of god was but was strong in the faith oh the bible says in psalm 78 40 how often they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yay and turn back and tempted god and limited and limited and limited the holy one of israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy how he wrote his signs in egypt his wonders in the fields of sowing and turn their rivers in the blood and their floods that they could not drink and he goes on and on and on telling what god did and what god did but in the time of testing they forgot and limited the holy one of israel we're being tested too this is testing time and we've got to take the limits off of god watch tiger at the promise why not do like abraham and give praise to god oh you can hear sarah you can see her sarah thinking you know she laughs at it she just at first it's just funny it's just so ridiculous it's funny she just kind of giggles at it you know when she hears about it when elohim stands right there and begins to call her by name tell her you know that she's going to have a child about this time of year you're going to bring forth a child it's too hard to believe right why abraham and i have been dead for years now so as the church it's too impossible well my breasts could never get milk i don't have the strength to carry a baby much less birth one the power is gone we haven't had revival in years besides that their quotes it says revival is over that was the healing revival but the bride's revival is still on come on church brother branham told us in the invisible union right before he leaves us he said to move his own for the pride that's just saith the lord amen hallelujah he said it there in birth pains he said they say you can't have an old holy ghost revival he said you can have one in yourself my breasts can never get milk i just don't have the strength i the power is gone i don't have faith for that i mean goodness gracious you know i once believed i could but no you know a long time ago i gave up on that and then i gave over to the bonds woman and they said let her do it that's the way we want it today we want the bombs well it's okay for them to have a miracle it's okay for them to have their prayer answer it's okay for an angel to appear to hey guard ishmael but we're we're past all of that we're we're too we're too frail to believe brother ron said something about an angel lord in this in there and a woman comes to your pastor and said i don't believe in angels of god now that only happened in brother branham's ministry we got the word we got ishmael we got the word we got the word of promise that's ishmael all the promises already been fulfilled it's too hard to believe we gave up a long time ago thinking we can have an experience with god this is impossible power of god living on us till we speak in other tongues why 99 of message believers have never had a supernatural experience like that we put that out along we grew past that we're we're beyond now the desire for the supernatural is long gone abraham and i we don't even have a love affair anymore there there's no pleasure with my lord we we're just content with the child of the bones woman and just going to church and believing the message and saying brother branham's a prophet and that's all we know about the holy ghost i'm too old well i could never feel a baby kick i i couldn't put up with that disturbing me jumping and dancing and shouting in my womb my nerves are shot i don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures why the noise of that makes me nervous an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god that would upset church order here granny i'm too set in my ways by now it might keep me up at night praying a baby like that might just keep me up at night praying it might turn my church into an all-night prayer meeting and i gotta re-run on television program on youtube to watch tonight a true modern picture amid a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church want any of these screaming shouting tongues speaking acts 2 38 youngins around her yeah yeah yeah she don't want any of them hooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah i'm too old for that we don't know mention around here goodness knowing jesus the promised son is ushered out of his own church and they fulfill the prophecy of revelation 3 with him knocking trying to get in and he finally has to say get out of there he considered not his body now dead nor the deadness of sarah's womb her name i want you to get this her name had been associated with baroness a long time that barren woman that's not your name anymore sarah i'm talking to you barren woman is not your name anymore hallelujah princess is your name mother of a new race amen a mother of a supernatural child who didn't come from my husband's strength but from resurrection power amen our name isn't barren anymore we are not the mother of stillborn babies who claim the message and their lives are still dead in sins amen while in israel you remember we couldn't go to the golan heights when we visited there timothy and i brother donnie rage and some others mike walls was there kind of organized it for us we couldn't go to the golan heights and so as a surprise our guide took us to shiloh and in shiloh i prayed specifically for women in our church sister karen and i bought each of them a token from shiloh in a commemoration of that prayer i prayed i wept we were a group of ministers men and women some of their wives and some single people but we were there and we prayed they asked me to pray i was so broke and so moved by the moment of hannah's prayer being answered and i thought i thought of the needs that we had my daughter bethany who wanted another child who suffered four miscarriages one after another and today we got little brook our beautiful little princess then there was candace who was barren i called her name at silo and when brother bro ron preached if you remember he was preaching take it back you remember he said to brother brother andrew as he passed by and said the baby's coming it's coming and dead seed came to life hallelujah and today we have baby abigail elise chestnut abigail means calls of joy father's joy is the hebrew name and elise means god's promise god's promise brings a father's joy hallelujah what a cause of joy i'm telling you what a cause of joy amen god said to abraham name your son isaac laughter name him laughter i don't believe that god was punishing abraham to name your son laughter cause you fell on your face and laughed and the and sarah laughed i don't believe it because she giggled and laughed because it was a ridiculous promise of an old woman having pleasure with her husband again i believe it was because god had made them to life at the fulfillment of the promise god had brought a promise to pass hallelujah they could laugh at the devil come on now who said it would never happen who said god ain't big enough hallelujah but they didn't know the power of the milk the light seeds and milk or they'll set eye hallelujah they didn't know about when they received that milk it would bring resurrection life oh i can think of the scarners when i'm got on our youtube page and left a comment well well big name preachers i don't know who that is because mine's a short name tim three letters big name preachers and i ain't very big so big-name preachers rejoicing over pentecostal songs you're milk drinkers brother tim and we are meat eaters you see we're meat eaters and you're milk makers well i guess if that's stronger than milk you should be doing greater exploits than those who drink milk [Music] so where's the proof of your meat amen but what you're doing is mixing tights you got to keep tights in running in the right direction you cannot mix types in one type we eat meat and another type we drink milk in this type of el shaddai abraham is a mature 99

[Music] hallelujah it's god and his people it's god working in his church it's a people who are [Music] touched by el shaddai and drinking from him and faith comes into him walk down here david dexter my wife was here i'd call her for god healing the blind eyes but she got better eyes now over in another land the greater healing this man right here went on a cruise got some kind of problem emergency situation in his eyes they went there to try to determine what it was nothing worked he went over 30 times the specialist this report he sat there looking around at all the other clients that was waiting on the doctor and he said i was the youngest they had several people with serious eye problems people recovering from surgery so then there was me i looked normal others had bandages patches some visible way they could see them the specialist ran several tests on his eyes did a real cool looking 3d scan of his cornea but they couldn't find anything when he scanned the corner he saw some kind of scarring it was like his body had fought off some kind of virus he went for blood work it was tested for seven different time things he tested positive for an immune disorder a genetic immune disorder that attacks the body h l a b 27 just a name for a devil my doctors worry that a very high percentage of people with [Music] and click locate spun diatitis a kind of degenerating spinal issue how this protein is found in your white blood cells it's when you're if it's out of whack your immune system literally starts attacking your own body the scar in the body and in the eye that felt was coming from that he went to pick up his prescription and mending at walgreens the pharmacist come over and say what's wrong with you and then proceeded to tell him there's only one other person in town that's on this stronger prescription they're losing their hair the skin pigment and it was just the medicines just slowing down their inevitable early death and he said what a faith booster that was so he said to a rheumatologist who did x-rays and joint tests they came back clean he said well they're clean now but with your reoccurring i arrived that inflammation of the cornea in the presence of that hla b27 you'll have to come back every year from here on out so it went over 30 times to different times to different specialists and the end and so right before youth camp he started backing off the medicine a little bit he went to the prayer line at youth camp with a prayer cloth that was sent to him by his dad that he would place over his eyes and he's really struggled to find faith and he felt an unknown cause that he let this unknown cause cause him entirely too much worry and then the specialist began to hone in on what he believed was root cause finding it might be genetic didn't help at all so he got that prayer cloth he got to thinking about his heritage i think we ought to think about our heritage about what god's done in our generation and my heritage of faith it was like he reached the lowest point and it was uphill from there it went through the prayer line for healing after youth camp he testified i'm healed he still had eye issues on and off he could actually feel the ironite is coming and he would he would pop a bunch of ibuprofen pretty quick and it would go away and naughty would just keep getting worse until his eye would turn red he'd have to go back on steroids but one service this is what he testified but there came an end [Music] tell you what that's coming to the end of your problem [Music] church is coming into your barriers esther is coming to the end of your madness are you with me amen is coming to the end of your troubles they're coming in to that cancer the diabetes is all of it just want it after

it happened mezzanine and it happened in the back room where they where they the babies are being diaper changed for the mothers it can happen there but sitting there up up in the up in the top there he heard the voice of god speak to him if you go for prayer you'll be healed and he acted on that walking down for prayer and after the service his eye would drop a little bit but it kept getting better and better now it's been seven years and he's since he's had any pain or symptoms hallelujah hallelujah that's what can happen in the prayer line for sister atlanta it happened while the word went forth come on that meant brother david and healed his eyes no more problems seven years victorious [Music] hallelujah god has called you to laugh to rejoice to thank god hallelujah you don't have
