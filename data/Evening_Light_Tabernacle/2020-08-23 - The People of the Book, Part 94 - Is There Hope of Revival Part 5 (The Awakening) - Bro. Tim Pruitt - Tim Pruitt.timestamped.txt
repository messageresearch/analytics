[34:32] dimension into the dimensions of the
[34:35] unseen
[34:36] [Music]
[34:37] a man who can find whatever the need is

[41:41] god in any rivers
[41:46] you think are uncrossable
[41:54] god any mountains
[41:58] you cannot turn all through
[42:02] but listen this
[42:05] god specializes
[42:10] in things thought impossible
[42:17] and he will do
[42:20] what no other
[42:24] power can do i'm saying it slowly it's a
[42:28] prayer right now god
[42:31] any rivers
[42:34] you think are uncrossable
[42:40] it looks impossible god any mountains
[42:47] you can't turn all through
[42:53] god specializes
[42:58] and things thought impossible
[43:02] [Music]
[43:04] and he will do
[43:09] what no other
[43:12] power can do
[43:16] do you think things are impossible i'll
[43:18] tell you what
[43:19] we had something that looked impossible
[43:23] didn't look like he'd ever get fixed
[43:26] a man that just walked along in life
[43:29] [Music]
[43:31] with a religious spirit on him
[43:36] always living a failure but also very
[43:38] religious
[43:40] but last october in the meeting that
[43:43] evil spirit left him
[43:45] and it's been replaced with something so
[43:48] much better and so much greater
[43:50] and today i'm going to baptize him in
[43:51] the name of the lord jesus christ victor
[43:53] middleton
[43:55] amen god bless you he can do
[43:59] what no other power can do and he can do
[44:02] it for your life today
[44:05] whatever you think is impossible he can
[44:08] do it
[44:08] amen god bless you matthew chapter 8 in
[44:12] verse 23
[44:15] we want to go to this scripture once
[44:17] more
[44:18] and um we're just
[44:22] we just look here matthew 8 verse 23 and
[44:25] then we'll go to zechariah chapter 4 1.
[44:29] but right now matthew 8 23 and
[44:32] when he was entered into a ship his
[44:34] disciples followed him
[44:37] and behold there arose a great tempest
[44:39] in the sea
[44:40] in us so much that the ship was covered
[44:42] with the waves but he was asleep
[44:45] and his disciples came to him and awoke
[44:48] him and saying lord
[44:49] save us we perish and he said unto them
[44:54] why are you fearful o ye of little faith
[44:57] then he arose and rebuked the winds and
[45:00] the sea
[45:00] and there was a great calm but the men
[45:03] marveled saying what manner
[45:05] a man is this that even the winds and
[45:09] the sea
[45:10] obey him and when he was come to the
[45:13] other side into the country of the
[45:15] gerges um there
[45:18] met him too possessed with devils coming
[45:21] out of the tombs exceeding fierce
[45:24] so that no man might pass by that way
[45:28] then zechariah chapter 4
[45:31] verse one we'll read from there and this
[45:34] scripture
[45:34] would come to me along with some other
[45:37] scriptures
[45:38] and about three o'clock in the morning
[45:40] this week which is why
[45:42] i'm taking this subject again and
[45:45] the angel that talked with me came again
[45:48] and waked me as a man that is awakened
[45:52] out of his sleep and he said unto me
[45:54] what seesthal and i said i
[45:57] have looked and behold a candlestick
[45:59] olive gold and a boulder up on the top
[46:02] of it and his seven lamps they're on and
[46:04] seven pipes to the seven lamps which are
[46:06] up on the top thereof and two olive
[46:08] trees buy it
[46:10] one up on the right side of the bowl and
[46:12] the other on the
[46:13] on the left side thereof so i
[46:16] answered and spake to the angel that
[46:19] talked with me saying
[46:20] what are these my lord then the angel
[46:24] that talked with me
[46:25] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[46:28] not
[46:28] what these be and i said no my lord
[46:31] and then he answered and spake unto me
[46:33] and saying
[46:35] this is the word of the lord unto
[46:36] zerubbabel saying
[46:39] not by might nor by power
[46:42] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[46:45] who art thou great mountain before
[46:47] zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain
[46:50] and he shall bring forth the headstones
[46:52] thereof with shoutings crying
[46:54] grace grace unto it
[46:58] amen god bless you you can be seated
[47:01] we're going to speak today on the
[47:03] awakening
[47:05] and we're still continuing the thought
[47:08] of is their hope of revival and we're
[47:11] going to speak on
[47:13] the awakening so as we're looking here
[47:16] in the scripture today as i said the
[47:19] scriptures come
[47:20] to to me and the wee hours of the
[47:23] morning this week
[47:25] and as i was awakened by the spirit of
[47:28] god and
[47:29] he began to deal with my heart and
[47:33] as i have been just combing over
[47:36] some of the very things that the prophet
[47:39] of god
[47:39] said going page by page
[47:43] um you know i i just have
[47:47] taken the the the sermons that i have
[47:50] studied and
[47:50] marked through because um you know i'm
[47:54] someone challenged me and saying you
[47:56] know well
[47:57] what is what you're expecting really
[48:00] what is to happen so i said well you
[48:03] know i'll
[48:04] go back to the prophet's message a man
[48:06] to
[48:07] to see that what i my expectations
[48:10] line up with what a prophet of god said
[48:14] so i've taken you know now all the way
[48:17] from 63 through 65 and just going
[48:20] page by page and combing through and
[48:24] and collecting just little parts and
[48:26] bits and pieces
[48:28] and because i i want to be fine-tuned in
[48:31] this
[48:32] hour i want to be very sensitive to what
[48:34] the lord is doing
[48:36] and to have the right kind of
[48:38] expectations
[48:39] amen because the wrong kind of
[48:42] expectations only
[48:43] bring disappointments now
[48:46] um i came across this little quotation
[48:49] in 65 that brother branham said
[48:52] and does god change his mind ever change
[48:54] his mind about his word and
[48:55] jeffersonville
[48:56] and this was in his prayer as he uh
[48:59] began that sermon
[49:00] and he said dear lord jesus we are
[49:03] assembled again in your name
[49:04] with great expectation for the
[49:08] outpouring of the quickening power of
[49:10] god
[49:11] to bring us into recognition of
[49:14] our position and place and our
[49:17] responsibilities
[49:18] as being a called people separated from
[49:21] the world
[49:22] and dedicated to god
[49:26] now so there again an outpouring of the
[49:29] quickening power
[49:30] we ought to even look for that in this
[49:31] service this morning
[49:33] amen may this not be just another
[49:36] service amen not just be another time i
[49:40] want you to focus
[49:41] in this this could be a very very
[49:43] important time
[49:44] to you today amen and if you don't
[49:47] if you don't focus him i'm going to help
[49:49] you do it
[49:51] amen i'm not going to throw my water
[49:52] bottle at you or don't have some books
[49:54] to do it
[49:55] but i may just come down and speak to
[49:57] you
[49:59] all right amen so you know
[50:02] um as we're just looking at this we want
[50:04] to stay very focused
[50:06] that we can recognize our position where
[50:09] are we at in this time
[50:11] what our place is in our
[50:13] responsibilities
[50:15] now we are living in some very
[50:18] interesting times
[50:20] and looking back over the trail of time
[50:23] i would say there's been a lot of
[50:25] surprises along the journey
[50:28] uh even a lot of disappointments along
[50:30] the journey some things that we could
[50:32] have never
[50:32] imagined and if we ever needed
[50:36] faith it is now amen we
[50:40] we must believe we really have no option
[50:44] and um by our new birth we we were
[50:47] designed
[50:48] to believe and not to doubt
[50:51] and so that's why i'm going to preach
[50:53] today on the awakening
[50:55] that jesus must not no longer just be
[50:58] with us
[50:59] and that be allowed just to sleep on our
[51:02] boat
[51:02] in other words someone that is there and
[51:05] present but he's just
[51:06] you know he is not recognized
[51:10] in in our lives in our midst and he
[51:12] isn't given the place
[51:14] a preeminence that he he deserves
[51:18] amen but he must he must be called
[51:21] into action now we know that jesus
[51:24] of course the the corporal body sits on
[51:27] the throne of god and
[51:28] certainly he is not asleep and he's not
[51:31] he's not
[51:32] comatose and he's not um uh
[51:35] uh unaware of what we're going through
[51:37] or where we're at at this time
[51:39] but he ever lives to make intercession
[51:42] on our behalf
[51:44] so he is cognitive of every bird that
[51:47] falls of every
[51:49] problem that you have of every situation
[51:52] he is cognitive it but we we must do our
[51:55] part
[51:55] to go before the throne of grace and
[51:58] meant to bring
[51:59] that portion of that promise to our own
[52:02] selves
[52:03] and so he he of course is not
[52:07] asleep but sometimes i think on the
[52:10] inside
[52:11] the holy spirit that we have is is
[52:14] sometimes not brought to the forefront
[52:17] of our being as christians and this is
[52:20] what brother branham was talking about
[52:22] when he was saying
[52:23] go away jesus bring him back to the
[52:25] forefront
[52:27] amen bring that holy spirit where that
[52:30] is
[52:30] um uh we know it's alive but where that
[52:34] is awakening and working and that we're
[52:36] we're moved by the spirit instead of
[52:39] operating by the flesh
[52:41] because we are still a two-part being
[52:43] you know we are in that sense we have
[52:45] the holy
[52:46] spirit but yet we're human beings now
[52:49] of course in that when we're looking
[52:52] even in the old testament
[52:53] we found a man in the days of zechariah
[52:57] where an angel came and talked with him
[53:01] and and in his talking with him he
[53:03] awakened him
[53:05] as a man that is waking out of his sleep
[53:09] so he was awakened there um
[53:13] you know they're out of his sleep and
[53:15] brought to realization
[53:17] where that um that uh of uh that there
[53:21] were
[53:21] things that were present that was right
[53:24] there
[53:25] that he would be able to see if he was
[53:27] awakened
[53:29] now i want you to get the idea i mean he
[53:31] was he was
[53:33] awakened to something present
[53:36] and i want you to get this this is what
[53:39] we want to understand there can be an
[53:41] awakening
[53:42] you know to what is already present
[53:46] to what god is doing in this hour
[53:49] now so anyway he says he says
[53:53] this that he looked and he said i saw
[53:55] seven golden lamps and
[53:57] and then he began to hear the voices of
[54:00] god
[54:01] once that he becomes awakened to what he
[54:03] sees
[54:04] then and then then he begins to hear
[54:07] also
[54:08] as you know when you go to sleep your
[54:11] your hearing kind of fades away and
[54:13] and blocks out the sounds and someone
[54:17] when they call you a lot of times you
[54:19] hear them from a way of far distance and
[54:21] it way you know you start gradually
[54:24] coming oh
[54:25] did somebody call me but but it seemed
[54:28] to be
[54:28] something way far away at first
[54:32] and you wake and then to realize uh and
[54:35] become alert
[54:36] someone called me somebody's trying to
[54:37] get my attention
[54:39] and this can be of course the condition
[54:42] of people
[54:43] that you know they they have christ on
[54:47] the inside of them
[54:49] and they have a great faith that is on
[54:51] the inside of them but
[54:52] it lays dormant within them
[54:56] because it is not they are not awakened
[54:59] to it
[55:00] and we want to shaken by the holy spirit
[55:03] today
[55:04] to shake us and make us realize amen
[55:06] that they're
[55:07] somebody present amen somebody this
[55:11] present
[55:12] amen now so amen
[55:17] i believe don't you so right now i just
[55:20] take
[55:20] dominion over every spirit this morning
[55:23] every spirit i'm taking dominion over
[55:26] right now in the name of jesus christ
[55:33] now as we're there talking about this
[55:37] brother branham said what's the matter
[55:40] with the church today
[55:42] so apparently there was something wrong
[55:44] that we would ask that question
[55:47] he said we're full of theology without
[55:49] any dynamics in it
[55:52] in other words you've got to have the
[55:54] spark to the gasoline it's
[55:56] not even as good as water he said as
[55:58] long as it hadn't got the spark
[56:00] to fire it and no matter how well we
[56:02] have been taught and i want to say
[56:04] i think we've been well taught in this
[56:06] message
[56:07] and how well we how well we believe and
[56:10] how much
[56:11] we the bible we say is true and
[56:14] we believe it all to be true and i think
[56:16] that would be all our confession this
[56:18] morning
[56:19] we believe it's right amen it's got to
[56:22] be but the dynamics has to be there to
[56:25] spark
[56:26] to set that word of fire and make it
[56:28] start rolling
[56:30] it's got to have that if you don't the
[56:32] church sits still
[56:33] and the car sits still and you sit still
[56:37] but no matter how much you say i
[56:39] sympathize
[56:40] i believe every word of that you've got
[56:43] to have something to spark
[56:45] that off to make that
[56:48] 100 octane to go to firing
[56:51] and the big church of god to go to
[56:54] moving on
[56:55] it's got to take the dynamics with the
[56:58] mechanics
[56:59] nothing wrong with the mechanics just
[57:01] lacking the dynamics
[57:03] and i think that's what's the matter
[57:05] with the church today i'm still quoting
[57:06] brother branham
[57:07] that we're lacking that dynamical power
[57:11] to press this word and make it live for
[57:14] the day
[57:16] he said martin luther had the mechanics
[57:18] and dynamics of his day
[57:20] in other words he had a message just
[57:22] shall live by faith and it worked
[57:25] amen and he says you know john wesley
[57:28] and them of his day
[57:29] pentecost with their with had them
[57:32] with their day but what about our day
[57:36] this is another time the church
[57:39] should be fully grown now
[57:43] ready to go meet christ with the
[57:45] manifestation
[57:46] of every blessing that he promised in
[57:49] the bible
[57:50] operating in that one great body where
[57:53] he promised
[57:54] that he would meet the people and be
[57:55] worshiped in this great church of his
[57:58] so again the church should be fully
[58:00] grown ready to go meet christ
[58:03] with the manifestation of every blessing
[58:07] amen
[58:09] now again brother branham would have
[58:12] some different things to say
[58:14] about the conditions of this time and
[58:16] this age
[58:18] and the situations where we're at and
[58:20] then in
[58:21] 1964 he said why the church why it ought
[58:25] to be
[58:25] in its most glorious stage right now
[58:29] and the power of his resurrection and
[58:31] great signs and wonders
[58:34] so this is where the church should be i
[58:36] want to say this is where the church
[58:38] is amen we're at that very place
[58:42] where god is wanting to reveal himself
[58:46] amen now again he said in testimony
[58:48] testimonial c
[58:50] he said we find out that miracles isn't
[58:53] taking place
[58:54] no more like they were the sick goes
[58:57] home sick
[58:58] and and he says it isn't because of god
[59:02] it's because the lack of revival among
[59:05] the people
[59:06] so then again if we want it where the
[59:08] sick doesn't go home
[59:10] sick and the needs of the people where
[59:12] miracles aren't taking place anymore
[59:14] then we've got to get back in revival
[59:17] again
[59:18] amen you say but brother tim that's
[59:20] impossible there's no hope of revival
[59:22] but
[59:23] i'm hearing a prophet say something
[59:25] different than what we've been told
[59:27] over and over and over again sure
[59:30] revival is over for america
[59:33] revival there not be another worldwide
[59:35] revival
[59:37] amen even the revival brother rem said
[59:39] that we that his
[59:40] promise he said it'd be so small they
[59:42] won't even know anything about it
[59:45] but i'm just telling you the movie is on
[59:47] for the bride
[59:49] that is thus saith the lord and they
[59:52] say you can't have an old pentecostal
[59:55] old-fashioned pentecostal revival
[59:57] i'm quoting from 1965 easter seal
[1:00:01] i mean he said but he said but you can
[1:00:03] have one in yourself
[1:00:06] so every person can have that revival
[1:00:11] the nation may be gone but you you're
[1:00:14] still here
[1:00:15] you need to be gone you need to leave
[1:00:17] this world
[1:00:19] and you know that the bride of christ
[1:00:21] and i'm quoting brother bratton again
[1:00:23] will by no means be laodicea
[1:00:26] she will not be lukewarm she will be on
[1:00:30] fire for god
[1:00:32] amen and he said because of the lack of
[1:00:36] revival among the people
[1:00:38] there's no revival they just sit and
[1:00:40] listen and go home and say
[1:00:42] well that was pretty good and
[1:00:46] and that's not in and see there's not
[1:00:48] that zeal now i'm just going to tell you
[1:00:51] what i'm preaching today about the
[1:00:52] awakening
[1:00:55] brother branham was telling us there has
[1:00:57] been a rest
[1:00:58] between revivals and he said in this
[1:01:02] rest
[1:01:03] we've gone on a journey and on that
[1:01:06] journey we got jesus in the boat
[1:01:09] but as we're going along the journey
[1:01:12] there's been storms that have come up
[1:01:14] and we have forgot who's in the boat
[1:01:16] with us
[1:01:18] and he's telling us we must wake him
[1:01:22] because he's the only hope of getting
[1:01:26] to the other side now the other side
[1:01:29] we're one to go to is a rapture
[1:01:32] amen amen and we're not just going to
[1:01:36] deliver a few among the tombs all there
[1:01:38] there will be deliverance
[1:01:40] but even all of those that are asleep in
[1:01:43] the tombs
[1:01:44] that are the bride of christ down
[1:01:46] through the seven ages
[1:01:47] are going to rise up out of those tombs
[1:01:50] we're on a journey of a lifetime
[1:01:53] we're on a journey no other age has ever
[1:01:56] been set on
[1:01:58] but jesus has set us on this journey
[1:02:01] hey man and she is in the boat with us
[1:02:05] and his word cannot fail
[1:02:08] amen there will be a rapture in this end
[1:02:10] time
[1:02:11] there will be a resurrection
[1:02:13] [Applause]
[1:02:16] now and let me just tell you the time
[1:02:20] of just sitting there getting a good
[1:02:21] message and going home
[1:02:23] and maintaining what you got is over
[1:02:26] with
[1:02:29] it's time we put to work what we got
[1:02:32] now again in world falling apart
[1:02:36] 63 november it seems like a drying out
[1:02:39] to the churches hardly confined to
[1:02:41] church anymore
[1:02:42] that's alive with the word and with the
[1:02:44] spirit of god and great things taking
[1:02:46] place
[1:02:47] like it was like it was not long ago
[1:02:51] now you may wonder brother jim why are
[1:02:53] you emphasizing this why are you
[1:02:55] preaching like this
[1:02:57] because this rest between revivals
[1:03:02] cannot go on forever
[1:03:05] it's time we start stressing the
[1:03:08] dynamics
[1:03:10] amen i mean you know we have stressed
[1:03:12] the mechanics
[1:03:14] for the last 50 years around the message
[1:03:18] it's time we you know realize hey
[1:03:20] there's another
[1:03:21] wing to this and just with one wing
[1:03:24] flopping around you just flop around in
[1:03:26] a circle you never get off the ground
[1:03:28] that it takes two wings for this eagle
[1:03:30] to fly so there must have mechanics and
[1:03:32] dynamics
[1:03:35] amen this is time we start stressing the
[1:03:38] dynamics and that's what i'm doing
[1:03:40] and why am i stressing the dynamics
[1:03:43] because
[1:03:44] i'm tired of seeing the sick go home
[1:03:46] sick
[1:03:48] i'm tired of seeing people just maintain
[1:03:51] a denominational experience in a message
[1:03:54] truth church sitting on a message pew
[1:03:57] and all they've got is a denominational
[1:04:00] experience
[1:04:03] i joined a church i belong to this
[1:04:06] society of a church
[1:04:12] now and that's why i'm announcing
[1:04:16] this morning that the rest between
[1:04:20] revivals is over
[1:04:24] amen we have started out on a journey
[1:04:28] after the great healing revival that
[1:04:30] crescendoed
[1:04:32] on my that revival crescendoed into
[1:04:36] uh you know into the book being taken by
[1:04:39] the lamb
[1:04:40] and it's seven seals open and thus
[1:04:43] delivered its contents to us
[1:04:47] to word today we have an open book
[1:04:52] and we have spent 60 years since we
[1:04:54] discovered
[1:04:55] where we were in time go back 60 years
[1:04:59] ago and you'll know where we're at
[1:05:01] and man you're we're we're right back to
[1:05:04] what was it um 1960.
[1:05:08] and that we we we discovered there
[1:05:11] where we were in time that as a church
[1:05:14] we had journeyed through seven ages
[1:05:18] come on and we had now come to the last
[1:05:21] one
[1:05:22] and there's not going to be another age
[1:05:26] there's not an eighth one come on
[1:05:27] there's not something beyond this
[1:05:29] message
[1:05:30] there's not a bright age beyond this
[1:05:32] message
[1:05:33] or this age amen but right here in this
[1:05:36] last age there is a bride
[1:05:37] who has come to maturity who knows her
[1:05:41] place
[1:05:41] and knows her position amen
[1:05:46] now somehow
[1:05:49] along this journey we are hearing views
[1:05:53] that have been expressed in the boat
[1:05:55] that pentecost is really not our goal
[1:05:59] that you know but before jesus went to
[1:06:03] sleep in our boat he taught that
[1:06:09] that went over your head maybe you're
[1:06:12] just thinking about it
[1:06:13] i said somehow we're hearing views in
[1:06:16] this
[1:06:17] and you know been hearing views as we
[1:06:20] went along
[1:06:21] in this testimony on the sea and people
[1:06:23] have been talking about the message
[1:06:26] and they you know we've had the
[1:06:28] different ones discussing well this is
[1:06:30] talking about the miracles
[1:06:31] this is talking about the doctrines and
[1:06:33] and they're they're
[1:06:34] they're you know talking back and forth
[1:06:37] and weaving back and forth and
[1:06:39] we've heard views expressed in the boat
[1:06:43] that really pentecost is not our goal
[1:06:46] that before jesus but before jesus went
[1:06:49] to sleep in our boat
[1:06:50] he taught that you know and somehow
[1:06:53] we're to end up with something different
[1:06:56] today that was what was poured out in
[1:06:58] pentecost
[1:07:00] now listen even the devil
[1:07:03] in the storm and there's a devil in this
[1:07:05] storm
[1:07:08] amen there's a devil in this storm and
[1:07:11] we started out on the boat and the winds
[1:07:13] are now blowing and
[1:07:15] you know he knows there's deliverance
[1:07:17] laying ahead
[1:07:18] he knows there are tombs that's got to
[1:07:20] be emptied
[1:07:22] he knows that there's coming a major
[1:07:25] defeat for him
[1:07:26] and all of him has come out against
[1:07:30] us with millions of devils swearing
[1:07:34] that he would drown us before we can
[1:07:36] reach the goal
[1:07:39] are you with me and the devil in the
[1:07:42] storm
[1:07:43] knows assuredly that the original church
[1:07:46] at pentecost with the power of god mark
[1:07:49] 16 in action
[1:07:51] is the true church that jesus claims is
[1:07:54] his own
[1:07:54] and all else is fault it has to be
[1:07:58] christ in the church is a continuation
[1:08:01] of the book of acts
[1:08:07] don't point to me all their failures i
[1:08:10] don't want to hear it
[1:08:11] don't point to me all the bickering and
[1:08:13] the fussing and whatever except
[1:08:15] the only good that does to me let me
[1:08:17] know is that we can have a book of acts
[1:08:19] right in the middle of trouble
[1:08:24] amen that's all it points to me that
[1:08:27] people are people and humans are humans
[1:08:28] and
[1:08:29] trouble is trouble no matter where you
[1:08:31] go and what age you live in
[1:08:34] but we can have a book of acts right in
[1:08:36] the middle of trouble
[1:08:38] i'm talking about we're a continuation
[1:08:41] of the acts of the holy ghost not the
[1:08:44] acts
[1:08:44] of carnal men
[1:08:48] and it is not the acts of carnal men
[1:08:50] that has been restored
[1:08:52] it is the act of the holy ghost working
[1:08:56] in his
[1:08:56] people don't miss the point
[1:09:02] the seven ages were represented by seven
[1:09:06] lamps the holy fire from the altar being
[1:09:10] passed
[1:09:11] from lamp to lamp to lamp as he saw
[1:09:14] this lamp here with seven golden
[1:09:18] candlesticks it's a wonderful type of
[1:09:21] the holy spirit in
[1:09:22] the seven church ages the original
[1:09:25] outpouring of pentecost
[1:09:27] which outpouring came direct from jesus
[1:09:31] from on the mercy seat now no wonder
[1:09:34] some people
[1:09:34] say the outpouring is over because they
[1:09:37] don't believe jesus on the mercy seat no
[1:09:39] more
[1:09:40] you see the original outpouring of the
[1:09:43] holy ghost
[1:09:44] of pentecost which which became direct
[1:09:47] from jesus on the mercy
[1:09:49] is enduring and doing his church through
[1:09:52] all the seven ages
[1:09:53] and showing perfectly that jesus christ
[1:09:56] is the same
[1:09:57] yesterday today and forever and
[1:10:01] and the never changing god the in
[1:10:04] essence and his ways but yet
[1:10:08] we're being told on the boat that
[1:10:11] somehow we got something different from
[1:10:12] what they had next to
[1:10:14] that the holy ghost don't come the same
[1:10:16] way
[1:10:18] amen and for me indeed for many it
[1:10:21] doesn't match the original outpouring
[1:10:24] and whatever this snake oil is there
[1:10:26] that we're trying to burn today the fire
[1:10:28] of god won't stay lit on
[1:10:30] it so that's why it keeps going out
[1:10:34] amen but come back to the original oil
[1:10:37] listen to what the prophet said what the
[1:10:39] church was at pentecost is the standard
[1:10:42] that is the pattern there is no other
[1:10:44] pattern but somehow we're
[1:10:46] winding up with something different we
[1:10:49] we don't want those acts 238
[1:10:51] blabbering screaming shouting amen
[1:10:55] who are the second adam's way of acting
[1:10:58] amen again the prophet of god would tell
[1:11:02] us
[1:11:02] what the church had at pentecost is her
[1:11:05] inalienable right
[1:11:07] originally she had the pure word of god
[1:11:09] she had the power of the spirit
[1:11:11] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:11:14] and gifts of the spirit
[1:11:16] but somehow we're told to expect
[1:11:18] different results
[1:11:21] and if the original root at pentecost
[1:11:24] was an orange tree how can we have
[1:11:28] bitter lemons coming forth as the fruit
[1:11:34] broken fellowship the orders that were
[1:11:39] to be used to push the boat along toward
[1:11:42] the gulf
[1:11:44] has wound up as weapons against one
[1:11:46] another
[1:11:49] scripture doesn't fight scripture and
[1:11:52] quotes don't fight quotes
[1:11:56] again the the true church will always
[1:11:58] try to be like the original at pentecost
[1:12:02] i hope that wrong amen the true church
[1:12:05] today will try to approximate
[1:12:07] that early first one the messengers to
[1:12:10] the churches having the same spirit of
[1:12:12] god in them
[1:12:13] will try to approximate the apostle paul
[1:12:16] they won't be exactly like him but the
[1:12:18] true messengers will be the ones that
[1:12:20] come the closest to paul
[1:12:22] who was free of all man sold out to god
[1:12:24] and gave forth the word of god only
[1:12:27] and manifested the holy ghost in power
[1:12:29] nothing else will do
[1:12:31] you have to work from the original as
[1:12:33] light begets like the true church will
[1:12:36] always be the one that tries to follow
[1:12:38] in the steps of her founders at
[1:12:39] pentecost
[1:12:40] and her messengers will follow the
[1:12:42] apostle paul
[1:12:43] the first messenger to the first church
[1:12:46] is that simple
[1:12:47] and that wonderful
[1:12:52] again quoting from brother branham
[1:12:56] oh where are we spiritually
[1:12:59] we're in a wilderness
[1:13:03] we're in a wilderness of darkness
[1:13:07] how far we've wandered from the first
[1:13:09] church
[1:13:10] pentecost is no longer in view the word
[1:13:14] can't be found
[1:13:16] you know there comes a point you know in
[1:13:18] your
[1:13:19] journey you can look back easily and see
[1:13:22] where you came from
[1:13:26] and you're headed toward another goal
[1:13:29] but you know
[1:13:30] once you get so far you can't see what
[1:13:33] was back there
[1:13:36] and yet you can't see what's up there
[1:13:40] amen so that's why you got to have the
[1:13:42] compass of the word just to keep going
[1:13:44] in the correct direction you were told
[1:13:46] to go originally
[1:13:50] amen now again let me just say
[1:13:54] again that the same spirit that was in
[1:13:57] jesus while he was there here on earth
[1:13:59] causing him to do mighty works
[1:14:01] which he did came back on the church at
[1:14:04] pentecost
[1:14:04] so they did the works that he did
[1:14:08] it is the restoration god will take the
[1:14:11] church
[1:14:12] right back to pentecost to the beginning
[1:14:16] now of course you know we hear the
[1:14:19] murmurings
[1:14:20] on the boat but we're in the bright age
[1:14:24] and there's no revival in this bright
[1:14:26] age
[1:14:28] you know why that's because we turn the
[1:14:31] we turn the bright age into an
[1:14:33] intellectual revival
[1:14:36] and we call that a word revival and it's
[1:14:39] not
[1:14:39] a word revival it's an intellectual
[1:14:42] revival
[1:14:44] now in broken sisters brother branham
[1:14:46] told us he said
[1:14:48] education cannot bring life
[1:14:51] and too many times our our our pulpits
[1:14:55] have been turned into
[1:14:56] intellectual um uh uh speeches
[1:15:00] and talks rather than the power of god
[1:15:03] into salvation are you with me
[1:15:06] but it can never bring life as he said
[1:15:09] it takes the spirit of god to bring life
[1:15:11] and life must get must not come out of
[1:15:13] an intellectual revival
[1:15:15] it's got to come out of the bible a word
[1:15:18] revival
[1:15:19] and that word is the same yesterday
[1:15:21] today and forever
[1:15:22] and when it falls today and quickens you
[1:15:25] get the same results
[1:15:27] you got in acts 2.
[1:15:32] now it always has always will be because
[1:15:36] it's the spirit of god that conditions
[1:15:37] the atmosphere
[1:15:40] and it is the rise in the sun
[1:15:43] brother branham talked about christ
[1:15:45] being the first fruits
[1:15:46] that slept then he talked about the
[1:15:48] bride coming to christ
[1:15:50] that there was another first fruits
[1:15:52] we're at another harvest
[1:15:55] we're in harvest time and
[1:15:58] in this harvest time it's not the groom
[1:16:00] coming it's the bride coming
[1:16:03] that's what a lot of the confusion
[1:16:05] that's going on today
[1:16:06] is people don't realize he had to come
[1:16:09] and bribe for him
[1:16:10] before he can come back and groom for
[1:16:12] him
[1:16:14] so he's got to come back in his church
[1:16:16] first
[1:16:18] amen in order to do that he had to have
[1:16:20] a word
[1:16:21] of god that would come to a prophet so
[1:16:24] it would be a word coming
[1:16:26] through a prophet to become flesh and a
[1:16:28] bride
[1:16:29] come on somebody and that bride to
[1:16:31] become the bride
[1:16:33] coming of christ do you realize you are
[1:16:37] part
[1:16:37] of his coming that we are
[1:16:40] already in his coming because god has a
[1:16:44] bride here on earth
[1:16:46] who is christ in bright form
[1:16:51] because he got the same spirit the same
[1:16:53] life
[1:16:55] and if you got the same spirit and the
[1:16:57] same life then you gotta have the same
[1:17:00] results
[1:17:03] so he said even as there was a sheaf as
[1:17:06] it would take
[1:17:06] uh you know omers of the grain of the
[1:17:09] barley harvest and they would wave that
[1:17:12] they would wave that um and in the
[1:17:15] barley harvest
[1:17:16] and then that would happen the the day
[1:17:19] after
[1:17:20] um after the crucifixion or after the
[1:17:22] passover
[1:17:23] and then and then they would then come
[1:17:25] up 50 days seven weeks later
[1:17:28] and they would come another waving of
[1:17:30] the sheep the
[1:17:32] sheaf sheath not sheep sheath
[1:17:35] a sheep is a collection of the grains
[1:17:39] a man and they would collect it and a
[1:17:41] priest would wave it
[1:17:43] it's amazing you realize that jesus when
[1:17:46] he rose from the dead
[1:17:48] at the rising of the sun he arose from
[1:17:52] the dead
[1:17:53] in his resurrection at the very same
[1:17:56] time
[1:17:57] that the high priest was there in the
[1:18:00] temple
[1:18:01] waving the barley harvest before the
[1:18:04] lord
[1:18:05] and here was the first fruits
[1:18:09] the first one up from the dead
[1:18:12] hallelujah
[1:18:13] waving before the people i'm not dead
[1:18:17] and there was a harvest of the old
[1:18:19] testament saints for they
[1:18:21] they that slept rose with him come on
[1:18:24] there was a harvest then now
[1:18:27] 50 days later seven weeks later seven
[1:18:30] churches later it is now not a barley
[1:18:33] harvest
[1:18:34] but a weed harvest and the we harvest is
[1:18:38] the gentile hallelujah
[1:18:41] amen god has brought a first fruit
[1:18:45] of the first from among the dead out of
[1:18:48] the tombs of denomination
[1:18:52] to wave before the people that he's the
[1:18:55] same as yesterday today and forever
[1:18:59] that this one's exactly like the one
[1:19:02] that fell on the day of pentecost
[1:19:06] now if you've wheat
[1:19:09] this is it if wheat
[1:19:13] was the original planting
[1:19:17] then the harvest can't produce a
[1:19:19] different result
[1:19:23] if it was a weak planet at pentecost you
[1:19:27] can't have a different result the
[1:19:30] message must
[1:19:31] be the same somebody help me preach
[1:19:35] i mean come on if you planted wheat you
[1:19:38] don't expect to get
[1:19:39] corn or that's maize or or
[1:19:42] or garlic or some other thing you expect
[1:19:45] wheat
[1:19:47] amer and if god planted a church on the
[1:19:50] day of pentecost
[1:19:51] and it was weak then when it comes back
[1:19:54] to harvest again
[1:19:55] how come we're expecting a different
[1:19:57] result we've got to have the same
[1:19:59] results
[1:20:01] and if that one wrote a book of acts
[1:20:03] this one writes a book of ice
[1:20:05] and this would display the holy spirit
[1:20:08] that's what displays the holy spirit
[1:20:10] the acts of the holy spirit will be in
[1:20:13] that church
[1:20:14] and she's way before the people come on
[1:20:18] amen before the lord
[1:20:21] as the first ones the first fruits from
[1:20:23] the dead
[1:20:25] now this is part of it now
[1:20:28] i want you to get this now let's talk
[1:20:31] about it
[1:20:32] let's talk about the bright age and what
[1:20:34] its message is
[1:20:37] because people say well we're in the
[1:20:39] bright age we're not in pentecostal age
[1:20:41] which we're not not not azusa
[1:20:47] we're actually not even in the first
[1:20:49] stage again
[1:20:51] we're not in ephesus
[1:20:54] we're not repeating the church ages
[1:20:59] this is the bright age you know what
[1:21:02] bright age means it means
[1:21:04] where it comes to maturity
[1:21:08] you don't you don't take a little girl
[1:21:11] you know that's
[1:21:12] five six years old and make her a bride
[1:21:15] unless you're some of these idiots from
[1:21:17] overseas
[1:21:19] you don't do that hey man
[1:21:23] you she's got to come to maturity
[1:21:26] she's got to be a mature woman and god
[1:21:29] can't take an immature church
[1:21:32] that's why he's been waiting on you to
[1:21:34] grow up
[1:21:37] amen for you to to develop some faith
[1:21:40] for you to
[1:21:41] to grow up in christ to be like yes
[1:21:45] for the church to be an exact match to
[1:21:47] him
[1:21:48] somebody with me amen so for the british
[1:21:52] he said for the brightest resurrection
[1:21:55] out of dark denominationalism
[1:21:57] will be a message
[1:22:00] how many wants to know what that message
[1:22:03] is
[1:22:04] the message of the bright age is that
[1:22:06] the full
[1:22:07] maturity of the word has turned back in
[1:22:10] his full
[1:22:10] power and is being waved over the people
[1:22:13] by the same old signs
[1:22:14] and wonders that he did back there
[1:22:17] because
[1:22:17] i live you shall have also speaking to
[1:22:21] his wife
[1:22:23] because i live you shall have also what
[1:22:26] a resurrection that was
[1:22:28] 2 000 years ago amen but what a
[1:22:31] resurrection this
[1:22:32] is to be quickened from the dead
[1:22:36] to be made alive in christ jesus by
[1:22:39] god's quickening power so the message is
[1:22:44] go tell my disciples i am not
[1:22:47] dead i'm not just a creed
[1:22:52] go tell my disciples i'm alive
[1:22:56] amen i'm no longer in the tombs of
[1:22:58] denomination
[1:23:00] come on i can't be held back in the dark
[1:23:03] clusters but the holy spirit has been
[1:23:06] released
[1:23:07] by the evening time message imagine that
[1:23:10] message has a message to the world
[1:23:13] go tell my disciples go
[1:23:16] tell him i'm not dead i'm not just a
[1:23:19] theory
[1:23:20] i'm not just intellectual revival but go
[1:23:23] tell them
[1:23:23] i'm alive with the same sign the same
[1:23:26] wonders
[1:23:27] the same holy ghost the same power the
[1:23:30] same divine
[1:23:31] healing the same miracles
[1:23:34] i'm alive
[1:23:36] [Applause]
[1:23:38] that's the bright age message she's to
[1:23:41] be the same kind of bride the same kind
[1:23:44] built out of the same kind of material
[1:23:46] she was at the first place
[1:23:49] amen now read malachi 4 and see if we're
[1:23:51] not supposed to have a message in the
[1:23:53] last days
[1:23:54] that it turned the hearts of the
[1:23:55] children back to the fathers
[1:23:58] back to the original oh this is going to
[1:24:01] choke some of us
[1:24:03] oh man and i'm not using it as an order
[1:24:06] to slap you
[1:24:08] i'm trying to say we need some direction
[1:24:10] in this hour
[1:24:11] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:24:13] the fathers
[1:24:15] back to the original pentecostal message
[1:24:18] word by word
[1:24:21] and then he says brothers we are here
[1:24:27] hallelujah we got the message we just
[1:24:30] need to go tell
[1:24:33] amen oh my listen
[1:24:36] he said there's pentecostal people today
[1:24:38] by the way this
[1:24:39] easter seal today let me say this that
[1:24:42] we
[1:24:43] are standing how many wants to know
[1:24:45] where we're standing
[1:24:46] we are standing in this last day where
[1:24:49] god
[1:24:50] promised he had poured out his spirit
[1:24:51] upon all flesh
[1:24:53] and his sons and daughters have
[1:24:55] prophesied for he said
[1:24:56] these signs shall follow them that
[1:24:58] believe it's the hour
[1:25:00] that's what makes that creation in you
[1:25:04] now so then how do we
[1:25:08] expect different results
[1:25:12] if it's the same thing
[1:25:16] come on amen listen if it
[1:25:19] we you know if we're to be quickened
[1:25:21] they're made alive like them
[1:25:23] then also shouldn't we have the same
[1:25:25] results
[1:25:27] let me stop here just for a minute
[1:25:29] because in the type it was shown
[1:25:32] from the crucifixion which is the
[1:25:34] passover time
[1:25:36] to and the resurrection there were there
[1:25:40] were again
[1:25:40] seven weeks is that right
[1:25:44] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:25:46] come
[1:25:48] there were these sheeps
[1:25:51] that had been gathered in the upper room
[1:25:54] and they were ready to be waived
[1:25:57] come on and so on the day of pentecost
[1:26:00] 50 days after come on
[1:26:04] after the passover and we have come now
[1:26:07] 50 days or or seven months or seven
[1:26:11] excuse me seven church ages we have come
[1:26:15] now
[1:26:16] is everybody with me you're on the same
[1:26:18] page now
[1:26:19] since the passover here we are and now
[1:26:22] we're filling out
[1:26:23] all the tights and now the day of
[1:26:26] pentecost has fully come
[1:26:30] to the church ages and we are in the
[1:26:34] days whether
[1:26:35] the day of pentecost has fully come
[1:26:37] because it's been the feast of weeks
[1:26:39] it's been the seven churches but now
[1:26:42] we're in the last
[1:26:47] when that pentecostal group on the day
[1:26:49] of pentecost received their abstract
[1:26:51] deed
[1:26:52] isn't that what we got somebody help me
[1:26:55] preach
[1:26:56] look look is this not an abstract deed
[1:26:58] today
[1:27:00] is it not amen when god took the seven
[1:27:03] seals
[1:27:04] off of the book and opened the book and
[1:27:06] showed us clearly what serpency
[1:27:08] predestination eternal security
[1:27:11] all of the things of things in the bible
[1:27:14] where the bible is now an open book and
[1:27:17] we're not guessing
[1:27:18] in it we don't even have brother branham
[1:27:21] guessing at it
[1:27:23] prove it into the book wondering if he's
[1:27:26] right or wrong
[1:27:27] because now by divine vindiction we have
[1:27:31] the book open
[1:27:33] and the seals is off the book giving you
[1:27:35] an abstract
[1:27:37] this age has received an abstract of
[1:27:40] title
[1:27:43] hallelujah but that's not all of it you
[1:27:46] as an
[1:27:46] individual can receive your abstract of
[1:27:49] title
[1:27:50] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:52] which means
[1:27:53] everything that was against you is split
[1:27:56] up
[1:27:57] all your sins all your past
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:03] amen ever debt
[1:28:07] tell me when that you made jesus can't
[1:28:09] pay
[1:28:11] amen why you with the holy ghost you
[1:28:13] have an abstract
[1:28:15] that ever sinned has been wiped away
[1:28:19] hallelujah you are free and clear and on
[1:28:22] the day of pentecost when they received
[1:28:25] their abstract it glorified their soul
[1:28:28] they screamed they saw tongues of fire
[1:28:31] separated
[1:28:32] upon each of them and it quickened their
[1:28:34] body till they couldn't even speak in an
[1:28:36] earthly language anymore
[1:28:38] it quickened their body to a heavenly
[1:28:40] language the place that we're going to
[1:28:42] quickening power shook their mortal
[1:28:44] bodies so
[1:28:45] till their entire mortal language was
[1:28:48] transfigured
[1:28:49] transformed into an immortal language
[1:28:51] what a quickening power
[1:28:55] what something that belongs to the
[1:28:57] spirit that raised up jesus from the
[1:28:59] dead dwells in your immortal body
[1:29:02] it shall quicken your mortal body we are
[1:29:05] quickened by
[1:29:06] the power of the living god
[1:29:10] tongues quickened up to heavenly
[1:29:12] language to speak to them eruption of
[1:29:15] raising up into a different atmosphere
[1:29:18] than what they ever had lived in
[1:29:20] and now the with the also with the
[1:29:22] quickening life to them
[1:29:23] that come to them it quickened their
[1:29:25] language they spoke in new tongues
[1:29:28] it was designed to give them after this
[1:29:32] abstract
[1:29:33] it was designed to give them every
[1:29:35] promise
[1:29:36] that was on the grounds
[1:29:39] so when we got an abstract of the book
[1:29:41] by the openness seals
[1:29:43] it opened up every promise in the land
[1:29:47] that's why i'm preaching on the people
[1:29:49] of the land because it opens up the
[1:29:51] whole land
[1:29:52] everything that god gave in the past is
[1:29:54] ours
[1:29:56] is that right if they laid hands on the
[1:29:59] sick we got the right to do so
[1:30:01] amen they spoke with new tongues it can
[1:30:02] happen to you they
[1:30:04] saw signs and wonders because it's god's
[1:30:06] promise
[1:30:08] amen and the quickening power was there
[1:30:14] now it brought them back to the grounds
[1:30:18] that's what happened to us it opens up
[1:30:21] everything now the rapture belongs to
[1:30:24] you
[1:30:26] the deed is clear all the confusion of
[1:30:30] the ages was wiped away
[1:30:31] come on and when you get the holy ghost
[1:30:34] the same thing
[1:30:36] whether your mom or daddy your dad had
[1:30:38] done it
[1:30:39] whether you were illegitimately born or
[1:30:42] whether you were in a situation that you
[1:30:45] you know where you did the sinning and
[1:30:47] then we
[1:30:48] will as it was come on but when you get
[1:30:51] an abstract
[1:30:52] it shows the debt is paid and the devil
[1:30:56] doesn't have a claim on your life
[1:30:58] anymore
[1:30:59] glory to god i'm preaching to people
[1:31:01] that the devil don't have a claim of
[1:31:04] that we can say like jesus said that
[1:31:07] that
[1:31:07] satan has come and he has found no part
[1:31:10] in me
[1:31:10] he don't have a part in my life i don't
[1:31:13] belong to him my body don't belong to
[1:31:15] him my
[1:31:16] attitude my spirit nothing belongs to
[1:31:18] him
[1:31:21] satan you have no right on the body of
[1:31:23] the bride of jesus christ
[1:31:25] you have no right of our children you
[1:31:27] don't have any right on our children's
[1:31:29] children
[1:31:31] because we've got an abstract that the
[1:31:34] deed is clear
[1:31:36] and that every promise in the book
[1:31:39] belongs to us
[1:31:44] hallelujah
[1:31:50] when jesus was here he demonstrated the
[1:31:52] grounds that belonged to the sons of god
[1:31:55] on those grounds that were healing there
[1:31:58] were miracles
[1:32:00] hallelujah how dare we have some ones
[1:32:03] who said we don't have no rights to it
[1:32:05] well we're the people of the book
[1:32:10] amen easter seal he said the works that
[1:32:14] i do so you do also john 14 12.
[1:32:16] these signs shall follow them that
[1:32:18] believe that's mark 16.
[1:32:20] that is assurance when we see a group of
[1:32:23] people
[1:32:24] sitting together until signs manifesting
[1:32:28] themselves
[1:32:30] that is the assurance that the abstract
[1:32:33] is there to vindicate that that's the
[1:32:36] property of god
[1:32:39] and you want me to hide it under a
[1:32:41] bushel
[1:32:42] you want me not to testify of what god
[1:32:45] has done
[1:32:47] amen no sir when we see those signs
[1:32:50] manifesting themselves when we see
[1:32:53] healing
[1:32:54] when we see black sliders coming back
[1:32:57] protestants coming home
[1:32:59] when we see those that were impossible
[1:33:02] saved
[1:33:04] hallelujah brain bleeds healed come on
[1:33:06] cancers leave
[1:33:08] and then kidney disease leave when we
[1:33:10] begin to see
[1:33:11] the signs multiplying among us
[1:33:14] that is the assurance that the abstract
[1:33:17] is there
[1:33:18] to vindicate this is the property of god
[1:33:23] it is our property we know now cancer
[1:33:27] can be healed
[1:33:28] in our generation amen is our property
[1:33:32] we know now
[1:33:36] amen amen you talk about knowledge
[1:33:40] this is the knowledge we wanted oh my
[1:33:44] not just knowledge of how to dissect and
[1:33:47] you know add to
[1:33:48] and read between the lines and say
[1:33:50] something brother branham didn't say
[1:33:52] the message didn't say
[1:33:57] if the new birth is experienced here's
[1:34:00] what we have
[1:34:02] the dew dewdrops that come down from
[1:34:04] heaven the word of god says it'll wash
[1:34:07] away your sin and remain
[1:34:09] and you're baptized in the name of jesus
[1:34:11] christ for what
[1:34:12] what for the remission of your sins sins
[1:34:15] are emitted
[1:34:17] in the name of jesus christ as he said
[1:34:20] in his it is a horizon of the son
[1:34:23] in his prayer father if they're sick
[1:34:27] may they walk out here well
[1:34:30] maybe maybe if they're crippled that
[1:34:32] they'll walk out unto the power of the
[1:34:34] holy spirit
[1:34:36] if they've been sinners may they walk
[1:34:38] out of here
[1:34:39] washed and cleaned and the mechanics by
[1:34:43] going in the dynamics from above
[1:34:46] the holy spirit catch them away quick in
[1:34:48] their mortal bodies
[1:34:49] then we will hear you we shall hear
[1:34:51] genuine new tongues
[1:34:53] powers of god love and told dying grace
[1:34:56] and living grace
[1:34:58] and a resurrected christ a body of bride
[1:35:01] representing
[1:35:02] on the earth notice he said the very
[1:35:06] message again
[1:35:09] rising of the sun unless i tell you it's
[1:35:12] going to be from 63 through 65 that's
[1:35:14] what i'm covering
[1:35:17] the very message of the gospel itself
[1:35:20] is to prove to the people
[1:35:24] that he's risen glo tell
[1:35:28] my disciples i am risen from the dead
[1:35:32] i'll meet with him to confirm this oh
[1:35:34] god
[1:35:35] how in this last day there shall be
[1:35:37] light again across the earth
[1:35:39] and i'll prove to my disciples go tell
[1:35:42] them i'm not
[1:35:43] dead and i'm not a tradition but i'm a
[1:35:45] living christ i'll meet them take
[1:35:48] this message to my disciples that i'm
[1:35:50] risen from the dead
[1:35:52] it's the gospel the good news
[1:35:56] hallelujah so jesus
[1:35:59] is in our boat
[1:36:03] i don't care what you're going through
[1:36:04] today you may be listening to me and
[1:36:07] kobe's got you down
[1:36:08] i don't care
[1:36:12] we got jesus in the boat
[1:36:18] a boat has got jesus and it is

[1:36:36] they seen him do the same thing they had
[1:36:39] him out there

[1:36:42] before no things
[1:36:44] tell the people the secrets of the heart
[1:36:46] and they believed they were on
[1:36:48] the road to another revival
[1:36:52] but when trouble set in they forgot all
[1:36:55] about it
[1:36:59] it's easy when trouble comes
[1:37:02] to get our minds off what our real goal
[1:37:04] is
[1:37:08] this is when quarrels start in families
[1:37:11] when they get their minds off of what
[1:37:12] our real goal is
[1:37:18] this is when trouble starts when we get
[1:37:21] our
[1:37:22] our goal off of jesus we make something
[1:37:25] else our goal
[1:37:26] oh if i could just get ahead in life if
[1:37:29] i could just get ahead
[1:37:31] if i can just get ahead in life i'll
[1:37:33] tell you how
[1:37:35] get jesus

[1:38:20] defect anywhere
[1:38:23] 21 forever amen it's not a slogan

[1:38:32] experience inside their soul
[1:38:34] they are forever 21 and their bodies
[1:38:37] going to come and line up with that
[1:38:41] it's a mansion
[1:38:48] but when trouble sets in we begin to
[1:38:50] forget all about who's in our ship
[1:38:54] he's just as great as he was
[1:38:58] out here in the divine healing move and
[1:39:01] opened the eyes of the blind he hadn't
[1:39:03] changed in power
[1:39:05] made cripples walk he's still the same
[1:39:09] god
[1:39:11] a man he's just as great as he was when
[1:39:13] he stood in space
[1:39:16] how many believes us amen i
[1:39:20] i sort of believe in the big bang
[1:39:23] it's not a theory it really happened
[1:39:27] he took and rolled the world off his
[1:39:29] hand and throwed it out there
[1:39:32] let it drift maybe for a million years
[1:39:34] till it comes an iceberg
[1:39:35] and pulls it back and puts it right in
[1:39:37] position and place
[1:39:39] and he sets it there
[1:39:44] everything revolves around he's the god
[1:39:47] who did this
[1:39:49] my god said let her be and it was
[1:39:54] you want to argue about it in sciences i
[1:39:57] don't really care what
[1:39:58] punky science says they never have been
[1:40:01] true in what they know they only know
[1:40:04] his men
[1:40:08] but my god spun this world off of his
[1:40:11] hands
[1:40:12] and put it out there a little dot in the
[1:40:15] universe
[1:40:17] and he poured all his love out on it
[1:40:26] and when you take and you look from
[1:40:27] other worlds and you look from other
[1:40:30] worlds another universe
[1:40:32] it's such a little speck it's not even
[1:40:34] discernable to the eye
[1:40:36] it's a piece of dust
[1:40:40] but on that piece of dust let's look a
[1:40:42] little further
[1:40:44] there was a timothy hall
[1:40:48] a little tiny piece of dust and god so
[1:40:52] loved that piece of dust he became one
[1:40:55] of them
[1:40:56] to redeem timothy hall and to make a son
[1:41:00] of god out of it
[1:41:04] because this god is so big he can become
[1:41:07] so
[1:41:08] little until he becomes a piece of dust
[1:41:12] just like you to save that piece of dust
[1:41:16] to bring you back and put you in the
[1:41:18] orbit that you fell from
[1:41:20] that was in his mind before the world
[1:41:22] began and he's not going to lose
[1:41:24] one of his pieces of dust even if you're
[1:41:28] a legion bound with demons
[1:41:31] and the church is struggling to get to
[1:41:33] you but we're coming
[1:41:35] in we're coming
[1:41:40] and i want the devil to know we're
[1:41:41] coming
[1:41:43] we're coming for those above the tomb
[1:41:45] we're coming for the legions that are
[1:41:46] present
[1:41:47] we're coming for the sick we're coming
[1:41:50] for the dead in christ we're coming
[1:41:52] we're on our way
[1:41:55] but we've got to get jesus awoke in our
[1:41:57] ship to get there
[1:42:05] as i thought about awakening i thought
[1:42:08] eliza
[1:42:09] this is three o'clock in the morning
[1:42:11] live was
[1:42:13] four days four days
[1:42:18] i'll go wake him tight luther wesley
[1:42:21] pentecost and here now
[1:42:24] we're on the fourth day i go wake him
[1:42:28] but this time it won't be just lazarus
[1:42:34] amen remember brother branham was saying
[1:42:36] that he had this hadn't said
[1:42:38] lives was all the dead in christ would
[1:42:39] arose but he said lazarus
[1:42:42] but this time he won't say lazarus this
[1:42:45] time he will call
[1:42:46] and all the dead in christ will hear his
[1:42:49] voice
[1:42:50] and live
[1:42:53] i'm telling you friends we're not just
[1:42:56] coming for the legions among the tombs
[1:42:59] we're coming for the dead that is in the
[1:43:01] tombs
[1:43:05] makes me want to shout
[1:43:11] this god is just as great as he was when
[1:43:13] he healed the lepers
[1:43:16] there's no problem for your skin
[1:43:18] condition
[1:43:21] all right man he's as great as he was in
[1:43:23] the wealth's revival
[1:43:25] he's as great as he was in any time
[1:43:30] and he's hearing the ship
[1:43:33] trouble to set in brother branham said
[1:43:36] we go to places we find fusses in the
[1:43:38] church tear up
[1:43:39] you know that aruna church stay together
[1:43:42] he said if we just catch that vision the
[1:43:44] very jehovah
[1:43:46] that made the heavens and the earth is
[1:43:48] right in this little vessel of ours
[1:43:52] while we're sailing light solemn maine

[1:44:12] jesus and
[1:44:13] all that jesus was he poured in his
[1:44:15] church and he divided himself
[1:44:17] on the day of pentecost that pillar of
[1:44:19] fire came down and busted itself
[1:44:22] up this kind of glory and put it in
[1:44:24] different ones tongues of fire
[1:44:26] was seen upon each one the holy spirit
[1:44:29] god identified himself in human beings
[1:44:33] each of us have us that portion
[1:44:38] but in that portion in each portion
[1:44:41] is omnipotence that's why he said if you

[1:47:01] stare
[1:47:02] that the devil has ever stirr
[1:47:05] every power every satanic move remain
[1:47:09] right on down to where it'll go find

[1:47:41] dead things jesus went to deliver those
[1:47:45] who were among the tombs he wants to
[1:47:47] seek and to say that which is
[1:47:49] lost brother branham said is a good
[1:47:52] hangout for the devil a dead place
[1:47:56] that's the way it is he hangs out at
[1:47:57] dead places
[1:47:59] he said if you want to know truthfully
[1:48:00] some of the old cold formal churches
[1:48:02] that has a form of godliness and denies
[1:48:04] the power thereof is a real hangout for
[1:48:06] devils
[1:48:07] didn't the bible say that they would
[1:48:10] become a cage of every unclean and
[1:48:12] hateful bird
[1:48:14] amen you know there that's why sitting
[1:48:17] on message pews can be
[1:48:18] can be every kind of sin
[1:48:23] every kind of sin discovered come on
[1:48:27] because what the word is not being
[1:48:30] preached
[1:48:31] to bring conviction and correction
[1:48:35] are you with me amen oh he says
[1:48:38] if you want to know truth some of this
[1:48:40] old cold formal churches
[1:48:42] as a form of godliness deny the power of
[1:48:44] a real hangouts for the devil
[1:48:46] that's right a place where they say oh
[1:48:48] that's just a workup that's all mental
[1:48:50] that's psychology
[1:48:51] oh mind some of these devils don't make
[1:48:53] you cut yourself
[1:48:56] some of them are just as shrewd and
[1:48:58] polished as can be

[1:49:02] they're not you know brother branham oh
[1:49:04] he says
[1:49:05] he says those jews that denied jesus

[1:49:09] religious devils came down
[1:49:11] comes down into people today some people
[1:49:13] trying to make
[1:49:14] fun of the baptism of the holy ghost

[1:49:22] you know they were on their way to
[1:49:23] deliverance of men who were among the
[1:49:26] tombs

[1:49:37] dear brother wrote me i don't want to
[1:49:39] add to your burdens brother tim but i'm
[1:49:42] burdened
[1:49:47] i hear the sound of
[1:49:51] of children of those with autism
[1:49:57] of those laying afflicted for years and
[1:49:59] years and years
[1:50:02] little more than mindless vegetables
[1:50:05] and exhausted parents
[1:50:10] and oh yeah we have them
[1:50:18] i hear of husbands that are drunks
[1:50:22] smothering over memories of a horrible
[1:50:24] childhood
[1:50:26] where that husband watched murders
[1:50:28] happen
[1:50:31] a year of children suffering from
[1:50:33] demonic oppression
[1:50:35] with intense sadness until they wish to
[1:50:38] die

[1:51:20] them
[1:51:21] brother tim there's no hope

[1:51:29] talks about a young man
[1:51:30] in a wheelchair and he prayed with him
[1:51:32] he said now you go and believe him you
[1:51:33] confess it

[1:52:24] that healing evangelist
[1:52:27] and that young man right back in his
[1:52:30] chair

[1:52:34] in my place would you take away the only
[1:52:38] hope i

[1:59:56] talking about some things and next thing
[1:59:58] you know he's yelling out of his head
[2:00:01] some just some irrational something
[2:00:03] screaming at the top of his voice
[2:00:06] and i just said brother john come on
[2:00:08] here with me
[2:00:10] come on we got something to do
[2:00:15] i take him over to some little garden
[2:00:17] where i had some plants to put out and i
[2:00:19] said come on
[2:00:20] i said help me put these plants out
[2:00:23] and we knelt down
[2:00:27] and as we was kneeling there
[2:00:31] when we was putting our plants and i
[2:00:32] said yeah i want them this deep and i
[2:00:34] want this much dirt on them and
[2:00:36] you know i was just talking to him and i
[2:00:38] was just trying to get in the
[2:00:40] rights find the right spirit and finally
[2:00:44] i put my arm around him as he's kneeling
[2:00:46] there
[2:00:47] and i said lord somewhere out there
[2:00:51] this man's spirit has drifted away from
[2:00:54] him
[2:00:57] and his out yonder his human spirit his
[2:01:00] mind
[2:01:00] has went from him but right now
[2:01:04] i'm reaching for that spirit and
[2:01:06] bringing it right back into this
[2:01:07] body and i'm asking for it to come back
[2:01:10] into this body right now
[2:01:12] he rose up from there a healed man
[2:01:17] his mind came back to him
[2:01:27] that's what i'm trying to do with you
[2:01:30] i'm trying to get your mind set back on
[2:01:32] calvary
[2:01:33] on what the cross did on who jesus is
[2:01:40] i'm trying to change your thinking
[2:01:44] when you look and you're thinking there
[2:01:46] is no hope
[2:01:48] i am telling you i'm not trying to tell
[2:01:51] you there is hope there is no hope
[2:01:53] now what i'm trying to tell you is my
[2:01:55] father
[2:01:56] amen he believed in hope against hope
[2:02:00] and his faith and his hope had a war and
[2:02:04] his faith
[2:02:05] won
[2:02:05] [Applause]
[2:02:09] amen he was known as the father of faith
[2:02:12] not the father of hope
[2:02:16] lord and if i can get your mind set back
[2:02:19] on calvary again hallelujah you'll
[2:02:22] become
[2:02:23] people of faith who believe in the
[2:02:26] impossible
[2:02:27] [Applause]
[2:02:31] oh yeah oh yeah
[2:02:34] that's exactly what happened the other
[2:02:36] day in the
[2:02:37] in the icu room i got enough of it
[2:02:42] and i walked in there and said satan
[2:02:44] i've had enough of this
[2:02:46] now you take your hands off of god's
[2:02:48] child
[2:02:49] i'm angry and you're going to take your
[2:02:51] hand off of my wife
[2:02:52] and her mind is coming back to her and
[2:02:55] she's well today
[2:03:02] brother madam said here's just a little
[2:03:04] ill inside
[2:03:05] it's catching her spirit and then you're
[2:03:08] projecting to her
[2:03:10] your very thought and you change your
[2:03:13] thinking and what it does and you can
[2:03:15] center on christ
[2:03:16] and from there she can go on but you got
[2:03:18] to change her way of thinking
[2:03:20] she can't change it herself she said
[2:03:23] just a world
[2:03:24] and you got to pick that up this is what
[2:03:27] brother branham said
[2:03:28] in the absoluteness report now again
[2:03:31] changing your thinking getting it back
[2:03:33] on christ
[2:03:36] because you're thinking it's hopeless i
[2:03:39] might as well give up
[2:03:41] it ain't never going to happen
[2:03:45] father abraham against hope believed in
[2:03:47] hope
[2:03:48] amen when hope was against him there was
[2:03:50] no longer any reason to hope
[2:03:54] come on there's no reason to hope a 90
[2:03:57] year old was going to have a child
[2:03:59] and him a 100 year old come on there was
[2:04:02] no reason to hope there
[2:04:05] about but against hope he believed
[2:04:09] hallelujah faith caused him to have a
[2:04:12] different
[2:04:13] hope his mind was changed by the
[2:04:16] visitation of the angel
[2:04:18] oh hallelujah if we can get the angel
[2:04:22] christ jesus to rise in our hearts
[2:04:24] and a visitation take place you'll quit
[2:04:27] hoping
[2:04:28] and start believing
[2:04:38] stop here just a minute
[2:04:42] we should realize quote brother branham
[2:04:46] 1965 we should realize that in us has
[2:04:49] been given we who believe in jesus
[2:04:51] christ
[2:04:54] been born of his spirit filled with that
[2:04:56] quickening power and that power is in
[2:04:58] you
[2:04:58] by laying on the hands on the others
[2:05:00] like the disciples did down to the ages
[2:05:02] as absolutely healed the sick
[2:05:04] raised the dead showed vision prophecy
[2:05:06] and the very same spirit
[2:05:09] that lived among the early apostles is
[2:05:11] living in the church today
[2:05:13] working the very same things and as
[2:05:16] quick as we can realize that see no
[2:05:18] matter
[2:05:19] how much it's working you've got to
[2:05:22] recognize that and believe that
[2:05:24] it won't do one bit of good until you do
[2:05:27] believe it
[2:05:28] but the moment you believe it your
[2:05:30] troubles are ended
[2:05:41] so why are you trying to give them hope
[2:05:44] i'm not
[2:05:44] i'm trying to disturb their faith
[2:05:49] those hard
[2:05:53] and hopeless cases
[2:05:59] i'm trying to stir your faith will you
[2:06:02] start believing for the impossible
[2:06:05] that nothing is impossible with you
[2:06:15] you can overcome you can rise above
[2:06:20] you can break the cycles
[2:06:24] you don't have to continue the same path
[2:06:28] that others before set for you
[2:06:32] come on now it can be chased
[2:06:35] now this scripture came to me about
[2:06:37] three a.m in the morning
[2:06:38] the other morning when i was thinking on
[2:06:41] this just a flight of things began to
[2:06:43] come
[2:06:44] and the scripture came and i want to
[2:06:45] examine it before we close this morning
[2:06:48] and i'm not sure how i'm closing this
[2:06:54] second timothy 1 and 5.
[2:06:57] when i call to remembrance
[2:07:00] the unveined faith that is in thee
[2:07:03] which first dwelt in thy grandmother
[2:07:05] lois
[2:07:07] and thy mother eunice i am persuaded
[2:07:10] that in thee also wherefore i put thee
[2:07:14] in remembrance that thou stir up the
[2:07:15] gift of god
[2:07:17] which is in thee by the putting on of my
[2:07:19] hands
[2:07:20] for god hath not given us the spirit of
[2:07:22] fear but a power and love
[2:07:24] and of a sound mind now we often quote
[2:07:26] that by itself
[2:07:28] i want you to look at it in its context
[2:07:33] because paul is saying i often think of
[2:07:35] that genuine faith of yours
[2:07:37] a faith that first appeared in your
[2:07:40] grandmother lois
[2:07:41] then in eunice your mother and now i'm
[2:07:44] convinced
[2:07:45] it's in you as well because you have
[2:07:49] this faith
[2:07:50] i would now remind you to stir up that
[2:07:53] inner fire which god
[2:07:54] gave you at your ordination
[2:07:59] so again again i want you to see this in
[2:08:01] a little different light
[2:08:02] here was it was timothy who had a gift
[2:08:06] of faith in his life
[2:08:11] and paul said i recognize it i saw it in
[2:08:14] your grandmother i saw it in
[2:08:16] in eunice your mother and now i see it
[2:08:19] in you
[2:08:21] and so i recognize that in you lays a
[2:08:24] gift of faith
[2:08:25] but i want you to stare it up
[2:08:28] and he said because because god
[2:08:32] oh my come on now because he says god
[2:08:35] has not given us the spirit of
[2:08:37] timidity but a power
[2:08:40] and of a sound mind are you with me now
[2:08:44] he has not given you this for you to be
[2:08:46] timid with it
[2:08:48] but to put that faith forth to stir up
[2:08:51] that faith that is in you
[2:08:55] are you with me now i remind you to stir
[2:08:58] up that
[2:08:58] inner fire which god gave you
[2:09:02] and then stir up that gift of god for
[2:09:05] god has not given us a spirit of fear
[2:09:07] but a power and of love and a sound mind
[2:09:09] keep that faith ablaze god don't want us
[2:09:12] to be shy with his gifts
[2:09:13] but be bold and loving insensible
[2:09:18] this is what he was saying god does not
[2:09:20] want you to be shy with your gift
[2:09:22] you've got faith he wants you to put it
[2:09:24] to work
[2:09:25] he didn't give christ in your life for
[2:09:28] him to sleep
[2:09:29] he put christ in your life to overcome
[2:09:31] with
[2:09:32] [Music]
[2:09:35] so straight up set it ablaze
[2:09:39] yes
[2:09:44] revive god's gift his strength his zeal
[2:09:49] remember that statement wrestling
[2:09:51] between revivals
[2:09:53] i want you to know we're headed now
[2:09:55] toward another surge of the holy ghost
[2:09:58] somebody help me preach brother branham
[2:10:01] said i'm looking forward to another time
[2:10:03] 63
[2:10:04] sermon i'm looking for a time of a break
[2:10:07] forth of the spirit of god in these last
[2:10:09] days we're now living in
[2:10:10] for another surge of the holy ghost holy
[2:10:13] spirit into the
[2:10:14] church for a rapture and faith just
[2:10:15] before it comes
[2:10:17] everything is setting right straight in
[2:10:18] order that and i believe that
[2:10:20] we're now at the time that the word
[2:10:21] shall have preeminence
[2:10:25] is somebody with me so brother branham
[2:10:27] was looking for another surge
[2:10:29] in the church i think we need to get
[2:10:31] ready for it
[2:10:34] come on we need to change our mind that
[2:10:36] we can't have revival
[2:10:37] just because the world can't have it the
[2:10:39] usa can't have it but i can have it
[2:10:42] and even like tabernacle can have it and
[2:10:44] wherever you are bright around the world
[2:10:46] in south africa
[2:10:47] asia wherever south down in australia
[2:10:50] you can have revival
[2:10:54] hallelujah again world following part 63
[2:10:57] he said
[2:10:58] the church is ready she's sealed in
[2:10:59] ready to come there will be a big
[2:11:01] outpouring of the spirit yes
[2:11:04] stir serve yes sir to grab that
[2:11:07] church and take her in the skies exactly
[2:11:10] because see the church the word the
[2:11:12] bride and christ is ministries in the
[2:11:14] bride which is his body
[2:11:17] again
[2:11:20] let me carry you down this line just a
[2:11:22] second
[2:11:25] as i went through page by page
[2:11:36] and i've been a student of this message
[2:11:41] let me just tell you
[2:11:46] when i was a 15 year old boy preacher
[2:11:50] and some man laid his tithe in my hand
[2:11:55] i looked at that and i said that's so
[2:11:57] sacred
[2:11:59] i'll never abuse that this is from god
[2:12:04] and if i am given tithe from the people
[2:12:07] of god
[2:12:08] they will have my time
[2:12:15] i don't flip my time away
[2:12:19] every chance i get i'm looking
[2:12:22] searching asking seeking
[2:12:26] i've been going through and i went
[2:12:28] through
[2:12:30] i started in 1963.
[2:12:34] after it started with services at the
[2:12:36] time
[2:12:37] i went through it i combed it over i can
[2:12:40] show you the dates
[2:12:42] we didn't have the message when i first
[2:12:45] come in 1966 and brother branham's gone
[2:12:49] and we
[2:12:49] just got this church book at the at the
[2:12:52] meeting in shreveport
[2:12:56] we had fair few tapes
[2:13:02] we sat around as a family we read that
[2:13:05] paragraph by paragraph thank god for
[2:13:07] godly
[2:13:08] family that did that i cut my teeth
[2:13:12] reading a church aids book at 15 years

[2:13:45] you know how i preached
[2:13:50] you know how the holy ghost fell while i
[2:13:52] was reading and preaching
[2:13:54] teaching from the church age book and i
[2:13:57] preached there
[2:13:58] i still got it in my notes right in my
[2:14:10] book
[2:14:12] i took the warning from god and there on
[2:14:15] that day
[2:14:17] drum butts floundering
[2:14:20] up and down young man television this
[2:14:22] and that
[2:14:23] something changed in his life
[2:14:27] back there my wife received the holy
[2:14:29] ghost that same day
[2:14:31] in my meeting her life has never been
[2:14:35] the same
[2:14:41] and as i was going when we finally got
[2:14:43] it where it could
[2:14:44] be in print and i had the message
[2:14:49] david momless god bless them for their
[2:14:52] work
[2:14:53] i started printing putting out i could
[2:14:56] study in
[2:14:57] chronological order i went through it
[2:15:00] it changed my thinking it changed my
[2:15:04] views
[2:15:05] it straightened me out
[2:15:11] and i got to the last sermon in 1965
[2:15:16] and i'm hearing god say all these things
[2:15:19] that i have been sharing with you
[2:15:21] and i hear him saying these things
[2:15:25] i'm hearing him say to the prophet one
[2:15:27] thing after another about what this
[2:15:29] bride is to be
[2:15:31] and i said lord i'm coming now to the
[2:15:34] last sermon that
[2:15:36] was preached and the last words that was
[2:15:38] spoken to this
[2:15:39] age and i want to know
[2:15:42] i want to know for sure that i
[2:15:45] understood right
[2:15:48] and i get to the last sermon communion
[2:15:51] and this is what i'm sharing with you
[2:15:54] he says in the communion you know the
[2:15:58] hour will soon arise last sermon
[2:16:02] when right among us will be the holy
[2:16:05] spirit
[2:16:06] will speak out like it did in ananias
[2:16:09] and sapphira
[2:16:10] remember the hour is arriving
[2:16:13] now you just remember that god
[2:16:16] is going to dwell among his people
[2:16:20] that's what he wants to do now
[2:16:27] hallelujah let me tell you again let me
[2:16:29] as i went through and i've studied and
[2:16:31] i've come back
[2:16:32] and i and i've collected
[2:16:36] rachel you were there just there with
[2:16:38] you asked me what i was doing
[2:16:41] i took every one of those books and i
[2:16:43] had flags
[2:16:44] all through them and i went back over
[2:16:47] everything
[2:16:49] because because it was said
[2:16:52] that a lot of us don't know what god's
[2:16:55] really going to do in this end time
[2:16:58] and it challenged me and i went back and
[2:17:00] said have i
[2:17:01] missed the boat am i in
[2:17:04] the wrong way am i heading the wrong
[2:17:07] direction
[2:17:09] and i went through all of them and you
[2:17:10] come to the last one
[2:17:13] and again it jumps out at me again
[2:17:17] the hour will soon arrive
[2:17:20] when right among us will be the holy
[2:17:23] spirit will speak out like it did and
[2:17:25] ananias of fire
[2:17:26] remember the hour is arriving
[2:17:30] now you just remember that see god is
[2:17:33] going to dwell among his people
[2:17:35] that's what he wants to do now
[2:17:39] now that's what god wants to do amen
[2:17:43] right now he wants to dwell among his
[2:17:45] people
[2:17:46] and show himself the same yesterday
[2:17:49] today and forever
[2:17:50] and it's not a false hope to tell those
[2:17:53] that are
[2:17:54] crippled or blind i don't care how long
[2:17:56] you've been in a situation
[2:17:58] i say let's stir up the gift of god in
[2:18:01] us
[2:18:01] and begin to believe that all things are
[2:18:04] possible
[2:18:05] to them that believe
[2:18:09] hallelujah amen is there anybody else
[2:18:13] who said that's what i want
[2:18:14] i want that revival i want to stir up
[2:18:17] that gift of god in my life
[2:18:19] i want to rise to the occasion
[2:18:22] i want an awakening complete and totally
[2:18:26] in my life i want to surrender of my
[2:18:28] heart
[2:18:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:18:33] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[2:18:37] as you're standing here in the music
[2:18:38] sessions head this way
[2:18:41] brother branham said again in 1962
[2:18:45] he said he says now
[2:18:49] he said in the church to keep the church
[2:18:52] in line with the word apostles prophets
[2:18:54] teachers evangelist pastors officers of
[2:18:56] the church
[2:18:58] god sent not man called god's sin
[2:19:01] inspired men to keep the church lined up
[2:19:03] now what is it gifts of the spirit of
[2:19:05] the church not a bunch of fanaticism
[2:19:08] and oh god the last thing i want is a
[2:19:11] bunch of outbreak of azusa street
[2:19:14] nonsense and impersonation serious
[2:19:18] amen if a real church was ordained of
[2:19:20] god really filled with the holy ghost
[2:19:23] and sin would appear in the church it'd
[2:19:25] be another anonymized sapphire i'd like
[2:19:27] to walk into one
[2:19:29] see all the women and man under the
[2:19:30] power of the holy spirit if somebody
[2:19:32] had done something wrong the holy spirit
[2:19:35] would rise up and reveal it they'd have
[2:19:36] to clean up
[2:19:37] that's gifts of the spirit in the church
[2:19:39] oh god send us a church like that
[2:19:43] again in 61 backing up another year
[2:19:47] i wanted to see come to church and long
[2:19:49] to see it
[2:19:51] or walk in the back door front door
[2:19:52] wherever it is and look across the
[2:19:54] audience and see a perfect church all in
[2:19:56] order
[2:19:56] and sin couldn't stay there no spirit
[2:20:00] the spirit would call it out you see it
[2:20:02] just couldn't stay like another sapphire
[2:20:04] you couldn't do it there'd be no sin in
[2:20:06] that group
[2:20:07] see the spirit would speak it like
[2:20:09] quickly speak it like that
[2:20:10] no matter how it was how little it would
[2:20:13] be done see men and women there under
[2:20:15] the power of the holy spirit
[2:20:16] the spirit of god moving perfectly
[2:20:18] somebody done something wrong in the
[2:20:20] congregation
[2:20:21] they come quickly and confess it before
[2:20:22] the spirit got a hold of it to confess
[2:20:25] it
[2:20:25] and come tell it because they knew right
[2:20:27] then it was going to be called
[2:20:31] amen and then he went on to tell
[2:20:35] why ananiasis fire isn't called he said
[2:20:37] because they're the heaviest high payers
[2:20:39] in the church
[2:20:41] and a lot of times sin is sitting there
[2:20:43] because
[2:20:44] the pastor and the minister is afraid to
[2:20:46] call out against it
[2:20:54] we got today message girls
[2:20:58] running playing soccer and shorts
[2:21:01] that's a disgrace and it's because of
[2:21:04] backsliding in the pulpit or either that
[2:21:06] people won't listen
[2:21:10] boys and girls are allowed to wear
[2:21:12] shorts around the home
[2:21:14] it happens here backslidden parents it
[2:21:18] ain't the kids that are backslidden
[2:21:20] they ain't never got anywhere it's the
[2:21:22] parents that are backslidden
[2:21:25] a lot of times there's a backslidden mom
[2:21:27] that won't back daddy up while he's away
[2:21:29] from home that's why it's important
[2:21:31] that's why it's important that they'll
[2:21:33] be ahead of the home
[2:21:35] and there be a structure in the family
[2:21:37] and keep that family under the token
[2:21:43] it's time for men to for come to jesus
[2:21:46] meeting dad
[2:21:48] because you know men are still
[2:21:49] responsible no matter what what has
[2:21:51] happened you let your wife do something
[2:21:54] you let her cut her hair you're
[2:21:55] responsible for it
[2:21:57] and you need to come to jesus meeting
[2:22:00] amen come on styles have changed so now
[2:22:04] that
[2:22:04] that dresses are above the knees
[2:22:08] girls cutting their hair to shoulder
[2:22:10] length
[2:22:12] hey that's been preached by those who
[2:22:15] claim to be in the message
[2:22:17] teachers it's okay to cut your hair as
[2:22:19] long as it's just you know to the
[2:22:21] shoulder
[2:22:24] god of this evil age brother branham
[2:22:26] said this is 1965 just before he lives
[2:22:29] you say you said cutting hair what's
[2:22:32] that got to do
[2:22:34] brother let's just stop a man i feel
[2:22:35] somebody was in it might be on a wire
[2:22:37] somewhere
[2:22:40] a hair to a woman is an azerite vowel
[2:22:43] hairdo samson was an azerite vowel when
[2:22:45] a woman cuts off her hair
[2:22:46] she absolutely denies her nazarite vow
[2:22:49] that she is a bride to christ
[2:22:53] because that one thing she spoils the
[2:22:56] whole picture just that one day
[2:22:58] she spoils the whole picture same thing
[2:23:01] when a man wears long hair
[2:23:05] amen
[2:23:10] brother smith back there was in prison
[2:23:15] a tape got to him he was vain and proud
[2:23:18] of his long hair
[2:23:20] is that right chris remember but you
[2:23:23] heard the word preached
[2:23:25] and what happened you surrendered to the
[2:23:27] word
[2:23:28] your hair came off
[2:23:32] amen come on that's exactly right you
[2:23:35] see
[2:23:35] again here is another right vow to a
[2:23:38] woman
[2:23:40] and he said a samson was consecrated to
[2:23:42] an age and a purpose therefore he had
[2:23:44] long hair
[2:23:45] the woman that's a child of god lets her
[2:23:47] hair
[2:23:48] grow to show she is consecrated
[2:23:51] to every word of god
[2:23:55] if she cuts it off i don't care how much
[2:23:58] she dances sings
[2:23:59] is in the choir speaks in tongues runs
[2:24:01] up and down
[2:24:02] has all kinds of age society she is dead
[2:24:07] that is thus saith the lord the word of
[2:24:10] god
[2:24:11] first corinthians 14 she's denied her
[2:24:14] nazarite violence sold out to the god of
[2:24:16] this modern age
[2:24:17] she does it now shame on you lady or
[2:24:19] woman
[2:24:24] think of something to play i'll preach
[2:24:26] all day
[2:24:29] okay i will thank you i'll preach to
[2:24:32] luke
[2:24:34] because if you think having un
[2:24:37] cut hair is an option think again
[2:24:42] like some pentecostal girl said to me in
[2:24:44] the hospital when
[2:24:45] karen was in the hospital and she come
[2:24:47] in
[2:24:49] and she said well you know some of our
[2:24:51] church believes like y'all but
[2:24:53] we don't say that's in the law i said it
[2:24:55] isn't in the law
[2:24:57] paul taught that
[2:25:01] and paul said if i if a prophet or
[2:25:03] someone thinks he's spiritual
[2:25:05] let him acknowledge what i said to be
[2:25:07] the truth
[2:25:09] so let's just read it
[2:25:13] first corinthians 11 14 don't nature
[2:25:15] itself teach you that if a man have long
[2:25:17] hair
[2:25:18] it's a shame to him chris that was a
[2:25:20] shame and you cut off your shame
[2:25:26] but if a woman have long hair it is a
[2:25:28] glory to her for harry has given to her
[2:25:30] for a
[2:25:31] covering and he's just covered it
[2:25:35] he just covered exactly what the hair
[2:25:37] was to be it was to be the covering
[2:25:39] not some wrap on your head your hair
[2:25:46] [Music]
[2:25:49] but if a man's seam
[2:25:52] if any man seem to be contentious
[2:25:56] we have no such customs neither the
[2:25:59] church of god
[2:26:00] [Music]
[2:26:04] so paul said and says he summed it all
[2:26:08] up
[2:26:08] and he said it like this all right this
[2:26:11] is how
[2:26:12] things are done in all of god's churches
[2:26:17] and that's why i said that none of you
[2:26:19] should argue about what i have said
[2:26:22] [Music]
[2:26:28] let me read it again that's how things
[2:26:31] are done in
[2:26:32] all of god's churches and that's why
[2:26:35] none of you should argue about what i
[2:26:37] have said
[2:26:39] it's undebatable case closed
[2:26:43] you say brother branham i get shut up
[2:26:46] brother brandon didn't do nothing he
[2:26:47] just said what paul said
[2:26:51] it's a bible truth
[2:26:55] but i want to tell you there's people
[2:26:57] that are getting ready for the dynamics
[2:26:59] so well brother tim i got the dynamics
[2:27:02] 15 years ago praise god
[2:27:03] hallelujah you know the holy ghost well
[2:27:06] it's time to stir it up
[2:27:08] crank up that gift of god and wake up
[2:27:10] jesus in your boat
[2:27:13] again listen to this he said
[2:27:17] what's and what shall we do with jesus
[2:27:19] called christ he said god's little flock
[2:27:22] that believes the word its mechanics is
[2:27:24] ready to
[2:27:26] it's ready for the dynamics to set it a
[2:27:29] fire with the holy ghost
[2:27:30] fear not little fluff it's your father's
[2:27:33] good will
[2:27:33] to give you the kingdom the holy ghost
[2:27:36] will strike
[2:27:37] a little church
[2:27:40] that's come out from the world women
[2:27:43] that have wears long hair
[2:27:45] nazarite to prove they're separated from
[2:27:48] the world
[2:27:49] oh i want to tell you there's a flock
[2:27:51] that believes and has the mechanics
[2:27:53] ready
[2:27:53] and ready for the dynamics to set it
[2:27:56] fire with the holy ghost
[2:28:00] hallelujah i believe we're
[2:28:01] pre-destinated for this time where
[2:28:03] where he says we're going to see a
[2:28:05] church
[2:28:06] without move that the church when it
[2:28:09] gets to its place
[2:28:10] are you ready to take your position amen
[2:28:13] then
[2:28:13] that's when philistines will go to
[2:28:16] backing up
[2:28:18] amen the shorts will go off the hair
[2:28:21] will grow down
[2:28:22] the faces will be washed cigars will be
[2:28:25] missing that's right when the church
[2:28:27] begins to get in this mighty power
[2:28:29] when they have an ananiasis of fire a
[2:28:31] few of them
[2:28:32] when you'll see that when the holy
[2:28:34] church stands together
[2:28:35] in its power positionally placed as sons
[2:28:38] of god adopted in the family of god
[2:28:40] a powerful church standing there in his
[2:28:42] glory oh
[2:28:43] that's what he's coming for
[2:28:48] hallelujah that's what he's coming for
[2:28:54] that's what he's coming for

[2:53:05] with all your heart
[2:53:07] amen well as i told you you know we
[2:53:11] we started out this whole thing and we
[2:53:14] we were certainly getting out of room in
[2:53:16] our old building that was in
[2:53:18] i told you i was building this for
[2:53:19] prodigals to come home
[2:53:22] and man there was a space there for
[2:53:24] brother vic
[2:53:26] amen there's space there forever
[2:53:28] repented of heart and
[2:53:30] and you know here's some time ago i
[2:53:32] guess it was october god turned his life
[2:53:34] around and
[2:53:35] he'd been showing fruits of that you
[2:53:38] know
[2:53:39] and so we thank god for those fruits
[2:53:42] that he's shown
[2:53:43] but today he wants to make everything
[2:53:46] clear and
[2:53:47] everything right amen leave nothing
[2:53:50] unturned he knows that he has done
[2:53:53] everything
[2:53:54] full requirement and of course he's been
[2:53:57] baptized before
[2:53:58] as a young man but today he comes now
[2:54:02] you know sincerely a surrender in his
[2:54:06] life
[2:54:06] to god and and say i want to
[2:54:10] walk in the newness of life that the old
[2:54:13] man is dead and i'm new in christ jesus
[2:54:17] and i'm going to walk in the newness of
[2:54:19] life brother vic the lord jesus sent me
[2:54:22] into the world to preach the gospel and
[2:54:24] he said that these signs would follow
[2:54:26] them that believe and
[2:54:28] we believe that this is one of the signs
[2:54:30] that demons would be cast out
[2:54:32] and people would be saved you know it's
[2:54:34] it takes the casting out of satan
[2:54:37] to feel one with the holy ghost amen
[2:54:40] because
[2:54:41] god won't dwell in the unclean vessel
[2:54:43] and with satan in there and of course we
[2:54:45] know the enemy has
[2:54:46] left you and you are now free to walk in
[2:54:49] the newness of life

[2:54:54] testimony today

[2:54:59] and to demonstrate his word
[2:55:02] and he said he said commissioned me
[2:55:05] to go forth and baptize them in the name
[2:55:08] of the father and of the son and the
[2:55:10] holy ghost
[2:55:11] and in obedience to that divine command
[2:55:14] that jesus
