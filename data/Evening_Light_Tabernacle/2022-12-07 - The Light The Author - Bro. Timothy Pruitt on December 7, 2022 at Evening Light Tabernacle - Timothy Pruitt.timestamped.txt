[42:12] getting married this weekend it's hard

[42:20] to be in that this weekend and amen to
[42:23] God it just blessed them as they unite
[42:25] together amen if you could we wouldn't
[42:27] need some help just moving some tables
[42:29] and chairs down to the gym if you would
[42:33] for that would appreciate it Hebrews
[42:35] chapter 12 and verse 2 looking unto
[42:38] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[42:42] faith who for the joy was set before him
[42:45] endured the cross
[42:47] despising the shame and is set down at
[42:51] the right hand of the Throne of God Amen
[42:54] we'll let you be seated
[42:59] it's like to speak to you tonight on the
[43:01] light the altar amen I'm glad he's the
[43:05] author
[43:06] amen I'm glad he's the writer I I'm
[43:09] thankful he's the composer of life
[43:11] amen because he's a righteous God he's a
[43:14] holy God he's he's got our best interest
[43:16] at heart amen and you know I would hate
[43:19] to know that the devil had the pen and
[43:21] he was able to write and he was able to
[43:24] to make you what he wanted you to be but
[43:26] amen but God is truly the one in control
[43:29] and therefore we can have great
[43:31] confidence today to know that all things
[43:33] are working together for our good you
[43:36] know as the author God is complete is in
[43:39] complete control of Our Lives therefore
[43:42] he knows the beginning he knows the
[43:45] first breath and he knows the last
[43:47] breath he knows how you will begin and
[43:50] he knows how it's all going to end
[43:52] he knows what needs to be in place in
[43:54] our lives to untangle the not of sin
[43:57] that is in us to make us more like him
[43:59] therefore he also has other mem other
[44:02] characters along that'll come alongside
[44:04] of us be there for some time and then be
[44:07] gone later because he is in control he
[44:10] can put people where he wants them to be
[44:12] he can put them in one chapter in
[44:14] another chapter they be taken out but or
[44:17] or he bring this one or that one but
[44:19] either be good or bad but it's all
[44:21] working for our good you know some of
[44:24] these people help us in our journey some
[44:26] of these people hinder us Upon Our
[44:28] Journey but in every moment God provides
[44:31] a way for us to stay on the right path
[44:34] you know God also knows what lies ahead
[44:37] of us he will even allow trials to come
[44:40] in our life that is to make us stronger
[44:42] and ready to face the next chapter amen
[44:46] you know throw in through the whole
[44:47] story the author our God is with us
[44:50] matter of fact he's not as an author if
[44:53] you would write a book you could make a
[44:54] man certain way have certain attributes
[44:57] and you can have certain people in that
[44:59] book but you the author could never
[45:01] become a part of that book it may be
[45:04] your dreams it may be what you think or
[45:06] you know something that you've been
[45:07] dwelling on but God actually in this
[45:10] book became a part of this book as we
[45:13] read here the author and finisher but he
[45:16] also for the joy that was set before him
[45:18] endured the cross so he became part of
[45:22] the story he became part of the book
[45:24] amen despising the shame and is set down
[45:27] at the right hand of the Throne of God
[45:29] Amen so he knows he's not just a
[45:32] bystander or somebody that's can open a
[45:35] cover and close the cover or write it
[45:36] write a few lines and put it down but
[45:39] God has actually put himself in the
[45:41] story amen so he knows what lies ahead
[45:44] of us he knows what we have to go
[45:46] through amen he isn't just watching our
[45:49] story unfold but he is guiding it he is
[45:52] moving along amen and intimately a part
[45:55] of it I'm thankful he's a part of my
[45:58] life and nothing that happens to you
[46:00] ever takes God by surprise amen but God
[46:04] allowed it as an author to be able to
[46:06] come to you in a certain chapter of your
[46:08] life a certain line of your life that
[46:10] God would put things there amen and
[46:13] direct you a certain way and one thing
[46:15] that makes me very happy to know that
[46:17] amen that God the author knows the end

[47:02] situation that would arise Amen to get

[47:17] exactly all of his trials and stumbles
[47:19] that he tries to put in your way

[47:23] it in the previous chapter God will
[47:26] bring you to a point in your life to

[47:36] around it or even over it amen this is
[47:38] the kind of God that we serve amen you

[47:45] characters with no doubt love to ask in
[47:47] a book why am I this why don't you make
[47:49] me this way why do I look like this why
[47:52] is this you know but unlike the author's
[47:54] characters I know the author of my life
[47:57] and he's already written my entire story
[48:00] amen he sees how my life will intersect
[48:03] with the lives of others and how
[48:05] meetings will change us both and each
[48:08] thread of my story God is weaving it
[48:10] together for the ultimate ending amen
[48:14] every one of us is an important part in
[48:16] the story of Life the Story would be
[48:19] incomplete if one of us is absent so
[48:22] when the dark times come know this God
[48:24] knows how it's all going to work out in
[48:27] the end
[48:29] Hallelujah he has a plan and we are
[48:32] every one of us part of it it doesn't
[48:34] matter whether you feel like you're the
[48:36] main character you're this character
[48:38] that character we're all characters in
[48:40] the story of God and every one of us is
[48:43] important as God writes our life and and
[48:46] when he puts the end on the story it'll
[48:49] be a masterpiece that'll leave us all in
[48:52] all and give him all the glory amen what
[48:56] an author that we have what a God Amen
[48:58] this author puts you in this book not to
[49:01] destroy you not to tear you down not to
[49:03] leave you forsaken but he puts you here
[49:06] to bring you to an expected End Amen
[49:09] this author has already got the end in
[49:11] his mind therefore he knows he's already
[49:13] eroded he's already wrote about the Lake
[49:15] of Fire he's already wrote about the
[49:18] devil and his destruction he's already
[49:20] wrote about your Ascension and your
[49:22] change and your glory he's already wrote
[49:24] about all those things and he's bringing
[49:27] about at his expected him amen Psalms 2
[49:30] and verse 7 would say I would declare a
[49:32] decree the Lord has said unto me thou
[49:35] art my son and this day I have begotten
[49:40] thee or I have authored thee or I have
[49:43] created thee amen and you are my son
[49:46] ain't you glad that he put you in that
[49:48] story not as a thief or a robber
[49:50] somewhere or somebody that was bound for
[49:53] hell and destruction but in this story
[49:55] God put you here as a son
[49:58] now the devil's all going to try to come
[50:01] and destroy that and bring you down and
[50:03] put marks on you but God put you in the
[50:06] beginning as a son and at the end when
[50:09] it says the end you'll still be a son
[50:12] and it doesn't matter what happens all
[50:14] in between God will have the altar he is
[50:17] the author therefore he puts every comma
[50:20] he puts every explanation point he puts
[50:23] every period he puts everything in your
[50:25] life there is nothing that the devil has
[50:28] any kind of control over you amen he can
[50:31] put things he can try he can try to
[50:33] destroy but God has the right to write
[50:36] your life how he wants to write your
[50:38] life what a God we serve Amen brother
[50:41] Brandon would talk about light he said
[50:43] no life what could come outside of light
[50:46] and we know that amen if you turn the
[50:49] sun off today light would cease or life
[50:51] wouldn't cease to exist life light light
[50:53] produces life they're connecting there
[50:57] can be no life outside sort of outside
[50:59] of light natural or spiritual it must be
[51:02] the only light that can come by the word
[51:05] of God God's word is the light when it's
[51:08] manifested nothing can live natural or
[51:11] spiritual without his light and his word
[51:14] is light and life amen when he sends his
[51:18] light he makes it known to the people
[51:19] and then it's rejected then what about
[51:21] that he said that's what we want to talk
[51:23] about this morning is rejected in this
[51:25] life by them saying rejecting it behold
[51:27] us my servant in whom I've delighted in
[51:29] he's alive he's the light of the world
[51:32] and that light brings life
[51:35] amen so we know that the author the
[51:37] light amen it brings life to the body
[51:40] amen and then it controls it how it
[51:42] grows how it comes and how it is amen
[51:45] and everything is working according to
[51:47] how the composer has put it on the
[51:49] script amen when you may think sometimes
[51:52] we're just going to go our own way amen
[51:54] but no you're going to go the way the
[51:56] composer has wrote your life you think
[51:58] well I'm going to do a certain thing I'm
[52:00] going to be a certain way and I'm going
[52:01] to I'm gonna I'm gonna have a certain
[52:03] this or that a certain job certain death
[52:05] amen you can only do as a composer as
[52:09] place it in your life amen you know it
[52:11] ain't about the you know there's the
[52:13] characters don't get mad at the composer
[52:15] they just act out what the composer has
[52:17] given them to act out
[52:20] amen and no matter how simple or how eat
[52:23] little it may seem to you every part of
[52:26] this book of life is important but we
[52:28] see you know in the Symphonies of of
[52:30] life and we see that we are actually in
[52:33] a great composing a symphony of life and
[52:36] there's different things that are
[52:38] sounding Out brother man would talk
[52:39] about it in the Peter and the Wolf the
[52:41] Russian Symphony he said these he said
[52:43] they have these little figures and he's
[52:45] trying to explain it right quick to
[52:46] Children he said they have these little
[52:48] figures flying around playing out
[52:50] playing it on the drums and the drums
[52:52] knock a certain beat then they change
[52:54] and knock another certain bee and make
[52:56] the drums and sounds and things it plays
[52:58] it out it acts that way so you can
[53:01] understand your little children he said
[53:02] but now to you adults the scriptures are
[53:05] God's Symphony Hallelujah only the
[53:09] composer knows what it really means and
[53:11] it reveals it to those who are listening
[53:15] he reveals it to those that are
[53:17] listening who are interested in knowing
[53:19] what the drama is
[53:23] Hallelujah that are interested in
[53:25] knowing what the drama is but you have
[53:28] to know about a symphony first it's not
[53:30] just something to change in this that
[53:32] and the other it seems like a bunch of
[53:34] Racket and a bunch of B but if you
[53:36] wouldn't understand it you wouldn't know
[53:37] what it was just sound like just a bunch
[53:39] of fuss and a bunch of nothing but to
[53:41] those who know what it is they're
[53:44] watching for it they know what's coming
[53:47] [Applause]
[53:48] amen and so we have these times of
[53:51] Symphonies of the Symphony of God's word
[53:53] that whole drama changes you who are
[53:56] interested in listening for the change
[53:58] you know it's getting close you hear the
[54:01] way the drums are beating
[54:04] amen you want something to happen you
[54:07] know this is a change it's going to
[54:08] break out and it's going to burst in a
[54:10] few minutes here Washington watching for
[54:12] it you can tell it because the way the
[54:15] drums are timing
[54:16] amen he said if you can hear the drums
[54:19] of the finish right now
[54:22] Hallelujah if you can hear the echo the
[54:25] music of the Heavenly word singing
[54:27] itself out and it shall come to pass in
[54:30] the last days I shall pour out my spirit
[54:32] upon All Flesh amen what is it it is the
[54:35] drums of the symphony being poured out
[54:38] it is the author writing the story
[54:42] man can try to change the story and they
[54:44] can try to make it a bunch of
[54:45] intellectual ideas and this that and the
[54:48] other but they ain't the author the
[54:50] author said I'm going to pour out my
[54:52] spirit upon All Flesh I'm gonna amen my
[54:56] son shall prophesy and my daughter shall
[54:58] speak in tongues amen I'm going to do
[55:00] this this is the word of the Lord this
[55:03] is the author speaking
[55:06] you know just going through the Bible
[55:08] reading we're listening this morning to
[55:10] the to Joseph as he would come to his
[55:13] brothers and he would you know it was a
[55:15] man that was put in a script
[55:17] and his brothers didn't like the part he
[55:20] was given
[55:21] but it wasn't up to their brothers it
[55:23] was up to God
[55:25] amen he was given a certain part and and
[55:28] it happened to be a favored part it had
[55:31] to be seemed like the father's favor was
[55:33] all on for him and he always got the
[55:36] best clothes and he got the coat of many
[55:38] colors and and he loves him more than
[55:40] and then he loves us and all of this
[55:42] amen they were angry at Joseph not
[55:45] knowing they were really angry at the
[55:47] composer after one who was writing the
[55:50] script and and Joseph would go to bed
[55:52] and he would come back and he said look
[55:54] I had a dream and in this dream there
[55:56] were you we all were gathering weed and
[55:58] we got our sheaves together and every
[56:00] one of your sheaves bowed over to my
[56:02] sheep well what do you mean you're gonna
[56:04] you're gonna bow down to you who do you
[56:06] think you are he was only telling him
[56:09] what the composer was trying to let them
[56:11] know
[56:13] amen and so he finds himself in the
[56:16] bottom of a pit now in Joseph's mind
[56:18] this man not I'm sure it wasn't the way
[56:20] he thought his his story was ever going
[56:22] to end up or be he never thought a
[56:25] favored son would ever be down in a pit
[56:26] out of the favorite song to be back on
[56:28] on the back of a camel with his hands
[56:30] tied heading off to Egypt sold into
[56:33] slavery that wasn't his thought of a
[56:35] good story but the composer was there
[56:37] writing the story
[56:39] and he was putting Joseph in a pit he
[56:41] was putting Joseph on a camel he was
[56:43] putting Joseph in Potiphar's house and
[56:46] it seemed like he was just a slave but
[56:47] the composer was right in his life and
[56:50] it changed it to where he was not just a
[56:52] slave but he was head of Potiphar's
[56:54] house and man this is getting the stores
[56:56] getting better and all of a sudden
[56:57] there's a villain that comes along
[56:59] potterford's wife and starts accusing
[57:01] him of things and next thing you know
[57:03] the composer is wrote him right down
[57:04] into jail
[57:08] and it seems like my goodness what is
[57:10] going on with my life
[57:13] and all of a sudden the composer wrote
[57:16] two more people in jail and he puts them
[57:19] down there amen the wine uh the man that
[57:22] gave the wine to the king and the man
[57:24] who baked the bread and he said and then
[57:26] they they have dreams and and they want
[57:28] to know what it's all about and Joseph's
[57:30] like well this is what it means and he
[57:32] tells them all you're going to live and
[57:33] you're going to die
[57:38] sure that one guy was like man I want to
[57:40] I want a different different dream
[57:44] but there wasn't in Joseph's hands and
[57:47] it wasn't in his hands it was in the
[57:49] composer's hands
[57:51] and he said well I tell you what you
[57:53] that's going to live when you get to
[57:55] Pharaoh you remember me he forgot
[57:59] why did he forget because the composer
[58:01] made him forget
[58:04] amen do you realize every part of our
[58:07] Lives amen the light is directing you
[58:11] whether you're in a pit or whether
[58:13] you're sold down into slavery or whether
[58:15] it seems like all hell is against you
[58:17] the author still has the pen
[58:22] the author still has the ability to
[58:25] write you right out of that situation
[58:28] Hallelujah and one day this author is
[58:31] going to write us right into a body
[58:33] change
[58:34] right into the change of dimensions
[58:41] and Pharaoh has a dream
[58:45] and Pharaoh has his dream of seven good
[58:48] cows and seven skinny cows and the Seven
[58:50] skinny cows eats up the seven good cows
[58:52] and and it goes on and and he's like
[58:57] somebody tell me what this means
[59:03] and you know all of a sudden the
[59:05] composer
[59:08] and the man finally remembered
[59:10] what Joseph had asked him to do in the
[59:13] jailhouse
[59:15] oh there was a guy down in that jail you
[59:19] know why I'm here because there was an I
[59:21] had a dream and he told me exactly and
[59:23] it came to pass exactly like he said he
[59:26] said go get me that man and he brings
[59:28] Joseph until he writes his life all the
[59:31] way to second in command
[59:35] amen all the way to second in Command
[59:37] right under Pharaoh the composer put him
[59:40] there why because there were some
[59:42] children that was over there in the land
[59:45] and the composer had wrote a verse in
[59:48] their life how they was going to be in a
[59:50] Strange Land for 400 years but with a
[59:52] strong and mighty hand I'm going to
[59:54] bring him back out again
[59:56] Hallelujah and so he had a Joseph to go
[59:59] get a land ready for them
[1:00:02] Hallelujah I go to prepare a place for
[1:00:05] you that where I am there you may be
[1:00:08] also
[1:00:09] because he knew God I will have a people
[1:00:12] that'll be in the desert out in laodicea
[1:00:15] and they're going to need a place to go
[1:00:17] and I'm going to write it down here in
[1:00:19] my word and I'm going to fulfill it
[1:00:23] therefore I'm going to prepare for them
[1:00:25] before they ever get there
[1:00:29] he's a composer he knows how to write
[1:00:32] your life
[1:00:34] amen the Symphony of God's great job
[1:00:37] Brahman is playing it changes his
[1:00:39] Symphony at the junction the composer
[1:00:42] and those that are interested and
[1:00:44] listening for the change
[1:00:46] listening for the change not griping at
[1:00:50] the change
[1:00:51] listening at the change
[1:00:53] you know it's very easy right now to
[1:00:56] gripe about who's in charge
[1:00:59] hey I'll tell you what that Biden sorry
[1:01:01] sap sucker
[1:01:03] Dome is a box of rocks that's true
[1:01:08] and they got this woman and vice
[1:01:10] president and this that and the other
[1:01:12] and look at Russia what they're the
[1:01:14] composers put them all there
[1:01:17] the author has put them in power
[1:01:21] he said Terry lifts kingdoms the
[1:01:24] Kingdom's up and he tears kingdoms down
[1:01:27] amen amen just I it just struck me so
[1:01:31] deeply as I was lit looking at that
[1:01:33] again about those three wise men brother
[1:01:35] Brandon said the reason why they were
[1:01:37] looking for that light he said because
[1:01:39] hundreds of years before that Daniel had
[1:01:42] been exiled down there
[1:01:44] and he began to tell them about things
[1:01:47] that were to come he began to explain
[1:01:49] amen there's a messiah coming there's a
[1:01:52] deliverer coming and God's going to
[1:01:53] bring great Deliverance back to Israel
[1:01:56] again and he left Scrolls down there and
[1:01:58] he left promises down there and he said
[1:02:00] there were men there to believe those
[1:02:02] things
[1:02:04] the composer was writing these things
[1:02:10] we see way back Yonder
[1:02:13] not long ago when that church age was
[1:02:15] being drawn out
[1:02:17] and he was writing
[1:02:21] he
[1:02:22] you know people get
[1:02:24] disillusioned by the by the the the
[1:02:27] Israel of how they went to the Holocaust
[1:02:32] and it looks and it's very terrible been
[1:02:34] there been through some of the same
[1:02:35] streets they walked on in the death
[1:02:37] camps it's not a fun place really to go
[1:02:40] but I I've seen all that stuff and and
[1:02:43] it's very easy to get why would God
[1:02:45] allow this why would God allow men and
[1:02:49] women to be marched off of trains and
[1:02:51] separated families separated women
[1:02:53] children this way men go this way unable
[1:02:56] bodies go this way well bodies go this
[1:02:58] way and some go right straight to the
[1:03:00] Dead the gas Chambers to a very quick
[1:03:03] death While others would die a month by
[1:03:06] month by day by day
[1:03:09] why would God allow that
[1:03:11] because there was a composer that was
[1:03:13] writing a story
[1:03:15] and there had to be something that would
[1:03:18] drive them put a drive in them to make
[1:03:21] them want to go back to a Homeland
[1:03:24] they had it all there in Germany they
[1:03:27] had it they had the wealth they had they
[1:03:29] wasn't they wasn't trying there to go
[1:03:31] find a piece of dirt nice especially out
[1:03:33] there in Israel nothing but a desert
[1:03:35] they didn't want none of that they was
[1:03:37] comfortable where they was at so God the
[1:03:39] composer said okay I'm going to bring
[1:03:41] the world system to this point and
[1:03:44] you're going to be put in this place so
[1:03:45] something to begin to fall on the inside
[1:03:48] of you to say I want a Homeland
[1:03:51] I want a place for my children to grow
[1:03:54] up and not have to worry about going
[1:03:55] growing up and going to a death camp I
[1:03:58] want my children to better grow up and
[1:04:00] not have to worry about being put in a
[1:04:01] gas chamber I want a safety for my
[1:04:04] children I want peace for my children I
[1:04:06] want to land for my children and brother
[1:04:09] Adam picked it up and he said that was
[1:04:10] nothing but the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:04:14] writing their story so they would get On
[1:04:17] Eagle's Wings and go to their Homeland
[1:04:20] [Applause]
[1:04:22] Hallelujah and he said that ain't gonna
[1:04:24] be that kind of force it's not going to
[1:04:26] put us in our homeland
[1:04:28] no sir amen but he's right in our lives
[1:04:31] he's bringing it to a certain point amen
[1:04:34] I don't know about you but you get
[1:04:35] something some moments of your life it
[1:04:37] seems oh wow everything's wonderful but
[1:04:39] them things start dipping down a little
[1:04:41] bit
[1:04:42] you're like I'm so sick of this place I
[1:04:45] don't want no more of this place I want
[1:04:47] to get out of here what is it is a
[1:04:50] composer get
[1:04:52] for all
[1:04:55] whoo hallelujah it's a Homeland Where
[1:04:58] Your Children won't ever die it's a
[1:05:00] Homeland where they won't ever be put in
[1:05:02] torture chambers and gas chambers that
[1:05:04] means the life be sucked out ever but
[1:05:07] God rich and mercy has went to prepare
[1:05:10] us a place and he's brought us to a
[1:05:12] place
[1:05:14] he's bringing us to a body change
[1:05:19] we've seen the composer in our day the
[1:05:22] word wrote in the last days in the days
[1:05:25] of the seventh angel in the church age
[1:05:27] the seventh angel Masters will be the
[1:05:30] last message
[1:05:31] and we saw the composer write it in
[1:05:33] Revelations 10. in the days of the
[1:05:36] message of the seventh angel the mystery
[1:05:38] to God shall be finished the seventh
[1:05:40] seal would be pulled back
[1:05:42] it should be there then all at once it's
[1:05:44] happening a vision breaks go to Tucson a
[1:05:47] great noise will take place it'll shake
[1:05:49] the Earth near to all of you know amen
[1:05:51] it's been there about months before it
[1:05:53] happened then it happened appeared in
[1:05:54] the sky shalom
[1:05:57] it's changing beats a symphony it's
[1:06:00] moving another notch
[1:06:04] Hallelujah and one time he said about
[1:06:07] the third poll how it come by this way
[1:06:09] and by knowing the heart and then the
[1:06:10] spoken word Jesus said greater things
[1:06:13] than this will go will you do for I go
[1:06:15] to my father The Works that I do shall
[1:06:17] you do also but greater than this for I
[1:06:19] go to my father just as I said a while
[1:06:21] ago when Mary tried to identify him as
[1:06:23] Joseph's son he corrected her his word
[1:06:26] cannot fail he said so heavens and earth
[1:06:28] will fail but my words will not
[1:06:32] oh Hallelujah that gives us great
[1:06:35] confidence in this author if he's
[1:06:37] writing the words they're not going to
[1:06:38] fail
[1:06:40] if he said to him that overcometh in the
[1:06:44] seventh Church age amen there's got that
[1:06:46] means there's going to be that's a lot
[1:06:47] of the composure that's put there for a
[1:06:49] reason to give you faith that somebody
[1:06:52] is going to overcome this age
[1:06:57] it's beating
[1:07:00] the composer begins to beat
[1:07:02] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:07:06] and greater shall you do greater he
[1:07:09] promised it will be
[1:07:12] you notice when he performed his first
[1:07:14] miracle he took water and turned it to
[1:07:16] wine
[1:07:17] he took water which potentially someday
[1:07:20] might be wine but it was water
[1:07:22] then when he fed five thousand what did
[1:07:24] he do he took something that had been
[1:07:27] like water and he took fish that once
[1:07:29] swam and was born from an egg and he
[1:07:31] broke it another fish growed into
[1:07:33] creation that was of the original
[1:07:35] creation he took bread that was once
[1:07:37] wheat was once seed and become bread and
[1:07:40] he broke bread and he bypassed all the
[1:07:42] bacon and all the growing and he
[1:07:44] multiplied it just as it was already
[1:07:48] but in this day he took something that
[1:07:51] was nothing that was nothing and said
[1:07:53] let there be squirrels and there was
[1:07:56] amen greater than these things shall you
[1:07:58] do for I go unto my father not take
[1:08:00] something that's been created break
[1:08:02] something from it but show amen as he
[1:08:05] said let there be light
[1:08:10] the world don't understand that it says
[1:08:13] it's a bunch of nonsense
[1:08:15] because they're not you know their
[1:08:17] methodists don't understand it Baptist
[1:08:19] Catholics Pentecostals
[1:08:22] but those who wait on the Lord
[1:08:25] those that are looking
[1:08:29] for his star
[1:08:31] not one man that we have in history of
[1:08:34] any observative deservatory knowing that
[1:08:36] the star has passed over but the wise
[1:08:38] man followed it for hundreds of miles
[1:08:40] for two years they watched it and
[1:08:43] followed it it is those who are
[1:08:45] listening to the symphony
[1:08:51] there's other beats that are taking
[1:08:53] place right now it's called A World beat
[1:08:55] and they're they're beating there's a
[1:08:57] drum being beat right now
[1:09:00] of Destruction
[1:09:02] you hear it every day
[1:09:04] nuclear power talked about more than
[1:09:06] it's ever been talked about
[1:09:08] threatened more than it's ever been
[1:09:09] threatened amen what are they doing
[1:09:11] they're beating the Drone
[1:09:13] amen there's a beat that's going on you
[1:09:15] see men or women that are filing right
[1:09:18] into this beat and they're getting
[1:09:19] sucked in to laodicea and Spirits Sodom
[1:09:22] and gomorrah's spirits and every kind
[1:09:24] and they're identifying as a cat and a
[1:09:26] dog and this that and the other come on
[1:09:28] somebody
[1:09:29] they are walking to the beat of the
[1:09:31] world to Satan's Eden but there's also
[1:09:34] another Rhythm that's going on
[1:09:36] amen there's a rhythm that the bride is
[1:09:39] listening to
[1:09:41] amen there was preview one was walking
[1:09:43] the rock what marching the rock and roll
[1:09:45] and one was marching on with Christian
[1:09:47] Soldiers
[1:09:48] one was dressed holy in righteousness
[1:09:51] and one was dressed and barely anything
[1:09:53] that would cover her amen what was it it
[1:09:55] was the church world and the Bride of
[1:09:57] Jesus Christ they each one had a rhythm
[1:10:00] but one Rhythm was going to hell and the
[1:10:02] other Rhythm was going to heaven
[1:10:05] you say well I tell you right now we
[1:10:07] don't need that rock and roll church
[1:10:08] music in our church well then what what
[1:10:10] is rock and roll music go listen to the
[1:10:12] world
[1:10:15] God Church world I'm talking about go
[1:10:17] listen to The Simple Church right over
[1:10:19] here in Shreveport Louisiana
[1:10:21] listen to their music
[1:10:22] you know what their music is
[1:10:24] New Year's revolution
[1:10:27] they play in The Beatles music
[1:10:31] you know what their music is
[1:10:34] The Gospel According to Michael Jackson
[1:10:39] this preview of this woman hardly had
[1:10:43] any resemblance at all
[1:10:46] just something holy or righteous
[1:10:49] Godly
[1:10:52] I know we're so quick to point where I
[1:10:54] can roll out to different ones in the
[1:10:56] secular world now that's rock and roll
[1:10:57] you need to look a little deeper
[1:11:00] them people actually are still
[1:11:02] worshiping God
[1:11:04] to their best of their abilities and the
[1:11:06] best of their knowledge and wanting to
[1:11:08] do something for the Lord
[1:11:11] sure they may have their music beat up
[1:11:13] and they may do a few things we wouldn't
[1:11:15] do or many things we wouldn't do amen or
[1:11:18] we wouldn't play I don't but I'm going
[1:11:19] to tell you something amen you tell me
[1:11:21] who inspired the composer inspired
[1:11:24] somebody to write these are the days of
[1:11:26] Elijah
[1:11:29] who inspired that
[1:11:31] it was the composer because only the
[1:11:33] composer knew what was on the book
[1:11:37] Hallelujah it was a composer that that
[1:11:41] wrote amen How Great Is Our God come
[1:11:43] sing with me how great is our God it was
[1:11:46] the composer gifts and colleagues or
[1:11:48] without repentance
[1:11:56] because look what the church world is
[1:11:58] doing now
[1:12:00] they're going back to Michael Jackson
[1:12:02] they're going back to the Beatles
[1:12:03] they're going back to Elvis Presley and
[1:12:07] it's unbelievable
[1:12:10] rock and roll
[1:12:12] remember
[1:12:14] the composer knows the end from the
[1:12:17] beginning
[1:12:19] he knows all about it that's the reason
[1:12:21] he can write it
[1:12:24] so you must begin with him you must
[1:12:26] begin you want to hear a symphony you
[1:12:29] must begin with him like in the music of
[1:12:31] the symphony you know what it says is
[1:12:33] going to be in the symphony you might
[1:12:34] begin to listen to the music you know
[1:12:36] here's a certain certain thing takes
[1:12:38] place and then it's going to change and
[1:12:40] then it's going to be somebody just
[1:12:42] walked in would think of just a bunch of
[1:12:43] noise and rattling going on but those
[1:12:45] who know what the beat is
[1:12:48] those who knows what the beat is and the
[1:12:50] sound of the trumpet and the drum and
[1:12:52] the whole thing together in the Rhythm
[1:12:54] it makes the drama too you can close
[1:12:56] your eyes and live in it he said man
[1:12:59] could close his mortal eyes to Earthly
[1:13:01] sight and live in the presence of Jesus
[1:13:03] Christ when you see his word begin
[1:13:05] beating out in the great Symphony that
[1:13:07] we're now living in changing you must
[1:13:10] begin on the symphony you must begin on
[1:13:12] the Rhythm
[1:13:14] you must get in the rhythm of what's
[1:13:16] going on he said you had to become a
[1:13:19] part of the dance Amen to get out of the
[1:13:21] dance you had to become part of the ball
[1:13:23] game something that you become
[1:13:25] interested to get in the ball game you
[1:13:27] have to become part of the word to know
[1:13:29] God's Symphony
[1:13:32] to know it's all working together for
[1:13:34] your good
[1:13:38] his Symphony
[1:13:39] is when it's playing you're marching
[1:13:42] with the beat of the time you're
[1:13:44] watching for it the works that I do
[1:13:46] shall you do also and greater than this
[1:13:49] shall you do is changing of time we get
[1:13:52] into the beat the beat of the word
[1:13:55] amen the beat of the word find his
[1:13:59] purpose find the hour they're living in
[1:14:00] we're living in and get into the rhythm
[1:14:02] of it get into the rhythm of his word
[1:14:05] amen find out what he said find out what
[1:14:08] he said about dress and get into the
[1:14:09] rhythm of it find out what he said about
[1:14:11] church attendance and get into the
[1:14:13] rhythm of it find out what he said in
[1:14:15] his word and get into the rhythm of his
[1:14:18] word
[1:14:25] it was a rhythm taking place in Jesus
[1:14:28] day and the beat would change
[1:14:31] and he would say unless you drink my
[1:14:34] blood and eat my body you have no part
[1:14:36] with me it was a there was a beat that
[1:14:39] changed
[1:14:40] and there was something that didn't want
[1:14:41] to go along with that beat
[1:14:44] and they walked away
[1:14:46] so this was a hard save
[1:14:48] a lot of a lot of make-believers walking
[1:14:50] away they didn't know the symphony but
[1:14:53] there was one amen as he looked at those
[1:14:56] others there was around him and said
[1:14:57] well you also go
[1:14:59] they looked and said where else are we
[1:15:02] going to go
[1:15:03] only you have the words
[1:15:08] only you have the words to My Life only
[1:15:11] you have the Rhythm only you have a
[1:15:14] sympathy sympathy only you are able to
[1:15:17] put the periods and the commas and put
[1:15:19] it only you where else could we go
[1:15:23] come on little bride where else could we
[1:15:26] go
[1:15:27] amen where else can we go to find the
[1:15:29] word beating exactly in order
[1:15:33] amen we ain't got to tear part of the
[1:15:35] Bible out and say it's not inspired we
[1:15:37] believe it's all inspired
[1:15:42] because the author wrote it
[1:15:45] and if the author wrote This Book
[1:15:48] and he was inspired he's inspired on all
[1:15:50] of it
[1:15:52] I know something you know in the world
[1:15:54] think well he wasn't inspired when he
[1:15:55] wrote you know wrote put in there mark
[1:15:57] 16. they shall lay hands upon the sick
[1:16:00] and they shall recover but I remember
[1:16:01] that little story of that woman who had
[1:16:04] heard about that you know it's had a
[1:16:05] sickness and she heard that there was
[1:16:07] some that would would pray for her and
[1:16:09] her son went off some Theological
[1:16:10] Seminary and he was studied on all these
[1:16:13] things and and he had heard his mom was
[1:16:15] sick so he comes home and he finds her
[1:16:17] just sitting there singing and having a
[1:16:19] good time he's like Mom I thought she
[1:16:20] was six he said oh I was he said well
[1:16:22] what happens to him well there was a
[1:16:24] little church down there on the corner
[1:16:26] that they said that they believed in
[1:16:28] Mark 16 and they would come lay hands on
[1:16:30] the sick and they shall recover and they
[1:16:32] come in here and they laid hands on me
[1:16:34] and I got well praise the Lord he said
[1:16:36] oh Mom in seminary we learned that that
[1:16:38] wasn't inspired that woman went to
[1:16:41] shouting
[1:16:42] went to glorifying God he said Mama you
[1:16:45] done lost your mind she said well I just
[1:16:46] got to thinking if God could heal me on
[1:16:49] some uninspired what could he do with
[1:16:51] some inspired
[1:16:54] come on somebody this word is inspired
[1:16:58] when he said I'm the Lord God that heals
[1:17:01] all thy diseases it's inspired amen when
[1:17:05] he said by his stripes I'm Healed it's
[1:17:08] inspired
[1:17:09] [Applause]
[1:17:11] it says they shall lay hands upon the
[1:17:14] sick and they shall recover don't get
[1:17:16] mad at me I'm just marching in tune with
[1:17:19] the symphony
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:26] he's the author
[1:17:28] man is not the author man tries to come
[1:17:32] along and change the script
[1:17:34] but he ain't the one
[1:17:36] no no they said well this is a hard
[1:17:37] saying we can't understand it who can
[1:17:39] understand it we know you're just a man
[1:17:41] we with you we sleep with you we went in
[1:17:44] the woods with you we're By the Waters
[1:17:45] you're merely a man this is a hard
[1:17:46] saying they didn't know the beat
[1:17:50] they didn't know the Rhythm that he was
[1:17:52] God's manifested he was God manifested
[1:17:55] In the Flesh for he was a Vindicated
[1:17:58] word light of the hour and they didn't
[1:18:00] get it said it was a hard thing we
[1:18:02] notice again there was Judas the
[1:18:04] unbeliever that always was waiting
[1:18:06] around till he found enough fault and he
[1:18:09] turned to the disciples in just the 12
[1:18:10] is and Judas was one of them said you
[1:18:12] want to go too and Peter said where
[1:18:15] would he go Lord You're the composer you
[1:18:18] know how it's going on you're the only
[1:18:20] one that has the word of life where it
[1:18:22] can we turn to we couldn't go back to
[1:18:24] being a Pharisee I don't want to be no
[1:18:26] sad to see or wrote in whatever it might
[1:18:28] be you're the one who has eternal life
[1:18:32] we have no other place to go
[1:18:40] we joined ourselves to this great
[1:18:42] Symphony we're listening we're in Rhythm
[1:18:45] we believe that you are the Son of God
[1:18:47] the Manifest of Jehovah we're sure of
[1:18:49] this we don't know what these great
[1:18:51] trials and troubles and afflictions and
[1:18:52] things you're saying we're going going
[1:18:54] to be offered up and all this other
[1:18:55] stuff and on the third day you're gonna
[1:18:56] we don't know how it's going to be we're
[1:18:59] just marching along with the symphony
[1:19:01] because we know you got it in control
[1:19:04] God has got it God's able more than able
[1:19:08] in any situation
[1:19:09] amen amen he said you know in a symphony
[1:19:12] they have a sheet in their hand he said
[1:19:14] they're trying to look back to the
[1:19:15] beaten all portion of it's already been
[1:19:17] played out he said that's for what other
[1:19:19] churches do today they're always looking
[1:19:21] back on the Sheep music he said but we
[1:19:23] should be here playing our part right
[1:19:25] now he said that's what Luther is trying
[1:19:27] to do they try to look back at what amen
[1:19:30] what Luther did or what Wesley did the
[1:19:32] Westlands and they want to look back and
[1:19:34] Pentecost want to look back or we had it
[1:19:36] back then but what about now
[1:19:43] the bait's changing
[1:19:48] the composer changed the script
[1:19:52] I know man wants to come in and play and
[1:19:55] say well you know we still got the tapes
[1:19:57] and we still got this
[1:19:59] I didn't take him off the scene the
[1:20:01] composer did
[1:20:05] but the script has changed the beat has
[1:20:08] changed and they're missing it
[1:20:13] amen they missed the beat
[1:20:17] amen many people ask why why why must
[1:20:20] these things happen why does this happen
[1:20:23] to me why did that when I start in this
[1:20:25] I've had this trouble here this upset me
[1:20:28] here and I've lost this why
[1:20:30] he said I used to ask why is a young
[1:20:31] Minister first started out why did God
[1:20:34] take my wife right from under me why did
[1:20:36] he take my baby right out from beneath
[1:20:38] right beneath my heart why did he do it
[1:20:40] I don't know
[1:20:44] I didn't know
[1:20:46] but I do now I've just held my hand it
[1:20:51] is and I keep trusting him because he is
[1:20:54] a composer
[1:20:58] he knows every Junction
[1:21:01] he knows every Tyrant he knows every
[1:21:04] flip of the page
[1:21:06] he knows every chapter
[1:21:08] he knows every line
[1:21:10] he knows where to get you and molds you
[1:21:13] on the backside of a desert he knows
[1:21:16] where to get you in a trial amen that
[1:21:18] certain things can be manifested in your
[1:21:20] life he is the composer
[1:21:25] he's the author God knows when the
[1:21:27] rhythm of us got to change he knows how
[1:21:30] the Rhythm goes
[1:21:32] he knows exactly how it would be well I
[1:21:35] just I it's just I just didn't see it
[1:21:38] coming many are the afflictions of the
[1:21:40] righteous
[1:21:43] hear the beat
[1:21:45] many are the afflictions of the
[1:21:47] righteous but God delivers them out of
[1:21:50] them all
[1:21:53] elujah God has moved through history
[1:21:56] with rhythm and he's moved one inner
[1:21:58] into something and then right out of it
[1:22:00] he moved he moved David right down into
[1:22:03] a Goliath deer right down into a valley
[1:22:05] to fight Goliath but he moved him right
[1:22:08] out of it
[1:22:09] Hallelujah he moved Daniel right down
[1:22:12] into a lion's den but he moved him right
[1:22:14] out of it he moved three children down
[1:22:17] into a fiery fire amen buddy he moved
[1:22:20] him right out of it
[1:22:22] oh Hallelujah he moved the children of
[1:22:24] God down through the Dark Ages to where
[1:22:27] they would give their life and he moved
[1:22:29] them right out of it
[1:22:31] Hallelujah don't you think for a moment
[1:22:34] he's moved you into this place to leave
[1:22:37] you here and to walk away from the
[1:22:39] script but he's going to finish the
[1:22:41] story
[1:22:43] he's going to finish every line he's
[1:22:46] going to replace every promise every one
[1:22:48] of them will be fulfilled
[1:22:52] he is the author
[1:22:56] the author can change the script
[1:23:00] if he wants to change something he can
[1:23:02] do it he can change the rhythm of Our
[1:23:04] Lives praise God for that
[1:23:07] every one of us coming to this world
[1:23:09] born in sins our heartbeat had a
[1:23:12] different rhythm
[1:23:13] it was beaten according to the world and
[1:23:16] it was heading down a World's Road
[1:23:18] dancing to a World's tomb
[1:23:21] headed for Destruction headed for death
[1:23:24] headed for hell but the altar came down
[1:23:31] he said Aaron Oglesby was once born in

[1:26:35] of the Living God
[1:26:39] every man or woman that's born of the
[1:26:41] spirit of God and washed in the blood of
[1:26:42] Jesus Christ and believes every word of

[1:26:50] uh
[1:26:52] Hallelujah
[1:26:56] oh what a mighty God we serve

[1:27:04] and a man come took my place
[1:27:06] I cannot die for that sin
[1:27:09] somebody took it
[1:27:12] so the author was looking at our story
[1:27:15] and he says somebody's got to die
[1:27:23] somebody's got to come and take the
[1:27:24] penalty of sin
[1:27:27] let me put my name in there
[1:27:32] he shall bruise his heel but then he
[1:27:35] shall bruise his head
[1:27:38] let me put mine put me in there
[1:27:42] unto you
[1:27:44] was born this dead child
[1:27:49] a child
[1:27:52] the author knows how to write it
[1:27:55] because if he would have come down with
[1:27:57] a ten thousand Angel salute
[1:27:59] and a red carpet and come into Caiaphas
[1:28:02] and said I'm here
[1:28:03] whatever devil in hell would have known
[1:28:05] who they were who he was
[1:28:06] but the author pulled the wool over
[1:28:09] there villain's eyes
[1:28:12] and he slipped it right in there
[1:28:15] going to be born in a stable
[1:28:17] an old manure pile
[1:28:19] and I'm going to take on you and flesh
[1:28:22] and I'm going to become him
[1:28:24] so he can become me
[1:28:29] and my first words are going to be wow
[1:28:33] yeah
[1:28:35] wow
[1:28:37] and the villains looking at
[1:28:42] just
[1:28:43] I could be anybody else that can't be
[1:28:46] him there's no way in the world it's
[1:28:50] impossible that this God
[1:28:55] Angels come on come on around here let's
[1:28:56] talk we was there we
[1:28:59] there's no way
[1:29:01] that that
[1:29:05] it is if the author's writing it
[1:29:09] and he writes it right down in there and
[1:29:11] he steps out
[1:29:14] and one day it was Jehovah running down
[1:29:17] the road falling down and skinning his
[1:29:20] knees
[1:29:22] it was Jehovah crying like a baby in a
[1:29:25] Manger it was Jehovah that was sitting
[1:29:28] on the side of a rock with a headache
[1:29:32] it was Jehovah that dealt with every
[1:29:35] kind of peer pressure it was Jehovah
[1:29:37] that dealt with those that walked away
[1:29:39] and left him to where he died on the
[1:29:42] cross alone
[1:29:48] Jesus the word took my place
[1:29:52] he became me that a sinner like I might
[1:29:54] become him
[1:29:56] oh let me hold too true to it not the
[1:29:59] church to the word that spiritual union
[1:30:01] of Christ in his church when the flesh
[1:30:03] is becoming word and the word is
[1:30:05] becoming flesh manifested Vindicated
[1:30:07] just what the Bible said what happened
[1:30:09] in this day it's happening day by day
[1:30:12] we're near the coming of Jesus to be
[1:30:15] United with his church where the word
[1:30:16] becomes the word call of the Holy Spirit

[1:30:37] and rewrite every bit of your life
[1:30:41] and take it all away to where you never
[1:30:43] did it in the first place you were
[1:30:45] accused of it by the accuser but really
[1:30:47] from the beginning you were
[1:30:48] predestinated to be a son or daughter of
