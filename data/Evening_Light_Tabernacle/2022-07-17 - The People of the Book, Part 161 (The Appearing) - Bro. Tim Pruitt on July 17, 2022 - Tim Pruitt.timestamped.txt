[17:16] debbie parris's nephew wren having
[17:18] seizures
[17:19] and the doctors are doing tests to
[17:21] figure out the calls
[17:23] we'll remember him today
[17:24] also a prayer request from sister sarah
[17:27] fields
[17:28] i would like to pray for
[17:30] from her and sister amy for their aunt
[17:33] margie in critical condition following a
[17:36] abdominal
[17:37] bypass
[17:39] she uh
[17:40] she i don't know all the medical terms
[17:42] but she has significant amount of
[17:43] swelling in her
[17:44] abdomen and we're just praying that the
[17:47] bypass provides the blood flow flow
[17:49] needed to her abdomen abdomen so we will
[17:53] be having another surgery today and
[17:54] tomorrow to perform another bypass so
[17:58] she's been through surgeries going
[17:59] through more and just asking for prayer
[18:02] also brother kelly hildebrand pastor
[18:05] there in saskatchewan
[18:07] request prayer for his grandson isaac
[18:10] uh he's been sick this real sick young
[18:13] man he's only 12 years old
[18:15] and sick nearly all of his life and he's
[18:18] if you look at him you wouldn't think he
[18:19] was 12 because he's real
[18:21] small and petite because of his sickness
[18:24] but they're doing a colonoscopy and
[18:26] and other procedures as well on this
[18:29] next coming wednesday
[18:31] doctors are saying they need to take the
[18:32] colon completely out and put the bag on
[18:35] the outside and
[18:36] that'd be a lifetime thing and
[18:39] so we're just asking the lord to
[18:40] intervene on his behalf
[18:42] i believe he's that kind of god
[18:45] i know he's a healer
[18:47] i know him to be a healer and he's not
[18:49] just a healer he's also a creator
[18:52] and he i've seen him create new hearts
[18:55] and new livers and
[18:57] you know uh just thinking of a testimony
[19:00] at brother wendell martens of a of a
[19:02] lady that had come out of the world and
[19:04] her liver was shot
[19:06] because of all the things she had done
[19:08] and the drugs or whatever she'd done and
[19:10] just killed her liver and a drinking
[19:13] but in her salvation god gave her a new
[19:15] liver
[19:16] well i believe he's still that same god
[19:18] today
[19:20] if
[19:20] if any of you would meet isaac you would
[19:22] love him instantly he's just a real
[19:24] loving
[19:25] young boy even through all that he's
[19:27] went through and she has a lot of love
[19:29] to give and to show
[19:31] so my heart really goes out to him today
[19:33] and
[19:34] just ask the lord to come on the scene
[19:36] for his behalf how many would have a
[19:39] knee just sort of make it known to the
[19:40] lord that's brother aaron if he'd come
[19:42] and just open our service this morning
[19:44] let's pray together

[54:31] eighth verse and
[54:33] then we will
[54:34] have just a couple of announcements and
[54:36] go forward today
[54:38] genesis
[54:40] genesis 18 and verse 1
[54:43] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[54:46] plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent
[54:48] door of in the heat of the day
[54:51] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[54:53] loved three men stood by him and when he
[54:57] saw them he ran to meet them from the
[55:00] tent door and bowed himself toward the
[55:02] ground
[55:03] and said my lord if i have now found
[55:06] favor in thy sight
[55:08] pass not away i pray thee from thy
[55:10] servant
[55:11] let a little water i pray you be fetched
[55:14] and wash your feet and rest yourselves
[55:17] under the tree
[55:19] and i will fetch a morsel of bread and
[55:22] comfort ye
[55:24] uh your hearts after that you shall pass
[55:26] on for therefore are you come to your
[55:29] servant and they said so do as thou hast
[55:33] said and abraham hastened
[55:36] into the tent unto sarah and said make
[55:40] ready quickly three measures of fine
[55:42] meal
[55:43] kneaded and make cakes upon the heart
[55:46] and abraham ran unto the herd and
[55:49] fetched a can a calf tender and good and
[55:52] gave it unto the young man and he
[55:54] hastened to dress it
[55:56] and he took butter and milk and the calf
[55:59] which he had dressed
[56:01] and set it before them
[56:03] and he stood by them under the tree
[56:06] and they did eat
[56:07] amen god bless you we're going to let
[56:09] you have your seats
[56:12] amen we want to

[57:08] going to be hanging it in the foyer for
[57:10] you to see and as you can see it's a
[57:12] it's a great oak tree
[57:14] and this is what i've been telling you
[57:16] evening light tabernacle this is what we
[57:18] are we're an oak tree
[57:20] one time we were just a little seedling
[57:22] a little acorn you know and sometimes
[57:25] when god gives a promise to you that's
[57:27] what he does he just gives you an acre
[57:29] you ask for an oak tree he gives you an
[57:31] acre and it's under your care and you
[57:34] water it and and believe for it and
[57:36] and it grows into a mighty tree well
[57:39] under a tree like this you know the
[57:41] birds come and enjoy the branches and
[57:43] people come and sit under it and enjoy
[57:46] the shade from the heat of the day and
[57:49] and this is what we want to be at
[57:51] evening light tabernacle today there are
[57:53] people joining in with us from all over
[57:56] the world and will be a part with us in
[57:59] this service today and in the service
[58:01] today we we have visitors among us from
[58:05] texas and oklahoma and north carolina
[58:07] and
[58:08] and um
[58:09] arizona so we got you know just a little
[58:12] smattering of gathering from here and
[58:14] there but they've all come to rest under
[58:17] our tree today
[58:18] and we want you to feel welcome and be
[58:20] feel that you're a part with us
[58:22] this is what we aspire to be here at
[58:25] evening light tabernacle is as an oak
[58:27] tree and someone that that the weary the
[58:31] the sick
[58:33] the needy the lost can come and find
[58:36] refuge amen so thank you sister rebecca
[58:39] for this it's a it's a great treasure to
[58:42] me thank you very much god bless you
[58:44] amen isn't god good to us
[58:47] he gives us so many blessings
[58:51] and
[58:52] today we're going to be
[58:54] looking into the scripture
[58:56] if you notice i didn't read about el
[58:58] shaddai this morning i
[59:00] i've taken now into the next chapter
[59:03] because there is so much in here that is
[59:06] prophecy
[59:07] of the last day
[59:09] and so we're going to be looking into
[59:11] certain aspects of the scripture and the
[59:14] promises that abound for this end time
[59:18] par a part of our journey
[59:21] and of course the the churches has been
[59:24] traveling the old testament church was
[59:26] started in genesis and they were types
[59:29] and shadows and were pointing toward our
[59:31] day and then it would come into the new
[59:34] covenant in the new testament and so
[59:36] since the uh
[59:37] if he's in age the church has traveled
[59:40] and now has grown and i believe that we
[59:43] today as a as a body of christ around
[59:46] the world
[59:48] we should be a mighty oak tree
[59:50] starting on the day of pentecost from
[59:53] from an acorn that was planted and now
[59:56] its branches should be reaching up a man
[1:00:00] that's the tree of life
[1:00:02] we look around and we see the tree of
[1:00:04] knowledge and good of good and evil has
[1:00:06] reached its height well the bride tree
[1:00:09] ought to also be reaching its height in
[1:00:12] this day and hour
[1:00:13] now of course um as we read about
[1:00:16] abraham we're going to be speaking about
[1:00:18] the visitation and that's what the part
[1:00:21] we're going to be looking at this
[1:00:22] morning because
[1:00:24] as you know
[1:00:25] there had been visitations before
[1:00:29] to abraham one was el shaddai that we
[1:00:32] spoke about the others were
[1:00:34] other appearings that he had made but
[1:00:37] here abraham is
[1:00:39] representing his seed and he's
[1:00:41] representing the seed of abraham today
[1:00:44] remember when we look at the bible we're
[1:00:47] not looking at that at it as just a
[1:00:49] historical book we're looking at it as a
[1:00:52] prophecy
[1:00:54] and we begin to realize that we are the
[1:00:56] interpretation
[1:00:58] of that prophecy
[1:01:00] amen one time it was tongues now it is
[1:01:04] interpretation you say why tongues it
[1:01:06] was symbolic it was written in mysteries
[1:01:09] it was a hidden truth but in this day
[1:01:13] and hour is no longer a mystery or
[1:01:16] hidden truth but now it has been
[1:01:19] revealed been made known to us
[1:01:22] so you see um when when we see abraham
[1:01:26] representing his seed i don't want you
[1:01:29] to think of it as one man but seed
[1:01:32] meaning the seed of christ the
[1:01:35] multi-member body you say well i see one
[1:01:38] man there whose name was uh had with
[1:01:41] seven letters and ended in 8 a.m and you
[1:01:45] know like abraham
[1:01:47] but and yes but this represents
[1:01:51] all of the elect
[1:01:53] you see abraham's seed to whom has been
[1:01:56] made heir of all things
[1:01:59] and if it was just to brother branham
[1:02:02] h.a.m
[1:02:04] you so then then we might as well just
[1:02:06] close our bible and go home because it
[1:02:09] all got fulfilled in him
[1:02:11] but it doesn't it's about a bride
[1:02:14] and it's about a visitation to the seed
[1:02:17] of abraham in this last day and brother
[1:02:20] branham only just happened to be one of
[1:02:22] the members of that seed of abraham or
[1:02:25] that body of christ
[1:02:27] so you see
[1:02:28] but this is the apex
[1:02:31] if you're reading in genesis this would
[1:02:34] be the apex of all the visitations of
[1:02:37] god the summit the capstone the highest
[1:02:40] point of all the appearings
[1:02:44] and it concludes with the coming of the
[1:02:47] promised son
[1:02:48] so now this is the day that we're living
[1:02:51] in we are not living in a parcel
[1:02:53] revealing
[1:02:55] or a partial appearing or uh uh just a a
[1:03:00] little portion given but now we are at
[1:03:03] the apex of the summit
[1:03:05] we have reached the capstone the highest
[1:03:09] point of all the appearings of god and
[1:03:12] it concludes with the coming back of
[1:03:15] jesus christ who is the head of the body
[1:03:18] and head of all things so this with even
[1:03:21] to abraham would be the last appearing
[1:03:25] of god to abraham until the ultimate
[1:03:28] test when when isaac was a young man and
[1:03:31] he would type out calvary but that's a
[1:03:33] whole set of different types
[1:03:35] as i've said about types you've got to
[1:03:37] know where to begin them and where to
[1:03:39] end them so let's just talk about this
[1:03:41] for a minute when we we realized that
[1:03:44] the types now will end in this part of
[1:03:47] the types will end with this summit this
[1:03:50] climax of this appearing and the coming
[1:03:53] sun
[1:03:54] all right now again you know that it it
[1:03:58] will then again we'll have another type
[1:04:00] a little later of calvary and where that
[1:04:04] isaac the promised son is taken up to up
[1:04:07] on top of the heel of moriah and there
[1:04:10] he is to be offered and a lamb is put in
[1:04:13] his place but see that's a different
[1:04:15] type now if you if you'd if you run
[1:04:19] those types together let me explain
[1:04:21] about this for a minute if you ex if you
[1:04:23] run those types together then you will
[1:04:27] have after the coming sun after the
[1:04:30] change of the body after the rapture the
[1:04:33] hardest test ever
[1:04:37] which would be the offering of the sun
[1:04:40] right so it has to end here with this
[1:04:43] climax and the other is a separate type
[1:04:46] amen so abraham does type the bribe but
[1:04:49] after the rapture we're not going to
[1:04:51] have a hardest test
[1:04:52] amen we're going to enjoy a millennial
[1:04:55] amen we're going to enjoy new heavens
[1:04:57] and a new earth
[1:04:59] testing is over when our bodies are
[1:05:01] changed
[1:05:02] so you've got to run types in continuity
[1:05:05] and know when they begin and where they
[1:05:07] end
[1:05:09] all right so now this was the greatest
[1:05:11] of all appearance and he had appeared
[1:05:14] already as a shady eye the pouring out
[1:05:17] of the holy ghost but now this pouring
[1:05:20] out of the holy ghost it crescendos into
[1:05:24] god
[1:05:25] manifest in human flesh
[1:05:28] amen and this would be the capping off
[1:05:31] of all of the visitations of elohim
[1:05:34] god had led him from the era of the
[1:05:36] chaldeans appearing in the land of his
[1:05:39] fathers and and this would cause abram
[1:05:42] the idol worshiper to start seeking a
[1:05:45] city whose builder and maker was god
[1:05:49] but you see in all of the visitations
[1:05:52] from the age of 75 whether it was by
[1:05:55] voice or by dream or by
[1:05:58] visions of elohim this now was the
[1:06:01] greatest for now god was
[1:06:04] manifest in the flesh
[1:06:07] here god comes walking in a fleshly body
[1:06:11] and so this manifestation was more real
[1:06:15] more physical
[1:06:17] for here it was like the fullness of all
[1:06:19] the manifestations of the divine
[1:06:22] presence when the word was made flesh in
[1:06:25] jesus christ
[1:06:26] now and so let me say that the
[1:06:29] appearance of god in this last day is
[1:06:32] once again a culmination of all the
[1:06:35] appearings of god
[1:06:37] we can look back and see mighty revivals
[1:06:40] and mighty appearings
[1:06:42] and he appears to luther
[1:06:44] and he appeared to wesley and he
[1:06:46] appeared on azusa street but this is now
[1:06:50] the highest point the culmination among
[1:06:54] the summit of all the appearance and you
[1:06:58] are part of that appearing in this last
[1:07:00] day where god is appearing to you
[1:07:04] amen and it's not a mere baptism of the
[1:07:06] holy ghost but rather a capping off of
[1:07:10] the pouring out of the entire deity of
[1:07:12] god into his bride body
[1:07:16] hallelujah
[1:07:17] now this was happening in abraham's
[1:07:20] group
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:23] think of it brother timothy preached it
[1:07:25] wednesday night there is a man here
[1:07:30] a man present
[1:07:32] who can turn on the light
[1:07:34] no matter how dark it is
[1:07:36] no matter how many troubles there is
[1:07:38] he's not just coming he's here
[1:07:41] there's a man present here that can flip
[1:07:44] the switch anytime
[1:07:46] amen i'll tell you what if you were sick
[1:07:49] this morning you should be looking for
[1:07:50] him to flip the switch for you
[1:07:52] amen if you're lost this morning there's
[1:07:55] a man here who can turn on the light for
[1:07:57] you
[1:07:58] amen that can lift you up in the
[1:08:00] heavenly places
[1:08:02] now
[1:08:03] so there's a man here
[1:08:05] notice
[1:08:07] king theophany was appearing think of it
[1:08:10] king theophany a visible manifestation
[1:08:14] of god to humankind
[1:08:18] in this last day he's actually showed
[1:08:21] himself visible
[1:08:23] he's even allowed his picture to be
[1:08:25] taken of that supernatural being
[1:08:28] where you can even well you could even
[1:08:31] see it there it wasn't psychology
[1:08:34] light struck the lens
[1:08:36] hey amen there was actually a light
[1:08:38] hundreds saw the angel of god
[1:08:41] in 1946 right over here in camden
[1:08:44] arkansas just north of here here uh you
[1:08:47] know there was there was a brother adams
[1:08:49] that had brother branham to preach for
[1:08:51] him in the early days of his ministry at
[1:08:53] camden and he began to try to tell the
[1:08:56] crowd about the pillar of fire and the
[1:08:58] angel that had appeared how it was
[1:09:00] allied and how that there was a signed
[1:09:03] gift in his hand and of course you know
[1:09:05] they were just filled with unbelief they
[1:09:07] had never seen nothing like this never
[1:09:10] heard of a man who had an angel appear
[1:09:12] and frankly they were very skeptical
[1:09:15] but about that time from the back here
[1:09:17] it come the pillar of fire right down
[1:09:20] the aisle and as it did there was a
[1:09:23] crippled man in the aisle in a
[1:09:24] wheelchair and out of that chair he came
[1:09:27] as it passed over him and it come right
[1:09:29] up and reverend adams looked up and
[1:09:32] screamed out i see it i see it and it
[1:09:34] blinded him and down into the seat he
[1:09:36] went knocking him down
[1:09:39] oh no we don't believe in falling out
[1:09:41] today in the spirit but it happened with
[1:09:44] reverend adams when he saw the pillar of
[1:09:45] fire
[1:09:47] wasn't the devil either
[1:09:49] it was a pillar of fire
[1:09:51] amen now this was witnessed by hundreds
[1:09:56] it was hundreds
[1:09:58] actually saw the angel of god a
[1:10:02] manifestation of the supernatural
[1:10:05] and what does this show us
[1:10:07] king theophany is here among us
[1:10:11] amen about to
[1:10:13] bring all the theophanies from glory
[1:10:17] and they're going to step back in the
[1:10:19] flesh
[1:10:20] i hope you don't miss that
[1:10:23] and i hope you understood what i said
[1:10:25] king theophany is here
[1:10:27] amen and he he's come from from
[1:10:31] and he's going to bring with him the
[1:10:33] other theophanies
[1:10:35] and they will step right back in the
[1:10:37] flesh like sister karen and brother
[1:10:40] jerome and the other saints brother
[1:10:42] jerry shaw they're not dead they just
[1:10:44] stepped into their theophanies
[1:10:47] and they're about to step back in the
[1:10:49] flesh
[1:10:51] amen because of the appearing of king
[1:10:53] theophany
[1:10:55] appearing in the last days
[1:10:57] hallelujah
[1:10:59] the visit the visitation of the pillar
[1:11:01] of fire
[1:11:05] now in this appearing to abraham
[1:11:08] three theophanies stepped into bodies
[1:11:13] gathered
[1:11:14] then from the elements of the earth
[1:11:18] the the different
[1:11:21] the different parts brother branham
[1:11:22] would call it 16 elements
[1:11:25] cosmic lights and pot ass and calcium
[1:11:28] and whatever he gray he grabbed it
[1:11:30] together and it came and appeared to
[1:11:33] abraham
[1:11:35] i want you just to understand this
[1:11:37] supernatural god
[1:11:39] is the god able to gather the potters
[1:11:43] the clay
[1:11:44] the cosmic lights
[1:11:46] what once made up bodies
[1:11:49] of the saints
[1:11:50] and gather them back and theophany step
[1:11:53] in it
[1:11:54] that's going to happen the end
[1:11:56] disappearing
[1:11:59] are you with me
[1:12:01] now god's showing us in types and
[1:12:02] shadows here that theophanies are about
[1:12:05] to enter into view
[1:12:08] and when we see them we're going to be
[1:12:12] changed and receive christ the promised
[1:12:15] son and be translated to meet him in the
[1:12:17] air
[1:12:19] now brother branham visualized it like
[1:12:21] this
[1:12:22] he said i the only thing god did
[1:12:25] he said you tell me that down in sodom
[1:12:27] and gomorrah is getting very sinful
[1:12:30] and it's about time to show an example
[1:12:32] of what we're going to do in the world
[1:12:34] in the end time so here he comes and
[1:12:36] appears to abraham and and
[1:12:39] as he as he's coming he says you know
[1:12:42] the sin of sodom has reached to heaven
[1:12:47] you think it's just reaching your ears
[1:12:50] do you think it's just grieving you
[1:12:53] no it's grieving the heart of almighty
[1:12:55] god
[1:12:56] amen and it's causing him to come down
[1:13:00] brother branham called it an
[1:13:01] investigating judgment
[1:13:04] where god himself is investigating what
[1:13:07] is going on in america
[1:13:09] down in south africa over in asia and
[1:13:12] around the world where sodom is not a
[1:13:15] country
[1:13:16] or a city but sodom is a world condition
[1:13:22] i know i know you know america's going
[1:13:25] to burn by the time it's sodom the
[1:13:26] world's going to burn it's sodom
[1:13:30] i don't know if you've noticed but it's
[1:13:32] sodom out there it's sodom in your
[1:13:35] schools it's sodom in your neighborhood
[1:13:37] it's sodom and the world around you it's
[1:13:40] sodom on your jobs it's sodom everywhere
[1:13:43] and god said i've taken notice of it
[1:13:48] he did it in the days of noah before the
[1:13:50] destruction
[1:13:52] he's doing it now in this day
[1:13:55] amen
[1:13:56] and he's about to show an example
[1:13:59] that's what he was doing back there
[1:14:00] about to show an example of what he was
[1:14:03] going to do at the end time a burner
[1:14:05] with fire and brimstone
[1:14:08] and so he he calls over brother
[1:14:10] branham's used examples and he now these
[1:14:14] aren't true
[1:14:16] these aren't hard and and true facts
[1:14:19] right here of michael and gabriel
[1:14:21] because other times he'll use wormwood
[1:14:22] or one of the other angels so it's it's
[1:14:24] not these are not hard rules here these
[1:14:27] are examples he's he's typing it out he
[1:14:30] said come here gabriel and come here
[1:14:32] michael and he says step into that body
[1:14:35] just
[1:14:35] blows in step into that body and he
[1:14:38] pulls cosmic light and everything
[1:14:40] together now
[1:14:41] step into that body and then he made one
[1:14:43] for himself
[1:14:45] and when he was here he hungered like a
[1:14:47] man
[1:14:48] and he ate like a man and he vanished in
[1:14:51] the air in the presence of abraham and
[1:14:54] then went back to god again
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:01] now brother adam said god is like a
[1:15:03] great contractor
[1:15:05] he laid our bodies out here on the earth
[1:15:09] element needed to make our body
[1:15:14] he laid it out when he created the world
[1:15:17] i want just to say this to you your body
[1:15:20] was god's first
[1:15:25] and it was never intended for satan to
[1:15:28] dwell in
[1:15:31] amen that's why we got it right when
[1:15:33] sickness comes
[1:15:36] to say get out of here satan
[1:15:39] leave my body
[1:15:41] hallelujah because my body was there
[1:15:45] made by almighty god created and all of
[1:15:49] the elements was put right here on the
[1:15:51] earth
[1:15:53] to be gathered together for my time on
[1:15:56] the earth
[1:16:02] and get it ready for a theophany to come
[1:16:04] to since i did bypass mine
[1:16:10] now
[1:16:12] so he says
[1:16:14] he says now what am i made of petroleum
[1:16:17] and potash and calcium my body was
[1:16:20] laying on the earth
[1:16:22] well before there was anything that
[1:16:25] at all ever on the earth
[1:16:27] and when the holy spirit went forth
[1:16:29] before
[1:16:30] god to brood over the earth
[1:16:32] uh like like a a brood means to coo like
[1:16:36] a dove or a hidden mother and there was
[1:16:38] nothing but volcanic eruptions that god
[1:16:42] moved this old star around the sun and
[1:16:45] began making potassium calcium he's like
[1:16:48] a great contractor laying out his number
[1:16:52] to build his house
[1:16:55] and our bodies were on the earth right
[1:16:57] then

[1:17:10] you will dwell in in eternity's ahead
[1:17:14] the only thing it won't be mortal it'll

[1:17:24] me a holy roller anyhow you might as

[1:24:48] hey man he's sealed out
[1:24:56] hallelujah fort seal god's like a big
[1:25:00] contractor
[1:25:01] he lays out his material on the earth
[1:25:04] and begins building his material
[1:25:07] remember there's a grain of seed before
[1:25:09] there was a grain of seed on the earth
[1:25:10] before there was a sun ever struck the
[1:25:12] earth your body
[1:25:14] was laying on the earth because you were
[1:25:17] dust to the earth you are and god is the
[1:25:21] contractor
[1:25:23] now the way he was going to do it was
[1:25:25] reach down now here's how he's going to
[1:25:27] bring man from you said well brother tim
[1:25:29] if he didn't bring us through the womb
[1:25:31] of a woman and through sex desire then
[1:25:34] how he's going to do it the way he was
[1:25:36] going to do it was reach down
[1:25:39] and get like he did adam a little bunch
[1:25:42] of calcium and potash and cosmic light
[1:25:45] and
[1:25:47] blow into it

[1:25:55] amen there's another one
[1:25:57] but what did eve do she corrupted that
[1:25:59] way and she brought it to his sexual act
[1:26:03] and then that struck it
[1:26:06] now what is god doing he's got so many
[1:26:08] of those seeds down through there that's
[1:26:10] predestinated so much that is pre uh the
[1:26:13] predestinated and then at the end time
[1:26:16] and here we are are we in time
[1:26:18] he won't say eve come bear another child
[1:26:22] he will
[1:26:23] and call and i'll answer that's the idea
[1:26:26] and when the last one comes in
[1:26:30] that settles it
[1:26:34] hallelujah do you remember when he got
[1:26:35] ahold of your dust
[1:26:38] collected your dust
[1:26:40] and breathed the breath of life into you
[1:26:42] the baptism of the holy ghost

[1:28:23] your dust spiritually and breathe life
[1:28:26] into it then how much more will he also
[1:28:29] complete the work of redemption

[1:29:50] blow over our mortal bodies and our dust
[1:29:54] will be glorified in a moment and a
[1:29:57] twinkling of an eye
[1:29:59] so glorified so immortal they'll pass
[1:30:03] right through walls amen transcends
[1:30:06] dimension and travel like a thought and
[1:30:09] meet him in the air
[1:30:12] i say hallelujah
[1:30:20] while brother branham told us this he
[1:30:21] said you see these little pockets
[1:30:24] going through the air they call saucers
[1:30:27] they're little lights
[1:30:29] he said
[1:30:30] well we better leave that alone but you
[1:30:32] hear all these people coming up missing
[1:30:34] you see don't hear from them they're
[1:30:36] standing there and they're not there
[1:30:38] well that's the way the rapture is going
[1:30:39] to be
[1:30:40] now
[1:30:41] you know some of what they've come up
[1:30:42] with may not be true but this is true
[1:30:46] this part is true that's the way the
[1:30:48] rapture is going to be
[1:30:49] one of them will drop right down
[1:30:52] and this terrestrial body will take on a
[1:30:54] celestial body
[1:30:56] and there'll be hide hair or bones left
[1:30:58] it'll be transformed in a moment of time
[1:31:01] dropping right out of space and taking
[1:31:03] home that
[1:31:04] we see all of this going on the pentagon
[1:31:06] wondering about these lights and mystic
[1:31:08] lights and everything they're seeing in
[1:31:10] the sky you see they had one in the
[1:31:12] paper jeffersonville this week and so on
[1:31:14] a mystic light and so oh
[1:31:17] they don't know what that is
[1:31:19] but listen little children is going to
[1:31:21] pick you up
[1:31:23] one of these days
[1:31:25] hallelujah there is a light
[1:31:29] of theophanic light a theophanic
[1:31:31] appearance
[1:31:33] that's going to come to your mortal body
[1:31:37] and quicken it
[1:31:41] you see you see why we're in the climax
[1:31:44] you see why this is the summit
[1:31:46] you see this is at the end of the ages
[1:31:49] this is the last visitation of god
[1:31:56] what happened before sodom god came down
[1:31:58] with some angels and had an
[1:31:59] investigating judgment
[1:32:01] said i heard the cry it's so sinful it's
[1:32:04] so great i'll come to find out whether
[1:32:06] it's all together true or not
[1:32:08] amen you know
[1:32:10] you don't have to watch the news god
[1:32:12] already seen it
[1:32:16] that's one you can't do nothing about it
[1:32:18] anyway
[1:32:19] so why are you all worried about what's
[1:32:21] going on in the world
[1:32:24] amen god's seen it and he's come down
[1:32:27] amen amen what's but that main one
[1:32:30] stayed with abraham
[1:32:33] did you hear that the main one state
[1:32:37] amen amen the main one stayed with
[1:32:39] abraham could discern the thoughts it
[1:32:41] was in sarah's heart behind him and you
[1:32:43] look around a little bit and notice
[1:32:45] what's going on it's the same thing it's
[1:32:47] an investigating judgment why after the
[1:32:50] world after a while the church when it
[1:32:53] can stay in that place
[1:32:55] and every predestinated seed is brought
[1:32:58] to its spot
[1:32:59] they'll be gone
[1:33:01] and they won't know what happened to
[1:33:03] them
[1:33:04] one of them be going this way and
[1:33:05] another will be going to the pastor's
[1:33:07] house and one will be going on down here
[1:33:10] or down there and the first thing you
[1:33:12] know they're not there for evict was a
[1:33:14] type god took him and he was not found
[1:33:19] come down to investigate
[1:33:21] now what is he looking for when he's
[1:33:23] looking for you
[1:33:25] what is he looking for
[1:33:27] jesus told us what he would be looking
[1:33:29] for
[1:33:30] when the son of man cometh will i find
[1:33:34] faith
[1:33:36] this is what he's going to be looking
[1:33:38] for
[1:33:39] amen that's what these appearance now
[1:33:42] are for to turn your heart back to
[1:33:46] believing again
[1:33:50] now the continuity how the the inner
[1:33:53] translation and type of israel being
[1:33:55] carried over the ark that's noah and of
[1:33:57] course lot the which represents the the
[1:34:00] saved church not the bride
[1:34:03] but notice all of these are in the types
[1:34:06] they're all prophesied to be in the last
[1:34:08] day
[1:34:10] amen
[1:34:12] you know somebody asked me the other day
[1:34:14] are the foolish virgins among the bride
[1:34:16] in the message churches are fully are
[1:34:18] there foolish virgins i said well if
[1:34:20] they are they're very foolish
[1:34:25] it would be foolish
[1:34:27] to turn down the moving of the holy
[1:34:29] ghost
[1:34:30] the opportunity to be baptized with the
[1:34:33] spirit
[1:34:34] to be ignited with this fire
[1:34:37] it would be foolish to turn down the
[1:34:39] revelation of god in this hour
[1:34:44] but sometimes i wonder
[1:34:47] there's a part of me that just ponders
[1:34:49] maybe you know too much
[1:34:52] to be a foolish virgin
[1:34:57] i'll leave that with
[1:34:58] you i'll tell you what i wouldn't try to
[1:35:01] make it in by the skin of my teeth
[1:35:07] amen you said brother tim you know
[1:35:09] you're going to preach you're going to
[1:35:11] preach and it's going to produce the
[1:35:13] bride and and there be the church well
[1:35:15] i'll tell you what
[1:35:17] with all this within me
[1:35:20] ever since i've been a young boy
[1:35:22] i preached
[1:35:24] i preached for a bride
[1:35:27] calling
[1:35:28] not just be a church
[1:35:34] the last thing i want for you other than
[1:35:36] being lost forever is to be a
[1:35:38] tribulation saint
[1:35:44] amen i i don't want you to have to go
[1:35:46] through that time i'm not sure don't you
[1:35:47] wait and stay standing at the white
[1:35:49] throne judgment
[1:35:52] amen i i don't want to review that you
[1:35:54] you sat in services like this and you
[1:35:56] heard the word of god preached and the
[1:35:58] spirit of god moved and you watch it all
[1:36:01] back and you sat like a bump on the log
[1:36:10] you didn't make any response
[1:36:13] you continued being foolish
[1:36:19] you see
[1:36:21] brother branham talked about this and
[1:36:23] and let me just read some more he says
[1:36:25] he's god you fail to see who he is he's
[1:36:28] the unchanging god i'm glad i got faith
[1:36:30] in him tonight that someday when my life
[1:36:33] when my body with his 16 elements will
[1:36:35] be back in the dusty earth now that's
[1:36:38] true
[1:36:39] and he will say
[1:36:41] but he will say william branham and i'll
[1:36:43] come forth he'll breathe the breath of
[1:36:46] life into it and say there you are he
[1:36:48] will bypass the birth through my mother
[1:36:51] and so forth like jesus on his first
[1:36:54] miracle he turned the water into wine
[1:36:57] eventually it would have been wine
[1:37:01] that water would have been wine
[1:37:04] it would have come up through the
[1:37:05] grapevine and come up through it and
[1:37:08] through the blossoms and made fruit and
[1:37:11] would have wound up in the grapes
[1:37:13] and would have been squeezed out and
[1:37:15] fermented and made wine
[1:37:17] amen but you see he bypassed the whole
[1:37:21] process
[1:37:23] he shows he's a god that can bypass the
[1:37:26] whole process
[1:37:29] hallelujah and in one instance water
[1:37:32] turned the wine
[1:37:35] take this water and bear it to the
[1:37:37] governor of the feast
[1:37:39] and when he tasted it it was no more
[1:37:41] water it was wine one instant
[1:37:44] at the resurrection hallelujah he's
[1:37:47] going to bypass the womb
[1:37:49] the nine months of pregnancy the baby
[1:37:52] and the toddler and the adolescent stage
[1:37:56] he won't say hey mr mrs pruitt get
[1:37:59] married again and bring forth tim he
[1:38:01] will speak and i'll come forth
[1:38:04] he'll speak and you'll come forth
[1:38:07] amen he's god
[1:38:10] as he said in marriage in divorce
[1:38:12] hallelujah there will come a time where
[1:38:14] it won't be no more sex but god will
[1:38:17] call his children from the dust of the
[1:38:20] earth back like they were in the
[1:38:21] original not through any woman but
[1:38:23] through the molding of the clay and the
[1:38:25] cosmic lights and the petroleum he'll
[1:38:27] create again like he did adam at the
[1:38:30] first time
[1:38:32] that's what happens in this appearing
[1:38:36] this is what he will do he will appear
[1:38:41] look
[1:38:42] who is the bride anyway
[1:38:45] she's christ
[1:38:47] she's christ in what form
[1:38:49] bright form
[1:38:51] is that right he's going to appear
[1:38:54] in theophanic form
[1:38:58] you see he's got a physical body we're
[1:39:00] going to meet that in the air but he's
[1:39:01] going to appear in our day in his bride
[1:39:04] emptionic form and he will pick up dust
[1:39:08] from the earth and step into it
[1:39:10] and those who are alive and remain to
[1:39:13] the coming lord will be standing there
[1:39:15] with their dust
[1:39:19] their guts that just had an evil thought
[1:39:24] that just heard bad news
[1:39:27] that this heard a doctor's report
[1:39:30] come on somebody amen people must guess
[1:39:34] and the holy spirit will sweep over them
[1:39:37] and in a moment he will bypass your
[1:39:40] mother and your father and he will make
[1:39:43] you all over anew
[1:39:45] glorify your body a theophany will step
[1:39:49] in and glorify
[1:39:53] your body
[1:39:56] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:39:59] now see our bodies are not annihilated
[1:40:02] this is a whole thing on future home
[1:40:04] brother branham taught us
[1:40:06] that the the the the earth will not be
[1:40:09] annihilated as well if heavens and earth
[1:40:10] will pass away he said it's changed from
[1:40:13] one form to another
[1:40:15] it's not an annihilation meaning
[1:40:17] disintegrates into nothingness
[1:40:20] it can never be nothing again
[1:40:24] god has used this earth to type it as
[1:40:26] his wife
[1:40:28] the son as himself the earth is his wife
[1:40:32] who who his life is reproduced on
[1:40:36] is that right amen and he made this
[1:40:39] earth for a purpose
[1:40:41] and he came and said and he he already
[1:40:44] has baptized it with water he has shed
[1:40:47] his blood upon it
[1:40:49] and he's about to baptize it with fire
[1:40:51] and come and live on it
[1:40:54] so brother branham would tell us you
[1:40:56] know he is not going to annihilate the
[1:40:57] earth and let me say your bodies will
[1:41:00] not be annihilated
[1:41:02] and this it will be a resurrection not a
[1:41:06] replacement
[1:41:10] oh brother tim it won't be a bunch of
[1:41:12] men going down with spades and opening
[1:41:14] up the grave no it won't it'll be
[1:41:15] theophanies coming and gathering up what
[1:41:18] they left behind
[1:41:20] and transforming it in a moment in a
[1:41:22] twinkling of an eye
[1:41:26] the same body
[1:41:28] that went down
[1:41:31] that went down into the grave will come
[1:41:33] up
[1:41:34] all you have to do is listen to the
[1:41:36] prophet you'll get rid of some of all
[1:41:38] these dumb ideas
[1:41:40] that god ain't interested in your body
[1:41:42] and we you know he it was something we
[1:41:44] said the whole earth was something we
[1:41:46] that was sin then
[1:41:48] amen but he told us that it's not
[1:41:51] it is not
[1:41:52] a
[1:41:53] a replacement
[1:41:56] you know if i go over here and i take
[1:41:58] this bible and i put it down and i pick
[1:42:00] up this box of kleenex
[1:42:03] you see that's not a resurrection that's
[1:42:06] a replacement
[1:42:09] well you got this new body brother tim
[1:42:11] you got this new body and it's one that
[1:42:14] listen the one he glorifies will be one
[1:42:16] that never sinned then
[1:42:19] but resurrection is not a replacement it
[1:42:22] is a picking up of the same body that
[1:42:24] went down
[1:42:26] because god will not annihilate your
[1:42:29] body that's why god is concerned about
[1:42:32] your flesh
[1:42:33] that's why he provided healing for your
[1:42:36] body
[1:42:37] and he's interested in you and your need
[1:42:40] this morning and has already provided
[1:42:42] the antidote for sin and the antidote
[1:42:45] for sickness
[1:42:47] so that by his stripes you can be healed
[1:42:51] i say hallelujah
[1:42:56] that's the kind of god that i serve
[1:42:58] your body's not annihilated it's not
[1:43:00] done away with your body instead is the
[1:43:04] temple of the holy ghost that's why we
[1:43:07] got a right to say satan take your hands
[1:43:10] off of god's property
[1:43:19] god's property
[1:43:22] why is it god's property
[1:43:24] you say it's still mortal brother tim it
[1:43:27] ain't converted yet brother tim
[1:43:29] it's god's property
[1:43:32] he has already put a down payment on it
[1:43:38] by the redemption of your soul
[1:43:41] and he's going to redeem
[1:43:43] your body
[1:43:49] jehovah jiren brother branham says it
[1:43:50] this way
[1:43:53] he says amen glory not one hair of your
[1:43:56] head will perish
[1:43:58] hallelujah that's exactly right it was
[1:44:00] not yet it is in a way and yet it is not
[1:44:03] then it is
[1:44:05] exactly petroleum cosmic lights
[1:44:08] calcium pottish now he's referring back
[1:44:10] to those angels
[1:44:12] they were not then they were
[1:44:16] amen they were not there were no bodies
[1:44:18] there they were all of a sudden here
[1:44:20] they are they appear
[1:44:24] they appear
[1:44:26] and as they appear you know they come
[1:44:28] for a visitation and while they're
[1:44:30] visiting they they give revelation and
[1:44:32] understanding and knowledge
[1:44:36] and the promise
[1:44:42] and then in a moment
[1:44:44] disappear
[1:44:46] and the petroleum calcium potash
[1:44:49] cosmic lights all go right back
[1:44:52] to the elements again
[1:44:56] and he says
[1:44:58] he says when i am nothing
[1:45:00] nothing you can see just ashes he will
[1:45:03] speak hallelujah throw in that polish
[1:45:06] and petroleum together and i'll live
[1:45:08] again in his presence
[1:45:10] hallelujah that he gives us eternal life
[1:45:12] and all the father has given me there's
[1:45:14] nothing as lost and i'll raise it up at
[1:45:17] the last days i believe it as a seed of
[1:45:19] abraham i'm look for that day i'm
[1:45:21] searching for a city whose builder and
[1:45:23] maker is god certainly no matter how
[1:45:26] this wrinkles up
[1:45:30] and no matter what happens god will
[1:45:32] raise it up again in the splendor of
[1:45:35] youth again at the last day he promised
[1:45:38] he would do it and i'm looking for that

[1:46:19] voice and many magazines and things

[1:47:39] anew and afresh in our day
[1:47:42] that we are in the awakening
[1:47:46] that we are in the appearing

[1:49:41] don't pay attention to it one bit
[1:49:44] but one day i was in the airport
[1:49:47] and i heard tim pruitt
[1:49:50] did i hear that tim pruitt your
[1:49:53] your party is late that you're picking
[1:49:55] up they will they will come
[1:49:57] at such and such times
[1:50:01] you see all of a sudden that wasn't just
[1:50:05] noise
[1:50:07] it was my message
[1:50:10] it had instructions for me
[1:50:14] hallelujah
[1:50:15] amen you see there's many that's walked
[1:50:18] around and heard the message thousands
[1:50:21] would listen to it around the world but
[1:50:23] one day he called your name
[1:50:27] he had special instructions for you
[1:50:29] cause your name was called
[1:50:36] that's what this message does for you it
[1:50:38] calls your name it gives you
[1:50:40] instructions
[1:50:42] i'm appearing to you
[1:50:44] and i'm appearing to you and i've
[1:50:46] appeared to you
[1:50:47] i'm looking at a bunch of people here
[1:50:49] who love his appearance
[1:50:53] hallelujah
[1:50:54] that like mary magdalene he appeared to
[1:50:57] her then he appeared to the eleventh and
[1:50:59] then he appeared to the road of those on
[1:51:02] a math he appeared
[1:51:06] paul said he also appeared to me after
[1:51:08] his death burial and resurrection and i
[1:51:11] want to say he appeared to me
[1:51:14] and my life has never been to save
[1:51:16] because he appeared
[1:51:18] it had an effect on my dust
[1:51:26] and it prepared my body
[1:51:29] to receive a theophany
[1:51:31] that i bypassed
[1:51:38] it put a deposit there
[1:51:41] that that theophany's coming to
[1:51:48] you visualize it any way you want to
[1:51:51] but i visualize my theophany being it's
[1:51:53] the word thought of me
[1:51:55] still being a part of him and one day
[1:51:57] when he speaks
[1:51:58] it'll materialize right before us
[1:52:03] when he calls my name
[1:52:10] don't pay any attention to these
[1:52:13] people say well the theophany was here
[1:52:15] and i shook hands with it that's a bunch
[1:52:16] of buoy
[1:52:18] psychology
[1:52:19] pretending
[1:52:22] amen don't don't think of that
[1:52:24] when that theophany comes you're going
[1:52:26] to be changed
[1:52:30] i may not know all the mechanics of it
[1:52:32] but i know about the dynamics of it
[1:52:35] because that day that i recognized the
[1:52:37] word of god was eagle food i heard
[1:52:41] from the word god spoke of me my
[1:52:43] theophany
[1:52:45] that part of us to play and i was called
[1:52:48] and ordained for this hour
[1:52:53] oh
[1:52:54] you got a little 16 elements in you a
[1:52:56] little moisture little petroleum little
[1:52:59] potassium little calcium some cosmic
[1:53:01] light and that's about what you are
[1:53:03] twisted up together and there you go
[1:53:05] dirt of louisiana
[1:53:08] that's all you are
[1:53:10] i'm reading a quote actually dirt of
[1:53:12] louisiana
[1:53:14] that's all you are
[1:53:15] but remember something made you this
[1:53:19] and the very one that made you this
[1:53:22] come to live in you
[1:53:24] that he might make you something
[1:53:26] different
[1:53:30] oh my
[1:53:31] oh how we can look upon that
[1:53:34] oh we ought to look upon that remember
[1:53:36] he promised it through this little cloud
[1:53:38] of dirt that though this little cloth go
[1:53:40] back into the this little cloth that's
[1:53:42] walking around with life and when life
[1:53:44] leads it goes right back to dust again
[1:53:46] but what did he say in his word i'll
[1:53:48] raise it up in the last days
[1:53:52] amen i raised it up he promised it and
[1:53:55] after the body has perished even after
[1:53:59] even the dust is broke out and it goes
[1:54:02] back to the gases in the earth as i said
[1:54:04] the other night you can't annihilate
[1:54:06] nothing man can't there's no
[1:54:07] annihilation man cannot annihilate
[1:54:10] anything it's only god can do it and
[1:54:12] remember he will though it be a spoonful
[1:54:14] of ashes he will say i'll raise it up
[1:54:17] again at the last day that dirt will
[1:54:20] have to obey his commandment because he
[1:54:22] created it
[1:54:24] and if the winds and the wave obey him
[1:54:27] so does the dirt obey him wake up he is
[1:54:31] with us
[1:54:33] and all obeys him even your body's going
[1:54:36] to obey him
[1:54:40] hallelujah you know you had that germ of
[1:54:42] eternal life that appearing came to you
[1:54:44] and quickened something down on the
[1:54:45] inside of you
[1:54:46] and your old mortal body was laying in
[1:54:48] bed this morning and there was something
[1:54:51] get up
[1:54:53] go to church
[1:54:55] get up
[1:54:59] hallelujah
[1:55:01] hey man you remember when it got ahold
[1:55:03] of you and drug you down to an altar
[1:55:07] amen you remember when he when he saved
[1:55:10] your soul and he glorified that soul of
[1:55:12] yours
[1:55:13] [Applause]
[1:55:14] amen you remember when that heavenly
[1:55:17] kiss came and that embrace and you was
[1:55:19] made one with him and became his bride
[1:55:24] hallelujah what was that god was making
[1:55:27] your dust obey him
[1:55:30] [Applause]
[1:55:36] do you know the holy spirit in you can
[1:55:38] discipline your mind
[1:55:40] that's thinking on all kinds of things
[1:55:43] and pull those thoughts down and make it
[1:55:45] obey the word of god
[1:55:48] and the devil says you're lost and i say
[1:55:50] jesus said i'm saved
[1:55:53] the devil said you can't make him i i
[1:55:55] say already have
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:55:59] amen the devil says the weapons that our
[1:56:02] god is going to overtake you and i say
[1:56:04] no weapon formed against me shall
[1:56:06] prosper
[1:56:08] this is my inheritance
[1:56:10] [Applause]
[1:56:14] thus your body has to obey
[1:56:17] your confession of god's word
[1:56:21] that's why we can say
[1:56:22] satan take your hands off of god's
[1:56:25] property
[1:56:26] you see how this appeared to abraham he
[1:56:29] is king theoph and he created a body for
[1:56:31] himself
[1:56:32] two angels stepped in it
[1:56:35] why did he do it this way
[1:56:37] you see
[1:56:38] redemption by the blood of the lord
[1:56:40] jesus christ had not yet come
[1:56:44] so you see
[1:56:46] so he could not come in physical bodies
[1:56:50] i want to get this if i don't get much
[1:56:52] more
[1:56:53] but you see when he came when he came in
[1:56:55] abraham's day the blood of christ had
[1:56:57] not been shed
[1:56:59] so the blood of bulls and goats could
[1:57:01] never take away sin
[1:57:03] so god could come could not come and
[1:57:05] live in human flesh it wasn't redeemed
[1:57:11] so he couldn't come he couldn't come any
[1:57:13] other way
[1:57:14] so he created himself a body
[1:57:17] understand he came and created bodies
[1:57:22] but now
[1:57:24] i want you to get it in this appearing
[1:57:27] he still comes in bodies
[1:57:30] and i mean physical bodies
[1:57:34] but not created bodies
[1:57:38] gathered from dust and
[1:57:40] now
[1:57:41] the one with nail scarred hands come
[1:57:43] walking down our aisles and walking down
[1:57:46] no he can't do that
[1:57:49] the word binds him from coming until the
[1:57:51] meeting in the air
[1:57:55] i want you to want you to understand the
[1:57:57] word itself binds him from coming
[1:58:01] i can just stop just for a minute and
[1:58:02] just talk about that binding stop this
[1:58:05] for a minute remember when they were
[1:58:07] about
[1:58:08] they were about to break his bones on
[1:58:10] the cross
[1:58:12] amen and here they were right there and
[1:58:15] they they beat the legs of one beat the
[1:58:17] legs or the other and walked up to beat
[1:58:19] his legs
[1:58:21] and all of a sudden something stopped
[1:58:23] him
[1:58:25] the soldier got stopped there was a word
[1:58:27] in the way that said not one bone of his
[1:58:30] body would be broken
[1:58:32] so he took a spear and he speared his
[1:58:35] side
[1:58:38] because there was a word for that
[1:58:41] but there was a word that said no bone
[1:58:44] of his could be broken
[1:58:47] come on somebody help me preach now
[1:58:51] amen the same thing is true right here
[1:58:53] jesus cannot come back in the body of
[1:58:56] jesus christ and walk our aisles
[1:59:00] but he can come
[1:59:02] but he comes in the form of the holy
[1:59:04] spirit
[1:59:07] but he also comes in that form
[1:59:10] in bodies
[1:59:12] fleshly bodies
[1:59:14] human bodies
[1:59:17] redeemed bodies
[1:59:19] you see what he couldn't do back in
[1:59:21] abraham he can do now
[1:59:26] amen are you with me god can come right
[1:59:29] down into the body of his bride
[1:59:32] now you individually cannot receive him
[1:59:34] in the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:59:37] but his bride body around the world
[1:59:39] receives him in the fullness of the
[1:59:42] godhead bodily in bright form
[1:59:47] god come and walk in the earth in
[1:59:49] redeemed flesh
[1:59:53] hallelujah i said hallelujah
[1:59:56] i want you to realize what dwells within
[1:59:59] you this morning is deity because he has
[2:00:02] come to appear in your flesh to
[2:00:04] tabernacle your body
[2:00:06] [Applause]
[2:00:08] to perform his signs to bring his word
[2:00:13] he's using my body right now to prophesy
[2:00:16] through
[2:00:17] to preach the word of god through the
[2:00:19] testimony of jesus christ is the spirit
[2:00:21] of prophecy
[2:00:26] so he's standing in the pulpit
[2:00:29] prophesying to you anointing me with
[2:00:31] words to say
[2:00:34] for your edification to build up his
[2:00:36] body to instruct the bride wherever you
[2:00:40] are today
[2:00:42] there's something for you
[2:00:44] but it's not a one-man ministry
[2:00:48] and it's not the fullness in one man
[2:00:53] you know years ago they had a little
[2:00:54] doctrine went around came out of
[2:00:56] jeffersonville you can figure the
[2:00:58] fullness of the pillar of fire dwelt in
[2:01:00] brother branham that's a lie
[2:01:02] it never dwelt in brother branham not
[2:01:04] the fullness
[2:01:05] he had a lick of fire just like all of
[2:01:07] us
[2:01:09] amen he had the same holy ghost that you
[2:01:12] have not a different holy ghost
[2:01:14] the fullness of god never dwelt in
[2:01:16] brother brown and that's that deity
[2:01:17] spirit
[2:01:19] and the deity spirit wants you to deify
[2:01:22] brother branham and not recognize your
[2:01:23] position
[2:01:26] and realize that god's in you listen you
[2:01:28] see now he uses redeemed people to
[2:01:32] appear in so where is god appearing
[2:01:36] amen he's appearing in his people
[2:01:40] he's appearing in his church the bride
[2:01:44] that's where he's appearing
[2:01:50] now the appearing is not his coming
[2:01:53] 1962 brother branham hit a vein of
[2:01:55] thought you know he said the appearance
[2:01:57] not to come and he would go over and
[2:01:58] over this thing he said they're two
[2:02:00] different words well there's actually in
[2:02:02] the bible where that some of the times
[2:02:04] he says appearing and the bible does
[2:02:06] refer to his coming but he's trying to
[2:02:08] make a point here
[2:02:10] that there is a difference between the
[2:02:12] physical return of the lord and him
[2:02:14] being in that man called jesus and is
[2:02:17] appearing in the form of the holy ghost
[2:02:19] in the church
[2:02:20] and he says there are two different
[2:02:22] things and notice he he says
[2:02:24] um the appearing is not his coming he
[2:02:27] will come for he will come in a corporal
[2:02:29] body
[2:02:30] and that's going to be the capstone of
[2:02:32] all his appearing it will it will
[2:02:34] materialize in the coming of the
[2:02:36] theophanies all of them
[2:02:40] and the meeting in the air where we will
[2:02:42] meet a literal lord jesus remember
[2:02:44] remember this no matter what how we
[2:02:47] preach about his coming
[2:02:49] and his appearing
[2:02:51] remember we still look for the blessed
[2:02:53] hope
[2:02:54] of his glorious appearance where we're
[2:02:56] going to meet him in the air
[2:02:58] is that right and brother branham would
[2:03:00] say to that there is a heaven
[2:03:03] and there is a literal jesus christ
[2:03:05] there
[2:03:07] that will come in a body form to receive
[2:03:09] his church himself and no matter how old
[2:03:11] the story seems it's still the truth god
[2:03:14] said so that's what believers believe
[2:03:17] how many are believers
[2:03:19] well then if we are believers then we
[2:03:21] will believe there is a literal lord
[2:03:24] jesus christ there
[2:03:27] in the heavens that will come in a body
[2:03:29] form to receive his church
[2:03:33] to himself
[2:03:35] no matter how old the story is
[2:03:38] it's still the truth
[2:03:41] you think that story is old the one
[2:03:43] we're reading about abraham is 2 000
[2:03:45] years older
[2:03:49] oh brother tim i don't believe that
[2:03:52] pentecostal pack of lies you realize
[2:03:54] preachers have said that i don't believe
[2:03:57] in that pentecostal pack of lies why why
[2:03:59] would we dare ever refer to the coming
[2:04:02] of the lord jesus the meeting in the
[2:04:05] areas of pentecostal pack of lies
[2:04:08] it's not a pentecostal pack of lies it's
[2:04:11] the truth
[2:04:13] as brother branham said a born again one
[2:04:15] man or woman is just as sure of the
[2:04:17] covenant of the lord jesus they're just
[2:04:20] as sure they've got the holy ghost says
[2:04:21] there is a holy ghost to be given he
[2:04:24] says in the message shalom what care
[2:04:26] what i care about what this year brings
[2:04:29] or why do you care about next year why
[2:04:31] do i care whether i live or die today i
[2:04:34] lived today or died today every word
[2:04:37] that he promised will be vindicated
[2:04:39] everyone if he's able to do it today
[2:04:41] after promising 2000 years ago if it's a
[2:04:44] hundred thousand years today jesus will
[2:04:47] return to the earth in a visible body
[2:04:51] for a church a redeemed the bride and
[2:04:55] take her out of here regardless of what
[2:04:58] people goes fashions say and go on and
[2:05:01] people wait on in total darkness and
[2:05:03] believe anything they want to but jesus
[2:05:06] christ will return again
[2:05:10] amen so there is a returning which is
[2:05:13] his coming
[2:05:15] but right now we are in his appearing
[2:05:19] he is appearing among us
[2:05:21] what's now again going and beyond the
[2:05:24] camp he says this oh how thankful we are
[2:05:27] for all of god's great blessings and may
[2:05:30] it continue to be with us unto that last
[2:05:32] trumpet blows and you know we'll be
[2:05:34] caught up together to meet the lord in
[2:05:36] the air think of it missing people they
[2:05:39] can't see you no more but you're getting
[2:05:42] together with the rest of them
[2:05:46] hallelujah
[2:05:47] amen missing people they can't see you
[2:05:50] no more
[2:05:51] but you're getting together with the
[2:05:53] rest of them
[2:05:55] once you're glorified the world will
[2:05:57] never see you again
[2:05:58] the world won't see to say the dead but
[2:06:01] you'll see them
[2:06:03] and when you see them you'll be changed
[2:06:04] to be like them and then they won't see
[2:06:06] you anymore
[2:06:09] but you know i wonder sometime and this
[2:06:11] is just me
[2:06:13] and pardon me for being human and and
[2:06:17] and having thoughts
[2:06:18] but this is my thinking
[2:06:21] but you know i i wonder sometimes if the
[2:06:24] church says their names in the book of
[2:06:26] life lamb's book of life
[2:06:28] is that right well listen when he opened
[2:06:31] this the seals what do you find he found
[2:06:33] a people a multitude with that number
[2:06:36] between the sixth and the seventh seal
[2:06:38] so they're in the book of the lamb's
[2:06:40] book of life when the lamb's book was
[2:06:41] opened he saw them there all right so
[2:06:44] here they are these are ones that are
[2:06:47] redeemed
[2:06:49] and they are redeemed they're blood
[2:06:51] washed people that were saved this site
[2:06:53] of the tribulation
[2:06:55] but let's just say let's just say that
[2:06:58] that some of them blood washed people
[2:07:00] are your loved ones
[2:07:04] let's just say that
[2:07:05] maybe they they're your fault of mind
[2:07:08] they never saw the message
[2:07:12] what brother brandon said this is why
[2:07:13] they're foolish virgins too your faults
[2:07:15] are mine they didn't see the message or
[2:07:17] in some way were blinded by false
[2:07:19] prophets
[2:07:20] and i'm just going to tell you if you
[2:07:22] don't see the message in this church
[2:07:24] it's because you've listened to false
[2:07:26] prophets
[2:07:27] you're listening to other voices
[2:07:30] but let's just say that some of your
[2:07:32] friends
[2:07:34] some of the people you good christian
[2:07:35] people that have tried to live right
[2:07:38] tried to do right and and
[2:07:41] they didn't live the fullness of this
[2:07:44] message
[2:07:46] and they
[2:07:47] they they didn't live the fullness of
[2:07:49] the bible i meant to say
[2:07:52] they didn't see the message
[2:07:54] they didn't understand
[2:07:56] why god sent a prophet they wasn't a
[2:07:58] part of the bride elect
[2:08:00] but they're part of the church
[2:08:02] they're good people sanctified people
[2:08:05] had professed christ as savior
[2:08:08] let's just say that they're there and
[2:08:11] right now
[2:08:12] they don't have the strength and what is
[2:08:15] needed to live an overcoming life
[2:08:18] as required of the bride of christ
[2:08:21] why how are they going to be able to
[2:08:23] give their life
[2:08:28] how are they going to say oh we miss it
[2:08:31] how are they even going to know they
[2:08:32] missed it
[2:08:36] amen i and this is where i come in with
[2:08:39] my own thinking and pardon me for for
[2:08:42] just talking to you as a church
[2:08:45] but what what if it was that
[2:08:47] amen that moment of your changed
[2:08:50] and you travel like a thought
[2:08:53] and you walk up to your son or
[2:08:54] daughter's house
[2:08:57] maybe you don't knock on the door
[2:08:59] you just appear where she's cooking your
[2:09:01] daughter's cooking
[2:09:02] and all of a sudden you're there
[2:09:04] and you say
[2:09:06] dorothy everything i told you is true
[2:09:09] the rapture is on and she sees you a
[2:09:12] young person
[2:09:13] and in that moment you disappear
[2:09:19] don't you know
[2:09:21] don't you know when they can't find you
[2:09:24] and you've come up missing and they saw
[2:09:26] you
[2:09:28] like they did as brother brown described
[2:09:30] come on
[2:09:31] when that would they come and appear to
[2:09:33] many
[2:09:35] hey man what if it's your young grandma
[2:09:38] a man who's young now
[2:09:40] appears to them
[2:09:42] and say grandchildren you didn't you
[2:09:44] didn't hear it all but i'm here to tell
[2:09:46] you rapture is on this rapture day and
[2:09:49] you missed it
[2:09:51] don't you think they would have
[2:09:53] something within them to give their life
[2:09:56] amen amen we missed that we missed it
[2:09:59] the message is true the rapture is
[2:10:01] taking place but oh god amen oh i have
[2:10:05] received christ i've asked him as my
[2:10:07] savior it's too late now
[2:10:11] it's too late now he that is filthy is
[2:10:13] filthy still there's no repentance this
[2:10:16] is only for those who are living in a
[2:10:18] repentant state
[2:10:21] that's why that it's important for you
[2:10:23] to get everybody that's around you all
[2:10:26] your love at least get them to the place
[2:10:28] they receive christ as their savior
[2:10:35] amen because after the bride is gone
[2:10:37] there not be another gentile saved
[2:10:43] and they won't be saved after the
[2:10:44] tribulation they're saved now and then
[2:10:47] they go into tribulation because they
[2:10:49] were foolish they didn't have the holy
[2:10:51] ghost the oil in their vessels with
[2:10:53] their lamps
[2:11:05] food for thought anyway
[2:11:08] i ain't got it figured out and i want
[2:11:10] you to take what i just said figured it
[2:11:12] out
[2:11:13] i'm just saying
[2:11:14] friends god's got a lot more grace
[2:11:17] than what you ever imagined
[2:11:20] and the story isn't closed yet and it
[2:11:22] isn't the final available
[2:11:38] and in a month or so
[2:11:40] we'll be gone
[2:11:46] i wonder what we'll be doing in that
[2:11:48] month or so
[2:11:53] listen friends the coming of the lord is
[2:11:55] the the most blessed hope
[2:11:59] of all believers
[2:12:01] and we must not allow satan to minimize
[2:12:05] god's corporal return
[2:12:07] but within at the same time we must
[2:12:09] recognize his appearing
[2:12:13] we we have a church world right now who
[2:12:15] are giving lip service to his corporal
[2:12:18] coming amen
[2:12:20] but right now he is appearing
[2:12:23] he's appearing in bright volume
[2:12:26] with signs and wonders
[2:12:28] amen with fivefold gifts of this
[2:12:31] ministry with helps and tongues and
[2:12:34] interpretation and prophecy and working
[2:12:36] on miracles of faith and word of
[2:12:39] knowledge and wisdom
[2:12:47] many don't recognize him because they
[2:12:50] don't believe he's alive
[2:12:52] they have no expectation
[2:12:57] they have no expectation of
[2:13:00] they have no expectation of of him
[2:13:03] coming in this evil day and him and
[2:13:05] appearing have no expectation of a
[2:13:07] resurrected christ of a living god
[2:13:11] they're they're there in the heat of the
[2:13:13] day
[2:13:15] laid back in the tents
[2:13:18] hoping america will change
[2:13:21] hoping their voice their vote will make
[2:13:23] things better
[2:13:26] but the bride of christ is there in the
[2:13:28] door of the tent and they're watching
[2:13:31] for the appearing of the supernatural
[2:13:35] are you with me
[2:13:37] amen and i want you to understand you
[2:13:39] must recognize him in the form that he's
[2:13:42] appearing in remember brother adam said
[2:13:45] two words before i leave you remember
[2:13:47] these two words for i leave you the
[2:13:49] appearance of christ the coming of
[2:13:50] christ is two different things christ is
[2:13:53] appearing in the fullness of his power
[2:13:56] watch how he's appearing on the fullness
[2:13:58] of his power
[2:14:00] amen his coming will be afterwards
[2:14:03] his appearing before his coming
[2:14:06] so now he is a coming in the fullness of
[2:14:09] his power
[2:14:11] now watch i want to i want to capitalize
[2:14:13] on this quotation it comes from the
[2:14:15] sermon from that time from spokane
[2:14:17] washington
[2:14:18] 1962 june july the 13th right about this
[2:14:22] time today's 17. civilization and
[2:14:25] civilization has come from the east
[2:14:28] followed the sun west is that right it's
[2:14:30] at the west coast now
[2:14:32] it may if it makes another moves it's
[2:14:34] back east again
[2:14:35] i'd like to preach on that when east and
[2:14:38] west meets
[2:14:39] notice the s-u-n draw dawns in the east
[2:14:43] travels across the horizon sets in the
[2:14:45] west
[2:14:46] the same sun that rises in the east sets
[2:14:49] in the west is that right now he's
[2:14:51] trying to use an illustration here he's
[2:14:54] telling you it's the same sun that was
[2:14:56] in the east
[2:14:57] it was the same sun at the close of the
[2:14:59] day
[2:15:01] the same jesus christ that was back 2
[2:15:03] 000 years ago is the same s-o-n here
[2:15:06] today
[2:15:07] so he said now the prophet said there
[2:15:09] will be a day there will be day called
[2:15:11] day or night it's a dismal day a foggy
[2:15:13] day but we've had a day of that and man
[2:15:16] has known enough to join church except
[2:15:18] christ his savior go join a denomination
[2:15:21] that's about as much light as he had but
[2:15:23] remember it's evening time now
[2:15:26] civilizations on the west coast and the
[2:15:29] same s-o-n that's shown in the east at
[2:15:32] the beginning is now shining in the west
[2:15:35] at the end remember what's it do it
[2:15:38] closes there night falls on the gentiles
[2:15:42] and light dawns on the east
[2:15:46] hallelujah amen you realize even what is
[2:15:49] happening even in japan you know the
[2:15:52] light of the rising sun
[2:15:55] amen what are they seeing light is
[2:15:57] dawning but it's not stopping at japan
[2:15:59] it's moving right on over to israel as
[2:16:02] the gospel goes back to the jews
[2:16:05] amen so that actually when you realize
[2:16:08] it it'll be the
[2:16:09] the they're they're receiving their the
[2:16:12] the the the evening timeline christ
[2:16:16] coming out perfecting his church
[2:16:19] how many knows there's a difference
[2:16:21] between the appearance of christ and the
[2:16:23] coming of christ is two different words
[2:16:26] now the appear now is the appearing the
[2:16:28] coming will soon be he's appearing in
[2:16:31] the midst of us doing the works that he
[2:16:34] once did in his church
[2:16:37] notice his appearing is not just a
[2:16:40] doctrine
[2:16:42] it is not made of studious with hormone
[2:16:44] glasses and a nerd out of us a message
[2:16:47] nerd
[2:16:49] amen
[2:16:50] it is what the works of jesus christ
[2:16:53] that he once did
[2:16:55] in his church
[2:16:57] in the end time
[2:16:59] a part of that church by grace you
[2:17:01] believe it i'm a member of that church
[2:17:03] now he says i'm not a preacher
[2:17:05] you know i'm not
[2:17:07] i'm not have the education to do it
[2:17:09] sometimes i feel reluctant standing here
[2:17:11] by men of god who's called to that
[2:17:13] office
[2:17:14] there are apostles prophets teachers
[2:17:17] pastors and evangelists not all her
[2:17:19] apostles not all her prophets not all
[2:17:21] her teachers not all are evangelists i'm
[2:17:23] standing here and watch now he says but
[2:17:26] my ministry
[2:17:28] is different from a pastor or a teacher
[2:17:33] i'm not
[2:17:34] and if i say things wrong brethren
[2:17:36] forgive me i don't mean it but this is
[2:17:39] my ministry
[2:17:41] see to declare him that he's here
[2:17:48] amen and it's true god used brother
[2:17:51] branham
[2:17:52] singularly
[2:17:53] to declare to us with a prophetic gift
[2:17:57] that he is here
[2:18:00] not present in the corporal coming but
[2:18:02] in his appearing
[2:18:05] amen and there is a difference in his
[2:18:07] appearing and is coming in it is a
[2:18:09] purity is present in spirit form to
[2:18:13] impart revelation
[2:18:16] his coming is in the physical corporal
[2:18:18] body coming to resurrect the saints and
[2:18:22] take it as a rapture in the meeting in
[2:18:24] the air
[2:18:26] so this is in the in the true sense the
[2:18:28] word is not as coming it's disappearing
[2:18:30] and brother brother braden's ministry
[2:18:32] declared that christ is here but he said
[2:18:35] it's here in the form of the holy ghost
[2:18:38] and can heal any sickness
[2:18:41] you see we had to start believing that
[2:18:43] nothing is too hard for the lord
[2:18:47] amen for if we can't believe for divine
[2:18:50] healing how are we going to believe for
[2:18:52] the change of our body
[2:18:55] but every man who god has appeared to is
[2:18:59] called to pray for the sick
[2:19:03] if you appeared to a little housewife
[2:19:06] and you're a believer
[2:19:08] you can lay hands on your sick child
[2:19:11] and they shall recover
[2:19:15] i'm trying to make a point here
[2:19:17] amen his ministry
[2:19:20] declared that he could save the vilest
[2:19:23] sinner
[2:19:27] take rosella a girl that was
[2:19:30] you know a prostitute on drugs and
[2:19:33] alcohol
[2:19:34] and just a absolute reject of society
[2:19:38] completely and then one moment in the
[2:19:40] presence of god was transformed
[2:19:43] by the power of god
[2:19:45] he can say the violence sinner
[2:19:48] but every minister
[2:19:51] is called to preach
[2:19:52] so that even the violence sinner can be
[2:19:55] saved
[2:19:57] and romans 10 13 said whosoever shall
[2:20:00] call on the name of the lord shall be
[2:20:02] saved
[2:20:03] and how then shall they call on him in
[2:20:05] whom they have not believed and how
[2:20:08] shall they believe in him of whom they
[2:20:10] have not heard and how shall they hear
[2:20:12] without a preacher
[2:20:15] and how shall they preach unless they be
[2:20:17] sick
[2:20:20] you see if god ain't calling you and god
[2:20:22] ain't ordained you you're spinning your
[2:20:24] wheels
[2:20:27] that's right amen you say well brother
[2:20:30] tim we got soul saved well i'll tell you
[2:20:32] what i we you know and yet i'm let me
[2:20:35] tell you women preachers have preached
[2:20:37] and souls got saved really
[2:20:46] but how shall they hear without a
[2:20:48] preacher
[2:20:49] and how shall they preach
[2:20:52] unless the son of god
[2:20:55] as it is written how beautiful are the
[2:20:57] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[2:20:59] peace and bring tidings of good things
[2:21:04] now but i want to tell you about this
[2:21:06] prophet
[2:21:08] the prophet's ministry went beyond that
[2:21:11] of the fivefold ministry
[2:21:13] though he was
[2:21:15] though because he was the prophet
[2:21:17] messenger to the age
[2:21:19] to bring out the mysteries of the word
[2:21:22] of god and to do this
[2:21:24] god gave brother branham a signed gift
[2:21:27] to demonstrate to to us
[2:21:30] that the word was present
[2:21:36] now when abraham saw him he saw him in a
[2:21:39] visible form
[2:21:41] but the way he's going to show himself
[2:21:43] in the last day is in his bright people
[2:21:47] and they look like just another human
[2:21:49] being
[2:21:51] like sarah thought
[2:21:54] just some men that happened by my
[2:21:57] husband's door
[2:21:58] that i got a fix for today
[2:22:03] now brother branham
[2:22:05] illustrates this in the sermon is there
[2:22:07] anything hot too hard for the lord said
[2:22:09] sarah was in a bad mood
[2:22:11] we'll get her mood a little later maybe
[2:22:13] not in this service today
[2:22:15] but there's a lot of churches in a bad
[2:22:17] mood
[2:22:20] they've done give up on the promise
[2:22:22] sitting there cold and backslidden in
[2:22:24] the back of their tent
[2:22:26] that's a whole nother sermon
[2:22:28] amen refusing without an expectation not
[2:22:31] seeing the awakening but there's another
[2:22:33] part of abraham's seed that is saying
[2:22:35] look here there's an appearance among us
[2:22:38] hallelujah there he is he's appearing
[2:22:40] among us with signs with wonder with
[2:22:42] healings with deliverance
[2:22:45] hallelujah but god gave brother branham
[2:22:47] a signed gift to demonstrate the word
[2:22:50] was present
[2:22:55] the god he come in this pillar of fire
[2:22:57] and the one that wrote the word was
[2:22:59] there to interpret the word amen
[2:23:02] and so he'd say i do not deny that there
[2:23:04] will be prophets even as in the days of
[2:23:06] paul where there was one activist a
[2:23:08] prophet who prophesied of a famine i
[2:23:11] agree that is so but i deny
[2:23:14] upon the infallible evidence of the word
[2:23:17] that there is more than one major
[2:23:20] prophet messenger who will reveal the
[2:23:22] mysteries as contained in the word
[2:23:26] sorry joseph followers your prophet
[2:23:28] won't cut it
[2:23:32] sorry joseph coleman followers your your
[2:23:36] apostle won't cut it
[2:23:38] sorry level followers your teacher won't
[2:23:41] cut it there is one prophet messenger
[2:23:45] amen sorry if you think i'm the joshua
[2:23:48] sorry if you think i'm the next
[2:23:50] personality sorry you won't cut it
[2:23:54] there is one prophet messenger who will
[2:23:57] reveal the seven the mysteries that's
[2:24:00] contained in the word and who has the
[2:24:02] ministry to turn the hearts of the
[2:24:04] children to the fathers that saith the
[2:24:07] lord by his unfailing word stands and
[2:24:10] shall stand and be vindicated there is
[2:24:12] one prophet messenger to the age
[2:24:17] amen so therefore he had a ministry to
[2:24:20] him alone was given the sign gift
[2:24:24] to demonstrate the word was now being
[2:24:27] revealed the mysteries were being
[2:24:29] revealed through the seventh angel's
[2:24:32] message
[2:24:34] hebrews 4 12 turn with me let's look at
[2:24:36] the scripture one more time
[2:24:40] for the word of god is alive
[2:24:47] did i read that right
[2:24:49] the word of god is alive that's what
[2:24:51] quake means
[2:24:53] it's not a dead word it's a living word
[2:24:56] and it is powerful
[2:24:58] and it's sharper
[2:25:00] than any two-edged sword it pierces even
[2:25:03] to the dividing the sword center of soul
[2:25:05] and spirit
[2:25:06] and of the joints and tomorrow and is a
[2:25:08] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[2:25:10] heart you see what this the the sign
[2:25:14] gift of brother branham it showed us
[2:25:18] that the word the theophanic of god was
[2:25:22] now present
[2:25:24] using a son of man it was decent a man
[2:25:28] using a son of man a prophet as a voice
[2:25:33] to identify the unrecognized presence of
[2:25:37] god
[2:25:38] because if abraham hadn't been looking
[2:25:41] and expecting sarah in the tent would
[2:25:45] have never seen it it'd have passed her
[2:25:47] by
[2:25:48] but god had eyes
[2:25:50] looking for the appearing
[2:25:57] in the door of the tent
[2:26:03] he was watching
[2:26:05] for the moving of the holy ghost
[2:26:08] and he said i saw seven angels come from
[2:26:11] glory
[2:26:13] see
[2:26:14] are you with me
[2:26:16] amen now theophany don't just mean
[2:26:18] bodies or or saintly bodies theophanies
[2:26:22] means a a manifestation of god i saw
[2:26:26] manifestations of the spirit of god
[2:26:29] there were seven
[2:26:30] manifestations
[2:26:32] and every night one of them came and
[2:26:35] opened up seven seals to me
[2:26:38] and they were all the seven spirits of
[2:26:40] one god god manifesting himself for
[2:26:43] unfolding himself
[2:26:45] bringing to us
[2:26:47] the mysteries of god in the end time
[2:26:50] this ain't over your head
[2:26:52] you know this
[2:26:54] so
[2:26:55] i want you to see verse 13 let's look at
[2:26:58] this next verse neither is there any
[2:27:02] creature
[2:27:04] that is not manifest in his sight so
[2:27:06] standing on the platform
[2:27:08] i see a dog well it happened 40 years
[2:27:11] ago when you were a young girl
[2:27:17] and it scared you and i saw you run up
[2:27:20] on the porch and someone opened the door
[2:27:22] and you ran in
[2:27:24] but you see that fear that you had
[2:27:26] started right there
[2:27:29] now that person wasn't devil possessed
[2:27:31] that person was tormented by a devil
[2:27:36] by happening in their past
[2:27:38] things that your parents can try to put
[2:27:40] on you or your grandparents
[2:27:44] can haunt your life
[2:27:47] and try to form you
[2:27:58] you're not devil possessed
[2:28:00] you're devil oppressed
[2:28:03] you've got to recognize this is not me
[2:28:05] this is not who i am
[2:28:07] that was the voice of satan trying to
[2:28:09] say this is what i would be but i'm not
[2:28:12] that i am a child of the most high god
[2:28:18] and i'll break the cycle
[2:28:20] of sin and failure
[2:28:23] amen and i don't care if there's been a
[2:28:25] whole line of sex problems all through
[2:28:27] my family for a generation i am here to
[2:28:30] break that cycle
[2:28:33] because he appeared to me and with his
[2:28:36] appearing it changed me
[2:28:41] you see you've got to realize three like
[2:28:43] brother branham did he said one day i
[2:28:46] realized i was not the son of charles
[2:28:49] and ella branham
[2:28:52] i was the son of god i was a
[2:28:54] predestinated seed before the foundation
[2:28:56] of the world
[2:28:59] step out of your human line
[2:29:01] step over their failures well there's
[2:29:04] been passion there's been a temper
[2:29:06] there's been this problem step off of
[2:29:08] that
[2:29:09] you've been born again and because i'm
[2:29:11] born again ain't none of that in my past
[2:29:14] amen in my past hallelujah is a david a
[2:29:17] david and abraham and isaac a jacob in
[2:29:21] my past is a peter a james and a john in
[2:29:24] my past
[2:29:27] is the source that i come from jesus
[2:29:32] and i can break the pattern of failure
[2:29:37] and the pattern of sin
[2:29:39] well my mom and dad divorced well that
[2:29:41] might have been your mom and dad but
[2:29:43] this new one that you got with this new
[2:29:46] parent you can identify
[2:29:49] hallelujah i'm not the child of divorced

[2:31:04] and drop cancer out of you and diabetes
[2:31:07] out of you and sickness and disease and
[2:31:09] temper
[2:31:11] and hatred and bitterness
[2:31:20] as a pruitt i had to break a cycle
[2:31:24] i'm going to say something very personal
[2:31:26] now
[2:31:27] i can remember my mom and dad
[2:31:29] coming home from seeing their their
[2:31:32] siblings
[2:31:33] driving back home you know they were all
[2:31:35] pentecostals
[2:31:37] someone become one as someone become
[2:31:39] trinity
[2:31:40] family divided over doctrine
[2:31:43] someone got worldly
[2:31:45] some of them bobbed their hair and
[2:31:47] pained their face some of them didn't
[2:31:49] here they were
[2:31:51] now
[2:31:54] they all claim to have the holy ghost
[2:31:57] they all claim to have pentecostal
[2:31:59] experience
[2:32:01] but now
[2:32:03] they let a little bitterness come in
[2:32:06] and always coming home from tyler texas
[2:32:09] a dale did this tiny does this
[2:32:12] you know this and does that
[2:32:14] they talked about
[2:32:16] their their theirs
[2:32:18] my dad's siblings and what was going on
[2:32:20] in the family and how bad it was and you
[2:32:23] know the bickering and the fussing and
[2:32:25] the fighting over religion
[2:32:28] you know what happens when you start
[2:32:29] doing that in the family nobody wants it
[2:32:34] your kids don't want it
[2:32:38] instead of loving one another it was
[2:32:40] always down in one another
[2:32:42] and i sat there and that has a little
[2:32:45] boy in the car riding in the back of an
[2:32:47] old dodger chrysler station wagon we
[2:32:50] rode in both of them 59 we had a dodge
[2:32:52] in 64 65 we had a chrysler we had this
[2:32:55] old there's this these old station
[2:32:58] wagons and back there in the back seat
[2:33:00] here my mom and dad talked and i put my
[2:33:02] arms around my brothers
[2:33:04] and i love them to myself and i say oh
[2:33:07] god don't never let this happen in our
[2:33:09] family
[2:33:11] then we come down the road and we can
[2:33:13] believe in the same prophet
[2:33:16] same message
[2:33:19] share the same truths
[2:33:21] believe in baptism in the name of jesus
[2:33:24] christ
[2:33:25] believe in one god believe in god sent a
[2:33:28] prophet
[2:33:29] and can't worship under the same roof
[2:33:32] can't even come to special meetings
[2:33:34] any matter what is it in this family
[2:33:36] says yeah you have back and forth
[2:33:39] and some of you some of you will bring
[2:33:41] it right on down and i'm talking about
[2:33:43] my family right now
[2:33:45] write down write down in your own family
[2:33:47] and what's happening among your siblings
[2:33:49] and the in-laws is fussing and fighting
[2:33:53] and abiding
[2:33:54] and devouring one another
[2:33:58] that's what not that's not what the
[2:34:00] message is about
[2:34:02] it never was to produce that
[2:34:05] it was to produce christ
[2:34:11] amen to produce christ
[2:34:14] what's it produced bitterness
[2:34:17] fussing
[2:34:18] fighting
[2:34:19] arguments debates
[2:34:22] back bitings finding fault can't trust
[2:34:25] the ministry can't believe brother tim's
[2:34:27] really called can't believe he's really
[2:34:29] the pastor can't really believe no ah it
[2:34:32] happens
[2:34:34] you say brother jim you're putting out
[2:34:36] some dirty laundry brother branham did
[2:34:37] all the time i never intended to do this
[2:34:39] but i'm telling you i'm telling you a
[2:34:41] bunch of pruitts you gotta
[2:34:43] you've got to break the cycle
[2:34:46] and i'm telling the rest of you no
[2:34:48] matter who you are
[2:34:50] there's no perfect family other than
[2:34:52] god's family but until you break the
[2:34:55] cycle of sin and failure
[2:35:01] you can break it whether it's passion
[2:35:04] whether it's temper whether it's hatred
[2:35:06] no matter what it is you can break it
[2:35:18] oh
[2:35:28] so the word is discerned
[2:35:30] going back in the hidden things of the
[2:35:32] soul
[2:35:33] could go back 40 years in a person's
[2:35:35] life
[2:35:36] or it could go back and reveal things
[2:35:38] that are in the back part of god's mind
[2:35:41] or bring out the hidden treasures of the
[2:35:43] scripture
[2:35:45] it would even go back to john's
[2:35:47] experience on the isle of patmos
[2:35:50] and hear the seven thunders under their
[2:35:52] voices
[2:35:53] and this time tell us what they said
[2:35:55] because it knows now time for them to be
[2:35:58] made known
[2:36:00] what was it you see it was god god
[2:36:03] declaring to us the presence of god so
[2:36:06] that we would know god is with us
[2:36:09] and the promised son jesus christ will
[2:36:12] soon come
[2:36:14] not disappear but come
[2:36:16] for his bright church
[2:36:22] you see in his appearance
[2:36:24] he doesn't come in the flesh of jesus
[2:36:28] and he doesn't come in just one man
[2:36:30] that's right
[2:36:31] he didn't just come and brother brown
[2:36:33] them and he just doesn't come in in your
[2:36:35] personality cult leader
[2:36:38] or you didn't just come and tim pruitt
[2:36:41] he comes in my flesh and your flesh
[2:36:44] it's his spirit and it's an anointing
[2:36:48] first john 2 27
[2:36:51] but the anointing which you have
[2:36:53] received of him abideth in you
[2:36:56] so it is an anointing that you've
[2:36:58] received in revelation 10 it shows the
[2:37:00] mighty angel revelation 10 1.
[2:37:03] it's a it's an anointing this is not a
[2:37:05] corporal coming amen it is the period of
[2:37:08] christ
[2:37:10] amen as he comes down preparing for a
[2:37:13] bride to be raptured
[2:37:16] so you see there's a portion of the word
[2:37:19] that is laid for every age i quote
[2:37:21] brother branham here and there is some
[2:37:24] anointing comes down that projects that
[2:37:27] portion of the word for that age so it's
[2:37:30] not it is not the person of christ the
[2:37:33] physical return it is the anointing
[2:37:39] and when that anointing comes it breaks
[2:37:41] the yoke
[2:37:43] it'll break the yolk into nomination
[2:37:45] tradition family traits
[2:37:48] everything it will break it
[2:37:50] amen an anointing comes down for the
[2:37:54] purpose of revealing christ
[2:37:58] now there is
[2:38:00] darkness in the age
[2:38:03] and that purpose is
[2:38:05] to cause such confusion that people
[2:38:08] don't recognize the ministry of christ
[2:38:11] in the messenger
[2:38:13] so there's many going right by
[2:38:16] and they passed right by many and the
[2:38:18] charismatic the full gospel the full
[2:38:20] gospel businessmen the pentecostal the
[2:38:22] assembly of god they got so caught up in
[2:38:25] the darkness of the age
[2:38:27] that they could not recognize the
[2:38:28] ministry of christ in the messenger
[2:38:33] and then
[2:38:36] if
[2:38:38] they do see
[2:38:40] if they do see that darkness
[2:38:43] that devil will try to make him think
[2:38:46] that it's all in brother branham that's
[2:38:48] right
[2:38:51] our hope of glory and rapture is
[2:38:53] not seeing christ and brother branham
[2:38:55] it's in christ is recognizing christ in
[2:38:58] you
[2:39:00] that's your hope of rapture glory
[2:39:04] someone asked brother branham the
[2:39:05] question and i'll just
[2:39:07] close with this if i can but he said
[2:39:10] some say brother brown is the son of man
[2:39:12] i thought the pillar of fire was the son
[2:39:14] of man am i mistaken now i'm i'm going
[2:39:17] to quickly just kind of catch the
[2:39:18] highlights of this and paraphrase it i'm
[2:39:20] not the son of man but a son of man
[2:39:23] the son of man is jesus christ a son of
[2:39:26] man is a prophet
[2:39:28] there is quite a difference jesus christ
[2:39:30] was the son of man the son of god the
[2:39:32] son of man the son of david and now the
[2:39:34] reason that question is probably i was
[2:39:36] asked
[2:39:38] this person or been said because people
[2:39:40] regard me as a seer
[2:39:42] and then he says i am not the anointed
[2:39:44] son of man
[2:39:48] so now when we're looking here
[2:39:51] brother branham's not the anointed son
[2:39:53] of man
[2:39:55] when we look at the appearance this
[2:39:57] prophecy is not saying it's all in
[2:39:59] brother branham
[2:40:01] the pillar of fire he said is the
[2:40:03] anointing
[2:40:05] it is the logos that went out of god the
[2:40:07] logos which is actually the attribute of
[2:40:10] the fullness of god and when god came to
[2:40:12] a form where it could be seen it was the
[2:40:14] anointing of the great spirit that went
[2:40:16] forth it is condescending coming down
[2:40:18] god the father the logos that was up
[2:40:20] over israel he was holy he could not
[2:40:23] stand to see sin and then there had to
[2:40:26] be a blood offering in eden and then the
[2:40:28] logos became flesh and dwelt among us we
[2:40:30] know that was in jesus and where this
[2:40:32] logos dwelt in the human body which was
[2:40:35] the sacrifice god came down in the image
[2:40:38] of man's redeemed man and that brought
[2:40:40] man and god together heavens and earth
[2:40:42] hugged and kissed each other god and man
[2:40:45] embraced each other as fatherhood and
[2:40:48] sonship
[2:40:49] when the logos became flesh and dwelt
[2:40:52] among us jesus said i come from god and
[2:40:55] go to god is that right after his death
[2:40:57] burial resurrection ascension the body
[2:40:59] was taken up sit at the right hand of
[2:41:00] god no i don't mean god's got a right
[2:41:03] hand god is a spirit but at the right
[2:41:06] hand means in power and authority of god
[2:41:10] that in the in that name everything in
[2:41:13] heaven is named after and subject to it
[2:41:15] everything on earth is named after it's
[2:41:17] subject to it it's a name above all
[2:41:19] names jesus christ now this logos that
[2:41:22] was in him which was the spirit of god
[2:41:24] the anointing through the sanctifying
[2:41:27] grace of the blood brought many sons to
[2:41:31] god
[2:41:33] which is anointed with the same logos
[2:41:38] so yeah again i want you to get it you
[2:41:40] know brother branham was anointed but
[2:41:42] you are anointed
[2:41:44] his office made him a prophet a
[2:41:47] messenger the eighth you know you'll
[2:41:49] never be that
[2:41:51] but you are a believer
[2:41:53] amen if you're a woman you'll never be a
[2:41:55] preacher you're not gifted to preach
[2:41:58] stay off of facebook and quit preaching
[2:42:00] there
[2:42:04] quit blessing out on instagram and all
[2:42:06] the other stuff
[2:42:08] amen
[2:42:10] you have no business trying to
[2:42:12] straighten people out and handling the
[2:42:14] word of god stop it
[2:42:18] let me just tell you you don't see me on
[2:42:20] there doing it
[2:42:21] do you and i'm called of god
[2:42:25] amen because i'm not casting pearls
[2:42:27] through the swine
[2:42:28] and i'm not putting our dirty laundry of
[2:42:30] the message out for everybody to read
[2:42:34] and i'm not getting on there to debate
[2:42:36] with this and that one
[2:42:39] and neither should you
[2:42:41] the message is not debatable
[2:42:44] i believe it that settles it god does
[2:42:47] not argue neither does his children so
[2:42:49] shut up
[2:42:51] and start facing this book
[2:43:03] and if you don't like it
[2:43:04] lump it
[2:43:09] say that's the pruitt coming out it's
[2:43:11] the holy ghost pruitt coming out of it
[2:43:16] hebrews 2 10 said he's bringing many
[2:43:19] sons to glory
[2:43:21] say many
[2:43:22] not just one many
[2:43:25] you see the message is not about brother
[2:43:27] branham he's only part of the story
[2:43:30] he's an important part of the story
[2:43:34] hey man a very integral part
[2:43:36] but that's not what it's about it's
[2:43:38] about a bride
[2:43:40] and he happened to be a part of that
[2:43:42] bride and we the bride have received the
[2:43:46] message
[2:43:47] [Applause]
[2:43:49] and it wasn't brother breton's message
[2:43:51] it was god's message to his bride
[2:43:56] he happened to be the messenger
[2:44:00] but he's also
[2:44:03] one of us
[2:44:05] who received a message
[2:44:07] it was applicable to him and his family
[2:44:09] as it is to us
[2:44:12] holiness is not for just the rest of us
[2:44:15] it's for the branham family too
[2:44:18] amen pastors and not just for us it's
[2:44:20] for the branham family too
[2:44:22] preaching is not just for uh not just
[2:44:25] for us it's for the branham family too
[2:44:28] [Music]
[2:44:29] exactly right
[2:44:30] even even tapes the message left let
[2:44:33] mine is not brother branham's
[2:44:35] intellectual property it was god's word
[2:44:38] through a prophet
[2:44:41] so it's my message
[2:44:44] so don't get mad at me when i quote my
[2:44:46] messenger
[2:44:48] because it's a message of god to the
[2:44:50] laodiceans
[2:44:51] whom we happen to be a part of this age
[2:44:56] we're the bright elect part but
[2:44:58] nevertheless we're the bart
[2:45:00] romans 8 29 for whom he did for know
[2:45:05] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[2:45:08] in the image of his son i like this
[2:45:10] when i was just a boy preacher i read it
[2:45:12] there in the original greek and it said
[2:45:15] for as many as he knew before
[2:45:18] then he also marked out to be copies of
[2:45:20] himself
[2:45:23] god selected you to be a copy of him
[2:45:27] in his image and his likeness
[2:45:30] not a cheap reproduction but a copy
[2:45:33] by the rebirth
[2:45:35] amen what was it it was a replicating of
[2:45:39] his gene
[2:45:41] for we was his gene that he had in his
[2:45:43] mind before the world began and it was
[2:45:45] in us
[2:45:46] when we were born but came alive when we
[2:45:48] were born again
[2:45:50] quickened
[2:45:51] you see that he might be
[2:45:54] help me read this
[2:45:55] the
[2:45:57] first born among
[2:46:00] many brethren amen
[2:46:05] so you see again again it's about
[2:46:08] many now the day of pentecost
[2:46:12] the logos
[2:46:14] the pillar of fire broke apart
[2:46:18] and tongues of fire set upon each of
[2:46:21] them
[2:46:22] an elected selected group identified by
[2:46:25] the pillar of fire showing that god had
[2:46:27] separated himself into man
[2:46:30] did you get it the god the logos
[2:46:32] separated himself into men god not in
[2:46:35] one person he's in his church universal
[2:46:40] and that's the reason he said the works
[2:46:41] that i do shall you do more now i know
[2:46:43] king james says greater but right the
[2:46:46] right translation said more than this
[2:46:47] shall you do god was bottled and
[2:46:50] confined in one man jesus christ but now
[2:46:54] brother l say now
[2:46:57] amen now he
[2:46:59] right now god is here
[2:47:02] embodied and confined in the whole
[2:47:05] universal church of the living god
[2:47:09] amen he's in africa
[2:47:12] amen you groups in africa listening this
[2:47:15] morning you don't have your church
[2:47:18] amen you're listening in brother caitlin
[2:47:20] let me know he his church was listening
[2:47:22] and at least his family in south africa
[2:47:24] he's in south africa he's in asia he's
[2:47:27] in europe he's in england wherever
[2:47:30] believers are gathered together there he
[2:47:32] is in the midst of them
[2:47:34] amen can i say he's the same god in
[2:47:37] texas
[2:47:38] or north carolina
[2:47:40] amen or oklahoma
[2:47:43] amen you see wherever believers are
[2:47:45] gathered together there he is in the
[2:47:47] midst of you see you don't have to
[2:47:49] belong to evening like tabernacle
[2:47:52] you don't have to come here he's
[2:47:53] appearing all over the world
[2:47:56] amen
[2:47:59] you just got to recognize his appearance
[2:48:01] you got to welcome his appearance
[2:48:04] you see it's the same logos
[2:48:07] that
[2:48:08] led moses and the children of israel
[2:48:11] the logos that was on jesus
[2:48:13] he come back from the physical form of
[2:48:16] his corporal body back to pillar of fire
[2:48:19] and is now descended on earth and has
[2:48:21] come down
[2:48:22] for an investigating judgment
[2:48:25] so it's a separating time
[2:48:27] it's a handing the opening of the book
[2:48:30] to abraham's seed
[2:48:33] it's revealing the mystery of redemption
[2:48:37] the change the promised son this is all
[2:48:40] happening and disappearing
[2:48:42] amen sarah's going to have a child
[2:48:46] amen about this time of life he gives
[2:48:48] the promise of the of the promise of the
[2:48:50] coming son
[2:48:52] you know the the salvation of loss of
[2:48:54] lord lot who represents the church who
[2:48:58] goes into tribulation all of this lays
[2:49:01] in this end time of appearing
[2:49:03] and god has identified that he is he is
[2:49:07] present in the form of the pillar of
[2:49:10] fire the logos as i said the picture was
[2:49:13] taken and it was not psychology it was
[2:49:16] not imagination it was actually there
[2:49:19] so what's the words of it the same
[2:49:21] spirit that was upon him has come up to
[2:49:24] the body again to bring us back to
[2:49:27] headship again
[2:49:29] amen and the last the last part of this
[2:49:34] is where god is taking and gathering the
[2:49:37] last stones
[2:49:40] somebody hear me preach
[2:49:42] the last stones to go in the building
[2:49:45] are now being added and shaped
[2:49:50] amen to fit the capstone so the same
[2:49:54] ministry that he had 2 000 years ago is
[2:49:57] the same ministry that he has at the end
[2:50:00] time
[2:50:01] where that the head and the body can
[2:50:04] unite together in such harmony that the
[2:50:07] two are one
[2:50:12] lord
[2:50:13] amen
[2:50:14] i am not he
[2:50:16] i'm his servant
[2:50:18] the pillar of fire is not he
[2:50:21] you see it was not the flesh of the man
[2:50:23] jesus but it's his spirit the holy ghost
[2:50:26] is christ and spirit formed the same
[2:50:29] spirit
[2:50:30] that was upon the son of man jesus
[2:50:32] christ
[2:50:34] has now come to anoint sons of men
[2:50:38] to bring back a ministry
[2:50:41] like he said it would be in order for
[2:50:44] the head and the rest of the body
[2:50:46] to be there
[2:50:48] so he cannot come
[2:50:52] until a church of body believers in the
[2:50:54] ministry he once had
[2:50:56] will have to be the same as it was then
[2:50:59] if it had tongues in it then it has to
[2:51:02] have tongues in it now
[2:51:04] if it had prophecy then it has to have
[2:51:07] prophecy now
[2:51:08] if it had divine healing then it has to
[2:51:11] have divine healing now
[2:51:14] the same ministry
[2:51:16] the same christ
[2:51:18] the same jesus
[2:51:22] jesus christ the same yesterday
[2:51:25] today
