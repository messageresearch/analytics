========================================

[Music] in the morning when I Rise I lift my head and turn my eyes to the window where the light is shining through [Music] when my feet hit the ground I know a place where love is found so I go where I know I'll find the truth I turn to Jesus I turn to the one who knows my name I know he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am save and honestly I could give a million different reasons for why I turn I turn to Jesus when the night starts to fall and I'm worried I won't sleep at all and my heart is afraid of what's ahead there's a voice through the chaos that comforts me and gives me rest when I'm weary and I'm longing for a friend I turn to Jesus I turn to the one who knows my name I know he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am save and honestly I could give a million different reasons for why I turn I turn to [Music] Jesus Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face and the things of this world will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace I turn to Jesus I turn to the one who knows my name I know he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am safe and all honestly I could give a million different reasons for why I turn I turn to Jesus [Applause]
