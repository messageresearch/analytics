Description:
Sung at the August 8th Memorial for Sister Karen Pruitt

Song by Bill and Gloria Gaither

A country where no twilight shadows deepen
Unending days where night will never be
A city where no storms will ever gather
Oh, this is just what Heaven means to me

What will it be when we get over yonder
And join the throng upon the glassy sea?
Will join our loved ones and crown Christ forever
Oh, this is just what Heaven means to me

See, it's a place where there is no misunderstanding
Out there from all enmity and strife we'll be free
There no unkind words that wound the heart are spoken
And this is just what Heaven means to me

What will it be when we get over yonder
When we'll join the throng upon the glassy sea
We'll join our loved ones and crown Christ forever
Oh, this is just what Heaven means to me
Oh, this is just what Heaven means to me
