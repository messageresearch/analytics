me and Brother David mayor to come and be a part of the meetings and and uh there while I was in Germany with brother Tim and and um we was able to uh there goes so we'll let him speak Shalom brother here Pastor days of the voice Fellowship in campala Uganda receive my Christian greetings on behalf of our assembly where we just concluded our second annual Youth Camp bringing together Saints from a total of nine countries this has been one of a kind young people Gathering from all again well sorry we're we're we're working with some new stuff here try it again Shalom brother here Pastor days of the voice Fellowship in campala Uganda receive my Christian greetings on behalf of our assembly where we just concluded our second annual Youth Camp bringing together Saints from a total of nine countries this has been one of a kind young people Gathering from all over I believe I would be justified to say that these were Supernatural meetings where many young people have had an encounter with the Lord with many delivered healed revived filled with the Holy Ghost and others saved we actually had over seven Souls that accepted Jesus Christ as their personal savior surely we Are Witnesses of what the Lord did through the ministry of our precious Brothers Timothy Brother David in all the services who were our main speakers as well as our brother T and brother morgas who were our devotional speakers special thanks to you brother Tim PR and the assembly in Louisiana for sending brother Timothy our way his ministry is just one uh what that we needed at such a time as this over 450 young people came physically and many more streaming all over Africa have been beneficiary of these God ordained meetings thank you to the assembly in France for allowing your pastor our brother David for coming we have sincerely been enriched by this God called Ministry God bless you richly and and we are looking forward to another wonderful time come 2025 Shalom God bless you all amen Amen brother bus has um just found him to be a wonderful wonderful man of God and and uh he's um uh he's a little little different if I can say it that way than than what you may think of as uh Africans you know he don't we we me and me nor Brother David put one bit of our own money into this meeting but he had he had the faith to believe that if God called it and it was God ordained God would fulfill the needs and so uh it's it's public it's there online so I mean he got up before his own people and stood and said you know we are not Beggars we're that's not who we are we're Children of the most high God and if God can take care of those Brothers over there in other countries he can take care of us and Supply our needs and so so um they were facing a bit of a debt because as you can see this is a really nice campus that they had rented and this is actually the hall that we had made met in from this I think it's a side view of it but it's real beautiful little area there that we met and cost quite a bit of money but every they P pulled all of their resources pastors from all over sent money in from different places in Africa to support it and and God really blessed it and we're we're thankful for God called me that'll step out in faith and believe that if God can provide for others he can provide for us and he did that and so this is just some of the some of the scenery this is actually a picture from our hotel there um uh not all that you see is as pretty as it really or what it really looked like but this was it was incredible it was a beautiful little Garden area that um I forget the name of the um um the denominational system that actually owns this but they allowed them to rent it and as he said about 450 young people came and and the Lord just really moved and um in all of the areas um that right there I don't know if you can really see but that right there actually is the kitchen uh they cooked everything outside they they provided their own food they they uh provided U everything that U that they that they had and so um the food you know is it it it tasted good some of it uh brother bus would he would agree with me on that so uh but uh you know uh our our our stomachs are not their stomachs and so uh you have to watch yourself over there because um um just the way they keep their meats and different things is not uh the way we do and so yeah I got a little sick from it and uh and dealt with it as I got home thankfully it it waited till I got home before it really hit but um there's nothing like being sick on an airplane so that's U there go and they they they that's Believers cooking the food and they provided for 450 people and bought the food and done everything so but the bus is very organized in the way that he handles situations he he's got a church mainly of a lot of young people that he's witnessed to and brought into the message and and he allows them to be part and so he he makes them part of the team and and they all have their part to play and they all do it very well it was very well run and it was very well done so and this was a picture from the back as the meeting be to grow and of course we had the first service Friday night wasn't as many there on Friday night because they were still traveling in it's not easy you you know to travel you know uh just just for us to go to the hotel was only only about I think around 10 kilm which is maybe six miles or so but uh somewhere in there and and but it would take nearly an hour to get back and forth from our hotel to the to the meeting and so first night you know he I I don't know if I have the clip here but he had it play in there on his live stream and brother bus is um he's a a real enthusiastic man of God and he just singing and shouting on the way and we're going through potholes up and down and he's like no worry brother you're not late we're going to get there you know and so we got there and uh the Lord really moved and we're sure thankful yeah I'm not sure how this thing your enem looking to [Music] imposs another [Music] di but they came with the expectation you know uh it's a little different getting in a air conditioning car and taking a 30 minute ride I I it kind of blows my mind some people think that's a long ways to go to church some of these walk that far and uh would be there and they come with expectations to the the Lord would would meet them and I did that I don't know what I did how' I go back brother Michael there we go oh wait a minute Brother David mayor he's a as y'all know very wonderful brother and we love him very much but he had you know he he he he speaks about five languages and then I found out he sings in another one um he singing in Zulu right now he just says all of a sudden he just said do you know this song man the whole place just went nuts I'm like like are you kidding me I mean I'm I I'm glad we're not in a competition cuz I lose and man they just couldn't believe this man from from Europe knew their knew one of their songs and it just set them over to the top uh how do I get that to play like that don't know I don't know either Brother David Mary was in African he was an African he he was he was in [Music] here [Applause] [Music] brother yeah he's a he's one of a kind it was so funny you know he would come to church that last service he said now I'm done I'm done I'm going to kick back and just sit back and let you handle it it's like all right well for dur in the song service they got him back up to sing this song at the end I got him up to

here this morning by virtue of his word he promised and he never fails amen oh I've heard you sing the beautiful songs today of Zion washing his feet as you worshiped him making him welcome because we know he's here Among Us I know he's here cuz one thing I brought him here and I know you did too right here today is we speak about a God who never fails there are many people that has needs situations that are going on in their lives that are very difficult and I I just want to remind you as we go to prayer this this morning we serve a God who never fails we've seen him heal cancer not just once we've seen him do it numbers of time we've seen him he'll blame brain bleeds and give extension of Life we've seen him restore Health to where where a man wouldn't have to take oxygen for 3 years and extend his life you know we're not going to live here forever and God's got a predetermined destined time for us to leave because he's determined that these mortal bodies will not always be what we're in and until the change comes there will be those maybe even up to a day or so I don't know maybe hours before the change we may put them away in the grave but they're coming right back up you see the promise is ours the promise is ours today whether it's healing Deliverance whatever the need is even even yes even for your financial needs God cares he's he watches over the sparrow and he clothes the the flowers of the field and he said don't you know I know how to take care of you too so you can trust him for everything he's an everything God not just specializes in Hills and Valleys or you know or this problem or that but he specializes even in what men call impossible we're here today to go to the Lord in prayer I got a text from Brother Kenny Camp uh who uh asked me to pray this morning for sister Jeanie she was coming to church she went back to bed with a sick headache she'll go to she'll go to the hospital for surgery tomorrow as the cancer has shrunk where that um it can be operated on the the surgery scheduled at 9:30 her doctors have been absolutely amazed that she's had very little or no side effects but you see we believe Mark 16 around here that if we take any deadly thing it'll not hurt us so we believe that and we apply that we also have um someone who's written in I believe they're from West Virginia but anyway that's where the aric Cod is from it's Robbie Davis and um but he's been recently diagnosed with cancer and he's asked that we would pray for him he even asked that I would maybe call and pray for him but I've alerted him today that we are praying for him in this service and you know I'm I'm not asking you to pray because we're just hoping that somebody body here has Faith to believe and one of you you know might do it but I believe that we're all people of faith that we've been taught to believe the word of God to believe the word of promises and that God is not just more than able he's more than willing one man would ask him one time lord if thou will you can heal me of this leprosy he didn't have to think about it he said I will be thy clean you see it is God's will to bring healing that's why he died for our deliverance I'm speaking to you too sister Jennifer God bless you you're here today doctors are saying she's going to need a kidney transplant well I know a good physician I've seen him work as he does the best job and he is more than able we're going to look to the Lord today as we go to prayer and believe God for these needs for Robbie there in in West Virginia don't give up hope don't don't think it's hopeless no we serve a living God for sister Jeanie there that is listening with her and brother Kenny together and facing surgery tomorrow w i remember I remember going into a hospital room and with sister Karen emmans before her surgery and they would go and she was all the tested said she had cancer in in her female glands they went in there after prayer and and you know the story I went in there brother Timothy just a young minister at that time he would preach on it I walked in there and I said what what do you want me to do with this cancer that was my question what do you want me to do about this how do you want me to pray she said cut his head off we had prayer with her that day they go in there the doctors are embarrassed come in there really embarrassed coming to the family said we don't know what happened we can't explain what happened but we we went in there and we didn't find anything that's the kind of God we serve amen now God would give her three more years of life and she needed that there was some things that she needed to get right with the Lord and and make peace with and she did that and God took her but you know that was her time but if Satan is standing before you today with the door of death you don't have to walk into it we have an intercessor and we can go to the judge and say we need a restraining order put on the devil amen that's called Divine Healing he's trying to take somebody they ain't made their three score and 10 and even if they have it doesn't really matter I mean Abraham didn't get his his real blessings until he was after 100 so we can believe God for every need that's what we are we are believers that's what believers do they believe will you believe with me today how many across this building will believe how many across the world will believe with me right now God bless you father in the name of Jesus as we come before your throne of grace it is there we find help in our time of need and it is there that we can come before the throne as it was today I come knocking on your door I've come approaching the throne of grace I know it's a throne of grace Lord Lord there was a time we could not approach that throne but you came and gave your life and became our approach to Spirit God so Lord Jesus we approach Spirit God through the man Christ Jesus who was God In the Flesh I pray dear father in the name of Jesus as we come by the way of the blood by the way of the Cross by the way day of the sufferings of Jesus Christ you remember Lord you suffered for jeie camp for Robbie Davis for Jennifer leay you suffered for the many needs that are there in the body you suffered for them you went to hell for for all of our sins and paid the ultimate price and you Rose up defeating death hell in the grave and you try of on that day over cancer over sickness over disease and today we are declaring Satan has already lost and we are taking back the health that was stolen from our brothers and sisters in the name of Jesus Christ I declare the word of God is true and that Satan is defeated and that he has to leave their bodies now in the name name of Jesus Christ for God's glory in Jesus name We Believe Lord with all of our hearts and we thank you for your words of Promise in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord amen may the Lord bless his word today as we look into his word thank you God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning oh my we've just been having one great outpour after outpouring of the Holy Spirit we are so thankful for that we're so grateful for what the Lord is doing and what the Lord has done and amen what he will do for he said I I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world how many believes he's with us how many believes he's in your life amen then he said I'll be there I'm not going to leave you comfortless I will come to you so he is our comforter our strength our guide this morning and we're looking to him amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 14 want to begin reading from this today I'm going to be speaking today on behold the word bride amen behold the word bride now Romans 8 verse 14 actually would be R the this chapter is probably one one of my all-time favorite chapters of the Bible for as many are as led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God how many believes he'll lead you and as I've often said it's not because we are you know put on cruise control and autopilot and we're just going to get there but if we're Sons we seek his leadership that proves our sunship we know who our father is for you have not received the spirit of bondage again of fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then Hees of God then heirs Hees of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestations of the sons of God Amen God bless you you can be seated amen I I tell you I we have such a wonderful word of God laying before us today and I I also wanted to mention that I I especially that I've so appreciated your prayers over this past um this past week and especially while I was in V Virginia course you didn't know that I was going it was to be a surprise for brother Ron and so I didn't make any kind of announcement that I was going to be going there but I'd been asked by Brother Andrew to go and as you know uh no sooner than I got there uh just just um as just within just after my arrival we um uh he got a phone call from the doctor telling him the news of of all of his um recent uh test um last night he he preached a masterpiece a wonderful service and and today they're going on down to um uh uh Florida and and from there we'll go on a little Cruise so they're having a little time of of RNR but anyway um this I went there and I had um had that time together with him I asked brother Donnie Reagan to come and to meet us there he also was really really gracious to put aside his busyness of his schedule and to come and we had a uh a tremendous time together and just you know a time of prayer and time of you know of the promises of God and and if you watched the service it was a very powerful and very mov Moving Service uh where that we have done what God what God's word told us to do and uh so we I believe have fully obeyed the Lord and it's um up to him amen we certainly want his will no matter what I want his will from my life no matter what amen and so sometimes we maybe don't maybe we don't understand God's will or his purpose or his plan but we know that we are in his hands and our lives are in his hands the other day I watched a an interview with an Israeli Israeli soldier as he was talking about um the events of the war that they are in and I mention this because I I believe that in many ways that we are um we parallel Israel they are the natural people we are the spiritual people and so even brother brandham told us he if if you want to know what time it is he said watch Israel see what's happening there and um you know we as I watched this interview he was telling how that Israel would never be the same as before October the 7th the day that they were attacked by the Hamas and um said the Army will not be the same said soet itself will not be the same and and of course uh many of our my brethren and myself included believe this is a precursor to the great battle of Armageddon that lays right ahead of us that we're that I wouldn't miss for the world now I'm going to go away but I'm going to come back for it right because there's a Rapture and a married supper of the lamb and the judgments being poured out upon the Earth and and then we will come back with him in Revelation 19 um following the the he that sits upon the White Horse the word of God and we will be following him coming back to take it over for the Millennium you can just look around the world today we're going to get it all back man it was stolen from him but we're going to get it all back but but this man was saying we have been living under the delusion that terrorists can be appeased and negotiated with and this has been a very strong wakeup call to the fact that you cannot negotiate with evil you cannot negotiate with someone who is saying my essential goal is destroy you and everything you believe in and if and and say if I give you something you will decide that's not your end goal and just remember uh we we fight an enemy and those same spirits that you saw physically attack Israel is against the bride in an ecclesiastical manner remember this it it comes against us in the ecclesiastical manner now we we had all that kind of uh convoluted some years ago and we thought the bride would go through all of that but you know that's that's not the promise the promise when the trumpets were um were placed for the prophet of God as like Joshua placing the people in the land and we were placed in the promises we were shown that uh again that the squeeze even that he talked about and and pondered over and and and thought well this will be perhaps when the third pull will work and and whatever he would come in the Feast of the trumpets after being revealed what portion was to Israel and that portion divided and said you know we don't go through that time and you know that he will keep us from his bride from everything that anything that would turn her hand and so he makes it clear the next thing for you is the rapture and we're in it we're a part of that Rapture and uh and but but again they come against us in an ecclesiastical manner in other words in a spiritual Manner and even using even using religion even we use quotes even and and it even can happen even from message pulpits or from from the pressures of of religion or whatever that that the very society that we're live in is is designed to kill your faith to destroy with you and you cannot negotiate with someone who's saying my essential goal is to destroy you and everything you believe in and say if I'll just give you something if I can to you know give you something I can appease you you know and you'll decide that's not your end goal and he said the Islamic has been stating openly for decades that is our goal the destruction of the Jewish people and everything they stand for and not just the Jewish people but everyone that everybody that believes like them the judeo-christian values Western values the concept of peace and Liberty they are opposed to all that of that they openly say again and again we want to destroy all this we want to take away your freedoms we want to take away your peace we want to take away your belief system we're going to kill you to do that and we have this Western mindset that maybe we can appease them maybe we can sort of keep it under control and this has been a very clear wakeup call for me personally for our country and for anyone who has eyes and ears to see and hear what is going on that there is a there is real good and there is a true evil evil so I and this I want you to keep the parallel this is really not what I'm preaching on this is just introducting an introduction this morning but Israel he says is a nation that says we are here by called to be here by God and the Nation of Islam that says we are called religiously to destroy you and and there is a force that is corrupted by e evil and hatred that opposes God's people and God's plan and I want you to say that is also true of the attack on the bride of Christ in this day because we are called here we have been brought here to this land of promise to the Bible Bible times Bible days to bible promises to to the word of God to his fullness and we and and yet the enemy is saying we are called to destroy you and and they are a force corrupted by evil and hatred it opposes God's people and God's plan so don't be surprised that you're under opposition that you're being opposed don't be S surprised that Satan will come right in and he'll bring diseases and afflictions and unbelief and doubt and and everything else make you look like a failure and that you are not in your Promised Land he'll do everything he can to bring destruction and dis and discouragement remember he's got to work there's there are spirits released in this day that has not even been before in other ages I I'm I'm quoting this from actually Revelation chapter 9 where he where there are 300,000 th000 that is 300 million demons that have been reserved that has been in that has been in the and held in the in the river Euphrates this is symbolic and and I could go into all the symbolism this morning we know it and I could go into it but I'm not but they've been held and released in this day against the bride and against Israel and they will also come against the remnant of the woman's seed which will be the leftovers from the bride who will go through the tribulation who will be exterminated there there's going to be such violence and such hatred and such such you know evil that is poured out that you cannot imagine I'm talking about you can see them with as it's witnessed Again by the slaughter of innocent Israeli civilians heartless demons put Israeli babies in ovens and baked them in front of their parents and then slaughter them cut open pregnant women yes raped them so many times until their pelvics was broke that's right yes killed parents before the children took children killed them before the parents and these demons they might have went dormant maybe you know look like you know they made an appeasement with them we'll let you little have this little piece of this of this land of promise you know you can have over here and call yourself Palestinians you can have your self rule you can do all of that but they didn't want that they wanted all of the promise they didn't they want to drive Israel all the way to the Sea they don't want an Israel that's and I tell you Satan does not want a bride amen you cannot appease him and you know they might these Devils these demons might have went dormant but they not but not really they went into hiding all of these years they have been building massive underground tunnels coming only up only to sin destruction and Satan that might have went under here and there and you hadn't seen him working here and there and wherever but brother he's showing his ugly head again and and this man goes on the sage from the top to bottom we need Supernatural wisdom we're dealing with something that is beyond the basis of war and conflict we're dealing with a supernatural hatred toward Israel that is executed by Islam that is um Hamas hasbalah and Iran and at the same time we're fighting a war that is of spiritual significance we must see the big picture and I and I I want you to see even see that the attack of Satan that will come against the Saints of God whether it be like I said with sickness or or whether it be with unbelief or depression or or even from the clergy because it's an ecclesiastical demon remember this I I I want you to know that the it is we must see the big picture of what's really going on Amen so you said pray for our leaders and pray for wisdom and energy and focus for our troops on the ground and for for resilience for our people the price that we are paying as a people for this level of conflict this level of violence this level of pain and hurt is going to be carried for a long time then he was asked the question do you see any future for your kids here in this land of Israel do you see any future you know you you know the thought is why not just all you Jews just pack up and leave is there any future in here is there a future for your kids I mean you know we just had a bunch wiped out and you missiles coming and and everybody's had to live with under this thing of of daily running to bomb shelters and sirenes going on is there any future for your kids here in this land of Israel and he says of course we have no other country and I want to say the same thing yes we have a future for our kids This Is Our Land God gave us an open book we don't want to just focus on one part we want to believe it all even the parts that have laid baren can bring forth life is brought in the right atmosphere sir amen and I say as this man goes on to say he said I say God gave us this land and we have lived in this land and this the promise was to have the land and to live in it and and there again that's our promise to have this land of the Bible and to live in it amen we're going to see it bring forth fruit we're going to plant faith and water it with the right atmosphere and we're going to see healings Miracles salvation Deliverance amen Revelation understanding come on we're going to have everything that the Bible we're going to have holy lives Sanctified lives forgiveness of sins Mercy Grace we're going to have everything that's in the promised land and all it requires is is is planting the word in that promise amen and watering it with Thanksgiving would you your Praises amen an expecting return and God will make the Barren Barren land Rejoice if there's barness in your life and in your family God is going to make that be fruitful and there is future for our young people amen there is Future and he says he says um but he said he said God gave us this land we have lived in this land and the promise was have the land and to live in it abundantly but no one said it was going to be easy that promise doesn't exist and no one said it's going to be without a fight this land has always been fought over it's always been fought over amen and he said so it has been fought for and that reality hasn't been changed and I want to say Paul faal fart as did irenius Martin columber Luther and brother brandham and we're right here to today fighting for it and he said and we every once in a while need a reminder that things that are valuable require pain and suffering to gain nobody no Miracle ever can can ever be performed without pain and suffering first come on amen amen you're you're going to get you you go through things God couldn't God now listen it's the devil doing it God God couldn't put sickness on you and then say oh well that's so I could be a Healer so I could express my attributes so I put that on you no God doesn't put that on you man by choice accepted this way of life and so we live here in Mortal bodies that SA Satan when he can't get to the word he can attack the the vessel that the word comes in so he attacks your body he can't destroy the word but he can destroy your body right so so he says he said we need to reminder that the things that are valuable require pain and suffering to gain you go back to Jesus on the cross nothing happens without sacrifice and pain the same goes with this land history says you're going to suffer we are strong people that God has that has a god that is omnipotent all powerful all knowing and is in control our Sovereign God always has been he is Sovereign and he's always has been we have nothing to fear pain is fleeting and sacrifice for this land and to hold on to this land um is required and and the reality is that no one grows and no one transforms as an individual as a people without pain and fear right now we have a lot of pain and a whole lot of fear and it's time for God to work that's the way I feel this morning right now there's a lot of uncertainty in this world Lord right now there's a lot of pain Lord there's still suffering going on in every hand but it's time for God to work that's what I preached at brother Ron in case you'd want to know I preached on the hour has come because we are here in the in the appointed hour where God is time for God to work now rising up at this time is a word born bride as brother brandham told us as the end time prophecies will repeat I believe as a forerunner came from the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of God the second Forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride this is what that he said that we would be pointing to that he would be forerunning the the a a a bride that would be born of this word would actually be created by this word when there was no bride God sent a message a word to create one amen now and of course as if she's going to be a word born bride then as I preached before I left she'll be adopted and placed and and position in the promised land of the Bible as I have preached now for some some years the people of the book has returned to the land of the book we Are the People people of the book now and of course we again God's bringing forth adopted Sons now again forget about the idea of adopting a baby this is not the term the way the term is used it it means to take a man who is mature and put him in position as heir of all things so it was the ancient law that Paul is using of the of the Romans way of adop option of placing someone and you know in this case God is placing his own children Sons mature Sons into position into places of authority now and of course there the idea comes up you know well somehow or another we um we we're we're going to get um um we're going to get someday get adopted and and and one day is going to happen let me just tell you there was not one example in the New Testament of Peter James and John or Paul being filled with the spirit and then adopted not one example so you'd have to have Bible pattern for that and there is none no when they were filled with the spirit they were placed in the body with power and authority amen you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you so yes brother bradam did use that and said you who have been born again and spoke of of the Pentecostals the Baptist the Methodist and all of them you he said that birth is not your placing he was pointing to something greater coming which was the coming of the token life the personal life of Jesus Christ which would bring a people into a place of authority where they would be the word bride a word church now if I can get time to get into it this morning we're going to understand what a word church is all right because there's a a misunderstanding about that but brother bam talks about this in the message Masterpiece and he he tells us his old sermon goes back to Christ being the Masterpiece being built up from the four corners of the foundation of of Abraham and Grace and Isaac of love and Jacob of of um well faith and and then gra and faith and then God's grace and then upon there the the love of God and then coming right down to Perfection to Joseph and he says you know it was built on that Perfection cuz it was aiming toward a Capstone so everything that would be built on God's Masterpiece would be pointing to the head and the head then would come which would there would then be the unveiling of what God had been doing through the Jewish ages are you with me now so again for nearly 2,000 years he said that God had been or uh now has God had been making a masterpiece and and again he just as he struck a part of off of Adam here he was God's Masterpiece but he struck a part out of him to make Eve and and he said a part of him to make a wife for him and he said now that per perfect Masterpiece he struck him at Calvary here he brought him up and he struck him and a piece come off of him and he said it's just a new testament that's all he said he fulfilled the Old Testament now the New Testament is another piece to be fulfilled see the new and old is husband and wife it taking the old to foreshadow the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece is in the making so here here we have it his bride will fulfill everything just as Jesus fulfilled the Psalms and would fill fulfilled the wisdom of Solomon and uh you know the prophets and their prophecies and the law of Moses here Jesus was the embodiment of all of that so the fullness of the godhead would be in Bride form what he has been doing Through the Ages the justification of Luther the sanctification of Wesley the the gifts of the Spirit of of ausa Street and now right into the end where that we come back to the original the original wheat that was planted now of course Satan has used his Venom to tear us down to try to discourage us he's attacking us with sickness with diseases and trouble but I want to to say again we will not leave this land although they threatened us to annihilate us from the river to the sea but now and since Satan cannot overcome the spirit of the Lord it will try to destroy the vessel and who the spirit of Truth dwells listen to what brother Bram said in the Ephesian Church age no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the Spirit in tongues prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God and because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells so you're under attack he can't get to the word he can't stop the word so he comes against he comes against the men of God he comes against the women of God he comes against the whole Church of God he he's against you and he's bringing you got to recognize when when and get your Shield of Faith up come on you got to recognize when the fiery darts of the Devil comes when doubt and unbelief comes and depression and fear and worry and all these other things you you got to realize you got a real enemy and you got to hold your Shield of faith up and ward off the fiery darts of the wicked but it's time church that we realize it's more than just stay in defense Israel had done that over and over again you know they had their Iron Dome they had their Shield up we can knock down your missiles where they can reach our people and they were comfortable about they built their fence and we've got a uh you know fence that between us and you and and and we we put millions and millions of dollars in it and we we and they went to sleep under that that umbrella of safety and the enemy comes in because they were asleep we cannot sleep in this hour we got to be vigilant amen because our enemy The Devil he's going about he's not a roaring lion but he goes like a roaring lion he com screaming and Howling amen the real lion is the tribe of Judah he's an impersonator he's a liar and a thief is that right he comes in to as a thief to Rob and to kill and destroy amen so now I just want to say again and make you realize you are under attack you're going to be under attack and he's going to come every way he can but it's time that we take the war to the enemy yes and that's what I've been doing you know I'll tell you what I mean I it I tell you what it really accelerated when he attacked sister Atlanta man I determined I'm going to preach Faith ever service I'm going to pound that enemy I'm going to be like a hammer and I'm going to hammer till he SM to Pieces we're going to stand on the promise and we're going to see victory amen you see that that was that was more more of a wakeup call to realize he we got a God in our midst and he's omnipotent let's unleash his power let's learn how to throw the bombs of prayer that are more powerful than an atomic bomb let's learn how to fight back to resist the enemy hallelujah it's when you resist him he flees from you now through the prophet messenger and then dwell in spirit we have been restored back to being the word I want you to get this we are the word yes we are the message amen we are the word made flesh therefore the very works of Christ is being produced again in the body oh then what day for sons of God to rise on the scene amen it's been prophesied therefore predestined for this age in this time and here we are to fulfill the New Testament 2,000 years he' been building the Masterpiece but he's about to take that piece that was smitten from him at Calvary and bring it back to his side and there'll be a Rapture in a going home so that's why I say said behold look the Lamb's the bride the Lamb's wife I want to say it again behold the word bride she's the word we we are the bride because the word and the spirit has come in his fullness therefore because of its fullness we are a mature age this thus this is the bride age this is the word age the token Age The Eagle age the weed age we could go on and on the you know it's the fourth light therefore it brings forth the grain now that might be that you might say huh a forth light well the light you know Shone through darkness and the haze of Catholicism to show Luther enough light for justification amen the light grew in intensity through Wesley and uh until it came to sanctification and then it would grow in brilliance through the isua movement let me stop for a minute and and and help you in your thinking if you would plant the wheat seed in the in the strength of the light of the summer and that little green blade come out what would happen to it it would die it would wither and die Sun's too strong for it right but there is a time where the weat will need need that light but not in the blade so actually in our part of the country is planted in you know usually as winter wheat and it'll it'll it'll grow and and the light the length of days and the the the heat of the Sun and you know it's a lot of cloudy days and rain and here comes that little blade up and then as the sun gets strengthened and and the days get longer what happens to the wheat it grows and it moves from the stage of the blade into the tsel and the pollen amen and then then then again again comes up and then there it heads up into where there's a sh that was a Zeus's tree but then finally as we call it the fourth light or the light for the four stades of wheat amen it it comes in its full strength this is this is why in Revelation 10 his face is as it were the sun his coming in this day is with an unveiled face and his face is as it were the sun it's in the fullness of the word in the full power and the full strength to do what now that light full light would have killed the blade it wouldn't have been good for the tussle it wouldn't have worked for the sh but for you it brings the church back to be the original grain ripened exactly like it was when it was planted on the day of [Applause] Pentecost so now the light has shown to the Hast but at the evening time so there will be a day it'll be a time there won it won't be like day night you know you know cloudy days and hazy and you don't see clearly and you know some will look look and and still seeing God as three people and I and a and a and a false baptism and all kinds of false ideas why the light wasn't there come on Amen but in the evening time this is what the Bible said it shall be light hence the name evening light Tabernacle because we're to be the Tabernacle of the evening light the church to the evening light come on Amen we're not the Church of Lutheran are we be called Lutheran we're not the Church of westl or we be called methodists after his methods we're not the Church of isusa street we are the evening light now of course I don't mean every Church everywhere has to be named evening light but that's why I named it evening light you know the evening light is because it's the Harvest Time what is needed to bring the wheat to maturity we are the bride because it's the fourth stage of restoration now there's not four stages to the birth don't get that confused there are four stages of restoration God would restore the church in four stages justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost into gifts and then finally his fullness so which is token life so we we we are the bride because it is the fourth stage of restoration the wheat grain age exactly the church that was planted in the beginning manifested in the same form it was back there now as brother brandham said in the EP in the church ages he said when Jesus was born upon the Earth he said believest thou not that I'm in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work John 14:10 here it is most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works that's exactly what we've been teaching all along when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced now you can see the expectation as Jesus showed the the indwelling spirit manifesting in work word and works help me preach now word and works when the bride gets back to be in a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced now it's the hour where the Holy Ghost comes in fullness as it was at Pentecost the token of today is the Holy Ghost it is not just an isua anointing or mere baptism upon the flesh nor a baptism upon the spirit on the human Spirit but it is the literal Life of Christ returning back to live and dwell in The Believer and that's exactly what they received in Acts 2 yeah they had emotion yes they had shouting yes they had speaking in tongues but what came was not tongues or motion or jumping or running or shouting what came was him that caused them to speak a Heavenly language amen and jump and shout and rejoice because of what they received I don't know why that's so hard for people to understand they get upset because somebody jumps and shouts well I'm I mean we receive something that's why amen well I mean some people jump and shout when they just get Sanctified well praise God if I had cigarettes taken away from me I jump and Shout about that too wouldn't [Applause] you now in the message token brother Bram tells us that God is requiring a token that you yourself has received the token the Holy Ghost it's the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it is a literal life of Jesus Christ return back to the believer so there it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back to the believer that's what the token is amen it's not a justification it's not just a sanctification although it does sanctify and justify and and causes you to Bubble over into Heavenly language amen it can do all of that but whatever it's the literal life of Jesus Christ return back to the believer this this is the token age brother Brandon would talk about this and he called it um in in um how can I overcome this is the age of the personal life of Christ you see where the chemical of his body what was in him now is made manifest in other words the Justified life Sanctified life all what they've had in the past it's God building his Great Masterpiece are you with me so he he tells us again that that we've had the water age the blood age but now is the token age of the Holy Ghost now again I I want to emphasize this is not like the zza baptism at all who still needed did the adoption and be placed as Sons The Token is the adoption and it places and positions us his son and anyone who has received the token has received the adoption robe of the spirit the Ring of identification and Authority on their finger and place into the kingdom to do the father's business amen now he calls it again in a message he said we have re received the supernatural Supreme token and so Supreme is the highest ranking a you know and a token is a sign so the highest ranking sign we have been given a supernatural Supreme highest ranking sign the literal life of Jesus Christ praise God now all that was that foreshadowed has been given to this generation this is what you got to understand all that was foreshadowed has been given to it other ages received other signs the Old Testament their sign of acceptance was the blood of an innocent lamb won't work today not that woolly lamb right and by the death of that lamb and by PL its blood they were accepted but it won't work today other ages for foreshadowed our age to be justified by faith and believing on the Lord Jesus Christ you see that was a sign of Acceptance in Luther's day and then Wesley received a greater sign that was of sanctification and and and he he ascended in the spirit there was more poured out and they were shouted and were slain in the spirit and but more importantly they were cleansed and had works of righteousness amen then more of the spirit was poured out in isusa street now Joel says in the last days did you ever notice that not last day last days brother Bram says 2,000 years he would pour out his spirit so this has been God pouring out his spirit through down to the ages now to this time where as I said he he empties or pours out his fullness into a bride people to make them a word bride now so again more the spirit was poured out of the zeusa street and they were not only justified by faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ they had works of righteousness as also being Sanctified and and and they were as God raised them higher than Luther and Methodist their language got Quicken to a Heavenly language as gifts of the Spirit were poured out and that baptism was a sign to them that they were accepted amen but we have risen higher you see this is we are ascending come on as Satan's falling we are ascending amen you say well I believed on the Lord Brother Tim and I'm justified by faith well congratulations praise God for that you're on par with the lutherans and with the Baptist you've got that far I sitting the M the church that's as far as you got you're still a Baptist you're still a Lutheran sorry don't want to bust your bubble but you're not bride till you get the token amen you you you potentially maybe but you're not there yet and you certainly aren't adopted and placed are you with me now so you say well but but really brother Tim I believe the message yeah that was a good sign for Luther but you got to rise higher than that today cuz when brother brandham said you say I believe the message brother brandham he said yes but you must have the token you say well I I quit drinking man God took that from me like that and he cleansed me from alcohol and tobacco and drugs or you can say I'm a lady used to cut my hair wear shorts and paint my face well praise God you're just a good oldfashioned Methodist now don't don't throw rotten eggs at me I'm not in the mood for running I I'll face right up to it and you say well I've spoken tongues and I have gifts of the Spirit and I shout and dance in the aisle well that's a good sign and you've just come as far as is of Pentecostals but you must come further than that you must have his life within the soul and that's the word in its fullness and I'm not talking about a Doctrine I'm talking about the life so now we have the Holy Ghost is our token is our identification that we've accepted the death of the lamb now Not only was Jesus just a human life to come back on it but it was God himself manifest in flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons now that now we are the sons and daughters of God that is the the token is our identification that we have believed God and God has accepted so the token is the adoption that is why this adoption message are the cap are is the Capstone for the believer and this is this makes the believer Messiahs filled with the Billow fire putting them and placing them in the service this did not happen under this isusa Street Revival yeah they manif ested gifts under the anointing of the spirit but this is the token age where the life and the power of Christ must be on display now brother bradam talks about some of this in gowake Jesus he said they should have known them disciples he was a messiah the word Messiah means the anointed one he he had God he had all of God in him God was in him he said I Jesus's son I said I can do nothing in myself but what I see the father doth the father dwelleth in me he was the Messiah by that with that anointing made him fully Messiah and we with the same spirit that was upon him not in portion but the same quality with a portion upon us would make us like Messiahs would be little sons of God adopted sons of God and Holy Spirit has sealed us into his body and we are his children there should be nothing bother us nothing worry us we're his amen once you're sealed in there the devil cannot pull you away come on amen he said well if that's if it ain't he said we're false accuser we've been testifying of things that ain't so and I believe it I believe that now we're the sons of God not we will will be but right now and now we're seated together in Heavenly places in Jesus that's our position we have been positioned in a Heavenly place somebody with me now as we we think of this he said now I I'm going to give that position it's going to be given to someone there's somebody predestined to sit on my right hand and on my left they're going to sit with me in the throne they're going to have that same token life and be in Heavenly places positioned in Christ with every devil underneath their feet now there'll be people there has to be a people who are the word bride who are one with the word who do you say this is brother bradam said I wondered this great thing this ecumenical C we got in the world today World Council of churches forming together to make us all one I wanted they realize it that's exactly what the scriptures said they would do but they think it's the most wonderful thing in the world that all of us can join hands and be one that Jesus prayed that we might be one they said that's true but not that kind of one you see that's Babylon that's a forc religion let all just all come together and come under one headship this is what Satan is doing this day with the E communal move but he said be one as I and the father are one yeah be that kind of one then how will that be the word in us would be the anointed word that's the Oneness of God see the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you and then you become a son a messiah of the age so you have been brought into Oneness with God not the E communal kind that brings everybody together under one headship but coming under the headship of Christ one with him how by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are birthed into the body and the body is him my hands my feet my eyes it's all me the body is him Hallelujah and when you're baptized in that body when you're part of that church you are him come on now he uses Moses he said Moses was the anointed word that was promised for that day amen that's what Moses was Abraham had prophesied that he would come said for you know for 400 years you'll so journey in a Strange Land and after that I'll bring you out with a mighty hand Moses would be that Mighty hand he was prophesied many years 400 years before and here he was you know there he was now come became the anointed word for the AIDS that prophecy anointed don't let this go over your head you are the word the New Testament anointed amen the great sh kind of Glory was all around him every move he made represented God and he said that's where the church ought to be standing now again and as he continues on he said them them prophets you know there he said you know they would obey what God's word said and led by the spirit and he said give me a church that's so Anointed with god Till There ever move in action is dust sayith the Lord and walk in action kind of glory and I'll show you a messiah an anointed one of God standing on the earth and I want to declare today there is an anointed Messiah it's the Bride of Jesus Christ and she's standing on the earth now there stood Moses by his burning bush and the kind of glory and he and he he he didn't he was just obeying what God Said to do stick your hand in your bosom bring it out amen stick it back in and be healed what is a Divine Healing is that right amen and and so you know here again he was shown he would bind the serpent who who who was in the the people of the vision where the serpent is to be bound in this last day you're in that Vision amen there is a people on Earth today who will bind the devil who will bind death itself who will call for the resurrection and the dead in Christ arise this is where we're at this is the hour for it the hour has come now you see again said you know he said God took them right straight into the promised land it didn't matter whether it was unbelievers Egyptians make Believers everything else but God took them straight to that Promised Land he was he was they were anointed he was the Messiah then he said how can a man say he's a Christian filled with the Holy Ghost and deny the word is the same yesterday today and forever the Holy Ghost in you will punctuate every word amen amen amen when the word says anything you say that's the truth amen it doesn't matter if it's Holiness you'll say that's the truth it doesn't matter what how you if it's baptism in the name of Jesus Christ you'll say that's the truth if it says repent and be be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost you can say that's the truth that's for me don't get the idea just holler an amen from your seat any poly parot can do that you can teach a parrot to say Amen you can teach people just to say Amen that can become a form of godliness exactly right amen but you are the anointed word in your life agrees with the word whatever he says amen so be it let it be in my life Lord now the pillar of fire he said in the message Paradox is identified scientifically and by the same reaction by its character and everything else just the same as it was as it was when it was dwelling in the body of God's only begotten son so does it dwell in the body of his adopted Sons for the last day you are a people of the pillar of fire the embodiment of the pillar of fire now God let us do something very special in this day he let us have an an identified Masterpiece he let us have a a time- tested Memorial he let us have signs in this day that other ages wasn't able to have 74 years ago this month in Houston Texas the photo of the pillar of fire was taken 74 years ago it was taken as a debate was held between campbellites represented by Mr best and those who were believing in Hebrews 138 rest represented by FF Bosworth and God Vivic himself bearing witness that the message is true that truly God has sent Elijah as is promised that the pillar of fire has returned can I say it to this generation and I want to say because brother brandham left is hadn't left it is still here but it's embodied in a people each one of you have an hard of that lick of fire that's what happened on the day of Pentecost somebody help me preach it happened that way so he says it's harvest time then then there must come upon the scene in those AGS those who will bring the wheat and the tears to maturity the tears are already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who turn the people from the word so that will that will bring terrs to maturity but the word wheat must also mature and to her God is sending the prophet messenger with the Vindicated Ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they will hear him as the first church heard Paul and she are you ready for this she will mature in the word un becoming a word bride the mighty Works will be found in her that are always attended upon the pure word and Faith so let's get it clear what what was the whole purpose of it is that God would send a message to bring a bride to maturity the light amen and they will hear him as the first church heard Paul and she will mature in the word unto becoming a word bride and the mighty Works will be found in her that are always attended upon the pure word and Faith so you can't have the pure word without Mighty works am you can't be a Word Church Without Mighty Works come on now when an individual in Christ becomes one that person is an adopted son as brother Bram said in the in Jehovah Gyra the very life that was in Christ is in you that shows he's your Redeemer he's adopted you into God and now we are Sons and Daughters of God with the spirit of God Amen The Works that I do you'll do also and greater this for you do for I go to my father he talks about how in the message look if you hadn't listened to it it's a great message one in Phoenix in the in April 28th I I I was reading it one time on a on a on an airplane and and um you know just came out of meetings I I just sat there and wept through the whole thing because brother Brandon was talking about how that you know you could take a camera and he used an example of having a camera and and he had it there but it was out of focus instead of seeing one deer out there what his he was seeing three deer and he said you know Billy something's wrong with this thing and he said that it's out of focus so he he focused it and and all the three became one amen now the same thing and he begins his old message of look look what are you looking at if you say look what is there to look at I've got to bring it in focus and that's what this message is to do is to bring all of these truth into Focus amen what Luther had W Hada had whatever had bring it all together into one glorious message tying the loose ends together where you can see clearly a bride a word bride right so people he said with it out of focus try to say these words for for for for another age he said it is if you're still out from under the blood hello but if you're under the blood the power by the word by his word Remains the Same it's got to be the same If he if he could do that by the blood of sheep and animals and what about the blood of Christ you know I can't I just can't skim over this sorry I got to bring it out people try to say the words those words was back for another age they don't have to put it back too far they can just say it was just for the Divine Healing movement they can just say it was just in brother bram's time but we we're in a different season you see yes the reason they think that they got the word out of focus amen and it's and they're bringing seeds of discrepancy because you see a seed of discrepancy will be any preacher who will stand and say that Jesus Christ is not the same in every detail that's except for his Corporal body I want you to understand that's what we believe here we believe he is the same in every detail except his Corporal body cuz right here here's the Corporal body he's in the bride so now if you're out from under the blood it is those words was for another but he said if you're under the blood the power by of God for his word Remains the Same it's got to be the same and he said if he could just do that by the blood of sheep and animals what about the blood of Jesus Christ I could do it we must we must cope our lives and focus it in the word of God just like we would picture a camera or try to get the right Focus before we snap it and then when we got the real true picture and that's what we want to do is focus our lives into Jesus Christ that Christ and you become the same person you are a son adopted to God by the blood of the righteous Jesus Christ so when you get it into Focus you will see you are a son adopted by God positioned as a word bride in this last day to defeat the enemy you ain't got to wait for a special robe you got it you ain't got to wait for Authority you have it you don't have to wait for a squeeze sin's already been squeezed out of your life and you're one with Christ come on somebody help me preach amen you are one in Christ Jesus and when you get in Focus you will see yourself as a Son of God let me tell you every time you pray that's what you need to do bring it in focus bring it in Focus I am a son I have been Blood Washed I know who I am this is my position amen I have the token I can present the token with my prayer amen and when the Holy Ghost goes with my prayer demons have to leave it turns from Mortal to the words of the immortal speaking to human lives Hallelujah glory to God yes you're going to make a preacher out of me yet praise God get it in Focus quit waiting for a pie in the sky and the sweep by and by we can have it now now we're the sons of God no need to hide behind the corner and wait until one day well Satan I'll come out David was anointed when Goliath come out he didn't wait he didn't wait brother brother brand said he didn't pray up he was already prayed up he come out and said I've been commission I've been anointed to sit on the throne there's a giant between me and the throne and he's coming down well there's a Giants between us and the Rapture and guess what's happening to the Devil he's coming down we're going up Hallelujah this is what he's doing in this hour bringing adopted mature Sons a word bride a word bride a word church a people who are the word they are the Original Seed what was planted on the day of the Pentecost here now back again the Original Seed they were the word church there were the word church nowall and the message token brother Brandon said we have a token in this day we've been given a token which is an anot type of that type of a natur that natural type token we have been given the supernatural Supreme token that's been foreshadowed has been all that's been foreshadowed has been given to this generation has been given the token now we have the Holy Ghost is our token and it is our identification that we have accepted the death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus a human life to come back just a human life to come back on us but it was God himself stop for a minute remember the problem with the with the woolly lamb his innocency and his life could not come back upon them so he remained a sinner right so he come with his lamb and he had s lamb was without blemish lamb was accepted he went away with the the same old vices same old evil desires same old ways come on with the same way he come in except forgiven amen and and now you see the life of Abraham the life of a just man could not come back upon us because of that man had no his blood had no power to atone so Jesus couldn't do this just is a human but it was God manifested In the Flesh are you with me he said it was God manifested In the Flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons that now we are the sons and daughters of God hallelujah amen now so we're predestined guess what we're predestined do we're predestined not to fall your destiny has been set amen your destiny has been set you're predestinated not tool you see brother brandham said that knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing she would fall he said but he chose a bride that would not fall that would hold to the word regardless of what all the rest the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestined to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ predestinated to the church to that great glorious stand Hallelujah a bride who will not fall now you know brother brandom said of the Zeus of movement they could not wait he said you know like Eve she couldn't wait for the Brahma be fulfilled so she gave her womb to to the serpent right amen and he talks about you know some of the others who could not wait and he says and he said about the isua movement that they couldn't wait for the token so they sought a phony makeup with jumping and screaming and speaking in tongues getting people down the Altar and jiggling their tongue up and down till they got a confusion of language and that that's what brother Brandon said when the perfect word has come and that that is over with that jumping up and down and trying to speak with tongues is over with now speaking in tongues isn't over with but jumping up and down to try to speak with tongues is over with Hallelujah we don't jump get it we jump because we got it Hallelujah but they Pride you see to work up a phony makeup with screaming jumping and speaking in tongues instead of waiting for the real word of God to be made manifest through the bride you see but I wanted to say it's the hour and we don't have to have phony makeup you know we and and of course we don't want some kind of phony makeup with a lot of outward emotion with no results of change amen we we we don't want people continue with mean ill-tempered doubters but this is where it lives amen the Holy Ghost will make husbands love and be true to their wife and the wife love and be true to their husband amen this is a gospel that works because it lives I'm just going to say something here if it don't live if it don't work home it ain't real hallu you're living a lie there's been twoo many message young people raised up in homes where the gospel didn't work there it didn't live there amen but I'm here to tell you it will live and it will produce amen and under that token lives will be saved and delivered and I'll tell you what sometimes God Will Save Us in spite in spite of the life and the kind of nonsense that they were raised up under God will still bring him out cuz he going to get ever predestinated seed of God hallelujah he'll go beyond our mistakes and he'll go beyond the the mess we made our things and he'll turn it around for his glory to show he's God but I say let the message be lived let it produce good husbands and good wives good children Li lives that are live Holy Ghost Gospel Power don't take for your example them that fail look at those who stood stood the tested time like when I when I was had my last conversation with my wife before the bleed fully took her over where she couldn't hold a conversation and I said you know we've been married now 45 years and Karen I have no regrets what do you feel about it what's your take brother Tim you may not believe this you may not believe this conversation took place but she looked back at me and said Tim I've Had a Good Wonderful Life a great marriage and I have no regrets and I can look over and I can see the fruits of it not just in my own family but right here in the [Music] church amen you see again you know this is a gospel that works because it lives well you say but brother him I made mistakes well repent of it and pick up from there and go on you can't live there all your life this is ascending but I'll tell you what he said them kind that takes the word as a true God's true bride bringing forth children they can't die H man a the bride the the child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word amen you get it she can't die that child can't die because he's a word child he's a SE child he's an eternal child Hallelujah I believe that I believe I believe we're bringing forth children that can't die I'm talking about Sin can't take them away Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride oh my God made manifest in Christ God made manifest in the bride as God took from from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is the word and is bringing a bride that won't fall by denomination or Creed no sir she's coming back with the pure unadulterated word of God being manifested Hallelujah she is the second Eve she's not breaking her and spoiling her skirts of Purity and Holiness she'll stay with his word regardless of what anyone says again Christ the mystery the Bride of the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit did you know the church is the blood by the spirit do you know we we don't have a bottle of blood we don't have a bottle of blood where is the blood we're saved by the blood we're healed by the blood we must have the blood how do you get the blood well you see on the day there at Calvary the blood cell broke open releasing the life of God the spirit and the Spirit came back on the day of Pentecost and when you get the Holy Ghost you're born of the blood you are the blood of Christ by the spirit we not only have the blood we are the blood we're born of the blood of God how else could you be Sons and Daughters of God Amen come on God does not have elements of blood in his body except in Jesus Christ as a man but that's not how it is today the elements of God is the spirit and when you're born of the spirit you're born of his blood you have his DNA you have his likeness you can't help but grow up to be just like him amen you have his DNA now I got half of my DNA from the prits and half from the middle and both of them contribute Mother and Dad but when I was born of God he was both male and female and I have all of God in Me Hallelujah come on somebody let's understand where God has brought us in this age and who we are now we are the sons of God I'd speak in other tongues if it'd help you to understand I feel it rolling up right here right on tip of my tongue there's I want to say something this is no small portion of the spirit it's no mere anointing this is Christ again that is here in Bride farm this is the bride coming of Christ how many is with me now he came as a groom 2,000 years ago he was the fullness in one body now he comes in this day manifests himself in one body called The Bride who is the fullness of the godhead in a body if you don't know that go listen to Christ of mystery he tells you exactly he's come he's here this is part of the seventh seal the breaking of the silence God broke the silence I'm having a bride a wheat Church a mature grain adopted sons in this last day under the fourth light in the restoration now so again we remember is he said my mission I believe to the Earth is to forun the coming word see the coming word which is Christ is brother Tim we got the message we got 1100 tapes we got this and I believe it and I I well that is part of his coming he descends from heaven with a shout with a message if you read Revelation 10 what does he do he cries shouts with a loud voice so what happens when he does seven Thunders utter their voices the whole word is made manifest seals that was on the book gets taken off the Mysteries become revealed the book becomes open the truth is made known what far to make a word bride not to stay in books and tapes not to have your collection of pictures not to wear an eagle bu belt buckle or a pillar of fire picture on your wall that's not what is about what it's about come on somebody what it is about is now that word that message is taking on flesh and Christ is here where in Bride form all that was in Christ Our God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he pours he poured a little in Luther a little in West a little more in Pentecost now he comes right here and pours it all out the fullness H so she's a people who is sealed to the day of redemption days of in and out and up and down is over does that mean your emotions don't go up and down you're human aren't you so you're nature you have seasons so you go through you got to go through good times bad times your your emotions goes up and down but your soul remains steady I am a Christian no matter what my feelings say no matter what the circumstances I am a blood bought Son of God I know in whom I have believed and I don't care what's happening around me amen and and if I get to really dwelling on that I'll raise up and speak to the storm hallelujah amen I'm talking about a people who can speak to their mountains and their mountains have to hear their voice and when they speak the mountain moves Hallelujah that they can walk on Troubled Water and if they fall they'll get up again and walk on it again amen because they are a people who cannot be defeated amen I'm talking about a word bride a bride who is the word the same as he was the word amen God is the only form of eternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word then we were a part of him then there you are when that in there there's no devil no powers no nothing can ever move it that's the tpost of the soul you can be anointed out here in the spirit and desire and do all these other things but when it comes to the toost to that word you'll never move from there it'll hold right steady and true to that word as it can be outside of that regardless of what you do you're still lost you know we get things so out of focus I I'm sorry I I I have to correct some of the things that my Minister Brothers mess up God helped me to stay straight not mess up things myself but you know so I say this humbly not as one who is an authority over everybody but we I hear them say we don't need the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you could have that every day of your life and still die and go to hell now it's so sad what the devil tries to do with the message and convolutes it and makes it hard for you to follow and understand sure if the Holy Ghost is is just on to human spirit and doesn't Quicken your soul I I get you some kids that have b him enough where they make a confession that they believe the message and if that's all you have you're going to miss the Rapture some gets it upon the human spirit and its emotions and they will shout and dance and manifest a gift like tongues or whatever and if that's all you have of the spirit you'll miss the Rapture it must Quicken bre bring to life the seed within the soul and the Very life come in to manifest himself and yes you'll believe all of God's word and manifest it and yes it will stir your emotions and manifest gifts of the Spirit and when it comes like that and you can never somebody say never never be lost again seal to the day of redemption amen the true baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost is a token and you can't go to heaven without it not in the Rapture no sir and when you're sealed in there he said grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of redemption you're sealed in there you're beneath the blood you don't go out no more and well then what are you God's son and God's family sealed by the Holy Spirit the devil couldn't get to you if you had to for you are dead your old husband part is dead and you're buried and your life is hid and God to Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost how he's going to get to you how are you going to get out you're there Hallelujah that's what he taught in the breach he said seal is a security seal means you're secure you don't believe in eternal security I don't know but a seal signifies security to its destination wo to that guy that would try to break that seal and the Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken you all heard me say the people said the devil made me do this no no no the devil didn't do it you are just wasn't sealed in because when you're sealed in he's sealed out now you went out to him cuz you wasn't sealed in amen because if you were sealed in the only way he could come into you is come to the same process you'd have he'd had to be saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and then he'd be your brother and the devil can't be saved so he can't get in where your seal is he can't get past the seal amen so what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable rights amen she has a full token just like they had at Pentecost she has the full abstract the deed is cleared the seals have been open wiping off every deed of Satan every claim of Satan against us giving us the whole land and we have our full rights we have the continuation of the son of man Christ operating now in a bride body as brother Brandon said I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the B's the bride's body so that's where he's been revealed now while ausa Street Revival restored gifts and power to the church it was not the complete word so there was no way to restore the full token they didn't have it hello amen you see the level of the Holy Ghost possible to any churches depended directly upon the level of the word it had revealed to it brother Brandon would call it the dip of the spirit but this is no little dip hello this is no anointing no mere anointing I meant to say this is he himself coming this is the rising of sons full Sons mature Sons with power and authority over the flesh over sin and over the devil amen they cast him out he can't cast them out of the body come on he obeys them they don't obey him he flees from them we stand our ground on the word so these Sons cannot fall they let me repeat they cannot fall uh second Peter 1 and 10 wherefore there rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things have an added your faith virtue virtue knowledge coming through the levels of sanctification and then sealed with the Holy Ghost if you do these things you shall never fall that's the word of God now so being baptized by this token into the body of Christ First Corinthians 12 we are now subject to the gifts of the Spirit that are in there the world don't believe in gifts the church don't believe in gifts but God word said there is gifts and it it takes only that token that's the Holy Ghost to identify those gifts and in him is all the fullness in him is all the fullness of God and all the fullness of the promise and when we're baptized in him we have every promise that God made laid at our fingertip no sin is there no death is there even sickness can't stay in his presence if Satan then puts his hand to you and tries to tempt you into something you hold your token in your hands and show it that you are redeemed product of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and let your unadulterated Faith wave that token there and say I am a product that Jesus Christ bought sickness flees Hallelujah now where we at let's try to bring this down here I want to just I I just want to get get some of the thoughts here for a moment I want you to understand the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same if we're the fulfillment of the New Testament then the ministry of Christ and the ministry of the Bride is the same as he said it has to be because a woman and a husband come become one and so does the Bride In Christ become one remember the former treaties o Theophilus that I wrote to you that Jesus began to do and continues to do his death didn't stop him no sir he returned again not a third person but the safe per the the same person returned again in the form of the Holy Ghost to continue the work on and continues on says the book of Acts Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the token so you know where we're at in this hour this is the hour that the token has to be on display you see they had they had making preparations for it in the other AG just like the first part with Israel was go get a lamb examine that lamb see that it's without blemish right and you won't keep it up for so many days and until um you you you discovered there's no blemish in this land and you see that's been the the the the Baptist and the Lutheran message is the cross and you know the Lambs without blemish and he's a worthy Savior and he's a great God and he came fles and you know of course they think he's one of three people that did but anyway you know they a little mixed up here and there but nevertheless you know that you know that they kept up the lamb it was lamb time in Luther it was lamb time in Wesley it was even lamb time in in ausa Street it was the time of the keeping up of the lamb but there comes a time where that the Lamb's blood must be applied that it will no longer work just having the lamb and and talking about his inoc and see and how good he was and he was a man he walked the shores of Galilee and he did all of this it it comes beyond that come on somebody amen it's the time where the life that was in the lamb must come back upon the believer producing the literal life of Jesus Christ making adopted Sons place in the body as his sons recognized in position now of course this same thing happened there when even as far as even Acts 19 you see they had believed on the Lord they they had believed on the Lord they had uh they had confessed his name and he said well how was you baptized well unto John's baptism well that was a good baptism but there's something more now okay well how do we be baptized well it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you know well okay have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed see we we went right back to baptist message in the in the message ranks we believe when you believe brother Bri was a prophet you got the Holy Ghost you believe everything he said yeah I believe it I believe he as a prophet so I believe it all you're no more than a Baptist sorry that's as far as you come you just traded you just traded the name of Jesus for William bradam shame on you I said shame on you amen listen we want to bring it right down to the nitty-gritty right now you you just realize that's as far as many of them have come just to that very place but you see when here again what happened I'm quoting brother Brandon called Paul commanded them to be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ and when he did this the token Came Upon them and they were identified by the works and signs of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues through them and prophesying and magnifying God they were identified with their sacrifice it didn't come without Supernatural now I'm going to take the next 15 minutes and more if I need to what is meant by the word just what well before it became word logos spoken it was spirit so the word first is Spirit In the Beginning was the word was it a book did a Bible come out from God did a 1100 tapes come out a stack of message books a bunch of quotes is that what it was in the beginning was the word was it a teaching it was a teaching came out from God in the beginning a Doctrine a Creed that Creed means I Believe by the way it's not a bad name brother Creed it just means I believe and so when it becomes a Creed it becomes a form of this is what we believe and there's no life to it now so what was it was it a book a teaching a Doctrine no what came out of God a person it was the Holy Spirit that's right that's right now that's why you can't really have the word until you get the spirit you see we got it backward we think we get the word and then we get the spirit you got to have the spirit when the spirit of truth comes into you are you with me truth is a spirit and it ain't receiving the Creed it isn't received the doctrine it isn't receiving the teaching it's receiving the spirit and when you receive the spirit it makes you obey the word because long before the word was ever written it was Spirit that's right and long before it was taught by the teachers it was spirit and when it is properly taught it's not a lecture is not an intellectual talk but it's Spirit hallelujah amen Jesus said the words I speak are spirit and when a preacher really preaches the words they are spirit and when they go forth they knock out doubt unbelief confus conf usion Distortion everything else come on it knocks it all out why the spirit is going back through the word and as it does it's casting out Devils casting out unbelief causing the faith to come in causing the people to rise to accept the promise causing and amen so be it Hallelujah to rise up in the people and works to be begin to follow and when it's properly Tau is not an intellectual talk it's the spirit that's why we are ministers not of the letter or the law but we're able Ministers of the spirit and the spirit takes the letter and manifest it
