[26:36] word will bring forth after his Kind
[26:38] part three uh there's going to be some
[26:41] repetition here a few things we'll go
[26:43] back over but you know what the best way
[26:45] to learn is to go over and over and over
[26:46] and over
[26:47] so I'm not going to bore you with it all
[26:50] but it's gonna we're gonna we're just
[26:52] working on the teaching gift all right
[26:54] so tonight we're just going to look back
[26:56] over this and some things we're going to
[26:57] get into that we kind of touched on in
[26:59] the last couple services but we'll dive
[27:01] a little bit deeper in some of these
[27:02] different parts here but we just bring
[27:04] greetings from Brother Joseph we were
[27:06] just there in Murfreesboro Tennessee for
[27:07] their annual uh Memorial Day youth
[27:10] banquet and their services that weekend
[27:12] and we had a tremendous time
[27:15] the Lord dealt with a certain individual
[27:17] a certain little lady that he put on my
[27:18] heart before we got there and as we just
[27:21] kind of kept going from service to
[27:23] service to service to service you can
[27:25] just see God move God move God move and
[27:27] God move and I'll just give you a brief
[27:29] testimony as you're you're standing just
[27:31] briefly but she come in she's kind of a
[27:33] worldly girl
[27:35] raising a Christian home but she had
[27:37] these long fingernails on all painted up
[27:39] things of that nature and uh so that was
[27:42] Friday night and I spoke on missed
[27:44] opportunities and the Lord just dealt
[27:46] with her she came to the altar come
[27:48] again Saturday night she had the long
[27:50] fingernails on but there was no paint on
[27:51] them this time and the makeup on her
[27:53] face a little got a little bit lighter
[27:55] not much uh and I spoke on the second
[27:58] night I spoke on you have a purpose and
[28:00] God just really ministered to her
[28:02] because she had she had done some things
[28:04] and felt like she had gone too far and
[28:06] so anyway the next morning Sunday
[28:08] morning I spoke on uh it's not the end
[28:10] of the story
[28:11] well she come in Sunday morning she
[28:13] didn't have the fingernails on makeup
[28:15] was off her face Sunday night she got
[28:17] baptized re-baptized so if it was just
[28:19] for one it's worth it all so God gets
[28:22] the glory for that and uh we had a
[28:24] wonderful time there's a lot of young
[28:26] people there's other stories there
[28:27] there's another 18 year old boy that we
[28:29] just kind of they told me I kind of
[28:30] walked down his life and just came right
[28:32] behind and you know some issues in the
[28:34] home and Lord just kind of dealt with it
[28:36] so you know when we go we go as an
[28:38] extension of you all
[28:40] so we're going to be leaving as soon as
[28:42] we get done tonight we're going to be
[28:43] getting the RV and heading to Flagstaff
[28:45] Arizona so I'd covet your prayers we'll
[28:48] be speaking with brother Samuel Browning
[28:49] there brother Dale Smith his annual
[28:51] meetings there so if you would remember
[28:52] us in prayer we appreciate it continue
[28:54] to remember brother Tim and Timothy as
[28:56] they're traveling in tonight I believe
[28:57] or maybe tomorrow and brother Aaron and
[29:00] sister Lydia are on their way to
[29:01] Virginia
[29:03] so God's got a great work here
[29:06] so it's not it's not just us that are
[29:08] going you're going with us so keep us in
[29:10] prayer so we're going to look here in
[29:11] Genesis 1 and God said let us make man
[29:14] in our image after our likeness and let
[29:16] them have dominion over the fish of the
[29:18] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[29:20] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[29:21] and over every creeping thing that
[29:23] creepeth upon the Earth
[29:25] so God created man in his own image in
[29:27] the image of God created he him male and
[29:29] female created heed them and God blessed
[29:32] him remember last time we spoke about
[29:33] that word blessed air means god stepped
[29:35] back and he adored his creation he
[29:38] praised it what a wonderful creation
[29:40] that he has gotten and God said unto
[29:42] them be fruitful and multiply and
[29:44] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[29:46] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[29:48] and over the fowl of the air and over
[29:50] every living thing that moveth upon the
[29:52] Earth God bless you you can have your
[29:53] seats also turned to Ephesians 1 if you
[29:55] would tonight
[29:57] we're going to look here in Ephesians 1
[29:58] and we're going to also look in Romans 9
[30:00] as we start building our platform for
[30:03] our service tonight let me start my
[30:05] timer brother Dale Smith told me he said
[30:08] cut it short get on the road and come
[30:09] this way I said hey buddy I heard that
[30:11] brother Aaron stepped into some of our
[30:13] time so we just keep digging into
[30:15] everybody's time we're going there's no
[30:16] more time to get and I dare you I
[30:19] promise you I'm not going to cut into
[30:20] brother Tim's time tonight so we've got
[30:22] to worry about that
[30:24] what we find here in Ephesians 1 Paul
[30:27] says an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[30:29] will of God to the saints that which are
[30:31] in Ephesus into the faithful in Christ
[30:32] Jesus Grace be unto you in peace from
[30:35] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[30:37] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[30:39] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[30:41] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[30:44] places in Christ according now this is
[30:47] the word or this scripture here is what
[30:48] I want us to clue in on tonight because
[30:50] we're going to kind of come back to this
[30:52] off and on throughout this sermon
[30:54] tonight but according
[30:55] he as he has chosen Us in him before the
[30:59] foundation of the world
[31:00] so we can take verse 4 and we can go
[31:03] back to Genesis 1 26 and we can find let
[31:07] us make man in our image in our likeness
[31:10] and let them have dominion and then we
[31:12] come back here in Ephesians 4 Paul
[31:14] telling us according as he has chosen Us
[31:17] in him so we find also in John 1 you
[31:20] don't have to turn there but in the
[31:21] beginning was the word the word was with
[31:23] God and no Word was God and in verse 14
[31:26] that word that logos was made flesh so
[31:29] here in when we were chosen in him we
[31:32] were chosen in that thought because God
[31:34] knew what he was going to do in his
[31:36] whole entire creation so we find here
[31:38] that according as he has chosen Us in
[31:40] him before the foundation of the world
[31:42] that we should be holy
[31:45] Without Blame before him in love having
[31:47] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[31:49] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[31:51] according to the good pleasure of his
[31:53] will Romans 9 and verse 11.
[31:56] for the children being not yet born
[31:59] neither having done good or evil
[32:01] that the purpose of God according to
[32:04] election might stand not of works but at
[32:08] him that call us so here we find there's
[32:10] a key phrase here that the purpose of
[32:13] God according to election so the purpose
[32:16] of God we find that purpose again in
[32:18] Genesis 1 26. God's purpose was to have
[32:22] a creation God's purpose was to make Man
[32:24] In His Image God's purpose was to bring
[32:26] forth Offspring was to bring forth
[32:28] spoken word children so we find that
[32:31] there let's keep going now when he says
[32:33] and and it was said unto her that the
[32:35] Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is
[32:37] written Jacob have I loved and he's all
[32:39] have I hated now
[32:41] we're going to look here in the uh you
[32:43] have to excuse me I'm come home sick
[32:46] from the meetings this past weekend
[32:48] but there's nobody else to preach
[32:51] and so it follows my lot so you know
[32:53] just pray for my voice
[32:55] but I'm just going to take it slow
[32:56] tonight uh the Lord knows what he's
[32:58] doing but we find here in the exposition
[33:00] of seven Church Angels brother bam says
[33:02] now we know most assuredly that the
[33:04] purpose of God stands in election and
[33:08] I'm going to dive into that word
[33:09] election here in just a little bit so we
[33:10] can kind of get an understanding if I
[33:12] don't make it all the way through
[33:13] tonight with this well we'll have other
[33:15] opportunities but it was it was but the
[33:17] man says it was purposed in himself it
[33:20] was God's purpose to bring forth a
[33:23] people like unto himself that would be a
[33:26] word bride
[33:29] so I want you to make this we're going
[33:31] to take it slow tonight but I want you
[33:32] to key in on this this is from the
[33:34] church age book and this is where
[33:35] everything is summarized throughout the
[33:37] entire message and we come here and we
[33:39] find it was it was purposed in him
[33:41] Genesis 1 26 you go back there and you
[33:44] find this is the reason what was God's
[33:46] intention and we're going to look at
[33:47] that here again but we find it was
[33:50] purposed in him it was God's purpose to
[33:52] bring forth to people like unto himself
[33:55] that would be a word bride she was
[33:58] chosen before the foundation of the
[34:00] world in him
[34:03] not chosen in a denomination not chosen
[34:06] in a church building not chosen in your
[34:08] favorite preacher not chosen in mom and
[34:11] dad and whatever else but chosen in him
[34:13] so we find in him is Jesus and so we go
[34:17] back to the beginning and we find where
[34:19] it all originated brother bam says now
[34:21] she was foreknown and beloved
[34:24] there's a lot of times you don't feel
[34:26] beloved is it you feel worthless the
[34:29] devil's been in your ear kicking you and
[34:31] you know and telling you this down the
[34:32] other but he says you she was foreknown
[34:35] and beloved before she was ever brought
[34:37] forth during the ages upon the Earth she
[34:41] was Redeemed by his blood and can never
[34:44] understand this church she can never
[34:47] come into condemnation
[34:50] why can she never come into condemnation
[34:52] because she was chosen in him so no
[34:55] matter what you're going through in life
[34:57] no matter what you face especially you
[34:59] young people as you mature and you go
[35:01] through different seasons and different
[35:03] times of your life and the Devil comes
[35:05] with this complex and this idea and this
[35:08] depression and this anxiety and this
[35:10] fear and this complex and all these
[35:12] different things I want you to know
[35:13] tonight that you are chosen in him and
[35:16] therefore there is now no condemnation
[35:20] now that doesn't give you a free pass to
[35:23] go live any ungodly life that you want
[35:25] but it means if you are chosen in him
[35:27] then you would make the choice to serve
[35:29] him to surrender your heart to him and
[35:32] to allow him to be the king of the of
[35:34] your heart and so therefore you are not
[35:37] going to come into condemnation never
[35:38] come into condemnations she can never be
[35:42] in the Judgment because sin cannot be
[35:44] imputed unto her Romans 4 verse 8.
[35:47] blessed is the man whom the Lord will
[35:49] not impute sin but indeed she shall be
[35:52] with him in his throne of judgment
[35:55] judging the world and even angels notice
[35:57] what he says here her name each of her
[36:00] members was written in a section of the
[36:03] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[36:05] foundation of the world
[36:07] so your name was put there before the
[36:09] foundation of the world
[36:12] so God already decreed that you're going
[36:15] to be
[36:16] okay because you were chosen in him
[36:18] there ain't enough devils in hell can
[36:19] erase that name
[36:21] let me just tell you this tonight if
[36:23] you're a child of God no matter what
[36:24] mistakes you make it will not remove
[36:27] your name from that book
[36:29] no matter how many times you fall no
[36:32] matter how many times you make mistakes
[36:33] you're going to get back up and you're
[36:35] going to keep on because your name has
[36:37] already been put there and though you
[36:39] may not feel like you fit the mode
[36:40] though you may you make mistakes and it
[36:42] seems you have had good days and bad
[36:44] days you're going to eventually come to
[36:46] life and you're going to match the word
[36:48] that God's already decreed for you to
[36:50] come to
[36:51] so we find here now listen to what
[36:53] brother Brown says in things that are to
[36:55] be he says Jesus was the fullness of the
[36:57] godhead manifest and how many can agree
[36:59] with that
[37:00] he was the fullness of the godhead
[37:01] bodily therefore when he came to the
[37:04] Earth and was manifested in the flesh
[37:06] you were in him
[37:12] okay you were in him because he was the
[37:15] word and in the beginning was the word
[37:17] the word was with God the Word was God
[37:19] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[37:21] Among Us the word was made flesh
[37:24] therefore you walk with him
[37:27] so let's change our thinking for a
[37:29] little bit tonight you know we come in
[37:31] here and we think man we've had a bad
[37:32] day we didn't walk through the Molly
[37:34] Groves we've done this we've done that
[37:35] but here we find the prophet of God said
[37:37] you walk with him you were in him you
[37:40] was on the earth you suffer with him you
[37:42] died with him you bury with him and you
[37:45] are risen with him
[37:48] and notice and you're sitting right now
[37:51] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he
[37:54] goes oh that means so much nowadays that
[37:56] means so much to us to see ourselves
[37:58] positionally placed in Jesus Christ so
[38:02] no matter what you're going through in
[38:03] the darkness the Dark Cloud that comes
[38:05] over you in your night seasons and
[38:07] Satan's coming down upon you come back
[38:09] to this quote come back to this reality
[38:11] that you were chosen in him you
[38:14] therefore you walked with him when he
[38:16] walked ashores of Galilee when he
[38:18] suffered you suffered when he went to
[38:20] hell you went to hell but when he rose
[38:22] again you Rose again what does that tell
[38:24] you that Satan can't keep you down
[38:26] because you're predestinated to rise
[38:29] because he's already risen on your
[38:31] behalf
[38:33] he says now we can't live by Creeds we
[38:36] cannot live by denominationalism
[38:39] now how many of you come from a
[38:40] denomination
[38:41] Baptist Presbyterian
[38:44] Methodist MEC or whatever y'all little
[38:48] initials y'all put behind your own
[38:49] churches
[38:51] what is it
[38:54] there it is see
[38:56] she got up we've got all these we got
[38:58] all these denominations everywhere we
[39:00] come from I come from man I Church
[39:02] hopped all over the place until I
[39:03] finally landed where I needed to be
[39:06] so we find here but we cannot live
[39:08] brother L on denominationalism
[39:11] we must live by the word because a bride
[39:14] is part of the bridegroom
[39:15] all right like any wife is part of her
[39:18] husband
[39:19] now this ain't a wife just kicking and
[39:21] screaming and going contrary to her
[39:23] husband but any wife is part of her
[39:25] husband notice Eve come from Adam
[39:29] and so this bride comes from chosen in
[39:33] him she comes from him therefore she
[39:37] possesses the same traits qualities
[39:39] attributes that he possesses
[39:42] so we find here the bride because the
[39:44] bride is part of the bridegroom like any
[39:46] wife is part of her husband therefore we
[39:48] must be that word bride what is the word
[39:51] bride the manifestation of this hour
[39:55] don't be too excited about the
[39:56] manifestation of the hour
[39:58] Mercy man
[40:00] so what is this word brought the
[40:02] manifestation of the hour so why don't
[40:04] we act like we act because it's the
[40:06] manifestation of the hour why are we so
[40:08] excited brother Mike because it's the
[40:09] manifestation of the hour why do we got
[40:11] joy in my soul because it's the
[40:13] manifestation of the hour
[40:15] we can sing that song you don't know
[40:17] like I know what he's done for me
[40:19] because why because it's the
[40:20] manifestation of the hour
[40:24] look some people they people can't get
[40:26] excited because they don't know who they
[40:27] are but we know who we are we've been
[40:29] quickened by the word and therefore we
[40:32] find ourselves in the mirror of the word
[40:34] and recognize we are the manifestation
[40:37] of the hour where it's not just on a
[40:39] prophet it's not just on Jesus Christ
[40:41] but it's Jesus had a he had a purpose in
[40:44] his mind before the foundation and that
[40:46] was to have a wife that was to have a
[40:49] family that was a produced Offspring and
[40:51] I'm looking at the manifestation of the
[40:53] hour
[40:54] that should excite you so no matter what
[40:56] you're going through how bad life gets
[40:58] you're the manifestation of the hour you
[41:00] are the revealed word made known in this
[41:03] hour
[41:05] he said the bride not a Creed our
[41:07] denomination but a living Oracle of God
[41:10] a living attribute of God displaying to
[41:13] the world the attributes of God
[41:16] see not displaying your own attributes
[41:18] but displaying the attributes of God in
[41:21] the formation of the Bride that's to be
[41:23] expressed in the hour that we're now
[41:25] living
[41:26] so in John 6 37 we find that all that
[41:28] their father
[41:30] giveth me shall come to me
[41:33] and him that cometh to me I shall in no
[41:35] wise cast out
[41:38] praise the Lord
[41:40] come on somebody
[41:42] all that the father has given to me I
[41:46] will no wise cast out somebody should
[41:48] just I mean say a little amen
[41:52] come on and no man can come accept
[41:55] notice now no man can come accept the
[41:58] father draweth
[42:00] oh let's put these two together and
[42:02] recognize that all that the father hath
[42:05] given me shall come and no man can come
[42:08] but what the father draws him so what is
[42:10] he doing he ain't drawing unseed he's
[42:13] drawing those that came from him and
[42:15] he's drawn them back to him I say oh
[42:18] praise God Lord that just gives me hope
[42:20] tonight to know that I am that seed and
[42:23] you will not cast me out no matter how
[42:26] low I get no matter what I go through on
[42:29] this side of Eternity God I am seen him
[42:31] because I am see I'm going to produce
[42:33] the word for this hour I will be the
[42:36] manifestation of the hour
[42:40] come on bride
[42:42] put a smile on your face little bride
[42:45] you got something to be excited about
[42:48] this is not everybody's message but it's
[42:51] your message
[42:54] I mean John 1 and verse 12 but as many
[42:57] as receipts so here's the key many as
[43:00] received him
[43:01] so you got to receive the Revelation
[43:03] you've got to receive the word you got
[43:04] to receive him
[43:06] received him gave he the power to become
[43:10] the sons of God
[43:13] oh man
[43:14] greatest Revelation you'll ever get in
[43:16] your life is to realize you're a son and
[43:18] just like brother Tim said the other day
[43:20] when he speaks of sons he's speaking of
[43:21] you ladies as well as Global as a form
[43:24] of humanity so and we find here that he
[43:28] has given us the power the ability the
[43:31] desire to become sons of God to become
[43:35] offspring of God nothing that you had to
[43:38] do to deserve it to earn it to work it
[43:41] to Merit it it was in God because you
[43:44] were chosen in him
[43:47] so he gave us the power to become sons
[43:49] of God even to them that believed on his
[43:51] name which were born now notice not a
[43:54] blood
[43:55] so can't be mama can't be Daddy can't be
[43:57] preacher Deacon whoever else you want to
[43:59] put there nor of the will of Flesh not
[44:01] of your own power your own might
[44:04] nor the will of man
[44:06] but of God
[44:09] this is beautiful Church
[44:12] Ephesians 1 and verse 5. notice again
[44:15] according as he has chosen
[44:19] chosen in him before the foundation of
[44:21] the world and brother Brown says now
[44:23] Jesus Christ is choosing his bride
[44:26] I kind of picked up on this this weekend
[44:28] I was Crossing Lines trying to speak to
[44:30] the young people and I got into talking
[44:32] about a girl a man choosing his wife and
[44:34] you know and
[44:36] says here no he noticed it he says Jesus
[44:39] Christ is choosing his own bride just as
[44:42] same as men choose their Brides today
[44:45] aren't you thankful we don't have
[44:46] arranged marriages
[44:49] praise the Lord come on somebody you
[44:52] husbands and now I need to shout
[44:54] come over there thank you
[44:56] there ain't many options in Mississippi
[44:58] we could have got really messed up buddy
[45:04] for you think about it he's choosing his
[45:06] bride the same way that that we choose
[45:09] our bride today notice he says now the
[45:11] bride today doesn't simply decide she's
[45:14] going to take a certain man for a
[45:15] husband
[45:17] so sister
[45:20] be nice yeah I better be almost gonna
[45:23] walk on
[45:24] yeah man this is so good I have to do it
[45:31] I'm not gonna do it
[45:34] I want to so bad
[45:39] there's wisdom here right let's move on
[45:42] see the bride today doesn't simply
[45:44] decide she's going to take a certain man
[45:47] see it's the groom who decides and
[45:49] chooses a certain woman for his bride
[45:52] see notice he's looking for something
[45:54] that's inside of him
[45:57] and I told the story and I'll tell it
[45:59] over and over until the day I die but
[46:00] when I first came to church here and I
[46:03] saw this we got we have some pretty
[46:05] young sisters at the time I'm not saying
[46:08] they're ugly now but I mean they're
[46:10] they're pretty I mean they were pretty
[46:12] then but I was young then
[46:16] take a drink of water
[46:19] take another drink
[46:22] but as I came in and you know my focus
[46:25] was the word and I just wanted to hear
[46:27] this is where I felt like the Lord was
[46:28] leaving me but you gather around the
[46:31] young people and I would watch my wife
[46:32] now which was Sister Jessica Scholl at
[46:35] the time and I was watched how she
[46:37] catered to people and they entertained
[46:39] her mom and dad and her sister would
[46:41] entertain young people and other people
[46:43] at her house and she served here and
[46:44] just was always busy just you know just
[46:47] playing character
[46:48] and here's the thing is I didn't know
[46:50] that character laid in me
[46:51] but I knew what I saw I liked
[46:54] and I I knew that that's what I was
[46:57] attracted to
[46:58] it was a bonus that she has a very
[47:00] pretty face
[47:02] I'm very thankful for that but it was
[47:05] her character
[47:06] it was her character because she has a
[47:08] christ-like character and so Jesus is
[47:10] not looking just for a pretty face
[47:13] but he's looking for a christ-like
[47:15] character
[47:16] because remember now she's from him
[47:20] now what if Adam would have rejected Eve
[47:24] but she he couldn't reject it because
[47:26] Eve came from him and nor can our Adam
[47:29] Christ reject us because we come from
[47:32] him so he looked here and brother tells
[47:35] us now in John 15 16 because you can go
[47:37] back to the I believe it's the Samaritan
[47:39] Church agent this is where I'm pulling
[47:40] from he says you have not chosen me but
[47:43] I have chosen you
[47:45] so as much as sister Jessica chased me I
[47:48] chose her
[47:51] she'll get me for that later but that's
[47:52] okay I got another 45 minutes behind the
[47:55] pulpit we'll be all right
[47:57] but see you have not chosen me and young
[48:00] ladies it's not you that chooses the
[48:02] mate the male
[48:03] he chooses you
[48:06] you simply say I do
[48:09] and that's what we simply say to him yes
[48:11] Lord I do I accept you
[48:14] I accept your leadership I accept your
[48:17] headship I accept you as my Lord to to
[48:21] rule over and to take care of me and to
[48:24] watch over me and protect me and guide
[48:26] me in my journey on this side I do
[48:29] I believe that's where we got to find
[48:30] you find so many marriages today and I
[48:33] don't know how I'm here but there's none
[48:34] of my notes but you got marriages today
[48:36] that are all scrupled up
[48:38] because we've got a we got a blending of
[48:40] rolls and we got a blending of
[48:42] boundaries here and God is saying he's
[48:44] already defined it right here and we
[48:47] understand that you are from the mail
[48:49] and it's it's not you choosing the mail
[48:52] but it's the male choosing you and
[48:54] you're simply saying I'm willing to come
[48:56] under the leadership
[48:58] I'm willing to come on her subjection to
[49:00] this and allow this individual this man
[49:03] to assume responsibility for my care
[49:06] and that's what he wants us to do is to
[49:09] come underneath his headship in his
[49:11] leadership and allow him to have
[49:14] responsibility over our lives
[49:18] all right so we find here now you have
[49:20] not chosen me but I've chosen you now
[49:22] according to the word of God the bride
[49:23] was chosen before the foundation of the
[49:25] world this choosing of the bride was
[49:28] purposed in himself
[49:31] so we go to Romans 9 and verse 11 notice
[49:34] that the purpose of God according to
[49:36] election now I love this part if you if
[49:39] you search the messages anywhere get
[49:41] this piece of it out frame it put it on
[49:43] your computer put it on your
[49:44] refrigerator but he said you can't read
[49:47] it any other way the heart purpose the
[49:50] Eternal purpose of God was to take a
[49:52] bride of his own choosing
[49:55] the heart purpose
[49:58] the Eternal purpose of God was to take a
[50:03] bride
[50:04] somebody that's near to him that's a
[50:08] match to him
[50:10] and that purpose was in was in himself
[50:14] and being internal was to Creed before
[50:17] the foundation of the world now before
[50:19] there was ever a speck of Stardust
[50:20] before God was God God's an object of
[50:22] adoration and no one was there to
[50:24] worship him he was there and he was only
[50:26] potentially God and he was only known as
[50:28] the eternal spirit but right there and
[50:31] then the bride you was already in his
[50:33] mind
[50:35] praise God
[50:37] come on work with me tonight
[50:40] you were right there in his mind in his
[50:44] thoughts
[50:45] oh what a glorious thing to realize no
[50:48] matter what you're facing no matter the
[50:50] discouragements the lows of your life to
[50:53] realize right there you was in his mind
[50:56] and he said she was she was existing in
[50:59] the thoughts and what about the thoughts
[51:01] of God they are Eternal so no matter
[51:04] what you're going through it's only
[51:06] temporary
[51:08] you are Eternal you're going to outlast
[51:11] that trial you're going to outlast that
[51:13] situation you're going to outlast that
[51:15] environment you're going to outlast that
[51:17] that circumstance you're going to
[51:18] outlast that sickness because why
[51:20] because you are Eternal and it's only
[51:22] temporary
[51:25] foreign
[51:29] notice a true Christian how many is true
[51:31] Christian here tonight
[51:33] I should have everybody's hands some of
[51:34] y'all are
[51:35] paraplegics
[51:38] don't have hands
[51:40] all right Mike thank you I got it
[51:43] a true Christian will not look at such
[51:46] beauty queens
[51:52] and course girls
[51:54] and sex Queens
[51:56] he'll look for Christian character
[52:00] so look what he's looking for
[52:03] young boys this is what you're to look
[52:05] for in a mate in a future
[52:08] to create your home that environment is
[52:11] to not look for a pretty face
[52:13] not to look for chorus girls or sex
[52:15] Queens
[52:16] he'll look for a Christian character so
[52:19] those images that you're looking at on
[52:21] the computer that's not Christian
[52:23] character
[52:25] that ain't gonna be a mama
[52:27] that ain't gonna be a wife that's not
[52:29] going to be a homemaker that's going to
[52:31] be a home breaker gonna wreck your heart
[52:34] break your heart and break your home
[52:36] break your home and leave you with kids
[52:37] or you know have kids and all of a
[52:39] sudden you're nowhere to be found and
[52:40] the kids are nowhere and she's run off
[52:42] and your whole life's a mess
[52:45] and the kids are the ones that struggle
[52:47] so we find out he says you can't have
[52:49] all those he goes you can't have all
[52:51] things you might be or there might be
[52:54] one girl that's real pretty thank you
[52:56] Jessica
[52:57] and there's another girl maybe she's
[52:59] well you know her stature looks better
[53:02] than this one and brother Brandon does a
[53:05] real polite job of doing this he didn't
[53:07] say she was ugly and once pretty and
[53:09] one's ugly he had a real diplomatic
[53:11] political way of saying this he says now
[53:13] maybe she's a uh her stature looks
[53:16] better than this one and you might have
[53:19] to sacrifice one for the other
[53:21] but if she's not the statue of a lady or
[53:24] of a woman I don't care whether she's
[53:26] pretty or not you better look at her
[53:28] character whether she's pretty or not
[53:31] so if he's telling us that this is how
[53:33] we should Define our future mate because
[53:35] this is what God is looking for
[53:38] he's looking for the very same thing
[53:40] notice he speaks this through a prophet
[53:43] so that we can understand what God is
[53:46] looking for he's looking for character
[53:47] not how big you are how tall you are how
[53:50] much you've read your Bible how much you
[53:51] listen to quotes or the message and all
[53:54] that all your oh I did this and I did
[53:56] this and I did this it ain't about that
[53:59] he's looking for your character
[54:04] he says now it is becoming if a
[54:07] Christian would choose a wife that
[54:10] he
[54:10] ought to choose a genuine Born Again
[54:12] woman
[54:15] so notice we have a lot of young couples
[54:18] today
[54:19] you know they infatuated with each other
[54:21] and heart goes Peter Pat Petey Pat Pitty
[54:24] Pat
[54:25] how many of y'all remember that bro
[54:26] Jackson better raise your hand
[54:28] you're the only one brother David I mean
[54:31] brother brother Derek you should have
[54:33] raised your hand
[54:34] he but that's right
[54:37] there we go right there
[54:38] a perfect young couple
[54:41] oh
[54:43] we know I I remember how it was man
[54:45] butterflies in my stomach brother Mike
[54:46] you laugh
[54:49] man like just that glimmer of that eye
[54:52] on that little smile just set your heart
[54:54] a flame
[54:55] but we find here I say that to say this
[54:58] that we have to we have to to think
[55:02] Beyond just those things and realize
[55:04] that you're looking for somebody who's
[55:06] born again
[55:07] look at how pretty they are how
[55:10] intelligent they are how nice they are
[55:12] and yet we got couples who are dating
[55:15] and courting and their lives are a mess
[55:17] they don't they're not walking with the
[55:19] Lord they just have a facade of
[55:21] Christianity and they're just going
[55:22] through it and then you find out they
[55:23] they get married or they date and then
[55:26] because they're not where they need to
[55:27] be they make mistakes in their courtship
[55:29] and they're dating and all of a sudden
[55:31] there's a lot of things there and then
[55:33] you know hey you leave somebody
[55:36] tainted
[55:38] or you get married and you have a hard
[55:40] start because you didn't make the the
[55:43] Lord the preeminence of your life much
[55:46] less your marriage life
[55:48] and so young boys notice and young girls
[55:51] make sure you find somebody that has a
[55:55] genuine born-again experience
[55:57] look tall dark and handsome
[55:59] dude you ain't got the Holy Ghost bye
[56:04] I mean for real but daddy he's so
[56:07] handsome I don't care
[56:09] handsome handsome nothing
[56:13] we gotta protect our women we gotta
[56:16] protect our daughters brotherhail
[56:18] hey
[56:20] thankfully there ain't no been no
[56:21] suitors coming to my door yet because
[56:23] they know I'm rough and tough for the
[56:24] hell
[56:25] I'll get them to what for how to and
[56:27] when to do it
[56:28] we got to protect them and so I tell my
[56:31] girls I tell my son
[56:33] and we should tell all of our kids and
[56:34] we do make sure you find someone if
[56:37] you're going to continue a relationship
[56:39] and your heart becomes to get I don't
[56:40] know why I'm here
[56:42] but we are here tonight and this has got
[56:45] nothing to do with the word bringing
[56:46] forth but it's going to bring forth
[56:47] anyway so we find that if your life and
[56:50] if you're into a relationship
[56:53] and your heart with God is not where it
[56:55] needs to be it will never be where it
[56:57] needs to be with that spouse or that
[56:58] mate
[56:59] it'll never be there
[57:02] and so you got to make sure that that's
[57:04] right first
[57:05] okay because otherwise you're gonna have
[57:08] broken hearts broken lives broken
[57:10] marriages broken homes a lot of broken
[57:12] things not to say that God can't put the
[57:14] pieces back together but why allow the
[57:17] shattered glass
[57:18] why do why would we allow that when we
[57:20] can just focus on him in our youth While
[57:23] We're Young focus on it make him the
[57:25] preeminence of our life say Buster you
[57:27] may be tall dark and handsome but you
[57:29] ain't your life just ain't matching up
[57:30] no let's put this on pause and wait
[57:35] the best decision you'll ever make is
[57:37] put that thing on pause and wait and say
[57:39] I want to see some maturity I want to
[57:41] see because why because you're looking
[57:42] for character young ladies you're
[57:44] looking for characters somebody that can
[57:46] lead you
[57:47] somebody that can financially provide
[57:49] for you oh he may be all good looking oh
[57:51] bum's gonna be on the street because he
[57:53] can't hold down a job or work shy or
[57:55] something
[57:58] I want to get married I want to get
[57:59] married
[58:00] you got a job nope
[58:03] but you want to get I want to get
[58:05] married you studying nope
[58:07] you ain't studying nope you got any
[58:09] Investments no
[58:12] you got any properties no
[58:17] but you want to get married you ain't
[58:19] got nothing going for you
[58:22] the preacher said he was asked that
[58:24] question and this young man was asking
[58:26] all those questions he said I need you
[58:27] to pray that I want to get married
[58:29] he said Lord deliver our young sisters
[58:32] from this work shy no good for nothing
[58:35] bum
[58:38] I say Lord deliver ours
[58:42] I mean hey you ain't got to go off to
[58:44] college but make something of yourself
[58:47] get something that you can make a good
[58:49] living a decent living and provide for
[58:51] your home
[58:53] my this is off the word tonight I mean
[58:56] not off the word but off my notes
[58:57] tonight
[58:59] it's not off the word I promise you it
[59:01] ain't off the word this is good family
[59:03] 101 business
[59:07] but I mean just think about it
[59:09] not everybody has to have a college
[59:11] degree a master's degree a PhD lld you
[59:14] know we've taken that education slant
[59:16] that brother Bram talked about education
[59:18] education education he was referring to
[59:20] education as far as from a theological
[59:23] standpoint
[59:24] he understood that you got that you know
[59:26] it's okay to go get an accounting degree
[59:27] and make something and make a living or
[59:29] get this kind of degree or a Nursing
[59:31] degree or whatever kind of degree that
[59:32] you have to make a living you know but
[59:35] it's that theological degree that pulls
[59:37] people further away from God and or you
[59:40] know whatever these other degrees
[59:41] psychology and different things and they
[59:43] pull people away from God and they don't
[59:45] pull them to God but you know this
[59:47] school is not bad if you have the right
[59:50] mindset and motive with it
[59:52] because you're going to have to make it
[59:54] in life and so that's free to whoever
[59:57] wants to receive that but we find choose
[1:00:00] a genuine born-again woman regardless of
[1:00:02] what she looks like and young ladies you
[1:00:04] choose a born-again young man regardless
[1:00:07] of what he looks like
[1:00:09] I'll look for her okay how does he treat
[1:00:12] mama
[1:00:14] how's how does he treat Daddy
[1:00:16] or she he or she them
[1:00:19] we ain't using pronouns are we he and
[1:00:22] she when using them and they
[1:00:25] so how do they treat their their parents
[1:00:28] because that's how they're going to
[1:00:30] treat you
[1:00:32] all right how do they treat their
[1:00:33] friends
[1:00:35] because how they're going to treat you
[1:00:36] and your friends
[1:00:38] so you need to be looking at these
[1:00:39] things Okay can they
[1:00:41] can they get up
[1:00:43] in the morning at a decent hour
[1:00:45] are they laying there till 10 11 12
[1:00:47] o'clock
[1:00:48] because they just stayed up all night
[1:00:50] gaming
[1:00:51] or reading
[1:00:53] or Facebooking or Instagram and our
[1:00:55] Snapchatting or tick talking or
[1:00:59] whatever
[1:01:00] so can they
[1:01:03] can they make something of themselves so
[1:01:05] you got to be looking at these things
[1:01:08] and so I'm looking at them like okay
[1:01:10] well this young man he's 18 19 years old
[1:01:14] he stays home all day long
[1:01:17] nah that's a flag
[1:01:20] you staying home you're 18 19 you're not
[1:01:22] in school anymore you eat Mama's food
[1:01:24] and Daddy's food and he's putting
[1:01:25] clothes on your back and casting your
[1:01:27] car and and you ain't got no job
[1:01:30] and you ain't going to school
[1:01:33] you sure ain't got no properties and no
[1:01:35] Investments
[1:01:37] so choose somebody that can make a life
[1:01:44] you know to somebody that can make a
[1:01:46] life
[1:01:46] make you a home boys and girls make you
[1:01:49] a home choose character
[1:01:51] because that's what God is choosing
[1:01:54] he's choosing character and that
[1:01:56] character is going to come forth through
[1:01:57] only through his bride
[1:02:00] okay it's not going to come through a
[1:02:02] denomination it's not going to come
[1:02:03] through the Badness or the Methodist or
[1:02:05] any of these other churches it's only
[1:02:06] going to come through his bride because
[1:02:07] his bride was chosen in him
[1:02:11] so therefore we are the only ones or the
[1:02:13] bride is the only ones are the only ones
[1:02:15] that can produce the character of Christ
[1:02:17] which is what he's looking for so we
[1:02:19] find now brother Brown says now God in
[1:02:22] Genesis 1 he said let there be light and
[1:02:24] there was light and he said it could
[1:02:25] have been 800 or thousands of years
[1:02:27] later before light ever came
[1:02:30] but Light Came
[1:02:32] so when he says let us make man in our
[1:02:34] image we're still in the seventh Church
[1:02:36] age and still seeds are coming to life
[1:02:40] because it's a decreed season a decreed
[1:02:43] time and that clock just keeps on
[1:02:45] ticking doesn't it
[1:02:46] so every seed will come forth in its
[1:02:49] time at the right time so don't rush it
[1:02:55] you know some of your brow beating your
[1:02:57] kids just commit them to God
[1:03:00] you say we're brother Joe that's easy
[1:03:01] your kids are in church well yeah but
[1:03:05] that's a lot of work went into that
[1:03:08] we're not promised we're just like
[1:03:10] anybody else
[1:03:11] you got to commit them to God it's a lot
[1:03:13] of prayer that goes on in the Adam's
[1:03:15] household
[1:03:16] and you know and there's a lot of give
[1:03:19] and take and compromise and no one wins
[1:03:21] of what battles to fight but keep that
[1:03:23] keep that that uh
[1:03:26] that home pure and and that that pure
[1:03:29] you don't compromise on the word with
[1:03:31] bringing things into your home you make
[1:03:33] sure you're at home is pure but we find
[1:03:35] now that every seed is going to come
[1:03:38] forth in its time if that is son or that
[1:03:40] daughter is a seed Gene of God they will
[1:03:44] come forth
[1:03:46] all right
[1:03:47] and there's no reason you should think
[1:03:49] that there won't
[1:03:50] all right so let me put that in there
[1:03:52] you like well brother Joe what do you
[1:03:53] mean if no I'm telling you you believe
[1:03:55] for your kid
[1:03:56] you believe for that child you believe
[1:03:58] for them brother Tony think about your
[1:04:00] daughter Lauren
[1:04:02] all these years and now I'm hearing
[1:04:04] stories about her you know you know gave
[1:04:06] her heart to the Lord and it's on fire
[1:04:07] for the things of God and yet that seed
[1:04:10] wasn't planted in a message Church all
[1:04:12] its life
[1:04:13] it was around it got an environment but
[1:04:17] at the right time at the right season
[1:04:19] the word came across the word in the
[1:04:22] word that was in her the seed that was
[1:04:23] in her heard the word and it came to
[1:04:26] itself
[1:04:27] and so that should encourage all of us
[1:04:29] and we look back and we think about the
[1:04:31] seeds that were planted look at Moses
[1:04:32] and Jeremiah and John the Baptist they
[1:04:34] all came in their decreed season
[1:04:37] and so are we
[1:04:39] coming in our decree season you couldn't
[1:04:42] come in the six age
[1:04:44] you came in this age
[1:04:46] because God needed somebody that was
[1:04:48] going to rise above all that laodicea I
[1:04:51] had to offer and Rise through all this
[1:04:53] muck and Murray and and mercury and or
[1:04:57] not Mercury Murray whatever and just the
[1:05:00] uh transgender and homosexual movement
[1:05:02] LBGTQ and just all this generation that
[1:05:05] we're in today he's got young people
[1:05:07] that love the word they stay with the
[1:05:09] word
[1:05:10] because there's a seed on the inside
[1:05:13] that will not let you go out of it
[1:05:16] and partake of that
[1:05:18] so notice he says now he has chosen Us
[1:05:20] in him before the foundation of the
[1:05:22] world that means that we were right
[1:05:24] there with him in the mind and the
[1:05:26] thoughts of God before the foundation of
[1:05:29] the world that gives an eternal quality
[1:05:31] to the elect you can't get away from it
[1:05:34] so in the Christ the mystery of God
[1:05:36] revealed he said back in the back part
[1:05:38] of God's mind
[1:05:41] there was something that he was trying
[1:05:43] and he was going to achieve
[1:05:45] Genesis 1 26.
[1:05:47] he was going to have a family
[1:05:49] he was going to bring forth seed
[1:05:52] and he had a motive in doing it in order
[1:05:55] to let himself be expressed now notice
[1:05:57] what he says here first there wasn't a
[1:05:59] Moon Star at a molecule anything he was
[1:06:01] God but he wasn't exactly wasn't God at
[1:06:04] that time because God is an object of
[1:06:05] worship and there wasn't unto worship
[1:06:07] him but in his great mind he he wanted
[1:06:10] these attributes to be expressed and in
[1:06:12] him was love
[1:06:15] but how could he be loved that there was
[1:06:17] nobody to love him so he created man in
[1:06:20] His image to love him
[1:06:22] notice now he also says in him was to be
[1:06:25] a father but how could he be a father
[1:06:27] when he had no offspring
[1:06:29] to father
[1:06:30] to call him Papa God
[1:06:32] to love him in him was to be a son in
[1:06:35] him was to be a savior how could he save
[1:06:37] if there was nobody to be lost and him
[1:06:40] was to be a Healer how could he have the
[1:06:42] attributes of being healer if there was
[1:06:44] nobody to get sick if his his offspring
[1:06:47] would not get sick and his offspring
[1:06:49] would not be lost and therefore these
[1:06:51] attributes that he had in him they had
[1:06:54] to come forth and brothers says all
[1:06:56] these great attributes that we see
[1:06:58] already expressed they were in God and
[1:07:00] so when God was thinking about his
[1:07:02] family
[1:07:04] was thinking about everything that he
[1:07:05] was going to do you were right there
[1:07:10] imagine if you could just go back in the
[1:07:12] mind of God and see it play out
[1:07:15] wouldn't that just be an awesome thought
[1:07:17] just go back you know how you can go
[1:07:19] back to black and white
[1:07:21] in those videos back in the long time
[1:07:24] ago when Charlie Chapman and it was just
[1:07:26] you look at it and everything just kind
[1:07:27] of speeds up and
[1:07:29] but you think you're going back in
[1:07:30] history there's some nostalgicness to it
[1:07:33] so I'm going somewhere Delaney don't
[1:07:35] worry so as our sense nostalgic when
[1:07:38] you're going back and reaching into
[1:07:39] those old archives of movies you're like
[1:07:42] wow that's neat but think about if you
[1:07:44] can go all the way back to the mind of
[1:07:46] God
[1:07:47] and see God in his thinking he's going
[1:07:49] to role play this and he's going to do
[1:07:51] this and he's going to do this he wants
[1:07:52] to be a savior he wants to be a Healer
[1:07:54] he knows he's going to have an offspring
[1:07:55] he's going to do this and the whole time
[1:07:57] you're there
[1:07:59] you're right there in his thoughts he
[1:08:01] chose you in him right there and then
[1:08:04] when all this before he blew the Stars
[1:08:07] solar system off his hands you were in
[1:08:09] his thinking
[1:08:11] and that's why you're here tonight
[1:08:14] it's not a mistake that you're here it's
[1:08:16] not a mistake that you're born into a
[1:08:18] family that believes the message
[1:08:20] it's not a mistake you know that you
[1:08:23] forsook the things of the world it's
[1:08:24] because you were a thought in the back
[1:08:27] part of God's mind
[1:08:29] and notice now let's go to the election
[1:08:31] this election and I'm not getting very
[1:08:33] far tonight am I
[1:08:34] I could bar from brother Tim
[1:08:37] but I dare I better not
[1:08:39] I'll just stop here shortly
[1:08:43] Lake uh election let's go here Romans 9
[1:08:46] verse 11.
[1:08:47] for the children being not yet born
[1:08:50] neither having done any good or evil
[1:08:52] that the purpose of God according to
[1:08:55] election might stand now we've already
[1:08:57] solidified and we'll go a little bit
[1:08:59] further here with that the purpose of
[1:09:00] God was Genesis 1 26 to bring forth of
[1:09:03] his kind uh this word election means the
[1:09:07] act of God's Free Will by which before
[1:09:09] the foundation of the world he decreed
[1:09:11] His blessings to certain persons the act
[1:09:14] of picking out
[1:09:16] now I know I use this analogy a lot but
[1:09:19] I was a little short fat kid
[1:09:21] that was cute but I was short and fat
[1:09:24] you know you ever seen the little little
[1:09:26] pug dog
[1:09:29] all the little roles don't look at me
[1:09:30] like that Philip
[1:09:33] I don't you need I don't need you
[1:09:34] looking at me like that thinking I'm all
[1:09:36] cute
[1:09:37] so you got all these little rows that
[1:09:39] was me I was a little fat cute kid right
[1:09:43] but I remember lining up dodgeball I'm
[1:09:45] going somewhere
[1:09:46] dodgeball I was the last one picked
[1:09:51] short
[1:09:53] fat
[1:09:54] short fat people ain't quick
[1:09:57] it's kind of like a counting method
[1:10:00] last one first out
[1:10:03] that's the lifo method okay just for
[1:10:04] y'all counting nerds
[1:10:06] so I'm the last one to get picked I'm
[1:10:08] the first one to get out because that
[1:10:09] dodgeball is coming and you know what a
[1:10:11] little short fat joke just don't move
[1:10:12] quick enough
[1:10:13] but you know thankfully God don't choose
[1:10:15] US based on our abilities
[1:10:18] God doesn't choose US based on our skill
[1:10:20] set he doesn't choose US based on the
[1:10:22] lack of our skills he doesn't choose US
[1:10:25] based on how fit or unfit we are how
[1:10:27] intelligent or unintelligent we are how
[1:10:30] socially awkward
[1:10:33] because some of us are socially awkward
[1:10:35] or unawkward we are God doesn't choose
[1:10:39] US based on those things he doesn't look
[1:10:40] at man the way we look at man
[1:10:43] see God chooses US based on election
[1:10:47] not man's election not Mama's election
[1:10:50] preachers Daddy's election but God's
[1:10:52] election so we find that this election
[1:10:54] was done before the foundation of the
[1:10:56] world not when you gave your heart to
[1:10:58] the Lord it was already predetermined
[1:11:00] he was already chosen in God but before
[1:11:03] the foundation of the world now notice
[1:11:04] now God deposited in your heart when you
[1:11:08] were chosen in God God deposited right
[1:11:11] there a desire in your heart to serve
[1:11:14] him and he put his decreed blessings on
[1:11:17] your life
[1:11:19] so I say that to say this when you tried
[1:11:21] to run
[1:11:25] when you tried to run you could only run
[1:11:28] so far because elections said that's
[1:11:30] enough
[1:11:31] come on somebody
[1:11:33] I know this may not be just a fiery
[1:11:35] message tonight but think about your
[1:11:37] election when you tried to run brother
[1:11:39] Philip you could only run so far but all
[1:11:42] of a sudden election allows you to see a
[1:11:45] water tower that broke that Amnesia off
[1:11:47] your life and you came to yourself and
[1:11:49] now look at you see election says your
[1:11:52] mind election says goodness and mercy is
[1:11:55] on your Trail no matter how far you go
[1:11:57] when you tried to quit when you tried to
[1:11:59] walk away election kept you election
[1:12:02] when let you walk away
[1:12:05] because you don't belong to yourself you
[1:12:08] belong to God
[1:12:10] notice when you're seeing coverage your
[1:12:12] life and it appeared that you wouldn't
[1:12:14] that you were never going to be able to
[1:12:15] serve God you would never stop your
[1:12:17] drinking and stop your smoking and stop
[1:12:19] all those ungodly things and committed
[1:12:21] all those ungodly acts elections said
[1:12:24] that you will not continue another day
[1:12:27] doing those things
[1:12:30] do you understand what I'm telling you
[1:12:31] it's not you quit those things election
[1:12:34] came to you and you recognize I am a
[1:12:37] seed and therefore those things started
[1:12:39] falling off of your life and you
[1:12:41] couldn't do them anymore because
[1:12:42] elections said it's over
[1:12:45] I'll say praise God because I'm a
[1:12:47] witness I understand when I gave my
[1:12:49] heart to the Lord the very next morning
[1:12:51] my language changed election said you're
[1:12:54] not going to talk like that anymore
[1:12:55] you're not going to walk like that
[1:12:57] anymore you're not going to act like
[1:12:58] that anymore you're not going to drink
[1:13:00] like that anymore you're not going to go
[1:13:01] to parties like that anymore it was not
[1:13:04] my election it was God's choosing I
[1:13:06] wasn't in the message yet but yet the
[1:13:08] message was already in me because why
[1:13:10] because I was chosen in God and so are
[1:13:14] you through election
[1:13:17] I sell praise God today and because we
[1:13:20] are the elected seeds of God's Sons and
[1:13:22] Daughters we have a purpose to fulfill
[1:13:25] and it ain't to fill your own worldly
[1:13:26] desires but it is to fulfill let us make
[1:13:30] man in our image
[1:13:32] and let them come forth let them be
[1:13:36] fruitful
[1:13:37] let them replenish let them multiply
[1:13:42] so notice
[1:13:44] his election is based on his
[1:13:47] foreknowledge of you
[1:13:50] so last time I spoke I think I I spoke
[1:13:53] about we were talking about election and
[1:13:55] foreknowledge and predestination but I
[1:13:57] want you to think because you were in
[1:13:59] the mind of God and we're all free moral
[1:14:01] ages how many of your free moral
[1:14:02] agencies so you have a right to choose
[1:14:04] right
[1:14:05] but if you were already chosen in him
[1:14:06] guess what you're going to choose
[1:14:09] come on somebody
[1:14:11] I'm trying to get you excited if you was
[1:14:14] already chosen in him you can't help but
[1:14:17] to choose to serve God because he's
[1:14:19] already decreed through election that
[1:14:21] you will serve him therefore it's not
[1:14:24] your choice that predestinates you it's
[1:14:27] his choosing in Ephesians 1 4 because he
[1:14:30] decreed that I'm going to have a Genesis
[1:14:32] 1 26 and because of that you are already
[1:14:35] coming forth and he's already
[1:14:36] predetermined your future
[1:14:40] hey I was just happy happy myself man
[1:14:43] think about it no matter what I'm facing
[1:14:45] on this side of Eternity God's already
[1:14:47] decree God already knows no matter if I
[1:14:49] get sick no matter if I meant to brink
[1:14:51] of death no matter if the thoughts are
[1:14:53] coming in my mind God's already decreed
[1:14:55] me I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of
[1:14:58] God there ain't enough demons in Hell
[1:15:00] there ain't enough things on this Earth
[1:15:02] that can break that power because my God
[1:15:04] has already put his word on it
[1:15:09] oh church I can't help you can't help
[1:15:12] why I say why tonight did you choose to
[1:15:15] serve God
[1:15:17] because God chose you
[1:15:22] notice here in Romans 8 and we'll start
[1:15:24] bringing this down here shortly
[1:15:29] I get into this and I start having fun
[1:15:30] but I dread it before again because I'm
[1:15:32] I'm not really a teacher but I'm just
[1:15:34] enjoying myself so much
[1:15:36] notice Roman 8 28 and we know how many
[1:15:38] knows this that all things work together
[1:15:40] to the good of them love God why is that
[1:15:44] think about why does all things work
[1:15:46] together to the gift of them that love
[1:15:48] Lord because you were chosen in him
[1:15:51] so he's going to make everything work
[1:15:53] towards your good
[1:15:54] you mean this heartache yep
[1:15:57] the worst pain I ever felt in my life
[1:15:59] God use it for my good
[1:16:02] the worst pain I ever went through at
[1:16:04] the brink of suicide the worst thing I
[1:16:06] ever faced in life he used it to get me
[1:16:08] where I'm at today
[1:16:10] he used it
[1:16:12] to get you where you are today
[1:16:15] because you wasn't the person you were
[1:16:17] today you wasn't that person five six
[1:16:19] years ago
[1:16:20] so God knows exactly what to allow his
[1:16:23] seed to go through
[1:16:25] to break that shell off so that life can
[1:16:28] come out
[1:16:29] so all things work together for the good
[1:16:31] and then the love God to them that are
[1:16:32] called and that word called there means
[1:16:34] divinely selected and appointed
[1:16:37] Hallelujah
[1:16:39] divinely selected and appointed
[1:16:41] according to his purpose not your
[1:16:43] purpose but it's his purpose there again
[1:16:46] we're going back to Genesis 1 what is
[1:16:48] that purpose to be a son and daughter of
[1:16:50] God for whom he did for no he also did
[1:16:53] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:16:55] image of his son that he might be the
[1:16:57] first born among many Brethren moreover
[1:17:00] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:17:03] called and whom he called them he also
[1:17:05] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:17:08] also glorified so let's look at the last
[1:17:10] state of this individual
[1:17:13] this word glorified
[1:17:16] so we find those that He divinely
[1:17:18] selected and appointed so where was that
[1:17:21] at
[1:17:23] that was it that was in the back part of
[1:17:25] his mind
[1:17:27] before you was a thought in a glimmer or
[1:17:29] a winking Mom and Daddy's eye way long
[1:17:31] before that
[1:17:33] before there was a
[1:17:35] any kind of Earth any kind of solar
[1:17:37] system way back there divinely selected
[1:17:39] what did he do he justified you he
[1:17:41] called you he justified you therefore he
[1:17:43] pronounced you just and righteous
[1:17:47] no sin on my bride
[1:17:49] no marks on my bride Nothing's Gonna Mar
[1:17:52] my bride she's perfect within and
[1:17:54] without
[1:17:55] but notice in those that he justified he
[1:17:58] also glorified and that word glorify
[1:18:02] means to praise
[1:18:04] now God is coming back here in Ephesians
[1:18:08] we saw God in Genesis 1 when he blessed
[1:18:11] his creation he stepped back and he
[1:18:14] adored what he created then we come in
[1:18:16] here and we find in Romans not Ephesians
[1:18:18] but Romans here Romans 8 and verse 30
[1:18:20] that he's also he's also glorified it
[1:18:23] means he's stepping back and he's
[1:18:25] magnifying her and he's celebrating her
[1:18:27] and he's given honor to her and he's he
[1:18:30] makes her glorious and he clothes her
[1:18:32] with Splendor and he renders it
[1:18:34] excellent
[1:18:36] to render illustrious
[1:18:38] think about it
[1:18:40] those that He predestinated
[1:18:43] those that He divinely selected those
[1:18:45] that he made righteous are made just
[1:18:49] those
[1:18:51] he's stepping back and he's like now
[1:18:53] this is my bride
[1:18:55] glorious within and without a rage not
[1:18:59] in her splendor but in his Splendor
[1:19:02] because it's his character
[1:19:04] that's flowing out through her so we
[1:19:07] find we have nothing to fear
[1:19:10] church we don't have anything to fear
[1:19:12] nothing to worry about because we have
[1:19:13] been divinely appointed divinely
[1:19:15] selected
[1:19:17] and we've been made righteous not by our
[1:19:19] own will but by the will of God and to
[1:19:22] be fine here in John 15 and verse 16.
[1:19:25] and let me get to a place where I can
[1:19:27] yeah we'll get to right there and then
[1:19:28] we'll stop for the night
[1:19:33] so we find here John 15 and 16 you have
[1:19:36] not chosen me
[1:19:38] but I
[1:19:40] have chosen you
[1:19:42] and when you go to bed tonight just
[1:19:44] think man I'm chosen of God
[1:19:46] you know a lot of times we get it mixed
[1:19:48] up because I used to think man I gave my
[1:19:49] heart to Lord I made my choice you know
[1:19:51] that's that Baptist terminal I made my
[1:19:54] choice
[1:19:54] what choice did you make
[1:19:57] served Lord no no man seeketh after God
[1:19:59] no not one but we find here you have not
[1:20:01] chosen me but I've chosen you and
[1:20:03] ordained you now this choosing means to
[1:20:05] pick out
[1:20:07] of all the people that he could have
[1:20:10] chose
[1:20:11] he chose you
[1:20:14] are chosen of God you're elected of God
[1:20:17] you're called to God you're anointed of
[1:20:19] God even when you make mistakes
[1:20:23] and you miserably fail you're chosen
[1:20:28] even when you don't feel like you're
[1:20:30] loved
[1:20:32] you're chosen
[1:20:34] notice even when it doesn't appear that
[1:20:37] he's nowhere around in your prayer life
[1:20:39] just doesn't flourish and it doesn't
[1:20:41] seem to get through Pastor roof you're
[1:20:43] still chosen
[1:20:45] see when you don't see God feel God hear
[1:20:47] God you're still chosen those are just
[1:20:50] circumstances it doesn't hinder God
[1:20:52] you're still chosen
[1:20:55] when he seems distant and far
[1:20:58] you're still chosen
[1:21:02] even in your UPS
[1:21:04] and your Downs
[1:21:06] in those night Seasons lonely moments it
[1:21:10] feels like you don't have a friend in
[1:21:11] the world you're still chosen
[1:21:15] if you don't get anything out of this
[1:21:16] message tonight
[1:21:18] I want you to get your chosen
[1:21:21] and we ain't talking about the TV series
[1:21:23] we're talking about
[1:21:25] eternally chosen in him before the
[1:21:27] foundation of the world
[1:21:29] you think about all this
[1:21:32] and brother bam goes he says
[1:21:34] God saw your character God saw your
[1:21:37] nature God saw all your ups and downs
[1:21:40] God saw everything notice he said he
[1:21:43] loved you he loved you before there was
[1:21:45] a world he knows your nature brother l
[1:21:48] he knowed your weaknesses
[1:21:51] young boys he knows your weaknesses
[1:21:54] he knows your habits
[1:21:57] see he knows all about you what he was
[1:21:59] going to be and what he was going to do
[1:22:01] and he looked all over this great
[1:22:02] universe and he says I Choose You
[1:22:09] my
[1:22:11] why because you were already chosen in
[1:22:14] him
[1:22:15] musicians come back
[1:22:18] see nothing that we had to do to earn
[1:22:21] his choosing we were already into
[1:22:24] Eternal thoughts of God
[1:22:27] and what did he do
[1:22:30] he slipped on your finger the wedding
[1:22:33] band of predestinated
[1:22:36] unmerited
[1:22:38] Grace
[1:22:41] and you said
[1:22:42] I do
[1:22:44] and when you accepted
[1:22:47] you received him
[1:22:50] gave he the power
[1:22:52] to become sons of God
[1:22:55] you always was a son and we'll get into
[1:22:57] that next time Lord willing if I had
[1:22:59] another hour I would go into it but I
[1:23:01] got a long road trip and you guys have
[1:23:03] been preached to for a long time last

[1:23:10] chosen in him
[1:23:13] and you can't be unchosen
[1:23:15] God don't choose you one minute to
[1:23:18] unchoose you the next
[1:23:20] how many of you ever played that little
[1:23:21] flower petal game she loves me she loves

[1:23:40] but God doesn't do that with us God
[1:23:43] chose you and he will not unchoose you
[1:23:47] you are
[1:23:49] elected
[1:23:51] predetermined
[1:23:53] to be there

[1:25:27] the message was always in you
[1:25:31] so I went 20-something years some of you
[1:25:33] went longer some of you didn't go so
