[0:14] I saw your
[0:19] struggles. Fear had its grip on you.
[0:25] I saw the years of tears and prayers
[0:29] that were prayed for
[0:33] you. I saw the
[0:38] torment. Satan's blood put on
[0:43] you. But
[0:45] I
[0:47] watched I watched you break through.
[0:53] I watched you break
[0:55] free of those chains that held you
[1:01] bound. I saw God's mighty
[1:06] hand bring
[1:08] deliverance
[1:11] down in just one
[1:15] moment.
[1:17] Atonement changed, delivered, set free.
[1:22] I see what God's done for
[1:28] you. I've watched you break
[1:32] [Music]
[1:39] through. Oh, Satan trapped
[1:42] [Music]
[1:44] you in his dark web of sin. tried to put
[1:50] out the light that God had
[1:54] put with
[1:57] him. We serve a God who
[2:01] answers and didn't stop praying for
[2:06] you. There
[2:08] I
[2:10] watched I watched you break
[2:14] through. I watched you break
[2:17] free from those chains that held you
[2:23] bound. I saw God's mighty hand bring
[2:29] deliverance
[2:32] down. In just one
[2:35] moment,
[2:38] atonement, changed, delivered, set free.
[2:42] I see what God's done for you.
[2:49] I watched you break
[2:54] through in just one
[2:57] moment.
[2:59] Atonement, changed, delivered, set free.
[3:04] I see what God's done for
[3:06] [Music]
[3:10] you. I watched you break through.
[3:18] [Applause]
