[57:33] Lord that you would speak to your people

[57:39] Lord of a vision you said right it
[57:41] plainly so God it will it will speak in
[57:44] the end time though it Terry wait for it
[57:48] so Lord we're here today waiting on the
[57:51] understanding that you've given us in
[57:52] this hour thankful that you sent us a
[57:54] prophet messenger Lord that will but
[57:57] crack into those symbols Lord and just
[57:59] begin to reveal the Revelation the
[58:01] inspiration Lord behind each and
[58:03] everyone that there will be a people
[58:05] Lord God that will make
[58:08] preparation Lord we are that people this
[58:10] morning not just here at evening light
[58:11] Tabernacle but Lord those that believe
[58:14] and and follow the message of the hour
[58:16] around the world Lord you'll have a
[58:17] bride of every Kindred tribe tongue
[58:20] people and Nation Lord we're here today
[58:23] to reflect that bride to be a part of
[58:25] that calling out Lord we just invite you
[58:27] Lord this morning that you would come
[58:29] and just speak to us Lord minister to
[58:31] our hearts Our Lives father may you just
[58:34] establish on the foundation of Truth for
[58:36] we ask it this morning in Jesus
[58:39] name amen and amen if you have your
[58:41] Bibles this
[58:42] morning we're going to look back here
[58:46] pick back up on the thought we had this
[58:47] past Wednesday night on living in the
[58:50] hour of
[58:52] fulfillment and I actually want to give
[58:55] this morning's message a subtitle under
[58:58] the cover of Darkness so living in the
[59:01] hour of fulfillment under the cover of
[59:03] darkness and we look here at habc 2 and
[59:05] verse two and the Lord answered me and
[59:08] said write the vision and make it plain
[59:10] upon the tables that he may run that
[59:12] readeth it for the vision is yet for an
[59:15] appointed time but at the end it shall
[59:17] speak and lie not though it t wait for
[59:20] it because it will surely come it will
[59:23] not t God bless you you can have your
[59:25] seats this morning
[59:27] we think about this phrase here under
[59:29] the cover of Darkness that actually
[59:32] means hidden by the darkness of night so
[59:34] we want to look at some things that have
[59:36] taken place in our day in this age
[59:38] things that that take place under the
[59:42] ospice of darkness and we're going to
[59:44] kind of get into that this morning and
[59:46] trust that you're not in a hurry today
[59:48] and understand this Labor Day weekend
[59:50] and we have a guest speaker it's not me
[59:52] but it's the Lord so let's just treat
[59:55] this service as touch this morning but
[59:57] we want to look at the things and we can
[59:58] find that things that are taking place
[1:00:00] in this day because the light has
[1:00:02] dwindled out and notice the light is
[1:00:05] only with a handful of people and to
[1:00:07] refresh from our service this past
[1:00:09] Wednesday we we recognize the word
[1:00:11] Vision here means a prophecy it means a
[1:00:14] Divine communication a dream of
[1:00:16] Revelation or an oracle so we understand
[1:00:19] that without Vision Without this divine
[1:00:21] intervention or this divine revelation
[1:00:23] the people perish and Amos 3:7 tells us
[1:00:28] that God will do nothing but he revealed
[1:00:30] his Secrets unto his servants the
[1:00:32] prophets so before the end can come the
[1:00:35] prophecies regarding the end time must
[1:00:37] manifest they must be fulfilled
[1:00:40] therefore before the end time can come
[1:00:42] before God can return for his second
[1:00:45] coming God has to send a prophet
[1:00:48] messenger all right God has to send
[1:00:51] another Elijah and and brother bam says
[1:00:53] this Prophet Messenger will be in the
[1:00:55] nature and and manners as were Elijah
[1:00:57] and John we also understand through the
[1:01:00] Wednesday night God never changes he
[1:01:02] always does the same thing the coming of
[1:01:05] a prophet is a sign that God is ready to
[1:01:09] speak Church we're not looking for
[1:01:11] another Prophet we're not looking for
[1:01:12] another messenger we've received the
[1:01:14] prophet messenger for this age and I
[1:01:16] believe that he has spoken to us and
[1:01:18] brother B says a prophet is a special
[1:01:20] man a prophet is a man whom the word of
[1:01:23] the Lord comes to because the prophet is
[1:01:25] so so designed that his subconscious and
[1:01:28] his first conscious is so close together
[1:01:30] that he doesn't sleep when he
[1:01:33] dreams and brother man would tell us now
[1:01:35] this prophet he foresees things way off
[1:01:37] things that is coming he sees the cup of
[1:01:40] God's Wrath full before it's filled so
[1:01:43] we want to look at these things and I I
[1:01:45] find it so important that the prophet of
[1:01:47] God will preach a message in 65 and
[1:01:49] we're going to go into a little bit of
[1:01:50] it today but modern events are made
[1:01:53] clear by prophecy
[1:01:56] so and though we're living in a dark age
[1:01:58] we're living with darknesses all around
[1:01:59] but I want you to understand we've
[1:02:01] received the light we've received a
[1:02:03] Vindicated message and we understand
[1:02:05] that we can look back at prophecy not
[1:02:07] just the prophecies that he's made but
[1:02:10] go back into the prophets and of old
[1:02:12] Isaiah Haba Jeremiah different ones
[1:02:15] Daniel and we can see that those
[1:02:17] prophecies are made manifest today and
[1:02:20] we can see the modern events in which
[1:02:22] we're living in they're made clear cuz
[1:02:24] we can look back God is sent us a
[1:02:26] prophet that's rose up and he caught the
[1:02:28] inspiration of those forerunners or
[1:02:31] those prophets that's gone before him
[1:02:33] and he's brought the inspiration down
[1:02:34] and revealed it to you and
[1:02:37] I you believe that this morning so he
[1:02:40] says he's like an eagle he can fly high
[1:02:42] into the atmosphere and he sees what's
[1:02:45] coming so I want you young people again
[1:02:47] we're because this is going to be a
[1:02:49] refresher for many of us older people
[1:02:50] that's been in the message for years or
[1:02:53] maybe some of you are new here new to
[1:02:54] the message I want this to be something
[1:02:56] that'll ground you in the faith you
[1:02:58] young people that'll ground you in the
[1:03:00] faith to understand why we believe what
[1:03:03] we believe and how the prophecies the
[1:03:07] interpretation of these propheties they
[1:03:09] not only vindicate a prophet but they
[1:03:11] vindicate you as the the one to receive
[1:03:14] the prophet messenger we were not just
[1:03:16] receiving him but we're receiving the
[1:03:18] message and that message is what
[1:03:20] translates our bodies brother says now
[1:03:23] God likened a prophet to an eagle that
[1:03:25] would go up in the makeup of a prophet
[1:03:28] he's a sear that is in the spirit he
[1:03:30] comes beyond the emotion of a
[1:03:32] church he goes beyond the rhythm of
[1:03:34] music goes beyond the Clapping of hands
[1:03:37] he goes beyond the joy among the saints
[1:03:39] he goes beyond all that God brings him
[1:03:41] up into the rim of loone then he opens
[1:03:44] his eyes and he lets him look around and
[1:03:46] he sees things that is to come then he
[1:03:49] brings him back down among the members
[1:03:51] of the body to for tell them of what is
[1:03:55] in the m
[1:03:57] so the prophet is here when we
[1:03:59] understand why God sends a prophet then
[1:04:01] we can understand the hour in which
[1:04:03] we're living because he is to make known
[1:04:06] the current events he's to make known
[1:04:08] what's going on around us he's to make
[1:04:10] known all those that's been prophesied
[1:04:12] before him he comes and catches that
[1:04:14] inspiration he said he rides way up
[1:04:17] yonder he looks way off there and he
[1:04:19] sees that Cup of Wrath poured out that's
[1:04:23] what the prophet's looking at he's not
[1:04:25] looking at what's going going on here
[1:04:26] he's looking Yonder see he's saying it's
[1:04:29] coming he can go so high till he can see
[1:04:31] the shade he said now the world will be
[1:04:34] dark darkness and gross Darkness he's up
[1:04:37] high enough the sun shining now but he
[1:04:40] sees the shade coming he's saying what
[1:04:43] he's looking at it ain't here yet but
[1:04:45] it's sure to be here that's right it's
[1:04:47] going to be here gross Darkness upon the
[1:04:49] people he knows it's coming years away
[1:04:53] but yet he sees it amen so brother
[1:04:56] Brand's picking up the inspiration of
[1:04:58] Isaiah and so let's turn to Isaiah 60
[1:05:01] and verse2 and this is where we're going
[1:05:02] to start digging into under the cover of
[1:05:07] darkness my wife told me today she said
[1:05:10] look she goes don't you leave us in
[1:05:12] darkness I said don't worry we're coming
[1:05:15] out but we got to understand the hour in
[1:05:18] which we're living in we got to
[1:05:19] understand we can see the darkness and
[1:05:21] when you can see these things begin to
[1:05:24] manifest it only show knows who you are
[1:05:26] and where we are in time and how close
[1:05:29] we are to the coming of the Lord so we
[1:05:33] find here in Isaiah 60 verse2 says for
[1:05:35] Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[1:05:38] Earth the darkness shall cover the Earth
[1:05:42] and gross darkness of people but the
[1:05:44] Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory
[1:05:47] shall be seen upon thee so when we look
[1:05:51] at this word Darkness here it means
[1:05:54] Misery the
[1:05:56] destruction death ignorance sorrow
[1:05:59] wickedness now you tell me what other
[1:06:01] age has seen Misery the way we've seen
[1:06:03] misery in this hour they've seen
[1:06:05] destruction death ignorance sorrow
[1:06:07] wickedness look at the wickedness of
[1:06:09] humanity right now and you think how in
[1:06:12] the world could it get possibly get any
[1:06:14] darker than the hour in which we're
[1:06:15] living in but the Bible says Darkness
[1:06:18] the darkness shall cover the Earth and
[1:06:21] gross Darkness to people so Isaiah the
[1:06:23] prophet he was lifted up high in the
[1:06:26] spiritual realm notice he looked beyond
[1:06:28] Calvary he looked beyond Pentecost he
[1:06:31] looked way down into the seventh Church
[1:06:33] age and he saw this hour he saw this day
[1:06:37] and notice he could see that it would be
[1:06:39] so dark that gross Darkness would be
[1:06:41] upon the
[1:06:43] people notice he proceedes where the day
[1:06:46] where right is wrong and wrong is right
[1:06:49] he can see where we the day that men
[1:06:51] will try to be women and women try to be
[1:06:53] men yes come on where neutrality among
[1:06:56] the children is accepted and they can
[1:06:58] decide what they want to be but B
[1:07:01] despite their biological body parts he
[1:07:04] sees a day where animal life has more
[1:07:06] value than human life where abortion is
[1:07:09] accepted but you can't take an ego an
[1:07:11] egg from an eagle you get a prison
[1:07:13] sentence he's looked and seen today in
[1:07:15] which we're living in he's seen today
[1:07:17] where insanity is among all those who
[1:07:20] don't have the Holy Ghost don't you
[1:07:23] understand young people why it's
[1:07:24] important that you receive the baptism
[1:07:26] of the Holy Ghost for if you don't have
[1:07:28] the Holy Ghost you will go into utter
[1:07:33] Darkness yes and the message of Shalom
[1:07:35] and I believe that's a great wonderful
[1:07:36] message because it means peace yes and
[1:07:40] he says this gross Darkness I wish to
[1:07:42] speak on first he says there's so much
[1:07:44] of that in the world today my goodness
[1:07:46] this is a 1964 where are we at today in
[1:07:50] 20124 notice they're growing and it's
[1:07:52] growing darker and darker all the time
[1:07:54] each year we find that the world's
[1:07:57] getting darker spiritually speaking
[1:07:58] because they're groping in darkness and
[1:08:01] there is more sin just passing through
[1:08:04] what we have the assassination of the
[1:08:06] president and so forth and people being
[1:08:08] murdered right here in our country amen
[1:08:12] notice now he says he says where we
[1:08:14] wouldn't think that would happen in a
[1:08:15] time of modern civilization but we sure
[1:08:17] have it because gross darkness is upon
[1:08:19] the people those who will not turn to
[1:08:22] light then there is only one thing that
[1:08:25] can for this coming year you're going to
[1:08:27] he says you're going to get stooped
[1:08:28] darker and darker as the year goes
[1:08:32] on and some of you young people there's
[1:08:34] a spirit that lays over you just wait a
[1:08:35] little bit longer just wait a little bit
[1:08:37] longer you know you got time you got
[1:08:39] time look you don't have time time is
[1:08:42] coming to fulfillment we're living in a
[1:08:44] day where time is about to be all
[1:08:46] wrapped up and we're about to head back
[1:08:48] to Eternity you got to make sure you're
[1:08:50] calling an election
[1:08:52] now you got to make not just you're
[1:08:54] calling an election you got to make sure
[1:08:56] you have the goods that you got the Holy
[1:08:58] Ghost living out through your life and
[1:09:00] you're not just playing Church you're
[1:09:01] not just born in a message home you
[1:09:03] don't just come to a message church and
[1:09:05] hear message preach and preach day in
[1:09:07] and day out but you got the The Giver of
[1:09:09] the message inside of you portraying the
[1:09:12] word of God living according to the word
[1:09:14] of God feeding on the word of God
[1:09:17] becoming the light in this
[1:09:19] hour and I will Echo the words of a
[1:09:22] prophet Shalom peace I give unto you he
[1:09:25] says but those who will turn on this New
[1:09:27] Year's to the light then you shall get
[1:09:29] brighter and brighter until that perfect
[1:09:31] day that we look for his appearing where
[1:09:34] all Darkness will be faded away he says
[1:09:36] that's the reason of that is why I say
[1:09:38] to the Church of the Living God today
[1:09:39] Shalom because we are his
[1:09:43] light church if you doubt that there is
[1:09:46] darkness in the land just go out go look
[1:09:48] on CNN go look on Fox
[1:09:50] News my
[1:09:52] goodness social media it's broadcasted
[1:09:55] all over it yes there's no reason why we
[1:09:58] should stick our head in the sand and
[1:10:00] act like we're not living in the last
[1:10:01] day we are living in the last
[1:10:04] daysen but notice just because we're
[1:10:07] living in the last days shouldn't bring
[1:10:08] fear and torment and intrepidation upon
[1:10:10] us it should let us know we're that
[1:10:12] close to going home we're that close for
[1:10:15] the greatest prophecy to ever hit the
[1:10:18] face of the Earth the greatest Prophet
[1:10:19] that there will be a group that alive
[1:10:21] and remain at my coming they will be
[1:10:23] changed in a moment in the the tweaking
[1:10:26] of and I look in the midst of Darkness
[1:10:28] there's still going to be a prophecy
[1:10:30] fulfilled and I'm looking at people
[1:10:32] today men and women boys and girls who
[1:10:34] will fulfill that prophecy of a body
[1:10:37] change but it takes place in the midst
[1:10:40] of gross Darkness under cover of
[1:10:43] Darkness he's going to snatch out a
[1:10:45] bride woo I don't know about you but
[1:10:48] that does me good yes I mean I can't put
[1:10:51] my hope in politics I can't put my hope
[1:10:54] my trust in man I can't put it in
[1:10:56] business I can't put it in my own my own
[1:10:58] self I can't put it in my family but I
[1:11:00] can put it in him I can put it in this
[1:11:02] word because we know heavens and earth
[1:11:04] will pass away but this word will never
[1:11:07] pass
[1:11:09] away notice he says here the prophet
[1:11:12] said Gross Darkness upon this people
[1:11:15] upon the people of the world gross
[1:11:17] Darkness not just darkness but gross
[1:11:19] darkness and that word there means a
[1:11:21] dark fog or Cloud dense
[1:11:26] people's minds are so clouded today amen
[1:11:30] come on some of y'all should say Amen to
[1:11:32] that amen you bump head long into them
[1:11:34] each and every
[1:11:37] day think about this have you noticed in
[1:11:40] the last few years some of you men and
[1:11:42] women around my age that how each year
[1:11:45] it seems that that darkness comes more
[1:11:46] and more he goes I was speaking the
[1:11:48] other day I said to my wife you know it
[1:11:49] seems like as the years goes on as it
[1:11:52] just seems like the people begin to get
[1:11:54] further and further away from the real
[1:11:56] thing that we should be coming closer
[1:11:57] and closer
[1:11:59] to and look it even is happening within
[1:12:01] the ranks of our message people are
[1:12:04] getting further and further and further
[1:12:06] away from the thing they should be
[1:12:08] getting closer and closer and closer to
[1:12:11] well they think what this message is all
[1:12:12] about a man or this message was only a
[1:12:14] man's idea it has nothing to do with man
[1:12:17] at
[1:12:19] all we look here in Genesis 6 and verse
[1:12:22] 5 we're going to see what God thinks
[1:12:23] about he said God saw that the
[1:12:25] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[1:12:28] and that every imagination of his
[1:12:30] thoughts of his heart was on evil
[1:12:33] continually now this was in the
[1:12:35] beginning this is in Genesis so where is
[1:12:38] the heart of man today if the heart of
[1:12:41] man in Genesis was on evil continue
[1:12:44] where are we at in society today when
[1:12:47] we've been through seven Church ages or
[1:12:49] we're down at the end of the seventh
[1:12:51] Church age every thought every
[1:12:53] imagination of man is own evil you can't
[1:12:56] go anywhere without evil being portrayed
[1:12:59] murder rapes crime everything drugs
[1:13:01] different things of that nature all
[1:13:03] being pushed in front of you it's that
[1:13:05] dark in the hour in which we're
[1:13:08] living He says notice now among man he
[1:13:11] could look on the streets and the most
[1:13:13] and most among women he says watch their
[1:13:15] desires and watch like today he says
[1:13:17] they're changing attitudes all the time
[1:13:20] men are becoming more like women now
[1:13:23] come on Evite amen that
[1:13:25] yes sir men are becoming more like women
[1:13:27] and women are becoming more like men it
[1:13:30] seems like there's no way to stop it he
[1:13:31] goes across the nation preaching against
[1:13:34] the thing and come back next year and
[1:13:35] it's worse than when I started see it's
[1:13:37] them people they want to do right but
[1:13:39] there's something about it won't let
[1:13:41] them do it it just pressings them down
[1:13:44] forces them it's like a heavy dark fog
[1:13:47] over the whole earth so gross darkness
[1:13:50] is upon them not only in Phoenix but
[1:13:52] over the whole world there seems to be
[1:13:54] just a roping Darkness that's Gathering
[1:13:57] getting more dense and dense all the
[1:13:59] time just smothering out real manhood
[1:14:02] real Womanhood I'm talking in the
[1:14:05] natural Amen brother Andrew Glover and I
[1:14:08] were in Los Angeles a couple months back
[1:14:10] and we were preaching there at San
[1:14:12] Marcos for the Believers there and we
[1:14:14] went to Los Angeles just to kind of
[1:14:16] trace the footsteps of the prophet and
[1:14:17] we got to do a lot of things and we
[1:14:19] actually got a you know the night before
[1:14:21] we left we went checked into a hotel and
[1:14:23] it was a it was a nice hotel and we come
[1:14:25] walking we're going to the elevator and
[1:14:27] all of a sudden here comes some 6' three
[1:14:31] 6'2 strapping man with a minis skirt on
[1:14:33] about to hear a purse over his shoulder
[1:14:36] makeup on Andrew looked at me and I
[1:14:38] looked at him
[1:14:40] like I mean hey he was a nicel looking
[1:14:43] guy but he wasn't a nicel looking
[1:14:45] woman but we fine he come just walking
[1:14:49] in like it high heels on minis skirt
[1:14:51] with a purse over his shoulder makeup on
[1:14:54] headed to the front FR counter let me
[1:14:56] tell you we're living in the hour of
[1:14:59] darkness and yet the world and the world
[1:15:02] system wants to make you okay with it
[1:15:04] that they say you have to accept it but
[1:15:07] they don't have to accept our standard
[1:15:09] they don't have to accept our rules but
[1:15:11] they want you to accept them and and
[1:15:13] receive them and include them into our
[1:15:16] society let me tell you where it's an
[1:15:17] Abomination then it's Abomination today
[1:15:20] it'll be an Abomination tomorrow we're
[1:15:22] going to stand with this word
[1:15:26] but we see it men are groping in
[1:15:28] darkness and he said it's coming more
[1:15:30] and more into our
[1:15:32] churches when you say I don't believe
[1:15:34] that brother well I'll just show you
[1:15:36] today various Christian denominations
[1:15:39] are accepting the homosexual and TR
[1:15:41] transgender identity and inclusive of
[1:15:44] the homosexuals and transgender people
[1:15:46] such as the Episcopal Church the
[1:15:48] Presbyterian Church J United Church of
[1:15:50] Christ and the Metropolitan Community
[1:15:52] Church they all accept these
[1:15:55] Lifestyles into their churches into
[1:15:58] their
[1:16:00] pulpits in order to accept this you have
[1:16:03] to reject the word of God you have to
[1:16:06] compromise on the word because the word
[1:16:08] stands against this God never changes
[1:16:11] his thoughts he never changes his ideas
[1:16:14] about it if it was sin and Deuteronomy
[1:16:16] it's sin in this hour it's sin again in
[1:16:19] this day he never changes his
[1:16:21] Focus but
[1:16:23] notice he said is coming more and more
[1:16:25] into the churches and then when you
[1:16:27] raise up and say something against it
[1:16:30] then they condemn you for
[1:16:32] it we had a football player not us but
[1:16:34] the world had a football player last
[1:16:36] year toward the end of the year I
[1:16:37] believe was a kicker for some team and
[1:16:38] he gave his own inter his own idea he's
[1:16:40] a Catholic and thank God he stood for
[1:16:42] something but he he he stood against the
[1:16:44] world system or something they were
[1:16:46] there and he CAU all kind of persecution
[1:16:48] for standing for biblical principles
[1:16:52] because here we find here this is in
[1:16:53] 1964 the something against it to go
[1:16:56] against their accepting attitude of it
[1:16:59] they want to condemn you or they want to
[1:17:00] persecute you they want to say well
[1:17:02] you're you're intolerant well absolutely
[1:17:04] right we are intolerant to
[1:17:07] sin I'm not going to tolerate it in my
[1:17:09] house I'm not going to tolerate it in my
[1:17:11] family I'm not going to tolerate it in
[1:17:12] my church I'm not going to tolerate it
[1:17:15] I'm going to stand against it because
[1:17:17] we're standing for the truth in this
[1:17:20] hour but notice before a church or
[1:17:23] people can accept the lifestyle
[1:17:25] of transgender homosexual neutral gender
[1:17:28] neutral identities and things of that
[1:17:29] nature we have or they have to first
[1:17:32] reject Christ and Christ is the
[1:17:36] word so we
[1:17:39] believe we believe in the coming or we
[1:17:42] believe in coming as you
[1:17:46] are we believe in coming as you
[1:17:50] are but don't stay as you
[1:17:53] are I was being told just the other day
[1:17:55] we were there was a a a a someone in a
[1:17:59] church we were having fellowship with
[1:18:01] brother Micah and Sister Amy and
[1:18:02] different ones at a big church over
[1:18:03] there one of the famous Church in
[1:18:05] shreport I say famous big church I'm not
[1:18:07] going to give the name of the pastor but
[1:18:09] there was somebody that came to the
[1:18:10] pastor and said there was a gentleman
[1:18:11] coming to that church and he was a
[1:18:13] homosexual and he dressed I guess he
[1:18:15] dressed in drag dressed like a woman
[1:18:16] he'd been coming for a year and the
[1:18:18] person went to the pastor and complained
[1:18:19] about it he said well the you know well
[1:18:21] God says you know he what did he say he
[1:18:24] uh you know he he lived among Sinners or
[1:18:27] he walked among Sinners yeah he may have
[1:18:30] walked among Sinners but he changed them
[1:18:32] that's right that's the thing about it
[1:18:33] we're okay if you want to be homosexual
[1:18:35] come to even like Tabernacle but be
[1:18:37] changed be expected to be changed we're
[1:18:40] not going to tolerate with that
[1:18:42] lifestyle and it's no different than any
[1:18:44] other kind of sin whether it be drugs
[1:18:46] whether it be womanized no matter what
[1:18:48] it is you come as you are but come
[1:18:50] prepared to be changed let the word of
[1:18:53] God change you
[1:18:55] don't come and just grope in sin don't
[1:18:57] come and just grope in darkness when
[1:18:59] there's been a way out God had provided
[1:19:01] you an answer God provided us a way that
[1:19:04] we can escape the wrath that is to come
[1:19:06] come expect it to be changed don't come
[1:19:08] expected to be to be fed and just
[1:19:11] cuddled and just oh I just want to come
[1:19:13] and do my due diligence to be a
[1:19:14] Christian we come to the house of God to
[1:19:17] receive correction every service we come
[1:19:20] to be changed by the
[1:19:23] word and there no brother says when God
[1:19:25] sends a gift he'll vindicate that
[1:19:29] gift when the people received the
[1:19:31] message back in their day it was a
[1:19:33] jubilee for them but to reject it notice
[1:19:36] but when it's proven to be from God and
[1:19:38] the people were rejected there's nothing
[1:19:40] left but
[1:19:41] chaos see and if the people would
[1:19:43] receive it it would be a golden jubilee
[1:19:45] for that people if they would receive it
[1:19:48] but it always lays to the people God
[1:19:51] does his part so therefore we're not
[1:19:54] getting look young people you're not
[1:19:55] getting in on Mom and Dad's
[1:19:57] coattails you're not getting in on who
[1:19:59] your pastor
[1:20:01] is or whatever the friendship and the
[1:20:04] relationship you may have with your
[1:20:05] favorite preacher that's not going to
[1:20:07] get you in amen but we find if you will
[1:20:11] accept it though it'll be a golden
[1:20:13] jubilee to you what does that mean that
[1:20:16] means your heart will be overflowing
[1:20:17] with the joys of the Lord they won't be
[1:20:19] forcing you to come to church you won't
[1:20:21] come every two or three months and say
[1:20:23] oh well me and God we got this thing
[1:20:25] going you know we we're good but you
[1:20:26] ain't darken the house of God in months
[1:20:28] you think you and God got something
[1:20:29] going so what is God telling you that he
[1:20:32] ain't telling nobody else exactly notice
[1:20:35] the Bible says forsake not the
[1:20:37] assemblying together of those notice
[1:20:40] there's rules there look we don't make
[1:20:41] the rules God sets the rules we abide by
[1:20:44] the
[1:20:46] rules while I'm even going there I have
[1:20:48] no idea but maybe it's for somebody but
[1:20:50] the gospel of Christ has been rejected
[1:20:54] yes
[1:20:55] he goes you don't want to believe that
[1:20:57] but it's a noted fact it's the truth
[1:20:59] it's too bad but it's the truth so this
[1:21:02] is in 1957 Queen of Sheba when they were
[1:21:05] when they did receive it great signs and
[1:21:07] wonders and Jubilee broke out but when
[1:21:09] they rejected it then darkness and gross
[1:21:12] Darkness come to the people oh people of
[1:21:14] this last day can't you see why darkness
[1:21:16] is falling on the
[1:21:18] country so can't we see why darkness is
[1:21:21] falling on this country and every in the
[1:21:25] world today because they rejected the
[1:21:29] message
[1:21:30] notice brother brand indicts this
[1:21:33] generation for rejecting refusing
[1:21:36] crucifying the word aresh that's right
[1:21:40] God proved that it was him not William
[1:21:42] Brandon but him that was in this
[1:21:44] generation with infallible signs and
[1:21:47] wonders and the church leaders now
[1:21:50] rejected the signs they rejected the
[1:21:52] Wonders they rejected the
[1:21:55] message because it didn't come according
[1:21:57] to their
[1:21:58] system so they didn't reject Brother
[1:22:00] Brad I want you to understand that they
[1:22:02] rejected Christ that's they rejected his
[1:22:04] word they rejected the light for the
[1:22:07] hour that's right and they put Christ on
[1:22:09] the outside of his
[1:22:13] church notice now the reason that I
[1:22:15] indict this generation this is in the
[1:22:17] indictment 1963 he goes the reason that
[1:22:20] I indict this generation of guilty of
[1:22:22] crucifying blaspheming the manifested of
[1:22:26] the son manifest the Son of God as was
[1:22:28] promised by the prophets in Christ
[1:22:30] himself to be in the last days like it
[1:22:32] was in the days of Noah in the days of
[1:22:34] Sodom blasphemy which they crucified to
[1:22:37] the people the Son of God of fresh he is
[1:22:40] a Vindicated word one word against it
[1:22:42] can never be forgiven and he says I'm
[1:22:45] inditing the Pentecostals I'm inditing
[1:22:47] the Presbyterians the Baptist every
[1:22:50] denomination in the world by Wicked
[1:22:53] selfish greed you took the word of life
[1:22:55] and crucified it before the people and
[1:22:58] blasphemed it and called it
[1:23:01] fanaticism which God has raised up in
[1:23:04] the midst to prove that he is the same
[1:23:06] yesterday today and forever he goes I
[1:23:09] indict this generation that's so I'm
[1:23:13] going to piece some things together for
[1:23:14] you by God's grace this morning we're
[1:23:16] looking at under the cover of Darkness
[1:23:18] so how can how do this or how do we or
[1:23:21] how does a nation begin to grope in dark
[1:23:24] because they
[1:23:26] reject you have to reject the truth in
[1:23:29] order to grow in darkness so we find
[1:23:32] these things just didn't happen
[1:23:34] overnight all right
[1:23:36] Church it wasn't just all of a sudden
[1:23:39] the wicked scheme got uh got removed and
[1:23:41] all of a sudden they begin to enact laws
[1:23:42] and laws and laws and laws overnight and
[1:23:44] then all of a sudden no people wouldn't
[1:23:45] stand for that but we find they begin to
[1:23:49] do it all under the cover of Darkness
[1:23:51] because people rejected the people
[1:23:53] didn't want Christ they didn't want the
[1:23:55] Living Word in their midst they would
[1:23:57] they didn't want to tow the line to to
[1:23:59] Christianity but they wanted to go on in
[1:24:01] their own thinking in their own ways and
[1:24:04] God gave them over to a reprobate mind
[1:24:06] and then we begin to see Humanity begins
[1:24:09] to dwindle and dwindle and dwindle and
[1:24:11] dwindle and dwindle to the point that we
[1:24:14] are today living in Gross
[1:24:17] Darkness but he says here now notice now
[1:24:20] he goes I indict the Pentecostals I
[1:24:22] indict the Presbyterians I indict to
[1:24:25] baptist every denomination in the world
[1:24:28] by Wicked selfish greed you took the
[1:24:30] word of life you crucified it before the
[1:24:33] people and blasphemed it and you called
[1:24:35] it fanaticism that's right which God has
[1:24:39] raised up to prove that he's the same
[1:24:40] yesterday today and forever God has
[1:24:42] proved himself alive God proved that
[1:24:44] this is the word what you have has got
[1:24:46] is a bunch of dogma and creas he says
[1:24:49] what you got is a bunch of Dogma cre but
[1:24:51] where is the Living God at
[1:24:54] you got a bunch of Dolmas you got a
[1:24:56] bunch of Creeds you got a formality of
[1:24:58] Christianity a form of godliness but you
[1:25:01] deny the power of God to change a
[1:25:04] life he says because you turn down the
[1:25:08] word of life that would give you these
[1:25:10] things what an hour we're living
[1:25:13] in notice where did Jesus get his
[1:25:19] Spears where'd he get his Spears
[1:25:23] nobody he got his Spears where on
[1:25:25] Calvary he got them from where he got
[1:25:28] them from the Roman
[1:25:29] soldiers think about it where didd he
[1:25:31] get his Spears at in his side where did
[1:25:32] he get his Spears on calary where did he
[1:25:34] get it today in the
[1:25:37] Pulpit where did they come from
[1:25:40] Jerusalem where do they come from today
[1:25:43] denomination that's the one who claims
[1:25:46] to love him that's who did it that's who
[1:25:49] does it today his second Calvary where
[1:25:51] he receives his pierces against the word
[1:25:54] that's what pierces him who is he he's
[1:25:57] the word he is the word where is he
[1:25:59] pierc the hardest from the pulpit in the
[1:26:02] holy places just like it was then he
[1:26:05] says I got a right to do it as a
[1:26:07] minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:26:10] with signs proving that he is God I got
[1:26:12] a right to bring indictment against this
[1:26:15] generation now he's not just indicting
[1:26:17] the denominations now he's inditing the
[1:26:21] generation come on Church
[1:26:24] he's inditing the people now because
[1:26:26] they didn't receive the light because
[1:26:28] they went with the denomination they
[1:26:30] went with the religious teachers they
[1:26:32] went with those that said it was
[1:26:35] fanaticism he goes I got a right as a
[1:26:37] minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:26:39] what signs proving that he is God I got
[1:26:41] a right to bring indictment against this
[1:26:43] generation his hardest spear points has
[1:26:46] been right from the pulpits where they
[1:26:48] criticized and said don't go out there
[1:26:50] with that stuff that's of the devil
[1:26:52] right in the place that's supposed to
[1:26:54] love
[1:26:56] him and he said it couldn't been done 50
[1:26:58] years ago but it could be done today so
[1:27:02] he's indicted in 1963 the
[1:27:05] generation therefore he said the time
[1:27:07] for repentance of a nation is
[1:27:11] gone now we go out there and we have
[1:27:14] denominational friends and pastors and
[1:27:17] different ones like that and we know
[1:27:18] what the world's crying for they're
[1:27:20] crying for
[1:27:21] Revival they're crying for you know

[1:27:43] happening in the school system and what
[1:27:45] they're uh propagating to our young
[1:27:47] people in kindergarden and what they're
[1:27:48] doing some of the curriculums in fifth
[1:27:50] grade and let me tell you it's it's

[1:27:56] young people but we find notice it
[1:27:57] happens in the kids first so he's going
[1:28:00] along these lines and he's talking about

[1:28:09] children today and he's calling for
[1:28:11] America for a Revival in America for a
[1:28:13] Great Awakening in America and he says
[1:28:15] and I believe America's going to come to
[1:28:17] herself she's DED but she's going to
[1:28:18] revive again and I said oh Jimmy you
[1:28:20] don't know the truth God sent a prophet
[1:28:23] in this hour and he indicted this
[1:28:25] generation America will not revive
[1:28:28] America will go down in destruction
[1:28:30] because why cuz we have received the
[1:28:32] Vindicated message and he says I indict
[1:28:35] this generation for what crucifying the
[1:28:37] word calling it fanaticism said don't go

[1:30:21] modern achievements of a super raise and
[1:30:23] so forth that we're living in is only
[1:30:25] the sign of gross darkness in the
[1:30:28] spiritual realm so I'm trying to share
[1:30:31] some of these things so you can see the
[1:30:32] hour in which we're living it's an hour
[1:30:35] of fulfillment but it's
[1:30:38] under it's under the darkness the cover
[1:30:40] of darkness in which these things take
[1:30:43] place he said people will get to a place
[1:30:46] they will fall away gross Darkness will
[1:30:48] cover the earth when spiritual Darkness
[1:30:49] gets upon the Earth it's time for the
[1:30:51] enemy to attack and he says at that

[1:31:39] Wrath of the enemy has poured out upon
[1:31:40] the people cuz he's going to Smite the
[1:31:43] remnant of the Bride he's going to Smite
[1:31:44] the remnant of the
[1:31:48] church as it was in the days of Sodom so

[1:32:09] right because you are the light of this
[1:32:11] hour God has sent you a message notice

[1:32:24] writings on the wall on the streets in
[1:32:25] the skies everywhere the end is
[1:32:28] here I remember when I was a kid man

[1:32:44] end time man I shook everywhere I knew I
[1:32:46] had body
[1:32:47] parts I was scared that Lord don't let
[1:32:50] me go look I prayed every night and I
[1:32:52] sinned every day
[1:32:55] it was a bad fix I'd sin every day every
[1:32:59] night go to bed praying Lord please

[1:33:02] day give me one another time give me
[1:33:03] another oh but Hallelujah God saw my
[1:33:06] name on the book he didn't let me keep
[1:33:08] going that way but finally he let the
[1:33:10] message of the Hour come across my path
[1:33:12] on this saying that that predestinated
[1:33:14] seat no matter how far you go no matter
[1:33:17] what you did it's going to come to that
[1:33:20] life W Hallelujah church and now say now
[1:33:24] when I hear about the end time I don't
[1:33:26] shake R and roll but I throw on my hand
[1:33:28] say yes Lord come Lord Jesus this could
[1:33:30] be the moment this could be the day I'm
[1:33:33] waiting I'm ready for you
[1:33:35] coming it doesn't scare me anymore
[1:33:37] brother hell it excites me cuz now I can
[1:33:40] see that I've made preparation my name
[1:33:43] is on the book ain't no devil ain't no
[1:33:46] sin ain't no unbelief can take it away
[1:33:48] from there
[1:33:56] he says then when we see the fearful
[1:33:58] sights coming
[1:34:00] earthquakes tidle ways Falling Away
[1:34:02] gross Darkness hey High minded L was of
[1:34:05] pleasure now that's all for the world
[1:34:08] that's what the world is pointed to but
[1:34:10] the church has another sign yes that
[1:34:13] blessed called out
[1:34:15] sign he promised that there would be a
[1:34:17] latter of rain in the church the church
[1:34:19] spiritual in the last days he would pour
[1:34:21] out both former and lateral rain
[1:34:23] remember the the former rain come first
[1:34:25] then the latter second rain he says both
[1:34:28] former and latter in the same season he
[1:34:31] promised it notice what is the former
[1:34:33] Reign it's the teaching Reign and the
[1:34:35] latter Reign is the Harvest rign it's
[1:34:37] the spirit that comes upon what's been
[1:34:39] taught and it produces the
[1:34:42] crop and what we've received in our day
[1:34:45] church is both former and lat rain
[1:34:48] message we've been taught thoroughly by
[1:34:50] a prophet and then after the prophet
[1:34:52] leaves the scene the SP of God comes
[1:34:54] back on the same word that's been taught
[1:34:57] and produces the crop cuz it shows it's
[1:35:00] not tied to a man but it's always about
[1:35:04] Christ and I here to tell you this day
[1:35:07] this message produces an end time
[1:35:10] bride and if the latter Reigns come and
[1:35:12] the former Reign's been been given out
[1:35:14] where are we
[1:35:16] at where are we at when the rain has
[1:35:19] come and the messenger gone it tells us
[1:35:22] we're living in the hour of fulf
[1:35:24] fillment Isaiah 16:2 Behold The Darkness
[1:35:27] shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness
[1:35:29] to people but the Lord shall arise upon
[1:35:32] thee hallelujah oh Hallelujah is Right
[1:35:35] notice in the midst of chaos there's
[1:35:37] going to be a people that the Lord
[1:35:39] himself Rises upon and the Bible says
[1:35:42] and notice and His glory shall be seen
[1:35:44] upon thee that word Glory there is his
[1:35:47] reputation yes sir he's staken his
[1:35:50] reputation on his word and on his people
[1:35:53] and not not only is it going to be in
[1:35:54] the books any longer but now his
[1:35:56] reputation is going to be manifested in
[1:35:59] a living bride in a living body and
[1:36:02] written Epistles read and known above
[1:36:05] all men that's right let me tell you we
[1:36:07] want it more than just being on the
[1:36:09] pages of of all these books and in the
[1:36:11] Bible we want to be written Epistles we
[1:36:13] want the word of God to be made manifest
[1:36:16] in our
[1:36:17] lives notice in the hour of gross
[1:36:19] Darkness God will have a people that
[1:36:22] will manifest him
[1:36:24] you believe that it has been
[1:36:27] prophesied that he will rise Upon A
[1:36:30] people so if there's got to be gross
[1:36:32] darkness and there's also got to be the
[1:36:33] Fulfillment of this prophecy but we're
[1:36:35] going to look a little bit let's go down
[1:36:36] a little bit further we're going to look
[1:36:37] at these things brother BR says now
[1:36:38] notice he never changes his pattern of
[1:36:41] work he prophesies what will happen then
[1:36:43] he sends somebody down and vindicates
[1:36:45] that and it goes over the head of
[1:36:47] millions because Darkness covers the
[1:36:48] earth at the time the people love
[1:36:51] Darkness better than they do light cuz
[1:36:53] Darkness has a lot of pleasure oh
[1:36:56] brother Jonathan you used to love
[1:36:58] Darkness don't tell us anything about it
[1:37:00] right now but no sir many of us we
[1:37:04] groped in
[1:37:06] darkness some of you didn't cut your
[1:37:08] your teeth on the message Pew you groped
[1:37:10] in darkness you did these things you
[1:37:11] enjoyed it it was
[1:37:13] pleasurable to the flesh but it
[1:37:16] tormented your spirit cuz something
[1:37:18] inside of you wanted to do right I enjoy
[1:37:21] going to the bars getting getting drunk
[1:37:24] dancing like a fool but every night I
[1:37:26] laid in bed I pray God please forgive me
[1:37:29] because there was something greater
[1:37:30] there was a crying out there was a deep
[1:37:32] calling and I didn't know how to supply
[1:37:34] that need for that deep but one day one
[1:37:38] day a voice came down and said it's time
[1:37:40] one day one day let me tell you it's all
[1:37:42] it takes is one day
[1:37:43] church one day in his presence one day
[1:37:46] in the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit
[1:37:47] Well the inspiration is striking that's
[1:37:49] all you need is one day one moment in
[1:37:51] the presence of the king to change your
[1:37:54] life for
[1:37:55] eternity so we find he never changes his
[1:37:58] pattern Isaiah prophesied of our day
[1:38:01] that the world will be groping in
[1:38:04] darkness notice we're in political chaos
[1:38:07] right here true we're living in a woke
[1:38:11] generation if you don't know what woke
[1:38:13] generation means go look it
[1:38:16] up I mean everything is woke
[1:38:20] up we're living in there's Wars there's
[1:38:22] rumors of Wars not only in America but
[1:38:26] around the world and what did God do in
[1:38:28] this time God sent a
[1:38:30] prophet God sent a message to not only
[1:38:32] turn our hearts but to prepare us to
[1:38:34] tell us for to forew warn us of what's
[1:38:37] about to be poured out amen and we
[1:38:40] understand you know this brother B
[1:38:42] begins to bring the prediction and this
[1:38:43] is not in my notes I'm just going to
[1:38:44] paraphrase this but he predicts that he
[1:38:46] doesn't see it lasting Beyond
[1:38:49] 1977 now many of us as preachers and M
[1:38:52] Believers we claim that because he tells
[1:38:54] us that he makes the prediction but we
[1:38:56] look at it and we take from Isaiah here
[1:38:58] 60 and we begin to think you know what
[1:38:59] it's so dark even the prophetic lens
[1:39:02] couldn't Pierce that veil of darkness
[1:39:03] and he couldn't see past that so I say
[1:39:05] if we're that far beyond that many years
[1:39:08] Beyond
[1:39:10] 1977 just how dark are we now in
[1:39:15] 2024 that even his Prophet eyes eagle
[1:39:18] eyes couldn't Pierce that Darkness what
[1:39:21] kind of state are we living in as human
[1:39:24] today but notice he like an eagle rose
[1:39:27] up and he caught the
[1:39:29] inspiration so Isaiah's prophecy wasn't
[1:39:32] his prophecy it wasn't brother bram's
[1:39:33] Revelation The Book of Revelations
[1:39:35] wasn't John's prophecy but it was God's
[1:39:37] prophecy it was God telling John what's
[1:39:40] about to be poured out in the end time
[1:39:42] but God sends you a prophet God sends
[1:39:44] you a message not with his own
[1:39:46] understanding not with his own ideas but
[1:39:48] he raises up in that spiritual realm and
[1:39:50] he grabs that understanding then becomes
[1:39:52] down here and begins to tell us notice
[1:39:54] he begins to tell us what's happening in
[1:39:56] this hour so we're going to kind of look
[1:39:58] at some of this now if y'all don't mind
[1:40:00] we're going to go there but look before
[1:40:02] we look at this let's look in Luke
[1:40:08] 21-25 that clock needs to turn backwards
[1:40:11] mercy no wonder brother Tim can preach
[1:40:14] two hours when you teaching it feels
[1:40:16] good notice Luke 21:25 and there shall
[1:40:19] be signs in the Sun and in the moon and
[1:40:21] in the stars and upon the Earth
[1:40:22] distressed upon on nations with per
[1:40:24] perplexity in the sea and the waves
[1:40:26] roaring men's Hearts failing them for
[1:40:28] fear and for looking at those things
[1:40:30] which are coming on the earth for the
[1:40:32] powers of Heaven shall be shaken and
[1:40:34] then notice and then shall they see the
[1:40:36] son of man coming in a cloud with power
[1:40:38] and great glory and when these things
[1:40:40] begin to come to pass then look up and
[1:40:42] lift up your heads for your Redemption
[1:40:45] draweth nigh so Jesus is telling them
[1:40:48] that when you begin to see these things
[1:40:50] come to pass don't be fearful don't be
[1:40:52] worried just look up what is he saying
[1:40:55] look away from the chaos look away from
[1:40:57] the corruption look away from the civil
[1:40:59] unrest look away and look up cuz your
[1:41:02] Redemption begins to draw n and if you
[1:41:04] can have the spiritual eyesight to see
[1:41:06] what's coming the hour in which we're
[1:41:08] living in that modern events are being
[1:41:10] made clear by prophecy it's just telling
[1:41:12] you again look up Church look up little
[1:41:15] bride I'm coming I'm on my way I'm going
[1:41:17] to Rapture you and change your body look
[1:41:19] up cuz Final Redemption the full
[1:41:21] adoption is at hand amen
[1:41:25] hallelujah brother said now how can a
[1:41:28] messenger sent from God just believe
[1:41:29] some of the
[1:41:31] scriptures and not all the word and not
[1:41:33] part of it a true prophet of God will
[1:41:36] proclaim the word in the last days
[1:41:38] denominations will hate him he will pull
[1:41:40] no punches on him he will be like it was
[1:41:42] at the first coming of Christ you
[1:41:44] Generation of
[1:41:46] Vipers but the
[1:41:49] predestinated the predestinated will
[1:41:51] hear and will make make ready for the
[1:41:54] countdown oh Hallelujah the Royal seed
[1:41:59] regardless for he was
[1:42:01] predestinated the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:42:04] brother says in the spoken word is the
[1:42:05] Original Seed the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:42:08] will appear at God's appointed time amen
[1:42:11] notice remember hca's Vision the vision
[1:42:14] is for an appointed
[1:42:16] time and though it tar wait for it it
[1:42:19] will speak and will not tar
[1:42:23] he says which is the time now for to see
[1:42:26] it he will be correctly dedicated to the
[1:42:28] word as they've always been indicated by
[1:42:31] God's word and Vindicated God will
[1:42:33] vindicate what he preaches to be the
[1:42:34] truth and he did as Elijah for it is
[1:42:37] Elijah coming making ready for the Mount
[1:42:39] Zion Rapture Jesus said in the last days
[1:42:42] it would be like like lot's time he's
[1:42:44] preaching his preaching will be the
[1:42:46] spirit and strength line of God's word
[1:42:48] because so much of God's truth many will
[1:42:51] misunderstand this true Messenger he
[1:42:53] goes I got to wrot here prophecy p r o p
[1:42:56] he e c y prophecy because look so much
[1:42:59] has been called God's truth by fakers
[1:43:02] and many true ministers will
[1:43:04] misunderstand that
[1:43:06] message but as a first Forerunner came
[1:43:09] in the wilderness Behold the Lamb the
[1:43:10] second Forerunner comes Behold the Lamb
[1:43:13] of God what's he said he said he's
[1:43:14] pointing you to a word born
[1:43:17] bride now there will be such brother
[1:43:20] says there will be such denominational a
[1:43:22] denom inational Gathering pretty soon so
[1:43:26] now we're going to get into some of the
[1:43:27] prophecies or some of the Mysteries some
[1:43:28] of the things that we're going to
[1:43:30] finalize the rest of our message on
[1:43:31] today and I may hold you about another
[1:43:33] four hours is that okay that's perfect
[1:43:36] okay good but we notice now what we're
[1:43:39] about to go into and what we're about to
[1:43:40] see this doesn't happen in full
[1:43:44] sunlight but this begins to take place
[1:43:47] under the cover of Darkness because now
[1:43:50] Christ has been rejected the message is
[1:43:53] has been rejected and notice that's back
[1:43:55] in
[1:43:56] 1960 so now we're here in 2024 we're
[1:43:59] some 50ish 60 years from that moment of
[1:44:02] the indictment where they rejected the
[1:44:04] word rejected the message and it's only
[1:44:07] man has only grow further and further
[1:44:08] and further into
[1:44:10] darkness and now we begin to see even
[1:44:13] now even as it's being played out on the
[1:44:15] political sides of things we see the
[1:44:17] hour in which we're living in so notice
[1:44:20] he says there will be such a
[1:44:21] denominational gall pretty soon it will
[1:44:24] be terrific they will bring themselves
[1:44:28] together into this Federation of
[1:44:30] churches that's right see it's at the
[1:44:33] time that Jesus will appear he will show
[1:44:35] which is bride and which is not and
[1:44:37] remember Christian friends I'm a man I
[1:44:39] make mistakes but God being God he
[1:44:41] cannot make a mistake all the words
[1:44:44] that's been written must be fulfilled
[1:44:47] Jesus said
[1:44:48] so so we look here in the way of a true
[1:44:51] Propet he says look what we're trying to
[1:44:53] do everything took place in the Dark Age
[1:44:56] he says unite the church and state
[1:44:58] together this is in 1963 they're trying
[1:45:01] to unite the church and state together
[1:45:04] he said look at the union the World
[1:45:06] Council of churches all the churches
[1:45:09] going into this world Council of
[1:45:10] churches they think this is Oneness of
[1:45:13] god notice they think this is the
[1:45:14] Oneness of God because all the Churches
[1:45:17] United Brethren men of the fundamental
[1:45:19] churches go into great one big great
[1:45:21] organization but that that's because the
[1:45:23] lacking of knowing the word of God
[1:45:26] because they rejected Christ they
[1:45:28] rejected the prophet they rejected the
[1:45:31] message now because of that now they
[1:45:34] accept this we're going into one great
[1:45:36] big organization we're all one
[1:45:42] bism he says notice now the prophets
[1:45:44] spoke that this thing would take place
[1:45:46] they' make an image unto the Beast and
[1:45:49] it would have power to speak so one of
[1:45:52] the s signs of gross
[1:45:54] darkness is the rejecting of Christ and
[1:45:58] it is the formulation or the uniting of
[1:46:01] church and state the uniting takes place
[1:46:04] under gross darkness in the hour of
[1:46:07] Darkness because man has rejected their
[1:46:09] messenger churches uniting together in
[1:46:12] the world Council of churches under the
[1:46:14] leadership of man amen not under the
[1:46:17] leadership of the holy spirit so
[1:46:21] notice Revelations 13 let's turn there
[1:46:23] in verse
[1:46:27] 11 Revelations 13 and verse 11 we're
[1:46:30] going to
[1:46:31] look at what brother bam would call the
[1:46:35] boycott how many's familiar with the
[1:46:37] boycott all right there's a handful so
[1:46:39] we need to be refreshed on these things
[1:46:42] right come on smile on your face today
[1:46:44] it's Sunday God loves you I love you
[1:46:46] amen hopefully your wife and your spouse
[1:46:48] loves you well God this is it's great to
[1:46:50] be a Christian in this hour great to be
[1:46:52] a believer Hallelujah now he says now
[1:46:55] Revelations 13:11 and behold another
[1:46:57] Beast coming up out of the Earth had two
[1:47:00] horns like a lamb and it spake as a
[1:47:02] dragon and he exercises all the power of
[1:47:06] the first Beast before him and he causes
[1:47:08] the Earth and them which dwell therein
[1:47:10] to worship the first Beast whose deadly
[1:47:13] wound was
[1:47:14] healed and he doeth great wonders so
[1:47:17] that he maketh Fire come down from
[1:47:18] heaven on the earth in the sight of men
[1:47:20] he deceiveth them that dwell on the
[1:47:22] Earth by the means of those Miracles
[1:47:24] which he had power to do in the sight of
[1:47:26] the Beast saying to them that dwell on
[1:47:28] the earth that they which should make an
[1:47:31] image to the Beast which had the wound
[1:47:33] By The Sword and did live and he had
[1:47:35] power to give life unto the image of the
[1:47:37] Beast and that the image of the Beast
[1:47:39] should both speak and cause that as many
[1:47:41] as would not worship the image of the
[1:47:43] Beast should be killed and he callused
[1:47:46] all both small and great rich and poor
[1:47:48] free and bomb to receive a mark in their
[1:47:51] right hand and in their for foreheads
[1:47:54] and that no man might bu ourselves save
[1:47:56] he that which had the Mark or the name
[1:47:58] of the Beast or the number of his name
[1:48:01] and here is the wisdom let him that hath
[1:48:03] understanding count the number of the
[1:48:05] Beast for it is the number of man and
[1:48:07] his number is 6003 score and
[1:48:11] six now I'll tell
[1:48:14] you when I was a kid I didn't go looking
[1:48:17] in this
[1:48:19] chapter Man mark of the beast what and
[1:48:22] some of you today are still wondering
[1:48:24] what's the mark of the
[1:48:25] beast H they going to put a chip in my
[1:48:28] my wrist they going to put a chip you
[1:48:30] know you got people today they got chips
[1:48:32] in their wrist I mean we can chip a dog
[1:48:34] I ain't no dog that's right but the mark
[1:48:37] of the beast ain't a chip in the hand
[1:48:40] and we're going to go into these things
[1:48:41] but brother Bram GL clearly tells
[1:48:43] because this chapter shows the power of
[1:48:46] the Roman Catholic
[1:48:48] church so I want you to place these
[1:48:50] things in order why are we here how do
[1:48:52] we get to Revelations 13 because they
[1:48:54] rejected the
[1:48:56] word and now we're in darkness and these
[1:48:58] things begin to be
[1:49:00] uncovered they begin to be made manifest
[1:49:03] they begin to be done under the cover of
[1:49:05] the darkness amen he says now this is
[1:49:08] the power of the Roman Catholic church
[1:49:09] and what she will do through the
[1:49:13] organization remember this is the false
[1:49:15] bind let it in the name of the Lord it
[1:49:17] does so only in a li it's the head its
[1:49:20] headship is not the Lord but Satan it
[1:49:23] finally ends up completely identified
[1:49:25] with the Beast the riding on the
[1:49:28] Scarlet Beast distinctly shows her power
[1:49:31] notice her power is the god of force
[1:49:34] Satan and not of God the Lord Jesus
[1:49:36] Christ then he goes into in verse 17 if
[1:49:39] we look in verse 17 there it says that
[1:49:41] no man might buy or sell save he that
[1:49:44] had the mark and the N the name of the
[1:49:46] Beast or the number of his name and
[1:49:48] brother Bram says it emphatically shows
[1:49:50] that she will gain absolute control of
[1:49:53] Commerce of the
[1:49:55] Earth for no man can buy or sell apart
[1:49:58] from her this is born out of Revelations
[1:50:00] 18 veres 9-1 17 which shows her
[1:50:04] involvement with the Kings and princes
[1:50:06] and Merchants of all whom have to do
[1:50:08] with Rome and
[1:50:10] commerce so let's jump in Revelations 18
[1:50:12] and verse 9 we're not going to read all
[1:50:15] these verses I just want to jump and
[1:50:16] here hit a few of them it says and the
[1:50:18] kings of the earth who have committed
[1:50:20] fornication
[1:50:23] and live deliciously with her shall
[1:50:26] bewell her and lament for her when they
[1:50:28] shall see the smoke of her burning so we
[1:50:31] understand that these Kings these
[1:50:32] Merchants have committed fornication
[1:50:35] they have laid with her in her bed of
[1:50:38] Affliction and things of that nature
[1:50:39] look here in verse 15 and The Merchant
[1:50:42] of these things if you go back before
[1:50:44] verses between verses 14 and 10 you
[1:50:47] begin to find all these merchants of
[1:50:49] spices and gold and all these different
[1:50:50] things and he says now the merch of
[1:50:53] these things which were made Rich by her
[1:50:55] shall stand AAR off for the fear of her
[1:50:58] torment weeping and
[1:51:02] wailing and brother Ram goes into the th
[1:51:05] tyan Church age and he says Revelations
[1:51:07] 13 and verse4 they made an image unto
[1:51:10] the Beast and I guess you're all reading
[1:51:11] that if you haven't why he goes we'll
[1:51:13] turn right back and read it he deceived
[1:51:16] them that dwell on the Earth by the
[1:51:18] means of those Miracles which he had
[1:51:20] power to do in the sight of the Beast he
[1:51:21] said that
[1:51:23] that's the confederation of the church
[1:51:25] so the image of the Beast is the
[1:51:28] confederation of the
[1:51:30] church to do it in the sight of the
[1:51:32] Beast saying unto them that dwell upon
[1:51:34] the Earth that they should make an image
[1:51:36] unto the Beast which had a deadly wound
[1:51:38] which is paganism was a wound by a sword
[1:51:41] and did live through papacy Pagan Rome
[1:51:43] to Papa Rome he says when Pagan Rome
[1:51:46] become Pap roome it never ceased the
[1:51:49] system of romanism ceased when a new
[1:51:51] king come he set up new order but when
[1:51:54] they come into Pagan Rome become Papa
[1:51:56] Rome through the Catholic Church through
[1:51:57] papalism it never ceases one Pope dies
[1:52:00] they set up another Pope and set up
[1:52:02] another Pope and keep setting up another
[1:52:04] Pope he said the Beast which was and is
[1:52:06] and yet shall come he said it shall go
[1:52:08] into predition he said that's thus saith
[1:52:11] the Holy Spirit through the scriptures
[1:52:14] they never
[1:52:15] cease so Rome had a religious system who
[1:52:19] deadly wound was healed that's right or
[1:52:22] the the deadly wound killed him in his
[1:52:24] head but he was revived again from Pagan
[1:52:27] Rome to Papa Rome and now they're to
[1:52:29] make an image to it out of the Beast
[1:52:32] that comes up out of Revelations 13 He
[1:52:34] said did you ever notice the nation is
[1:52:36] numbered or this nation is number
[1:52:39] 13 don't say he says now I know it's
[1:52:42] strange though it it would happen
[1:52:43] mathematically he says just exactly
[1:52:45] order with the scripture it's found in
[1:52:48] the 13th chapter of Revelation this
[1:52:50] nation all the beasts come up out of the
[1:52:51] water which is thickness and multitudes
[1:52:54] of people he says but this little beast
[1:52:56] come up out of the Earth where where
[1:52:58] there was no people yet he was a lamb
[1:53:00] freedom of religion then he spake like a
[1:53:02] dragon and United himself with the power
[1:53:05] and done all that the dragon did before
[1:53:07] him exactly just got to be that way no
[1:53:10] other way of getting around it and in
[1:53:12] verse 15 we find he gave power to give
[1:53:16] life unto the Beast or to the image of
[1:53:18] the Beast that the image of the Beast
[1:53:20] should both speak and cause as many that
[1:53:22] would not worship the image that they
[1:53:24] should be killed and brother bam says in
[1:53:26] the 10 virgins he said the image of the
[1:53:28] Beast is the Protestant denomination not
[1:53:31] the
[1:53:33] Catholic he said this is America he's
[1:53:35] speaking of here because chapter 13 is
[1:53:37] America the Beast that comes up out he
[1:53:39] says that all the Beast come up out of
[1:53:41] water which means thickness and
[1:53:42] multitudes of people but this Beast here
[1:53:44] comes up like a lamb out of the ground
[1:53:47] where there was no people it had two
[1:53:48] horns then it spoke like a dragon and
[1:53:50] they had an image of the Beast that was
[1:53:52] like in Europe and it made it he said it
[1:53:54] made this over here in the image it said
[1:53:57] a uniting of churches together and
[1:53:59] making this Protestant fellowship and
[1:54:01] then they forced all the other churches
[1:54:03] they couldn't even buy or sell anything
[1:54:05] else without they first become an image
[1:54:07] for the
[1:54:10] Beast all right we'll keep going he says
[1:54:13] we tried to make everybody become
[1:54:16] Lutheran and they couldn't do it we
[1:54:18] tried to make them all become Baptists
[1:54:20] and we couldn't do it all become method
[1:54:22] is all Pentecostal and they couldn't do
[1:54:24] it so in order to do this the time is so
[1:54:27] short they formed a
[1:54:30] councel a head an image to the beast
[1:54:33] that's exactly what they've done and
[1:54:35] what is it the crucifixion of the word
[1:54:37] again is at hand so now we we're seeing
[1:54:41] how it ties in how we get to this point
[1:54:44] because they crucified the word of God
[1:54:47] aresh and it's done under Darkness now
[1:54:50] he says he says so in the message what
[1:54:52] shall I do what Jesus called Christ what
[1:54:54] is this what is this system it's a
[1:54:56] satellite to
[1:54:58] Rome did the Bible say would be that way
[1:55:01] yes sir Revelation 17 they saw Rome rise
[1:55:03] up itself in an ecclesiastical system of
[1:55:06] a woman a woman or church is always
[1:55:09] represented by a woman so in Revelations
[1:55:12] 13:14 we learn that the Beast spreads
[1:55:15] his influence through the image which
[1:55:17] was built for him the image that is made
[1:55:20] is a worldwide ecumenical Council am
[1:55:24] where in all the organized churches will
[1:55:26] get together with the Roman Catholics
[1:55:28] they are doing it even now amen this is
[1:55:32] in the church age this is in the tharan
[1:55:34] church age it is quite possibly this
[1:55:36] Union will come in order to stop the
[1:55:38] power of Communism now maybe they
[1:55:41] formulated to stop communism but that's
[1:55:44] not their full intent we're going to get
[1:55:47] into the full intent but notice since
[1:55:49] communism like Nebuchadnezzar had been
[1:55:51] raised up to burn the flesh of the
[1:55:52] Harlot Rome will be overcome and
[1:55:54] destroyed take note that everywhere the
[1:55:56] Roman Church went communism followed it
[1:55:58] is it has to be that way let me warn you
[1:56:01] now don't think communism is your only
[1:56:03] enemy no sir it's the Catholic
[1:56:06] Church Revelations 13 and verse 16 he
[1:56:09] Calles all both small and great and poor
[1:56:13] and free and bond to receive the mark
[1:56:16] that's in the right hand or in their
[1:56:19] foreheads and if you don't have this
[1:56:21] Mark then you can't buy you can't sell
[1:56:25] say that you have the Mark or the name
[1:56:27] of the Beast or the number of his name
[1:56:31] so we got a few things in the scripture
[1:56:32] brother B says must be fulfilled and
[1:56:34] this is one of those things this is the
[1:56:36] boycott to
[1:56:37] come now this just couldn't happen in
[1:56:41] 1960 it couldn't happen when America was
[1:56:44] flourishing under the healing Revival
[1:56:47] and the word of God was being manifested
[1:56:49] and people were inspired at the time to
[1:56:51] serve the Lord Lord but now since they
[1:56:53] rejected it it all begins to happen
[1:56:56] under the cover of Darkness he says now
[1:56:58] notice but before this boycott can come
[1:57:01] of the marking of the Beast so the
[1:57:04] boycott you can't buy or
[1:57:07] sell comes and he calls a boycott is the
[1:57:10] marking of the Beast there has to be a
[1:57:13] seed sewed for God to take the church
[1:57:14] out of
[1:57:16] it he says now they asked brother bamman
[1:57:18] question and answers and they said is it
[1:57:20] NRA he said no that's not the mark of
[1:57:22] the beast certainly not it's a religious
[1:57:25] boycott so the boycott is a religious
[1:57:28] boycott or the mark of the beast is a
[1:57:29] religious boycott he says now brother BR
[1:57:33] he says speak on the mark of the beast
[1:57:34] don't you believe that they'll tattoo a
[1:57:36] number on your head or tattoo something
[1:57:38] on your
[1:57:39] hand he says no sir don't you never look
[1:57:41] for that it'll be a boycott certainly no
[1:57:45] man can buy our sell unless he he
[1:57:47] belongs to the confederation of churches
[1:57:49] that's true that'll come like a union
[1:57:51] union unionizing the thing bringing it
[1:57:53] down unionized religion mark my word it
[1:57:57] ain't far
[1:57:58] off and you'll see it just he says she's
[1:58:02] just around the
[1:58:04] corner so we're talking about this has
[1:58:07] been preached in
[1:58:08] 1954 so now as a prophet he's caught up
[1:58:11] and he's seeing these things he's
[1:58:13] forewarning us he's telling us of the
[1:58:15] Covenant he's begin to go back into
[1:58:18] Daniel and see that the Covenant that
[1:58:19] the prince makes we're going to go into
[1:58:22] some of that this morning he said notice
[1:58:24] here this is in the exposition of the
[1:58:26] church ages the false Church groups will
[1:58:29] come together in a world Council of
[1:58:31] churches This World Council of churches
[1:58:34] is the image erected to the beast that's
[1:58:37] right so don't get scared don't get
[1:58:39] fearful we're not in that image and
[1:58:42] we're not in the confederation of
[1:58:44] churches he says now remember it was
[1:58:47] Imperial Pagan Rome that fell by the
[1:58:50] sword but she was healed of her
[1:58:52] Deathstroke when she joined the nominal
[1:58:55] Church Christian Church of Rome and
[1:58:57] Incorporated paganism with Christianity
[1:59:00] amen thereby became the Holy Roman
[1:59:04] Empire which was to endure until Jesus
[1:59:07] came and destroy him but Rome is not
[1:59:08] going at it alone her daughters are
[1:59:11] right with her and she will take over
[1:59:13] absolute Authority by the World Council
[1:59:15] of churches this may seem far-fetched to
[1:59:19] some but actually it's very plain for
[1:59:21] all that see because now right now the
[1:59:23] churches are controlling politics
[1:59:27] right so now he preaches this this is in
[1:59:30] the church age so now he's going to show
[1:59:32] us where only a prophet can pick these
[1:59:35] things out and place Us in time of how
[1:59:37] these things are happening and why they
[1:59:39] happen and how they happen and he says
[1:59:41] it's happening right now because the
[1:59:42] churches are controlling the politics do
[1:59:45] you think your vote
[1:59:48] counts he said this ecumenical move will
[1:59:51] end end up with Rome at the head even
[1:59:54] though the people did not Envision it
[1:59:56] that
[1:59:57] way this is so
[1:59:59] because in Revelation 17 and verse3 it
[2:00:03] states that the mystery Babylon is
[2:00:05] Seated on the Beast she's controlling
[2:00:07] the last or the fourth Empire this Roman
[2:00:09] Church is doing that with the word the
[2:00:11] World Church system under her Rome will
[2:00:14] be controlling and this image the church
[2:00:16] system will be obedient to Rome because
[2:00:19] Rome controls the gold of the world
[2:00:22] amen so we're going to look at the mark
[2:00:24] of the beast and so we have an
[2:00:26] understanding some of you young people
[2:00:27] you may want to write this down so you
[2:00:29] don't have to be worried about getting a
[2:00:30] tattoo in your hand in your forehead he
[2:00:32] says thus he said the people have
[2:00:34] belonged to the World
[2:00:36] Church are to be at the mercy of the
[2:00:38] elements for they cannot buy or sell
[2:00:40] without the mark of the beast in the
[2:00:41] hand or the head now this Mark in the
[2:00:43] head means that you will have to take
[2:00:45] the doctrine of the World Church system
[2:00:47] which is the trinitarian
[2:00:50] system father son holy
[2:00:52] Ghost and the mark in the hand which
[2:00:55] means to do the will of the World Church
[2:00:59] now not who's that the head of the World
[2:01:01] Church wrome the
[2:01:04] Catholic okay we're good there he says
[2:01:07] with this great power of the church
[2:01:09] system will persecute the true bride the
[2:01:11] image will try to keep the bride from
[2:01:13] preaching and teaching Etc her ministers
[2:01:16] will be forbidden to give comfort and
[2:01:18] Truth to the people who need it but
[2:01:20] before the Antichrist in person and
[2:01:22] takes over the complete World System of
[2:01:24] churches the true church will be taken
[2:01:26] away from this world to be with the Lord
[2:01:29] God will catch away his bride for the
[2:01:31] great marriage supper of the
[2:01:33] Lamb so we understand that that prophecy
[2:01:36] has to be fulfilled but at the same time
[2:01:39] that that's taking place the bride will
[2:01:41] already be lifted off here will already
[2:01:44] be sitting at a Mary supper of the Lamb
[2:01:47] we don't have anything to fear church
[2:01:49] but I want you to see how these things
[2:01:51] begin to to manifest they manifest under
[2:01:54] the cover of
[2:01:56] Darkness we find here in 2 Thessalonians
[2:01:58] 2 the Bible says let no man deceive you
[2:02:01] by any means for that day shall not come
[2:02:04] except there come a falling away first
[2:02:06] that the man of sin be revealed the son
[2:02:08] of predition who opposes and exalts
[2:02:11] himself above all that is called God or
[2:02:14] that is worshiped so that he as God sth
[2:02:16] in the temple of God showing himself
[2:02:19] that he is God drop down to verse 7 for
[2:02:22] the mystery of iniquity doeth already
[2:02:24] work only he who now lth will let until
[2:02:27] he be taken out of the way and then
[2:02:30] shall that Wicked one be revealed whom
[2:02:32] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[2:02:34] of his mouth and shall destroy with the
[2:02:35] brightness of his coming even him whose
[2:02:38] coming is after the working of Satan
[2:02:40] with all power signs and lying wonders
[2:02:43] but the mystery of iniquity doeth
[2:02:45] already work only he who now L us will
[2:02:48] let until he be taken out away when the
[2:02:50] bride is taken up
[2:02:53] then that Wicked one will be thoroughly
[2:02:56] revealed that's right but we don't have
[2:02:58] to
[2:03:00] worry we that got the Holy Ghost let me
[2:03:04] say you better take inventory if you
[2:03:06] don't you that don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:03:08] you don't have the Assurance of the
[2:03:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost not just on
[2:03:11] your flesh not just jumping and shouting
[2:03:13] and screaming and jumping and saying
[2:03:15] Amen to the word I'm talking about
[2:03:16] having the the token life on the inside
[2:03:19] of you you better make sure you got it
[2:03:21] so you can escape the wrath that's
[2:03:23] coming this ain't no time to be playing
[2:03:25] church and just believing God sent a
[2:03:28] prophet you better have that messenger
[2:03:30] that life that token on the
[2:03:35] inside notice here he says now here is
[2:03:37] the wisdom in Revelations 13 and:
[2:03:40] 18 here is the wisdom let him that hath
[2:03:43] understanding count the number of the
[2:03:45] Beast for it is the number of man and
[2:03:48] his number is 63 scoring six that's
[2:03:52] right now you go over here in
[2:03:53] Revelations 13 it shows you that this
[2:03:55] man sits on a city he said the number of
[2:03:57] the beasts is
[2:03:59] 666 he goes WR that out in Latin the
[2:04:01] Roman alphabet 666 is vicarious fadia
[2:04:07] which is instead of the Son of God on
[2:04:09] the Pope's Throne so on the Pope's
[2:04:11] Throne it says instead of the Son of God
[2:04:14] vicarius Fila
[2:04:20] 666 takes a
[2:04:22] Prophet that's why we started this
[2:04:24] series off with the foundation of a
[2:04:26] prophet it takes a prophet to bring
[2:04:28] liken to these things so we can see
[2:04:30] exactly where the false prophet is
[2:04:34] exctly where the Antichrist is where the
[2:04:36] Beast is and where we are in time so he
[2:04:39] says here now and his chair has got a
[2:04:42] Triple Crown he says he opposes himself
[2:04:44] above all that's called God all The
[2:04:47] Godly men he's the holiest of all of
[2:04:49] them sets in the temple of God just show
[2:04:51] showing himself that he is God forgiving
[2:04:54] sins of the earth and so forth he goes
[2:04:56] you know for sure he says now I want you
[2:04:57] to notice as soon as the king he start
[2:05:00] talking about Nebuchadnezzar he said
[2:05:02] when the king saw the vision he erected
[2:05:04] an image into that vision and he had all
[2:05:06] man worshiped that image and he said the
[2:05:09] Gentile dispensation came in with image
[2:05:12] worship and he said it'll go out with
[2:05:14] image
[2:05:15] worship all right he says now I'm going
[2:05:17] to say something here it's not a
[2:05:18] Doctrine I'm just prophesying you know
[2:05:21] what happen it's going to come to place
[2:05:23] soon mark my word that all denominations
[2:05:26] are going to have to join The ecumenical
[2:05:29] council if they don't they can't have a
[2:05:31] support of the council they'll not be
[2:05:33] there'll be a boycott nobody can go to
[2:05:35] these churches or go to any churches
[2:05:37] unless you have the mark of your own
[2:05:39] church or mark from your your own church
[2:05:41] you cannot by or sell he goes you see
[2:05:44] it's just as it was so it's going to
[2:05:46] happen again a marking of the Beast so
[2:05:49] we see that Mark that the mark of the
[2:05:51] Beast isn't receiving a chip in the hand
[2:05:53] or in the head it's not having a number
[2:05:55] tattooed on you but it's belonging to
[2:05:57] the ecuminical
[2:05:58] council
[2:06:00] so and he says now this this takes
[2:06:03] place this takes place under the cover
[2:06:06] of Darkness so we find that it takes a
[2:06:08] prophet to come on the scene and to
[2:06:10] begin to reveal these great truths to us
[2:06:14] we believe that so let's look here what
[2:06:18] the Roman Catholic page says the website
[2:06:20] says in regard to the pope cuz you tell
[2:06:23] somebody that the pope is the Antichrist
[2:06:26] I'm like there ain't no way there ain't
[2:06:28] no way he's the most religious man in
[2:06:31] all the world look at he's an old
[2:06:33] grandpa but Papa Supremacy is the
[2:06:36] doctrine of the Catholic church that the
[2:06:38] pope by reasoning of his office as viker
[2:06:41] of
[2:06:42] Christ instead of Christ viker of Christ
[2:06:46] the visible source and foundation of the
[2:06:49] unity both of the Bishops and the whole
[2:06:51] compan of faithful as a pastor of the
[2:06:54] entire Catholic church has full Supreme
[2:06:57] and Universal power over the whole
[2:06:59] church power which he can always
[2:07:01] exercise unhindered the pope enjoys by
[2:07:05] Divine institution Supreme full
[2:07:08] immediate Universal Power in the cares
[2:07:11] of
[2:07:12] souls the pope stands in the place of
[2:07:15] Jesus himself as the viker of Christ on
[2:07:18] Earth he is the head of the Catholic
[2:07:21] Church and her nearly 1.3 billion
[2:07:24] Catholics and is responsible for the
[2:07:26] Salvation of all the souls throughout
[2:07:28] the entire world no one will consider
[2:07:31] this Pope NOS this no one will consider
[2:07:33] this Pope to be the son of
[2:07:36] predition I me he's got the souls of 1.3
[2:07:38] billion people in his hands he ain't no
[2:07:40] way he's a bad guy but a prophet comes
[2:07:43] and identifies who he
[2:07:45] is so let's look at this ecumenical
[2:07:48] counsel if we could just for a little
[2:07:49] bit this morning this phrase communal
[2:07:52] council is defined as a council of
[2:07:53] religious churches that is called
[2:07:55] periodically to ensure that they are
[2:07:57] abiding by a single set of doctrines
[2:08:00] it's headed up by the Roman Catholic
[2:08:05] Church the main purpose of the eunic
[2:08:07] council are to maintain a single set of
[2:08:10] doctrines for Christianity throughout
[2:08:11] the world and keep minority religious
[2:08:14] groups from breaking away from the large
[2:08:16] Christian body the meaning of ecumenical
[2:08:19] is a promotion of unity and agreement
[2:08:21] between the various churches that
[2:08:23] espouse Christianity but doesn't the
[2:08:25] Bible say how can two walk together
[2:08:26] unless they be agreed but now all these
[2:08:29] churches are walking together in
[2:08:31] agreement in the world Council thus the
[2:08:33] ecumental council are councils meant to
[2:08:36] resolve differences between various
[2:08:38] Christian denominations this reflects
[2:08:41] the belief of the Catholic church that
[2:08:43] the decisions of these councils were Val
[2:08:45] throughout the world thus The ecumenical
[2:08:47] council of churches is a council that
[2:08:49] represents all Christians throughout
[2:08:51] throughout the world and it's headed up
[2:08:54] by the Catholic
[2:08:55] church so in Jezebel
[2:08:58] religion Bel says now then one day after
[2:09:01] sin had took its toll God had brought
[2:09:03] his people to their knees Jezebel took
[2:09:05] every took over everything she wiped it
[2:09:08] all up she'll do it again that's thus
[2:09:10] sayith the Holy Bible she'll do it again
[2:09:12] she's right on the throne now behind the
[2:09:15] Figure Head see brother Brandon was
[2:09:17] making a reference to JFK being the
[2:09:19] first Catholic President but notice he
[2:09:21] was a Catholic President so he's saying
[2:09:23] Jezebel is now on the throne notice he's
[2:09:27] only Jeff K was only the figurehead of
[2:09:29] this then he goes and he says further
[2:09:32] down he says look now Israel got how
[2:09:34] they floated with the tide till finally
[2:09:36] Jezebel come look how America got and
[2:09:39] floated with the worldly tide until
[2:09:41] finally Jezebel took the throne now
[2:09:44] Jezebel actually wasn't on the throne of
[2:09:46] Egypt or Israel but she was the main
[2:09:49] head behind the throne and the Catholic
[2:09:51] hierarchy not on the is not on the
[2:09:53] throne of the United States of the
[2:09:55] United States but she's the system
[2:09:58] behind it because he's married to
[2:10:01] her and the Bible said in this country
[2:10:05] they'll make an image liken unto the
[2:10:07] Beast and brother BR talks about the
[2:10:09] pope he says notice he goes for the
[2:10:11] things now one thing is to unite the
[2:10:13] Protestant and the Catholic church
[2:10:14] together to an intellectual person that
[2:10:17] seems like that would be something to do
[2:10:19] right let's unite everybody together we
[2:10:20] need to just be be one great Christian
[2:10:22] body and you know we're going to
[2:10:23] overcome communism we're going to we're
[2:10:25] going to overcome the threat of
[2:10:26] muslimism and all these different other
[2:10:28] kind of uh beliefs out there in the land
[2:10:30] he says but notice to the Natural man
[2:10:32] the Antichrist is growing now through
[2:10:34] politics he's already got the White
[2:10:36] House in religion he's got all the
[2:10:39] people so scrupled up to actually they
[2:10:41] fall right for
[2:10:44] it and the denominational leaders
[2:10:46] practically every church that there is
[2:10:48] in the nation is already in the
[2:10:50] confederation of church
[2:10:51] rameses is growing they're all uniting
[2:10:54] together that's what they have and what
[2:10:57] he says and what does it what does it do
[2:10:59] he said it makes power the Beast just
[2:11:01] like the first
[2:11:03] one so JFK was the first Catholic
[2:11:07] President Joe Biden's the second
[2:11:09] Catholic
[2:11:11] President Catholics make up
[2:11:13] 29.8% of the members of
[2:11:16] Congress that's 158 members out of 531
[2:11:19] members of serving in our Congress today
[2:11:22] it's our Supreme Court six out of the
[2:11:25] nine justices are
[2:11:27] Catholic the largest percent of the
[2:11:31] Congress is Catholic notice Protestants
[2:11:33] make up or the largest percent is
[2:11:35] Protestants but they're divided up
[2:11:37] between so many different fractions or
[2:11:39] or different beliefs therefore that
[2:11:41] gives the Catholic Church the majority
[2:11:44] of Congress and gives them a unified
[2:11:46] voice to pass
[2:11:49] laws so how is this boy C
[2:11:53] coming she's controlling the
[2:11:58] politics but said now notice it'll be
[2:12:01] slick and slide until it would deceive
[2:12:03] the very elected if it was
[2:12:05] possible then he says in Daniel 9 and
[2:12:08] verse 27 let's go
[2:12:12] there 9 and 27 I'm going to do my best
[2:12:15] have you out of here by
[2:12:18] 1:30 Daniel 9:27 and he shall come
[2:12:21] confirmed a covenant with many for a
[2:12:23] week we're going to stop right there
[2:12:25] brother says I hope that the people are
[2:12:27] spiritual I have a horrible he goes I
[2:12:29] would have made a horrible mistake on
[2:12:31] this now I'm coming out of the first
[2:12:32] seal here so I think it's pertinent that
[2:12:34] we look at that it wasn't just a man's
[2:12:37] idea when he starts bringing these
[2:12:39] things down now we find and we give
[2:12:41] Credence to the Holy Spirit he says this
[2:12:43] is in the first seal I hope that the
[2:12:45] people are spiritual he goes I would
[2:12:47] have made a horrible mistake on that if
[2:12:49] I hadn't been at about 12:00 today when
[2:12:51] the Holy Spirit came in the room and
[2:12:53] corrected me on some things that I was
[2:12:54] writing down notice he was going to go
[2:12:57] from some old context but the Lord came
[2:12:59] down and begin to give him the
[2:13:01] understanding of the first seal which is
[2:13:03] the white horse rider who it is that was
[2:13:06] riding on that horse and what his
[2:13:07] intentions are so we're going to find
[2:13:10] that through the rest of this service he
[2:13:11] says now and after the three score in
[2:13:14] two weeks shall Messiah be cut off
[2:13:17] that's the three score in two weeks
[2:13:18] he'll be cut off out of the 70 weeks not
[2:13:21] for himself but for the people and the
[2:13:23] prince that's the hierarchy talking
[2:13:25] about the Church Catholic Church shall
[2:13:27] come and shall come and destroy the city
[2:13:29] the sanctuary the end thereof shall be
[2:13:31] with great flood and unto the end of the
[2:13:33] war desolations will be determined he
[2:13:35] goes after Christ was cut off from the
[2:13:37] earth in the three and a half years of
[2:13:39] his ministry and what destroyed the
[2:13:41] temple or who destroyed the temple
[2:13:44] Rome he said Titus the Roman general he
[2:13:47] destroyed the prince and when Jesus was
[2:13:50] born the red dragon in heaven stood at
[2:13:52] the woman to devour her child as soon as
[2:13:55] it was born is that right who tried to
[2:13:57] Devour the child
[2:13:59] Rome so we're trying to play some things
[2:14:01] for you he says there's the red dragon
[2:14:03] there's your prince here's your
[2:14:07] Beast so that notice we but we find in
[2:14:10] in Daniel
[2:14:12] 9:27 there's a covenant that is being
[2:14:15] made and we're going to look into this
[2:14:17] in the first seal brother man goes into
[2:14:19] it he says now I believe I preached this
[2:14:21] long long back he said but it'll happen
[2:14:23] to the United States on this money
[2:14:25] situation we are paying our debts on
[2:14:27] taxes that'll be paid 40 years from now
[2:14:30] that's how far we are
[2:14:33] behind I'm going to try to slow down
[2:14:35] here to bring this out thoroughly he
[2:14:37] says we are completely
[2:14:40] busted that's all what's the matter the
[2:14:42] gold is all house up the Jews hold the
[2:14:47] bonds it's going to be Rome
[2:14:51] now watch we know who owns the
[2:14:53] department stores Revelations 18-9 the
[2:14:56] kings of the
[2:14:58] Earth the Jews don't own the department
[2:15:00] stores but the kings of the Earth the
[2:15:02] merchants said we know who owns the
[2:15:05] department stores but Rome has the
[2:15:06] greatest part of the world of the world
[2:15:09] the rest of it the Jews have now watch
[2:15:12] this just listen this is how the Holy
[2:15:14] Spirit brought it to me this is in the
[2:15:16] first seal this is not brother brandham
[2:15:18] as a man now he's caught the inspiration
[2:15:21] to bring this to us he said he shall
[2:15:23] confirm the Covenant with the many for
[2:15:26] one week now watch he said in the midst
[2:15:28] of the week he shall cause the sacrifice
[2:15:31] of the obla to seize for the
[2:15:33] overspreading of abomination he shall
[2:15:35] make it desolate even unto the
[2:15:37] consummation that the time determined
[2:15:39] shall be poured out upon the desolate
[2:15:41] who goes oh watch what a shrewd thing he
[2:15:45] is he said he is here now we got our
[2:15:48] picture we know it's wrome he said
[2:15:51] excuse me we know he's the right horse
[2:15:53] rider we know that he went forth as a
[2:15:54] Doctrine then what was was Pagan Rome
[2:15:58] converted to Papa Ro and he's crowned he
[2:16:00] said but in the midst in the early days
[2:16:02] when Christ was preaching he said but he
[2:16:05] says now notice it's not in the early
[2:16:06] days when Christ was preaching but in
[2:16:08] the end time the last part of the week
[2:16:11] he says that's where we just took the 70
[2:16:12] weeks of Daniel and Christ was prophesy
[2:16:15] for three and 1/2 years and there the
[2:16:17] three and 1/2 years are yet to be
[2:16:18] determined and in this time the the
[2:16:21] prince in this time is to make a
[2:16:23] covenant with Daniel's people which is
[2:16:25] the Jews that's when the bride's taken
[2:16:27] out she won't see
[2:16:30] it come on
[2:16:32] Brian I know I'm talking to you about
[2:16:34] the darkness but I'm telling you you're
[2:16:35] not part of the
[2:16:38] darkness he says the last one and a half
[2:16:41] of Daniel's weeks this Prince makes a
[2:16:43] covenant with Rome makes a covenant with
[2:16:46] them no doubt for the wealth for the
[2:16:48] Catholic and the Jews hold the wealth of
[2:16:52] the world so why is the covenant made
[2:16:54] for the wealth of the
[2:16:59] world so let's just kind of look at the
[2:17:02] history of the relationship between Rome
[2:17:05] and Israel for a few minutes if we can
[2:17:08] the relationship between the Catholics
[2:17:09] and the Jews is marred by centuries of
[2:17:12] troubles including doctrinal pics
[2:17:14] Crusade era massacres forc Exiles of the
[2:17:17] Jews notice there's been a hatred down
[2:17:21] through history of the romes and the
[2:17:24] Jews I mean a despising of one another
[2:17:27] Jewish Roman tensions resulted in
[2:17:29] several Jewish Roman wars between the
[2:17:31] years of 66 and 135 CE which resulted in
[2:17:35] the destruction of Jerusalem and the
[2:17:37] second temple and the institution of the
[2:17:39] Jewish taxs in 70 BC I suppose he says
[2:17:43] Romans destroyed much of the temple in
[2:17:45] Jerusalem According to some accounts
[2:17:47] plunder the artifacts from the temple
[2:17:49] such as a manora and from 63 BC until
[2:17:52] the Jewish war of 66 Israel was under
[2:17:55] the roome was under Roman
[2:17:58] control but in
[2:18:02] 1965 I want you to see this in
[2:18:05] 1965 now your Prophet begins that's his
[2:18:08] last year of his life but in 1965 the
[2:18:12] Vatican moved to improve relationships
[2:18:15] with with Jews notice it did not
[2:18:18] recognize him as a formal state in 1948
[2:18:20] or 1949 it didn't even recognize him as
[2:18:23] a formal state in
[2:18:25] 1965 but it did in
[2:18:28] 1993 but it began to prove excuse me to
[2:18:31] improve
[2:18:34] the excuse me it began to improve the
[2:18:37] relations that it had in
[2:18:41] 1965 because the Jews hold the bonds
[2:18:45] they hold the other part of the world or
[2:18:48] the riches of the world in their hand so
[2:18:50] you see the Vatican now they're making
[2:18:52] the move I want you to see this they're
[2:18:54] making to move to position thems with
[2:18:58] good ties with the Jews so they can make
[2:19:00] this
[2:19:01] Covenant so in December 1993 the Vatican
[2:19:05] and Israel signed a diplomatic treaty
[2:19:08] how many of you knew
[2:19:10] that okay they signed a diplomatic
[2:19:13] treaty they exchang embassadors a few
[2:19:15] months later and the Vatican Israel
[2:19:18] agreement normalized relations between
[2:19:20] the two two Nations further it furthered
[2:19:23] a Jewish Catholic dialogue already
[2:19:25] underway and helped establish a path for
[2:19:28] regularizing the church's legal status
[2:19:30] in Israel notice the church's status in
[2:19:36] Israel so you see The Mastermind behind
[2:19:39] it all is the church the Vatican they're
[2:19:42] trying to improve the relations they're
[2:19:43] trying to position thems with an
[2:19:47] agreement come on church trying to show
[2:19:50] you where these things happen they don't
[2:19:51] happen in broad daylight but they happen
[2:19:54] under the cover of darkness and he says
[2:19:56] now overall the vatican's relationship
[2:19:58] with Israel is based on their
[2:20:00] international law and not theology
[2:20:03] that's right so it has nothing to do
[2:20:05] with religion at all international law
[2:20:10] so we see from this that the church is
[2:20:12] the one that's making the efforts to
[2:20:13] improve the relationship with Israel and
[2:20:16] there's an underlying reason for
[2:20:19] that and all seems Innocent but the
[2:20:22] great has a
[2:20:24] reason
[2:20:26] notice brother makes a statement he goes
[2:20:28] I got to go to the Vatican he says why
[2:20:30] you couldn't buy it with a hundred
[2:20:32] billion dollar the wealth of the world
[2:20:35] was found in her but he says but after
[2:20:38] the church is taken away Rome and the
[2:20:40] Jews will make a covenant one with
[2:20:42] another after the church is taken away
[2:20:46] we will not be
[2:20:49] there you have no reason to fear but you
[2:20:52] can start seeing them things starting to
[2:20:54] fall into place so because we can see
[2:20:57] these things starting to you know right
[2:20:59] now my family is putting a probably a
[2:21:01] 1500 piece puzzle
[2:21:04] together yeah some of you would Bri like
[2:21:06] yeah I just look over there it's like
[2:21:08] there's two pieces missing but they're
[2:21:10] putting this big puzzle together and
[2:21:12] it's all scattered out and you should
[2:21:14] see the excitement in the home when they
[2:21:16] put one little piece in one spot oh yeah
[2:21:19] because they know that the completion of
[2:21:22] that puzzle is getting closer to
[2:21:24] fulfillment each and every time they
[2:21:26] find the piece that's missing what am I
[2:21:28] telling you whoa come on believer come
[2:21:30] on bride when we see the pieces of the
[2:21:33] puzzle begin to fit into place we know
[2:21:36] that the puzzle is about to be finished
[2:21:39] we know let me tell you it ain't to
[2:21:40] scare you but now we can see the picture
[2:21:43] what's all been broke up over time
[2:21:45] what's all been little fragments and
[2:21:47] pieces is now coming into one Great
[2:21:50] Piece we can see the church in our
[2:21:52] system we can see The ecumenical council
[2:21:54] and we can see why the Israel and the
[2:21:57] Jews are trying to the churches trying
[2:21:59] to formulate a covenant with Israel
[2:22:01] because they want the wealth of the
[2:22:02] world but let me tell you this Pride
[2:22:04] won't be here I take come on somebody
[2:22:07] this prbe won't be here we're going to
[2:22:10] be gone we're going to leave this world
[2:22:11] behind because the puzzle is going to be
[2:22:13] put
[2:22:17] together there's been a prophecy not
[2:22:19] only concerning this but at that time
[2:22:21] let me tell you this little bride will
[2:22:23] not go through the tribulation
[2:22:26] period
[2:22:28] woo he says Rome and the Jews will make
[2:22:30] a covenant one with another the Bible
[2:22:32] said they would with the holy people and
[2:22:35] now notice they'll make it because why
[2:22:37] the nation is going to be
[2:22:40] busted he said this nation is going to
[2:22:42] be busted the rest of the world that's
[2:22:44] on the gold standard is
[2:22:47] busted he because if we're living off
[2:22:49] taxes do bills for 40 years now where
[2:22:52] are we at there's only one thing can
[2:22:55] happen that's to call in the currency
[2:22:57] and pay off the bonds and we can't do
[2:23:01] it to pay off the currency to call in
[2:23:05] the bonds who owns the bonds who owns
[2:23:08] the Securities the Jews own the bonds
[2:23:11] they own Wall Street don't you see how
[2:23:14] plays in they own the Jew the Jews on
[2:23:17] Wall Street and we can't pay off this
[2:23:19] debt but tell you they're going to call
[2:23:21] it in and the Roman Catholic Church is
[2:23:24] going to be the one that pays off the
[2:23:26] debt and enter into that Covenant oh but
[2:23:28] brother and sister we going to be out of
[2:23:30] here we're going to be
[2:23:33] gone how many knows what the national
[2:23:35] debt
[2:23:36] is I know $35 trillion do now some of
[2:23:40] you can't think that big that's a lot of
[2:23:44] zeros somebody said I can I don't know
[2:23:46] who said
[2:23:48] that notice the national day is the
[2:23:50] amount of money the federal government
[2:23:52] has borrowed to cover outstanding
[2:23:55] balance and expenses over time by
[2:23:57] selling bonds and
[2:23:59] securities and the
[2:24:01] Jews Wall Street they own it that's who
[2:24:06] we're in debt to church but there's got
[2:24:08] to be a time there's going to make a
[2:24:10] call on that debt and what we can't pay
[2:24:13] it but somebody's going to pay it notice
[2:24:17] here simply put we find here that the
[2:24:19] national debt is the accumulation of
[2:24:21] this borrowing Al with the associated
[2:24:23] interest owed to his investors who
[2:24:25] purchased these Securities so the
[2:24:27] federal government is experiencing
[2:24:29] reoccurring deficit which is common the
[2:24:32] national debt grows simply put the
[2:24:34] national debt is no different than a
[2:24:36] person using a credit card for purchases
[2:24:38] and not paying off the full balance each
[2:24:41] month you just pay the interest but yet
[2:24:44] it keeps growing and growing and growing
[2:24:46] and growing and growing notice the cost
[2:24:49] of the purchase exed see the amount paid
[2:24:51] off represents a deficit while
[2:24:53] accumulated deficits over time
[2:24:54] represents a person's overall debt the
[2:24:57] 35 trillion is roughly the economies of
[2:25:00] China India Germany Japan and the United
[2:25:03] Kingdom all combined
[2:25:05] together did you hear that the combined
[2:25:09] the combined debt 35 trillion is China's
[2:25:11] economy India's economy Germany's
[2:25:14] economy Japan's economy and the United
[2:25:16] Kingdom's economy all combined together
[2:25:19] that's two
[2:25:21] $266,000 per household or
[2:25:24] $104,000 per individual that lives in
[2:25:27] the United States how many of you got a
[2:25:28] small baby here this morning that baby
[2:25:31] owes $104,000 to the national
[2:25:34] debt didn't didn't pay nothing didn't
[2:25:37] buy nothing didn't look at nothing but
[2:25:39] owes
[2:25:41] $114,000 and they said now within 10
[2:25:44] years the federal government will spend
[2:25:45] more on interest payments than it
[2:25:47] traditionally has on research and
[2:25:48] development infrastructure education and
[2:25:51] we're spending $2 billion a day on
[2:25:53] interest payments without even touching
[2:25:55] the
[2:25:56] principal how we going to do this how we
[2:26:00] going to pay it
[2:26:01] off we hear about this national debt and
[2:26:04] this national debt and this national
[2:26:05] debt and we don't think anything about
[2:26:06] it but it plays right here into the
[2:26:08] prophecy it plays right here into the
[2:26:11] prophecy it has to
[2:26:15] grow he says now
[2:26:17] notice the rich merchants of the earth
[2:26:19] hold it and then there's only one thing
[2:26:21] to do the Catholic church can pay it off
[2:26:24] she's the only one that's got the money
[2:26:26] she can do it she will do
[2:26:29] it and doing this she'll compromise
[2:26:33] notice and in doing this she will
[2:26:35] compromise with the Jews and make a
[2:26:37] covenant and when she makes the Covenant
[2:26:39] with the Jews now remember I'm taking
[2:26:41] this from the scriptures now when she
[2:26:43] does this makes this Covenant we notice
[2:26:45] in Daniel 8:23 and 25 he will cause
[2:26:49] craft to prosper manufacturing at his
[2:26:51] hand he makes this Covenant with the
[2:26:53] Jews and in the midst of the three and
[2:26:55] 1/2 years he breaks this Covenant as
[2:26:57] soon as he gets the thing wrapped up and
[2:26:59] gets the money of the Jews tied
[2:27:03] up he's going to hold the money and
[2:27:06] that's where I think he'll come in he's
[2:27:09] talking about the Beast so when he gets
[2:27:11] the money all under control then he'll
[2:27:13] break this Covenant with the Jews as
[2:27:15] Daniel said here it would be in the
[2:27:16] midst of the the the last half of the 70
[2:27:19] weeks of Daniel he will have all the
[2:27:21] world trade and commerce the and a pack
[2:27:24] with the world cuz he will hold the
[2:27:25] wealth of the world
[2:27:27] completely and he says excuse me and
[2:27:29] during this time there'll be two
[2:27:30] prophets rise on the scene they called
[2:27:32] the 144,000 he says thank God the church
[2:27:35] will be joining at this time of three
[2:27:36] and a half years in
[2:27:39] glory we don't have to go through it l
[2:27:43] that's from your Prophet don't have to
[2:27:45] go through it and notice when the church
[2:27:47] is taken up Satan has come down he goes
[2:27:50] then in Revelations 13 He sets a mark
[2:27:53] down the boycott you can't buy or sale
[2:27:57] because now he owns the wealth of the
[2:27:59] world see what does this Mark it's
[2:28:02] joining the World Council of churches
[2:28:04] let me bring this down to a close here
[2:28:06] in just a few minutes remember the
[2:28:07] Antichrist in the Beast is a self-same
[2:28:10] spirit there's the Trinity three stages
[2:28:14] first stage he's the Antichrist second
[2:28:17] stage he's the false prophet third stage
[2:28:19] he's called called the
[2:28:21] beast notice first stage he's called the
[2:28:25] Antichrist talked about that Nick and
[2:28:27] spirit that was Crown second stage he's
[2:28:29] called the false prophet and brother BR
[2:28:30] says the pope with the false word is the
[2:28:32] false prophet then he said the third
[2:28:35] stage then he's Crown when this is taken
[2:28:37] off when the bride is gone then he's
[2:28:39] crowned
[2:28:41] Beast notice the third stage is a beast
[2:28:44] a man that's crowned in the last days
[2:28:46] with every Power that Pagan Rome ever
[2:28:48] had because the seven-headed Beast
[2:28:50] Dragon was cast out of Heaven Come
[2:28:51] incarnate in the false prophet and here
[2:28:53] it is he had seven crowns he was cast
[2:28:55] out and throw into the Earth W who is
[2:28:57] this Rider he said this horse rider you
[2:28:59] know who it is is Satan's
[2:29:02] Superman see the world brother man says
[2:29:04] the world's been wanting a
[2:29:06] Superman he said this riter is nothing
[2:29:09] but Satan's Superman the Incarnate Devil
[2:29:11] he's an educated genius the world's
[2:29:13] wanting a Superman a man that can stop
[2:29:16] Wars a man that can feed a hungry across
[2:29:19] the world a man that can ify the people
[2:29:20] in the day a man that can bridge the gap
[2:29:23] between heterosexuals and homosexuals a
[2:29:25] man that can provide Financial stability
[2:29:27] to people around the world let me give
[2:29:29] you some of the current comments that
[2:29:31] Pope Francis has made just so you can
[2:29:32] see how even their dialogue and their
[2:29:35] thinking begins to kind of fit the scale
[2:29:37] of Satan Superman he says all Christians
[2:29:39] must reaffirm the Dignity of every human
[2:29:43] being all Christians must reaffirm the
[2:29:46] the Dignity of every human being notice
[2:29:49] that sounds good doesn't it otherwise
[2:29:52] you got to be tolerant of every man's
[2:29:55] belief whether he's a homosexual whether
[2:29:58] he's not whether he's transgender
[2:30:00] whether he's
[2:30:01] not we must notice reaffirm the Dignity
[2:30:05] of every human being otherwise be
[2:30:07] tolerant of what they
[2:30:08] believe clean energy requires renewable
[2:30:11] resources and responsible consumption
[2:30:13] now what does a pastor or a pope a
[2:30:16] religious leader have to deal with clean
[2:30:18] energy don't you see the clean energy
[2:30:20] movement that's right now underline
[2:30:22] right here in the United States of
[2:30:23] America by 2030 I believe it is that
[2:30:25] we're supposed to be 100% on electric
[2:30:29] power by 2030 we supposed to be 100% on
[2:30:32] elect do you not understand what that's
[2:30:34] going to do to our
[2:30:36] nation my my daughter Lauren and I we
[2:30:39] work for a trucking company they want to
[2:30:41] even have the big 18wheeler semis to be
[2:30:43] all be on electric power those things
[2:30:46] can only go 300 miles on electric power
[2:30:49] and it takes 36 hours to fully recharge
[2:30:52] that thing back up so you're telling me
[2:30:55] we're going travel is going to increase
[2:30:57] you're telling me we're going to fix the
[2:30:58] world economy at least in the United
[2:31:01] States with electric power there's a
[2:31:03] push down there it's something that's
[2:31:05] being done under the cover of Darkness
[2:31:07] yet at the same time that this is
[2:31:09] happening in America we're going green
[2:31:11] all the other countries of the world are
[2:31:13] buying up our automobiles they're buying
[2:31:16] up our 18 wers they're buying these
[2:31:18] things up in grows because they they
[2:31:20] don't dance to the same tune of the
[2:31:22] image of the Beast has rose up out of
[2:31:27] America these are things that's
[2:31:29] happening parts of the puzzle fitting in
[2:31:31] place when you read these things and
[2:31:33] hear these things on the news just put
[2:31:35] it in there it's fulfilling prophecy
[2:31:36] modern events are being made clear by
[2:31:41] prophecy notice my goodness I promise
[2:31:45] I'm I'm I'm starting to land I just put
[2:31:47] the wheels out all right we're going to
[2:31:50] land this thing here in just a minute M
[2:31:51] goodness notice educated this Satan
[2:31:54] Superman with education and wisdom with
[2:31:56] church Theology of his own word in his
[2:31:58] own making he rides with the white
[2:32:00] denominational horse to deceive the
[2:32:02] people every denomination is struck
[2:32:05] right into it the Federation of churches
[2:32:08] what's backing at Rome the Pope's now
[2:32:10] crying we're all one let's come together
[2:32:12] and walk together so let's look here
[2:32:15] what members of the denominations are
[2:32:16] part of this World Council of churches
[2:32:18] Orthodox churches Eastern and Oriental
[2:32:21] as well as African instituted angan
[2:32:23] Aryan the Baptist Evangel Evangelical uh
[2:32:27] Lutheran minonite Methodist Mor morvan
[2:32:30] or something like that old Catholic
[2:32:32] Pentecostals reformed United uniting and
[2:32:36] free independent churches Disciples of
[2:32:38] Christ and friends and
[2:32:40] Quakers so there's all kinds there's
[2:32:43] 352 denominations right now it's all
[2:32:46] wrapped up in it with over 500 million
[2:32:50] people that's wrapped up in this whole
[2:32:52] Confederation of churches and brother BR
[2:32:54] says it's the same prostitute
[2:32:57] institution the next thing church is the
[2:33:00] rapture of the
[2:33:03] church and I'll bring this down to a
[2:33:05] close notice he'll conquer and almost
[2:33:07] has in his grip right now while he's
[2:33:09] still the Antichrist before he can come
[2:33:11] and becomes Beast you talk about cruel
[2:33:14] punishment you just wait watch then
[2:33:17] what's left on the earth that will go
[2:33:19] right through with the he said there
[2:33:20] will be a weeping and wailing and ntion
[2:33:22] of teeth for the red dragon Rome spurted
[2:33:25] out water out of her mouth to make war
[2:33:27] with the rant of the woman seed that was
[2:33:29] left upon the Earth after the bride has
[2:33:31] been selected and took out after the
[2:33:34] bride has been selected and took out and
[2:33:35] the dragon made war with the remnant
[2:33:37] that didn't want to come in and was
[2:33:39] hunted down and the real church will go
[2:33:41] through that if it was
[2:33:44] possible oh but praise
[2:33:46] God praise God it's impossible for the
[2:33:50] real church for she will not be deceived
[2:33:54] musicians if you would
[2:33:55] come notice now and the real Church
[2:33:58] would go through that if it was possible
[2:34:00] but you know they've done it under the
[2:34:02] blood they're under the blood of the
[2:34:04] grace of Christ and it's not going
[2:34:06] through have no tribulation period the
[2:34:08] next thing for the church is the
[2:34:12] rapture that's
[2:34:14] prophecy so when you can see these other
[2:34:17] pieces of the puzzle falling into place
[2:34:20] you got to see the most important piece
[2:34:22] of the puzzle for you regarding your
[2:34:24] place that's the Rapture of the
[2:34:27] church notice let me bring this down
[2:34:33] here he goes now let's not give the
[2:34:35] Satan all the credit here we go I'm
[2:34:38] bringing you out I'm bringing you back
[2:34:39] to light not GNA leave you in this

[2:35:29] anything to worry about this little
[2:35:30] Bri's going to be taken up in a moment
[2:35:32] in the twinkling of an eye and God sends
[2:35:36] us a prophet to vindicate this word not
[2:35:39] only to vindicate it but bring the
[2:35:41] inspiration behind it to show us what to
[2:35:45] look forward
[2:35:48] to Malachi not Malachi Matthew
[2:35:53] 10:41 he that receiveth a prophet in the
[2:35:57] name of a prophet receives a prophet's
[2:36:00] reward and he that receiveth a righteous
[2:36:03] man in the name of a righteous man shall
[2:36:06] receive a righteous man's
[2:36:09] reward brother bam says they asked him I
[2:36:14] like to know about Matthew 10:41 I like
[2:36:16] to know what is a prophet's reward how
[2:36:19] many you like to know what that is a
[2:36:22] prophet's reward we believe a message of
[2:36:24] a prophet there's got to be a reward for
[2:36:26] believing the message
[2:36:28] right he goes now whoever receives a
[2:36:30] prophet in the name of a prophet
[2:36:32] receives a prophet's reward a prophet's
[2:36:34] reward is to be a friend with the
[2:36:38] prophet whosoever receives a righteous
[2:36:41] man in the name of a righteous man
[2:36:43] receives a righteous man's reward is
[2:36:45] that right if they want to know what a
[2:36:47] prophet's reward is is to be a friend to
[2:36:49] the prophet that's the reward he's your
[2:36:55] friend oh
[2:36:57] Church you say well brother Joe I never
[2:36:59] met the prophet I never met brother
[2:37:02] brandham that doesn't matter his
[2:37:05] message his message is your
[2:37:09] friend his message is to help you not
[2:37:11] hurt you his message is to Enlighten you
[2:37:14] to bring you to the truths of the Bible
[2:37:16] not to dis discredit you not to point
[2:37:18] you into a world Council of of churches
[2:37:20] to receive a prophet is to receive his
[2:37:23] reward of becoming his friend he climbs
[2:37:25] up in the fear of Supernatural and he
[2:37:28] brings back the revelations that John
[2:37:30] has the revelations of Isaiah the
[2:37:32] revelations of the inspiration of all
[2:37:34] these other prophets and he comes down
[2:37:36] and he shares them with us thus that's
[2:37:39] why we must have a Vindicated Prophet
[2:37:42] before the end time can come so what's
[2:37:44] the last sign what's the last sign there
[2:37:47] going to be a prophet in the land
[2:37:50] and what is he going to do he's going to
[2:37:51] discern the very thoughts and intents of
[2:37:52] the heart he's going to make known the
[2:37:54] scriptures but he's going to discern
[2:37:56] he's going to turn the hearts of the
[2:37:57] people back to the father we're living
[2:37:59] Church in the hour of
[2:38:03] fulfillment I pray that you're ready to
