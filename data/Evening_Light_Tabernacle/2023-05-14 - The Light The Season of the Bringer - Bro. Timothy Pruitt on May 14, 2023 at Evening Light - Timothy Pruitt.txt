of cancers and heart issues and different things God truly we can say Lord there's nothing too hard for you there's nothing too far gone that you can't heal or deliver set free we thank you for that promise we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen turn to Joel chapter 2 and also John chapter 1. amen it's good to be with you this morning the house of the Lord amen God's good to us just wanted to thank the Lord for all the mothers that are among us and I know this is a day set aside to honor mothers but I I believe it is the prophet of God saying said every day ought to honor mother amen and so uh but we do want to give you the honor that you are due and the time that we're living in when the world is stripped all that away and and you know put put a woman out in the workforce and to do those things and took her away from the home to do what God had called her to do I'm thankful that there's still real true God called mothers amen and if you have a mother you ought to be thankful for her today amen God bless you let's look here Joel chapter 2 and verse 25. I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten and canker worm the caterpillar the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed it's amazing he said that twice amen it's a double promise and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit John chapter 1 and verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth and darkness and the Darkness comprehendeth it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for witness to Bear witness of that light that all men through him might believe but he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to him gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of the blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen God bless you can be seated I'd like to speak to you this morning on the light the season of the bringer amen I believe that's the season that we're in he's bringing life he's brought life again into the body we know that we were all born in sin and shaped in iniquity we were all born with a sin nature Ephesians 2 and verse 1 says we were dead in trespasses of sin so you know we may have heard salvation many times described as something like this you know I was drowning in a sea of sin and Jesus came by in a boat and he threw out a lifeline and he pulled me on board and he saved me amen that's all that's all wonderful and it's good but it's truly the gospel says you were dead in sins and trespasses in other words you were weren't just drowning in the sea of your sin you were dead floating face down and Jesus walked on the water and it came to where you could when you could not come to him and he picked you up and he carried your dead body back to the shore and breathed eternal life into your lungs amen God what a mighty God we serve then he says here in John 1 and verse 4 in him was the life and that life was the light of men so Jesus came into the world to bring light and to bring life because he came into the world into a world that was spiritually blind it was spiritually dark and it was spiritually dead and there was no life that was there any longer in any kind of religious Realms or any kind they hadn't had a prophet in some 400 years that had even spoke the word of God to them and so they ca he came in a time that was very blind and a very dark and very dead but when Jesus came we read that he was not he was not recognized or received by the world Amen because in John 3 and verse 19 it says people love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil amen and so we see again a parallel of the time that we're living in it's again a very dead world is a very spirit actually blind World in a very spiritually dark world Amen we see that people's Deeds are very evil and they love Darkness more than they loved light amen and sowed but Jesus is the true light and there is love there there is light in no other one there's night light there is not light in any other thing now there are fake lights in the world but Jesus is not merely a light he is the light amen he's not just merely speaking of a light he is the Fulfillment of what light really is he is the truth and so and but you know also in that scripture Not only was there a rejecting of light but there was also a receiving of life and he said but all who did receive him to him gave them power or the right to be children of God to those that believe in his name see light will change you if you receive it amen he was you know I know no doubt uh light you know here was Saul we could look at Saul and we could see how he was changed by light he was changed from a murderer to a missionary from a church hater to a church planter he had no idea all that God had stored from him when he was on that horse on the way to Damascus but a light struck him down and when that light begins to get in you it begins to change you amen it begins to turn you around this light knows how to stop you in your trash sex it knows how to turn you around nothing could have stopped Saul but the light of God and so God knows what it takes to bring us to our knees to stop fighting him to stop pulling away from him he knows amen because you cannot fight that light that light will overtake you amen his light will bring forth life amen he is this he is the life bringer as we as we read in the scripture amen of of all those the the worms that had come and destroyed the plant and it would have destroyed the life but he said I'm going to restore I'm going to bring a restoration of what all these have done and and I'm going to bring and we read this Wednesday night and in this this quote but I just want to bring it up again he said and it shall bring forth fruit in his season he says watch it's his fruit God's fruit and then the prophet is bringing it'll be in the prophet season God's fruit God's Time by The Prophet's season he shall bring forth there's fruit in this season see there's two his there bring forth God's fruit in the season that the messenger is ordained to come he will bring those things forth the messenger that brings the fruit of God will bring it in God's season in the season of the bringer and so I got to thinking about the bringer and how many times and there's there's all kinds of times of work amen God spoke of himself as a bringer and we can read about it in Exodus chapter 3 and verse 17 he says and I have said I will bring you up out of the Affliction of the Egyptians unto the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and on down it says in Exodus chapter 6 and verse 6 it says wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will rid you of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stressed out arm and with great judgments and we can say that he did that amen we can say that he brought them out of slavery and set them free amen they had to go through a lot of things in their life but what he promised he brought to pass amen it said it said a precedence or it said something there that we can look at a law of God that what God done he does What God Says amen and what he said he brought to pass and so we can look at the same God that moved upon them is the same God that's going to move for us amen and I love how he said that he said that twice as I I mentioned that and my people shall never be ashamed because he has a natural seed and a spiritual seed so he wants you to know that they shall never be ashamed the natural seed but also the spiritual sea shall never be ashamed amen that God will bring forth what he said he was going to bring forth in the season of the bringer now it may not be in our season or in our time or when we want it to be but when his God has ordained for that to happen there ain't nothing that can stop it it's going to come to pass I don't care what you're asking for if it's in the word of God it's going to come to pass and God's going to bring it amen in Isaiah 42 and verse 16 it says I will bring the Blind by the way that they knew not and I will lead them excuse me in past that they have not known and I will make Darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will I do unto them and not forsake them Hallelujah God is Not forsaken his people this morning that's enough right there to shout about it doesn't you may look like it's forsaken it may look like you're forgotten but there's a word that says here I'm going to bring it to pass I'm going to bring the blind amen by the way that they do not I'm going to lead them and pass it they have not known and I'm going to make Darkness light before them and I'm going to straighten all the crooked things out in their life and I'm going to bring them back to me Hallelujah that's something to shout about to realize your children may be out there blind right now but the bringer is going to bring them forth and he's going to bring the Blind by way they've not known before they didn't know it was possible they didn't know they could do it they didn't know it was able they didn't know it would be about that they could be a Son of God or a daughter of God or they could be a child of God but I'm going to make the darkness light before them and I'm going to straighten out all those misunderstandings and I'm going to straighten out all the Crooked ways and I'm going to make them straight because I want you to know I'm not going to forsake them but I'm going to bring them forth Hallelujah Isaiah 43 and verse 1 says it like this but now thus saith the Lord that created thee o Jacob he has formed the O Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by my name and thou art mine amen that's what we need to let the devil know I am his I belong to Jesus so when I pass through the waters I he'll be with me when I go through the rivers they'll not overflow me but when I walk us through the fire Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel amen thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopians see before thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and I have loved thee therefore I will give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for I am with thee and I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the west and I'll say to the north give them up Hallelujah and to the South keep not back and bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth so it's showing it's right there in the promises of God they can never get far enough they can never get deep enough it'll never get dark enough but it's love and his Mercy shall follow them to the ends of the Earth even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory and I have formed him yea I have made him bring forth the blind people that have eyes well that's a paradox amen the blind people that have eyes and the death that have ears amen they didn't know they had eyes but there was another eyesight that was coming they didn't know we had ears but there was another ear a hearing that was coming let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is the truth you are my witness saith the Lord and my servant whom I've chosen that you may know and believe me and understand that I am me before me there is no God form neither shall be after me I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior I have declared I have saved and have shown when there was no strange God among you therefore ye are my Witnesses saith the Lord I am God yea before the day was I am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand I will work and who shall let it what does that mean who can revoke what I have said who can reverse what I do so it doesn't matter what the devil has said about him or the devil has said about you it matters what God Said first because remember there was another voice that is spoke over your life before the devil ever did there was another law that was put in place before the devil ever had one moment of right over your life or one moment to be able to touch you there was already a law that was theirs hanging over you a prophecy it says devil you can only go so far you can only do so much but I'm going to bring them back the saith the Lord and you can hold them but I'm going to say turn them loose and you can hinder them but I'm gonna say let them go [Applause] Hallelujah the bringer will bring them forth because he is the bringer when he brings it it is finished he is the bringer of light and that light is the life of men not a life but the life and the bringer of life excuse me when that light shines upon sea it will come to life come on now amen when that light shines upon sea it will come to life now we don't know when that light will shine on that certain seed it may be shadows on it listen it may be something there hindering it right now or something keeping it back but God will remove every hindrance amen just like if you want a good garden spot and you got a lot of trees what are you going to do you're going to cut some trees down if you want a garden and you're going to remove the hindrance from allowing the sun to come through and listen if there is a life a seed that is laying down there I don't care how deep it is how dark it is how impossible it may seem but there's a sieging of Life of God on the inside that light is going to find it somehow or another and when it finds it it's going to come to life it doesn't matter how much the devil's piled on it how many complexes there how much sin is there how much drugs whatever you want to put there amen no matter how much is there how many spirits of hell that is walking through their through their body that doesn't matter when the voice of God speaks and the light shines and say turn them loose yeah the bringer will bring them forth we are in the season of the bringer amen the light shines upon the sea it'll come to my no matter how long it may have laid in the dark dirt no matter how how much may be covering it how impossible it may be semen that life will ever come forth that matters not because the word's been spoke amen it's what happened in Genesis 18. we've been hearing about Sarah it's in verse 14 is anything too hard for the Lord I'll let you answer that question too hard for the Lord let me ask this church is cancer too hard amen is it's spirits of hell too hard is even demonic amen demonic expression and so overtaking the body is that too hard for the Lord is healings of any kind too hard for the Lord is there any sinner too hard for the Lord no is there any case impossible for God no is anything as Allah is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life so when it's time for life life is going to come forth and I'm going to bring it and Sarah shall have a son Second Kings 4 16 he said about this season according to the time of life Thou shalt Embrace his son and say and she said name O Lord thou art a man of God do not lie unto thy hands May amen she heard something that sounded so impossible surely he's kidding me surely he's he's he's he's he's joking these ain't jokes these are the truth this season according to the time of life and where the next verse and the woman conceived and bears son at the season that Elisha had said unto her according to the time of life so in other words it wasn't a joke it wasn't a kid it wasn't a play it wasn't nothing but the truth and the bringer brought it forth the bringer brought it to life amen I'm thankful that we have the bringer Among Us he's bringing in the promises of God and he's handing them out to those that will believe amen this morning he's loaded down with Promises of God and he's just looking to bring somebody some Joy this morning and somebody some happiness this morning and somebody I promised this morning if there's somebody said Lord don't joke with me no is there anything too hard for God whatever you have need of he has it there was some seeds in the upper room and the light shined upon the seeds and it bloomed out on the day of Pentecost on the damn penny cost a few a days 50 days after Easter there came a rushing Mighty Wind Out of Heaven amen you know he said we want to make that difference say well the minister stands up with his collar all fixed up and says I'll put your name on the book or you come up here and you eat a certain kind of bread and you'll become a member of the church he said the minister say come join our growth he said they're wrong he said Pentecost Came From Heaven it came from Heaven not off the pulpit up the road from Heaven a priest no a minister no what was it a sound like a rushing Mighty Wind it filled the house where they were sitting and cloven tongue set upon each one of them and they began to speak in tongues they couldn't talk right they were so full of the glory of God the Holy Ghost filled each and every one of them and out on the streets they went even the dignified congregation stood out there and said why these men are full of new wine they're all drunk look at their men and women how they're staggering and carrying on he said that's how the church was ordained come on now that's how the church was ordained that's how the bringer brought it amen that's how the bringer brought life into the body he set the church in order right there the bringer did it and he taught the proper use of the gifts of the Spirit and he confirmed that they were to remain in the church till Jesus came amen is a direct quote amen listen I can understand if a man brings something he might take it back or if a man brings something he's only limited and so much how he can bring her so much what he can do that's not God God's unlimited amen listen to this he said you have a right to enjoy the full blessings of all the apostles had all that was in the early church will remain in the church because all that was in the church was Jesus Christ the life the light the bringer so those that want to know why we enjoying ourselves well it's my inalienable right unless you know it says until Jesus comes it's my right to be happy in the Lord why do you have this right because the bringer brought it not man not man's Creeds not man's ideas the bringer brought it to me the bringer handed it to me so it's my right as a child of God to enjoy the blessings in the church the Holy Ghost baptism was to last until Jesus returns again direct quotes amen so they want to change it today that's an easy beliefism and you believe the message and you're saved no either bringer brought it in the first place and he showed how it had to be had how it had to happen in the first place and so therefore if he brought it it still must remain another one that says we know that in the day of salvation where God is calling men from the world from a life of sin into a life of service and in the day that God is poured out his Spirit from on high great signs and wonders are accompanying the ministry of this day when the former and latter rain are Fallen together we know that they're supposed to be great signs and wonders which in many denominations this is turned down just turned they're being turned down in message denominations well days of Miracles are passed it's not the season of the day of Miracles listen if it's not the season of Miracles it's not the season of God amen I can understand if God's not in your church then you ain't got no miracles but if he's there there's Miracles there's signs there's wonders there's God moving among his people amen just talking to brother Tommy Richmond he's been witnessing to a friend of his uh uh when we grew up together I don't remember a whole story but he went into a seminary by the time he said it came out in a cemetery he said he went in more it went in dead but it came out twice dead he's a part of the Church of Christ and they have totally worked out all of the Miracles out of the church they totally stripped them all out and they say it only happened back in the days of the Apostles Hallelujah it must be still the days of the Apostles because they're still happening amen but you can give them sign after sign testimony after testimony and they'll you can put them you can put a picture for for them you can put sister Orlando's before and after and they'll say it ain't so just like they did in the days of Jesus when he looked at him and said well if you'll do this then we'll believe if you'll do this if they he'd have done everything that they said they still wouldn't have believed amen but God has a people who will believe it doesn't matter if you got proof or not you still believe it doesn't matter if I got proof yet that my child's coming home I'm still going to believe that I got proof If I'm Healed I still believe [Applause] the proof I'm speaking about is things you can see with these eyes we do have proof he said well you know that Blessed Virgin Mary she got it without sensation well God wouldn't let Mary come to heaven without receiving the Holy Ghost how are you going to get there anything short of it that's right Mary was among them she had to wait up there until she lost all her dignity and pride to be filled with the spirit and here they come acting like drunk people and the Bible said they did they said these men are full of new wine and Peter hey Peter spoke up and said they're not full of new wine as you suppose seeing this is the third hour of the day but this is that which is spoken of the Prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy come on now he brought it into the first church the bringer brought it the bringer laid it there and I'll show wonders in the heavens and the Earth signs and it shall come to pass the whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Peter preached Pentecost he planted a tree oh he planted it they went out had spiritual gifts they healed the sick they preached they preached they were thrown in jail they were willing to suffer for the word sake they had backbones about them amen they would stand in the face of doubts and unbelief and demons of hell and called the word of God the truth they would stand in the face of cripples and and proclaim the glory of God and God would bring it to pass that's what the bringer brought to the church listen brother said you know you wouldn't be a very good American if you'd slip on this is you know around look after the war had happened he said but you'd slip over to Japan and you'd slip it around the line saying listen fellas I'm with you I'm going to fight for your side he said you traitor yeah you ought to be shot you're a traitor he said that's the same way it is a man that knows the word of God and will compromise on it because some organization tells him he has to do it that way that's a traitor that's a traitor amen these men wasn't traitors they didn't care how much he said they well he said look they didn't care how much what somebody thought or How They carried on how their Church manners was screaming and crying and shouting and jabbering with language that seemed like impossible to understand they wasn't traitors I'm reading you a direct quote they wasn't traitors the first church screaming crying shouting jabbering off in languages they wouldn't traitors so I just say it like this what side do you find yourself on because the bringer brought it amen talking to one another could unders couldn't understand it these men out there in the audience of other nations their tongues begin to hear what they were saying they didn't know what they were saying they were jabbering other people were out there understood it and these people they said well these people are certainly drunk that's pretty awesome for a man to be drunk on natural wine a bit of just automatically speak another language do you realize how unbelief is how dumb unbelief is takes even the natural reasonings out that you mean to tell me that they could drink some no some wine out of a wine skin and start talking in languages of a different language and people could understand every word that's coming out of their mouth Ah that's unbelievable he said notice God planted a tree to bring forth nine spiritual gifts of his Spirit The Same Spirit was in Christ was to come down to the church the gifts of spirit was in the church and was growing and it was buried forth fruit they thought not of their self they didn't organize they just went ahead and they preached the word of God and Jesus seeing them before he ascended he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow them that believe in my name you shall cast out devils and they want to take that and say that's for another day this was his commission to the church to the tree to us if you're part of the tree if you're not part of the tree then understand why you don't believe it I understand why you don't preach it I understand why you put it way off there because you are not part of that same life but of that same life the bringer brought in the beginning it's now worked down into our age and our time and it's filling people again with the same power with the same anointing with the same God it has the same works because the bringer brought it we're talking about a church spiritual we're talking about a spiritual tree Jesus said these signs shall follow them that hangs on this tree oh that's where I'm hanging at today that's where I got my life tied to amen and said they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpent drink deadly things and it'll not harm them if they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover the tree was planted it was doing great work it was moving along baptizing went to church great fellowships they had nobody needing everything everybody was kind good-hearted one big family and all of a sudden it came this big old ugly looking greedy teeth beetle I like how he put that it's all ugly looking greedy teeth beetle devil you all ugly looking greedy teeth beetle I know some of you some of your sisters he wants to put a complex on you and say you're not very pretty well at least you ain't no ugly looking greedy teeth beetle now why don't you tell that Dad won't you go look in the mirror why don't you go look what you look like amen and listen we're not looking in mirrors made of man we're looking at mirrors made of God and when I look in this mirror he says I'm fearfully and wonderfully made amen so it doesn't matter what a mirror hanging on the wall says it matters what he said and what he said you devil you ain't nothing but a scroungy looking greedy tooth beetle Hallelujah it comes in four stages four insect destroyers they come into that beautiful tree of God and it began to pull it down Palmer worm begin to eat and destroy the fruit destroy the fruit that was among them to where it was a Jew that I had to we need to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered he saw it slipping away he saw things coming into the church that didn't belong and he started screaming out and he started pulling and started preaching the word of God what was it it was still still in the fruit and it was pulling them away from the Supernatural and was pulling them into Creeds and into dogmas into and the messages of the church and all the things the devil could get their eyes on instead of what God called them to be and let me tell you the only reason it happened because there was a time of planning otherwise that church would have went in a rapture amen there was people that were ready for Rapture Paul was writing about it they were ready to go he didn't realize there's seven more six more ages coming amen what was it God said wait a minute I got more names on the book I got more people laying out that old dirty dirt that the devil thinks he ain't gonna better he's going to hold him and I ain't gonna be able to get him but I'm gonna prove my word I'm going to prove I'm thus I'm just saying yesterday today and forever and I'm going to allow my beautiful tree to die and rot and go into the ground but it's going to come back again [Applause] and I'm gonna bring it back to the same power to the same love and mercy and Grace I'm the bringer he said we'll get he said pretty soon they got dignitaries in the church Mayors and so forth a better class and long you know when I begin to tell as long as y'all keep carrying on like that they'll never come around they'll afraid he said they're afraid of you carrying on like that somebody said somebody said that he said the other day and somebody said they still are he said I guess that's about right they're afraid of the Holy Spirit said I used to sing a little song you ever hear the old-time religion anybody I've heard that song Anybody it said you said it's the old-time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go well that's why I want it hey man it's the old time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me so good I want no other where it makes me love my brother it brings things from undercover oh oh that's why you don't want it but that's why you need it it'll bring things out of the darkness of your life and say hey that's not you old boy I got a new life for you to live I got a greater life for you to live I got a better life for you to live and I'm here to bring it to you if you will accept it Hallelujah that's right it'll make you stop your lying it'll save you when you're dying it'll start the devil fly it's good enough for me I love that old song Amen it'll start the devil fly that's why we got to let the Holy Ghost loosen our services we're going to allow him to do his perfect work because we don't want the devil comfortable in these pews amen we want him to be uncomfortable and say hey hey hey I need out of here turn the Holy Ghost loose and let him do his perfect work let him set the captive free let him fill with the Holy Ghost let him heal and deliver let him do what he wants to do he is the bringer that's the reason people don't want any they didn't want Jesus they don't want his spirit the church so dignified he said you come and tell us who we are we'll give you to understand where Dr PhD LL q u s all of this I'm a high priest while you were born in sin you're nothing but an illegitimate child your mother had you before before you heard you heard and your father was ever married he said who can accuse me of sin Sinners disbelieving God's word in other words show me where I'm not fulfilling the word to the hilt show me where is not coming to pass just as the prophet said it would be and that's why I get some it just blows my mind sometimes when people look at brother Branham when they they find his humanity and they cast all the other things away well this is what the Pharisees did with Jesus they were looking at his Humanity where you were born in sin we weren't but look it did it not fulfill what the prophet had spoke that what we received in this hour did it not fulfill what is written in Scripture I get amazed I get really amazed at at people that wants to find fault and you can there's plenty of others you can find all kind of fault there you find people that took took their their gifts and made themselves millionaires out of it built kingdoms and this man was all for checks of 1.5 million dollars for one healing one healing he was given a check and he turned it all down he even tried to turn down an offer and Brother Moore taken up and and then he tried to turn it down and it's 20 some thousand dollars he's he tried to turn it down said I didn't come here for an offering I come here to see people set free and delivered and that's what makes me want to scream out as they did there what has he done they put their ads on Facebook you still following a cloud listen I'm following the cloud the same one that led the children of Israel out done pretty good for them so I'm going to follow that cloud but I can promise you one thing I ain't following the cloud that's over you that cloud of darkness and dopehead and homosexuality I ain't following that cloud I like how you said it brother air somebody needs help on aisle 37. go do your job that you went to amen quit worrying about the people of God Amen we're going to go on with Jesus if you think it's such a lie why are you worried about it anyhow but I know the bringer brought it and I'm going to follow the bringer because the bringer brings lie he brings the life to the body and I'm looking at it this morning I'm seeing life has come to bodies Palmer Warren came took off fruits love it took off peace it took off long-suffering goodness meekness Faith patience oh my that's right patience in the Holy Ghost he got to eat in the fruit of the tree they're Healing The Sick they're speaking in tongues they're casting out Devils they're doing great work they're preaching the unadulterated word of God no denomination to tie them down they're free doing it great work with this little old ugly green tooth beetle I don't know about y'all but I'm enjoying this this morning well he would like just do me a favor in the morning when he gets up and tries to whisper some kind of thing you oh ugly green tooth beetle get under my feet you ever seen a beetlewitz get squished and we call them June bugs had like a plague that comes through here every once in a while and man you're out there then all of a sudden one hits you man to make you score a skirt I've seen women Shout I've seen men scream and holler amen because they got little spinely legs and they they feel like they're going to claw you to death or they're going to eat you right up they look so they feel so like so fearful and you get so afraid and you look around it's just a little bug about like that ugly as it can be but this little bug about like that it can't do you a bit of harm all you need to do is just shake it off and stomp it amen that old devil wants to come at you on the mornings some morning men and try to put doubts and fears in your life and say oh what was that you didn't look at that green eyed green tooth snaggly tooth ugly devil and just shake him off and stop it and say devil I'm not listening to what you got to say I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I belong to the king of king and the Lord of lords you were under my feet he's come to eat the fruit of faith faith in the word he said the devil's still eating see the word's been translated so many times he is this that and the other oh he's all this but he's trying to eat the faith in the word away and the word that's been spoken he tries to bring reasonings and doubts and unbelief and all kinds of things like I said Wednesday night when all that thing happened with with Adriana the devil immediately started trying to work on my mind saying ah it wasn't that bad it wasn't that big a deal you're making it more than what it was no God made it what it is a miracle and so he tries to eat at all those things he tries to eat off he's another fruit he tries to eat is the joy of salvation oh shh you people make too much noise you people make too much noise he said how oh how can you preach when they're doing like that brother Brown he said he said I hope you understand how in the world can I preach he said listen if they didn't enjoy it I wouldn't be preaching it he said I used to have a friend of mine Jim Poole and I used to have an old dog call him Fritz so this old dog he'd go anything that was tree but a skunk he was afraid of a skunk because he smelled so bad he said I got him a skunk under a brushed pile only thing I had to do was Pat him a little bit and say sick him boy singing boy he said until he got him tree he said what so we find out amen he's trying to take the joy he said but all we need is some people to realize hey the pastor's got a skunk under the wood pile he's got one there calling and trying to get out come on sinking boy I remember being in a church there in I believe in South Carolina and I was preaching along and I've got on someone remember what it was all of a sudden a black brother that stood up in the back and he said there that devil is deal with him a while amen we need some people that'll say hey there he is let's get him let's don't allow him to live another moment his time has come deal with him kick him out don't let him have another moment seek him get after him that's the way he took away the joy David time one time said he had lost the joy of his salary for salvation he didn't lose his salvation he lost the joy of it he got Lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation the joy the joy he's supposed to have joy in church I don't get it they didn't have those same ideas when having Joy at a ball game heaven Joy Lick It Up you notice the devil wouldn't tell you then you don't need to have so much joy but he knows when you get to the Joy bringer you don't need that much you just got no don't don't go that far don't go into that no no that's good you're going to go too far he wasn't worried about you going too far at a ball game or too far in drugs or too far and drinking or too foreign sexual thing he wasn't worried about that go as far as you want but all of a sudden about the things of God we start hearing him you're going too far trying to take the joy eat the fruit of the joy now look at here you people make too much noise I tell you all this crying and saying amen and shouting that's nonsense there's nothing to that he said you'll say that and the first thing you know you're sitting in a big morgue and you're sitting there all of them dead some of these embalming fluids of so-called doctrines of Creeds pumped in their veins where the spirit of God ought to be running whether old church Creed pumped in there no wonder their ice and cold and dead spiritual thermometer the 90 below zero yes somebody say amen and everybody stretched their neck around some kind of goose or something want to know who said it it's a shame when the spirit of God ought to be joy peace and love but this little bug has aided away the next fruit he comes is after your peace peace of mind the Peace of knowing you're saved well now if you're you know if you'll recite a certain Creed you'll believe the message and you'll believe brother Adam's a prophet and you'll Place so-and-so tapes over you're saved if you join my church you're saved one of the another say if you go in there you're not saved you have to say hail Mary is to be saved you have to have your name on a book to be saved you have to have to have that oh my that would take the joy out of anything but that's not God's tree that's a hybrid tree he said but God wants somebody that knows who they are amen not just somebody's well I'm a Lutheran or I'm a presbyterian or I'm a Methodist I'm bored again I'm born of the family of God Amen it's Royal Blood that's flowing through my vein it ain't some man's Creed or Dogma it's the spirit of God that's moving through me how do you join this church brother Timothy you don't join this church you're born in this church come on now that's the only way you can be buying him just talking about evening like Tabernacle I'm talking about the Church of the Living God you can't get in it by Creed by dogmas by any kind of good work you're not going to get in the only way you're going to get in is how the bringer brought it and he brought it by the Holy Spirit and he said You shall repent and be baptized and be filled with the spirit of God that's the way the bringer brought it any other way is a hybrid and you're not born correctly amen there's a little insect old green tooth beetle by the time I get through this he gonna have all kind of names he eat all the peace of mind off well just don't have nobody that loves me nobody cares for me you're talking about people been knocking your door down trying to text you trying to show God's love and you still say there ain't nobody loves you God does he apparently he's got some children who do I know where I'm at amen we get all this peace of mind going and we we get all stirred up and rumbled rumbled up about something listen we need to come back to where he brought it he said I'll bring bring you peace not the peace that the world can give so if the world didn't give this peace the world can't take it away hallelujah amen the devil can bring it to me God brought it to me so if God brought it to me ain't nobody can do nothing about it I can hold my peace in the middle of my storm it's what he told the children of Israel at the Crossing of the Red Sea hold your peace I know one one thought is keep your mouth shut or speak the right thing and that's a wonderful thought but also during your storms you can hold your peace you can hold it very closely knowing that while you're in the storm and if you're in a storm that doesn't mean he ain't left you or that he's left you or you're all alone or you're by yourself no if you're in the middle of the storm that means he's still with me he's still in the boat he's still here he's still moving he's still making a way where there seems to be no way he is still orchestrating everything according to his will for my good then it tears off Fellowship brings that down with all these weird feelings that goes on time to put our weird feelings aside and just fall in love with Jesus and then fall in love with Jesus you fall in love with his people listen to this this blew my mind I guess I've heard it before but when I read it again it just gives you quite the picture it talks about the nazarenes and the lutherans and the Presbyterians and the pilgrim Holiness and the and the Pentecostals and all that he said I've seen her the other night the whole thing her pastor laying on top kissing a corpse making love to it said they ain't got no more time anyhow this is all of it he said my but God planted a tree to bring forth spiritual fruit s of his Spirit fruits of Joy love happiness fruits of the Holy Ghost but man has always tried to take the spiritual church and make it into an artificial form Luther had a spiritual church he goes into what they do they turn it into an artificial form John Wesley a great man of God had a spiritual church but as soon as he went off the scene they turned it into an artificial form and what he thinks trying to happen even in all ranks listen as we've heard it brother Branham left the car running the Dynamics and the mechanics are here but a bunch of quack mechanics get in there and they start filling with this and filling with that just leave it running leave it running it'll go down to the Holy Ghost it'll go down a Divine healer it'll run over every devil in hell I thought about this here again the other night a couple it's been a while back was driving to church and it was coming up to Cotton Valley coming that way so it's been a while because that bridge been out a while but anyway I'm driving along and out of the corner of my eyes see a snake just come out onto the road before I could even Flinch or anything right over it I said well I didn't see that coming sister Ruth sitting over there she said I think the worst thing is or maybe the other thing is he didn't see you coming and I'm thinking about this thought on treading on serpents listen you go put your foot on a serpent it's going to bite you you put your own flesh on it it's going to rare up and it's going to bite you but I'm not coming in my power I'm coming in a different Power the spirit of not by might not my power but by the spirit of God Amen there's a car that you can get in that'll run over every devil amen you might say well I didn't see that coming well the worst thing he didn't see you coming amen he didn't see that it wasn't just you coming down the highway but there was a power that was greater that was carrying you over the serpent it was carrying you over the trial that was carrying you over the sickness that was carrying you over the trouble there is a power in the Church of the Living God and he will bring you to your victory he will bring you to the season of life listen he's not only going to just bring the season to you he's going to bring you to the season when you don't have the strength and you don't have the ability God rich in Mercy just like we heard when we was dead and sins and trespasses we were laying face down in a flood and the devil had destroyed our life but God come walking on the flood and he reached down and he picked us up and he carried us back to somewhere we could stand on and he put us down and he began to breathe a life eternal life into our bodies that's why we can believe what we believe that's why we can trust how we trust that's why we can have the peace that we have that's why we can have the joy joy unspeakable and full of Glory because it's not my life I live by the life of Jesus Christ [Applause] he said it's come down to a bunch of Tommy rot it's a form of godliness the Bible says in the last days I have a form of godliness but deny the power hello God don't do like he used to do this is not the season of Miracles you deny her you traitor Paul and saw you coming in the last days perilous times shall come men will be lovers of their own self proud black boasters blasphemers disobedient unthankful Unholy without natural affection and kindness despise are those that are good traitors oh yeah Traders Now understand why he called them traitors I minded having a form of godliness ain't that a paradox somebody that's a blasphemer disobedient unthankful Unholy without natural affection incontinent despise those are good traitors high-minded but having a form of godliness what deny the power thereof brother Timothy the picture looks very bleak but it ain't over the author flips the script he turns the chapter and he says but I'll see all this desolation I see all of this but I'm going to bring restoration and all the years that the canker worm the Palmer worm and the locusts and all that is taken and destroyed I'm going to restore I'm going to bring it back to what it should be oh God I'm so thankful it's not this is not depending the Rapture is not depending on fickle men because fickleman will put you in and put you out they'll put you up one day and tear you down the next but if God loved you ever he loves you forever and if God ever cared about you he still cares about you oh if he was a son at the beginning or a daughter at the beginning you'll be one at the end it doesn't matter what they've done in Missouri he said I'm going to bring you I'm going to bring you to the promise even Sarah when you didn't have the faith to believe it I'm going to bring you to it even when you laughed at it I'm going to bring you to it because you're my child I traded many nations for you hello he had the opportunity Satan gave him so I'll give you all the kingdoms he didn't want all of them he wanted you he wants you this morning and he said I'm going to bring you to the place we know there's another story brother Brandon talks about being up there in the wilderness and getting turned around and got lost at night and he got there in that big old burn over patch in the Moonlight and the wind blowing through the air I was making that say I've heard it it's it is spooky I heard it during the day and it was spooky enough couldn't imagine what it'd be in the moonlit night I mean brother Doug Baker was sitting on the side of Mount Lemmon had been burned over a few years and watching looking over Tucson and the wind coming up that Valley hit the most snag [Music] I can still almost feel the hair pulling up could you imagine being out by yourself and God wants to show you something can we see it in the daylight but no he wants to show him and he brings him to this place said it was a spooky looking place looked like a graveyard the wind would come down and it began to hit and they'd go hmm just a mournful sound stood and looked at a little bit and I thought of this scripture right here Joel chapter 2. these trees Put Me In Mind of some of these great big fire inspired churches sitting there just as beautiful as they can be but just as dead as a doornail even the Palmer arm and eat all the bark off of them and fire trials and blazed all the spirit away it was nothing left but a big statue just as dead as it can be and when the bright Mighty rushing wind from Heaven would come the only thing they would do was groan and Say It Ain't So and they would say days of Miracles are passed you traitor you dead snag days of Miracles are passed just every time God sends a Revival signs and wonders begin to come up and fall among the people and the things they say all the days Americans have passed what the Palmer wearing left the caterpillar eating what the Methodist left the Baptist scene what the Baptist left the Presbyterian or the Presbyterian left the Pentecostal was eaten until his God to such a place it stripped the tree of everything as God all the power all the joy all the good things that God was to bring to his church on the day of Pentecost they tore it all out and there's nothing left but a big church name brother let me tell you what this world needs tonight he said that old tree is standing there oh we got a name we got a tree he once was a tree but what about now he said that's the Pentecostal Church too he said the hardest kick I ever got about Divine Healing was from an Assembly of God man I wonder how hard a message person would kick him it's the truth you know we had I was talking about this other day we had our family Camp I think the first year and it was some volunteers that was on the campground they got a memorial there buddy Robinson had preached there let me saw that yeah it's there and and so uh we was in service and the spirit of God began to move and some of the volunteers had come into that service and one of them went out and began to weep so I think it was to brother Daryl and said we used to have Services just like this but it's all laid off we had Armory down in Hot Springs Arkansas couldn't have enough seats we had several thousand people he had a great big lot of Siege anybody that believed in Divine Healing couldn't even sit in his seats what a shame what a shame what's the matter what the Palm worm left the caterpillar eat the Baptist took the shouting away from the Methodist one ate this and one ate that until they strip the church down until they got them just as dead as a doornail no Spirit no shouting no joy no peace no healing no nothing what the Methodist left the baptism was the Baptiste the caterpillar eating some other church and this one he did this and took that away and this took that away we got nothing left but just a kirch's Creed well one left another knee until you got nothing but a big dead tree and he said every time God sends a big rush of Glory down well I don't believe in it psychology this that and the other dead from The Roots up twice dead plucked up by the roots it's a sad looking day but he said when Joel looked at that and saw that he said but God said I will restore Hallelujah I will bring it to pass I will bring it right back to what he wanted at the beginning he said it happened to look that night when the wind was blowing there how stiff and starch and dead sitting there moaning and groaning didn't have no life to bend with it the bark wasn't flexible no more mourning and groaning on the account of the wind Dr so and so Dr so-and-so said but it happened to notice underneath there was some undergrowth coming up some little bushes about like that they had life in them and when the wind began to hit them they started twisting and ringing and shouting and having a glorious time let me tell you brother God is going to raise up a generation of people out of all this dead stuff that's going to go into a restoration that's the saith the Lord God's going to raise up a people who believe in signs and wonders God's going to raise up a people who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory and when the Russian Mighty winds come it'll give right to it it'll flock it'll dance whatever it's going to do it's going to glorify God because if you knew what I knew and what it's done for me you'd be shouting too you'd be glorifying God you would give him praise you would shout hallelujah there would be something on the inside of you I once was lost I once was laying dead in my sin but the grace of God picked me up [Applause] green leaves clapping their hands green leaves dancing and glorifying God what a frolic that little under listen to this that little undergrowth was having but that big old tree standing there at the same time moaning and groaning same wind same when the same wind was making one moan and groan was given another a big time hallelujah what I happen to think well what is this doing that wind was moving through and it's pulling them roots and loosen the ground so that little tree could grow deeper and get a better hole he said every time God sends his blessings His blessings upon born-again men and women it only loosens up the roots for them to grow deeper and higher and better and Freer and glorify God more I will restore saith the Lord I will bring this to flesh it was four death Messengers and he said listen real close four death Messengers killed the tree Palm worm Locus king of worm caterpillar four messengers of Roman devils Roman dogmas killed that tree one took his fruit one took his bark one took his Leafs one took his life four messengers of Dogma killed the tree all but the root because there was a word hanging over that tree it says I'm going to have a bride I'm gonna have a bride without spot with a wrinkling those that are alive and remain there was a word hanging over that root there was a word hanging there that was spoke over what the caterpillar could do and the palm of worm could see the devil can only go so far he's got a leash or the Bible would talk about a bridle he puts a bridle in his mouth in other words God's got the controls of him the devil my arms want to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you and he gets so close the next thing he knows he's heading a different direction why because somebody else has got him in control oh you may feel like you're you're headed to destruction and the devil is hot on your Trails but what you need to do is run to the rock that is higher than we are run as hard as you can and when you feel that Hound of death on the hill Hills don't worry there's somebody behind him that's got him in control and God is only trying to get you to a certain place at a certain time in a certain season to receive something for him you go through drought so you can enjoy times of plenty there's Seasons God doesn't always bring you know people think well I get the Holy Ghost and it's all over with it's just nothing but joy bells or Heaven no you're going to have trials you're going to go through things in your life you're going to go through valleys but you go through the valley
