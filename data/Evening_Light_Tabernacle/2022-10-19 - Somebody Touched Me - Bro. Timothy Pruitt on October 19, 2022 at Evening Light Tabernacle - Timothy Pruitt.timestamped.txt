[43:11] and really thankful for all the things
[43:14] God has done Amen Brother David Siler
[43:17] and brother uh Wayne Lawson went from

[43:22] Glover myself and hey man just want to

[43:27] and for what he's doing there amen uh
[43:30] it's good to see uh people come into the
[43:32] Lord and a lot a lot of ones coming off
[43:35] the street and things and and so uh it's
[43:38] good to see those things amen it was
[43:40] just a wonderful time in his presence I
[43:42] know some from uh especially some of the
[43:45] young people went from here brother Andy
[43:47] Wiggins and his mother as well and and
[43:50] some young people from there and and
[43:52] we're blessed and on the way home the
[43:55] other day three of our young men was
[43:57] just pulling out and headed home and uh
[44:00] and somebody pulled out in front of them
[44:02] and and they could it could have been
[44:04] really bad but we thank the Lord for
[44:06] watching over them and and bringing them
[44:08] safely home
[44:09] amen Luke chapter 8 and verse 43
[44:14] I'm just going to speak on something
[44:16] that I ministered there Sunday morning
[44:19] part of it and then a little some some
[44:21] other things as well Luke chapter 8 and
[44:23] verse 43 and a woman having an issue of
[44:27] blood 12 years
[44:29] which has spent all her living upon
[44:31] Physicians
[44:32] neither could be healed of any
[44:35] came behind him and touched the border
[44:37] of His Garment
[44:39] and immediately her issue of blood
[44:41] stanced
[44:43] and Jesus said who touched me when all
[44:47] denied Peter and they that were with him
[44:49] said Master the multitude throng thee
[44:51] and press thee sayest thou who touched
[44:54] me
[44:55] and Jesus says somebody has touched me
[44:58] for I perceive that virtue has gone out
[45:01] of me
[45:02] and when the woman saw that she was not
[45:04] hid she came trembling and fallen down
[45:07] before him and she declared unto him
[45:09] before all the people for what caused
[45:12] she had touched him and how she was
[45:14] healed immediately and he said unto her
[45:18] daughter be of good Comfort thy faith
[45:22] has made thee whole go in peace also
[45:26] Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12.
[45:29] it says for the word of God is quicker
[45:32] and powerful and sharper than any
[45:35] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[45:38] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit of
[45:41] the joints and the morrow and is a
[45:43] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[45:45] the heart and neither is there any
[45:48] creature that is not manifest in his
[45:50] sight but all things are naked and open
[45:53] unto the eyes of him
[45:56] which whom we have to do seeing then
[45:59] that we have a great high priest that
[46:02] has passed unto Heavens Jesus the son of
[46:04] God let us hold fast our profession
[46:08] for we have not a high priest which
[46:10] cannot be touched with the feelings of
[46:12] our infirmities but was in all points
[46:15] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[46:18] Let Us therefore come boldly unto the
[46:21] throne of grace that we may obtain Mercy
[46:24] and find Grace in The Help and to help
[46:27] in time of need amen God bless you
[46:31] like to look at that scripture there in
[46:34] Luke chapter 8 again verse 46 and just
[46:37] speak for a moment tonight on somebody
[46:41] touched me
[46:42] somebody touched me
[46:46] you know I
[46:49] we're humans I believe every one of us
[46:51] tonight are humans in this building
[46:53] Lisa's what I'm trusting tonight and we
[46:56] all have issues in our lives now my
[47:00] issues may be different than your issues
[47:02] no doubt or yours than mine but we all
[47:05] have them because we are human and we
[47:07] have this flesh that we deal with
[47:10] and you know there's nothing that is hid
[47:12] before the sight of almighty God but God
[47:15] knows our issues and he knows amen the
[47:18] things that we deal with on a daily
[47:20] basis many times and things that come up
[47:23] in our lives whether it be things are
[47:25] passed down through generations through
[47:27] our families or or whatever we all have
[47:30] those things that we face and many times
[47:33] you know we try to hide those things and
[47:35] we try to keep them covered and covered
[47:37] up and act like they're not there but as
[47:40] we read in Hebrews chapter 4 the word is
[47:43] the discerner of the thoughts and
[47:44] intents of the heart and as the
[47:46] scripture said there's nothing that is
[47:48] hid that all things are naked so when
[47:50] you stand before him he knows all of
[47:53] your faults he knows all your failures
[47:55] he knows all the things that you've done
[47:57] even the thoughts that have you your
[47:59] thought in your mind he knows all about
[48:01] it so there's nothing that can be hid
[48:03] from him but in spite of all of that
[48:06] amen you can still he can still be
[48:08] touched by your infirmity these he can
[48:11] still be touched by the things that you
[48:13] go through and the situations your life
[48:15] and we can read it there as we read and
[48:17] he said we have not a high priest which
[48:20] cannot be touched or in other words we
[48:22] have a high priest who can be touched by
[48:26] the feelings of our infirmities amen and
[48:29] I'm thankful to have that high priest
[48:30] tonight that even while I've got things
[48:33] going on my in my life he is there
[48:35] interceding on my behalf amen the blood
[48:38] is still there the blood is still
[48:40] atoning and the blood is still moving
[48:41] and I'm very thankful for that amen but
[48:44] you know I know that when you want to
[48:46] receive something for the Lord amen one
[48:49] thing that is very important is how you
[48:51] approach him and how you come to him we
[48:53] don't come to him in arrogance that I
[48:55] don't have any need or or I know it all
[48:58] nor that'll never get anything from God
[49:00] but if you come to him in humility and
[49:02] and in faith amen it is faith that
[49:05] touches God you do not touch God by your
[49:07] feelings you did not touch God by what
[49:10] you think or how you think amen you only
[49:12] can touch the approach to God Is by
[49:15] faith amen and so brother Brandon would
[49:17] talk about that and he said that's the
[49:19] reason why we tell testimonies that's
[49:21] the way that's the reason why we tell
[49:23] the things that God has done because
[49:24] we're trying to get people in an
[49:26] attitude Amen to that will bring results
[49:29] Amen to an atmosphere or an attitude
[49:32] amen that brings results he said it is
[49:35] the attitude that always brings the
[49:37] results it's the attitude that you take
[49:40] towards God he said well here's a woman
[49:42] that touched His Garment and she was
[49:44] healed why because of her attitude of
[49:46] approach she humbled herself and came by
[49:50] faith and she said if I could only Touch
[49:52] the Hem of His Garment then I would be
[49:54] healed now there would be down the road
[49:56] somebody a soldier that would hit him in
[49:58] the face and he would never receive
[50:00] nothing from God because of his attitude
[50:03] amen but if you come with the attitude
[50:05] or the approach him in the right place
[50:07] God will meet you according to your need
[50:10] amen it's attitude that's what it takes
[50:12] and that's what it is tonight dear
[50:14] friend it takes attitude we are and we
[50:17] believe that we are in the presence of
[50:19] Jesus Christ but it is your attitude
[50:21] that brings the results the mechanics
[50:24] are here and the Dynamics are here but
[50:26] if our attitude to receive is not there
[50:29] God cannot do anything for us but if we
[50:32] can get ourselves in the right place God
[50:34] will always answer our need God will
[50:36] reach down and touch our hearts amen
[50:39] amen we see this woman had an issue for
[50:41] some years and and it seemed like she
[50:44] had spent all that she had and she had
[50:46] given all she had and it wasn't a doctor
[50:48] that could do anything for her amen but
[50:51] she had heard how Jesus had healed and
[50:53] how Jesus had delivered now if you read
[50:55] this whole context of this story Jesus
[50:58] is actually and just got off a boat and
[51:00] he's on his way to jairus's house but in
[51:03] the middle of her him being on the way
[51:05] to another house amen she said this is
[51:08] my opportunity amen that's where you got
[51:10] to come in a service that you have to
[51:12] take the services this is my service
[51:15] this is my time he may be going at
[51:18] another Direction but do you know that
[51:20] you can pull God right to where you are
[51:22] amen by the attitude that you have
[51:24] tonight you can push him away or you can
[51:27] pull him to you amen he may be going
[51:30] down a certain direction and he may have
[51:31] anointed a man to speak a certain thing
[51:33] but all of a sudden because of the
[51:35] attitude that you come in to receive
[51:37] amen the notes begin to change things
[51:40] begin to pull a certain direction why
[51:42] because you're actually pulling what you
[51:44] have need of out of the gift of God Amen
[51:47] and we see here now now naturally you
[51:49] know it can be in in blood you know we
[51:52] know blood is the life of the body and
[51:53] if you get a bad wound today you can
[51:56] bleed out or if you get a stoppage
[51:58] inside your body in one of your veins
[52:00] amen that can cause death As We Know by
[52:02] a heart attack or or stroke or different
[52:04] things I mean amen see spiritually Satan
[52:07] is trying to stop the blood of the flow
[52:10] of blood he's trying to stop the blood
[52:13] from flowing Amen to come and atone for
[52:16] your need and for your situation so
[52:18] therefore if he can stop it by changing
[52:20] your thoughts to where you think you
[52:22] know this service may not be for me I I
[52:24] shouldn't have come he's stopping the
[52:26] blood flow but if you can change that
[52:29] and come again with the attitude amen
[52:32] the blood will begin to flow and God can
[52:34] touch your heart and touch your need
[52:36] amen so spiritually Satan is always
[52:39] trying to stop the flow of the blood now
[52:41] we know as we said it would take three
[52:43] elements to make a body it takes blood
[52:45] water blood and spirit and so Satan can
[52:48] come and pervert any one of these or
[52:50] stop any one of these amen the body will
[52:52] die so Satan will try to do all he can
[52:55] to cause an issue with one or more of
[52:58] these elements and so he'll try to stop
[53:00] the blood or he'll try to stop the water
[53:02] or he'll he'll he'll try to wound the
[53:04] spirit whatever he can to keep you from
[53:07] receiving something from God Amen so so
[53:10] as we said we all tonight have issues in
[53:12] our lives every one of us it doesn't
[53:14] matter how far along you are in this
[53:16] journey but remember you will never
[53:18] touch God by your issue you will never
[53:21] touch him by fear you will never touch
[53:23] him by worry or you'll never Church
[53:26] touch God out of a hurt you will only be
[53:29] able to touch God by faith amen you know
[53:32] there's another writing of this story in
[53:34] The Book of Mark and it's pretty amazing
[53:37] that account as well there's there's
[53:38] five actually action words that they put
[53:41] in here that this woman did it says the
[53:43] woman heard she said she came she
[53:46] touched she felt
[53:49] all right that's in the order she heard
[53:51] about Jesus she said if I could only
[53:54] touch His Garment she came to where he
[53:56] was at she touched him and then she felt
[53:59] the blood issue stop now many times we
[54:02] want the feeling first before we get to
[54:04] all the other ones but that's not the
[54:06] way it goes amen you have to hear
[54:09] hearing comes by the faith comes by
[54:11] hearing hearing the word of God Amen and
[54:15] you she heard that Jesus had done many
[54:17] great things and therefore from that
[54:19] hearing she began to speak amen Faith
[54:22] began to flow out of her life amen Faith
[54:25] begin to go and and and we know you know
[54:28] when you begin to speak what you've
[54:30] heard amen Faith begins to be ignited
[54:33] that's why it's so powerful to tell
[54:35] testimonies because you hear God is a
[54:38] God not just of yesterday but he's a god
[54:40] of today and Faith begins to work in
[54:43] your life and then you can begin to
[54:44] respond not out of fear or out of
[54:47] failures or out of hurts or past
[54:49] mistakes but you can begin to respond
[54:52] out of faith and faith will always speak
[54:55] the word of God amen amen faith will not
[54:59] speak your hurt it will not speak your
[55:01] past it will not speak your failures
[55:03] faith will only speak the word of God
[55:06] Amen once you have faith your mouth will
[55:10] begin to speak amen out of the abundance
[55:12] of your heart therefore you begin to say
[55:14] this situation will not destroy me this
[55:18] situation will not determine my
[55:20] destination this situation will not
[55:23] Define me amen but I will overcome I
[55:26] will rise above it because why that's
[55:29] what the word said and therefore your
[55:31] faith begins to speak what the word says
[55:33] though therefore Faith actually changes
[55:36] your vocabulary
[55:39] amen where one time used to speak
[55:41] failures Faith begins to speak amen the
[55:44] word of God that's why it's very
[55:46] important never you will never touch God
[55:49] by fear of failure you will never touch
[55:51] God by saying well I'm just going to be
[55:53] what my parents were or I you know if I
[55:56] get married I'm going to end up just
[55:57] like they were and well you know that's
[55:59] that's not speaking out of Faith but
[56:02] faith will come always back to the word
[56:04] of God Amen that's where that's where
[56:07] we're based on so if you stop speaking
[56:09] in Doom and Agony and you begin to agree
[56:12] with what God Said Amen he said if you
[56:15] speak to this mountain it shall be moved
[56:18] but this mountain is not going to be
[56:20] moved by fear it's not going to be moved
[56:23] by past hurts it's not going to be moved
[56:25] by agonies and and all those things fat
[56:28] this mountain will only be moved by
[56:30] faith amen Cycles will not be broken by
[56:35] fear Cycles will be broken by faith
[56:38] disciples will not be broken by the past
[56:41] or what's what's happened over here or
[56:43] this over there or this fear this word
[56:45] no it'll never break a cycle but what
[56:48] will break a cycle is Faith because
[56:50] faith will look at that cycle and say
[56:52] that's not me I am standing on the word
[56:55] of God
[56:57] amen so Proverbs 23 says as you think
[57:00] that's what you become if you think
[57:03] you're defeated If You Think You're
[57:05] Lonely if you think everyone's against
[57:07] you that's what will become of your life
[57:11] amen so you got to change all of that
[57:13] and quit thinking about what how the
[57:16] devil thinks of you and start thinking
[57:18] how God thought of you amen because he
[57:21] said my thoughts are higher than your
[57:23] thoughts and my ways are higher than
[57:25] your ways so God is not thinking of you
[57:28] defeated God is thinking of you of being
[57:31] overcoming God is not thinking of you
[57:33] sick he is thinking of you healed God is
[57:37] not thinking of you bound he is thinking
[57:39] of you delivered
[57:41] amen so you're with your faith amen must
[57:44] come out of your mouth
[57:46] and you begin to speak words of Faith
[57:48] amen if you keep speaking Doom that's
[57:51] exactly what's going to happen to you
[57:55] we need to begin with faith
[57:57] even if we're not feeling it
[58:01] she wasn't feeling it when she said if I
[58:03] can just Touch the Hem of His Garment
[58:07] she was feeling still the blood flow she
[58:10] was feeling the weakness of her body
[58:11] maybe she barely could drag herself up
[58:14] there and that's all she could find you
[58:16] know there was something there amen but
[58:18] she spoke out in faith she said if I can
[58:21] just Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll
[58:24] be made whole
[58:25] now Hendrick says she had all kinds of
[58:27] hindrances there was all kinds of
[58:29] distractions in that service
[58:32] come on somebody it was all kind of
[58:35] other noises and things that was taken
[58:37] that could take her attention off but
[58:39] she began to get zoned in on one thing I
[58:42] got to get to Jesus
[58:44] Hallelujah I believe that ought to be
[58:46] our call every time we come to the
[58:48] church that'll be wild our hearts cry if
[58:50] I don't get nothing else out of this
[58:52] service I want one thing I want to get
[58:55] to Jesus if I can just get to him he'll
[58:58] rewrite my life if I can just get to him
[59:01] I'll be healed if I can just get to him
[59:04] my past will be forgiven if I can just
[59:06] get to Jesus that's all that matters
[59:10] and let me say this he's worth getting
[59:12] to
[59:15] Hallelujah he's worth letting all the
[59:17] distractions leave you and you get zoned
[59:20] in and say hey I'm here for one reason I
[59:22] ain't here to look at what this one's
[59:24] doing or what that one's doing or how
[59:26] many times this one gets up to go to the
[59:27] bathroom I'm not even worried about that
[59:30] I'm looking for one thing I'm looking
[59:32] for Jesus to come by and when he does
[59:35] I'm going to touch him
[59:40] Hallelujah
[59:42] but it begins with faith it doesn't
[59:45] begin with your feeling
[59:47] because if if the if what you got out of
[59:51] a service always depending on if you
[59:53] felt good
[59:54] you were 90 percent of the time probably
[59:57] never get anything out of a service
[59:59] matter of fact they said that today I've
[1:00:01] been battling sickness in my body do I
[1:00:04] feel like being up here no
[1:00:07] that's not but I'm not here by my
[1:00:09] feelings I'm here by the faith of
[1:00:11] almighty God
[1:00:13] amen so we don't come by our feelings we
[1:00:16] come by faith
[1:00:19] amen
[1:00:20] Hallelujah so we see here even though
[1:00:24] you know think about the shunabite woman
[1:00:25] when she came and her child had died and
[1:00:28] she goes out to find the prophet and
[1:00:30] she's a long ways off and he sees her
[1:00:32] coming and he tells the servant go ask
[1:00:34] her if her house is well if she is well
[1:00:37] in her house as well and he comes and
[1:00:39] asks her that and what's her response
[1:00:41] all is well
[1:00:43] because why I've got to where I need to
[1:00:46] be
[1:00:48] hello somebody that's when you know a
[1:00:51] service as well because you got to where
[1:00:53] you need to be
[1:00:54] amen you got more than just to appeal or
[1:00:57] or to a place but you got to the feet of
[1:01:00] Jesus Amen who can answer the questions
[1:01:02] in your life who can help you who can
[1:01:04] raise the Dead who can do all things if
[1:01:07] we can just get to Jesus that's all that
[1:01:10] matters
[1:01:17] so Elijah's would take until geez I go
[1:01:20] take my staff and go lay it upon the
[1:01:23] child because he knew whatever he
[1:01:25] touched when he had been had the
[1:01:28] anointing the spirit of God on him that
[1:01:29] was blessed he said I think that's
[1:01:31] exactly what Paul did he took pieces off
[1:01:34] of his off of him from office from the
[1:01:36] hankers and uh handkerchiefs and aprons
[1:01:38] and things off his body and went lady
[1:01:40] they went and laid it on people and they
[1:01:42] were healed of diseases and things he
[1:01:44] said some people touch the Garment of
[1:01:46] Jesus and was made well others smacked
[1:01:49] him in the face and hit him on the head
[1:01:51] with sticks and spit in his face and
[1:01:53] they never felt one virtue at all but it
[1:01:56] was their attitude approach it depends
[1:01:58] on what attitude you come in is what
[1:02:01] you're going to receive
[1:02:04] if you can't believe and that you're
[1:02:06] coming to get help you're confident
[1:02:08] you're coming to the right place Jesus
[1:02:10] Christ your coming his provided way of
[1:02:13] approach you're going to receive
[1:02:15] something if you come that way
[1:02:16] reverently if you come and say well if I
[1:02:19] go touch and see if it helps me it won't
[1:02:21] do you a bit of good at all it's your
[1:02:23] approach to God's Divine article that's
[1:02:26] what doesn't
[1:02:30] just like the brass serpent the breast
[1:02:32] serpent didn't have no virtue in it it
[1:02:34] was just a piece of brass neither the
[1:02:37] pole but by obeying what God said that's
[1:02:40] what brought the answer that's what
[1:02:42] brought the virtue is obedience to the
[1:02:45] word of God and that is the same thing
[1:02:48] tonight
[1:02:49] if we can bring our issues and lay it
[1:02:52] out his feet and say God I just want to
[1:02:54] touch you that's all I care about
[1:02:58] to take care of the issues
[1:03:00] but you got to move past obstacles you
[1:03:02] got to get in the spirit of receiving
[1:03:07] hello somebody you got to get in the
[1:03:10] spirit of receiving therefore you got to
[1:03:13] let distractions and services just fall
[1:03:15] to the Wayside you got to let critics be
[1:03:18] critics
[1:03:19] just let them be who they are they got a
[1:03:22] fulfilled scripture just like we got a
[1:03:24] full school for Judas has to be there
[1:03:30] so don't get involved with getting in a
[1:03:32] fight with critics they are doing what
[1:03:33] they're supposed to do
[1:03:37] get in the spirit to receive something
[1:03:39] from God
[1:03:42] well you know I just ain't in the mood
[1:03:44] well let's change the mood
[1:03:47] hey man you got to push sometimes it
[1:03:50] ain't easy every service every service
[1:03:52] ain't a flowery bed of ease and it's
[1:03:54] just a uh
[1:03:57] happy-go-lucky service and boy the
[1:03:59] blessings are flowing and the things are
[1:04:01] happening this is popping and that's
[1:04:03] going on no sometimes you it's a
[1:04:05] sacrifice
[1:04:07] you got to pull yourself up by the
[1:04:09] bootstraps and say I'm I'm going to
[1:04:11] church
[1:04:12] some of you fought like oh get out to
[1:04:14] get here so let's don't get here and
[1:04:16] lose out on what we came for
[1:04:17] [Applause]
[1:04:19] amen we get so tired of the fight
[1:04:21] sometimes and we get so weird we come
[1:04:23] here and ah wow now while we're here
[1:04:26] let's get what we have need of let's get
[1:04:30] something from him he has some virtue he
[1:04:32] wants to give out
[1:04:34] he has some healing he wants to give out
[1:04:36] he has some Deliverance he wants to give
[1:04:38] out he has some power breaking chain
[1:04:41] amen chain breaking power he wants to
[1:04:44] give out
[1:04:51] but you got to get in the spirit to
[1:04:53] receive and then there's some things you
[1:04:54] got to do
[1:04:55] you know he talks about the prophet of
[1:04:57] God he said one time the kings came to
[1:05:00] him Jehoshaphat had joined himself up
[1:05:02] with some backslidden people and and
[1:05:05] then and he he said they couldn't find
[1:05:08] water and they got enough trouble and
[1:05:10] they come there to the prophet he said
[1:05:13] that he said that genuine Prophet wanted
[1:05:15] to tell him off
[1:05:17] he wanted to tell him why you come here

[1:06:45] somebody said something to that order he
[1:06:47] said I know those songs wasn't back
[1:06:48] there but something like that he said
[1:06:50] and the prophet all of a sudden they'll
[1:06:52] begin to hum and Pat his foot after a
[1:06:55] little while what was it doing he was
[1:06:57] getting in the spirit to receive
[1:07:00] amen if a prophet has to do that how
[1:07:02] much more should we have to do that
[1:07:04] because we come all out of sorts I know
[1:07:07] how it is amen the devil sometimes will
[1:07:09] leave you alone you know the world says
[1:07:11] Monday morning's bad you know the worst
[1:07:13] mornings for a Believer Sunday morning
[1:07:15] and a Wednesday evening
[1:07:17] amen the devil is coming on every side
[1:07:20] to try to hinder you to try to stop you
[1:07:22] to try to get that moment blocked to
[1:07:25] stop the blood flow and when you see
[1:07:27] that happening that's when you need to
[1:07:29] push harder
[1:07:31] that ain't the time to push by pull back
[1:07:33] that's the time to push forward and say
[1:07:35] no the enemy's trying to stop something
[1:07:37] let's settle ourselves for a moment
[1:07:39] let's grab an instrument amen let's get
[1:07:42] some people that's anointed to sing the
[1:07:44] word of God and play the instruments and
[1:07:46] let's get to singing and clapping our
[1:07:48] half what is it we are getting in the
[1:07:50] spirit to receive something from God
[1:07:57] so that he can be touched
[1:08:03] see if you want to be touched by him you
[1:08:05] have to touch him
[1:08:11] did you hear me
[1:08:13] if you want to be touched by him you
[1:08:16] have to touch him
[1:08:22] amen
[1:08:23] he's at Sea that's what's the matter
[1:08:25] with the church that's what's the matter
[1:08:27] with this meeting if you can't get in
[1:08:29] the spirit you won't see nothing
[1:08:33] there were so many others that was there
[1:08:35] and they went in the spirit to receive
[1:08:37] what she received and they no doubt had
[1:08:39] just as much need as she had
[1:08:42] but how many are Unwritten about
[1:08:47] think about that here's Jairus and
[1:08:50] here's this woman how many others were
[1:08:52] around there that had just as much need
[1:08:54] but they're not even written about
[1:08:55] because they wasn't willing to let all
[1:08:58] that stuff go and touch him
[1:09:06] amen
[1:09:07] you have to get in the spirit of it
[1:09:09] before you can see it
[1:09:11] he said you people that used to go to
[1:09:13] dances he said I don't believe you and
[1:09:14] do it now since you're a Christian but
[1:09:16] when you used to you used to have all
[1:09:18] have to play all the music and carry on
[1:09:20] everything get in the spirit of dancing
[1:09:22] when you went to ball games somebody had
[1:09:25] to hit a home run before you throwed the
[1:09:26] hats in the air and screamed and
[1:09:28] hollered and it was all right for you
[1:09:30] then but a fella didn't believe much in
[1:09:31] ball games he just stood there and
[1:09:33] couldn't see nothing to it he wasn't in
[1:09:35] the spirit of it and he said that's the
[1:09:37] reason you come around an old-fashioned
[1:09:39] meeting where they got good salvation
[1:09:41] and they go to holler and amen and
[1:09:43] praising the Lord and you say that's a
[1:09:45] bunch of Fanatics he says because you're
[1:09:47] not in the spirit of it he said if this
[1:09:50] is the holy spirit then that other thing
[1:09:52] must be the Unholy spirit this makes you
[1:09:54] do what holy things that makes you do
[1:09:56] Unholy things amen a woman said one time
[1:09:59] well Billy I understand you've got some
[1:10:01] new kind of religion he said what kind
[1:10:02] is that he said them kind the people
[1:10:04] they make some people shout and dance
[1:10:06] and go on I said well that's a new kind
[1:10:09] that's the only kind there ever should
[1:10:11] be that's the oldest religious that
[1:10:13] religion there ever was

[1:10:18] before he said well what about when job

[1:10:23] was you when I laid the foundation of
[1:10:25] the world tell me what they're fasting

[1:10:36] had a shouting religion
[1:10:40] Hallelujah then talk and then talk about
[1:10:43] something new that's the oldest that
[1:10:46] there ever was
[1:10:48] so if your religion is not a shouting

[1:11:33] of a young mother
[1:11:36] who was in some severe depression there
[1:11:39] in those meetings in Ohio
[1:11:42] to the point where her thoughts was
[1:11:44] turning my family don't need me she's
[1:11:47] having to take medicines and things to
[1:11:49] try to control things because she was
[1:11:51] diving so deep into darkness
[1:11:54] and and and she was just going down a
[1:11:57] real real real deep dark path
[1:12:02] suicide on everything and every thought
[1:12:05] seemed like and just writing even notes
[1:12:10] she comes to that meeting on a Saturday
[1:12:12] night
[1:12:14] and she uh
[1:12:16] comes up to the prayer line I remember
[1:12:18] her coming through and she said I just
[1:12:20] need another real dose of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:22] I I just need to I need a renewing
[1:12:26] so we pray for her and God moves on her
[1:12:29] life and she goes over there and you
[1:12:31] know what the devil puts in her mind
[1:12:32] well why ain't you shouting like the
[1:12:34] rest of them Shout
[1:12:35] why why ain't that happening for you and
[1:12:38] she said well you know that had never
[1:12:39] been on me like that before and she said
[1:12:42] so I just kind of turned it on him I
[1:12:44] said well I know God just gave me
[1:12:46] something regardless if am I shouting or
[1:12:48] not I'm just going to still going to
[1:12:49] thank him for it so she Praises him

[1:12:54] Sunday Sunday morning I actually
[1:12:55] preached on a let's let's make this a
[1:12:58] good fight and I dealt and I knew the
[1:13:00] Lord was moving very directly towards
[1:13:02] suicide and depression and brother Ray
[1:13:04] Erickson mentioned it to me afterwards
[1:13:06] he said I don't know if I've ever seen a
[1:13:07] sermon so directed towards that Darkness
[1:13:10] like that and you just kept calling it
[1:13:12] out and kept hitting at it and kept and
[1:13:14] kept hitting that direction he said I I
[1:13:17] I wonder what that was about we just
[1:13:19] talked about it like that we didn't know
[1:13:20] we hadn't heard this yet and here this
[1:13:22] sister sitting back there and we began

[1:13:32] for me I said I got one you broke
[1:13:34] depression off my life that's what
[1:13:37] you've done for me and she said at that
[1:13:39] moment her hands were up in the air and
[1:13:42] she began to dance and Shout she said I
[1:13:43] was one of those wild women like the
[1:13:45] rest of them
[1:13:47] so the power of God fell on her and she
[1:13:50] began to dance and shout and today
[1:13:52] medicines are being taken off her
[1:13:55] thoughts have changed the sun is shining
[1:13:57] the birds are seeing amen what happened
[1:14:00] God changed it all in the moment she got
[1:14:03] to Jesus
[1:14:07] and if I could just Touch the Hem of His
[1:14:09] Garment I'll be made whole
[1:14:18] amen so they got to play in the music
[1:14:22] and got it to going real good
[1:14:24] I I like that in fact the day I was
[1:14:27] listening This Means War
[1:14:32] and none doesn't nothing does my heart

[1:14:40] sent a little clip to Joe today I didn't
[1:14:41] know he wasn't gonna be here tonight I
[1:14:43] know he's traveling already but I sent
[1:14:45] the clip to him with that first first
[1:14:46] part of that service I'd sent that to
[1:14:48] brother Mike brother Mike had that other
[1:14:50] song on his heart and so in which God
[1:14:52] used powerfully stay
[1:14:54] and he used it in his last meeting as
[1:14:56] well it's just it's amazing what God has
[1:14:58] done through that music and that song
[1:15:00] Amen but he said how am I going to work
[1:15:02] this into that and and so he had brother
[1:15:04] Colby started out and brother Colby gets
[1:15:06] to go and all of a sudden that door
[1:15:07] opens and how the door Joe comes to
[1:15:10] dancing out of it I said well I said get
[1:15:12] it started Joe that's the way we got to
[1:15:14] do it hey man it came with an attitude
[1:15:16] to receive amen but it does nothing does
[1:15:18] me more good in that end of that so as
[1:15:21] they sing in that song again to see
[1:15:23] brother Ron Spencer up there shouting
[1:15:25] and praising God and thanking God for
[1:15:28] his healing and what God's doing Amen

[1:15:31] over the building amen that's that's
[1:15:33] what it takes you got to get into the
[1:15:35] spirit to receive

[1:15:40] going to be War let's make it a good War
[1:15:43] let's make it a good fight amen let's
[1:15:46] push on into the things of God and this
[1:15:48] he said he'd gotten the spirit and then
[1:15:51] he began to see things
[1:15:54] he began to see more than the faults
[1:15:56] that were around him
[1:15:59] he began to see more than the
[1:16:01] backsliders that were around him and the
[1:16:03] other sessions with the situation that
[1:16:05] was around him amen he began to see what
[1:16:08] God saw
[1:16:11] that's what faith is is what God sees
[1:16:20] you say well oh brother Branham way well
[1:16:22] that's what they did on the day of
[1:16:24] Pentecost they all stayed there and
[1:16:26] prayed till they got in the spirit and
[1:16:28] then they got filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:30] and run out and act like a bunch of
[1:16:31] drunk people religious people of the
[1:16:33] world stood and said these men are drunk
[1:16:35] all of them together even Virgin Mary
[1:16:37] and all of them was together said
[1:16:39] they're drunk on new wine he said well
[1:16:41] what was it they had got in the spirit
[1:16:43] that's what we need today is an
[1:16:46] old-fashioned shaking down God said holy
[1:16:49] ghost Revival then you can have healing
[1:16:51] Services then you have indecent in order
[1:16:54] God will bless the altars will be full
[1:16:56] you don't need some new theology you
[1:16:59] need the Holy Spirit priest and power
[1:17:01] through Simplicity it's the greatest
[1:17:04] drawing card the world has ever had
[1:17:08] thank you
[1:17:10] Elisha was getting in the spirit
[1:17:13] then the Visions begin to come he said
[1:17:16] thus saith the Lord go out and start
[1:17:18] digging some ditches get ready for a
[1:17:21] whole lot of water
[1:17:25] so depending on how much water you get
[1:17:27] it's depending on how much ditch you dig
[1:17:31] how much you're willing to put yourself
[1:17:33] through in sacrifice amen that's how
[1:17:36] much blessing you're going to receive
[1:17:39] it ain't all dependent on God it's
[1:17:42] dependent on you
[1:17:43] amen he wants to do more for you even
[1:17:46] exceedingly abundantly more than you can
[1:17:48] even think or ask so if you're dead got
[1:17:51] a feel if your dick gotta feel if your
[1:17:54] dick gonna feel gonna move through
[1:17:56] everything he wants to give you the Holy
[1:17:58] Ghost more than you want to receive it
[1:18:01] he wants to give you more of himself
[1:18:03] more than you want it
[1:18:12] get to dig in there
[1:18:14] well he said listen
[1:18:17] dig some ditches you're not going to see
[1:18:20] a cloud
[1:18:21] you're not going to hear rain
[1:18:23] you know you don't have to get no degree
[1:18:24] or go to some Seminary but you're going
[1:18:27] to get some water
[1:18:28] you don't have to join some organization
[1:18:30] you don't have to join some church if
[1:18:32] you want water start digging I can see
[1:18:35] them get started digging some fella hit
[1:18:37] the ground a couple times said wow this
[1:18:40] is rough I'm just going to sit over here
[1:18:41] and let somebody else do it you won't
[1:18:43] get no water
[1:18:46] amen there's a reason why you got to dig
[1:18:48] because there's some testimonies to dig
[1:18:51] out of there amen you go he said if you
[1:18:53] quit digging you ain't gonna get no
[1:18:54] water every man had to dig his own
[1:18:57] spring
[1:18:59] hello somebody amen every person is
[1:19:03] responsible for themselves what they get
[1:19:06] out of a service
[1:19:08] so you can't get mad at the song leader
[1:19:10] or at this one or that one it is on you
[1:19:15] amen it's not because there wasn't a
[1:19:17] certain song song you didn't get
[1:19:19] something there wasn't a certain thing
[1:19:20] preached that you didn't get something
[1:19:21] he was preaching to jairus's house
[1:19:25] but she said this is my moment this is
[1:19:29] my time this is my service this is for
[1:19:33] me
[1:19:36] see we bring our shovels for the wrong
[1:19:37] reason we bring the shovel to take
[1:19:39] what's said and throw it on somebody
[1:19:41] else you bring a shovel you need to
[1:19:43] bring one to church but that's the dig a
[1:19:45] ditch
[1:19:47] I'm gonna you're not throwing dirt on
[1:19:49] nobody else no you're just digging a
[1:19:51] hole and you're just getting ready to
[1:19:53] receive as we heard about that woman who
[1:19:55] went and got many vessels amen according
[1:19:57] to the vessels that's what she received
[1:19:59] according to what you dig out and what
[1:20:02] you say well I want God to feel every
[1:20:04] fiber then start digging what blocking
[1:20:06] it out of your life and dig it out
[1:20:09] sometimes it's a root of bitterness and
[1:20:11] it goes through all kind of fibers of
[1:20:13] your life and it takes a long time to
[1:20:15] root that thing out but it's worth
[1:20:17] rooting out
[1:20:19] sometimes it's an unforgiving spirit and
[1:20:21] you allow it to lay there and you got
[1:20:23] all against your mother your daddy or
[1:20:25] this that and the other and you're so
[1:20:26] unforgiving and you're about you're just
[1:20:28] a dried up old prune why because you
[1:20:30] haven't dug it out therefore the water
[1:20:33] can't get to where it needs to get to
[1:20:40] he said whether somebody
[1:20:43] hits a big old tin can so what's this
[1:20:45] well it says there's no such a thing as
[1:20:47] Divine Healing kick that thing out
[1:20:51] make room for water
[1:20:53] keep on digging
[1:20:55] somebody hits another Tin Can says we
[1:20:57] can't you ain't got you shouldn't have
[1:20:58] altar calls no more kick that thing out
[1:21:02] don't tell me I've seen God move too
[1:21:04] much at Alters
[1:21:06] and besides all that altar ink just for
[1:21:08] people to come and repent an altar is a
[1:21:11] place of washing
[1:21:12] it's a place of worship
[1:21:14] it's a place of laying yourself down and
[1:21:17] kneeling at his feet so you can Touch
[1:21:19] the Hem of His Garment
[1:21:21] amen it ain't all about well look at
[1:21:23] that one they're up there at the altar
[1:21:24] again oh I'm as long as they get what
[1:21:26] they come for
[1:21:28] that's all that matters
[1:21:33] kick it out yeah God don't use prayer
[1:21:36] lines no more that's a lie
[1:21:39] what about that girl just testify what
[1:21:41] if we didn't have that
[1:21:43] what if we just had an old dried up
[1:21:45] stump of a service and she sat back
[1:21:46] there she'd probably be dead by now
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:54] kick that thing out keep on digging
[1:21:59] don't believe in Divine Healing the
[1:22:01] power of God get room in there so you
[1:22:03] can get some more water the deeper you
[1:22:06] dig the more water you have get all the
[1:22:07] doubt all the unbelief things away from
[1:22:10] you and when the showers begin to come
[1:22:11] down to the valley you'll get a big
[1:22:14] portion of it
[1:22:16] you'll get a little well like that
[1:22:18] that's all you can have I he said I like
[1:22:20] to go Plum over my head
[1:22:23] thank you
[1:22:25] you know what Plum over your head means
[1:22:27] that means you have lost all control of
[1:22:29] your you can't you can't hit the ground
[1:22:31] no more amen you can't you know
[1:22:36] when you get in waters you can swim in
[1:22:39] and that's all you can do
[1:22:41] that's some different kind of waters and
[1:22:42] Waters right up to here or Waters to
[1:22:45] your ankles or Waters up to your waist
[1:22:47] or water's up to your chest when you get
[1:22:49] to a place that you can't hit bottom
[1:22:50] that's a whole different kind of water
[1:22:53] and that's why people don't want to let
[1:22:55] go they're afraid they won't be able to
[1:22:56] hit bottom they're afraid that they they
[1:22:58] won't be able to control what's about to
[1:23:00] happen they will they're afraid they'll
[1:23:02] lose all control listen if you're giving
[1:23:04] it to him who cares he's the one in
[1:23:06] control
[1:23:07] amen that's why we sing the song let go
[1:23:10] and let God have his way amen it ain't
[1:23:13] let go and we worry about this or that
[1:23:14] no we're letting ourselves go Amen to
[1:23:17] what we think and how we think of
[1:23:19] service ought to go and how we think it
[1:23:20] ought to be and how how we think it
[1:23:22] ought to be orchestrated and how we
[1:23:23] think think think and we're getting
[1:23:25] beyond what we think where we can't
[1:23:27] stand on no more what we think we can
[1:23:30] only we're in waters we can swim in he
[1:23:33] said I like to get over my head so I can
[1:23:35] swim in the goodness of God get all the
[1:23:38] old kettles and all the old rocks and
[1:23:40] the stumps out of the way well now if I
[1:23:42] get saved what will I do well you get
[1:23:44] saved went over and got the Holy Spirit
[1:23:45] the first thing you know you dug down
[1:23:47] and said ten percent of the church on my
[1:23:49] throw it out of the way get room for
[1:23:51] more water keep digging make a big well
[1:23:54] where God can really baptize you with
[1:23:57] the Holy Spirit and fix you right
[1:24:04] he wants to fix every issue
[1:24:10] you're not going to see any clouds
[1:24:12] you won't have to do this you won't have
[1:24:14] to have a new theology but you're going
[1:24:16] to get water anyhow
[1:24:18] where did that water come from it ain't
[1:24:21] going to rain out of the heavens it
[1:24:23] ain't going to be artificially made but
[1:24:25] there's going to be water there through
[1:24:27] the supernatural
[1:24:30] this won't be a man-made rain
[1:24:33] sprinkler
[1:24:40] and the service depends on that man
[1:24:42] whether he had a good day or not
[1:24:44] whether he feels like preaching or not
[1:24:50] no it ain't dependent on man this is a
[1:24:53] supernatural reign
[1:24:57] amen Jesus Christ is moving now through
[1:25:00] the church he said do you know the
[1:25:02] children of Israel passed right through
[1:25:03] that same Wilderness and the rock that
[1:25:06] was in the wilderness when they passed
[1:25:07] was still there
[1:25:10] oh my the one that gave water Jesus
[1:25:12] Christ was in the church in this church
[1:25:14] last night he's still the same church
[1:25:16] tonight in the same church Jesus is the
[1:25:19] same Christ tonight in the same church
[1:25:21] just get to dig it get all the doubt out
[1:25:23] of your way get all the superstitions
[1:25:25] quit saying that it's so the devil quit
[1:25:27] talking about this throw it out of the
[1:25:29] way speak to the Rock and Waters will
[1:25:32] come forth
[1:25:37] they woke up the next morning
[1:25:39] and all those valleys of ditches were
[1:25:42] full of water
[1:25:44] and The Invasion came
[1:25:47] and God used that as ambushments against
[1:25:50] the enemy
[1:25:53] amen
[1:25:56] he used it as traps against the enemy
[1:26:01] amen see why the devil has been so
[1:26:03] easily coming into your house because
[1:26:04] he's been walking across dry land
[1:26:08] easily accessible
[1:26:10] and easily able to get to and easily
[1:26:13] able to defeat and easily able to bring
[1:26:16] down but if you'll dig enough ditches so
[1:26:19] the god of Heavens can fill it
[1:26:20] supernaturally with water next time he
[1:26:22] comes he won't find it so easy
[1:26:25] he'll find some entrapments there he'll
[1:26:28] find the spirit of the Living God the
[1:26:30] Living Waters of Life are flowing freely
[1:26:33] again he'll find that he can't walk
[1:26:35] where he used to walk he can't go where
[1:26:38] he used to go his this property is not
[1:26:40] accessible no more
[1:26:42] hallelujah amen he'll find it's not
[1:26:46] possible anymore I can't go to where I
[1:26:49] used to go
[1:26:53] because there's something there now
[1:26:55] he said we need to dig it all out of our
[1:26:58] heart
[1:26:58] all those old things that take somebody
[1:27:00] else's word beside God's word
[1:27:03] when Jesus Christ was then he is now he
[1:27:06] rose from the dead and he's moving even
[1:27:08] now he said see what happens you get all
[1:27:11] those tin cans and things out of the
[1:27:13] well and get a testimony in your hand
[1:27:18] you'll stop up some of these old formal
[1:27:21] whales around here that don't believe in
[1:27:23] Divine Healing and the power of God
[1:27:26] amen when you realize God's a
[1:27:28] supernatural God and now it ain't just
[1:27:31] somebody else's testimony but now it's
[1:27:33] your testimony
[1:27:35] how many whales have been stopped up
[1:27:37] amen of cancer that said I'll I'll eat
[1:27:40] you I'll beat you I'll tear you down but
[1:27:42] all of a sudden God raised up a
[1:27:43] testimony to put down on The Well of
[1:27:46] that devil and say no I got the power to
[1:27:48] heal cancer I got the power to raise the
[1:27:51] dead I got the power to heal alopecia
[1:27:54] and brain bleeds and undeveloped hips
[1:27:56] and bad eyeballs I got the power
[1:27:59] so therefore God gives you the power to
[1:28:02] go to where the enemy is and more every
[1:28:05] place
[1:28:08] come on somebody he's been writing on
[1:28:11] your walls defeated he's been writing on
[1:28:13] your walls that hey he'll never overcome
[1:28:15] he's been more in your testimony but now
[1:28:18] that the wall the whales have been dug
[1:28:20] and the supernatural has filled it then
[1:28:23] God has given you a testimony you have
[1:28:25] the right to go to his house and say
[1:28:27] defeated you don't have no power over me
[1:28:30] no more I have overcome
[1:28:33] I will rise above it all I will not be
[1:28:37] like who my mother was or who my father
[1:28:39] was that's not who I am
[1:28:45] foreign
[1:28:49] amen sister Elena tonight can walk up
[1:28:52] there with that rocket testimony and
[1:28:54] right on the Gates of Hell healed of
[1:28:57] cancer
[1:28:59] marred hell and showing that there's
[1:29:02] power over here amen there's five people
[1:29:04] here today that can walk and say
[1:29:06] delivered of tobacco delivered of
[1:29:09] alcohol delivered of all kinds of things
[1:29:11] delivered of lust and pornography write
[1:29:14] it down
[1:29:15] on the walls of hell and say I have been
[1:29:19] delivered
[1:29:28] it was the right kind of touch
[1:29:32] she pulled her Deliverance through that
[1:29:37] body
[1:29:39] her faith say notice he didn't turn to
[1:29:42] her and say my faith saved you
[1:29:44] my being here saved you no your faith
[1:29:49] saved you
[1:29:51] her attitude of approach
[1:29:56] this woman had a blood issue
[1:30:00] how many believes that God was in Christ
[1:30:03] amen a woman with a blood issue walked
[1:30:06] over and touched His Garment went back
[1:30:08] and here hit herself and even denied she
[1:30:11] touched him and Jesus said somebody
[1:30:13] touched me
[1:30:16] well he better say that at Services of
[1:30:19] the evening light
[1:30:20] somebody touched me
[1:30:23] virtue has left me
[1:30:26] Peter said well I mean everybody touched
[1:30:28] you what do you mean I mean they've been
[1:30:30] hitting on you and slapping you and
[1:30:32] bumping up against you he said but
[1:30:33] virtue is left
[1:30:35] feel weak
[1:30:38] he looked around all denied all the
[1:30:40] strength where it was going went right
[1:30:42] to that little woman
[1:30:45] Jesus didn't know who it was he was a
[1:30:47] man in human flesh he was a man but the
[1:30:49] woman had touched God through him
[1:30:55] and you touch him the same way
[1:31:00] listen to this Jesus's Corporal body is
[1:31:03] sitting right at the right hand of God
[1:31:04] in Majesty on high as a sent offer make
[1:31:07] an intercession then he then his spirit
[1:31:09] that was in the body has come back into
[1:31:11] the predestinated for ordained offices
[1:31:15] in the church
[1:31:17] that you touch God the same way through
[1:31:21] those bodies
[1:31:26] that's what I said wow
[1:31:29] wow you touched God the same way through
[1:31:32] those bodies not that they're in their
[1:31:34] own self but worthy and surely not but
[1:31:36] they don't stand in their own
[1:31:38] righteousness no they stand in the robe
[1:31:40] of the Lord Jesus it's his righteousness
[1:31:43] to declare his works that he is the same
[1:31:46] yesterday today and forever
[1:31:50] this is why he would say they shall lay
[1:31:52] hands upon the sick and they shall
[1:31:55] recover
[1:31:56] why because virtue is moving from one
[1:31:59] body to another
[1:32:01] and healing is being transformed for dry
[1:32:04] amen deliverances is being transferred
[1:32:07] amen the power to walk out of cells is
[1:32:10] being transferred
[1:32:17] we're not standing here as men in their
[1:32:19] own righteousness it's not about me it's
[1:32:22] about him
[1:32:24] but that's why it's important when you
[1:32:26] come to the house of God to have the
[1:32:29] right approach it's faith
[1:32:32] the notes may be going a certain
[1:32:34] direction but I promise you if faith is
[1:32:36] let loose it'll move
[1:32:41] how many times has brother Brandon been
[1:32:43] at a poor platform and the angel of the
[1:32:45] Lord he said you know what that is that
[1:32:47] or you you feel that presence that's the
[1:32:49] angel of the Lord and he would deal and
[1:32:51] he says now wait a minute he's left me
[1:32:53] and he gets to look and he begins to
[1:32:55] look he said oh there he is I heard him

[1:33:37] the corner somewhere but he'll find you
[1:33:39] out
