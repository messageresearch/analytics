[12:12] I just struck something with me and I
[12:15] called him and I said dumb what do you
[12:18] what are you doing this were you busy
[12:19] this week of y'all busy is anything
[12:22] going on he said no we're we're here as
[12:25] well just feel to come your way and
[12:27] that's to be alright he said well
[12:28] absolutely I'd be wonderful so before we
[12:31] know it we was in pawnee oklahoma and of
[12:34] course as we was getting close for the
[12:36] window texted me and said i'd love for
[12:38] you to speak on wednesday night looking
[12:42] for a looked at my wife and said this is
[12:44] what he's asking i said i sent by the
[12:47] window back of text it's a real window i
[12:49] said i didn't come prepared to speak is
[12:51] my anniversary and I'm just relaxing him
[12:54] and but I said IIIi don't have clothes
[12:57] for preaching I don't have notes for
[13:00] preach and I don't even have a Bible
[13:02] and he said what I don't matter we'd
[13:04] like to hear you preach anyway
[13:06] that's so welcome is that you preaching
[13:08] blue jeans.you preaching a t-shirt we
[13:10] don't care we just we just believe that
[13:13] we would love that we'd love to have you
[13:15] and so I said well we will see about it
[13:18] as we drove I just felt the Lord speak
[13:21] to me directly about a thought so we've
[13:24] stopped it so stores and picked up some
[13:26] clothes just bought my wife a new iPad
[13:29] her system had been broken so we found
[13:31] ones they would have get her one and so
[13:33] I was able through technology to bring
[13:35] my notes from my iPad over to hers and
[13:37] [Music]
[13:39] next thing I know I was standing in the
[13:41] middle of a sermon and I'm preaching and
[13:44] God is speaking directly to situations
[13:47] and God is doing everything but calling
[13:50] out names and he could have done that
[13:53] because as your Minister and sometimes
[13:55] you can see where things are going and
[13:56] how and you see in the other round sort
[13:59] of speaking and you can see who's
[14:01] receiving who's not and God dealt with
[14:05] situations so directly and so it was
[14:10] just a supernatural thing I wasn't
[14:12] supposed to be there as far as I was
[14:13] concerned but God knew different we got
[14:16] today brother John Andy's just this
[14:18] Monday dude called and said look as I
[14:21] was actually traveling up there Monday
[14:23] to there he was texting me said look I'm
[14:25] looking it may be coming with are you
[14:27] home this weekend is your dad home and
[14:29] and here we are he's here this weekend
[14:32] God's working straighten things we're in
[14:35] a supernatural moment let's don't miss
[14:37] it and then Thursday night as we was
[14:43] coming home we stopped there's me and my
[14:45] wife stopped just south of Little Rock
[14:47] there and got us a hotel late and was
[14:49] just about to turn the lights off and
[14:51] got the text of my mom in the situation
[14:53] from my dad and we horse hit our knees
[14:56] and begin to call out on the Lord and
[14:58] got up and I said let's throw her stuff
[15:00] in the truck let's go we gotta gotta get
[15:02] and cuz it was a you know this weekend
[15:04] my sisters or their husbands and
[15:06] Families we're all going to Branson as
[15:08] well and we're up there and
[15:11] dad was home by itself and so he took
[15:14] and left but each step of the way we
[15:17] have seen God moving miracles taking
[15:20] place God is doing some supernatural
[15:25] things and it ain't just because we see
[15:28] what we see and it's because we can see
[15:33] what can't be seen God has moved in even
[15:39] this week just getting the news of
[15:41] brother Vernon passing away but Vernon
[15:44] winters went to be with the Lord just
[15:47] last Sunday brother Tim telling of his
[15:49] testimony of how he came to the Lord and
[15:51] he drifted away but as his wife text dad
[15:55] today and just said I'm just so thankful
[15:57] that God gave him these three years to
[16:00] get back right with him said he had such
[16:04] a love for the Lord and I just don't
[16:06] want to be with him you know God no God
[16:09] will not lose one of his God doing some
[16:14] supernatural things and so as we think
[16:16] on these things and we see what we're
[16:18] what's happening around us let's just
[16:21] take a moment stand together take a
[16:25] moment of reflecting or silence for
[16:29] brother Vernon and the need there and
[16:32] his family wife without a husband
[16:35] children without a father just take a
[16:38] moment to remember this life understand
[16:42] that they're gonna just have a small
[16:44] memorial service for him at the close
[16:48] family and the things so
[16:50] assess the Lord to surround them this
[16:53] morning with his comfort in these coming
[16:56] weeks and times

[25:31] you as families can grab my hand
[25:33] Hanne arm-in-arm as we're sectioned off
[25:38] as families but we're not separated you
[25:44] know the devil wants to try to tell us
[25:45] we're separated we're buyers said we're
[25:47] not separated we're one heart one mind
[25:50] one body one spirit in the mind of
[25:56] Christ is in us and therefore we can
[25:59] believe things it's impossible we can
[26:01] speak things it's unimaginative the
[26:03] human mind because it's not our mind
[26:05] that speaks is his mind so I want you
[26:09] this morning to begin to open your mouth
[26:11] for your situation and begin to speak
[26:13] the Word of God and ask God that here
[26:16] the same yesterday today and forever
[26:18] you're my god and you don't change and
[26:22] I'm believing today that God is going to
[26:23] move in miraculous ways in every heart
[26:26] and every life I was just telling the
[26:30] brothers Airlines this this in the back
[26:32] I said I was listening to a tape last
[26:34] night brother Branham was talking about
[26:36] he said last night there was a lady
[26:38] sitting way in the back said many were
[26:40] sitting in the back and I couldn't get
[26:42] them to understand that God was speaking
[26:44] he said then God would call their name
[26:46] he said and there's this woman she was
[26:48] suffering with something and and she
[26:51] wouldn't understanding and I told her
[26:52] what was going on I told her what was
[26:54] happening she would not respond he said
[26:59] she was a Finnish woman she couldn't
[27:01] speak English he said then I heard my
[27:04] voice speak to her in her language and
[27:07] tell her what her problem was and what
[27:10] her name was he said why did God do that
[27:13] because God didn't want her left out
[27:17] [Music]
[27:19] god don't want you left out this morning
[27:22] and if he can speak every language he
[27:24] knows ever disease he knows every
[27:26] problem he knows every situation he
[27:29] coming to Europe you this morning very
[27:31] direct get ready for God to speak to you
[27:36] [Music]
[27:41] amen you believe this morning someone
[27:44] share this quote before we turn to
[27:46] prayer this isn't the message Jehovah
[27:47] Jireh 1957
[27:49] well Bram says every time that anyone
[27:51] takes God at His Word it's considered a
[27:54] fanatic in God asks notice God is asking
[27:58] you to believe the impossible because
[28:00] he's able to do that which is impossible
[28:03] abraham staggered not at the promise of
[28:06] God through unbelief but was strong
[28:08] giving praise unto God and God wants you
[28:11] to do the miraculous he wants you to
[28:14] believe the miraculous and by accepting
[28:17] it by faith you prove what you believe
[28:19] believe he is you see it God wants you
[28:22] to take him at his word he speaks it and
[28:25] if God has said it then all heavens and
[28:28] earth will pass away but his word can't
[28:31] pass away and I ask you this morning we
[28:34] got great knees just to care and that's
[28:35] a great need we've already seen God do
[28:38] the miraculous brother Ron there's a
[28:40] great need many of you have great needs
[28:42] in your family but God isn't asking you
[28:44] this morning will you believe for the
[28:46] impossible will you believe this morning
[28:50] if you'll believe for the impossible do
[28:51] you just throw your hand up and say I'm
[28:53] gonna believe I'm gonna bind together

[28:56] supernatural

[29:00] this morning you see the heart behind
[29:02] that hand nor not only that but you see

[40:21] Sunday morning service since for three
[40:22] and a half months hey man this is our
[40:25] time to come and visit you and we've had
[40:29] a lot of services on zoom' and teams and
[40:31] all that but we this is our first week
[40:33] to be in services like this so we we was
[40:36] with brother Nathan Brian on Wednesday
[40:38] Church in Louisville on Thursday and and
[40:41] we're with you on Sunday and none of
[40:43] this was even known or planned about
[40:45] last Sunday didn't even know we would
[40:48] come and be here we didn't get our
[40:50] ticket till Tuesday and so if anybody's
[40:53] been going through anything before
[40:55] Tuesday well that you musta knocked on
[40:56] the heart of God and then we didn't know
[40:59] this weekend was going to be a another
[41:02] time we'd go through with the Pruett
[41:04] family but the Lord must have known he
[41:06] did know he knows everything have you
[41:09] ever felt like you're walking in the
[41:11] vision but you don't really realize till
[41:14] God makes it no one to you well maybe
[41:16] come down today and make it knowing to
[41:18] somebody that you're in the vision
[41:20] you're in the vision hallelujah we're
[41:24] closer home greetings in the name of the
[41:27] Lord from our church in Cloverdale and
[41:30] I'm there's probably one streaming now
[41:32] and to many of you we don't want to
[41:35] start naming names but we're close to
[41:37] you over the years and we love your
[41:38] church and we love your pastor we've
[41:40] been able to be with him in the last few
[41:42] days and we just pray God's blessing
[41:45] upon the pastor and the first lady of
[41:47] this church here sister Karen amen
[41:49] hallelujah they've given their lives for
[41:53] you so surely we can say Lord be with
[41:55] them at this time and we're binding our
[41:57] hearts together
[41:59] well how's married life
[42:02] whether on Colley's you're doing alright
[42:05] Sadie sorry sister brother Jimmy how's
[42:08] married life can we give him a hand this
[42:11] morning they're here yeah brother
[42:19] Michael Dexter reminded me to just stop
[42:21] saying names don't say anybody's names
[42:23] and I get it wrong get it twisted but
[42:26] you know what I mean it's good to be in
[42:28] the house of the Lord and that we can
[42:30] let off the pressure and know that the
[42:32] Lord is here to speak to us we're gonna
[42:35] just in a moment have your stand and you
[42:41] know I'm a visiting minister here we
[42:43] stray most or services if not all of
[42:45] them and so we probably know you better
[42:47] than you know us but you know we could
[42:51] come and try to impress the pastor or
[42:53] these other fine brothers here but we've
[42:55] learned over the years that it's best
[42:57] just to mind the Lord and speak what he
[43:00] lays on your heart can we do that today
[43:02] so we're we gone beyond making everybody
[43:05] happy and trying to impress people we've
[43:07] got to come into a channel we don't know
[43:08] from one service to the next what's
[43:11] going to happen is that true and we're
[43:14] living in a very unbalanced age when
[43:18] nothing is balanced anymore we live in a
[43:21] wicked day we live in wicked states and
[43:24] countries in a world and we don't want
[43:27] the spirit of the world to influence our
[43:29] response to the Lord Jesus I mean we're
[43:31] one week closer to the rapture the bride
[43:33] ought to just be on the cutting edge of
[43:35] what the Spirit of God is saying and
[43:37] doing and what he would already say
[43:39] today he's already been working in your
[43:41] heart even if you're away from his
[43:44] presence he's already been working in
[43:46] your heart to come closer to him and so
[43:49] this morning we're gonna speak on rising
[43:52] from brokenness the essential generation
[43:58] and rising from brokenness I'm going to
[44:03] speak on that a little bit about
[44:05] brokenness and to be crushed to be
[44:13] bruised and to go through the grinder to
[44:15] be pained in your life to be broken but
[44:19] I'm speaking this morning on rising from
[44:22] that is that okay because we don't want
[44:25] to describe all the hurt and the pain
[44:27] and the misunderstanding
[44:31] we're here to rise up out of that so
[44:34] rising from brokenness and then to speak
[44:39] on the essential generation have you all
[44:43] heard the phrase in the last three
[44:44] months essential services who's heard
[44:47] that essential workers essential people
[44:50] who's heard that you know you know
[44:53] nurses doctors of the people that
[44:55] business they're essential they're
[44:56] essential and if you're not essential
[44:58] then you stay home stay at home orders
[45:00] you know and you're not essential well
[45:02] the world's telling us we're not
[45:03] essential and God is telling us we are
[45:05] essential this morning you are essential
[45:10] that means the essence essential comes
[45:13] from the essence or the essence or the
[45:15] center the reason of the heart of God
[45:18] brother Branham talked about if you want
[45:21] to do something good for me do it for my
[45:23] family
[45:23] do it for my children I'm preaching
[45:26] today for the children of God God likes
[45:30] that I'm sure to minister to the Pruett
[45:33] family brother Tim loves that he's
[45:37] streaming from the hospital right now
[45:40] he loves that but I'm here to minister
[45:42] to your children too and we're gonna
[45:44] read that in the Bible and it talks
[45:46] about we are commanded to teach our
[45:48] children and our grandchildren and our
[45:51] great-grandchildren how great is our God
[45:53] [Music]
[45:57] you're an essential generation
[46:00] but brother John they've closed the
[46:03] border from between Washington State and
[46:06] Canada we can't attend our church
[46:07] they've shut down the border our
[46:10] families from the Waldner family we have
[46:12] to meet them at the park or across the
[46:14] ditch somewhere my newest granddaughter
[46:17] grandson I should say we have to meet
[46:22] across the ditch you know because these
[46:23] borders and we tried to cross the border
[46:25] as a minister as clergy and they said
[46:28] you're not essential Church isn't
[46:29] essential
[46:30] you're not essential do you know what
[46:32] it's like to being rejected refused no
[46:35] entry you're not essential then there
[46:38] comes that inspiration and that's
[46:39] something coming around God's made you
[46:41] essential
[46:43] so you're an essential generation I just
[46:45] want you to sense that this this morning
[46:48] as we go into the afternoon that God is
[46:50] ministering to our brokenness but he
[46:52] wants us to rise out of that don't state
[46:55] you're not a victim you're not a victim
[46:59] you're not a victim lean on the Word of
[47:03] God and just let the Word of God
[47:05] minister to you and as we stand to our
[47:08] feet our Lord Jesus it's been prayed
[47:12] today and sang songs and we unite our
[47:15] hearts with all of the prayers all of
[47:17] the faith around the world as this
[47:21] assembly has been held up before you and
[47:23] the names have been spoken and now we
[47:25] are here today to again bring before you
[47:29] our offerings and I pray the Holy Spirit
[47:32] now would just take every individual
[47:34] ourselves included and take us up into
[47:36] another round let us worship you with
[47:39] renewal let us respond to the word we
[47:44] understand your word Lord as it comes to
[47:47] our hearts as some may weep today I know
[47:49] we may get into some sensitive areas but
[47:52] I pray that in the time of our trouble
[47:55] that our eyes would look unto the heals
[47:56] and look into your word looking to the
[47:59] Kinects quo looking to the next
[48:01] scripture look to the Holy Spirit not
[48:04] the minister but to the Holy Spirit that
[48:06] would break it down into our individual
[48:08] situation Lord Jesus visit
[48:11] assembly today and those that are
[48:13] connected out across the miles or will
[48:15] stream this service this assembly has
[48:19] been a lighthouse over the years where
[48:21] many weary Souls and hungry hearts can
[48:24] feed from your presence so gather around
[48:28] the word again may you just come and
[48:30] minister and may the Holy Spirit brings
[48:34] healing bring deliverance bring the
[48:36] supernatural element in Jesus Christ's
[48:40] name Amen amen let's turn to the
[48:44] scripture together Deuteronomy chapter 4
[48:49] Deuteronomy chapter 4 and then Joel
[48:52] chapter 1 that's both in the Old
[48:54] Testament so if we act a little bit
[48:59] inappropriate or out of order it's
[49:01] because we're trying to learn how to get
[49:03] back into church order hey man y'all
[49:05] help us a little bit and brother John
[49:07] gets a little fanatical raises my voice
[49:09] or start squeaking or something you'll
[49:12] know it's because he's uh he just needs
[49:14] to get in the spirit and hey man and a
[49:16] man and y'all love us don't you and we
[49:20] love you so you're able to look beyond
[49:22] all of this sin things
[49:23] alright brokenness rising from
[49:27] brokenness Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 7
[49:31] for what nation is there so great who
[49:37] hath God so nigh unto them as the Lord
[49:41] our God is in all things that we call
[49:46] upon him for my couldn't you just stop
[49:49] right there brother Johnny and just that
[49:51] verse is wonderful what nation is there
[49:54] so great oh this bride nation verse
[49:59] eight and what nation is there so great
[50:02] that hath statutes and judgments so
[50:05] righteous as all this law which I have
[50:10] set before you this day only take heed
[50:14] to thyself and keep my soul diligently
[50:17] lest thou forget the things which thine
[50:20] eyes have seen unless they depart from
[50:23] my heart all
[50:24] days of thy life but teach them thy sons
[50:28] and thy sons sons or your children and
[50:33] your grandchildren especially the day
[50:37] that thou stood us before the LORD thy
[50:39] God in Horeb when the Lord said unto me
[50:43] gather me the people together and I will
[50:45] make them hear my words that they may
[50:48] learn to fear me all the days that they
[50:52] shall live upon the earth and that they
[50:55] may teach their children God help us
[50:59] today we're here to speak to one another
[51:03] that we would learn of the Lord and
[51:04] teach thy sons and my son sons verse 10
[51:08] talks about the day of Horeb that's when
[51:10] the word came to them and to some of you
[51:13] that are spiritual you might already be
[51:14] thinking of Malachi 4 chapter where it
[51:18] speaks about we know Malachi four five
[51:21] and six about God sending a prophet and
[51:23] turning our hearts but the verse before
[51:25] that talks about the word that came on
[51:27] Horeb to Moses so what I'm actually
[51:30] speaking this morning is an inspiration
[51:33] from the message and through the word
[51:35] that it would anoint the hearts of the
[51:37] generation that is living were to tell
[51:40] our children and our grandchildren how
[51:42] great is our God Joel chapter one Joel
[51:50] chapter one verse two hear this ye old
[51:55] men and give ear all ye inhabitants of
[52:00] the land have this been in your days or
[52:04] even in the days of your fathers tell ye
[52:09] your children of it and let your
[52:12] children tell their children and their
[52:17] children another generation or tell your
[52:22] children and your grandchildren and your
[52:26] great grandchildren it's to be perpetual
[52:29] that this message this truth that's
[52:31] coming to you is alive there's healing
[52:34] there's power there's deliverance
[52:36] don't let it die and here we are in
[52:39] Laodicea we've gone generation after
[52:41] generation since the message came
[52:43] throughout the years there we are an
[52:45] essential generation I wonder if we
[52:48] recognize that today catching the
[52:51] essence of the message then as God
[52:54] brought his prophet and as God has
[52:56] brought all believers through a time of
[52:58] brokenness and crush eNOS it's time to
[53:02] rise it's time to rise up through all
[53:04] that brokenness and through all that
[53:06] hurt and stand up as a generation that
[53:10] experiences God they know God
[53:14] individually may the Lord help us today
[53:17] god bless you you can have your seats
[53:29] this morning I see something just spread
[53:32] out before us of a man running with
[53:37] great strides running upstairs he's
[53:42] running up stairs that are leading up
[53:46] where there's great big palaces and the
[53:49] glory of God is coming up around these
[53:52] places where there's angelic choir
[53:54] singing my home sweet home and that's
[53:57] the backdrop of this morning and I see a
[54:01] man that has been broken he has been
[54:04] crushed but because he's in the middle
[54:08] of an experience that God is giving to
[54:10] him not to deliver him from the
[54:13] experience but for him to be able to
[54:16] come back to life and rise up out of
[54:19] that hurt and rise up out of the
[54:21] brokenness now we are in the middle of
[54:24] this and in in the vision today we seek
[54:27] Him taking great leaps of the stairs and
[54:30] running up the hill and he comes to a
[54:35] door of a house and there's a lady
[54:38] standing there a young lady she had on a
[54:42] white garment and she's standing by the
[54:44] door with black hair and coming down her
[54:47] back and she raises out her arms as she
[54:50] always did when this man which was her
[54:52] husband had did while they were alive on
[54:54] earth when he'd come home tired and
[54:57] things and they caught each other by the
[54:59] hands and this man that had been running
[55:02] can you imagine as he wanted to see what
[55:05] was there and it's just the atmosphere
[55:08] it's everything around the Son of God
[55:11] that he's now experiencing this is his
[55:13] wife that had passed away and and he
[55:16] begins to speak and he talks about
[55:18] seeing his daughter that it also just
[55:21] passed away and he had just saw her
[55:24] though she was just a little baby when
[55:26] she had died now she's a beautiful young
[55:28] lady and she had just met her and now
[55:31] he's coming into the arms of his wife
[55:34] that had passed away and caught her by
[55:36] the hands and said honey I seen Sharon
[55:39] down
[55:39] there said she made a pretty girl didn't
[55:43] she said yes bill she said bill and put
[55:47] her arms around me around my shoulders
[55:50] and started patting me and said don't
[55:52] worry about me and Sharon now here's a
[55:56] wife that had gone on to the other side
[55:58] won't even encourage her husband that
[56:02] Sharon and I are okay don't worry about
[56:06] us and I said I said honey I can't help
[56:09] it and she said Sharon and I are better
[56:11] off than you are don't worry about us no
[56:14] more where you promise me he said hope
[56:17] he said I I've been so lonesome for you
[56:20] and Sharon and Billy talking about Billy
[56:23] Paul cries all the time for you I said I
[56:26] don't know what to do with him so now he
[56:29] had become a single parent not out of
[56:32] his own choice not out of his own will
[56:34] but now because of life because of the
[56:37] crushing because of the brokenness now
[56:40] he immediately becomes a single parent
[56:43] he loses his wife loses a baby becomes a
[56:47] single parent and he's alone some and
[56:48] she said it'll be all right bill said
[56:51] just promise me you won't worry no more
[56:53] she said will you sit down and I looked
[56:55] around and there was a great big chair
[56:57] and how many remember the chair that
[56:59] brother branham talked about down on
[57:01] earth they had put a few dollars down
[57:03] and maybe three dollars down and a
[57:05] dollar a week and and they couldn't
[57:07] afford that he would preach he said all
[57:10] my he would work all day and preach till
[57:13] midnight and things and he got behind on
[57:15] payments I want you to think that today
[57:18] because I'm really bringing this to your
[57:20] heart how many people would struggle
[57:23] even financially and I'm I'm gonna be
[57:25] speaking about some certain things today
[57:27] to give you encouragement that God has
[57:30] allowed men and women before us to be
[57:33] broken to be crushed and it affects our
[57:37] families it affects the finances it
[57:40] affects the church it affects
[57:41] globally things in the message and
[57:43] though you may have been broken and
[57:46] though you might have gone through times
[57:48] of hurt and crushing it's time to rise
[57:51] that brokenness and we see now he got
[57:57] behind on a payment and he couldn't even
[57:59] afford a dollar a week it's amazing a
[58:01] young couple won and they came and they
[58:04] took away his chair and his young
[58:06] beautiful wife tried to distract him by
[58:08] getting the the friends to get some you
[58:11] know worms and things and then he
[58:12] realized they had taken his chair and
[58:14] they begin to cry and now he said now
[58:16] they're in the other dimension whether
[58:18] Aaron in and she said there you remember
[58:20] the chair bill said yes I remember said
[58:23] that's what you was thinking about yeah
[58:25] said they won't take this one this one's
[58:27] paid for you know friends I'm praying
[58:31] for you today I'm a visiting minister
[58:33] but I pray the Lord would give each one
[58:35] of you an experience today that would
[58:39] give you strength something that God
[58:41] would allow to happen to you personally
[58:44] that would help you rise out of the
[58:46] brokenness or rise out of the crushing
[58:50] rise out of the period of creep of
[58:53] character building or or the pain of a
[58:56] health issue or something in your mind
[58:59] and rise out of that and let the Lord
[59:01] Jesus and the inspiration of his word
[59:04] bring a healing for you so that when you
[59:08] come back to your life and even this
[59:10] afternoon and tomorrow then it would
[59:12] have the same effect on you that it did
[59:15] on our prophet when he went beyond the
[59:17] curtain of time he said I will never be
[59:20] the same William Branham again how many
[59:22] remember him saying that it was so
[59:24] perfect and so sublime but he didn't
[59:27] stay there he had to come back to life
[59:29] he had to come back to the tabernacle he
[59:32] had to come back to prayer requests he
[59:34] had to come back to bills had to come
[59:36] back to issues and family and children
[59:39] and all of these things and we have to
[59:41] come back to our lives and as a minister
[59:45] that's what I've seen has been a great
[59:47] disconnection over the years spiritually
[59:49] we can have great meetings we can have
[59:52] great services we can have conventions
[59:54] or camps or experiences but we need that
[59:57] something to carry us through
[1:00:00] God gave his prophet experiences that
[1:00:04] would help carry them through does
[1:00:08] everyone understand today this one's
[1:00:12] paid for this house is paid for well
[1:00:16] branham's don't have houses they're
[1:00:18] vagabonds no you have a house here
[1:00:20] she said sit down a minute I want to
[1:00:23] talk to you said honey I don't
[1:00:24] understand this she said promise me bill
[1:00:27] that she won't worry anymore we're going
[1:00:31] back now and said promise me you won't
[1:00:33] worry I said I can't do that hope and
[1:00:35] just then I come to he's talking about
[1:00:38] he was in that other place and then he
[1:00:40] come back to his room it was dark in the
[1:00:44] room and I looked around and I felt her
[1:00:47] arm around me and she was patting
[1:00:50] brother branham on the arm brought hope
[1:00:53] he said are you in the room and she
[1:00:56] started patting me she said you you
[1:00:59] gonna make me that promise bill promise
[1:01:01] me you won't worry no more I said I
[1:01:04] promise you I want you to notice in that
[1:01:07] other dimension he would not promise but
[1:01:11] now brought back into this dimension
[1:01:12] something took over and he said I
[1:01:15] promise you and just learn that she
[1:01:19] patted me two or three more times and
[1:01:22] then she was gone and I jumped up and I
[1:01:25] turned on all the lights and looked
[1:01:27] everywhere she was gone she was just
[1:01:29] going out of the room he said she isn't
[1:01:31] gone she's still living she was a
[1:01:34] Christian god help us as believers here
[1:01:38] in June 2020 not to fear death the death
[1:01:43] for a believer is just an open door into
[1:01:47] another dimension and we're all a week
[1:01:50] closer to that door and if time would
[1:01:53] tarry there will be elders and people
[1:01:55] among us and even young ones as we heard
[1:01:57] of an accident yesterday and we've heard
[1:01:59] of other things even in the last two
[1:02:01] weeks I've heard of another 17 year old
[1:02:04] young man in the mess
[1:02:05] passed away driving there in eastern
[1:02:07] United States this car with his friend
[1:02:10] brother Aaron and he was driving he's a
[1:02:11] believer I could say his last name and a
[1:02:13] lot of you would know him and I'm so
[1:02:16] happy that some of the family sent me
[1:02:18] his last Instagram post and it was one
[1:02:20] of a scripture one of them a young man
[1:02:22] that knew the Lord but just driving his
[1:02:26] car and having an accident and going
[1:02:28] into that other dimension friends the
[1:02:30] only real piece we have for one another
[1:02:32] is that we know the Lord it's just a
[1:02:36] step into another place it's us that are
[1:02:40] in this dimension that that need the
[1:02:43] comfort we need the help and now his
[1:02:45] wife is gone and God gave him this
[1:02:47] experience and he just kept pressing on
[1:02:50] he knew hope would be there and Sharon
[1:02:53] because she was a Christian are you a
[1:02:56] Christian today about half of you hey
[1:02:59] man how many are Christians here today
[1:03:02] are you fighting a good fight Satan
[1:03:07] thought he would come in March and throw
[1:03:09] us all into despair and ruin and here
[1:03:11] we've been two and three months social
[1:03:13] distancing and respecting and all of
[1:03:15] that but there comes a time when we just
[1:03:17] gotta blow it out the flue and say I'm
[1:03:19] still a believer Satan you thought you
[1:03:22] would break us you thought we would walk
[1:03:27] away and get disappointed and nobody
[1:03:30] called me nobody texted me well here we
[1:03:32] are today
[1:03:34] well sicknesses came and some of lost
[1:03:36] money and some of lost health some are
[1:03:39] just hanging some there's issues in
[1:03:40] their marriage I mean whether it's in
[1:03:42] the world or whether it's in the message
[1:03:44] it puts a strain on marriages Satan's
[1:03:47] wanting to keep us distance and isn't it
[1:03:50] amazing we used to all say if you're
[1:03:52] sick come to the house of God and God
[1:03:55] will make you well and you can be better
[1:03:56] now people are saying I've heard
[1:03:58] announcements if you're sick don't come
[1:04:00] to church if you got a fever don't come
[1:04:05] to church well if you got a fever now
[1:04:09] you should probably stay home and he's
[1:04:12] your healer at home or whether you're a
[1:04:14] church I mean
[1:04:15] I'm not speaking against anything I'm
[1:04:17] just I'm just acknowledging we're in
[1:04:19] another season I still believe in they
[1:04:23] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:04:24] shall recover
[1:04:25] but I also believe a man or a woman can
[1:04:27] believe by His stripes I am healed and I
[1:04:31] might be streaming today I might be on
[1:04:33] the other end somewhere but God is my
[1:04:35] healer do we believe that it it's not
[1:04:39] the preacher it's not the pastor we've
[1:04:43] been trained to look to others for our
[1:04:45] strength and kind of lean on them maybe
[1:04:47] that's why God's knocking that out from
[1:04:49] us it's not the preacher or the deacon
[1:04:52] or the special singer that are so
[1:04:54] anointed it's you and I that me to rise
[1:04:57] rise up out of our brokenness maybe in
[1:05:04] your heart today you could say Lord I
[1:05:06] want to rise now this thought of rising
[1:05:11] from brokenness because broken means to
[1:05:15] be broke and to break to pieces it's
[1:05:19] that a person has become shattered they
[1:05:23] become crushed we would say their heart
[1:05:26] has been broken they have been broken
[1:05:29] they've lost strength they've lost
[1:05:32] courage they're disputed they are they
[1:05:36] become incapacitated that they try to
[1:05:38] endure the trial and Satan has broken
[1:05:41] them and you might feel that way today
[1:05:44] or maybe there's others that this is for
[1:05:46] them maybe maybe you're fine maybe
[1:05:49] you've gone through well you're just a
[1:05:50] strong believer strong experience and
[1:05:53] gods may be speaking to somebody else
[1:05:55] maybe there's been a lamb fell over the
[1:05:58] cliff maybe there's a mother maybe
[1:06:00] there's a young person maybe there's an
[1:06:02] elder that says you know what you know
[1:06:04] and we get dispirited they lose courage
[1:06:07] the Holy Spirit is here to minister you
[1:06:10] today but there'll be a resurrection let
[1:06:12] there be a coming out of that I'm gonna
[1:06:16] show you some slides in a few moments
[1:06:18] but in all the years of our lives and
[1:06:20] all of our journey there's things that
[1:06:22] we go through but we don't want to get
[1:06:24] stuck in a certain scenes
[1:06:27] stuck looking at a certain trial or a
[1:06:29] certain adversity where we become
[1:06:32] experts at describing the issue we need
[1:06:36] to let the word rise within us and go
[1:06:39] beyond our intellect in our minds is
[1:06:43] everyone receiving today because it can
[1:06:45] be a shock that can be a blow it can be
[1:06:48] something that happens just very quickly
[1:06:50] and everything seems to be going good
[1:06:52] and then all of a season you're on alert
[1:06:54] and everyone's crying or everyone's
[1:06:56] weeping or your prayers become kind of
[1:06:58] like striking another chord if you
[1:07:00] understand you just go along and then
[1:07:03] all of a sudden something happens and
[1:07:05] you get into a state of a blow a strain
[1:07:08] if you're speaking about broken bones it
[1:07:10] would mean someone that sustained an
[1:07:13] injury where there's a fracture or a
[1:07:15] part of the body today I'm also speaking
[1:07:17] about our spirit realm that can get
[1:07:19] broken or crushed and you become
[1:07:22] inoperative something is broken your
[1:07:28] life as a real believer has been really
[1:07:32] interrupted and it's been put on pause
[1:07:37] it's like the Proceedings of a wife to
[1:07:41] the lord has been put on pause you say
[1:07:48] how could this be for the good God is
[1:07:53] doing something greater than what you
[1:07:55] and I can see I wonder if we can all
[1:07:58] just accept that today but what we see
[1:08:00] and we feel God's doing something
[1:08:02] greater we're believers today when the
[1:08:08] when the believer hears the word just
[1:08:11] let the word take you to where he's
[1:08:13] taking you to how could this be good
[1:08:16] when the Bible says we know that all
[1:08:19] things work together for good to them
[1:08:22] that love God we love the Lord to them
[1:08:26] who are the called how could this be a
[1:08:28] good thing brother John when you say all
[1:08:33] is well or you know it's all good you
[1:08:35] say what brother John it's my
[1:08:37] good you can tell by their Constitution
[1:08:42] you can tell by their nature there's a
[1:08:44] disconnection it's not pleasant the way
[1:08:49] it used to be it's not agreeable
[1:08:51] everything's gone sideways and now it's
[1:08:53] skeptical and bitterness instead of
[1:08:55] joyful and happy and it being excellent
[1:08:58] and distinguished and upright you say
[1:09:00] how can all things work together for the
[1:09:03] good well all things work together for
[1:09:07] the good just let the word rise up
[1:09:10] within you today and take you in spite
[1:09:14] of your brokenness a Thursday night I
[1:09:18] spoke in Louisville on brokenness will
[1:09:21] not break you and it sounds like a
[1:09:24] paradox but all believers go through
[1:09:27] brokenness but Satan's intent is to
[1:09:30] break you I think we need some sons and
[1:09:34] daughters of an essential generation
[1:09:37] that will say I may be broken but I will
[1:09:40] not break you say brother John you're
[1:09:44] confused no that's inspiration of the
[1:09:46] Holy Ghost I may be broken but I will
[1:09:51] not break I'm speaking to every son and
[1:09:54] daughter of God every individual today
[1:09:57] as we rise up brother John could take
[1:09:59] the time to speak about Christ and how
[1:10:02] he was broken but he fulfilled his part
[1:10:07] when I keep messing with this thing lord
[1:10:09] help us how many know that Christ was
[1:10:14] broken he was bruised but did he fulfill
[1:10:17] his part come on friends say I want to
[1:10:22] be more like Christ I want to be like
[1:10:23] Jesus then this sermon is for you
[1:10:26] Christ was broken but he didn't let that
[1:10:29] hinder his expression his joy kept
[1:10:32] rising Jim I'm gonna take up my cross
[1:10:34] because there's a joy ahead
[1:10:37] then why can't you and I get under that
[1:10:40] inspiration of the word and say there's
[1:10:43] a joy there's a reason there's a
[1:10:45] revelation dry move me into that
[1:10:48] revelation would we all agree that
[1:10:52] there's Old Testament Saints that was
[1:10:54] broken they were broken but they
[1:11:00] fulfilled their part New Testament
[1:11:03] Saints and believers they were broken
[1:11:06] many of them you can look through the
[1:11:08] New Testament they were crushed they
[1:11:10] were hidden and persecuted but they
[1:11:12] fulfilled their part believers in the
[1:11:15] seven ages was persecuted they went
[1:11:18] through their battles they were personal
[1:11:20] battles family battles Church issues but
[1:11:24] they fulfilled their promise and I'm
[1:11:27] jumping right up till today where is the
[1:11:30] generation that will say here we are
[1:11:33] Lord the essential generation oh maybe
[1:11:40] they're up in the balcony somewhere
[1:11:42] maybe they're way in the corner maybe
[1:11:43] they're over here maybe they're
[1:11:44] streaming today and you're in a
[1:11:46] situation and you can say yes they
[1:11:48] fulfilled their part they fulfilled
[1:11:50] their part their battles and God is
[1:11:52] trying to say and you're in your battle
[1:11:54] you're in you're in your issue and
[1:11:55] you're in a generation to rise
[1:12:00] how many realized that we're fulfilling
[1:12:02] the vision hello you're fulfilling a
[1:12:08] vision wake up everyone
[1:12:10] we're just about to cross over you
[1:12:14] you've made it all the way till this
[1:12:16] time don't fall off now this is
[1:12:19] graduation time this is crossing over
[1:12:22] time
[1:12:24] sickness will come pain will come miss
[1:12:27] Andy misunderstandings will come things
[1:12:29] in the church will come issues and
[1:12:33] friendships will happen they will happen
[1:12:36] and it's your time to rise up out of
[1:12:38] that come on friend it's your time to go
[1:12:42] let's go let's go
[1:12:46] and maybe some don't have that strength
[1:12:48] today and you've lost the vision and the
[1:12:51] Holy Spirit's just coming around you and
[1:12:53] saying yes let's go what about brother
[1:12:57] Branham we could take two services and I
[1:12:59] have enough notes here but I need to cut
[1:13:01] it off because last time I was too long
[1:13:03] wasn't I remember that brother Timothy I
[1:13:06] was too long and that was over a year
[1:13:09] ago so he was broken he was crushed I
[1:13:20] opened up the service because that's
[1:13:24] what the Holy Spirit dropped in our
[1:13:25] heart actually the beginning of this
[1:13:27] week of a man running up full strength
[1:13:31] up a staircase of stairs it was like I
[1:13:35] saw it in my heart brother Branham
[1:13:37] running up those stairs after he had
[1:13:40] just left an old western country wagon
[1:13:43] that had a broken wheel that spoke of
[1:13:46] his broken family his family was broken
[1:13:51] but he didn't become bitter he didn't
[1:13:53] leave the ministry he was being broken
[1:13:56] and Satan wanted to break him tried to
[1:14:01] commit suicide once tried to commit
[1:14:03] suicide again it just seemed like Satan
[1:14:05] was wanting to break him I'm gonna take
[1:14:08] you out I'm gonna destroy your life but
[1:14:12] God had a ministry for him God had to
[1:14:15] work for him to do there's a work for
[1:14:17] you to do God inspire this new
[1:14:21] generation you didn't have youth camp
[1:14:23] this year but throughout the weeks God's
[1:14:26] been giving you ministers bringing
[1:14:29] ministers you say well we have to stream
[1:14:30] from home we have to social distance we
[1:14:33] can't shake hands we have to leave right
[1:14:35] away friends that
[1:14:36] that mean that our walk what the Lord
[1:14:38] has to get cold we need to get out of
[1:14:42] that emotional realm and all of this
[1:14:44] emotion emotion we are sons and
[1:14:46] daughters we love emotion but friends
[1:14:49] you take that all away we're still going
[1:14:51] to serve the Lord I'm just gonna speak
[1:14:56] what's on my heart today what I what I
[1:14:59] opened with this morning of the
[1:15:01] celestial City that there would be a
[1:15:04] home there and this beautiful black
[1:15:06] haired lady a real Christian in life but
[1:15:09] she had passed away early in marriage
[1:15:15] twenty-one years old I have personally
[1:15:22] seen where that has destroyed men
[1:15:24] I personally even within the message
[1:15:29] being raised in the message our selves
[1:15:32] have seen where things happen in
[1:15:34] families and it literally destroys a
[1:15:37] person we all know of Margaret there was
[1:15:42] a twin sister of another young lady that
[1:15:45] the people at school were mocking them
[1:15:47] and talking about how they were dressed
[1:15:49] in things and to Margaret she had a
[1:15:52] complex and it threw her into two years
[1:15:54] of a mental issue whereas the other
[1:15:59] young lady was able to override it she
[1:16:01] never was affected like that but it took
[1:16:03] a prophet to go after her spirit and
[1:16:06] bring it back and she went home the next
[1:16:08] day I wonder if there's enough power in
[1:16:12] the this generation brother Timothy I
[1:16:15] wonder if there's enough revelation for
[1:16:17] us to have those among us now and to be
[1:16:20] able to speak to Margaret and bring her
[1:16:22] spirit back again you know now I could
[1:16:25] go a little bit deeper about the spoken
[1:16:27] word and the third pole that's all it
[1:16:30] could be stories or it could be quotes
[1:16:32] or it could be a reality
[1:16:35] where is the generation that's gonna
[1:16:38] rise up that knows they're essential
[1:16:41] that knows it's not a big head it's not
[1:16:44] pride it doesn't have anything to do
[1:16:46] with ourselves it's not we're being
[1:16:51] puffed up it's not a personal bigness it
[1:16:53] has nothing to do with what we've done
[1:16:55] but it's the Lord announcing to you you
[1:17:00] are essential you are necessary you are
[1:17:04] needful you are of great value you are
[1:17:08] absolutely necessary you as a person are
[1:17:16] absolutely necessary essential thank you
[1:17:22] brother Johnny it is fundamentally and
[1:17:25] vital that you make it in the rapture
[1:17:28] the testimony of God is at stake with
[1:17:31] your lives don't throw it away don't let
[1:17:37] lay on to see a rob you of that
[1:17:39] spiritual element when we live in a very
[1:17:43] political environment that wants to get
[1:17:49] your attention on your skin color or on
[1:17:52] how you're seeing things or where you
[1:17:55] live it has nothing to do with that we
[1:17:57] are sons and daughters of God
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:02] listen I just went through Louisville
[1:18:04] Kentucky this weekend the downtown part
[1:18:07] of the city beautiful hotels and
[1:18:10] wonderful shops and restaurants
[1:18:11] it's like block after block of just
[1:18:13] plywood and graffiti it's because men
[1:18:19] and women have come under an anointing
[1:18:21] of rage and hate and destroy and kill
[1:18:26] and social medias blasting that in your
[1:18:30] face to deform your mind to get one side
[1:18:34] of the other friends that has nothing to
[1:18:37] do with us we love the word we love this
[1:18:41] message that is their kingdom that's
[1:18:47] just a little taste of what's going to
[1:18:49] happen when we leave this earth in a
[1:18:52] tribulation you talk about all kinds of
[1:18:55] riots and rage it's just a little taste
[1:18:59] and what we saw yesterday and the day
[1:19:02] before in Louisiana of all the dust
[1:19:05] storms and and the plagues that are
[1:19:07] striking this earth is just a little
[1:19:09] taste and I have personally been around
[1:19:15] people that are just at the breaking
[1:19:16] point it has pushed them to the edge and
[1:19:21] I believe it's time as sons and
[1:19:23] daughters after now we've gone this time
[1:19:26] to be able to say Satan we might be
[1:19:29] broken but I will not break
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:33] [Applause]
[1:19:36] I'm not talking about a virus I've heard
[1:19:39] enough preaching about the virus we've
[1:19:42] heard enough of conspiracy theories and
[1:19:44] all the nonsense
[1:19:45] the bride's already in a channel already
[1:19:48] moving we ought to be moving down a
[1:19:51] channel of the word and I just say God
[1:19:53] forgive any of us if we get so stuck
[1:19:56] into the news feeds and that's just
[1:19:58] nonsense you know who's gonna be
[1:20:00] President and what's gonna happen we are
[1:20:02] going into rapture all this about the
[1:20:16] celestial city and the music and all the
[1:20:18] housing and things and this young lady
[1:20:20] had passed away at 21 years old was a
[1:20:23] young family now brother branham was
[1:20:24] experiencing we're right in the middle
[1:20:26] of an experience that would help him
[1:20:28] carry on but God was breaking a son of
[1:20:34] God to give children this is Malachi 4:2
[1:20:41] give the hearts of the children the kind
[1:20:45] of faith they would need for their
[1:20:46] generation can we look further than just
[1:20:50] a story about a man being broken and say
[1:20:53] god help me in my life now the Prophet
[1:20:57] or the word was experiencing a wounding
[1:21:01] or a brokenness so that a message that
[1:21:04] was being spoken would literally change
[1:21:06] the hearts of last day children it would
[1:21:12] bring them back to Christ bring them
[1:21:14] back to the faith God anoint our hearts
[1:21:22] that now we this morning of this
[1:21:25] afternoon we can either focus on the
[1:21:29] hurt and the brokenness in the pain we
[1:21:33] can focus on the suffering and the abuse
[1:21:35] we can focus on the wrongdoing and the
[1:21:39] misunderstanding and the division we
[1:21:42] could focus on the strife we could take
[1:21:44] services
[1:21:45] the trouble and on the cracking or we
[1:21:49] could stop being a victim and we could
[1:21:52] say I am a son and a daughter of God
[1:21:56] it's got to start there you know we
[1:22:03] could talk about it even in the natural
[1:22:05] there's people that even in the natural
[1:22:07] have more of a drive than a lot of
[1:22:09] people in the message that claim to have
[1:22:11] the message faith I'm thinking of the
[1:22:14] man that came from Africa and was a
[1:22:16] slave down south and he was walking
[1:22:19] gallantly and he was just walking with
[1:22:21] his head up and you all know the story
[1:22:23] and that's where that's why in the
[1:22:25] message we've come so far you already
[1:22:27] know what brother John's thinking about
[1:22:28] you already know her brother Aaron oh he
[1:22:31] starts reading the quote you can already
[1:22:33] finish it and brother Joe oh there goes
[1:22:35] brother Jose oh and we need to stop that
[1:22:37] we need to lean forward and say God what
[1:22:40] are you saying to us this man walks so
[1:22:45] gallant and so upright and his conduct
[1:22:47] was so extraordinary and they said oh
[1:22:50] you must feed him better you must treat
[1:22:52] him better did you make him boss over
[1:22:56] the rest of them no sir I didn't know
[1:22:58] until recently but he over there where
[1:23:01] he came from the tribe he's from he's
[1:23:04] the son of the king and she realizes
[1:23:08] that though he's an alien he conducts
[1:23:11] himself before his brethren as a young
[1:23:14] coming king
[1:23:17] [Music]
[1:23:19] hello Bride of Christ
[1:23:21] hello essential generation you've got
[1:23:27] the letter you are essential so you get
[1:23:31] pulled over by the law where are you
[1:23:34] going what do you think you're doing
[1:23:36] you got staying home orders I'm
[1:23:38] essential I'm going to work I'm on a
[1:23:42] mission go on I think it's time we
[1:23:46] passed by the law and show them the word
[1:23:48] and say I'm a son of God I'm a daughter
[1:23:51] of God go on little bride stop being a
[1:23:59] victim and describing all of that yeah I
[1:24:07] think I'd better move along it gets
[1:24:08] quiet right there you know here's an
[1:24:12] example and we're not talking about out
[1:24:14] of the message we're just talking about
[1:24:15] a man that realized where he came from
[1:24:17] where he came from I'm the son of a king
[1:24:21] so I'm over here in a nation that hates
[1:24:24] me mistreating me but he's just walking
[1:24:27] talent he's just walking head-up he
[1:24:29] knows who he is is that the problem if
[1:24:33] she could just recognize who she is
[1:24:36] is that the issue
[1:24:40] are we still struggling with recognizing
[1:24:42] who we are
[1:24:43] then God dropped that revelation down
[1:24:49] he's walking around and conducting
[1:24:52] himself like he's a young coming King
[1:24:54] him brother branham said god help us let
[1:24:57] us be bold and let's not be ignorant
[1:25:00] about things let's conduct ourselves as
[1:25:02] sons of God daughter of God conduct
[1:25:06] yourself as daughters of God as a
[1:25:08] daughter to the king sons of king of the
[1:25:11] King don't go out and and he starts
[1:25:13] talking about these things were pilgrims
[1:25:14] and strangers and aliens but were sons
[1:25:17] and daughters of the king break up your
[1:25:19] shoulders and live like men and women
[1:25:22] are to live like real Christians
[1:25:31] I'm just trying to be sensitive a lot of
[1:25:37] those people had more faith than some of
[1:25:39] us do they they didn't even have shoes
[1:25:41] on their feet
[1:25:42] and they're out in the field all with
[1:25:44] the choir out there singing you got
[1:25:46] shoes I got shoes all God's children got
[1:25:49] shoes and they're barefoot they're not
[1:25:51] talking about down here some of those
[1:25:54] pinko were doing things and they were
[1:25:56] looking in the mud and they were singing
[1:25:57] about shoes and we've heard the message
[1:26:01] for years it's been quoted to us it's
[1:26:04] been preached to us it's been sang to us
[1:26:06] and we still don't know what it is and
[1:26:10] the preachers are trying to tell us you
[1:26:12] got shoes you got a new body you got a
[1:26:15] future home
[1:26:23] all God's children got shoes and their
[1:26:28] barefoot so you're not talking about
[1:26:30] down here and what the media is saying
[1:26:32] and what the bank accounts saying and
[1:26:34] what your marriage status is saying and
[1:26:36] what their no it's not that it's all up
[1:26:39] in heaven I got shoes they were living
[1:26:42] in another place but yet they're living
[1:26:45] down here but they're living over there
[1:26:46] it's inspiration it's the Holy Spirit
[1:26:51] it's God today at 12:30 that's
[1:26:55] announcing the evening light tabernacle
[1:26:58] you are an essential generation it's
[1:27:02] time to rise up out of your brokenness
[1:27:13] can you imagine the youngest disciple of
[1:27:17] Jesus just let me go for the Knicks
[1:27:22] about five minutes and speak about John
[1:27:24] the youngest disciple of Jesus sometimes
[1:27:30] we need to see what someone else is
[1:27:32] going through to realize I don't got a
[1:27:35] problem
[1:27:37] you know let's just sit down for a few
[1:27:40] hours and I'll tell you about my
[1:27:41] troubles and then you you talked to
[1:27:43] somebody else and you say I don't have
[1:27:45] no job oh come on
[1:27:51] could you imagine John the apostle of
[1:27:55] love that laid over on the bosom of
[1:27:57] Jesus one of those three apostles Peter
[1:28:00] James and John he was young he was
[1:28:03] vibrant
[1:28:03] he was youthful I'm going back to our
[1:28:06] opening scripture of Deuteronomy that we
[1:28:08] are commanded to tell our children and
[1:28:10] our grandchildren John was the youngest
[1:28:14] he was young he was vibrant he was the
[1:28:17] one that outran Peter to the empty tomb
[1:28:20] but did not go in right away I'm looking
[1:28:24] at my notes because these are
[1:28:27] handwritten notes that I have for
[1:28:28] another day in another sermon and I just
[1:28:30] happened to be here today so maybe it's
[1:28:33] for someone but I want to speak on
[1:28:36] wounded children wounded children from
[1:28:43] wounded ones and that is now a
[1:28:48] generation that has come up in the
[1:28:49] message that our wounded themselves
[1:28:51] because their parents were wounded or
[1:28:53] they came out of Church situations they
[1:28:56] saw enough splits and division and abuse
[1:28:58] in churches they become wounded or they
[1:29:02] even had a mother and father that was
[1:29:04] converted and came to the message but
[1:29:06] they didn't know how to raise their
[1:29:07] family in the message we have wounded
[1:29:09] children and we're not here to describe
[1:29:14] all of that and have a bunch of classes
[1:29:16] on how to survive we're here to bring
[1:29:18] the Holy Ghost to them bring the word to
[1:29:20] them so they can arise out of that
[1:29:26] that's what was in our heart I'm just
[1:29:28] touching some of the surface remember
[1:29:30] John ran out ran Peter to the tune but
[1:29:34] he didn't go in right away because Peter
[1:29:36] was older and more burly and he went
[1:29:39] right in but John was a type of the
[1:29:42] Eagle anointing that was called to be
[1:29:45] the apostle of love he was not the
[1:29:47] apostle of bitterness what have you
[1:29:53] become what is the last few months done
[1:29:57] for you in your life have you become
[1:30:00] bitter
[1:30:01] what has your trial done for you do I
[1:30:06] have some of your attention
[1:30:08] what has your trial done for you he
[1:30:17] wasn't called the apostle of getting
[1:30:19] back at of their people he could have
[1:30:20] got back at of a look look at this
[1:30:22] Thomas asked him to put your hand into
[1:30:26] the side where's your faith I mean Peter
[1:30:32] you're cursing the Lord you're swearing
[1:30:34] the Lord I don't even know the man
[1:30:38] cursing swearing Peter Thomas look at
[1:30:48] all you disciples running in the garden
[1:30:50] where's your tenacity where's your
[1:30:54] stick-to-itiveness John saw all of it
[1:30:59] but he had enough vision he saw Jesus
[1:31:04] killed catch this a javelin was thrown
[1:31:07] into the side of Jesus and he saw that
[1:31:12] he saw the crown of thorns I was just
[1:31:17] with brother Brian Garrett and sister
[1:31:19] Elizabeth Garrett on Tuesday night and I
[1:31:22] was walking in their property and
[1:31:23] growing on one of their trees was a huge
[1:31:26] thorns and it was going up the tree huge
[1:31:29] long thorns and he broke one off and he
[1:31:31] just stuck and it was like sharpest
[1:31:33] needles that was like the crown of
[1:31:35] and john saw them do that to jesus the
[1:31:40] pastor of the church the leader of the
[1:31:44] church i beloved jesus and he saw them
[1:31:47] kiss him and beaten on his back they
[1:31:54] said john saw them get nails into his
[1:31:57] master's feet and he heard him he was a
[1:32:03] fellow disciple with judas I mean Judas
[1:32:06] handled the money of the church and at
[1:32:09] the camp meetings he was counting the
[1:32:11] money of the young people he done
[1:32:16] miracles Judas did and he fought and now
[1:32:18] look at him he could have become better
[1:32:23] John saw all of this nonsense he could
[1:32:26] have got bitter and skeptical of every
[1:32:28] trustee now every deacon every preacher
[1:32:32] look at all you disciples of Jesus Peter
[1:32:40] denied curse the Lord they tried to boil
[1:32:42] john and oil his all his fellow
[1:32:46] disciples were martyred all of them
[1:32:49] somebody say Amen all of them except for
[1:32:55] John and now he's boiling in Y and oil
[1:32:58] boiling in oil and he had so much Holy
[1:33:00] Ghost so much God inside of him have you
[1:33:06] ever felt like that you're boiling just
[1:33:10] did you see what they posted just you're
[1:33:13] just boiling John had enough love and
[1:33:14] Holy Ghost about him he says God's gonna
[1:33:17] take care of that
[1:33:18] Lord take bit on the side of my heart
[1:33:20] kind you've got a rise up out of
[1:33:23] bitterness brother sister you got a rise
[1:33:26] up out of that you got to commit that to
[1:33:30] the Lord and say Lord if that doesn't
[1:33:33] happen in my whole lifetime of good I'm
[1:33:35] still gonna serve you now friends you
[1:33:38] got to give enough Liberty to a minister
[1:33:40] to go down a channel it might be
[1:33:42] somebody's going through something today
[1:33:43] and you might get a little nervous or
[1:33:45] maybe a little bit
[1:33:49] this for this ain't for me it might be
[1:33:51] for somebody that's hanging on every
[1:33:52] word John saw all of this yet in all of
[1:33:59] these things God revealed many mysteries
[1:34:02] to John in the book of Revelation and
[1:34:04] I'll say this to you tonight just give
[1:34:07] Peter and Thomas and those other
[1:34:10] disciples a few more chapters just give
[1:34:13] him a few more chapters and all of those
[1:34:17] men were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:34:20] another chapter and another year and
[1:34:23] another time I'm giving some of you a
[1:34:26] lot of allowance I'll give you another
[1:34:28] chapter I'll give you another ring just
[1:34:32] give us some more time
[1:34:35] forgive us for our neglect Lord just
[1:34:38] give me some more time brother Baxter
[1:34:43] maybe you feel really ashamed of the
[1:34:45] last month or two I could have prayed
[1:34:47] more I could have gotten to the message
[1:34:49] more I'd be a better minister I've been
[1:34:51] we're sharper but and now just God
[1:34:53] forgive me okay and God gives you
[1:34:56] another chapter it gives you another
[1:34:58] opportunity where is the generation as

[1:35:13] are you that have some flexibility in
[1:35:15] your life that are moved by the power of
[1:35:17] God moved by the word where the where
[1:35:20] love controls you look at this on the
[1:35:25] screen just a few weeks ago I went to
[1:35:28] the dentist you know the very next day I
[1:35:32] was scheduled in March for a teeth
[1:35:34] cleaning and they called me the day
[1:35:36] before and said we're canceling
[1:35:37] everything y'all remember March John
[1:35:41] remember March is like dominos
[1:35:43] everything's going down we had Church on
[1:35:47] a Wednesday night my father can and II
[1:35:50] spoke and I leaned over to a minister
[1:35:53] next to me and I said he's ministering
[1:35:55] like it was the last time he ever spoke
[1:35:58] and that's the last service our
[1:36:02] Church had all together it's amazing God
[1:36:08] prepares us I went to the dentist they
[1:36:11] finally started going back going I said
[1:36:13] I got to get in there I had a wedding on
[1:36:15] a Saturday and I
[1:36:16] I said I'm essential they texted me and
[1:36:20] cancel the appointment I said I'm
[1:36:21] essential I got to get in there they
[1:36:23] we're sorry you can come right in you
[1:36:25] know I like maybe some of you need to
[1:36:31] put try that this week I'm essential who
[1:36:34] told you that God did oh come on Angela
[1:36:40] and I went into the restroom washroom
[1:36:43] toilet Lou whatever you call it and this
[1:36:45] was what was on the wall and the
[1:36:49] inspiration come into my heart it's time
[1:36:51] to go to the next ring how many know
[1:36:53] that this is a tree that's been cut and
[1:36:56] it shows the reins of the tree is the
[1:36:59] years of its life how many know that and
[1:37:02] when they're skinny together that means
[1:37:06] there hasn't been a lot of water there
[1:37:07] hasn't been a lot of nutrients but when
[1:37:09] they're lighter apart that means they've
[1:37:11] had a lot of water and they've had a lot
[1:37:13] of goodness that year and the
[1:37:15] inspiration came into my heart it's time
[1:37:17] to go to the next ring and it comes out
[1:37:20] of Philippians where Paul said brother
[1:37:22] and I count not myself to have
[1:37:23] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:37:25] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:37:27] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:37:29] which are before I press let's say press
[1:37:34] come on this is our Sunday morning
[1:37:36] service we press what are you all doing
[1:37:39] down there we are pressing the whole
[1:37:43] balcony the whole stands are full of
[1:37:45] believers saying you can make this
[1:37:50] all the martyrs are screaming you can do
[1:37:54] this all the Old Testament all the New
[1:37:57] Testament all the young people that gave
[1:38:02] their lives are saying stop being a
[1:38:04] bunch of babies down there I'm telling
[1:38:09] you if I could give them a microphone
[1:38:10] today they'd be pretty inspirational
[1:38:12] this two minutes for this one two
[1:38:15] minutes they'd be straightening at us I
[1:38:16] mean after an hour we'd be so filled we
[1:38:20] just walk out of here and say Lord
[1:38:21] forgive us Lord I mean all the martyrs
[1:38:24] are going to speak hallelujah I'll tell
[1:38:28] you a lot of our looking at one another
[1:38:29] and our sandals and our dress and our
[1:38:32] glasses and our all of our accents or
[1:38:35] the color wouldn't mean nothing
[1:38:38] sometimes we're just ashamed when we
[1:38:41] hear about what others are going through
[1:38:42] it's time for you to break out of your
[1:38:45] brokenness brother sister it's time for
[1:38:47] you to get over these things say I can't
[1:38:57] forget about those things that are
[1:38:58] behind only God has a sea of
[1:39:01] forgetfulness that's why we need to be
[1:39:03] more like God pressing toward the mark
[1:39:08] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[1:39:11] or mature be thus minded and in anything
[1:39:15] you be otherwise minded or focused on
[1:39:17] your career your job your education your
[1:39:20] certain situations that you wait I mean
[1:39:22] isn't God looking at be on your
[1:39:24] situation
[1:39:25] can I ask everybody personally is God
[1:39:28] looking beyond your situation and your
[1:39:30] issue Oh God friend and yet we we don't
[1:39:33] want to do that for others I just say
[1:39:34] God help all of us I'm not preaching at
[1:39:36] anybody today we all brother Timothy we
[1:39:44] all have issues and we all have things
[1:39:46] brother Branham left that other
[1:39:48] celestial City and came back after
[1:39:50] meeting hope and she's patting him on
[1:39:52] the arm promise me promise me I promise
[1:39:55] and she was gone he had to go back and
[1:39:59] live his life
[1:40:01] God didn't take him out of the trial he
[1:40:04] gave him something that would help him
[1:40:06] go through the trial that's what God is
[1:40:10] doing today it's like he's opening the
[1:40:12] door in somebody's room that you were in
[1:40:15] and you thought you were trapped and God
[1:40:16] is opening the door and saying come on
[1:40:18] into this room let's look at things
[1:40:22] different let's look at this room
[1:40:24] brother Joe let's look at this picture
[1:40:25] let's look at this what so look at this
[1:40:27] vase and brother Aaron speaks and
[1:40:30] brother Joe brother Timothy brother Tim
[1:40:31] brother Dwayne others that ministered
[1:40:33] they they're showing you another room
[1:40:35] walk in through the room rise up out of
[1:40:39] your the way you're looking at it
[1:40:51] because brother Branham said maybe
[1:40:54] you've been a failure I'm in this
[1:40:56] afternoon maybe ministers you've been
[1:40:58] total failures as a housewife as a
[1:41:00] student in school as a child to your
[1:41:02] parents whatever you have been let that
[1:41:04] be has-been and start from today no
[1:41:08] matter what it is maybe you've been a
[1:41:09] failure as a Christian maybe you failed
[1:41:11] to go on with God if it has been take
[1:41:14] note to what I'm gonna say just in a few
[1:41:16] moments about this he starts talking
[1:41:18] about Moses and all these things
[1:41:20] look at this rings of tree of the tree
[1:41:24] show the years of life and also the
[1:41:27] events within those years over here yeah
[1:41:33] it's just you can see in the middle
[1:41:36] there when it starts and then there's a
[1:41:39] rainy season and it's wider than the dry
[1:41:41] season it's tighter but how many can see
[1:41:44] the scar from the forest fire
[1:41:45] how many can see that something happened
[1:41:48] in that person's life in that trees life
[1:41:51] and it caused a scar it's not that the
[1:41:56] tree was welcoming the fire welcoming
[1:41:58] the tornado welcoming it was it's
[1:42:00] something that happened and it caused
[1:42:02] the scar from that moment on it caused
[1:42:05] that tree to be affected here it is
[1:42:08] again you can see this tree that's 24
[1:42:10] years old but you see the little knot
[1:42:15] in the tree on the bottom there for five
[1:42:17] years how many rings is in that it
[1:42:21] caused an issue it caused whenever it
[1:42:23] came around to this thing and brother
[1:42:26] branham talked about this in on the
[1:42:28] wings of a snow-white dove he talked
[1:42:29] about his own sir and his nervousness
[1:42:31] and a stomach and talked about the seven
[1:42:33] year cycle and for you and I it's may be
[1:42:36] when you come around a certain situation
[1:42:38] you start getting where it's not normal
[1:42:40] it's not it's not and you just wonder
[1:42:42] why is it always broken why is it always
[1:42:44] naughty what can I just seem to be
[1:42:50] normal what Lord why and the natural
[1:42:55] trees have it and we have it we have
[1:42:57] issues and things here it is for the
[1:42:59] first 20 years of this person's life it
[1:43:02] was very very skinny but then something
[1:43:04] happened maybe was a meeting maybe it
[1:43:07] was an encounter maybe the Holy Ghost
[1:43:09] came on a person and for the next years
[1:43:11] 9 years 10 years they've just growing
[1:43:14] growing growing something was added
[1:43:16] something happened may that happen for
[1:43:18] us Lord it's time for us to move to the
[1:43:21] next ring maybe as a church we need to
[1:43:23] move to the next ring maybe as a
[1:43:26] generation in the message we need to
[1:43:28] move to the next ring is everybody awake
[1:43:33] I don't know how personal I can be here
[1:43:37] but within the last year I was just
[1:43:42] watching I was on the platform and I was
[1:43:45] just watching one of our senior
[1:43:48] ministers in the message Minister
[1:43:50] hundreds of people and just something
[1:43:53] came into my heart I've never said this
[1:43:55] publicly I said I wonder what's going to
[1:43:58] happen when men like that are off the
[1:44:01] scene I wonder what's going to happen in
[1:44:05] the message when you see individuals
[1:44:07] gravitating toward certain gifts and
[1:44:09] only responding when a certain thing is
[1:44:11] done I wonder in a few years what's
[1:44:14] going to happen I think it's a valid
[1:44:18] inspiration what's going to happen if
[1:44:20] we're just leaning on the man or when
[1:44:22] that gift or when that person is
[1:44:24] speaking that we respond or I just feel
[1:44:27] we're gonna we're headed for trouble
[1:44:30] because seasons and years go by and
[1:44:33] God's will takes men of God takes women
[1:44:38] of God and as families and as believers
[1:44:42] and in our church we cannot rely on the
[1:44:45] flesh of one another and God allows
[1:44:49] ministers or even sisters to be singers
[1:44:52] or leaders and but they will be taken
[1:44:58] where is that generation that will be
[1:45:01] able to recognize it's part of life it's
[1:45:05] part of life and we must go on we must
[1:45:09] sail on the church must go on the family
[1:45:14] must go on your friendships got to go on
[1:45:19] you say well this person's going through
[1:45:21] this they're going through a knot in
[1:45:23] their tree they're going through
[1:45:24] look at this fire scar do you see that
[1:45:29] and every time you're around that person
[1:45:32] brother or sister they always are
[1:45:33] talking about it and this issue in this
[1:45:37] thing and whenever you're around their
[1:45:38] atmosphere there it's always like it's
[1:45:40] scarred it's marred it always turns out
[1:45:42] into a negative twist you got to be
[1:45:44] careful you got to be careful that'll
[1:45:47] twist you and it never happened to you
[1:45:50] but because you opened up your spirit to
[1:45:53] something else
[1:45:54] it'll wounds you there's a forest fire
[1:45:59] and for how many years brother Aaron did
[1:46:03] that affect that tree look years years
[1:46:06] years years dry years wet years meetings
[1:46:09] conventions Christmas Easter will
[1:46:17] fulfill in the vision we're teaching our
[1:46:22] children and our grandchildren and
[1:46:24] brother John now has three grandchildren
[1:46:27] we're fulfilling Joel and Deuteronomy
[1:46:31] what are you some of y'all laughing
[1:46:32] about sister Ruth come on I mean you're
[1:46:35] gonna have grandchildren one day
[1:46:37] help us Lord amen but it's just part of
[1:46:41] life we're commanded to teach them how
[1:46:45] great is our God now some of you are
[1:46:51] getting weary you know so I need to wind
[1:46:53] it up here I can see that the time that
[1:46:55] a person stands out on the beach of time
[1:46:57] and looks out over toward the moon and
[1:46:59] you begin to wonder you're praying what
[1:47:02] is God's will for my life where do I go
[1:47:04] from here where do we go from here
[1:47:08] that there's inspiration we draw from
[1:47:12] the message great joys lay ahead many
[1:47:16] saddened hearts will be made great
[1:47:18] mysteries will be made clear and people
[1:47:20] who are sad will be turned into joy and
[1:47:23] if we're not careful we can get around
[1:47:25] inspiration like that and still keep our
[1:47:27] arms folded and still keep our spirits
[1:47:30] and we can go right back out there and
[1:47:32] be the same we can carry that into our
[1:47:35] homes we can carry that into our private
[1:47:37] lives and if we're not careful you're
[1:47:39] just the same old same oh and by the
[1:47:42] word of the Lord today this is the
[1:47:44] message it's time for you to rise out of
[1:47:47] that
[1:47:48] it's time for you to break out of that
[1:47:51] year don't get stuck in summer oh it's
[1:48:03] so hot oh so hot in humid and you get
[1:48:07] stuck there don't get stuck and follow
[1:48:11] well all the leaves are falling it's so
[1:48:13] depressive and dark and I get this every
[1:48:15] year brother Johnny I get this spirit
[1:48:17] comes around me and it just begins to
[1:48:18] affect my my mood and then you get stuck
[1:48:21] in winter no life no joy no flowers you
[1:48:25] saw but oh here we go again and you get
[1:48:28] stuck there then that that defines you
[1:48:33] the Scarb defines you the hurt the
[1:48:37] Wildfire but where is the generation
[1:48:44] that's going to rise up through that I
[1:48:47] think I'm looking at that generation
[1:48:50] we're not going to get stuck in a season
[1:48:53] and just let it be progressive and going
[1:48:57] on and on and on stop being a victim
[1:49:00] somebody's gonna rise up out of this we
[1:49:03] didn't have youth camp this year like
[1:49:05] like we have in the other years but
[1:49:07] praise God we're serving God anyway oh
[1:49:09] well next year well next year may not
[1:49:12] come there might be some of us not be
[1:49:14] sure next year Oh what's gonna happen to
[1:49:17] the church is just gonna go on with God
[1:49:19] I mean come on friends don't get stuck
[1:49:23] in some bad attitude you're looking out
[1:49:26] over and you're just wandering and that
[1:49:28] you can get lost in all of these things
[1:49:30] in the dry season where it's time to
[1:49:32] move to the next ring how many would say
[1:49:35] God inspire us today
[1:49:37] I don't care if it's in the dentist
[1:49:39] office or in church or driving down the
[1:49:41] road I can tell you where God gave me
[1:49:44] the title for this service today but I'm
[1:49:47] not going to
[1:49:49] we may be wounded but we will not be
[1:49:53] moved now I'm going to look at some of
[1:49:56] you we may not be wounded
[1:49:57] we may be wounded but we will not be
[1:50:00] moved
[1:50:03] broken yes maybe but you can't break me
[1:50:12] Satan I'm broken but you will not break
[1:50:19] me say brother John you're talking like
[1:50:21] in riddles no that's a paradox that's
[1:50:25] the bride that's like somebody that's
[1:50:26] looking at a lion that's a murderer
[1:50:28] that's about ready to have their head
[1:50:30] cut off saying I'm about ready to give
[1:50:32] my life someone would say oh death is
[1:50:36] calling to you and another says but life
[1:50:38] is calling to you stop getting hung up
[1:50:43] in a certain ring a certainty issue a
[1:50:45] certain year at a certain season rise up
[1:50:48] out of this where the Jeremy's not
[1:50:55] single no more he's got marriage issues
[1:51:00] I was going to ask for the phone number
[1:51:06] of sister Sadie for many many months I
[1:51:08] never have so I'll tell her publicly
[1:51:13] she's a blessing to me almost every
[1:51:17] single day I wake up and I turned to
[1:51:23] your podcast and I hear her last song
[1:51:25] that was posted and I don't even know
[1:51:31] the title of it but it goes I'm just a
[1:51:33] girl and it goes on like that she's not
[1:51:37] just a girl she's an inspiration she's a
[1:51:41] gift from God and little did Sadie know
[1:51:44] that every day or most of my life as a
[1:51:47] minister I woke up and that inspiration
[1:51:50] was flooded does anybody know the title
[1:51:52] of that song it's one of the latest
[1:51:54] posting be born in me and that was the
[1:51:59] drive that was the jolt and you don't
[1:52:03] know that you know throughout that can I
[1:52:07] just get personal the last few months
[1:52:09] while some have been isolated in a way
[1:52:12] and they've gotten cold and indifferent
[1:52:13] do you know that some have given their
[1:52:15] hearts to the Lord
[1:52:16] the Holy Spirit has fell into rooms now
[1:52:20] I'm going to give a testimony and the
[1:52:22] family may be streaming or with who
[1:52:24] their service later from South Africa
[1:52:26] there was a family that they were
[1:52:28] isolated to their home the Wilson family
[1:52:31] and they have children Beulah Naomi
[1:52:36] Angela and David brother Eric and sister
[1:52:40] Grace they because of this quarantine
[1:52:43] and getting isolated at home they
[1:52:44] started streaming streaming services and
[1:52:47] so they streamed all of your meetings
[1:52:49] they said tell brother Tim brother
[1:52:50] Timothy brother job or their errand and
[1:52:52] they stream your services just a few
[1:52:56] weeks ago in May May the 6th they were
[1:53:04] streaming a service from 4 years before
[1:53:06] they all got in their house they sat
[1:53:09] down in the evening and they were
[1:53:10] streaming a certain service from 4
[1:53:13] years ago it was during the lockdown and
[1:53:16] the stay at home orders in Africa and
[1:53:18] they were forced to be at home they
[1:53:20] started streaming camps and meetings and
[1:53:22] services and while their whole family
[1:53:24] was in the room streaming the service
[1:53:26] the brother was preaching a service why
[1:53:30] not me why not now why not me why not
[1:53:36] now and a 17 year old teenager just
[1:53:40] broke she began to weep and cry cry out
[1:53:45] to God and the Holy Ghost came into that
[1:53:48] room and that whole family has never
[1:53:50] been the same
[1:53:52] praise God
[1:54:02] she rose out of brokenness as a teenager
[1:54:05] in rebellion and struggle and issues and
[1:54:08] problems and God dealing with this
[1:54:10] person and her sister Beulah was
[1:54:12] recognizing she's 19 years old and she's
[1:54:16] God's dealing with my sister and God's
[1:54:18] dealing why I want the Lord to deal with
[1:54:20] my heart and little did they know I
[1:54:25] heard this testimony on a Monday as I
[1:54:27] was walking down by the ocean and that
[1:54:31] evening I was getting with a couple that
[1:54:33] was in our church that was going to get
[1:54:35] married they had to change their plans
[1:54:37] and a relative of sister Kathy's they
[1:54:41] were going to get married in Canada but
[1:54:43] now it had to happen in the United
[1:54:44] States and in a backyard so we were with
[1:54:47] them at their new little home this is
[1:54:49] they're just getting a new little suite
[1:54:50] and I came to their home with my wife
[1:54:53] and they began to speak about their
[1:54:56] marriage and their testimonies and how
[1:54:58] they gave their heart to the Lord
[1:55:00] and the young man the brother that was
[1:55:03] going to get married
[1:55:04] begin to give his testimony and it went
[1:55:07] back to the very same camp meetings but
[1:55:11] this young lady had given her heart to
[1:55:13] the Lord it was the night before and and
[1:55:19] the church is having a camp service and
[1:55:21] young people and there was a prayer line
[1:55:24] and the ministers were lined up on the
[1:55:26] platform I think about four or five and
[1:55:29] the young people would come up and
[1:55:31] individually we would pray for the
[1:55:33] different ones and this young man wasn't
[1:55:36] in the service he was away from the
[1:55:38] service and then came into the service
[1:55:41] so he's way in the back and the prayer
[1:55:45] lines going on and it goes on and on and
[1:55:47] he's not where he should be with the
[1:55:49] Lord and his brother is working in the
[1:55:51] sound booth and this young man is
[1:55:55] standing in the very back and he's
[1:55:57] saying Lord if my brother will come to
[1:55:59] me and go with me to the front I will go
[1:56:03] and the voice of God spoke to his
[1:56:06] brother in the sound booth and said go
[1:56:09] to your brother not even knowing his
[1:56:12] brother was in the meeting and he
[1:56:15] turn back and there was his brother in
[1:56:17] the back and he goes to his brother and
[1:56:19] says do you want to go I'll go with you
[1:56:20] and they go to the front he's one of the
[1:56:22] last ones in the prayer line and that's
[1:56:25] the night he gave his heart to the Lord
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:36] and now four years later I didn't even
[1:56:39] tell them but that very morning I'd
[1:56:41] heard of someone that had given their
[1:56:43] heart to the Lord from the service that
[1:56:44] was the next night I just want to say
[1:56:46] how great is our God or you say you have
[1:56:49] to be there you have to touch the person
[1:56:51] yeah no friends whether it's virtual
[1:56:53] whether friends we just read out of a
[1:56:55] Bible that was written for many years
[1:56:57] ago our prophet spoke years ago but it's
[1:57:01] like it's being spoken today let your
[1:57:05] has been been has been let your will be
[1:57:08] be will be let's rise for my brokenness
[1:57:13] it's time to move to the next ring it's
[1:57:22] time to throw away your popcorn and your
[1:57:25] gaming or your you you know your Netflix
[1:57:27] or whatever you've been doing or
[1:57:29] whatever and let's go to the next ring
[1:57:34] praise the Lord
[1:57:36] what Satan wanted to stop all of us God
[1:57:39] has brought to the surface from the
[1:57:42] ashes of despair and from the ashes of
[1:57:45] hurt now from the ashes of trauma and
[1:57:54] all the negative and life experiences
[1:57:59] from the ashes of all of that comes the
[1:58:01] beauty comes victory comes a character
[1:58:06] of Christ in the bride and I know I'm
[1:58:11] leaving tomorrow so we're just going to
[1:58:14] speak now as we come now into the
[1:58:16] afternoon from all of this comes the
[1:58:22] beauty of character and there's a bride
[1:58:25] that is receiving the word that will be
[1:58:28] the generation that is the essence
[1:58:31] essential you hold my every moment
[1:58:43] sometimes we're on the housetops
[1:58:45] sometimes we're down in the valley
[1:58:48] blushing profit I'm quoting sometimes
[1:58:52] we're on the mountain sometimes on the
[1:58:54] housetops and it makes us appreciate the
[1:58:57] good times that's what they call
[1:59:00] contrast he's talking about people that
[1:59:02] are from Africa they didn't know that
[1:59:04] they had that certain type of skin to
[1:59:06] David Livingstone this is our prophet
[1:59:08] talking like this they saw David
[1:59:11] Livingstone and realized it was a
[1:59:14] contrast and he said you will never
[1:59:17] appreciate a day if you don't have a
[1:59:19] night you will never know how to
[1:59:22] appreciate the sunshine if you didn't
[1:59:24] have a cloudy day you would never know
[1:59:27] how to appreciate righteousness unless
[1:59:28] you add some unrighteousness you never
[1:59:31] know how to appreciate good health
[1:59:33] unless Oh is everyone listening we don't
[1:59:37] appreciate good health unless we've had
[1:59:40] foul health bad health it's true brother

[2:00:15] glad God's not looking under the table
[2:00:17] he's looking above the table and he sees
[2:00:20] us all as Prince and princesses some of
[2:00:25] you know what I'm talking about

[2:00:28] he was laying because a nurse dropped
[2:00:32] him Saul has died Jonathan has died and
[2:00:36] now here's Prince Mephibosheth four
[2:00:39] years old in the nurse picks him up to
[2:00:41] run and she falls and he becomes lame
[2:00:43] for sixteen years he's way over and lo
[2:00:48] debar at another place with no
[2:00:50] connection till God lays it on the heart
[2:00:53] of David there's got to be somebody of
[2:00:55] Jonathan's household and there was a
[2:00:58] prince way far away and they brought him
[2:01:01] in before
[2:01:02] but how many knows that account he's a
[2:01:05] prince but he's living way out of
[2:01:08] connection way out of pasture and David
[2:01:12] brought him in and made him part of the
[2:01:13] household come into my banquet room some
[2:01:18] of you know what I'm talking about today
[2:01:20] about brokenness and I know some of our
[2:01:23] children and young people they're
[2:01:24] looking at us like you know they have a
[2:01:26] good life they have good health they
[2:01:27] have all kinds of good things and they
[2:01:29] think they got it bad and some of us
[2:01:33] older ones we you know we think we got
[2:01:36] it bad till we find out there's other
[2:01:38] believers like brother caleb is in in
[2:01:41] china today in prison hello and his wife
[2:01:48] and children and church no he's not he's
[2:01:51] in prison and we talk about our houses
[2:01:54] our apartments or condos or RV or
[2:01:56] whatever and while he's in prison and we
[2:02:00] talk about our food or we talk about
[2:02:01] this we talk about our clothes he's in
[2:02:04] prison Satan wants to hold us prison
[2:02:09] prisoners and be captive god help us we
[2:02:13] never know how to appreciate the
[2:02:14] mountain less we've been in the valley
[2:02:16] and you can study this in brother
[2:02:19] branham's ministries we come to a close
[2:02:21] he he became a single parent he's
[2:02:27] warming his son's bottle under his arm
[2:02:29] and then at night he's warming the body
[2:02:31] becomes an instant single parent God
[2:02:40] gave him grace for that he was being
[2:02:42] broken and crushed tried to commit
[2:02:45] suicide he took off his glove he was
[2:02:47] going to touch that electrical line he
[2:02:49] had full intentions sherry honey I'm
[2:02:52] gonna see you and mommy and just I can't
[2:02:54] take this no more I got beside myself
[2:02:56] and he pulled off his gloves I was
[2:02:58] reaching out and he woke up on the
[2:03:00] bottom of that pole God rich in mercy he
[2:03:03] said if it wasn't for the grace of God
[2:03:04] friends can't you just thank God for His
[2:03:07] grace today
[2:03:09] thank God for His grace for you and he
[2:03:15] didn't climb up the pole and take off
[2:03:17] his glove and touch it again
[2:03:19] he didn't tempt God he said Lord there
[2:03:21] must be a work for me to do then and
[2:03:23] then he goes on and yes he can't work
[2:03:25] and then he goes out and gets the mail
[2:03:27] out of the post-office box and it says
[2:03:29] Miss Sharon Rose Branham he said there
[2:03:31] it is again he had thrown his gun upon
[2:03:35] his bed he pulls it out and pulls back
[2:03:38] the hammer he said brother John
[2:03:41] I think it's rap music I think it's
[2:03:43] wrong music I think it's well he wasn't
[2:03:45] playing that he started singing songs
[2:03:48] started saying the Lord's Prayer our
[2:03:50] Father which art in heaven hallowed be
[2:03:52] thy name it goes to show how as
[2:03:54] believers we can be living so close in
[2:03:57] that realm and yet be so broken you can
[2:04:02] be broken and not break I wonder who
[2:04:07] believes that for someone else let's
[2:04:09] forget about ourselves and say for that
[2:04:11] other sister for that other brother I
[2:04:13] pray God give them a revelation I just I
[2:04:15] had an email from a young lady and from
[2:04:18] Africa and she just said one day I was
[2:04:20] little and I just didn't have and then I
[2:04:22] just woke up and it was like everything
[2:04:23] was different had a desire for the word
[2:04:26] I had a desire for the message I thank
[2:04:28] God for that
[2:04:29] let there be another spring it's another
[2:04:32] cycle another season is here
[2:04:36] God's announcing another season brother

[2:04:44] you've been looking to this it's time to
[2:04:46] turn the calendar stop going like this
[2:04:49] and Oh Lord you know no he's turning the
[2:04:52] calendar
[2:04:53] the Lord laid the son brother John's
[2:04:56] hearts days ago wounded children from
[2:05:06] wounded children say what are you gonna
[2:05:08] do stay there and wallow in it are you
[2:05:10] gonna rise up it's time to rise up we're
[2:05:14] gonna turn this corner brother John
[2:05:15] where we see brothers throughout this
[2:05:20] whole pandemic it's been a strain on the
[2:05:22] ministry because we're hearing from one
[2:05:24] side in the church we need to shut down
[2:05:27] everything just stop till it's all over
[2:05:28] not Church no nothing we gotta just be
[2:05:31] all let's just and on the other side
[2:05:33] looks like let's have Church let's go
[2:05:35] and we're just what should we do Lord
[2:05:37] what is wisdom what's the mind of the
[2:05:39] Lord and one pastor I just heard the
[2:05:45] testimony this week he had a visiting
[2:05:48] Minister come through his church this is
[2:05:50] in the last few weeks and the brother
[2:05:52] said I'm just gonna come by and speak
[2:05:55] something that would encourage you and
[2:05:59] he said that publicly he came by and
[2:06:01] preached and the pastor got up at the
[2:06:05] end of the service and said he doesn't
[2:06:07] know this but he spoke he spoke to his
[2:06:09] wife and said I was going to resign
[2:06:11] after this weekend because of all the
[2:06:14] pressure and all these things and you
[2:06:16] could read into that and say this or
[2:06:18] that I'm here to tell you God knows who
[2:06:19] to send God knows what to do in your
[2:06:22] life you say I'm broken I'm just fed up
[2:06:24] with all this this side and that side
[2:06:26] and what are you thinking you know you
[2:06:27] can have five brothers and they're all
[2:06:29] saying this and I think we should do
[2:06:30] that and and the mind of the Lord he's
[2:06:32] just watching our character what are
[2:06:34] y'all gonna do him this time and
[2:06:35] sometimes it's not easy to know what to
[2:06:37] do should I go here should I take that
[2:06:41] job for the job this has happened in my
[2:06:45] life what should I do you can get so
[2:06:47] caught up and what to do and where to go
[2:06:49] you just get confused you get upset and
[2:06:52] right in the middle of that and brother
[2:06:54] branham standing there with the bottle
[2:06:56] his little two-year-old son and Billy
[2:06:59] Pulse ISM the mom I see mommy up there
[2:07:02] and brother bottom just he said I almost
[2:07:05] fainted I had the little
[2:07:07] to my bosom and just kept my head down
[2:07:09] what is it it's a profit being crushed
[2:07:12] it's a man of God going through things
[2:07:15] in his life of losing his wife because
[2:07:19] they listen to the mother-in-law and
[2:07:22] she's a twenty-one year old lady passing
[2:07:26] away and she says to her husband you
[2:07:31] know where we went wrong we listen to
[2:07:33] mama
[2:07:34] we need to be careful about those around
[2:07:37] us that what we say is the thoughts of
[2:07:40] God and the word and we're not just
[2:07:41] venting and expressing our how many know
[2:07:45] what I'm talking about we listen to mama
[2:07:47] a mother-in-law God give us the right
[2:07:54] attitude today God give us the right
[2:07:57] spirit brother Timothy Pruett traveled
[2:07:59] through another church this week wasn't
[2:08:01] planning to go there didn't know and
[2:08:03] then he said yes and he spoke a message
[2:08:05] it was exactly what that church needed I
[2:08:07] praise the Lord for that this week we
[2:08:10] desired to come and visit you as a
[2:08:12] friendship and to visit your church not
[2:08:15] knowing that your pastor would be in the
[2:08:17] hospital today with sister Karen the
[2:08:20] Lord knew all that there might be
[2:08:23] something next week there might be
[2:08:25] another family there might be another
[2:08:27] issue there might be something happen to
[2:08:31] further break and try this bride but
[2:08:34] Lord let our hearts be right in the
[2:08:40] season of all of this that's going on
[2:08:46] even other believers are being broken at
[2:08:48] this time other churches are being
[2:08:50] crushed as it was but what about you
[2:08:53] what about I it's easy to talk about
[2:08:57] so-and-so it what would we do if it's
[2:08:59] that but what about us what about you
[2:09:01] what about me when it really comes down
[2:09:03] to it I want to rise let's bow our heads
[2:09:07] this afternoon
[2:09:18] maybe brother Timothy can prepare a
[2:09:20] little song and the musicians can play
[2:09:26] thank you Lord for these things that
[2:09:28] we're hearing even over the last week's
[2:09:32] what's the Lord's been speaking to you
[2:09:34] say God is alive God's been speaking now
[2:09:39] let us take it to heart and be personal
[2:09:43] bring it down home bring it down to you
[2:09:47] and I where we can say Lord I needed
[2:09:49] that can you take this encouragement
[2:09:57] today and take these words that's been
[2:09:59] spoken Lord forgive us if we settle down
[2:10:07] and become selfish
[2:10:12] forgive us Lord if we've just got into
[2:10:15] our own way of thinking our own family
[2:10:17] strain and we've missed you somewhere in
[2:10:21] that
[2:10:27] lor let our church services affect us
[2:10:30] more than just a temporary thing is more
[2:10:35] than a building and more than getting
[2:10:36] together but it's where the Word of God
[2:10:40] can speak into us o Jesus make us more
[2:10:46] sensitive is that what's in your heart
[2:10:49] today Lord help me to be more sensitive
[2:10:56] so sensitive Lord she's coming down to
[2:11:02] the end of her life and this mother
[2:11:03] sister hope was so wanting to confess to
[2:11:06] her husband it was just something that
[2:11:09] happened years ago and it's rayon
[2:11:11] chiffon rayon chiffon it was some
[2:11:13] stockings and you bought me those
[2:11:15] stockings and I gave them to your mother
[2:11:18] because they were for older women and I
[2:11:21] just wanted you to know that how far
[2:11:25] have we drifted how seared and hardened
[2:11:29] can we get when we can say things and do
[2:11:32] things so deeply and not even have a
[2:11:35] twinge of remorse Lord step inside of us
[2:11:40] Lord
[2:11:41] step inside of us as individuals in our
[2:11:44] families and in our church let us rise
[2:11:49] from brokenness and recognize the
[2:11:52] generation that we're living in maybe
[2:11:56] the hardest times of our lives maybe the
[2:11:58] most treacherous trying to figure that
[2:12:01] out or understand and we realize we
[2:12:03] can't do it in ourselves and the Holy
[2:12:07] Spirit's trying to just stop us for a
[2:12:09] little bit and give us a little window
[2:12:11] into that next room I thank God for the
[2:12:15] baptisms here in this local church I saw
[2:12:18] the ones from last Sunday in the weeks
[2:12:20] before and
[2:12:23] lord help us to be sensitive let us rise
[2:12:28] from the ashes of despair
[2:12:30] [Music]
[2:12:32] some of you serve the Lord for years and
[2:12:34] it can get kind of wearisome sometimes
[2:12:37] you can be doing things for the Lord and
[2:12:39] people take you wrong that's okay they
[2:12:44] did that to Jesus too there's been other
[2:12:49] brothers and sisters rise up with even
[2:12:51] greater battles than yours or mine and
[2:12:54] they just continued to walk forward what
[2:12:57] about you and I this afternoon I want to
[2:13:04] be Jesus to those around me who would
[2:13:09] like to join me and say that's been my
[2:13:10] desire for a long time I just want to be
[2:13:14] more of Jesus in my situation in my life
[2:13:16] Lord and I want all the things we've
[2:13:18] heard and all the things we've read and
[2:13:20] no one has just become practical working
[2:13:22] in our lives Lord but bypassed my mind
[2:13:27] today and my even my spirit and come
[2:13:29] deeper through my soul and then it rise
[2:13:32] up through all of these realms Lord
[2:13:34] Jesus let the healing balm to spread
[2:13:36] throughout the service and spread
[2:13:38] throughout this building I know we felt
[2:13:40] like rejoicing I know we felt like just
[2:13:43] running the aisles I know I did this is
[2:13:45] a this is the first Sunday morning
[2:13:47] service we've had since March if you
[2:13:51] would ask me what I felt it would just
[2:13:53] been like blowing out the steam but I
[2:13:58] just felt to speak on this brokenness
[2:14:00] speak in a certain channel that we rise
[2:14:03] up out of that and go on I pray the Holy
[2:14:08] Spirit would just rest upon every person
[2:14:10] whether they're young or whether they're
[2:14:12] old and give you and a freshness and a
[2:14:15] newness again as we stand to our feet
[2:14:18] right now let us just begin to worship
[2:14:21] the Lord and begin to thank him let's go
[2:14:24] to the next ring let's move to the next
[2:14:26] battle let's just let's just say God put
[2:14:29] blinders on my heart of all those things
[2:14:32] and I press toward the mark I'm
[2:14:35] moving forward I'm going on I will serve
[2:14:39] the Lord I will follow I will go just
[2:14:48] fill us Lord before we leave this
[2:14:50] building right now give us that spirit
[2:14:52] of freedom and liberty Lord give us the
[2:14:56] healing Lord maybe someone can be healed
[2:14:58] before we leave this place
[2:15:00] maybe the angel of the Lord will leave
[2:15:02] and go there in the Shreveport into room
[2:15:05] 14 she's moved from number 4 to 14 but
[2:15:11] now may the Spirit of God go to that
[2:15:13] room and raise up sister Karen for a
[2:15:16] testimony how they've poured out for
[2:15:20] others how they prayed for you but now
[2:15:22] we pray that direction we send the angel
[2:15:25] of the Lord we send the spirit of
[2:15:27] healing hallelujah maybe it's someone in
[2:15:35] this building needs to pray pray for
[2:15:37] someone else and then you find your own
[2:15:39] self being healed you find the Spirit of
[2:15:41] God falling on you you you feel that
