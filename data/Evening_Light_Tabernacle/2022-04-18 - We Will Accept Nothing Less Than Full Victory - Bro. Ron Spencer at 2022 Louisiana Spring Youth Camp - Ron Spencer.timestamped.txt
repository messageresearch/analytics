[44:36] two years ago in november
[44:38] we had invited brother kelly hildebrandt
[44:41] to come and
[44:42] speak for us over over the weekend
[44:46] and he had left
[44:48] saskatoon and begin to make his way and
[44:51] his first plane would get
[44:53] get delayed then he would go to calgary
[44:56] that motor would catch on fire
[45:00] and he would have to
[45:01] to spend the night in calgary then they
[45:04] would fly him to toronto
[45:07] and in toronto he would have to spend
[45:09] the night again because somehow they'd
[45:11] lost his ticket
[45:13] he didn't have seats to fly
[45:17] so he was going to speak on saturday
[45:19] night and sunday morning
[45:21] and so earlier in the week the lord had
[45:23] spoke to me to to deliver a sermon
[45:27] on don't worry
[45:29] and
[45:31] brother kelly wasn't able to arrive and
[45:33] so i spoke the sermon on
[45:35] don't worry
[45:37] the next morning
[45:40] he wasn't able to be there so we went to
[45:42] washington and picked him up at a
[45:44] complete different airport
[45:47] i told the audience i said
[45:49] what is going on is satan is trying to
[45:52] block
[45:54] the message
[45:55] because it's a message from god and and
[45:58] satan is doing his very best to block it
[46:00] he'll do the same thing this morning if
[46:02] you can
[46:03] to try to block the visitation of god in
[46:06] your personal life and he did that with
[46:08] abraham and sarah
[46:12] when brother kelly entered into pulpit
[46:14] that afternoon
[46:16] he he he presented me with a coin
[46:20] and it's this coin it's a coin that is a
[46:22] commemoration of d-day
[46:26] and on the back the inscription says
[46:28] that we will accept nothing less
[46:32] than full victory
[46:35] on the front there's a grain of sand
[46:37] that is in in the
[46:39] embedded in it
[46:40] to where that it came from normandy
[46:44] there's a great war that happened
[46:47] tremendous amount of people lost their
[46:48] lives
[46:50] i didn't realize that we were preparing
[46:52] to step into a great war
[46:55] ourselves
[46:56] within the coming months we would be
[46:58] told that we had cancer in our lungs
[47:02] and in our in our lymph nodes
[47:05] spotted on our kidneys that are on our
[47:07] liver
[47:08] then
[47:09] then then about a month later after that
[47:11] we'd be told that we had
[47:13] we had uh brain cancer
[47:16] and would have uh had three
[47:18] uh tumors at that time and one would be
[47:21] removed
[47:24] at that time they gave me four months to
[47:26] live
[47:28] if i left it alone it would be i would
[47:30] live about two months
[47:32] if i left that one tumor alone we had
[47:35] about two weeks to live
[47:39] doctors give their reports
[47:43] they give their reports but we have an
[47:45] option
[47:48] and i stand here to encourage every one
[47:50] of you every one of us are in a
[47:52] different battle
[47:54] your battle may not be cancer it may not
[47:57] be terminal
[47:59] over the last couple of months
[48:01] doctors have asked me how much longer do
[48:03] you want to fight i want to fight to the
[48:05] end
[48:07] that's what i want to do i want to fight
[48:08] to the end
[48:17] i want to admonish you today i want this
[48:20] courage to be in your heart
[48:22] you may not be fighting cancer
[48:26] you might not be fighting a lot of
[48:27] different things that other people are
[48:29] fighting but there's no quit in none of
[48:32] us quitting is not an option we're not
[48:35] people that turn around and run
[48:38] we stand in the face of danger by the by
[48:42] the grace and the help of almighty god
[48:45] sure there's going to be incredibly
[48:47] difficult
[48:48] days but god is with us
[48:51] and who better to have with us
[48:55] than to have god with us
[48:59] the scripture says and what shall we
[49:01] then say to these things
[49:03] if god be for us
[49:06] who can be against us
[49:09] if we've got god on our side
[49:12] we cannot lose
[49:14] i want you to just turn to your neighbor
[49:16] and say we can't lose if god's on my
[49:18] side
[49:23] psalms 46 says this god is our refuge
[49:27] and strength of present help in the in
[49:29] trouble
[49:30] therefore will not we fear
[49:33] though the earth be moved though

[50:59] brother ron you don't know what i'm
[51:00] going through well maybe this will be an
[51:02] encouragement to us
[51:04] on our roughest days
[51:07] our lowest hours
[51:09] of despair
[51:10] even in those times
[51:14] we're still chosen
[51:18] blessed
[51:19] favored
[51:21] forgiven
[51:23] loved
[51:24] led by god
[51:26] victorious
[51:28] inheritance of the heaven's glory
[51:31] privilege to walk with our creator
[51:35] we're married to the king of kings
[51:37] he called us his beloved
[51:40] [Applause]
[51:43] we're strong in fight in faith armed to
[51:46] fight devils
[51:49] entrusted with god's word the most
[51:52] powerful weapon protected by the arm of
[51:54] the almighty he placed a hedge around us
[51:59] we have an assurance that each time we
[52:01] call he hears and he answers and he our
[52:05] answer from god is always good
[52:09] rest
[52:11] hope
[52:13] peace
[52:14] and joy
[52:15] is ours
[52:18] then why would we let the devil rob it
[52:21] from us
[52:25] even in the dark
[52:28] it is light around us
[52:31] even in the valley
[52:33] we are so blessed
[52:38] there's a leader called zelinski
[52:42] he's been called a modern-day
[52:44] hero modern day churchill
[52:49] he has extreme resolve
[52:52] extreme courage
[52:55] the odds are against him
[52:58] time
[52:59] and an enemy will destroy him
[53:02] but he stands there calling for help
[53:06] begging and pleading
[53:08] is there any nation
[53:11] is there any army that will come to
[53:13] stand in our defense
[53:15] is there anybody who cares
[53:19] on the other hand
[53:25] we're children of god
[53:29] we're amateur gods standing on the earth
[53:33] we are not alone
[53:36] and when we cry there's tens of
[53:38] thousands of angels
[53:41] begin to come to where we're at
[53:44] and you may never see them
[53:47] your spirits around your eyes may never
[53:49] come open to it but you are not alone in
[53:52] your battle
[53:55] god is on your side
[54:02] he will sin like hornets before you
[54:05] driving back your enemy
[54:07] there will be things that you will not
[54:10] have to go through because he has
[54:12] already taken bombardments and blowed
[54:15] them out of the way
[54:17] because you're his children
[54:25] we have the power of life and death in
[54:27] our tongues
[54:29] we can speak negativity
[54:31] or we can speak positive
[54:35] we can create a world around us
[54:39] i don't care if you live where 10 000
[54:41] believers are or you're by yourself
[54:44] it matters not
[54:47] you don't need a thousand people to
[54:49] crack you up
[54:50] god's with you
[54:58] we're not a bunch of cowards
[55:02] we've been called to this battle
[55:04] we've been procrastinated to this battle
[55:07] god has built us to overcome
[55:10] when he told joshua be strong and
[55:14] courageous
[55:15] that was god's words to a believer
[55:18] and god's words
[55:20] do not have an expiration date on it
[55:25] milk has an expiration date
[55:27] god's words does not have an expiration
[55:30] date he is telling you i want you to be
[55:33] strong
[55:34] you may be the only one in your school
[55:36] you may be the only one in your job
[55:42] but god's got you there as a testimony
[55:46] that this message works
[55:48] [Music]
[55:51] then what are we afraid about
[55:53] possess the gates
[55:56] we have got god's promise
[55:58] we have his word we have his holy spirit
[56:01] angels are encamped about everything's
[56:04] in order
[56:06] every wall can be took down
[56:09] it's already took damage
[56:12] the son of god goes before us his
[56:14] banners is a waving and there's nothing
[56:17] can stand the stand in the way of a
[56:20] saint going to meet the promise of god
[56:24] death can't stop it
[56:27] the grave can't stop
[56:30] the devil can't stop it
[56:32] we're more than conquerors
[56:34] sickness
[56:38] is perfect for you
[56:41] death is conquered for you
[56:45] unbeliever

[56:55] you say i got
[56:56] temper i can't get over it's already
[56:59] conquered

[57:05] how can you lose
[57:15] george washington was at the persistent
[57:17] at valley forge
[57:20] all the odds was against him
[57:22] and the enemy was across the river but
[57:26] after all night in prayer
[57:28] the american soldiers with no shoes on
[57:31] their feet
[57:32] about one-third of them had shoes and
[57:34] they crossed that river at valley forge
[57:36] through the ice
[57:38] three musket bullets went through his
[57:41] coat
[57:42] but he had an answer from god
[57:46] and there was no need of him backing
[57:48] down

[58:31] peter
[58:34] cartwright a red sea could not stop
[58:37] moses
[58:48] your storms may be huge
[58:50] but they're not too big for our god
[58:52] [Applause]
[58:56] the scripture says written from a
[58:58] dungeon
[59:01] who shall separate us from the love of
[59:03] christ
[59:04] shall tribulation or distress or
[59:06] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[59:09] peril of sword
[59:11] as it is written for thy sake we're
[59:13] killed all the day long
[59:15] and we're accounted as a sheep for a
[59:17] slaughter
[59:23] nay and all these things
[59:25] i love this
[59:27] we're more than conquerors
[59:30] through him that loved us
[59:37] for i am persuaded
[59:39] that neither death
[59:41] nor life
[59:42] nor angels
[59:44] nor principalities
[59:47] nor powers
[59:49] nor things present nor things to come
[59:52] nor height nor death or any other
[59:55] creature shall be able to separate us
[59:57] from the love of god which is in christ
[59:59] jesus our lord
[1:00:04] listen if i can stand here with death
[1:00:07] cells trying to destroy my body
[1:00:11] and preach to you
[1:00:12] victory in the face of girls
[1:00:24] how much more can you
[1:00:27] and look at your devil and tell him
[1:00:30] you're defeated in the name of jesus

[1:00:38] longer
[1:00:54] let me give you this quotation be still
[1:00:57] and know that i'm god
[1:00:59] i'm bigger than your problem
[1:01:02] i'm bigger than your circumstance
[1:01:04] i'm bigger than your situation this is
[1:01:07] not your battle
[1:01:10] you don't have to handle this
[1:01:12] this is god's battle
[1:01:14] [Applause]
[1:01:16] god will work it out
[1:01:20] all you have to do is be still and know
[1:01:23] that i am god
[1:01:27] i want to say this to you never never
[1:01:29] never never never never give up
[1:01:37] in our god dna there's no quitting
[1:01:41] there's no going back
[1:01:43] we have come
[1:01:45] to win this battle
[1:01:47] we have not walked up on the shores of
[1:01:49] normandy
[1:01:53] to lose
[1:01:54] we've left families we've left a lot of
[1:01:57] security and we've come to win
[1:02:11] jesus did not leave the paradises of
[1:02:13] heaven
[1:02:15] where angels and seraphims worshiped him
[1:02:18] but he put on the cloak of humanity he
[1:02:21] did not come here to lose
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:25] he did not come to take satan's offer
[1:02:29] to pull you to a different kingdom or to
[1:02:32] get you there or get you over there
[1:02:35] we did not come
[1:02:38] to lose this battle
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:40] [Applause]
[1:02:44] jesus looked right in the gale forces of
[1:02:47] hell
[1:02:48] hallelujah and defeated it
[1:02:52] for me and you
[1:02:54] yes i declare to you that we have a
[1:02:56] champion
[1:02:59] our champion is not in hollywood
[1:03:02] it is not in washington d.c
[1:03:06] our champion lives on the inside of us
[1:03:10] satan has fought this champion before in
[1:03:12] long
[1:03:14] he knows what you're capable of doing
[1:03:24] did you get that
[1:03:26] he knows he's
[1:03:28] he's fought that look
[1:03:31] he's fought that atmosphere before
[1:03:36] he's wondered how it got inside of you
[1:03:39] and he knows what you're capable of
[1:03:43] if he can only keep you from speaking
[1:03:48] if he can only keep you from worshiping
[1:03:52] if he can only keep you from taking your
[1:03:54] position
[1:03:55] but you're
[1:03:56] absolutely undefeatable when you
[1:03:59] recognize who you are and what you've
[1:04:02] been sent here for
[1:04:10] we have a mission on the earth
[1:04:14] more than to sit on a couch and play a
[1:04:16] game
[1:04:21] it's more than just to waste our life
[1:04:22] away and watch the minutes time kick
[1:04:25] until we become grey-headed
[1:04:28] but we got a mission
[1:04:31] we got a mission on the earth
[1:04:40] they have told me to get myself a bucket
[1:04:42] list
[1:04:45] things that i would want to do
[1:04:47] before i finish
[1:04:50] okay
[1:04:52] well here's one of those things
[1:04:59] they might have been talking about
[1:05:00] national parks
[1:05:03] or riding a bull
[1:05:09] learning to swim
[1:05:14] so if if i've got to get a bucket list
[1:05:17] here's a good here's a good start
[1:05:22] an understanding in the bucket list
[1:05:24] you're to enjoy every second of the
[1:05:26] moment
[1:05:28] of when you're doing the project
[1:05:30] so if it's my bucket list let's just
[1:05:32] make you a part of the bucket list
[1:05:48] let's make this the greatest epic
[1:05:49] meeting that there's ever been
[1:05:53] while rush is doing her thing and rome's
[1:05:55] doing their thing and washington's doing
[1:05:58] their thing the blood of jesus
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:03] she christ in victory
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:09] we refuse to be defeated
[1:06:25] we have met him toe-to-toe
[1:06:28] we're not shadow boxing no more
[1:06:30] we're not dancing around just to see if
[1:06:32] we can dance around
[1:06:34] we know that we've got more power than
[1:06:36] the devil
[1:06:37] [Applause]
[1:06:39] if he could have heather already took
[1:06:40] you out in the world
[1:06:44] he's ain't never gone in hell against
[1:06:47] you he sent every spirit that he can
[1:06:49] come to try to get a hold of your life
[1:06:52] and turn you a different way but
[1:06:54] something's on the inside of you that's
[1:06:56] holding
[1:06:59] it's on lawn when you can't hold on to
[1:07:02] yourself
[1:07:04] and there's no turning back
[1:07:13] it's not that you've got a hold of him
[1:07:16] he's got a hope of you
[1:07:19] and that's the whole difference
[1:07:26] your energy will fail
[1:07:28] you'll get distracted but god never gets
[1:07:32] distracted
[1:07:33] you are his crowning achievement
[1:07:36] you're what the whole plan is
[1:07:55] no doubt it's been quoted to you before
[1:08:02] people of texas
[1:08:04] february the 24th of
[1:08:07] 1836
[1:08:16] the chief officer sent out a letter
[1:08:20] all americans in the world
[1:08:23] fellow citizens
[1:08:24] compatriots
[1:08:26] i am besieged
[1:08:28] by a thousand or more
[1:08:30] of the mexican
[1:08:32] under santa ana
[1:08:35] and i have sustained
[1:08:38] quite a statement in it
[1:08:42] not lost an inch
[1:08:45] a continual bombardment
[1:08:49] and cannon fire for 24 hours
[1:08:54] and i have not lost a man
[1:08:59] the enemy has demanded a surrender
[1:09:02] at discretion otherwise
[1:09:05] the garrison
[1:09:07] are to be put to the sword
[1:09:09] in the fort if the fort is taken
[1:09:14] you know the devil sent you
[1:09:17] a lot of bombardments
[1:09:20] you need to answer him
[1:09:27] you need to answer him
[1:09:31] just because he's doing all that firing
[1:09:33] and blowing up
[1:09:34] you need to respond
[1:09:39] and i've answered the demand with a
[1:09:41] cannon shot
[1:09:43] and our flag still weighs proudly
[1:09:47] from all the walls
[1:09:49] i shall never surrender or sound
[1:09:52] retreats
[1:09:55] [Applause]
[1:09:58] at the bottom of the letter it said
[1:10:01] p.s the lord is on our side
[1:10:07] if i could send the letter to hell
[1:10:25] from easter cat 2022
[1:10:28] we shall never surrender
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:33] we shall never sound retreat
[1:10:36] we'll not lose a wine
[1:10:40] we're gonna stand our ground
[1:10:46] because the lord is on our side
[1:10:59] let us make a declaration this morning
[1:11:01] standing in the midst of the darkness of
[1:11:03] laodicea
[1:11:05] when brother branham couldn't see past
[1:11:07] 1977
[1:11:09] most of you were born after 1977
[1:11:12] in total darkness
[1:11:15] but god knew you were coming
[1:11:17] so he equipped you with the best that he
[1:11:19] could equip you with
[1:11:21] more than a tape recorder
[1:11:24] more than a bible
[1:11:26] more than god sent a prophet but he gave
[1:11:29] you a word that you can grab a hold of
[1:11:31] and eat the book
[1:11:32] and then you become a part of that open
[1:11:34] book
[1:11:35] and you see yourself in it
[1:11:38] and it's more than paul and james and
[1:11:40] john and nehemiah nehem
[1:11:45] but it's you
[1:11:47] it's more than your favorite preacher
[1:11:51] more than deacons and song leaders it's
[1:11:53] you standing in the midst of the
[1:11:55] darkness
[1:11:58] and the devil limps his way back to hell
[1:12:01] whipped again
[1:12:02] day after day after dariatic day
[1:12:05] yesterday
[1:12:18] we're literally beacons of light in the
[1:12:21] darkest of nights
[1:12:24] may we say like john paul jones
[1:12:27] we have not begun to fight yet
[1:12:32] brother brandon would give you the
[1:12:34] quotation it's not the size of the dog
[1:12:36] in the fight
[1:12:38] it's the size of the fight that's in the
[1:12:40] dog
[1:12:44] i've always liked that quote
[1:12:52] i serve a big god
[1:12:55] i serve an unlimited god
[1:12:59] i serve a god that's never been defeated
[1:13:02] i serve a god that has never been in a
[1:13:05] crisis
[1:13:10] i don't know what kind of god you serve
[1:13:12] but i serve a god
[1:13:14] that has the whole world in his hand
[1:13:16] and i happen to be on that world
[1:13:20] every situation of our life
[1:13:22] god's got it in his hand
[1:13:26] the scripture says before i formed thee
[1:13:28] in the belly and the belly
[1:13:31] i knew thee
[1:13:33] and before thou camest out of the womb
[1:13:35] and i sanctified thee
[1:13:37] and i ordained thee a prophet
[1:13:39] unto the nations
[1:13:42] god knew
[1:13:51] and you are beautiful in god's eyes
[1:13:59] sisters
[1:14:00] don't you left never let the devil
[1:14:03] tell you that you're plain
[1:14:08] don't ever let the devil
[1:14:11] compare you to hollywood
[1:14:15] to try to make you sell out
[1:14:18] because you are the queen of heaven
[1:14:22] and when when there are no more marilyn
[1:14:24] monroes and whoever
[1:14:36] hallelujah
[1:14:40] jesus said when brother brown said he
[1:14:42] said
[1:14:43] he might have been a man crying
[1:14:46] but when he called that that man from
[1:14:48] the out of the grave
[1:14:52] that had been there four days
[1:14:54] his soul
[1:14:58] journey somewhere
[1:15:00] i don't know where it is at
[1:15:02] neither do you
[1:15:04] so anyway he he called him back
[1:15:08] corruption knew its master
[1:15:13] the soul knew its creator
[1:15:16] and a man that's been dead and stood on
[1:15:19] his feet
[1:15:21] and lived again
[1:15:23] after being dead four days
[1:15:26] that was more than a man
[1:15:29] that was god
[1:15:31] i'm taking a minute to remind you
[1:15:33] if god is on your side
[1:15:36] let's just see how big he is
[1:15:39] we remember
[1:15:41] he believed his own word and created a
[1:15:44] son
[1:15:46] he believed his own word and created
[1:15:48] solar systems
[1:15:53] and he believed his own word and watched
[1:15:56] you come into existence
[1:15:58] pre-planning you before the foundation
[1:16:01] of the world and watching over your
[1:16:03] lineage
[1:16:05] all the way down
[1:16:09] that's the kind of planned parenthood i
[1:16:11] agree with
[1:16:15] it was a man when he was on the
[1:16:17] mountaintop that night hungry and looked
[1:16:20] all around in a fig tree
[1:16:22] and to find something to eat he was a
[1:16:25] man when he was hungry
[1:16:27] but when he taken five biscuits and two
[1:16:29] fish
[1:16:30] and fed
[1:16:32] five thousand
[1:16:34] he was more
[1:16:39] than a man
[1:16:43] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:16:45] forever
[1:16:47] that's more than just poetic words
[1:16:51] he's never lost any of his power
[1:16:58] the worst sinner in this building today
[1:17:01] getting saved does not diminish his
[1:17:04] power one bit
[1:17:06] the worst cancer patient
[1:17:09] sister erica
[1:17:10] the worst cancer patient that there is
[1:17:13] that's not diminish his power one a
[1:17:15] little iota
[1:17:20] why you could pour 20 foot of concrete
[1:17:23] on sister karen's grave
[1:17:29] on resurrection morning she's coming
[1:17:31] down that ground
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:17:44] you see we are committed
[1:17:46] and committed is more than just being
[1:17:48] talented
[1:17:50] committed as being more than just
[1:17:52] showing up and being entitled
[1:17:55] you got to give your whole heart to it
[1:17:59] committed is every day
[1:18:03] knowing there's no going back
[1:18:06] being totally committed
[1:18:11] you see it's not just for yourself
[1:18:14] but it's for those around you
[1:18:17] norman schwarzkopf
[1:18:19] a general in the gulf war
[1:18:22] he talked about an effective army
[1:18:25] he said it's not technology
[1:18:29] it's not the number of soldiers
[1:18:32] there's two things to evaluate when
[1:18:34] evaluating an army
[1:18:37] dedication to the cause
[1:18:41] and the will to fight
[1:18:54] brother ron i've been in some difficult
[1:18:56] things
[1:18:58] let me remind you there's no miracles
[1:19:00] without a mess
[1:19:05] when brother branham was standing with
[1:19:07] the angel of the lord in the cave
[1:19:10] he talked about the disease
[1:19:12] that i'm fighting and sister erica's
[1:19:14] fighting and many more are fighting
[1:19:18] and it was nothing to our god
[1:19:24] totally nothing to our god you're
[1:19:26] listening you're laying in a hospital
[1:19:28] bed and the doctors have give you up
[1:19:31] our god is greater than every problem
[1:19:33] that you've got
[1:19:36] if a little girl could lay over nine
[1:19:39] years
[1:19:41] and wouldn't have the strength to be
[1:19:42] able to raise her head up
[1:19:45] and she began to read about a god
[1:19:47] that all things were possible
[1:19:51] she began to believe
[1:19:55] all of the people around there didn't
[1:19:56] have that revelation but she reached out
[1:19:59] beyond the darkness of her circumstances
[1:20:03] if we could reach beyond the darkness of
[1:20:06] our circumstances
[1:20:07] [Applause]
[1:20:08] brother ron but i've been hurt i've been
[1:20:11] destroyed my life's been destroyed reach
[1:20:14] beyond your circumstances
[1:20:26] we can talk of a memphis girl
[1:20:28] a blind man in bombay
[1:20:30] a mexican girl
[1:20:33] that her babies dead
[1:20:35] and everybody's saying bury it but she
[1:20:38] was believing in a god who can
[1:20:43] that's what i'm standing here for today
[1:20:45] [Applause]
[1:20:51] brother donnie i just happen to believe
[1:20:54] that i can go home
[1:20:57] and on wednesday when i have all the
[1:20:59] scans
[1:21:00] i just happen to believe
[1:21:03] that the god that i serve
[1:21:06] can cause that doctor to say
[1:21:09] you don't have no more cancer ron
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:23] so with that i
[1:21:25] i stand here and say this to you
[1:21:29] i press towards the mark of the high
[1:21:31] calling
[1:21:33] for the prize of the high calling of god
[1:21:36] in christ jesus
[1:21:38] i can stand here and quote to you yea
[1:21:40] though i walk to the valley of the
[1:21:42] shadow of death
[1:21:44] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:21:46] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:21:51] a lot of people that can quote a lot of
[1:21:52] things but they've never been in a
[1:21:54] battle
[1:21:55] but a man that's got blood on his sword
[1:21:58] he knows a living god
[1:22:02] many of you've been in some battles and
[1:22:04] you've had some real heartaches
[1:22:06] but i want to say this to you
[1:22:10] he's on your side
[1:22:12] many of you had miracles before
[1:22:15] and the devil keeps coming back over and
[1:22:17] over and over and over again
[1:22:20] just because you come and get victory in
[1:22:22] a camp like this
[1:22:23] and you go away back to your normal life
[1:22:28] and the devil meets you on tuesday or
[1:22:30] wednesday and he begins to bombard you
[1:22:34] it don't mean you have to take it
[1:22:36] [Applause]
[1:22:47] we are warriors
[1:22:48] [Applause]
[1:22:50] and warriors know how to fight
[1:22:53] god put fight on the inside of us
[1:23:01] brother ryan but i've got i've got
[1:23:03] incredible critics
[1:23:05] that say all matter of things against me
[1:23:08] i want to remind you of one principle
[1:23:11] the critic
[1:23:13] is the one that testifies
[1:23:16] that you are the masterpiece
[1:23:23] the critic
[1:23:25] testifies
[1:23:27] that you're the masterpiece
[1:23:41] we face battles on a lot of fronts
[1:23:53] maybe you're a spectator
[1:23:58] a spectator
[1:24:01] don't have to go to a practice
[1:24:09] spectator never has to come under
[1:24:11] criticism
[1:24:14] they can go to their favorite ball team
[1:24:17] sit there
[1:24:19] their arms crossed
[1:24:23] if i were the coach
[1:24:33] if i was the pastor
[1:24:40] if i was a songwriter
[1:24:45] this is what i do
[1:24:48] if i ran this church
[1:24:52] you see but they don't have to pay no
[1:24:54] cost
[1:24:56] they're just a spectator
[1:25:02] and the spectator's not getting blood on
[1:25:04] his hands
[1:25:06] no sweat pouring from his brow
[1:25:10] everybody wants to carry the olympic
[1:25:13] medal but nobody wants to get up at two
[1:25:15] and three o'clock in the morning to
[1:25:16] train
[1:25:18] everybody wants to go to heaven
[1:25:33] but they don't want to get their hands
[1:25:35] dirty fighting devils
[1:25:38] but for the believer
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:44] i'm ready when i come to church
[1:25:46] i enter into his face with thanksgiving
[1:25:49] into his clothes with praise
[1:25:51] i'm ready to have church
[1:25:54] that's what i've been built for
[1:26:08] brother ron sometimes i just feel like
[1:26:10] quitting
[1:26:11] what don't we all
[1:26:16] it's an urge
[1:26:18] every champion has felt it
[1:26:21] every prophet has felt it
[1:26:24] even jesus prays it in the garden
[1:26:32] if it will be possible let this cup pass
[1:26:34] from me
[1:26:37] brother branham wanted to go to the
[1:26:38] mountains
[1:26:41] if i you know i'll come back when you
[1:26:43] give me a word of the lord i'll come
[1:26:44] back down
[1:26:48] you'd like to get away from the pressure
[1:26:52] presidents feel it
[1:26:55] kings feel it
[1:26:57] we heard last night about lions
[1:27:01] lions have felt it
[1:27:04] every winner has felt the urge to quit
[1:27:08] to walk away
[1:27:10] i've had enough
[1:27:14] every soldier has felt it
[1:27:20] every victorious person has felt it
[1:27:24] the urge
[1:27:26] to quit
[1:27:32] let me just remind you
[1:27:36] you could
[1:27:38] you would
[1:27:40] if you could
[1:27:56] but it's like a fire that shut up on the
[1:27:58] inside of your bones
[1:28:04] it's about church time all of a sudden
[1:28:06] you get dressed
[1:28:08] and that depression that's been on you
[1:28:10] all week
[1:28:12] told you to quit all the time you get
[1:28:14] dressed in spite of it
[1:28:16] you get in the car in spite of it
[1:28:19] [Applause]
[1:28:23] and you make your way to church in spite
[1:28:25] of it
[1:28:35] i thought i had them walking away but
[1:28:38] something on the inside of them has took
[1:28:41] them back to church
[1:28:50] and when the song is saying when they're
[1:28:51] redeemed are gathering in you begin to
[1:28:54] feel something charging from the inside
[1:28:56] of your body
[1:29:05] when the song says you don't know like i
[1:29:07] know
[1:29:09] what he's done for me
[1:29:11] and you begin to think about the
[1:29:13] victories that you've had in your life
[1:29:16] you forget everything that the devil has
[1:29:18] said because you don't know
[1:29:21] like i know
[1:29:23] i've been there in the valley i've been
[1:29:25] there in the darkness and something held
[1:29:28] onto me
[1:29:29] when i couldn't hold on
[1:29:33] glory
[1:29:34] [Applause]

[1:31:07] are a free country
[1:31:09] and it declares freedom
[1:31:14] from a kingdom that was ruling over us

[1:31:21] we wasn't going to pay them taxes no
[1:31:23] more
[1:31:25] if you're from britain today or from
[1:31:27] england today

[1:32:41] some of them lost everything that they
[1:32:43] had
[1:32:44] but they were willing

[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:48] than full
[1:41:49] victory
[1:41:50] [Applause]
[1:42:05] the power of life and death is in your
[1:42:06] tongue
[1:42:08] and you have showed up
[1:42:10] and you know who you are
[1:42:14] let's go ahead and pull our swords this
[1:42:15] morning
[1:42:16] [Applause]
[1:42:20] we didn't just come here for a show
[1:42:22] we come here for a fight
[1:42:25] and you're fighting for your spiritual
[1:42:27] life
[1:42:28] and if that line is after you to eat you
[1:42:32] and he thinks your lunch
[1:42:35] let's get close enough that we can spit
[1:42:37] in his eye
[1:42:39] and then cut his head off
[1:43:05] we packed our bags
[1:43:10] we borrowed money we did whatever we had
[1:43:13] to do to come to this meeting
[1:43:17] we got in sometimes
[1:43:20] way too stuffed vehicles
[1:43:30] to sleep in a presidential suite
[1:43:38] to eat at the king's table
[1:43:44] but you came here with a purpose
[1:43:48] you have been praying about things for
[1:43:50] weeks and months
[1:43:53] if i can get to that place where jacob
[1:43:55] was at
[1:43:56] when he wrestle with an angel of the
[1:43:58] lord
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:01] if i can get to that spot
[1:44:04] i don't like what i am
[1:44:06] i don't like what i have become
[1:44:09] i need a clutch from the king
[1:44:11] i need a touch from that supernatural
[1:44:14] power
[1:44:15] and i'm willing to wrassle it out
[1:44:33] why don't you just tell god right now
[1:44:35] i'll not turn you loose
[1:44:38] until i get what i need
[1:44:40] i don't want to go back home
[1:44:43] with a half a victory
[1:44:45] i want complete victory

[1:44:55] this is more than a work up
[1:45:02] i want god in my life
[1:45:04] when i watch my life i see god on
[1:45:06] operation
[1:45:08] not myself in operation i'm talking

[1:45:14] been wrestling with won't you leave that
[1:45:16] here
[1:45:19] why don't you leave that here
[1:45:23] maybe you've been sitting in prisons
[1:45:26] with change on your life
[1:45:29] and you'll go so far and you'll rise so
[1:45:30] high and then all of a sudden you're
[1:45:32] back down again and you're back down
[1:45:34] again and you're back down again and
[1:45:36] you're back down and you are just
[1:45:38] creating cycles
[1:45:41] of doing it again and again
[1:45:43] somewhere that cycle's got a break
[1:45:46] somewhere another you've got to get past
[1:45:47] the sound barrier i'm not talking about
[1:45:49] your neighbor i'm talking about you
[1:45:52] what did you come here for
[1:45:55] you didn't definitely didn't come here

[1:46:36] and keep reminding you over and over
[1:46:38] again

[1:47:28] interesting thing about this coin is
[1:47:30] i had a man in our church
[1:47:35] his name was max
[1:47:40] max was probably one of the roughest
[1:47:42] guys
[1:47:43] i've ever met in my life
[1:47:46] rough
[1:47:48] you you could look up gruff in the
[1:47:52] in the dictionary and his picture was
[1:47:54] right beside others
[1:47:58] nobody could get along with him he was
[1:48:01] just isolated
[1:48:03] drunk
[1:48:06] somebody invited him at church maybe it
[1:48:08] was his sister
[1:48:10] invited him to church and
[1:48:12] he started coming
[1:48:15] one night i was preaching over god
[1:48:18] watches over your predestinated seed
[1:48:24] and you might have been running the
[1:48:30] the waters of normandy
[1:48:35] and there wasn't a bullet
[1:48:38] no matter how great the army was there
[1:48:40] wasn't a bullet that could hit you
[1:48:46] because he predestinated you
[1:48:51] max
[1:48:54] was on
[1:48:55] one of those vessels
[1:48:58] he said i was standing there when they
[1:49:00] let the
[1:49:01] the gate down
[1:49:04] and just hundreds of us hit the water
[1:49:08] and he said the water turned to red
[1:49:12] and we ran
[1:49:15] my buddies were dying all around me
[1:49:18] and he said all i knew to do
[1:49:20] was run
[1:49:25] and he said when i got to the sand
[1:49:28] there was blood all over the sand and
[1:49:30] men laying everywhere
[1:49:33] and all i knew to do was just run
[1:49:38] and he said when i got to the wall i
[1:49:40] stood against that wall and he said
[1:49:44] how did i get here
[1:49:46] amen
[1:49:52] how did i get here
[1:49:56] [Music]
[1:49:58] he pulled me up close he said brother
[1:50:00] ron
[1:50:02] you answered the question tonight in
[1:50:03] this service
[1:50:06] that i've been wondering all my life

[1:50:37] people fell
[1:50:40] you ran on the sand
[1:50:42] and people fell
[1:50:44] you got to the wall where they were
[1:50:46] shooting

[1:50:59] and you're still standing

[1:51:32] problems
[1:51:33] when you couldn't hold on to yourself
[1:51:38] he took a hold of your hand
