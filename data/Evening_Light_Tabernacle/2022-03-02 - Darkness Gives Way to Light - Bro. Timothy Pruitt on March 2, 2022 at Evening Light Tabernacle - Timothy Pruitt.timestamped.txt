[22:09] before those that are sick with cancer
[22:12] in canada virginia here in our church
[22:14] and the many needs there of the
[22:16] believers in europe not only in the
[22:18] ukraine but even the believers in russia
[22:22] all over those parts that are being hit
[22:23] in this time
[22:25] amen and those right here
[22:27] in our own area the evening light would
[22:29] shine to our community stronger than
[22:31] ever amen
[22:32] if you would come
[22:33] open the service for us
[22:34] [Music]
[22:36] as we take these knees to the lord let's
[22:38] just
[22:38] remember brother ron with cancer sister
[22:40] erica parker with cancer i believe
[22:43] there's a sister there in canada who's
[22:45] on the
[22:46] desk door with cancer we have sister
[22:48] ruth wilson and brother ross with cancer
[22:51] but as i was in devotion this morning
[22:52] just praying the lord just reminded me
[22:55] he said not
[22:56] even
[22:57] cancer
[22:58] and i was like lord where did that come
[23:00] from
[23:01] you know so when we hear cancer
[23:03] immediately we're stricken with fear
[23:06] anxiety
[23:07] and we can take that as a fear complex a
[23:10] fear anxiety stress depression all forms
[23:12] because cancer has all forms there's
[23:14] cancer small and aggressive their cancer
[23:16] is big and mild and meek and it goes
[23:18] away but no matter what he said not
[23:21] even cancer
[23:23] and cancer was the greatest threat in
[23:25] that day
[23:27] and he said not even the greatest threat
[23:30] so whatever you're facing this this
[23:31] evening whatever you're going through
[23:33] whether it be physical whether it be
[23:35] spiritual just remember not even cancer
[23:39] can stand before your prayer
[23:42] and notice it wasn't a prophet that said
[23:44] it but it was the angel the lord told
[23:46] the prophet if you can get the people to
[23:48] believe
[23:50] you can elevate their faith and they can
[23:52] grab hold of this word and believe it
[23:53] for themselves not even cancer will
[23:56] stand before their prayer you will have
[23:58] your petition met and i believe he's as
[24:00] much god tonight as he was in now we got
[24:03] needs in the body and we're believers
[24:05] and we're going to pray for those needs
[24:07] and there is we got brothers and sisters
[24:09] in the ukraine right now that are
[24:11] suffering
[24:13] huddled up in a basement freezing cold
[24:15] because now an enemy has decided to
[24:17] attack their land but he gave us a
[24:19] promise not even cancer not even russia
[24:22] not even the greatest enemy can
[24:24] can destroy the purpose of god so let's
[24:26] just take these knees tonight in prayer
[24:29] and believe
[24:30] father we just bow our hearts before you
[24:32] tonight and lord we're so thankful that
[24:34] you have given us this revealed word
[24:38] lord it's much more than just words that
[24:41] are pinned on a paper it's much more
[24:43] than voice on a tape god this is a
[24:46] living reality we have seen manifested
[24:49] in our day this very word the very
[24:51] essence of christ living and breathing
[24:54] through men and women and we're thankful
[24:56] father that we have seen our name on the
[24:58] book we recognize who we are we
[25:00] recognize you have given us the
[25:02] authority through the word to be able to
[25:04] speak these things and not even cancer
[25:07] will stand before our prayer father we
[25:09] don't speak these things as humans lord
[25:12] because our human voice will only go so
[25:14] far but as oracles of god as instruments
[25:17] of righteousness lord we speak to the
[25:19] cancer that's afflicted ron spencer
[25:21] erica parker ruth wilson ross oglesby
[25:25] and many or lord we tell that cancer to
[25:27] leave right now in the name of jesus
[25:30] christ because we have been commissioned
[25:33] we have been given the authority to use
[25:35] the word of god and lord we speak these
[25:37] things as the sons and daughters of god
[25:39] tonight and we believe that cancer has
[25:42] to leave tonight we believe that ron
[25:44] spence is going to get his rest and
[25:46] cancer no more attack his body we're
[25:48] going to believe tonight lord that ruth
[25:49] wilson will receive her deliverance from
[25:52] cancer tonight erica parker also calls
[25:54] me father and many more we believe
[25:56] because you have given us a word of
[25:58] promise
[25:59] and lord we hold you to that promise
[26:01] tonight for it's not man's word it's
[26:03] your word and the prophet of god would
[26:05] teach us that you're obligated to the
[26:08] word and lord nothing will defeat your
[26:10] purpose and we are the very heart
[26:12] purpose of god and we're asking tonight
[26:14] lord for the movement of the spirit even
[26:17] now father in the ukraine go forth over
[26:20] there father may your holy spirit brood
[26:22] over the believers and bring an arm of
[26:24] protection to them god keep the bombs
[26:26] away keep the rubble away keep the
[26:27] destruction away god protect your people
[26:30] hide them under the shadow of your wings
[26:32] now father
[26:34] may you keep them during this difficult
[26:36] struggle difficult time lord
[26:38] we see what the enemy is after but you
[26:40] said not even cancer
[26:43] not even the greatest threat in that day
[26:45] and not even the greatest threat in this
[26:47] day can defeat our prayer so father on
[26:49] the wings of our prayer tonight we pray
[26:51] you'd go forth move in power and in
[26:54] manifestation use brother timothy
[26:56] tonight father we ask these things now
[26:58] in jesus name amen

[42:32] amen
[42:34] amen
[42:37] amen let's turn to psalms chapter 27 in
[42:39] verse 1.
[42:43] amen
[42:45] psalms chapter 27 and verse 1.
[42:48] you know this to be the rapture text
[42:51] that brother branham would take for the
[42:53] sermon the rapture
[42:55] psalms 27 verse 1 the lord
[42:58] is my light
[43:00] and my salvation
[43:02] whom shall i fear
[43:04] the lord is the strength of my life of
[43:07] whom shall i be afraid
[43:09] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[43:11] foes came upon me to eat my up my flesh
[43:14] they stumbled and failed
[43:16] the host should encamp about me
[43:19] my heart shall not fear and though war
[43:21] shall rise against me
[43:22] and this will i be confident
[43:25] one thing have i desired the lord that
[43:28] will i seek after
[43:29] that i may dwell
[43:31] in the house of the lord all the days of
[43:33] my life to behold the beauty of the lord
[43:36] and to inquire in his temple
[43:38] for in the time of trouble
[43:40] he shall hide me in his pavilion
[43:43] and the secret of his tabernacle shall
[43:46] he hide me he shall set me upon a rock
[43:51] amen let you be seated this evening like
[43:54] to speak to you on darkness
[43:56] gives way to light
[43:58] darkness gives away to light i you know
[44:01] it's quite an interesting
[44:02] [Music]
[44:03] uh
[44:05] scripture that brother branham would
[44:06] take
[44:07] for the rapture
[44:09] i believe it was of course directed of
[44:11] god that he would take these these few
[44:14] words that david would write
[44:16] and he would begin to speak about
[44:18] the lord is my light
[44:20] and my salvation whom shall i fear
[44:24] because i believe that i believe god
[44:26] knew that we would have plenty to fear
[44:28] in this time that we're living in i i
[44:30] believe he knew there would be plenty of
[44:32] darkness in this time that we're living
[44:35] in i believe he knew that we would have
[44:37] to have strength for the time that we're
[44:40] living in
[44:41] amen i believe he knew there would be
[44:43] the wicked there would be enemies there
[44:45] would be foes
[44:46] there would be cancers there would be
[44:48] covert there would be every kind of
[44:50] disease
[44:51] amen that would try to come up and eat
[44:53] your flesh but they stumbled and fell
[44:56] i i believe he knew that there would be
[44:58] a host that would try to encamp against
[45:00] the bride of jesus christ but yet in all
[45:03] of that my heart shall not fear
[45:05] and war would even rise against us but
[45:08] we would still have a confidence in him
[45:11] amen that i believe it's a wonderful
[45:13] thing for there to be still be a people
[45:15] or be of a people that has confidence in
[45:18] our god that no matter how bad it is or
[45:21] how difficult it is amen we haven't lost
[45:24] one one iota of confidence in him but we
[45:26] know that he has the answer amen for
[45:29] every situation and i i believe he knew
[45:31] there would be people that would desire
[45:33] and would seek after him in the time
[45:36] that we're living in amen that they
[45:38] would dwell in the house of the lord all
[45:40] the days of their life amen i believe
[45:43] that he knew that there would be a time
[45:44] of trouble and during this time of
[45:46] trouble he would have a pavilion or a
[45:49] secret place a tabernacle that we could
[45:51] hide in i believe that he would also
[45:54] know that he would need a rock that was
[45:55] a firm foundation that we could stand
[45:58] upon amen he knew amen the atmosphere
[46:00] that it would be around the time of
[46:02] exodus he knew the time that we were
[46:05] living in the situation the darkness all
[46:07] around us you know i find it very
[46:09] interesting that there's more people
[46:11] than ever having severe mind battles
[46:14] there's more people than ever dealing
[46:16] with suicidal thoughts there's more fear
[46:18] than there's ever been and amen we've
[46:20] had more advancement in science and more
[46:23] advancement in technologies but in all
[46:25] of our our greatness of humanity
[46:28] amen it hasn't done has been it's
[46:30] produced more thoughts were our bad
[46:32] thoughts and suicidal thoughts and and
[46:34] mind battles and fears and and
[46:37] perplexities and darkness and confusion
[46:40] wars and rumors of wars amen we're
[46:43] living in a very difficult time but it's
[46:46] also a very wonderful time amen it's the
[46:49] very moment it's the very time of the
[46:51] coming of the lord amen you know as we
[46:54] think about the time we're living in i
[46:55] was sent this by brother mike today a
[46:58] man was apologizing to his wife for
[47:00] having to raise children in the time of
[47:03] great trouble that we're in and the wife
[47:05] responded with a quote she had read
[47:07] earlier that day said never feel sorry
[47:10] for raising dragon slayers in a time
[47:13] when there are actual dragons
[47:17] hallelujah i i believe in all of this we
[47:20] don't have to feel sorry for raising
[47:22] children of the light when there's
[47:24] actual darkness that we're facing we
[47:26] don't have to feel sorry for raising
[47:28] sons and daughters who will stand and
[47:30] defy the darkness that are around us
[47:33] amen sons that will raise up and slay
[47:35] giants
[47:36] amen i think about moses his mom and dad
[47:39] no doubt thought it was a bad time maybe
[47:41] for a child to be born but god had a
[47:43] purpose for his life amen maybe david's
[47:46] mama thought it was a bad time for david
[47:48] to be born but god had a purpose for
[47:51] david's life
[47:52] amen i believe that even though you may
[47:54] think it's a bad time and a bad time to
[47:57] raise children god has a people amen
[47:59] that's going to raise up and slay every
[48:02] demon of sickness slaver demon of
[48:04] depression i believe there's men that's
[48:06] going to be raised up in the time that
[48:08] we're living in that's going to defy
[48:10] every dark spirit upon this earth that's
[48:12] going to defy the suicidal spot of
[48:15] suicidal mind battles that's trying to
[48:17] take the mind of men and the mind of
[48:19] women but there's going to be daughters
[48:21] of god that'll raise up and defy fear
[48:24] amen defy anxiety defy every spirit of
[48:27] hell
[48:28] hallelujah amen we need dragon slayers
[48:32] when there's actual dragons around we
[48:34] need men and daughters and sons of god
[48:36] that are raised up in the power of god
[48:39] and defy the devils that are trying to
[48:41] infiltrate this time that we're living
[48:43] in him amen i believe that even in the
[48:46] moments that we're looking at there's
[48:48] men and women that are raised up for
[48:50] such a time as this
[48:52] amen there was a church hill that was
[48:53] raised up amen for a certain time there
[48:56] was an eisenhower that was raised up for
[48:58] a certain time it was you can go through
[49:00] men of history that were raised up for a
[49:03] certain time amen don't leave yourself
[49:05] out you were raised up for this time
[49:08] you were raised up for this moment amen
[49:10] not to be just a young person going
[49:12] through life as if nothing has happened
[49:14] but with a purpose amen the purpose of
[49:17] of leaving this place of defying every
[49:20] work of darkness and raising up into the
[49:22] light amen we can see even the hebrew
[49:25] children maybe their moms and their dads
[49:27] thought it might have been a bad time to
[49:28] have children during their day in daniel
[49:31] but daniel and those men were raised up
[49:33] for a certain purpose
[49:35] amen daniel would speak about the time
[49:37] that we're living in daniel 12 and verse
[49:40] 1. it says at that time shall michael
[49:42] stand up the great prince which standeth
[49:45] for the children of thy people and there
[49:47] shall be a time of trouble such as never
[49:50] since was since there was a nation even
[49:52] to that same time but at that time thy
[49:56] people shall be
[49:58] hallelujah shall be delivered every one
[50:02] that shall be found written in the book
[50:06] hallelujah and many of them that sleep
[50:08] in the dust of the earth shall wake some
[50:10] to everlasting life some to shame and
[50:12] everlasting contempt and they that be
[50:14] wise shall shine
[50:17] shall shine as the brightness of the
[50:19] firmament and they that turn many to
[50:22] righteousness as the stars forever and
[50:25] ever
[50:27] amen i actually wore the clothes that i
[50:29] wore tonight on purpose amen
[50:32] i thought i wore a white shirt or some
[50:33] other color these colors this white
[50:35] would not have stood up quite as great
[50:37] but in the middle of the black all
[50:38] around the black pants and the black
[50:40] shirt you can see every white stripe
[50:43] hallelujah you can see every every cut
[50:46] across there amen and what is happening
[50:48] god is such a has such a he's
[50:51] orchestrated this time that we're living
[50:53] in them in such darkness that you can
[50:55] see every white light
[50:57] you can see every child of god you can
[51:00] see every son of god that's rising up
[51:02] against the darkness and screaming out
[51:04] it shall be light in the evening time
[51:08] in the middle of darkness light comes to
[51:11] dispel the darkness so god begins to
[51:14] fulfill his word and in fulfilling his
[51:16] word it might look dark but light is
[51:19] breaking
[51:21] amen psalms 119 and 105 says thy word is
[51:25] a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[51:29] path so the word being fulfilled
[51:32] actually gives light to you
[51:35] amen it gives light psalms 119 and 130
[51:38] says the entrance of thy words giveth
[51:41] light it giveth understanding to the
[51:44] simple
[51:45] you know when it tries it might as we've
[51:46] read i've said said this many times the
[51:48] last few few few services tries it might
[51:52] darkness can't stop it
[51:56] darkness wars will not stop prophecy
[51:59] from phil being fulfilled
[52:01] amen demons cannot stop prophecy from
[52:04] being fulfilled darkness will not stop
[52:08] light
[52:09] but prophecy will be fulfilled amen as
[52:12] we read the scripture this quote over
[52:14] here last last service but i'll read it
[52:16] again from this time on especially
[52:19] through the dark ages we'll see the
[52:21] children of flesh persecute and destroy
[52:24] the children of the spirit even they
[52:26] both claim one father even as it was a
[52:28] case of ishmael and isaac the darkness
[52:31] of spiritual corruption will deepen and
[52:33] the true light of god will fade until
[52:36] number wise it grows ever so faintly yet
[52:40] the promise of god will hold true
[52:44] that the light shineth in darkness and
[52:47] darkness can do nothing about it
[52:50] hallelujah amen it's dark but look to
[52:53] the light
[52:54] it's dark but look to the one who can
[52:56] produce the light amen it's dark amen
[52:59] but look up our redemption is drawing
[53:01] near
[53:03] hallelujah i ran across this scripture i
[53:05] don't know if i've ever read it before
[53:07] but ecclesiastes 11 verse 7 says truly
[53:10] the light is sweet
[53:12] and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes
[53:15] to behold the sun
[53:18] you know how it is you know we just come
[53:20] through a few days of great dreariness i
[53:23] i i'm just going to tell you i couldn't
[53:25] live in a place like that there was
[53:27] dreary all the time and rainy all the
[53:29] time and cloudy all the time amen you
[53:32] know we went through about four five six
[53:34] days what it was of of sun not seeing
[53:36] the sun for a long time i don't know
[53:39] about you but i'm about sick of this
[53:41] amen i like the sun i don't like the
[53:43] dreariness and then you know depression
[53:46] starts setting in and feelings of dread
[53:48] and frustration when the sun is not
[53:50] present can you imagine amen a world
[53:52] that's sitting and not in darkness and
[53:54] not knowing christ
[53:57] not ever seeing him moving a service not
[54:00] ever seeing him move in their lives and
[54:02] not ever seeing him or witnessing moving
[54:04] the power of his resurrection all you
[54:06] you know all you have is what he was
[54:08] twenty or two 000 years ago
[54:10] but the sun hasn't risen in their life
[54:13] to dispel the darkness
[54:15] it means nothing but gloominess there's
[54:17] nothing but frustration no wonder the
[54:19] world is groping around no wonder the
[54:22] world and men's hearts are failing for
[54:24] fear they haven't seen the sun
[54:29] but there it don't mean the sun's not
[54:31] there
[54:34] hallelujah brother branham was talking
[54:36] about the sun rising on a certain day at
[54:38] the emancipation proclamation when those
[54:41] slaves had been bound those colored
[54:43] colored brethren and sisters in the
[54:45] south when they used to have slavery and
[54:47] emancipation proclamation was signed
[54:49] they had been whipped they had been beat
[54:52] amen been slaves and a certain moment
[54:54] but they said a certain morning you're
[54:56] going to be free in a certain day on a
[54:58] sun up and when the sun rises all slaves
[55:01] could go free
[55:03] those poor decrepit heartbeating slaves
[55:05] were so anxious to be free till the
[55:07] strongest of them climb way up to the
[55:09] top of the hill and women and men the
[55:12] weaklings all the way down to the bottom
[55:14] ones that couldn't be strong enough to
[55:15] climb up but they began to listen and
[55:18] those great big men that were stronger
[55:20] climbed up to the top of the hill and
[55:22] after a while they saw the streaks of
[55:24] that sun rising
[55:26] it was still dark in the valley but the
[55:29] sun was rising and they began to relay
[55:31] it down the sun is up
[55:34] we're free and the next one hollered
[55:36] down we're free and the next one
[55:38] hollered down we're free why the sun is
[55:42] up
[55:43] it dispelled the darkness and the scream
[55:46] and the shout begin to go off why
[55:48] because the sun is up
[55:51] he said that was the rising of the
[55:53] estuary but now we have the rising of
[55:56] the esso in

[1:00:08] creature
[1:00:10] but light will always dispel darkness
[1:00:14] it always pushes it back
[1:00:17] darkness gives way to light
[1:00:20] you know one he's talking brother brown
[1:00:22] tells a story i love this
[1:00:24] so one time up in the kentucky mountains
[1:00:27] as i was preaching early in the
[1:00:28] afternoon i was preaching on hellfire
[1:00:30] and brimstone for the unbeliever
[1:00:35] yeah we still believe in that
[1:00:38] so there was a no logger come back in
[1:00:39] this coming to service
[1:00:42] and i said i said all you drunkards and
[1:00:45] he was one of them
[1:00:46] you better repent and get rightful with
[1:00:48] god
[1:00:51] and there'd been this fellow come in the
[1:00:52] night
[1:00:53] that night was going to go up there he
[1:00:55] said i'm going to go up there and i'm
[1:00:56] going
[1:00:56] i'm going to throw that old preacher out
[1:00:58] the window i'm tired of hearing this
[1:00:59] nonsense
[1:01:01] so he came in the door and somebody come
[1:01:03] told me that's the roughest bunch there
[1:01:05] is around his they're standing there
[1:01:07] great big burly looking fellas his arms
[1:01:10] crossed beard hanging down his face
[1:01:12] about 30 years old was a mean looking
[1:01:14] man
[1:01:15] kept looking at me
[1:01:17] and i just kept looking at him repent or
[1:01:19] perish
[1:01:21] repent or perish he said brother he
[1:01:24] stayed a little too long
[1:01:29] what happened he was full of darkness
[1:01:32] but life began to shine on him he stayed
[1:01:35] a little too long and the holy spirit
[1:01:37] got a hold on him and he fell to the
[1:01:39] floor and brother bradley said in
[1:01:40] another place he said he couldn't hardly
[1:01:42] make it to the altar but he was crying
[1:01:45] and screaming and kicking his way up
[1:01:47] there
[1:01:48] [Applause]
[1:01:49] hallelujah he came with his hands up
[1:01:52] over his head crying god be merciful to
[1:01:55] me
[1:01:58] hallelujah that's why people are full of
[1:02:00] darkness they don't like to stay around
[1:02:02] well
[1:02:02] around light but if you stay long enough
[1:02:05] that light will throw up and push away
[1:02:07] that darkness if you stay in the
[1:02:09] presence of god long enough it'll push
[1:02:11] away the temper it'll push away the fear
[1:02:14] it'll push away the anxiety it'll push
[1:02:16] away the rebellion it'll push it all
[1:02:18] away
[1:02:22] next morning or the next night i went to
[1:02:24] church and there was this little girl
[1:02:26] back there she handed me a bunch of
[1:02:28] flowers when i came in the door and she
[1:02:30] said brother bill i just come to bring
[1:02:32] you these flowers cause we got a new
[1:02:34] daddy at home
[1:02:37] and i want to show you that i love you
[1:02:39] for coming here and letting jesus make a
[1:02:42] new daddy for us
[1:02:45] light came and drove away the darkness
[1:02:53] amen maybe the darkness tonight's been
[1:02:54] laughing at you
[1:02:56] it's been making fun of you'll never
[1:02:58] you'll never be free you'll never you'll
[1:03:00] never rise up from that place you know
[1:03:02] let me give you a scripture for that
[1:03:03] micah 7 and verse 7 says therefore i
[1:03:06] will look unto the lord i will wait for
[1:03:09] the god of my salvation my god will hear
[1:03:12] me
[1:03:14] that's where you got to come to him in
[1:03:16] faith that's the problem with a lot of
[1:03:18] people they start talking to god but
[1:03:19] they start talking to in doubt
[1:03:22] well god if you do if you if if you know
[1:03:24] it's a big word for two letters if
[1:03:27] if you love me maybe you'll hear me if
[1:03:29] i'm more if i'm your child that ain't
[1:03:31] the way micah came to him he said i will
[1:03:34] wait for the god of my salvation because
[1:03:37] my god will hear me
[1:03:40] and he goes and speaks to the darkness
[1:03:41] he says rejoice not against me o my
[1:03:45] enemy
[1:03:46] for when i fall
[1:03:48] i shall rise
[1:03:50] and when i sit in darkness the lord
[1:03:52] shall be a light unto me
[1:03:55] amen may that darkness has knocked you
[1:03:58] down you need to turn back to that
[1:03:59] darkness say my god hears me and you may
[1:04:02] knock me down but i shall rise i may be
[1:04:05] in doubt and darkness but i will see
[1:04:07] light again cause god's gonna shine upon
[1:04:10] me
[1:04:14] darkness always dispels the light
[1:04:18] let's read a few in discernment here
[1:04:21] it says you have trouble for quite a
[1:04:22] while
[1:04:23] you was hurt inside of you is tore loose
[1:04:26] got some sort of intestinal trouble
[1:04:28] swelling up
[1:04:31] is i see you used to be a larger man but
[1:04:33] you lost a lot of weight from this many
[1:04:35] pounds have dropped off
[1:04:37] not only this but let me tell you
[1:04:39] something
[1:04:40] i see a dark shadow follow you till
[1:04:43] about five or six years ago and you
[1:04:46] became a christian at that time
[1:04:50] that man said that man speaks up and
[1:04:52] says that's right i accepted christ in
[1:04:54] moody church six years ago maybe five
[1:04:56] and a half and i'm going to tell you and
[1:04:58] this was his testimony as it speaks on
[1:05:00] tape
[1:05:01] and a twinkling of an eye my wife only
[1:05:04] here she could tell you the drinking and
[1:05:06] the tobacco habit which i'd had for 20
[1:05:09] years fell away like that
[1:05:14] well we still got that same light here
[1:05:16] tonight
[1:05:18] it did it to multiple people sitting
[1:05:20] right here in this congregation that
[1:05:22] would come here with an alcohol problem
[1:05:24] or a drug problem or or smoking or

[1:20:30] away on his lights and then all darkness
[1:20:33] scatters it separates them and he's
[1:20:35] pulling his little bride because he said
[1:20:37] i'll take a people out of the gentiles

[1:20:46] but jesus christ that's right he is the
[1:20:49] light the truth the life and there is no
[1:20:51] darkness in him and he scatters the
[1:20:53] darkness when he comes in because he is
[1:20:55] the word and the word is the light
[1:21:00] and this word is not getting weaker
[1:21:04] the power of god is not getting weaker
[1:21:08] darkness amen why would it not get
[1:21:10] weaker because darkness is getting
[1:21:12] greater
[1:21:13] so when there's a greater darkness you
[1:21:14] need a greater light
[1:21:17] amen so this power is not going down
[1:21:20] it's going up and up and up and up and
[1:21:24] greater and greater and greater that's
[1:21:26] why i believe we're going to see more
[1:21:28] miracles more things of god more power
[1:21:31] of god amen because there's not going to
[1:21:33] be less light it's going to be more

[1:21:44] happiness in your heart some joy in your
[1:21:46] heart listen we're not going down in the
[1:21:49] darkness

[1:21:53] saw a great light and that light is
[1:21:55] shining greater and greater and it's got
[1:21:58] such a drawing power that's going to
[1:22:00] draw us right out of this whole world
[1:22:03] hallelujah
[1:22:05] that's right when he spoke let there be
[1:22:08] light that was the word that became
[1:22:10] light and he speaks this it is the light
[1:22:12] of that age it's not a glare it's it's
[1:22:15] people may be living in a glare but he
[1:22:17] is the vindicated word he is absolutely
[1:22:20] the light in the time of darkness
[1:22:24] all the false glares and things will
[1:22:26] fade away
[1:22:27] but this light won't fade away
[1:22:29] and he says he that believeth in me
[1:22:33] the works that i do
[1:22:35] ye shall do also
[1:22:37] maybe i can say it like this the light
[1:22:39] that i have you shall have also
[1:22:46] he had enough light in him that opened
[1:22:48] up blinded eyes
[1:22:50] he had enough light in him that would
[1:22:52] give deaf ears back their hearing he had
[1:22:54] enough light in him that the mute would
[1:22:56] speak and the lame would walk amen the
[1:22:58] cur the people in their mind out of
[1:23:00] their minds would come back to
[1:23:01] themselves he had enough light in him he
[1:23:03] would dispel every darkness and he said
[1:23:05] the light
[1:23:06] that i have the things that i do
[1:23:10] shall ye do also
[1:23:15] the father has sent me
[1:23:17] come in him
[1:23:18] jesus then to say the same one sends you
[1:23:21] comes in you the works that he did then
[1:23:23] the same he does today because the word
[1:23:26] is made flesh and human flesh manifested
[1:23:28] itself as the light of the day there we
[1:23:30] are there it is just showing the way to
[1:23:32] the light in the light wise men who are
[1:23:35] not blinded by creeds and denominations
[1:23:37] will walk in that light there's a man
[1:23:40] here that can turn on the lights how
[1:23:42] does he turn them on by vindicating his
[1:23:44] word for this day
[1:23:47] hallelujah
[1:23:48] jesus the son of god who promises the
[1:23:50] word for this day is right here with us
[1:23:52] don't get scared
[1:23:55] did you hear the words of the prophet
[1:23:57] don't get scared
[1:23:58] don't pay attention to what they're
[1:24:00] doing because if you do you will walk
[1:24:03] into darkness
[1:24:08] so quote be wise
[1:24:10] they that do wise daniel said in the
[1:24:12] last days we'll do exploits
[1:24:16] they'll walk in the light for he is the
[1:24:17] light don't worry it may be dark
[1:24:21] look
[1:24:22] like they said look like they're going
[1:24:23] to try to force us everyone
[1:24:25] see their proclamations going out all
[1:24:27] these little churches coming into one
[1:24:29] great conglomeration of things
[1:24:35] but don't forget where he said
[1:24:39] you can read many times he said the next
[1:24:40] thing for the bride
[1:24:42] is the rapture
[1:24:46] that's quite a light
[1:24:49] that'll dispel a lot of darkness
[1:24:52] amen
[1:24:58] but as we said in darkness things looks
[1:25:00] very superstitious
[1:25:02] you wonder about it
[1:25:05] you don't know
[1:25:06] what's happening now over there in
[1:25:08] russia what's happening in ukraine
[1:25:10] what's what's happening globally around
[1:25:12] the world what's going on last two years
[1:25:14] been a lot of what's going on
[1:25:19] brother brown talks about superstitious
[1:25:21] mountain
[1:25:22] so i've heard of it for a long time
[1:25:24] heard many legends have been told about
[1:25:25] superstition
[1:25:27] i remember looking for it the first time
[1:25:29] and it was before day
[1:25:32] and a great big ghostly shadow hung to
[1:25:34] the east of me
[1:25:36] which is known as superstition
[1:25:38] said i heard about the indians how they
[1:25:40] would wouldn't go near it for they were
[1:25:41] afraid of it
[1:25:43] the spanish had mistreated them the
[1:25:44] early days when they was hunting for
[1:25:45] gold and they claimed it had evil
[1:25:47] spirits lived in it and all this stirred
[1:25:49] my curiosity
[1:25:51] but i only had a flashlight to see
[1:25:53] superstition and it wasn't enough
[1:25:57] he said but then i watched until after a
[1:25:59] while the
[1:26:00] majesty of the sun began to move upon
[1:26:03] the darkness
[1:26:05] and when it did
[1:26:06] and it separated the darkness from the
[1:26:08] light and it pressed the darkness back
[1:26:11] and finally she raised up to her
[1:26:13] highness up over the top of the mountain
[1:26:16] and it showed superstition just what it
[1:26:18] really was it lit up and it showed what
[1:26:21] it was and all the spooks and the fears
[1:26:24] i had had of superstition when the sun
[1:26:26] come up and the power was falling upon
[1:26:29] it all of that fled away
[1:26:33] the sun is the king of all lights in the
[1:26:36] natural light no matter how much
[1:26:38] artificial light we can have and we can
[1:26:40] gather together and we can never produce
[1:26:43] what the sun produces and when it rises
[1:26:46] all the rest of those artificial lights
[1:26:48] dim out
[1:26:50] now tonight you can go out in their
[1:26:51] parking lot and we got some nice lights
[1:26:53] that light up our parking lot but they
[1:26:55] only light it up nice at night
[1:26:58] they only light up real good in the dark
[1:27:00] come morning they still on you won't
[1:27:02] even notice them you'll drive up here
[1:27:04] i've done it before and look at wow i
[1:27:05] didn't realize them lights wrong you
[1:27:07] didn't even pay no attention to them
[1:27:08] they wouldn't make it have no effect on
[1:27:10] what was going on right there because
[1:27:13] the sun was up
[1:27:15] hallelujah amen when the sun rises
[1:27:18] darkness loses its effect
[1:27:21] artificial light loses its effect
[1:27:24] powers of satan loses its effect amen
[1:27:27] when this light rises every devil in
[1:27:29] hell loses its superstition and you
[1:27:32] begin to realize that's nothing but a
[1:27:34] devil that's nothing but a devil that's
[1:27:36] nothing but a devil cancer is nothing
[1:27:38] but a devil
[1:27:40] high blood pressure is nothing but a
[1:27:42] devil suicide spirit that's nothing but
[1:27:44] a devil and every day oh the light has
[1:27:48] shined in this day and it showed us who
[1:27:51] the devil is and where the devil belongs
[1:27:56] hallelujah the devil doesn't belong over
[1:27:59] your mind and over your head he belongs
[1:28:02] under your feet
[1:28:06] and the lie has drove him to the place
[1:28:09] he belongs
[1:28:14] hallelujah and it's no more words it's
[1:28:17] no more fear we know who he is and he's
[1:28:21] defeated we know who he is and he does
[1:28:24] not have power over me
[1:28:27] [Applause]
[1:28:34] that's the same thing it is when the
[1:28:35] word of god
[1:28:37] it rises
[1:28:38] all superstitions denominational
[1:28:41] fanaticisms and so it just moves away
[1:28:44] and it shows exactly what it is
[1:28:48] it may look like light but it ain't that
[1:28:50] light
[1:28:53] it's not even a true representation of
[1:28:55] that light
[1:28:56] the moon is a true representation of the
[1:28:59] sun
[1:29:00] but those lights out there is not a true
[1:29:01] representation of the sun
[1:29:05] the moon is reflecting that same light
[1:29:07] the sun gives off these lights out here
[1:29:09] they're man-made they're artificial and
[1:29:11] this is exactly what happens in
[1:29:12] artificial lights around the message
[1:29:14] they're not a true representation of the
[1:29:16] sun and when the sun rises they all go
[1:29:19] out
[1:29:24] hallelujah people can rise isms can rise
[1:29:27] communism passivism superstitions cults
[1:29:30] whatever it may be might rise but when
[1:29:32] the king of light
[1:29:36] the king light of the bible raises up
[1:29:39] all superstitions are gone
[1:29:43] hallelujah and you'll see
[1:29:44] right there is vindicated proves to be
[1:29:46] light we have no right to argue against
[1:29:48] that because it shuts out all other lies
[1:29:50] jesus said let every man's word be alive
[1:29:52] and mind be the truth that his word is
[1:29:55] superior over every man's word over
[1:29:58] everything the devil can say his word is
[1:30:01] light
[1:30:03] but we know that in the beginning it
[1:30:05] must have been foggy and dismal and dark
[1:30:08] the world was without form and void and
[1:30:10] god knew
[1:30:11] he had need of light
[1:30:14] and his seeds had already been planted
[1:30:15] there in the earth
[1:30:17] and he needed light
[1:30:18] to bring forth that seed
[1:30:21] because he knew that light had a drawing
[1:30:23] power
[1:30:24] but the seed was already there and he
[1:30:26] said just like it is in each age god is
[1:30:28] foretold and placed in each age seeds
[1:30:32] and there has to be the manifestation of
[1:30:34] light to bring forth the seed see the
[1:30:37] light does two things it dispels the
[1:30:39] darkness it shows who the darkness truly
[1:30:42] is
[1:30:43] but it also brings forth the sea
[1:30:47] amen it has to make it live for that age
[1:30:52] and he talks about the lights and their
[1:30:53] strength they couldn't be so strong in
[1:30:56] certain times a certain place because we
[1:30:57] know the seven church ages is the wheat
[1:30:59] plant
[1:31:00] amen it's a tender plant growing up and
[1:31:02] it comes all the way to a seed again it
[1:31:04] takes certain phases of the sun to
[1:31:06] operate in certain phases of the of the
[1:31:08] plant because if you put the harvest sun
[1:31:10] and the time of planting you'll burn it
[1:31:12] all up
[1:31:15] or in the time of growth you'll burn it
[1:31:17] all up
[1:31:18] god knows how to work his light
[1:31:22] god's word comes in seasons in the right
[1:31:24] season the law and grace amen the truth
[1:31:27] of the word it comes in the right times
[1:31:29] in the right ages in the right moments
[1:31:32] by the word of god the sun shines the
[1:31:34] day because every sun that we're
[1:31:35] enjoying is god's word may manifest this
[1:31:38] very sunlight that we see seen today is
[1:31:40] nothing but god's word that said let
[1:31:42] there be light
[1:31:44] what if it said let there be light and
[1:31:46] there was no light
[1:31:47] then it wasn't god who spoke it
[1:31:50] but when god says let there be there
[1:31:53] will be
[1:31:55] and so we find out that the sun that
[1:31:57] we're now enjoying is the manifestation
[1:31:59] of god's word spoken genesis
[1:32:02] and it's still shining today
[1:32:04] i mean enjoy the sun today when a
[1:32:06] beautiful day
[1:32:07] go out to enjoy the warmth of the sun
[1:32:09] the rays just basking it's like oh this
[1:32:11] is glorious
[1:32:13] especially after coming after after days
[1:32:15] of gloominess and rain and washington
[1:32:17] weather
[1:32:21] get some sunshine it feels good
[1:32:24] feel like doing something
[1:32:27] bones ain't creaking no more
[1:32:30] muscles are limbering up
[1:32:33] why because of the sun
[1:32:35] the sun's shining
[1:32:37] and he said we realize that god's light
[1:32:38] of the day is his son
[1:32:40] the one is estuan the one we're speaking
[1:32:43] about is esso win in the beginning was
[1:32:45] the word and the word was with god and
[1:32:47] the word was god hebrews 13 8 he is the
[1:32:50] same yesterday today and forever it's
[1:32:52] the word of god always it was christ to
[1:32:55] noah it was christ and moses it was
[1:32:57] christ and david it was christ all the
[1:32:59] way down to the bible the spirit of
[1:33:01] christ working and making manifest and
[1:33:04] bringing light for their time
[1:33:07] so it is in the seven church ages all
[1:33:09] the way down irenaeus martin luther all
[1:33:11] those the all those down wesley the
[1:33:14] pentecostal moments and all all the way
[1:33:16] down to our time is the spirit of christ
[1:33:21] the light of god's word
[1:33:23] but notice we're in harvest time
[1:33:26] so in harvest time the light is shining
[1:33:29] greater
[1:33:30] than it ever shown before
[1:33:34] it's back to where and his strength
[1:33:35] again
[1:33:36] it's not less
[1:33:38] it's greater
[1:33:40] and the light is shining
[1:33:43] and the light shines no life can come
[1:33:45] outside of light light produces it
[1:33:48] natural or spiritual there must be light
[1:33:51] to produce life
[1:33:53] the holy light can come by the word of
[1:33:55] god and god's word is the light when
[1:33:56] it's made manifest it's just not it's
[1:33:59] the seeds laying there it's bringing
[1:34:00] forth nothing can live natural or
[1:34:02] spiritual without light
[1:34:04] but then when that light rises it'll
[1:34:06] always dispel darkness
[1:34:10] read a couple of scriptures we bring
[1:34:12] this down isaiah 35 and verse 4
[1:34:15] says sayer to say to them
[1:34:18] that are of a fearful heart
[1:34:22] be strong
[1:34:23] fear not
[1:34:25] behold your god will come with vengeance
[1:34:28] even god with a recompense he
[1:34:31] will come and save you
[1:34:38] then the eyes of the blind shall be
[1:34:40] opened
[1:34:42] and the ears of the death shall be
[1:34:44] unstopped
[1:34:45] then shall the lame man leap as a harp
[1:34:47] and the tongue of the dumb seeing for in
[1:34:49] the wilderness shall waters break out
[1:34:52] and streams in the desert and the
[1:34:54] parched ground shall become a pool in
[1:34:56] the thirsty land springs of water and
[1:34:58] the habitation of dragons where each lay
[1:35:00] shall be grasped with reeds and rushes a
[1:35:03] highway shall be there
[1:35:05] away and it shall be called the way of
[1:35:07] holiness the unclean shall not pass over
[1:35:10] for it shall be for those the wayfarer
[1:35:13] man though fool shall not wear it now
[1:35:16] air therein no line shall be there nor
[1:35:19] any ravenous beast shall go upon their
[1:35:21] own and it shall not be found there
[1:35:24] but the redeemed shall walk there
[1:35:29] did you hear that the redeemed shall
[1:35:32] walk there the ransom of the lord shall
[1:35:35] return and come design with songs and
[1:35:38] everlasting joy upon their heads
[1:35:43] hallelujah amen the devil try to place
[1:35:45] his thoughts upon your head but you're
[1:35:47] to have the joy of the lord and the
[1:35:50] songs of zion and they shall obtain joy
[1:35:53] and gladness and sorrow and sighing
[1:35:56] shall flee away
[1:35:59] this is the breaking of the dawn of the
[1:36:01] light that will never go out
[1:36:04] but it will break forth into eternal day
[1:36:09] second corinthians 4 6 says for god
[1:36:12] who commanded the light to shine out of
[1:36:14] darkness
[1:36:15] has shined in our hearts
[1:36:18] how many can say he shined in my heart
[1:36:21] to give light of the knowledge of the
[1:36:23] glory of god
[1:36:24] in the face of jesus christ but we have
[1:36:27] this treasure in earthly vessels
[1:36:29] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:36:31] of god and not of us we're troubled on
[1:36:34] every side
[1:36:35] yet not distressed
[1:36:37] we are perplexed but not in despair
[1:36:41] persecuted but not forsaken
[1:36:44] cast down

[1:36:50] dying of the lord jesus that the life
[1:36:52] the light
[1:36:54] the life also of jesus might be made
[1:36:57] manifest in our body
[1:37:00] perplexed
[1:37:01] but not in despair
[1:37:04] troubled on every side
