thank you today as we bow before that throne that it's a throne of grace where we find mercy and help in our time of need that it is not a throne of judgment because you took our judgment you paid the price of redemption for us and we love you for that today Lord but what would we do without what you did for us at the cross when you paid for our sins and we became you became our sins so we could become your righteousness Lord we thank you for that wonderful gift the gift of eternal life today we ask your blessings upon us now as we assemble together in your name and as our church family gathers in their homes little groups here and there Lord listening to the message today then around the world as those in India South Africa different other places have told us they would be meeting with us today over in Europe different other places around the world Canada all over the United States that are listening right now as we're streaming this live may Lord they feel your presence in their midst may they realize that you have not forgotten your promises that your promise is always true and right and father's you will not leave us here in the times of judgment that are better coming up on the world but you said we would escape the things that are coming Lord may you countless worthy we're no we're not worthy of our own but may we be accounted we're and I pray God there be healing healing virtues and I just rained down as the word is preached Lord may have just healed the fears and the worries may you heal the sick Oh God and cleanse those that are in sin may they come and find you as their Lord and Savior and as we look into your word today we pray that we can take consolation and comfort from it give us strength Lord for the journeys ahead for only Lord you can be our helper in this time we give ourselves to you and ask your blessings upon us Lord but those that are seen today you bless them and those that are unseen the many Lord may you bless them in a mighty way o God we ask it in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you man thank you thank you for the coming out today and providing the music forests in the worship I pray that those that have joined us today in the service have been blessed by the singing and the worship amen I know I have been blessed and we're just happy for each one of you that have come to be with us today and those that are listening him from around the world and I say that is literally around the world as many are tuned in today and some have contacted me before that are listening in from India from South Africa different other places around the globe so god bless you and god be with you a man that we want to send greetings to all our loved ones and friends everywhere that are listening in we're going to look back in the scripture this morning to the Book of Daniel chapter 12 I really feel drawn to this passage of Scripture today once more I want to read it again Daniel chapter 12 and verse 1 and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time or at that and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as and stars forever and ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased then I would look into the book of Revelation chapter 12 also this is this is a parallel to the book of daniel booko Daniel was the book of Revelation to the Jewish people and of course to us as the in the Gentile dispensation where God has called in a people for his namesake the book of Revelation it's very pertinent to us in this hour Daniel revelation 12 verse 7 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and then for another scripture reading we'll read from 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 18 and this is where we're going to draw our text from this morning while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal a man may God bless you you can be seated ask God's blessings upon his word today and made you be blessed in his presence as we welcome you in his name today is a very special day and we have brother Joe Adams and his family here today we heard sister Jessica sing but their two youngest children are going to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus today and as I told you as this began to be very conscience of the little children and their fears and their worries and I think of course you know when we follow the Lord with all our hearts and and follow him and as the scripture tells us to do in water baptism he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned the Bible says so we're glad that they're going to obey the Lord in water baptism today and and so we're just looking forward to that when brother Joe will baptize them at the end of the service but today we're going to be speaking on the battle in the unseen realms we know we're looking at the news everywhere and where there is a there is a virus that is going to the land and it's caused a lot of fear a lot of worry a lot of fretting a lot of concern there is upheaval in our governments in our stock markets in our monetary system in our communities so everywhere that we look there's fear everywhere their governments that are trying to act to contain this and so we're looking at the news about this virus and I just want to call what it is when Jesus had rest sickness and diseases he addressed them as demons so these are supernatural devils going to the land Satan has found an opportunity to wreak havoc here in this end time and of course it hasn't caught God by surprise God knows exactly about what is going on and he is conscience of it at this moment and he is at work on our behalf I believe that with all of my heart but of course as he spirits are going to the land they are they are fallen angels they are angels but their fallen angels their angels of death and Jesus called him six sickness devils and of course when they come into a land into a community into world it brings a time of trouble but there is a great Prince which standeth in the time of conflict for the children of thy people so you see the this is not the only demon in the land but but I want you to look away from the bad news to the good news of revelation 10 where he said and I saw another mighty angel and so we're going to be talking about the battle that is now going on in the heavenly realms as we look from the scene into the unseen in both the Book of Daniel and the book of Revelation Michael is shown that as a messenger of war and he fights through the darkness against the Prince of Persia to bring a message to Daniel it was a time where prophecy was being fulfilled the 70 years of captivity down in Babylon had been um come come to an end and Daniel was praying and concerning you know when was it time to go home and I think that is part of our prayer today as we are considering this you know when is it time to go home we have been looking far throughout the thousands of years now for Jesus to come back and certainly he will come and he will come when every name in the book of life has been manifested on earth because he knows exactly which ones of us must be here in that name dipped in blood and then the rapture will take place but in the book of Revelation it shows um Michael prevailing against Lucifer and his angels in the book of Daniel it shows him standing up and he fights here at Daniel chapter 12 gives us fascinating account of Gabriel and Archangel of God who has been hindered for twenty-one days because of the Prince of Persia and then Michael comes to assist Gabriel and he got through to Daniel to reveal to him his day his hour and to give him the word of his restoration and the restored of Israel back to their homeland last Sunday I ended with these scriptures and again I would like to bring them to your attention as part of the foundation of this part of the service because I'm convinced that this battle that we are in that is affecting the world today is because of things that are happening in the unseen round of course we see what is it can be seen in the scene right but we want to look away from that and and try to get a glimpse of what is happening in the unseen realm and the Bible said concerning angels in Hebrews chapter 1:14 are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who inherit salvation so all true angels are ministering spirits again Matthew 18 10 said see that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you the angels in heaven continually see the face of my father who is in heaven and then some 34 and 7 the angel of the lord encamps about around those who fear him and he delivers them and then sums 9111 for he will give his angels charge concerning you to guard you in all your ways these are wonderful scriptures in Exodus 23 and 20 see I'm sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way to bring you to the place which I have prepared so you see I want you to think about the end the angels of God that in camp around about those that fear him and that believe him and and I want to remind you that there is an angel that accompanies this endtime message in this last day now I'm gonna spend some time today I'll be talking about an angelic visitation that happened in 1946 that started the great divine healing movement and out of their coma came all Robertson and Jack Coe and different ones that caught the inspiration because the angel of the Lord came to a prophet of God William Branham and I just want to say there's no message that has been vindicated by an angel like this message you know Jack Cole had blind faith our he would many times take people's of glasses and with an anvil and a hammer and beat them together and him pray for them and expect healing and take credit braces off of a child and and command the devil to leave yeah blind faith or Roberts to do that told his audience to imagine Jesus as a man standing right here and and while that I am praying for you that Jesus is laying his hands upon you and and you know again that was wonderful and many people believed that were healed but but this but this man William Branham had a visible presence of an angel many actually saw the angel or the light that surrounded his presence and those who who didn't were like me when I was just a young boy and I said in his meaning in life Tabernacle in Shreveport Louisiana I didn't see the angel now I neither did I see the light but I saw it as you see the wind and I explained it this way is when you look outside maybe you even feel the wind but you see the trees blowing are you here sometimes the whistle of the land as it comes through the cracks the crevices and makes its noise or whatever moving through the trees and and and so again I didn't see the angel but I saw his effects and you couldn't tell me all the wind isn't blowing oh no I see all the trees moving in the grass move and I hear the sound thereof and and again you couldn't convince me the angel of God wasn't there because it discerned the thoughts the intents of the heart told people who they were what her name was where they came from what their diseases was well you know about how many times they had been to the doctor visit incredible things and I want you to know it was never wrong and it wasn't an 80% prophesy and 20% miss it was 100 percent every time never missed now you know I would like just to share with you just a moment as a reminder about this visitation where that William Branham met the angel of God of course he had heard his voice since a child but it was at the age of 37 years of age when after being told over and over about the clergy and fellow ministers that God didn't heal no more for the days of miracles was passed and as his gift of visions were just the devil that he made an attempt to one day to ask God to just deliver him because of all what the clergymen and the preachers and religious men we call calling it the devil and so he went to an old cabin in the woods telling God I want nothing to do with these visions I want nothing to do with with these experiences that I'm having but they're about midnight when he was having a showdown with God on May the 7th 1946 the pillar of fire came into the cabin word that he was praying there out of out of a light stepped a man six foot tall 200 pounds an olive complexion with hair to his shoulders and and in his word I would just like to share with you his words today as he recounts the story he says now in the world of visions this man was not a vision he walked up to me I heard his feet as he walked he walked up to me and spoke and I was shaking like this and he said do not fear and when he said that that was the same voice I've heard since I was a baby the same man but now he was in a man that I've seen him a cloud and a pillar I heard him in a whirlwind in the bush talking to me but I'd never seen him as a man and here he was as a man you said I'm sent from the presence of Almighty God to tell you that your peculiar life and birth was for you to go to the world and pray for the sick people said your ministry will scatter all over the world and then this will bring the gospel and the power which will bring the second coming of Christ what you don't think of this I am mad because I want to remind you again the words of this angel has never failed and this was to bring the gospel and the power which will bring the second coming of Christ what a promise that is as we look at a very dark in time when the looming clouds of tribulation are getting closer and closer and drawing near and we we hear the lightning and we can even feel some of the breeze that has been and the winds of change that are beginning to happen all around us and in sicknesses that have been have been bred up and came and and moved in the heads not an opportunity in pre-tribulation plagues being poured out upon the world it's comforting to know that he made a promise he will not leave us in this in time but he'll rapture of people out before the great plagues come upon the earth I was reading in in a book that that made up all of this counts by it's called a supernatural by on owen jorgeson and he paraphrase it like this as he gave this same account of what the angel said you will give be given to science first you will take a person's right hand in your left hand and you'll be able to detect the presence of any germ cause disease by vibrations that will appear in your left hand then you must pray for the person if your hand returns to normal you can pronounce the person healed if it doesn't just ask a blessing and walk away under the anointing from God do not try to take your own thoughts but it'll give you be giving you what to say but he said he asked but what if they still don't believe me he saw the second sign is going to be greater than the first if you'll stay humble and sincere it will come to pass that you will be able to tell by vision the very secrets of their hearts then the people will have to believe you now listen this will initiate the gospel in power that will bring on the second coming of Christ notice this says initiation this will start it'll begin people to believing Amanda and this is what we need in this hour more than ever we need people with faith with people to believe a man that you know where we're coming into a time and a day and in the moment it may not be that the pastor can come in and lay hands on you you may be an isolated ward or and impossible for somebody even loved ones and close friends to even get to you we don't know the conditions that will be but I want you to know God's Word never fails a man in Jesus is always present and in the days of Jesus it didn't take a physical laying on her hands though he did that many times for gyruss did you said come and lay hands on my daughter but for the Gentile the Centurion said I recognize you as a man of authority and just as I say to to this one you know go and he goes and does it man and those that are under me you go do this and they do it he said so I recognized demons and evil spirits are under your authority you don't have to come to my house you just speak the word and my servant will live hey man so you see we're we're in that cycle of time right now today how long we'll be there I don't know but I guarantee you one thing we're in a moment in a time where faith has not got to be something just talked about it's got to be practice the angel said never forget and this is something I want to remind you of today never forget that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever as the scripture has declared it will not be you who accompanies any of this it will be the Lord Jesus Christ remember jesus promises followers he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater than these shall he do because I go to my father yet a little war while the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and that that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you so these are the words of the angel and then he he finishes up by saying I'll be with you and I want you to know it's not just a man that he was with it's his word that he is with and if he's with his word and you're a believer in that word he's with that word today remember and as we think about this angel said I'll be with you and with him he was the sick were healed the lame walked diseases were discerned blind eyes was open I just listened to a couple of the the discernment lines that you can listen to on on the message hub and and then click on audio and it'll list them out where someone is has made a whole collection of the many discernment lines about eight eight tapes of it or or sermons of it and and there you know on there you can hear people who who will speak up and saying I can have here I on another I can see yes I can see you I see your nose or them lights and all these things that are happening right there in the prayer lines let me tell you it happened but that's not a passage God we serve a present tense God and it should be of no doubt to us today that the same angel of God who is there to anoint and bring healing if still here in the church today because Jesus has to be the same yesterday today and forever a man and brother branham was speaker that pillar of fire that would often he would see that light and then it would hang over a person and show a vision and he says to my opinion it's the same angel of God that followed the children of Israel from Egypt under Palestine you know as a scholar yourself that was the angel of the covenant none other than the Lord Jesus Christ of course it was him in pre free um incarnate form but Merritt nevertheless you know there are things that are going on in the unseen realm there is a babble of all battles that has begun John G Lake he was an early Pentecostal father he was called a prophet to sow that he was an apostle rather to South Africa he he prophesied these words he said I can see as my spirit discerns of future and reaches out to touch the heart of mankind and to desire of God that there is coming from heaven a new manifestation of the Holy Spirit and power and that new manifestation will be in sweetness in love in tenderness and in the power of the Spirit beyond anything your heart or mind ever saw the lightning of God will flash through men's souls and the sons of God will meet the sons of darkness and prevail I believe we're living in that day in that time that johnsy lake was foretelling not brother Branham would say something very similar to that he said I believe we're on the borderline he said I was wondering about my meetings and things how I had to cancel them out he said I truly believe before the church can have the rapture it's gotta have rapture and faith we came even out faith for divine healing let alone rapture in faith we've got our faith and a change and quick in this body and be taken away and I believe there's a church on its Road tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning and the church is coming out not a psychologist not some of this put on or make belief but a real true genuine anointing Holy Ghost called out Church and man now again he would he would mention this and he would say now this may choke you to death but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods how many ever knew that how many know Jesus said so well that's John 10 you know that the Bible did not your laws say that you are gods and you have you call them gods which God said - they were God's because they were given a full domain over the Dominion of the world and he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his God ship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over but brother we're waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top and he's just using that as an example like a pyramid coming starting out a wide and coming up to the top there and they're waiting for the fullness of the time when it gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out hallelujah and we'll take every power that Satan has got away from him hey man my that oughta produced something in our hearts today amen to have a consolation God's not gonna leave us in this hour alone and powerless and weak and unable to conquer a man now we we know brother branham show time after time that when something climatic is going on in the earth it's a sign that something is happening in the heavens so we look around and we can see something very climatic something we have never seen before quite in this manner right amen but it's a sign that there's something that is happening in heaven you're seeing things that are happening in the scene Ram we want to understand there's things that are happening in the unseen Ram so we got to just turn our camera upward to what we can see what he's doing I like to share this little quotation from him he said he said what thinking of Christ and then he got up to the edge with a three Hubert children we're about to jump over into the fiery furnace and they're about the darkest hour they had ever seen it coming up to this fiery furnace and just about the time they got ready to stop here step in let's turn our cameras this morning and look up to the heaven yonder and break out of this dimension and look up younger when things look so dreary here there's always something going on in another world hey man that's right and I want to assure you today there is something that is happening in the unseen realms now this is what daniel said at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people there should be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation to that Timon and at that time that people shall be delivered every one that be found written in the book and then revelation did one and I saw another mighty angel and I want you to know we are here in the final Exodus natural Israel has made her Exodus she has been brought out of the nations into her promised land and we should have been gathered out of the isms and ideas and ideologies of denomination and brought back to the promised land of the Bible of the word of God amens I believe we are in the final Exodus the Royal seed of Abraham is about to make her Exodus to go from earth to glory and I believe that God has prepared us for this moment in this time for this Exodus and then Exodus 23 in verse 20 I want to remind you in that Exodus Dillards an angel a man Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever there's got to be an angel in this Exodus Exodus 23 20 be hold I send an angel before thee to keep thee end the way and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared God has prepared Israel the natural people the natural seed of Abraham Al and they have been gathered back to them a man and we have to say it's a phenomena it's a miracle oh yeah there has been scary times dark times trouble sometimes but they have prevailed they are nation today they have been gathered out of the nations back to their homeland but I want you to know there is a royal seed of Abraham and a man that corresponds with the natural seed of Abraham and I want you to know God is doing the same thing in the spiritual realm he has taken a people for his name's sake he has gathered them together he is moving them back to the homeland of the Bible or the Word of God where there is Bible times and Bible days Bible experiences and Bible signs and Bible wonders a Bible moving of the Holy Ghost hallelujah so he said I said I'm sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared for you I want you to know the angel of God it's been sent to guard us along the way to make sure we reach our homeland to make sure we get established in this word so that we can receive our Messiah and then the coming of the Lord Jesus the second time and as you see this angel was more than just a messenger but it was a whole nature the essence of divinity was in him if you see him he was there in Exodus 3 he was there in a pillar of fire in a burning bush and the bush did not burn but it was not a natural fire it was a spirits of fire a pillar of fire a glow of light a man the same one that Paul saw on the road to Damascus struck him down blinded his eyes knocked him off his high horse and he laid out in the street and said I have Jesus a man so again again they eat it was more than just a messenger it was God in messenger form understand this the same God moving now in a pillar of fire it would be that same God would be shown to thee to the Saints in the upper room and they would be filled with the Holy Ghost tongues of fire coming down upon them suing their the very visible sign of the pillar of fire then it accelerated itself and now came upon 120 and then three thousand souls are afterwards now Exodus chapter 33 verse 12 Moses said to the people say they'll say us bring up this people and thou has not let me know whom that will send with me yet that was said I know thee my name and thou hast found grace in my sight so Moses said to the Lord Lord you you've been telling me to lead this people but you have not let me know who you're gonna send with me you said I know you by name and you found favor or grace and remember grace is favor that is revealed and making known of his way a man so in verse 13 he says not pray thee if I have found grace show me now that way that I may know thee because when we know the way we know him because he used the way a man now again we're we're going to see these children here in those few minutes be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because there's only one name given under heaven whereby men might be saved it is the way there is only one way to God and that is through Jesus Christ through his intercessory work and mine only one way to him all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved the Bible said so yeah so again he says if you pleased with me treats me your ways so that I may know you and continue divine favor with you and remember that this nation is your people and man this was Moses saying the God you know God remember this we're your people and mine when we're facing things at this moment I don't think it's wrong to stand like Moses and say God remember your promises God remember where your people remember you said I'll never leave your forsaken remember you said I'll be with you and even in the end of the world I'll be there I'm gonna remember your promises remember you said you'd be the same yesterday today and forever remember you said you'd be their ever-present water from the rock remember Lord you'll be our needs supplier remember Lord you gave the promises we didn't make the promise you made the promise but you for we found grace we found favor in your sight and that you would call us your people my presence verse 14 usually he lets him know who's gonna go my presence shall go with thee my presence I want you to know in this moment who it is that's with us then never fail you may not be in the end the church house this morning maybe you're gathered in your home in a and I hope you're doing it reverently then with your Bibles open you know forgetting about the phone calls and the busyness and what else is going on and social media and just focus for a few moments here upon who it is it says that we'll go with you my presence shall be with thee and I will give you rest hallelujah rest is this peace I'll give you that peace man his personal presence was watching over the word hey man remember whenever a word is released when it is spoken God watches over that word and he sends a spirit after it to perform it he said my words will not return unto me void but it will accomplish what I've sent it to do now so there again the angel of God also called the angel of the Lord the angel of his presence the angel of Jehovah he stands out in distinct eminence preeminence rather in the Old Testament you know there was definitely a theophany mediator unique and distinct here it was we can see him and remember there's only one mediator between God and man and that's Jesus Christ but in the Old Testament notice the angel was either interceding on their behalf working on their behalf fighting on their behalf moving on their behalf man there was why there was definitely at the atomic mediator unique and distinct he introduced himself as deity he was called he was he called from heaven on two different occasions once when he stopped Abraham from sacrificing Isaac remember it was God mediating the age of the Lord calls him and said don't don't slain a man and then again when he promised him countless descendants it was there the angel of the Lord mediating working on the behalf he was a spokesman of the three men who came to announce Abraham the impending doom of sodom and gomorrah and to foretell the coming of the promised son it was the angel of the Lord that Abraham detained and his supplication for the city and nephew lot new you can remember Lord if there's fifty if there is twenty if there is ten he kept us going right on down on down imploring pleading a mile for the lost that's a sign of a real safer home and see the mayhem they're concerned about those who are lost and so you see it was again the angel of the Lord then that that that Abraham detained in his supplication and began to speak to and call upon and he entertained him there under the tree at Mamre in Genesis chapter 18 it was the angel of the Lord that accompanied Eliezer on his mission to get a wife for Isaac oh my you know when you think about it wasn't just happenstance if we could have looked in the unseen realm no doubt the angel Lord began to urge Rebekah to get down to to the the wealth and man to meet Elysa I mean she had to be there a man that something was moving in the unseen round and and there Eliezer was praying to none see invisible God hallelujah a man but was making himself known by the way he moved a man he would appear them to Jacob in a foreign land and identified himself that's the Karla Bethel he instructed him to go back home later wrestling with him in the night Jacob said I have met God face to face every individual that's ever met Jesus and wrestle it out until your walk was different to your top was different till your attitude was different you met God face to face and your life was changed hey man it was changed because you met God face to face there was Tamar when the light of Judah had all been extinguished and you remember the stories too deep for me to go into at this moment God was watching over his word because he'd said I love judo would come a deceptor that would rule over Israel and when the light of Judah was almost extinguished because there were no children given and Tamar was held away it was God intervening are you with me it was angel of the Lord who appeared to Moses in a burning bush and identified himself as the God of your father the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob he identified himself as the I am that I am nothing I was but they ever-present God not I will be but I am that's who he is today the I am the never-fail in presence of Jesus Christ that is with us everywhere that we go now the same angel later guided and guarded Israelites that we just read about in their exodus from Egypt it was the angel of the Lord who talked with Moses in the wilderness and there was delivered the Ten Commandments to him on Mount sana it was the age the Lord that brought Balaam on his Road to curse Israel and refused to let him bring curses on God's people hear me what I'm saying in the middle in the middle of a crisis the angel Lord stops Balaam from bringing a curse on God's people I want to remind you again he's the same yesterday today and forever hey man he's able to hold all the curses he's able to keep us in safety he's able to keep us in garnish in our way it's him does that I'll never leave you or forsake you [Music] engage the Lord identified himself to Joshua as a commander of the army of the Lord think about it he looked and he saw a man with his hand with his sword John said are you witless are you far as Joshua said are you against us he exalts his sword he said no I'm not for you neither am I get see you're not only I'm not on your side here on my side I'm the one leading in this battle and I want you to understand friend God isn't the one on your side you're on God's side and because you're on God's side you're on the winning side a man so there as it would be said I'm there in the and William Branham would say this he would say now the book of Exodus in the there he said I like Indian up on this thirteenth chapter the pillar of fire pillar fire that led the children of Israel through the day in the night in the daytime it looked like a cloud nighttime it looked like a pillar of fire leading Egypt and that was none other than the Angel of the Covenant none other than Jesus Christ Himself before he was made flesh and come in the womb of Mary it was Christ Moses followed Christ if you remember that in the Bible hey man you know Moses followed Christ he drank from the rock which was Christ is that right hey man the scripture said that he was in the wilderness with Moses and that's who he was the angel of his covenant God being the messenger of his own covenant not that God's actually an angel but that he is the messenger of his own cabinet you see in the early period of the judges when Israel was forsaken God the angel of the Lord appeared at Bochum chapter 2 of Judges says the angel of the Lord appeared at Bochum coming from Gilgal and announce to the people of israel i brought you out of Egypt into this land that I promised to your ancestors and I said I would never break my covenant with you notice the angel said I brought you out and I promise you and I said I will never break my covenant the age the Lord appeared to get him and commissioned him for military leadership he appears to Manoah and his wife and promised them a son Samson who would deliver his people he appears to David on the threshing floor of Ornan when he stopped the destroying angel and afterwards commanded the Prophet GAD to order David to build an altar on that rock and this would be the very place that David would build the temple think of that think of that a plant is going through there are thousands that are dying this is where David writes and sums 93 as he see people died ten thousand on you on one side and the thousand on the other but it will not come nigh thee neither will any plague come nigh thy dwelling what was it he was he was there looking there as a plague was in the life and he was claiming the promises and he looks up and he sees an angel standing with his sword drawn is that how long will you kill and destroy a man and there God commanded him to build an altar there in the threshing floor in the word that week was me and threshing amen at harvest time to build their a temple unto the Lord think about a place of worship and an altar of sacrifice to atone for the evils that was been Doni in the lands that it calls the plagues oh my in Ezekiel chapter 1 and 10 through 13 or chapter 9 the ancient Lord receives a report the angels who patrol the earth and then ask God have mercy on Jerusalem and then wouldn't mark those who sighed and cried for the abominations that are done in the city oh I wondered today how many souls are crying sign for the sins that are being done in the world whether with the millions upon millions of our own children being put to death right in the womb of senators and of Representatives saying they wouldn't even support or revive or help a child who was born because of abortion people who become so hard-hearted mothers who will destroy their own life that is in their womb a god-given life and who is it the sign and cried real abomination that's done in this world today but it's not just that oh that's just the tip of the iceberg when there's crime when there's evil when there's every kind of evil device that is out there there's got to be a people that are silent crying that sin makes them sick that says Oh God you know God don't let us perish with the wicked and the Bible said you put a mark of all of those who sigh and cry for the abominations that are being done Amanda Marc is a sign of the Holy Ghost view he will mark knows with the Holy Spirit who saw angra just who is this angel of the Lord he is the pre-incarnate logos the word in the beginning was the word he is the distinct personal self manifestation of God are the Incarnate logos the Word made flesh that's who Jesus was this reference in judges shows clearly that the angel of God are the angel Lord is God in his self manifestation John declared he was creator for said by him all things are created and then that low Garson became flesh and dwelt among us it's interesting to note that this angel did not appear on earth while Jesus was in flesh just b-boy was born there was angels announced his birth right amen but there was no angelic visitation during the time of Jesus ministry upon the earth a man well while then this is amazing to think why because here now glob was now manifested not in an angelic form leading the children of Israel as an angel of his covenant the messenger of his own covenant but he's there now incarnate in Jesus Christ amen it's also amazing how often the appearance of the angel of the Lord marked a turning point in history he was it happened there at the founding of the chosen race with Abraham it was there with the deliverance of that same race from Egypt days Lord was there established in the Covenant at Mount Sinai he was there leading the people into a promised land he was there he was there laying the foundation for Solomon's Temple by ordinate altar to be built on onus on threshing floor he was there supporting Elijah in his battle against Jezebel and her pagans and then he was there protecting the elect in the Babylonian captivity I'd like to read Isaiah 63 and 8 starting with the end of that so he was their Savior and in aldair affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them it is love in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old oh that gives me so much comfort in his affliction their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old what wonderful promises lay in the scripture what wonderful promises as we look in the end time and know that we're seeing things in the scene but there's got to be something happened in the unseen I just ask you today who is this that is taking us through Satan's Eden who is this that has made the promise that I'll never leave you or forsake you again in the end the film of the 20th century prophet William Branham says very well brother cop let's go back to the beginning I was born in Eastern Kentucky in a little log cabin in Burkesville Kentucky the morning my birth I'm told of my parents that there was a light coming to the room and hung over me my people were not a religious people they didn't go to any church of course this caused quite a stir among them it followed me all the days of my life recently they took a picture of it in the scientific world is shown here you're probably familiar with this picture and it was proven by science is the only supernatural being that was ever scientifically photographed in it to my opinion it is the same angel of God that followed the children of Israel from Egypt and the Palestine you know as a scholar yourself that was the angel of the Covenant none other than our Lord Jesus Christ and I just want to say to you don't you think for a moment that angels are not all around us the Bible said they in camp around about us you remember there and we'll look at it my Magic's and 52 when when Peter he went know when he drew his sword and he cut out the the ear of Malchus I'm there you know there's a lot of people say you know he just had a bad aim he really stripped for his head right on down to rip him wide open but he just hit his ear and cut it off and Jesus picked the ear up and put it back on and heals him right and he turns to Peter and he says put up again thy sword into its place for they that take the sword shall perish with the soul thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he suppressant ly give me more than twelve legions of angels now sometimes ago I figured this up a legion is you know it some translation said twelve armies of angels but a legion of angels at that time were were worth six thousand in a legion so we you know if he could call for twelve of them that would be approximately 72,000 angels that he could call in a moment and Jesus said if I call don't you know heaven will send 12 legions over seventy thousand angels to my rescue all I have to do is call only hey man no you say brother Tim but that was Jesus well let's look at Hebrews 12:22 but you are come to Mount Zion you come to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable you can't even cáñamo company of angels this is where you come oh the Sun is right there's angels all around us to keep us from harm aim and angels all around us there's no need to be alarmed a man did them kind and pretentious oh my are you with me hey man so again you you again oh there were angels on your side with Jesus there it is hour of temptation and he met Lucifer face servation Matthew 4:4 truth board for the angels afterwards came and strengthened him my life word guess simile the angels came and strengthened him for the cross I want you to know no matter what you're going through the angels are there to strengthen you you are not alone you may feel very alone you and your family in your home this morning we might feel very alone and we're looking at a church that normally is packed out ma'am but just trying to respect the government orders that didn't tell us to shut down but just trying to do our part in the community to help quell this virus that is going on it's not because we don't believe God won't protect us we believe you will and mine we're we believe that he'll be with us even in us to the end of the world but here you may feel all along but I want you to know you're not alone I mean you may give the situation your posture can't even get to you but I want you to know you're not alone you will never be alone he said I'll never leave you or forsake you you're not forsaken you're not forgotten never forgive the angel said he's the same yesterday today and forever let me think of this - power of 72,000 angels you know in the book of Kings the second Kings actually in a moment when it was a calamity it was a horrible time the Assyrians had come down and camped against them they were mocking making fun of them twisting the word if you read it they'll even take the commandments the Lord and so I'm back to the Israel and try to twist it in and make them confused and and disbelieve their king the city is set up oh you know horrible things are happening and and the Bible said and in second Kings 1935 and I'll just read this translation that night the angel Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty five thousand in the Assyrian camp and when the people got up the next morning they were all dead bodies man one angel took care of a hundred eighty-five thousand a man what then could seventy-two thousand angels do a man that covers the population of the earth twice over a man why because the AIDS Lord will not killed a hundred and eighty-five thousand let me tell you he's still God a man is still the same yesterday today and forever the angel still has as much authority and power is ahead then amounts of a single angel had that kind of power what would be the combined strength of twelve legions of angels and Daniel chapter 12 chooses Michael stands up to deliver God's people revelation 12 Sue's us Michael when he stands up its wall he's not just standing up to take a break from City oh no he's standing up for the children of his people come on to deliver them a man in Revelation 12 shows us Michael when he stands up it's war he's declaring war I want you to know little Church Michael has stood up the angel of his presence has stood up Michael means who is like Jehovah a man has stood up a man what's he doing he's declaring war man against Satan and his hosts there's a battle now that is going on you are seeing things and people dying and you see the effects of the evil spirit I want you to know you're going to see the effects of the Holy Spirit as he goes out bring it delivered and keeping his people and support us during the sign there is something that happens in the spirit realm that causes Satan to fall I want you to know when that angel came to William Branham in 1946 even the coming of that angel was a declaration of war against the Fallen Angels of Darkness but to win the war people have to believe you see it's the time that we believe like we've never believed we have faith like we never have faith a man it's a time where to win the war you're going to have to believe now it may seem strange to you but God can neither heal you our Savior against your will so I'll now predestination by the gentleman foreknowledge yeah God knows by this foreknowledge and yes he's predestinated but he's got to have your wheel to be surrendered to his will amen William Branham would say this crisis here and I declare to you he's raised from the dead he loves you he wants your soul he wants to heal you he wants to make you happy he wants to bring you up to glory then he can only do it as you permit him to do it he can't do it against your will so you must invite him in if you look in Revelation chapter 3 in the last church age which were young Leia to see him and he says behold I stand at the door and I knock and if any man will open the door I will come in notice he doesn't push the door open the requirement is for the man to open the door I will come in I will sup with you I'll bring out fellowship with you and you with me right so you see there's a part we've got to do in this war the angels are fighting but you got to be believing this is when your faith must remain strong now there was a man one time that made a portrait of Christ he was a famous painter and so you know in order to holla hang in the Hall of Fame you had to go to the hall of critics kind of like us but we can hang in the Hall of Fame we have to go through the Hall of critics but anyway this the critics were looking at it and they said you know it's a wonderful picture Christ standing on the outside of the door but you made an obvious to me that's very obvious mistake here there's no latch on the door and the artist said no I did it on purpose I put no latch on the outside because in this case the latch is on the inside the one that's on the inside has to open it he cannot open it from the outside he cannot save you against your will he cannot heal you against your will he cannot send a revival against her will you've got to be willing and opened the door and invite him in again way brother madam would say and he cares you care could God save you against your will certainly not he can't heal you against her will you've got to believe it he was told by the angel if you can get the people to believe see the angel can do all kinds of signs through a sign gift it can discern your heart he can tell you where you're from they can do all those things only are done to elevate faith to cause you to believe but if you don't believe there's no healing there'll be no miracle that follows you must believe so the angels that you must get the people to believe and then nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer beneath the people believe so the battle is in the unseen round and it's a level over you Satan trying to not you with unbelief and if you be honest you have been you have been he's tried to anoint you in these last few weeks without fear confusion questions come on a man ever everything else of you you've questioned everything oh we missed the rapture are we in the tribulation how could you miss sir rapture you are the rapture hey man you're the ones he's coming for his people for his namesake hey man the very reason he came to Calvary was to get a bride without spot or wrinkle he's not gonna go back it'd be handed he's gonna accomplish what he said he would do he'll have that church so Satan shunned anoint you with unbelief fear which is unbelief you see there's no fear and love perfect love casts out fear when you get back and you get your focus back on Jesus and in perfect love with him all fear is gone you know he's gonna do what he said right hey man so again Satan of Thailand on shoes with unbelief you'll try to anoint your faith and yet God is sending you the word gifts signs testimonies I mean you know it's just like I recounted last night as you as you know we've got a miracle that has happened in our family where that the angel of God when brother Ron Spencer was here angel of God met him and said that that tonight is Esther's night and now Esther after night in 16 years of being barren has got as has a child in her womb the man I stood it's hello and I prayed and I prayed for the barren woman I prayed for the barren the barren women I prayed for the barren souls a man I prayed for the product us to come back home a man I prayed their it's a load there were Hannah prayed for child I prayed for a church that has been buried for 2,000 years to bring both sides of life and to be a rapture in this age God gives us a sign little girl been waiting cried 3 in 16 years now as a child in ruin in that sister Elena we told her testimony healed there again I didn't see the angel that day but he was here I saw when she got up out of her seat and circled this building twice they're running and shouting with her victory dance there and there she was dying with him with a cancer in the lungs Hodgkin's disease and there was in a in a very dying condition seen up in the mezzanine isolated from everybody else and goes running through this building and around and around and then see the scan the very next day no cancer now nearly two years later scam after scam no cancer I didn't see the angel but I know he was here a mine angels of mercy angels of grace I'm out in my like I said you know what their life suddenly when when it come into my home and my wife with a brain bleed and laying there and brain bleed this big around significant getting back there took away your peripheral vision and there was blind and I'm just saying to you today he's still the same God moment we can get our hearts set on believing a man open up your heart to him this morning believing that man he's still for you they're a little time eighteen months old it never crawled could not walk could not could not take a step step and I haven't been seen in a vision that he would walk and there but sat there at the end of the bed that morning and when my wife turned from from sorrow to praise and begin to praise the Lord it calls the angel of God to draw near and sweep across her bed and the vision come back I didn't see the angel but I know he's there because that little boy that was sitting there there at the end of the bed got up for his first time and his first steps wasn't a walk or a step or two his first steps was running all around my house while his mother walked around in amazement saying praise Jesus praise Jesus praise Jesus and I was there and I knew the angel of God had passed to our house hey man I want you to know you pass through your house you come your way today amen this God is a God who answers a call of his children the first battle that was ever fought was not fought on earth it was filed in the heavens Michael and his angels fought against Luther Lucifer they were kicked out of heaven then that great army of the devil and his em fell upon the earth and God knew there was going to be a battle he knew there wasn't going to be a battle when you're seeing a war in the unseen it happens on earth Amen I want you to get the glimpse right now if you're seeing you know again you know you you don't see the wind where it come from you don't know where it's going well you see the effects hey man we see these spirits coming through the land we see their facts but we also see them another effect because there's never time man that Satan takes after God's children then he don't have Jesus Christ on his hands when they were kicked out of heaven this great army of the devil all his hymns fell to the earth God knew there was gonna be a battle he knew from the beginning there was going to be a battle and this first battle ever fought began in heaven Michael and his angels would fight against Lucifer and his angel first started in the first battle in heaven sin didn't originate on the earth it originated in heaven right hey man Lucifer said I will and exalted his own will over God's will Isaiah 14:12 so sin began in heaven but soon it came down to earth and now it starts being fought in human battles so there I fell on humans and the battle from angels became human battles and Satan came down to destroy God's created creator what God created for himself now Satan comes to destroy and now the battle is raging and it's beginning us and remember the first place in attack Eve was in the mind yay hath God said now Eve is sheltered behind the word if she'll just stay with what God says everything will be okay the devil can't do anything when you stay behind God's word but the moment she begins to reason and that's where it wars it wars in your mind your soul may be sealed and Holy Ghost filled but Satan still can come in the realm of your mind to try to ward off the blessings that come with salvation the blessings of healing the blessings of peace now you're saying and the same people you're supposed to have the blessings of healing the blessings of beef right but you see there's gets to be war and where does the war come it comes in your mind and Satan begins right there in the unseen realm of your mind the virus haven't even struck you but and then some virus going on in your mind and there's questions and there's doubts and there's fear and who's funding there Satan is they're not coming from that inner peace of your soul they're coming from this outside realm where you see chase smile feeling here the since knowledge begins to tell in your mind and reason and affection and emotions you know again you know we're starting to now hear people we know or know of relatives of people we know or know odd that is dying or dead hey man it was once one sister they're up in New York 60 years old grandchild brought her them the virus and she was put in the hospital on the ventilator is he gone to glory another sister Landon Ohio right now as we speak don't know her personally but I know family members in different places and she laying there 95% on a ventilator and we hear that and the war starts we hear of wars and rumors of wars we hear people losing the battle to this people are sick fear starts coming in worries me my family what are we going to do what we you know it affects this economy they'll stock my market goes to crashing what is it Wars coming in your mind remember you be kept in perfect peace if your mind is stayed on him but we're hearing all of these other things and Satan whispering in my ear come on now I want you to know God cannot bless over sin and sin is unbelief unbelief is sin and even as a Christian even as a Christian you may not smoke drink commit adultery month you might get married only one time I've been a virgin when you married you you might have a perfect track record all of all that or maybe your past is forgiven and from there you've been walking perfectly before the Lord but you're still dealing with doubts Satan whispered in your ear and with us you're listening to your reason and a fear comes and you begin to doubt you know what you need to do repent repent that's God to forgive you why would you ever doubt your Savior come on why would you listen to this costumer in your ear you're listening to everything else everybody's touched in the next event on Facebook and the next worries in the next miss and the next step people are worried but you know you've got to have cooperative faith Jesus when he would pray many times he would put the people out they didn't believe we're unbelief is you can't do anything you can't he preached the gospel you can't even talk work where there's unbelief hardly it takes faith and then and then you know then um you know then when you when you stop believing and unite together it is calls to one another and you see the Holy Spirit's this isn't that one another it gives you faith to start believing for yourself Amen but the same thing happens in the demonic realm you see fear is contagious that man is catching because an evil spirit comes and calls out and trying to get you to disbelieve you see human battles they battles from angels became human battles the Bible said in Matthew 13 58 and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief so God operates where faith is I've done said he will not operate against your will the man with the demon-possessed son did Mark 92022 that that the disciples couldn't cast out and Jesus said it was because of your unbelief and he would say to Jesus but if thou can do anything have compassion on us and help us and Jesus said if thou kemp's believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straightway the father of the child cried out and with two severed ears lord I believe help thou mine unbelief amen Romans 10 and verse 9 says it's out confess with that mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thine heart that God has raised from the dead thou shalt be saved notice confession with the mouth and believing in the heart it takes it takes believing for salvation for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness with the mouth confession is made to salvation for the scripture said whosoever believeth on me shall not be ashamed so again if we believe on him we won't be ashamed he's gonna do what he said Amen even your salvation is based on believing a man he that cometh to God must believe that he is not that he was not that he will be but that he is and that he will reward those that diligently seek Him you can't even get a prayer answered unless you believe you know I was struck so often as I listen to these discernment lines how often there was a battle between the demons of unbelief to try to get people to believe remember that was his commission I'm giving you signs to get people to believe and if you can get them to believe nothing will stand before you so it all hinges on us believing God could send signs and wonders but if you don't believe it Jesus could appear in the city who healed the sick cast out devils did oh and couldn't have me mighty miracles there because any believe him so the whole effort ever service was a battle it was a war against unbelief and exercise and first the word being preached then signs and wonders being done to get people to believe and once they believed they could be healed because they had to open the locks for healing and you've got if you're listening to me today in your ear you're wondering am i saved it has traveled some time you know it's time that you believe believe like you never before believe that his word is the truth believe he will not lie then he will not go back on his word he said I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost and receive it open the door to it it's that simple it don't have to be are you if you something that happened to you during this time will you will be okay or maybe say I hope so you can now sell you can be sure so I guess that it was service and and every service we've ever had here it's always the same getting people to believe you preached the word why you use examples in the scriptures why you here we use examples and testimonies of healing why to get people to believe you know if they start believing the devil's got to leave the war is going to be won not Jesus won the war at Calvary but Satan comes in as a squatter he has no legal right to you as a believer Amen you're not here you're not his property he has no right to your body mm because it's been redeemed by God I mean you've got a down payment of your honor of your new body come on and then you got there you've got salvation within your soul is the deposit of eternal life where you're going to receive the full potential of it when the month the moment that you're changed a man but it but at the same time there's a still just war and Satan comes and he comes to the reasoning in your mind to stop making you doubt he can't take away your salvation but he can keep you from enjoying the benefits of your salvation healing deliverance peace joy he can cloud you with depression and yet you're redeemed individual filled with the Holy Ghost and wind up taking your life it drives you so insane think about that but I'm the preaching of the word is to cast out devils then you know then God had signs to that to also elevate faith he gives testimonies of healings deliverance examples in the Bible oh how much how much freaks have we have we get gendered from one example in the Bible David and Goliath how many times millions of times has been preached across pulpits given faith to the believer that you can defeat the giant in your life hey man it was what was it do it getting people to believe now once faith was there then what Calvary had afford it was available to him that was available in all time but he can't be forced on you against your will so you gotta start believing to accept that just like you except your salvation and you were saying you gotta accept healing the same way by his stripes I'm healed he was wounded for my transgression therefore I'm saved by what he did at Calvary he took the stripes for me I'm healed listen and I'm time to try to hurry but we only have one service today so you know we're here for to really lay in some things and there's thousands of people listening right movement this moment and you're you're gathering strength right now from the things I'm speaking to you listen to this little quotation he said your ever'one Christians I presume then if you're Christians you have a right a legal right for everything Christ died for it is your possession you on it it's yours the only thing you can do is do like Abraham after he had endured a fight he obtained the promise Satan don't just let you take it easy you've got to have faith you've got to believe it you've got to n do it those who said that land belongs to you yet it's fenced up with Philistines and amirite skåne eyes all of them everything else it's yours I give it to you now go take it till you see Jesus paid for it he gave it to you but you've got to go take it the land was given the Israel but they had to go kick out the Canaanites the parasites and the jebusites and and even sometimes the websites hey ma'am so divine healing is to every one of you and it belongs to you now can you go take it go take it this morning go on it's yours nothing can harm you you're in Christ why they were going in that battle and women without losing soldier come on take in Jericho Bastogne by the words of God release from their mouths as the trumpets blew and they shouted walls came down I'm out because of their self something happened in the unseen round and that's the only way to give the unseen RAM to work for you is for you to start believing it an act an opponent in the unseen realm brother Branham would often see faith and I'm going from these discernment lines he will often see faith as a milky white cloud and he would see demons as dark streaks and shadows now back in the seventies of course I was a boy preacher I was started preaching when I was fifteen and about the mid seventies I went up and down northern Arkansas and I was preaching a revival um it was in my early 20s might have been even later toward the 7 in the end of 70s but reaching to a revival for a man by the name of Henry Daris Henry Daris told me of an experience that he had where he went to a tent meeting in Jonesboro Arkansas William Branham was there preaching he said I couldn't get a seat under the tent so he said I squeezed my way in and I found me a place by tent pole he said I had a cancer in my throat and he said it was choking me to death and I was in a dying condition and I went there I didn't have a hope of a doctor in the poor Arkansas heals who has had not even any money for doctors and there he said I went to that meeting that day and I was leaning against the temple and he said there was a woman came in the prayer line and he said it's William Branham begins speak to her in Jonesboro Arkansas we need to pray for that place right now they just had a Tornai to go through it him and pray for all of those someone even people have lost their homes and things businesses destroyed the grace of God they'd been all full like the normal are there were been many people killed but nevertheless and jumps Jonesboro there was a tent meeting going on William Branham was preaching there this was about 1953 I think said I was leaning against the temple a woman came up on in the prayer line they would approach from the roof from his right come this way he began to talk to her tell her what your name is and your trouble your trouble is you have cancer is in your throat and he stops for a minute he said wait a minute he said I see something everybody be reverent just a moment I see a dark streak it's running it's running back it's screaming out help me help me it's a demon and his scream and help me now listen all of this is going the unseen you can see it you couldn't hear it but here this prophet was looking into the unseen realm and here he hears now a battle that is going on the angel of God is present anointing the woman with faith to believe she's starting to believe because she knows if God knows her name and what her trouble is that he also can heal her sickness so her faith is starting to elevate and when it does a demon begins to scream out that is in her over here to this man Henry Daris leaning against the temple and as he does as he does now this is Henry's testimony he says as he does William Branham looks he said it's that man there lead him by the temple you've got cancer in the throat also don't you sir he said the demon this woman is ran out to the demon in you trying to get her to disbelieve trying to reinforce doubt a man but he's been exposed and now you're believing and because you're believing that you're both delivered what was it a war that was going on and demons congregating to try to press and make one disbelieve because in order to be healed they had to behave let me just read this one said a gift of God is here he said of Germans of life and you have a human life you can contact see this is William Branham didn't look at diseases as if they were you know tubercular this and that he did it directly as Jesus did in the Bible thou evil spirit and so as he did he would call out discern and he says he would call him evil spy he didn't call him so much by the doctors name he said the doctor calls him this but it's a devil and this spirit here and that spirit there that's giving you that tubercular knows that the hour is near and it's pushing back and when that spirit goes out to meet it's just like a warfare so he says now Satan lost the battle at Calvary but he's come and squatted on you he's there he's got a place in your body and with this cancer he is trying to get you to disbelieve and fear has come with it and now the angel of God is present and the word is telling you that by a structure healed and the angel is here discern in your heart and you're beginning to believe and there's a warfare going on and it depends on which one you've been again he said the spirit goes out to meet he says now again I'm just a man I'm your brother and there's an anointing coming here which you're aware of now I want you to watch friends what's the patient's face when they come near once is it coming like that what's the expression on their face when they come and we're feeling the presence of that angel and if the angel of the Lord will come near then the angel of sickness which would be on you he will go to pulling see the angel of the Lord is near now there's both powers and they're fighting one against the other now depends on our faith now that sickness whatever you have if that's pulling on you is going to try to put everything in your mind to keep you from believing that this is the truth and this which is coming now and me speaking to you is trying to get you to believe that it's the truth and now here's the offer if you will believe it then this here the Holy Spirit will pronounce the blessing and Satan has to need so you see it's a warfare now this is what I'm suing you here in Daniel 12 there's a war going on and ever service there's a war going on in the in the place where you're at this morning and your service at home there's a war going on and Satan there is trying to put doubts and fear and then sentient he in your life when you are you have been instructed to be certain of God to be sure he's the same yesterday today and forever or that his word is the truth but Satan is coming in trying to bring his fear his doubt his confusion again in the healing line he said he said his presence is here you believe he's here this is a cancerous condition he says and that man sitting there now he's got someone on the prone in the prayer line on the platform it's a cancerous condition and the man sitting there and he points to somebody in the audience has the same thing and them demons are screaming one to another for pity for mercy they're calling and so is the angels of God calling and the battle is here now your faith will determine which way it goes and he says he looks out there to the man in the audience said you believe that I come off your face sir you believe it gotta let you yet well you do sitting there with the mother there you believe it now it's screaming for mercy both of them there's a pool there's a pool and he turns back to the woman on the platform and said you had an operation for your I'll see a hospital there's a surgery going on it was in the stomach intestines there it form did not or something's growing back in the place like that that's a true circuit because it was a man there - he said now hear you brother now God be merciful to you you believe me as a servant you're both right now at the verge of being healed I can't determine that I can only speak what I see and that's the truth so not even the preacher can determine it for you it takes you the individual to believe it but you see who determines that not God he's already healed - I heal all diseases a man and he holds that offer - you can't trying to get you to take it to accept it hey man now who determines that not the devil the Lori said not God a man he and neither does the devil he doesn't determine either he's lost he's a bluff a man he was defeated at Calvary he's coming out like he like he's all big and bold and mad and angry and all of that but he's a bluff I mean he has no right to be there he's bluffing his way to be in your body because Jesus said but my structure heal but he wants to bluff and say oh no I've got a right to be there and he'll try to point at something for some failure some dis some that something else you some reasons what the doctor said somebody else died and then something real all of these other things of what's going on all around and he brings that in your mind to war it's you to get you to disbelieve but if you can just start believing that's the same way with the sinner you know a sinner in the condition so what I made so many mistakes and I've lied and I'm stole and I'm committed adultery and I've been a bad person I've been a drunkard I've been a drug addict I've been on this a bit of that and I all this condemnation tries to come on you you know there's no hope for you you can't make it you get but if you listen to the gospel if you listen to the word if you listen to the voice of the Lord if you feel the angels present and start believing it's possible it's possible I can be saved I can't be delivered I can't be healed I can't I can't I can't I can then something that happened for you but he's gotta change you from doubted you believe it say I look the Holy Ghost brother Jim but then oh well I tried and I didn't get it huh did this not didn't get it this happened and I this week I've done this forget out of that don't listen to the reason strapped in even it is for me it's for my children it's for those that are far off as far as many as the Lord our God shall call a man whosoever will come the water of life freely who determines it you do you do who determines the peace if you heart like you do you choose what you gonna believe in this hour you choose to believe he's got it all in control you choose you choose you start siding with the angel come on the Angels don't confirm the message you start believing again he says to lady this time on the platform you believe with all your heart we serve God reverently with all your heart the rest of your life if God will reveal to me your trouble then he said Satan is losing his battle polls are coming from everywhere faith is moving and the buildings becoming milky to me that's why he would see faith rising it would be it would be like a milky white cloud and he would see it his faith and then he would see demons is darkness and he says this lady here standing here has suffered with the tumour that's right lady and many more out there suffering every person's suffering with the tumors stand on your feet right now every person with a tumor stand your feet everywhere Almighty God Satan knows that his time has come he's defeated tonight through the cross of Christ I adjure thee that demon you're exposed come out of these people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ depart from them amen go home all of you be made well there again he would talk to another one he says brother come in with you there's a comes of dark spirit a black spirit which is death it's a devil it's a cancer there's a lady sitting there answer on the pelvic bone and he speaks somebody out in the audience your name is Miss ROI Zeke's something like that isn't that right wave your hands that I heard it called now the devil is pulling between you it's all for both of you now it's like between you now go and believe with all your heart praise be to God Satan lost that battle hallelujah the Devils calls to one another they're screaming and calling for help that's the reason I called you for your prayer pray for me help me keep praying you see it's a power it's a battle it's the devil wrong fighting against right and right against wrong with me and skeptic believe with all your heart be expecting you to be next stuff Holy Spirit's healing all to the building be expected to be next man know what the outcome of that is I don't know I know the thing left him there was a dark streak between him and this room was calling for mercy help help help keep him from believing keep him from believing and a look to see where it was and I've seen the woman I've seen another woman call me and I didn't know what it was and then that the ducts free streak all left them and it turned light the Holy Spirit was moving between them what was it something was happening in the unseen realm oh man this is the point I'm trying to get you to see there is an unseen world and it's greater than anything you can see a man and this is why you would say in this world this building there are evil spirits and law and Christians are anointed and the angels of God and kept about them trying to energize them with faith I want to say to you believe is let him energize you don't resist the energy that comes from the work get in the word let it energize you oh man he said energize them with faith that's what you want energized with faith and here I'm standing here just field and myself and the holy spirits and move in it and that's what you call heavenly places in Christ Jesus remember Satan's always a skeptic and the sons of God he always does someone with a skeptic idea when they do that and he's just trying to interfere but Christians always overcome hallelujah hey man my there there's so much of this that you could bring but he says in this one the audience into our audience looks like just a great big milky ball to me out there now it's your faith oh don't it this is what you got to do you're laying there sick in your bed act on that faith amen rise up claim the promise for yourself say I believe it Lord Amen through your doubts away and take what God said in his word step proclaimer that I'm healed I'm saved I'm delivered a man he made a promise and this is one thing I know about this God he never lies he always tells the truth if you can believe it he says spend your feet and accept Jesus as your hero now regardless of what's wrong with you must be the name of the Lord let's raise our hands and give Him praise he says every one of us O God we think the Lord Satan has lost the battle Jesus Christ is the winner and we have won the victory hallelujah that's why ever church service should be a veggie not a defeat a victory but a defeat for the devil and a victory for us because why it stirs our hearts to believin he said if one comes up platform with just an ounce of faith you'll hear another one out there screaming for help but man it's not what happened with Jesus man he started somebody start believing and the devil starts screaming out of the of that tormented one a man screaming for mercy Jesus made him scream for mercy a man they they screamed that was even willing to go into pigs amen anything just don't cast a snout or darkness a man he says this cancer that this man is facing here there's another out there with cancer that woman would only believe what I'm telling believe Jesus Christ she'll be healed as sure as the world didn't to throw that woman's faith off that other demon screams down in her and I catch between them and say there you are both of you believe and exposes the devil and when he does the devil knows he's exposed and he's got to go hey man my you see it's really important what we listen to in this hour a mountain is it now there's a dark streak coming from a woman to another what is is a devil he knows his time has come you're extremely nervous aren't you lady yes hysterically nervous I've seen you're trying to do something you're nervous mental nervous Satan told you you were going to lose your mind if you didn't get over it but he lied to you little lady back there she's bothered with nervousness too and he said this demon knows if that woman were halfway believe that Jesus Christ the Son of God and I miss profit that we'll have to leave her and that demon was calling to that one for help to help accumulate unbelief but he's lost the battle he sure has fear faith is gathering hallelujah and then when he would see faith gathered and and people beginning to believe all over he would declare Satan he lost the battle a man and people would get up of a wheelchairs and an out of cops and everything else said be healed and walk out of the building delivered Wow because the battle was won you say it was one of Calvary yes it was jesus paid it all healing Jesus can heal you he's already done it but until you it cannot be afforded to you until you start believing a man he's saved every one of us about what he did at Calvary but it'll never do you good until you stop believing it hey ma'am this is important really important because we're talking about what's in the unseen right now he says they did there's so many much of this but I want you to understand the Holy Ghost if you have received his Holy Spirit it has given you the ability to believe I'm telling you you can believe you without it you can't truly and fully believe it's a work of the Holy Ghost so you know we've had great meetings revival meetings we had a man that was went through the country was a great man Billy Graham and many took off after him they've done a great work but he this was a message of repentance if get out what we need is a is a receive a message of the infilling remember coz when the evil spirit goes out of the mind they're walking dry places but then he goes out and he finds the house empty and garnished and swept he comes back in with seven other Devils in the last part of the man is worse than the first what is it he made a good start he started repenting but he didn't get filled up again it's important to be filled with the Spirit of God because once your field you're sealed to the day of redemption a man and so this will unite you under one hand which is Jesus Christ and then he will be the leader of your battle and you are beyond your own anymore trying to fight through this nonsense is going on in the world but you'll have a leader in your battle it'll be the Holy Spirit leading and guiding the way for you now I want you to know what he did it was like there's a legend some say it's true some says it has no validity but nevertheless this was in many stories in history of a man by the name of Arnold von Winkler an Arnold von Winkler was a Swiss man and one day the opposing the enemy came in to the Switzerland into Switzerland and there they had they'd formed a thick wall with a mass of men and they were going through the country ravish and killing destroy nah Arnold von Winkler I guess that some say it's a legend some say it has some truth but it's sketchy if you look it up in the in the encyclopedia is sketchy but we're just going to use it for a story but Arnold he looked at his brethren he said rather he said you see all of those that big wall of that enemy come in and here we are we're just farmer and poor people and you got a sickle another's got a hoe and the others got a you know a piece of metal and if you have a sword and hardly nobody has this fear but said this day I've decided I'm gonna give my life for Switzerland so what are you gonna do Arnold he said well I kiss my wife and children goodbye this morning he said because I've got to make a way for Liberty he says I want you to come with me because I'm gonna make a hole through this this wall of men and he says I want you to follow behind me in the hole that I make and I want you to fight with everything you got and then they said that Arnold took off on a run toward that enemy and he ran with everything he had and those men with all the spears whenever they aimed at their Arnold and he took him to his business Muslim all the Spears and swords and hits and there and that confused and the Swiss the Swiss man come revetted behind him because they were so taken by his voluntary in this and his braveness and they come in there and they the enemy and broke through the hole and destroyed the army and had freedom for years and years in their country but let me tell you of another great hero not great hero he saw that we were walled off as human beings Satan had us garrisoned had a great wall of fear and death and doubt that one our Savior Jesus Christ looked at that wall and he said this day I'd give my life for my people make way for liberty now you take what you've got in fight with all you have and he went running toward the enemy and he took death into his bosom he took scamper into his bosom he took sickness into the bosom he took every kind of disease that there was and sickness and everything lies and fornication and adultery it is and the routed Satan's army man and all you've got to do is go forth and claim your victory this Lord amen because he is the one who paid the before the battle and he took the sphere and you are free this morning to accept your Liberty he made that Liberty now walk in that freedom in the name of Jesus Christ where you believe let's bow our heads together would you why you have your heads bowed while you're talking to the Lord just for a moment maybe I've talked about things that are really strange and different because a lot of people are talking about what they're seeing in the scene world and I'm talking about what's going on in the unseen but I'm asking you can you open that door this morning can we start getting your faith can we start getting you to believe sins no harder for God than anything else he specializes and things thought impossible you need Jesus once you just reach a hand out to him and say Lord I need you I'm going to start believing right now I want you Lord in my life speak to me Jesus speak to me you're sick in your body cancer isn't greater than sin he dealt with sin cancer is lesser than sin sin will take you to hell cancer can't take you to hell only your sin can do it but if you got cancer this morning you got sickness in your body and I said cancer maybe it's maybe you're infected with the virus and maybe that's now feared worse than cancer it's bad news you don't know what the outcome is but if I get you to start believing [Music] something will happen in that unseen round man and a change will begin within you if I get you to start believing right now your cancer will leave you i bind it in the name of Jesus I command it to golf Satan you're exposed I know they're under the sound of my voice right now there are those that are sick battling cancer this is not from the Lord this is some Satan he has no right to you fear comes with it he comes and whispers in your ear you hear all the bad news Satan trying to get you to disbelieve don't disbelieve start believing right now just say I take God at His Word and in my name he said the name of Jesus you shall cast out devils may not make cancer maybe some other situation maybe those headaches we had prayer over this morning kimberley he knows where you are you're not a child of the devil you belong to God don't let him whisper in your ear only hear it anymore right now refuse to hear it except that he's the healer all these other needs that are out there don't listen that devil don't believe him he's lying to you he's saying you can't get well when treatments had to stop because this sicknesses virus and I can't get well now oh yes you can it was never treatment it was ever wounded for your transgressions and bruised for your iniquities but except the blood treatment of Calvary and I want you to know it's greater than any chemical the doctor can give we thank God for medicine we don't refuse it but I'm just telling you Christ is a healer and the LORD thy God that healeth all that diseases right now in the name of Jesus just as Jesus spoke for the cinterion the servant never laid hands on it just with his words just went out in the unseen dimensions and touched us servant li and their dead or dying and healed just as he spoke to this ear Phoenician woman when he saw how great her faith was and was persistent to believe even when Jesus said it ain't right to give the children's bread that's divine healing to the dogs of Gentiles she said yes Lord but he the dogs get crumbs you see you see she was persistent you may feel unworthy all of that and the devil telling you all these things is not possible but right now it's for you if I can just get you to believe just one moment in his presence something will happen [Music] just believe all things are possible to them that believe they will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's Bible gyruss said come lay your hands on my daughter she'll get well the Centurion said just speak the word the seer venetian woman said lord I believe see great is your faith woman go your way he never laid hands on her he just spoke the word go and find your daughter the way you ask right now I can't get to you physically I can't touch you some of you are suffering in different situations there you're in South Africa you're you're in India you're wherever you're in Europe maybe you're at home here in the US maybe you're in Canada wherever you are as you listen to me right now I can't reach out and touch you but your faith can touch Jesus you reach out with your faith right now and say he's my high priest and I can touch him and he can feel my infirmities and by His stripes I claim his healing and deliverance if you're lost you need to Savior reach out to him right now Jesus touch Everhard touch every life Lord bring deliverance in the name of the Holy Child Jesus Lord we tried today to bring a word of faith to the people may they reach out to you and believe right now in Jesus name as we commit this to you amen just only believe just worship you wherever you are down your home there you're gathered in a little Church somewhere wherever you are work two or more gathered I'm there a man only believe Jesus Biscay Jesus you and all things are possible Jesus is he [Music] Jesus is he Jesus is here and all these are possible [Music] Jesus is he really Jill bring your little children down you can come Jessica if you want to a man we're gonna have prayer with them for they go down to the water all things are possible she-sus is he gee Jesus gee [Music] are possible Jesus is he give me Isaiah nine and six just for a moment scripture says that unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace this is a wonderful scripture that we look at this morning as we prepare for baptism baptism is really important part of our salvation we know the thief at the cross as far as we know he wasn't baptized but for us it can that have an opportunity we must obey the word and the Bible said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned [Music] we're just looking at this scripture is God revealed itself down to the ages he would be known as Jehovah he would be Jehovah Jireh the Lord provider Jehovah Rapha the Lord healer Jehovah Shalom the Lord is our peace he would be known in jehova shamma the Lord is present all these expressions of Jehovah but one day Jehovah coming to come flesh and in doing so there was a new expression to the name Jehovah and that was Jehovah Savior and that is what Jesus means it's the Greek form of Yeshua which means Jehovah the saviours were God came as Savior we look back here at Isaiah 9 and 6 it says unto us a child is born and us a son is given and his name shall be called these will be the titles that he will go by all of these he will fulfill he will be wonderful which means the miracle wonderful means the miracle he'll be the wonderful the miracle he would be born of a virgin the miracle he'd be awesome wonderful his name would be called wonderful we called counselor he's the one who will lead us guide us direct us he be called the mighty God this is God comes from the word el al in the Old Testament Hebrew mighty is gabor he would be the mighty God are the El Gabor which means he would be the warrior God Gabor is a mighty man a warrior and this is where God would come on taking on human battles he couldn't do it as spirit for him in the heavens so God came to the earth and he came in Jesus and his name would be called though Helga bore the mighty God he'd also be known as the everlasting father and the Prince of Peace these are not his names this is just what his name in tells his name would be called Jesus and the angel said and his name shall be called Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins [Music] now he told us Matthew would write it this way and this would be his account in Matthew 28:19 he would also tell us of titles of his name and the Bible says go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name singular we just read and Isaiah nine and six many names but his name shall be called this his name these are his titles father son Holy Ghost father he is a creator of the earth but then out of himself he speaks and brings a baby into a mother's womb and God stepped out into human flesh and that was called the Sun because it was birthed of the eternal spirit and the Holy Ghost is who he is just like the Joe your father you have these two children your son you have a mother and dad your name is and father your name isn't son you're also human but your name isn't human your name is Jill Adams he told us to go and baptize them in the name not name's not titles there are other titles his name of lily-of-the-valley bright morning star as we read counselor principies mighty god these are all titles of his deity but he has a name the name of the father is Jesus there is no salvation given in any other name than in the name of Jesus whatever we do in word or deed we do in the name of Jesus Acts chapter 2 verse 38 I'd like you to look at that let's just read this the Holy Ghost it fell and people were pricked in their heart wanted to know what must we do to be saved and he told him repent that's what you got to do believe on the Lord repent of your sins and then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the racing of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost do you know there was never one time in all of history and all the Bible that anybody was ever baptized in any other way than in the name of Jesus Christ we're gonna baptize you today in the name of the Lord Jesus because today you are taking on his name you see all the family in heaven Earth has to be named after when you're born again when you were born your mom and dad gave you a name and when you're born again you receive a his name we receive of his life so we're gonna pray with you today as you go down to the baptismal service command you believed on the Lord Jesus and you've asked Jesus to come in your heart you want to obey Him today take him on his name and you're gonna love the Lord Jesus from now on you serve him with all your heart okay we're gonna pray together father in the name of Jesus as these parents bring their children north today and they immerse them in the name of the Lord Jesus and they take on your name may Lord you do what we cannot do like John the Baptist said he was the Baptizer
