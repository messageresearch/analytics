[52:25] Worship to the Lord and the wonderful
[52:28] music that amen the glorifying to the
[52:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a
[52:34] privilege to serve him today amen it's a
[52:37] privilege to be gathered together with
[52:39] believers amen and to see you here with
[52:42] us today is a special honor for you to
[52:45] be with us and um I wanted just to
[52:49] um before that I went into my message
[52:52] this morning I wanted just to speak to
[52:55] you just uh a little bit about
[52:57] um the the continued missionary and
[53:01] Outreach that we are doing here at
[53:03] evening like Tabernacle
[53:05] as you know during the building of this
[53:08] church
[53:08] we um were able to send those to go into
[53:13] Japan God provided that and and made a
[53:18] way for every step of the way and today
[53:21] there is a a church a gathering of
[53:23] Believers in Japan if you'll just show
[53:25] that picture of the Believers Gathering
[53:27] there and these are the Believers that
[53:30] are gathering there now
[53:32] um that um as the brothers went forth
[53:35] and began to bring the word and begin to
[53:38] labor then
[53:40] um this little you know we we saw fruits
[53:43] to the laborer and now there's a nice
[53:46] little group of Believers I'm meeting
[53:49] there in Yokohama area of Japan and
[53:54] um they are growing they're adding to
[53:57] the the church daily as such
[54:01] and um so we just recently sponsored a
[54:06] meeting of brother Danny del mundo from
[54:09] the Philippines to for him and his wife
[54:12] to fly into
[54:14] um Japan from the Philippines and to
[54:17] spend their I think they spent about 10
[54:19] days to a couple of weeks there and they
[54:23] met in about three different places
[54:25] where that they were out reaching from
[54:28] Yokohama they had meetings here with the
[54:31] Believers here and then then branched
[54:34] out into different other places and
[54:38] while they were there
[54:39] um they baptized another believer in the
[54:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and this
[54:45] is a Japanese believer married to a
[54:47] Filipino wife but he is a Japanese
[54:51] person and he took on the name of the
[54:54] Lord Jesus Christ and we thanked the
[54:57] Lord for adding another soul to the
[55:00] kingdom of God
[55:01] amen
[55:03] and of course they have been baptizing
[55:05] regularly and and so on but this is in
[55:07] one of the outreaches there in the outer
[55:10] line areas of Japan it was quite a few
[55:12] different places that they went
[55:15] and um right now we are
[55:18] um we are I want to show the little
[55:20] picture of the little church building
[55:22] there that they have just rented a house
[55:26] because they
[55:28] um there's not really a church that they
[55:30] can buy or median or building like that
[55:34] so they actually rented a house in those
[55:36] two-story house and using the living
[55:38] room that is set up specifically for
[55:41] their meetings this was important and a
[55:44] great step for them as Believers because
[55:47] it provides them a regular meeting place
[55:51] or regular worship place where that it's
[55:54] set up and dedicated for that purpose
[55:56] while brother Danny del mundo was there
[55:58] he dedicated it unto the Lord and and so
[56:02] we are monthly helping to pay rent on
[56:06] this house and
[56:09] um that they can median so it's a it's
[56:12] an infant Church an infant work and it's
[56:15] a growing work and we of course have not
[56:18] been able to go back there because of
[56:20] covid I think you have to have three if
[56:24] not four vaccinations and so we have not
[56:28] met the requirements of all that they
[56:30] require because of covid rules and they
[56:34] just barely has opened up in fact we had
[56:36] to delay the meetings that were due in
[56:39] September over into October in order in
[56:43] order to or November rather so that
[56:46] um so that that brother Danny could go
[56:48] there because they had still had
[56:51] traveled restrictions into the nation of
[56:54] Japan this is now opening back up and
[56:58] Believers of course are are able to
[57:00] gather and Worship the Lord and rather
[57:04] than having to find a venue every every
[57:07] few weeks or every week you know and
[57:10] this week this this little room's
[57:12] available in this week is a small room
[57:15] this is a larger room you know back and
[57:18] forth now they have a permanent place
[57:20] that they have at least some for a year
[57:22] and so I just wanted you to know that we
[57:25] were helping to do this
[57:30] I left my paper in my room but I think
[57:33] we have a right at about 71 or two
[57:37] translations of sermons of brother
[57:40] branham's that we have sponsored this
[57:43] month I mean this year and this year
[57:45] that we've got like 71 or two that have
[57:49] been translated from English into the
[57:52] Japanese language these are put on the
[57:54] message hub
[57:55] you know sometimes people will criticize
[57:58] the use of the internet but you know um
[58:01] this is where the people from around the
[58:03] world that are japanese-speaking people
[58:05] can go to the message Hub actually you
[58:08] can go the message Hub and get French or
[58:11] English translation English French
[58:15] um all different kinds of languages
[58:17] Japanese now so so we got several
[58:20] hundred that we have been able to do
[58:23] this now that was at a cost of of um
[58:26] between sponsoring the meeting and and
[58:28] between
[58:29] um the translations we have spent um
[58:32] around fifteen thousand dollars last
[58:35] year just on on the um the missions for
[58:39] Japan and that's not to say of what we
[58:42] have done for other places
[58:45] um but you know while I'm talking about
[58:48] Japan I just want to just talk about the
[58:50] the spirit of God is moving there it's
[58:53] adding souls to the kingdom their
[58:55] healings that are taking place it was a
[58:58] Japanese sister with tumors in her lungs
[59:00] her dad died of the same condition it
[59:03] was a horrible condition and she was in
[59:06] a dying condition they laid hands on her
[59:08] and prayed far went back to the doctors
[59:10] all the tumors are gone
[59:12] so you know the signs followed the word
[59:15] and so there are healing Miracles and
[59:19] things of encouragement and I also
[59:22] wanted to say yesterday that I I sent a
[59:25] 1113 dollars for the two sermons of
[59:30] paradox and invisible Union to be
[59:34] translated into the Arabic language in
[59:38] Egypt so these will actually go and be
[59:41] able to help spread the gospel you know
[59:43] Paradox is a miracle and what you're
[59:46] actually seeing is a miracle take place
[59:49] and um as the gospel is going forth into
[59:52] all the world and so we did that
[59:55] yesterday
[59:57] um uh I also wanted to to mention that
[1:00:01] we pay monthly for the house rental of
[1:00:04] one of your favorite leading evangelists
[1:00:06] and I'll give you a hint he doesn't
[1:00:08] attend church here so it's not one of
[1:00:11] our brothers but you know we have an
[1:00:13] interest in others and other needs in
[1:00:15] other situations so we have been doing
[1:00:18] that on a monthly basis to provide help
[1:00:22] for uh and to help sponsor one of our
[1:00:25] evangelists on the field provide a
[1:00:27] provide that his rent is taken care of
[1:00:29] so that he doesn't have to worry about
[1:00:31] that he's got a he's got a roof over his
[1:00:34] head and of course um as you know we we
[1:00:38] support for ministers here in the church
[1:00:40] myself included and sending out two
[1:00:43] full-time evangelists as well and and uh
[1:00:46] so you know we are we're doing
[1:00:48] everything thing that we know to to
[1:00:51] reach the world with the Gospel of Jesus
[1:00:54] Christ and I want to just say I believe
[1:00:56] we've got the one of the best I'm just
[1:00:58] going to say one of the best Ministry
[1:01:00] teams in all the Earth amen that God has
[1:01:04] blessed us with here at evening light
[1:01:05] Tabernacle
[1:01:12] and I wanted to say also that you know
[1:01:16] um last month I was able to send ten
[1:01:18] thousand dollars to help the Believers
[1:01:20] in Newfoundland to purchase a church
[1:01:23] building that's a way up in the uh the
[1:01:27] the far northeast
[1:01:29] corner of North America in Newfoundland
[1:01:33] and they're they've been a a very
[1:01:36] dedicated group for many years under the
[1:01:39] pastor brother Gerald Lush they have a
[1:01:42] um a young Minister there a brother
[1:01:44] Jonathan curlette that is also now
[1:01:46] helping out and and the church is
[1:01:48] advancing they're moving they're adding
[1:01:50] Believers and the the church is growing
[1:01:53] and you know the the Catholic Church
[1:01:58] um actually in that area got into the
[1:02:02] whole diocese got into a big lawsuit
[1:02:04] because of the sex scenes of the priest
[1:02:09] and they lost a lot of their bill
[1:02:12] buildings and so they went they went and
[1:02:15] were were liquidated and to pay some of
[1:02:19] the some of the cost of their
[1:02:21] litigations and so on like that well it
[1:02:24] just so happens their losses are gained
[1:02:27] so one of those Catholic churches is now
[1:02:29] a message Church
[1:02:35] so God provides
[1:02:37] and so we were happy to help them out in
[1:02:40] this time we've also printed booklets
[1:02:42] and Outreach materials for Uganda as uh
[1:02:46] there is a mighty Revival that is
[1:02:48] sweeping that land and there are there
[1:02:51] are tremendous needs there we've helped
[1:02:54] you know
[1:02:55] um we've helped rebuild churches in the
[1:02:57] Philippines after the typhoons had
[1:03:01] destroyed them so you know I'm only
[1:03:03] saying this you know because God has
[1:03:06] blessed us in so many ways and provided
[1:03:10] for us and that I just wanted you to
[1:03:12] know when you give to missions we're
[1:03:14] trying to get this gospel out to the
[1:03:17] world because the gospel of this Kingdom
[1:03:19] shall be preached in all the world for a
[1:03:22] witness and to All Nations and then
[1:03:25] shall the End come
[1:03:26] amen so you know if you if you pray
[1:03:30] about it and you think about it and God
[1:03:31] puts an extra uh dime in your pocket
[1:03:34] that you could give just write it on an
[1:03:37] envelope for Missions or on your check
[1:03:39] memo for Missions and drop it an
[1:03:41] offering and then we pray about it and
[1:03:43] try to send it out where that it can be
[1:03:46] we uh we know that God's people will be
[1:03:48] blessed by it and helped and we have a
[1:03:51] responsibility to others you say why
[1:03:54] would we want to be interested in others
[1:03:57] well I'll tell you why because we can't
[1:04:00] go into Rapture without them
[1:04:02] as I've said you know I I got the Holy
[1:04:06] Ghost and you didn't get it that day
[1:04:08] perhaps you got the holy ghost on a day
[1:04:11] and God met you and somebody else didn't
[1:04:14] receive it on that same day but when the
[1:04:17] Rapture takes place is not something
[1:04:19] we're doing individually it's something
[1:04:21] we're doing collectively
[1:04:23] that means then I can't go until you're
[1:04:26] ready to go
[1:04:27] so that's why I have an interest in the
[1:04:30] world that's why we have an interest in
[1:04:32] others that's why that we want to see
[1:04:35] the body of Christ Prosper around the
[1:04:38] world Amen so you know
[1:04:41] um for those online I know some people
[1:04:44] will wonder well how can we help well
[1:04:47] I'll just tell you if you feel to help
[1:04:49] on that PayPal charges us about three or
[1:04:53] four percent if you want to donate some
[1:04:55] to them that's fine but an old-fashioned
[1:04:57] check wrote out it'll all get to
[1:04:59] missions so anyway some it's good
[1:05:03] sometimes to be just old-fashioned
[1:05:05] right amen it's good to be in the house
[1:05:08] of the Lord today I wanted to say as a
[1:05:11] pastor thank you for all your help and
[1:05:14] labors of love to help with the wedding
[1:05:16] yesterday and not just to help but your
[1:05:19] generosity and the contributions
[1:05:22] um in every way your attendance your
[1:05:24] part it meant a lot to us as a family
[1:05:27] and as a church body and and I know you
[1:05:32] know when the time comes we'll be there
[1:05:33] for your young person as we as we um you
[1:05:38] know I talked with brother Buzz Bosey
[1:05:40] from
[1:05:41] Uganda and and of course there you know
[1:05:44] they expect a dowry and and so uh you
[1:05:48] know and so it's a really hard for young
[1:05:50] people to get started so most of them
[1:05:52] don't get started until in their 30s you
[1:05:55] know in a marriage because they got a
[1:05:57] save for Dowry to to pay for the the dad
[1:06:00] for the daughter
[1:06:02] well I said you know so I said it's not
[1:06:04] like Uganda we don't require uh 10 cows
[1:06:08] and 20 goats and um you know a bunch of
[1:06:12] gifts to give to the parents I said we
[1:06:13] help our kids get started and so I he
[1:06:17] wrote me back and he said that's a good
[1:06:19] custom I wish we had it here
[1:06:21] so you know it's a different in
[1:06:23] different parts of the world but you
[1:06:26] know the thing about it is God has a
[1:06:28] people around the world that he's
[1:06:30] calling for his namesake and I want to
[1:06:33] say I'm thankful that God has raised up
[1:06:36] young people in this church as they
[1:06:39] stood there you could tell that kiss was
[1:06:41] not practiced
[1:06:44] right everybody get down left that one
[1:06:48] had never been practiced before so you
[1:06:51] know they stood in front of the the
[1:06:53] pastor and right in front of the pastor
[1:06:55] took their first kiss
[1:06:57] and uh that's the kind of young people
[1:06:59] we want to raise is people who have
[1:07:03] dedicated themselves to the Lord and
[1:07:05] kept themselves and um for the for the
[1:07:10] purpose of uh serving Jesus and the
[1:07:13] gospel of Christ so let's stand together
[1:07:15] as we turn to Genesis Chapter 18 and
[1:07:19] verse 9 I want just to look into the
[1:07:22] word of God today and just see again
[1:07:26] something some nugget from the scripture
[1:07:28] that we can get out Genesis 18 and verse
[1:07:31] 9.
[1:07:33] yeah
[1:07:34] and they said unto him
[1:07:36] where is Sarah thy wife and he said
[1:07:39] behold in the tent
[1:07:41] and he said I will certainly return unto
[1:07:44] thee according to the time of life
[1:07:46] I love those words they just resonate
[1:07:48] Within Me
[1:07:50] I will certainly this is an assurance
[1:07:53] will return unto thee according to the
[1:07:56] time of life and lo Sarah thy wife
[1:08:00] shall have a son
[1:08:02] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:08:04] which was behind him and Abraham and
[1:08:07] Sarah were old and well-stricken in age
[1:08:09] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[1:08:13] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[1:08:15] within herself saying after I'm old
[1:08:18] shall I have pleasure
[1:08:20] my Lord being old also
[1:08:24] may God bless his words you can't be
[1:08:26] seated
[1:08:29] as we look into the
[1:08:32] today
[1:08:33] I'm going to speak on when the promise
[1:08:35] is delayed
[1:08:38] and if you don't mind I would like to
[1:08:40] turn to First Peter chapter 3 and verse
[1:08:43] 18.
[1:08:44] for some further reading as we look to
[1:08:48] this time and and it says for Christ
[1:08:51] also had suffered once for sins that
[1:08:56] just for the unjust that he might bring
[1:08:58] us to God being put to death in the
[1:09:01] flesh but quickened by the Spirit by
[1:09:04] which he uh also he went and preached
[1:09:06] unto the spirits in prison which were
[1:09:09] sometimes uh which sometimes were
[1:09:12] disobedient when Once the long-suffering
[1:09:14] of God waited in the days of Noah while
[1:09:18] the art was a preparing wherein few and
[1:09:21] that is eight Souls were saved by water
[1:09:25] so I want you to notice from this
[1:09:27] scripture that he speaks of the long
[1:09:30] suffering of God wadeth
[1:09:33] so it goes to show us that when a
[1:09:35] promise is delayed that there is a
[1:09:37] purpose God has a purpose and a plan
[1:09:41] and there is something that he is doing
[1:09:43] that he's working all the time behind
[1:09:46] the scenes to bring the promise into
[1:09:49] fruition
[1:09:51] and though it may look like the promises
[1:09:54] forgotten really it's the long suffering
[1:09:57] of God
[1:09:58] that that will wait until you know given
[1:10:03] every opportunity moving every stone
[1:10:05] getting everything just right
[1:10:08] if you go to The Second Epistle of Peter
[1:10:11] chapter 3 and verse 1 he will say this
[1:10:14] Second Epistle Brethren I now write unto
[1:10:17] you in both which I stir up your pure
[1:10:19] Minds by the way of remembrance that you
[1:10:22] may be mindful of The Words which was
[1:10:24] spoken before by the holy prophets and
[1:10:27] the Commandments of us the Apostles of
[1:10:30] the Lord and savior
[1:10:32] knowing this first
[1:10:35] that there shall come in the last days
[1:10:37] scoffers
[1:10:39] walking after their own lust so we're
[1:10:43] going to see in this that there's
[1:10:45] there's got to be adversity in the time
[1:10:49] of the Fulfillment of problems
[1:10:51] so here again he would tell us that that
[1:10:56] first now first I want to establish
[1:10:59] you're going to have opposition
[1:11:02] there's going to be difficulties
[1:11:05] it's not it's not going to come easy and
[1:11:08] there's going to be disagreements
[1:11:10] there's going to be those that scoff at
[1:11:13] the promise
[1:11:14] yeah actually brother Brandon when he
[1:11:16] preaches the Rapture sermon he first
[1:11:18] deals and almost the first half of his
[1:11:21] sermon with scoffers arising
[1:11:24] that will scoff at the promise of God
[1:11:27] and and as he was saying that will say
[1:11:30] where is the promise of his coming
[1:11:34] for since the fathers have fell asleep
[1:11:36] all things continue as they were from
[1:11:39] the beginning of the creation so again
[1:11:42] we find that it's going to have a an air
[1:11:46] to it or seemingly that everything is
[1:11:49] just the same as has always been that
[1:11:52] there's really nothing happening there's
[1:11:55] really been no changes there's really
[1:11:58] nothing taking place
[1:12:00] that you know it's a just a time of
[1:12:02] silence and God isn't doing anything and
[1:12:05] God isn't moving
[1:12:08] and um you know that it seemed like that
[1:12:11] maybe God went on vacation or perhaps um
[1:12:13] he made a promise and went back in the
[1:12:16] heavens and he just forgot it all
[1:12:19] but I want you to know that he would
[1:12:22] tell you then that they are willingly
[1:12:25] ignorant so there are some facts that
[1:12:28] they're overlooking
[1:12:30] that there are things that they're not
[1:12:32] putting in the equation when they're
[1:12:35] scoffing because there are other things
[1:12:38] that would that if you looked at it this
[1:12:41] way that it would balance out the view
[1:12:43] that you're having
[1:12:44] so he said they're willingly ignorant of
[1:12:47] that the word of by the word of God the
[1:12:49] heavens were of old and the Earth
[1:12:51] standing out of the water and in the
[1:12:53] water whereby the world that then was
[1:12:56] being overflowed with water perished but
[1:12:59] the heavens and the Earth which are now
[1:13:01] by the same word are kept in store
[1:13:05] reserved unto fire against the day of
[1:13:08] judgment and Perdition of ungodly men so
[1:13:12] he said just as the world was brought
[1:13:15] forth by the word God the word holds
[1:13:18] actually the is kept in store reserved
[1:13:23] unto the fire against the day of
[1:13:26] judgment so God has actually reserved
[1:13:28] things or holds things back to be
[1:13:31] revealed or made known in a certain hour
[1:13:35] so he says then he said but beloved be
[1:13:38] not ignorant of this one thing that one
[1:13:40] day with the Lord is has a thousand
[1:13:42] years and a thousand years is one day so
[1:13:45] God isn't on your time
[1:13:49] and he doesn't count times like you
[1:13:51] count it
[1:13:52] and it really doesn't matter to God
[1:13:54] because he's Timeless he's eternal
[1:13:58] so the time that you have spent waiting
[1:14:00] on the promise it's it doesn't mean
[1:14:03] anything to God it's going to come to
[1:14:05] pass anyway
[1:14:07] and nothing's going to stop it because
[1:14:10] so next word said the Lord is not slack
[1:14:13] concerning his promise
[1:14:15] you see he's always working in in when
[1:14:20] you don't see him working he's he's
[1:14:22] moving when you're not seeing him move
[1:14:24] he's he's putting things into place that
[1:14:27] that has to be there in order for things
[1:14:30] to happen so he's not slack according to
[1:14:33] his promise but as some men count
[1:14:36] slackness but his long-suffering to us
[1:14:39] word
[1:14:40] he doesn't want to bring it premature he
[1:14:43] knows exactly the right time exactly the
[1:14:46] right moment for your deliverance for
[1:14:49] your freedom for your Liberty for your
[1:14:51] healing or whatever it is that you're
[1:14:54] calling upon God for waiting on the
[1:14:56] coming of the Lord but you see it is his
[1:15:00] long-suffering toward us not willing
[1:15:03] that any should perish that all should
[1:15:06] come to repentance this is the kind of
[1:15:08] God that we serve
[1:15:10] he's a God that will even let things go
[1:15:13] into overtime
[1:15:15] in order to in order to save those
[1:15:19] because he's not willing that any should
[1:15:22] perish he wants all to be saved he's a
[1:15:26] lot different from us so you know we get
[1:15:28] a little bit carnal minded with us for
[1:15:31] and no more and we could care less that
[1:15:33] the world went to hell in a handbasket
[1:15:36] you know but God isn't that a way he's
[1:15:38] not willing that it is to perish
[1:15:41] amen he his whole desire is that men
[1:15:44] might be saved
[1:15:46] sure he wants a bride and he wants her
[1:15:48] without spot or recall but God's even
[1:15:51] bigger than that he's got people wrote
[1:15:53] in his book that are not his bride
[1:15:55] they're a multitude without number
[1:15:59] you can't even number them for the
[1:16:01] multitude he's got such a big heart he
[1:16:04] was not willing that any should perish
[1:16:07] but that all might have eternal life
[1:16:10] this is a God we served he's a god of
[1:16:13] Grace he's a god of Mercy he's the God
[1:16:15] of Peace he's a god of love
[1:16:18] and he reaches down Way Beyond your
[1:16:21] thinking and and your abilities I'm even
[1:16:24] able to love and God can love the
[1:16:27] unlovable and when you were unlovable he
[1:16:29] died for you
[1:16:30] [Applause]
[1:16:33] and one thing about this God he don't
[1:16:35] ever leave you where he found you
[1:16:38] but his whole purpose is to lift you up
[1:16:41] into a higher place
[1:16:43] he's not slacked toward his promise
[1:16:46] but that all should come to repentance
[1:16:49] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[1:16:52] thief in the night
[1:16:53] in which the heavens shall pass away
[1:16:56] with the great noise and the elements
[1:16:58] shall melt with a fervent Heat and the
[1:17:00] Earth and all the works that are darians
[1:17:02] shall be burned up seeing that all these
[1:17:05] shall be dissolved these things shall be
[1:17:08] dissolved what manner of person's
[1:17:11] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[1:17:14] and godliness
[1:17:15] now the amplifier says it this way and
[1:17:18] it's the way I want to kind of emphasize
[1:17:20] it in this service since all these
[1:17:23] things are thus in the process
[1:17:27] are being dissolved
[1:17:31] there is a process that God has
[1:17:34] he has a method he has a plan he has a
[1:17:38] purpose he has a purpose for us facing
[1:17:42] 2023 right ahead
[1:17:45] he has a purpose for why he has kept us
[1:17:47] as long as he has
[1:17:50] he has a purpose for the gospel going to
[1:17:53] Japan and to all these other places and
[1:17:56] reaching out into the far places because
[1:17:59] his long suffered he's not willing that
[1:18:02] any should perish in fact there are
[1:18:04] others that has been seen in the vision
[1:18:07] Walking In step with the word
[1:18:09] and some of them are out of stealth and
[1:18:12] they're out of harmony with God but he's
[1:18:15] not forgiving them he's not casting them
[1:18:18] aside even those that are not walking
[1:18:21] right is void the boy screams out get
[1:18:24] back in line get back in line you see
[1:18:26] what it is it's the mercies of God that
[1:18:30] is reaching out Way Beyond human
[1:18:32] comprehension
[1:18:34] now so as we see that the process of
[1:18:37] being resolved what kind of people
[1:18:39] ought each of you to be in the meanwhile
[1:18:41] and consecrated and holy behavior and
[1:18:44] devout and godly qualities so what kind
[1:18:48] of people are we to be seeing
[1:18:50] everything's coming to an end
[1:18:52] sin is going to come
[1:18:54] as a thief in the night
[1:18:57] seeing that it grinds slow but sure but
[1:19:00] it's coming
[1:19:01] what kind of people are we to be
[1:19:03] again it says since all these things
[1:19:05] will be destroyed in this way what kind
[1:19:08] of people should you be
[1:19:10] your lives should be holy and dedicated
[1:19:12] to God another translation or the next
[1:19:15] verse says looking for in Hasting unto
[1:19:18] the coming of the day of God we're in
[1:19:21] the heavens being on fire shall be
[1:19:23] dissolved and the elements shall melt
[1:19:25] with the fervent Heat
[1:19:28] I like it this when it says it this way
[1:19:30] in the in the Amplified as you wait for
[1:19:33] the day of God
[1:19:34] do your best
[1:19:37] or do your part
[1:19:39] to make it come soon
[1:19:45] so when you're looking at the coming of
[1:19:47] the Lord do you
[1:19:50] be ready
[1:19:51] don't let you be the hindrance
[1:19:55] amen do your best to make it come soon
[1:19:59] amen because you know again the day will
[1:20:03] come when the heavens will burn up and
[1:20:04] be destroyed and the heavenly bodies
[1:20:06] will be melt will melt by the fervent
[1:20:09] heat but nevertheless we according to
[1:20:11] his promise we look for new heavens and
[1:20:15] a new Earth wherein dwelleth
[1:20:16] righteousness
[1:20:18] where that righteousness will be at home
[1:20:20] you can look around in this world and
[1:20:23] you can see this is not our home
[1:20:28] the more you stay here
[1:20:30] the less welcome you feel
[1:20:34] your values the things you believe the
[1:20:36] things you hold true
[1:20:38] the lest you feel welcome
[1:20:40] you don't fit in
[1:20:42] you're not a part
[1:20:44] wherefore beloved sin that you look for
[1:20:46] such things be diligent that you may be
[1:20:48] found of him in peace without spot and
[1:20:51] blame us
[1:20:52] an account that the long suffering of
[1:20:54] Our Lord is salvation
[1:20:57] even as a beloved brother Paul also
[1:21:00] according to the wisdom given unto him
[1:21:02] that's written unto you and also in his
[1:21:04] epistle speaking in them are things in
[1:21:07] which are some things hard to be
[1:21:09] understood and which they that are
[1:21:11] learned or unstable rest as they do also
[1:21:14] the other scriptures to their own
[1:21:16] destruction
[1:21:18] yet ye therefore beloved sin you know
[1:21:22] these things before
[1:21:24] bewareless also ye also being led astray
[1:21:28] with the era of the wickedness fall from
[1:21:31] your own steadfastness but grow in Grace
[1:21:33] in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
[1:21:35] Jesus Christ to him be glory for now but
[1:21:39] now and forever
[1:21:42] so these are the words of Peter as he
[1:21:45] admonishes that to look toward the end
[1:21:48] times
[1:21:49] and we are living in the Fulfillment of
[1:21:51] the word of God and and it's been a long
[1:21:54] delay of 2 000 years yeah we've come
[1:21:57] down through seven churches
[1:22:00] and this made this made things you know
[1:22:03] in Our Generations as things begin to
[1:22:07] change and you you could The Winds of
[1:22:10] chains begin to blow and the moving of
[1:22:13] the Holy Spirit as The Farmer in the
[1:22:15] latter rain began to be poured out
[1:22:17] you can see it even begin but 1906 in
[1:22:22] our own
[1:22:23] um laodicea and AIDS where the Holy
[1:22:25] Spirit would be poured out there in
[1:22:28] Azusa Street and and then you know that
[1:22:31] would be it seemed like a time where
[1:22:33] they would just kind of sink down and
[1:22:34] despair and make another denomination
[1:22:37] and forget the original
[1:22:40] um uh call that they had and and didn't
[1:22:43] then we would see God move on the scene
[1:22:46] and he would send a an angel to a a man
[1:22:50] and would meet with him a prophet of God
[1:22:53] and an ordain him and send him out with
[1:22:56] a message of Divine Healing and this
[1:22:59] made men such as Jack Moore and Gordon
[1:23:02] Lindsay to write in their book Bible
[1:23:05] days are here again
[1:23:07] because they could see now scriptures
[1:23:10] that were literally being fulfilled and
[1:23:13] it caused a a Revival in a and uh and uh
[1:23:17] you know a and a time of of a real
[1:23:21] excitement as they looked into the
[1:23:24] promises of God and saw you know God is
[1:23:27] not just the god of the Bible but he's a
[1:23:29] god of today
[1:23:31] now so you know we we of course have
[1:23:35] seen many great things that have
[1:23:37] happened in this last age
[1:23:40] and Sarah and Abraham they also have
[1:23:43] seen great things happen and God had
[1:23:45] called Abraham 25 years before this at
[1:23:50] 75 years old and and Sarah was 65 and
[1:23:53] now the promise had been delayed for 25
[1:23:56] years
[1:23:58] when God gave him the promise of a son
[1:24:02] and being a great nation he was already
[1:24:05] an old man
[1:24:06] he was 75 as I said and even then when
[1:24:10] the promise was given it seemed
[1:24:13] impossible
[1:24:14] and that's the way it is when it comes
[1:24:17] to God's promises is always something
[1:24:19] that doesn't seem likely it just doesn't
[1:24:22] fit in the regular routine or doesn't
[1:24:26] fit with man's thinking and so it seemed
[1:24:29] impossible but you know even in there
[1:24:32] Satan would delay this promise even more
[1:24:37] in brother random would talk about this
[1:24:39] and I know my redeemer to liveth he said
[1:24:41] when Abraham was 75 he got the promise
[1:24:44] of God and he told him to Sarah and the
[1:24:47] devil said you know what I'm just going
[1:24:49] to delay that for a while
[1:24:51] I believe if I could just get them so
[1:24:54] old they'll lose faith and they'll know
[1:24:57] it can happen
[1:24:58] if they're already shaking at 75 if I
[1:25:01] can just keep it that way for a while
[1:25:03] and he kept it away until Abraham and
[1:25:06] Sarah were stooped in aged gray hair and
[1:25:10] stoop-shouldered but you know one thing
[1:25:13] the Devil May throw a stumbling block
[1:25:15] and a hindrance but he cannot stop the
[1:25:19] promise of God
[1:25:20] the promise of God is going to come to
[1:25:23] pass no matter what kind of obstacles
[1:25:26] the devil puts in the way her body was
[1:25:28] old her it was wrinkled the milk veins
[1:25:31] were dried up her heart was so weak it
[1:25:34] could not have went through labor but
[1:25:36] God lets us know his purpose will not be
[1:25:40] defeated
[1:25:41] a man he he changed Sarah made her back
[1:25:45] to a young woman again to the man a
[1:25:48] hundred years old turned it back to his
[1:25:50] youth now that may seem unreasonable
[1:25:53] but you see God gave a promise and the
[1:25:56] Bible looked at it for gave Abraham's
[1:25:59] mistakes and his stumbles along the way
[1:26:01] and he would write of him and Abraham
[1:26:04] started not at the promise of God
[1:26:05] through unbelief but was strong given
[1:26:08] for God praise for he judged him
[1:26:10] faithful and that he was able to perform
[1:26:13] what he promised
[1:26:15] now
[1:26:16] you know it seems there's always a delay
[1:26:19] when it comes to God's promises
[1:26:22] that's when you've got to be certain of
[1:26:23] God
[1:26:26] you may be looking maybe for something
[1:26:28] to happen
[1:26:29] maybe a husband to be saved maybe your
[1:26:33] children that are lost to come back
[1:26:35] you may be looking for a change in your
[1:26:37] finances or troubles in your home or or
[1:26:41] something that take place maybe you're
[1:26:43] Barren and you're looking for a child or
[1:26:45] you know something that that is that
[1:26:48] that is there that that you have an
[1:26:50] Earnest hope and expectation for
[1:26:53] but you just remember that that it seems
[1:26:56] that there's always a delay when it
[1:26:58] comes to God's promises but that's when
[1:27:01] you need to be certain of God
[1:27:04] you've got to be certain that he keeps
[1:27:06] his word that he's going to do what he
[1:27:08] said he would do there are delays
[1:27:10] sometimes when you pray that it don't
[1:27:12] seem that God will answer and that's
[1:27:16] again when you have to be certain of God
[1:27:19] you've got to be sure of him
[1:27:21] amen as brother Branham told us and be
[1:27:24] certain of God he said you know when we
[1:27:26] can confess our sins and we met a
[1:27:29] requirement that God requires we
[1:27:32] believed on God there's a circumstances
[1:27:35] that has to be met and it's according to
[1:27:37] his will and we confessed our sins and
[1:27:40] we made all the wrongs that we did right
[1:27:43] and we've done everything we know how to
[1:27:45] do every requirement that God had made
[1:27:48] or asked and we met that requirement and
[1:27:51] yet he remains silent he just don't
[1:27:55] answer us
[1:27:57] and he said I'm sure I'm speaking to
[1:27:58] people this morning who's come to that
[1:28:00] place and brother Brandon said I've been
[1:28:02] there myself many times when I went back
[1:28:06] and I traced my life and I've turned
[1:28:09] over every stone and I find that I did
[1:28:13] something's wrong and I go confess that
[1:28:16] and Lord God I'll make that right and
[1:28:18] I'll go do it and come back say now Lord
[1:28:20] You're God and you'll answer me surely
[1:28:23] I've met every request that you required
[1:28:25] me to do and every requirement that and
[1:28:28] I've met it and still he won't move
[1:28:32] he just seems to set silent that's what
[1:28:35] you got to be sure you've got to be sure
[1:28:38] that he's God
[1:28:40] don't be discouraged the only thing is
[1:28:43] that your heart is to be certain of God
[1:28:46] amen so when God gives a promise he
[1:28:49] doesn't say when
[1:28:52] he just says I'm going to do it
[1:28:55] and it's on my time
[1:28:59] not on your time
[1:29:01] and you're gonna wait
[1:29:03] and you're gonna have to have some
[1:29:04] patience
[1:29:06] but I'm going to bring it to pass but
[1:29:08] I'm going to teach you you know to to to
[1:29:11] wait and I'm going to teach you to have
[1:29:13] patience and I'm going to teach you so
[1:29:16] that you can run one day and not be
[1:29:18] weary and walk in that fate I'm going to
[1:29:21] teach you that you don't just easily
[1:29:23] give up
[1:29:24] you just don't throw in the towel and
[1:29:26] quit but you persevere
[1:29:29] perseverance holding on to the promise
[1:29:32] that when you take a hold it like Jacob
[1:29:34] did he was he was known as his other
[1:29:37] name was heel Grabber because he come
[1:29:39] out with his hand on his mother's heel
[1:29:41] he was a little bit late but he was
[1:29:43] grabbing to out there trying to be the
[1:29:46] first
[1:29:47] Amanda you know he was reaching out and
[1:29:50] though he was a little bit late as a
[1:29:52] he'll grab her he didn't give up
[1:29:54] he wanted that blessing he wanted the
[1:29:57] birthright he wanted the promise
[1:30:00] and he got the blessing of the firstborn
[1:30:02] because that he was perseverant
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:07] amen God it looked like it was for
[1:30:09] somebody else it looked like it would be
[1:30:11] delayed but God gave it to him because
[1:30:14] of his perseverance
[1:30:16] habaka two and three says for the vision
[1:30:19] is for an appointed time
[1:30:22] God has an appointed time he's as a set
[1:30:26] time for your promise to be fulfilled it
[1:30:29] wasn't fulfilled this year well he's got
[1:30:30] to set time for it your healing didn't
[1:30:33] come to yep today he's got to set time
[1:30:35] for it your children wasn't saved yet
[1:30:38] and hadn't come in he's got to set time
[1:30:40] for it amen you you've got the you need
[1:30:43] a new job or you need to be blessed
[1:30:45] God's got to set time for it you know
[1:30:48] your whole deal is to be certain of God
[1:30:51] be certain that he has the perfect
[1:30:54] timing that he won't bring it
[1:30:56] prematurely
[1:30:58] amen but everything's going to be in
[1:31:00] place he's a god of order that places
[1:31:03] things in the right place
[1:31:05] amen because he said at the end it shall
[1:31:08] speak
[1:31:09] and not lie though it Terry wait for it
[1:31:13] because it will surely come
[1:31:16] it will not carry so you see he said the
[1:31:20] vision is for an appointed time but at
[1:31:23] the end it shall speak
[1:31:25] you see this is when the vision Speaks
[1:31:28] now that not during the delay but when
[1:31:31] when the end comes then you see the
[1:31:35] reason speaking and it will not lie
[1:31:38] it'll it though it Parry wait for it
[1:31:41] because it will surely come God's
[1:31:44] promises surely come to pass
[1:31:47] the Bible said in Hebrews 6 and 12 he
[1:31:51] that we are to be followers of them who
[1:31:53] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:31:57] promise you say brother Tim I believe
[1:31:59] yes you believe but God requires some
[1:32:02] patience to go along with your faith
[1:32:05] a lot of people just say well I've got
[1:32:08] the faith for it I believe God I accept
[1:32:10] it is my promise but then they give up
[1:32:12] because they don't have patience
[1:32:15] but I want you to notice this through
[1:32:17] faith and patience that you inherit the
[1:32:20] promise for when God made the promise of
[1:32:24] Abraham because he could swear by no
[1:32:26] greater he swear by himself and when he
[1:32:30] swerved himself what he did he was
[1:32:32] pledging all that he was he was saying
[1:32:35] Out of Heaven is behind us all my
[1:32:38] Majesty all my power all my glory all my
[1:32:42] honor is all behind the promise that I'm
[1:32:45] giving
[1:32:46] and because he could swear by no greater
[1:32:49] he swear by himself and so he said
[1:32:52] Saiyan surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:32:55] and multiplying I will multiply thee and
[1:32:59] I said so after he had patiently endured
[1:33:04] he obtained the promise
[1:33:08] what he had to First patiently
[1:33:11] endure
[1:33:13] it didn't just come with the snap of the
[1:33:15] finger
[1:33:16] God give the promise and that was it
[1:33:19] but no he had to patiently endure
[1:33:23] but listen to his word that all happened
[1:33:26] is behind us with blessing I will bless
[1:33:30] you
[1:33:31] can't you take that promise to yourself
[1:33:34] amen you're the Seed of Abraham
[1:33:37] if God gave this promise to Abraham he
[1:33:39] gave it to you too that blessing I Will
[1:33:42] Bless thee and I'm going to multiply you
[1:33:45] I'm going to make you greater than where
[1:33:47] you are
[1:33:48] that you're not going to stand in
[1:33:50] mediocrity you're not going to remain
[1:33:52] where you are in this moment but I'm
[1:33:55] going to add to you you're going to be
[1:33:57] blessed you're going to be honored
[1:33:59] you're going to be lifted up you're not
[1:34:02] on your way down you're on your way up I
[1:34:05] want you to know you are not the people
[1:34:07] of the dissension that is falling we
[1:34:11] have a world that is falling it is
[1:34:13] falling into sin it is falling in
[1:34:15] unbelief but you are not that kind of
[1:34:18] people you are the people who will rise
[1:34:20] you are the people of the Ascension you
[1:34:23] are the people of the rapture
[1:34:28] but it takes faith and takes patience
[1:34:34] now let me say it this way
[1:34:36] first you've got to get in agreement
[1:34:38] with God
[1:34:42] that's your first step
[1:34:44] Lord you promised you would bust me
[1:34:48] you promised no good thing would you
[1:34:50] hold from them to walk uprightly
[1:34:52] you promised Lord you you would bless me
[1:34:55] in the field you'd bless me you know in
[1:34:57] the city you would bless me and
[1:34:59] everywhere you you promised your
[1:35:00] blessings your blessings is upon me God
[1:35:03] the spirit of the Lord is upon me I
[1:35:06] can't help but be blessed I'm the son of
[1:35:09] prosperity I'm like Joseph in the Bible
[1:35:12] no matter what comes against me I'm
[1:35:14] going to prosper doesn't matter if I'm
[1:35:17] sold into Egypt or throw down in a pit
[1:35:19] first I'm going to be blessed am I
[1:35:22] blessed with life and lived out in Egypt
[1:35:24] blessed there to become a servant and a
[1:35:27] slave I gotta learn the language I got
[1:35:29] to learn the custom I gotta start at the
[1:35:31] bottom people want to start at the top
[1:35:33] and God said I'm going to bring you
[1:35:35] through some series of things
[1:35:37] so that when you reach the position that
[1:35:40] I want you in you have the character to
[1:35:42] go with it
[1:35:46] [Applause]
[1:35:47] I'm not going to just Elevate you from a
[1:35:50] young boy you know with a dream and a
[1:35:53] vision and oh I saw you kneel down to me
[1:35:56] and I'm going to be in this great
[1:35:58] position and you know and wear this coat
[1:36:01] a little color of Many Colors and
[1:36:02] strutting around God said no no I can't
[1:36:05] put you there yet
[1:36:09] I got some things to do for you
[1:36:11] there's got to be some working on your
[1:36:13] character
[1:36:14] there's got to be changings in your
[1:36:16] attitudes I'm going to teach you
[1:36:18] something in this trial you to never
[1:36:20] learned by somebody telling you
[1:36:25] you're going to go through some things
[1:36:27] that are going to hone you and give you
[1:36:29] a character that you can help others
[1:36:32] that you're going to be a beacon that
[1:36:34] you're going to be a light and a
[1:36:35] testimony say well brother Tim my family
[1:36:38] isn't served in God and my servant my
[1:36:41] family is all broke apart and my mom and
[1:36:44] dad they won't even speak to each other
[1:36:45] but God allowing you to go through that
[1:36:48] so that you can break the cycle
[1:36:51] that you can show that out of weakness
[1:36:53] God can make strength that God can show
[1:36:56] that out of your life he can have an
[1:36:58] overcomer no matter what kind of evil
[1:37:01] that you were set in and the troubles
[1:37:03] that were against you amen God comes
[1:37:06] through to produce a character in your
[1:37:09] life to make you an overcomer to be ever
[1:37:12] said a light a testimony that others
[1:37:15] might see
[1:37:19] after he had patiently endured he
[1:37:22] obtained the promise
[1:37:24] it takes faith and patience not just
[1:37:28] Faith well brother Tim I've got faith I
[1:37:30] received the Revelation glory to God we
[1:37:33] got the faith of this message we got the
[1:37:35] faith we are got the original Faith well
[1:37:37] God's giving you some patience
[1:37:39] you're going to have to learn some
[1:37:41] patience to go along with it
[1:37:43] but first thing I want to say you're
[1:37:45] going to have to get in agreement with
[1:37:47] God
[1:37:48] and then the battle is from then on to
[1:37:52] stay in agreement with God
[1:37:55] got to give you a promise maybe it's the
[1:37:57] promise of healing and and you agree
[1:38:00] with it yes amen but then the doctor's
[1:38:03] report comes
[1:38:05] then the negative report comes
[1:38:09] then the opposition comes that's the
[1:38:11] battle to stay in agreement
[1:38:14] you've got to stay in agreement with God
[1:38:16] and I want to say this the promise has
[1:38:19] got to get in your spirit first
[1:38:23] you see once it's in your spirit then it
[1:38:26] becomes your confession
[1:38:29] a lot of people that never let the
[1:38:31] promise of God become in their Spirit
[1:38:33] you can tell you know oh they're still
[1:38:36] in their Wilds see whilst he Woos are
[1:38:37] still in their troubles and they're all
[1:38:40] my heartaches and I spin this way all my
[1:38:42] life like I was preaching last Sunday
[1:38:44] you're in the darkness of the tent
[1:38:47] and God's calling you to come and do the
[1:38:49] light
[1:38:51] amen let the light shine on the Promises
[1:38:54] of God for you but but you see you
[1:38:56] you've got to get in your spirit first
[1:38:58] this is the way that Sarah was she had
[1:39:01] heard the promise but it had never got
[1:39:03] in her spirit
[1:39:05] she sat back in her doldrums in her
[1:39:08] wowzy wowzy Woos in her lukewarmness and
[1:39:11] she laid back their inner despondency
[1:39:14] it'll never be me it'll never happen for
[1:39:17] me if my others get blessed but I don't
[1:39:19] ever get blessed look like when healing
[1:39:21] the angel comes by and there's healing
[1:39:24] in the church somebody else gets a
[1:39:26] blessing but I don't get it amen where
[1:39:28] where is there a blind part of mass
[1:39:31] that'll sit by the wayside and hear
[1:39:33] Jesus is present and screams out thou
[1:39:37] son of David Don't Pass Me By amen
[1:39:41] somebody that'll get an agreement amen
[1:39:43] he's the Redeemer he's the Savior but
[1:39:46] he's not just the Savior and the
[1:39:48] Redeemer but he's my savior and he's my
[1:39:51] redeemer
[1:39:53] he's my God
[1:39:54] [Applause]
[1:40:00] wants your spirit
[1:40:02] once it's in your spirit it becomes your
[1:40:05] confession
[1:40:06] then you start confessing that I'm
[1:40:09] Healed
[1:40:10] yes I have my troubles yes maybe today's
[1:40:15] not been the best day but it's still I'm
[1:40:18] still healed
[1:40:19] his word is still true
[1:40:22] I know this is just part of my story
[1:40:25] this is just part of my journey amen
[1:40:28] this is part of the steps that I have to
[1:40:30] take I've got to go down into the low
[1:40:32] valleys in order to get up on the
[1:40:34] mountains
[1:40:36] come on Amen I've got to go through the
[1:40:39] hardships in order to enjoy the
[1:40:41] blessings
[1:40:43] you seek to believe is a commitment and
[1:40:46] you have to have the boldness to believe
[1:40:49] when you believe a promise you're
[1:40:51] committing yourself to it
[1:40:56] come on God gives a vow and he said I'm
[1:40:58] not giving up I'm putting all in heaven
[1:41:01] listen when you enter into Covenant with
[1:41:03] God you need to come with the same thing
[1:41:06] with the same tenacity God you gave a
[1:41:08] promise and I'm not giving up on it if
[1:41:11] you're pledging all you have to fulfill
[1:41:14] this then I'm pledging all I have to see
[1:41:17] that it's fulfilled I'm going to do my
[1:41:19] part
[1:41:25] people look for evidence
[1:41:27] I need evidence
[1:41:29] the Bible said faith
[1:41:32] is the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:41:36] that's the only evidence you need
[1:41:39] is faith
[1:41:41] be uncertain of God
[1:41:43] knowing god said it
[1:41:45] he said he was wounded for my
[1:41:47] transgressions he said he was bruised
[1:41:50] from my iniquities he said he took his
[1:41:52] my weapons that I should have got he
[1:41:55] took them upon himself and with his
[1:41:57] stripes I am healed
[1:41:59] amen you know I may not see it yet but
[1:42:02] that's I'm already healed
[1:42:04] hey man I'm already here's Abraham I'm a
[1:42:07] father of Nations
[1:42:09] would secede Abraham don't have one yet
[1:42:11] but I'm a father of Nations

[1:42:16] wear that name
[1:42:19] come on
[1:42:20] amen you got to change your name and
[1:42:24] your identity from being I'm the sick
[1:42:27] one I'm the troubled one I'm the one I'm
[1:42:29] always all of hell is against me and I
[1:42:32] you know always poor mouth you've got to
[1:42:34] change your confession I'm a son of the
[1:42:38] most high God Amen I'm a child of Glory
[1:42:41] I am the redeemed of the Lord I am the
[1:42:45] blessed to God I am all that he said
[1:42:47] that I am I am who he said I am
[1:42:54] I need evidence your faith is the
[1:42:58] evidence
[1:43:00] of Things Not Seen
[1:43:02] faith is the evidence of things you only
[1:43:06] could hope for
[1:43:08] you have the evidence when you have
[1:43:10] faith
[1:43:11] When you pray you might be like Elijah
[1:43:15] you pray
[1:43:17] and there's there's no cloud
[1:43:20] you send the you send the guy out
[1:43:23] looking and you pray with all your heart
[1:43:25] the Bible said that that Elijah was a
[1:43:29] man of like passion as we are and he
[1:43:31] prayed earnestly
[1:43:33] and here he would pray earnestly one
[1:43:36] time and it didn't happen sin is serving
[1:43:39] out what do you see I don't see nothing
[1:43:42] you mean Elijah prayed and nothing
[1:43:44] happened yeah Elijah prayed and nothing
[1:43:47] happened
[1:43:48] but God had given a promise I'm going to
[1:43:50] send rain
[1:43:51] and Abraham I mean Elijah was not going
[1:43:54] to give up on that promise he didn't see
[1:43:57] it the first time he didn't see it the
[1:44:00] second time he didn't see it the third
[1:44:02] time he didn't see it the fourth time he
[1:44:05] didn't see it the fifth time he didn't
[1:44:07] see it the sixth time but the seventh
[1:44:09] time
[1:44:11] the servant come back and said yeah I
[1:44:14] see something it ain't much
[1:44:17] it ain't a big sign
[1:44:20] you know but but I wanted you to know
[1:44:22] your delay is over I did see a cloud and
[1:44:27] it's the size of a man's hand that's all
[1:44:30] I need I don't need anything else go
[1:44:34] prepare go tell me how prepare his
[1:44:37] Chariot amen girl I'm gonna run before
[1:44:40] him that gave him such energy he said I
[1:44:44] hear the sound of the abundance of rain
[1:44:47] [Music]
[1:44:48] Hallelujah when you see just a little
[1:44:51] bit of move you begin to say I can hear
[1:44:55] back here get ready coming I hear the
[1:44:59] blessing coming I hear the power coming
[1:45:07] I don't need a great move I just see a
[1:45:10] little something happen I just see God
[1:45:13] is on the scene it may not move much but
[1:45:17] gotta take something that is little and
[1:45:19] he'll make it big
[1:45:23] I'll tell you it's about time for Godly
[1:45:25] in your drought
[1:45:28] it's about time for the famine to be
[1:45:30] over it's about time for you to come
[1:45:33] into your blessings isn't that time that
[1:45:36] the god of Elijah saw himself to be the
[1:45:39] same yesterday today and forever
[1:45:54] you see victory
[1:45:56] lays on the other side of your struggle
[1:46:01] victory
[1:46:05] is on the other side
[1:46:07] of your trial
[1:46:10] I want to tell you
[1:46:12] there will always be a red sea in your
[1:46:16] way
[1:46:21] there will always be Giants in the land
[1:46:23] that God gave you to inherit
[1:46:28] sometimes it is so dark you can't see
[1:46:32] your hand in front of your face
[1:46:36] and brother Brandon would tell us that
[1:46:38] very words and he said but there is a
[1:46:40] man here
[1:46:44] that God is present
[1:46:46] to turn on the lights
[1:46:48] that any moment that suddenly things
[1:46:51] could change
[1:46:53] and I want you to begin to look in your
[1:46:56] life for a sudden change
[1:46:59] for things that you have prayed for
[1:47:01] dreamed about had visions of Lord you
[1:47:05] long far for suddenly
[1:47:08] you see the Lord certainly will come to
[1:47:11] his Temple there's things that God does
[1:47:14] that he you know that he you know it
[1:47:16] seemed like there's been a delay and
[1:47:18] I'll hold him back and then suddenly
[1:47:20] everything begins to change suddenly
[1:47:22] there's a cloud the size of a man's hand
[1:47:29] Mary and Martha
[1:47:31] they
[1:47:33] were friends of Jesus
[1:47:35] but they experienced a delay
[1:47:39] Jesus would delay his coming
[1:47:42] you know why Jesus would delay his
[1:47:44] coming
[1:47:45] so he could be a part of their story
[1:47:49] where he could show I am the
[1:47:50] resurrection and the life
[1:47:53] so that he could come right down there
[1:47:55] and man move right into the story of
[1:47:58] their life and then life their story
[1:48:01] would have never been the same had my
[1:48:03] life was died
[1:48:05] nobody would have known that he was a
[1:48:07] resurrection in the life
[1:48:09] amen that a man for days dead and four
[1:48:12] days on his journey into the regions of
[1:48:16] the dead here would be called back
[1:48:18] nobody would have ever known that we'd
[1:48:20] never experienced that
[1:48:22] unless there was a delay
[1:48:25] but God had a purpose
[1:48:28] he had a plan
[1:48:30] and he says I gotta wait here
[1:48:32] because I've got a moment I'm going to
[1:48:34] show up
[1:48:37] I want you to look at the moment when
[1:48:39] God shows up
[1:48:41] and he shows out
[1:48:43] I want to tell you today God's about to
[1:48:46] show up in your life
[1:48:48] and when God shows up he shows out
[1:48:51] Hallelujah he the drought becomes over
[1:48:53] the rain comes and you ought to be
[1:48:55] hearing it tomorrow this morning as the
[1:48:57] word comes forward that's the sound
[1:49:00] that's the sound it's the sound the
[1:49:03] rain's coming
[1:49:04] it's a sad blessings are about to fall
[1:49:07] that the promise is about to be
[1:49:09] fulfilled in my life
[1:49:10] [Applause]
[1:49:15] God wants to write himself in your story
[1:49:19] there will be your Red Sea that he comes
[1:49:22] and fights for you
[1:49:23] that he say this battle's not yours
[1:49:27] it's mine
[1:49:30] I'm personally involved in your life
[1:49:33] you're not on your own you're not just a
[1:49:36] drift in life C
[1:49:38] but I'm the guide I'm your director
[1:49:42] I'm Your Leader I'm there for you I'll
[1:49:45] never leave you or forsake you
[1:49:50] as it was in the days of Noah there was
[1:49:53] delay
[1:49:54] Peter refers to this as while the ark
[1:49:58] wasn't preparing
[1:50:00] while things were being made ready for
[1:50:03] that great climatic change that was
[1:50:05] going to happen
[1:50:08] and Jesus warned us of this day as he
[1:50:11] said as it was in the days of Noah
[1:50:14] and it is now time as you know for the
[1:50:17] cleansing of the Earth for the
[1:50:19] millennium but this time it is by fire
[1:50:23] there'd be nuclear destruction
[1:50:25] there's never been an age where that the
[1:50:28] Beast has power as recorded in
[1:50:30] Revelation 13 to be do miracles in the
[1:50:34] sight of the World by bringing fire down
[1:50:36] out of heaven
[1:50:38] there's never been a time like in the
[1:50:41] book of Zechariah where the plague would
[1:50:43] be that that as the nuclear destruction
[1:50:47] comes across that men would be standing
[1:50:49] and their flesh would just melt off of
[1:50:52] their bones and their eyes and their
[1:50:54] sockets
[1:50:55] never been a day like we're in where
[1:50:58] we're so close
[1:51:00] on the edge of the burning
[1:51:07] 90 years ago it was spoken it'll be 90
[1:51:11] in this next year
[1:51:13] in June of 1933 it was seen in the
[1:51:16] vision smoke bombs and craters all over
[1:51:19] the land of America as far as the eye
[1:51:22] could see
[1:51:24] but I want just to know that's just part
[1:51:26] of the burning of the Earth
[1:51:28] America will burn the Bible said Rome
[1:51:31] will burn but then the whole earth will
[1:51:33] burn and the righteous will walk out on
[1:51:35] the ashes of the wicked and never forget
[1:51:38] that part of Malachi 4 says that God
[1:51:41] will send the light to the prophet
[1:51:42] before the coming of the day of the Lord
[1:51:45] right now is men's day but the day of
[1:51:49] the Lord brings a Day of Reckoning
[1:51:51] and the Bible tells you there that that
[1:51:54] the that the Earth will burn as an oven
[1:51:58] and that the righteous will walk out on
[1:52:00] the ashes of the wicked for the great
[1:52:03] Millennial ring and he said I'm going to
[1:52:06] send you a lie to the prophet before
[1:52:08] this happens because there's got to be a
[1:52:11] people's heart that'll turn back to the
[1:52:14] gospel of Christ
[1:52:15] amen there's got to be the true gospel
[1:52:18] restored in order for the people to be
[1:52:22] made ready because I'm not just going to
[1:52:25] destroy the Earth but without taking a
[1:52:29] Remnant I'm gonna do what I said I'm
[1:52:31] going to have a bride and she'll be
[1:52:33] without spa or without wrinkle or
[1:52:35] without blemish
[1:52:39] but to do this
[1:52:41] the world's in confusion
[1:52:43] the world's in darkness
[1:52:45] the world's in trouble
[1:52:47] the world's split up and
[1:52:49] 40 something thousand denominational
[1:52:52] views
[1:52:54] you have a difficult time
[1:52:56] weighing yourself well I want to find
[1:52:58] the truth brother Tim
[1:53:00] I want to find the real truth
[1:53:03] well go out there forty thousand
[1:53:06] denominations
[1:53:08] go search them all out
[1:53:11] how many lifetimes that going to take
[1:53:14] to listen to all this this and says this
[1:53:16] and this and says that your yo-yo up and
[1:53:19] down
[1:53:20] don't know what to believe
[1:53:22] that's why God had to vindicate a word
[1:53:24] in this day
[1:53:26] to take all the guessing out of it
[1:53:29] amen God wanted you to know of assured
[1:53:31] you what his word was by confirming it
[1:53:34] with signs following
[1:53:36] amen so I want you to forget that part
[1:53:39] of Malachi 4 that says that God will
[1:53:41] send the lives of the Prophet before the
[1:53:43] coming of the day of the Lord that there
[1:53:45] Comes a Day of Reckoning
[1:53:47] and we're in a Day of Reckoning
[1:53:50] the Bible tells you and we'll turn to
[1:53:52] Revelation 16 15. I want to read a few
[1:53:54] verses here but you know again the Bible
[1:53:58] tells you that there are vials or bowls
[1:54:01] of Judgment of stored up judgments that
[1:54:04] are just waiting to be poured out
[1:54:08] isn't that amazing
[1:54:11] that God would have actually both shown
[1:54:14] symbolically in the Book of Revelation
[1:54:17] as vials or bowls of judgment
[1:54:20] that are stored up
[1:54:22] that are waiting to be poured out
[1:54:27] you often wonder why does God delay and
[1:54:30] pouring it out
[1:54:31] why does God wait until certain time
[1:54:35] I can think down to the Dark Ages when
[1:54:38] men and women were at the at the the
[1:54:42] stocks being beat and whipped
[1:54:45] women's hair dipped and tired and burnt
[1:54:48] the breasts cut off babies cut out
[1:54:51] gamble over the sex
[1:54:54] treated him like worse than animals
[1:54:58] 68 million down to the Dark Ages killed
[1:55:01] and slaughtered
[1:55:05] let me tell you the only reason they
[1:55:07] could do it
[1:55:08] was because they were anointed to do so
[1:55:11] I want you to get the picture
[1:55:13] they didn't do that on their own
[1:55:15] there was a the ox anointing or the calf
[1:55:18] anointing of the four anointings of the
[1:55:21] spirit of God the lion the ox the man
[1:55:23] and the eagle and that day the ox
[1:55:25] anointing that Holy Spirit the cherubim
[1:55:28] had turned and looked toward them that
[1:55:29] way and said my Deliverance is going to
[1:55:31] be
[1:55:32] for you through death
[1:55:35] a beast of sacrifice
[1:55:38] and I'll deliver my people
[1:55:40] but they'll be faithful unto death
[1:55:46] I'll brother Tim I'll tell you what I I
[1:55:48] can't live this message I'll tell you
[1:55:50] what I'll just go I'm not going to make
[1:55:52] the Rapture I'll just make it in the
[1:55:54] defibrillation you can't live for it now
[1:55:56] how are you going to die for it then
[1:56:05] I wouldn't make plans for that
[1:56:09] amen right now there's an anointing and
[1:56:12] it's not an ox anointing
[1:56:14] it's an eagle anointing and it's not a
[1:56:17] Sitting Duck it's a flying eagle
[1:56:19] amen and don't worry about crossing the
[1:56:21] river and then it flies right over
[1:56:24] between death right into the other
[1:56:26] dimensions it crosses right over amen is
[1:56:29] said of you that they that wait of the
[1:56:31] Lord they will renew their strength and
[1:56:34] they will Mount up with wings as an
[1:56:36] eagle
[1:56:37] they'll run and not be weary they'll
[1:56:39] walk and not faint
[1:56:42] this is called the anointing upon this
[1:56:44] age
[1:56:46] it's the eagle anointing it's the
[1:56:48] miracle anointing it's where he snatches
[1:56:50] the people away it's his Escape
[1:56:53] I want you to know the Rapture is an
[1:56:55] escape
[1:56:56] some people say well I don't look as a
[1:56:58] Rapture as an escape it is an escape
[1:57:00] the Bible said we should pray always
[1:57:02] Jesus I pray always to be counted worthy
[1:57:05] to escape the things that are coming
[1:57:08] upon this Earth
[1:57:09] and God has provided a way out for you
[1:57:13] just as he provided away through the Red
[1:57:15] Sea and Escape for Israel God has
[1:57:18] provided an escape for you in this day
[1:57:20] you'll not go through the tribulation
[1:57:22] little children you're going to go into
[1:57:24] Rapture amen you're going to escape the
[1:57:27] judgments
[1:57:28] because I've got to judge the world
[1:57:35] but I can't judge it yet
[1:57:39] you see
[1:57:41] I can't judge it I can't pour out those
[1:57:44] judgments on the earth until I get my
[1:57:46] people out of there
[1:57:51] why God would you delay here they are
[1:57:55] screaming out against that Beast system
[1:57:57] against the great against the
[1:58:01] evils that are done calling on the name
[1:58:03] of the Lord watching their children
[1:58:05] killed and slaughtered murdered
[1:58:07] and all this God why don't you answer
[1:58:10] and how come you won't judge them and
[1:58:12] how come you don't move and God says I'm
[1:58:16] reserving it
[1:58:18] because there's a part the great
[1:58:20] has to play in the end time I can't wipe
[1:58:23] her out yet
[1:58:25] she's got a part to fulfill
[1:58:27] so therefore what I'm going to do is all
[1:58:30] these curses
[1:58:32] all of these speaking against us God
[1:58:34] don't let them fall to the ground he
[1:58:36] stores it up
[1:58:38] and he holds it in bowls of judgment
[1:58:41] to be poured out in the tribulation
[1:58:44] you see the Bible tells you that you
[1:58:47] know that we should rest with him
[1:58:48] concerning the coming of the Lord
[1:58:50] because that that God he is he he's not
[1:58:55] unrighteous to forget he's a he's a
[1:58:57] Kinsman he's a kinsman redeemer but yes
[1:59:00] he's a Kinsman Avenger and he says I'm
[1:59:02] going to avenge that which is done wrong
[1:59:04] I want you to know today the devil and
[1:59:08] none of his angels will ever get by with
[1:59:11] anything they've ever done to a child of
[1:59:13] God
[1:59:16] I want you to know that God is on the
[1:59:19] trail because his kids but Redeemer it's
[1:59:22] his honor
[1:59:24] to right the wrongs that's been done to
[1:59:27] you
[1:59:30] not only will Satan have a jail time of
[1:59:33] a thousand years but he's going to have
[1:59:36] an end
[1:59:37] but glory to God you don't have an end
[1:59:40] and you don't have any jail time amen
[1:59:43] you're going to be a journey enjoying a
[1:59:46] millennium a thousand years of Peace
[1:59:48] reigning with him as king of kings and
[1:59:51] Lord of Lord the Queen by his side amen
[1:59:54] you're you are people of the Ascension
[1:59:56] amen you're ascending into Glory you're
[1:59:59] not going down you're going up
[2:00:01] [Applause]
[2:00:07] verse 15 of chapter 16.
[2:00:10] behold I come as a thief
[2:00:13] these are the words that Peter had said
[2:00:17] he comes as a thief
[2:00:20] comes in suddenly
[2:00:23] quietly
[2:00:25] he gets what he wants
[2:00:27] and goes
[2:00:33] I'm coming as a thief
[2:00:36] oh you said brother to him when he comes
[2:00:38] ever I will see him and every tongue
[2:00:39] will confess wrong coming
[2:00:43] they'll look on him when they appears
[2:00:45] from coming
[2:00:48] yes do you know we're we're not just in
[2:00:50] one coming in this day you know you know
[2:00:52] right in this in this last day there are
[2:00:55] more than one coming of the Lord
[2:00:58] really yeah there's more than one coming
[2:01:00] there's a coming he came two thousand
[2:01:03] years ago to redeem a church
[2:01:05] amen then he comes for a church and then
[2:01:09] he comes back with his church
[2:01:11] so in this day there's actually not very
[2:01:14] many years difference or between the
[2:01:17] Coming Far and they're coming back with
[2:01:21] amen
[2:01:24] we are in the day of a double coming
[2:01:30] he's coming for you
[2:01:32] and you're coming back with him
[2:01:34] you're going away for a marriage supper
[2:01:36] of the Lamb and then you spend three and
[2:01:39] a half years with him in glory
[2:01:43] I don't know how it's going to be but I
[2:01:45] kind of Envision it like this
[2:01:47] as we're all sitting down there you know
[2:01:49] there are seven there are seven plagues
[2:01:52] there there are the seven seven vials of
[2:01:55] place of startup judgments if you read
[2:01:58] real carefully there are seven angels
[2:02:00] these seven angel or seven churches
[2:02:03] Messengers these seven angels there they
[2:02:06] also hold seven bias because he said one
[2:02:09] said to me which held one of the seven
[2:02:11] vials uh he said to me come and let me
[2:02:14] show you the Lamb's wife come let me
[2:02:17] show you the Judgment of the great
[2:02:19] and he was so much like Christ and he
[2:02:21] bowed down to worship Him John who knew
[2:02:24] better than to worship Angels or
[2:02:26] anything else this one is so much like
[2:02:28] Christ he bowed down the words of enemy
[2:02:30] because he got sins of Ministry of
[2:02:32] Christ in this man and he bowed down the
[2:02:36] word somebody said don't you do it I'm a
[2:02:37] prophet like you are
[2:02:39] I'm one of your fellow servants
[2:02:42] so a man was holding the vials of
[2:02:45] judgment he's called a messenger an
[2:02:47] angel
[2:02:49] you see angels can be Earthly men or
[2:02:52] Heavenly Creatures
[2:02:57] behold I send my messenger my angel
[2:02:59] before my face that was John the Baptist
[2:03:02] he was an angel
[2:03:04] he was a messenger
[2:03:06] it wasn't winged angel
[2:03:08] he was in a Heavenly Angel he was an
[2:03:10] Earthly angel
[2:03:12] seven angels seven Church ages seven
[2:03:15] Messengers
[2:03:16] these are two Seven Ages
[2:03:20] what is God doing he's bringing a
[2:03:22] message and I can Envision as we're all
[2:03:25] sitting down there
[2:03:26] at the great marriage supper of the Lamb
[2:03:29] I can hear him almost down at this side
[2:03:31] of the table
[2:03:33] as he wipes away all tears and takes for
[2:03:36] my remembrance
[2:03:37] and they look over across and some of
[2:03:40] them looks and say well you know how we
[2:03:43] were persecuted and what happened and
[2:03:45] how you died and you know and here we
[2:03:47] are look at us we're enjoying the
[2:03:50] marriage supper of the Lamb it wasn't in
[2:03:52] vain brother
[2:03:53] when you stood on the ice and you went
[2:03:55] down naked there and freezing and and
[2:03:59] you stood there and you would not deny
[2:04:01] his name and you live for what you knew
[2:04:04] you stood for the gospel it was been
[2:04:06] worth it all has it brother
[2:04:09] about that time one of the messengers
[2:04:11] stands up and said time for a little
[2:04:13] entertainment
[2:04:17] he picks up his bowl of judgment
[2:04:21] and he walks over between the corners of
[2:04:24] Heaven and Earth
[2:04:25] he pours out a judgment
[2:04:29] and there's all kinds of hell that is
[2:04:32] Unleashed on the Earth
[2:04:33] as judgment comes on the Earth
[2:04:37] and he walks back and he takes a seat at
[2:04:39] the table
[2:04:40] and the whole process is repeating until
[2:04:43] all the judgments of God is poured out
[2:04:45] this all happens
[2:04:47] in the great wedding supper
[2:04:50] I'm coming as a thief as I said how does
[2:04:54] the thief come
[2:04:55] you know I'll know when he's coming
[2:04:57] brother tell me I know you better be
[2:04:59] watching
[2:05:01] there is one word that is given
[2:05:03] concerned in his company he said watch
[2:05:10] don't go to sleep
[2:05:12] Don't Close Your Eyes
[2:05:14] don't pretend it's always going to be
[2:05:16] the way it is today it ain't change is
[2:05:20] about to happen
[2:05:22] foreign
[2:05:23] you can already see seasons is changing
[2:05:27] you can know storms are coming
[2:05:30] you look out there you know and you can
[2:05:33] feel the humidity in the air and you can
[2:05:35] feel the pressure you know the
[2:05:37] barometric pressure you can feel all of
[2:05:39] this you know you know it's not
[2:05:41] summertime you know that there's a storm
[2:05:44] coming you know Monster is building up
[2:05:47] for a big class in the heavens
[2:05:50] and you know with the trouble that's on
[2:05:53] the earth When sin is reaching its
[2:05:55] height you know that it's all building
[2:05:58] up with a great war in the heavens and
[2:06:01] the devil will be cast down and a pride
[2:06:04] will go up
[2:06:08] it cannot always remain the way it is
[2:06:13] these are changing and we can feel the
[2:06:16] whims of change
[2:06:22] how does the teeth come
[2:06:24] you know how I described it before
[2:06:28] you're laying in your bed
[2:06:30] there's a big picture window in your
[2:06:32] room
[2:06:34] Here Comes
[2:06:35] a thief in the middle of the night
[2:06:38] he takes this big rock
[2:06:41] talking about that big finds a brick or
[2:06:44] a bat
[2:06:45] and he comes and he smashes that windows
[2:06:48] and he jumps in and screams on apathy
[2:06:54] what's he shaking your head for
[2:06:58] you Google that you know Google will
[2:06:59] probably tell you that
[2:07:01] Miss Google don't get everything right
[2:07:07] that's not a way a thief comes
[2:07:09] our thief comes in secret
[2:07:12] he comes in he gets what he wants
[2:07:16] and he leaves
[2:07:18] and nobody even knew he was there
[2:07:21] and it may be a month later oh that
[2:07:23] jewelry that money I had that stored
[2:07:25] away under the bed or in the closet or
[2:07:27] here there in my Hiding Place and it's
[2:07:29] not there did you get it Johnny did you
[2:07:31] see it James did you John you know who
[2:07:34] who was it who got this no we never said
[2:07:36] Mama I had never touched it
[2:07:38] finally you realize it was a thief
[2:07:42] and that's where the Rapture is going to
[2:07:44] be
[2:07:45] God's going to come and take his little
[2:07:47] bride his prized possession like a thief
[2:07:51] in the night and he is going to take his
[2:07:53] bride out of here and the world will go
[2:07:55] on just like it always has
[2:08:00] it won't be reported in Fox News
[2:08:03] not on CNN
[2:08:06] so don't be watching for the news to see
[2:08:08] if the Rapture took place
[2:08:14] raptures don't happen in CNN
[2:08:18] you get drugged down not taken up
[2:08:25] and that's where it's coming
[2:08:27] his coming
[2:08:29] the way he says in fact
[2:08:33] you may not think we know the day of the
[2:08:35] hour of his coming
[2:08:37] but I'm I'm one who does
[2:08:41] when this hour of his coming
[2:08:43] well let me tell you the Bible the hour
[2:08:45] you think not
[2:08:51] when you're least expecting it
[2:08:53] the change is coming
[2:08:57] when you when others have given up and
[2:09:00] scoffed
[2:09:01] the change is coming
[2:09:04] amen you said well brother Tim yard
[2:09:05] clueless no we're not we've already seen
[2:09:07] the sign amen the size of a man's hand
[2:09:11] we already know the atmosphere is
[2:09:13] changing we know already we keep feeling
[2:09:16] home in this world anymore we already
[2:09:18] know
[2:09:19] Sodom is increasing the fire is about to
[2:09:23] fall nuclear destruction relates
[2:09:26] they threaten it every day
[2:09:32] blessed is the one who remains awake
[2:09:35] or who watch us and keepeth His Garment
[2:09:38] lest he walk naked and they see his
[2:09:41] shame verse 16 and he gathered them all
[2:09:44] together to a place called in the Hebrew
[2:09:47] tongue Armageddon you see there is a
[2:09:51] gathering
[2:09:52] and right now Satan is gathered his
[2:09:55] forces
[2:09:57] right now people are it's in a choosing
[2:10:00] time this is the only time you can
[2:10:02] choose
[2:10:04] do you know even after the Rapture you
[2:10:07] will not be able to choose
[2:10:11] only right now is your only opportunity
[2:10:14] to choose
[2:10:16] today is the day of salvation to wait
[2:10:19] until then it's going to be too late
[2:10:25] the Bible said that he that is filthy
[2:10:28] will be filthy still he that is Holy
[2:10:30] will be holy still there'll be no change
[2:10:35] and so only right now is the only
[2:10:37] opportunity you have it all to make
[2:10:40] preparations for the going to be ready
[2:10:42] to be watching and he's going to come to
[2:10:46] those who love his appearing
[2:10:48] and there's got to be a people who love
[2:10:50] is coming
[2:10:52] and I don't just mean out there but even
[2:10:54] as coming to church that welcome his
[2:10:57] appearance they welcome him in the song
[2:10:59] they welcome into the preaching that
[2:11:02] welcoming in their worship
[2:11:04] you say what are these people shouting
[2:11:06] about brother Tim they are welcoming him
[2:11:09] they love him he appears
[2:11:19] so he gathered them to a place
[2:11:21] called Armageddon
[2:11:23] you are either being gathered for one
[2:11:26] war one side of the war or the other
[2:11:28] side
[2:11:30] brother Branham would tell us even the
[2:11:32] rock and roll music of Pat Boone and
[2:11:34] some of these Elvis Presleys and others
[2:11:36] he said they're actually Gathering
[2:11:37] people to Armageddon
[2:11:41] you're being gathered in your worship
[2:11:47] you see the Gathering you see people are
[2:11:49] taking their sides now
[2:11:51] you today are taking your sides now
[2:11:54] you're making your choice now
[2:11:59] you're preparing now absolutely you're
[2:12:01] making preparations to go into Rapture
[2:12:03] or to miss the rapture
[2:12:06] to be honest with you you know to be
[2:12:09] lost you have to really work hard at it
[2:12:12] because God's done everything in the
[2:12:14] wood that he could do to save you
[2:12:17] and you have to walk over every promise
[2:12:19] of God to be lost you have to fight your
[2:12:22] way to hell
[2:12:30] you say well I believe brother Tim I
[2:12:32] believe the message where's the
[2:12:34] commitment
[2:12:37] where is the life that is dedicated a
[2:12:40] consecration
[2:12:42] of surrenderings and obedience
[2:12:46] where is that that calls you to prayer
[2:12:49] that calls you to walk with God
[2:12:51] where is it that he works with you in
[2:12:53] spiritual ways in spiritual dreams and
[2:12:56] visions and anointings of the holy
[2:12:58] spirit so well that's passed by the Tim
[2:13:01] you're making a decision
[2:13:03] and your decision is to believe in a god
[2:13:06] of the past rather than the god of the
[2:13:08] present and you're being gathered to
[2:13:10] Armageddon
[2:13:12] but God has gathered the people to his
[2:13:14] word and his word has power in it it
[2:13:18] sets the captive free it opens the eyes
[2:13:20] of the blind it anoints men and women it
[2:13:23] sets them forward it puts a fire in
[2:13:25] their life
[2:13:27] it gives them a passion for truth
[2:13:32] he gathered him into a place called in
[2:13:34] the Hebrew tongue Armageddon and you can
[2:13:36] see people being gathered
[2:13:39] people taking their side
[2:13:41] and the seventh angel
[2:13:43] poured out his Bowlers vial into the air
[2:13:46] into the atmosphere
[2:13:49] and there as he did
[2:13:51] there came a voice how the temple great
[2:13:53] voice of the Temple of Heaven saying it
[2:13:56] is done
[2:13:58] the plants have been poured out
[2:14:00] the judgment is finished the Fate is
[2:14:02] sealed
[2:14:04] and there were voices and Thunders and
[2:14:06] Lightnings and there was a great
[2:14:07] earthquake such as not since men were
[2:14:10] upon the Earth some might be an
[2:14:11] earthquake and so great and the great
[2:14:13] city was divided into three parts and
[2:14:15] the cities of the Nations fell and great
[2:14:17] Babylon came and remembers before God
[2:14:20] God don't forget that
[2:14:25] he's going to give her the cup of the
[2:14:27] wine of the fierceness of his Wrath and
[2:14:29] every island fled away in the mountains
[2:14:31] were not found and their fallible men of
[2:14:34] great hell out of Heaven every stone
[2:14:36] about the weight of a talent and Men
[2:14:38] blasphemed God because of the palate the
[2:14:41] plague of a great hell this hail Stones
[2:14:43] weighing a hundred pounds right about a
[2:14:46] hundred pounds apiece
[2:14:48] coming down out of the heavens because
[2:14:51] God will judge the great and he
[2:14:55] will do exactly like he did in the Old
[2:14:57] Testament when he spelled them with
[2:14:59] stones he was Stone them with hailstones
[2:15:02] because the rejection of his word it's a
[2:15:06] serious hand thing to fall in the hands
[2:15:08] of an Angry God
[2:15:14] the Bible tells you
[2:15:16] that Rome will burn in an hour
[2:15:21] there's a lot of this that we could go
[2:15:23] on
[2:15:24] but I want you to go with me to
[2:15:25] Revelation 18 because it's part of the
[2:15:28] scriptures for our age
[2:15:30] it's part of the Prophecies of the end
[2:15:32] time
[2:15:33] Revelation 18 and I heard another voice
[2:15:35] from Heaven saying come out of there my
[2:15:37] people
[2:15:39] that's why we're here today
[2:15:42] amen that's why we're here yes we came
[2:15:45] out we met in Little Homes amen we found
[2:15:47] little places like they do in Japan now
[2:15:50] we we we we we went through our home
[2:15:53] meetings we went into our old abandoned
[2:15:55] churches and man fixed them up and and
[2:15:58] made them word that we could try to meet
[2:16:00] there and we built buildings we won the
[2:16:02] place where the word of God could be
[2:16:04] preached
[2:16:06] and men like to choose when they left
[2:16:08] out of Europe and was going into Israel
[2:16:10] they wanted a Homeland well what they
[2:16:13] believed would be appreciated and loved
[2:16:15] and they could have freedom to believe
[2:16:17] that
[2:16:19] we wanted that freedom
[2:16:22] and the Bible said come out of her my
[2:16:24] people
[2:16:26] we obeyed that call
[2:16:28] that's why we're here today
[2:16:30] why that you don't be partakers of her
[2:16:32] sins and receive not of her plagues
[2:16:35] that's why we come out
[2:16:37] because the plagues that is coming upon
[2:16:40] them are not for us
[2:16:42] I want you to understand God is going to
[2:16:45] get you out of here
[2:16:46] before the pledge fall
[2:16:49] the fire is going to fall but I'm going
[2:16:51] to take a Rapture I'm going to have a
[2:16:52] people
[2:16:53] amen that are prepared that are ready
[2:16:55] that are watching
[2:16:59] they're not the people of neglect
[2:17:02] they're not a people who who are
[2:17:04] scoffing young finding fault oh this
[2:17:07] ain't right that ain't right and I can't
[2:17:09] find anywhere to go to church but you
[2:17:12] know that that even more that you see
[2:17:14] that day approaching
[2:17:16] is somebody with me now you're sipping
[2:17:19] together you're encouraging and edifying
[2:17:22] others you're teaching your children but
[2:17:25] God first
[2:17:27] have a priorities right amen we're we're
[2:17:30] not in this world we're not like the
[2:17:32] Heathen out there we go and worship God
[2:17:35] we've come to the house of God we
[2:17:37] worship him when we come we don't sit in
[2:17:40] our Pew and draw on paper we get in
[2:17:42] there and we clap our hands we raise our
[2:17:44] hands and worship we participate
[2:17:49] foreign
[2:17:55] my people
[2:17:57] we're not the receiver of our Plex
[2:18:00] for your sins
[2:18:02] have reached into heaven
[2:18:04] and God hath to remembered
[2:18:07] oh God
[2:18:09] I'm so glad that our sins and our
[2:18:11] iniquities he remembers no more
[2:18:16] but if there's no repentance
[2:18:18] if there's no and your repentance is not
[2:18:21] a turning from
[2:18:23] then he will remember your iniquities
[2:18:28] rewarder even if she rewarded you and
[2:18:31] doubled to her double according to works
[2:18:33] I'm not just going to pair back I'm
[2:18:37] gonna double up on it
[2:18:39] Amen in the cup which she is filled
[2:18:42] filled her double
[2:18:44] how much is glorified herself and lived
[2:18:47] luxuriously and deliciously in so much
[2:18:49] torment and sorrow Giver
[2:18:51] for she said in the heart I sit as a
[2:18:53] queen and I am no Widow and shall see no
[2:18:56] sorrow therefore her plague shall come
[2:18:58] in one day
[2:19:00] deaths and mourning and famine and she
[2:19:02] saw her utterly burned with fire for
[2:19:05] strong is the Lord who judges her
[2:19:08] and the kings of the earth who committed
[2:19:10] fornication who lived luxuriously
[2:19:12] deliciously with her shall be well or
[2:19:15] lament for her when they shall see the
[2:19:17] smoke of her burning standing afar off
[2:19:19] for the fear of her torment and saith
[2:19:22] alasis last that great City Babylon that
[2:19:25] Mighty City for one hour is our judgment
[2:19:28] come
[2:19:29] think about it
[2:19:31] one hour she comes to waste
[2:19:35] one hour is over with
[2:19:37] one hour
[2:19:40] just think about that brother Brandon
[2:19:43] would preach sermons like from that time
[2:19:44] on
[2:19:46] he says from from that from from today
[2:19:48] in five years you could be you could be
[2:19:52] cleaning the spit Tunes in the inner in
[2:19:55] a a in a in a saloon
[2:19:59] five years from today you could be a
[2:20:01] drunk on the street five years today
[2:20:04] your marriage could be in shambles
[2:20:07] your home destroyed
[2:20:10] or five years today
[2:20:12] you could be a real Christian
[2:20:15] it all starts today
[2:20:18] but it's going to catch up with you
[2:20:20] whatever Choice you're making is going
[2:20:22] to catch up with you
[2:20:24] you've got to decide today because in
[2:20:27] one hour things can change
[2:20:30] it'll happen so quickly
[2:20:32] and the Bible says then the merchants of
[2:20:35] the Earth shall weep and mourn over for
[2:20:36] no man buy it for merchandise anymore
[2:20:38] the merchandise of gold and silver and
[2:20:40] precious stones and pearls and fine
[2:20:42] lemon and purple and silk and Scarlet
[2:20:44] and find wood and all minors or kinds of
[2:20:47] of vessels of Ivory and all kinds of
[2:20:51] manner of vessels and most precious wood
[2:20:53] and bronze and brass and and iron and
[2:20:56] marble and cinnamon and the incense and
[2:20:58] goes on and on and on and on you know
[2:21:00] listening and then verse 15 the
[2:21:03] merchants of these who have made Rich by
[2:21:05] her stand to far off for fear of her
[2:21:07] torment
[2:21:08] weeping and wailing saying the last alas
[2:21:11] that great city that was clothed in fine
[2:21:14] linen and purple and Scarlet and be
[2:21:16] decked and decked with gold and precious
[2:21:18] stones and pearls in one hour
[2:21:21] so great riches has come to nothing
[2:21:24] and every shipmaster in the company and
[2:21:26] the ships and the sailors and many in
[2:21:28] this trade by Seas to the far off and
[2:21:30] cried when the saw the smoke of a
[2:21:32] burning sand what city is like that
[2:21:34] great City
[2:21:36] and they cast dust on their Earth on
[2:21:38] their heads
[2:21:39] and who cried and weeping and wailing
[2:21:42] said alas alas that great City and which
[2:21:45] was made Rich all that had ships in the
[2:21:48] sea by reason or the costliness in one
[2:21:51] hour she's made desolate
[2:21:55] come Somebody's Crying over
[2:21:58] but I want you to notice the next verse
[2:22:00] says and rejoice over her
[2:22:04] thou heaven and ye Holy Apostles and
[2:22:08] Prophets for God has Avenged you on her
[2:22:12] God is going to pay back every room
[2:22:15] that's ever been done to you
[2:22:18] God remembers
[2:22:20] he's writing an account you don't have
[2:22:23] to do the paying back he said vengeance
[2:22:25] is mine I will repay yourself the Lord
[2:22:28] but I'll tell you what God's going to
[2:22:30] pay back
[2:22:31] he's not going to forget one thing
[2:22:33] that's been done against his bride
[2:22:38] his elect his people
[2:22:40] he's a Kinsman Avenger they're going to
[2:22:43] face the Wrath of the Lamb
[2:22:46] he says and the mighty Angel verse 21 a
[2:22:50] mighty Angel took a stone like a
[2:22:52] millstone great Millstone cast in the
[2:22:54] sea it's a dust with violence shall that
[2:22:57] great City Babylon be thrown down and
[2:22:59] shall be found no more at all and the
[2:23:01] voice of Harpers and minstrels musicians
[2:23:04] and the flute players of Pipers and the
[2:23:06] trumpeters shall be heard no more at all
[2:23:08] indeed and no Craftsmen or whatever
[2:23:10] craft he'd be so be found any more
[2:23:12] indeed and the sounds of a millstone
[2:23:14] shall be heard indeed no more and the
[2:23:16] light of the Lamb a candle shall light
[2:23:19] shine no more at all indeed and the
[2:23:21] voice of the Bride Drew and the voice of
[2:23:23] the Bride so be heard no more at all of
[2:23:25] the for thy Merchants were the Great Men
[2:23:27] of the Earth for by thy sorceries where
[2:23:30] all the nations deceived and then her
[2:23:32] was found all the blood of prophets and
[2:23:36] Saints and all that are slain upon the
[2:23:39] Earth
[2:23:40] and nobody
[2:23:41] fits that description like Rome does
[2:23:47] all the days of judgment
[2:23:49] are heaping up
[2:23:52] waiting for the bride of Christ to be
[2:23:54] raptured
[2:23:56] so that they can be poured out
[2:23:59] the scripture says concerning is coming
[2:24:01] he that letteth will land until he be
[2:24:04] taken away
[2:24:06] this Feats of the Holy Spirit and
[2:24:08] brother Branham attributed that to the
[2:24:10] holy spirit being on the bride when he
[2:24:12] ministered the seals
[2:24:14] so he says he that let us will let until
[2:24:17] she be taken out of the way
[2:24:19] because this is where that God is
[2:24:21] working and he's moving he's moving in a
[2:24:24] people and he's going to allow the
[2:24:26] mystery of iniquity to work until the
[2:24:29] bride is taken out of the way but one
[2:24:32] day he's going to take her out
[2:24:34] and when he does the man of sin will be
[2:24:37] revealed the man a position and that the
[2:24:40] Son of Perdition and there he will he
[2:24:43] will he will be as soon in Revelation
[2:24:45] 12. Satan will be cast down under the
[2:24:48] Earth and he will come down have a great
[2:24:51] Wrath
[2:24:54] because he has but a short time
[2:24:57] the devil don't have much longer
[2:25:00] I want to announce to you the devil is
[2:25:03] out of time
[2:25:09] Hallelujah the devil is out of time
[2:25:13] we've reached the hour where the delay
[2:25:16] is coming over
[2:25:18] the time even for your temptation is
[2:25:21] coming to an end
[2:25:23] the times of your trouble
[2:25:26] the time of the accuser of the brothers
[2:25:28] to accuse you his time of accusation is
[2:25:32] coming to an end
[2:25:33] in fact of the matter I want to just
[2:25:35] announce it's already over
[2:25:38] because God is set to a prophet you are
[2:25:41] the sinless ventures bright in Jesus
[2:25:44] Christ you never did it in the first
[2:25:46] place
[2:25:53] Hallelujah
[2:25:56] and the time of his accusation
[2:25:59] the time of the scoffing
[2:26:03] not over
[2:26:05] one day they'll scoff for the last time
[2:26:11] I think about this bride is very happy
[2:26:15] Rahab was a harlot
[2:26:18] Rahab was a gentile
[2:26:23] Rahab
[2:26:25] would be such a woman of faith
[2:26:28] she be wrote as a hero of faith
[2:26:31] God took a harlot and made a woman of
[2:26:33] Faith out of her
[2:26:35] that's the kind of Miracles my God does
[2:26:38] take a prostitute
[2:26:40] and he'll vain woman
[2:26:42] make her hero
[2:26:46] God can take a life of shambles and turn
[2:26:48] it around
[2:26:51] he can do that for you he can do that
[2:26:53] for your children
[2:26:56] he did this for Rahab
[2:27:01] he provided salvation for her and her
[2:27:03] house
[2:27:04] because she believed the report
[2:27:10] you know the city was trembling
[2:27:13] because the devil the devil's the demons
[2:27:16] there in that City they had heard what
[2:27:17] he'd done at the Red Sea and they knew
[2:27:20] it was true
[2:27:21] they'd heard how he defeated their
[2:27:23] enemies and they knew it was true they
[2:27:26] heard how he provided bread out of
[2:27:28] Heaven they knew it was true and they
[2:27:30] knew he could bring water from a rock
[2:27:33] and he just crossed him over Jordan in
[2:27:35] the flood stage
[2:27:37] and they said we've heard
[2:27:40] we've heard what your God did
[2:27:43] we've heard what kind of God
[2:27:45] I believe that I want that God
[2:27:48] save me don't let me and my family be
[2:27:51] lost
[2:27:56] and he says she saved and sent out to
[2:27:58] spies
[2:28:00] on the other side of her battle
[2:28:04] that day at the Battle of Jericho her
[2:28:06] family was saved her house was saved it
[2:28:08] was on the wall that was the only thing
[2:28:10] that didn't crumble
[2:28:13] because when you're when your house is
[2:28:16] built in faith it'll never fall down
[2:28:19] and here even when judgments was falling
[2:28:21] around and then and Joshua the Judgment
[2:28:24] Angel was coming into the city and going
[2:28:27] to Destroyer
[2:28:28] there was a remnant
[2:28:32] God always has a remnant
[2:28:34] and here in this moment
[2:28:36] in his time
[2:28:38] Here Comes Rahab
[2:28:41] there's a young man there by the name of
[2:28:44] Simone
[2:28:45] some might call it salmon salmon in the
[2:28:49] Bible
[2:28:50] just so I'm not calling him a fish
[2:28:53] so salmon you know he he falls in love
[2:28:56] with this Rahab
[2:28:59] and I can imagine the wedding ceremony
[2:29:01] coming on the standing before Joshua and
[2:29:03] the wedding suppers on and and and and
[2:29:06] and and the ceremonies going on is there
[2:29:09] any reason is there any impediment is
[2:29:12] there any reason why this woman
[2:29:14] shouldn't be married to this man
[2:29:17] somebody comes up yep
[2:29:22] if he was a harlot
[2:29:25] yep
[2:29:27] she had a dirty life
[2:29:29] yep she's not worthy
[2:29:33] yep she getting married be married into
[2:29:35] the tribe but Judah don't you know
[2:29:37] through that seed line will come Christ
[2:29:38] and she'll be the mother of the Messiah
[2:29:42] see not worthy to be that
[2:29:47] and Joshua would turn around and look he
[2:29:50] said woman
[2:29:51] where are your accusers
[2:29:55] [Applause]
[2:29:57] bring the Accuser
[2:30:00] bring them out bring those men that
[2:30:02] slept with you bring all of that that
[2:30:04] was of your past bring all that evil now
[2:30:07] bring them up and let us see you let's
[2:30:09] examine that they're all dead
[2:30:17] Hallelujah what's it going to be that
[2:30:19] day
[2:30:21] whenever one of your enemy is dead they
[2:30:24] don't let people that bothered you that
[2:30:26] oh that old drug problem that you have
[2:30:28] got a wife or whatever it was your past
[2:30:31] is all gone

[2:30:48] and I'm talking about
[2:30:50] surprise I'm talking about don't get
[2:30:52] there to be delayed those that be hold
[2:30:54] backs
[2:30:56] I'm gonna come seeing that it's ever
[2:30:58] going to come to pass that with patience
[2:31:00] hold and wait on the promise
[2:31:03] let's bring the musicians right now
[2:31:13] when the promise is delayed
[2:31:16] sometimes
[2:31:18] it looks like it's a far off
[2:31:22] but I want to tell you it's nearer now
[2:31:23] than when we first believed
[2:31:27] say brother Tim you preach that come to
[2:31:29] the Lord since you was a boy

[2:32:07] don't you want to press forward what
[2:32:09] others can take hope
[2:32:12] because you didn't give up
[2:32:15] I want you to Bow your heads just a
[2:32:17] moment
[2:32:19] part of the end time is scoffers will be

[2:33:05] I want to repeat back to you suddenly
[2:33:08] you just grinding right along just slow
[2:33:11] but sure
[2:33:13] maybe you prayed the six times and
[2:33:15] nothing's happened
[2:33:18] but suddenly it's about to change
[2:33:24] suddenly things are about to be
[2:33:25] different
[2:33:30] suddenly God's going to promote you
[2:33:34] bring you into a greater area of your
[2:33:36] life than you've ever been
[2:33:39] and you look back at the trials that
[2:33:40] you've been through and say this
[2:33:42] prepared me for the throne
[2:33:45] suddenly
[2:33:47] he will come on the wings of a morning
[2:33:53] suddenly he'll rise
[2:33:56] as the sun pops up
[2:34:00] and breaks over
[2:34:02] with this early morning Wings shining
[2:34:05] over the Earth
[2:34:07] you'll see the sun rise
[2:34:10] into a glorious day
[2:34:16] some golden Daybreak Jesus Will Come
[2:34:21] are you doing your part
[2:34:24] are we waiting on you
[2:34:27] are you dragging your feet
[2:34:30] are you holding the church back well
[2:34:32] I'll just quit by the Tim although I
[2:34:34] just won't go to church there if I'm
[2:34:36] holding y'all back I'll just no
[2:34:38] if you're a part
[2:34:40] you can't quit you can't leave
[2:34:43] you got to get in step
[2:34:49] wherever you are in your walk
[2:34:54] Wherever You Are
[2:34:56] don't let it become
[2:34:59] or that when God himself stands in front
[2:35:02] of you like Sarah and she laughs
[2:35:05] can't believe that
[2:35:07] I'm too old
[2:35:08] could never happen to me God
[2:35:11] I'm past my time it's over with for me
[2:35:20] you don't have to be that way with you
[2:35:23] but if you are Sarah
[2:35:26] if you are that way
[2:35:28] he's passing by this moment
[2:35:31] he's coming by your way
[2:35:33] he's standing at your tent door
[2:35:36] and say though the promise has been
[2:35:38] delayed
[2:35:40] the vision is tarried yet it's going to
[2:35:43] come to pass
[2:35:45] Lord help me to believe
[2:35:48] and forgive me of my unbelief
[2:35:50] would there be those in this service
[2:35:52] today that would raise a hand toward God
[2:35:54] and say Lord forgive me
[2:35:56] I've got a little cold I've got a little
[2:35:58] bit of doubting I've had a lot of fears
[2:36:00] I've had some unbelief there that
[2:36:03] slipped in
[2:36:04] I I
[2:36:06] I'm taking the wrong side even sometimes
[2:36:10] I've been a scoffer and a doubter but
[2:36:12] today I want my house in order
[2:36:15] today I want things that are wrong right
[2:36:17] in my life
[2:36:19] I want to come with a new consecration
[2:36:21] I've seen the promise delayed but I
[2:36:24] remember
[2:36:25] you remember
[2:36:27] I've been reminded that you're a God
[2:36:29] that don't forget
[2:36:30] you're a God that pays back our enemies
[2:36:33] your God that remembers our labors
[2:36:37] your God that remembers
[2:36:39] that commitment we made to him when we
[2:36:42] accepted him as our Lord and savior and
[2:36:45] he's not given up on us
[2:36:47] he's not given up on you this morning
[2:36:50] he's a God that won't give up
[2:36:53] but all I stand at the door knock
[2:36:55] If any man will open the door
[2:36:58] you see it lays within your power
[2:37:01] to open the doors he knocks
[2:37:06] why don't you just ask him Lord reveal
[2:37:08] yourself to me in a greater way
[2:37:10] I've got a little backslid and a little
[2:37:12] cold in my life I I'm just not fervent
[2:37:16] I've become a little bit lukewarm Lord
[2:37:19] I've let people hurt me I've let things
[2:37:22] set to be said to me that I took
[2:37:23] personal and but Lord you never said
[2:37:26] those things people hurt me preachers
[2:37:28] hurt me friends hurt me but you Lord
[2:37:32] you said I'll never leave you or forsake

[2:41:17] maybe it looks like you've taken the
[2:41:20] long way
[2:41:22] should have got to the promised land a
[2:41:24] long time ago
[2:41:26] but God's had to lead you through Red
[2:41:28] Seas
[2:41:29] so that you could see his power
[2:41:33] God had to lead you to desert places
[2:41:36] we could show you his provider
[2:41:40] he had to show you
[2:41:42] third make you thirsty so you'd call out
[2:41:45] for his water
[2:41:47] that only he can give
[2:41:50] he's not allow you to go through Dark
[2:41:52] Places
[2:41:54] to bring you out in the light
[2:41:57] but I've got an announcement
[2:42:00] the delay doesn't last forever

[2:42:23] day after delaying for thousands of
[2:42:25] years and now the seven Thunders have
[2:42:27] uttered their voices and we have heard
[2:42:29] now what was once mystery not revealed

[2:43:08] today how long would he's praying we all
[2:43:10] stumble with unbelief
[2:43:12] stagger at the promise of God
[2:43:14] and we have to say Lord

[2:47:12] if I'm Lord Jesus come
[2:47:18] you know he's talking about the vials
[2:47:20] being poured out of judgments
[2:47:24] but when I think about this song we're
[2:47:26] singing today come Lord Jesus come
[2:47:30] the last Prayer in the Bible
[2:47:33] is still a prayer
[2:47:35] waiting to be answered
[2:47:38] and that was the prayer of John that
[2:47:40] said
[2:47:43] even so
[2:47:46] come Lord Jesus come
[2:47:49] [Music]
[2:47:52] do you know if that's the last prayer of
[2:47:54] our book The Book of Revelation
[2:47:57] that's got to be the prayer of our hour
[2:48:00] there's got to be gotta be people that
[2:48:02] are praying that same thing saying oh
[2:48:04] God
[2:48:05] [Music]
[2:48:07] leave me here
[2:48:09] amen I don't want to be left behind the
[2:48:12] judgments coming on this world troubles
[2:48:15] us it's keeping up wrath in the Nations
[2:48:17] trouble the Brewing everywhere storm
[2:48:20] clouds everywhere but come
[2:48:24] Lord Jesus come
[2:48:26] you know when the last seal is was
[2:48:29] opened it opened up the silence
[2:48:32] [Music]
[2:48:34] and in that time what the opening up of
[2:48:36] the silence
[2:48:38] there were prayers that were mixed with
[2:48:40] much incense
[2:48:42] which are the prayers of the Saints
[2:48:45] and they ascended it before God
[2:48:49] and then things began to happen on Earth
[2:48:51] of thunder lightning
[2:48:54] and earthquakes
[2:48:57] [Music]
[2:49:00] and when I think of that I think of one
[2:49:02] prayer
[2:49:04] a prayer that's been
[2:49:06] [Music]
[2:49:07] just like
[2:49:09] biles and judgments that have been
[2:49:11] stored up waiting for the bride to leave
[2:49:15] but there are prayers that were stored
[2:49:17] up the Bible said they were there was a
[2:49:20] bowl of prayers or vial a prayer a
[2:49:22] vessel of prayers
[2:49:25] and these prayers were taken and mixed
[2:49:27] with much incense
[2:49:29] and they ascended to God
[2:49:31] and when he heard them
[2:49:33] and received them he began to do things
[2:49:36] on the Earth
[2:49:38] and there's one prayer
[2:49:42] that I know he stored up
[2:49:44] [Music]
[2:49:46] even so
[2:49:48] come Lord Jesus come
[2:49:50] can't you imagine the Saints down to the
[2:49:53] ages John said it come Lord Jesus come
[2:49:58] I mean you said it come at my age Lord
[2:50:01] Paul said we wish our lives and remain
[2:50:06] Luther said surely he's coming to my age
[2:50:09] it's my prayer Lord come for the
[2:50:11] lutherans Wesleyan said his Sanctified
[2:50:14] us come Lord we're a holy people unto
[2:50:17] you the Pentecostal set in Azusa Street
[2:50:20] you poured out gifts surely it's your
[2:50:23] coming
[2:50:24] thank you
[2:50:26] but God had to wait until sin and a
[2:50:28] prophet in this day to turn our hearts
[2:50:30] back to the original faith
[2:50:33] to turn our hearts back to the word
[2:50:35] again but it's the hour and the time
[2:50:38] where those prayers are to be mixed
[2:50:40] within sense
[2:50:41] and here we are in the coming of the
[2:50:44] Lord
[2:50:45] as he brings about his coming and here
[2:50:49] how did he come in his first time
[2:50:51] his first coming was with John the
[2:50:54] Baptist before he comes as a messiah he
[2:50:57] came with a messenger to prepare the way
[2:51:00] and here he comes and bright for him in
[2:51:02] this day and before he does he sends
[2:51:05] Elijah the prophet I want you to know we
[2:51:08] are here in the very cycle of his coming
[2:51:10] and those prayers are being answered and
[2:51:13] things are happening right now on the
[2:51:15] earth to pray about the coming of the
[2:51:17] Lord and it only be our prayer today
[2:51:19] Lord let me help make it come soon amen
[2:51:23] take out the innards of my life even so
[2:51:26] come Lord Jesus come even so
