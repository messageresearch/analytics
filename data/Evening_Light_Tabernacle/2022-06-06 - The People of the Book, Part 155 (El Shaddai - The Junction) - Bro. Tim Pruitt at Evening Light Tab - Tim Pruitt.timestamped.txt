[1:05:23] working through us amen i love the young
[1:05:26] people's song a while ago thank you very
[1:05:28] much that blessed my heart i got my mind
[1:05:31] made up
[1:05:33] amen i'm not going to turn around i'm
[1:05:35] not going to turn back
[1:05:37] amen but we
[1:05:38] we certainly want to see him that's what
[1:05:41] we want to see and even
[1:05:43] in this service today we want to see
[1:05:45] jesus
[1:05:46] seen a lot of man shown through the ages
[1:05:49] but we want to see jesus we want him
[1:05:51] manifest here among us
[1:05:54] amen so if you'll turn with me to
[1:05:56] genesis 17
[1:05:58] i'm going to read from there again this
[1:06:00] morning
[1:06:01] um there's a still a lot in the
[1:06:04] scripture that i want to bring out
[1:06:06] genesis 17 verse 1
[1:06:09] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[1:06:11] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[1:06:13] him i am the almighty god walk before me
[1:06:16] and be thou perfect
[1:06:18] and i will make my covenant between me
[1:06:21] and thee and i will multiply thee
[1:06:23] exceedingly and abram fell on his face
[1:06:26] and god talked with him saying then down
[1:06:28] verse 21 but my covenant will i
[1:06:30] establish with isaac which sarah shall
[1:06:33] bear unto thee at this set time in the
[1:06:35] next year
[1:06:36] and he left off talking with him and god
[1:06:38] went up from abraham
[1:06:41] amen going to let you be seated
[1:06:43] we want to welcome each one of you today
[1:06:46] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:06:48] amen it's good to have you sister
[1:06:50] melanie all the way from australia
[1:06:52] taliyah all of the the children there
[1:06:55] each one that is here with us we're just
[1:06:58] happy to have you the davis family we
[1:07:00] hadn't have you and privileged to have
[1:07:02] you in a little while so good to see you
[1:07:04] today amen i was thinking about you
[1:07:06] yesterday again
[1:07:08] and uh each one of you as we
[1:07:11] anticipated for this service today i
[1:07:14] believe the lord has something special
[1:07:15] for us
[1:07:17] we're in special time in a special hour
[1:07:20] we're special people
[1:07:22] called for a purpose
[1:07:24] uh i just um you know was uh come across
[1:07:27] a couple of things as i listened to
[1:07:30] tapes this week and
[1:07:31] and uh you know it really not
[1:07:34] particularly for
[1:07:36] my
[1:07:36] study just for my own edification
[1:07:39] and um i heard brother branham say these
[1:07:42] words god doesn't promise a flower bed
[1:07:44] of eden
[1:07:46] don't falsify a christian and don't
[1:07:48] falsify the message
[1:07:50] by telling that everything's going to be
[1:07:52] all right that there's nothing going to
[1:07:54] harm you there's nothing there ain't no
[1:07:56] trials no nothing that's wrong as a
[1:07:59] point said must i be carried to home to
[1:08:01] heaven on a flower bed of ease while
[1:08:03] others fought to win the prize and
[1:08:06] sailed through bloody seas no sir
[1:08:09] god doesn't promise ease and prosperity
[1:08:12] but he promises grace
[1:08:14] to endure in every hard trial and it's
[1:08:17] that grace we look to
[1:08:20] amen so god doesn't say everything's
[1:08:22] always going to go right and you'll
[1:08:24] never have any troubles and
[1:08:26] there won't be um reoccurring heartaches
[1:08:29] or heartaches that never happened before
[1:08:32] god doesn't say that life is full of
[1:08:34] trouble
[1:08:35] we are here as mortals
[1:08:37] and god doesn't even intend us to live
[1:08:40] here forever in these mortal bodies
[1:08:43] amen he put a time limit on them amen he
[1:08:46] doesn't want us to be here beyond a
[1:08:48] certain set time of suffering and god
[1:08:51] knows exactly
[1:08:52] what we all must endure and one by one
[1:08:56] will be taken off the board as it was
[1:08:58] and set aside
[1:09:00] into that heavenly kingdom graduated
[1:09:02] from here
[1:09:04] but we know this that while we're here
[1:09:06] we can look for his favor
[1:09:08] and his favor comes in many ways it
[1:09:11] brings healing it brings deliverance it
[1:09:13] brings salvation
[1:09:15] for our homes it brings peace it brings
[1:09:17] joy
[1:09:18] uh it brings satisfaction it brings all
[1:09:22] kinds of things but you know again a
[1:09:24] long life's journey we go through ups
[1:09:26] and downs and
[1:09:28] trials and curves and life's journey
[1:09:31] remember you know he didn't say that we
[1:09:33] wouldn't go through that he said yea
[1:09:35] though i walked to the valley of the
[1:09:37] shout of death
[1:09:38] thou art with me and your rod and your
[1:09:41] staff they comfort me they keep me in
[1:09:43] line and so we're we're looking to that
[1:09:46] today
[1:09:47] and um you know i i thought about it
[1:09:49] today as um i got word through email
[1:09:53] from sister melanie coming from all the
[1:09:55] way from australia you know australia is
[1:09:57] like japan and some of the new zealand
[1:10:00] some of the other they've been really
[1:10:01] shut down tight and not not able to get
[1:10:05] out of the country and people wasn't
[1:10:07] able to get in i just got word from
[1:10:09] sister
[1:10:10] ruth um over there
[1:10:12] uh in japan
[1:10:14] she's our translator there into the
[1:10:16] japanese language and she was
[1:10:18] telling me of another sermon that was
[1:10:20] just translated into the japanese
[1:10:23] language but she said we're just now
[1:10:25] opening up the doors
[1:10:27] you you know if you want to visit you
[1:10:30] you're required to have um three
[1:10:33] different shots
[1:10:35] of uh of inoculation from covid so you
[1:10:38] know one don't work and two don't work
[1:10:41] my boosters gotta you know work and you
[1:10:44] know so you know there's uh all kinds of
[1:10:46] restrictions lots of fear a lot of
[1:10:49] trouble in the world that we're in today
[1:10:51] but we know who holds tomorrow
[1:10:54] he's in uh we are in his hand
[1:10:56] now i've always told you as a church
[1:10:58] that we need to be like a big oak tree
[1:11:00] where that
[1:11:01] um
[1:11:02] ones could come god's children could
[1:11:05] come if they needed healing or
[1:11:06] deliverance of the holy ghost or
[1:11:09] whatever it is
[1:11:11] that we want to be like that where
[1:11:13] people can come and rest under our shade
[1:11:15] for a little while
[1:11:16] and receive um refreshing from the
[1:11:20] presence of the lord
[1:11:22] now that's why sister melanie is here
[1:11:24] she has a great need and just as soon as
[1:11:27] it opened up on the plane she got and
[1:11:30] she's traveled now all those hours
[1:11:32] getting in
[1:11:33] last night and and now in the service
[1:11:36] today
[1:11:37] and uh you say brother tim why why would
[1:11:40] you mention that well i i think about
[1:11:41] brother ron
[1:11:43] you know when um he was preaching some
[1:11:46] well it was in 2020 um seemed like it
[1:11:49] was the yeah 2020 in june
[1:11:52] there that he had just he was just so
[1:11:54] weak and he could not go any further and
[1:11:57] and uh you know it was just collapsing
[1:12:00] every day and ran out of energy we had
[1:12:04] visited him earlier
[1:12:06] and um you know i'd flown in there in
[1:12:10] february we were supposed to have gone
[1:12:12] to japan and we canceled the meetings
[1:12:15] there because the kobe did come and shut
[1:12:17] it down and people wouldn't get able to
[1:12:19] get off of ships and uh we were became
[1:12:22] concerned that we wouldn't be able to
[1:12:23] get back in the country or you know we'd
[1:12:26] get hung up somehow so we we canceled
[1:12:29] our trip to go into there
[1:12:31] uh in in japan instead i went to
[1:12:34] all the way over into
[1:12:36] virginia and
[1:12:39] karen and i went and prayed for brother
[1:12:41] ron spencer and when we prayed for him
[1:12:44] he'd been told he had cancer
[1:12:47] then and
[1:12:49] he he when he we prayed for him the fear
[1:12:52] left him all the fear all the anxiety
[1:12:55] every bit of it left
[1:12:57] that went with along with the cancer
[1:12:59] and and but now you know he was still
[1:13:02] left so weak that he could not function
[1:13:05] by the way
[1:13:06] he is preaching today brother ray
[1:13:08] erickson's up in ohio
[1:13:10] that's where he is he
[1:13:12] he's untowering in his in his drive to
[1:13:16] to preach the gospel to minister to
[1:13:19] those that are in need but anyway uh
[1:13:21] speaking of that i
[1:13:23] you know he he had spoke on a sunday it
[1:13:26] was in june
[1:13:27] and uh
[1:13:28] spoke on a um a on a sunday that
[1:13:33] that um

[1:13:36] drive 17 hours
[1:13:38] to get to brother branham and and the
[1:13:41] prayer line and be prayed for
[1:13:43] and that night in the middle of the
[1:13:46] night he began to think on what he
[1:13:47] preached and he said we're 17 hours
[1:13:50] and he he got to just put it together
[1:13:53] real quick and he said i'm going to

[1:14:01] with a brain bleed and was in the
[1:14:02] hospital and
[1:14:04] and was um
[1:14:05] you know

[1:16:05] prayer
[1:16:06] whatever he said i want you to pray
[1:16:08] right now
[1:16:09] we prayed with him and the holy spirit
[1:16:12] moved on his behalf
[1:16:14] and he went back to
[1:16:16] there to to virginia and he hasn't
[1:16:19] missed a day's work since
[1:16:23] working with his boys every day except
[1:16:26] for doctor's appointments that he had to
[1:16:27] go to other than that he hadn't missed a
[1:16:29] day because of being sick and too weak
[1:16:32] to go you see god
[1:16:34] he
[1:16:35] makes a way
[1:16:37] amen and sometimes when you don't feel
[1:16:39] like you've got anything to give or who
[1:16:41] am i or
[1:16:42] you know how can we have faith in this
[1:16:44] hour the word of god
[1:16:46] rises up within us and provides the
[1:16:49] grace for the time of need
[1:16:51] amen you know brother branham talked
[1:16:53] about this after all god did for abraham
[1:16:57] and showing him el shaddai and and
[1:17:00] bringing him through justification
[1:17:02] sanctification as it was to the baptism
[1:17:04] of the holy ghost and type
[1:17:06] and then
[1:17:07] and then he comes all the way got a 16
[1:17:10] year old boy think now trials are over
[1:17:13] and he says abraham i just want to see
[1:17:15] how much faith you really got i'm going
[1:17:16] to give you a back set in your divine
[1:17:19] healing see how far you trust me you
[1:17:22] know sometimes you have back sets did
[1:17:25] you ever know that i've had a lot of
[1:17:27] them
[1:17:28] yes i've been preaching the gospel for
[1:17:30] years and turned right around and i get
[1:17:33] so sick i don't know what to do
[1:17:34] sometimes but my anchor holds
[1:17:37] amen i just anchor it around calvary and
[1:17:41] say oh god i can't see calvaries the
[1:17:44] waves are so heavy you know imagine it
[1:17:47] like a boat going up and down and
[1:17:49] you lose a glimpse
[1:17:52] and he said you lose glimpse of calvary
[1:17:54] god i can't see calvary the waves are so
[1:17:56] heavy and my my people are all saying
[1:17:59] this the doctor says i can't live but
[1:18:02] something in here the lifeline
[1:18:05] is still holy
[1:18:07] amen that's the thing today is our
[1:18:10] lifeline is still holding
[1:18:12] and so therefore we look no matter
[1:18:14] whether there's ups and downs we know
[1:18:16] we're tied to a promise at calvary by my
[1:18:21] stripes you were healed
[1:18:23] amen how many feels like you're tied to
[1:18:26] that this morning well no matter whether
[1:18:28] your trials are coming your anchor holes
[1:18:32] to the promise of god
[1:18:34] amen questions comes problems comes
[1:18:37] doubts comes fears comes unbelief comes
[1:18:40] but our anchor holds we know in whom we
[1:18:44] have believe
[1:18:46] and we're persuaded he's able to keep
[1:18:48] that which we've committed to him
[1:18:50] against that day i want to turn to
[1:18:52] revelations 19 and i want to look at
[1:18:54] verse 6 because i'm not through with
[1:18:57] this scripture either
[1:18:58] and i heard as it were the voice of a
[1:19:01] great multitude and the voice of many
[1:19:04] waters and the voice of mighty thunder
[1:19:06] and saying
[1:19:07] hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent
[1:19:10] reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:19:14] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:19:15] the lamb has come
[1:19:17] and his wife has made herself ready and
[1:19:20] to her was granted that she should be
[1:19:22] arrayed and find linen clean and white
[1:19:25] for the final linen is the righteousness
[1:19:28] of the saints
[1:19:29] and he said unto me blessed are they
[1:19:31] that are called to the marriage supper
[1:19:33] of the lamb and he said unto me these
[1:19:35] are the true saiyans of god
[1:19:38] now last sunday i was speaking on
[1:19:40] abraham's voice today i'm going to speak
[1:19:43] on the junction
[1:19:45] because you know
[1:19:47] with abraham's voice as we talked about
[1:19:49] it was just it's a part of the great
[1:19:52] multitude
[1:19:53] it is the sound of many waters like
[1:19:56] thunderings
[1:19:57] that literally speak out of every
[1:19:59] scripture
[1:20:01] now abraham here was at a junction of
[1:20:03] time and it was that junction of time
[1:20:07] that there was a display of omnipotence
[1:20:12] you see things were not going to remain
[1:20:15] the same from here on out at
[1:20:17] disappearing of el shaddai
[1:20:20] things would never be the same that it
[1:20:23] was before
[1:20:24] ishmael the son of the bonds woman would
[1:20:27] no longer be thought of as the promised
[1:20:29] son
[1:20:30] uh
[1:20:31] you know the hagar the bomb's woman
[1:20:34] would no longer have her place as the
[1:20:36] mother of the promised son
[1:20:39] now they would be blessed and ishmael
[1:20:41] would become a great nation but they
[1:20:44] would no longer would he be thought of
[1:20:46] as abraham's heir
[1:20:49] and and neither would he be the one who
[1:20:52] the covenant of god was with god was
[1:20:54] making it plain i'm making my covenant
[1:20:57] with another
[1:20:59] and at this junction that we're in now
[1:21:02] god has rejected every denomination and
[1:21:05] has taken a bride without spotter
[1:21:08] wrinkle
[1:21:09] now that's not saying none of them will
[1:21:11] be saved they will be saved they'll go
[1:21:14] through tribulation but he's taken an
[1:21:16] elect people like he did with isaac and
[1:21:19] the church will go through the
[1:21:21] tribulation aren't you glad that there's
[1:21:24] more
[1:21:25] grace than what you ever realize
[1:21:27] amen i'm glad there was a grace for
[1:21:30] israel like that ishmael god would say i
[1:21:33] will bless him i'll make a great nation
[1:21:36] of him i'm not just rejecting him
[1:21:39] totally i'm not pushing him out i'm just
[1:21:41] telling you i'm making a covenant with
[1:21:44] another people and this people will come
[1:21:46] out of isaac and it's going to come out
[1:21:48] of the supernatural
[1:21:50] it won't be the bones woman producing
[1:21:53] this but it'll be the a child of the
[1:21:56] free and and he'll be a supernatural
[1:21:58] child because you will be dead in your
[1:22:01] body and sarah dead in her womb and you
[1:22:04] know you and it will take the miraculous
[1:22:07] it'll take the supernatural it'll take
[1:22:10] the omnipotence
[1:22:12] amen omnipotence will have to rain over
[1:22:14] your impotence and and omnipotence will
[1:22:17] have to reign over her bareness
[1:22:20] and i'll tell you we're in a day and
[1:22:22] hour where omnipotence must again rain
[1:22:28] amen where we can say the lord god
[1:22:30] omnipotent reigneth
[1:22:33] amen that he's reigning in his
[1:22:35] supernatural power
[1:22:37] now again the church will go through the
[1:22:40] tribulation and receive life at the
[1:22:42] white throne judgment and well but won't
[1:22:45] go in the rapture with the children of
[1:22:47] the free woman remember the the children
[1:22:51] of the bomb's woman is not heir with the
[1:22:53] children of the free woman
[1:22:55] is that right amen so brother branham
[1:22:58] would tell us he said you know
[1:23:00] denominations children of the bonds
[1:23:02] women won't be heir with the bride the
[1:23:04] bride are going to rapture the other
[1:23:05] will go through the tribulation
[1:23:08] there will be many of them that are
[1:23:09] given life at the white throne judgment
[1:23:13] now so you see god that's because god is
[1:23:16] rich in mercy
[1:23:18] somehow another people got confused
[1:23:20] because the lamb took the book and
[1:23:22] opened the seals but revelation would
[1:23:25] reveal it to a prophet that somehow
[1:23:27] mercy was over friend it's more mercy
[1:23:30] than you ever imagined
[1:23:32] it's more grace than you ever imagined
[1:23:35] and my grace would open by the opening
[1:23:38] of the seven seals which show there's a
[1:23:41] multitude without number
[1:23:43] given life there at the white throne
[1:23:45] judgment it led to living waters and god
[1:23:48] is caring for those people he loves them
[1:23:51] he wipes away their tears you know he is
[1:23:54] not willing that any should perish
[1:23:57] he would say even the cane you know
[1:23:59] don't you know if you'll do right don't
[1:24:01] you know if you'll come to abel's way
[1:24:04] don't you know if you'll bring a lamb
[1:24:06] just like he did
[1:24:08] that you two will be accepted
[1:24:11] now so but you see he saw the perfect
[1:24:14] will of god and refuse to come
[1:24:17] that way are you with me now so do you
[1:24:20] see that god is a god of mercy is a god
[1:24:23] of grace in fact of the matter is the
[1:24:26] rapture itself is one of the greatest
[1:24:29] outpouring of grace that there ever was
[1:24:31] it is grace that would catch us out of
[1:24:34] this evil age
[1:24:35] and and we will escape the things that
[1:24:37] are coming on the earth rather than
[1:24:39] having to go through them that is great
[1:24:41] abundant grace amen now there have been
[1:24:44] many junctions along the road brother
[1:24:47] branham would talk about five seven
[1:24:49] junctions of time and again he would
[1:24:51] preach on five junctions of time but
[1:24:54] there in fact has been many junctions of
[1:24:56] time and we're we are now at a junction
[1:25:01] and i i feel it more and more as i'm
[1:25:04] going on that we're we're in i can feel
[1:25:07] the whims of change
[1:25:11] hey man i we're in a season or a
[1:25:13] junction where where the the
[1:25:16] supernatural god is manifests himself in
[1:25:20] such a way bringing us to a junction a
[1:25:23] revealing of the omnipotence of god you
[1:25:27] know it'll take omnipotence to change
[1:25:30] your body
[1:25:31] you know it will take omnipotence to
[1:25:33] raise the dead in christ
[1:25:35] you know we are on the verge of the
[1:25:38] greatest omnipotence that there ever was
[1:25:41] the pouring out of the holy spirit and
[1:25:43] the finishing of his work do you know
[1:25:45] that
[1:25:46] amen this is where we're at we're at a
[1:25:49] junction
[1:25:52] now
[1:25:53] we're ordained to these junctions
[1:25:56] you see the very thing that you came for
[1:25:58] this tabernacle this morning the reason
[1:26:01] you drove all the way up from texas the
[1:26:03] way some of you came all the way up from
[1:26:05] over from australia to others that have
[1:26:08] driven in here from different other
[1:26:09] places some living close by and some you
[1:26:12] know far removed but nevertheless you
[1:26:15] are here for a purpose god foreknew it
[1:26:19] he ordered it
[1:26:20] amen that you can receive the very thing
[1:26:23] that you came for
[1:26:25] you may even not have known the need
[1:26:27] that you had in your life you didn't
[1:26:29] mean to cannot even put your finger on
[1:26:31] it maybe you're not even cognate of it
[1:26:34] but god knows that need
[1:26:36] and he is the one that has said you know
[1:26:39] that for new year you're coming and he
[1:26:41] said everything in order
[1:26:43] amen the only thing we've got to do is
[1:26:45] receive it
[1:26:47] and if i were you with this morning i
[1:26:49] would get in the receiving mode
[1:26:51] and my more god whatever you have for me
[1:26:55] i want it all
[1:26:57] i want to experience it all i i want to
[1:26:59] i want to have it within my life amen
[1:27:02] now you know again there's nothing there
[1:27:06] is nothing going to take that away from
[1:27:08] you it lays right before you
[1:27:10] now abraham was in this place of change
[1:27:13] too
[1:27:14] god was setting it all in order by his
[1:27:17] power
[1:27:18] with his supernatural visitation of the
[1:27:21] almighty
[1:27:22] god had promised him a case of divine
[1:27:25] healing
[1:27:26] you know that a man he had told him he
[1:27:28] would have a child at 75 years of age
[1:27:32] that was a promise of divine healing
[1:27:35] is that right amen god has promised us
[1:27:38] such case of divine healing too he
[1:27:41] promised to remove the stain of sin
[1:27:44] and the unbelief of the ages
[1:27:47] off of this bride even as he promised to
[1:27:50] heal sarah of the stain of age
[1:27:53] he promises to do it to extent that we
[1:27:56] will be at church without spot or
[1:27:59] wrinkle or blemish
[1:28:01] the healing he promises is so complete
[1:28:04] the bride will be without a blemish
[1:28:08] emma come on sarah
[1:28:10] amen here she was blemished here she was
[1:28:12] old here she was incapable here she was
[1:28:16] unable but let me tell you god made it
[1:28:19] so complete until she was so without
[1:28:22] blemish a young king would want her in
[1:28:25] his harem
[1:28:27] is somebody with me now
[1:28:29] amen uh you see again despite with me
[1:28:32] without blemish every wrinkle of false
[1:28:34] teaching
[1:28:37] oh my
[1:28:38] ever stained a false doctrine
[1:28:42] every stain of confusion of the past
[1:28:45] amen until that every wrinkle is gone
[1:28:49] every are you with me every blemish long
[1:28:53] to the extent she's a pride restored
[1:28:57] a restored people of restored pride
[1:29:02] those who died in the ages past this
[1:29:05] rest restoration will be so complete
[1:29:07] they will rise
[1:29:09] those of the living will be changed and
[1:29:12] all of us translated together
[1:29:16] it's not a wonderful moment
[1:29:18] we are here at a junction of time
[1:29:21] and to do this god must get our hearts
[1:29:24] to believing
[1:29:25] and it must not be just an external
[1:29:28] change but an internal change
[1:29:31] amen you know we look for the external
[1:29:33] oh i'll be black-headed again and i
[1:29:36] won't have any wrinkles and you know my
[1:29:38] sagging body will that's been pulled
[1:29:41] down by the gravity that back to the
[1:29:43] earth again you know it'll be strong and
[1:29:46] healthy there won't be any blemish but
[1:29:48] friends that's the outside what about
[1:29:50] the inside you see it must not be just
[1:29:53] an external change but an internal
[1:29:56] change and that means that people filled
[1:29:59] with god's ability to believe
[1:30:03] amen to believe for anything a people
[1:30:07] filled with the holy ghost
[1:30:09] a people empowered you see god likes to
[1:30:12] show his power
[1:30:13] not because he has to but he loves to do
[1:30:16] it it pleases him and his omnipotence to
[1:30:20] let his subjects know who he is
[1:30:23] he loves to let you know i'm the same
[1:30:25] yesterday today and forever i am the god
[1:30:28] and i change not amen i am your healer i
[1:30:32] am your savior i am your deliverer i am
[1:30:34] every god love so let us people know
[1:30:37] amen that i'm that he's real and it
[1:30:40] prepares our hearts it makes us ready it
[1:30:44] makes us brace up and ready to take a
[1:30:46] new hole
[1:30:49] amen here abraham was getting a new hold
[1:30:54] on things
[1:30:55] amen bracing up for something greater to
[1:30:58] come greater than what he'd ever
[1:31:00] imagined god doing
[1:31:04] now the people who don't believe in
[1:31:06] divine healings and performing the
[1:31:08] miracles it's no wonder our churches are
[1:31:10] dying
[1:31:12] amen it's no wonder they're withering
[1:31:13] away into bloodless cults
[1:31:17] amen because when you really get away
[1:31:19] from the blood that's the holy ghost
[1:31:21] then you quit seeing miracles you quit
[1:31:23] seeing signs and wonders what happened
[1:31:26] the workings of the holy spirit and it
[1:31:29] just turns us into a bloodless cult
[1:31:33] amen
[1:31:35] amen now
[1:31:36] think about this no wonder the social
[1:31:39] gospel
[1:31:40] is taken over today
[1:31:43] even what's left of religion is because
[1:31:46] our teachings have taken us away from
[1:31:48] the phenomena of god
[1:31:51] and god himself is a phenomenon
[1:31:54] you see again he is a creator he's
[1:31:57] jehovah
[1:31:58] he is the great reality he's the great
[1:32:00] substance of everything that was because
[1:32:04] it's all made by him
[1:32:06] now and he displays his power he shows
[1:32:10] his power on every day every day when
[1:32:12] the sun rises because god said let there
[1:32:15] be
[1:32:16] every time there's a rainbow is because
[1:32:19] god said i'll put it in the heavens
[1:32:21] every time that he does when he comes
[1:32:24] down to us his subject and he heals us
[1:32:26] of our diseases and saves us from our
[1:32:29] sins what is that is god displaying his
[1:32:33] power
[1:32:35] amen but we're at a junction
[1:32:37] and i want to talk about where we have
[1:32:39] come
[1:32:40] this age changed to a supernatural age
[1:32:44] things began to happen very very
[1:32:46] supernaturally when it began in 1906
[1:32:50] and it began with the pouring out of
[1:32:52] god's spirit and it will end with the
[1:32:55] pouring out of god's spirit
[1:32:57] now it wasn't that god didn't pour out
[1:32:59] his spirit of some in luther or wesley
[1:33:01] but this was a greater portion
[1:33:04] and again god is in this day pouring out
[1:33:08] emptying out finishing the work
[1:33:11] you see joel 2 28 has to be fully
[1:33:15] manifested acts chapter 2 has to be
[1:33:18] fully manifested the day of pentecost
[1:33:21] must fully come and we've come through
[1:33:25] seven ages
[1:33:27] amen we're since the passover we're here
[1:33:29] in time
[1:33:31] are you with me we're here right now in
[1:33:34] the season it's the junction
[1:33:36] of the chains it's the junction of the
[1:33:39] jubilee it's the junction of the
[1:33:42] liberation amen amen
[1:33:46] you see god would loose things within
[1:33:48] sarah's body
[1:33:50] that had never been loosed before
[1:33:53] god would lose something within abraham
[1:33:56] that had never been loosed before
[1:33:59] and god's about to lose something in
[1:34:01] this bride
[1:34:03] like you've never seen before
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:09] glory to god because you see at a
[1:34:11] junction like this he appears and when
[1:34:14] he appears he appears in omnipotence
[1:34:19] so that you can say the lord god
[1:34:22] omnipotent reigns
[1:34:25] now
[1:34:26] brother adam would talk about this
[1:34:28] in the world falling apart and he's let
[1:34:31] me just share this little quotation
[1:34:33] that's the hour that we're living oh god
[1:34:35] the world is falling apart
[1:34:38] have you ever seen such a time where the
[1:34:40] world has fallen apart
[1:34:42] families are falling apart
[1:34:46] countries are falling apart
[1:34:49] political promises are falling apart
[1:34:56] have we ever seen such a time there
[1:34:58] hangs and their hangers bombs their
[1:35:01] hangs the things that's to do just
[1:35:03] exactly
[1:35:05] and there again russia has already just
[1:35:08] announced we we have your number
[1:35:12] you know with one warhead we can wipe
[1:35:14] out the whole east coast
[1:35:17] of america and with another we will wipe
[1:35:19] out the second
[1:35:22] and we have allowed our politicians
[1:35:24] until our country has went to sleep
[1:35:29] paying on social programs such as
[1:35:31] abortion and murdering our kids
[1:35:34] rather than providing protection for our
[1:35:36] people
[1:35:38] are you with me
[1:35:40] amen so you again again the the bombs
[1:35:43] are in the hangar you say brother tim
[1:35:46] you know it's
[1:35:48] what about this junction well i'll tell
[1:35:49] you at this junction we're just exactly
[1:35:52] like noah was in that day he said it's
[1:35:55] going to come rain
[1:35:57] and it'll come from the skies but we are
[1:35:59] saying it's coming of fire
[1:36:01] and it's coming from the heavens
[1:36:04] amen and this world is going to birth
[1:36:07] into a new world and a millennium will
[1:36:09] come and we're right on the cusp of it
[1:36:12] [Applause]
[1:36:14] hallelujah we're at the junction of it
[1:36:25] but the church
[1:36:27] has made herself ready
[1:36:29] is that right
[1:36:31] that's the scripture
[1:36:33] it's in these moments that god prepares
[1:36:36] the people
[1:36:39] listen he had to send a message to
[1:36:41] prepare the hearts of people to turn
[1:36:43] their faith back to the faith of the
[1:36:45] fathers
[1:36:46] we couldn't go on in baptist methodism
[1:36:49] presbyterian and men's ideas come on
[1:36:52] we've had him for years he said brother
[1:36:53] until these are brother branham's idea
[1:36:55] these are not brother brown's ideas we
[1:36:58] believe the bible serpency comes from
[1:37:01] the bible predestination comes from the
[1:37:03] bible baptism in jesus name comes from
[1:37:06] the bible one god this is the one god
[1:37:09] bible
[1:37:10] [Applause]
[1:37:12] come on somebody
[1:37:14] amen these are not men's ideas this is
[1:37:17] god's idea it was not brother brandon's
[1:37:20] message it was god's message it's the
[1:37:24] message of jesus christ to the laodicea
[1:37:27] [Applause]
[1:37:35] people want to dismiss it i'll tell you
[1:37:38] what if you have problems with the
[1:37:40] message you don't have problems with
[1:37:41] brother branham you have problems with
[1:37:43] the angel
[1:37:45] amen that angel that stood on the
[1:37:48] platform by brother branham and night
[1:37:50] after night in service after service
[1:37:52] discern the thoughts and intents of
[1:37:54] heart and was never wrong
[1:37:56] amen
[1:37:58] amen
[1:38:01] never was there a gift in pentecost like
[1:38:04] it
[1:38:04] amen assumes the meeting could never
[1:38:07] produce it
[1:38:09] they never had it
[1:38:13] god did it to confirm a message
[1:38:16] and it was to prepare a people what good
[1:38:18] would it do to come
[1:38:20] if there's enough people prepared
[1:38:24] amen you know sometimes you know what if
[1:38:26] these others got to offer you anyway
[1:38:29] you know what what more what greater do
[1:38:31] they have to give you
[1:38:34] i see the effects a lot of times of
[1:38:36] what's being offered today so leave the
[1:38:39] message and go follow this well look at
[1:38:41] their children
[1:38:42] look at the offspring
[1:38:44] look at their families look at their
[1:38:47] unbelief it doesn't give them greater
[1:38:49] faith it doesn't produce the miraculous
[1:38:53] it don't produce the supernatural power
[1:38:55] of god that gets a soul down to the
[1:38:57] altar and surrenders to god it just
[1:39:00] simply confuses the mind
[1:39:03] a delusion
[1:39:08] the church is ready she's sealed in
[1:39:10] ready to come there be a great there'll
[1:39:13] be a big outpouring of the spirit yes
[1:39:15] sir to grab the church and take her into
[1:39:18] the sky exactly because the church the
[1:39:20] word the bride and christ and his
[1:39:22] ministry is in his bride which is body
[1:39:25] the supernatural body of his here the
[1:39:28] spiritual body on earth his spirit is in
[1:39:31] there living his life right out until
[1:39:34] him and the church becomes
[1:39:36] one in the wedding and they become one
[1:39:39] he takes them just from a little
[1:39:41] minority in this last day
[1:39:45] now we're not talking about that little
[1:39:47] minority being evening like tabernacle
[1:39:49] god's got a bride around the world
[1:39:52] but it's still a minority
[1:39:55] in fact of the matter is
[1:39:57] i just want to convey to you for a
[1:39:59] moment you are an endangered species
[1:40:07] you are an endangered people
[1:40:10] and if god didn't have a rapture plan
[1:40:12] for you
[1:40:13] you would be exterminated
[1:40:19] now it is that expectant outpouring of
[1:40:22] the quickening power that brings us to
[1:40:24] recognize our position and place and our
[1:40:27] responsibilities as a called people
[1:40:30] separated from the world and dedicated
[1:40:33] to god
[1:40:34] now
[1:40:35] another great junction in this age was
[1:40:39] when
[1:40:40] was made when the angel came to brother
[1:40:42] branham now you know we could go to a
[1:40:44] lot of junctions
[1:40:46] we could go back
[1:40:47] you know in the thousands of years
[1:40:49] before us we go to abraham or noah enoch
[1:40:53] each one of them were junctions
[1:40:55] they were in the old testament they were
[1:40:57] prophesying objections in the new
[1:41:00] testament
[1:41:01] we are still in the new testament
[1:41:04] we're under the new covenant we're new
[1:41:06] testament people
[1:41:08] we're walking in new testament promises
[1:41:11] we are fulfillment of the new testament
[1:41:15] are you with me amen so again we can go
[1:41:18] back and we can look and we can say
[1:41:20] luther that was a junction and wesley
[1:41:22] that was a junction of zoos tree that
[1:41:24] was a junction but i'm just talking
[1:41:26] about the junctions that we've had you
[1:41:30] know
[1:41:30] maybe sometimes there may not be major
[1:41:34] junctions as to the world but they're
[1:41:36] major to us
[1:41:39] you see another great junction was was
[1:41:42] made
[1:41:43] when an angel came to brother branham to
[1:41:46] start the divine healing movement
[1:41:50] now brother branham just you know made a
[1:41:52] claim
[1:41:54] that why was there such an uproar
[1:41:59] if he made a claim and nothing happened
[1:42:01] you know anybody can say i met with an
[1:42:03] angel there's still a lot of them
[1:42:05] there's would be prophets today that
[1:42:07] rise i'm a prophet i'm a minor prophet
[1:42:10] everybody couldn't listen to me
[1:42:12] you know again there's all kinds of
[1:42:15] things that that are are are there you
[1:42:18] know brother branham could have just
[1:42:21] made a claim oh i i met an angel but the
[1:42:23] reason why we know he met an angel was
[1:42:26] the angel was there
[1:42:29] the angel opened the eyes of the blind
[1:42:32] it caused the death to hear
[1:42:35] it caused the cripples to walk
[1:42:38] and man it discerned the thoughts and
[1:42:39] intents of heart
[1:42:41] are you with me so it was a great
[1:42:43] junction that would start the divine
[1:42:45] healing movement because god was
[1:42:48] displaying his omnipotence amen
[1:42:51] and he let us know in those times that
[1:42:54] no matter how crippled or twisted or
[1:42:57] marred whether you're a boy on a chain
[1:43:01] crippled down mental in your mind
[1:43:04] whether you're a hopeless case
[1:43:06] whether you've been laying there where
[1:43:08] you're 40 and 40 50 pounds like like for
[1:43:11] florence nightingale i will forget her
[1:43:13] last number name but anyway florence
[1:43:16] there she she was there laying in the
[1:43:19] bed and dying and she had a desperate
[1:43:22] need and she flew all the way from south
[1:43:25] africa if i could just get to england to
[1:43:27] see him brother brendan said i can't do
[1:43:30] anything maybe i can just offer a little
[1:43:32] prayer i don't have a vision i don't
[1:43:34] have a word from god i don't know what
[1:43:36] to do amen but as he's praying there a
[1:43:40] dove comes and lights down on the wind
[1:43:42] to seal and begins to cool
[1:43:45] and as it begins to go listen this was
[1:43:47] done this was done by
[1:43:49] in front of men this was no secret
[1:43:53] oh man and what happened there the voice
[1:43:55] of god spoke out of him the omnipotence
[1:43:58] was displaced
[1:44:00] and man he spoke healing over her body
[1:44:03] and she returned to a woman 160 pounds
[1:44:07] because why omnipotence spoke
[1:44:11] omnipotence was on display
[1:44:14] and god had brought the church to a
[1:44:16] junction where that you can believe for
[1:44:19] anything that you can say nothing is
[1:44:22] impossible
[1:44:26] amen
[1:44:29] another great junction
[1:44:31] was when seven angels came for the
[1:44:33] opening of the seven seals
[1:44:36] it brought to us an open book
[1:44:39] where no longer are we probing
[1:44:42] as others did in prior ages trying to
[1:44:44] pry and hear matthew henry pried tried
[1:44:48] to look and he guessed about this
[1:44:49] scripture and that
[1:44:51] but we're no longer guessing
[1:44:54] amen
[1:44:57] we're no longer wondering
[1:44:59] amen even you say well you know again
[1:45:02] brother tim that was brother branham and
[1:45:04] his idea and he was just plagiarizing
[1:45:07] and he was just making stuff up but
[1:45:09] about that time the angel came in the
[1:45:11] room
[1:45:13] and you'll not find what he taught in
[1:45:15] any book
[1:45:18] come on
[1:45:19] amen they usually have all the seven
[1:45:21] seals happening over in the tribulation
[1:45:25] and most every one of them do they don't
[1:45:27] see it starting back here as that line
[1:45:30] spirit
[1:45:31] impersonating christ back in the first
[1:45:34] age and when they see that horse as it
[1:45:36] begins to ride and then it rides into
[1:45:39] the red horse through with the millions
[1:45:41] that are killed 68 million and more
[1:45:44] plastic or killed bloodies that it's
[1:45:46] sword and bloodies the rider bloodies
[1:45:49] the horse
[1:45:51] then the dark ages
[1:45:54] then the pale horse
[1:45:56] which is where we
[1:45:58] are just about to fully morph into
[1:46:03] it's at the junction
[1:46:07] where satan will do his final ride and
[1:46:10] we done had a prophet come along and
[1:46:12] said i'll tell you what his name is
[1:46:14] death
[1:46:16] and that was not named till the eagle
[1:46:18] comes
[1:46:20] are you with me
[1:46:21] now you know some of that goes over your
[1:46:24] head maybe but you know it ought to if
[1:46:26] you just
[1:46:27] if i could just get you into the message
[1:46:29] you'd understand what i'm preaching
[1:46:31] about
[1:46:32] but you see this was what's
[1:46:35] was again
[1:46:36] the angels of god in the presence of
[1:46:39] that ball of fire
[1:46:43] no angels not winged theophanies
[1:46:48] but angels with wings
[1:46:51] which which signify symbolically moving
[1:46:56] and there are seven angels in the bible
[1:46:59] amen somebody help me preach
[1:47:01] seven angels there they're the seven
[1:47:04] spirits of god before the throne but you
[1:47:08] see god is in seven people
[1:47:11] and he's really not seven spirits but
[1:47:14] it's one spirit in seven different
[1:47:17] manifestations down through the ages
[1:47:20] are you with me and here in that room
[1:47:23] night after night the angel of god
[1:47:26] revealing a portion of the book
[1:47:28] amen
[1:47:30] to we are no longer in this junction of
[1:47:33] time we are no longer guessing at the
[1:47:37] contents
[1:47:41] we are not a church that is built like
[1:47:44] the church of christ on alexander's
[1:47:46] guesses alexander campbell his guesses
[1:47:51] are martin luther's guesses
[1:47:54] or wesley's guesses
[1:47:58] a man of presbyterian or catholic or
[1:48:01] whatever their guess is we're no longer
[1:48:03] guessing
[1:48:05] oh man it's we of just saith the lord
[1:48:09] amen
[1:48:10] why because the supernatural what's
[1:48:13] displayed
[1:48:16] omnipotent spoke yes
[1:48:22] hallelujah
[1:48:24] omnipotence spoke
[1:48:26] and when omnipotence spoke
[1:48:29] it got rid of all the other questions
[1:48:32] about it
[1:48:32] [Music]
[1:48:34] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:48:36] question
[1:48:38] he has been totally exposed
[1:48:41] from genesis to revelation
[1:48:44] about the man of sin has been revealed
[1:48:48] and we see him today at work
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:55] another great junction
[1:48:57] was when god took his prophet home
[1:49:01] well brother tim i don't like to talk
[1:49:03] about that one well
[1:49:08] it had to happen
[1:49:13] just as jesus said i must go away
[1:49:16] if jesus had not went away
[1:49:19] he said the comforter can't come
[1:49:22] if i don't leave you i can't send the
[1:49:24] holy ghost the spirit that's in me to
[1:49:26] come dwell in you it's just that simple
[1:49:30] and if god had not taken brother branham
[1:49:32] you know
[1:49:33] where would we have been for the last 56
[1:49:36] years
[1:49:37] following him around from eating the
[1:49:38] meat and there wouldn't be an evening
[1:49:39] like tabernacle
[1:49:41] there wouldn't be a mission work in
[1:49:42] japan
[1:49:43] there wouldn't be works in africa
[1:49:48] come on
[1:49:49] amen but god had a plan
[1:49:52] the devil couldn't take him
[1:49:56] you know we look at sometimes that death
[1:49:59] is a very difficult and hard thing it is
[1:50:01] on our side
[1:50:03] and we look at brother branham you know
[1:50:04] even going by the way of a car wreck and
[1:50:07] and why did he have to die like that
[1:50:11] god don't really care how we die
[1:50:15] some died by fire some died by stripes
[1:50:18] some died by imprisonment some died by
[1:50:21] starvation some died by look at the
[1:50:24] bible
[1:50:28] god really doesn't he's not concerned
[1:50:30] about how you exit here
[1:50:33] he's concerned about your entrance there
[1:50:37] [Applause]
[1:50:39] well what about your wife brother tim
[1:50:41] when when she died why did she have to
[1:50:44] die that way you know why did god do it
[1:50:46] god didn't do that
[1:50:48] god was there to receive her
[1:50:53] he was there to take her out of the pest
[1:50:56] house
[1:50:57] to heal or complete
[1:50:59] to bring a real deliverance
[1:51:01] god rescued her
[1:51:03] [Applause]
[1:51:04] my wife has been rescued
[1:51:08] and the old simple zion comes to her
[1:51:11] took her on the other side and she lives
[1:51:14] she's not dead she lives
[1:51:22] and that was brother branham
[1:51:25] john the baptist got his head cut off
[1:51:28] at a woman's dance
[1:51:31] horrible thing
[1:51:32] why why would god let that happen to the
[1:51:35] greatest prophet who would introduce the
[1:51:37] messiah
[1:51:39] he had to decrease
[1:51:42] so jesus could increase
[1:51:45] look even over in acts 19
[1:51:48] way over now many years past here's
[1:51:51] still followers of john
[1:51:53] they ain't even been baptized they don't
[1:51:55] even know about the holy ghost the holy
[1:51:57] ghost to come they don't even know it
[1:51:59] happened they've been so caught up being
[1:52:01] followers of john
[1:52:04] you know why they had made a personality
[1:52:06] cult out of it
[1:52:11] and they failed to see who he pointed to
[1:52:15] and i want you to understand you know it
[1:52:17] had to happen it had to come to this
[1:52:19] this junction had to take place god had
[1:52:22] to take his prophet off the scene why so
[1:52:25] the spirit of god not brother branham
[1:52:27] spirit the spirit of god could be poured
[1:52:29] out upon a multi-membered
[1:52:32] body
[1:52:34] amen because there were more voices of
[1:52:37] god to speak
[1:52:41] god had to speak through you through me
[1:52:43] to the life of young people amen to the
[1:52:46] old to whoever god he speaks
[1:52:53] we didn't want him to go
[1:52:55] we clung to him
[1:52:57] we walked around in confusion for for a
[1:53:00] number of years you know why did god do
[1:53:02] this what's happening now and
[1:53:04] and why all of that and you know
[1:53:07] and and we we didn't know even what to
[1:53:09] do
[1:53:12] we had no churches to go to we had no
[1:53:14] nothing to be to all we could do is is
[1:53:18] try to hear everything that was said
[1:53:22] absorb it
[1:53:24] eat it
[1:53:26] we become like this
[1:53:28] junction

[1:57:39] that was his message
[1:57:41] his voice
[1:57:43] his word
[1:57:45] and he would vindicate it every time
[1:57:47] remember revelation says that the our
[1:57:50] our revelation of deity to the last ages

[1:59:07] now you must meditate in it day and
[1:59:09] night
[1:59:11] oh come on young people
[1:59:13] look at the distractions today and it's
[1:59:16] not just young people it's middle-aged
[1:59:18] people
[1:59:20] you you you got marriage problems
[1:59:22] because
[1:59:23] men are just slaves to this video games
[1:59:28] and they're in a virtual world or a
[1:59:30] imaginary world
[1:59:33] they're living in demonic dimensions
[1:59:35] where they kill other people
[1:59:38] where they're murdering and raping and
[1:59:41] rabbising and
[1:59:43] and every other kind of thing
[1:59:46] tell me
[1:59:47] tell me what
[1:59:50] bit of good does it do
[1:59:56] you know we had a kid come to youth camp
[1:59:58] here that while back and he was a friend
[2:00:00] with other kids at youth camp and he
[2:00:02] wasn't a believer he just showed up
[2:00:04] because the other kids was coming to
[2:00:05] this christian camp so he wanted to go
[2:00:07] too and you know his claim to fame was
[2:00:09] i'm number three in the world for a
[2:00:11] certain game
[2:00:13] number three
[2:00:14] and i looked at him and i said
[2:00:16] whoop-dee-doo
[2:00:20] so what
[2:00:22] did that earn you a job
[2:00:25] does that put food on your table
[2:00:28] does that communicate with a wife or a
[2:00:30] friend
[2:00:31] does that do anything for christ
[2:00:36] does it add or contribute anything to
[2:00:38] the family
[2:00:42] so what good is it
[2:00:43] it's a waste of your time
[2:00:47] it is something to trap you in another
[2:00:49] dimension
[2:00:51] where your mind is filled with violence
[2:00:54] hate
[2:00:57] every other kind of evil thing i know
[2:00:59] what i'm talking about
[2:01:01] i was born at night daniel williams said
[2:01:03] but it wasn't last night
[2:01:08] so what is it
[2:01:10] when you stand before god and you give
[2:01:12] an account to him
[2:01:16] how ashamed are you going to be when
[2:01:18] it's all played back
[2:01:22] this is my life
[2:01:23] this is my world
[2:01:28] there's no prayer life
[2:01:30] that's right
[2:01:32] there's no word listened to
[2:01:35] there's no soul edified
[2:01:37] you're not edified and it's turned
[2:01:39] around to nervous
[2:01:41] hateful
[2:01:42] people
[2:01:43] that after feeding on those things go
[2:01:45] out and become mass murderers
[2:01:47] well i'd never do that you never know
[2:01:49] what it happens when that spirit takes
[2:01:51] you
[2:01:55] amen you know it's time for you to be a
[2:01:57] husband
[2:01:59] a daddy
[2:02:01] amen it's time for you to be a a man or
[2:02:05] a woman
[2:02:06] a mother
[2:02:08] don't get locked up in all these other
[2:02:10] things and so caught up with social
[2:02:12] media
[2:02:14] looking and lusting after what everybody
[2:02:16] else has that you don't have and you
[2:02:18] don't get to do
[2:02:20] amen they may have whatever they have
[2:02:23] but you got jesus
[2:02:25] amen you got a roof up above you you've
[2:02:27] got good food deed you got shoes on your
[2:02:30] feet you've got food on your table
[2:02:32] you're blessed
[2:02:34] quit looking at what you don't have and
[2:02:37] look around what you do have
[2:02:39] you've got a church you got a body of
[2:02:42] believers you got preachers that preach
[2:02:44] the word you got the you got the power
[2:02:46] of the holy ghost and cleanse from sin
[2:02:48] you have divine healing you have every
[2:02:51] need
[2:02:53] you don't need that
[2:03:00] meditate in this word day and night
[2:03:03] that they might and observe do it so you
[2:03:06] can learn to do
[2:03:09] everything according to what's written
[2:03:12] in there amen
[2:03:14] for then thou shalt make thy way
[2:03:16] prosperous
[2:03:17] and then thou shalt have good success
[2:03:21] have not i commanded thee be strong and
[2:03:23] of good courage and be not afraid and be
[2:03:26] not dismayed for the lord thy god
[2:03:28] is with thee whether so ever thou goest
[2:03:32] now
[2:03:33] i think that that has been so applicable
[2:03:37] to these years that we have had since
[2:03:40] brother branham has gone now think of it
[2:03:42] god sent us a prophet from 1909 to 1965
[2:03:46] he was with us 56 years
[2:03:50] i love it i i think about young men back
[2:03:53] in the day
[2:03:55] young men like brother earl williams
[2:03:59] who brother brandon would say now you
[2:04:01] know they got this this rally for the
[2:04:03] youth people youth youth and make sure
[2:04:06] you get your young people to this youth
[2:04:08] rallying and i want to see my daughter
[2:04:11] there and i want to see her filled with
[2:04:12] the holy ghost
[2:04:14] amen and then he comes up to brother
[2:04:16] branham's memorial service and he he
[2:04:19] writes some things on a lunch sack and
[2:04:22] he writes and and he talks about brother
[2:04:25] branham and his ministry and what it
[2:04:27] meant to him and and he says you know
[2:04:29] some
[2:04:30] he he did not he wasn't like others it
[2:04:33] left us a big cathedral or he left us a
[2:04:36] big organization or left us bible
[2:04:38] schools
[2:04:40] but he said he left us a message
[2:04:45] amen and that's what god did he left us
[2:04:49] a message
[2:04:51] by sending a prophet in this day we got
[2:04:54] a message from god
[2:04:56] amen
[2:04:58] well brother tim i don't know well i
[2:05:00] tell you i i don't know if he was elijah
[2:05:03] well then you've got a problem
[2:05:08] because elijah must first come
[2:05:13] you got a problem because before the
[2:05:15] world burns elijah's got to come
[2:05:18] so where's your elijah
[2:05:20] i know when the little black lady when
[2:05:23] she was praying that day for her son
[2:05:26] and he was dying
[2:05:28] and then she was just a you would have
[2:05:30] thought of nobody down in memphis and
[2:05:32] forgotten in a forgotten neighborhood an
[2:05:34] impoverished little lady there down
[2:05:36] there but a saint of god
[2:05:38] god never forgets us
[2:05:41] he knows where we are
[2:05:43] he doesn't care about our our ethnicity
[2:05:46] our race or our ideas our culture our
[2:05:49] way god comes right down
[2:05:51] amen right down to the humblest of heart
[2:05:54] that begins to call on him and she said
[2:05:56] lord i know who i am i that soon my
[2:05:59] woman you gave me a child
[2:06:01] when i was barren and you gave me a
[2:06:04] child and i tried to raise him for you
[2:06:06] and he's dying lord and he's lost oh god
[2:06:09] i'm the sooner my woman but where's your
[2:06:10] elijah
[2:06:13] he didn't send billy graham he didn't
[2:06:16] send all robbers
[2:06:18] [Applause]
[2:06:20] hallelujah amen amen but he sent elijah
[2:06:23] to her she asked for elijah and elijah
[2:06:27] come walking down her street
[2:06:31] hallelujah that's what happens when a
[2:06:34] saint begins to pray amen that god
[2:06:36] begins to move
[2:06:38] you know what happened brother brandon
[2:06:40] said that woman's prayer caused a storm
[2:06:43] in the heavens that caused that plane to
[2:06:46] have to come down in memphis and be
[2:06:49] grounded
[2:06:52] a woman's prayer
[2:06:54] caused the plane to be delayed because
[2:06:58] it had not a jonah on board but an
[2:07:01] elijah on board and a child of god had
[2:07:04] asked for elijah and here come elijah
[2:07:06] walking down her street
[2:07:09] found her house yes
[2:07:12] come on now
[2:07:14] you can't make this stuff up it happened
[2:07:17] and it happened over and over and over
[2:07:19] and over again
[2:07:22] hallelujah where god came by our way the
[2:07:25] supernatural being displayed
[2:07:29] amen god left us a message
[2:07:32] and now from 65
[2:07:35] to now we've had 56 years of
[2:07:39] and absorbing the message
[2:07:43] we've also had 56 years where cults and
[2:07:46] clans were made and
[2:07:49] personality cults raised up
[2:07:52] gonna try to be the next great one to
[2:07:54] lead the bride on
[2:08:00] but nevertheless
[2:08:02] we've had 56 years
[2:08:06] now
[2:08:08] of teachings
[2:08:10] absorbing the message
[2:08:12] we started out with just a handful
[2:08:15] we were conf we we
[2:08:18] there's many things we misunderstood
[2:08:20] we we didn't have much of it there and
[2:08:23] we had to we we had to borrow and beg
[2:08:26] and get and print and
[2:08:29] and share and everything else and
[2:08:32] you know we spent money
[2:08:35] listen i was
[2:08:36] i was a poor boy
[2:08:38] there was times i didn't have a vehicle
[2:08:41] to ride in me and my wife was afoot
[2:08:50] and yet i wanted a tape player
[2:08:52] that i could hear the prophet's message
[2:08:54] on
[2:08:56] my son would cost me 500 300 the
[2:08:59] hospital 200 to the doctor he'd been
[2:09:02] worth every penny of it
[2:09:06] 377 to buy a tape player
[2:09:10] but i had to have it
[2:09:12] i sacrificed we pinched pennies we did
[2:09:14] everything to get it
[2:09:16] we labored in it
[2:09:19] amen whatever whatever that was taught
[2:09:22] we wanted to know what god said to this
[2:09:24] age
[2:09:26] and we've absorbed it yes
[2:09:29] amen we've absorbed it we we have we
[2:09:32] have taken and we've ate the book
[2:09:34] we consumed it
[2:09:37] there's some things that made their
[2:09:38] belly bitter
[2:09:41] some things we wanted to spit out
[2:09:44] but somehow another we've kept it down
[2:09:47] hallelujah
[2:09:48] hallelujah amen but remember the reason
[2:09:51] for eden is more more than just say well
[2:09:54] i've consumed and i've listened to so
[2:09:56] many tapes and i i've read so many books
[2:09:58] and you know
[2:10:00] and of course i can say by god's grace i
[2:10:02] i've listened to every sermon of brother
[2:10:04] branham's many times multitask over read
[2:10:08] my bible and laid in the presence of god
[2:10:11] and served in all every way that i could
[2:10:13] i'd sat at other ministers feet i'd
[2:10:16] listen to them preach
[2:10:19] and i've learned from this
[2:10:23] took nuggets from harold hildebrand ned
[2:10:25] biscuit donny reagan and daniel williams
[2:10:28] and i don't know how many others the man
[2:10:31] that is standing in this pulpit today is
[2:10:34] made up of many many different men
[2:10:37] who contributed to my life
[2:10:40] yet i never sat under any preacher
[2:10:43] but let me just say this let me let me
[2:10:45] just say this you know we have a sword
[2:10:47] the message we have digest the message
[2:10:49] we have been preaching the message
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:53] but now
[2:10:55] a lot of our great men are now gone
[2:10:58] are going
[2:11:00] i just preached brother harold
[2:11:02] hildebrandt's memorial service
[2:11:04] i just spoke at brother ed mitchell's
[2:11:06] 50th anniversary for the church there
[2:11:08] we've had our 50th
[2:11:11] brother biscuit a man who's taken the
[2:11:13] message 169
[2:11:16] times to overseas lands
[2:11:18] some of those represent six weeks at a
[2:11:21] time
[2:11:23] but now it's over
[2:11:25] it's true
[2:11:26] it's been two and a half years since
[2:11:28] he's actively ministered
[2:11:31] that season is over
[2:11:33] if it isn't it's about over
[2:11:36] you know others of our elders are
[2:11:39] are retiring because of health or or
[2:11:42] whatever moving out of the ministry
[2:11:45] now i just want to say today i believe
[2:11:47] we're at another junction
[2:11:51] a junction is where a change comes
[2:11:55] we're at a we're at a particular place
[2:11:58] where where there is a change that we've
[2:12:01] had as i said we have absorbed the
[2:12:03] message
[2:12:04] we have digested it
[2:12:08] we we've chewed on it we've we've looked
[2:12:11] at it in every kind of way
[2:12:13] and and but however
[2:12:15] every dispensation comes to its end
[2:12:20] you see and we hit a junction
[2:12:23] and there's been junctions on the
[2:12:24] highway just as you come you had to make
[2:12:27] this turn or that turn to come here
[2:12:29] you see it was a junction there truncans
[2:12:31] on the road that we travel and there's
[2:12:34] junctions on this grand old highway that
[2:12:36] we travel to glory
[2:12:39] and as always it takes the miraculous to
[2:12:42] speak of the omnipotence
[2:12:44] you see omnipotence is all power and it
[2:12:47] takes the miraculous to vindicate the
[2:12:51] omnipotence we can say all power lays in
[2:12:55] the word all power lays in the truth all
[2:12:58] power is in the message but it takes the
[2:13:01] supernatural the miraculous to vindicate
[2:13:05] the omnipotence
[2:13:07] and it's only the miraculous that can do
[2:13:09] that
[2:13:10] teaching the word is a very fine thing
[2:13:12] and we've had great teachings
[2:13:15] and a whole cycle of teachings
[2:13:17] teaching the words of fine things we've
[2:13:19] had that for the past 56 years
[2:13:22] teachers rising up
[2:13:24] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[2:13:26] the word of god
[2:13:28] amen and i just say you know we should
[2:13:31] be a people of faith by now
[2:13:35] if faith comes by hearing and hearing
[2:13:37] the word we ought to be a people chock
[2:13:38] full of faith
[2:13:40] but alas and many have turned the
[2:13:42] message into unbelief
[2:13:45] to a powerless religion
[2:13:47] whose only weapon is argument
[2:13:50] gold is the power of god gold is the
[2:13:53] gifts of the spirit that was restored so
[2:13:56] much for restoration you see there's not
[2:13:58] a sign of them
[2:14:00] gold is the shadow of the king
[2:14:02] gold is the joy of the holy ghost and
[2:14:05] the church is settled down to religion
[2:14:07] with slave mentality
[2:14:10] amen the mentality of a bones woman and
[2:14:14] a little wild donkey of a people who
[2:14:16] won't be subject to the word amen
[2:14:20] amen now you preach the word you preach
[2:14:23] holiness and they just glob on to pay
[2:14:25] all the more
[2:14:27] you preach there how that our women
[2:14:29] should be and the next thing you know
[2:14:31] their fingers are full of navy bean
[2:14:33] hulls and the toenails the same
[2:14:37] hey man you you speak about modesty and
[2:14:40] the next thing you know instead of a
[2:14:43] modest necklace or something right there
[2:14:45] they're loaded down look like they walk
[2:14:47] through a ten-cent store with the magnet
[2:14:49] on
[2:14:51] and it isn't long until our boys begin
[2:14:54] to look like sissies and our girls take
[2:14:56] on masculine spirits
[2:14:59] and our girls are pushed out into into
[2:15:02] school and learning and whatever else
[2:15:04] while our boys are sitting there playing
[2:15:06] with their games
[2:15:09] hope you didn't bring rotten eggs this
[2:15:11] morning because yeah i just made myself
[2:15:13] a target
[2:15:15] amen but i i just want you i want you to
[2:15:18] know it takes the miraculous
[2:15:20] to vindicate the omnipotence
[2:15:23] that the omnipotence still lives and
[2:15:25] reigns
[2:15:26] we must have the miraculous
[2:15:29] [Music]
[2:15:30] amen i believe brother branham even as
[2:15:33] brother branham did that the church is
[2:15:35] on the threshold of the greatest
[2:15:37] vindication of omnipotence that the
[2:15:39] world has ever known
[2:15:41] we're right here on the threshold of it
[2:15:44] [Music]
[2:15:45] amen we're right here at the junction of
[2:15:48] it
[2:15:49] but and here in this junction we are
[2:15:52] seeing the display of his omnipotence
[2:15:56] our voice must say the lord god
[2:15:59] omnipotent reigneth
[2:16:01] it is at this junction that god shows
[2:16:04] his omnipotence i then showed you how in
[2:16:07] the world could we ever have the dead in
[2:16:09] christ raised how can our bodies be
[2:16:12] changed unless the lord god reigns in
[2:16:14] omnipotence
[2:16:16] he'll reign over our mortal bodies
[2:16:19] amen it's in this junction that god
[2:16:22] shows his omnipotence
[2:16:23] and we're looking over the face of
[2:16:25] people today here's a woman here that
[2:16:27] was dying with cancer amen wasn't
[2:16:30] nothing but a shadow of a woman and she
[2:16:32] wasn't far from the point of going over
[2:16:35] but she sets this morning healthy and
[2:16:37] well and rosy cheeks why because god has
[2:16:41] displayed his omnipotence
[2:16:45] are you with me that's not the only one
[2:16:47] we could go right down the line time
[2:16:50] upon time where we've seen the holy
[2:16:52] spirit move
[2:16:55] are you with me and my men and women are
[2:16:57] right here from families of alcoholics
[2:17:01] you know if you don't went the way your
[2:17:03] brothers did or your siblings did
[2:17:07] you know if you went the way your
[2:17:09] parents did you'd be an alcoholic
[2:17:12] while i drunk
[2:17:15] you know you wouldn't have nothing
[2:17:20] look around look at the difference
[2:17:22] between you and your sibling that didn't
[2:17:24] choose jesus
[2:17:26] look what happened look at their lives
[2:17:30] look at the divorces look at the
[2:17:32] illegitimate children without a daddy
[2:17:35] because he's an alcoholic
[2:17:37] look at all the problems look at what
[2:17:40] they call but you see omnipotence
[2:17:43] spoke
[2:17:44] amen
[2:17:45] amen took you out of the world
[2:17:48] saved you from a life of sin
[2:17:50] filled you with the holy ghost took the
[2:17:53] desire of the world out of you
[2:17:57] hallelujah
[2:17:59] amen you have to break with everything
[2:18:02] with culture with friends with family
[2:18:04] whatever but you were called out
[2:18:07] for a purpose you were called out for a
[2:18:10] reason and that was to be a voice to his
[2:18:13] omnipotence
[2:18:15] god reigns he reigned over the problems
[2:18:19] of my family he reigned over the
[2:18:21] sickness he reigned over diseases he
[2:18:24] reigned over sin
[2:18:26] [Applause]
[2:18:29] others are children of adulterers and
[2:18:31] sinners they are transformed by the
[2:18:33] power of omnipotence
[2:18:36] think of it
[2:18:38] look where we can look at these
[2:18:40] junctions like enoch the seventh from
[2:18:42] adam and here we are the seventh age
[2:18:44] from the second adam
[2:18:45] he walked with god blameless
[2:18:49] and at the same time that evil was
[2:18:51] appearing angels appeared on the earth
[2:18:54] angelic beings moved into men
[2:18:57] think of that very beautiful type of
[2:18:59] today that evil is appearing and so is
[2:19:01] good appearing
[2:19:03] look we have never seen quite a time
[2:19:06] just like this
[2:19:07] because why actually innumerable
[2:19:11] innumerable numbers of spirits have been
[2:19:14] released
[2:19:16] the bible gives it a number of 200
[2:19:19] uh 200 million but actually the meaning
[2:19:22] is innumerable
[2:19:24] it is the same thing of hebrews 11 that
[2:19:27] you find in hebrews 11 as you do over in
[2:19:29] the book of revelation of the the
[2:19:32] the the the two hundred thousand
[2:19:34] thousand it just means innumerable
[2:19:37] nobody counted them
[2:19:39] they just was up without number hebrew
[2:19:41] said and i saw he said we've come to new
[2:19:44] jerusalem to innumerable company of
[2:19:46] angels it's the same word
[2:19:50] it's not a certain number there's
[2:19:53] millions of them
[2:19:55] millions of them and they have been
[2:19:57] released and the bible shows you
[2:20:00] symbolically from euphrates which
[2:20:02] represents a line that they could not
[2:20:05] cross
[2:20:06] on the other side was eden
[2:20:10] amen and they were looking for eden
[2:20:13] amen when they couldn't get into eden
[2:20:15] they were bound there and when they
[2:20:17] couldn't bring an eden back on earth
[2:20:20] somebody with me
[2:20:22] they'd turn around and kill those that
[2:20:24] eaten this far
[2:20:29] now hold on my thought just for a minute
[2:20:32] go to revelation 9 and verse 1.
[2:20:35] we're just going to deal with this for
[2:20:36] just a little while
[2:20:40] because the fifth angel sounded yes
[2:20:43] and i saw a star fall from heaven i want
[2:20:45] you to notice this
[2:20:47] he did not descend
[2:20:53] there is a difference between a fall and
[2:20:56] a descending
[2:20:58] the lord jesus descends from heaven with
[2:21:00] a shout
[2:21:02] this angel the star this star fell
[2:21:07] from heaven to the earth
[2:21:10] notice
[2:21:11] and to him was given the key
[2:21:13] or the permission to open the bottomless
[2:21:17] pit
[2:21:18] amen
[2:21:21] now
[2:21:22] and he opened the bottomless pit now he
[2:21:24] is an angel or a star that fall a fallen
[2:21:28] star one that didn't keep his his first
[2:21:31] estate
[2:21:33] i want you to be careful in this age
[2:21:36] because there are many that are not
[2:21:38] keeping their first estate
[2:21:41] remember just as there's a peter james
[2:21:43] and john there is a judas
[2:21:47] brother tim are you calling me a judas
[2:21:49] i'm saying do not leave your first
[2:21:52] estate
[2:21:54] stay with the word
[2:21:56] amen
[2:21:58] the only difference right now between
[2:22:00] you and judas is this is that you don't
[2:22:03] have to remain a judas
[2:22:07] you still have an opportunity to turn
[2:22:09] around
[2:22:11] and become real you don't have to go
[2:22:13] along impersonating the rest of your
[2:22:15] life
[2:22:17] you can be real
[2:22:20] fifth angel sounded i saw a star from
[2:22:22] heaven for uh
[2:22:23] unto fall from heaven to the earth and
[2:22:26] him was given the key
[2:22:28] to the bottomless pit
[2:22:30] and he opened
[2:22:32] the bottomless pit and there arose a
[2:22:35] smoke out of the pit
[2:22:37] as the smoke of a great furnace and the
[2:22:40] sun and the air were darkened by the
[2:22:43] reason of the smoke of the pit
[2:22:45] now the book of revelation is a book of
[2:22:48] symbols
[2:22:50] so these are this this is not to be
[2:22:53] thought of literally
[2:22:55] this is to be thought of symbolically
[2:22:59] so you see in the symbolism he opens the
[2:23:03] bottomless pit
[2:23:04] now remember a bottomless pit is where
[2:23:06] there's no foundation
[2:23:08] and you just tumble over and over and
[2:23:10] over and over this is the state of ever
[2:23:12] lost person
[2:23:15] amen they're just falling falling you
[2:23:17] think you think oh they'll
[2:23:20] a lot a lot of times people would think
[2:23:21] they'll walk away from jesus and i'll
[2:23:23] just be a good person you won't
[2:23:27] you will start falling
[2:23:30] and one thing will lead to another and
[2:23:32] you'll just tumble over and over and
[2:23:34] again
[2:23:35] and he said i saw a star flow from
[2:23:36] heaven to the earth and him was given
[2:23:38] the key and he opened the bottom split
[2:23:40] and there rose they smoke
[2:23:42] out of the pit
[2:23:44] so out of this pit comes a smoke
[2:23:50] now smoke is a is a blinding
[2:23:54] you can kill people with smoke
[2:23:57] a lot of times it isn't the fire that
[2:23:59] ever gets to them it makes their death
[2:24:01] it's the smoke
[2:24:03] [Music]
[2:24:04] it deprives them of their oxygen
[2:24:08] and the smoke when smoke gets into the
[2:24:10] house what happens it gets into every
[2:24:12] fabric
[2:24:14] your house catches on fire it isn't just
[2:24:17] oh well we'll repair the walls and
[2:24:19] whatever your furniture smells like
[2:24:21] smoke your your curtains are smoky your
[2:24:24] we your the walls that wouldn't burn or
[2:24:27] all have suitable everything's a mess
[2:24:30] it's con everything's contaminated
[2:24:33] amen
[2:24:34] somebody hear me preach
[2:24:36] amen so he opens the bottomless pit and
[2:24:39] smoke comes out it's a blinding delusion
[2:24:43] don't you understand this is why even
[2:24:46] our president would come out and say
[2:24:48] fake news
[2:24:51] because why there's a spirit of delusion
[2:24:55] nobody knows what is the truth
[2:25:01] you know somebody sent me a a an article
[2:25:03] the other day and you know every person
[2:25:05] that gets this shot they all have are
[2:25:07] having symptoms of my mycardia and
[2:25:10] they're dying and they're going to die
[2:25:12] and all this how do i know that's right
[2:25:14] or wrong
[2:25:16] how do you know whether it's right or
[2:25:17] wrong
[2:25:18] one say well there's nothing to it
[2:25:20] another scenario something to it and
[2:25:22] then we're all divided
[2:25:25] so you know again you know it's a it's a
[2:25:28] strong delusion
[2:25:30] there's confusion everywhere people
[2:25:32] don't know what to believe
[2:25:35] and the devil will do everything to
[2:25:37] bring a delusion
[2:25:40] to take you off course
[2:25:44] amen
[2:25:46] and the bible said the son that's christ
[2:25:50] the
[2:25:50] word and the air atmosphere is darkened
[2:25:56] by the reason of the smoke out of hell
[2:26:01] so it blocks out the light of the word
[2:26:05] it blocks out the atmosphere of the holy
[2:26:08] ghost
[2:26:09] amen
[2:26:10] amen
[2:26:12] amen it permeates every crack and
[2:26:15] crevice of humanity
[2:26:17] amen
[2:26:19] we are here at this junction
[2:26:22] [Music]
[2:26:25] we're here right
[2:26:27] where fire is
[2:26:28] is about to fall
[2:26:31] i want you to turn with me as we hold
[2:26:33] our thought here to this revelation nine
[2:26:36] and one and two until i go to second
[2:26:38] thessalonians two and ten and with all
[2:26:40] deceivableness of unrighteousness
[2:26:43] have you ever seen a such a time where
[2:26:46] truth is blocked amen
[2:26:50] have you i i'm going to get into it in
[2:26:51] just a moment but you know
[2:26:53] if you
[2:26:55] truth now is judged on whether you are
[2:26:58] favorable to what's said
[2:27:01] social media has its way of blocking
[2:27:04] what it that once said
[2:27:08] you know even the fact-finders there
[2:27:11] they are biased in their fact-finding
[2:27:15] to where you can't even believe they're
[2:27:17] fact-finding
[2:27:19] are you with me it's all under with uh
[2:27:22] with deceivableness and unrighteousness
[2:27:25] in them that perish
[2:27:27] look exactly what we have had now nearly
[2:27:30] 2 000 years of twisting the gospel
[2:27:33] twisting the message
[2:27:36] a man until it's deceivable of
[2:27:39] unrighteousness in them that perish
[2:27:41] because
[2:27:42] they did not receive the love of the
[2:27:44] truth
[2:27:46] here's the thing if you're going to do
[2:27:49] anything seek the love of the truth
[2:27:53] i don't mean the love to be right i'm
[2:27:55] talking about the love of truth god is
[2:27:58] truth
[2:27:59] and when you get the love of god in you
[2:28:02] then it doesn't matter what everybody
[2:28:04] else has said you give the word of god
[2:28:07] preeminence
[2:28:08] [Applause]
[2:28:12] all deceivingness of unrighteousness and
[2:28:15] them to perish because they receive not
[2:28:16] the love of the truth that they might be
[2:28:18] delivered saved
[2:28:20] and for this cross
[2:28:23] and for this reason
[2:28:25] because they did not
[2:28:27] truly seek christ
[2:28:30] god shall send them a strong delusion
[2:28:34] that they should believe a lie
[2:28:38] that is the whole premise of what is
[2:28:41] going on in the world today
[2:28:44] to get you to believe a lie
[2:28:50] mr biden don't want to take
[2:28:52] credit for the inflation and the price
[2:28:54] at the pump he said putin did that
[2:28:59] he wants you to believe the lie
[2:29:03] he wants to point away from the truth
[2:29:06] he even will take the things that are
[2:29:08] obvious to get you to believe a lot the
[2:29:11] lion is coming into every form
[2:29:15] here the other day in our courts in
[2:29:17] california they decided that a bumblebee
[2:29:20] was a fish
[2:29:24] that just happened in the news
[2:29:26] a bumblebee is now a fish
[2:29:28] because he is going to be protected
[2:29:31] under a certain law for our
[2:29:33] environmental reasoning and so we just
[2:29:36] change we just change a bumblebee into a
[2:29:40] fish
[2:29:44] so when you go out and you see the
[2:29:46] bumblebees flying around you can try to
[2:29:48] eat a fish
[2:29:51] that's a fish
[2:29:55] insanity doesn't stop anywhere
[2:29:58] in new york the high court is is
[2:30:01] receiving to make a decision on whether
[2:30:03] an elephant is a human
[2:30:07] that is in the supreme court and you in
[2:30:09] new york the case is up before them
[2:30:11] right now i'm not making this up
[2:30:16] but you know whether
[2:30:18] and they're going to decide
[2:30:20] whether i mean they can do it they can
[2:30:22] decide whether a man is a female or a
[2:30:26] male
[2:30:28] people can decide now a kid can go to
[2:30:30] school and and require a little a litter
[2:30:33] box because he identifies or she
[2:30:35] identifies as a cat
[2:30:38] and you better not tell it
[2:30:41] you better not tell it you're not a cat
[2:30:43] get up and sit down quit meowing you're
[2:30:45] human
[2:30:50] you see it's a strong delusion
[2:30:53] it's a spirit of insanity
[2:30:56] and it's satan's mind
[2:31:00] that is being pressed into the world the
[2:31:03] spirits come
[2:31:06] that have been released and given
[2:31:08] permission to come into this age
[2:31:14] and our kids are coming up against sin
[2:31:17] our yell our youths our our parents
[2:31:20] everybody every every part of it
[2:31:23] listen they shall receive a strong
[2:31:26] delusion and believe a lie
[2:31:29] it is a lie
[2:31:31] to say that a boy is a girl
[2:31:36] it is a lie to say a girl is a boy
[2:31:40] well they identified they you cannot
[2:31:42] identify you well we're not identifying
[2:31:45] a a bumblebee as a fish and an elephant
[2:31:48] is a human
[2:31:52] it is a bottomless pit
[2:31:55] and a strong delusion and the mind of
[2:31:58] satan coming down
[2:32:02] oh my goodness church don't you realize
[2:32:05] how important it is that you have the
[2:32:08] mind of christ
[2:32:09] in this day and hour that the
[2:32:11] supernatural one is revealing itself to
[2:32:14] you
[2:32:17] amen
[2:32:19] look at this
[2:32:20] that they might be damned who believe
[2:32:22] not the truth but add pleasure and
[2:32:24] unrighteousness those who have pleasure
[2:32:26] unrighteousness are taken on a spirit of
[2:32:29] insanity
[2:32:34] and verse 3 of revelation 9 there came
[2:32:38] out of that delusion
[2:32:40] spirits
[2:32:42] locusts
[2:32:44] upon the earth
[2:32:45] and to them was given power
[2:32:49] as the scorpions of the earth have power
[2:32:52] and they command it it was commanded
[2:32:53] them they should not hurt the grass of
[2:32:55] the earth nor any green thing nor any
[2:32:58] tree
[2:32:59] so you see
[2:33:00] it's not trees
[2:33:02] it's not it's not green things watch
[2:33:04] what it is
[2:33:05] but only those men
[2:33:07] which have not the seal of god in their
[2:33:10] forehead
[2:33:13] so you can see its demons and he said
[2:33:15] they're going to attack men not green
[2:33:18] things
[2:33:21] men
[2:33:22] and these men are men who don't have the
[2:33:25] seal of god in their forehead
[2:33:29] you see to reject the mind the mind of
[2:33:32] god the holy ghost is to take the mark
[2:33:35] of the beast
[2:33:37] and here he comes now and and here he
[2:33:39] comes to afflict those who does not have
[2:33:42] the seal this is why children without
[2:33:45] the seal you're going to be cutting
[2:33:47] yourself suicide spirits pornography
[2:33:51] slaves to video games and every other
[2:33:54] thing why
[2:33:56] why because you didn't get the seal of
[2:33:58] god only the seal of god is going to
[2:34:01] protect you in this hour
[2:34:05] [Music]
[2:34:09] it's the spirit of insanity
[2:34:12] and we're getting worse
[2:34:15] and the bible said it was given to them
[2:34:16] that they should not kill them but
[2:34:18] should torment them for five months and
[2:34:20] and the torment was the torment of a
[2:34:21] scorpion that's when he's striking a man
[2:34:23] so he said it's not something that
[2:34:24] really kills you it's something that
[2:34:26] torments you
[2:34:29] and in those days men shall seek death
[2:34:31] and shall not find and shall desire to
[2:34:33] die and death shall flee from me you say
[2:34:35] brother tim this is tribulation stuff
[2:34:37] listen we are in pre-tribulation times
[2:34:44] already the smoke
[2:34:47] is already
[2:34:48] filtering into homes
[2:34:52] into churches
[2:34:54] into the fabric of humanity
[2:34:59] look
[2:35:00] let's go to ii thessalonians 2 and 3.
[2:35:02] let no man deceive you for any by any
[2:35:05] means for that day shall not come except
[2:35:07] there come now falling away first
[2:35:10] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[2:35:12] of perdition so we now know the son of
[2:35:15] perdition is to be revealed he opposes
[2:35:17] and exalts himself all above all that is
[2:35:20] called
[2:35:21] called god
[2:35:22] or that is worship so that he is god
[2:35:24] sitteth in the temple of god showing
[2:35:26] himself that he is god
[2:35:29] look what happens now
[2:35:32] there is
[2:35:33] no giving god preeminence
[2:35:36] it is opposing it exalted oneself over
[2:35:39] all that is called god
[2:35:42] and worshiping self
[2:35:45] amen
[2:35:46] and there is never been a day like
[2:35:48] laodicea of people's rights
[2:35:52] where that's where that sin is exalted
[2:35:56] and people's rights
[2:35:58] the rights to do anything wrong
[2:36:02] [Music]
[2:36:04] listen they're not satisfied with
[2:36:06] millions of abortions
[2:36:08] they want to be able to still abort kids
[2:36:11] after they're born
[2:36:20] they're talking about one month then
[2:36:21] three months and then three years up to
[2:36:24] three years
[2:36:29] why because self is being glorified
[2:36:33] more about me
[2:36:34] my body my rights
[2:36:37] myself
[2:36:42] the mystery of iniquity the spirit of
[2:36:45] lawlessness
[2:36:46] we are in the days in this junction of a
[2:36:49] spirit of lawlessness has been released
[2:36:56] where sin is glorified
[2:36:59] we're convicts and and
[2:37:02] murders and bad people
[2:37:05] are exalted while our our police is
[2:37:07] defunded
[2:37:11] where are where where protection is
[2:37:13] taken away from from good people and
[2:37:15] protection is given to bad people and
[2:37:18] instead of incarcerating them put them
[2:37:20] in jail and keeping them there and
[2:37:22] keeping the rest of the public safe let
[2:37:24] them all go
[2:37:28] where do you get all this insanity
[2:37:31] yet it's filled in the highest of our
[2:37:33] officials
[2:37:36] in the greatest areas of learning
[2:37:41] they made a plan years ago
[2:37:44] years ago we're going to we're going to
[2:37:47] raise up we're not just coming out of
[2:37:50] the closet we're going to raise up we
[2:37:52] will be the teachers in the school we
[2:37:54] will be the principals we will be there
[2:37:57] on the school board we will force our
[2:38:00] agenda in the colleges we will change
[2:38:02] the minds of generations
[2:38:05] the smoke is going everywhere
[2:38:13] and if you ain't careful christians
[2:38:16] smell like it
[2:38:20] and christians get blinded by it
[2:38:23] and homes where things were not once
[2:38:25] tolerated
[2:38:27] i get bind to it
[2:38:29] and churches and pastors
[2:38:32] are blinded by it
[2:38:35] amen
[2:38:38] the mystery of iniquity the spirit of
[2:38:41] lawlessness
[2:38:43] doth already work only he who letteth
[2:38:45] will let in him till he be taken away
[2:38:48] you know brother branham explained that
[2:38:49] scripture and he said he and he said
[2:38:52] until he
[2:38:53] the holy spirit
[2:38:55] is taken away and he said hey and he
[2:38:57] said it's the holy spirit in the bride
[2:39:00] so let me tell you when the bride leaves
[2:39:03] from here
[2:39:06] we just sing the song on sea and land he
[2:39:09] stands
[2:39:10] a book is in his hands
[2:39:13] well
[2:39:14] you know we we had the picture with the
[2:39:16] sign in the heavens of the cloud
[2:39:19] some people don't want to identify with
[2:39:21] that but it was a sign that christ was
[2:39:23] coming
[2:39:26] amen there was a lot of been a lot of
[2:39:28] confusion about it but let me just tell
[2:39:29] you it was a sign that they still cannot
[2:39:33] explain
[2:39:34] amen that they have no explanation no
[2:39:37] scientific explanation for whatsoever
[2:39:42] but it was formed in the heavens
[2:39:45] to show that christ was here he was
[2:39:48] coming in word form to a prophet
[2:39:52] and just before that brother branham
[2:39:55] goes for the opening of the seals there
[2:39:58] this sign is shown in the heavens
[2:40:00] to show us she said brother tim it's it
[2:40:03] was done by rocket listen they cannot
[2:40:06] they they they are not able after all
[2:40:10] they're trying to cannot they cannot
[2:40:13] they do not have any explanation even
[2:40:16] after 50 years and they're the books are
[2:40:18] now open and the mysteries are all
[2:40:20] supposed to be released of all their
[2:40:22] secrets they still have no answer
[2:40:26] but i say if it even was a man-made
[2:40:29] event
[2:40:34] if it was caused by a rocket tell me
[2:40:37] what other age
[2:40:39] that this supernatural age
[2:40:43] could ever do this
[2:40:51] 100 years ago
[2:40:53] we're the same mind we're the same man
[2:40:55] we're the same people
[2:41:00] do you know you are living in a
[2:41:01] supernatural age things that are beyond
[2:41:05] natural capabilities
[2:41:08] no other age you are speaking a language
[2:41:10] none of them would understand
[2:41:14] you are doing things that other ages if
[2:41:17] they even dreamed about it was just a
[2:41:19] it was just a laughing joke
[2:41:23] it was a funny papers
[2:41:25] [Music]
[2:41:27] come on
[2:41:28] am i we are living in a very
[2:41:30] supernatural time but what i'm trying to
[2:41:32] say on land and sea he said why why did
[2:41:35] we just see the head and the heavens

[2:48:36] did laws do anything
[2:48:39] you know first thing you do it does
[2:48:40] shoots his grandma and then goes on a
[2:48:42] rampage
[2:48:44] the spirit of lawlessness what happened
[2:48:46] in minneapolis with george floyd
[2:48:49] the mystery of iniquity is now being
[2:48:51] revealed the mind of satan
[2:48:54] 25 americans
[2:48:56] you know killed during the riots and

[2:49:22] his body guess who was glorified
[2:49:26] guess who was defunded
[2:49:30] you know why because sin has a voice
[2:49:34] and it's sodom it screams louder than
[2:49:37] the
[2:49:38] righteous you see the righteous lot was
[2:49:41] trying to reason with but they were
[2:49:44] screaming louder than he was
[2:49:48] and yes we have righteous people in
[2:49:50] america sometimes a good politician once
[2:49:53] in a while it ain't bought off but you
[2:49:55] know who whatever as i say about
[2:49:57] louisiana we got the best politicians
[2:50:00] money can buy
[2:50:02] but nevertheless you know you you know
[2:50:04] again you know
[2:50:06] they're those righteous those that are
[2:50:08] righteous that's got a smidgen of
[2:50:10] righteousness left
[2:50:12] you know
[2:50:13] the voice
[2:50:15] of sin
[2:50:16] and the voice of sodom
[2:50:19] is louder than any righteous voice
[2:50:23] the spirit of the lawlessness is rampant
[2:50:26] in our nation it's the force behind the
[2:50:29] legislation that seeks to banish god for
[2:50:32] from our society you know i don't know
[2:50:34] if you saw the new quarters that are
[2:50:36] there but you know it used to be george
[2:50:38] washington looking toward the phrase in
[2:50:40] god we trust they've they've they've
[2:50:43] taken that and turned it around this
[2:50:45] year now he's looking away his back is
[2:50:48] on god no longer does he trust in god
[2:50:52] it is assigned to america
[2:50:55] we don't trust and know god anymore
[2:51:00] now satan is using you know like in the
[2:51:04] days a lot the voice of sodom drowning
[2:51:06] out the voice of righteous lock keeping
[2:51:09] them from having a voice
[2:51:11] you don't have a voice
[2:51:14] amen you know and the voices the voice
[2:51:17] screams out back to you every time that
[2:51:19] you try to rebuke sin you have the right
[2:51:22] to judge us
[2:51:25] you have no right to judge us
[2:51:28] we do have a right to judge
[2:51:32] amen i said we do have a right to judge
[2:51:35] we're to judge between right and wrong
[2:51:38] of course we don't send sins condemn
[2:51:40] somebody to hell we can't do that nobody
[2:51:43] can but we do have a right to judge evil
[2:51:47] and call see them seeing and wrong wrong
[2:51:50] and right right
[2:51:52] everybody you your parents have got a
[2:51:54] right to judge in your home when you go
[2:51:56] and your kids
[2:51:57] there and and there there's every kind
[2:51:59] of black and evil and every kind of
[2:52:02] picture of evil and all kinds of things
[2:52:05] you have a right as a parent to go in
[2:52:08] that room and say we are not having this
[2:52:11] trash in our house we do not worship
[2:52:14] rock and roll we don't worship the devil
[2:52:17] and we're not going to have a sign of
[2:52:18] him here
[2:52:22] amen
[2:52:26] you see satan using the same lie on the
[2:52:30] on the believers today day after day
[2:52:33] convincing
[2:52:34] masses of believers that you can sin
[2:52:38] without paying any penalty
[2:52:42] scheme for to pro uh to pervert the
[2:52:45] gospel of grace
[2:52:47] let me tell you friends when you get the
[2:52:49] holy ghost it changes your desire you no
[2:52:52] longer willingly sin willfully sin
[2:52:55] you know at first you know people will
[2:52:58] just wink at it you know but it's a
[2:53:00] strong delusion and then they'll
[2:53:02] actually begin to actively seek out a
[2:53:05] message of
[2:53:07] what i call greasy grace
[2:53:10] or easy grace
[2:53:12] are you with me amen oh it's the grace
[2:53:16] of god this is favor god loves us god
[2:53:18] don't care god don't get god cares
[2:53:22] he's a righteous god
[2:53:25] amen he's a righteous judge
[2:53:28] but you see they'll invent a grace that
[2:53:30] is far beyond what god ever intended
[2:53:34] god now his grace never leads says he
[2:53:37] gives us a license to sin but the grace
[2:53:39] of god always
[2:53:41] leads to repentance
[2:53:43] that's what grace does it doesn't cover
[2:53:46] your sin it leads you to repentance of
[2:53:49] sin so the blood of jesus can annihilate
[2:53:51] it amen
[2:53:54] let me just as we're trying to close
[2:53:57] but did you know that brother ron
[2:53:58] spencer was contacted by his insurer the
[2:54:01] other day

[2:54:04] agency and an insurance company their
[2:54:07] church has had
[2:54:08] for over 30 years
[2:54:12] and and i'm just going to say it like
[2:54:15] this
[2:54:17] he told him he could not use his insurer
[2:54:21] his agent said you cannot use the word
[2:54:24] the h word in your pulpit anymore
[2:54:32] are you lose your insurance
[2:54:36] he can use sodom and gomorrah but not
[2:54:39] the h word
[2:54:40] why
[2:54:41] it's the time where the voice of
[2:54:44] iniquity
[2:54:45] and the man of sin is being manifest
[2:54:50] it's where the man of sin the spirit of
[2:54:52] lawlessness is now what's being
[2:54:56] put out there

[2:55:02] censored the other day and his service
[2:55:04] that was being streamed on foot on
[2:55:06] social media was cut off because he said

[2:55:15] justices with their with their homes
[2:55:18] being picketed and riots it's just like

[2:55:23] appeared as men to have sex with them
[2:55:27] and they refused virgin girls that was
[2:55:30] offered to them
[2:55:35] you see they're giving voice to the man
[2:55:37] of sin
[2:55:39] they are giving voice to sodom
[2:55:42] do you know when a supreme court nominee
[2:55:44] cannot define a woman

[2:56:00] and girls masculine they are giving
[2:56:03] voice to sodom

[2:56:08] their hairdos and with their dress
[2:56:11] it is a voice it is more than something
[2:56:14] cute
[2:56:15] it is a voice of sodom
[2:56:19] do you know when the holy ghost the
[2:56:21] token comes upon your life it'll make a
[2:56:24] girl feminine and a man masculine
[2:56:27] the holy ghost will do that
[2:56:30] amen do you know this is the most
[2:56:32] important time ever to be given voice to
[2:56:35] righteousness
[2:56:37] at this junction we dare not give sodom
[2:56:41] a voice

[3:01:50] again and it comes against sobriety in
[3:01:53] an ecclesiastical manner with every kind
[3:01:56] of demon anointing coming against her to
[3:01:59] keep her out of the promised land
[3:02:03] is somebody with me now
[3:02:05] amen you see it was a religious sect
[3:02:08] that could not go to the other side
[3:02:10] but you think they will repent
[3:02:12] they won't repent
[3:02:14] they've already crossed the line
[3:02:17] there's no going back for them you think
[3:02:19] americans can't repent america can't
[3:02:22] repent you think the world will repent
[3:02:24] the world can't repent that's right
[3:02:29] revelation 9 20
[3:02:31] and the rest of these men was not killed
[3:02:33] by the plagues
[3:02:34] i want you to see it
[3:02:36] there was no spirit of repentance
[3:02:41] no apologies
[3:02:45] no remorse
[3:02:48] that they
[3:02:49] they which were killed by these plagues
[3:02:51] yet repented not of the works of their
[3:02:53] hands
[3:02:55] that they should not worship devils
[3:02:58] and idols of gold and silver and brass
[3:03:00] and stone and wood which can neither see
[3:03:02] or hear or walk
[3:03:06] and that's how
[3:03:07] revelation
[3:03:09] 9
[3:03:10] ends neither repented
[3:03:12] they are their murders
[3:03:15] nor of their sorceries
[3:03:18] nor of their fornications
[3:03:21] gnar of their thefts
[3:03:24] unrepented men
[3:03:27] who will not turn around
[3:03:30] who have spurned their day of grace
[3:03:34] possessed by demon powers
[3:03:40] demon spirits
[3:03:42] can i go just a little further
[3:03:45] insanity
[3:03:47] perversion
[3:03:48] they've taken over our colleges
[3:03:51] they're taking over our schools
[3:03:53] they've taken over our politics
[3:03:56] right now in our nations the second
[3:03:58] amendment is under attack spirit of
[3:04:00] lawlessness
[3:04:02] wanting to strip our country of its
[3:04:04] rights to defend
[3:04:06] from tyranny
[3:04:08] our president said we don't want we
[3:04:10] shouldn't own a gun like that we
[3:04:12] shouldn't have this
[3:04:14] you know we don't need that to to to to
[3:04:16] to stop a robbery in our home
[3:04:18] that's not what the second amendment's
[3:04:20] about the second amendment is about
[3:04:24] protecting ourselves from a tyranny from
[3:04:27] a government
[3:04:28] that is running wild
[3:04:34] that's why that we have the right to
[3:04:36] bear arms
[3:04:37] but they want to disarm our country
[3:04:40] and they will satan wants to disarm you
[3:04:44] hear me now i'm bringing this right
[3:04:45] around now satan wants to disarm you
[3:04:49] you see he wants to remove the
[3:04:51] omnipotent power of the word
[3:04:56] and leave you something less than a
[3:04:58] baseball bat or you know some some
[3:05:00] little something to try to protect
[3:05:02] yourself and where there's no power in
[3:05:04] the word there's no divine healing
[3:05:06] there's no miracles
[3:05:08] there's no signs and wonders there's no
[3:05:10] praise there's no shadow of the king
[3:05:13] there's nothing in it because satan
[3:05:15] wants to disarm
[3:05:18] the bride of jesus christ
[3:05:21] and it's our inalienable right
[3:05:25] it is our right to have divine healing
[3:05:29] it is our right to have the holy ghost
[3:05:32] it is our right to have the power of god
[3:05:35] it is our right to have delivered from
[3:05:38] sin it is our right
[3:05:46] but i want to just close this morning
