========================================

my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornications verse 15 so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saveth him that receiveth it amen I pray that the Lord will add His blessings as you have your seats tonight and as we look at this we're going to look at some things and maybe like I said a lot of it may be very informational as we go down through the history of maybe ancient religions such as Babylon and things like that um but but what we want to see is how this glorious gospel that started out there on the book of Acts and its perfect truth ends up in a situation where it is today where people are so far off from that original word what was it that that took it in that direction how did we get to where we're at today and just a quick reminder here as we look at the the map of Asia Minor we're studying about pergamus here on this map in the northern part it is is called pergamum which was the ancient name for it it is the same place and this age would be between the years 312 and 606 ad for those of you who know a little bit about history this would be during the time of the fall of what we would call the Roman Empire during this time uh Pagan Rome or the Roman Empire is actually in Decline and and is and is falling um the messenger of this age the messenger of this age is Martin brother brandham says using our god-given rule for choosing the messenger to each age that is we choose the one whose Ministry most closely approximates that of the first messenger Paul we unhesitatingly declare the pergan messenger to be Martin and I I wanted to say as as we start this I want us to remember that we are studying an age so we're studying a period of time okay and and and and things that happened during that age and yet at times it may seem like we're studying a city okay and the reason for that is because I guess in some ways we are but it's because the the seven churches in these Seven Cities had characteristics that would be manifested later in this time period period that we're studying so brother Bram said it like this he said the seven churches were especially picked from all other churches for their characteristics which same characteristics would be found in the successive ages centuries later and just for an example to bring it down to what we're trying to say we we read about the leoan church that was just a church in a city there in Asia Minor 1900 years ago but now we are living in the age that that church represented okay and the characteristics of that church are now coming to fruition in the very age that we live in so sometimes don't lose sight of the fact that we're studying what took place in in a time period and in an age so so what we're going to try to do is take all the scripture and what it said about that church and then relate it all and see how it unfolds in time and how it unfill how how it fulfills what was spoken in Prophecy so back to Martin Luther brother Bram said by signs and wonders by by the by the by excuse me Martin by signs and wonders by the power of the spirit Martin was truly Vindicated as the messenger of that age but not only was he gifted by a great ministry he himself was forever true to the word of God he fought organization he with stood sin in high places he championed the truth in word and deed and lived out a full life of Christian Victory and and one thing I want to say is I want that to be the testimony of me when I'm gone that not no matter what Deeds no matter what powerful things may it be said that I lived out a full life of Christian Victory amen and one of the things that we read tonight we're going to start in verse 13 and we're going to talk about where Satan's SE seed is because he says here I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan SE seed is and thou holdest fast my name and H has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth now there's some interesting things said in here that we want to get into because pergamus was not the original seat of Satan it's always been been been known that Babylon had always been literally and figuratively his headquarter ERS it was in Babylon that satanic worship had its origin now we're going way back before the church ages here we're going back to the Book of Genesis it was in Babylon that Satan worship had its origin and and and I want us to see in scripture and in history that that the things that we teach you because sometimes I understand I was raised in the message and sometimes you're like well that's our idea that's what we believe and true we do but what I want us to see is in scripture and in history that what we hold to as the truth is found there what we hold to in truth is found in the scriptures what we hold to as truth is found in the histories the errors of the Catholic church and the the denominational world can be found in history um these aren't just our ideas and and what we preach so if we if we'll go back and look in Genesis 10 8 through1 it says and Kush begat Nimrod he be began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said even as Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Eric and aad and Kaa in the land of shanar so we we know here if we if we know our Sunday school lesson and you uh if you remember from back in your days in Sunday school we find over in Genesis 11 that the whole earth spoke one language and the whole whole earth spoke one language and there in sh shanar they they began to build a city and a tower we in Sunday school we would know it as the the Tower of Babel okay and and they began to build this Tower but God knew that their intention was for evil he knew it wasn't for good it was it was so if the floods ever came again they could live their life however they wanted and they could run up in this Tower and Escape judgment but it was also it was a monument to man it was a Monument to to how great that they thought they were and God knew that their intention was for evil and so he allows their their tongues to be confused and the people there to be scattered Babel is the original name for Babylon all right so when we talk about satanic worship beginning in Babylon this is where we're taking it it means confusion it was founded by Kush the son of ham and it was brought to Power by Nimrod the son of kush and so what we want to see is how did the seed of Satan and here's what we're focusing on here as it relates to the Affairs of man and to the Affairs of worship go from Babylon to where here in the scripture God is saying that it's in pergamus that this is the seed of Satan what how did this transfer happen and what was this Babylonian religion how then did did did the religion of Babylon then become intertwined with Christianity to to form the hybrid thing that people today call Christianity we're going to continue to look here at Nimrod and and his desires says Nimrod set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did and he wanted to to make a name for himself which he also accomplished during this time Babylon became the very head of gold amongst the world governments you know the vision there in the Bible where where the statue was made of different materials and the head of gold was at the top that was the Babylonian Kingdom and and his religion invaded the whole world and it became the basis the basis of every system of idolatry and the theme for all mythology if you ever studied mythology in school you can trace it back to Babylon if you've ever studied any idolatry you can trace it back to Babylon it all goes back to Babylon and and when you study those things the names of gods they may differ depending on the language that the people speak um but it was all started in Babylon and it's still in practice to this day and so brother Bron would pick up on this and he would say ancient histories agree with the Bible that this babylonish religion was most certainly not the original religion of Earth's early people it was the first to drift away from the original Faith but it was not the original one so we know that this religion to where they worshiped many gods was not original it wasn't so from the beginning this religion where they worshiped nature was not the original that was not the original most religious historians say that originally the people of Earth worshiped one God so if we're going to go back to the original just like we always talk about as it relates to the New Testament going back to Pentecost and and going back to the original if we're going to trace it far enough back you got to go beyond Babylon to get back to the original worship original worship was the worship of one God Supreme eternal invisible who by the word of his mouth spoke all things into existence and that in his character he was loving and good and just that is the original religion of the world and of mankind but as always Satan will always try to corrupt he's not going to be happy seeing God receiving praise he's not going to be happy seeing God was because that's what Satan wanted even in the beginning is he wanted worship he wanted to be praise and I want to remind you tonight that still what he wants be careful where your life gives praise not just on I know we come here and we praise God on Wednesdays and we praise God on Sundays but what where is your time going on Monday and where is your time going on Tuesday and Thursday and Friday and Saturday is your lifegiving praise is it split between God and Satan because Satan is always after your praise he's after your time and your devotion and he wants you and when you give time to him and you give time to his idols and you give time to the things of the world you're getting praise drawn away from God and drawn to the devil he wants to draw worship away from the one true and living God and and so what he does here in Babylon what's the point of it what's the point of this false religion by setting up his own false religion that he's the author of then not only does it draw worship away from God but it now draws worship unto himself it's being drawn to himself and brother Bram says monotheism if you don't know monotheism mono means one that's that's a religion where there's one God turn to polytheism the worship of many gods in babyon the devil's lie and the devil's Mysteries rose up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in that City just some things I want to point out and see if it sounds famili familiar to you in Babylon now this is way before Christianity they had mother and child Worship in the form of the Goddess the mother of Babylon s sarus and her son nenus history shows us that ninus was actually Nimrod his father was kush and he was the father of the polytheistic system by which man began to worship many gods there in Babylon they began to worship their ancestors they began to worship nature it was in Babylon that Gods became identified with the sun and gods became identified with the moon creatures were worshiped in Babylon and we see over in pergamus we covered this last time that in the city of pergamus they actually had a live serpent in the temple that they would worship so it came all the way to the place where the very creature that represented the devil was now in the temple receiving worship and the reason I'm going through all this is just to tie in so you understand that all the idolatry and the things that we see in so-called Christianity Today has its roots and it ties in Babylon it has its roots and it ties in the tradition of paganism there's no place in Christianity for it Kush was called Bale and Bale in Roman mythology was Janice brother brandham says he is pictured as having two faces he carried a club by which he confounded and Scattered the people exactly what happened there at the tower he says thus that we find that kush of the Bible the original rebel against monotheism was called Bell Bellis Hermes Janice Etc among the ancient peoples he purported to bring Revelations and interpretations from the gods to the people in so doing he calls the wrath of God to scatter the people bringing Division and confusion brother Brown says says the polytheistic religion of the enemy began with the trinitarian doctrine it was way back there in Antiquity that the one God and three persons idea came into existence now how was this Trinity expressed it was expressed by an equilateral triangle even as it is expressed in Rome today strange the Hebrews did not have such a concept now who is right the Hebrews are the Babylonians so here we are in the in the third Age and and way past Babylon and we're here in the third age and it's very easy for the pagans to accept Christianity wrapped up in all this ancient Pagan ritual and tradition it wasn't no big leap for them to accept the Trinity it was no big leap for them to accept a holy mother or praying to Saints or praying to ancestors because it's what they they had always done this is how they had always worshiped but now if you just take Christian names and add it to the form they've always been following it was easy to make that transition it was simple for them they already worshiped the great God mother they already worshiped the son God there was already a place of worship for the gods and their sons brother brandham says this just remember this one thing from now on I want you to take this because you can apply this to any aspect of your life these records are facts and this is a fact Satan is a liar and the father of lies and whenever he comes with light it is still a lie notice even if it's light it's still a lie because he cannot tell the truth he's a murderer and his doctrine of the Trinity has destroyed the multitudes and will destroy until Jesus comes now we see why when we read the scripture sometimes when you see why the scripture would speak so against Babylon why isn't it calling out and saying Rome because where did this stuff originate at it originates in Babylon you we see Satan identified with Babylon in Isaiah 14 we see him all say uh uh identified in Revelation 17 and 18 why because Babylon is where it all began Babylon was the seat of Satan so then why and we come back to where we started does it say here I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days where in Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth well the Bible is not talking about Babylon here it's talking about pergamus so why because as the religion of Babylon had spread across the world it had taken a great stronghold there in the city of pergamus and brother brandham says that Babylonian priest had fled from Babylon when it was conquered by the mes and by the Persians and they had come to pergamus and it had now become the very headquarters of their worship from where they pushed out their religion so as they fled Babylon they came and they brought their rights and they brought their rituals and they bought their traditions and they set up here amongst other pagan people and from here it began to spread and so I began to do some digging and I found this very interesting in history history tells us plainly that it was through the relationship with pergamus that the religion of baby Babylon began to grow strong and take control of Rome so it's connect the dots you got you got Babylon and then we see it over here in Rome but the dot in between was pergamus and I found this in history I found this very interesting it says the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage was still continuing and they consulted the holy books so Rome consults their holy books known as the cilon books and they found verses saying that if a foreigner were to make war on Italy he would be defeated if the matrium Magna idea that's a language I don't speak but interpreted the great mother Godus was brought to Rome additionally an unusual number of meteor showers had been seen the interpretation from the Oracle was that Rome needed to start a cult in Rome to the mother goddess in order to win the war so according to historian Livy adelus who is the priest brother brandham actually speaks of in the church AG book receives a delegation from Rome and hands over to them the sacred stone trace it back from pergamus to Babylon and now here's the Romans in pergamus and the Very priest hands over the sacred stone which the natives declared to be the mother of God and B them carry it to Rome the ancient goddess cbel was thus introduced to Rome as the Magna or the great mother well no wonder that they pray to the mother of God no wonder Mary is worshiped it just carries right back over into the paganism it says right here brother brandham actually said this and I didn't find it till I got down to the end of the chapter but I already read this and he says it almost identically this comes from history it says when atalis the pontiff the king of pergamus died in BC 1 33 he bequeathed the headship of the Babylonian priesthood to Rome when the austraian came to Italy from Lydia the region of pergamus they brought with them the Babylonian religion and rights they set up a pontiff who was head of the priesthood later the Romans accepted this pontis as their civil ruler Julius Caesar was made pontiff of the order in BC 74 in BC 63 he was made Supreme pontiff of the Babylonian order thus becoming heir to the rights of the title of atalis pontiff of pergamus who made Rome his Heir by Will thus the first Roman Emperor became the head of the Babylonian priesthood and Rome the successor of Babylon these things aren't just made up these things are in history now it's clear how the succession of pagan polytheistic worship started in Babylon and ends up with its seat and its power in Rome which we're going to see later as we begin to move into this now becomes intermingled with Christianity to form what we know today is the Roman Catholic Church Revelations 2:14 he says but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed under Idol and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate so in this age what we find is God denounces two doctrines the doctrine of balum which caused Israel to fall into idolatry and the doctrine of the nians which had only been needs in the deeds in the Ephesian age if you'll remember you've heard about we've preached a lot about nicians and nianis but before this it was only Deeds but now it has grown to a place where it's known as doctrines when when we see the denouncement there in verse 14 and 15 and it's telling us that in this age there's those in the church that have the doctrine of Baum and there's those in the church that have the doctrine of the nicians and we see that God also calls it the seed of Satan it becomes quite clear that the religion of Babylon has already taken a hold of the church at this point it's no longer a pure church I it's no longer just the the True Vine as we would say but how how did it get to this place how here in the third age has the false Vine gotten such a tight grip how has this ancient religion of Babylon gotten so ingrained in the church that started out pure we're talking about we're we're literally just a couple hundred years away from the day of Pentecost and yet how has it got to this place brother brandham goes into it here and describes it so it's quite easy to understand he says when the Christians mainly Jews by birth understand originally most Christians were Jews okay so when the Christians mainly Jews by birth were scattered abroad from Jerusalem they went everywhere preaching the gospel particularly in synagogues well what kind of people would you find in synagogues Jews so the majority of their converts were once again Jews now this is building up to something the th within 3 years or about in 36 ad the gospel had been taken to Rome by Junius and by adronicus and you find their names there in Romans 16:7 Paul says salute andronicus and junea for my Kinsmen my Kinsmen and my fellow prisoners who are note among the apostles so they're called Apostles they were brought the gospel who also were in Christ before me so as Paul writes this letter to the Romans he addresses and us and Junius as brothers and apostles and and because they they were there in the work in Rome and what happened in Rome as the gospel flourished the church was flourishing I mean this wasn't some little work there I mean but Paul wrote a letter to the Romans there was quite a work there there was a church there that was flourishing and growing but the problem was it's it's not necessarily a problem but it becomes a problem that the majority of the church there was Jews and the Jews were having great troubles amongst themselves there were factions and they were arguing and some of it was over Christianity some of it was just over Jewish things right cultural things but also there was a great movement amongst the Jews that were fighting for more what we would call um political freedoms within the city of Rome and it was causing a political upheaval so in order to deal with this Emperor Claudius just says we're going to expel all Jews from the city no Jew can stay in in the city and all Jews are kicked out of Rome they're gone so without the Jews there what's left behind is a very small fragment of the Church of Rome the the Christian church that had been there and it had a great impact because most of the Christians are now gone most of the early leaders of this church were Jews and now the leaders of the church are gone and because of this brother Bram says with the Jews banished from the city the backbone of that little church was practically broken perhaps even the elders had been Jewish and so they would be gone the flock would be unattended and since the word had not been written as a god it would be very easy for this little flock to drift or be inundated by the philosophers and the pagans of that day in other words the elders that were there to keep the Wolves Out weren't there the ones that were there to to teach them in the word and teach them the truth weren't there so even the though these were believers they were easily swayed by Winds of Doctrine they were easily swayed when somebody said well doesn't this make sense and doesn't this make sense and the elders weren't there to protect them from these teachings and without proper leadership the church in Rome began to slide into false doctrines it began to slide into paganism and Pagan rituals began to come into church under Christian titles things that we spent the first 15 20 minutes talking about things from Babylon now just rebranded with new names and packaged as the gospel and these people it was easy for them to take that step because it was familiar it was something that they knew and then after 13 years andronicus and Junius are allowed back in the city and they come back to Rome only to find altars set up in the church where incense is burned and and Pagan rituals are carried out out to ancestors brother brandham says the established leaders of the church now we're talking about the church at Rome there's new leadership now there there's been 13 years without the elders W without the the the the ones that were grounded in the gospel and new leaders have risen up and they're not the good kind he says these established leaders of that church could not be approached in other words what are we dealing with here nickan ISM we're the priest you can't come talk to us this is how we do it y'all they were unapproachable they had been separated into a different class so with the few who had tried to remain faithful they started a new church or the second Church of Rome and God graciously worked amongst them by signs and wonders so that they grew in even a third church was started brother Brown says and though the first church was reproached for being Pagan and not Christian in its worship it would not give give up its title but remained and Still Remains The First Church of Rome the Roman Catholic Church that church became the Roman Catholic church but what stood out to me right here is it says with the few who had tried to remain faithful that they started a new church and God graciously worked among them listen if you'll remain faithful it doesn't matter what everybody else is doing if you'll remain faithful it doesn't matter what this chur church is doing or that church you know what let's let's go beyond that let's bring it down individual it don't matter what your friend is doing or what this is doing if you'll remain faithful God will work in your life God will move in your life if you will just remain faithful and true to the word that first church began to thrive now when we use the word Thrive here we don't mean spiritually we mean they began to become powerful the first church began to thrive and multiply so in numbers that the Emperors and various officials of the government actually favored that church for political reasons now this is where the church gains real power once again not power from God but power from man thus when the leaders of the First Church of Rome found themselves in favor they took the opportunity to turn the government against the True Believers and demand their persecution unless they came into their fold they recognized that their numbers had grown so big that they had great political power because they had influence and they had wealth and they begin to turn the government against the True Vine we can take this all the way back we've been teaching about the True Vine and false Vine all the way back to the Book of Genesis and that false Vine hates that True Vine and it begins to turn the power of the government against the True Vine and begin to persecute them and polycarp who's one that we've spoken briefly about traveled 1500 miles to come to Rome to try to speak to the leaders of this first church to plead with them to not go down this road to turn from their Wicked Ways to to get away from the paganism and things of that nature when he gets there he Witnesses for himself so-called Christians bowing before images named after Apostles and Saints burning candles and incense upon the altars celebrating Passover in the name of Easter brother Brown says God spoke through him just as he was leaving from Hosea 4 said Ephraim is married to his idols let him alone and polycarp leaves and never returns so this brings us to a place a term you may hear if you've ever studied even American history a little bit we would say the separation of church in state and what that's talking about is religious Affairs and political Affairs are not supposed to be intertwined but what we find here is the marriage of church and state when the true church would not incorporate Pagan festivals and worship the false Vine would use their power in government to bring persecution they would not they would not do as he requested so he prevailed upon the government officials to persecute the Believers hailing them into court casting them into prison and even meeting out death to many brother Brown says for syus Severus was prevailed upon by kalistus to kill 7,000 at thessalonica because these True Believers celebrated the Passover according to the Lord Jesus not according to the worship of a starte listen I've said it a bunch of times I want to say it again don't ever forget what other people have had to go through just to worship God don't take for granted the fact that you're sitting here tonight and free Freedom don't take for granted that we can gather on Wednesday and Sunday and worship god with our whole heart openly and and unashamed and unafraid people have given their life by the millions by the millions just to call on the name of Jesus and in this time that's what's going on already the false Vine was turning loose it's anger against the Living God by killing the elect even as did its forbearer Cain kill Abel it embarked upon a constant campaign to discredit the true seed they claimed that they and they alone were the true representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ and vaunted the fact that they were the original Church in Rome and they alone were the first church so here we are in the middle of the third age and we have two churches bearing the same name two churches claiming to be the Church of God the true church one is a hybrid that has drifted away from the word and taken in Pagan ritual and Pagan worship mixed with Christian ideas and she has all the signs of death following her the other is the true vine persecuted and hated but she stays true to the word brother brand says she follows the word and the signs follow her amen Hey listen if you stay true to the word if it's all about the word and you're faithful to the word the signs follow the word brother BR says the sick are healed the dead are raised she is alive with the life and the word of God she loves not her life but holds to his name and his faith even unto death let that be our testimony tonight we hold to his word we hold to his faith and the signs follow amen around this time there comes what seems to be a great reprieve we're we're in the in the in the fourth century and Constantine Rises to power and he grants religious freedom in the year 313 and although it ended the heavy persecution for a period of time it actually led to an even greater marriage between church and state which as I said are political Affairs and spiritual Affairs because Constantine felt that he could help the church by bringing all the people together both sides bringing them all together in this great big Fellowship to settle the growing divide amongst the Christians on many issues it was Constantine who called for the nine Council of 325 he thought he could bring all the groups together and they could iron out their differences and they could all be one now I know that sounds fine and dandy but it it'll never be so because the True Vine and false Vine can never be one it can never happen but the very name pergamus means thoroughly married and indeed State and church were married politics and religion were United The Offspring of that Union have been consistently the most horrible hybrids the world has ever seen the truth is not in them but all the evil ways of Cain the first hybrid is so the power of the emperor Constantine is now coming together with the influence and the power of that first church they're already powerful and Constantine feels like he can help and and this is the true marriage of church and state and so after nah what you find is things that were debated are now put down in iron and as Doctrine the trinitarian doctrine is now totally entrenched into Christianity and forced upon the people because now it has the power of the emperor behind it now it has the power of the government behind it now the only truth is the trinitarian doctrine you must accept the trinitarian doctrine it is infor is forced upon the people in their worship it's forced upon the people in their baptism prayer to Saints and to Mary are are now not only common practice but it's Doctrine and it's expected because the government is now behind it the emperor is now behind it and brother Bram says and right in this age now remember I mentioned earlier this is during the fall of the Roman Empire and right in this age is when the Beast of Revelation 13 and3 that was wounded to death and and we'll get to it in a minute I believe we'll have we'll read it the Beast that was wounded to death that was the Pagan Roman Empire comes back to life and power as the Holy Roman Empire Rome as a material Nation had suffered much depletion and soon would suffer it completely in other words that Empire was falling but it mattered not now for her religious Empire would keep her on top of the world governing from the inside where she would not appear to do so from the outside just so you have a a brief understanding the Roman Empire when we talk about the Roman Empire we're not talking about the pope and the church and the Bishops and the Cardinals we're not talking about that we're talking about the military power that ruled the the world that's known as Pagan Rome and at at the same time as it was collapsing that's the time that we see what they call the Holy Roman Empire rise into power now things like the Roman Catholic Church the Pope the priest and all that n so it spoke of in the Book of Revelation when there was a deadly wound given to the beast but then the wound is healed right Pagan Rome is killed but paple Holy Roman Empire raises up in its place and so that's kind of what we're speaking of right here the decline and fall of the Roman Empire Pagan Imperial Rome Civil Wars had weakened it Foreign Wars had weakened it social and financial crisises had weakened it corrupt and poor leadership had weakened it and it was collapsing and we see its collapse even here in Revelation 13 and I stood upon the land of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his 10 horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a Lon and the dragon gave him his power where's the power for this Empire come from the dragon and his seat and great Authority the Roman Empire it was great great Authority but look in the next verse and I saw one of his heads as it was wounded to death the fall of the Roman Empire and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast now you have the church rising up in power whereas militarily it no longer is and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast so so in this age as the Pagan Roman Empire start to crumble and the city of Rome itself Falls it's it's sacked by the vandals and and the the city itself Falls then papal or false Christian Rome Rises out of those ashes and it rises into power to the point that today Rome is known as the Eternal City think about that what blasphemy talking about it had names of blasphemy what blasphemy there's but one Eternal City and I can promise you Rome is not it Rome the Eternal City and it looked like Rome was finished but when Constantine joined church and state when he brought them together it gave Rome a new lease on life it gave them another opportunity to flourish and now paple Rome or false Christian Rome or what we would call as the Holy Roman Empire would rule by religion more than it had ever ruled by its military it would conquer more take more destroy more divide more than its military had ever done the power of the church brother Brown says the name Christian which originally brought persecution now think about this now became the name of the persecutors it was in this age that Augustine of Hippo set forth the precept that the church ought and must use Force if necessary to bring her children back into the fold and that it was in harmony with the word of God to kill the Heretics and apostates they literally taught that they were helping you by killing you it was the only way to bring you salvation it was the only way to bring you back into the fold so if you didn't see it the way they saw it and you wouldn't accept it then you know it's God's will that we kill you in order that you might possibly obtain some sort of Salvation in all this and so they began to teach this that it was actually in harmony with the word of God to kill the Heretics and who were Heretics anybody who didn't accept the Trinity Doctrine anybody who didn't lift up the Church of Rome as the great and all powerful and the and the mother of all anybody who didn't you know Elevate Satan to the place that he wanted to be elevated were Heretics in other words the True Vine was Heretics and during this time their thirst for blood was growing the false Vine attacked every way it could using the power of government and the law to persecute the True Vine and so what we'll find if you do any study on your own is that from this point on especially through the Dark Ages the false Vine will persecute and destroy the children of the True Vine and yet the whole time claiming the exact same father just like ishmail and Isaac claiming that they're the church brother Brown says the darkness of spiritual corruption will deepen and the True Light Of God will fade until number-wise it glows ever so faintly yet the promise of God will hold true the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness can do nothing about it aren't you glad tonight to hear that that in the midst of all this chaos and in the midst of the darkness I know it was dark then and it's a different type of persecution but it's never been darker than it than it is right now and he says the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness can do nothing about it listen the whole world has gone mad the whole world has gone into complete chaos the the whole world is Tainted with this false Babylonian religion the the people of the world have given their mind over to the Beast right now I'm speaking of right now's condition their mind has been given over to the Beast and yet in the midst of all that the light shineth in darkness it shall be light in the evening time listen that's the word of God you can count on it you just hold true Little Flock you just stand true no matter what others do no matter what others proclaim the light will shine in darkness and darkness can do nothing about it I'm thankful for that that it has no power over Sons and Daughters of the light the doctrine of the Nicko Revelations 2:15 says so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate so if we find that he hates it I think we should hate it and if he hates it we should know exactly what it is and I know we've covered this a bit we covered it in the Ephesian age and then we talked about how nickan was a combination of two words two Greek words which meant to conquer coner the Ley okay to conquer the Ley so we're going to look at the doctrine of the nicians here for a minute he says it is terrible because God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness he has placed his church in the care of God ordained Spirit-filled word living men who lead people through feeding them them with the word amen listen nickan ISM wants to divide people it wants to separate people it wants to put people in different classes and you have to come under me because of the position that I hold God doesn't separate people into classes so that the masses are led by a few power hungry individuals that's not how God operates about power hungry and politically motivated who are considered holier than those that they lead that is not God's way it is not scripture that this priest is more holy than all the people that he feeds communion to that's not scriptural sure leadership should be holy but so should the whole congregation be holy sure leadership should live a holy life but so should the whole congregation live a holy life the the scripture doesn't teach that Ministry is to mediate between God and the people it doesn't teach that the ministry isn't SE separated in its worship from the people we're to worship together we're all to worship God together there is no levels to it brother Bram says God wants all to love and serve him together nican ISM destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people listen there are Ministries out there or let's let not put on ministers people in general who don't understand how it's supposed to work ministers are servants it is not to be put on a pedestal if you don't want to be a servent you don't want to be in ministry that's what it's about okay that's where it's supposed to be God wants all to love and serve him together nickon destroys these precepts and instead SE separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of what's it say the ministers are instead of servants well I'm a minister I'm the minister so I get to do I'm a minister so I get I no you're a minister serve we get that out of balance we get we get that messed up in our head of how it's supposed to work they overlords instead of servants ministers are to be yes yes there's a respect for the office don't I'm not taking that away surely you got enough sense to see that but it's not some Overlord you must listen to me and I'm holier than you and this that's not how we're in this together we're fighting this battle together and you are every bit as important as I am and I'm as important as everybody and we're in this together and I can't make it without you and you can't make it without me and God doesn't divide us into classes of people for our work worship that's not how it is this isn't about one man and one group of men over lord and over another or one Ministry over lord and over other Ministries G listen that's chains that's denominations Jesus came to set us free from all that nonsense he came to set us free from that so you could be free not so man could rule over you not so a church could rule over you so you could serve him in Freedom so you could serve him and worship him and spirit and worship him in Truth Listen to what it says in 1 Peter 2:9 ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood you are a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light what's he say in Revelation 1:6 and has made us Kings and priest we're all to enter into this together but what they did here is they began to set up offices of authority that weren't scriptural they set up Bishops who would have authority over the local leaders in each congregation so you may have a minister or an elder here that was over this church but then somewhere there was a bishop who was over all the Ministers of the 10 churches in this area and then somewhere there was an Archbishop that was over all the Bishops and then it was this hierarchy of power and political and political minded thinking Bishops decided who would rise up in the ministry who would be in power in this area and the whole hierarchy was set up for what purpose to control the people listen we are to be controlled by the Holy Spirit you are to be controlled and be submissive and yes you you are to come under a pastor there there's no doubt we're not trying to get those things confused but we're talking about it's not a hierarchy of authority placed by man God calls his men into position God puts leadership into men's life we're not placing men into those positions so instead of God called holy spirit-led leadership in each local assembly you had a headquarters somewhere and you were told exactly how and when things should be done brother Brown says men began to VI for the off office of Bishop with the result that this position was being given to the more educ ated and the more materially Progressive and politically minded men so what happens when it comes that way then no longer is the qualification for a bishop or Minister uh a dedicated God Called Life but it's who's the most educated who can operate in this ceremony the best who who who knows the rituals and and who's connected most in politics and so suddenly you ended up with a cage of every unclean and hateful bird every spirit and operating in high places brother Brown says with man-made doctrines of the elevation of Bishops to a place not according to them in scripture The Next Step was the handing out of graded titles that built into a religious hierarchy for soon there were archbishops over Bishops and Cardinals over the archbishops and by the time of the bonfice III there was a pope over all or a pontiff that we already talked about the pontiff or the priesthood of Babylon and just so you'd have an understanding of what this looks like here's how it's set up so if you were a Catholic tonight you'd be at the very bottom of all this and that's where you're at in their world and over you is priest and then over priest are Bishops and then over the Bishops are archbishops and then over the archbishops are Cardinals and over all of them is the Pope and it's trickle down effect and you have no say in anything you can't even talk to God for yourself it takes a priest to mediate for you and and you have to tell him all your problems and all your you have no direct relationship with God at all they took it all from the people and they set up this hierarchy brother Bram says thus that which started as a deed in the first age notice it was a deed was made a literal Doctrine and and so it is today Bishops still claim power to control men and deal with them as they desire placing them wherever they so will in the ministry this denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost who said separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work where unto I have called them this is anti- word and anti-christ listen I just I went to Matthew 23 and8 because you know in this it's the the the you got the Bishops and the archbishops and they call them Father this and father that but Matthew 23 and8 Jesus says but be not ye called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are Brethren and call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be ye called Masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest of among you shall be your servant how was it that Pagan Rome the Roman Empire came to power divide and conquer how is it that the Christian Empire or paple Rome did it they divided nickan ISM divide and conquer levels divide the people separate the people into different levels and then conquer the leoty that's exactly the same spirit and tactic they use to conquer the world militarily is the exact same thing they Ed in the religious world to conquer the world divide and conquer they excommunicated all the righteous leaders they burned the Scrolls they said it took special education to understand the word they took the word out of the hands of the common people so now your only sword would be what the priest tells you you had no way to know and then the word was only written in Latin so the common people a lot of times couldn't even read it they had no idea what it said you weren't even allowed to have it you had to trust what the priest told you he says having taken away the word from the people it soon came to the people it soon came to the people listening only to what the priest had to say and doing what he told them them they called that God and His holy word they took over the minds and lives of the people and made them the Servants of a despotic priesthood and so today we find that the Roman Catholic Church calls herself the mother church and no doubt she is she is the mother Church she was the original church that that backslid away from the gospel she was the first church of Rome and in her was found the deeds and the doctrines of the nickan as a mother she has produced daughters all the churches that have come out of her and then turned and went right back under her spirit of organization or her daughters theyve went right back to the spirit of organization Nicol latinism and God says I hate it he hates that Spirit he hates that spirit that would come in and control when he says come out of her my people he says come out of her my people people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you be not partakers and receive of her plagues and listen I want to charge you no matter how long time terries no matter how long we stay here upon the Earth no matter how long this goes on because we don't know how long it will be no matter who comes or goes no matter what Doctrine dries up you remember this you are free you are a free people and you are to remain a free people you're not to come underneath some headship come underneath some headquarters you are to be led by the Holy Ghost led by Holy Ghost filled ministry that's what you are to be led by Stand Fast in that Liberty don't ever go back into that don't ever go back into something that would bind down your worship clamp down on how you're supposed to serve God but you fight for whatever you have to fight and and however you have to fight in order to stay free no matter how long time terries because that Spirit of denominationalism that Spirit of nianis will come around and try to reclaim people but you got to say no I ain't I ain't standing for that I ain't falling for that but I'm going to remain free Amen brother Brown says no wonder people are mixed up today if they were so mixed up then so close to Pentecost now they are in a most desperate condition about 2,000 years away from the original truth oh Church of God there is only one hope get back to the word and stay with it get back to the word I'm I've said this before I'm going to say it again and I don't mean this negative towards Ministry I'd be throwing shade at myself if if that was the case but if the ministry can stand up here and preach false Doctrine to you service after service after service after service and you don't catch it that's your fault there is a feeding that you are supposed to do there you are supposed to be in the word you were supposed to be feeding you were supposed to be digging it shouldn't come as a surprise that oh wait we've been hearing false stuff all this time you should recognize it right off the bat something don't sound right that trumpet don't give a certain sound something's wrong with that you ought to be in the word enough to recognize when something isn't right get back to the word he says and stick and stay with it another doctrine that he says he hates is the doctrine of balum and I'm sorry that on the right for some reason doesn't show up I'll read it to you Revelation 2:14 he says but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed un idols and to commit fornication and the quote here says you see now listen close we're going to get into a few things right here as we we're on the downhill side of this listen close brother Brown says now you see if you take away the word of God and the moving of the spirit as a means of worship then you will have to give the people another form of worship as substitute and substitution spells bmismart another form of worship as a substitute and substitution spells baalism right here brother brandham ties it together and right here is why we fight so hard against this I know over and over brother Tim brother Joe brother Timothy and myself we cry out against this spirit that would want to come in and clamp down on the moving of the spirit or what we might would call freedom of worship the ability to worship Him in spirit and Truth as the spirit moves upon your life because it's not we're not here for nickan ISM where I tell you how the spirit should move on each one of you it's not going to move the same on you as it does on me or shall I say it like this you're not going to respond exactly the way I do we're all nature different but there must be a response and we're not going to sit here and allow this thing to be clamped down upon us to where we accept bism as our form of worship now what's interesting is brother Bram now goes and makes it very clear what B ism is taking away the moving of the spirit and nickan ISM and all that's left is a substitute he ties this together and that substitute is the doctrine of balum we're going to get into it brother man says now we know that Israel was the chosen people of God they were the Pentecostals of their day they had taken Refuge under the blood and they had been baptized in the Red Sea and they came up out out of the waters singing in the spirit and dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost now this sounds like a good meeting to me now some people would have sat back and criticized and called it fanaticism and emotionalism to it sounds like a good meeting to me and they come out of that and they're journeying to the promised land and they come to a place called Moab and Moab had had was the son of lot by one of his own daughters and lot was Abra 's nephew so Israel and Moab are related they're related and Israel asked permission to pass through the land as they journeyed to their promised land and they say look we're family we mean you know harm we just want to pass through if we take anything if we eat anything if we drink anything we'll pay for it no problem just just let us pass through we're we're not here to hinder you we're not here to bother you we're just on the way to a promised land is that how you feel tonight look I'm not here to tell everybody else how to do what they need to do I'm just going to go to the promised land and I'm going to worship God in Freedom while I do it and they're just saying we're just going to the promised land we mean no harm but notice I want you to notice why baac was so against them and their March to the promised land listen what the prophet of God says but King baac got very excited that head of that nickan Bunch was not about to let the church come through with its signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the Holy Ghost with their faces shining with the glory of God it was too risky as he might lose some of his crowd my baac didn't want his people to see Victory baac didn't want his people to see what real Freedom looked like in the house of God baac didn't want it seeing what it looked like when people had been completely set free and and since they didn't have it there at their place in Moab he had to be against it and he had to teach against it and how it was all wrong and it was all emotion and it was all workup in case some of his people might join the march to the promised land well listen I say come join us on our March to the promised land don't be bound down in that balum religion be free you're supposed to be free today not bound up he was so afraid of it that he wanted to curse it so afraid of it that he hires a a hireling prophet named balum and we know the story how that God turned balum down but because of the rewards and the favors of man now notice take balum and place him over here in the age where people are becoming powerful as Bishops and Cardinals because of reward and power and what is it that sways balum more money more power well I know God said no but I'll give you I'll give you more position I'll give you more power ask God again and so because of this because of the rewards offer him balum kept right on asking listen young people once God has spoken that is his answer and if you continue begging you aren't looking for his will you're looking for his permission and that's totally different once he speaks take that answer don't keep begging because he may give in and that's a dangerous place to be so balum went back to God brother Brown says now one answer from God should have been enough but not for self-willed balum young people we can't be self-willed self-will gets you in trouble every time we got to look for God's will I don't want to be self-willed Lord take my will out of me not my will Lord but thy will be done brother Bram says self-willed balum he says he should have realized that this was simply God's permissive will and he wouldn't be able to curse them if he went 20 times and tried 20 times how like balam are people today they believe in three gods they get baptized in three titles instead of the name and yet God will send the spirit upon them as he did upon balum and they will go on believing that they are exactly right and here they are actually perfect bites well God blessed me so I must be doing right God God poured his Spirit out on me so I must be doing right no you're operating in his permission you're not operating in his will and that's the route that balum took and it's a false teaching I want to look at this close now listen in this time and this constantly comes up I understand that but if you read this portion of the church age book you came across it yourself in this time where people are constantly questioning emotion and questioning the Supernatural and questioning the Holy Ghost I want you to watch this next part real close he killed a ram signifying the coming of the Messiah and Bam knew what to do he knew what to do to approach unto God he had the mechanics just right let me break that down when we say that he understood the doctrines he understood the teachings he understood the godhead he had water baptism just right he went to church on Sunday and Wednesdays he knew everything by the letter just right I'm G say it again he had the mechanics just right but not the Dynamics same as now can't you see it Nick nans church that can't be no planer same as now can't you see it Nick itans and there was Israel down there in the valley offering the same sacrifice doing the same things now they're doing exactly what balam's doing but only one had signs following only one had God in their midst form won't get you anywhere it can't take the place of Spirit manifestation that is what happened at NAIA they put over balam's Doctrine not the doctrine of God and they stumbled y they fell and they became dead men even in like Tabernacle let us never become dead men where we get lifted up and prideful and what we know and the mysteries of this and we know this and we know that but let it be because we have God in our midst if you want to get anywhere it's because you got the spirit of God in your midst and God's moving and God's changing and God's healing and God's saving and it's God moving in this place and let's not get to a place of form and tradition and lifted up in the mechanics of it all he knew the mechanics he knew the rules he knew the letter of the law he knew the quotes but he was lacking the Dynamics and brother Bram says nicians he says only one had God and it was the one with signs following not the one with perfect form not the one with perfect Church order the one with signs following and so he can't curse them and baac wants to take balum down and show them their back Parts what's this mean it means he wants to show them their faults and their failures their issues and their struggles their carnal side hello we have a carnal side come on let's take our Halos off I didn't even have one but if you do we have a carnal side we all have faults and failures and if you study your brother and sister's faults and failures long enough that'll be all you see come on look I still need all the grace and I need to extend Grace but bayac says let's take them around and see their faults and failures and their carnal side surely there's enough faults that we can curse them now notice the attitude look don't dechristianize people when you see their faults and failures you see where that Spirit comes from now I'm not talking about somebody living in sin you know what I'm talking about here a struggle or a fault or a St let's quit de christianizing people surely these aren't God's people surely that ain't the spirit of God moving down at evening light Tabernacle look at all the flaws in that church I love this he says yes Israel had her back Parts carnal Parts they had their side that wasn't praiseworthy but in spite of their imperfections by the purpose of God that works through election Hallelujah he says by grace and not by works they had the cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night they had the smitten Rock the Brazen Serpent and the signs and wonders they were Vindicated not in themselves but in God May our Vindication not be in ourselves tonight but may it be in God and His presence amongst us are there faults and failures absolutely but God's with us have you stumbled and messed up absolutely but God is amongst us God is working in our midst what Vindication do you have God is moving in our midst that's the Vindication they have and so balum formulates a plan to cause Israel to fall like Eve in the garden by flesh desire balam knew that if Israel fell in sin that God would have to deal with them in death like he had in the garden so he sends out an invitation now remember we're studying an age we're going to just bring this right back to our third age but balam sends them an invitation to a great feast a fellowship as it were and they accept and and during this Feast there's dancing and music and carousing and things of that nature and the men of Israel fall into lust and fall into adultery which was balam's plan all along falls into this with the women of Moab and God slow slew 42,000 of them and this is exactly what happened at Nia because the true church had Vindication the true church had God working in their midst the true church had signs and wonders even though there were few and the false Vine invited them to a fellowship at the Nan Council where they fell into reasoning and they fell into balam's Doctrine and he says and that is what Constantine and the successors did at nah and after nah they invited the people of God to the convention and when the church sat down to eat and Rose up to play partaking of church forms ceremonies Pagan feasts named after Christian rights she was trapped she had committed fornication and God walked out May we never get to a place where God gets up and walks out let's not settle for form and tradition let's not settle for something that's a little more sensible a little more tame let's not settle for cold and formal but let's be identified by the moving of the spirit identified by God in our midst identified by him working by signs and wonders and worship and spirit and in truth at the naasan council Council Pagan Feast with new Christian names were added Apostles Creed was given to the people ancestor worship was taught to the people confessing their sins to men was taught to the people they were partakers with the devil and not of the Lord they were in idolatry whether they admitted it or not brother brand says they can say what they want now he's talking about today's churches but they are partaking in the well-known Babylonian satanic religion and have joined themselves to idols and committed spiritual fornication which means death they are dead so the church and state were married the church joined up with Idols with the power of the state behind them they felt that now the kingdom had come and God's will had been enforced upon the Earth so this is where it begins to go down that path of complete idolatry and complete fornication we just have a little a little couple of slides here left as we wrap this up the warning Revelation 2:16 repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth brother says what else can he say can God overlook the sin of those who have borne his name in vain there is only one way to receive Grace in The Hour of sin repent confess you were wrong come to God for forgiveness and for the spirit of God but still the grace of God Cries Out repent oh how sweet are the thoughts of repentance nothing in my hands I bring simply to thy cross I cling I bring my sorrow I Repent that I am what I am and what I have done now it is the blood nothing but the blood of Jesus what will it be repentance or the sword of death it's up to you what Grace think about this for a minute all that's going on in this age all the falling away all the falsehoods all the killing all the turning and adding and and and the blasphemy that's going on and yet God is crying out repent he's still pleading he's still calling he's still given an opportunity of Grace repent or else he's given opportunity and listen I'll tell you right now young person even tonight he's still calling and giv opportunity he's still pleading with those that are struggling he's still offering you Grace tonight I love how brother Bram says right here the last four words it's up to you you've been failing you've been falling you've been mixed up in the and the idols of the world you've been getting lukewarm relying on being a church member you've been growing cold it's up to you you have an opportunity even through the scripture tonight repent you still have opportunity oh brother Aaron this is a church a study that ain't even how this service is going what I'm telling you is is it's not too late wherever you're at it's repent or yeah else you haven't crossed the line I don't care what the devil's telling you I don't care what situation you find yourself in what sins how many times you've fallen down he's calling out for you tonight repent There's an opportunity for you to repent to light that fire once again and and and and and grow strong again because there will be not just a warning but there is a reward he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saveth he that receiveth it brother brandom goes into this just a little bit he talks about that hidden mana and he talks about the Mana that had been put inside the ark and how it would never spoil and how down Through the Ages they could come get a taste of it and then he kind of starts talking about how in each age by revelation God gave back a little bit more of the original mana and he and he would break it off and give it to the messenger but it wasn't just for themselves but to the Overcomers they got to eat of that Mana as the messenger would pass it out to the people of that age he he gave back things that had been hidden and he allowed the Saints to taste of the pure unadulterated word and then in our day it was all opened up all the Mysteries were revealed and you have the opportunity now as an overcomer to partake of all the hidden Mana you can eat from that that which has been hidden down Through the Ages like like I said Jesus would give it to the messengers of the age and they in turn would give it to the people and then he says and we'll give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth and the way brother Bron broke this down just it excited my heart as I read it and he talked about how Rome when they got the power of the treasury they had tapped into all the resources and all the money and they built these giant uh Cathedrals and these giant temples and they would all be made out out of white stone all out of marble they took all the money from the from the poor and he said the the true seed maybe they didn't have that marble maybe they didn't have statues built out after them he said God wasn't in the marble and God wasn't in the temples God was with his true seed maybe hiding in a cave he was with that true seed maybe in a little home meeting he was with that true seed maybe in the Coliseum facing death that's where God was but he says those that have laid their Treasures up in heaven you may not get a statue of white stone here he said but don't worry you'll have something like that there your Treasures will be there he said it'll be white stone you'll have Treasures in Heaven and you will have a new name written in a white stone he says new names he says it could well be that name was our true and original name written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world he knows that name but we do not think of about it you may not ever get nothing here as far as money and big white marble he says but there you'll be memorialized eternally and you'll be given a new name listen we know all about new names we know how Abraham and Sarah had to have a name change we know all all about those things how how Jacob had to have a name change he says you're going to get a name change and he says it just might be that original name that was written on the Lamb's Book of Life that he knows you by but no man knoweth because we don't know that name yet said but he knows it so what am I telling you lay your Treasures up in heaven you're going to get rewarded if you've been struggling listen to the warning and repent tonight quit chasing after Earthly things Earthly Idols don't get caught up in the ba things of Babylon don't get comfortable here in Babylon there's a reward waiting for you may we lay up our Treasures there may we press the battle stay true to the original gospel to the original truth that there is but one God there is but one Faith there is but one baptism there is one Lord and father of us all stay true to that and may we seek his will in our lives young people and not just his permission let's not be like balam seek his will for your life tonight with all your heart will you pray together with me heavenly father Lord we come before you tonight I know we've been lengthy Lord I understand Lord a lot of this I spoke a lot of words but Lord I pray that we can just see that there is a truth in it all there is a true God there is a true way to worship there is a way that you want it done and Lord may we stay true may we be true Lord Jesus Keep Us true Lord not let us to divulge Lord off the path this way or that way but we keep our eyes focused on the prize knowing that we'll receive a new name L written in the white stone father that there's a reward Lord I pray that if there be one here tonight that's struggling Lord that's backsliding Lord right now may you deal with that Heart Lord may you call out to them and let them know that there's Grace and there's Mercy they don't have to leave this building the same but even tonight Lord Lord there's a fountain open there's mercy and there's Grace Lord that's extended to each heart Lord as we look at the the the Saints down Through the Ages that gave so much and sacrificed so much Lord it charges us maybe we be willing to stand and finish this race Lord may we not lay down the Baton so close to the finish line but may we press the battle harder than ever with all that we have Lord until we cross Lord into that great glorious Rapture
