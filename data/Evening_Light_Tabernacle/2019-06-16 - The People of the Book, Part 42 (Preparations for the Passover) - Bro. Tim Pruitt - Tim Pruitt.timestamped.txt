[45:09] trusting that God will just speak to us
[45:12] today I just came back of course last
[45:15] Sunday was the or Saturday was the
[45:18] wedding that we had here and we had
[45:20] where the window Martin was a guest
[45:22] Minister Forrest so we certainly enjoyed
[45:26] that I knew you would enjoy him and then
[45:30] saw I didn't want you to miss that treat
[45:33] so we had him to minister while he was
[45:36] here and so but I just come back from
[45:40] brother Jason
[45:41] Jackson's there and we just had some
[45:44] tremendous meetings as the Lord blessed
[45:46] us I think there were about 10 very
[45:49] major miracles that happened in that
[45:52] meeting and God bringing some real
[45:54] deliverance and brought a real healing
[45:56] to some situations there that man
[45:59] couldn't handle man couldn't touched and
[46:02] but God knew how to do it he come right
[46:05] down and brought a deliverance that was
[46:08] just just phenomenal this supernatural
[46:12] because only God could do it brought a
[46:14] healing to his brother Jason's family
[46:18] and to his church and I believe it will
[46:23] have a lasting effect amen so then we
[46:28] then we also was with spoke with brother
[46:31] Mike price while we was up in that area
[46:33] at his church and he just told us the
[46:36] Wednesday night before they had they had
[46:38] six very major healings that had taken
[46:41] place and that service and so we just
[46:44] hear the the Lord moving all over the
[46:46] place Amen I'm glad to know that it's
[46:49] not just in one little place but God's
[46:52] moving by his spirit and you can expect
[46:55] God to move when you start believing we
[46:58] start testifying on his his
[47:01] wonder-working power we're gonna look at
[47:04] Exodus chapter 12 today
[47:07] and we're going to be reading from the
[47:10] first verse and I want to read about the
[47:14] Passover that the first Passover were
[47:18] there was actually the death angel
[47:21] passing over this is not the
[47:22] commemoration that would be done by
[47:25] Israel for thousands of years but this
[47:27] was the actual Passover so we're going
[47:31] to be speaking today on preparations for
[47:34] the Passover because we are also living
[47:37] in another time and this is not another
[47:40] commemoration of a feast where it's just
[47:44] a tradition but this is actually where
[47:46] there's a death angel in the land and
[47:49] there must be an exodus from here amen
[47:53] and we we must make preparations for
[47:56] that Exodus chapter 12 verse 1 and the
[47:59] Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron in the
[48:02] land of Egypt saying this month shall be
[48:05] unto you the beginning of months it
[48:08] shall be the first month of the year to
[48:10] you speaking to all the Israel a
[48:14] congregation of Israel sayin in the
[48:17] tenth day of this month they shall take
[48:19] to them every man a lamb according to
[48:23] the house of their fathers a lamb for an
[48:25] house and if the household be too little
[48:28] for the lamb let him and his neighbor
[48:31] next unto his house take it according to
[48:34] the number of the souls and every man
[48:37] according to his eating shall make your
[48:40] count for the lamb and your lamb shall
[48:43] be without blemish a male of the first
[48:46] year you shall take it out from the
[48:49] sheep or from the goats and ye shall
[48:53] keep it up until the fourteenth day of
[48:56] the same month and the whole Assembly of
[49:01] the congregation of Israel shall kill it
[49:04] in the evening and they shall take of
[49:07] the blood and strike it on the two side
[49:10] posts and on the upper post doorpost of
[49:14] the houses William they shall eat it and
[49:16] they shall eat the flesh and that night
[49:20] with fire and unleavened bread with
[49:23] bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not a
[49:26] bit wrong or sudden at all with water
[49:29] but roast with fire his head with his
[49:33] legs and with the pertinence dare of and
[49:37] ye shall let nothing of it remain until
[49:41] the morning and that which remaineth of
[49:44] it until the morning you shall burn with
[49:46] fire and thus shall you eat it with your
[49:49] loins girded your shoes on your feet
[49:53] your stop in your hand you shall eat it
[49:56] in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I
[50:00] was passed through the land of Egypt
[50:01] this night and will smite all the
[50:04] firstborn in the land of Egypt both man
[50:07] and beast and against all the gods of
[50:10] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[50:13] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a
[50:18] token upon the houses where you are and
[50:22] when I see the Blood I will pass over
[50:25] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[50:28] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[50:32] Egypt may God bless you can be seated
[50:41] right now we are in another great time
[50:45] of an exodus this is a rapture our I
[50:48] believe we are in an end time and as it
[50:53] is in a rapture our I think is the the
[50:58] prophet of God said in in this about the
[51:01] seventh age this last age that we're
[51:04] living in is the age that takes the
[51:06] rapture and he is clear that even as
[51:10] there are night watches even so God you
[51:15] know through the church ages he also had
[51:18] watches and so Jesus is to come for his
[51:23] bride in the seventh watch which is the
[51:25] seventh church age that we're living in
[51:28] so we're right here in the very time of
[51:30] the coming of the Lord
[51:32] we know this is also shown by examples
[51:37] in the scriptures as is typed out for
[51:40] example Enoch was raptured the seventh
[51:43] from Adam it's showing that it's the
[51:46] seventh church age that takes the
[51:48] rapture and so there's no doubt that we
[51:50] are here in the seventh chapter our
[51:52] seventh church age nor the last last age
[51:55] where there is to be a rapture for the
[51:58] raptured without death will be called
[52:00] out of the seventh church age and we are
[52:02] now bearing record of that church age so
[52:06] we're living in a very awesome wonderful
[52:08] hour today and the rapture hour in this
[52:12] Exodus is a time of the Passover as the
[52:17] death angel is definitely going through
[52:19] the land you can see it death is upon
[52:23] upon the world that we're living upon in
[52:26] its upon Society it's a it's here in
[52:30] America it's shown in our marriages is
[52:34] shown in family units is found in you
[52:38] know among our youth is found everywhere
[52:40] the death angel is definitely going
[52:42] through the line and as the death angel
[52:45] goes through it will plunge this whole
[52:48] world into great tribulation where there
[52:51] will be weeping and wailing and gnashing
[52:54] of teeth even as in that first Exodus
[52:57] that there was weeping and wailing and
[53:01] gnashing of teeth as a mourn because of
[53:04] the results of what the death angel had
[53:06] done and the night of the Passover they
[53:09] were on they were also on the eve of
[53:12] great joy you know he was it was not
[53:15] just a time of of great trepidations in
[53:20] trouble but it was also a time where
[53:22] they were at an anticipation and it was
[53:26] a with great joy that they were they
[53:30] were looking to in Israel was going home
[53:33] at last I wonder where it will be I mean
[53:38] the realization
[53:40] as a people that we're going home at
[53:43] last that the trouble the sorrow the
[53:47] problems of the AIDS of problems of this
[53:49] life the sicknesses that are in the body
[53:53] will be free from it we're going home at
[53:56] last
[53:57] 101 up expectation to look to and and
[54:01] even though we know that death is coming
[54:03] on the world and we know that death is
[54:06] coming into our society and death is in
[54:09] our schools and deaths is in our nation
[54:11] yet at the same time we can have a great
[54:14] joy because we have an expectation we're
[54:19] under an anticipation that we're leaving
[54:21] here and we're going to escape the
[54:24] things that are coming on the earth but
[54:26] not only and leaving here we're going to
[54:28] be free from slavery amen free at last
[54:33] rapture bound I believe that's who I'm
[54:36] talking to this morning a people that
[54:38] are rapture bound that are saying I am a
[54:41] part of this Exodus I am getting ready
[54:44] to leave now for the world around them
[54:49] to own it was a lot of time of joy but
[54:52] it was a time of sorrow and trouble in
[54:55] wool and the Bible describes us in
[54:58] Revelation 12 where he says woe to the
[55:01] earth for the come down to you
[55:03] with great wrath so it tells us about
[55:06] the approaching death angel and Satan
[55:10] coming himself to become king of the
[55:13] earth for just a short time while the
[55:15] bride is in glory with with Christ and
[55:18] but yet upon the world will come a great
[55:21] time of trouble and so Cyril and will
[55:24] like neighbors been upon the earth and
[55:27] for Israel dis was it was a this night
[55:31] was the birth of a nation it was our
[55:34] birth into a new land and they were
[55:39] going by an accident sand and irises
[55:42] quite different ours is not a birth into
[55:45] a physical land like that but this date
[55:49] is a
[55:49] earth into a rapture it's a birth into a
[55:53] heavenly round that all believers have
[55:56] longed for down through the years and
[55:59] for ages and ages and what I'm preaching
[56:02] about is something that is very real
[56:04] it's not an imagination it's real the
[56:08] Passover was not just so saving from
[56:11] death but it was the birth into new life
[56:14] and so we want to think about it even
[56:18] every time that a person comes under the
[56:21] token comes under the blood it's filled
[56:24] with the Holy Ghost you see it's the
[56:27] idioms a birth into a new life it is not
[56:31] just to saving from death but it's the
[56:33] burden to a life and so this this birds
[56:37] would begin as a new life of grace and
[56:40] fellowship with God and it was this
[56:43] fellowship God wanted it renewed
[56:46] perpetually a man that every generation
[56:49] would also have this fellowship and
[56:53] would enter into this Passover Feast and
[56:56] have this time of remembers when the
[56:59] Death Angel passed now so we want to
[57:03] think though about this Passover this
[57:05] morning when we use this phrase I don't
[57:07] want you to think about a feast a
[57:09] physical feast like this word that it
[57:12] would be commemorated year after year
[57:15] but I want you to think of the first
[57:17] time the very first time when the death
[57:22] angel was coming right down to every
[57:26] dollar the very first time when Passover
[57:32] didn't mean a feast it meant there was
[57:36] death passing over that those that were
[57:42] under the sentence of death and I'll
[57:44] just tell you we're all under the
[57:46] sentence of death remember there's a
[57:49] lamb that died in our place
[57:51] and because of that lamb he took our
[57:54] sentence of death and won the rap that
[57:58] we should have God was poured out upon
[57:59] him are you with me now and so I don't
[58:03] you to think of this is just a Passover
[58:06] of a celebration and a meal and a remote
[58:09] memorial I want you to realize we are in
[58:11] another Passover where the death angel
[58:15] is again in the land now it's a time of
[58:20] desperation the reason for the command
[58:26] was not to go to not go out of the door
[58:29] or the house was in this night of
[58:31] judgment there would be no safety
[58:34] anywhere except behind those
[58:37] blood-stained doors everything else that
[58:44] was not behind that blade blood-stained
[58:47] door I want to get it to you even this
[58:51] celebrates perhaps in Egypt many other
[58:54] people were doing you know having meals
[58:57] and banquets and and other things but if
[58:59] there's not a blood stained or that that
[59:02] the angel still comes in I want you to
[59:06] understand it's not about just having
[59:07] church and coming together for spiritual
[59:11] feast but if we must be under the blood
[59:15] the blood life of Christ must have been
[59:18] set for us and accepted and applied and
[59:22] as we dealt with it it's applied on both
[59:25] side for both side posts and then over
[59:28] the lentil which which means were for us
[59:30] it would be the body here's the entrance
[59:33] into us the body the spirit realm and
[59:36] the soul and it must be applied in all
[59:39] three places remember not one place not
[59:44] two places not just on the body not just
[59:47] on the spirit but it must be in all
[59:49] three places it must be in that soul now
[59:54] death was approaching and I did want to
[59:57] share with you some scripture that shows
[1:00:00] you in the fourth seal that of how that
[1:00:05] as if actually you see things are
[1:00:08] changing we're in a very time of change
[1:00:10] where the horse riders of revelations
[1:00:13] has started out you know with just a
[1:00:15] white horse a very insidious spirit but
[1:00:20] maybe looked quite harmless
[1:00:21] you know rider one white horse with the
[1:00:24] bow and no arrows and even many in many
[1:00:28] of the theologians would think it was
[1:00:29] Christ but it wasn't it was the
[1:00:31] Antichrist and he starts rising and he's
[1:00:34] a spirit and then he becomes crowned and
[1:00:37] the next time and changes to red and he
[1:00:40] slaughters there's 68 million down to
[1:00:43] the ages where that just on their record
[1:00:46] of a word he got it sort bloody chilling
[1:00:50] the chilling the elect of God are you
[1:00:53] with me and it all happened within a
[1:00:55] religious system then it changes from
[1:00:59] that to a black horse rider and there
[1:01:02] again with the black horse of the rider
[1:01:05] on the black horse he's he's selling the
[1:01:07] staples of life which would happen were
[1:01:10] that you know the church would begin to
[1:01:12] charge so much for repentance and so
[1:01:15] much for novenas permission to sin and
[1:01:17] and covers for sin when the blood of
[1:01:19] jesus paid it all but now finally it
[1:01:24] changes from that to the last horse to
[1:01:28] ride now remember it's the same horse it
[1:01:34] just Saints his colors it's the same
[1:01:37] rider he just morphs into a different
[1:01:39] one he just changes their accordingly as
[1:01:44] he starts out an insidious spirit then
[1:01:46] he gets crowned then he goes forth but
[1:01:48] with the with the power state behind him
[1:01:50] then he begins to slaughter with it with
[1:01:53] the sword and then then he begins to to
[1:01:55] distort knowledge and begins to bring
[1:01:59] about a dark ages and finally here's his
[1:02:04] last ride and we're approaching it
[1:02:08] what I'm talking about death this is
[1:02:11] what's coming
[1:02:13] revelations six and eight and I looked
[1:02:15] and behold a pale horse
[1:02:18] now this pale horse is no certain color
[1:02:22] he's a mixture of white red and black so
[1:02:26] he's called pale he's a he's a
[1:02:29] combination of all three his name that
[1:02:34] saddled him was death now we find out
[1:02:38] who it was all the time it was death
[1:02:41] starting out in the first church with
[1:02:43] the Volt's doctors come on then it was
[1:02:47] it was death riding there with the sword
[1:02:50] there conquering through political
[1:02:52] systems Rome would do this Rome would
[1:02:57] take and use her political power there
[1:02:59] to to slaughter sixty-eight million
[1:03:02] Christians that it wouldn't bow down to
[1:03:05] the Pope then you come into the next one
[1:03:09] then it brings his Dark Age know what
[1:03:12] and it sells have any staff of life a
[1:03:15] major wheat for a penny a measure of
[1:03:17] barley for a penny it sells a very stop
[1:03:21] of life but now he changes and we're
[1:03:25] right here in the middle of the change
[1:03:27] he can't come into full power until
[1:03:31] there's an exodus he can't come and do
[1:03:36] his full work until a people leave here
[1:03:39] the death angel can't do its damage and
[1:03:43] Childers of people under the blood and
[1:03:45] prepared for an exodus are you with me
[1:03:48] and I looked and behold a pale horse and
[1:03:51] his name that sat on him was death now
[1:03:54] we know who he was all the time and hell
[1:03:57] followed him amen
[1:04:01] now you all you have to do is read the
[1:04:03] book of Revelation and you see that I
[1:04:05] was a bottomless pit comes every kind of
[1:04:08] evil spirit because he'll follows this
[1:04:12] and he says
[1:04:15] power was given unto them over the
[1:04:19] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[1:04:20] sword and with hunger and with death and
[1:04:22] with the beasts of the earth so now
[1:04:24] power is given to him to kill so here we
[1:04:27] come right back down to where we are
[1:04:29] here in this end time and death is about
[1:04:33] to ride through the land I wanna I want
[1:04:37] you to I want to impress upon your this
[1:04:40] congregation I want to impress upon you
[1:04:41] young people death is coming in it's
[1:04:46] coming in and every kind of way that man
[1:04:49] is coming in through media is coming in
[1:04:51] through pornography it's coming into
[1:04:53] every kind of sin that you can imagine
[1:04:55] it sin has now become and become greater
[1:04:58] than ever and all of the powers of hell
[1:05:02] is heaping up against this generation
[1:05:04] and pressing in on you and without the
[1:05:08] blood you'll never keep him out of your
[1:05:10] door and the blood is the Holy Ghost
[1:05:14] it's not just a magic word it's the
[1:05:16] spirit or the life of the blood which is
[1:05:19] the life of Christ the Holy Spirit you
[1:05:22] must have the Holy Ghost this is very
[1:05:25] important now I would like to to just
[1:05:30] show you this in the scripture because
[1:05:33] spirits can take on different forms now
[1:05:36] this is shown in in 2nd Corinthians
[1:05:38] 11:13 for such a false apostles
[1:05:42] deceitful workers transforming
[1:05:44] themselves into apostles of Christ and
[1:05:48] no Marvel for Satan himself is
[1:05:52] transformed into an angel of light
[1:05:55] therefore there's no great thing if his
[1:05:58] ministers be also be transformed as men
[1:06:01] the ministers of righteousness whose end
[1:06:04] shall be according to their works
[1:06:06] so now Paul is very clear he said that
[1:06:09] the Satan is a transformer he will
[1:06:13] transform himself from one thing to
[1:06:16] another we've seen it just with the
[1:06:17] horse riders when we talk about that the
[1:06:20] first four seals and we see it there
[1:06:23] transform him from white to red to black
[1:06:28] the pale and it's the same spirit all
[1:06:31] the time just changing now you know
[1:06:35] brother Branham would solve many many
[1:06:38] visions and I want to just speak about
[1:06:41] one this morning I'm not going to read
[1:06:44] to you all the account I just want to
[1:06:46] just share with you but he he saw
[1:06:49] himself in a vision coming down to
[1:06:52] Jordan you can find this in the message
[1:06:53] paradox
[1:06:54] so that was coming down to Jordan and
[1:06:57] look like I was standing on the map of
[1:07:00] Palestine and I could hear this song say
[1:07:03] him I'm going down to the Jordan and he
[1:07:06] said because I drew near the river I
[1:07:08] look back I look back the way that I'd
[1:07:12] come and I was now two-thirds of the way
[1:07:15] of the journey he had come through two
[1:07:18] phases of his ministry and he said - oh
[1:07:22] praise the Lord on the other side is
[1:07:24] where all the promises like every
[1:07:28] promise lays in the promised land now
[1:07:32] this is true for you as an individual
[1:07:34] your Jordan is death to self and man and
[1:07:38] entered into the Holy Ghost and then the
[1:07:41] Holy Ghost is wherever promised lays
[1:07:44] this is true of the church our promised
[1:07:47] land he is the Holy Ghost man and we
[1:07:51] must cross we must cross Jordan of death
[1:07:54] to ever idea map and enter into the full
[1:07:58] promises of God because where would
[1:08:01] there in the Holy Ghost is wherever
[1:08:03] promised lays a map the promise does not
[1:08:08] lay in theology
[1:08:10] it is not lay in man's ideas or our
[1:08:14] great knowledge and wisdom of man it
[1:08:16] lays in the Holy Ghost amen
[1:08:20] now and of course as we as he said I was
[1:08:26] looking here and we were approaching the
[1:08:28] crossing over into the fullness of the
[1:08:31] promise and he said again he said I I
[1:08:37] then saw
[1:08:39] a highway a highway and it was an hour
[1:08:43] highway and I had been lifted up on it
[1:08:46] and and he said I know this is a vision
[1:08:49] I I know God is here said but seem like
[1:08:52] everybody's afraid because you know here
[1:08:56] again they're trying to get into this
[1:08:59] promised land and I'd hear there's
[1:09:02] there's all kinds of reason to be afraid
[1:09:04] and he said this voice came and said
[1:09:08] there's such danger in this day that
[1:09:10] there's a great hideous thing that his
[1:09:13] death when it strikes you and then he
[1:09:15] said I saw here come a monstrous snake
[1:09:17] he said I knew it was a Mamba it was the
[1:09:20] most poisonous one it could be and he
[1:09:22] said yeah you know I saw it there and he
[1:09:27] was on the highway and he said you know
[1:09:30] he would run up fast to me and he's sick
[1:09:33] but something would hold him back
[1:09:37] now that's where you want to be in this
[1:09:40] hour that you're living in when death is
[1:09:43] all around are you on me are you with me
[1:09:45] these people here Ivania
[1:09:48] if this was the original Passover that
[1:09:50] had something to hold death back it was
[1:09:53] random to know and every individual
[1:09:57] every one of us every Church was
[1:09:59] something that I hold back that that
[1:10:02] vigil because he's gonna approach every
[1:10:05] one of us a man sent over take you the
[1:10:09] wickedness of this world you're not
[1:10:11] strong enough you're not able to keep it
[1:10:14] back you must have the Holy Spirit you
[1:10:18] must have the Tok so he said I looked
[1:10:21] over and he said I saw him after what a
[1:10:24] friend of mine and said he was jumping
[1:10:27] in and dodging it and and he was chasing
[1:10:30] him and he was running from him with
[1:10:32] everything and he was about to get him
[1:10:34] and he says Oh God Oh God you know what
[1:10:37] can I do he's gonna he's gonna get my
[1:10:39] brother and then the voice of God said
[1:10:42] but you have the power to bind him now I
[1:10:45] want you to understand something we've
[1:10:48] got to have that power
[1:10:49] and I believe the binding power to bind
[1:10:53] the serpent it's right here in this
[1:10:57] build in this moment I believe it's
[1:11:00] right in God's church I believe it's
[1:11:03] right in God's people the power to bind
[1:11:06] the serpent I'm at the power to bind sin
[1:11:10] and to bring an individual under place
[1:11:14] where they too can be it'll situation
[1:11:17] where it holds the death angel back
[1:11:19] a mouth so as as he was speaking of it
[1:11:26] and he came out of that vision and this
[1:11:28] is where I want to get to brother
[1:11:31] Branham was told he said now to bind a
[1:11:33] serpent you're gonna have to be more
[1:11:36] sincere hey man you're gonna have to be
[1:11:41] more sincere see this is the reason to
[1:11:47] be able to bind the serpent you're gonna
[1:11:49] have to be more sincere there's got to
[1:11:53] come of sincerity along with the message
[1:11:58] of the hour with that sincerity comes a
[1:12:02] desperation comes an honest word that we
[1:12:08] we get serious with God and brother
[1:12:10] Branham was asking then well then what
[1:12:12] must I do and he said surely Lord
[1:12:15] there's something here in the Bible that
[1:12:17] would show me what I am to do and and he
[1:12:21] he said I you know you know the kids are
[1:12:24] leaving for school and and I've got to
[1:12:27] drive them to school midnight this
[1:12:28] emergency Lord we just show me as I open
[1:12:32] the Bible is there a scripture is there
[1:12:34] scripture you can just you could just
[1:12:36] show me and he said it opened up right
[1:12:40] here to this scripture and this is where
[1:12:44] we want to read from first Corinthians 5
[1:12:48] and verse 7 and by the way I didn't plan
[1:12:55] this but when my Bible opened it opened
[1:13:00] right there
[1:13:01] I didn't have a marker they just fell
[1:13:11] open there we're here right at that
[1:13:14] place we're gonna have to be more
[1:13:16] sincere first Corinthians 5:7 purge out
[1:13:23] therefore the old leaven that you may be
[1:13:26] a new lump as ye are unleavened for even
[1:13:32] Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us
[1:13:35] therefore let us keep the feasts not
[1:13:39] with the old leaven neither with the
[1:13:41] leaven of malice and wickedness but with
[1:13:43] the unleavened bread of sincerity and
[1:13:47] truth
[1:13:49] amen I just need a confirmation is it
[1:13:56] there is it there is it there so he's a
[1:14:04] witness
[1:14:12] we're not playing Church anymore we're
[1:14:16] in a very serious hour now as I go
[1:14:26] forward here maybe some things might
[1:14:28] just kind of go over your head but hold
[1:14:31] on there Bible truths because we happen
[1:14:34] to be living in a day an hour where that
[1:14:36] the book of Revelation is very pertinent
[1:14:39] to us very important because it talks
[1:14:43] about the end time plan God reserved
[1:14:46] things for the end time and and so in
[1:14:52] the Bible it speaks about the seven
[1:14:54] seals which I just shared with you for
[1:14:56] them and speaking about the horse riders
[1:14:59] these were symbols symbolic rode as in
[1:15:05] symbolic form in the Bible because God
[1:15:08] reserved them to the end time in there
[1:15:12] in Revelation chapter
[1:15:13] one through three it would tell about
[1:15:15] seven churches and these are Gentile
[1:15:19] churches and these would be symbolic of
[1:15:22] seven ages and we're now at the last one
[1:15:25] Laodicea
[1:15:27] and as I told you we're gonna be
[1:15:30] raptured from the Laodicean age not
[1:15:32] another not beyond it but in this age
[1:15:35] now so the revelation of the seven seals
[1:15:39] it opens back to us our homeland it
[1:15:43] brings us back to where we were before
[1:15:47] that now this is something I'm going to
[1:15:50] emphasize on this morning it brings us
[1:15:52] back to where we were before in other
[1:15:56] words Israel had been in the land will
[1:16:00] call it Palestine for lack of a better
[1:16:02] word but they had been in the land of
[1:16:04] Palestine and they had sojourned now for
[1:16:07] four hundred years down in Egypt and
[1:16:09] this was a time to go back to their home
[1:16:13] life are you with me now this is it
[1:16:17] we're that we are out we are
[1:16:19] the revelation of the seven seals it
[1:16:21] opens to us the homeland it brings us
[1:16:25] back to where we were at the beginning
[1:16:28] to the original Pentecost amen where the
[1:16:35] power was given first to bind the
[1:16:38] serpent to bang sin to give a power to
[1:16:43] the church that sin would no longer
[1:16:45] reign in your mortal body we're quoting
[1:16:49] Romans chapter six now now brother
[1:16:53] Branham would speak of the token message
[1:16:55] and and it was a message on the Holy
[1:16:58] Ghost you must have the life of the
[1:17:00] blood the Holy Ghost
[1:17:01] so the token message he called it the
[1:17:04] highlight message of his entire ministry
[1:17:08] can you imagine summon all his entire
[1:17:11] ministry these are his words my entire
[1:17:13] ministry he says is the highlight
[1:17:18] message now why because weird another
[1:17:23] Exodus and like in Moses did
[1:17:27] he where he gave a message for the
[1:17:29] exodus so did he and you know so does so
[1:17:33] did he did the same he brought us a
[1:17:35] message on how to get ready to leave
[1:17:38] here and that ought to be the the joy of
[1:17:41] the church right now is that we're
[1:17:44] leaving we're not staying
[1:17:47] it'll get darker it'll get more even
[1:17:50] there will be weeping and wailing and
[1:17:52] gnashing of teeth
[1:17:53] there will be a Great Tribulation to
[1:17:56] follow
[1:17:56] I'll even but we're not going to be here
[1:17:58] for it we're going to escape and this
[1:18:04] Exodus was an escape from the death
[1:18:06] things and man it was escape from
[1:18:09] Egypt's bondage and this is an escape
[1:18:13] we're escaping the things that are
[1:18:15] coming on the earth what Jesus told us
[1:18:17] always pray always pray always that you
[1:18:21] escape the things that are coming on the
[1:18:24] earth so after his sermon on the on the
[1:18:27] message of token he preaches a sermon
[1:18:30] desperations now this is to follow this
[1:18:34] highlight sermon it's it's it's actually
[1:18:37] a really a part of it because he carries
[1:18:39] his whole thought right on over into the
[1:18:41] evening desperations
[1:18:43] and he reads from Jeremiah 29 in verse
[1:18:48] 10 and I want to I want to get this to
[1:18:51] you
[1:18:52] jeremiah 29:10 from dust saith the lord
[1:18:55] that after seventy years we accomplished
[1:18:58] that Babylon I will visit you and
[1:19:01] perform my good word towards you and
[1:19:03] causing you to return to this place now
[1:19:07] here was Israel in another exile and now
[1:19:11] they were going to return back to this
[1:19:13] place the place of their beginning they
[1:19:15] had been down in Babylon come on but now
[1:19:18] they're coming back to their homeland
[1:19:20] Exodus was a back to the homeland now
[1:19:24] they're in a another time of coming back
[1:19:26] to their homeland now understand that's
[1:19:29] what we're at as a people we are
[1:19:32] returning back to the original coming
[1:19:36] right back to Pentecost again hey map
[1:19:41] now so he says again he says I I will
[1:19:48] perform I will visit you he saw these
[1:19:51] ought to be just magnificent words to us
[1:19:55] look at this scripture go back in that
[1:19:58] verse verse 10 please he says I will
[1:20:02] visit you we're in our visitation I'm a
[1:20:09] visit you after the time of exile is
[1:20:12] over and we're at the time where that's
[1:20:15] all is over can i bounce it to you amen
[1:20:19] the dispersal is over where we have
[1:20:22] wondered down through seven churches we
[1:20:25] are with now over is the time to return
[1:20:29] return with all your hearts and the
[1:20:32] reason that this return is happen is
[1:20:35] because people faster than you my good
[1:20:52] word not just preach my work but
[1:20:55] performant I'm vindicated again with
[1:20:59] signs and wonders and miracles and
[1:21:02] healings with delivers calls you to
[1:21:06] return to this place and I believe
[1:21:10] there's a V people that are being caused
[1:21:12] to return back to that original place
[1:21:16] where the church
[1:21:17] fell from a man now so as we look at it
[1:21:25] he says for I know the thoughts that I
[1:21:29] think toward you
[1:21:32] there are thoughts of peace and not of
[1:21:36] evil to give you an expected in these
[1:21:40] are my thoughts that I have for you my
[1:21:43] thoughts is not to leave you here
[1:21:45] vulnerable to the death angel my
[1:21:48] thoughts are not to send you through
[1:21:50] tribulation for more purging my thoughts
[1:21:53] that I have toward you are a piece of
[1:21:55] evil because I'm going to bring you an
[1:21:58] expected here back to that land then
[1:22:06] shall you call upon me and you should go
[1:22:09] and pray unto me and I will hearken to
[1:22:12] you somebody say yes Lord a madman you
[1:22:18] shall call upon me you separated me and
[1:22:21] I'll listen to ya I'll hear you do you
[1:22:25] know they've been prayers that have been
[1:22:27] prayed that God's that I can't answer
[1:22:28] that now one of the last prayers of the
[1:22:32] Bible was even so come Lord Jesus but
[1:22:35] we're an hour the time where he's
[1:22:37] listening to that prayer every time you
[1:22:40] say don't leave me here every time you
[1:22:49] do something God God's hearing he's
[1:22:54] making preparations rooms people he's
[1:22:57] getting you ready for Exodus and you
[1:23:03] shall seek me and find me
[1:23:06] Amen when now here it is here it is when
[1:23:11] ye shall search for me with all your
[1:23:15] heart you see when you quit being
[1:23:20] half-hearted and halfway about it but
[1:23:25] when you really get sincere when you
[1:23:30] really begin to say Lord I want you both
[1:23:33] the life itself
[1:23:35] I will not let apply more than life
[1:23:37] itself more than getting married more
[1:23:40] than happened uh you don't this spotter
[1:23:42] doing there sir all right this
[1:23:44] subtraction I love you both I want you
[1:23:48] you take the whole world just give me
[1:23:51] Jesus
[1:23:52] hey ma'am when you saw search for me
[1:23:55] with your whole heart and I will be
[1:23:59] found of you what words I will be found
[1:24:03] of you saith the Lord and I will turn
[1:24:05] away your captivity and I'll gather you
[1:24:09] from all nations and from all other
[1:24:12] places whether I have been driven you
[1:24:14] saith the Lord and I'll bring you back
[1:24:16] into the place whence I caused you to be
[1:24:19] carried away captain now
[1:24:22] brother madam reads a scripture in there
[1:24:24] and he's this is what he adds when he
[1:24:27] says this I'll bring you back to the
[1:24:29] place where I caused you to be carried
[1:24:32] away captive and he says back to
[1:24:35] Pentecost now I put that in myself it
[1:24:41] doesn't say that but that's what I was
[1:24:43] meaning to the church so where is he
[1:24:50] going to bring his back back to the
[1:24:52] place of our origin now soon so you see
[1:24:58] before the Passover there that must
[1:25:00] though be a cleansing of eleven and
[1:25:03] eleven is a type of sin and of course
[1:25:07] one source of leaven is doctrine is that
[1:25:11] right
[1:25:12] we'll deal with some other sources maybe
[1:25:14] another service but right now that one
[1:25:16] source of Lebanese is doctrine because
[1:25:19] Jesus told him said beware of the leaven
[1:25:21] of the Pharisees and he said that the
[1:25:24] disciples said you know what are you
[1:25:26] trying to tell us he said the Pharisees
[1:25:28] doctrine is 11 so doctrine is leaven
[1:25:33] some doctrine is lemon added to the word
[1:25:35] are you with me now
[1:25:37] so you see the seals the opening of the
[1:25:41] seals expose eleven and in his giving us
[1:25:44] bread
[1:25:45] without the addition of corruption you
[1:25:49] see the lemon is a yeast and it makes
[1:25:52] the bread more you know palatable it
[1:25:56] more pleasant more desirable
[1:25:58] you know sin is always desirable even
[1:26:02] these doctrines become appealing
[1:26:05] you know they excite the mind and people
[1:26:08] get excited over over this lever talk
[1:26:13] all them doctors and doctrines of devils
[1:26:16] from seducing spirits so seduction is
[1:26:19] always an excitement goes with it you
[1:26:22] take a man and a woman in there you know
[1:26:26] married to each other and dullness comes
[1:26:28] in their marriage and there there's what
[1:26:30] well this extramarital affair comes in
[1:26:33] there's a there's something you know
[1:26:37] goes on and it becomes a drive and a
[1:26:40] conquest and the Bible calls these
[1:26:43] things seducing spirits and doctrines of
[1:26:48] devils doctrines of devils that are
[1:26:50] seducing spirits spirits of seduction
[1:26:54] and they have the euphoria let's just go
[1:27:01] back to Genesis chapter 3 and verse 4
[1:27:05] where the first spirit of seduction was
[1:27:10] shown on earth and this serpent said
[1:27:14] unto the woman ye shall not surely die
[1:27:19] now listen they wouldn't have died if
[1:27:23] they would have stayed with the original
[1:27:25] unleavened bread of the word of God but
[1:27:28] here now comes in leather they have the
[1:27:32] pure word given from God but now here
[1:27:34] the serpent comes in with kids
[1:27:36] interpretation so now here he says here
[1:27:40] he says for God that know that the day
[1:27:43] you eat thereof that your eyes can be
[1:27:45] opened and you some years God's knowing
[1:27:47] good and evil and when the woman saw the
[1:27:49] tree was good for food and that it was
[1:27:52] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[1:27:54] desired to make one wise
[1:27:58] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[1:28:00] eat and gave also to her a husband with
[1:28:03] her and he did eat so he had a leaven he
[1:28:09] just twisted the doctrine of God just a
[1:28:14] little bit and just changed one word and
[1:28:19] brought death on the whole human race
[1:28:21] now if they did just realize the death
[1:28:25] angel was standing there in the front of
[1:28:27] the and in front of them called the
[1:28:29] serpent a man they have a word are you
[1:28:35] with me then a word that would keep him
[1:28:37] out but he just opened just a little of
[1:28:42] it and he steps ready so this is what
[1:28:48] has happened today because we're seeing
[1:28:50] the serpent read between the lines again
[1:28:55] read between the lines as to what God
[1:28:57] says and it brings death what was read
[1:29:01] between the lines wasn't matching what
[1:29:03] was on the line is that right the severn
[1:29:06] added his leaven to make it desirable it
[1:29:09] and it's so cheesy
[1:29:10] that they would could eat knowledge and
[1:29:13] knowledge puffs up the bread it makes it
[1:29:16] lighter and easier to eat and today men
[1:29:20] have added all kinds of Lebanon into the
[1:29:23] bread and to do so contaminates the
[1:29:26] message of the hour and what it does the
[1:29:29] message is no longer pure and it loses
[1:29:32] its power now as I was saying this first
[1:29:37] Passover was not a tradition it was not
[1:29:40] a reenactment it was not commemorating
[1:29:43] and remembering that that things it was
[1:29:45] real and there was more to it than just
[1:29:48] the blood striking on the door now we
[1:29:50] get that you know we got to get the Holy
[1:29:52] Ghost brother to him we gotta get the
[1:29:54] Holy Ghost got a had the Holy Ghost we
[1:29:56] gotta have the
[1:29:57] we've got to have that experience we got
[1:29:59] that but that's not all of it I want you
[1:30:05] to understand that's not all of it in
[1:30:09] behind the Holy Ghost there's a life
[1:30:11] that is going on that is a pure life
[1:30:15] with unleavened bread and the whole lamb
[1:30:22] there's a lot of things that goes with
[1:30:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and people
[1:30:29] are saying they're under the bud and
[1:30:31] this ain't happenin here is because
[1:30:33] there's no real lamb back there we're
[1:30:35] just imagining and we're pretending
[1:30:39] because behind the blood behind the Holy
[1:30:43] Ghost after you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:30:44] it's gonna bring you into a sincerity a
[1:30:48] preparation a man is going to bring you
[1:30:52] into feast with the Lord it's going to
[1:30:56] bring you to where you eat the whole
[1:30:57] lambeth and it's going to bring you to
[1:31:00] eating unleavened bread these are a lot
[1:31:05] of the signs that you really got the
[1:31:07] blood on the door it's not just oh I had
[1:31:11] experience down the altar and I prayed
[1:31:13] through brother Tim my brother Tim how I
[1:31:17] remember ho ho I remember that day
[1:31:21] lay in my hands on the lamb and feeling
[1:31:24] this suffering
[1:31:25] yo yes brothers him I remember doc
[1:31:28] Calabria I remember how he died and
[1:31:30] bowed his head and cried
[1:31:32] oh I remember it I remember brother Tim
[1:31:36] when I when the blood struck my body of
[1:31:38] there and make up left in the shorts and
[1:31:42] the pants and the cigarettes and the
[1:31:43] beer and all those other things they
[1:31:46] just fell off them yeah I remember when
[1:31:49] that happened I remember when the blood
[1:31:52] struck my spirit and there in my memory
[1:31:56] my imagination my conscience my
[1:31:58] affection my reasons all changed
[1:32:02] everything about the Bible became
[1:32:04] different my reasoning
[1:32:07] changed my memory was washed I've no
[1:32:10] longer looked at a drunken party and
[1:32:13] thought wow didn't we have a good time
[1:32:17] right you have that memory once right
[1:32:20] you look back on the party oh man wow
[1:32:22] wow you know did we I mean we drinking
[1:32:25] there was girls and there was you know
[1:32:28] all of the other things that went with
[1:32:30] it I mean you remember that it was a
[1:32:32] great memory but when the blood was
[1:32:34] applied to your memory you look back at
[1:32:38] that same memory and your member had
[1:32:43] been changed you remember something
[1:32:46] different about that are you with me
[1:32:50] hey man you know I saw the wrong my
[1:32:54] conscience was purged by the blood my
[1:32:57] affections in was settle things above
[1:33:02] all brother Jim I assure them that that
[1:33:05] Holy Ghost struck my soul I'm sealed in
[1:33:08] the day of redemption I I'm protected
[1:33:10] from the Angel of Death and it's true
[1:33:13] it's true we're sealed behind the blood
[1:33:15] to never go out again and Satan's sealed
[1:33:18] out we're sealed in
[1:33:20] but the accepting the the death of the
[1:33:25] Lamb and applying gives life to your
[1:33:29] your doorpost of your body spirit and
[1:33:32] soul remember all rounds there was three
[1:33:36] sets of bud one on each side and one
[1:33:38] over the door and it represents we're at
[1:33:42] least we're using that for this sermon
[1:33:44] it's representing the body the spirit
[1:33:47] and the soul because those are all
[1:33:48] entrances and the entrance must be
[1:33:53] covered by the blood
[1:33:55] so you see now and accepting that into
[1:34:01] your life and applying that blood it's
[1:34:04] only a part of the death angels Passover
[1:34:11] so me it's only a part you see that
[1:34:17] wasn't all the instructions applied the
[1:34:20] but now you're free to run around you're
[1:34:23] free to go out you're free to watch the
[1:34:25] fireworks as the Death Angel comes ya
[1:34:28] know you apply this blood you got to be
[1:34:31] inside and you got to be making
[1:34:35] preparations for leaving your hope has
[1:34:38] got to be in one thing I'm leaving here
[1:34:40] I'm not staying here you've got to have
[1:34:43] an anticipation of a rapture I don't
[1:34:46] know what's going on today with
[1:34:47] preachers that taken away the
[1:34:49] anticipation for a rapture but brother
[1:34:51] we should be looking every day every
[1:34:53] moment for the coming of the Lord under
[1:34:56] its axis don't wrap that from the church
[1:35:00] now but do you see there were
[1:35:03] preparations for the journey
[1:35:05] you know these were part of the same
[1:35:07] instructions you must get ready to go
[1:35:11] you you dress yourself you have your
[1:35:15] garments on your shoes on your feet you
[1:35:18] have your stuff in your hands and then
[1:35:21] your needs are you with me
[1:35:25] he just getting the blood and glory to
[1:35:27] God hallelujah I'm really happy now
[1:35:31] that's where I'm bringing the deficit it
[1:35:33] really happened and the death angel who
[1:35:38] you know it is going to pass you by then
[1:35:40] it's going to be more than just saying
[1:35:42] oh I had this experience that the Holy
[1:35:45] Ghost and it washed my body and it
[1:35:47] washed my conscience and my memory and
[1:35:49] affection and I'm sure so my soul isn't
[1:35:51] if it's really there you're gonna be
[1:35:55] making preparations to leave here
[1:35:59] you're gonna have an expectation and
[1:36:05] anticipation a desperation I must not
[1:36:10] miss it now and then you are d now
[1:36:18] eating is a part of your salvation now
[1:36:22] that sounded good to somebody somebody's
[1:36:24] stomach just ground right there it's a
[1:36:29] part of the requirement to cause the
[1:36:32] death angel to pass over so part part of
[1:36:36] this was the plan of the blood part of
[1:36:39] it was done leavened bread and the whole
[1:36:42] lamb and also Pilate is eating it now
[1:36:49] you cannot are you with me you cannot
[1:36:52] expect to see the Death Angel pass and
[1:36:55] you're eating every other kind of
[1:36:57] nonsense feeding on every kind of things
[1:37:00] of the world and your minds and every
[1:37:03] kind of video gaming the evil thing and
[1:37:06] imaginations ready here and running
[1:37:08] there you're attracted here that it's
[1:37:11] gotta be at one thing I believe in bread
[1:37:19] because I got a hat straight for the
[1:37:22] journey I'm gonna have face for a
[1:37:28] rapture and Lord I have that strength
[1:37:32] that comes by that faith by that bread
[1:37:35] and that lamp
[1:37:36] I won't believe I won't be able to go
[1:37:41] I'll be too weak to leave so eating it
[1:37:49] as part of your salvation
[1:37:52] did you know coming to church as part of
[1:37:54] your salvation
[1:37:56] people come half hearted half the time
[1:37:59] mostly none of the time they won't come
[1:38:02] to the house of God
[1:38:03] they saved
[1:38:05] that that thing's wills getting the kids
[1:38:07] death angels working in their families
[1:38:12] your attitude toward Christ is gonna
[1:38:14] have a huge impression on your children
[1:38:16] a man and that's an attitude it's an
[1:38:21] attitude of it doesn't matter it does
[1:38:26] matter it don't just matter you know
[1:38:30] it's just not I eat it every day for the
[1:38:33] team but buddy I'm really into those
[1:38:35] traits and I'm really listening into
[1:38:37] that word and I'm really really reading
[1:38:40] my Bible I really didn't well then come
[1:38:43] to church then I mean if you read your
[1:38:47] Bible you'll come to church I mean
[1:38:49] you'll forsake not the assembling of
[1:38:51] your something you can't read the
[1:38:53] message and decide to stay home from
[1:38:55] church you'll be here every time the
[1:38:58] door is open
[1:39:00] hey mom why because it'll burn in your
[1:39:04] heart I've got to get there
[1:39:07] I'm desperate about this I'm sincere
[1:39:09] about this the servant must be bad I
[1:39:12] must keep him out of my hog and man he
[1:39:16] must not get a place in there anywhere
[1:39:18] is somebody with me a man now so it's
[1:39:23] part of your salvation the whole lamb
[1:39:26] must be eaten with unleavened bread and
[1:39:30] it must be Oh eaten I'd like to show you
[1:39:36] this and we will get into it in a later
[1:39:38] sermon because I'm acting like an old
[1:39:42] man and preaching kind of slow this
[1:39:43] morning but I'm trying to let you just
[1:39:45] seek Him I'm trying to land every word
[1:39:51] with a meaning
[1:39:54] you don't miss it Exodus 12 8 and they
[1:40:00] shall eat the flesh in that night roast
[1:40:03] with fire and unleavened bread with
[1:40:06] bitter herbs shall they eat it eat not a
[1:40:10] bit raw nor sudden it all with water but
[1:40:14] roots with fire his head with his legs
[1:40:18] and with the pertinents thereof and you
[1:40:21] shall lack nothing of it remain until
[1:40:24] the morning oh now we we got this idea
[1:40:29] of this this and this lamb sitting on
[1:40:33] this platter you know a nice leg quarter
[1:40:36] we are maybe a rack of ribs
[1:40:39] that ain't the bass over the Passover is
[1:40:43] the whole lap it was from the head to
[1:40:49] the tail and man I mean it's kind of
[1:40:54] like my wife and I you know went into
[1:40:57] into a woman when the country is over in
[1:41:00] Europe one time and which we ordered
[1:41:02] trout and it comes out but you know I
[1:41:05] had two eyeballs and a whole body of
[1:41:08] fish you know laying out on the platter
[1:41:10] and she said I just can't eat this with
[1:41:13] it looking at me
[1:41:18] but in this Passover it's all served I
[1:41:29] want you to get it now because if you
[1:41:32] look down in verse 46 in chapter 12 and
[1:41:35] what house shall it be eating thyself
[1:41:37] not carry forth out of the flesh abroad
[1:41:41] out of the house neither shall you break
[1:41:44] a bone thereof
[1:41:47] so there couldn't be a bone broken I
[1:41:50] mean it was cooked it was cooked from Ed
[1:41:54] from head to tail hoods all pertinents
[1:41:58] thereof no some say they wash the
[1:42:02] insides I don't know how they did it all
[1:42:04] I know is the whole lamb had to be
[1:42:07] served
[1:42:08] ever been it we're in another Passover
[1:42:14] and in order to go in this Exodus
[1:42:19] you must eat the whole lamb you see
[1:42:26] other ages have cut it up separate the
[1:42:30] lamb discarded what they didn't like I'd
[1:42:33] see them saying spirits that gets right
[1:42:36] in a message and you find that you know
[1:42:39] to make their doctrine work they have
[1:42:40] this whole pile of discards quotes that
[1:42:43] they have to discard to make their
[1:42:44] doctrine work you know why cuz they they
[1:42:48] can't they don't want the whole lamb
[1:42:51] it's Susan not under the token because
[1:42:55] if you're under the token under the life
[1:42:57] of Christ you are get out
[1:42:59] you want the good punch you up the back
[1:43:02] part you are things that are difficult
[1:43:05] to swallow down and you want things that
[1:43:07] are pleasant you want it out let it come
[1:43:11] down to preach and holiness you love
[1:43:13] that man when it comes down to preaching
[1:43:15] about tithing you love that when it's
[1:43:17] written about church attendance you love
[1:43:19] that when it comes down to the seals of
[1:43:22] the mysteries atop you love that you
[1:43:24] love it out the whole lamb must be sold
[1:43:30] not just your part denominations have
[1:43:34] done this three years they discard some
[1:43:37] of it serve only the pieces they want
[1:43:39] they've added eleven to the bread but
[1:43:43] this is our the Passover this is not
[1:43:46] just another feast this is not just a
[1:43:48] commemoration and well it doesn't we
[1:43:50] don't have to pay attention to details
[1:43:52] because there's no that thing's all this
[1:43:54] time no we're in another time where
[1:43:56] there's another death things and this
[1:43:59] was a time where everything's gonna be
[1:44:02] eaten everything's gotta be served some
[1:44:10] our desperation if you don't pass over
[1:44:14] you you'll be left with weeping wailing
[1:44:18] and gnashing of teeth
[1:44:21] you must escape what is coming on the
[1:44:23] earth having part of the lamb will not
[1:44:26] work having bread with 11 of
[1:44:31] denominations won't work either it must
[1:44:35] be the fuel it must be the whole and
[1:44:39] unbroken I love it
[1:44:44] now denominations have run off with
[1:44:46] parts this part this part they serve
[1:44:49] ribs
[1:44:50] this part here serves the breast this
[1:44:52] denomination over here they like the
[1:44:54] hindquarters you know you know they you
[1:44:58] know these this southern they want lamb
[1:44:59] chops and it's something with water and
[1:45:04] spiced up and the word the mean of the
[1:45:07] lamb is impregnated with with the flavor
[1:45:09] of denominations you can go with a
[1:45:12] favorite Baptists or Methodists or
[1:45:15] Pentecostal or whatever and you can get
[1:45:18] your lamb flavor to all kinds of ways it
[1:45:24] can be flavored for the times hello you
[1:45:30] know today we want a gospel flavored for
[1:45:32] the times and so will flavor everything
[1:45:35] I think brother Timothy spoke about the
[1:45:38] vegans the other day you see that's just
[1:45:41] the spirit and the way in the land and
[1:45:43] the last days and brother Bantam called
[1:45:47] it
[1:45:47] this isn't he said it's a non meeting he
[1:45:50] coat he described it a coat and is there
[1:45:54] is there because of the animal rights
[1:45:56] and animal worship and it's a satanic
[1:45:58] spirit that's exactly what it is and you
[1:46:04] come around you know then the spirit
[1:46:05] gets on our girls that you know they
[1:46:08] don't want to lose their identity in
[1:46:09] their husband anymore so they hyphenate
[1:46:11] their names so they can keep their own
[1:46:14] identity it sounds exactly like what has
[1:46:18] happened in the spiritual round there's
[1:46:23] all kinds of things you know that we
[1:46:25] we're the flavour for the times you know
[1:46:27] you're not to preach against sin and you
[1:46:30] know not to say
[1:46:31] homosexuality and perversion is a sin
[1:46:34] you're not supposed to do that because
[1:46:37] we want it flavored for the times and
[1:46:43] that's what is happening today that's
[1:46:46] what people want a gospel they want a
[1:46:48] gospel flavor again to their liking and
[1:46:51] so if they can't find it here for their
[1:46:54] like in they find it somewhere else
[1:46:55] where it's a little easier to eat and
[1:46:57] they serve the pieces I like flavored
[1:47:00] the way I want it that I can have Christ
[1:47:03] and salvation and I can flavor it where
[1:47:06] you know anything can be accepted
[1:47:14] hey ma'am
[1:47:17] so you know as I said denominations have
[1:47:22] have flavored it time we wanted flavored
[1:47:26] for them for the times then I'm gonna
[1:47:28] come down to something because we're in
[1:47:31] our where it's desperation where it
[1:47:36] requires more sincerity come on Amen for
[1:47:42] the first time the pillar of fire has
[1:47:46] cooked the lamb it's been roasted with
[1:47:51] fire of a real fire not a painted fire
[1:47:55] but a real science
[1:47:57] you pay the fire believes it raw and he
[1:48:00] said don't eat around it it not suck
[1:48:03] with water and impregnated with all your
[1:48:06] flavors but I want you to do this get
[1:48:08] the pillar of fire and get it hot
[1:48:11] I'll tell you that ain't nothing wrong
[1:48:14] with the message today the problem is we
[1:48:17] ain't
[1:48:19] [Applause]
[1:48:28] [Applause]
[1:48:32] give the right flavor to a holy man's
[1:48:36] taste but the first time the pillar
[1:48:43] fires cooked the whole lamb from head to
[1:48:50] tail I'm sure the Pentecostal partner
[1:48:57] was served a divine healing and joy and
[1:49:00] baptisms of the Spirit it was heated -
[1:49:04] he got warm got hot
[1:49:07] I'm sure Luther got his hot when he
[1:49:09] started but I'm bringing it down to you
[1:49:13] we're not in the day a part of the lamb
[1:49:17] we're in the day word the whole lamb is
[1:49:20] required the whole lamb is not being
[1:49:26] served the only thing it's unsealed see
[1:49:33] the skins been taken off you don't kick
[1:49:38] it you don't cook it with the skin on it
[1:49:40] right so in order to cook it you know it
[1:49:43] took cooking to see if the skin the lamb
[1:49:45] must be unsealed are you in the now and
[1:49:50] ordered for this word to be received
[1:49:53] you can't cook it with the skin on it
[1:50:00] I'm seeing lab so Allah we believe
[1:50:04] that's all open but the second well you
[1:50:06] still got skin on it you can't cook it
[1:50:09] with that it's got to be skinned got to
[1:50:15] be unsealed the seven seals are open by
[1:50:20] the revelation thereof must be pure
[1:50:23] bread without leaven no knowledge of
[1:50:27] man's interpretation added to it
[1:50:29] to puff it up you know knowledge puffeth
[1:50:34] up and when you get man's knowledge in
[1:50:37] the bread it pops it up
[1:50:39] a man and so and so you see again we're
[1:50:44] back to a time where it's pure bread
[1:50:47] without leaven no leaven no knowledge of
[1:50:51] man's interpretation added to puff it up
[1:50:54] that's what is now being served the
[1:50:58] whole lamb that Paul served is the whole
[1:51:02] I'm that we're now serving a man brother
[1:51:07] madam would talk about this in the
[1:51:08] masterpiece and he said the first
[1:51:10] ministry and the last ministry is the
[1:51:12] same the first message and the second
[1:51:15] last message is the same thing we don't
[1:51:18] have a new message I want to get that if
[1:51:21] I can get anything in this part of this
[1:51:23] service today I want you to get
[1:51:25] something we do not have a different
[1:51:28] message than what Paul please this is
[1:51:34] the original message the fresh message
[1:51:36] and the last message is the same thing I
[1:51:41] was alpha and I'm Omega now this is what
[1:51:46] is happening people can see the truth
[1:51:48] and hear the message and say well you
[1:51:51] know now we got we got we got something
[1:51:53] they didn't have brother Tim you see we
[1:51:55] we got something old Paul didn't have
[1:51:57] you know well I'll tell you if you do if
[1:52:00] you do have something different than
[1:52:02] what Paul preached you're cursed well we
[1:52:07] have something more than Apollo you're
[1:52:09] cursed we have the seals at and before
[1:52:15] you know Matt and before the seals
[1:52:17] heaven declared that brother Branham
[1:52:20] preached what Paul preached but after
[1:52:22] the seals brother Bradley got something
[1:52:24] more than you're cursed by the way just
[1:52:30] to straighten all of that out he was
[1:52:32] seen himself when he would enter into
[1:52:34] death and when he entered into death
[1:52:36] they told him you preach what Paul
[1:52:38] preached
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:41] in the Laodicean age he said the spirit
[1:52:45] will not speak in another age this is
[1:52:48] the last message the ages are over but
[1:52:51] thank God at this moment this agent is
[1:52:54] not over he is yet crying in his cries
[1:52:59] not only in the spiritual ears of men by
[1:53:01] his spirit but once again a prophet is
[1:53:03] in the land once more God will reveal
[1:53:06] the truth as he did to Paul somebody
[1:53:09] came in on this man once more God will
[1:53:13] reveal the truth as he did to Paul in
[1:53:16] the days of the seventh messenger in the
[1:53:18] days of the Laodicean age its messenger
[1:53:21] will reveal the mysteries of God as
[1:53:23] revealed to Paul he will speak out and
[1:53:27] those who receive that prophet in his
[1:53:29] own name will receive the benefit
[1:53:30] beneficence effect of that province
[1:53:33] ministry day that will hear him will be
[1:53:35] blessed become a part of that bride in
[1:53:37] the last days who are mentioned in
[1:53:39] revelation 22:17 the spirit in the
[1:53:42] bride's that come the quart of wheat the
[1:53:44] bride wheat that fell into the ground
[1:53:47] that Nicaea has come back to the
[1:53:49] original word grain again again not a
[1:53:54] different one again
[1:53:56] praise God forever yes listen to the
[1:53:59] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:54:01] in this last stage what he says from God
[1:54:03] the bride will say and the spirit and
[1:54:05] the prophet and the bride would be
[1:54:07] saying the same thing and what they will
[1:54:09] say will have already been said in the
[1:54:14] word hey man you know when brother
[1:54:19] Branham first approached the seven seals
[1:54:22] and he tells us in services this the
[1:54:24] time he speaks about them he said their
[1:54:27] seals in the book and then their seals
[1:54:29] on the backside and that's what he
[1:54:32] thought he thought those seals on the
[1:54:35] backside were revelations on the outside
[1:54:37] the book but then he comes down to one
[1:54:42] of his last sermons and he says at the
[1:54:44] beginning of the seals so seven angels
[1:54:46] came down this is from spiritual food
[1:54:49] and due season angels came down in that
[1:54:52] pyramid
[1:54:52] Foreman stood down and told me to return
[1:54:54] back to speak on those seven seals and
[1:54:56] he'd be with me he'd show me what they
[1:54:59] were the lost things the seals were the
[1:55:03] lost things I always thought it was
[1:55:07] sealed on the back of the book and it
[1:55:09] was something it be something that
[1:55:11] wasn't wrote in the book but it turned
[1:55:13] out then it was made known that he
[1:55:15] cannot do that it is not something
[1:55:19] written in the book is something that's
[1:55:20] been hid in the book for whosoever shall
[1:55:23] take one word from it or add one word to
[1:55:26] it so it's a mystery that has been the
[1:55:28] in the book in these seven ages and each
[1:55:31] one of them produced a mystery about
[1:55:33] water baptism these other things they
[1:55:35] stumbled of so long so brother Brennan
[1:55:38] said no it's not on the outside the book
[1:55:40] it's not a it's not something added to
[1:55:43] the book it was something hidden in the
[1:55:46] book and what I'm trying to get to you
[1:55:49] if we you see it was previously known to
[1:55:54] the church now brother bang tells his
[1:55:57] story of talking to a man who tried to
[1:55:59] trap him and the man said you know
[1:56:01] brother Brandon with your great gifts
[1:56:03] you can get you can get a direct word
[1:56:05] from God and breathe names that are not
[1:56:07] even in the Bible and you know the
[1:56:09] marlins did this Joseph Smith claimed to
[1:56:14] receive tablets which were they made us
[1:56:17] they claimed were additions to the Bible
[1:56:20] so they have the Book of Mormon but I
[1:56:24] want you to understand what we received
[1:56:26] today is not an addition to the Bible we
[1:56:31] don't have the Bible plus we have the
[1:56:33] word has revealed the Pope now he tells
[1:56:38] him this theologian that tried to catch
[1:56:40] him and said to him with your experience
[1:56:42] brother Brown that the Lord has given
[1:56:44] you first people you'd be eligible to
[1:56:47] write a Bible yourself your word that
[1:56:50] God has manifested now what's it sounds
[1:56:52] real good you you know with your gifts
[1:56:55] with what you have is a gifted man you
[1:56:59] can write a Bible to yourself and
[1:57:03] brother Branham said but you see
[1:57:05] I couldn't do that he said well why
[1:57:08] couldn't you you've got the
[1:57:09] qualifications he said but look one word
[1:57:12] cannot be added or taken away so well
[1:57:15] then seven thunders wouldn't it be great
[1:57:17] then seven thunders blasting out would
[1:57:19] that be a revelation given to some man I
[1:57:21] said no sir it would be adding something
[1:57:24] or taking something from it's all
[1:57:26] revealed in there and the seven seals
[1:57:28] opened up the revelation of what that
[1:57:30] was that's what it was and it C is still
[1:57:33] in the word you see you can't get out of
[1:57:36] the word it won't leave the word and
[1:57:38] God's Spirit will never leave that word
[1:57:40] it'll stay right with the word behind
[1:57:43] did something open to the eyes of others
[1:57:46] he'll always do that you see it's a
[1:57:51] terrible misunderstanding that somehow
[1:57:53] today we got something different a
[1:57:57] further revelation than st. Paul we got
[1:57:59] something more I think that we made that
[1:58:03] conclusion by acknowledging that Paul
[1:58:06] didn't know the mysteries of the book of
[1:58:08] Revelation from what we can tell in the
[1:58:10] time and that Paul was called home
[1:58:12] before the book of Revelation was
[1:58:13] revealed to John it would come sometimes
[1:58:18] some years afterwards so Paul didn't
[1:58:23] know that and so now because we are now
[1:58:28] privileged to understand these mysteries
[1:58:30] so that we come to the conclusion now we
[1:58:33] got something to Paul didn't out while
[1:58:37] it's true that the book of Revelation
[1:58:39] wasn't given until after Paul went off
[1:58:42] the scene and yeah he had never heard
[1:58:46] about the horse riders and the seals and
[1:58:48] the seven thunders he'd never he'd never
[1:58:51] heard of that vision and he it wasn't he
[1:58:53] it wasn't made known to him you know and
[1:58:57] it wasn't given until Paul was off the
[1:58:59] scene yet Paul for Paul the truths of
[1:59:04] the book had not yet been sealed I want
[1:59:09] to give something to you
[1:59:10] Paul had and preached from an open book
[1:59:14] he did not preach from a sealed up book
[1:59:17] it got closed because of the Antichrist
[1:59:21] spirit would close it off to us but it
[1:59:25] would be it would be the removing of
[1:59:27] those Antichrist doctored that would
[1:59:30] bring us back to what Paul preached not
[1:59:33] something different the same gospel so
[1:59:37] when some Paul did not need to add the
[1:59:40] seals open the book was already open you
[1:59:47] see for Paul the truths of the Bible are
[1:59:50] not sealed water baptism predestination
[1:59:53] security of the believers all the other
[1:59:56] truths even about the Anti Christ all in
[2:00:00] these truths then you know what would
[2:00:03] happen is to the agents that became
[2:00:05] obscure and that's mysterious
[2:00:08] and through the church Aegis they they
[2:00:12] become unclear to man and we didn't know
[2:00:15] and we had different Reclamation's that
[2:00:18] come along to reveal parts of it or make
[2:00:21] parts of it known they couldn't get the
[2:00:23] whole line brother Brandon have said my
[2:00:26] job is to tie up the loose ends to bring
[2:00:30] it into one message truths that they had
[2:00:33] here and revealed Darren whatever to
[2:00:35] bring it into one message so well the
[2:00:39] seals that do that that's not what he
[2:00:41] said
[2:00:42] he said the seals tied up the loose ends
[2:00:45] it brought it back into one message
[2:00:48] again it exposed the Antichrist spirit
[2:00:50] and how he had brought deception to the
[2:00:52] jurors so you see again again what we do
[2:00:57] how by God's grace we understand now the
[2:01:01] journey you see the the book of
[2:01:05] Revelation would show the journey that
[2:01:08] the church has been through it would
[2:01:11] show the seven ages seven messengers it
[2:01:15] would show I endtime prophecies and and
[2:01:18] how the Antichrist spirit come in with
[2:01:20] that with a with the the white horse
[2:01:23] rider and the red and the black and the
[2:01:25] pale it would do all of these
[2:01:27] so we by God's grace we can understand
[2:01:30] the journey of the church as we come
[2:01:33] down to the aegis and we received as the
[2:01:36] Bible said in Revelation 10 the voices
[2:01:39] of thunders that revealed the symbol of
[2:01:41] each seals but the seals did not open up
[2:01:45] new truths if it opened up the truths
[2:01:51] that the church what's happened so you
[2:01:55] see these were truths that were
[2:01:58] previously known it opened up the Bible
[2:02:02] forests and it brought us truths that
[2:02:04] had been lost to thee through the
[2:02:07] denomination ages we are not preaching
[2:02:10] today I want to emphasize it we are not
[2:02:13] preaching truths that Paul didn't preach
[2:02:18] denominations are the ones guilty of
[2:02:20] preaching what Paul didn't preach that
[2:02:23] preach the Trinity come on listen this
[2:02:27] is a one God Bible here lives with the
[2:02:31] Lord that God is one Lord and it's
[2:02:34] Regenesis - revelation of one God Bible
[2:02:36] he was God witness in the Old Testament
[2:02:39] God witness in Christ and now God
[2:02:44] witness in the Holy Ghost same God same
[2:02:48] one not three persons one God and
[2:02:54] baptism never was in titles of Father
[2:02:57] Son and Holy Ghost all through the book
[2:02:59] of Acts
[2:03:00] every place he ever baptized was in the
[2:03:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:03:06] so you see you see they they preach a
[2:03:10] Trinity Paul didn't breach the Trinity
[2:03:12] they preach frequent instead of a
[2:03:14] Mersenne Paul didn't preach sprinklin
[2:03:16] they preach that even Apple Paul didn't
[2:03:20] preach that he said it's a serpent
[2:03:22] Batali's so I'm afraid you lose your
[2:03:25] virginity she did come on hey man
[2:03:30] Paul didn't preach that you see the
[2:03:33] opening of the seals over at the book
[2:03:35] and showed the truth of what
[2:03:37] denominations had made
[2:03:39] mysterious and these were these were
[2:03:44] were however revealed truths to the
[2:03:48] Apostle Paul we did not have another
[2:03:51] gospel than what Paul preached it is not
[2:03:54] a further word it is a continuation of
[2:03:58] the Apostles doctrine now I can I can
[2:04:02] hear some protests but Paul didn't know
[2:04:04] the symbols of the horse riders right
[2:04:06] Paul didn't need to know that the riders
[2:04:09] were demon powers that distorted the
[2:04:11] truth and closed the book and made it
[2:04:13] mysterious but these truths were known
[2:04:15] by Paul and we had returned back to his
[2:04:18] gospel Paul was already telling us about
[2:04:21] the rider that would come riding through
[2:04:24] the church to concrete he told us this
[2:04:26] was the a as I said this was a known
[2:04:28] truth to Paul he said listen these
[2:04:31] brothers were preachers Democrats is
[2:04:33] already here said he's a spirit of the
[2:04:37] Antichrist
[2:04:38] they called him what it was a spirit he
[2:04:41] said it's already working and it's
[2:04:43] already of the church he would go ahead
[2:04:48] and he would preach about the man of sin
[2:04:51] of spirit of seduction that would soon
[2:04:53] conquer the church and finally with the
[2:04:55] man of sin being worshipped in the
[2:04:58] church instead of the real Christ Paul
[2:05:00] preached this so these these were truce
[2:05:04] these were Tris Paul preached some
[2:05:09] brother branham in question answer 64
[2:05:11] would say said some great theologian
[2:05:14] tried to corner me on that said brother
[2:05:16] branham dog will give you some day the
[2:05:18] secret of those seven seals and those
[2:05:21] seven seals will be something that we've
[2:05:23] never learned yet that'll be something
[2:05:26] that's not even the Bible he said no no
[2:05:29] it won't be that because if you do if I
[2:05:33] told you that I would be a false prophet
[2:05:36] because this were there everything that
[2:05:39] the whole revelation of Jesus Christ is
[2:05:42] all completed in this word and if the
[2:05:45] seven seals pertained to the seven
[2:05:48] churches it had to be already passed
[2:05:49] because we're in the Laodicean church
[2:05:52] the seven seals is only revealing what
[2:05:54] they had left off back there listen I
[2:05:57] only revealing what they had left off
[2:05:59] back there and it opened up what they
[2:06:01] left then he explained what Luther
[2:06:03] laughs what Wesley left all the
[2:06:06] Reformers and Pentecostals all down to
[2:06:09] this present time what am I trying to
[2:06:12] tell you this is not a new message this
[2:06:16] is a same message we from the beginning
[2:06:23] it's the same gospel man this is return
[2:06:28] back to the same gospel back to the
[2:06:31] beginning back to Pentecost again back
[2:06:35] to the purity of the book of Acts again
[2:06:41] he said he would even he repeats this
[2:06:45] several times tells his story he's a
[2:06:47] brother branham this theologian said
[2:06:49] that seven seals brother Branham be
[2:06:51] revealed the last day some great mystery
[2:06:53] how to get closer to God he said you see
[2:06:56] that's what the Mormons think they think
[2:06:58] they can they're closer to God because
[2:07:00] of their addition their sacred plates or
[2:07:03] tablets that Joseph Smith found and this
[2:07:05] brings him closer to God he said no sir
[2:07:08] he can't me whosoever shall take one
[2:07:11] word from this mic or add one form to it
[2:07:15] his part will be taken the book of life
[2:07:19] what it is is a revelation on what has
[2:07:23] been missed back there to bring it's
[2:07:25] already wrote here it's in here it's to
[2:07:29] reveal what has already been written
[2:07:30] because you can't add one thing to it or
[2:07:33] take one word from it and then he holds
[2:07:36] up his Bible and he and he Pat's the
[2:07:38] Bible he says this is a complete
[2:07:41] revelation of Jesus Christ and the seven
[2:07:44] seals had the mysteries here of what it
[2:07:47] was and is all supposed to open in the
[2:07:49] last day at the Laodicean age at the end
[2:07:52] of time
[2:07:54] hallelujah and that finishes a message
[2:07:58] to the church because it brings us back
[2:08:00] to the Bible
[2:08:03] again he would speak of this and he says
[2:08:07] it's the mystery seven seals would be
[2:08:10] open reveal all those mysteries that's
[2:08:12] been hid through the Reformers not hid
[2:08:15] from Apostle Paul hid from the Reformers
[2:08:18] and hit by them there again said you
[2:08:25] can't add he said you can add to the
[2:08:28] church to take from the church but don't
[2:08:30] you add to that word to take from it
[2:08:32] because God would take your name right
[2:08:34] off the book of life and that's your
[2:08:36] finish then you can't add to it or take
[2:08:38] from it finally in conclusion of this as
[2:08:42] we go on he tells us in Shreveport one
[2:08:46] of his last sermons he says now somebody
[2:08:50] said to me well now some day the Lord
[2:08:52] will probably use seeing visions brother
[2:08:54] Branham will reveal to you what these
[2:08:56] things are and we can all get closer to
[2:08:57] God and have more power than we get and
[2:08:59] speaking in tongues and things I said it
[2:09:01] can't be that way because I believe the
[2:09:05] word to be the truth and the Bible said
[2:09:07] who servants will add one word or take
[2:09:09] one word from it it has to be in this
[2:09:12] word it's the mystery that the people's
[2:09:15] overlooked and right there is word my
[2:09:18] message the Serpent's Eden to true
[2:09:20] believers security of the believer so
[2:09:24] now what is he emphasizing does we
[2:09:27] didn't get a new message we got the same
[2:09:30] message
[2:09:33] therefore it must have the same results
[2:09:37] and will when we eat the whole lamb you
[2:09:43] see it's not a new doctrine it's the
[2:09:45] original doctrine it's the original word
[2:09:49] back again oh this is this is really
[2:09:52] important that we understand that this
[2:09:55] is where we have been brought to in this
[2:09:57] hour of the death angel
[2:09:58] we must have the pure word again
[2:10:02] Amen not an addition now so he tells
[2:10:06] about you see because some of them they
[2:10:08] want this apartment they don't want that
[2:10:10] and yet they say we believe this word we
[2:10:13] believe this Bible and so
[2:10:15] tell us about a man was on a radio
[2:10:18] program down in Tucson said the
[2:10:20] Pentecostal religion is nothing but a
[2:10:22] sham don't listen to it it's unstable
[2:10:24] any man who spoke in tongues and these
[2:10:26] things claimed they were healed is sick
[2:10:28] and so forth my prayer it was to leave
[2:10:30] away from it and to pray for those poor
[2:10:33] decrepit people because they were in an
[2:10:35] illusion that there's something wrong
[2:10:37] with him he's at all how I don't like to
[2:10:40] talk to that brother for a little while
[2:10:42] and he said he said that was only given
[2:10:46] for the Apostles on the day of Pentecost
[2:10:48] and that's all it was now that same
[2:10:51] devil tells us we can't have all the
[2:10:55] land today everybody comes and says it
[2:11:00] was only given to the Prophet you know
[2:11:03] recently I was up in Arkansas with
[2:11:05] brother Ron Spencer there and they he
[2:11:08] testified about some of the visions that
[2:11:10] we know personally firsthand that took
[2:11:12] place some woman comes running up to him
[2:11:15] after church and says you you say you
[2:11:17] saw visions only brother Branham could
[2:11:19] do that now where do we get this so we
[2:11:24] got to strike that out of the Bible
[2:11:26] we've got to take that part of the Lamb
[2:11:29] that says all men sin during dreams and
[2:11:31] young men shall see visions we got to
[2:11:36] take parts of the lamb away today
[2:11:38] because it's we've got to change it for
[2:11:41] the times you see even recently another
[2:11:47] preacher after hearing the testimonies
[2:11:49] of healing the miracle working power God
[2:11:52] said we don't need another Superman you
[2:11:58] see they don't want the Spirit of God
[2:11:59] working in the church so with their
[2:12:02] gentle spirits they condemn it if it's
[2:12:06] not working through the ministry that
[2:12:08] has it on the one through the lanty and
[2:12:11] when god's always walked through the
[2:12:13] ministry he had downs them he sets them
[2:12:16] apart and gives a special gift for their
[2:12:19] ministry
[2:12:21] oh man and they're part of the body hey
[2:12:24] man we're not we want Peter and James
[2:12:26] and John to testify what God was doing
[2:12:29] and say we don't want to hear such
[2:12:31] testimonies of that I'd rather just hear
[2:12:37] a mother you know give a testimony than
[2:12:40] to hear the ministry you see jealous
[2:12:42] spirits don't want to supernatural but
[2:12:45] let me tell you this the supernatural
[2:12:48] makes supermen and if you get the super
[2:12:56] gospel if you get the supernatural
[2:12:59] you'll have Superman you'll have super
[2:13:02] weapon come oh yeah well we just would
[2:13:06] you know I'd rather hear I've read here
[2:13:08] just some some mother telling testimony
[2:13:11] that and then another Superman well let
[2:13:13] me just tell you let's tell a testimony
[2:13:15] let's tell the testimony of a man by the
[2:13:18] name of Philip and he had four dollar
[2:13:21] virgin daughters at prophesied a man
[2:13:26] wonder wonder if we would like to hear
[2:13:28] that there's virgin daughters or there's
[2:13:30] two daughters of God that prophesy what
[2:13:34] we like to hear that they're still
[2:13:36] healing the sick casting out Devils
[2:13:40] demonstrating the gospel would we want
[2:13:43] to hear that and what to do that there's
[2:13:46] got to be a super Church
[2:13:48] [Applause]
[2:13:48] [Music]
[2:13:53] [Applause]
[2:14:07] [Applause]
[2:14:25] [Applause]
[2:14:40] Devils are being Casa and the sick are
[2:14:43] healed the needs of the people are met
[2:14:50] mine case you don't like to hear all of
[2:14:53] that maybe I should just down the line
[2:14:55] and go through what a super Church is
[2:14:58] doing hallelujah right here in this
[2:15:03] super Church the supernatural God is
[2:15:09] working in a supernatural way
[2:15:12] man there's sister Lila City right over
[2:15:14] there and met one day with cancer
[2:15:17] all through her lungs and the next day
[2:15:20] none
[2:15:23] I'll go into his name because we were
[2:15:27] leaning on the everlasting arms
[2:15:29] it happened it's not an imagination it
[2:15:33] happened there's little pariah through
[2:15:35] it without a piece you they're totally
[2:15:38] for glory has people in a separates and
[2:15:52] then even ministers faces brother
[2:15:54] Branham said will bless when you when
[2:15:57] they're asked but do you believe the
[2:15:58] Word of God Word said these signs shall
[2:16:01] follow them that believe even ministers
[2:16:03] faces will bless are you saying to say
[2:16:06] Oh divine here are you saved to the fall
[2:16:08] gospel the full lamb are you saying that
[2:16:12] your Pentecostal experience that's being
[2:16:15] ashamed of this word that's his word
[2:16:17] made flesh in him hallelujah are you at
[2:16:21] me to a man all brother branham said in
[2:16:25] the indictment he said no wonder they
[2:16:26] can't be in miracles no wonder you can't
[2:16:28] believe in the supernatural
[2:16:30] no wonder they condemn it the reason
[2:16:33] they can dim it back there is the same
[2:16:35] reason they can dim it today they are
[2:16:37] guilty as guilty believe because only
[2:16:39] under the shed blood and those who are
[2:16:42] dare some little brother who dares walk
[2:16:45] under the under humility to take God in
[2:16:47] His Word and walked out there and
[2:16:49] confess his sin and forget all these
[2:16:51] dumpers and things and stand there under
[2:16:53] the blood and believe it they want to
[2:16:55] call him a fanatic they want to clasp
[2:16:57] him as we'd say it's not a good word in
[2:16:59] a pulpit to use but doing so you'll
[2:17:01] understand he's an oddball in other
[2:17:03] words we don't want a Superman you see
[2:17:09] this gospel don't make one man a
[2:17:12] Superman but it makes the churches super
[2:17:16] jerks
[2:17:17] a church that can testify hey ma'am you
[2:17:23] lured to go to church that can testify
[2:17:27] I'm sure you you've already heard of it
[2:17:30] where I stood there with a and preached
[2:17:32] about ARRA was there in Israel and spoke
[2:17:35] about a barren church and a bad trade
[2:17:38] for a barren women and men one was one
[2:17:41] of them that I prayed for was my
[2:17:43] daughter Bethany and she's coming right
[2:17:45] now into her third or fourth month of
[2:17:47] pregnancy again and carrying that baby
[2:17:50] with a strong heartbeat why because God
[2:17:54] is still working in the supernatural
[2:17:55] he's still God my wife right there's a
[2:18:00] testimony of a woman that with a brain
[2:18:03] bleed ain't that big as a saucer and God
[2:18:06] Richard mercy moved on the scene doctor
[2:18:13] would say look there you've been looking
[2:18:17] there I'd wear a vision had been taken
[2:18:19] away and was now restored and would say
[2:18:21] marvelous wonderful look back at the MRI
[2:18:24] and say girl you're a miracle what is
[2:18:29] that because of a supernatural church
[2:18:32] amen because we eating the whole lamb
[2:18:34] and in the lab that's healing there's
[2:18:37] reasons let's get to the spirit divine
[2:18:42] healing there's a seven seals have been
[2:18:45] revealed and the procedure may be a
[2:18:47] priest ball of desert the whole lamb is
[2:18:50] there now let's bring it down Father's
[2:19:00] Day this is Father's Day
[2:19:07] what if your brother branham uses this
[2:19:10] illustration what if your son you said
[2:19:14] this little boy here is my son and he
[2:19:18] says who me beat your son but what do
[2:19:24] you think I am what you think that would
[2:19:29] embarrass you is a father you say that
[2:19:32] about your boy this is my son me have
[2:19:34] not that old man son and he said that's
[2:19:39] today is what's wrong with so-called
[2:19:42] Christianity if you name the name of
[2:19:45] denominations okay they all accept the
[2:19:47] fatherhood a denomination but when it
[2:19:49] comes to accepting the fatherhood of the
[2:19:51] word of God Christ no they're
[2:19:55] embarrassed they don't want to say yes I
[2:19:58] have spoke with tongues yes I have seen
[2:20:01] visions yes I believe in divine healing
[2:20:04] yes I praise the Lord I'm free from all
[2:20:12] organization so I'm not bowing down vide
[2:20:14] of that I'm a servant of Christ oh my
[2:20:16] that just tear them to pieces
[2:20:20] hmm and he says but when you come in
[2:20:25] contact with God which is the word no
[2:20:28] words been made plain and manifested to
[2:20:30] him there's no sameness about it you're
[2:20:33] not embarrassed it don't embarrass me to
[2:20:35] say I believe every word of God it don't
[2:20:39] embarrass me when the Lord says to say
[2:20:41] anything you go you go say it and do it
[2:20:43] it don't embarrass me to say I've been
[2:20:46] filled with the Holy Ghost it don't
[2:20:49] embarrass me to say I've spoken with
[2:20:51] other tongues it don't embarrass me to
[2:20:53] say our Lord has showed me visions it
[2:20:56] don't embarrass me to say he's the same
[2:20:59] yesterday today and forever a man now so
[2:21:07] the whole line is this man was saying on
[2:21:12] this radio program that was only given
[2:21:15] for the Apostles at the day of Pentecost
[2:21:18] and that was all he said
[2:21:20] find thirty years later Paul was
[2:21:24] ordained and these gifts in the church
[2:21:25] in 1st Corinthians 15 and he sat in the
[2:21:29] church the gift of speaking in tongues
[2:21:31] and miracles and all these other gifts
[2:21:33] were said in the church jesus said go
[2:21:35] into all the world preach the gospel to
[2:21:36] every creature how far all the world who
[2:21:38] to every creature and they've never
[2:21:40] received it yet and these signs of all
[2:21:42] of them that believe how long all the
[2:21:43] world who to ever greets heard these
[2:21:45] signs and following all the world ever
[2:21:46] greets heard these signs of other than
[2:21:48] that believe in my name they shall cast
[2:21:50] out devils speak with new tongues they
[2:21:52] said taking up deadly things or serpent
[2:21:54] drinking a deadly thing it was not
