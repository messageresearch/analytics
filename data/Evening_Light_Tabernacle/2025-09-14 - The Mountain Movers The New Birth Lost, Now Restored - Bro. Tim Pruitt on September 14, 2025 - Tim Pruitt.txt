Through your preious blood, I found pardoned. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins all wash away. No one knew how alone I was feeling. And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide. Though I laughed and said my life was fine without you. I was covering up the secret tears. I cried and one day someone told me of your mercy [Music] and the love you showed on a hill called Calvary. There you died and purchased my redemption. When you broke sin's power, set my spirit free. Oh, I'm amazed that you love me. Oh, I'm amazed how you care. Through your preious blood, I found pardon. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. Oh, my sins are washed away. Yes, it's true. There have been days when I failed you. Lord, you know the many times I've gone astray, but I've learned your love is stronger than my weakness. And your ear is open every time I pray. No one else has ever cared for me like you, Lord. Other friends could never be as close to me. I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow. Knowing you are everything I'll ever need. Oh, I'm amazed. Oh, yes I am. I'm amazed how you care. [Music] I found pardon. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. Oh, my sins. Let's stand together. Sing it again. Oh, I'm amazed. that you love me. I'm amazed. [Music] Oh, how you care. Precious blood I found pardoned. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. Oh, my sins are washed away. Hallelujah. Aren't you thankful your sins have been washed away by the blood of Jesus? Amen. I want to remember tonight or today, brother Glenn Westerfield been very sick for the last few days and doctors hadn't been able to find a diagnosis. Also the children of brother Jason Tagert is very sick with hand and foot. So I want to remember them today. Also pray for brother James Hollis having problems with his other eye. One he hasn't had surgery on yet. So make it's making it very difficult to see. Brother Alvin Adams request prayer for his hands still hurting him. Uh brother Gary Stanky his back is hurting really bad today. He just needs a touch from the Lord. Also remember Joe, brother Joe Adams as he's ministering down in Mexico and brother Jonathan is with him and maybe others as well that the Lord will be with them and give them a wonderful time there. How many would have a need just want to make it known to the Lord. I mean I'm ask brother Aaron if he'd come and open up our service today in prayer and Amen. just pray together and ask God to minister to these needs this morning. [Music] Amen. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just want to take a moment right now and say thank you, Lord. We're thankful, Lord, for everything that you've done, Lord. Lord, knowing that your hand has been upon our lives, Lord, from Lord, from before the foundation of the world, you saw us, you knew us, and you cared for us, Lord. Lord, I want to thank you for this opportunity this morning to gather here, Lord, to lift up your name and to to worship you, Father. For truly you deserve it, Lord, for the opportunity to come and have you speak to us, for the opportunity to to be in your presence, Lord. How many today, Lord, don't have, Lord, what we have, Lord, with this opportunity. And Lord, I just pray that no one will, Lord, let this opportunity pass us by, but may we take full advantage of it today and grab a hold to it and give our everything, Lord. Lord, I just want to lay aside the events of the week past, Lord, and lay aside maybe what I'm looking forward to in next week and and just enter in this morning with my whole heart. Give you my everything and allow you to speak to me, Lord, and change me and mold me. And Lord, we just want to praise you and and create an atmosphere that you feel welcome in this morning. That you that you are pleased with and that you'll come down and begin to deal with lives and deal with hearts, Father. And Lord, we don't just gather out of tradition. We're not just just here to see one another or fulfill a duty, Lord, but we want to be changed in your presence this morning, Father. And we want the word to have its full effect. So, Lord, right now, we're going to open up ourselves and ask today that not only will you anoint our minister, Lord, but you'll anoint me and you'll anoint every hearer today. That Lord, that the word can take its effect in our lives and the word will fall on good ground and will allow it to change us, Father. Lord, we thank you for this opportunity. We thank you that you're still the healer. Lord, you heard the many needs, Lord, right across this desk from from Brother Gary to brother Hollis and the Tagert children, Lord. And you know each one, Brother Alvin, that's suffering, Father. You see the needs in the body, Lord. You know the ones that I I can't recall, Father. But not only do you know, but you've provided and you've taken stripes, Lord. And and I'm asking today, Lord. I'm asking that you'll go to each one of these needs, each one that was mentioned. And may your healing angel begin to go on their behalf even now, Lord, and begin to work in those bodies, Father. Lord, we know that this is an imperfect time and that sickness still comes, but we know the stripes you took still work, Lord. And that the word that says that you are our healer, Lord. That by your stripes, we're healed. It still works today, Father. Lord, and we're standing on your promises and we're believing today and asking you to move, Lord. Lord, you see your little bride today gathered around the world. Lord, in churches, Lord, all over this country, all around the globe. Lord, I pray that you'll meet with them. Lord, I pray you'll speak. I pray, Lord, that you'll help each one of us come to that place. Lord, I don't want to be one hindering. Lord, I don't want to be one not ready. Lord, I pray we'll all get ready today, Lord, that Lord, when it's time, we're ready to go, Father. Lord, we just ask you to move in this service in a special way. I want to remember our brother Joe this morning, Lord. Ministering there in Mexico, Lord. We're here in good reports. I pray that you'll just pour out your your spirit. Pour out a blessing. Strengthen him and give him wisdom, Lord, for every service. I pray we ask you now, Lord, to move in this service to have your way here, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. Just want to say that we've made quite a bit of changes to the sound and things. a complete change out. Going to be a lot of changes here on the platform as well. So, be looking for that. But, so if you see some people and some moving parts, that's what that's all about. God bless you today.

I lift it up, Lord. Come and quench this thirsting of my soul. [Music] Bread of heaven, [Music] won't you feed me till I want no more? Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me home. Before we pray this morning, just thinking about the age, the time that we're living, and it's a troublesome time, a troublesome hour. We've had in recent days a tragedy that has hit our nation. And I know that it's grieved the hearts of many. And we're a man that was righteous standing for what he knew. is just his life snuffed out in just a moment. And I just wanted to say, God, help us to be faithful to the call of duty in this critical hour. I'm inspired by this wonderful quote where brother Brandham once prayed for us and said, "Anoint ministers, Lord, like flames of fire, making the last call the sign of the last day. And we too must stand under that anointing today. We're called to go forth in his name knowing that the bride is the last sign, the final voice to a dying world. And Satan is doing everything he can to silence the voice of the righteous because we are his voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the voice of many waters as said in Revelations 1:15. And our voices today blend with the mighty men and women of the past. We're testifying of the same Christ, the same word, the same spirit, the same power. I think today of Stephen, the first martyr who was stoned because he spoke words that God put in his mouth that others didn't want to hear. And recall the prophets and the apostles and of our Lord himself who often spoke hard truths and bore great persecutions rather than compromise the word. The book of Isaiah admonishes us to cry loud and spare not, but lift up thy voice like a trumpet. Paul would tell us, "Preach the word, be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine." [Music] The book of Proverbs says that the righteous are bold as a lion while the wicked flee when no man pursueth. And we can remember these words of Jesus. Blessed are you when men, people insult you and persecute you and falsely say things, all kinds of evil things against you because of me. But rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven. So therefore today we want to do as Paul admonished us and as he said that it's granted to you on the behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him. So I tell you today let us speak boldly. Let's refuse to be silenced &gt;&gt; in this perverse generation. Let's earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Let's stand as flames of fire to herald his coming. Jesus commissioned us. Go into all the world and preach. And our commission is a command. And we are the living voice of God in this hour. And if others fall silent in fear or compromise, let us not. The cost of truth may be high, but the cost of silence is even greater. [Music] May we have the courage, the career, the clarity, the fire to bear witness no matter what. May we go forward with courage and unity and unquenchable fire until ever last soul is called and the bride is ready. Realizing we have a job to do and a mission to fulfill to take this gospel to all the world. Don't be afraid to testify, to witness, to live a life a shining example before others. Bear the cross. Hold forth the banner. Let's live today as if today were our last because we never know when we will be called. The rapture is imminent. The coming of the Lord is at hand. Let's prepare our hearts. Let's leave no one behind. Let's encourage everyone to press the mark, to have a greater passion, a greater desire, a greater ferveny to serve God. Today, as we just bow our heads and ask God's blessings over the word, maybe you would like to be remembered in prayer as we pray and say, "God, help me to have a passion for the truth and to stand for righteousness." Sodom. This Sodom world hates us. It would snuff out our light. But Jesus Christ will herald the light all the way to the end through a bride. Father, in the name of Jesus, we love you today and we thank you for the many blessings you bestowed upon our lives. the grace that has been shown to us, the love that has been given. And Lord, we are here saying today, here's my cup. Fill it up. Let it overflow so that I can be a witness to others. Let not me be one who would hide my candle under a bushel, but let me tell the world Jesus saves and that there is a life worth living. Living for you means everything. I pray, dear God, that you'll bless us together in your presence. Let your Holy Spirit anoint us today. May we do more than just say words, but Father, may the spirit of God come upon the word and anoint it to every heart. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. If you turn to your Bibles, we're going to be reading from the scriptures this morning. And and uh today I'm going to be speaking on the new birth, lost now restored. And um of course you know our subject has been on the mountain movers where that we have we have um been quoting from this scripture. Who art thou oh great mountain? Thou shalt become a plain and the headstone shall be brought forth with shoutings crying grace grace unto it. And I want you to understand there's been great favor that has been poured out upon this generation. Which is why that God has sent a message in this last day to prepare the hearts of the people and turn them back to the faith of the fathers. And that's grace. But in order to do so, there had to be mountains that were moved out of the way and valleys of neglected truth that had to be exalted. And of course, we're part of that where God is bringing a great restoration this day, not only of his word, but of a people that is called by his name who will be united with him. And so today, we're going to take our scripture reading from John 3:1. There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God. For no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him." And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus sth unto him, how can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born? And Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, you must be born again. The wind bloweth where it list, and thou hears the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it cometh, and whence it whether it goeth. So is everyone that is born of the spirit. God bless you. Can be seated. We're so happy to have every one of you today that has gathered with us. And I feel uh very privileged that you are here today and want to share in this in these moments together. And you know, Sunday is a day where we come together, put two services into one, Sunday morning, Sunday night because many travel in got ways to go back home. But nevertheless, we're here today to receive of the word of God. And uh I'm still in my teaching mode because there are some things that I want to establish the church in. And um of course when we do this it it it opens the way for the evangelistic ministries which I have and others have to come behind here and you know to to see the Holy Spirit come in in a great way and uh bring a harvest to the seeds that were planted. So um you know we spoke last week of Leodysia the most deceiving age and we read from from Matthew 24:24 for there shall be false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect. And of course, brother Brandham told us in in the message, I believe it was, you must be born again, that false prophets bring or give forth false births. So, it's very important then to understand in this day that is so deceiving what really the new birth is. Now, and and of course, one of the causes of the great deception in the end time is because of the lost meaning of the new birth and the and that meaning the true meaning of that was lost down to the dark ages and has been restored in stages. Now, this is why there's going to be a huge number. The Bible describes them in Revelation chapter 7 that there's going to be a huge number. He called it a multitude without number. an innumerable multitude who will be saved this side of the tribulation, but will wash will have washed their robes in the blood of the lamb and will wind up at the great white throne judgment where they will finally be led to living waters &gt;&gt; because they miss receiving the living waters of the Holy Ghost. And so, you know, it was it's with such a great deception and it's not going to be a few deceived, but the Bible said all the world will wonder after the beast in his image. And so there will be those um that that are redeemed in and Joel chapter 2 speaks of it of the remnant that the Lord thy God shall call that in in Mount Zion which is the bride in the remnant which thou the Lord thy shall God shall call and of course in Israel. So we know then there are three places where there is going to be salvation in this day. And and when I say that there will be a bride who will go on a rapture. There will be a church who will go through tribulation wind up there at the white throne judgment judged according to the deeds done in their bodies. And then there will be the 144,000, the Jews, the remnant, the leftovers of the Jews that will be redeemed and sealed by the Holy Spirit. And they will be in the millennium together with the bride as we rule and reign with Christ during the thousand years. And and it is because though of the deception that we have mass numbers that will actually miss the rapture and will go through the tribulation and will wind up at the white throne judgment judged according to the deeds done in their bodies or what they've done with with with Christ. And and so now as we look at this, I want to think of this because the original meaning of the new birth, to be born of the water and the spirit, verse five up here, was lost in the dark ages. As light began to break forth into reformation, restoration came in portions of justification, sanctification, gifts of the spirit. Yet none of it was the fullness of Pentecost as in Acts two where the believer was indwelt with Christ himself. Now, and the and the source of confusion today is is um here here's where it multiplies in our age that there are multitudes justified and sanctified and have indeed received works of the spirit. Others are even anointed, baptized with the spirit upon their flesh, even perform miracles, prophesying, demonstrating signs and wonders, yet their lives remain unchanged. They live in sin, still unconverted and still unsealed. and and the spirit may touch them and they may even have various degrees of sanctification, you know, uh and and God might even use them or anoint them, but they still lack the token, the literal life of Christ dwelling within them. Now at originally at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit fell and the church was alive with unity and simplicity and and dynamic power. And the believers, they shared all things in common. And the the apostles went from house to house breaking bread. And the spirit moved mightily among them. But it wasn't long Satan come along and quickly sewed murmuring in the church, you know, and and there was division among them. And there was Pharisees which believe people that were still hanging on to their old denominational uh uh Phariseic ways and and the law and not a and not walking in the spirit and and soon it was the slaves and the poor as we have been through and brother Bradam talks about this in the second seal. You can go read that, listen to it. It's great. Uh where he describes this that the slaves and the poor, those that were first received the spirit, they went out testifying everywhere. And and they testified even to their masters who saw a change in their life. And and when they the dignitaries, the military leaders, the wealthy began to take notice of all of these great miracles and and and they saw even the changed lives of their of these these poor and even some of the them were slaves. Well, they too embraced Christianity. Yet they could not humble themselves to worship in a dimly lit room with clapping of hands and speaking in other tongues and appearing like drunk men as they did in Acts chapter 2. And so you know what they did? They sought to dress it up. And they reasoned, if we're going to win the world, we must refine this movement. And this reasoning birthed the deeds of the nickelatans uh to to conquer the leoty to build a separate priesthood to model the church after pagan systems &gt;&gt; and or or even even the the Old Testament system of the law and its priesthood and its temples and the glory of all of that and and and they would try to model it toward a separate priesthood. Now, so as we as we look at this, I wanted just to see that there was a desire to dress it up. You see, from from the earliest days, there's been a human tendency to dress up God's plan, to make it more refined and and to make it more respectable, to make it more acceptable to the world. But every time the church tries to adorn the gospel with human wisdom, it always ends up watering it down. &gt;&gt; And so what what began as a fire then becomes form. And what began as an experience, it become a ritual run by man. And then you know the second or third generation are no longer sons of God. They're grandchildren of the movement. And and so you know this this um Paul warned of this drift, you know, when he said, "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit and traditions of man after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ." So he warned them of that. And of course Jesus rebuked Ephesus for allowing these deeds to come to creep in. And he said, "But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicicoatans which I also hate." Now they hated it. They didn't like it. But they allowed it to slowly creep in. Why? Because the spirit of nickelanism despises the humility of God's way. And true Christianity looks foolish to the carnal mind, shouting, weeping, speaking in tongues, staggering under the spirit. You know, but what the world mocks as weakness, God calls his wisdom and power. &gt;&gt; So you see what man calls wisdom, God calls foolishness. And what the world says is foolish, God said that's where my wisdom is. So soon the nickel leotans took away the Pentecostal experience and replace it with something that was imparted by the priest and bishops. So now as we look at this that we know that there was then a shift toward priesthood power as the centuries passed the church institutionalized the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And by the second to through the fourth century, the outpouring of the spirit was no longer expected as a spontaneous experience. It was tied to the sacrament of confirmation and only bishops later priests could administer. Now confirmation is where they lay hands on you and say words over you and that's the Holy Ghost. So the Holy Ghost then became the in the power of the priesthood. The church held the power to remit sin &gt;&gt; or or to retain sin. So now again, you know, thus instead of the spirit falling on all flesh, as Joel 2:28 fulfilled in Acts 2, the the church claimed that only the the clergy had authority to impart the spirit and this centralized spiritual power into the hands of a holy priesthood creating a divide between the clergy and the leoty. And this is exactly what Jesus condemned the deeds of the nic as the deeds of the nicicoatans. As you know, nicl mean needs to conquer. Leotans means the leoty and a system where the leoty could no longer have free access to the spirit but had to receive him through the a control of an elevated class of men. So you see the church would impart salvation uh through baptism. When you were sprinkled as a baby, you were automatically now born again. And then so that it it born again now takes on a new meaning. It's no longer what happened in Acts two. It now becomes something controlled by priests and bishops &gt;&gt; who administer and give it to who they want to holding the power to hold it from those they don't want to have it. &gt;&gt; So unless you belong to them, you can't have the Holy Ghost. So by shifting the focus from a direct outpouring of the Holy Spirit to a ritual controlled by priests, the church effectively took Pentecost out of the people's hands and made the spirit subject to institutional control and substituted then. Well, I want you to watch this word because we're going to key on it. substitute substituted sacramental ceremony for a genuine new birth. &gt;&gt; Now, so in short, what happened was the Catholic confirmation shifted the impart impartation of the spirit from the upper room experience into the hands of a of of a hierarchial um priesthood. And this institutional control fulfilled the prophecy of the nickelans conquering the ley removing the freedom of the spirits I porn that marked the original church. So by the second age of Smyrna the root of bitterness had defiled many. Now Smyrna the word smrna for the second church age it means bitterness and it comes from the word myrr. And so we see the Ephesian age had already began to drift. They had aimed at the high calling and relaxed. They were already allowing Nikicoat and his men even though there was an element of believers that hated it. Now watch. I want you to see this that by Smyrna the root of bitterness was already beginning to spring up and began to defile many and it would wound up defiling the whole church. Why? Because the majority wanted to push the Holy Spirit, its leadership in the church and replace it with the rule of man. And they long for a priesthood. I want you to listen. They wanted, remember brother Brandham always talking about how Israel wanted a king be like all the other nations. Well, this was the same thing even with Moses. You know, brother Brandham said grace had brought them out. Grace had given them a prophet. Grace had but they wanted a law, right? So they asked for a law, for a priesthood to mediate between them and God. And God allowed them to have it just like he allowed them to have a king. Now, I want you to watch this because they long for a priesthood like Israel of old rejecting the the spirit's freedom and and the pagan religion and and and their temples. They all had holy priests, beautiful temples, sacred rituals. Oh, all the pomp, the parade. Oh, the things the fine dress uh the the the vast richness and and and so they could it just became more platable to them. They they could easily accept Christianity when it was mixed with pagan ways. And thus began the Nicoladan spirit. Nikode means to conquer the ley and they wanted a ruling clergy and and it soon produced bitterness that brought the church onto bondage. Now brother Brandham taught this in the Smyrnian church age where he said now this now sma means bitterness and it comes from my the first church age had lost their first love. the Ephesian church. And this church had begun to have a root of bitterness coming up in them because that this church, the main church, the big part, the majority of them always was hammering against the Holy Ghost ruling in the church. And they wanted to rule themselves. And they wanted to set up a priesthood. They wanted to act like Old Testament people did. They wanted priests. So, you know, it it didn't look good, you know, meeting in a little dimly lit place and caves and and and things like that. They they wanted majestic temples. They wanted pomp and parade and and and and dignitaries and important men and trained men. So you see it moved away from the spirit leadership. Listen, brother Brandham said, "This church had began to spring up a rooe of bitterness. It was bitter against those who wanted to continue on with the Holy Ghost. The love had faded away. They were beginning to swap it for creeds and denominations, getting away from the Holy Ghost leadership." Think of that. That's why the bitterness was in them. And now the bitterness started creeping in the second church a little more and it creeped right in because they were making a better church. They thought they were right there. They had something right here. They had something dignified. The great Roman people could come in. Why? They had a pope. They had great men and cardinals and so forth. And they dress fine. And they got away from all the noise and everything they had very quiet showed they were dying. Hello. Uh-huh. When you take the shout of the Holy Ghost, the shout of the king out of the church and the praise of God and the worship from the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're It shows you're dying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is a dead church. Amen. They were dying. So they got dignified and they made a better body. And the first thing you know, first thing up here, they had the whole thing in a big ecclesiastical denomination. The Roman Catholic, which means universal church, the Roman Catholic Church in the dark ages. And then they had dignitaries and they had class. So I want you to know they had they traded the moving of the spirit. They've prayed in it for oh more church order, dignity, away from all the noise, away from the Holy Spirit moving, making a better church dignified now. Oh, it was much prettier than when they used to stand on the street and and had to walk in sheep skins as goat skins and destitute and saw to sunder and laughed at made fun of as Paul said in Hebrews 11th chapter. Why this great big fine road church with underskirts on of all this stuff they wear like that sure look dignified father, reverend, doctor, father so and so. Oh, they could put on some real dog there. But you see, it was a hybrid thing. Hybrid. It didn't have any life in it. And they cannot go back no more. That's the reason they never rise. The Lutheran revival never did rise up. The Wesley revival never did rise again. The Nazarene revival never did rise again. Neither will the Pentecostal revival rise up again. Why? Because you killed it. You hybrid with the world with nicolate and idea, not let the Holy Ghost have its way. That's right. You hybrid the church and it can't breed itself back again. When you breed back, you get more Methodist, Baptist, breed Baptist back, get more Baptist, Catholic, breed back, gets more Catholic, same thing. You're selling off the ear. But let me tell you something. When the Holy Ghost comes back, it brings a new birth and new life. Conversion, baptism of the spirit brings the church back to itself again. puts life back in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see they they never rise again and and as he says these early bishops thought they were above the world. They told the people they could forgive sins upon confession of sins. You know they that never was the truth. They began to baptize infants in the second century. They actual pra they actually practice regenerational baptism. No wonder people are mixed up today. Well, what does that means? That means that the water changed you. Sprinkling holy water certainly on a baby made it born again. On a new convert, apostro sprinkle holy water that made it born again. You see they were if he said no wonder the people are mixed up today if they were so mixed up then look just the second century just the second century away from the upper room so close to Pentecost now they are in a most desperate condition being about 2,000 years away from the original truth. Oh church of God, there's only one hope. Get back to the word and stay with it. &gt;&gt; So he says in verse 14 of Revelation 2, thou hast them that hold the doctrine of Balum, who taught Bailac to cast the stumbling block before the children of of Israel to eat things sacrificed to idols. And so you can't have a nickelan setup in the church and not not have other doctrine come in too. Now let me back up for a minute. I I skipped something. Thou hast those that hold the doctrine of Balum who taught Bailac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication. Now you see later on she's identified as the great Why? &gt;&gt; These fornications &gt;&gt; her daughters are corrupted because they learn mama's ways. &gt;&gt; And so why? Because of teaching them to commit fornication, spiritual fornication, &gt;&gt; adultery on God's word. So you see now you can't have a nickelan setup in the church and not have this other doctrine the doctrine of balum come into if you take away from the word and the movement of the spirit as a means of worship they that worship me must worship me in spirit and truth then you have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute what's this word a substitute and substitution spells &gt;&gt; bamism Now, so now we we find that there comes a let's see something here. All right. So, right there then we have then the rise of a of a substitute of a substitute um um of a substitute religion. now and the the nickelan age it it it wanted something different and they substituted the direct outpouring of the spirit with a ritual. Follow my thinking now. priest with Christian which means put Christ in &gt;&gt; right Christian &gt;&gt; infants and proelites claiming them to impart the new birth &gt;&gt; they so that's what born again means just to be born in the church &gt;&gt; be sprinkled by the priest bishops laid hands on to confer the Holy Ghost priest administered the eukarist that's the communion claiming they were imparting Christ himself self and they returned the salvation to a priesthood just under the Old Testament. And and so you see in the Old Testament the the blood of animals we remember now it provided a substitute. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was not the real thing. It was a cover until the real true lamb came. &gt;&gt; This is why John the Baptist message was so so pertinent. He said, "Look, the lamb of God." Oh, we already had the lamb. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that lamb that he had was a substitute. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came, he was the real lamb &gt;&gt; that the others were substituting for. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Understand? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so again, when Jesus came as the lamb of God that take away with the sin of the world, take away the sin of the world. No longer was the substitute accepted. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, his blood was the fullness and the only cure for sin. Now, this is why multitudes go through the tribulation, multitudes wind up at the white throne judgment. Even though they had washed their robes in the blood of the lamb and made them white, they went through and they went through acts of washing, of purification, of sanctification. And they had they were they were had certain sanctified conditions, but think of this, they didn't have anything to get him in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Now, when Jesus came, let me explain this. He was not a shadow. He was not a portion of truth. &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh. In him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When his blood was shed at Calvary, his very life was released and returned to the church as the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; the fullness of God to dwell in his people. And we're in the hour, I want you to get this. This is key. We are in the hour where the fullness of the new birth has been restored. Yes. &gt;&gt; And it is mandatory &gt;&gt; for the rapture &gt;&gt; to have the the the the full birth in its fullness. &gt;&gt; The sealing of the spirit and its fullness corresponds with the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Catch that. Down to the church ages, believers would receive a measure of the revealed word. And with that measure came a measure of the spirit &gt;&gt; to quicken it. But the full sealing, the complete new birth could not return until the full word was restored in this last day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so again, as we as we look at here, um the Bible said, "In whom you've also trusted that after watch now, after you have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after you believe, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise." So get the get this real clear. The Holy Spirit comes after you trust, after you've heard the word, &gt;&gt; after you a after you've heard the gospel of your salvation and after you believe you are sealed. &gt;&gt; It doesn't come when you believe. &gt;&gt; It comes after you believe. &gt;&gt; This is consistent throughout the scripture. The spirit seals the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Did you see that? In whom also you have believed, you receive the word of truth, the gospel of salvation. In whom you have also after you believe, you were sealed. So what? I want you to get this. The spirit seals the revealed word. As the word increases, the spirit's manifestation increases &gt;&gt; until at last the whole word has been brought back and the bride is sealed in its fullness. &gt;&gt; Now at the opening of the seven seals, brother Brandham told us the full word was born into manifestation. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said, so so again at the opening of the seals, Revelation 10, the mysteries hidden from the ages was unveiled and the whole word was born into manifestation again, vindicated by the spirit of God, operating at the same strength and doing the same thing it did in Jesus earthly ministry, making Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. That means the bride is not living on partial light. Amen. &gt;&gt; But on the whole revealed word &gt;&gt; and therefore the fullness of the spirit, fullness of the spirit comes to seal her. So as he said in whom you have trusted after you've heard the word of thy salvation, the gospel of your salvation in whom after you believe you were sealed. So notice the it is when the gospel is restored the seal comes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there was again portions of the spirit &gt;&gt; given down to the ages &gt;&gt; according to the portion of the word that was received. &gt;&gt; But now in this day the full word has been born into manifestation and with it comes the seal of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we need. The seal of the spirit that seals you to the day of redemption. So now this is a pattern in every age that Luther's age the revealed word of justification those who received it were quickened by the spirit to that measure. &gt;&gt; It only quickened them to that measure. &gt;&gt; All right. Wesley age the revealed word of sanctification the spirit empowered holiness and deeper concentr consecration. Watch now the same thing. It quickened them to that measure. &gt;&gt; In the Pentecostal age, we're talking about Isuza Street. &gt;&gt; The revealed word of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with gifts. The spirit gave power and manifestation. Watch. It empowered them &gt;&gt; with a with a deeper a deeper experience even. But now this age, the full revealed word is restored in its fullness, bringing the token, the sealing spirit, the literal life of Christ indwelling the bride. &gt;&gt; That's where we are &gt;&gt; now. So each age, each age's new birth corresponds with the measure of the revealed word for that age. Yes. &gt;&gt; And with each unveiling comes a greater manifestations of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Now because Jesus said the spirit is the word. He said the words I speak to you, they are spirit and they are life. And the Holy Ghost quickens the word. Whatever manifestation of the word that God says to your age, I want you to get it. That is Jesus Christ to your age. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I don't want you to miss that point. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost quickens the word. And whatever manifestation of the word God sends to your age, that's Jesus Christ to your age. &gt;&gt; Well, I've received Jesus. Okay. But have you received the Jesus for this age? Amen. &gt;&gt; The fullness that he's pouring out &gt;&gt; or are you rejecting it and only wanting a portion? &gt;&gt; Well, you only letting go so far. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, receiving the revealed word of your time is re is receiving Christ in himself. And let me say rejecting it is rejecting him. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, in this last days, friends, the full word has returned. &gt;&gt; That's what Malachi 4 was to do. &gt;&gt; And with it came the fullness of the spirit, no longer portions, no longer shadows. The bride of Christ now stands sealed with the token, not a partial birth, but the complete birth of the spirit. &gt;&gt; The same spirit, let me get this to you. The same spirit that walked in Jesus, &gt;&gt; that walks in his body, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The same life that conquered death will then raise up the bride and mouth. &gt;&gt; So Luther had the word for his day. How many agrees with that? &gt;&gt; He had the spirit for his day. &gt;&gt; You don't know Wesley had a greater portion of the word for his day and with it a greater portion of the spirit. And assuz of Pentecost had the word for its day and the spirit for in its day. But this bride, she has the full word. And with the full word comes the full spirit. Not a measure but the fullness of God indwelling his people, sealing them for rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fullness of the word brings the fullness of the birth. has the complete revelation of the word has been restored in this age also too comes with it the fullness of the new birth &gt;&gt; the pattern of the natural birth now we're going to find will will actually mirror the spiritual birth so let's look at this justification is like is like conception the seed of the word is planted the believer's sins are forgiven Sanctification is like gueststation, &gt;&gt; growth, development of life implanted, &gt;&gt; the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and I'm not talking about an anointing here, &gt;&gt; a spirit that comes and goes, &gt;&gt; but I'm talking about the indwelling is like the birth itself when the breath of life enters and the new creation comes forth. So you got you got these stages. You can't say, "Well, a baby's born and he's still in guestation." You can't say, "Well, baby's born and he's already he's just conceived." He's not born to win. The spirit of life enters into it. &gt;&gt; And the baptism of the Holy Ghost is like the birth itself is when the breath of life enters and the new creation comes forth. So at the beginning of the Pentecostal revival, I want to just get it. The spirit hovered near. &gt;&gt; It was like the breath ready to enter the body. &gt;&gt; You ever hear brother Bradom talking about question answer 64 and he said when a baby's born, the mother gets real sweet. She could be as mean as whatever, but there's a sweet spirit. He said, "What is that little angel spirit about ready to come into that baby when it's born?" Well, that was Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that was Isuza Street. It was like the breath ready to enter the body. But only when the Holy Ghost himself breathes into a soul does that soul become a living spiritfilled child of God. &gt;&gt; Now, so the breath of life equals the complete birth. This is why Jesus said and he told Nicodemus except a man be born of the water and the spirit. Did you how many noticed that when we were reading? &gt;&gt; This is Jesus' first doctrine. &gt;&gt; And this is the first thing that come under attack &gt;&gt; was how to be born again. &gt;&gt; Because if you can keep children from coming to birth, &gt;&gt; the church is dead. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So that's why Jesus told Nicodemus, "Except a man be born of the water and the spirit." You see, now conception and growth is vital, but the birth is not complete until the spirit's own life enters in. &gt;&gt; And when that happens, the believer does not merely have a doctrine of Christ. &gt;&gt; He has Christ himself living on the inside of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory. Now Jesus Christ the full word he released his full life and that life returned returns now not as a portion but as the Holy Ghost breathe into the believer producing the complete new birth. Now conception and growth lead to life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But birth brings the child into manifestation. &gt;&gt; That's right. So with the church justification and sanctification prepares the vessel. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would call it in statue of perfect man building a tabernacle &gt;&gt; for the living God to dwell in. &gt;&gt; So you see it prepares the vessel but only the Holy Ghost the breath of life can bring a believer in the full sunship. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So justification is just a conception. You see sanctification grows it but only the Holy Ghost can bring forth bringeth forth alive. So as the spirit of God you know was breathed into Adam and he became a living soul. So Christ breathes into the bride. She becomes a full expression of his word. Not a partial birth &gt;&gt; but the full birth of the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; And on Pentecost, he came as a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; He separated himself. &gt;&gt; He imparted a tongue of fire to every believer. And the church, it was born not by ritual. &gt;&gt; It was born by fire. &gt;&gt; The Bible said of his own will be daddy us with the word of truth. And that with that truth came an experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's just look just for a moment how that the church fell back into partial truth when the nickel spirit conquered the church drifted back to law and ritual and partial light. &gt;&gt; Now and there became a substitute &gt;&gt; priesthood. What's the words again? Substitute and they substitute birth. Now this nickelan age substituted the direct outpouring of the spirit with ritual. Priests, Christian infants and procelites claiming to impart the new birth by baptism sprinkling. Bishops laid their hands on them to confer the Holy Ghost. Priests administered the communion, the Eucharist as though they were imparting Christ himself. What happened? This returns salvation to a priesthood &gt;&gt; just as just as under the Old Testament, but it was only a partial word, a shadow of substitute. So now in the in in the medieval um system, the Eucharist was taught as the actual body and blood of the Lord. They they believed by taking this bread and wine and saying their words over it, making their prayers and sprinkling their waters. They actually turned that back to Jesus on flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; And only a consecrated priest had the power to consecrate the wine and the bread and and then they would lift it up and distribute it to the faithful. And this effectively turned communion into priest controlled pipeline of grace as though Christ himself could only be given through a through the hand of the clergy. And this mirrors the old covenant where priests handled the sacred offerings, sprinkled the blood, &gt;&gt; presented the sacrifices on the behalf of the people. You see, this practice moves salvation out of direct faith in Christ and back into the hands of a human priesthood. Instead of believers directly receiving the Holy Ghost by the spirit or Christ by the spirit, the the priest then was seen as the mediator. So in the Old Testament only the high priest could enter the holiest of holies once a year &gt;&gt; with the blood. The pre the people could not approach. &gt;&gt; They stayed in the outer courts and they could not come near. The priesthood stood between God and the people and they dispended they dispense grace through rituals. So under the Catholic sacramentalism, the priest became the new high priest figure. &gt;&gt; He handled the body and the blood. He heard confessions. He imparted absolution which means freedom from guilt and he salv administered salvation through through a ritual. But let me tell you something friends. The new covenant, when the gospel is restored, the new covenant turns this system upside down. &gt;&gt; When Jesus died, the veil of the temple was rent and twain. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. What did it do? It signified that access to God was open for all. Everybody, anybody can come in &gt;&gt; and that Christ himself is our only mediator &gt;&gt; because the Bible said there is one God and what mediator between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; and now through Christ's blood. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; Through Christ's blood, every believer you this morning have direct access &gt;&gt; to the throne of grace &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus. The Bible said you have therefore boldness to enter into the holiest of holies by the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. That you as lively stones are built up as a spiritual house. You see u to offered spiritual sacrifices and you're a holy priesthood &gt;&gt; and and the Bible said you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood. And under the new covenant, the whole church is the priesthood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No believers has to stand at a distance. &gt;&gt; All are invited &gt;&gt; to come in the holiest of holies. Your prayers mean as much to God as any preachers's prayer. &gt;&gt; You have access to the throne. You don't have to go through a preacher to get it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have access to the Holy Ghost. You don't have to go through a preacher to get it. You have a right to your own acts two experience. You don't have to have a preacher to impart it to you. &gt;&gt; You don't have to belong to his church. You don't have to belong to his organization. You don't have to belong to to him at all. You have to belong to Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, why does this matter? You see, to treat the communion, salvation, remittance of sin as a priest control impartation of Christ reverses the new covenant pattern. It places the the believer back under a human mediator &gt;&gt; and so the veil is still up. Let me tell you friends, the veil the veil has been ripped. &gt;&gt; The veil that kept you out. &gt;&gt; Come on. The message, the gospel return rips the veil. &gt;&gt; That's what this message did for us. It ripped the veil of traditions. &gt;&gt; And it made an access where anybody &gt;&gt; any one of you &gt;&gt; could receive the same Acts two experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the true covenant of the gospel is not a sacrament dispensed but the person of Christ that is received by faith and sealed by the spirit and living inside the believer. Excuse me. So through the ages, God has sent portions of truth. &gt;&gt; Luther restored justification by faith. Yet salvation soon became tied to church creeds and rituals. Wesley pressed deeper with sanctification, but it still moved under church forms and priestly controls. Pentecost restored the baptism of the Holy Spirit as an anointing with gifts. But yet it became a substitute when salvation was reduced to a manifestation like tongues often taught by men instead of sovereignly given by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Think of that. These were glorious restorations, &gt;&gt; but they were all partial. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they worked for their time just as animal blood worked until the true lamb came. &gt;&gt; But substitutes cannot cure sin. They only cover it. &gt;&gt; You see, it'll treat sin, but it will not Are you with me? It will not cure sin. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, the gospel we have today that's been restored by the message of Malachi 4 is not a a treatment for sin. It is a sin cure. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the problem with denominationalism. They are treatment centers for sin. &gt;&gt; Try this. Maybe you'll get a little better. Well, try that. Here's a little psychology. Or, you know, here, practice this, you know, for your temper. You know, not a string so many times, you know, before you explode. &gt;&gt; All kinds of little tricks and gimmicks and whatever else, &gt;&gt; but no cures. &gt;&gt; But you see, we are in the day of the restoration of the token. Today God has restored the original gospel in his fullness. And this is not justification by confession. Is not sanctification reduced to social reform. Nor is it Pentecostal gifts as evidence. It is the indwelling of the spirit himself. &gt;&gt; Christ incarnating his bride just as he did in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; And Paul declared Christ in you the hope of glory. You see, this is the token, the very life of Christ applied to the believer, not as a ritual, not as a substitute, but the supreme evidence that the blood has been accepted. &gt;&gt; It is the token. &gt;&gt; It's what's needed for the rapture. &gt;&gt; So, we'll just look at the contrast for a minute. The Old Testament law gave his shadow a substitute lamb. Jesus was a true lamb. He brought a new birth by the life of the blood returning at Pentecost. The dark ages returned to ritual and priesthood. The reformation gave portions of truth as substitutes. Remember, just like the substitute lamb, it would be a lamb. It would be blood, &gt;&gt; but it was only to work until what it was speaking of came. Amen. &gt;&gt; But at the evening time, it restores the fullness of the word and the spirit together. The fullness is here again because why? He says at the evening time it shall be light. You see now, no more bitterness, no more partial covering, no more substitute. Only a bride filled with the Holy Ghost and standing in the light of the revealed word. You see, we don't need substitutes. &gt;&gt; It needs the real. But what happened right after in Acts chapter 15? What did they do? They tried to get them to go back to substitutes again &gt;&gt; were Pharisees who believed insisted that they be circumcised as the law of Moses said. And that was only a substitute to work until the real circum circumcision came which was circumcised the heart. And he that has the circumcision of the heart needs not have the flesh to be circumcised. the truth. &gt;&gt; No more than what we need to go get a lamb and offer it on an altar and take that woolly lamb and let it bleed and die and what it's it's in vain. &gt;&gt; It won't save you. &gt;&gt; Only the true lamb will save. &gt;&gt; Now this age does not need substitute. We need the real. &gt;&gt; It does not need ritual. It needs fire. &gt;&gt; It doesn't need a priesthood that imparts a ritual. It needs Christ in the believer. &gt;&gt; The token applied. &gt;&gt; His life is an evidence in your life. &gt;&gt; Now, so soon what we saw was substitutes that were given to for a genuine experience. So, brother Brandon would talk about this. He said, "Let's go down. When I was ordained in the Baptist church, let's take us Baptist. The Methodists, what did we do? If thou wil confess Jesus Christ is the son of God, you are saved. &gt;&gt; The devil believes he he's the son of God and trembles at it and probably believes it more than a lot of church member does. The believer, the devil believes the same thing and trembles because he knows he's doing. &gt;&gt; That's right. So they watch now what they did. They offer a substitute of confession. &gt;&gt; Joining a church, becoming a member, saying I believe. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We're going to deal with this. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon says why we're not a denomination. So your creeds and denomination has barred God away like that. We believe this and we believe the days of miracles have passed. It's a false prophet that says that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's a false prophet that tells you that you can shake hands and receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's a false prophet that tells you you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe. &gt;&gt; Now they may even say, "Well, when you believe the message, you got it." That's a false prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. It isn't about it. It is certainly you have to believe. You must believe. But I'm telling you, there is a deception in this last day &gt;&gt; of easy belieism. &gt;&gt; And it is not the bride's message. It is Solver's message. &gt;&gt; It will save Lot out of Sodom, &gt;&gt; but it will not produce the body change for Abraham and Sarah. &gt;&gt; Come on. You see the deception of easy belieism. You see Billy Graham blinded the eyes and deceived millions with this. And today I want I it's sad to say but we're facing a form of easy belieism of Baptist approach &gt;&gt; that has crept into the very ranks of the message &gt;&gt; and it says the new birth is nothing more than believing the word just just believe receive the message and by believing it you have the Holy Ghost. They teach that the spirit comes quietly without knowing it and without feeling, without sensation. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham never taught that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, well, it's a restored truth, mystery truth. Brother Tim, he told us that in services at the time. He did not. &gt;&gt; That is not what he said. He said we have today the Holy Ghost without sensation &gt;&gt; but the person of Christ dwelling within you &gt;&gt; doing the same works that he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in the seals sensations it's not it but yet it comes with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to talk about this for a moment because this is a lie that has been recycled and parited from a backsliden message rejector who once claimed we received the Holy Ghost like Mary received it. And that's without sensation. Well, let's let's look at that. When Mary conceived Christ, she was indeed overshadowed by the Holy Spirit. But that was not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But it was the miracle of conception. And and of course it came without sexual sensation. It was a virgin birth. &gt;&gt; Right? But when Mary received the Holy Ghost for herself, &gt;&gt; it was on the day of Pentecost and she was among the 120 and she received it the same way they did with a rushing mighty wind with tongues of fire with tongues of speech and with such power that men thought they were drunk. &gt;&gt; And to say she received it without sensation is a twisting of the truth. The overshadowing for conception is not the same as the indwelling for the new birth. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham said in the message, why you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you'll believe in God's power, you'll believe every word God says. You'll punctuate it with an amen to everything he talks to you. And then people don't sit there and say, "Well, Simon, I suppose I I guess it's all right, brother." When they got that, they were all filled with the Holy Ghost began to stagger like drunk men come and remember you Catholic person. The blessed virgin Mary was right there. And if God wouldn't let her come to heaven without she took the same prescription. How are you going to get there anything less? Some of you cold starch Pentecost or you cold starchy Baptist, you cold starchy Methodist. How are you going to get there? Anything less than that when even the mother of Jesus Christ had to go up there and get the same thing and stagger and I got you drunk. If that ain't the Bible, I ask any professor to come disprove it. That every time in the Bible they ever got the Holy Ghost, they acted exactly the same way they did there. that a prescription will take the same effect every time. &gt;&gt; Now, so again, the Holy Ghost is not a sensation. &gt;&gt; Let's get that proved down. It is not a feeling. &gt;&gt; It's not a chill. &gt;&gt; It's not a jump. It's not a shout. It's not goosebumps. It's not excitement. But when it comes, he brings a definite experience that you know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, you want to talk about revelation for the last day. This is going to be the primary revelation &gt;&gt; that you know. &gt;&gt; Now, let's just look at this for a moment. Jesus Jesus said you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come on you. So now when the Holy Ghost comes we have overcoming power &gt;&gt; overcoming life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We have power in the church because of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And Paul said the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of God. &gt;&gt; Does that sound like something you don't know? Uh the spirit bears witness &gt;&gt; that you're children of God. &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Seeing you have purified your soul in obeying the truth through the spirit, it not only it not only that bears witness and gives power, but it purifies the soul." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, here's key. At that day, you shall know that I'm in the Father and I am you and you and me. So you see he said you will know. &gt;&gt; He did not say you will guess it. &gt;&gt; He said at that day you will know that I'm in the father and I and you and you and ye in me and I in you. Now that is not uncertainty. That's revelation. When the Holy Ghost comes, he brings a knowledge that Christ himself has taken his place in you. Now, this scripture alone destroys the lie of an unconscious receiving of the spirit. &gt;&gt; If you if you can have the Holy Ghost and not know it, then Jesus words would fail. But his words cannot fail. He said, "You shall know." That's right. &gt;&gt; And the spirit's witness is not a passing emotion. It's the very certainty of God's indwelling. &gt;&gt; So hereby, he says, we know, look at this last verse, we know. Is everybody reading with me? We know that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit. Yes. &gt;&gt; So you see it is something that we know. &gt;&gt; This is where he says ye shall know that I'm in the father and you in me and I in you. You see when so he says you will know that I am in my father. Let me break this down. This is teaching. This is Sunday school. When scripture calls God the father, it doesn't picture this fleshly father that's separate from the spirit. &gt;&gt; It reveals the eternal spirit, the father manifesting himself in the son and poured out as the holy ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the Holy Ghost brings us into union with the father through the son because you see you cannot come to the father except through the son. &gt;&gt; That's the only approach to the spirit God is through the man Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; who where the spirit became flesh and dwelt among us. So Christ in the father, the eternal deity, he said, "Believest not that I am in the father and the father in me." Watch now he talks about a complete union. I am in the father and the father in me. The words I speak, I speak not of myself, but the father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the father and the father in me. So now here again you see Christ in the father that's the eternal deity the spirit of God working through the flesh of his son &gt;&gt; using the body the humanity of Christ in you the indwelling spirit you and Christ your life hidden in Christ that is the restored mystery of the new birth that Paul proclaimed Christ and you the hope of glory Now, you know, I I want to go on here just for a moment. Let's talk about the spirit of your father because I want you to understand the Holy Ghost is the spirit of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are not three persons in the Godhead. &gt;&gt; There's one person. &gt;&gt; And God was manifested in Christ. &gt;&gt; He was revealed in Christ. So I want you to see for it is not Matthew 10:20. For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you. Watch now. The Holy Ghost spirit of the father. For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that same hour what you ought to say. &gt;&gt; What he calls it here the spirit of the father. And then he calls it the Holy Ghost. And he will teach you in the same hour what you should say. The spirit of father speaketh in you. Watch now as we as we look at this. Jesus equates the spirit of your father with empower and presence speaking through his disciples. The father is the spirit. And and he says the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say. So the the Holy Ghost is the spirit of the father is Christ in you is the spirit of God. Watch now. But you are not in the flesh but in the spirit is so that the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the spirit of &gt;&gt; Christ &gt;&gt; who? &gt;&gt; Christ. He's none of his. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, &gt;&gt; it'll also quicken your mortal body. &gt;&gt; So he freely interchanges the spirit of God, spirit of Christ, spirit of him that raised up Jesus. It's the Holy Ghost is all the same. One spirit, &gt;&gt; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God, one father of us all. &gt;&gt; One spirit, &gt;&gt; you can't divide him into three people. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's I'm in the father, the father is in me, and I in you. &gt;&gt; Can I say it this way? The same eternal spirit that was that Uh the father was in me and now he's coming in you. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham teaches us in Christ the mystery and he's and I'm going to catch it a little bit of this because it'll go with the subject. So many people get the wrong conception to convert people to Christianity and to his government is not God's thought at all. &gt;&gt; You say we make converts to Christianity by his governments. That's not it. Well, they're not supposed to drink. They're not supposed to lie. You know, that's often what we do. We tell people what they're not to do. &gt;&gt; Don't do this. Don't do that. You know, we are trying to win them by the government, by the rules. Amen. &gt;&gt; Real Christianity is not keeping rules. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's legislated by preacher or church &gt;&gt; even if it's from the Bible. &gt;&gt; Real Christianity is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Living himself out. &gt;&gt; His life living out in you. &gt;&gt; Now notice God making himself known. Now, we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by government, but by the revelation, the Christ in you as God was in Christ. As God was in Christ, Christ in you. When what God did in Christ, Christ does in you. What signs God did in Christ, Christ does in you. Oh, isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; I like that. Now, watch this. Jesus said at that day that this day &gt;&gt; why? Because we come back to restored gospel again. &gt;&gt; We come out from the law and his priesthood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Out from substitutes, back to the reality again. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we do, we come back to the scripture. &gt;&gt; And that day, that's this day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is the same as that day at Pentecost, &gt;&gt; you will know I'm in the Father, the Father, and me, and I in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At this day, when this revelation is made known, you will know I'm in the Father, the Father, and me, and I, and you, and you and me. And when the revelation is manifest at that day, you shall know that I'm the father one. I'm in the father and the father is in me. That when the revelation comes forth, then it's I and you and you in me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So we have the token the literal life of Christ &gt;&gt; restored back again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not a substitute. &gt;&gt; No. And that's why that was a highlight of brother Brandham's ministry. He said, "My end time ministry is all wrapped up into this one thing &gt;&gt; because it brings us back to the full new birth." You see, not a portion, not a substitute, but the spirit in its fullness bringing back the literal life of Christ into the believer. And of course, this will bring our full glorification, the change of our body. I I want you to catch the scripture because this is the mystery, the mystery of the new birth, the mystery of the token is what Paul is preaching here. &gt;&gt; And he says, and and I want to get it. It's this mystery that has been restored. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Even the mystery that's been hid from the ages. Now we can say the church ages now &gt;&gt; and from generations but is now made manifest to saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you. Don't mention the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; So when the church returns back to the token of the literal life of Christ being back in the believer, not a portion, not a substitute, then that returns us to having the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; What glory? What's that talking about? Well, the hope of glory that the glorious condition of the blessedness into which is appointed and promised that true Christians enter after their savior's return from heaven. So again, Paul reveals the heart of the mystery for the ages. This is the heart of the mystery. This is the climax of brother Brandon's ministry. Every thing pointing to this one thing, &gt;&gt; you must have the token, the literal life of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This mystery which has been hid from the ages and from generation. But now evening like tabernacle has been manifested, revealed, made known again to you in this last day &gt;&gt; where you can have more than a portion &gt;&gt; of the word and a portion of the spirit to go with it. But the fullness of the word and the fullness of its power, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost itself, the person returning to live in the believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that ought to make up every one of you. &gt;&gt; And this is not just a doctrine. It's not a moral influence. It is Christ himself indwelling the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a guarantee &gt;&gt; of the future glory. &gt;&gt; The phrase the hope of glory means more than simply going to heaven. That's right. &gt;&gt; It points to the glorious state of transformation promised to every true believer. The body change at Christ's return. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you gives you hope for the body change. &gt;&gt; Without Christ in you, you have no hope. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For the body change. &gt;&gt; Well, I've got a portion of the spirit is not hope for the change. It'll get you in the tribulation. &gt;&gt; It'll get you in the white throne judgment. &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll be granted life there and be led to fountains of living water. But watch only the token gives you the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Now watch. See what I did? Put it somewhere. There it is. If I'm lost, I'm lost in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Watch now. Who shall change our vile body &gt;&gt; that it may be fashioned like his glorious body? &gt;&gt; What? We're going to be glorified &gt;&gt; with what glory? A body like his. Amen. &gt;&gt; A body that never smoked, never drank, never lied, never cussed, never come on. Can't have a heartache. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is timeless, eternal. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. And when he shall appear, we shall be like him. &gt;&gt; For we shall see him as he is. This future glorification is guaranteed because the earnest the down payment is already &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; So the token is like purchasing a a ticket to go on airplane. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is a guarantee. &gt;&gt; Amen. That I'm going I have a right to get on that plane. &gt;&gt; My purchase is paid. I have a seat reserved. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, DI can leave you behind, but this plane can't leave a one of his behind. &gt;&gt; Because when he comes, he seals you to the day of redemption, which is the day of your body changed. &gt;&gt; There is nothing can happen between you and there that can keep you out of the rapture. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. After you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession. And you are the purchased possession, &gt;&gt; not fully redeemed yet, because your body still needs redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you have a down payment. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that means that your soul is already glorified, but you're about to receive a body that matches your soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And our hope of glorification, the rapture rest on this fact. The token, the literal life of Christ has been restored. Not a substitute, not a ritual, but the person of Christ living in the believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. Not just a jumpish shout or tongue, &gt;&gt; but Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Just as Israel's doorpost bore the blood of the lamb as a token in Egypt, the believer's heart bears the spirit of the lamb as a token. It's the proof the blood has been applied and the judgment will pass over. You're going to escape the tribulation. &gt;&gt; And this is no longer a shadow, friends. It's available. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's the reality now. The very life that will quicken your mortal body at the rapture is already in you. It's already in you. It's working. Sanctification, transformation, and power because Christ lives in you. The glorification of your body is not a wish. It's a certainty. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead now dwells in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it will also at that day quicken or make alive your mortal body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is your hope of glory. &gt;&gt; And friends, it's not just a merely a future promise. It's the present possession of the life that one day will burst forth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Into immortality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. Not Christ with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not Christ's promise to you, but Christ in you. &gt;&gt; That's the hope of glory. The token restored. That's not a ritual. It's not a shadow. It's not not a substitute. It's the very life of Christ indwelling his bride. Guaranteeing her body change when he returns. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't you see? With the fullness of the word comes the fullness of the birth. And with the fullness of the birth comes of the fullness of redemption. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are in the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; We have something about it. The day of redemption is near. We can say now it's here. &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I've been bought with the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have the token. &gt;&gt; It ain't a jump. It ain't a shout. It's the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; It ain't a knowledge. It ain't It ain't knowing mysteries. It is knowing him. and to knowing him is life. &gt;&gt; That's our assurance. It's the very life of Christ indwelling his bride guaranteeing a body change. &gt;&gt; You who have received Christ and receive this message, you are guaranteed a body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can say, "I am the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I am the life." &gt;&gt; You can say, "I am the rapture." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm afraid I'll be left behind. No, I can't be left behind. I am the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because I've already been quickened. So you see the mystery hidden is now revealed and and for centuries the reformers of the churches spoke of it but they couldn't see the fullness. &gt;&gt; They could you see they couldn't see God's own life not only with his people but in his people but now the token has returned &gt;&gt; the literal life of Christ. And when it does it does away with the substitutes. If you listen to the token message, brother Brandon preached in September 63 and he and he and he tells you there he said you know other stages that were examined they were gathering a lamb they were examined in the land and you know there were days that it was kept up and examined which is all process of it but he said today is not that day we are come though it was lamb time in Luther and he says it's lamb time in ly they were keeping up the lamb. They were examining the lamb. He's without blemish. Here's what it ought to do for you. All these things that they were doing, understand. &gt;&gt; But now he said it's not just lamb time anymore. It's token time where the lamb's blood, his life must be in the believer on display. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. not only on the believer but he said on the church displayed. &gt;&gt; So therefore signs, wonders, miracles, healings, deliverance, tongues, interpretation, tongues, prophecy, every gift of the spirit has to be manifested in that bride church &gt;&gt; because why we come back to the token again &gt;&gt; the blood and it must be on display. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this is why Paul can say, "Christ liveth in me." &gt;&gt; Right? Galatians 2:20. Christ liveth in me. &gt;&gt; I thought it was the Holy Ghost. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It is the spirit of Jesus. &gt;&gt; It is the spirit of the father. &gt;&gt; It is the one eternal father. It is immortal life. It is eternal life. &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Ghost. Whatever, whatever you want to say, it is Jehovah Gyra. It is Jehovah and I say it. It is the Lord I that health. It is the It is the Lord. It's him living in his people. &gt;&gt; And to think of it today, you can have him, not just a substitute. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you can have the very person, the literal life of Christ living in you, controlling your nature, causing you to overcome. Because Christ is now living in you, your future glorification is guaranteed. Because Paul ties that directly to the transformation where he said if the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead, if it dwell in you, &gt;&gt; there you go again, is still the spirit of my father dwelling in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it dwells in you, if he that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you, it shall also what? &gt;&gt; Make alive, &gt;&gt; quicken &gt;&gt; your mortal bodies &gt;&gt; by the spirit that dwelleth in you. &gt;&gt; That's our hope of glory. &gt;&gt; It's not just going to heaven someday, but a but a literal body change &gt;&gt; when Christ returns. No more substitutes &gt;&gt; down to the ages. God gave portions of himself, portions of truth, anointings, and they were substitutes until the fullness could be restored. But now the fullness of the word brings the fullness of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And the token has been restored. Not a partial light, not a shadow, you know, it's the token restored. It's the fullness of the spirit with the fullness of the word. So, so because the token is of Christ's literal life, you're no longer hoping in a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're you're not tied to my coattails. &gt;&gt; If I don't go, you're going without me. &gt;&gt; And if I'm going, I can't pull you with me. Every person must have it for themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is Christ literal life a restored believer. And you're no longer hoping in a church, a priest, a substitute or a preacher or a priest or a portion of the spirit. You have the person himself. It dwell in you. &gt;&gt; And the same spirit. Oh hallelujah. The same spirit and not another spirit. The same spirit Jesus had. If it dwells in you, it will also make alive your mortal body &gt;&gt; even now. It'll make it alive. It'll cause you to come subject to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the token restored again means more than gifts. It means more than tongues, more than a feeding, a feeling. I mean it's Christ himself inside the bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not a substitute. &gt;&gt; It's the person. It's not a promise on paper. &gt;&gt; It's not words on a tape. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It's not printed on a book. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not a collection of message paraphernalia. &gt;&gt; It's not pictures &gt;&gt; of a of a of a great man. It's not it. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's It's not at all. It's the spirit himself &gt;&gt; which is more than a picture. Which is more than a tape. which is more than words on a book. &gt;&gt; It is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; It is the earnest of our inheritance. &gt;&gt; So let us be clear. The Holy Ghost is not a silent guest who slips in unnoticed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He is Christ returning to Jacob, his dwelling and his bride. And when he comes, you know it. &gt;&gt; Because the word said you will. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And at that day you shall know, not hope, not wonder, not assume. You shall know. &gt;&gt; For when the Holy Ghost come, I'll tell you what happened. Heaven moves in and hell moves out &gt;&gt; and you are never ever ever the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can testify today? You were there. You know it happened in your life. Hell moved out when heaven moved in. &gt;&gt; Amen. A new king came on the throne. &gt;&gt; You're not subject to sin anymore. You're not slaves to Satan any longer. You're not a part of some denominational system. You don't have a substitute. You have the real. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have a substitute blood that'll get you over in the tribulation. You have the blood of Christ which cleanses you from every sin and does more than cleanse it. He comes to indwell you and fill you with his presence and empower you to live an overcoming life. Let me tell you, every scripture s shows the Holy Ghost is not silent, not unnoticed, not a vague assumption assumption. He's a power. He's a witness. He is a fire. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what. Ever since I received the Holy Ghost, let me tell you something. It's been a fire. &gt;&gt; A fire shut up in my bones. &gt;&gt; Amen. That if I would hold it back or try to be quiet, I have to express it. Why? Because why? The Holy Ghost is on the inside burning. It's a burning fire. &gt;&gt; It's a passion. It's a drive. It's not le oysia &gt;&gt; lukewarm cold indifferent &gt;&gt; far more powerless a powerless religion but it's a religion of power. Let me just see. I need to find a place to stop. In case you're curious, I'm on page 35 of 84. Heaven help us now. Let me just see as I wind this up just for a moment. Brother Brandham and I I'm I'm just going to skip a couple of slides here just for a moment where brother Brandham talks about this. He talks about the nickelan age and he said we take the Methodist form but then he said it brings it down where you know there's substitute you know when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one place one accord and the pastor came down preached the fine sermon said give me the right hand the fellowship we'll put your name on the book so joining the church became the new birth saying whatever the priest preacher told you to say so he put words in your mouth. I believe Jesus Christ to be the son of God and savior of the world. You're saved. It all put it back upon a preacher or a Zuza street. It turned out where they couldn't get everybody to speak in tongues. So they shake a jaw and quiver get them to say a word that they put in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Say Jesus. Jesus. Glory to God. Glory to God. Until you get a confusion of tongues. &gt;&gt; Again, it's imparted by a priesthood. &gt;&gt; So, what caused it? The nickel bringing in a bunch of men to twist up the scriptures and make that denomination that can't let God move in it. And it dies right there. You're dead. You got to name your living. You're dead. Many of them dead and don't know it. Now I want you to watch this. This is the indictment. Brother Brandham would indict a generation for crucifying Christ the second time. &gt;&gt; And in doing this when the church world would turn him down by rejecting the Jesus of their day, &gt;&gt; the word for their day, &gt;&gt; they crucified the effects of the gospel. &gt;&gt; That's right. And when it did, I want you to understand it's like it's like that Israel that day when Jesus hung on the cross and it opened the veil of the temple. What happened there when the veil was written too? It showed there was no God there. &gt;&gt; But he was no longer there. He had listen he had he had ordained that priesthood down to the ages. He had even filled temples with his holy fire &gt;&gt; and there had been moves of God. But now that day at Calvary when Jesus died, suddenly the substitutes would no longer atone &gt;&gt; and the woolly lamb's blood no matter if that's what brother Brandon said in the third seal I think it is. He said, "You'll find out in the thunders." That's when the seals are open. He said, "Well, you'll find out when the in those thunders." He said, "Where they'll come to the altar and scream and cry and get nothing &gt;&gt; because they can come back to the same altars that saved their grandfathers." &gt;&gt; Now, catch this thought. Now, let me break it down to you. Catch this thought. The moment Jesus died, &gt;&gt; all of those substitutes now would be offered in vain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, but Moses told us, Ezekiel did it this way. These others did it. my grandfather, my mother, my daddy &gt;&gt; and they died believing it &gt;&gt; and they were saved. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the day Jesus died, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; The temple veil was ri open. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it showed God ain't there no more. &gt;&gt; Where is he? He's the one you rejected and is hanging on the cross. &gt;&gt; That's right. And from that moment, &gt;&gt; that substitute blood was no longer effective. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm excited. Brother Tim, Israel's going to get the red heer and she's going to It's of no effect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's only one blood. There's only salvation in one name. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost and preached, he said, "You got to be you got to be baptized in this name. &gt;&gt; There's only in this name is their salvation. There's no longer salvation in any other lamb." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All the other lambs are they're cap, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They may be coming sincerely. &gt;&gt; They may be coming with same way their grandfathers did and get nothing. That's right. &gt;&gt; And so does this age come to it when they when a prophet indicted this generation &gt;&gt; for doing what? Rejection Jesus. Oh, they believe in Jesus. Yeah. They believe in Jesus of a portion of the word &gt;&gt; but not the revealed word of the day which is the Jesus for our day. And the and the moment the church turned down the word, you know, God called out a bride, he opened the seals, he broke the veil, he showed he showed the antichrist and the working of Antichrist. And there is no salvation there that'll get you in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach now. &gt;&gt; Because the only place there is hope of glory is when the word has been restored back to Paul's gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now we come to this indictment and brother Brandham's indicting a generation. Now the seals have been open and the word is rejected. Even in in the invisible union when brother Brandham spoke there in shreport he said the the church cannot fulfill the great commission. They cannot finish what Jesus said to do. They cannot, he said, they can't even agree on one word of the Bible hardly, much less all of it. &gt;&gt; And he said, they cannot receive these seven seals that have been revealed and the word that's been opened. Therefore, they cannot finish the great commission. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, so something happened. And let me tell you, when the seals are open, something happened. There was a shift. The veil was opened. What did he reveal? God had left the denominational system &gt;&gt; and was now in the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Now, where is their mercy for a rapture? Only there. &gt;&gt; Now, look down to the tribulations of of the Jews in the 2,000 years. There were people saved even though they did not receive Christ under come coming to God by faith under the Old Testament law of understanding. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Come on. Under the under the fifth seal, there was souls under the altar &gt;&gt; who had never received Jesus Christ but were given white robes &gt;&gt; because of the testimony which they held. &gt;&gt; You see, they had believed in God, but they had failed to see the progression. &gt;&gt; And there will be those in the tribulation and there will wind up the great white throne judgment. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? because they believe for the testimony which they held &gt;&gt; but they didn't go into all the revealed word for the hour because it's only the revealed word the hour that has the hope of glory &gt;&gt; so Peter on the day of Pentecost said you men that dwell in Jerusalem or Judea you hearken to my words these are not drunken if you'll stand still I'll show you what is and he goes ahead and explains to him and when their hearts were pricricked they said what can we do to be saved and what what can we do to receive this we're convinced your word is right he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ who was Jehovah revealed for that age and time &gt;&gt; Jehovah had been revealed in other ages but now he's revealed in fullness &gt;&gt; we're convinced your word's right be baptized at one in the name Jesus Christ remission from sin. You shall receive to give the Holy Ghost. For this is to you and your children, them that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. That's what they got to do. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And today the Roman church, Catholic church, adopted father, son, and the holy ghost to take its place. That instead of that a communion, lick out a tongue and take the wafer and drink the wine and you're one together. The communion instead of being the Holy Ghost called Holy Eucharist and a father, son, holy ghost or trinitarian baptism when it's not even spoke of in the Bible, the name of father, son, and holy ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ. And he said, "When you show that to this onward generation," watch this, this onward generation. As Peter said, "Save yourselves from this onward generation." Unto perverse crooked, wicked generation. That's what it means. Untored. When and when you show it to them, what they do, they make fun of it and say, "Our church don't teach it that way." Then you're guilty. Right? &gt;&gt; You're guilty of crucifixion of Jesus Christ by taking the power of God away from the people. &gt;&gt; You crucify the very word to them and you condemn yourself with your congregation and lead them into a death trap. And friends, just as there going to be millions that will be saved, there will be millions that will be counted as counterfod cannon fodder for the atomic age. &gt;&gt; Think of that. I'm gonna cover this so I don't have to do it. Let me So we come Jesus gave the last supper. He gave both the elements and you wonder what brother Brandham is talking about. He said you know they lick out a tongue take a wafer and the priest drink the wine. Let me just cover that for a moment. At the last supper, Jesus gave both elements to his disciples. Paul taught us to do the same. &gt;&gt; He said, "Drink you all of the cup. &gt;&gt; Eat this. Eat this bread." &gt;&gt; And he not only spoke of the ley then eating the bread, but drinking this cup. Let me go back to that right quick where brother Brandon was talking about this. And he's talking about crucifying, guilty of crucifying. And he said the communion. So why is it that the Catholic priest drinks the wine and only the congregants eat the bread? I don't know, Sister Debbie, you was a Catholic one time, probably took communion. Did you get to take the wine? No. No. Was you a cattle? Uhhuh. Do you ever have the wine? No. Who had the wine? Who? The priest. Now, here's two former Catholics. Thank God they're real Catholics. You know why? Why did the Catholic priest drink the wine and the congregants only get the bread? because concern that the congregants might spill the wine, the precious blood of Christ. So you can't handle the wine. And the council of Constants in 1415, it formerly decreed communion under one kind for the leoty, reserving the cup for the priest. Now in practice what this did it separated the leoty from the visible sign of the blood and it reinforced the image of a special priesthood. And that symbolism said in effect the life is only reserved for the priesthood. It's not for the people. &gt;&gt; Only the preachers can live it. The congregation is not holy. There's a holy priesthood. &gt;&gt; And that symbolizes symbolization or symbolism said the life is reserved for the priesthood. The practice of leoty receiving only the host which is the bread while the priest alone drink from the chalice has historically implied a special class entitled to Christ's blood. But the scripture, it shows every believer shares equally &gt;&gt; in Christ's body and blood. &gt;&gt; So the new covenant does not have a priestly elite dispensing grace, but one mediator &gt;&gt; between God and man, Christ himself who give his life for all people. And at Calvary, the veil was torn. And the life of Christ, his very blood was not poured out just for the clergy class, but for every believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Drinking all of it." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you know what that means? Every one of you &gt;&gt; can get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Every one of you can be filled with the wine of God. Every one of you can have the spirit of God dwelling on the inside of you. It's not reserved &gt;&gt; to a holy priesthood. &gt;&gt; You are that holy priesthood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's not just for priests. It's not just for apostles, not but it's for all his disciples. Every believer has a access to the blood and the body of the Lord. So he says, "Save yourself from this unto generation, &gt;&gt; untoward generation, this perverse, crooked, wicked." You show it to them. What do they do? Make fun of it. Our church don't teach it that way. Then you're guilty of the crucifixion of the Jesus Christ by taking the power of God away from this people. And when you take away from the people the spirit having its way, the spirit moving among the congregation, the shout of the king from in their midst, the worship of the priesthood, &gt;&gt; worshiping in the pew as well as in the pulpit. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; When you take that away from them, you are guilty of crucifying Jesus Christ again &gt;&gt; and put him to an open shape. &gt;&gt; That's where we are. Christ is being crucified once more. Let's stand together. But let me tell you, when he's crucified, when he's rejected, when he's unwanted, when he's hung on the cross, when he's put to open shame, when he's mocked. Haha, look at them dancing in the spirit. Haha, look at them shouting. Haha, look at them. They still believe in speaking in tongues and gifts of the spirit. Haha. When he's mocked and he's scorned and he's spit on &gt;&gt; and he's crucified, it brings the word into full effect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To you, the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a day of the outpouring of his spirit, &gt;&gt; not in portion, not a little bit of it, but all that he is poured out into a bright body. &gt;&gt; It's rapture time. It's the hour of your glorification. &gt;&gt; Oh, let us be glad and rejoice because we no longer have a substitute. We have the word in his fullness. &gt;&gt; Can we praise the Lord together this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
