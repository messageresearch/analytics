[14:20] this man
[14:28] you may have your seats
[14:37] let us bow for a word of prayer
[14:40] our heavenly father
[14:43] we ask lord for your holy spirit
[14:46] to be so present
[14:48] at this place today and
[14:50] permeate
[14:51] this
[14:52] service lord with your presence
[14:55] lord may we
[14:57] today be conscious
[15:00] of the solemn
[15:02] ceremony that we have entered into
[15:05] and regarded with respect and honor
[15:08] and pledged to keep this until
[15:11] that day you call us home
[15:13] we thank you lord for this young couple
[15:15] that is standing here before me today
[15:18] we believe lord that this is a
[15:20] predestined moment
[15:22] lord that they have stepped out of
[15:24] eternity into time
[15:27] and one day we'll go back into eternity
[15:30] we believe lord also if that love is
[15:33] true
[15:34] that it is an eternal love
[15:37] and that one day in the eternities hand
[15:39] in hand together
[15:41] they will enjoy the blessings
[15:43] of almighty god
[15:45] in the great realms beyond
[15:48] we asked lord that you would bless us
[15:50] now
[15:51] each one lord those that have assembled
[15:53] today
[15:55] i ask that you would give a special
[15:57] blessing upon them the bride and the
[15:58] groom and the family
[16:00] and the two families that are being
[16:02] united together by this ceremony
[16:05] i pray father your blessings now would
[16:08] abide in this place
[16:10] and over this marriage and in the days
[16:12] to come
[16:13] in jesus name
[16:15] amen
[16:18] well today we have
[16:20] what i believe is a wedding of royalty
[16:24] the world may not recognize it as such
[16:26] but
[16:27] this wedding today
[16:29] brings together two families
[16:32] and
[16:34] their families of royalty
[16:36] we've stepped out of eternity into a
[16:39] space of time because
[16:42] we were preplanned from the foundation
[16:45] of the world
[16:47] and our names were written on the lamb's
[16:49] book of life
[16:51] and today
[16:52] one of the photos of the lamb's book of
[16:54] life is standing
[16:56] right before us
[16:58] right now
[17:00] and
[17:00] heaven is given witness angels are
[17:03] present
[17:04] watching a scene unfold that was only
[17:07] known by god
[17:08] but expressed now
[17:11] at this moment
[17:13] eternity and time is now blended
[17:15] together in celebration of this
[17:18] momentous occasion this is more than
[17:21] just a beautiful moment
[17:23] in time
[17:24] as it was for ordained before the
[17:26] foundation of the world
[17:28] and not only do we have this great
[17:30] assembled host of friends and family who
[17:34] we so appreciate you being here to
[17:36] support this young couple today
[17:39] but the host of heaven itself has drawn
[17:42] near to
[17:43] witness this event
[17:45] for the attributes of god are on display
[17:49] and this wedding itself is reflecting
[17:52] the glory to come when god will take to
[17:54] himself a bride
[17:56] without spot or wrinkle
[18:00] and as the pruitt and the davis families
[18:02] unite together today
[18:06] we
[18:07] pray a special blessing upon them in
[18:09] this moment in this time
[18:11] for this union as we said was ordained
[18:14] by god
[18:15] and one that god has built
[18:18] it was pre-planned
[18:19] we can't remember standing in eternity
[18:23] because it was still just a thought in
[18:25] god's mind
[18:26] but now we are standing in time
[18:29] doing what god foresaw
[18:31] and for plan
[18:33] long ago
[18:34] in the eternal ages
[18:37] time has its ups and downs
[18:39] it comes with both joys great joys and
[18:43] sometimes with deep sorrows
[18:46] but god in his wisdom knew that man
[18:49] should not
[18:50] be alone and
[18:51] he
[18:52] has destined for this part of life's
[18:54] journey for you two to walk together
[18:58] hand in hand
[19:00] here in time as you head toward eternity
[19:04] and although you may never proclaim the
[19:06] word of god from the pulpit and of
[19:08] course that would be a great honor
[19:10] if you did
[19:12] but nevertheless
[19:14] you are both
[19:15] ordained to carry out his word as
[19:19] as the bride
[19:21] to christ
[19:22] and as a husband
[19:24] who
[19:25] imitates christ in all things even so
[19:28] the woman is to imitate the bride of
[19:31] christ
[19:32] and so god has so designed it where you
[19:35] will not do this alone but together
[19:38] in one flesh
[19:40] and today is a reflection of what god
[19:43] did in the garden of eden
[19:45] as the scripture once again becomes god
[19:48] breathed
[19:50] to be fulfilled now in you
[19:53] and in the garden god created man in his
[19:56] own image from spirit form
[19:59] to flesh form but god did not want man
[20:02] to be alone
[20:04] and i believe this is the heart of god
[20:07] for he too wants a bride in his image
[20:10] so that together they will reign as king
[20:13] and queen and the eternal ages to come
[20:16] when god looked upon adam
[20:19] he sighed man is alone and it's not good
[20:23] so he performed an operation and he
[20:25] reached the way down and
[20:27] to man's side and he brought out a
[20:29] portion of man's own flesh
[20:32] what a wedding that was
[20:36] think of that under the canopy
[20:39] of the garden of eden
[20:41] and just as we saw
[20:43] weston in your eyes as they lit up
[20:46] as she walked down the aisle and all of
[20:49] a sudden
[20:50] these hundreds of guests just faded away
[20:54] and all you could see now was her
[20:57] for suddenly in that moment the most
[20:59] important one
[21:01] in the room had stepped forth
[21:04] may that never leave your life
[21:07] for your eyes must always remain single
[21:09] upon her forsaking all others and
[21:12] clinging only to her
[21:14] and mariah your eyes must always remain
[21:18] single upon your husband
[21:21] so
[21:21] that you behold no other but him
[21:26] you see weston
[21:27] the man is never complete until he's
[21:29] married
[21:31] and after that he's finished
[21:36] so this union you're making is something
[21:38] that god desires to do himself
[21:40] because he's not complete without us
[21:43] and god had placed that
[21:46] in adam to be lonely because he too
[21:48] desired a wife and
[21:50] while the prophets foretold this and
[21:53] isaac and rebecca portrayed it and we
[21:56] read biblical accounts of the love of a
[21:59] man and a woman of jacob's love for
[22:01] rachel of mary pledged to joseph
[22:05] of the shulamite and her beloved and
[22:08] none of that could fully express
[22:10] god's great desire though
[22:13] so jesus left the ivory palaces
[22:17] and his golden streets
[22:19] and all of heaven's glory
[22:22] to take upon himself the form of man
[22:26] and reflect his pleasure in weddings
[22:29] the first miracle he performed would be
[22:31] at a wedding where water
[22:34] was turned into wine
[22:37] he did this by the power of creation
[22:40] and with this power
[22:41] he is right here today to take two
[22:44] people
[22:45] and turn two people
[22:47] into one
[22:50] the bible tells us
[22:52] that god is love and that love comes
[22:54] from god
[22:56] from the beginning to the end the bible
[22:58] is a love story
[23:01] there we read of god's love to his
[23:03] people the love that sent christ to the
[23:06] cross
[23:07] of the redeeming love for the sinner and
[23:10] the abiding love for the redeemed
[23:13] you see god is the author of your love
[23:16] and that love is not to be temporary
[23:20] do not treat it as temporary
[23:22] never take one day for granted
[23:24] life is
[23:25] too short
[23:27] make christ a part of your marriage
[23:30] he wants to be the unseen guest in your
[23:32] home
[23:33] he wants to be in every conversation
[23:36] he is always neared in good times and
[23:40] bad times and difficulties and
[23:43] financial troubles
[23:44] and choices of life and great decisions
[23:47] that will have to be made
[23:49] he's always there
[23:51] make sure you don't go one day
[23:54] without spending
[23:56] time together with each other
[23:58] but more importantly with him
[24:02] weston
[24:03] i believe that you are a real man
[24:06] i believe you're a prince a child of the
[24:08] most high god
[24:10] your family your pastor
[24:12] your church family
[24:14] have done an incredible job of raising
[24:17] you and preparing you for this day and
[24:20] i i believe young men like you are a
[24:22] description of what this message is
[24:26] what is the message
[24:28] you're it
[24:29] you're the description of all the
[24:32] incredible sermons that
[24:34] are about and you're a great compliment
[24:37] to your
[24:38] great grandfather's ministry and all the
[24:41] other wonderful sermons that your pastor
[24:43] and other men of god have poured out
[24:45] into you
[24:46] there's a lot of heritage right here
[24:49] and i believe from the banisters of
[24:51] heaven there are those looking over
[24:54] and witnessing two
[24:56] joining in with us at this moment
[25:00] moriah supernatural gifts came through
[25:03] your family you have a great heritage
[25:07] there is
[25:09] there is a handing down from one
[25:11] generation to another
[25:13] the seeds of greatness
[25:15] that was in your forefathers or in you
[25:18] and god has done an incredible
[25:21] miracle in your life
[25:23] so that your name is known around the
[25:26] world
[25:28] but join together now your
[25:30] life will have more depth
[25:32] you will have greater understanding
[25:35] and god has set you apart
[25:37] from others to be
[25:39] a shining example to the world of god's
[25:42] grace and his goodness
[25:44] god is the author of love it is him that
[25:46] brings us together
[25:49] it is his love that will carry us
[25:50] through
[25:52] love conquers all
[25:54] it conquers every demon it conquers
[25:56] every power
[25:58] it is the greatest force on the face of
[26:00] the earth
[26:02] so
[26:03] let nothing come between you if it does
[26:05] recognize it would be the spirit of the
[26:07] enemy
[26:09] all there's surely be times of
[26:11] disagreements
[26:13] but every argument or ever disagreement
[26:16] can always be settled on your knees
[26:20] and remember
[26:22] this powerful word and put it to use
[26:25] forgive
[26:27] love is based on forgiveness
[26:30] hold no grudges
[26:32] let go and just love for love
[26:35] is of god
[26:39] western
[26:40] will you have this woman to live
[26:42] together
[26:43] in holy covenant of marriage
[26:46] will you love her honor her and comfort
[26:48] and keep her in sickness and in health
[26:51] and forsaking all others
[26:53] be faithful to her as long as you both
[26:55] shall live
[26:57] mariah
[26:59] will you have this man
[27:01] to live together in
[27:03] the holy covenant of marriage will you
[27:06] love him
[27:07] honor him
[27:08] comfort and keep him
[27:10] in sickness and in health and forsaken
[27:12] all others
[27:14] be faithful to him as long as you both
[27:16] shall live
[27:19] see marriage was instituted by god is
[27:22] not simply an idea of man
[27:24] marriage is a gift of god
[27:27] it's given to comfort the sorrows of
[27:29] life and to celebrate its joys
[27:32] marriage is the clasping of hands the
[27:34] blending of hearts
[27:36] the uniting of two lives as one
[27:40] your marriage must stand
[27:42] it doesn't it won't stand just
[27:44] necessarily by the authority of the
[27:46] state nor by the seal of your wedding
[27:48] certificate
[27:49] but rather it must stand on the strength
[27:51] of your love
[27:53] it must stand in the devotion of your
[27:56] love to one another in the good times
[27:57] and the bad
[27:59] and finally
[28:00] it must stand because of the
[28:03] participation of god
[28:05] in your relationship
[28:07] see marriage is meant to be the greatest
[28:10] human relationship
[28:12] that you will ever experience
[28:15] however in order for marriage to reach
[28:17] its full potential
[28:19] you must allow god to
[28:21] play a primary part
[28:24] and role in your relationship
[28:26] he knows your thoughts he knows your
[28:28] needs he understands your hearts
[28:32] and your love for each other in fact
[28:35] it was god that created the love and the
[28:38] excitement
[28:39] that you're experiencing this very
[28:41] moment
[28:43] the ideal marriage is like an eternal
[28:45] triangle
[28:47] with each of you at the bottom of the
[28:49] triangle and god at the top
[28:52] in that triangle the closer you get to
[28:54] god the closer you become to one another
[28:58] certainly you want your new life to be
[29:00] perfect
[29:02] you have visions of an eternity of joy
[29:05] but
[29:06] let me caution you it won't always be
[29:08] that way all the time
[29:10] unfortunately sorrow and heartache can
[29:13] find their ways into every life
[29:16] however if that eternal triangle remains
[29:19] unbroken
[29:21] no problem will ever
[29:23] be too
[29:24] great weston
[29:27] love moriah as your wife
[29:30] with all your being
[29:32] jesus just as christ loved the church
[29:36] and your wants and your needs will
[29:38] always be met likewise mariah
[29:41] if you respect and love and honor and
[29:44] western as your husband
[29:46] he will love and care for you all the
[29:47] days of your life
[29:50] and finally let me say to both of you
[29:52] remember the eternal triangle
[29:55] keep your spiritual eyes and ears open
[29:58] to god who is the source
[30:00] of love and fulfillment will be yours
[30:04] i promise you
[30:05] he will lead you into capacities
[30:08] that you never dreamed
[30:11] you possessed
