it now into your hands in Jesus name amen amen amen tonight I'm going to have a a PowerPoint that I that I use that way it makes it easier on the on the people in the booth whenever I have a a lot of scriptures or a lot of quotes it makes it easier for me to to do it that way so tonight we're going to speak to you on on called out to conquer called out to conquer and I believe as a people that we're called out to more than just coming out it's more than just than just coming out but we're we're called out to more even than just salvation uh but we've been called out to conquer and to conquer to conquer everything that that's placed before us and and not just making it by on the by the skin of our teeth not just barely getting in and and just if I can put it like this not just overcoming sin not just overcoming sin and the things of this world but overcoming even the the fruits of the curse that try to rise up in our flesh you know whether it be things you know like like even temper or things like that many times we get saved and we see things fall off of our lives and and we're happy about that and we should be but then we stay in that spot the rest of our lives that's as far as we go or as far as we progress we're delivered we're saved but we haven't gone any further and I believe that we're supposed to apply the token to every aspect of our life every part of our life and in other words let the power of God work in everything not not not just cleanse you from sin but some people may not look at this as spiritual but I'm was going to say it let it make you be a better neighbor let it make you be a better person a more understanding person a less selfish person let it operate in everything Conquering the parts of ourselves that many times we chalk up to personality oh that's just my personality and and yes our focus is always going to be spiritual it's even spiritual in this thought tonight but I just want us to see that God wants us to go forward and to progress and to conquer in all aspects of our life so with that and in mind we're going to turn to the scripture this this evening numbers 13 and verse 25 numbers 13 and verse 25 and we're going to read down through verse 30 it says and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of pan to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whether thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anac there the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it amen I pray that the Lord will add his Blessing to the word as you have your seats that's how I feel this evening about every trial and every tribulation and everything that that stands before us we are well able to overcome it amen we know this story well of The Exodus how how they come up out of Egypt and and and how that God's children were loose by the power of God and they came out under the message of a prophet it's something that we can relate to so easily and and relate it to this day how how they come out under the message of a prophet and and the ministry of that Prophet was accompanied by signs and wonders vindicating that God was with him amen and it Vindicated that what he told them was the truth and and we know that they journeyed and and as they journeyed that that the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud and he also went before them by night in a pillar of fire and and we know all the the the amazing things that happened along the way the Red Sea was opened and Mana rained down from heaven and bitter Waters were made sweet and water came out of the Rock and and what was it it was just God continually showing them that I'm in your midst no matter what you have need of no matter what you come up against don't worry I'm with you I'm in your midst I'm going to supply your every need and and and they were moving under a mighty message once again something we can relate to We Are moving in this day under the most powerful message that has ever struck the face of the Earth and and yes there had there had been trials but God had delivered can we testify to that and there had been hardships but God's mercy sustained them and that they came and they fought with amalec and they won and and and and even after they made the golden calf and angered God so much even then he still came and and and in Exodus 34 he renews his promise and his Covenant with them he says behold I make a covenant beh before all thy people I will do Marvels such as have not been done in all the Earth nor in any nation in all the people amongst which Thou Art shall see the work of the Lord for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee observe thou that which I command thee this day behold now Focus right here behold I drive out before Thee the Amorite and the Canaanite and the itte and the perizzite and the hibit and the jebusite and you know if each one of us began and would go back to the beginning of our Christian walk I feel like we would all have a list similar to the list that that Israel experienced to where when we came up against something we didn't know what was going to happen God parted the waters and let us go through when we came up against enemies that we didn't know how we were going to defeat God came down and defeated those enemies for us when we didn't know how to pay the bills when we didn't know where where where you know when all our friends turned against us he was there in every situation we have a testimony that can match up to that of Israel and even when we have failed him how many times has he come back and confirmed his Covenant with us again look you messed up but I want you to know I'm still with you look you messed up but I want you to know I'm still going to drive out your enemies look you haven't done all hadn't kept your end of the bargain but I want you to know that I'm going to keep my end of the bargain every time we fall he's there saying look I knew you were going to fall that's why I died I knew you were going to mess up that's why I provided and he's there reconfirming his Covenant to the people and the thing is if we could ever truly get that into our hearts tonight that no matter what God has never left us no matter what God has never failed us no matter the situation he's seen you through it every time if you could get that truly in your heart I believe you could walk out of here tonight in perfect faith knowing I'm going to make it I know I'm going to overcome I know the promises are true because he's seen me through every single time he's kept me this far he brought me through this trial he brought me through this flood he brought me through this attack he's going to see me all the way through to the Rapture if he's kept me this far and he said he would never leave me and never forsake me and his word's always been true it's going to continue to be true you can trust in this God tonight amen so whatever faces you today you don't have to back down from it you don't have to back off of one promise that you're holding on to it it may be the greatest battle you've ever been in in your whole life but just like every other time let me go ahead and tell you the outcome you're going to win it may take months it may take years but you're going to win his promises will never ever fail it won't return unto him void you just stand there and hold up your end of the bargain and say I believe Lord and I'm going to fight for it amen but under that message and under the leadership of the pillar of fire and the testimony of all those victories they arrive at Kadesh all right and I realized that this is a major event and that this is where they they fail to go over and they fail to take the land and they fail to conquer all that God has given them so I don't mean to trivialize this at all or make it seem like it's not such a big thing but as we journey you're going to face Kadesh over and over and over and over again you're going to have many situations where you stand at Kadesh in your life times where you have to decide whether or not you're going to trust trust God and press in or whether you're going to sit there and allow the circumstances to be stacked up in a certain way that makes you back off as a matter of fact we kind of every time we get up look in the mirror every single day we stand at a Cades what am I going to do today am I going to hold my ground today am I going to hold the faith today am I going to stand today because every single day circumstances are going to be stacked up against you that's just the world we live in as a matter of fact facts will be stacked up against you you can stack facts in any way you want to present an argument the devil's really really really good at it as a matter of fact they used facts at Kadesh there's Giants in the land there's walled cities those were facts those those weren't lies they were telling the truth but they took those very facts things that they should have just looked at and said that's fine that's just that's what we're going to overcome that's what we're going to conquer but they allowed the fact stacked up in a certain way to make them say let's turn around and let's go back we can't do it listen brde of Jesus Christ there is nothing that you can't do there is no devil you can't conquer there is no stronghold you can't possess tonight because he's already promised it to you amen we face this every single day as we war with our flesh every single day are you going to conquer today are you going to rise to the challenge today and as we go through this thought tonight I want you to make it personal this isn't a group thing tonight this isn't a church thing tonight this is a you thing tonight this is a me thing tonight Caleb showed that it was personal even with with with his testimony and his life in other words the whole group of them said we can't do it but he showed it's not a group thing it's an individual thing he said look I don't care what you guys do give me my Mountain I don't care what you decide to do I'm going on with Jesus I don't care if you don't possess it I'm going to this is a me thing I'm going to stand for what the word said I'm going to take what God Said I can have and you have to make that same decision for you he said I didn't come to play church I didn't come all this way to go back to Egypt I'm not going to be a slave again I came to conquer I came to win and I believe that's the attitude of every son and daughter of God you've been called out to take the land we haven't been called out to wander in the wilderness that's not what we were called called out for you've been called out to take the land overcome just as he overcame and in the end after every devil has been conquered you've been called to Rapture amen you've been called to conquer just like the groom conquered when he was here upon the Earth so with that in mind we can't be a stagnant people we can't be a people camp down in one place not moving not progressing people who remain in the same place around the same Mountain year after year after year going around the same mountain and yet satisfied because we're called out satisfied that we're a chosen people so were the Pharisees satisfied that we've been brought out of Egypt a lot were and Jesus said they're everyone dead satisfied that we're following Moses and most of them didn't enter in we can't be satisfied ified where we're at we can't just sit here and go around and round and round but we got to be a people ever progressing ever going forward ever taking more Lord where where can I get more today how can I gain more today where can I improve as a person today how can I take another step in my walk with you today and I say all that as if it's something easy but I'm going to go and tell you it's not easy at all it's never been easy and it's not going to be easy it's something you have to be willing to fight for and that's why so many people never progress because I just think it's going to come easy I'm G to give my heart to the Lord I'm gonna get saved I'm G get filled with the Holy Ghost I'm just going to walk through this thing it's going to be so easy I'm going to cruise right onto the Rapture and when they bump up against things and they bump up against trials and they run into heartache and they run into situation they Camp down right there and they go well this far enough I can't take that there's a giant in my way and I can't take that but that's not God's people God's people looks at and says my promise is on the other side of that giant so that Giant's got to fall that Giant's got to move that mountain in my way is going to hear my voice as I say pick thyself up and be cast into the sea because I've got to get to my promises something you got to be willing to fight for and as I read through these Scriptures it struck me how many times that the word tells us exactly what's going to happen it tells us exactly how it's going to be and then we get shook when it turns out it was right we get All Shook Up when it turns out it was the truth I want to go back to Genesis 15 and when God talks to Abraham about this land and at this point he's already said uh told Abraham in Genesis 12:7 and also in Genesis 13:15 that the land was given to him and his seed was going to to possess the land but once again here in Genesis 15 and 18 He says in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying under thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates now notice the canite the kenites and the kenites and the cadon ites and the Hittites and the perizzites and the reims and the amorites and the Canaanites and the geosites and the jebusites what was he saying that's where the chapter ends but what was he saying to him there what was he doing he he was telling Abraham Who currently dwells in the land and who's going to have to be dispossess in order for you to possess the land there's things you're going to have to dispossess in order for you to take that place and he tells Abraham at the very beginning when your seed goes these people are going to be there that's they're going to be there when you get there and now look again as he talks to Moses about the land in Exodus 3 and8 and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large and unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites once again he tells Moses at this point right now here's who's living in that land and these are the people that's going to have to be dispossessed in order in order for Israel to claim their promises and so the spies are sent over to to check out the land and spy out the land and if you look at their testimony at the beginning It lines up exactly with the message that was given to them the fruits are there just like he said look we even brought some back the milk and honey is there just like he said we even and notice they're actually rejoicing in the fact that what the word said is the truth he said it was there and here it is he said these were there and here it is and wait for it we can't take this land because he said there was going to be people there and there they are think about it they got shook because the word was exactly right look at numers 13 and 29 the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan I want you to notice something with Caleb Caleb's a type of the True Believer and up to this point he doesn't have any reason to disagree with his brothers they're saying man they dwell there and they dwell he don't even realize they're saying this as a negative in the mind of a believer he just going yep that's exactly what the word said so far so good so far this is perfect they he said there'd be milk and honey and it was there he said there'd be fruits and it was there he said there'd be devils in the land and they're there and he said we could conquer it so we're going to conquer it so he responds to this yes sir and I say we go take it right now we're more than able that's Caleb's response to it let's go take it but the men that went up with him said we' be not able to go up against the people look they had just kept agreeing with the word this is the first place they've kind of veered off for they are stronger than we if you ever stop and think about how nonsensical this is Egypt was stronger than we everybody we've defeated thus far is stronger than we but we won anyway because our God God goes before us we want anyway cuz God's on our side but all of a sudden the devil turns it and they get the same interpreter that Eve had and when they do can't be they're stronger than we they go so far as saying let's make captains and go back to Egypt why well we're going to do that because it's exactly how the word said it would be it's nonsensical right but see what happens is is now the sword is being placed in their hand think about it they're going to have to take God at his word and go to battle they're going to have to swing a sword and take the land it's about it's going to be them squaring off face to face with the devil and suddenly they don't want no part of that what am I telling you I'm telling you that the word has told us it's going to be home Lord the word has told us it's going to be a fight the word has told us it's going to be an evil day it's going to be a dark day the word has told us that there's going to be scoffers in the land the word has told us that that they're going to ridicule you and make fun and that and that the love of many would wax cold and that there' be Rebellion like never before and lovers of self and lovers of pleasure and we look at it we go it's exactly like the word said it was it's not time to run away it's time to go well if all of that's true then so is the rest of it I am the Lord God that Health thee amen there's going to be a body change I'm going to have a church without spot a wrinkle if all that's true then so is this he's my healer he's my deliverer he's my savior He's My All In All Because the word is the truth we were told that we were going to have to fight brother Brandon would say for every single inch of ground that's why he would preach sermons like how can I overcome possessing the gates of the enemy we were told we were warned and now as we press into the to take the land and as we try to take another step we're faced with the reality that it's just exactly like they said it was going to be it's just as evil as the word said it would be there are attacks coming on every single side and now as you stand at Kadesh having seen the fruits as you stand at cadis knowing it's the truth knowing the reality of it knowing that it's real and the enemy stands over there right on top of your promise and he's daring you to take that next step it's going to be hard it's going to be a battle it's going to be tough and he's daring you to take the land and so I ask you will you conquer will you take the land will you take the next step there's evidence there we've seen the evidence we've seen that it's real over and over again God's been Faithful over and over again we got testimonies right here of healings over and over again salvation over and over again marriage is turned around financial trouble that that that was turned around you've seen situations that seemed absolutely impossible get resolved by God it's the fruit of the land it's a real land it's a real place there's real power it's exactly what the word said it would be but battles await you brother bam says you fight every inch of the way he said God down in Egypt give Palestine to the Jews but they fought every inch of the way God told Joshua everywhere The Souls of your feet rest that have I given you footsteps mean Victory possession and just as far as you can climb into the kingdom of God now this is what I was talking about even at the beginning and not just being satisfied with salvation but let's go beyond he says if you just want to climb a little piece and say well I believe I may not have to go to hell but I believe that I'll be saved at the end if I join Church you ain't got much ground yet but every promise in the Bible is yours but you'll have to fight every devil guard away from it with a two-edged sword and claim it for yourself be persistent walking right into it notice the devil's got a guard sitting on every single promise but brother Brown says you're going to have to fight them away with the two-edged sword I loved hearing about it the other day that that that sword that came down and how it's being yielded by a hand of faith if you got a hand of Faith tonight there's some devil standing on your promises that you're going to have to fight off tonight you're going to have to swing the sword you're going to have to get bloody you're going to have to go into battle you're going to have to not be a coward he says amen there you are the believer today yet we're heir to All Things yet we're air to every spiritual blessing notice it's yours you're air to it every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises yet you have to fight for every inch of it that's the way God's got it set up it's always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own you have to fight to possess it and that's what we have to do now you have to fight to possess what you know is your own and that's what Israel wasn't willing to do they weren ready they wern't ready to do that they didn't mind the come com out they didn't mind the provisions along the way it was great when God defeated Egypt by the prophet speaking the word it was great when the Red Sea opened and then closed again and destroyed their enemy because the prophet lifted his Rod up over the waters oh it was all great then it was great when it was God doing and it was the prophet doing it but now that same God's promising Victory but he's saying I'm going to use you to do it I'm going to put the sword in your hand and I'm going to send you into battle and you're going to go face to face with the Enemy the prophet ain't going to do it you're going to swing the sword you're going to have to have faith over fear you're going to have to face your complexes you're going to have to face your family strains you're going to have to go in and Conquer this time it's up to yes I've already bought it yes it's already yours but you got to fight for what you know is yours amen it's going to be close contact it's going to be face to face you're going to feel the breath of the enemy that means it's going to get bloody that means you're going to be ridiculed that means your faith is going to be tried and that means you're going to have to put the sword in action you're going to have to fight for it he promised to pour His Spirit out on All Flesh you're going to have to fight for it he promised that that that your children would be saved you're going to have to fight for it he he promised that there would be a Rapture in this day guess what you're going to have to fight for it he promised you could have peace you're going to have to fight for it he promised you could have joy you are going to have to fight for it he teaches it over and over again you want healing you're going to have to fight for it willing to draw the sword but what a weapon we have the sword that's coming this day the open word faith is restored faith is elevated now take the sword and fight for what is yours in this day that's one thing that the devil likes to do don't don't let the fact that you're fighting for it make you think it isn't happening every matter of fact most things aren't instantaneous most things you got to hold on to and fight for and claim and struggle and wrestle it out like Jacob did it's not just going to come instantaneous and quick you got to be ready to fight for it well I left the World Behind and I'm following the message and I'm a Believer awesome now it's time to conquer now it's time to take the land now it's time to fight look he conquered when he was here and what was the whole point of that so he could send back his life he conquered now he sent back his life to live in you so that you could conquer and he expects you to conquer and he's telling you to swing the sword it's time for you to turn the stone loose he gave you the stone he gave you the rock he gave you fi t f AI t h he's put it there and don't just stand there slinging it around and around and around turn it loose tonight turn the word loose the power that you need is already within you but there comes a point where you got to release it and let it go to work on your behalf it's time to swing the sword it's time to to release the word I tell you what it's not time for it's not time for murmuring and complaining it's it is time for that to stop and I don't just mean about about church I mean about everything quit being a complainer brother Brown says I don't try to I I do not try to say too much about it you know around people complaining cuz I think one of the most horriblest things is to see a man or woman that's constantly complaining amen I've always thought God keep me from it well I bet the prophet was always praying about all these real deep things and all that and he's going to run praying God keep me from complaining we got to apply things practically God keep me from it see that that weakens Faith all the time you know and it doesn't just weaken your own faith it wears on the people that have to hear it constantly gripe and moan and gripe and moan and complain and the church this and and then my body this and this and this just stop stop complaining brother Brown says if you complain too much your water supply gets cut off look I don't know about you but I can't live very long without water we're not going to make it very long without water that's why you see people that walk around in a negative State of Mind griping and complaining they shrivel up and die I mean they may be walking around but it's a shell of a person there's no joy there there's no life there there's no overcoming there why because they're test puts them there they're a self-fulfilling prophecy they've come exactly what they say it's not a good day well guess what they're not going to have a good day that's that's just how it works they're kind of determined not to whereas some people wake up and say I'm going to have a good day it doesn't matter what comes God gave me this day I'm breathing today I got a family that loves me I I I got a church that loves me I got listen there's plenty wrong in my life just like there's plenty wrong in your life but I choose to point what's right I'm a Son of God I'm a Child of God He blesses me going and He blesses me coming he's my father and he loves me and that's enough to be positive about right there be positive testify of his goodness testify of his grace testify of his mercy and quit being a complainer quit airing out dirty laundry quit griping about your family quit griping about your spouse if you got a problem griping conquer that thing we've been called out to conquer some folks you don't know you would think God ain't never done a thing for them because you don't never hear about it but you hear about every trial the devil's put on them quit griping rise up above it and speak positive speak about the positives in your life and the goodness in your life listen attacks come and attacks can get us negative for a minute I'm not say listen I'm not trying to act like you know Mr Sunshine that's always happy and Zippity dudah where attacks come bad days happen and you get down you'll probably have negative moments maybe a negative day but it can't be the way you live your life you got to rise above the attacks are going to come persecution is going to come facts are are going to be stacked up they like I said they use facts there at Kadesh bac's going to come and he's going to try to show you the backside of the camp think about it now he's going to show you this flaw and that flaw and this misstep and that misstep listen that that Spirit of of baac will point out the backside of the church leadership forget that for just a minute he'll point out the backside of every one of your brothers and sisters that that that's that's his that's his job he's going to he's going to come and point out point out those flaws and and and point out those things point out their Humanity point out their faults point out their failures brother brandom says he's going to point out their worst parts and never show you the whole picture that's what he does listen it's not spiritual to be able to do that anybody can criticize you catch somebody on a wrong bad day anybody can do it some people ain't got to be a bad day it's just how they roll but it's not spiritual to be critical it's not spiritual at all but what I want to know is when that comes up and that Spirit comes in the church WIll you conquer will you withstand when the backsides pointed out and the Humanity's pointed out and the flaws are pointed out when your brother's shortcomings are displayed for you to see will you conquer well brother Aaron how do you conquer that by pointing to the positives in that brother's Life by not entertaining and spreading the gossip by not letting it Sidetrack you from from the goal which is to Rapture by protecting that brother from the arrows will you be one that holds up Moses's arms when he gets weak or criticize him for being too weak to hold up his own arms where do you fall at where are you will you listen news flash evening light Tabernacle has back Parts what does that mean carnal Parts brother said they use the same tactics today if they find anything wrong amongst the elect that they can make a scandal out of they will shout it from the rooftops what is that it's the spirit of baac who's uh what is he trying to do to curse the children of Israel but if you'll go back and read that every single time he tried to curse them balam would get up and blessings would flow out of his mouth where it got to the point where bayac just said listen don't curse him don't bless them just quit talking cuz every time you open your mouth God blesses them I'm telling you let them curse let them talk bad let them put you down and the Lord just going to keep pouring out his blessings upon your life because you are a son and daughter of God and what people say about you has no effect it has nothing brother Brown says yes Israel had her back part carnal they had their side that wasn't praiseworthy yep me right there I see it but in spite of their imperfections by the purpose of God that works through election I also see me right there by grace and not by works they had the cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night they had the smitten Rock the Brazen Serpent and the signs and wonders they were Vindicated not in themselves but in God little bride you are Vindicated not in yourself but in God he looks down he says I know you're not perfect but I am and it's my blood covering your imperfections now go take the land press the battle Hallelujah you know the first part of what the spies had said was perfect they agreed with the word they testified to its truth it's real look at the fruits we witnessed it and in our own walk in our own life if we would just stick to the original testimony that was the original testimony it's real it's true think about it now when you first fell in love with Jesus when the message first Shone light down in your heart when he first filled you with the Holy Ghost what was your testimony it's real there's the fruits I've experienced it I've seen it for myself you tell everybody you come up to and and people would ask oh it's real I I experienced it but if we're not careful when it comes time to conquer after a period of time when when when something comes up in the church or somebody says something ugly about you or family trouble comes up or sickness strikes your home and if you're not careful you'll let the second part of their testimony into your testimony instead of it's real everything's fine God's got this it's you don't understand how bad this sickness is but but he he said we're healed yeah but this is this ain't just some little cold this is big this is cancer yeah yeah but but but his word says that you know I will restore but you don't understand how long my kids have been out there you don't understand the situation you began to give voice to the strength of the very people that you're supposed to be dispos possessing the very devil you're supposed to be casting out and you're sitting there building him up propping him up by allowing the second part of the testimony to come in this trial is so big this temptation is so bad this family trait is so strong yes it's going to be a fight it's all going to be a fight it's all going to be a war brother brandom says he said I'll give it to you but it's full of giants you'll have to fight every inch of the way but every place The Souls of your footsteps that's possession go take it sure I'll be with you listen that's enough right there Lord as long as you go with me I'll go as long as you're with me in this trial I know I'm coming out as long as you're going before me I know I got nothing to worry about he said I'll go with you but that's the thing is it's easy to testify when it's fresh anybody can testify during a Revival anybody can testify and worship when they're on the Mountaintop but the minute the hardships begin they want to back up and back off and go back but real sons and daughters they got a certain kind of grit about them there's a certain type of toughness on the inside of them that they can't explain there's something put down on the inside of them that's made to believe there's something on the inside of them that's made to press on it's made to overcome it's made to win the battles It's Made To Conquer It's Made To Live eternally look I can't do it I can't keep pressing but there's something on the inside of me that's pushing and pulling and it says fulfill the word fulfill the word fulfill the word what what part am I supposed to fulfill that we're going to overcome everything that the groom left for the bride to overcome we've got to fulfill all right righteousness how we going to do it there's something on the inside of us driving us to do it oh yes even when hell's against you even when all around you is nothing but negativity it just Rises up even now my God is able even now in the fire he's going to move even now through the flood he's going to move Hallelujah and I'm going to conquer what does conquer mean conquer means to gain or acquire by Force of Arms bring under do domination or control especially by Conquest this doesn't sound like anything's being given away to gain a victory over to surmount to master to overcome see the thing about Israel and that in in that whole generation that wandered in the wilderness all those years is they never did conquer and I don't just mean at Kadesh they had never conquered not one time it was a constant failure with God bailing them out Time After Time After Time God had continually delivered them despite their attitudes continually delivered them despite their unbelief and and before kades they had never one time conquered it kades was just a repeat of what had always happened it was it was just a repeat it was the same old thing they griped at each place they griped at each hardship they griped every time they didn't see things the way Moses saw them but they were called out they were following the prophet following a message but it was a vicious cycle I know we said something about this Friday night young people but your problems don't just go away young people problems come grownup problems if you don't conquer it you got to conquer your problems you got to conquer your issues you got to bring yourself subject to the word if you constantly respond in doubt then you're going to constantly respond in doubt until you conquer that thing if if if you always respond with temper then you will always respond with temper until you conquer that thing you don't grow out of it you got to conquer that thing if it's always anger or always be anger if you always fall to the same thing then that thing's going to pop up in your life and you're going to fall to it Time After Time After Time same complex you're going to fall to it same fear you're going to fall to it it's time that you recognize I must conquer this thing by force or else it's going to raise up and be a thorn in my side every day of my life but today tonight I recognize I'm more than a conqueror I'm called to conquer and I'm going to gain a victory over this thing by Force of Arms I'm going to bring it under domination I'm going to control it with a conquest I'm going to gain a victory over the thing that has tormented me I'm going to be the Conqueror tonight you got to quit fooling yourself I got this under control no you don't no you don't until you've conquered it you don't have it under control that thing will pop it may be at six years from now but if you just buried that lust problem over the side somewhere and and ignored it and put your head in the sand say I guess that went away it'll pop back up and come again and try to try to drag you back into that until you conquer that thing until you put it underneath your foot God brought you here to conquer your bone of his bone life of his life power of his power he was the first to do it now he expects you to do it conquer what am I supposed to conquer brother and first of all you got to conquer this land you got to conquer this land right here and the way you do it is by dying out daily to your flesh and letting the Holy Ghost Reign it's not just a one time thing you got to die out every single day Paul speaks about in the scripture and brother Brandon would speak on it many many times he says now you will sin you're bound to sin because you just can't help it now notice before we run with that notice the next line but not willfully sin God's children never willfully sin he that sins willfully after he received the knowledge of Truth see there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but every day you're bound to sin and you're bound to be backsliding constantly wow this is why you can't go Sunday to Wednesday Wednesday to Sunday Sunday to Wednesday Youth Camp to Youth Camp it's got to be every single day that you commune with God that you pray or you read your Bible or you listen to a message whatever you do however you do it you better be doing something you're bound to be backsliding constantly so it takes a constant prayer to God Paul said I Die daily and if Paul had to Die daily how much more am I going I'm going to have to stay Dead all the time and he actually says this quite often you got to stay Dead all the time if Paul had to Die daily to stay right with God and so we'll all have to do that just die out to yourself and that's getting God's way amen see what happens is you kill the old man or you bury the old man but that old man tries to resurrect he tries to raise up time after time after time that Rebellion you conquered it's going to try to come back now if you truly conquered it you'll keep the victory over that thing but if you just pushed it aside and just let him rearm himself to come back and try again now he's coming back seven times stronger I'm talking about conquering but it's going to try to raise up don't be shocked when it tries to rear its head up again and and don't think that because you're having to fight it that oh no I must not have got anything from God I must not have really received anything because this thing coming back and it's fighting me again I must not be a real Christian because that old man's trying to resurrect the you know the devil loves to make you feel guilty for fighting battles he loves to bring Temptation and then make you feel like a failure because you were tempted you are going to fight battles and be tempted every single day of your life you're going to fight battles and be tempted but fighting a battle isn't a failure being tempted isn't a failure you're going to face Temptations you're going to face battles but you're called to conquer Temptations you're called to win those battles it's what you're called for you are an overcomer and not only have you been called for it but in this day you've been empowered for it listen whereas before you couldn't now you can whereas before you'd fall now you stand why because the life that was in him is now living on the inside of you and it's why you're here you're here to win you're here to take the land not make a captain and go back to Egypt you are going to win he says nothing less he that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and Die daily stay dead there on the cross that's right Agony there's several places where brother brandham actually says there's no way to conquer without suffering no way to conquer without Agony now what is the agony I thought man we're we're full of joy the joy of the Lord we're it's not a there is Agony because see it's easy to be who you are by Nature that's easy to do it's easy to revert back to family traits it it it's easy to be angry if you got temper problem think about it if you got a temper it's not hard to get angry that's easy that's not Agony that's easy it's easy to talk about people bad if you got a gossip problem but see the agony is crucifying and killing that part of yourself and keeping it dead when a situation situation arises you feel warrants temper somebody pops off to you and looks at you all crazy right then your normal response is oh it's go time let's do this now that's not Agony that's easy Agony is going Agony it hurts it hurts listen sometimes I've been accused of being smart it's wild stories out there people I'm telling you but I tell my wife all the time I should get a trophy for all the stuff I don't say they're way funnier than the stuff I do say but it hurts you're s there going that have been so funny that guy would have never spoke to me again but that have been funny it's harder to stop yourself than to just say it that's my battle God crucified that guy probably need to do it more regularly quit laughing Bethany it's a struggle you have strugg yeah you have struggles things that you got to deal with daily or else it'll get out of control battles that you got to fight you know you got to be willing to to to lay aside what you know cast down your ideas sometimes things worn a little bit of attitude you teenagers feel like and it's Agony to hold it back and smile and go yes ma'am it's hard be way easier just to pop off crucifying the flesh is Agony casting down your ideas and and crucifying your own thinking when you're confronted with the truth of the word listen it's okay to have your own idea it's okay to have your own thinking until you're presented with the word and you recognize it don't line up now you got to crucify it there's nothing wrong with your opinions we're all entitled to an opinion you're entitled to think what you want but when the word's presented to you and in its opposite crucify that thing lay it aside get rid of it let's quit allowing what we know to hinder us forget what you know and know Jesus Paul said he had to forget everything he knew to learn Christ and because of all he knew that's why he had to Die daily because if he didn't then those old thoughts of his own would begin to come in so he had to crucify that man day after day because we struggle brother BR says now I don't mean to say you went out in the world and you did this and that but you done something that's pretty broad I ain't saying you went out sinning but you done something you've got to repent and Die daily to live in Jesus Christ so every daily every day you got to die every day to to live in Christ if you want to progress spiritually there are things that you got to be willing to die out to within yourself things you got to let go we must be willing to take account of who we are and then be willing to crucify the parts that hinder us and Lam that you're called to conquer but in order to conquer you got to crucify the things that are keeping you from conquering you want Revival fires to keep going die out daily because that old man resurrected your life will kill a Revival fire real quick that old man raising up will make it all of a sudden where it's difficult for you to Worship in church sure it will it's the flesh that keeps you from praying praying through it's the flesh that keeps you from entering in on a Wednesday night it's the flesh sure the flesh is tired the spirit wants to the spirit on the inside of you you felt the joy of the Lord before you've been free in his presence before you know what it's like to get loose and you want to get loose you want to rejoice want to give him your all but you're tired you're a little bit upset In the Flesh you're mad at a brother because of something he said you got out upset about something somebody in your family did and now you're struggling just to break through in the service well if they would know it's time for you to die again but they it's time for you to die again he says I want to take my subject this morning how can I overcome now I chose this because I think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die now he's going to tell you how to never let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day how do we do it Paul said he had to Die daily that Christ could live and we must never let that Revival die within us how you have to Die daily lay down your thinking daily and press the battle listen the idea today isn't to stay where you're at the idea today is to progress and to take the land the idea isn't just come out the idea is to cross over the idea is to Rapture and the greatest enemy you have is complacency it is not your brother it is not people from another church it is not the ministry it's not your wife it is complacency getting comfortable where you are satisfaction with oneself and one achieve and one's achievements but a Christian wakes up and says I got to have more Lord I I've experienced you but I got to have more Lord that old man's trying to raise up so I'm going to crucify him today so more of your spirit can come in I'm going to cast down my ideas so so that your mind can be in my mind and I can be renewed by the word I got to have more I need a refreshing I need an outpouring that's where I'm at tonight not that I'm comfortable yes I'm thankful we were called out yes I'm thankful that we've been on a journey but tonight I want to take the land I want to take more I want to progress into more I want an outpouring in my soul today tonight right [Applause] now one of the problems we Face though is we tend to take pride at what we're best at and try to build build on that that's not how you get better you're already solid there but what you got to do instead is face what you're worst at find your weakness what is my weakness where can I improve the most and attack that area build in that area listen some people don't regularly self-reflect and it shows I believe in self-reflection looking and examining your life looking and examining yourself under a microscope look really closely how can I grow as a person how can I be a better friend brother Aon that's not very spiritual yeah it is it's testimony of who you are how can I be a better dad how can I be a better husband where can I improve what are my weaknesses basic practical things well brother Aaron sin is gone awesome I'm walking with the Lord awesome but are you willing to admit you have an abrasive personality that rubs people the wrong way thank you brother Daryl and instead of going that's just how I am making it a matter of prayer and going Lord let the same power that cleanse me from sin come and begin to mold me and make me a a more enjoyable person a more soft person with a better spirit that that that people enjoy to be around because look I know this is a big jump I'm just going to tell you Cain was told hey you got a problem but all you got to do is fix it and everything will be okay and instead of going okay he said this is just how I am you people can deal with it that's not that's not the spirit of a Christian now I'm not saying we got to go around trying to make everybody happy I think you we're mature enough to understand what I am saying though Lord work on me chisel away on the things in me that might would offend somebody in in the congregation I don't want to offend any of my brothers and sisters I I want to be in a way that that I I can be in harmony with them and I can dwell in unity with them whatever that may take Lord work on me recognize it make it a matter of Prayer you know self-reflection does you no good if we find no weaknesses it actually used to frustrate me when I was a school teacher because twice a year you got evaluated by by the district and they told me at the very beginning no matter what no matter what you may teach the most perfect lesson in the history of ever we are required by law to find two things wrong with it we are required to find two things wrong first I was frustrated by that so you mean I can't be perfect I never taught that perfect lesson anyway I'm just saying I'm just saying you know what am I even striving for but the point was no matter what try to get better you did this really good but you could get better at this I'm serving the Lord with all my heart I'm doing pretty good yeah but you could get better at it and lord said comes on Sundays and sometimes on on Wednesdays and Sundays and he comes with things and you're doing your best but he reveals things to your heart you say oh I could do better at that I could give more of myself there I can give you more Lord quit thinking I've got it down I've been serving the lord 30 Years nope we're going to find two things wrong and we're going to get better at it self-reflect and recognize there's places for me to improve as a person all of us and I don't want you to take this to an extreme this isn't about tearing yourself down it's about growing it's about progressing and not being satisfied where you are and one thing we do instead of self-reflecting that we spend too much time reflecting on others and where they can improve that's easy to see it's way easier to see where other people can get better versus yourself because it's harder to admit for ourselves this isn't to say you're not in a good place this isn't to condemn you for your failures this th this isn't to condemn you for your past the word says that there is therefore now no condemnation this isn't to try to take you backwards this is to take you forward yes I'm saved I'm called I'm chosen now let's let the power of that blood work in the in my life to the fullness in every aspect let it take complete control don't don't this isn't to encourage you to Waller in your failures and brother Aaron says I need to point out all my failures and and I need to see where I fail and we're I mess no we're not here to wallow in our failures and it's also not to encourage you to ignore them what it's saying is you have the power to face them you have the power to conquer them you can quit looking at those family traits and those cycles and going I can't I can't I can't I'm saying face it admit it's there and say I can I will I'm going to take this city I'm I'm going to take this wall I'm going to conquer this devil that has hindered me for all these years brother Bram says for God is with us then who can be against us the great morning star is over us the banner of Christ and we are bound to conquer but you can never apply the blood if you don't acknowledge the need but tonight I say it's time to overcome that thing that's been hindering you your life that crutch that you've been holding on to and I want to go through this before I close and I'm going to start bringing this down but but sometimes people don't even realize that they've crutched their whole life it's an excuse or a reason why they are the way they are listen I had to sit through a whole bunch of psychology classes in college I've dealt with kids for 15 years in the school system I'm not ignorant to the fact that the way you are raised affects you that your childhood years have a huge impact on who you are I understand that and that being said I'm still going to say this you are the way you are because you choose to be the way you are because it's still a choice you still have to make the choice of I'm going to let all that stuff that hurt me and it did bother me I'm going to let it hold me down forever or I'm going to press on and I'm going to be different I'm gonna make a change it's like the story of the two brothers there was one brother there they were twins one of them was a successful businessman ran a big giant Corporation had a perfect family and was in church and did everything right and the other one was a homeless drunk and they went to both of them and said how did you end up here what happened and they both said the exact same answer I watched my dad one of them said wh dad was that way that's how I was raised that's how it's got to be and the other one looked at it and said I'm not going to be that I'm not going to let that hinder me I'm not going to use it as a crutch I'm not going to use it as an excuse I'm going to be different I'm going the other way quit going round and round and round in family cycles and say I'm not going to be that I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm going to rise above my past I'm going to rise above my family traits I'm rise above who my daddy was and my mama was I'm going to conquer I'm going to overcome you're called to [Applause] conquer people raised poor bad past parents didn't love me didn't have parents I suffered horrible tragedy I have an emotional Scar from my childhood and it's not to make light of those things those are awful terrible things that hurt and definitely have impact fact but too many people choose to live in that hurt and lay in that hurt I said get up from that hurt but they always want to point back to that hurt every time you're around them you you feel drugged right back to their hurt right back to their pain no move on but you don't you don't understand you didn't go through what I went through I'm not saying they didn't have an effect I'm saying Turn the Page there's more to your story there's more to your story there's a lot more joy in the story but if you sit right there and read the same page over and over and over and over and over then that becomes who you are move on from that cast it down and move on because you can progress you've been called to progress the the struggles of our flesh are nothing more than the than the result of the of the Fall whether it's your temper your fear your complexes your pride whatever you want to place there tonight whatever your situation is but you've been called to overcome that curse by the power of the Holy Ghost but order to do so you got to start turning down the LIE of the enemy you got to start turning it down turn him down when he says your failures Define you turn him down when he says that you can't overcome your past turn him down when he says that you're always going to be just like this because in order to accept the promise you got to turn down a lie brother brandham says in order for e to accept the lie she had to turn down the word it works both ways you can't be dragging along your complexes and holding on to the promise you got to bury those complexes you know if you let those things stay in your life stay in your life and you get a little bit of reprieve and a little bit of reprieve you never know where you stand and you stay shook up one day on the mountain top the next day confused the next day I'm an overcomer the next day I'm a nobody look turn down the LIE of the devil there's only one truth about you and it's written in the word of God you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you're a conqueror you're more than a conqueror you're going to make it you're going to be there your offspring's going to be there that's the truth that's the word that's where I'm going to stand grab a hold of that but in order to do it you got to cast down imagination cast down complexes cast down hurts cast down your past cast down the LIE of the enemy and clutch onto the truth of the word of God hold on to this if you want to be a conqueror Hallelujah me skip some of this down to a close you got to let the word change your thinking tonight feed on the word believe the word because what it does is it reinforces you every Spirit does the same thing negative people hang out with negative people critical people hang out with critical people people find people that agree with with them and they hang out with them to reinforce their argument it's human nature Christians do the same thing I get around other Christians because you're like me we got faith in the same way negative reinforces negative we come together and we let positive reinforce positive we feed off one another it's our job to reinforce one another it's our job to lift one another up unbelief will always point to the negative and downplay the positive it will acknowledge it yeah that's true but yes he's a Healer but yes but you don't understand that there's this giant and you don't understand there's this issue that's not how a conqueror thinks that's not how a son or daughter of God speaks we are to be positive people we overcome by our testimony promises are even brought to pass by our attitudes toward them brother Bram taught that and faith on the other hand May acknowledge the trial and it may acknowledge the fact that there's a giant oh yes there's a giant but they also have a butt there's a giant but there's a trial in my way but the devil set up all kind of fortifications but God said I can have it God said he's a Healer God said I'm a conqueror yes he said that there's Devils there but I'm here to take the land but I'm going to overcome but I'm going to be healed but I'm going to rap but I'm going with a new body yes the devil set everything up but I'm going to tear his kingdom down his walls are coming down his chains are falling off oh he's got he's a he's a worthy adversary but he will be defeated Hallelujah I've been called to more than coming out I'm called to conquer how can you say that because the word says that Romans 8:37 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us I'm not going to have time to finish all this so I'm going to finish on this as we talk about being positive I want to go back and look at Caleb there in the book of numbers after he steals the people and he says let's go take the land and the gripers and the Skeptics and the pessimistic folk all bring up an evil report and they cap it off with this this is their big oh yeah I know but what about this moment and there we saw the Giants the sons of anac which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so were we in their sight Caleb said let's take the land they said but they're sons of anac okay I got get that let's take the land God said we can have it we're more than able the word is true that's my testimony but you don't understand what the doctor said yeah I do I I heard I heard that that's that's awful but the word is true God said we can have our healing let's take the land but you don't understand where my wife and children are I I do understand that's awful but God said he's a restorer God said I can have it so let's take the land you following me constant positive they're pointing this out they're pointing that out but he's constant positive and now I want you to watch the Lord's attitude towards them versus Caleb this is in numbers 14:23 and the Lord says surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoke me see it but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will I bring into the land wherein to he went and his seed shall possess it I want to ask you a question at this point right here has Caleb possessed it no had he possessed it when he said let's go take it let's bring it down are you already healed have you already been delivered no but the word says I am the word says I am the word says I can have it so I'm going to say like Caleb I'm going to have it let's go take it let's go cake it and the Lord says there and goes because my servant had a different spirit because he had a right confession because he was positive because he said I can have it I'm going to give it to him and I'm going to bless him and I'm I'm going to renew right now my Covenant with you and say those that have held the word who have stood for truth who wasn't back down you're going to take a Rapture you're going to get it I promise you're going to have it Hallelujah it wasn't even manifested yet he was just testifying what the word said and because of his testimony the Lord confirms it to him now you can stand to your feet with me as we read one last scripture but I want you to watch it's not just a promise although we count his promises as good as done there's a manifestation there's a posit there's a promise then there's a positive confession then he reconfirms the promise and then there's a manifestation I want us to watch this because in judges it talks about the failure of them to complete the conquest and I want you to notice the same people who had failed to go over before once they get over are still failing to complete the conquest they still never conquered they're still failing and the scripture says Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites neither did Manasseh neither did Ephraim neither did Zebulon and they gave Hein unto Caleb as Moses said in my favorite part my favorite part you remember that thing that they said the reason we can't go we can't go because they're sons of anac Caleb said I'm going to deal with them first the very first thing he did you said I can't devil watch this you said I was never going to possess it watch this you said I couldn't be healed watch this you said I could never have my children watch this you said I'd never take a body change and he expelled this the three sons of anoch this is your champion and he's going down oh this is the one you lifted up as to why I couldn't possess the land but I'm taking him down first thing right now what is it in your life temper what is it pride what is it a a crutch and he says you'll never change I say tonight you take it down the thing you thought you had me with on this night I ended on this day I'm claiming my mountain on this day I'm progressing on this day I'm taking another step on this day I'm going further why cuz I've been called out to conquer you're called out to conquer church I just want to encourage you to keep walking keep going he says oh let's just go forward following the steps of our great leader and Conquer it remember God told Joshua every place The Souls of your footsteps that's possession brother than footsteps means possession let's just keep walking and into the promised land Not Looking Back to see what happened back there what somebody else is doing keep your eyes on Jesus the Joshua the leader just keep moving on deeper depths higher Heights until you possess everything that God promised you in his word evening light let's keep walking let's keep progressing let's keep taking other steps oh trials are going to come tribulations are going to come you're called out to conquer it you're called out to make it take another step tonight cast down your crutch cast down your bitterness cast down unforgiveness cast down your failures oh but I don't got much to offer tonight brother Aon he don't need much he don't need much David conquered with a slingshot you talk about someone with complexes his daddy didn't even invite him when the prophet came to anoint a king he's like you stay away he could have been bitter his brothers didn't even want him at the Battle said what are you here for get away from us you talk about complexes but he came to Conker Samson had the Jawbone of a donkey shamgar failed Time After Time After Time After Time failure failure couldn't even provide for his family give up fall down get up fall down but one day he decided today I'm going to conquer and what he have he have a big weapon nope Ox go Moses was loaded with complexes I can't even speak I'm slow of tongue I'm not eloquent God just wiped away all his complexes say what's in your hand he asked him what's in your hand stick but when he yielded it to him he tore down the most powerful Kingdom in the world so I want to ask you what's in your hand the most powerful message that has ever struck the face of the Earth two-edged sword came down into the hand of a prophet oh brother Aaron that wasn't for me that was for the prophet no no no Moses got the tablets for Israel but they belong to Israel you understand yeah the sword was put in his hand but that's your sword that's your word that's your message that's your promise now if they shook kingdoms and killed thousands with slingshots and Ox goats and a rod what are we going to do with the King sword in our hand I say possess it tonight with a hand of faith and go out and Conquer The Devil conquer your sit situations conquer everything that lays before you every stronghold tear it down every demon cast it out lay yourself open and say Lord use me mold me
