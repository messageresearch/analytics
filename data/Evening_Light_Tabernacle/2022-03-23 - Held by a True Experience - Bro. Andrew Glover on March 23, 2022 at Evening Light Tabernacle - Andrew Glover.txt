to believe the message free to go in a rapture it's a perfect loosening here this evening we've been set free by the grace of god amen amen god richie bless you this evening amen i believe he's here tonight don't you amen i don't just believe he's here i know he's here because we're two or three are gathered together he said there i'll come and be in their midst and there's more than two or three here tonight there's a house full of believers here this evening i know all things are possible tonight to them that believe you know the glorious thing about it is you may not feel free right now and in reality you may not even be free right now but there's a promise by the end of this service you can be set free as a matter of fact you're already free right now somebody asked brother branham one time said brother brown lay your hands on me and set me free he said i can't do that because you're already free he said the only thing i can do is join my faith with you and release a revelation that you'll receive what christ done for you 2000 years ago if you're sick tonight you're already healed if you're bound tonight you're already delivered christ done it 2000 years ago then the victory tonight is accepting what he's already done for you amen let's just buy our heads together for a word of prayer and let's just invite him to come now and you just invite him to your pew to speak to you personally tonight heavenly father lord it is an honor and a privilege to be gathered in your house once again lord we're not gathered here tonight for just another service lord we've not gathered here for just another gathering or just to fulfill a religious duty the lord we're here tonight because there is a deep calling to the deep and lord your word said at the noise of thy water spouts lord you would cause there to come and answer now tonight father there's many here before me tonight lord we've just come out of the youth camp there and father i know there was many needs met the lord we stand here tonight as a needy people father lord and i'm asking you to come by this way once more tonight dear god father as we feel your presence moving throughout the building lord we're asking you to come now in the preaching of your word father may you take preeminence of both speaker and hear lord may you drive out every unbelief in the spirit every demon they would try to hinder this meeting in any way oh god father may the angels that if lord as your prophet taught us it would lead us to the place you would have us to even sit father may those angels now come in the spiritual warfare push back against every tiredness and push back against every weariness father that your children could come forth in victory tonight father there's many needs lord many sicknesses throughout the land but tonight god we're resting in the promise that greater is he that is in us than he that is in the sickness that would be trying to destroy us or one of your believers father i pray tonight lord for our sister james they're at home dear god in our assembly father you see what she's battling in her body tonight i pray lord you would reach down and touch your lord father for brother ron spencer lord all the all the miracles you brought him through father we're standing tonight shoulder to shoulder lord and we're putting our flag upon that promise of healing as it were

impossible lord we just ask you to move among us in a special way we commit ourselves to your service tonight in the lovely name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers says amen amen god richly bless you this evening if you have your bibles while you're standing with us we'll invite you this afternoon to the book of john we want to look at john the sixth chapter and we want to greet you the seat in the name of the lord we sure counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you all once again and just coming out of the youth camp there in oklahoma and had another a wonderful time together in the presence of the lord and brother andrew spencer myself minister in there and the lord sure used brother andrew in a special way and to minister to many needs and we just thank the lord for the bride's revival amen and we sure appreciate brother tim and his confidence to stand here tonight and to minister to you and brother timothy and the church here and all the ministers we say god bless them and want to greet you for brother sean martin and the church at home sean said to be sure and tell everybody hello for him so we want to do that this evening and i'm glad to have my wife here with me this evening and we're as i've most of you probably heard but she's expecting our first baby we'll be doing august so we're very excited about that and looking forward to that so amen lord willing there'll be three glovers next time amen so amen god bless you this evening the book of john the sixth chapter i want to look in the 66th verse i know it's a very familiar reading to you in john 6 and verse 66 the bible here says from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him i don't find myself in that category then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away but then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go for thou hast the words of eternal life and i love the next words here and we believe and are sure there is no guessing there is no possibility we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god and jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil he spake of judas iscariot of the son of simon for it was he that should betray him being one of the twelve amen we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon from those passages of scripture i'd like to by the help of the lord to minister to you tonight for just a few moments here if i would title this thought tonight i want to speak to you on we are held by a true experience we are held by a true experience how many believers do we have here tonight they're real christians real holy ghost-filled believers we are held by a true experience and i know that you know these uh thoughts very well but the prophet of god tells us that there's actually uh two types of christianity he says one is an intellectual or a mental conception he said but the other is an experimental experience now both uh exp both types of christianity will only hold a certain class of people and i don't believe tonight that we are intellectual or mental christians i believe we are the ones that are experimental experienced christians when we sing we know what we're singing about when we pray we know who we're praying to when we preach we know what we're preaching about we know who we are tonight by the word now we find this land a foundation that an experimental experience uh actually comes by having an experience with the person of the word not just holding the bible or being around the message but actually having contact with the person of the word in the book of john the first chapter the first verse it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now if you skip down to the 14th verse it says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth in that in that beautiful amen full of grace and truth now the prophet of god says it this way he says the true word comes to the true prophet how many will agree we're following a true prophet who brought the true word the true word comes to the true prophet and he tells you the true word and you follow that true word and you get a true experience of the word if you follow the true word you're going to get a true experience of the word because the word is made flesh in you and you become god's son and the word of god is revolving right out of you because you are of his nature his spirit is in you and the works of god you will do let me let me read that again if you follow that true word then you will get a true experience of the word because the word will be made flesh in you you will become god's son and the word of god is revolving right out of you of god into you because you are of his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of god i don't believe that's just limited to a preacher i don't believe that's just limited amen to the prophet but i believe every true believer who is following the true word amen has a right to receive a true experience of that true word now you know as well as i know that we're not following any kind of message amen but we're following a restoration message which means amen that god has restored all the loose sins to the church whatever has been lost amen through denominationalism through organizations through the dark ages whatever was lost to the church has now been restored to the church and i'll say it like this amen i believe the message restored the true doctrine to the church i believe it restored how we should baptize and how we should conduct services and how we should rest and amen the truth of predestination i believe the word amen has restored all those doctrines to the church but at the same time amen i believe the word has restored a true experience to the church amen i know many people when you start talking about experience the first quote they go to is where the prophet of god set away with experience and i'll agree he said that amen but he said away with experience as the plumb line of the church and back to the word amen but if you're following the word then you're going to have an experience with the word and the word experience is what's going to keep you amen you realize that there's nobody in the bible that overcame but what had an experience apostle paul the prophet said he knew he had an experience he said here is another good lesson for us that experience alone isn't enough it's got to be experienced according to the word of the lord so you see him this knowing that it was a great something then somebody else had received it before him he took three years and six months down in the desert in arabia taking the bible as it was then the old testament he said and going down there to compare this experience that he had to see if it was scriptural so paul was not just looking for any kind of experience he was looking for a word experience but he was wanting something that matched the bible he said what if he said well i guess that was just a little blow over and went on i'm going to follow my intellect now he had to become a prisoner to something he'd become a prisoner so after comparing it and seeing no wonder he could write the book of hebrews in a type three years and half down there laying in the word and finding out very god that called him was talking him back amen think about this the very god that called him was taken him back and was changing all of his intellects changing all that he ever thought all that he had trained to be all of his ambitions just wiped it away from him and he became a prisoner the love of god had been so tremendous and such a revelation that he could not get away from it now there is a true experience amen is when something comes into your life amen that no matter what you go through no matter what you face no matter what situation arises amen it will never get away from you amen amen you may get away from it but it'll never get away from you he said that's the true experience of a real believer who meets god you come in contact with something that's so great that you become a prisoner to everything else you get away from everything to imprison yourself to this now amen i know that we're living in a day and time when there's such a falling away the prophet of god would say this way we find today that there's such a fallen away it seems to be that people are not interested like they used to be he said they're falling away from the fundamental facts of the bible he said they seem to be drifting into the sad thing that we're living in a day and time when we're this close to the rapture amen and people are throwing in the towel and giving up isn't it a sad time when we're this close to ain't been to the future home and the millennium of the church amen that people are growing weary and they're walking away and there's a question that always comes up when you hear that somebody is left is why did they leave how could they do that amen can i give you the answer it's because they never had a true word experience amen amen if you get a true word experience and a believer amen the red sea can't take it out of them even the lines then can't take it out ever amen amen the walls of jericho can't take it out of listen friends we are not here amen it's just a bunch of worked up emotional people amen we are here as real believers who have who have met god on the sacred sands we we have met more than a picture we have met more than amen a youth camp experience we have met the person of the word and he has quickened something in our hearts amen i'll sit like this you can live in church amen and there's many people living in church today that still don't have an experience the prophet said such a penny today to see men and women who have lived in church and been brought up in this cradle amen and knows the bible well but has never experienced amen or witnessed an experience with god what we need is to get back to real heartfelt experience amen to know who you've got faith in amen not in some writing but the true and living god amen who lives now amen let me ask you amen where did your experience place your faith did you experience place your faith in the pastor did you experience place your faith in the church did your experience place your faith in a prophet alone amen if it's a real word experience amen it will place your faith back in the word and the word says heaven earth will pass away amen but my word shall never pass away well we might as well go ahead and tell the devil there are some believers on the earth tonight amen who can no more die than god can die amen because they receive more than a feeling they have received more than an emotion they have received more than a religious education they have received a witness on the inside of their souls by the baptism of the holy ghost amen therefore tonight we're not following a bunch of intellectuals we are following a bible experience amen can i can i lay a few quotes here to lay a foundation he said what we need today is a good old time saint paul's revival and the bible holy goes back in the church again amen there's so much of this wishy washy carrying on in the name of christianity taken away he said here it is as crippled as the church is education's not your crutch your faith is your crutch that's right education will never do it denomination will never do it there'll never be an organization ever substitute amen the upper room experience amen there'll never be a school take the place of pentecost it cannot be not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord that's what we need today is back to the bible experience amen christians that are born again that are washing the blood of god made white regenerated twice what the world needs today is a revival an old-time revival the kind that saint paul had in about 80 66 amen then we don't need a revival of emotion we don't need a revival of a sensation we need a word revival now amen i'm this close to the devil so i might as well cut his head off amen when people hear you say that they say well then let's have a revival without emotion amen but how can god come in the midst of a bunch of people that has been born again by the blood that has been filled by the power of god and there not be some kind of reaction to an action listen friends i hope you'll understand when you see somebody that's really had a word experience when the songs begin to be sung and they begin to stand up and express themselves they're not doing that because it's an emotion they're doing that because the person who they're singing about they have met and then the person when the word is being preached and something moves over to stand up and say amen they're not doing that to get attention they're not doing that to be emotional they're doing that they've been because there's something inside of them amen that is connected with the word they're here what are you saying i'm saying like this the prophet said amen that there were mysteries that were laying in this bible that would be to reveal but they have been hid since before the foundation of the world then do you realize what was on the inside of you there was a gene seed of god laying there from before the foundation of the world listen friends if anybody's got a righteous child it's the bride of jesus christ you say why we gotta write a shout i'll tell you why amen because the mysteries that have been hid since before the foundation of the world amen have found a soul that was predestinated from before the foundation of the world to believe what has been hidden from before the foundational world listen friends may i say it like this you are the place that eternity has met again even the eternal word has made an eternal seed and there ain't no stopping it now there ain't no turning around now there ain't no giving up now there ain't no backing off the message now come on we're not come here ain't meant to come up against some little devil back up we are not a bunch of denominational christians we are perseverant they've been pursuing christians we have got to go and the grave is not our goal the sky is our goal amen hell is not our destination eternity is our destination that we are not persevered by a feeling we're not persevering by service we're persevering by a true word by a true prophet in the age we're living and listen friends it's time to take inventory of your experience now i'm just going to lay some word here for a second amen because if your experience only holds from one youth camp to another amen something's going to take you out if your experience only holds as long as the pastor's in town something's going to take you out but if your experience goes beyond the surface of the flesh and goes beyond the surface of the spear and that experience is in your soul amen you might as well tell hell to get used to me until i'm translated because i'm going to be here i'm not backing up i'm not turning around i'm not going nowhere there is a connection that has come from an unseen dimension into the depths of my soul it's the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride listen friends we can't turn around we came back up now it's our season to persevere it's our hour to pursue it's our hour to overcome it's our age to believe him we're not following any kind of word we are following a true word that has produced a true experience he said oh what we need today amen in this country when gross darkness thank you this country when gross darkness is covering the world he said why is that happening because they have rejected the gospel he said each one of us should take inventory of our own experience in our own standings with god and see how we stand in his sight paul says it this way therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin paul would say in colossians 1 21 and you that were sometimes alienating enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now somebody shout now yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and inflammable and unreprovable in his sight paul would say in hebrews 13 21 that he would make you perfect in every good work amen to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen i love this one whatsoever we ask we receive of him first john 3 22 whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his side amen now i'm just glad to preach a little bit if that's okay amen the bible says you got to have an experience now there's there's an all-out attack against people who actually believe in a holy ghost experience but the bible says amen the reason why they're seeing the things they're seeing is because they're doing the things god requires to be done if you're killing the move of god and killing the atmosphere the holy ghost amen don't get mad at somebody to give the holy ghost to right away amen because this is the season for the holy ghost to come in the church listen we've had enough men performers on the pulpit we've had enough preachers personalities it's time to let the holy ghost come in the church and the holy ghost said if you'll preach the word he'll follow the word and if you follow the true word you'll get a true experience come on friends we're not worked up we're following a true word that is releasing a true experience upon us i love that word experience it means a practical contact or observation with facts or events it is an event or an occurrence amen that leaves an impression on someone it is an encounter or to undergo an event in other words an experience happens when contact is made without contact there'll be no experience without contact there'll be no change without contact there'll be nothing put inside of you and it'll cause you to hold out but if contact is made even an experience will take place what happens is an experience leaves an impression have you ever seen something and you said i'll never forget that have you ever been somewhere and seen something and you said i'll never forget that do you know why you said that it's because there was something there that impressed you you underwent a feeling or something that impressed you to cause you to never forget that and the prophecy this way he said tonight we're going to read some of god's word and be ready for this event of his presence again amen to bring us his word see then the presence of god amen brings a change when you've got the true word of god amen is this okay he said if a man is sin of god he'll stay with the word because god can only be sent by his word he must stay by his word then when we come into his presence when a man once comes in the presence of god he is changed forever if there's any changing to him when a man once comes in the presence of god he's changed forever if there's any change unto him want to go the bible let's go there was a man named moses who came in the presence of god and he went from being a runaway prophet to being the mighty deliverer of the seed of god there was a man named jacob who was running from his father amen but he met an angel and he underwent an encounter with the angel and something happened to him amen that when he got up he didn't walk the same he didn't talk the same now there are those who can walk in the presence of god and pay no attention it's because they're not ordained alive but if he was predestined of god as soon as it first hits he knows it then it catches fire listen young people what god has done for you has not come from an emotion it has not come from a sensation it has not come from some man's idea what god has done for you has come from his word and there's a fire inside of you i'm on church i know the bible says there's an unquenchable fire in hell amen but let's not leave that on the negative side amen let's bring it to the positive if there's an unquenchable fire in hell then there's an unquenchable fire in this church and it's not coming from a man it's not coming from the system it's coming from the word listen i'll tell you what if you'll preach this message the holy ghost will come down and he'll set somebody on fire and people will show up just to watch the church burn i say what we need is to let the holy ghost amen set our preachers on power let the holy ghost set our singers on power let the holy ghost set our musicians on time let the holy ghost set the church on time it's been a long time amen since some of you have felt any power hey remember let me just tell you the fire hadn't gone out it's still burning as hot as it ever did what happened was you got a little bit cold and let the devil picture fire but there's some believers here tonight who has been lit by an unquenchable fire it's the pillar of power and it'll take him to every trouble it'll take him to every danger through many dangerous calls and stairs we have already come by the grace of god are you hearing me tonight i don't know where the glasses went but that's okay are you hearing me tonight it's an unquenchable fire amen your feelings can't put it out amen that's what i'm talking about they met an unquenchable fire you can bring it into cold service when there's all kinds of pressures and all kinds of weird feelings and just let the holy ghost get to pulsate and before long somebody will break out and say amen and somebody else will raise their hand and somebody else will begin to worship what is it it's an unquenchable power that has come from a true word experience that has released you to worship god regardless of the condition when you have had a true experience you will live a different life the product of god said you could say well this changed me brother aunt brother branham he said look when he comes in his presence we're changed never to be the same again you look all down to the ages and you'll see when a man come in the presence of god he was changed forever look at abraham he was chained forever well brother branham this is just for the ministers oh no the change to life is for everybody come on help me preach it i the change life is for everybody to change life is not just for the preacher but change life is not just for the pastor the change life is for everybody amen everybody under the sound of this message can live a changed life then what is the power ain't meant to bring a change the prophet said when a man comes in contact with god his maker it changes the whole attitude it changes his mental it changes his habit it changes his body it changes his nature it changes everything then when the word changes that man it releases something in him what i will call an enduring experience the bible says in hebrews 11 amen that by faith he which was moses amen for sick egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible you know what that word endured means it means to be steadfast so whatever happened to moses in the presence of god whatever happened to abraham in the presence of god whatever happened amen to to paul in the presence of god it released the stability it released the steadfastness now i know there's people say well people are in the spirit and there's never no change why do we always look at the negative amen i know there's been people that shouted that really wasn't changed i know there's been people that's danced that really wasn't changed but what about the ones that were changed what about the ones that did get something what about the ones that did break through they mentioned more than just a youth camp to more than just the winston that service i'll tell you where they are they're still standing they're not standing by their power they're not standing by their mind they're standing by the true word amen see abraham received an enduring experience which caused him to rest upon the promise for 25 years he said how little it was for abraham that after he endured as seeing him who was invisible how after he met god and had an experience of talking face to face with god that he could call those things which was not as though they were and he could call those things which were so they're not he said for he had talked to god face to face that's what we need is a personal experience with the living god well brother andrew is that possible amen it's very possible because what happens is when the personal experience comes in the church it burns out all the dullness you see sometimes you can get dull of hearing you can get dull of sin you can get dull of believing the bible said that the people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of here and their eyes they have clothes but at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them so a true experience produces a conversion where does this conversion come from amen it can be a same old man living in the same old house wearing the same old clothes looking the same away but if something has come on the inside of him he can be in the same flesh wearing the same clothes but he can be changed forever in the presence of god oh god listen friends i know there's people amen i'll tell like this a young lady told me one time she'd come to a youth camp i was ministering she come in that youth camp she had always been raised in the message always been in church but it never been able to release herself in the presence of god she would go to church both grandfathers were pastors but she come in the service one night and i was ministering a thought amen on a change and when i was preaching about a change something struck her i never seen her do it before but she ran across the front of the church like that i thought that's very odd for that young lady to be doing that she went back home and her mom and daddy didn't even know who she was her grandfather who was her pastor didn't even know who she was i said what do you mean they said there had been such a change over her they said the first service she was back she wanted to sing a special he said we never could get her to sing we wanted she wanted to testify we never could get her to testify listen friends even though you don't see the change it doesn't mean that a change has not taken place oh god friends listen we're living in the hour where changes are taking place while the word is being preached amen you may not see it but right now cancers are having to back up at the word of god you may not see it amen but demon strongholds are having to give way to the power of the word of almighty god it don't matter what condition your flesh is in if the word has preeminence amen the word brings the change and if the word brings a change in the church it'll be a true change it's gonna be a change it'll be a change of heart not the physical thing but the heart of the soul it's something anchors you to your thoughts this way is dull and you don't see that no more you just see the lord you just see his righteousness and holiness and purity and love and grace that's when you've been changed what does it mean to convert it means to change something over amen and your thoughts and your habits and your being has been changed your thoughts and your habits and your being and your nature has been changed amen from a sinner to a christian the first thing you know it in your heart then you express it with your lips and then it materializes that's what you are listen friends amen you know it in your heart so therefore something comes across your lips and you begin to bless the lord you begin to worship his name and something begins to materialize well around that promise can i preach for a minute amen what about what about our young sister who came up for prayer in the prayer line a few years ago for her brother justin to come back to god it was in her heart that god could do it and she spoke it across her lips that god could do it amen and it wasn't five years it wasn't two years it was just a few moments and what had happened in her heart had been spoken across her lips had materialized before your very eyes listen friends we're living in the hour where the miraculous is becoming material in the church of living god we ain't got to back up and wait for god to materialize his promises elohim has come down in this generation to make good every promise he has made the church oh brother andrew it's not essential to believe that things can materialize it's very essential to believe things can materialize amen it's very essential to believe that the holy ghost can still get prodigals it's very essential to believe that the holy ghost can still heal cancer it's very essential to believe that the holy ghost can still erase cars it's very essential to believe that the holy ghost can still change young people it's very essential to believe even that the supernatural can come into a meeting and can change your life in five minutes and it'll be changed forever it's very essential to believe that god is still god and his word is still true and his power is still here and his anointing is still among us to bless us all it may not be essential to an intellectual christian but it is very essential to an experimental holy ghost field fire baptized tongue talking vision sin message preaching son of god it's the essentials it's the essentials of the church come on now i don't know if the holy ghost is essential the prophet said it's absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the holy ghost for if you don't then you cannot come in the resurrection well brother andrew i believe the message that's got to be enough that's not enough to see the end time message you must have a true experience see god has called us somebody shout god has called us to be witnesses in the age we're living god has never been without a witness he has always had at least one man he could put his hands on and say that's my witness see somebody is going to witness for god somewhere oh glory somebody is going to witness for god somewhere somebody is going to receive a real change and they're not going to be ashamed to witness in their hospital they're not going to be ashamed to witness in their church they're not going to be ashamed to witness in their school somebody is going to meet god's requirement to be a witness which is an experience what does acts 1 8 say ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be my witnesses i love this word witness it means a martyr it means a witness sense in a legal sense it is those who after his example have proved the strength and genuineness of their faith in christ amen by undergoing a violent death see then the spiritual application of that definition is a new birth is a death a new birth is a death i hope it's okay a new birth is a death that's why jesus would say except the corn of wheat fall in the ground amen and die it abideth alone but if it what if it die it bringeth forth much fruit any birth is a mess if it's in a pig pen if it's in a barnyard if it's in a pink hospital room it'll it'll be a mess it'll do things that you wouldn't think you would do oh but you know before you can be born you have to die and some people die awful hard some people die awful hard they kick and they bawl and they scream and carry on but unless a corn of wheat dies and falls in the ground it abides alone if you want to bring forth fruit die to yourself your own man may theology and be born again in the spirit and resurrection get rid of that old self-righteousness and dryness that's in you and take on the new life see that when what god requires amen is the sound of death god does not require amen our abilities he requires the cell to death it's in the bible that there were two men who went to the same temple to pray one of them was a publican and the other one was a pharisee the bible says the pharisee come in the temple and begin to rehearse to the lord everything he had done i've done this and i've done that and i've done this he said but then the man left there amen the same way he came but the republican came in and he got down before god and he said i don't have anything good to bring you i don't have any good thing to offer you and the bible says that man left the house of god justified and the other man left in another condition well if the republican left justified pray tell me what condition the pharisee left him i'll tell you what kind of condition he left him he left in a dignified condition because his pappy is the father of all dignity but we're not a bunch of dignified believers we are justified believers who have been justified by the faith of jesus christ and the sounds of death that come out of our lives we have died the old man and the new man has been born he said oh bless god what god wants today is you to die amen die to the things of this world and yourself and hear a scream lord take me as i am that's what god wants he wants the sound of death that death rather of an old man adam that's dying amen he might come in and take his place and rule you and live in you do you realize just anybody cannot come in and be a real witness of god you've got to be selected to be a witness the bible says to be a witness for the lord you've actually got to know something i'm turning the corner here if that's okay to be a witness for god you've actually got to know something look at daniel 11 32 it says as such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt my flatteries i love this but the people that do know their god shall be weak and not be able to overcome and have to lay down to every devil and have no power over diseases that's not what my bible reads my bible says they shall be strong and do great exploits that word no means to know by experience then whoever daniel 11 32 is talking about is not intellectual christians it's not mental conception christians it is experimental experienced christians that know god beyond the realms of education they know him by the power of his resurrection look at somebody and say i know him do you know him i know him do you know him no i'm not talking about how many scriptures you got memorized do you know him i'm not talking about how many quotes you got memorized do you know him to know by experience i love this one to be acquainted with the prophet said when a man is really born again of the spirit of god he becomes acquainted a personality of god is in him and he knows he's going from the ridiculous to the sublime another place he says go get acquainted with god and you'll see his nature you'll see him in the sunset you'll see him in the flowers you'll see him all around you because he is all around you that gives you perfect confidence that you're in love with him and he's in love with you he loves you he predestinated you he for ordained you before the world began and brought you here and saved you and clenched you up and filled you with the spirit well how could you have any doubts that gives you a perfect settling faith when you know the things that gives you courage you know where you're standing then let me preach to you for a minute it's time to quit being scared in his presence it's time to quit being fearful in his presence it's time to quit being timid in his presence if you know who you are and you know who he is amen that he has released their confidence in you ain't been to stand as a real believer with an assurance and a perfect selling faith listen friends how many need something from god tonight how many's got a petition how many's got a desire a healing whatever you need let me tell you what a prophet said he said it's a spiritual revelation amen it's after you become acquainted with god that you could take his word for anything when you become acquainted with god it does not matter the conditions regardless of the conditions you can take god and his word for anything it doesn't matter if you're on fire or if you're cold it doesn't matter if you feel him or if you don't when you know him by the word brother derek you can ask in his name and you'll receive in his name and there's no devil big enough ain't meant to hinder the god of heaven from fulfilling the promises of his word come on friends it's time to quit backing up to the devil amen and saying well i don't know maybe someday i say today is the day quit putting these things in the future we're not going to need healing in the millennium we need it right now we're not going to need to cast out devils in the millennium we're going to need to do it right now then while there's power to do it while there's faith to operate it let the sons and daughters of god arise and accept the challenge that the devil has put against the church by the baptism of the holy ghost and their soul i'll say it like this satan has done everything he could to stop this from coming to pass he does not want a people on the earth who is acquainted with the living god he does not want a church in minden louisiana who is acquainted with the living god he does not want a ministry that is acquainted with the living god he does not want a young person who is acquainted with the living god but i want to tell the devil it's too late i've already met him it's too late he's already told me he loved me it's too late he's already seen me he's already chose me he's already clenched me he's already filled me he's already given me divine promises he's already revealed himself to me he's already said he would never leave me he would never forsake me he would be with me always he's already said if you battle me and my word in you that ask what you will there is a pride on the earth tonight who is acquainted with the god of abraham isaac and jacob among friends and we're not just acclaiming with him we're on speaking terms with him we can talk to him and he'll talk back we can begin to praise his name and begin to bless his name and he'll come down in the sanctuary and inhabit the praises of his people there is a people who is going to fulfill the prophecy that the devil's tried to squash there is a people who is going to overcome the devil of dignity they're going to deny the devil of coldness they're going to deny the devil of unbelief and they're going to rise in the power of the holy ghost and be a witness that god fulfills his word amen you believe that god fulfills his word can i preach to you for a second god fulfills his word regardless of the conditions are you hearing me god fulfills his word regardless of the condition it's been something i haven't been able to get away from for a while after reading the quote he said the word of god will defeat the devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition he said if it's an alliance then the world will defeat him there if it's in a hospital bed laying there with cancer the world will defeat him there he said you can be laying in an automobile accident they've been bleeding to death and the word of god will defeat the devil right there now come on church those are some pretty tough conditions those are some pretty harsh conditions you imagine laying in an automobile accident and the blood leaving your body and you still got the authority to cast out the devil brother madam said that about the year brother philip of 1958 do you realize what happened in 1965 a prophet's words come to pass in his own life he's laying on the highway in texas amen the blood is running out of his body brother billy runs up there and says daddy are you okay he says daddy amen sarah's back is broke or he says daddy he says are you okay rebrand stops and says where's sarah other man said like this where's my where's sarah i heard the testimony of the day he said brother billy looked around and said she's right here he said lay my hand on her he said why daddy he said because her back is broke there's a prophet of god in an automobile accident the blood leaving his body but the gift of discernment is still flowing because it's not based upon emotion it was not based upon an intellectual conception it was based upon a true experience that no matter where you put this word it'll work oh god no matter where you put this word it'll work you can put it in a hospital it'll work there you can put it in the lines then it'll work there you can put it amen you can put it in the graveyard i'm on now church amen we buried some loved ones that are laying in the graveyard tonight their bodies are but let me say this you can put them in the deepest darkest crave but if the word is there you cannot stop the word the word will work regardless of the conditions hormones hurts you can bury them in the deep iceland you can put them in the jungles and i'm on friends there is our believers amen who were eaten by lines and were done away with through the waste of those animals but some morning between six and nine they're going to come back together i'll tell you why because the word works regardless it doesn't matter the condition it doesn't matter the situation the word will overcome the devil anywhere anytime anyplace under any condition well we're not in a lion's den tonight we're not in a hospital bed tonight we're not in automobile accidents with the blood flowing from our body but we are in the house of god and we've got mighty needs among us let me say this right here tonight on wednesday nights the same word that worked for daniel we'll work for lemur the same word that worked for jonah will work for aaron the same words that work for moses will work for andrew it is a word that works regardless of the conditions you put the word anywhere you want to and it's going to work oh come on friends i'm going somewhere if you get a true word experience you will be following a true word and the word will be made flesh that's why the devil don't want you to become the word because wherever you are the limits are taken off of god and the word has the ability to work now don't don't let the devil tell you well i got to be something special amen i've got to be in some terrible condition the word works right here he said the devil has done everything he can to stop this little church and this little flock from rising up and fulfilling the words he said see the devil wants them to be powerless he said but i'll say this he said there would be and there will be a people who will know their god and will be strong in the last days see then i'll sit like this we are not eyewitnesses we're not just ear witnesses we are heart witnesses amen we have come to the promise of the holy ghost now let me just say this many people today have two different kinds of experiences one of those experiences is a natural experience can i tell you what a natural experience is amen it's not enough but the other experience is a spiritual supernatural experience and it is more than enough do you realize what a church experience is it's a natural experience you can get an experience with the church and it will only hold you for so long look what jesus said he said no man puts new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst and the bottles be spilled and the bottle shall perish amen the bible says amen that this bride will not perish amen then that tells me there's got to come a change in order to hold what will come into you and it will not burst and perish he said that's the way you take the baptism of the holy ghost put it in an old dry formal cow hide it'll blow up as sure as the world but you try to take the baptism of the holy ghost with an old experience of some long drawn out church experience it'll blow up as sure as the world amen but new wine said jesus amen all goes in new bottles and the new bibles is flexible that's the way god's church must be for revival it's flexible well brother andrew glory to god i'm ready for the bride's revival and you get mad and blow up because somebody got your parking spot well i'm ready for the bride's revival and you're mad because somebody didn't shake your hand well but then i'm ready for the bride's revival and brother tim ain't called me in six weeks and he ain't called my name behind the pulpit in two years and you're ready for the bride's revival that is no condition to carry the most i'm on church you you know what kind of people you got to be you got a people that be that can take a licking and keep right on ticket they can take your parking spots they can take your favorite seats they cannot call your name for two years they can forget you even attend the church but you'll say i'm not here because brother tim called my name i'm not here because i got a good parking spot i'm here because before the foundation of the world he put my name on the lamb's book of life come on church you mean to tell me that somebody taking your seat is going to cause you to turn around we need some rugged warriors we need some believers that'll stand up and say i'll fight the good fight of faith if i got to fight in the parking lot and i got to fight it by myself i am not a weak christian i am a rugged christian i can take a look and you can offend me and i'll keep on going you can hurt my feelings and i'll keep brother tim you can ignore me for two whole years and i still pray the holy ghost will anoint you to whip every devil this time in mississippi i'm on church i'm not talking about a bunch of people it's just pawn somewhere i'm talking about true words true experienced christians that no matter what conditions you put them under they're going to worship god they're going to praise god they're going to bless his name they're going to lift the raptures off the house and let a wasp in time world know there's a people here who knows him in the power of this resurrection regardless of what we're going through regardless of who hurt our feelings we know who we are come on church over there ain't nobody hurt my feelings we'll stick around a few days and they'll get hurt we're humans but i'm asking you are you in a position not with god to say god i'm here for the fact i'm here to fight i'm here to push through yes sir you've got to be flexible brother andrew surely surely a a church experience is good enough no sir because the prophet of god said that the rich young ruler had a good church experience he said but the problem was he lacked a personal experience with jesus christ he said his mother mother was a good mother his father was a good father and he knowed the bible real well but he lacked something that was able to hold him you realize what the prophet says he says see it must be a supernatural experience amen can i preach a little bit what does paul say he said that i may know him somebody shall know him no shout out like you're a true experienced believer i may know him i may know him and the power of the resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto death so paul here is saying i'm not just an experienced christian that knows him in the power of his resurrection but let me know him in the power of his sufferings i love this word no it means to perceive it means to understand it's what gets me to the greeks it means to know facts but those facts may or may not affect one's conduct but to the jews i love this to the jews true knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct one did not know something until that fact had a practical outworking in his life so in other words it had to make an 18-inch trip from his head to his heart the greeks could know it in their head and it never affect their conduct but to the jews when they really knew what they were talking about it had changed more than the way they think and it changed more than the way they thought and it changed the way they conducted themselves in other words you could put them in a trial and they would still conduct themselves with joy amidst that trial you could put them on a partly cloudy sunny day that's i might as well preach up here joe asked me the day at camp he said what's weather gonna be like tomorrow that's what's gonna be partly clear cloudy and partly cloudy and sunny it's gonna be cloudy and sunny he said how can it be cloudy and sunny at the same time i said i mean it's going to be partly cloudy and sunny at the same time listen friends you've got to quit serving god based on the conditions that's around you or you'll never have any victory you've got to serve god regardless well over there and as long as my best friend's here and they can child i'll serve god listen you've got to be able to serve god if your best friend walks away from the message you'll still be standing you've got to be able to serve god if the clouds are in the sky or if the sun is shining god is looking for somebody who will come under his word and receive a true experience let me say it like this he does not want this message to just work on tape he does not want it just to work on pictures he wants this message to find a channel to have a practical outworking in your life that's why paul would say the word of god which we received was not of men but it was of the truth amen which effectually worketh in you that believe he said see the blood of him talk like this he said there was no indian one time he said indian had two dogs he said which one do you feed the most he said whichever one i feed the most is the one that wins chief he says depend on that he said see but if you listen to the certain sound he said god's word work it in your heart you'll conquer this when he says you won't feed that black dog you'll feed the white dog he said and the certain sound will produce god working out of your heart can i read you another one in this sodom age what happened to abraham would return back again to abraham's royal seed which is in christ and christ's returning in the form of the word working in human beings and sowing the signs that he promised it would sign it would do listen friends you are the channel that god has ordained for his word to return to in the most evil conditions of seven ages and that same word have the same effect and power today that it had the day it was wrote now brother andrew i've had an experience well let's ask moses what kind he had he said moses was a god called man a prophet he said he had to have a supernatural experience so no man has a right to call himself us until he's talked face to face with god on the back side of a desert somewhere where he met god himself are you ready for this and all the atheists in the world could not explain it away from him from him he was there he knowed it happened all the atheists in the world could not explain in a way listen in other words moses could be standing at the burning bush and he'd see the thing on fire he would see it on fire and not consumed and leave the burning bush for the ale and run into one atheist and that atheist could talk him out of it he could run into another atheist and that atheist could talk now come on friends because do you realize we're living in a world where there's still atheists you say all the atheists in the world according to sociologists study i don't know these guys names but a review of numerous global studies on atheism there are 450 to 500 million positive atheist and agnostic worldwide 450 to 500 million positive agnostics and atheists in the world seven percent of the world's population with china having the most atheists in the world at 200 million amen convinced atheists brother brother timothy something strikes me there there's seven percent that are positive and there's 200 million that are convinced amen those two words where have i heard those two words before oh that's right he meant a positive experience amen a positive gospel a positive faith will produce the convinced son of god that'll be concerned what are you saying brother andrew i'm saying this if you get a true word experience in your heart you can meet all 450 to 500 million you can meet all 200 million you can meet seven percent of the world's population and they can tell you god don't do that and god don't do that no more but you would stand there and you would draw your sword and you would fight through every one of them because what you received put a confidence in you it released the faith in you to persevere towards a goal oh friends tonight what i'm trying to get at is this amen that god knew you before the foundation of the world therefore he sent you a true word that would be accompanied by a true experience that would lead you beyond the curses of your family it would lead you beyond the situations of your childhood it would bring you beyond the hope so into a no soul amen let me say this this true experience will take you beyond any shadow of doubt of missing the rapture it'll take you on any side of it out that god don't do what his word says he does anymore if it's written in his words your heart agrees with it then heaven cannot back you off of it sickness cannot back you off of it amen because the fruit of this supernatural experience is a possessor who can say i know i know a true possessor can say i know i know my redeemer liveth i know messiah's coming amen i know that he who touched my eyes amen has healed me whereas i once was blind now i see i know and those who don't know nothing about it are the ones that's going to give you the biggest fight those that don't believe god does hats are the ones that's going to give you the biggest path but can i give you something to fight with can i give you something to fight with they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony if god done something for you this weekend draw that testimony and beat that devil to a pulp and let him know i am not the same person i was when i went to camp i'm not the same young girl i'm not the same young man those demons of fear those demons of anxiety those demons of complexes they've got a goal they've got to go listen friends i believe this is the hour when god has delivered his church by a true word through a true experience amen can i testify to you for a minute can i talk to you for a second the other day up in the youth camp there in cloverdale at the end of one of the services the spirit of the lord just moved across me and i said i rebuke that inferiority complex i caused that thing to leave by the word of almighty god there was a young man come to me after service he said andrew he said for the past few months he said i'm a husband i'm a father he said but for the past few months i've been becoming a recluse he said i've been pulling away from fellowship i've been pulling away he said when i get around other believers he said i don't feel like i've got anything to add to the conversation he said i've been in a mind battle he said and i've been wondering what it is he said but god sent you all the way up here to call out what it is he said can you tell me what an inferior complex is i said it's a complex it's put upon you by a devil that makes you feel inferior to somebody else and i said we're not in fear to nobody we ever once stand level at the cross of jesus christ he said when you said that the chain of that inferiority complex broke off of my life he said all i needed was to be exposed i'm on friends we're living in the hour when the very minute the devil is exposed he has lost his hold on you the very minute the word says exposes that devil he's got to relinquish every life i'm on church you've been letting the devil hold you back for years let me say this the devil is defeated because the word has exposed that devil amen let me say this whatever god has done for you don't you back off of it don't you turn around on it amen you go light the world on fire with an experience of god jesus said you are the light of the world you're a city that sat on a hill amen the hill cannot hide neither do men light a candle and put it under the bushel amen but on a candlestick and it gave light to all that are in the house you know what that word candle means it's something that is placed on a stick or a candle stick amen it is a lamp or like an eye which shows the body which way to move amen and term it is the prophecies of the old testament insomuch as they afforded at least some knowledge relevant to the glorious return of jesus from heaven oh god i could preach here for an hour it is the old testament prophecies as they afford it at least to some knowledge relevant to the glorious return of jesus from heaven then jesus turns and says let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven fake it not strange church that god would set you on fire right before he returns think it not strange that right before he returns he would do something in your life that would lift you up above your peers it would lift you up above education it will lift you up above religion and let a lost and dying world know that there's somebody on the earth who the church cannot stop who the fellowship of the devil cannot hand hinder them because the holy spirit has made demonstration and is making the word a reality in their lives now i want i want to drive a few things home and i'm going to close the brother has asked a question do you believe that signs should follow all who have the holy spirit well jesus said so in mark 16 if so what about the people who believe the message with all that's in them yet they have not these signs are the unbelievers or do they need the holy spirit if so please instruct us today on how to receive the holy ghost we believe you're god's mouthpiece for our day he said see thank you my dear brother you cannot receive the baptism of the holy ghost without having an experience when it happens if you believe every speck of the word you say you believe that the word is laying in there waiting for the holy spirit to put it to work but it's like lighting the candle here's the candle with the wick in it and with all the tallow and everything it has to have in the candle but until the fire comes on it it will not shine any light you can have a house full of candles but if you don't have no fire amen they'll just be candles you can be in darkness you can be surrounded by darkness come on church and if you don't have some fire to set that candle on fire it'll just be a candle no matter how perfect the candle is how perfect it'll burn it's got to be lit and then it burns and when you believe and are made up of the instructions of what the holy spirit is love joy peace long suffering amen the fruits that bears out he says until the holy spirit where the fiery experience comes down and lights that candle then you haven't received the holy ghost let me say this fire puts the cannon used and without the fire the candle gives no light and without the fire the candle gives no fragrance amen the fire is what reveals the potentials of the candle oh glory to god no wonder the devil don't want you to meet the pillar of fire no wonder the devil don't want you to receive a fiery baptism of the holy ghost because when that fire strikes your life it is going to release every potential and it's on the inside of you well let me tell you what kind of potentials are in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you've got the potentials to overcome you've got the potentials to tear down you've got the potentials to cross over every bridge the devil puts it come on church you've got the potentials i say tonight what we ought to do is we ought to welcome the fire of god into the church to set the candles on fire to set the young people on fire to set the preachers on fire to set the singers on power let the holy ghost experience set the church on fire until the fire reveals the potentials that's laying in you unknown church that's why the devil wants you to remain cold because the coldness will not reveal the potentials that's why the devil wants you to remain indifferent is because the indifference will not reveal the potential that's why the devil wants you to be bound up by complexes is because the complex will never release the potential that god has put in you but if the fire ever touches you if the fire touches your life if the fire comes upon your heart if the fire comes upon your family if the fire comes upon your ministry glory to god it'll release the potentials of god oh somebody let the power of god come in the church let the fire god set the pews let the fire god set every elder on fire if the fire comes in the church the fire will reveal the potentials are you hearing me the fire will reveal the potentials you realize what else the fire will do the fire will reveal the hidden power the fire will release what's been landed i'm going you ever heard that saying get somebody in the clutch and then you'll see how they really are get somebody in the taunts touch but i heard it said like this one time amen have a whole car load full of friends amen they'll all call you their friend they may run out of gas brother phillip and see who helps you push that'll be your real friend whoever ride with you as long as the credit card's flowing and the tank is full and you're running all across town or they'll be friends but see who'll help you push are you hearing me you know what happened to john he got into a tight spot brother said he was put on the isle of patmos and they put him in grease the bullet he said what they were trying to do was they was trying to pull the testimony of jesus christ out of his life he said but what did that burn in greece do it only released the hidden power on the inside of him come on hebrew children let them fool you in the fiery furnace oh god i'm catching a second wind time to quit let them pull you in the fiery furnace you know what's going to happen they're going to put you in a furnace that's heated seven times hotter in this strange thing amen seven times hotter seven times hotter seven sec oh that's right lay out of sin church age amen seventh age where there's more darkness than there's ever been there's more pressure than there's ever been there's more there's more enticements there's more internet websites there's all kinds of things to pull you amen back from your confession pull you back from your testimony and god would put them in the fiery furnace in the darkest tower oh yes he would but here's what i love about the story amen as the fire didn't end the story the fire made the story are you hear me the fire did not end the story the fire is what made the story and whatever you're going through tonight let me speak to you by the word the fire is not the end of your story the fire is only making your story it's only producing a testimony a true experience because they were following a true word prophet glory to god hallelujah they've been filming a fiery furnace do you realize how hot that thing was do you realize how hot it was the bible says the man or the hell that took him up there and threw him in the fire he fell over dead he fell over dead and the king sent a runner up there to see what happened and the runner comes back and says sir i got up there and the three men are in there but there's something i got to tell you he said what's that he said the one you set up there's dead. he says well that don't matter just tell me what condition they're in on wednesday night after youth camp just just tell me just tell me what kind of condition tell me tell me what kind of week they've had tell me what kind of way tell me what's happened since you've they've been telling me what i know they shouted when they was in my i know they shouted before the fire i know they danced before the fire i know they confess before the tire but i want to know what's happened since they've been in a time well king all i got to say is those three men are still alive he said are they tied up he said oh no their hands are free he said their feet are free what else is going on king he said the fourth man is in the fire we only put three in then who's the fourth man he said all i can say is it is one who is like unto the son of god well come on church what was he in there doing the fourth man didn't show up just to be there brother said they were fellowshipping about their future in the fire oh god i can imagine old shadrach and meshach and abednego were shouting around the fire and all of a sudden brother joel that fourth man looked at him and said your future is clear your future is clear you're in the fire right now but don't worry you're gonna come out of time you're coming out of the pie let me tell you the same reference you're gonna whatever you're in if you're paul a true word with a true experience it'll bring you out of fire it'll bring you out of the hospital bed it'll bring you out of the lines then wherever you put this word the word will release the believer but the dale the power won't set us up persecution won't shut us up devils won't shut us up sickness won't shut us up problems won't shut us up because we've received an impression by the spirit now i gotta close here i'll preach all night an impression by the spirit you're saying impression i'm not talking about a feeling i'm talking about a heavenly impression let me ask you this brother there were 70 men and only 12 of them stayed 70 followers amen 70 young people went to youth camp come on now aiming for years young people is gone and there's only a few still here can i tell you the answer can i tell you the answer amen because some of them stayed long enough to get sealed [Applause] some of them got sealed or you hit them in church some of them got sealed said like this he said there was the seventy brother joe and they turned and walked away brother tim can you imagine they've been following him all these years and now 70 turns and walks away and there's only 12 left standing there brother else here here's what i love here's what i love and the one he looks at was the one with full of mistakes the one he asked the question was the one who made all the mistakes and all the blunders and all the failures the one who cut a man's ear off the one who was a cousin preacher the one who was out on the water fishing naked when jesus come by and then he asked peter of all people of all people they figured would be the first one to leave of all people they figured was just worked up under the influence of youth camp of all people and they looked at peter and they said peter whom do you will you go also and peter said lord to whom shall we go he said thou art the son of the living christ he said like this and we believe and are sure brethren said what happened was a revelation had come out of heaven into peter's soul he said and peter had become impressed by a heavenly revelation there was no turning him around now but i want to close by saying this if you couldn't turn peter around you can't turn andrew around if you couldn't turn peter around you won't turn joseph around if you could turn peter around you won't turn william around if you couldn't turn peter around you won't turn the ride around i'm on church we're not being held by ourselves we're being held by a heavenly revelation we're being held by a true experience with a true word let me ask you this is your impression that you've been sealed with strong enough to keep you come on i close with this brother brown said there was five boys who laid down in their beds he said every night there was a picture hung up on the wall of a ship sailing across the calm seas he said then five boys every night lay down and looked at that he said first one got old enough they went in the navy second one got old enough they went in the navy third one got old enough they went in the navy fourth one got old enough they went in the navy he said brother said they went in an investigation to see what them boys what caused them boys to go in the navy what what what what paul says because there was no overcomers i mean there was no navy men in their family what what caused them to believe because their parents didn't believe i mean there was no their parents wasn't in the military are you hearing me what caused this we want to know what caused this and they come in and did an investigation by the j in their bedroom and they decided that them boys fallen asleep every night look at that picture they said for 18 years that picture had put an impression in them to grow up and join the navy let me ask you this and i'm done can i tell you how strong that impression was that impression was so strong that when they went to boot camp and they saved their head they stayed in it when they went to the when they went to their first when they went to their first physical training day they stayed with it that impression was so strong it was able to carry them through every stage of their journey whatever come out of that picture and come into them seal them in the fact we're going all the way may i say this tonight friends this message has released a seal of the holy ghost upon the church and it's strong enough it'll get us through sickness it'll get us through we ought to see it it'll get us through temptation it'll get us through that downs it'll get us through disappointments it'll get us through difficult days this is not your experience of a church it's a true world experience and our musicians come to life this experience will hold you are you hearing me it'll hold you when the time gets hard it'll hold you when the devil tries to get you to give in it'll hold you it's a true experience by the word it'll hold you it'll hold you real andrew i'm holding on no it's holding you brother andrew i'm i'm barely hanging in there no he hung in there for you are you hearing me tonight make sure you got a true experience make sure you got something that will hold you like brother branham when he had been preaching brother said it amazed me when you hear that brother aaron he goes through there and lists all the things he'd been doing he said i've been preaching i've been praying i've been working day and night he said i've been standing the prayer lines and praying till about fell over he said i went down there and saw my wife and my baby in that condition and he said the devil come to me and reminded me of everything i did let me just say this your works ain't strong enough to hold you he said the devil come and whispered in my ear you're really going to believe him now and begin to lift up begin to list off all the things he'd been doing for him all the hours in the prayer lines and all the meetings and all the sacrifices he said i was listening to him and he said what he was saying was the truth what he was saying and he said i was just about to the point he said i was just about to point to say that's right there boy i guess he don't love me he said that he swept down glory to come he swept down and he said though you slay me yet i will trust you he said that he spoke come on friends his own abilities couldn't hold him but an experience with a true word could hold him in the darkest hour of his life and out of that trial comes some of the greatest blessings [Applause] ran into his friend afterwards and said oh billy said man i want to tell you something said that religion you got said man you held on then he said no sir it helped me [Music] hallelujah it it held me oh billy that religion you got it held you didn't no sir it held me and out of that coming testimony brother philip when he laid there and looked at his baby's eyes crossed he said ever since then i couldn't see a cross-eyed child in a prayer line without entering into compassion but what was instantly healed are you hearing me tonight make sure make sure what you got has sealed you make sure it shields you make sure it's come into you and the word is effectually working out of your life brother andrew is this seal temporary no sir it's eternal will this will this seal hold the easter camp no it'll hold the day of the rapture come on young people it's gonna be your first camp in three years and you're stronger now than you were three years ago everything you've been through brother derek and you're stronger today than you were three years ago something something is holiness let me tell you this tonight if you don't have this something that we're talking about you better get it you better get it tonight it's the only thing that's going to get you out of layout to see you and put you in the resurrection won't you buy your hearts with us tonight won't you bow your heads with us this evening friends as i i look across this congregation tonight i see many people i see warriors here tonight believers real real heroes of the faith that you you would know as well as anybody that's the only reason why you're standing here tonight the only reason that you're still standing because it was not you holding yourself it was christ holding you by a true word by a true experience it's been more than a church experience it's been more than a can't meet an experience may i say it like this to you tonight as i look across this congregation i see the evidence i see the evidence of youth camps i see the evidence of special meetings i see people in the house of god on a wednesday night sure we're going through hard times but what we got there has brought us here and every service and every day it's getting stronger and has taken us one step closer home tonight has ever had about ever i closed it if there would be one here tonight that you've been around the holy ghost holy ghost has been around you maybe it's maybe it's even been on you but it's never come in you and sealed you maybe maybe you've never received that seal i implore you tonight by the word receive the holy ghost it's the only experience that'll keep you in this day and time to be one here tonight say lord i've i've received that seal but tonight god i want to refill him i want a refilling tonight god bless you i want more of you lord i want more of that perfect assurance i want more of that perfect confidence lord i want more of that settling faith i want more of that impression by the heavenly revelation god bless you as we pray tonight

there he's here tonight we're living in the closing hours of the world's history we're living in a time where people that people that we've looked up to have walked away i implore you tonight by the word look away to jesus i implore you tonight to look away from your mistakes peter look away from your faults and your failures look to your atonement tonight hallelujah oh yes he's here tonight he's here tonight maybe you're not acquainted with him maybe you're not acquainted with him like you should maybe you don't know him really in the power of his resurrection like you should know him he's here tonight he wants to meet with you he wants to fellowship with you he wants to reveal himself to you he's here tonight heavenly father lord all across this building tonight as believers lord believers of like precious faith lord real holy ghost filled believers but lord we're not believers without opposition father we're not believers without difficult times and difficult days lord we've come out of a youth camp and lord we were lifted into heavenly places lord father how you took us into a realm of your presence oh god the lord it was like any moment our bodies were going to be changed or we were able to be lifted up above all the fears and all the tormenting spirits and to be able to confess your word but lord as i stand here tonight father i'm preaching to the fruits lord i'm preaching the fruits of those moments lord father i know since they left and come home they've already been facing devils and facing struggles and or maybe some of them returned back to college or school this week and they've already begun to face the pressures and face the temptations again but tonight dear god they've not bowed their knee they've not given in lord well there's nothing the devil's done this week that's been enough to cause them to begin to recant on their testimony and say well i guess i didn't get nothing i guess i didn't receive nothing but lord as i stepped in this building tonight lord the atmosphere was charged with your presence lord does the son of god begin to sing his eyes on the sparrow and i know that he's watching me lord fathers i begin to see people break out in the spirit oh god and begin to shout and rejoice father lord i know that's more than an emotion lord i know that's more than a feeling or a sensation as our critics would like to call it lord that child is coming from a revelation lord that dance is coming from a revelation lord they've been through hell this week they've been through tormenting times but they stand here tonight to testify and let the devil know you was on my trail but the lord that was watching the sparrow was watching over me and i found my place in the house of god tonight i'm not defeated the temptation's just not overtaken me the pressures have not overruled me i am a believer i am a son and daughter of god now father i invite you tonight lord to come into this meeting by your presence lord father for these that around the altar tonight we're going to pray with them lord but father i'm asking you from the pulpit to the back door all across this building lord father we've seen so many scattered testimonies we've seen so many wishy-washy christians oh god the prophet of god said what's hurting the churches not the bootleg joint it's not the it's not the the party places it's these scatter testimonies lord but tonight god i believe you're birthing a generation that's going to produce more than scattered testimonies they're going to produce strong testimonies they're going to produce testimonies and overcome the devil by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony father i invite you to come right now lord to every heart lord if there would be one here tonight dear god that has only received a touch of the holy ghost on their flesh or maybe enough in their spirit oh god but it's not been sealed lord in their soul i prayed tonight god that this would be the night lord that you would you would come down personally and that hardened that life oh god lord you would change that nature you would change those habits you would change that attitude you would change that direction oh god you would change it by your presence tonight lord and may you seal yourself in and seal the world out o god and for those tonight lord that have received it father we're asking for a refilling tonight god we're asking for a refreshing or renewing oh god a reviving of our spirits a revival of our praise oh god we're looking to you tonight lord we want more than just a camp experience we want more than just to be sunday morning christians we want to be held father like peter was that day lord we want to be standing here oh god if our friends walk away if our loved ones turn away if our favorite preacher leaves we'll be standing right here saying lord to whom shall we go lord as i heard your prophet say today peter did not say where shall we go he said to whom shall we go lord it was not about a place father it was about a person and the person was christ he knew if i leave this person there'll be no place i can find peace there'll be no place i can find lasting achievement there'll be no place i can find translation power there'll be no place i can find faith there'll be no place i can find healing i must stay in the homeland of the church which is the message of the hour the things that the prophet has told if i want to find the blessings of god i must stay where they are lord oh father baptize every believer here tonight with that same faith of peter lord that'll stand there and say father we have nowhere else to go this message alone has rapturing faith this message alone has third pull power this message alone has the power to change our
