[12:09] just meet the needs of God's people also
[12:13] uh you know the campground is large as
[12:15] many acres and really really don't want
[12:18] you going out into the woods
[12:20] unsupervised so unless that we have
[12:23] organized um uh super
[12:26] supervised walks and and uh uh trips
[12:31] through the woods well we we'd like for
[12:33] you to kind of just stay up around in
[12:35] this area unless that we do that we do
[12:38] have as I tell you every year and and it
[12:41] is also spring so you know snakes are
[12:44] out we have all five of the um the major
[12:49] poisonous snakes here in Louisiana and
[12:52] uh you know as as I've explained um they
[12:57] they can be dangerous also
[13:00] um for you youngest guys that likes to
[13:03] go catch frogs in the pond those um are
[13:06] sewer ponds so don't play in the
[13:09] sewer
[13:11] um did you get it if you don't I'll
[13:15] explain that to you if you didn't get it
[13:17] some of you blondes may wait till
[13:19] tomorrow but anyway you know you know if
[13:22] you're um a registered camper here um of
[13:26] course you're staying off the grounds
[13:27] with your parents that's a whole
[13:29] different situation we do not allow uh
[13:31] young people to stay out and just take
[13:34] in motels around with in unsupervised
[13:37] situations but if you're here with your
[13:39] parents this doesn't apply to you but if
[13:42] you're a registered camper on the
[13:44] grounds we don't want you leave in the
[13:45] grounds without letting some of us know
[13:48] so you're to be here and be because
[13:51] we're responsible for you and we don't
[13:53] know who uncle so and so is that might
[13:55] be meeting and picking you up so you
[13:58] know we don't want none of that
[13:59] happening you're here your parents sent
[14:01] you here to be here on the campgrounds
[14:04] so do not leave the campgrounds without
[14:06] letting some of us know you know um we
[14:10] uh we believe that it's good for a man
[14:12] not to touch a woman especially if
[14:13] they're not married you know so we don't
[14:16] want you pairing off you know of course
[14:19] if you got to hold Sweetie Pie's hand
[14:22] just get a stick one of you on one one
[14:26] side of the stick and on the other and
[14:28] so get your stick you can walk around
[14:30] holding the stick unless you got a rock
[14:32] on her finger well that may be a little
[14:33] different you know every every church
[14:36] has its rules and pastors and this is
[14:39] acceptable and that's acceptable and it
[14:41] ain't acceptable but um you know here on
[14:44] Camp that's kind of what our rules are
[14:47] is um you
[14:48] know that um you know you just don't
[14:51] pair off and and and go out away from
[14:54] here and then holding hands with each
[14:57] other unless you have a rock on the
[14:58] finger
[14:59] so you know you kind of get the idea of
[15:02] what I want and uh we're going to have a
[15:04] good time and you know if we follow the
[15:07] rules well you don't get in any trouble
[15:11] and uh I don't want any trouble it don't
[15:13] make me happy and don't make Jesus happy

[47:22] Isaiah
[47:24] 40 and verse 27 31 we're going to read
[47:29] there and then we're going to turn to
[47:32] Deuteronomy 32 but Isaiah
[47:36] 40 and verse
[47:49] 27 why sayest thou oh Jacob and speakest
[47:53] thou oh Israel my way
[47:57] is hid from the Lord and my judgment is
[47:59] passed over from my God hast thou not
[48:03] known and hast thou not heard that the
[48:06] Everlasting God the Lord the creator of
[48:10] the ends of the Earth Feth not neither
[48:14] is weary there is no searching of his
[48:18] understanding he giveth power to the
[48:20] faint and to the him them that have no
[48:23] might he increases
[48:25] strength even the you shall shall faint
[48:27] and be weary and the young men shall
[48:29] utterly fall they that wait upon the
[48:31] Lord shall renew their strength and they
[48:35] shall Mount up with wings as
[48:37] eagles they shall run and not be weary
[48:40] they shall walk and not faint amen I
[48:43] just also would like you to turn
[48:46] Deuteronomy
[48:55] 32:9
[49:06] if you have it say amen
[49:09] amen for the Lord's portion is his
[49:13] people isin't that a wonderful
[49:17] statement amen God says you are what I
[49:23] want you are what I have chosen
[49:27] you are who I deal with now notice he
[49:31] owns the whole Earth but he says you're
[49:34] my
[49:35] portion Jacob is a lot of his
[49:38] inheritance he found him in a desert
[49:40] land and in the waste howling Wilderness
[49:43] he led him about he instructed him he
[49:46] kept him as the apple of his eye as an
[49:50] eagle stirreth up her nest flutter over
[49:53] her young spreadeth abroad her wings
[49:55] taketh them beare him on her wings so
[49:58] the Lord alone did lead him and there
[50:02] was no strange god with him you may be
[50:06] seated the Lord bless the reading of his
[50:09] word I would like to title this this
[50:12] morning or this
[50:15] morning whatever time it
[50:19] is amen everybody obviously thinks it's
[50:22] over amen but uh I want to title this
[50:27] evening uh the eagle
[50:30] Christian the eagle
[50:33] Christian God Likens his children his
[50:38] Heritage unto Eagles we're familiar with
[50:41] how often brother Brandon would uh speak
[50:45] of this and I may bring some of those
[50:48] things up to you at some point but God
[50:53] Likens not only his Heritage to E eagles
[50:57] which is you he Likens himself to an
[51:00] eagle I had got interested here a while
[51:03] back and was studying on the nature and
[51:06] and the habits of
[51:08] eagles and some of what I found I I I
[51:11] want to bring to you I I will be
[51:13] speaking specifically about two classes
[51:16] of eagle that you might be familiar with
[51:19] and most likely when Moses was writing
[51:22] this he was referring to these eagles
[51:24] which was the golden eagle and the and
[51:26] the uh Imperial Eagle but brother bandam
[51:30] said that his first Bible was
[51:33] nature uh he said in nature you can see
[51:36] God expressing himself in the universe
[51:40] you could see it he mentioned the
[51:41] flowers he mentioned the seasons he
[51:44] mentioned the cycle of of of spring
[51:48] summer fall winter and then there's a
[51:50] resurrection again amen he he he said
[51:53] you can see God and that's where uh uh
[51:56] you can see him unfold himself and
[51:59] unfold his nature when we go back to the
[52:03] beginning and we see that in in Genesis
[52:06] 1 and two and so forth when he is
[52:08] bringing
[52:09] forth uh plant life and animal life and
[52:12] marine
[52:14] life amen the economy of God Amen
[52:18] provided a place for that life to come
[52:21] forth he provided an earth he provided
[52:25] he provided a ground he he provided he
[52:27] provided an
[52:29] atmosphere where that seed could come
[52:32] now there was something in that seed
[52:34] before it had ever got in that
[52:37] atmosphere and what was in that seed was
[52:40] the spoken word of God which made that
[52:43] seed an attribute of God before before
[52:47] it was ever in Earth it was in his mind
[52:50] and after it came from his mind it came
[52:51] out of his mouth the first light that
[52:54] was ever given amen the beginning was
[52:57] not the sunlight but it was the spoken
[53:00] word and the spoken word said let there
[53:03] be it didn't matter how long it was
[53:05] going to take amen you know if you're a
[53:08] parent here and youve prayed for your
[53:10] child the word of God has already said
[53:12] let there be it didn't matter how long
[53:15] it was going to take it had to happen
[53:18] because it did not start on Earth It
[53:21] Started From
[53:22] God praise the name of the Lord amen so
[53:25] he provided
[53:27] he provided a place for that seed to
[53:30] come forth amen and then he provided the
[53:34] atmosphere to reveal amen what was in
[53:38] that
[53:40] seed amen the atmosphere must be there
[53:44] first to reveal in order for Life to
[53:47] Come brother bam said when he when he
[53:51] put the seed in the Earth the seed can
[53:53] only come forth with the power of life
[53:56] within it to transform
[53:58] it you see amen this is the first
[54:03] night there's a lot of different
[54:06] situations have walked into this
[54:09] room but I'm not preaching to what I
[54:15] see because God has designed the
[54:19] word amen to have a certain
[54:22] effect beyond the
[54:25] exterior and and you may not realize it
[54:28] but what you have inside of you tonight
[54:31] is
[54:32] stronger than what's on the
[54:35] outside now he said that God put that
[54:38] seed in there with the
[54:41] potentials that it would be what he said
[54:44] it would
[54:45] be he put that seed there with the
[54:50] potential of what it would be the only
[54:54] reason the seed would not come come
[54:56] forth and and show that potential is
[55:00] because it was never in the right
[55:07] place as long as it would stay in its
[55:10] right category it would be exactly what
[55:13] God said it would be it had to be that
[55:15] way cuz he made it that way and he made
[55:18] a channel that if it stays in his
[55:20] channel in his line of word it will
[55:23] bring forth
[55:24] exactly what his word said it would be
[55:28] it cannot move from there it's channeled
[55:30] exactly right so with everything in the
[55:32] trust in his own son that it' be that
[55:35] way God said it's all good I'll rest and
[55:38] each one of those seeds has power in
[55:40] itself to transform itself into the
[55:44] species that I desire it to
[55:48] be oh my amen that's what it must be
[55:52] because I have given every seed
[55:55] transforming power
[55:57] to make out of itself in its potentials
[56:00] now to make out of itself exactly what I
[56:04] want it to be notice what the prophet is
[56:07] saying not what you want to be but what
[56:10] he wants you to
[56:12] be now amen what expresses that seed is
[56:17] the anointing that comes upon
[56:20] it it takes the water of his word to
[56:24] express the seed that's in you all right
[56:28] amen the anointing water brings forth
[56:31] the seed and whatever that seed is it
[56:34] will be revealed praise the name of the
[56:36] Lord amen that's why I'm not preaching
[56:39] to cows
[56:43] tonight humans bring forth
[56:46] humans cows bring forth cows pigs bring
[56:50] forth pigs come on then there's
[56:54] something a little higher than a
[56:56] human amen that's a human with the
[56:59] spirit of God in
[57:00] him amen then you will reflect what that
[57:04] potential is on the inside of
[57:07] you Hallelujah hey I'm just like you
[57:09] tonight I'm I'm traveling too all right
[57:10] we're all getting here we're all getting
[57:12] here all right we find whatever that
[57:15] seed is it will be
[57:18] revealed we find that God would take His
[57:21] prophets and he would take them amen he
[57:23] wouldn't take them into the cities he
[57:25] would take them into the wild
[57:27] and and there he would teach them about
[57:29] his nature and what he wanted to be the
[57:31] Bible calls His prophets Eagles Eagles
[57:34] are uh prophets are eagles now amen he
[57:38] he would teach them we can see in John
[57:40] the Baptist and so forth that that he
[57:42] would teach them even the very Spirit of
[57:45] the things that they would face that
[57:48] would be in opposition of their message
[57:50] and God God would show them that amen
[57:53] when when John the Baptist came out of
[57:55] the Wilderness he'd been since a child
[57:56] he'd been out there when he comes out at
[57:58] the age of 30 and he begins to see these
[58:01] these Pharisees and this system that is
[58:04] confronting him and challenging him he
[58:06] called them amen snakes and he saw what
[58:09] they were like he had seen them before
[58:12] because God had already taught
[58:15] him he had given him
[58:18] discernment Amen to be able to see the
[58:21] spirit of the thing amen so we can see
[58:26] with Moses for instance how God met him
[58:29] and he taught him in the desert he first
[58:31] attracted his attention as an old man he
[58:33] attracted his attention by the burning
[58:35] bush and commissioned him to go back
[58:37] into Egypt and confront pharaoh to let
[58:40] my people go amen Moses was born A
[58:44] Gifted boy he already had the gift of
[58:47] faith in him the prophet said he was
[58:49] already there the equipment to be a
[58:51] deliverer was
[58:53] there amen all the teaching of his
[58:55] mother never brought that uh that that
[58:58] uh that out in
[58:59] him amen all the all all the wisdom of
[59:03] Egypt never brought it out in him it was
[59:06] when he
[59:08] failed it was when he became a failure
[59:11] it was when he forgot about Victory and
[59:13] thought it's no more God can't use me
[59:17] anymore amen when he become an old
[59:20] man it was then God attracted his
[59:24] attention you can do something this Mo
[59:27] this evening that Moses did not do is
[59:29] you can see God and be attracted by God
[59:32] at a young
[59:34] age and that God Amen can attract you by
[59:38] the pillar of fire in a
[59:40] bush and it caught him and it was there
[59:44] when he was caught amen that what was in
[59:46] him was
[59:48] quickened praise the name of the Lord
[59:51] amen all of his understanding of what
[59:54] God wanted to do all of his
[59:56] understanding of the promise to Abraham
[59:58] none of that quickened the seed that was
[1:00:00] in him it took God and God Alone to
[1:00:05] bring that out in him and I want to just
[1:00:06] say this it's going to take more than
[1:00:09] wisdom to bring out in you what God has
[1:00:11] placed there amen because what God
[1:00:13] places there takes God himself to bring
[1:00:15] that
[1:00:17] out amen and notice what God placed in
[1:00:22] him was not a
[1:00:24] toy it was not there for him to to just
[1:00:28] use it when he wanted
[1:00:30] to it was not a luxury what God placed
[1:00:34] in him was needful for The
[1:00:38] Exodus
[1:00:40] amen amen what God places in
[1:00:44] youen is needful for this
[1:00:47] hour brother bam said in Satan's eeden
[1:00:50] that the spirit of God is not something
[1:00:52] schooled into you it's something pred
[1:00:56] destinated into you I I want to I want
[1:00:58] to stop and ask you if you're awake I
[1:00:59] want I want to ask
[1:01:00] you could you believe that this moment
[1:01:03] is predestinated you say well I didn't
[1:01:05] really plan it well but I'm not talking
[1:01:07] about you're
[1:01:08] planning you you would find in Scripture
[1:01:11] that God hardly waited on your
[1:01:13] planning in fact he done it when you
[1:01:15] weren't ready he done it when you was at
[1:01:17] your
[1:01:18] worst
[1:01:21] amen amen he didn't he didn't have
[1:01:23] Abraham have Isaac when when Abraham
[1:01:26] could do it he waited till he couldn't
[1:01:28] do it he waited till he got to his end
[1:01:32] then he visited Sarah according to the
[1:01:34] time of
[1:01:35] life hey there's there's baren wombs in
[1:01:38] here amen there's there's people haven't
[1:01:40] Bor anything in their church for years
[1:01:42] but God said it's time now to bring to
[1:01:45] life what is inside of you it's time
[1:01:49] amen that your joy will come forth amen
[1:01:52] out of
[1:01:54] Sorrow
[1:01:56] it's not something schooled into you
[1:01:57] it's something God predestines into
[1:02:00] you this age is predestinated this hour
[1:02:03] is predestinated this message is
[1:02:05] predestinated the the messenger's
[1:02:07] predestinated but you're random you're
[1:02:08] just here by accident we don't know how
[1:02:10] you got in here amen I don't even know
[1:02:13] why you're here at camp and some of you
[1:02:14] looking at me like you don't know why
[1:02:15] you're here either you're the perfect
[1:02:17] candidate for God to do something
[1:02:24] with
[1:02:27] your experiences cannot be schooled or
[1:02:28] taught into you it's predestinated by
[1:02:31] God's hand and God's forn knowledge into
[1:02:35] you so it's Moses amen who pinned these
[1:02:38] words in Deuteronomy that he would liken
[1:02:41] the relationship between God and his
[1:02:43] people to that of
[1:02:47] eagles in Exodus 19 God told Moses said
[1:02:50] you have seen you have seen what I did
[1:02:53] to the Egyptians yeah I I I I saw I I
[1:02:56] saw what you did you absolutely took the
[1:02:59] the strongest most advanced power on
[1:03:02] Earth and destroyed them you saw what I
[1:03:05] did to the Egyptians you see what I do
[1:03:07] to
[1:03:08] sin you see what I do to Devils you see
[1:03:12] what i' done to task
[1:03:15] Masters you know you know it was me that
[1:03:18] done that you know no man could set you
[1:03:21] free from those things that I'm the one
[1:03:23] that done it you have seen what I have
[1:03:25] done
[1:03:26] he amen God I I saw what you did see
[1:03:29] this is Eagle talking to Eagle I I I saw
[1:03:31] I saw what you did he said how I bear
[1:03:34] you I carried you brother Joel you did
[1:03:38] not get here by yourself I carried you
[1:03:41] to this
[1:03:42] moment amen where is he trying to carry
[1:03:45] you I brought you to
[1:03:48] myself wow I did not just carry you out
[1:03:51] into a Wilderness to leave you there if
[1:03:53] you stay in the wilderness it's because
[1:03:55] you chose to stay there but I carry you
[1:03:58] to a place in order to bring you to
[1:04:02] myself thou therefore if you'll obey my
[1:04:05] voice and deed and keep my Covenant
[1:04:07] you'll be a peculiar treasure unto me
[1:04:09] above all my all people all Earth is
[1:04:12] mine I want you to notice there's the
[1:04:15] purpose there's the destiny is to bring
[1:04:18] you to
[1:04:20] him and the eagle is always a pro
[1:04:23] prophetic message it was a prophetic
[1:04:26] message Moses was the eagle it was his
[1:04:30] message of Deliverance it says it it has
[1:04:32] brought you to
[1:04:37] me that's your
[1:04:40] destiny it's your destiny to be like
[1:04:44] him brother brandham said that when any
[1:04:47] believer comes to God I want you to
[1:04:49] listen he becomes God's attribute of his
[1:04:54] word that's a high
[1:04:57] calling now if you were just coming to
[1:04:59] any church any nominal Church your High
[1:05:01] Calling may be to sit there where rip
[1:05:03] jeans try to look like the world be
[1:05:05] inclusive do whatever you can to to fit
[1:05:08] in and and welcome anything in but
[1:05:10] that's not your calling that's not your
[1:05:11] destiny your Destinies be higher than
[1:05:13] that your destiny is not to reflect a
[1:05:16] church it's to reflect God's word and
[1:05:19] that could mean that could mean God
[1:05:21] would train you all your life for one
[1:05:23] moment brother bam said he could train a
[1:05:24] man 50 years to use him for 5 minutes is
[1:05:28] that how is that what he said 50 for
[1:05:29] five something like that it was a long
[1:05:30] time whatever it was they'll check it
[1:05:32] out amen he he can train you a long time
[1:05:36] to use you because that moment is going
[1:05:38] to be more important to God and in his
[1:05:41] economy than your education than your
[1:05:44] career than anything else that moment
[1:05:47] will have eternal
[1:05:52] value you may not even understand it
[1:05:55] brother Gabe
[1:05:57] it'll be
[1:05:58] God he said he becomes God's attribute
[1:06:01] of his word he is used listen this is
[1:06:04] the eagle of our time he is used to
[1:06:07] manifest the word that's promised for
[1:06:11] the
[1:06:13] day blessed be the name of the Lord we
[1:06:16] find out that God was so merciful to
[1:06:18] Moses out there in that Dead Sea in the
[1:06:20] Red Sea rather that he said in Exodus I
[1:06:22] carried You On Eagle's Wings I brought
[1:06:24] you to myself I carry you on eagles's
[1:06:26] wings and I brought you to myself he
[1:06:28] said there was other men in the middle
[1:06:30] of the sea they were trying to
[1:06:32] impersonate they were trying to cross
[1:06:33] over but I carried You On Eagle's Wings
[1:06:36] don't think you crossed that Red Sea by
[1:06:40] yourself I could have done to the Red
[1:06:42] Sea what I did to the
[1:06:44] others but I dried it up for you I made
[1:06:48] the ground firm it was a door that
[1:06:51] nobody else could see but I saw it
[1:06:53] because I'm an eagle and eagle Have
[1:06:59] Eyes amen what was it amen God always
[1:07:03] Likens His prophets to Eagles and what
[1:07:04] was it Moses was his messenger they were
[1:07:07] following Moses and that was the Eagle's
[1:07:09] Wings they were carried on because he
[1:07:12] was packing God's message and the people
[1:07:14] followed that they were following God as
[1:07:17] they followed Moses with his message of
[1:07:19] Deliverance and the Bible said he they
[1:07:22] perish not with them who believe not why
[1:07:26] God is rich in
[1:07:28] Mercy so God In The Exodus is choosing
[1:07:32] to be identified in the eagle and the
[1:07:34] eagle is a special built
[1:07:36] bird he's built to fly higher than any
[1:07:40] other bird he's built to fly into the
[1:07:44] heavenlies other birds can't follow the
[1:07:47] eagle to the heights that he can fly to
[1:07:51] why the pressure is too
[1:07:54] great
[1:07:58] I say it again the pressure is too great
[1:08:01] yeah we've had a lot of birds that
[1:08:02] thought they were Eagles flapped out a
[1:08:04] long time ago amen but there's Eagles
[1:08:06] still going they're not
[1:08:09] [Applause]
[1:08:13] flapping
[1:08:15] amen pressure is too great for others
[1:08:17] but the Eagles build for
[1:08:19] it God God designed the eagle with a
[1:08:22] nature and equipment to be able to do
[1:08:26] certain things and calling his own
[1:08:29] children
[1:08:30] Eagles he's saying that there I have
[1:08:33] built you a certain way and I have built
[1:08:35] you to do certain things now God is not
[1:08:38] going to say something about his own
[1:08:40] amen that he's not going to bring them
[1:08:42] to that
[1:08:46] place I want to I want to I want to
[1:08:50] dwell on one aspect for a little bit
[1:08:52] that that you'll find very
[1:08:53] relatable did you do this tick
[1:08:56] talk you did I couldn't hear it back
[1:08:59] there you just sck talk okay good you
[1:09:02] didn't know but you know you know Eagles
[1:09:04] do
[1:09:05] that you know that yeah we're gonna find
[1:09:09] out you know how many how many's
[1:09:13] interested in
[1:09:18] courtship you
[1:09:21] married they still interesting course
[1:09:23] that's great amen anyway um
[1:09:29] great so an eagle stays in the nest till
[1:09:33] he's about one years old and then after
[1:09:35] that this was another sermon after that
[1:09:37] he's kicked out of the
[1:09:40] nest and and he begins to learn how to
[1:09:44] be by himself and to grow up and that
[1:09:47] takes about a period of about three
[1:09:49] years after about a period of about 3
[1:09:51] years now he's about four years old he
[1:09:54] he starts becoming inter arrested in in
[1:09:56] the
[1:09:57] female and he does something
[1:10:00] strange um he began to chase
[1:10:04] her hey I know you're tired
[1:10:07] but only those old people can relate to
[1:10:10] that and and he will he will chase her
[1:10:13] in the game of tag that can actually
[1:10:14] take
[1:10:16] days days and at first the the female
[1:10:20] will show not one bit of interest in her
[1:10:23] in him not one
[1:10:26] but after days of being
[1:10:29] chased she'll go and and she'll get a
[1:10:36] stick yeah it was that one it proves
[1:10:41] that all these golden eagles have been
[1:10:42] to this
[1:10:44] camp and and she get a stick and she fly
[1:10:47] as high as eight or 10,000 ft she'll be
[1:10:51] way up there circling you know and if if
[1:10:53] that dude is still interested in her
[1:10:56] here fly up there with
[1:10:59] her and when she's way up there circling
[1:11:02] 10,000 feet should drop the
[1:11:06] stick and there goes you know the love
[1:11:09] bird and he will swoop down here catch
[1:11:12] the
[1:11:15] stick and she' you bring it back to her
[1:11:19] and she act
[1:11:24] uninterested it's too much like
[1:11:28] humans I mean 10,000 ft it's a long ways
[1:11:31] you know that's when the bell dings on
[1:11:32] the
[1:11:34] airplane that's a long ways James and
[1:11:37] and and
[1:11:39] then should go get another stick a
[1:11:42] little bigger a little heavier she won't
[1:11:44] go as high but she'll fly up and then
[1:11:46] she'll go a little faster and she'll
[1:11:48] drop the stick and there goes this boy
[1:11:51] and he swoops in
[1:11:53] thereof grabs a stick stick brings it
[1:11:56] back there her and she shows no
[1:11:58] interest she'll go get another stick a
[1:12:01] bigger one fly a little lower a little
[1:12:04] faster drop it again here you
[1:12:09] think what in the world she
[1:12:13] doing make me run all over the place
[1:12:15] look
[1:12:17] crazy I what in the world how did God
[1:12:20] liken that to
[1:12:23] you any of you ever chased anybody for
[1:12:29] days picked up things you thought they
[1:12:31] would be interested
[1:12:34] in all right well I'm not going where
[1:12:36] you think I am and then he drop it again
[1:12:39] and she'd he'd pick it up bring it to
[1:12:41] her and and
[1:12:43] finally the last test I guess see this
[1:12:47] is
[1:12:48] courtship she'll get a stick a l almost
[1:12:51] as big as her as heavy as her and she'll
[1:12:53] fly maybe 500 ft do a little
[1:12:56] swoop and drop
[1:13:00] it and if he gets that one she's
[1:13:05] interested
[1:13:07] Hallelujah you know why she's doing that
[1:13:09] I hope you're listening to me real close
[1:13:10] you wake up now I know you're tired and
[1:13:12] I hope you understand she's looking at
[1:13:14] this guy as if if he's going to be my
[1:13:16] mate she he better be able to catch what

[1:16:35] familiar with the message you're

[1:16:38] story over and over and over is Eagle
[1:16:41] stirreth or Nest who is this MZ many
[1:16:43] other places in the church age book he
[1:16:45] talked about predestination the
[1:16:47] predestinated seed and he typed it amen
[1:16:49] to you being in a
[1:16:51] barnyard an eagle in a barnyard eating
[1:16:54] what was not meant for you you were
[1:16:56] eating it
[1:16:59] anyhow yeah you were pinned in eating
[1:17:01] eating what chickens at and that means
[1:17:04] if all only example I have is chickens
[1:17:07] I'm going to try to act like a chicken
[1:17:09] can you imagine an eagle trying to act
[1:17:11] like a chicken you imagine an eagle that
[1:17:13] screams trying to squawk like a
[1:17:16] chicken come on he didn't know nothing
[1:17:19] he he didn't know but it wasn't building
[1:17:21] him to be there but he was there because
[1:17:23] he was trapped into do it amen but the
[1:17:27] mother amen the parent knew that she had
[1:17:30] another one
[1:17:32] somewhere amen so she begin to fly she
[1:17:35] begin to look for
[1:17:38] him
[1:17:40] Hallelujah she flew over that Barnard
[1:17:42] and there after all these years this
[1:17:45] little one laying there saw this Shadow
[1:17:48] swoop over and looked up and looked
[1:17:51] right quick at the chicken looked back
[1:17:52] up and oh my
[1:17:56] this was something different the one on
[1:17:58] the ground didn't exactly know what that
[1:18:00] was but the one in the air knew what the
[1:18:01] one on the ground
[1:18:05] was and and when she screamed at him
[1:18:08] said he looked up you see that's the
[1:18:10] first Direction you got to begin to look
[1:18:13] tonight amen you got to know when the
[1:18:15] call of God is going forth is to
[1:18:17] redirect your attention from Earthly
[1:18:19] things to Heavenly things if you're
[1:18:21] going to be a Heavenly creature you
[1:18:22] can't be feeding on Earthly things
[1:18:27] and he directed his attention look up at
[1:18:29] me and he looked up and and she be to
[1:18:31] say you're not for that
[1:18:33] barnyard you were raised you you have
[1:18:36] something in you see he looked up there

[1:18:50] how to fly cuz they've never
[1:18:52] Flo but somebody who has can teach you

[1:20:33] voice what was she doing they hadn't
[1:20:35] even they didn't even know how to fly
[1:20:37] yet but they were learning how to listen
[1:20:39] to the voice that was talking to them
[1:20:41] let me tell you amen if you think it's
[1:20:42] just a man that called you in this hour
[1:20:44] you're going to fall you're going to
[1:20:45] walk away but if you realize it's a
[1:20:47] voice of God I don't care what weapon
[1:20:49] the enemy is going to throw at you amen
[1:20:51] it'll hold you in the hour of Temptation
[1:20:54] it'll hold told you when the enemy comes
[1:20:56] in like a flood he said I raise up a
[1:20:58] standard against
[1:21:01] it he said you mount up with
[1:21:05] wings as
[1:21:08] Eagles this is how brother bam said this
[1:21:11] is how the spirit operates towards you
[1:21:15] amen amen the
[1:21:17] anointing on this last age is the flying
[1:21:20] eagle I'm studying to the ages he
[1:21:24] promised that these he would send four
[1:21:26] anointings and those anointings would be
[1:21:28] there to combat the enemy the powers
[1:21:32] that Satan used against the church and
[1:21:35] God would send an anointing in that
[1:21:38] anointing would combat that power the
[1:21:40] first one was the lion the second was
[1:21:43] the ox the third was the man through the
[1:21:45] reformers and so forth but the last was
[1:21:47] a flying eagle brother B said they were
[1:21:50] there to protect the the the book of
[1:21:52] Acts and to keep the word
[1:21:56] and to perform it to watch over the word
[1:22:00] to watch that it is
[1:22:02] performed amen he he said often we think
[1:22:05] it'd be impossible to be a martyr to be
[1:22:07] to be in that time as a Marty how could
[1:22:10] I give my life he said but you want to
[1:22:11] think of it like this recall the faith
[1:22:14] that we daily use to Triumph in Christ
[1:22:18] Jesus is the same faith that upheld all
[1:22:22] the
[1:22:23] martyrs
[1:22:25] and the Supreme faith will give Supreme
[1:22:30] Grace for the Supreme hour if you would
[1:22:34] talk to those under the anointing of an
[1:22:36] ox for instance they would tell you I I
[1:22:38] couldn't do what I'd
[1:22:40] done but all I know that when I went
[1:22:42] into that hour there was something there
[1:22:44] that not only held
[1:22:46] me that satisfied me it was bigger than
[1:22:51] the the torture I was going through in
[1:22:54] fact I enjoyed that more than the
[1:22:56] torture in fact I was sorry when the
[1:22:59] torture
[1:23:00] ended that's direct testimony there was
[1:23:03] a man by the name of theodosis he was
[1:23:05] put on a stretching rack how many's been
[1:23:07] on a stretching rack it's not
[1:23:09] tonight he was put on a stretching rack
[1:23:11] and they pulled him and pulled him young
[1:23:13] man about 25 years old and they pulled
[1:23:15] him until everything the sockets were
[1:23:16] coming out and and he wouldn't recant he
[1:23:19] just sat there and and he and stood
[1:23:20] there whatever stretch there and and and
[1:23:23] he took it and the and Fox's book of
[1:23:25] Martin said with such fortitude that
[1:23:27] when they finally released him they
[1:23:29] asked him how could you stand the pain
[1:23:31] and the the rack the way you did he said
[1:23:33] all I can tell you is while I was on the
[1:23:35] rack a young man Stood Beside Me with a
[1:23:38] napkin and some water and he just kept
[1:23:40] brushing my brow and I was sorry to be
[1:23:42] let
[1:23:43] loose what was that the same kind of
[1:23:46] Faith amen the same kind of faith that
[1:23:49] hold you in your hour amen when the body
[1:23:51] could not take it anymore the same kind
[1:23:54] of the faith amen will lift you in that
[1:23:56] hour and it'll be one step at a time but
[1:23:59] you come through it and you'll be
[1:24:01] rejoicing in The Fellowship of his
[1:24:03] suffering more than the trial
[1:24:08] itself blessed be the name of the
[1:24:11] Lord that kind of faith that kind of
[1:24:19] anointing brother random said that in

[1:40:10] do is show you things you didn't know
[1:40:11] would work will
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:15] work Hallelujah but even
[1:40:18] then even then he
[1:40:22] fell
[1:40:25] to the woman of the
[1:40:28] age and he gave his gift to the woman of
[1:40:32] the
[1:40:33] age he gave his
[1:40:36] secret what God had told him was
[1:40:39] precious he just threw it out there to
[1:40:41] her because he got tired of the
[1:40:44] press he didn't stay with what God had
[1:40:47] told him to do and he gave up his secret
[1:40:51] in her lap
[1:40:54] and when he done that and fell asleep
[1:40:58] don't fall
[1:41:00] asleep she called the enemy
[1:41:03] in and they shaved his
[1:41:08] hair he took away his
[1:41:13] message you thought you didn't need
[1:41:16] it you got so comfortable after all
[1:41:19] these years you didn't think you needed
[1:41:21] it but in her lap
[1:41:23] when it was shaved off she shook you
[1:41:27] says wake up Samson the enem is upon you
[1:41:29] and he got up and he didn't even
[1:41:33] know that the spirit of the
[1:41:36] Lord had left
[1:41:41] him you know you can get to a place
[1:41:45] where you don't even
[1:41:48] know if he's there or
[1:41:51] not when you fall asleep in the lap of
[1:41:53] the
[1:41:57] enemy oh and the enemy came in they had
[1:42:01] him now I'd seen you see some of you
[1:42:04] older ones you gave you gave testimonies
[1:42:06] here you were baptized you did all those
[1:42:08] things and where are you
[1:42:12] now failed testimony after failed
[1:42:17] testimony then they put his eyes
[1:42:20] out and made him work for
[1:42:26] them you think how sad it
[1:42:31] is look how sad it is when an eagle's
[1:42:34] wings have been
[1:42:39] clipped and he's grinding at the meal
[1:42:42] doing whatever the enemy tells him to do
[1:42:44] he's grinding at the meal people come
[1:42:46] and look at him and laugh and had a web
[1:42:48] page of Samson the failed experiment in
[1:42:50] the message and all this kind of stuff
[1:42:52] and you know and
[1:42:54] samon the path out of the message
[1:43:02] and you see kids the thing they didn't
[1:43:05] realize

[1:43:36] Satan cannot get over that promise no
[1:43:39] matter how hard he
[1:43:40] tries Jesus said that this age would be
[1:43:44] so
[1:43:46] deceiving that if it were possible he
[1:43:49] said false prophets all this uh false
[1:43:51] Christ false anointed ones whatever he
[1:43:53] said they come he said it' be so
[1:43:55] deceiving that you would be
[1:43:57] deceived if it
[1:44:00] were Satan can't get over if it were
[1:44:05] possible he has tried to tear it down

[1:44:33] value of it you don't see what good is
[1:44:40] it what good is
[1:44:43] it you know they had clipped him they
[1:44:45] had cut him they had shaved him one
[1:44:48] thing that God will not let be taken
[1:44:52] from you is the the
[1:44:56] potential of that seed and the Bible has
[1:44:58] this one little verse in stuck in the
[1:45:00] middle of that tragedy and it says how
[1:45:02] be it they hairs of his head begin to
[1:45:03] grow
[1:45:04] back and Satan said well that's of
[1:45:06] little significance you know let it grow
[1:45:08] let it
[1:45:09] grow ain't there a song like that let it
[1:45:12] grow let it
[1:45:13] grow hope you don't know
[1:45:16] it and and and there's
[1:45:18] growing and it's growing and it's
[1:45:20] growing sorry brother Ron you know it
[1:45:23] don't you
[1:45:25] amen amen and it's growing
[1:45:29] and yours is coming out and it's growing
[1:45:33] and he reaches back there one day and he
[1:45:35] realizes that I feel that oh
[1:45:39] yeah and when he felt
[1:45:43] that he remembered
[1:45:49] something I'm just walking amen he
[1:45:53] remembered something he remembered that
[1:45:56] an angel had visited his house and an
[1:46:00] angel had said this boy will be a
[1:46:03] Nazarite from his
[1:46:07] birth yeah I have claimed you as my
[1:46:11] own I have claimed you as my own he's a
[1:46:15] Nazarite don't let his hair be touching
[1:46:21] again
[1:46:26] but I can't see I can't see my eyes have
[1:46:29] been put
[1:46:32] out I can't
[1:46:35] see but Eagle Vision is not natural
[1:46:40] vision you know Eagles have two
[1:46:43] eyelids you can put one eye
[1:46:46] out two eyes out whatever there's more
[1:46:50] there that the enemy can't put out
[1:46:53] when they LED this boy into the this man
[1:46:56] into the middle of their sporting Arena
[1:46:58] and he's LED there and they ignored that
[1:47:01] the hair had grown
[1:47:03] out but when he had failed it he began
[1:47:06] to
[1:47:08] remember that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:47:11] yesterday today and
[1:47:21] forever I'm going to catch some of you
[1:47:24] blinded
[1:47:25] ones I'm going to catch some of you you
[1:47:29] bound at the
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:34] post and the enemy is
[1:47:37] laughing what an
[1:47:39] age I mean they're all over the Internet
[1:47:42] laughing at
[1:47:44] you you're in a c it's no good let's
[1:47:47] make sport of them let's make sport of
[1:47:48] their profit let's make sport of them
[1:47:50] let's take away the value of what they
[1:47:52] got let's put a centerpiece up here and
[1:47:55] let's all look at him and see what a
[1:47:57] failure he's been and he's Chained and
[1:48:01] he's there and he's
[1:48:03] blinded but God called
[1:48:09] him before he hit the
[1:48:12] ground and when he picked him
[1:48:15] up he closed his ey well no he didn't
[1:48:18] close anything they were
[1:48:20] gone but he opened his spiritual eyes
[1:48:24] and brother brandom said he caught a
[1:48:27] vision of
[1:48:29] possibility that God could bring me
[1:48:45] back brother Tim why would god brother
[1:48:49] Ron Brother Andrew dth
[1:48:53] why would God choose a failed
[1:48:57] experiment to show what the Flying Eagle
[1:49:00] anointing is brother
[1:49:03] Derek because there's another scripture
[1:49:06] it
[1:49:07] says to the messenger of this
[1:49:10] age give them eyes
[1:49:15] s I'm talking to samsons in this room
[1:49:18] give them eyes sh that they may see what
[1:49:21] he saying you're blind but but I got a
[1:49:23] Sav that can give you a vision that all
[1:49:25] things are possible to them that believe
[1:49:28] I'll bring you back and I want to tell
[1:49:30] you
[1:49:31] this as I'm closing I'm going to tell
[1:49:34] you this you're an eagle so you can take
[1:49:36] it I'm going to tell you this your
[1:49:38] greatest Victory will be when you
[1:49:44] die you can do some things while you're
[1:49:46] alive but when you die out to who you
[1:49:49] are God will kill more Philistines in
[1:49:52] your life
[1:49:53] with this anointing of the Flying Eagle
[1:49:56] here kill more in your life than you
[1:49:58] ever did
[1:50:04] yourself oh blessed let some Samson say
[1:50:07] Amen tonight amen there's an isav in the
[1:50:11] room amen that'll open your blinded eyes
[1:50:13] to see he's still the same yesterday
[1:50:16] today and forever this is not a dead
[1:50:19] word this is a Living Word my God is a
[1:50:22] living God God he brings things that are
[1:50:24] dead back to life again he heals cancer
[1:50:28] every demon is under his feet no demon
[1:50:30] in this room has not met de feat
[1:50:35] before God is looking for some
[1:50:40] Samson catch a
[1:50:43] vision you're still come on an
[1:50:50] eagle you're death

[1:51:08] time this is Eagle
[1:51:11] Vision eag Vision to look beyond the
[1:51:13] condition Eagle Vision to feel that hair
[1:51:15] growing back again which is his Covenant
[1:51:17] I can feel it coming
[1:51:18] back Eagle Vision to restore you
[1:51:25] all the enemy wants to taunt you and say
[1:51:27] you can't do it but he says I it's not
[1:51:29] about her it's about
[1:51:31] me you think you can't overcome it's not
[1:51:33] about what you can't overcome it's about
[1:51:35] me who's already
[1:51:37] overcome can you have that Vision
