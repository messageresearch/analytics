[5:54] Oh
[6:00] [Music]
[6:13] amen we praise God tonight for an
[6:17] opportunity to serve Him amen when
[6:21] greets you tonight in the name of the
[6:23] Lord Jesus and God bless you Saints and
[6:26] all of those that are streaming from
[6:28] around the world wherever you are we
[6:30] pray God's blessings
[6:31] his protections in this hour and surely
[6:36] the coming of the Lord draws nigh and we
[6:40] should live in a state of preparedness
[6:43] this is truly the time to be in Passover
[6:47] like I spoke about some months ago the
[6:51] blood the Holy Ghost must be applied
[6:53] upon the doorpost to the Church of the
[6:58] home and upon every individual it's more
[7:01] critical more important right now than
[7:03] ever right now the world as we know it
[7:06] has stopped people are looking at
[7:11] shortages and this has caused a lot of
[7:14] fear and panic
[7:16] people are afraid they'll be without
[7:18] essential goods the word about their
[7:21] jobs tomorrow the preparedness
[7:26] though that is really needed is the
[7:28] token the Holy Ghost applied the bien
[7:34] Passover means that you're in communion
[7:36] with Christ and I think right now we can
[7:40] realize the symbol means even more than
[7:43] ever we have walked before the sacred
[7:46] desk we have taken up the the bread and
[7:49] the wine right now I think it's really
[7:53] really important what communion means
[7:56] [Music]
[7:58] you're here quarantined from the world
[8:01] applying the blood eaten the lamb is
[8:05] roasted with fire
[8:09] it's an hour that you should pray like
[8:13] you've never prayed pray for the many
[8:16] needs not only for the virus situation
[8:19] but also those with cancer and other
[8:21] diseases and for the bride around the
[8:23] world may this just be a real wake-up
[8:26] call to every one of us this a very
[8:31] critical our my concern is also for the
[8:35] little children and I encourage you to
[8:37] gather those in your arms and explain to
[8:40] them that in all of this God is in
[8:43] control and that we believe that this
[8:47] too will pass
[8:49] perhaps we never know the normal that we
[8:53] have known might be some something new
[8:57] something different but God will see us
[8:59] through it
[9:01] for the rest of us we should take
[9:04] nothing for granted
[9:06] we don't know but what the services that
[9:10] we have had in the past might just be a
[9:13] fond memory or the random spoke of that
[9:16] and we know even himself that nothing is
[9:20] the same where he was standing speaking
[9:23] to his local congregation and said one
[9:26] day this might be a fond memory and
[9:28] certainly today we look back over those
[9:31] meetings were fond right now we look as
[9:35] we've had the council youth camp his
[9:39] camp could be a fond memory services
[9:43] like we've had in the past I've become
[9:46] the fond memory what's important in this
[9:51] hour is that we have the power to bind
[9:55] the serpent of death to do this we must
[9:59] be more sincere so I think an hour like
[10:02] this calls for a greater sincerity than
[10:05] ever and I'm calling on you that are
[10:08] here listening with me this evening
[10:11] joining us with this service that you
[10:14] take this time in this moment to become
[10:17] more dedicated more consecrated to God
[10:20] than ever before and that that you
[10:24] realize that God is asking for a greater
[10:27] sincerity because in order to bind the
[10:31] serpent we must be more sincere I'm
[10:33] asking you to pray to talk to the Lord
[10:37] to get in communion fellowship if the
[10:40] Holy Ghost is not in your life seek it
[10:42] with all your heart
[10:44] and then then when we come back together
[10:46] let us come taking nothing for granted
[10:50] but valuing one another and valuing our
[10:55] services and all that it entails because
[11:03] it has suddenly become something very
[11:06] very very precious
[11:09] so make your call in your election sure
[11:12] we're gonna go to prayer tonight I would
[11:15] like you to join your hand you're
[11:17] yourself together with others take care
[11:22] of someone by the hand
[11:24] maybe there's sickness in the hall maybe
[11:26] there's situations there you have need
[11:29] of right now our brother Darrell Baxter
[11:32] has injured his back I'd like I'd like
[11:36] those there or near by him just to lay
[11:38] hands upon him now as we pray our

[11:49] upon his head with a brain tumors there

[11:55] miracle did you know there's something
[11:59] more serious than that which could
[12:03] threaten the death of the body and that
[12:05] is eternal life is the greatest thing we
[12:09] could seek after and if you're needed
[12:12] but tonight seek him with all your heart
[12:14] while he may be found and knock well it
[12:17] shall be open to you and I believe right

[14:25] this request tonight to bring healing
[14:28] and deliverance in the mighty name of

[31:42] and our times of me situations Lord
[31:46] sometimes we don't know Lord we've never
[31:48] been in on before but God you know you
[31:52] know their hearts cry you know the needs
[31:54] you know the situations among us or do
[31:57] you know the panic that's in the land
[31:59] situations and sickness every word Lord
[32:04] the devil would like us to think that
[32:06] he's hanging on every tree that he's
[32:07] everywhere but we may be surrounded but
[32:11] we're surrounded by here or we're
[32:14] surrounded by your presence Lord we're
[32:16] surrounded by the great I am the one who
[32:18] can make a way where there seems to be
[32:20] no way the one who can take a piece of
[32:23] bread and make another piece up here the
[32:26] one who can lure to make food fall out
[32:29] of heaven whatever it is Lord that your
[32:31] people needed you were able to provide
[32:33] Lord we believe you're still that same
[32:36] God today Lord that whatever we have
[32:39] need of whether it be a physical need a
[32:42] financial need and a food of whatever it
[32:45] is Lord we know that you're able to
[32:47] provide Lord God we just ask that you
[32:50] strengthen your people Lord all over the
[32:52] world situations Lord panic pandemics
[32:57] but Lord there's nothing too hard for
[32:59] you but I'm thankful that even though we
[33:02] have a new name to face in this hour the
[33:05] Lord the word said you're the Lord God
[33:07] that heals all our diseases Lord we're
[33:11] looking to the blood of Jesus has still
[33:13] yet powerful still yet can cleanse the
[33:16] vilest sinner still yet can heal the
[33:18] sick still yet we will raise the dead
[33:21] Lord a blood that has not lost any power
[33:24] a blood Lord that still just as powerful
[33:27] today as the first moment
[33:29] came down out of that precious body Lord
[33:32] God we're so thankful we can have that
[33:34] kind of confidence nor do we have a
[33:36] confidence in you because you've never
[33:38] found one yet you never left one yet you
[33:42] never let one fall yet there's not even
[33:44] a sparrow that can fall without you
[33:46] knowing about it you know the things
[33:48] that we're in the situation we're in and
[33:50] you're mindful that tonight or do we
[33:53] commit this service to you everything
[33:55] Lord the word the songs Lord has touched
[33:57] her heart Lord we just asked it was
[34:00] strength and your people would pray in
[34:02] Jesus name Amen
[34:05] any man man we could turn on our Bibles
[34:09] to Exodus 14 a man I'd like to just
[34:12] continue on a thought that have been on
[34:14] the Lord is a man of war and yeah it
[34:20] just seems like every time I go to try
[34:23] to maybe look at something else there's
[34:24] always something that comes up and it
[34:26] just keeps me going down this way so
[34:28] we're going to continue because I
[34:30] believe he is a man of war and I believe
[34:32] he's a God that's mighty in battle and
[34:35] no matter what you may be facing no
[34:37] matter what you may be going through no
[34:38] matter what situation you find yourself
[34:40] presently in never forget who he is
[34:44] because that don't change him he's still
[34:47] the same yesterday today and forever
[34:49] so Exodus 14 and verse 8 and it says the
[34:53] Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king
[34:55] of Egypt and he pursued after the
[34:58] children of Israel and the children of
[34:59] Israel went out with a high hand but the
[35:03] Egyptians pursued after them all the
[35:05] horses and chariots of Pharaoh and his
[35:08] horsemen and his army and overtook them
[35:10] in Kampen by the sea and when Pharaoh
[35:13] drew nigh the children of Israel lifted
[35:15] up their eyes and behold the Egyptians
[35:18] marched after them and they were sore
[35:20] afraid
[35:21] and the children of Israel cried unto
[35:23] the Lord and they said unto Moses
[35:25] because there was no graves in Egypt has
[35:28] thou taken us away to die in the
[35:31] wilderness wherefore has thou dealt thus
[35:34] with us to carry us forth out of Egypt
[35:36] is not this the word that we did tell
[35:39] thee in Egypt saying let us alone
[35:42] that we may serve the Egyptians for it
[35:44] been better for us to serve the
[35:46] Egyptians and that we should die in the
[35:49] wilderness and Moses said to the people
[35:52] fear you not stand still and see the
[35:55] salvation of the Lord which he will show
[35:58] you today for the Egyptians whom you've
[36:01] seen today you'll see them again no more
[36:04] forever but the Lord shall fight for you
[36:07] and you shall hold your peace
[36:09] and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[36:11] cries down to me speak unto the children
[36:13] of Israel that they go forward but lift
[36:16] up thy rod and stretch out their hand
[36:19] over the sea and divide it and the
[36:21] children of Israel shall go and dry land
[36:23] to the midst of the sea and I behold I
[36:26] will hearken the hearts of the adju
[36:28] harden the hearts of the Egyptians and
[36:30] they shall follow them and I will get me
[36:33] honor upon Pharaoh and upon all his
[36:36] hosts upon his chariots and upon his
[36:39] horsemen and the Egyptians shall know
[36:42] that I am the lord that I have gotten
[36:44] the honor upon Pharaoh and upon his
[36:47] chariots and upon his horsemen and the
[36:50] angel of God went before the camp of
[36:53] Israel and removed and went behind them
[36:56] and the pillar of the cloud went before
[36:58] their face and stood behind them and it
[37:01] came between the camp of the Egyptians
[37:03] and the camp of Israel and it was a
[37:05] cloud and darkness to them but it gave
[37:08] light by night to these so that no one
[37:11] came near the other all night and Moses
[37:14] stretched out his hand over the sea and
[37:16] the Lord calls the sea to go back by and
[37:18] strong east wind all that night and made
[37:21] the sea dry land and the waters will
[37:23] divide it and the children of Israel
[37:26] went into the midst of the sea upon the
[37:28] dry ground and the waters were a wall
[37:30] unto them on the right hand and on their
[37:33] left and the Egyptians pursued and went
[37:35] in after them in the midst of the sea
[37:37] and all Pharaoh's horses his chariots
[37:41] and his horsemen and it came to pass and
[37:44] in the morning watch the Lord looked in
[37:48] the morning watched the Lord looked upon
[37:50] the hosts the Egyptians to the pillar of
[37:52] fire and out of the cloud and troubled
[37:55] the host of the Egyptians
[37:56] and took off their chariot wheels that
[37:59] they drive them heavenly so that the
[38:01] Egyptian said let us flee from the face
[38:03] of Israel for the Lord fight us for them
[38:06] against the Egyptians and the Lord said
[38:09] unto Moses stretch out their hand over
[38:11] the sea and the waters may come upon the
[38:14] Egyptians upon the chariots and upon
[38:16] their horsemen and Moses stretched forth
[38:18] his hand over the sea and the sea
[38:21] returned to his strength when the
[38:22] morning appeared and the Egyptians fled
[38:25] against it but the Lord overthrew the
[38:28] Egyptians in the midst of the sea and
[38:30] the waters returned and cover the
[38:32] chariots and the horsemen and all the
[38:35] host of Pharaoh that came unto the sea
[38:37] after them and there remained not so
[38:40] much as one of them hallelujah hey man
[38:44] we'll let you be seated
[38:47] just looking over some things today as
[38:49] we're facing the trials and the things
[38:52] that were going through his brother Tim
[38:54] talked about that the world that we
[38:56] lived in live in is not the world we
[38:58] lived in just a few days ago and there's
[39:01] trouble all around us and people in
[39:04] complete pandemonium and panicking and
[39:07] worried about where to go and what to do
[39:09] or what's the future or what's next and
[39:12] the only future that I can guarantee is
[39:15] a future in glory amen a future that's
[39:18] out of this world and I'm looking for
[39:21] that place and I'm looking for that lamp
[39:22] but you know brother Branham speaking
[39:24] about these things and I want to bring a
[39:26] few things of the things he may have
[39:28] faced in his day and and and what
[39:31] happened there
[39:31] he said when trouble begins to face you
[39:34] sickness on ever ham
[39:36] the angel of God comes up and it stands
[39:40] and goes between you and the sickness
[39:43] the angel of God amen this to go between
[39:46] you and the sickness to stand in the way
[39:49] and all the time challenging you to take
[39:52] God at His Word and this is what we read
[39:55] here as the children of Israel came to
[39:57] this place you know they'd already
[39:59] witnessed a God standing between them
[40:02] and the death angel is here as it would
[40:04] leave that to the Egyptian or even leave
[40:07] ship and start their journey towards the
[40:09] promised land they would they would
[40:11] already realize it was a God who could
[40:13] come and stand between them as he would
[40:15] tell them to put the blood over the
[40:17] doorpost and put the blood over the
[40:19] lintel and the doorpost I meant us to
[40:21] show a man the blood of a lamb that had
[40:24] been slain and there was to be inside
[40:26] see God would quarantine the children of
[40:28] Israel even in time of their plagues and
[40:30] the time of the death angel and he would
[40:32] put him in the place of safety and that
[40:34] was behind the blood and and and you
[40:37] know as they would as the death angel
[40:39] would begin to go through the land there
[40:40] was something that would stand between
[40:43] them and the Death Angel there they were
[40:45] told not to go into the streets that
[40:47] were told to not go into the land but to
[40:49] stay were the place that God had
[40:51] provided them and that he had given them
[40:54] something or a remedy or a token to
[40:57] stand between them to show the death
[40:59] angel that he had no right to enter into
[41:02] their promise or enter into their house
[41:04] and I'm thankful Eve today that we have
[41:07] the not a physical blood but we have a
[41:09] token the Holy Ghost that is upon our
[41:11] lives to stand there as the death angel
[41:13] is going through the land whether it be
[41:15] a virus or whether it be spiritual death
[41:18] which is worse than any kind of physical
[41:19] death but that there is something there
[41:22] to stand against him in our time of
[41:24] struggles in our time of rent that we
[41:27] can have a refuge we and so I said God
[41:29] had given Israel the promise and as we
[41:32] come here he told him that he was going
[41:34] to go to they're going to take them from
[41:36] here and take them to a land flowing
[41:38] with milk and honey and I've said this
[41:40] before God didn't mention to them about
[41:42] the Red Sea he didn't tell him about the
[41:44] dry dry of the bitter waters he didn't
[41:47] tell him about no food he didn't say
[41:49] nothing about no water he didn't say
[41:51] anything about the trials or
[41:52] tribulations that they were going to
[41:54] face he said I'm going to take you out
[41:56] and I'm going to take you in because God
[41:59] has the answer to every situation that
[42:01] we face this is nothing new to God
[42:03] plagues are nothing new to God sickness
[42:05] is nothing new to God there's nothing
[42:07] here that we're facing in this hour that
[42:09] God don't have the answer for or God
[42:12] don't have the remedy for God doesn't
[42:14] have the Amen the cure for God yet as I
[42:16] said God is a
[42:18] Lord God that heals all our diseases and
[42:20] so he told them I'm going to take you
[42:22] out and I'm going to take you in God had
[42:25] given Israel promise they were going to
[42:28] the land hallelujah and we have the same
[42:31] promise he said I'm going to take you
[42:34] out and he as many as taken us out of
[42:36] life's of sin and darkness and delayed
[42:39] taking us out of darkness of a man's
[42:41] creeds and dogmas and brought us out
[42:44] amen out of those things into a promise
[42:47] to show us that there is a land flowing
[42:49] with milk and honey
[42:50] there is a land of no death there is a
[42:52] land of no sorrow there is a land of no
[42:55] panic there is a land of no pandemics
[42:58] there is this land and that's where
[43:00] we're headed to we're not headed to a
[43:02] great financial you know benefits here
[43:05] or there setting the other whatever the
[43:07] government may have been able to give up
[43:08] their their benefits and god bless them
[43:11] for whatever they're trying to do but
[43:12] that's not our goal that's not what
[43:14] we're looking for we're looking to leave
[43:16] this place
[43:18] amen we have the same promise we're
[43:20] going to Atlanta but here came Pharaoh
[43:23] and all of its men to try to run Israel
[43:25] down and try to destroy them understand
[43:28] when the enemy comes it does not go
[43:31] unnoticed by God God knows about it he
[43:35] sees the plagues he sees the things that
[43:38] are going on this earth he he sees the
[43:40] atmospheres that we're in and he's seen
[43:42] the Israelis seen him coming before he
[43:45] even got there and what happened when he
[43:48] arrived when it when Pharaoh and his
[43:49] army arrived the angel of the Lord was
[43:52] there to carry them to the promised land
[43:54] he rose up from the camp and he went
[43:57] stood between them and the danger and he
[44:01] still does that I don't know he's still
[44:04] the same God today he's here to stand
[44:07] between you and the plagues that are
[44:09] falling he steer'd a stand between you
[44:11] in the sin of this world he's here to
[44:14] stand between you and the tormenting
[44:16] spirits and the demons have told me that
[44:18] comes against the children of God it
[44:20] seems like we're up against the flood
[44:22] here and it seemed like flooding on
[44:24] every side but he said when they play
[44:26] enemy comes in like a flood
[44:28] I will raise a standard against in that
[44:31] day Michael shall stand up hallelujah he
[44:36] will make a way for every sick person he
[44:38] will make a way he's already made the
[44:40] way and he's standing right here between
[44:43] you and trouble hallelujah what kind of
[44:47] confidence can we have tonight and he
[44:50] says I know he's here right now
[44:54] because his word declares he's here
[44:56] that's why we can have this confidence
[44:58] it doesn't matter if we get down to
[45:00] having two or three people he said where
[45:02] two or three are gathered there I'll be
[45:04] it doesn't matter what's going on around
[45:05] us he's here it doesn't matter if we're
[45:08] in financial trouble don't forget he's

[45:17] Jireh he hasn't changed his name he
[45:20] hasn't changed his attitude he's still
[45:22] here I know the devil wants us to food
[45:25] feed on the fear of this world and there
[45:27] is a lot of propaganda out there and a
[45:29] lot of fear-mongering and all those
[45:31] saying but turn your eyes back to the
[45:33] word his word declares he's here
[45:37] hallelujah and he's here standing

[56:38] bleeding for these people these
[56:40] Christians in that city those poor
[56:42] little children look God hates in the
[56:44] day that when all the curses are going
[56:47] away and there'll be no more sickness in
[56:49] no more sorrow we're headed to that land
[56:52] but we feel for those poor fathers and
[56:55] mothers tonight I don't feel for them
[56:56] knowing and experience of it I feel that
[56:59] Lord their poor hearts are crushed be
[57:01] merciful God I pray that the plague will
[57:05] leave this very night hallelujah I pray
[57:10] that the play will leave this very nice
[57:12] may there not be one more case broke out
[57:16] man stop now
[57:19] and may the enemy be turned back and
[57:21] cast into destruction
[57:23] may the angel of God stand over the city
[57:30] hallelujah
[57:31] I say God standing over every house
[57:33] standing over every home saying that
[57:36] whatever city that we know that when he
[57:39] stands every demon will scatter
[57:43] hallelujah every demon will scatter and
[57:47] when he's we see him stand and they see
[57:49] him lower the car listen this devil
[57:54] realized he ain't got it all what he
[57:56] thinks he has just a moment when that
[57:58] angel stands up he begins to tremble you
[58:01] think you might experience fear you
[58:03] ought to feel what the devil feels when
[58:05] you see Michael stand out and he pulled
[58:08] his sword for the God's people come on
[58:12] somebody and he stands against that
[58:14] cancer and he said cancer begins to
[58:17] tremble and run out of the temple
[58:20] hallelujah amen when he stands against
[58:22] sugar diabetes sure but whatever the
[58:25] case may be high blood pressure when he
[58:27] stands demons begin to tremble
[58:31] hallelujah I'm looking for a time that
[58:34] demons are going to tremble more than
[58:36] they ever have before because there's a
[58:38] people that's standing up on the Word of
[58:40] God and we ain't backing down we're not
[58:43] backing up we're going forward in Jesus
[58:46] name in Moses day as he was born
[58:53] alligators were fat because there's been
[58:56] fed all his children they were fat
[58:59] eating them little babies and he said no
[59:03] alligators just eating on him he said
[59:07] but yet during that time God put upon a
[59:09] mother's heart to place her baby right
[59:12] in death don't you see it was a type of
[59:16] Christ he went right into death but
[59:19] Aaron every one of my old alligators
[59:21] would come up to that little bitty Ark
[59:23] going down the river you know why they
[59:26] couldn't get to it why they couldn't eat
[59:29] that little baby there was an angel
[59:31] sitting there
[59:32] saying get away from here hallelujah he
[59:38] would just move a finger just stare at
[59:40] them with them angry eyes and said get
[59:42] away from here I don't know you don't
[59:45] think animals can't see into other
[59:46] realms we got we got it in the Bible
[59:48] where a donkey saw into another realm he
[59:50] saw an angel standing there hey man amen
[59:53] he was sitting on the basket he said and
[59:56] it was lined up down all the riverbanks
[59:58] because there was a promise floating
[1:00:00] down the river God had to make sure that
[1:00:03] promise was going to be fulfilled it
[1:00:05] didn't matter how many devils tried to
[1:00:06] stop it or how many Devils try to
[1:00:08] destroy how many Devils tried to kill it
[1:00:11] there was angels guarding that Ark it
[1:00:14] was standing between there that little
[1:00:16] baby that was helpless that bail baby
[1:00:18] they couldn't do nothing there's a crunk
[1:00:20] would've got ahold of that no one
[1:00:21] nothing the baby could do he was a baby
[1:00:23] he didn't have a gun he didn't have a
[1:00:25] bow he didn't have a rock he didn't
[1:00:27] happen to arms strong enough he had
[1:00:28] nothing he was helpless and you may feel
[1:00:31] helpless and I but don't forget your God
[1:00:34] ain't helpless your God ain't out of
[1:00:37] answers he knows every answer he knows
[1:00:40] every hard cry and he's able yes more
[1:00:43] than able he'll look at that cancer and
[1:00:46] said get out of here
[1:00:51] hallelujah and then when that happened
[1:00:54] he said see what happened God gives his
[1:00:58] angels charge to watch over his people
[1:01:01] don't you get scared honey
[1:01:05] hello holiday I'm honey I'm honey don't
[1:01:11] you get scared honey God is watching you
[1:01:15] the devil may try to do something to you
[1:01:18] but God is greater
[1:01:22] we need to remind the devil tonight God
[1:01:25] is greater hallelujah that that one may
[1:01:29] try to do something to you but God is
[1:01:31] greater alligators have to run away from
[1:01:33] that little basket when they saw the
[1:01:36] angel move he would say in Psalms 46
[1:01:45] God is our refuge and strength a very
[1:01:49] present help a very present help in
[1:01:53] trouble
[1:01:55] therefore will not we fear we were not
[1:02:00] yet no mean won't take precautions no
[1:02:02] different than we would take precautions
[1:02:04] when it's snow and ice out on the
[1:02:05] highways Amen people want to make the
[1:02:08] statement well people are going to do
[1:02:09] this because they're scared and they're
[1:02:11] afraid no we're doing this because we're
[1:02:13] Christians and the president has asked
[1:02:15] that we do this this is not a religious
[1:02:18] persecution they're shutting down bars
[1:02:19] for heaven's sake they're shut down
[1:02:23] sporting events are shutting down and
[1:02:25] bet losing billions of dollars willing
[1:02:27] to lose it
[1:02:29] hey man and I just feel as Christians we
[1:02:32] ought to do our our civic duties to try
[1:02:35] to help in the time of need at a time of
[1:02:37] struggle a man I believe that ought to
[1:02:39] be what we do you know somebody maybe
[1:02:42] you've seen there somebody shared this
[1:02:43] with me if I can if I can bring it up
[1:02:45] real quick here but about Martin Luther
[1:02:50] how that how that he handled himself in
[1:02:53] the time of plagues I know I got to hear
[1:02:56] somewhere he up to me Haywood he would
[1:03:00] take his stand when he was you know as
[1:03:03] we know one of the messengers seven
[1:03:05] church ages he said I also ask God
[1:03:08] mercifully this was during the the black
[1:03:10] death plague he said I shall ask God
[1:03:13] mercifully to protect us hey man then I
[1:03:17] shall fumigate help purify the air
[1:03:20] administrate medicine and take it I'll
[1:03:23] so avoid places in persons where my
[1:03:25] present is not needed in order not to
[1:03:28] become contaminated contaminated and
[1:03:30] thus perchance inflict & purtz loot
[1:03:34] others and so calls their death as a
[1:03:36] result of my negligent if God should
[1:03:38] wish to take me he shall surely find me
[1:03:41] and I've done what he's expected of me
[1:03:45] Helen that sounds like a real messenger
[1:03:47] to me and so I'm not responsible for
[1:03:50] either my own death or in doing so I'm
[1:03:53] not responsible for either my own death
[1:03:55] or death of others if my neighbor needs
[1:03:58] me however I shall not avoid place or
[1:04:01] person I shall go freely as stated above
[1:04:04] see this is such a god-fearing faith
[1:04:07] because it is neither brash nor fool
[1:04:09] hardly and does not tempt God hallelujah
[1:04:14] amen so we're not facing where we he's a
[1:04:17] very present help in trouble so he knew
[1:04:21] we would be in trouble but in the
[1:04:23] trouble he's helped therefore we will
[1:04:26] not fear we will do what was necessary
[1:04:28] we'll take precautions we'll do what we
[1:04:30] have to do but we're not going to fear
[1:04:32] this thing the worst thing same thing
[1:04:35] can do upon us fins up inject you with a
[1:04:38] bunch of fear
[1:04:39] amen it's not fear that we're leaning on
[1:04:41] we're leaning on the everlasting ain't
[1:04:43] words of our lover hey men of what God's
[1:04:45] Word has spoke to us though the earth be
[1:04:48] removed and though the mountains be
[1:04:49] carried in the midst of the sea though
[1:04:51] the waters thereof roar and be troubled
[1:04:52] though the mountains shake with a
[1:04:54] swelling thereof there is a river
[1:04:58] hallelujah the streams were up shall
[1:05:01] make glad the City of God the holy place
[1:05:04] of the Tabernacles of the Most High and
[1:05:05] God is in the midst of her glories in
[1:05:11] the midst of her and she shall not be
[1:05:14] moved
[1:05:15] God shall help her the Lord who fights
[1:05:20] for us the Lord is a man of Lord that's
[1:05:26] what he was saying leads to invited fate
[1:05:28] rolling he said I want to have my honor
[1:05:30] upon them I want to show them Who I am
[1:05:33] in battle you think that doesn't learned
[1:05:36] it already but there's dumb enough to
[1:05:37] follow after but here they are Psalms 91
[1:05:41] and verse 1 as we read heads we've read
[1:05:44] Sunday he that dwelleth in the secret
[1:05:46] place of the Most High shall abide in
[1:05:49] the shadow of the Almighty I will say of
[1:05:52] the Lord he is my refuge in my fortress
[1:05:55] my god in him will I trust amen
[1:05:59] I'm gonna trust what he says before
[1:06:01] FoxNews says it or CNN says it or
[1:06:04] anybody else says it hallelujah I'm
[1:06:07] gonna trust what he said sure
[1:06:09] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:06:11] snare of the Fowler and from the noisome
[1:06:13] pestilence he shall cover thee with his
[1:06:15] feathers and under his wings shalt thou
[1:06:18] trust his truth shall be thy shield and
[1:06:20] buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the
[1:06:22] terror by night nor the arrow that flies
[1:06:24] by day nor the pestilence that walk in
[1:06:27] darkness nor for destruction that
[1:06:29] wasteth at noonday a thousand may fall
[1:06:31] at thy side and ten thousand at thy
[1:06:33] right hand but it shall not come nigh
[1:06:36] thee only with on I shall behold and see
[1:06:42] the reward of the wicked because thou
[1:06:44] has made the Lord which is my refuge
[1:06:47] even the most high thy habitation
[1:06:49] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:06:51] shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
[1:06:53] for he shall give his angels charge it's
[1:06:58] a charge it's a battle it is you ever
[1:07:02] heard or charge he will give his angels
[1:07:05] charge over thee to keep thee in all thy
[1:07:08] ways they shall bear thee up in their
[1:07:10] hands lest a desk that's a foot against
[1:07:12] a stone
[1:07:13] thou shalt tread upon the lion in the
[1:07:15] adder and the young lion and dragon
[1:07:16] shalt thou trample under feet because he
[1:07:20] said it's love upon me therefore will I
[1:07:22] deliver him and I will set him on high
[1:07:25] because he had known my name he shall
[1:07:27] call upon me and I will answer him I
[1:07:30] trust what he says I will be with him in
[1:07:33] trouble I will deliver him and honor him
[1:07:36] with long life eternal life that's the
[1:07:40] life I'm longing for I mean I don't care
[1:07:43] nothing buddy live in Haiti or Haiti
[1:07:44] five if I do so beer but I'm looking for
[1:07:47] a long ride that long life is not this
[1:07:49] life that long life is eternal life and
[1:07:53] show him my salvation Noah in the day of
[1:08:00] turmoil I don't know I know who he
[1:08:03] represents but there's also four aspects
[1:08:07] of it that represents us where the
[1:08:09] Branham would take it and he would use
[1:08:10] it we're not the people that's gonna go
[1:08:13] through the tribulation but that don't
[1:08:15] mean we're not gonna go through hard
[1:08:16] times we're not exempt from hard time
[1:08:18] we're not exempt from economic downturns
[1:08:21] we're not
[1:08:21] from sickness and things is going on but
[1:08:24] we have a word he was he was given a
[1:08:28] specific instructions specific
[1:08:31] instructions how to build the ark he was
[1:08:33] told what would to take he was told what
[1:08:35] to put in it how he was to pitch it and
[1:08:38] it was to soak it with a resin and this
[1:08:41] actually brother Brennan would talk
[1:08:43] about he said means to atone this pitch
[1:08:45] means an atonement over Leviticus the
[1:08:48] same word was used for pitch in Genesis
[1:08:51] and lividity's because it uses a tone to
[1:08:53] make an atonement and now a tone is to
[1:08:56] stand between so this art was given to
[1:08:59] him to stand between him and the
[1:09:02] judgments that was against the world and
[1:09:03] the pitch that he was to pitch it with
[1:09:06] the gopher wooden art and that pitch
[1:09:08] would keep out or atone the believer
[1:09:10] from the wrath no it could not get into
[1:09:13] the wrath the waters of judgment neither
[1:09:15] could the waters of judgment get into
[1:09:17] Noah because there was a Tolman that
[1:09:19] stood between him and judgment and he
[1:09:22] said the believer in Christ is also
[1:09:24] safely secured not upon the merits of
[1:09:27] ourselves but his obedience to walk into
[1:09:30] the place or the art provided Amen
[1:09:33] wasn't when the only thing Noah had to
[1:09:35] do was get in the ark he didn't even
[1:09:37] have to shut the door God did that but
[1:09:39] walk in he said that's all the believer
[1:09:41] does is walk by faith in Christ and God
[1:09:45] takes care of the rest of it he that
[1:09:47] hears my words and believeth on him that
[1:09:49] sent me hath eternal life and shall not
[1:09:52] come into the judgment there's something
[1:09:56] a buffer our atonement that's been paid
[1:09:58] it's something that stands between you
[1:10:01] and the sin of this world and the wrath
[1:10:04] that's to come on this world he said let
[1:10:07] the judgment rock if it won't sue he
[1:10:09] said I imagined some time the art would
[1:10:11] seem to be standing on his in who I've
[1:10:14] been in a boat before in some pretty
[1:10:16] good waves and I didn't enjoy
[1:10:18] I couldn't imagine the ways that Noah
[1:10:21] went through and how bad it was and the
[1:10:24] turmoil that he went through but God had
[1:10:26] told him to get in the ark and if he
[1:10:28] done everything God said God said you'll
[1:10:30] make it through
[1:10:31] I made an atonement I made in a way of
[1:10:34] escape I've given you a place that you
[1:10:36] can go in the times of these as issues
[1:10:39] that are taking place he said imagine
[1:10:41] sometimes the ark was standing on in
[1:10:43] upside-down seemed like everything else
[1:10:46] seemed to be falling apart but Noah was
[1:10:49] safe that pitch stood between him and
[1:10:53] the judgment and he said today the blood
[1:10:57] of Jesus stands between us and all the
[1:11:01] judgment hallelujah
[1:11:03] every man comes in the world born in sin
[1:11:06] shaped iniquity comes the world speaking
[1:11:08] lies undone unlovely ungodly away from
[1:11:10] God and the alienated without hope
[1:11:12] without Christ dying going to a sinner's
[1:11:14] grave ready for judgment but then the
[1:11:16] word comes along sharper than II to it
[1:11:19] tonight cuts the tree down hears it out
[1:11:21] cuts out the stickers and all the thorn
[1:11:23] cuts the best part out of it that's real
[1:11:25] pliable and puts it in the hands of the
[1:11:28] Builder Christ then evil his life is now
[1:11:31] poured out at Calvary through the
[1:11:33] shedding of the blood and he made an
[1:11:35] atonement to protect the man that's in
[1:11:38] the Ark of safety
[1:11:39] my man just says well I believe the word
[1:11:41] I'll just take this he said but without
[1:11:43] the blood you're left to the world no
[1:11:47] matter how much you're in the heart
[1:11:48] how much arc or how much bones you got
[1:11:50] you've got to get the pitch the Holy
[1:11:54] Spirit and soak it all in this is the
[1:11:58] time to be doing that I said Lord let me
[1:12:00] draw closer to you let your Holy Spirit
[1:12:03] just wave over me and let me just let it
[1:12:06] go about you know you begin to realize
[1:12:07] things ain't so everything so world
[1:12:11] ain't what it used to be things are
[1:12:12] going on don't mean that miss world
[1:12:14] don't mean nothing there's a world in a
[1:12:17] moment okay as we've seen can be flipped
[1:12:19] on its ear there's no safe place in this
[1:12:22] world there's no 401k safe there's no
[1:12:25] bank safe there's nothing safe I mean
[1:12:27] for goodness sake we found that toilet
[1:12:29] paper ain't safe but we know a tree that
[1:12:38] was cut down and he was beaten he took
[1:12:43] the stripes
[1:12:45] he took the judgment Oh God a man of war
[1:12:51] that he might have his glory upon
[1:12:55] Satan's Kingdom
[1:12:57] he took the thing that the liquid of
[1:13:00] water and blood and then of spirit could
[1:13:04] come out of his body so that we could be
[1:13:06] sealed to the day of our Redemption that
[1:13:09] we could stand the test that we could
[1:13:11] stand when all hell is against us that
[1:13:14] he would make a way of escape a blood
[1:13:16] was released to stand between you and
[1:13:19] affliction to stand between you and
[1:13:22] sickness there is a blood they don't
[1:13:27] matter what the devil in what his name
[1:13:28] is this blood is greater whatever
[1:13:31] disease this blood is greater he's still
[1:13:33] the Lord God that heals all diseases
[1:13:36] hallelujah the next arc that was spoken
[1:13:39] of as we talked about was Moses the
[1:13:41] Bible declared that that little basket
[1:13:43] to be in art notice it was provided by a
[1:13:46] mother the one that gave him the birth
[1:13:48] not through some seminary not something
[1:13:51] through some theological experience but
[1:13:53] the one who gives the believer birth
[1:13:56] prepares an art for him hallelujah this
[1:14:01] art that I got wasn't prepared by even
[1:14:03] like tabernacle he wasn't prepared by
[1:14:05] some man he wasn't prepared by some
[1:14:07] theologian or some intellectual
[1:14:09] conception this art was prepared by the
[1:14:12] one who gave birth to me he built it
[1:14:16] specifically for Laodicea he knows
[1:14:18] exactly what we're going through and the
[1:14:21] Ark was a type holding down through Noah
[1:14:23] holding down through Moses holding down
[1:14:25] there every situation through the Bible
[1:14:28] as a buffer and something to hold
[1:14:30] against the plagues and the storms and
[1:14:32] the bastion against the boat but let me
[1:14:34] tell you this boat will hold this Ark
[1:14:37] will hold she's not going down she's
[1:14:40] going up in desires Hill into the glory
[1:14:44] of God that mother would weave that Ark
[1:14:49] with some flak stalkers little corn
[1:14:51] stalks that they would have push it
[1:14:56] across the river
[1:14:58] never no one if she's if she was gonna
[1:15:00] see her baby again or not
[1:15:03] and she slide slammed it with pitch same
[1:15:09] word pitch to atone the little baby
[1:15:13] Moses laid in the basket pushed out into
[1:15:17] the judgment of waters he said water
[1:15:20] always means the sickness thickness and
[1:15:22] multitudes of people a little fellow out
[1:15:25] there probably a little cover over his
[1:15:26] face out in the Ark out of the Nile and
[1:15:29] reeds and bushes bullrushes and
[1:15:31] alligators and everything all around the
[1:15:33] Nile the rains and the storms have
[1:15:36] blowing through there the gales but a
[1:15:38] little rock art riding it out little
[1:15:40] Moses looking up towards a little
[1:15:42] starlit skies night wind to blow and
[1:15:44] Howlin he said well what was happening
[1:15:46] he was directing that boat to this right
[1:15:48] place oh now the jumping crocodiles
[1:15:51] going on in the basket but he was safe
[1:15:53] protected standing between wasn't
[1:15:55] atonement between him and all the gates
[1:15:58] and the gales and heavy winds the devil
[1:16:00] could sin nothing would upset that
[1:16:02] little heart he floated right through it
[1:16:04] and he said I could see the great Holy
[1:16:06] Spirit standing above it he said I can

[1:16:18] singing Jesus keep me near the cross or
[1:16:20] whatever was all the Devils in hell
[1:16:22] couldn't sink it because it was built
[1:16:25] according to God's instruction and there
[1:16:27] was an atonement standing between the
[1:16:29] judgment and mercy and every believer
[1:16:31] today now matter how hard they may seem
[1:16:34] how hard life may see as long as you're
[1:16:37] in Christ Jesus

[1:16:44] Christ
[1:16:45] the devil's can try to come and turn
[1:16:48] every Dale and hair loose on you but

[1:18:45] God today a man nothing let's call him
[1:18:48] spot surprise he knows what is going on
[1:18:51] and he's here to stand between we can
[1:18:53] see when he stood with the prophet of
[1:18:55] God as as that maniac would make a
[1:18:57] challenge and he would challenge him and
[1:19:00] he would come and spit in his face and
[1:19:01] and make the challenge and say you know
[1:19:04] you're a hypocrite your deceiver you
[1:19:06] stand up here and act like before these
[1:19:07] people impose yourself to be a man sent
[1:19:09] from God I'll show how much your sinful
[1:19:11] my break every bone in your frail body
[1:19:13] tonight well physically speaking he was
[1:19:15] certainly able to do it he weighed
[1:19:17] nearly 300 pounds I suppose about 6 foot
[1:19:20] 2 and arms big he said his eyes were say
[1:19:22] his teeth scissor together I kept on
[1:19:24] speaking he rushed towards me to run me
[1:19:27] over and said I'll break every bone in
[1:19:28] your body he said you better know what
[1:19:31] your heart or what you're talking about
[1:19:32] them times there's no chance there for
[1:19:34] you to bluff yourself you better just
[1:19:36] let God have his way
[1:19:39] hallelujah so you just just blood don't
[1:19:41] Bluff he said you better let God have
[1:19:43] his way
[1:19:44] he promised me when he sent me he would
[1:19:46] take care of it and it's up to him to do
[1:19:49] it and he will do it in every battle
[1:19:54] hallelujah he will do it in every battle
[1:19:57] so I turned around him and I stood there
[1:19:59] for a few minutes a second or two and I
[1:20:03] called I called he called me a snake in
[1:20:04] the grass and he spit right in my face
[1:20:07] and I started to say something like I
[1:20:10] wouldn't do that my friend I was gonna
[1:20:12] say that but instead the angel of the
[1:20:14] Lord came whirling in and he stood
[1:20:17] between us and he said tonight you'll
[1:20:21] fall over my feet and you'll bow to the
[1:20:24] name of the Lord Jesus and it wasn't me
[1:20:26] that was God so both made prophecies
[1:20:30] both make challenges both spirits now
[1:20:34] who was right was the next thing and he
[1:20:37] said I'll show you whose feet I bow to
[1:20:39] and he run behind he drawn his big old
[1:20:42] fist everybody just felt behind of
[1:20:44] course all those demons sitting there
[1:20:46] that was their legion it was love
[1:20:48] watching and he sure I serves I'm
[1:20:50] talking to spiritual people that was
[1:20:52] Legion and then I went to the fella like
[1:20:54] the life from the days of oh he's I show
[1:20:56] you feed off all over and as he drew
[1:20:59] back I said Satan come out of the man
[1:21:01] and he made a big scream threw up his
[1:21:03] hands and his eyes went that way and
[1:21:05] felt till the police had to take him off
[1:21:07] my feet and they thought he was a dead
[1:21:09] man and he said as he was raised he
[1:21:11] delivers and no sorry worship that
[1:21:13] spirit he won't give it up but I would
[1:21:16] you have him move him off my feet and so
[1:21:19] when they got there I turned to the
[1:21:21] audience and said as I was saying what
[1:21:27] was he saying faith is the substance of
[1:21:30] things hoped for went right back to the
[1:21:32] word
[1:21:34] not to fear not to worry not to wonder
[1:21:37] if there's anybody else there but right
[1:21:39] back to the word as I was saying faith
[1:21:43] is the substance of things hoped for and
[1:21:46] while I was speaking a man sitting the
[1:21:48] wheelchair raised up a lady on the
[1:21:50] stretcher jumped up and the next in a
[1:21:53] few minutes there was people healed all
[1:21:55] over the building and the next morning
[1:21:57] had to get a big truck people see and
[1:22:00] only believe walking behind the big
[1:22:02] truck full of stretchers and wheelchairs
[1:22:04] and everything what was it the chief of
[1:22:06] that tribe of demons had made the
[1:22:08] challenge and lost I want to give news
[1:22:12] to the devil you're gonna lose because
[1:22:16] you're not challenging just the bride of
[1:22:18] Jesus Christ you're challenging the
[1:22:20] captain of our Lord's host and he
[1:22:24] accepts your challenge and when the
[1:22:27] Spirit of God struck the building
[1:22:29] everyone was healed hallelujah he would
[1:22:36] say in Zechariah's we bring this down
[1:22:37] and Zachariah to one I lifted up my eyes
[1:22:42] again and looked and behold a man with a
[1:22:45] measuring line in his hand then said I

[1:22:53] breadth thereof and what is the length
[1:22:56] thereof and behold the angel that talked
[1:22:58] with me went forth and another angel
[1:23:00] went out to meet him and said unto him
