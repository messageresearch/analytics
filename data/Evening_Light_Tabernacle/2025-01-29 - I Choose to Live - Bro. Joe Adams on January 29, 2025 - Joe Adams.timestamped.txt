[41:38] in Jesus name amen God bless you this
[41:41] evening certainly great to be here with
[41:44] you again
[41:46] tonight okay that's when you amen the
[41:48] word simple little like brother Aaron
[41:51] said Sunday Lord class participation
[41:53] kind of goes the long way doesn't it
[41:55] brother Aaron when you're a teacher
[41:57] amen well we're certainly glad to be
[41:58] here we're going to we're going to look
[42:00] here at a thought tonight um come out of
[42:02] Joshua 24:14 and just to kind of set the
[42:06] stage for tonight when I was in Kentucky
[42:08] several weeks ago I was there we drove
[42:10] up Joseph and I drove up on a Saturday
[42:13] and it snowed cats and dogs through the
[42:15] night and nice and the next morning and
[42:17] we couldn't have service on that Sunday
[42:19] but the Lord woke me up at 3:00 early
[42:21] Sunday morning with this thought that he
[42:24] inspired for the service tonight and so
[42:26] things that are going to be said have
[42:28] been spoken long before anything since
[42:31] I've been home so I just want to preface
[42:34] that but I want to speak to you on I
[42:35] choose to
[42:38] live I choose to live and we're going to
[42:40] go here in Joshua 24 and verse1 14 says
[42:43] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[42:45] him in sincerity and truth and put away
[42:49] the gods which your father served on the
[42:50] other side of the flood and in Egypt and
[42:53] serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil
[42:56] unto you to serve the Lord notice now
[42:58] Joshua's given them a choice if it seem
[43:01] evil for you to serve the Lord choose
[43:03] you this day whom you will serve whether
[43:06] the gods which your father served that
[43:08] were on the other side of the flood or
[43:10] the gods of the amorites in whose land
[43:12] you dwell but as for me and my house we
[43:15] will serve the
[43:17] Lord and the people answered and said
[43:19] God forbid that we should forsake the
[43:21] Lord to serve other gods for the Lord
[43:23] Our God he it is that brought us up and
[43:27] brought us up and our fathers out of the
[43:29] land of Egypt from the house of bondage
[43:31] which did those great signs in our sight
[43:33] and preserved Us in all the way wherein
[43:35] he went and all the people through whom
[43:38] we pass and the Lord drave out from
[43:40] before us all the people even the
[43:42] amorites which dwelt in the land
[43:44] therefore we will also serve the Lord
[43:46] for he is our God so now Joshua is
[43:49] making his declaration and the people
[43:51] are making their declaration notice and
[43:54] Joshua warns the people he says notice
[43:57] in Joshua 24:19 and Joshua said unto the
[44:00] people ye cannot serve the Lord for he
[44:02] is a holy God he's a jealous God he will
[44:07] not forgive your transgressions nor your
[44:11] sins if you forsake the Lord and serve
[44:14] strange Gods then he would turn and do
[44:17] you hurt and consume you after that he
[44:19] has done you good and the people said
[44:22] unto Joshua nay but we will serve the
[44:26] Lord and Joshua said unto the people you
[44:28] are witnesses against yourselves that
[44:30] you have chosen you have chosen you the
[44:32] Lord to serve him and they saidwe are
[44:35] witnesses now therefore put away said he
[44:37] the strange Gods which are among you and
[44:39] incline your heart unto the Lord Our God
[44:42] or the Lord God of Israel and the people
[44:43] said unto Joshua the Lord Our God will
[44:46] we serve and his voice will we obey so
[44:48] Joshua made a covenant with the people
[44:50] that day and he set them a statute and
[44:53] an ordinance and sheim and Joshua wrote
[44:55] these words in the book of the law and
[44:57] took a great Stone and set it up under a
[44:59] oak that was by the sanctuary of the
[45:00] Lord and Joshua said unto the people
[45:03] behold this Stone shall be a witness
[45:04] unto us for it has heard all the words
[45:07] of the Lord which he spake unto us and
[45:09] it shall be therefore witness unto you
[45:12] lest you deny your God and in verse 28
[45:14] so Joshua let the people depart every
[45:17] man unto his inheritance God bless you
[45:19] you can have your seats
[45:25] tonight as we look at this I just want
[45:28] to I just want to preface this I'm not
[45:30] sure how long we will go uh with the
[45:33] message tonight the service I do just
[45:34] want to kind of PR if I do go over the
[45:37] allotted time please forgive me just
[45:38] bear with me and just receive from the
[45:40] word tonight but this is what the Lord
[45:42] laid on my heart for the service tonight
[45:43] and I don't believe that God wakes any
[45:45] man up in the middle of the night
[45:46] especially 3:00 in the morning and lays
[45:49] something so heavy on his heart and so
[45:51] the next morning as I couldn't have the
[45:52] service I began to study and prepare and
[45:54] all week I studied this thought out now
[45:57] not knowing that I would speak it here
[45:58] for you tonight but God knows and so
[46:00] we're going to jump back into the
[46:02] background of why Joshua's calling all
[46:04] the Israel together and it says in
[46:06] Joshua 23 and verse1 and it came to pass
[46:10] a long time after the Lord had given
[46:12] rest unto Israel from all their enemies
[46:15] round about that Joshua wax old and
[46:17] stricken in age so Joshua is realizing
[46:20] he's not going to be around much longer
[46:22] therefore he assum or he ca all of
[46:26] Israel to together and the Bible says in
[46:29] verse two he says Joshua called for all
[46:31] of Israel he called for their Elders for
[46:34] their heads for their judges for their
[46:36] officers and he said unto them I am old
[46:39] and stricken in age and you have seen
[46:42] all that the Lord your God had done at
[46:44] all the nations because of you for the
[46:46] Lord your God is he that has fought for
[46:48] you behold I have divided unto you the
[46:51] land by a lot of these nations that
[46:52] remain to be an inheritance for your
[46:54] tribes from Jordan with all the nations
[46:57] that I have cut off even into the great
[46:59] sea Westward and the Lord your God he
[47:01] shall expel them before you and drive
[47:03] them out of your sight and you shall
[47:05] possess their land as the Lord your God
[47:08] has promised unto you be you therefore
[47:10] very
[47:11] courageous you know I think sometimes we
[47:13] need to be reminded to be courageous in
[47:15] this hour that we're living in but we
[47:17] find Joshua begins to go back he's
[47:19] getting old and maybe he's realizing
[47:21] he's not going to be around much longer
[47:24] and he's summoned the leaders of the
[47:26] church
[47:28] he summoned the leaders in the home he's
[47:32] called all the elders he's called all
[47:35] the officers he's called all the judges
[47:38] this ain't just for the officials at the
[47:40] church but he's called All of
[47:43] Israel and he's telling them he's kind
[47:46] of maybe what he's doing is giving his
[47:47] new year's declaration or his new year's
[47:50] message and making a declaration I'm not
[47:52] going to be with you much
[47:54] longer and he's begin to to to to
[47:57] express himself before the people and
[48:00] he's telling them be courageous keep all
[48:02] that is written in the book of the law
[48:03] of Moses that you turn not aside from
[48:06] their form to the right or to the left
[48:09] and we find in verse seven that you come
[48:11] not among these nations these that
[48:14] remain among you neither make mention of
[48:16] the name of their gods nor cause to
[48:18] swear by them neither the serve them nor
[48:21] bow yourselves unto them so otherwise
[48:25] Joshua is tell telling the people that
[48:28] God is calling you for a total
[48:30] separation from
[48:33] unbelief God is calling you when I place
[48:35] you into that land you got to be
[48:37] separate from their gods you got to be
[48:40] separated from their thinking you got to
[48:42] be separated from their worship you got
[48:44] to be separated from all
[48:49] unbelief notice what he says here when
[48:52] you come un these nations neither make
[48:54] mention of the name of their God
[48:57] gos nor cause to swear by them neither
[49:00] serve them nor by yourselves unto them
[49:03] but cleave unto the Lord your God as you
[49:06] have done unto this day for he had
[49:08] driven out from before you great Nations
[49:10] and strong but as for you no man has
[49:12] been able to stand before you unto this
[49:16] day so he's reminded them who they
[49:20] are I think this is a very pivotable
[49:23] point in the is Israel as their
[49:26] existence as a nation because they come
[49:28] through a great prophet like Moses and
[49:31] no doubt many still look to Moses Moses
[49:35] this and Moses that and Mo and yeah
[49:37] thank God Joshua followed in the
[49:39] footsteps of Moses but you recognize the
[49:42] spirit they're not they didn't just keep
[49:44] pointing back to Moses now the spirit
[49:46] was on Joshua and Joshua was anointed to
[49:49] place them in the land Joshua was
[49:51] anointed to take the people and divide
[49:54] the land unto them and he warns them
[49:56] when you come into this land don't bow
[49:59] down to their gods don't take unto their
[50:01] children don't take their son for your
[50:03] daughters or your daughters and give to
[50:05] their sons he said be separated sayeth
[50:08] the
[50:09] Lord and brother Bram tells us here in
[50:12] the message Abraham he said God called
[50:15] Abraham when he was 75 years old and he
[50:18] said separate yourself from your
[50:21] Kindred he say isn't it strange how that
[50:24] today how God called for separation but
[50:27] we call for
[50:28] mixers that's right people when they're
[50:31] choosing their Pastor you that do so he
[50:33] says they want a little slick fella you
[50:35] know that'll take a little social drink
[50:37] and not condemn smoking a few other
[50:39] things here a good guy that'll mix with
[50:42] the
[50:43] crowd now let's just say for instance
[50:45] tonight maybe in 10 15 years we got to
[50:48] elect another
[50:50] Pastor do you want somebody that's going
[50:52] to take a social
[50:54] drink come on do you want somebody
[50:56] that's going to get out there and mix
[50:57] and maybe you know Saturday night he has
[50:59] to go to the bar and get a little fix
[51:01] but Sunday morning he's here you expect
[51:03] him to hear the preach the word right
[51:06] you wouldn't accept that as a pastor so
[51:09] let me just flip the coin for you
[51:10] tonight so if that's what your
[51:12] expectation is for the ministry then why
[51:15] should the ministry not expect the same
[51:17] out of you
[51:18] tonight oh it's wrong when we preach
[51:21] hard and we preach a clothline religion
[51:23] or or we preach hell fire and brimstone
[51:26] but when trying to do is save you from
[51:28] the Wrath and separate you from the
[51:30] things of the world cuz God is calling
[51:33] for a total separation from
[51:36] unbelief see God calls for a total
[51:39] separation from the things of the world
[51:42] come out from among them the Bible says
[51:44] be you separate sayth the Lord and I
[51:46] will receive
[51:48] you see not a mixer a separator the Holy
[51:51] Ghost spake separate me Paul and
[51:53] Barnabas to the work a separation God
[51:56] seg Ates his people that's right from
[51:59] wrong see Abraham was to separate
[52:02] himself and to sojourn in a Strange Land
[52:05] that he knew not of isn't that a
[52:07] beautiful picture today when God by
[52:09] election called you to his beloved then
[52:12] it immediately God speaks to you to
[52:14] separate yourself from the old crowd the
[52:16] pool room the Stitch and sew parties
[52:18] where they tell jokes and carry on a
[52:22] separation see Abraham had it kind of
[52:24] rough brother says and possessing all
[52:26] things things but lot had it easy so
[52:29] there was a difference between Abraham
[52:31] and lot let me just share what brother
[52:33] Braham says about lot's mentality was
[52:36] Lot says you know what I'm a Believer
[52:39] yeah it's okay I'm a Believer I believe
[52:42] God I believe what you know he spoke to
[52:44] my uncle Abraham and I believe he's
[52:46] right that we need to come out and he
[52:48] said and lot went down to Sodom thinking
[52:51] I'm just a believer I believe it'll be
[52:54] okay I can go down there but God called
[52:57] Abraham to
[53:00] separate and God is calling us tonight
[53:03] to
[53:04] separate he said when God called Abraham
[53:06] he called him to separate himself from
[53:09] everything and that's what we have to
[53:12] do God calls us for a total separation
[53:15] from sin come out from among it be not
[53:18] partakers of it shun it the very
[53:20] appearance of evil separation completely
[53:23] annihilated stay your distance away from
[53:26] it don't tread on its grounds no matter
[53:29] how nice it
[53:31] looks so we find young people you know
[53:34] they they get curious when they get to
[53:35] be their teenage years 16 17 18 young
[53:39] boys young girls and you know they think
[53:41] well I go to church on Wednesday and I
[53:42] go to church on Sunday and my daddy's a
[53:45] deacon or my mom's doing this and you
[53:46] know we got a part to play in the church
[53:48] and yet their hearts really not in it
[53:50] and their foot one foot's in the church
[53:52] door and the other foot's in the world
[53:57] let me tell you you can't play that
[54:00] game God is calling for total
[54:05] separation and we find many Believers
[54:08] today have the same mentality and
[54:11] attitude as lot I believe God man yeah
[54:15] didn't you hear what brother Aaron said
[54:17] Sunday that was a masterpiece service I
[54:20] was there I amen I believe God I believe
[54:23] his word I believe the message I believe
[54:25] brother was a prophet and yet they're
[54:28] still waiting in
[54:30] sin some of them are so professed
[54:33] Believers that they're so spiritual
[54:35] brother that they can't even darken the
[54:38] door of the
[54:39] church but yet they profess I believe
[54:42] his word I believe God then what about
[54:45] forsake not the assembly together come
[54:48] on Church don't get quiet on me
[54:51] tonight but we finally oh they they they
[54:54] profess this and you know they got one
[54:56] foot in the church door on Wednesday
[54:58] night they're there on Sunday they there
[55:01] and the Bible says you know with their
[55:02] mouth they profess me but the hearts are
[55:05] so far
[55:07] away God is wanting to get your heart
[55:10] right where your mouth is first John and
[55:13] 2 and verse1 15 the Bible says love not
[55:15] the world you say oh brother Joe here we
[55:18] go again we think we just try to beat
[55:21] the young people up this it's not just a
[55:22] young person message or a young person
[55:24] scripture it says love not the world
[55:27] neither the things that are in the world
[55:28] if any man love the world then the love
[55:31] of the father is not in him for all that
[55:34] is in the world the lust of the Flesh
[55:36] and the lust of the eyes and the pride
[55:38] of life is not of the father but is of
[55:41] the world and the world passeth away the
[55:44] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[55:46] of God abideth forever so let's look in
[55:49] the in verse 16 here it says the lust of
[55:52] the flesh now this word lust here means
[55:55] desire
[55:58] y'all awake tonight it means
[56:02] craving it means longing desire for that
[56:07] which is
[56:09] forbidden and a lot of times when we
[56:11] think about lust immediately our minds
[56:13] goes to sexual thoughts or sexual
[56:16] connotation with this but you can lust
[56:18] for money you can lust for position you
[56:21] can lust for power you can lust for
[56:24] vengeance you can lust for beauty you
[56:27] can lust for
[56:28] acceptance but you say oh brother Joe
[56:31] come on I don't love the
[56:32] [Music]
[56:33] world all right well let's look at this
[56:35] in verse
[56:37] 15 there's two words
[56:39] here love not the world neither the
[56:42] things that are in the world if any man
[56:44] loved the world let's stop right there
[56:46] that word love there and the second word
[56:48] love there is a gabo
[56:50] love all right so that word there means
[56:53] to welcome it means to entertain it
[56:55] means to be be fond of to love dearly to
[56:58] be well pleased to be contented with
[57:00] with the thing to Delight in it says and
[57:04] if that's the case then the love
[57:09] Agape affection benevolence the love of
[57:13] the father is not in him so when we read
[57:15] it again love not the world or entertain
[57:19] not the world neither the things are in
[57:21] the world if any man is in love or in
[57:24] fond of or is pleased with or is
[57:26] contented with the world then the
[57:28] affections of the father is not in him
[57:32] see God is calling for his children God
[57:35] is calling for his bride to be separated
[57:38] from the world church we can't be yoked
[57:41] up in the world and expecting to go in a
[57:43] rapture we can't be yoked up with the
[57:45] world and the ideas of the world and
[57:47] expect God to pour out blessing upon
[57:49] blessing upon us God is calling for
[57:54] separation brother B says when he calls
[57:56] the people he calls for a total
[57:58] separation from the things of the world
[58:00] Annihilation from worldly things
[58:01] separate yourself and God will bless you
[58:06] yes sir see God's chosen ones are
[58:09] commanded to come out among them be ye
[58:10] separate sayith the Lord I'll receive
[58:12] you touch not the worldly things and
[58:14] I'll be a father to you or a God and
[58:16] you'll be my sons and daughters yoke
[58:18] yourself not up with unbelievers but
[58:20] come out of it God wants separation from
[58:22] the world he wants to be unionized with
[58:25] you
[58:27] himself he's a jealous
[58:31] God if my wife was running around on me
[58:34] I'd be
[58:36] jealous come on brother that's where all
[58:39] the brothers should be saying
[58:41] amen come on I was
[58:44] weak some of y'all may not love your
[58:46] wives as much as I love
[58:48] mine but God don't want his
[58:51] wife to go running around on him out in
[58:55] the world that's right oh he wants her
[58:57] to
[58:59] himself notice notice here he says in
[59:01] Jehovah J total separation from
[59:05] all
[59:07] unbelief all unbelief and remember
[59:09] Abraham the patriarch never absolutely
[59:13] fully blessed until he obeyed exactly
[59:15] what God said to do and we will never
[59:18] never never be blessed any and have the
[59:21] blessings until we obey what God
[59:24] Said now I don't know about you in your
[59:26] house but I want the blessings that all
[59:28] that God has for me to be poured out as
[59:31] brother Aaron said on Sunday I don't
[59:33] want that little Misty Rain I want the
[59:36] gusher I want the cats and dogs I want
[59:39] the pouring rain the blessings of God to
[59:41] fall upon me to fall upon my family on
[59:44] my wife my children I want to fall on
[59:47] our church come on somebody we want the
[59:49] blessings of God but to get those
[59:51] blessings we must obey God

[1:00:07] that don't have it here tonight until
[1:00:09] you fully separate
[1:00:11] yourself Abraham never was blessed just
[1:00:14] because he left the land of
[1:00:18] Earth he never was blessed just because
[1:00:22] he left his Kindred he still had Papa
[1:00:24] with him he still had lot with him but
[1:00:28] excuse me but notice when he fully
[1:00:30] obeyed when he separated himself from
[1:00:33] Terra his father when he separated
[1:00:36] himself for life when he started seeking
[1:00:39] God and God Alone God led him to the
[1:00:42] place in which God had purposed him to
[1:00:44] go and in that land god be to pour
[1:00:48] blessing on top of blessing on top of
[1:00:50] blessing what am I telling you tonight

[1:02:36] burnt offerings and sacrifices as in
[1:02:39] obeying the voice of the
[1:02:41] Lord behold to obey is better than
[1:02:44] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat
[1:02:47] Rams for Rebellion is as a sin of
[1:02:49] Witchcraft and stubbornness is Iniquity
[1:02:52] and
[1:02:53] idolatry God requires a
[1:02:56] obedience from The Young from the old
[1:03:00] and from the old old he requires
[1:03:05] obedience and we live in a world today
[1:03:08] that's feels like everybody's
[1:03:12] entitled everybody's got their hand
[1:03:15] out they want something for nothing come
[1:03:20] on you know but brother B tells us in
[1:03:23] the token message when you fully obey
[1:03:26] God in a full surrender to it you're
[1:03:29] entitled to the Token now if you want to
[1:03:33] come in with that entitlement mentality
[1:03:35] tonight praise God when you fully obey

[1:03:52] Holy Ghost in our church I want the Holy
[1:03:54] Ghost in every you tonight God but in
[1:03:58] full obedience to the word of God
[1:04:00] entitles you as a family entitles you as
[1:04:02] a Believer entitles you as a brother and
[1:04:05] a sister and as a church to the
[1:04:06] outpouring of the Holy
[1:04:08] Ghost full
[1:04:10] obedience he say there's no other way
[1:04:12] there is he said you could ever be
[1:04:15] entitled be entitled to the Token until
[1:04:17] you fully obey the word not what
[1:04:21] somebody has put in it or added to it
[1:04:23] but what God said about it yeah and we
[1:04:26] find in John 53 and: 5 Jesus answered
[1:04:29] he's speaking to the people he says ver
[1:04:31] verily I saying to you except a man be
[1:04:34] born of water and a spirit he cannot
[1:04:36] enter the kingdom of
[1:04:39] God that which is born of the flesh is
[1:04:41] flesh that which is born of the spirit
[1:04:43] of spirit Marvel not that I said unto
[1:04:45] thee ye must be born
[1:04:50] again see God's first or Jesus's first
[1:04:54] Doctrine
[1:04:56] his first Doctrine brother H was ye must
[1:04:59] be born
[1:05:01] again cuz without being born again you
[1:05:04] can't even call Jesus the Christ can't
[1:05:07] even recognize the
[1:05:09] anointing so we find here brother bam
[1:05:11] says in the token he says no you must be
[1:05:14] born again that don't mean jump up and
[1:05:16] down at the altar anybody can jump up
[1:05:19] and down we have witnessed that it don't
[1:05:22] mean walk back there and shake hands
[1:05:23] with the pastor that don't mean all of
[1:05:25] this foolishness that we've seen done it
[1:05:27] don't mean putting your name on the
[1:05:28] church book it means Death to Your First
[1:05:32] being that's the problem Church many of
[1:05:35] us never died
[1:05:37] out oh we died just enough to look
[1:05:43] dead we died just enough to barely have
[1:05:47] a pul but that little tick of the world
[1:05:50] look holding on to
[1:05:53] something but notice to be born Born
[1:05:55] Again means you die out to your first
[1:05:58] nature and everything that is entailed
[1:06:01] in that nature every genetic curse
[1:06:04] everything passed down everything in the
[1:06:07] world that tried to grab a hold of you
[1:06:09] in that first nature you got to die to
[1:06:12] that thing there and then be born again
[1:06:15] and that's what God is
[1:06:19] requiring so his first Doctrine was you
[1:06:22] must be born again but says notice you
[1:06:25] people it's
[1:06:26] absolutely essential and necessary and
[1:06:30] compelling and compulsory that you
[1:06:32] received the Holy
[1:06:34] Ghost for if you don't you can't come in
[1:06:37] the
[1:06:39] resurrection that's why we preach the
[1:06:41] Holy Ghost that's why we
[1:06:44] preach the depth of the word of God it's
[1:06:48] not shallow though it's it is shallow
[1:06:51] God is
[1:06:52] Simplicity hiding himself in the simple
[1:06:54] things and yet revealing himself in the
[1:06:56] same so we find here see he's requiring
[1:07:00] for says in the token he's requiring
[1:07:01] that night to separate the Believers
[1:07:03] from the unbelievers the believer the
[1:07:04] worshipper was identified with the
[1:07:06] sacrifice he must apply the blood it
[1:07:09] wasn't take and kill the lamb and set
[1:07:11] the blood out there somewhere or to keep
[1:07:13] it in a charge or take it down to the
[1:07:15] neighbors he had to apply the blood do
[1:07:19] you understand he said
[1:07:22] he the leader in the house am has to
[1:07:27] apply the it may not look right you may
[1:07:30] have kids kicking and screaming but you
[1:07:31] must apply the
[1:07:35] blood don't
[1:07:37] compromise don't let off the standards

[1:07:50] the threshold of the door we're going to
[1:07:52] apply to the threshold of every bedroom
[1:07:54] we're going to apply the blood BL and
[1:07:55] this place is a place that God the Holy
[1:07:58] Spirit can come and dwell in we're not
[1:08:00] going to mix it by just having it on our
[1:08:02] headphones and playing any kind of
[1:08:03] worldly music we want to or looking at
[1:08:05] any vulgar picture show or things out
[1:08:07] there on YouTube and Tik Tock and
[1:08:09] whatever else you want to call it no
[1:08:11] there's got to be the applying of the
[1:08:13] blood and God is calling for the leaders
[1:08:16] of this church he's calling for the
[1:08:18] leaders of the family to take your
[1:08:21] position and apply the token to your
[1:08:24] home apply it to your family applied to
[1:08:27] your
[1:08:27] marriage come on
[1:08:31] church he said that's the way it is
[1:08:33] tonight we could come and sympathize
[1:08:34] with everything God does that isn't what
[1:08:37] he requires you got to apply
[1:08:40] it I better move on some of y'all quiet
[1:08:42] on me
[1:08:44] tonight he says Satan doesn't care how
[1:08:47] religious you
[1:08:49] are well I got long hair brother Joe
[1:08:52] never cut it big whip
[1:08:55] if your heart's wrong if your attitude
[1:08:58] for having it
[1:08:59] wrong Satan don't care how religious you
[1:09:02] are or how right you are in your
[1:09:03] Doctrine if you miss that life you won't
[1:09:06] come up
[1:09:08] anyhow no matter how religious how good
[1:09:11] how many churches you belong to or will
[1:09:13] belong to it doesn't matter one thing
[1:09:16] unless you've been born
[1:09:19] again and today we have second third
[1:09:22] fourth generations of message children
[1:09:26] don't know anything else but the
[1:09:29] message they never been out there in
[1:09:31] another denomination they never been in
[1:09:33] this that or the other they had but they
[1:09:34] cut their teeth on the message Pew and
[1:09:37] yet to them it's a bunch of rules and
[1:09:39] regulations this is what we do we come
[1:09:41] to church on Wednesday we go to church
[1:09:43] on Sunday and if there's a second
[1:09:45] service on Sunday well you know it goes
[1:09:47] against the gra but we'll go anyway
[1:09:49] because that's what Mom and Dad requires
[1:09:50] and we find we got young people and
[1:09:53] young married people that with because
[1:09:55] they've never really had a born again
[1:09:58] experience all they have was a religious
[1:10:00] covering when they get to a certain age
[1:10:02] it never anchored in their heart and
[1:10:04] they're out there in the
[1:10:06] world with the religious covering called
[1:10:09] the
[1:10:15] message people in our message ranks
[1:10:17] today are Falling
[1:10:20] Away young people are falling away
[1:10:23] because it's a list of rules and dos and
[1:10:26] don'ts and we don't cut our hair and we
[1:10:28] don't do this and we don't do that
[1:10:31] that's the attitude of the
[1:10:33] unconverted cuz when you get converted
[1:10:35] it's no longer a list of dos and don'ts
[1:10:38] it's you obeying the voice of God it's
[1:10:41] you pleasing the master right this is
[1:10:44] what my husband desires of me and I want
[1:10:46] to please
[1:10:50] him Joshua 24 we get back to our
[1:10:54] scripture Joshua 24:1 Joshua gathered
[1:10:57] all the tribes of Israel to shikim and
[1:11:00] he called for the Elders of Israel and
[1:11:02] for the heads and for their judges and
[1:11:04] for their officers and they presented
[1:11:06] themselves before God and Joshua said
[1:11:07] unto the people thus sayith the Lord God
[1:11:10] of Israel your fathers we on the other
[1:11:11] side of the flood of old time even Tera
[1:11:14] the father of Abraham the father of
[1:11:15] nikor and they served other gods and I
[1:11:18] took your father Abraham from the other
[1:11:20] side of the flood and I led him
[1:11:22] throughout all the land of Canaan and I
[1:11:24] multiply his seed and I gave him Isaac
[1:11:28] and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and
[1:11:31] I gave unto Esau Mount zier to possess
[1:11:33] it but Jacob and his children went down
[1:11:35] to Egypt notice he's beginning to
[1:11:37] rehearse the
[1:11:39] history he's beginning to go back and
[1:11:42] tell them the history of the church
[1:11:45] little church started 50 years ago there
[1:11:48] on White Oak Road there with a church
[1:11:50] that had broken out windows and had a
[1:11:52] potbelly fire pit and and brother Tim
[1:11:54] there you know he tells a story like he
[1:11:56] did the opening of this year begins to
[1:11:59] rehearse the origination of this church
[1:12:01] and where we started and where we are
[1:12:05] today all the great things that God had
[1:12:08] brought us from and how we went from
[1:12:10] that little small white church and just
[1:12:12] a few handful of people till outgrew
[1:12:15] that and you had to build a bigger
[1:12:16] Church there in the 90s and then just a
[1:12:18] few years ago I think seven eight years
[1:12:20] ago maybe 10 we built this church and
[1:12:23] you see the progression of the people
[1:12:25] now Joshua is standing before all of
[1:12:28] Israel and he's telling them I'm the
[1:12:31] one I brought you from this place
[1:12:34] starting with Abraham your father and to
[1:12:37] his seeds I gave Esau this land but to
[1:12:40] Isaac I gave him this or I gave him
[1:12:42] Isaac I gave him Jacob and I gave him
[1:12:45] Esau and to Jacob they went down into
[1:12:47] Egypt and I went down in Egypt with them
[1:12:49] and I sent them a Moses and I sent them
[1:12:52] an Aaron and I plagued Egypt for your
[1:12:54] sake
[1:12:57] and I called you out of Egypt notice

[1:13:17] fathers with chariots and Horsemen unto
[1:13:19] the Red Sea and when they Cried unto the
[1:13:21] Lord he put Darkness between you and the
[1:13:24] Egyptians

[1:13:35] and you dwelt in the wilderness a long
[1:13:37] time a long season and I brought you
[1:13:39] into the land of the amorites which
[1:13:40] dwelt on the other side of Jordan and
[1:13:42] they fought with you and I gave them
[1:13:44] into your hand that you might possess
[1:13:45] their land and I destroyed them from
[1:13:48] before you and BAC the son of zipper the
[1:13:50] king of Moab arose and he wared against
[1:13:52] Israel and then he sent and called balam

[1:16:06] all this for us look where we started
[1:16:09] from look where God brought Abraham from
[1:16:12] and look where we are today oh my
[1:16:16] sometimes they do us good to look back

[1:16:22] where you are today some of you was out
[1:16:25] there in sin oh you're one step away

[1:16:34] are tonight that's almighty god brother
[1:16:37] L only God can bring a man to a place
[1:16:40] like
[1:16:43] this he be to rehearse the
[1:16:48] history a recognition of the
[1:16:50] supernatural this is not a
[1:16:53] myth this is not a Legend but this is
[1:16:57] God and he begins to reiterate to him
[1:17:01] all that God has
[1:17:03] done and he said God requires full
[1:17:06] obedience look what God has done for us
[1:17:09] look what God has done for our church
[1:17:11] look God has done for our families and
[1:17:14] all that he requires is
[1:17:18] obedience God brought them into a land
[1:17:22] that he had already predeter determined
[1:17:26] he God scouted it out little bitty
[1:17:30] Israel and he placed his chosen people
[1:17:34] into the chosen land and God used Joshua
[1:17:37] a prophet to divide the land by tribe by
[1:17:42] tribe each to their
[1:17:45] inheritance and now he's reminding the
[1:17:48] leaders now you got something to do now
[1:17:51] God has placed us in our Promised Land
[1:17:56] Promised Land of the word by the opening
[1:17:59] of the seals through the anointing of
[1:18:01] the Holy Ghost now we're placed in that
[1:18:05] land notice he's remind them it was been
[1:18:08] God all the time and we find it notice
[1:18:11] he never put the display of the
[1:18:13] supernatural he never gave credit to any
[1:18:16] one
[1:18:17] man he never gave credit to a kingdom of
[1:18:21] man built by man God did this God did
[1:18:24] this God did this God did this God did
[1:18:26] this God did this and let me tell you if
[1:18:28] you are ashamed of what God has done if
[1:18:31] you are afraid to testify of what God
[1:18:34] has done I don't care what vessel God
[1:18:36] chooses to use to do the supernatural
[1:18:38] just so long that God does the
[1:18:39] supernatural in our
[1:18:41] midst let one generation declare to the
[1:18:44] Next Generation the Glorious wonders of
[1:18:46] almighty
[1:18:49] God I pray God continues to pour out
[1:18:52] Supernatural at this church and not just
[1:18:54] even like Tabernacle but the bride
[1:18:59] worldwide but let's just be
[1:19:01] honest we're placed in this land I'm
[1:19:04] going to skip some things but God has
[1:19:05] placed us into the land of the opening
[1:19:08] of the word just like he placed Israel
[1:19:10] in their promised
[1:19:12] land and
[1:19:15] yet brother Joshua brother Joshua tells
[1:19:18] them I placed you here God has done all
[1:19:21] this
[1:19:23] Supernatural but fear the
[1:19:25] lord serve the Lord notice in Joshua
[1:19:29] 24:14 therefore fear the lord that's not
[1:19:33] fear like you're trembling and Afraid
[1:19:35] and scared but it means to
[1:19:37] reverence reverence all that God has
[1:19:42] done if you can't believe just look back
[1:19:44] over in the corner and see sister Lana
[1:19:46] and behind her you see sister Sharon and
[1:19:48] right over here you see sister Ruth
[1:19:50] people that Satan put a curse on called
[1:19:52] cancer but yet God rich in Mercy said
[1:19:55] not not today not in my church not with
[1:19:57] my people God still breaking the
[1:19:59] shackles off of the
[1:20:02] enemy God just declaring that he's alive
[1:20:04] notice it says to fear the lord behold
[1:20:07] the fear of the Lord that is wisdom and
[1:20:09] depart from Evil is understanding Psalms
[1:20:11] 2 and verse 11 serve the Lord with fear
[1:20:13] and rejoicing with trembling Proverbs
[1:20:16] 1:7 fear the fear of the Lord is the
[1:20:18] beginning of
[1:20:19] knowledge so reverence him as a sole
[1:20:23] object of your worship
[1:20:26] not because you're worried because
[1:20:28] you're afraid of
[1:20:30] hell you think you're going to get some
[1:20:32] fire
[1:20:35] Insurance W I don't want to get burnt by
[1:20:37] the fire well you better get right on
[1:20:39] this side of
[1:20:40] it reverence him for all that he's done
[1:20:46] then it says serve him in sincerity and
[1:20:49] in
[1:20:51] truth put that scripture up there if you
[1:20:53] would
[1:20:56] 24:14 so therefore fear the lord and
[1:20:59] serve him in sincerity and in truth that
[1:21:01] word sincerity the Latin word there
[1:21:03] means it denotes honey without
[1:21:06] wax unmixed Purity the Greek the Greek
[1:21:10] is a connotation that means you hold
[1:21:11] something up to the Rays of the Sun and
[1:21:14] you don't see a speck or a flaw oh
[1:21:16] there's coming a day Church God's going
[1:21:18] to lift his little bride up to the ray
[1:21:20] of the sun his son and he ain't going to
[1:21:22] find a spot he ain't going to find the
[1:21:24] blemish he ain't going to find the flaw
[1:21:26] why because she's perfect she's unmixed
[1:21:29] she's pure and she's made of the pure
[1:21:32] word of
[1:21:34] God so serve him and we find in 1
[1:21:37] Corinthians 5 and verse 7 your glory and
[1:21:40] is not of good know you not that A
[1:21:42] little leaven leth a whole lump Purge
[1:21:45] out therefore the old leaven that you
[1:21:47] may be a new lump as you are unleavened
[1:21:49] for even Christ Our Passover is
[1:21:52] sacrificed for us therefore let us keep
[1:21:54] the feast not with the old
[1:21:57] leaven neither with the leaven of malice
[1:22:00] malignity ill will desire to injure and
[1:22:03] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[1:22:06] of
[1:22:07] sincerity and truth so a little leaven
[1:22:10] will Lev the whole lump so we got to
[1:22:14] purge and that's what every service is
[1:22:16] it's a purging of the old leaven it's a
[1:22:19] purging of the old thinking come on
[1:22:22] Church some of us we got to purge every
[1:22:24] day multiple times a
[1:22:27] day but so Joshua is telling the people
[1:22:30] to serve god with sincerity this is not
[1:22:33] a blind leap of faith but he's going
[1:22:35] back into history and he's shown them
[1:22:37] all that God has done for them and
[1:22:39] Joshua's making a declaration and he's
[1:22:41] making a call therefore let us keep the
[1:22:44] Feast of unleavened bread or keep it
[1:22:46] with unleavened bread of sincerity and
[1:22:48] in truth and you recall a prophet of God
[1:22:51] he was had a vision or a dream or
[1:22:53] whatever it may be and there he was
[1:22:55] dealing with a black or a mamba snake
[1:22:58] right and the snake was going after his
[1:23:01] friend and he he be to I want to deal
[1:23:03] with this he turned and he looked at my
[1:23:04] friend and away he went after my friend
[1:23:06] and I see my friend jumping way in the
[1:23:08] air and over him and over him and over
[1:23:10] him trying to think trying to strike at
[1:23:12] him I thought oh if it ever hits him
[1:23:14] it'll be instant
[1:23:16] death and I said if that serpent ever
[1:23:19] strikes him it'll kill
[1:23:22] him and just then the serpent and turned
[1:23:24] to me when I said that and looked at me
[1:23:27] again and a voice came from above me and
[1:23:29] said you have been given power to bind
[1:23:31] him the worst or any and I said oh God
[1:23:34] what must I do he said there's one thing
[1:23:37] that you must do you must be more
[1:23:41] sincere you must be more
[1:23:46] sinere I said well God forgive me for my
[1:23:48] un sincerity or my and let me let me
[1:23:51] have more sincerity and when I raise my
[1:23:53] hands up up to him again there was a
[1:23:55] great something come over me just
[1:23:57] Lifting me up seemed like my whole body
[1:23:59] was charged with something and I looked
[1:24:01] at the serpent and he started toward me
[1:24:03] and he couldn't do it and I said Satan
[1:24:05] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:24:07] bind you and the serpent blue smoke flew
[1:24:10] out of him and he curled up and he made
[1:24:12] a sign like a capital S and he made it
[1:24:14] backwards an an sign that means by this
[1:24:17] one anything below him because he was
[1:24:19] the
[1:24:20] worst so notice here
[1:24:25] if a prophet of God in order to to bind
[1:24:28] the serpent had to be more sincere what
[1:24:31] about we as the uh those that are
[1:24:35] receivers of the prophet's
[1:24:38] Ministry Church we got to be more
[1:24:41] sincere we got to be more sincere in our
[1:24:44] worship we got to be more sincere in our
[1:24:47] dedication to
[1:24:49] God don't take it don't take a service
[1:24:52] for granted thinking well this is what
[1:24:53] we got to do it's a Wednesday night it
[1:24:55] rained all day I don't feel like coming
[1:24:58] grab yourself up by your bootstraps and
[1:25:00] come to church anyway and worship God
[1:25:04] that's
[1:25:07] right if a prophet had to be more
[1:25:10] sincere we're not going to bind a
[1:25:12] serpent just by claiming God sent a
[1:25:15] prophet we're not going to bind a
[1:25:17] serpent just by believing oh I believe
[1:25:19] the message of the
[1:25:20] hour you're going to bind a serpent by
[1:25:22] more sincerity
[1:25:24] by worship that's
[1:25:26] unmixed that's
[1:25:28] pure and we go to Joshua 24 and ver1 15
[1:25:32] as we start closing this thing
[1:25:35] down I'll land you down here in the next
[1:25:37] few minutes and if he says no that
[1:25:40] Joshua speaking to the people if it seem
[1:25:42] evil to you to serve the

[1:26:08] ain't based on who the your parents are
[1:26:11] it comes down to every individual Joshua
[1:26:14] made the Declaration to all of Israel if
[1:26:17] it seem evil for you to serve this God
[1:26:20] if it seem evil for you to serve the one
[1:26:22] that split the Red Sea and walked our
[1:26:24] family over if it seem EV to serve that
[1:26:27] then choose you whom you're going to
[1:26:29] serve notice not if you'll serve whom

[1:27:12] or the other choose yourselves this day
[1:27:16] whom you'll serve notice we cannot

[1:30:40] he chose to reject the golden calf he
[1:30:42] chose to serve the Lord by serving Moses
[1:30:45] notice he stayed with his Pastor he
[1:30:47] chose to so Hallelujah he chose to
[1:30:50] believe God's promise about the promised
[1:30:52] land he chose to recognize the
[1:30:54] leadership of the captain of the Lord's
[1:30:55] army he chose to take the leadership of
[1:30:58] Israel and lead them into the land see

[1:31:46] Adam's household we're going to serve
[1:31:48] God it may not look pretty you may

[1:31:59] my children are going to serve God and
[1:32:00] by the grace of God he's giving me my
[1:32:04] kids by the grace of God because of
[1:32:07] choice that we make as
[1:32:10] Leaders
[1:32:13] notice brother says I can't make your
[1:32:16] decision friend I can only pray for you
[1:32:18] you got to make your decision each man
[1:32:21] chooses not if you'll serve
[1:32:24] but whom you'll
[1:32:26] serve see we can we can make this
[1:32:30] flesh a God and we can serve
[1:32:34] that we can make money of God and we can
[1:32:37] chase after it and serve that we can be
[1:32:40] obsessed with obsessed with the desire
[1:32:43] for success and that become your
[1:32:47] God or we can be obsessed with
[1:32:51] wealth Fame riches and that become a God
[1:32:56] and we can hold on and be obsessed with
[1:33:01] hurts past failures Pains of yesterday
[1:33:05] people that did us wrong and that become
[1:33:07] a
[1:33:11] God but you must
[1:33:14] choose are you going to serve the Gods
[1:33:17] on the other side of the
[1:33:19] flood the god of the family the genetics
[1:33:22] that got passed down the temple
[1:33:25] the
[1:33:26] lust the generational things complexes
[1:33:29] that get passed down from family to
[1:33:32] family envying and jealousies and things
[1:33:35] like that the Gods on the other side are
[1:33:38] the gods that you dealt with in Egypt or
[1:33:41] even the Gods on the other side of the
[1:33:43] Jordan of the amorites he's given them a
[1:33:46] choice you can serve those three or you
[1:33:49] can serve the Living God
[1:33:54] Joshua 24 and verse
[1:33:57] 23 they made a declaration we're going
[1:33:59] to serve God and Joshua response he says
[1:34:02] now for put away said he the strange
[1:34:06] Gods here they are brother Aaron as we
[1:34:08] start wrapping this up God had placed
[1:34:11] them in the promised land and has done
[1:34:14] just the unimaginable Feats great
[1:34:17] victories great great triumphs I mean
[1:34:19] destroyed enemy after enemy after enemy
[1:34:22] and yet they brought with
[1:34:25] them they brought with them over into
[1:34:28] the promised land strange Gods things
[1:34:32] that were passed down from family the
[1:34:34] gods of their fathers the the the ideas
[1:34:37] of their fathers the jealousies of their
[1:34:39] fathers the curses of their fathers and
[1:34:41] they brought it into the promised land
[1:34:43] and they were worshiping it and God
[1:34:47] placed them in the promised land don't
[1:34:48] let that be your failure don't let that
[1:34:51] be your struggle tonight let God is
[1:34:53] place you in the promised land of the
[1:34:55] word and you're holding on to those
[1:34:57] things and making them a God and
[1:34:59] worshiping
[1:35:01] them God desires our
[1:35:06] worship they were in the promised
[1:35:09] land notice no more battles there was a
[1:35:13] rest from the
[1:35:15] battles and they were
[1:35:18] worshiping these other gods the Bible
[1:35:21] says strange
[1:35:25] foreign
[1:35:27] Gods gods of temper passion Pride
[1:35:30] arrogance bitterness unforgiveness
[1:35:32] jealousy grudges Envy
[1:35:35] resentment strange
[1:35:37] Gods gods that each of you have dealt
[1:35:42] with each of us had fought with those
[1:35:46] Gods yes
[1:35:48] sir can I go through these just for a
[1:35:50] few minutes let's look at the god of
[1:35:53] bitterness
[1:35:54] Hebrews 12 and verse1 15 look in
[1:35:56] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:35:59] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[1:36:02] springing up trouble you and thereby
[1:36:04] many be defiled bitterness is Extreme
[1:36:09] wickedness it's bitterness is anger that
[1:36:12] is fermented in the heart of those that
[1:36:14] choose not to forgive bitterness can be
[1:36:15] triggered by someone who is emotionally
[1:36:18] stolen something from us and will not
[1:36:20] allow us to reclaim it we want vengeance
[1:36:25] this wants
[1:36:28] Vengeance this wants to
[1:36:31] remind every day what was done to
[1:36:35] me I was wronged I was hurt
[1:36:43] bitterness brother BR says get all these
[1:36:45] little differences away from your little
[1:36:46] isms little funny feelings around you
[1:36:49] from the around you for
[1:36:52] Brethren right not the guy on the street
[1:36:55] Brethren little things like that shake
[1:36:57] it away don't let no root of bitterness
[1:37:00] ever get into your soul if you do it
[1:37:02] will caner you and that word canker
[1:37:05] there is a spreading sword that eats
[1:37:07] into the Flesh and it just keeps eating
[1:37:10] and it keeps eating it's like a cancer
[1:37:12] just keeps spreading and keeps spreading
[1:37:14] and it's on the inside and you never
[1:37:15] know but it's spreading and spreading
[1:37:17] and spreading never let a root of
[1:37:19] bitterness get
[1:37:22] inside then there's a god of jealousy
[1:37:24] and jealousy is a complex emotion
[1:37:26] involves feelings of insecurity fear and
[1:37:28] anxiety notice the first murder that was
[1:37:31] ever wrote down in the Bible was because
[1:37:34] of
[1:37:36] jealousy Cain slew his brother Abel at
[1:37:40] the
[1:37:42] altar because he was jealous of his
[1:37:45] sacrifice of his worship and God gave
[1:37:49] Cain an opportunity if you do as your
[1:37:52] brother I'll rece deceive you but he was
[1:37:55] so ate up with jealousy that he murdered
[1:37:58] him on the same altar with his
[1:38:05] sacrifice notice jealousy places strain
[1:38:08] on the heart let me just give you some
[1:38:12] some
[1:38:14] doctorial me uh medical advice here on
[1:38:17] some of these gods that some of us want
[1:38:19] to hold on to we think oh this is great
[1:38:21] it's damaging your life
[1:38:24] right jealousy places strain on the
[1:38:26] heart palpitations may be felt jealousy

[1:39:06] jealousy makes people more susceptible
[1:39:08] to codes flu wonder why people get sick
[1:39:10] all the time codes flu other illnesses
[1:39:12] virus like the epsteam bar that causes
[1:39:14] fatigue may also be reactive old
[1:39:17] injuries and pain that can flare up due
[1:39:19] to weaknesses in defenses all because of
[1:39:22] something a little God a little foreign
[1:39:25] strange God of
[1:39:28] jealousy oh let's keep going now God of
[1:39:33] grudges Leviticus 19 and verse 18 Thou
[1:39:36] shalt not
[1:39:38] avenge let me back up to verse 17
[1:39:40] because it's too good to pass
[1:39:42] up Thou shalt not hate thy brother in
[1:39:46] thy
[1:39:50] heart Thou shalt not y'all need to bold
[1:39:53] that in your Bible Thou shalt not hate
[1:39:55] thy brother in thy heart thou shal in
[1:39:58] any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not
[1:40:00] suffer sin upon him now let's go to the
[1:40:02] next verse Thou shalt not avenge nor
[1:40:06] bear any grudge against the children of

[1:40:31] love your brother surely you can love
[1:40:33] your sister surely you can love the
[1:40:35] children of
[1:40:39] god notice a grudge is a persistent
[1:40:42] feeling of ill or resentment notice not
[1:40:46] a truth but a persistent feeling it's a
[1:40:50] lie
[1:40:54] it ens snares you in anger
[1:40:57] woooo I know ain't none of y'all ever
[1:40:59] had that sweating all night can't sleep
[1:41:03] getting even with the brother getting
[1:41:04] even with the I can't believe she said
[1:41:06] that about
[1:41:07] me did you say he just walked right by
[1:41:10] me snarled up his
[1:41:13] nose Satan's right there just taking
[1:41:15] something that's
[1:41:17] innocent that brother didn't know he
[1:41:19] walked by you may it made you feel that
[1:41:22] bad tap him on the
[1:41:23] shoulder get his attention but we it's
[1:41:26] notice holding a grudge is when you
[1:41:28] Harbor anger and bitterness and
[1:41:30] resentment negative feelings grudges
[1:41:34] inhibit your ability to cope with and
[1:41:36] resolve your issue and keeps you stuck
[1:41:38] in the
[1:41:40] past now I'm not going to ask for a show
[1:41:43] of hands but I promise you everybody in
[1:41:44] this room has had a grudge at one
[1:41:47] time if you ain't please put your wings
[1:41:50] up tonight because we're talking to
[1:41:52] humans
[1:41:53] men and women in this old carnality of
[1:41:55] this flesh but our Spirits want to soar
[1:41:58] in the heavenlies but notice instead of
[1:42:00] accepting a moving on from the negative
[1:42:02] experience we find there's no resolution
[1:42:05] so what do we do when we hold on The
[1:42:06] Grudge we continually relive that
[1:42:12] Grudge and we can't wait to tell
[1:42:14] somebody
[1:42:15] new about that
[1:42:19] Grudge we
[1:42:21] all we all
[1:42:24] we
[1:42:25] all had fit that
[1:42:27] bill I don't care if you're preacher I
[1:42:30] don't care if you're Deacon I don't care
[1:42:31] if you've been here and you're 8 to 80
[1:42:33] blind crippled and crazy we have all had
[1:42:35] fit that bill at some point somebody has
[1:42:38] hurt
[1:42:39] you at some point somebody has done you
[1:42:42] wrong somebody said something negative
[1:42:44] about you and it and it wounded you and
[1:42:47] maybe for a little bit you held on to
[1:42:50] that but it's a god from the other
[1:42:54] side it's a god it's a foreign God a
[1:42:57] strange god let's keep going just for a
[1:42:59] few more minutes the gods of
[1:43:02] Envy Envy is a feeling of
[1:43:04] discontentedness or resentful longing
[1:43:07] aroused by someone else's
[1:43:11] possessions somebody drives up in the
[1:43:13] church parking lot with a brand new
[1:43:15] ride how in the world they can afford
[1:43:19] that thought he was fulltime
[1:43:26] things get said a lot of things get said
[1:43:29] in
[1:43:30] just choose your words wisely because
[1:43:33] you don't know what that person's
[1:43:34] dealing

[1:44:14] like brother brother Aaron and we we
[1:44:16] constantly judging oursel by somebody
[1:44:19] else the god of Envy now never satisfied
[1:44:24] with how God Made You never satisfied
[1:44:27] with the gift that God placed into your
[1:44:32] life Satan's always there pointing you
[1:44:34] to somebody else look at them if you
[1:44:37] would just do this this Envy a god of
[1:44:41] Envy then
[1:44:43] there's God of
[1:44:47] resentment and resentment here is bitter
[1:44:49] ignation having been treated
[1:44:51] unfairly and when you're consumed by
[1:44:53] negative feelings your mind races making
[1:44:55] it difficult to relax and fall asleep at
[1:44:59] night chronic sleep deprivation is
[1:45:01] associated with the multitude of health
[1:45:03] problems including
[1:45:05] obesity diabetes cognitive impairment
[1:45:09] emotional tension can manifest
[1:45:10] physically in the form of muscle
[1:45:12] stiffness and pain when you're filled
[1:45:13] with resentment and bitterness you may
[1:45:15] unconsciously ttin your muscles
[1:45:17] particularly in your neck shoulders and
[1:45:19] back and wonder why people got back
[1:45:21] problems neck problems shower
[1:45:24] problems take it back to the
[1:45:29] root chronic muscle tension can lead to
[1:45:32] discomfort headaches even chronic pain
[1:45:34] conditions over time it can severely
[1:45:37] impact your mobility and overall quality
[1:45:40] of life and you just think you hurt
[1:45:43] yourself in the
[1:45:46] gym and
[1:45:48] yet little God of
[1:45:51] resentment you resent what they said you
[1:45:54] resent how that was handled you resent
[1:45:56] this and you resent that and you resent
[1:45:58] resent resent resent another thing
[1:46:01] possibly one of the most surprising
[1:46:02] physical dangers of resentment and
[1:46:04] bitterness is the potential to
[1:46:06] accelerate the aging
[1:46:09] process you see people 30 40 years old
[1:46:12] so bound up and they look 50 and 60
[1:46:16] because they're so eight
[1:46:18] up told you I had a dream and I'm going
[1:46:21] to end with this I had a dream woken up
[1:46:24] at 3:00 in the morning and and in this
[1:46:26] dream this is a
[1:46:29] dream no names will be given it was a
[1:46:32] dream don't ask me later who it was
[1:46:36] dream I had a dream and my daughter
[1:46:39] Rebecca was in this dream with
[1:46:42] me and we were sitting down with a
[1:46:45] pastor and with his wife and we were
[1:46:46] having dinner and I thought it was just
[1:46:48] odd that my wife or not my my wife
[1:46:50] wasn't there but me and Rebecca was
[1:46:52] sitting down with the pastor and his
[1:46:54] wife and the pastor could not sit down
[1:46:56] with us because the pastor was so ate up
[1:46:58] with
[1:46:59] bitterness and jealousy and these gods
[1:47:02] that I just talked to you about and the
[1:47:04] pastor's wife made a
[1:47:06] comment did you hear what they
[1:47:09] said talking to
[1:47:12] Rebecca and I chimed in I said they're
[1:47:15] just kids you have to overlook that they
[1:47:17] don't know what they're talking
[1:47:20] about you know little kids they hear
[1:47:23] stuff around the table that they
[1:47:24] shouldn't then they go and repeat it and
[1:47:26] it's all
[1:47:29] twisted and she said well they must have
[1:47:32] heard it
[1:47:33] somewhere their parents must have heard
[1:47:35] it from their parents I said you know
[1:47:37] what they may have but you have to
[1:47:41] choose to let it
[1:47:44] go you have to choose to let it go so I
[1:47:47] I finished my plate and Rebecca had
[1:47:49] finished hers and she went on to the car
[1:47:52] and as I was leaving and walking out the
[1:47:54] door the pastor stopped me and he said
[1:47:57] just keep this between
[1:48:00] us just keep this conversation he
[1:48:03] overheard the conversation keep it
[1:48:04] between
[1:48:06] us and I looked back and I said I
[1:48:09] understand this more than you
[1:48:11] realize and as I was walking down he had
[1:48:14] a staircase that walked down was like
[1:48:16] Upper Floor walk down to the bottom
[1:48:18] floor and as I looked I looked back at
[1:48:21] him and I said I've been hurt
[1:48:24] as
[1:48:24] well but I chose to let
[1:48:27] go I've been wronged by men but I choose
[1:48:31] not to hold it against them I have felt
[1:48:34] the pain of Agony and the bitterness
[1:48:37] wrestled with it but I choose I choose
[1:48:41] to
[1:48:43] forgive I felt overlooked and not apart
[1:48:46] I felt the feelings of
[1:48:48] resentment this is in a dream but I
[1:48:51] choose to have joy
[1:48:53] and I choose to have
[1:48:55] peace notice everything comes down to a
[1:49:01] choice I've had men talk about me behind
[1:49:04] my
[1:49:05] back and that just happened this past
[1:49:08] year men talk about me behind my back
[1:49:11] and I choose not to dwell on it but I
[1:49:15] choose to press to the mark of the high
[1:49:17] calling in Jesus
[1:49:20] Christ I said I understand what you're
[1:49:22] going through through I understand your
[1:49:23] hurts I understand your pains I
[1:49:25] understand your position but I choose to
[1:49:29] live I
[1:49:31] choose I'm choosing to live I'm choosing
[1:49:34] to forego all this I choose not to hold
[1:49:36] on to bitterness I choose not to hold on
[1:49:38] to jealousy I choose not to hold on to
[1:49:40] resentment and Malice I choose no not to
[1:49:42] hold on to the wrongs of other people
[1:49:43] have done to me and the hurts I choose
[1:49:45] to forgive I choose to serve the Lord I
[1:49:49] choose not to die holding on to these
[1:49:51] Gods these feelings that seem to give
[1:49:53] power to me I choose to
[1:49:56] live and I ask you even like Tabernacle
[1:49:59] I ask you that's on the stream tonight
[1:50:01] what do you
[1:50:03] choose I pondered and I pondered and I
[1:50:06] pondered why was Rebecca in the
[1:50:09] dream why was my daughter in the dream
[1:50:13] and the lord gave me the understanding
[1:50:15] just this week and he told me he said
[1:50:18] you your

[1:50:22] clear
