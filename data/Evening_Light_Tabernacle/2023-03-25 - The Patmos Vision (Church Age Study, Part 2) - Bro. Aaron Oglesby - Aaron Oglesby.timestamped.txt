[19:27] meaningless Lord but that you will come
[19:29] now and
[19:30] in order to be more than just a as it
[19:33] were a Sunday school lesson Lord a
[19:35] review of of information but Lord allow
[19:39] us Lord to
[19:40] to let the Holy Spirit Come and anoint
[19:43] allow us to step out of the way and you
[19:45] to loose my tongue Lord that that you
[19:47] Lord could speak tonight and and reveal
[19:49] yourself to these individuals Lord in
[19:52] their own life Lord as we learned last
[19:54] time in our study that it takes
[19:56] Revelation so lord of the all the
[19:58] knowledge and all the things I could say
[20:00] or or in part Lord would do nothing
[20:02] unless it's revealed to the hearts of
[20:05] your people tonight so I'm asking that
[20:07] you'll take control now that you'll
[20:08] speak that you'll open eyes and that
[20:10] Lord something said tonight Lord by your
[20:13] spirit can be life-changing father we
[20:15] ask you to come now and take complete
[20:17] control of this service in Jesus name we
[20:20] pray amen
[20:23] amen if you have your Bibles with you
[20:26] tonight we're gonna
[20:28] start off
[20:30] by reading
[20:32] in the Book of Revelation the first
[20:34] chapter we'll start reading with the
[20:37] ninth verse and
[20:38] and this portion of the church age that
[20:40] we had asked you to read the second
[20:42] chapter the Patmos Vision it covered
[20:44] chapter one of the Book of Revelation
[20:47] verse verse 9 through 20. and um
[20:52] and what we're going to read those
[20:54] verses individually as we go along and
[20:57] this portion of scripture what we're
[20:58] going to find is in these verses 9-20
[21:00] John is going to by the spirit see the
[21:05] Lord's day he's going to see the Lord's
[21:07] Day by his spirit and he's going to get
[21:09] a glimpse of the Lord Jesus and I pray
[21:11] tonight that we can get a glimpse of him
[21:13] for ourselves tonight and and John gives
[21:16] us an incredible description of what it
[21:18] is that he sees and a large part of this
[21:21] that we're going to look at tonight is
[21:23] what we might would call maybe heavy
[21:25] material to those that haven't found
[21:27] their place in Jesus if you find
[21:30] yourself outside of Salvation tonight
[21:32] some of this would seem heavy and almost
[21:34] scary but but but you don't have to stay
[21:37] in that situation tonight if that's
[21:39] where you find yourself you don't have
[21:41] to meet him in your current condition he
[21:44] offers to you tonight that you can come
[21:46] and lay your burdens down and he will
[21:48] meet you he'll meet you right here but
[21:50] tonight I want to declare to you that
[21:52] even though we're going to see him a lot
[21:54] as judge
[21:55] he's not your judge tonight tonight he
[21:58] is still your intercessor tonight he's
[22:01] still your high priest tonight he is
[22:02] still the atonement and he's here to
[22:04] stand on your behalf but we're going to
[22:06] find as we go along that that will not
[22:09] always be the case so we're going to
[22:12] read here in in Revelation
[22:15] one and nine and it says
[22:19] I John who also am your brother and
[22:22] companion and tribulation and in the
[22:25] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was
[22:28] in the aisle that is called Patmos for
[22:31] the word of God and for the testimony of
[22:34] Jesus Christ amen you may have your
[22:37] seats tonight
[22:44] he says I John who also am your brother
[22:47] and companion
[22:50] in Tribulation
[22:52] what he's saying is as I'm partaking in
[22:55] the same troubles and the same trials
[22:58] and the same struggles that the church
[23:01] themselves are going through on a daily
[23:03] basis if I can get this thing to change
[23:05] I'd be fantastic
[23:09] oh I got to point it up there
[23:11] that's good to know he says I'm a
[23:14] brother in Tribulation and he addresses
[23:16] himself to the to the Christians as a
[23:19] brother and so what is a a state or a
[23:22] tribulation is a state of great trouble
[23:26] and again and of great suffering what
[23:28] he's saying is yes the church is going
[23:29] through these things but it's not just
[23:31] you I want you to know that I'm in the
[23:33] middle of these same trials you're not
[23:35] in this alone and that's something that
[23:37] the enemy likes to do is anytime you're
[23:39] in Trials or you're in Tribulation he
[23:41] makes you think well you're the only one
[23:43] going through this you're the only one
[23:44] suffering but John's letting them know
[23:46] Hey listen I'm a brother in these
[23:48] tribulations I'm a brother in these
[23:50] trials the same things that you're
[23:52] facing I'm facing and the church at this
[23:55] time that this is rep The Book of
[23:58] Revelation is written is going through
[24:00] some incredible trials and tribulations
[24:05] it's not working
[24:10] the first persecution with government
[24:12] backing begins under under Nero in in
[24:15] the year 64 A.D and then the second
[24:18] persecution over the mission begins in
[24:21] 80 81 and that is the the the
[24:24] persecution that we're dealing with here
[24:26] this is the person who had John put on
[24:30] the Isle of Patmos and he himself was
[24:33] known to be um inclined to Cruelty he
[24:37] had his own Brothers all wiped out so
[24:39] that they wouldn't have an opportunity
[24:41] to come to the throne he had many Roman
[24:43] Senators killed some because they stood
[24:46] up against his policies some because he
[24:48] just wanted their home and their estate
[24:50] and things of that nature so he was one
[24:52] of these Emperors that was greatly
[24:54] inclined to Cruelty and he passed a
[24:57] saying that no Christian once brought
[25:00] before the tribunal should be Exempted
[25:02] from punishment without renouncing his
[25:06] religion so once you came and stood
[25:08] before the Judgment seat as it were were
[25:10] you had no other choice but to renounce
[25:13] your religion or else face death if you
[25:16] did anything to bring yourself before
[25:18] them you had to renounce your religion
[25:22] and it was during this time that that a
[25:25] variety of fabricated Tales were were
[25:28] during his Reign composed in order to
[25:31] injure the Christians in other words if
[25:34] there was a a famine or there was a
[25:36] pestilence or there was an earthquake it
[25:39] was always laid upon the Christians
[25:41] these things happened because of the
[25:43] Christians and that's kind of how the
[25:44] pagans would operate because they would
[25:46] always place things upon their gods per
[25:48] se if there was a bad storm then to see
[25:50] God was angry because somebody did
[25:53] something wrong but in this case they
[25:55] began to lay everything at the feet of
[25:57] the Christians in order to justify the
[26:00] persecution that they were carrying out
[26:02] upon the Believers
[26:07] so at this time Christianity was
[26:09] everywhere spoken against I want to
[26:12] remind you that yes we have trials and
[26:14] yes we have tribulations and we Face
[26:17] different battles we spoke about that in
[26:18] a service recently that we're going to
[26:20] have our battles we're going to face our
[26:22] battles but we'll never face the the
[26:24] type of persecutions and the thing that
[26:26] that they face daily they were being
[26:29] imprisoned daily they were being
[26:31] persecuted they were being crucified
[26:33] they were being burned they were being
[26:35] torn asunder they were made to face wild
[26:38] beasts all for the testimony of Jesus
[26:41] Christ of course John himself we know if
[26:46] you read it in the church age book they
[26:48] boil him in oil for 24 hours and it says
[26:51] the whole time that they're boiling him
[26:53] trying to kill him he's preaching to him
[26:56] can you imagine what that must have been
[26:58] like to those people you'd think that it
[27:01] would open their eyes you'd think they
[27:03] would recognize a supernatural element
[27:05] there you would think it would bring a
[27:07] repentance but actually what it does is
[27:09] it enrages them so much that they say
[27:12] he's only able to do this because he's a
[27:14] witch so at this point they accuse him
[27:17] of being a witch in the and they
[27:18] sentence him to the Isle of Patmos now
[27:22] the Iowa Patmos
[27:25] is about
[27:26] 13.8 square miles and John stays here
[27:31] until sometime after the death of
[27:33] domitian when he is allowed to return to
[27:36] Ephesus where he will actually end up
[27:38] living out his days but at this time
[27:41] the Isle of Patmos is used as a prison
[27:43] Colony for the Roman Empire
[27:46] it is Rocky it is full of snakes it is
[27:49] full of lizards and scorpions and it has
[27:52] no infrastructure in other words you may
[27:55] see it today and you may say oh well
[27:57] that's a that's a nice looking little
[27:58] island but there was absolutely nothing
[28:00] there there was no way to shelter
[28:02] yourself there was no way to take care
[28:04] of yourself there was no way to feed
[28:07] yourself it was like being in a prison
[28:09] to a point it was a death sentence in
[28:12] and of itself and and so he's there and
[28:16] I want to show you on the map
[28:17] I showed you this map last time but if
[28:20] you'll look this is Asia Minor and we
[28:22] can see the seven churches Ephesus
[28:24] Smyrna pergament the Tyrus artist
[28:27] Philadelphia and laodicea and if you'll
[28:29] look out to the left you will see Patmos
[28:31] it's the little red dot that's in the
[28:33] ocean
[28:34] that's where Patmos was and it was it
[28:36] was off the coast of Asia Minor and I
[28:39] was watching a little clip today of them
[28:41] doing a tour there and they say on a
[28:43] clear day John would have been able to
[28:45] actually see the mainland now if I see
[28:47] it it would have probably just been a
[28:48] little line off in the water somewhere
[28:50] but on a clear day he actually could
[28:53] have seen
[28:55] the mainland now I want you to
[28:57] understand that even though this picture
[28:59] here
[29:00] doesn't look so bad
[29:02] you look at that and you're like that's
[29:03] not so bad
[29:05] but there was nothing there
[29:07] yes there's a little bit of grass but
[29:09] underneath that is absolute Solid Rock
[29:11] it's very dry there's no opportunity to
[29:13] grow things this was not a vacation they
[29:17] didn't send their worst prisoners to a
[29:19] place because it was a fun place to go
[29:21] okay this this was an actual a terrible
[29:25] place to be just to give you an idea
[29:27] about the size of this island it was
[29:29] about the size of Minden I looked up the
[29:31] square miles of Minden and it's about
[29:33] one square mile bigger than the Isle of
[29:35] Patmos was about the size of men and
[29:38] today it's actually a
[29:41] a pilgrimage spot meaning lots of
[29:43] Christians love to go there because it
[29:46] was the place where John was and there's
[29:48] actually a cave there that they claim is
[29:50] the cave of Revelation where John was
[29:52] when he received the visions and wrote
[29:54] the books and things of that nature of
[29:56] course we don't know this but you can
[29:58] actually take cruise ships to Port there
[30:01] and get off and have a good time
[30:03] John didn't go on a cruise ship
[30:06] John went on a prisonership this wasn't
[30:08] a fun thing I want you to understand the
[30:11] level of peril he was in not only in
[30:14] getting there but in staying there he
[30:16] was uncomfortable he was miserable their
[30:18] their whole point of this was this was
[30:21] an absolute punishment for what he
[30:24] believed in back then it was totally
[30:26] desolate nothing but snakes
[30:28] scorpions lizards and other prisoners
[30:31] who by the way probably didn't like you
[30:33] very much either it's not like you had
[30:34] your friends there this was not a
[30:37] camping trip
[30:39] so during this time he's on the island
[30:45] are y'all changing this or am I doing it
[30:48] so this isn't working at all
[30:54] so during this time that he's on the
[30:56] island it's around 80 95 to 96. we don't
[31:01] know exactly when he got there when he
[31:03] left but the visions that John received
[31:06] that are written down in the Book of
[31:08] Revelation that we're talking about
[31:09] tonight come to him over a over a
[31:13] two-year period
[31:14] all right and and and it was written out
[31:17] in a book of symbols and man has studied
[31:20] these symbols ever since that he wrote
[31:22] them every denomination has studied
[31:25] these symbols every Theologian has
[31:27] studied these symbols they've been
[31:28] looked at from every angle imaginable
[31:30] and from every angle what we get is a
[31:33] thousand or ten thousand ideas of what
[31:36] they meant
[31:37] you had nowhere to place your faith you
[31:40] didn't know which one was right what did
[31:42] it mean or did it really matter and you
[31:43] have to believe that if God saw fit for
[31:46] this to be in his holy Bible then yes
[31:47] these things really mattered and God
[31:50] intended for a people to know what these
[31:54] things were and so I'm so thankful that
[31:57] in this day there's no longer that we
[31:59] have to look at and prod at it and
[32:01] wonder about and what is it what is it
[32:03] but in this day in the days of the voice
[32:05] of the seventh angel there is a
[32:07] prophetic class of people who under
[32:10] their Church age messenger have received
[32:13] the revelation of these visions that was
[32:15] written in this book it's no longer a
[32:18] mystery to you and I and that should
[32:19] that should give us great joy and to
[32:21] know that God thought enough that he
[32:23] said I'm not going to let them go
[32:24] through blind I'm not going to let them
[32:26] go through in darkness but they will
[32:28] have understanding they will have
[32:29] Revelation they're going to know what it
[32:32] is I'm doing in the last day and not
[32:34] only that but he's privileged US to know
[32:36] what he's done all down Through the Ages
[32:39] so it's just not what he's doing and
[32:41] what he's going to do but for the first
[32:43] time there's a people who can look back
[32:45] and know exactly what it was and how God
[32:48] was moving down through the church ages
[32:51] it was in this day that he tears the
[32:54] cover off of the apocalypse and it
[32:56] actually becomes revealed to a people so
[32:59] you're no longer standing on I hope so
[33:01] you're no longer standing on I hope this
[33:03] is right where my church says this is
[33:05] right but you are standing on revealed
[33:07] word tonight you were standing on
[33:09] revealed truths you don't have to wonder
[33:11] about it this is the truth it has been
[33:15] revealed it has been Vindicated and God
[33:17] has come and put his stamp upon it
[33:20] brother Branham says the entire book is
[33:22] set forth in symbols and therefore it is
[33:24] the target of much criticism and dispute
[33:27] however it does have the seal upon a
[33:30] seal of God upon it that makes it
[33:33] authentic if you want to be authentic
[33:36] tonight get the Seal of God upon your
[33:38] life if you want to be authentic and you
[33:41] know sometimes we worry about what this
[33:42] thinks and who this thinks and who am I
[33:44] and what's this hey he says it has the
[33:46] Seal of God upon it so that makes it
[33:49] authentic I believe that we're an
[33:51] authentic people tonight so this covers
[33:54] where John was and during this time and
[33:56] what he was writing and we'll move to
[33:58] the next slide
[34:00] Revelation 1 and 10 says I was in the
[34:03] spirit
[34:04] on the Lord's Day
[34:06] and heard behind me a great voice
[34:09] as of
[34:11] a trumpet in the spirit
[34:14] you might as well go ahead and pull them
[34:16] all up because
[34:18] it's a battery on this thing low
[34:20] it's going to help me if I can control
[34:22] this
[34:28] I am controlling it now
[34:32] what's happening
[34:35] yeah we're gonna get this workout okay
[34:37] well awesome
[34:40] in the spirit brother Branham says you
[34:43] could just call those words the whole of
[34:47] the Christian Life if we are going to
[34:49] live as Christians we have to be in his
[34:55] Spirit brother Branham says that the
[34:58] first step in anything you do the first
[35:01] step is to get in the spirit I would
[35:06] like to say I think that I'll speak for
[35:08] myself but many times it's just as
[35:10] humans we allow too many things to
[35:12] hinder us from getting in the spirit
[35:14] whether it be at home whether it be at
[35:17] work but let's specifically look at it
[35:18] as it relates to to a church service if
[35:21] John managed to get in the spirit in the
[35:24] middle of a bunch of murderers if John
[35:26] managed to get in the spirit I don't
[35:28] think the sound system on the Isle of
[35:30] Patmos was exactly right his clicker
[35:32] probably wasn't working that day when he
[35:34] was trying to get the apocalypse written
[35:36] down there was probably all kind of
[35:38] confusing to go along with the Scorpions
[35:40] and the snakes and things bothering and
[35:42] yet John managed to get into the spirit
[35:46] when we come to church I want us to just
[35:48] push aside all the little things that
[35:49] bother us push aside what happened at
[35:52] work what happened at school what
[35:54] happened at home with Mama who's playing
[35:55] music who's not playing who sang a song
[35:58] I don't like him leading singing what is
[36:01] that compared to where John was
[36:03] just push through all those things and
[36:06] manage to get yourself in the spirit
[36:08] brother Brown says that's the first step
[36:11] get in the spirit Paul says I will pray
[36:15] in the spirit I will sing in the spirit
[36:18] I will live in the spirit I say today
[36:22] with all that's been opened up to us we
[36:24] have no excuse to not be in the spirit
[36:26] when we gather together with other
[36:28] believers with other people of light
[36:30] precious faith and we've been blessed
[36:32] with this wonderful building and we have
[36:34] wonderful singing wonderful music
[36:36] wonderful preaching everything sets up
[36:38] well for us let's be honest we don't
[36:40] exactly have hardships as it's related
[36:43] to church
[36:44] we are blessed beyond measure don't get
[36:46] spoiled by it but come in and say Lord
[36:48] today I'm going to press in today I'm
[36:50] going to press through today I'm going
[36:52] to get past all my describes distract
[36:55] distractions I'm gonna get that word out
[36:57] and I'm gonna get in the spirit
[37:01] amen
[37:03] brother Branham says
[37:06] have you ever noticed how the world gets
[37:08] in the spirit of things that are in the
[37:11] world he says they go to their ball
[37:14] games their sporting events and their
[37:17] dances they enter into the spirit of it
[37:23] now look I'm I'm just like everybody
[37:25] else I don't want to come in and just
[37:27] make things happen
[37:29] I want to come in and move in the spirit
[37:31] because the spirit's moving however
[37:33] we've made it very clear before you've
[37:34] got to give the spirit something to
[37:36] anoint
[37:36] it's called a sacrifice of praise it's
[37:39] not always just going to be everything's
[37:41] flowing so perfect these people he says
[37:43] they enter into the spirit notice he
[37:46] didn't say the spirit of it gets on them
[37:49] he didn't say the spirit of the ball
[37:51] game gets on him he says they just enter
[37:53] right on into it they choose to make the
[37:56] ball game loud
[37:58] they choose to yell and scream they
[38:01] choose to be excited they enter into the
[38:05] spirit now what's the opposite of that
[38:07] they don't sit there like Wallflowers
[38:10] an old dried up sticks so I'm just going
[38:13] to make a a little conclusion here that
[38:16] you can't be in the spirit regardless of
[38:19] what you call the spirit you can't be in
[38:22] the spirit if you're sitting like a
[38:24] Wallflower like an old dried up stick
[38:28] he goes on to say they enter right into
[38:31] the field of things
[38:37] about
[38:39] sometimes you can feel it
[38:41] they enter into it and they just feel it
[38:43] they create the feeling they create the
[38:45] excitement
[38:47] but we're not he says they enter into
[38:49] the field of things and become a part of
[38:53] things listen he's literally using this
[38:55] as an example
[38:57] of what you should do
[38:59] he says if they can do this about
[39:01] worldly things why can't you do this
[39:04] about things that pertain to God that
[39:06] pertain to your salvation that pertain
[39:08] to Healing that pertain to the Holy
[39:10] Ghost he says just enter into the field
[39:12] of things and become a part of it well I
[39:14] don't want to shout because everybody
[39:15] else is shouting he said to
[39:18] just be a part of it
[39:20] enter in
[39:22] and become a part of it what is it that
[39:25] we're getting into
[39:27] he says but oh how they hate the
[39:30] Christians for getting into the spirit
[39:34] of God's word
[39:36] the spirit he's talking about all these
[39:39] things about the field out about the
[39:41] excitement about the shouting and he
[39:42] says that's the spirit
[39:45] of God's word
[39:48] he says they call us Fanatics and holy
[39:50] rollers there's nothing they won't do to
[39:53] show their hatred and disapproval but
[39:55] ignore that you can expect it knowing
[40:00] where it's coming from just go on and
[40:03] get in the spirit of worship
[40:06] church I say it's time that we actually
[40:08] just quit worrying about what the
[40:10] critics are saying to quit even
[40:12] addressing them that they have no
[40:14] bearing over who we are what we do how
[40:17] we worship I'm reading the prophet of
[40:19] God that says forget that just go ahead
[40:21] and get in the spirit of worship if you
[40:24] feel like worship and worship if you
[40:25] come in and don't feel like just enter
[40:27] right on in just become a part of well I
[40:29] haven't felt in moving yet just get in
[40:31] the spirit of worship just go ahead and
[40:33] do it clap your hands shout amen sing a
[40:37] song If you need to run run just go
[40:39] ahead and whatever you do don't be a
[40:42] Wallflower or a dried up stick
[40:46] amen get in the spirit
[40:52] how happy can we get
[40:55] well how are we supposed to act how much
[40:56] are we allowed to act he said the
[40:59] Christian ought to be just as exuberant
[41:02] and full of his pleasure
[41:05] in the Lord as the world is when it
[41:08] Savers and delights in its pleasures
[41:14] have you ever watched a ball game where
[41:17] somebody wins at the last second
[41:20] and a hundred thousand people breaks out
[41:23] in chaos now some people would look at
[41:25] that and go well I can't believe it I
[41:27] was looking at videos of your church
[41:29] service and it looked just like people
[41:31] at a ball game Prophet said we could
[41:35] matter of fact Prophet said we should
[41:39] you ought to be just as exuberant how
[41:43] free can I get as free as you want
[41:45] how loud can I get as loud as you want
[41:48] how much can I worship as much as you
[41:50] want to worship you ought to be so
[41:51] overflowing with exuberance and joy and
[41:54] Thanksgiving that there is absolutely no
[41:57] contain of no containing it well I've
[41:59] seen people at concerts and they dance
[42:01] check he said ought to be just as
[42:03] exuberant I've seen people at concerts
[42:06] and ball games and they run and shout
[42:08] and scream check I can too he said I
[42:11] ought to be just as exuberant and as
[42:14] excited as they are listen I have every
[42:16] bit of a right to get excited about my
[42:19] salvation as they do because they won a
[42:21] ball game they're excited about being
[42:23] filled with the Holy Ghost her excited
[42:25] that I'm going in a Rapture I how dare
[42:27] us let them out worship their gods when
[42:30] we have the one true and living God we
[42:33] want to look at them I say no I'm going
[42:35] to out worship them I'm gonna out praise
[42:37] him I'm gonna give my God everything
[42:40] when I come into the house of God
[42:42] Hallelujah
[42:46] he says I was in the spirit
[42:49] on the Lord's Day
[42:51] now to some people the Lord's day
[42:54] brother Branham goes to Great length
[42:56] explaining this is the Lord's day is the
[42:59] Sabbath day which is Saturday to a lot
[43:02] of people
[43:04] and some people like The Seventh-Day
[43:06] Adventist they still make it a law you
[43:08] must go to church
[43:09] on Saturday because they believe that to
[43:12] be the Sabbath
[43:13] and this is in line with Jewish
[43:15] Traditions it was mandatory practice
[43:17] that had been described to the Jews in
[43:20] the Ten Commandments
[43:22] and what you'll find is early Jewish
[43:24] Christians those that have been
[43:26] converted from Judaism over into
[43:28] Christianity for a time did continue to
[43:31] gather on Saturday because it's what
[43:33] they knew it was what they had been
[43:35] taught but as early as the second
[43:37] century we find that many local churches
[43:40] began to meet
[43:41] on Sundays
[43:43] now it was still a back and forth thing
[43:45] some met on Sunday some met on Saturday
[43:47] but the point was there wasn't a law
[43:49] anymore as to when you should meet
[43:52] but it did come a time actually in Roman
[43:54] law many were still hanging on to
[43:56] traditions of Saturday here and there
[43:58] until the fourth Century there was a
[44:00] council of laodicea
[44:02] and and that Council they made the
[44:05] non-observance of the Sabbath officially
[44:08] approved in other words
[44:10] Christians now this is coming from the
[44:12] Catholic Church understand you no longer
[44:14] have to observe the Sabbath and they
[44:16] replaced it with Sunday following
[44:18] Emperor Constantine's blue laws which
[44:21] was passed in 321 A.D
[44:24] and it said on the venerated day of the
[44:27] sun s-u-n noticed you see the the Pagan
[44:30] tradition slipping right in there but on
[44:32] the venerable day of the sun let the
[44:34] magistrates and the people residing in
[44:37] cities rest and let all workshops be
[44:40] closed and so this is one of the first
[44:42] laws that we see where they're actually
[44:44] setting aside a certain day that has to
[44:46] do with worship and and things like that
[44:51] but what comes along in the New
[44:53] Testament is and it takes a while for
[44:55] the Jewish tradition of the Jewish
[44:57] Christians to get a hold of this is it
[44:59] was no longer in keeping a day the
[45:03] Sabbath day was no longer about whether
[45:05] it's Saturday whether it's Sunday
[45:06] whether you're allowed to go to work
[45:08] whether you're allowed to pick something
[45:09] up or or get your Ox out of the ditch it
[45:11] was no longer about these things brother
[45:14] Branham said God gave Israel the seventh
[45:16] day for their Sabbath
[45:18] in commemoration now listen close in
[45:21] commemoration of his own work wherein he
[45:24] created the world and all that was
[45:27] therein and then stopped creating he
[45:31] ceased from his labors
[45:34] he rested
[45:36] and so he gives this to Israel and
[45:38] commemoration
[45:40] but what he gave them was only in a
[45:42] shadow of an eternal rest that you can
[45:46] enter into and remain in not just a day
[45:49] of the week not just a little period of
[45:51] time set aside but you have the
[45:53] opportunity today to enter into an
[45:56] eternal rest Hebrews 4 and 8 says for if
[46:00] Jesus had given them rest then would he
[46:03] not afterward have spoken of another day
[46:05] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[46:08] people of God for he that entered into
[46:11] his rest he also has ceased from his own
[46:15] works as God did
[46:19] from his
[46:20] so this isn't only entering into a day
[46:23] of rest but it's a rest that you can
[46:24] enter into and remain in it is an
[46:28] eternal rest and and the seventh day
[46:30] given to Israel was only a type of this
[46:34] rest let's go further into what this
[46:36] rest is Matthew 11 28 come unto me all
[46:40] ye that labor and our heavy laden and I
[46:44] will give you rest
[46:46] notice he's not trying to give him a
[46:48] Saturday or a Sunday
[46:50] he says I will give you rest
[46:53] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[46:56] for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[46:59] shall find rest unto your
[47:03] Souls this is an eternal rest in other
[47:06] words this is
[47:08] eternal life he says come unto me you
[47:10] that are heavy laden it doesn't matter
[47:12] how long you've been carrying that
[47:14] burden it doesn't matter how long you've
[47:16] been trying it doesn't matter how long
[47:18] you've been failing but brother Aaron
[47:20] I've come to the Altar and I've tried
[47:21] and I failed and I've come and I've
[47:23] tried it doesn't matter how many times
[47:26] you've come how many times you failed
[47:29] how much you think you're a failure
[47:31] tonight he says come unto me all you
[47:33] that are heavy come to me he says I will
[47:37] give you rest
[47:39] young people this is true rest you'll
[47:42] never know rest until you enter into his
[47:44] rest
[47:45] you'll never know what true rest is
[47:47] until you come into that and what he say
[47:49] it was the Sabbath is ceasing
[47:53] from your works just as it was
[47:55] commemorated when the Lord had had
[47:57] finished
[47:58] um creating and he stopped and he took a
[48:00] day of rest the Sabbath is ceasing from
[48:04] your works it is you ceasing and God
[48:07] doing oh amen that's what this rest is
[48:10] you ceasing and God doing what is it it
[48:14] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[48:18] give it all to him and then he gives
[48:20] himself to you and now you have him on
[48:23] the inside and eternally you can rest
[48:26] you can rest in your salvation you can
[48:28] rest that you're gonna make it you can
[48:30] rest that you or you're going to
[48:32] overcome you can rest that you're going
[48:34] to go in a Rapture it is the Eternal
[48:37] rest no longer in a day
[48:40] brother Branham says this is the true
[48:43] Sabbath that was promised thus when they
[48:45] were filled with the Holy Ghost they
[48:47] ceased from their worldly Works their
[48:51] worldly doings their evil ways the Holy
[48:55] Ghost took charge of their lives they
[48:58] entered into rest there's your rest that
[49:02] is your Sabbath young people you haven't
[49:06] experienced true rest until you've
[49:09] entered in to that rest and the way you
[49:11] enter into that rest is by him entering
[49:14] in to you
[49:16] listen your heart whether you recognize
[49:18] it or not it's not about your physical
[49:20] body needing rest your heart cries for
[49:23] that rest your soul Christ for that rest
[49:25] no matter what you try in this world
[49:28] listen I don't ever want to stand here
[49:30] and glorify sin but I tried lots of
[49:32] things and I lived lots of different
[49:33] ways trying to satisfy something down
[49:36] here on the inside and it doesn't matter
[49:38] what you try it doesn't matter where you
[49:40] go you will never find true perfect rest
[49:43] until you allow that Holy Ghost to enter
[49:46] into you in the perfect rest of Eternity
[49:49] come upon your soul that's when you'll
[49:51] find rest no amount of drugs no amount
[49:53] of pills no amount of movies and
[49:55] entertainment is going to satisfy that
[49:57] hunger on the inside of a True Believer
[50:00] that says Lord I just need your rest I
[50:02] need your Holy Ghost to come in my life
[50:04] that's where you find rest the eternal
[50:09] rest
[50:14] so it's not a day like Saturday or
[50:18] Sunday
[50:21] when
[50:22] John says that I was in the spirit on
[50:25] the Lord's Day
[50:27] it couldn't brother Branham says it
[50:30] couldn't be just a Saturday or a Sunday
[50:32] anyway because these Visions unfolded
[50:34] over a period of two years
[50:36] so actually what happened was that John
[50:38] was caught up in the spirit and
[50:41] transported into the Lord's day which is
[50:45] to come
[50:46] a day which is in the future and John is
[50:50] seeing things by the spirit in a future
[50:53] day
[50:55] currently we're not living in the Lord's
[50:58] Day
[50:59] this is man's day
[51:01] this is the day of man it's man's rule
[51:04] man's government man's ideas why do you
[51:06] think everything's falling apart all
[51:07] around us why you think everything's so
[51:10] messed up because God is not currently
[51:13] ruling yes we know he's in control but
[51:15] we are in man's day but the day of the
[51:19] Lord is coming you can assure yourself
[51:22] that the day of the Lord is coming but
[51:25] but John is seeing into the Lord's day
[51:27] brother Brown says the Lord's Day is
[51:30] when the days of man are over
[51:34] he says the kingdom of this world will
[51:36] become the kingdoms of our God the day
[51:39] of the Lord is when the Judgment Falls
[51:41] and after that comes the millennium
[51:46] young people don't get caught up in the
[51:48] day of man
[51:49] don't get caught up in the pleasures of
[51:51] this world don't get caught up in your
[51:52] Pursuit of Happiness here yes I
[51:54] understand we have to work we have to
[51:56] pay our bills we want a car we gotta we
[51:58] want a family we want those things and
[52:00] absolutely those things or there's
[52:02] nothing wrong with you making sure you
[52:04] take care of that there is nothing wrong
[52:05] with you going to school there is
[52:07] nothing wrong with you pursuing a career
[52:09] there is nothing wrong with those things
[52:11] don't don't let it get pushed out of
[52:13] balance but what I'm telling you is
[52:14] don't get so caught up in chasing things
[52:16] here that you forget that the day of the
[52:19] Lord is upon us that the day of the Lord
[52:21] is coming and you can make all the
[52:23] preparations you want for here that's
[52:25] fine as long as you recognize that the
[52:27] most important preparations you'll ever
[52:29] gonna make is for that day the most
[52:32] important preparations you're ever going
[52:34] to make is that you know that you know
[52:36] that you know that when that day comes
[52:38] you've got no problem leaving everything
[52:40] you've gathered up in the day of man
[52:42] right here and let it burn listen I'm
[52:45] all about making all the money you can
[52:47] make as long as it doesn't hinder your
[52:48] walk with God I'm all about you being as
[52:51] successful as you possibly can be as
[52:54] long as you recognize that everything
[52:55] you succeed in here on Earth is Canon
[52:58] fodder
[53:00] and it's going to burn one day
[53:02] but that see Gene of God down on the
[53:04] inside if you're taking care of that if
[53:07] you're feeling that if you're letting
[53:08] that find its Eternal rest then when all
[53:10] this is burning you're going to be just
[53:12] fine you're going to be in glory you're
[53:14] going to be in the Millennium you're
[53:15] going to be beyond all the Realms of
[53:17] this Earth and you're going to be with
[53:19] your lord and savior I say prepare for
[53:21] that day because even though we get
[53:24] caught up and well it's been this many
[53:25] years and it's been that and I want to
[53:27] get married and I want to graduate
[53:29] all things that we all want I remember
[53:31] as a kid going I don't want the end of
[53:33] the world to come before I get married
[53:35] honest moment how many people have
[53:36] thought that
[53:37] and nobody raises their hand because
[53:39] you're lying
[53:42] just messing with you but we all have
[53:44] those things where you say I want to
[53:47] accomplish this
[53:48] I want to accomplish this don't ever let
[53:51] it supersede that I want to go home I
[53:54] want to go into Rapture I want to be in
[53:56] God's will for my life
[54:00] rest
[54:09] let me catch this back up it's going the
[54:12] wrong direction it's literally going
[54:14] backwards
[54:16] here we go
[54:18] says it here's a voice
[54:22] and the voice is like a trumpet
[54:25] anytime a trumpet is used in in the
[54:28] Bible what he's saying here this is very
[54:30] symbolic he didn't literally somebody's
[54:32] speaking and it sounded like they were
[54:34] blowing a trumpet said it was like
[54:38] a trumpet in other words when the
[54:41] trumpets were used in in the Bible it
[54:43] was a moment of urgency so he's saying
[54:45] there is an urgency in this voice there
[54:47] there is a a warning that is coming
[54:50] forth and when it tells you that was
[54:52] like a trumpet what it's telling you is
[54:53] you need to listen you need to pay
[54:55] attention there there is urgency here
[54:57] this is a warning and it's telling you
[54:59] to prepare the trumpet was never sounded
[55:02] for the people of Israel for meaningless
[55:04] things they didn't blow the trumpet to
[55:07] announce that the people over here in
[55:09] this quadrant of the camp had burned
[55:10] their beans
[55:12] we'd like everybody to know that she's
[55:15] terrible cook and so this family is
[55:18] going to be eating burned beans tonight
[55:19] you would go that was pointless
[55:22] we'd like you to know that the weather
[55:24] today is going to be 77 degrees and
[55:26] sunny
[55:27] they didn't gather up all these people
[55:29] for meaningless and pointless things if
[55:32] they blew a trumpet you better get ready
[55:34] for war if you blew a trumpet there was
[55:37] a declaration from God going forth if a
[55:39] trumpet was blown there was urgency and
[55:42] what was going to be spoken was
[55:44] something that absolutely mattered and
[55:47] so he says that the voice that came
[55:49] forth was like a trumpet and I'd like to
[55:52] say that in this day's service after
[55:54] service after service the messages that
[55:57] go forth are like a trumpet they're
[55:59] telling you get ready the day of the
[56:01] Lord's coming make sure you got the Holy
[56:02] Ghost make sure your your lamps are
[56:04] trimmed make sure you got oil it's a
[56:06] gospel trumpet going out service after
[56:08] service not just from this Pulpit but
[56:10] around the world telling you it's the
[56:12] day of man right now but the day of the
[56:14] Lord is upon us you've got to get ready
[56:17] assemble yourselves make sure you're
[56:19] ready the day of the Lord is here
[56:21] there's an urgency coming forth in other
[56:23] words John hears it and it stops him in
[56:25] his tracks and he says that voice was
[56:27] like the voice of a trumpet is something
[56:30] calling you to attention saying don't be
[56:32] caught unaware wake up wake up don't be
[56:34] snared by the cares of Life wake up
[56:36] there's a message that's going forth
[56:38] there's a Rapture come and wake up it's
[56:40] going forth like a trumpet and it's
[56:42] urgent and it's calling him
[56:47] Revelations 1 11
[56:50] and this urgent voice is saying I am
[56:53] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[56:55] and what thou seeest write in a book and
[56:58] send it and to the seven churches
[57:01] which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto
[57:03] Smyrna and unto pergamus and under thy
[57:06] Terror and under Sardis and under
[57:08] Philadelphia and unto
[57:10] laodicea
[57:13] he says write the Visions John
[57:16] make a record of what it is you're about
[57:18] to see
[57:20] make a record of them for the Ages which
[57:22] are to follow for they are the true
[57:24] prophecies which must come to pass write
[57:27] them and send them out making them
[57:32] known
[57:33] that last line there just kind of struck
[57:36] me making them known listen God doesn't
[57:38] want to remain a mystery
[57:40] he doesn't want to remain some far off
[57:42] God to you that maybe the pastor knows a
[57:45] little bit about maybe mama knows a
[57:47] little bit about but I just don't
[57:48] understand what I'm reading remember
[57:50] what we said a a Believer can never pray
[57:53] too much for Revelation you pray for
[57:55] Revelation you seek Revelation you ask
[57:57] God for more Revelation because he wants
[58:00] to be made known not just to evening
[58:03] like Tabernacle not just to this church
[58:05] or this church he wants to be made known
[58:07] to you as an individual I understand
[58:11] that we sometimes we can't just read it
[58:13] and understand it but you pray God open
[58:15] yourself to me Lord open your word to me
[58:17] reveal yourself to me and here John is
[58:21] in the same voice that spoke worlds into
[58:23] existence the same voice that was heard
[58:26] there on Mount Transfiguration booms
[58:28] forth and says here is a complete
[58:30] revelation of Jesus Christ and it says
[58:33] write it down and send it to the
[58:36] churches make them known
[58:39] he wants you to know him
[58:41] quick quick quit leaving it in Mama's
[58:43] hands and Daddy's Hands and pastors
[58:45] hands you get into the word you get into
[58:48] a prayer life you begin to study you say
[58:50] God make yourself a reality unto me
[58:54] listen I'm thankful for for Christian
[58:56] homes and I'm thankful for Godly Parents
[58:58] but when the trials and the tribulations
[59:00] comes you're not going to be able to
[59:02] hold on to Mama's anchor and Daddy's
[59:04] anchor it's got to be your anchor he's
[59:07] had to get down deep on the inside of
[59:09] your soul and the way that happens is by
[59:11] you seeking more of God you seeking
[59:15] Revelation you seeking the baptism of
[59:18] the Holy Ghost
[59:21] Revelation 1 12.
[59:24] and I turned to see The Voice
[59:27] that spake with me
[59:29] and being turned I saw seven
[59:32] golden
[59:34] candlesticks
[59:37] now a lot of the translations you read
[59:39] translated lamp stands
[59:42] instead of candlesticks seven golden
[59:45] lampstands and that's actually what
[59:46] brother Branham tells us it is as he
[59:48] begins to break it down he says these
[59:50] are actually lampstands because candles
[59:52] can't give continuous light candles burn
[59:54] out
[59:55] and eventually the wax has gone and he
[59:57] said but a lamp drawing its oil from
[1:00:00] from a from a reservoir can burn forever
[1:00:03] it's it's never going to go out and as
[1:00:06] we will read later in verse 20 that
[1:00:09] these lamp stands are the seven churches
[1:00:12] so he turns and he sees seven golden
[1:00:15] lamp stands
[1:00:17] and verse 20 tells us these lampstands
[1:00:19] are the seven churches and we can get a
[1:00:23] great description of these lamp stands
[1:00:25] if we'll go over to Zechariah 4.
[1:00:29] in chapter chapter 4 verse one and we're
[1:00:32] going to read through this
[1:00:34] and it says in the angel that taught
[1:00:35] with me came again and wake me as a man
[1:00:37] that is waking out of his sleep and he
[1:00:40] said unto me what seeth thou
[1:00:42] and I said I have looked and behold a
[1:00:44] Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[1:00:47] the top of it and his seven lamps there
[1:00:49] on and seven pipes to the seven lamps
[1:00:52] which are upon the top thereof
[1:00:54] and two olive trees buy it one on the
[1:00:57] right side of the bowl and the other
[1:00:59] upon the left side of the bowl
[1:01:02] so I answered and spake to the angel
[1:01:04] that taught with me saying what are
[1:01:06] these my Lord
[1:01:08] then the angel that talked with me
[1:01:09] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[1:01:11] not what these be
[1:01:12] and I said no my Lord
[1:01:14] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:01:16] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:01:18] his Aruba saying not by might nor by
[1:01:22] power but by my spirit
[1:01:25] saith the Lord so what we see here in
[1:01:28] Zechariah is the lamp stands Burning
[1:01:30] Brightly
[1:01:31] and the reason that they're able to be
[1:01:33] doing that is because they have a source
[1:01:36] of oil
[1:01:37] they're not burning on their own power
[1:01:39] but they're drawing their life from this
[1:01:42] source of oil and it's getting its oil
[1:01:44] from the olive trees so there's one on
[1:01:47] the right and there's one on the left
[1:01:49] and these olive trees represent the Old
[1:01:52] Testament and the New Testament
[1:01:55] and the oil of course we know represents
[1:01:57] the Holy Ghost and Zechariah here tells
[1:02:00] the angel I don't know what this means
[1:02:01] and the angel says not by might nor by
[1:02:05] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[1:02:08] hosts in other words there is no light
[1:02:11] without my spirit the church can do
[1:02:14] nothing in their own without the Holy
[1:02:16] Ghost you can do nothing without the oil
[1:02:19] there will be no light listen you can't
[1:02:22] do anything in your own strength but
[1:02:25] brother I've been trying to do this and
[1:02:27] I've been trying to do right and I've
[1:02:28] been trying you can keep trying and
[1:02:31] you'll keep failing he says it's not by
[1:02:33] your might not by your strength but by
[1:02:36] his power saith the Lord you've got to
[1:02:38] get the wick dipped into the oil and
[1:02:40] then that light will shine then you
[1:02:42] don't got to try to produce the fire you
[1:02:44] just got to let that oil burn you just
[1:02:46] got to let that light come out of you
[1:02:48] you just got to let it manifest itself
[1:02:50] it's no longer you doing the works
[1:02:53] because by Your Own Strength you can do
[1:02:55] nothing there must be oil in your lamp
[1:02:59] that's what he's telling him not by
[1:03:02] night nor by power but by my spirit by
[1:03:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you must
[1:03:08] have that in your life brother Aaron why
[1:03:10] so much preaching on the Holy Ghost why
[1:03:13] so much preaching on the power of the
[1:03:14] Holy Ghost and we need the Holy Ghost
[1:03:16] and you've got to have the token you got
[1:03:17] to have the Holy Ghost because without
[1:03:19] it you can do nothing much less the
[1:03:23] things that we're commissioning to do in
[1:03:24] John 14 12 the Greater Works if we can't
[1:03:27] do nothing we sure can't do the Greater
[1:03:29] Works if we can't do nothing we sure
[1:03:31] can't overcome the devil but he says by
[1:03:34] my spirit I say Lord I need your spirit
[1:03:36] I need more than I've ever had I want
[1:03:38] you just to keep filling the reservoir
[1:03:40] let the light burn greater than it's
[1:03:42] ever burned I don't have to worry about
[1:03:44] it burning out because there's an
[1:03:46] endless supply
[1:03:48] of his oil
[1:03:50] Hallelujah
[1:03:52] what's amazing about this is you see
[1:03:54] that there's one reservoir
[1:03:57] that contains all the oil
[1:04:00] remember now the lamp stands represented
[1:04:03] the churches
[1:04:04] so the church at Ephesus in the first
[1:04:06] age isn't getting from one reservoir
[1:04:09] in the church down here in laodicea
[1:04:11] drawing oil from another Reservoir
[1:04:13] but the seven lampstands are all drawing
[1:04:16] from the same Reservoir
[1:04:18] of oil
[1:04:20] the seven lamps are lit and they burn
[1:04:23] by the same old brother Branham says
[1:04:25] first the priest took the fire from the
[1:04:27] sacred altar which was originally lit by
[1:04:30] the fire of God
[1:04:32] he lit first of all the lamp that was
[1:04:35] sitting on the top of the bowl then he
[1:04:37] let the second lamp from the flame off
[1:04:39] the first lamp then the third lamp
[1:04:42] received its fire from the second lamp
[1:04:44] as did the fourth receive it from the
[1:04:47] third and so on until all seven lamps
[1:04:50] were burning
[1:04:52] he says the original outpouring of
[1:04:55] Pentecost which outpouring came direct
[1:04:58] from Jesus on the mercy seat is in doing
[1:05:01] his church through all seven ages
[1:05:06] he just said what they had at Pentecost
[1:05:08] is exactly what you can have the
[1:05:10] outpouring at Pentecost is in doing his
[1:05:12] church through all seven ages and
[1:05:14] showing forth perfectly that Jesus
[1:05:17] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:05:20] forever and never changing God in his
[1:05:23] Essence in his ways what are you saying
[1:05:28] brother and I'm saying you can have the
[1:05:29] exact same experience they had in the
[1:05:31] upper room it's the exact same fire it's
[1:05:34] the exact same oil it's the exact same
[1:05:36] life and so therefore it will produce
[1:05:38] the exact same thing well what do I need
[1:05:41] that for because they overcame him and
[1:05:44] through that same experience you'll
[1:05:45] overcoming they cast Satan out you'll
[1:05:48] cast Satan now where they were filled
[1:05:50] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:05:52] will be filled with the baptism of the
[1:05:54] Holy Ghost it's the same oil it's the
[1:05:56] same fire going from lamp to lamp to
[1:05:59] lamp to lamp and in this day it's not a
[1:06:02] man-made fire but it's the original fire
[1:06:04] lit by the fire of almighty God when it
[1:06:07] came down and divided itself in licks of
[1:06:09] fire and fell upon 120 I say Lord let
[1:06:12] that same Fire Light My Soul tonight
[1:06:14] like this youth group tonight let it
[1:06:17] burn in evening light Tabernacle
[1:06:22] he says I am the Vine
[1:06:24] you are the branches
[1:06:27] the life
[1:06:28] comes through the Vine
[1:06:30] and the fruit
[1:06:32] comes through the branches
[1:06:34] listen that's why we can't help but
[1:06:36] bring forth another book of Acts
[1:06:39] that's what brother Branham said that
[1:06:41] puts forth another Branch it would write
[1:06:43] another book of Acts behind it why
[1:06:47] because the acts
[1:06:49] was the fruit
[1:06:51] I'm not talking about the book I'm
[1:06:53] literally talking about the things they
[1:06:54] did that made them write the book
[1:06:56] the ax
[1:06:58] was the fruit that was coming out of the
[1:07:01] branch that was drawing its strength
[1:07:02] from the Vine
[1:07:03] and if we're drawing our strength from
[1:07:05] the same oil the same Reservoir and
[1:07:08] that's coming up through us through the
[1:07:10] vine and we put forth another Branch
[1:07:12] then the fruit on our branch is going to
[1:07:14] be a book of Acts fruit it's going to
[1:07:16] look the same act the same talk the same
[1:07:18] speak in tones the same shout the same
[1:07:20] oh come on some people don't like it I'm
[1:07:22] just telling you what the prophet said
[1:07:24] it's going to be exactly the same
[1:07:27] because if we're drawing from the same
[1:07:29] Life Source and we are an original
[1:07:31] Branch not a grafted Branch but an
[1:07:35] original Branch coming forth from the
[1:07:37] vine than our fruits must match the
[1:07:40] original fruits
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:45] original life
[1:07:47] drawing from the same source that they
[1:07:49] drew from
[1:07:50] on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:52] you must draw from that original life in
[1:07:55] other words you must draw from the same
[1:07:57] Basin of oil if you're drawing your oil
[1:08:00] from a different Basin that it's not
[1:08:01] going to be even the same fire it's
[1:08:03] strange fire
[1:08:04] you can read about that in the Old
[1:08:05] Testament you don't want Strange Fire in
[1:08:07] the camp it's got to be the same oil
[1:08:09] producing the same fire every believer
[1:08:12] now not just every messenger
[1:08:16] every believer
[1:08:19] drawing from the same source
[1:08:21] dead to self not drawing from Aaron
[1:08:23] Oglesby
[1:08:24] not drawing from your life Source but
[1:08:27] you're dead to self
[1:08:28] sealed in Christ and the life flowing
[1:08:31] through you now is the same life that
[1:08:34] fell at the first the same fire that
[1:08:37] fell in the first it is original fire
[1:08:40] brother Branham says every True Believer
[1:08:43] is depicted in the lampstands
[1:08:46] listen this I love this thought he says
[1:08:48] no man can pluck them out of his hand
[1:08:50] their lives cannot be tampered with now
[1:08:52] take this this is talking about you this
[1:08:55] isn't The Messengers this isn't the
[1:08:57] pastors this is you the believer
[1:08:59] their lives cannot be tampered with the
[1:09:03] visible life is burning and Shining
[1:09:06] giving light and manifestations of the
[1:09:08] Holy Ghost the inner invisible life is
[1:09:11] hidden in God and fed by the Lord's word
[1:09:14] Satan cannot touch them I want you to
[1:09:18] hear that again Satan cannot touch you
[1:09:21] oh but he's been telling me this and
[1:09:23] fear and anxiety has been scratching at
[1:09:24] my door Satan cannot touch you he says
[1:09:28] he cannot pluck them out of his head
[1:09:30] tonight you were in the hand of almighty
[1:09:32] God and Satan cannot touch you he'll try
[1:09:35] to he'll try to get you to let him in
[1:09:37] but if you sit there and say no sir I'm
[1:09:39] sealed by the same oil I'm sealed by the
[1:09:42] same fire you have no right you can't
[1:09:44] touch me you cannot get a hold of my
[1:09:47] life you can't have my family you can't
[1:09:48] have my health you can't have my
[1:09:50] experience you can't have my joy you
[1:09:52] can't have my peace Satan can not touch
[1:09:56] you I say somebody needs to take that
[1:09:58] tonight and let it down deep underneath
[1:10:01] the fifth rib that's for you he cannot
[1:10:04] touch you
[1:10:05] Hallelujah
[1:10:08] the original life
[1:10:10] Revelation 1 13.
[1:10:13] and in the midst of the seven
[1:10:15] candlesticks
[1:10:17] one like unto the son of man
[1:10:20] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[1:10:22] and gird about the paps
[1:10:24] with a golden girdle
[1:10:29] now
[1:10:33] this is kind of where it gets like I
[1:10:34] said earlier a little bit heavier
[1:10:38] because we see here John recognizes
[1:10:43] a changing
[1:10:45] where it goes from priests
[1:10:47] to judge
[1:10:51] and John is seeing this in the Lord's
[1:10:53] day and brother Branham says this is the
[1:10:55] Lord's day for John sees him standing
[1:10:57] not as priests
[1:10:58] but John sees him as the coming judge
[1:11:03] and you can recognize this because the
[1:11:05] golden girdle
[1:11:08] is no longer around his waist where a
[1:11:10] priest would wear it
[1:11:12] but it is now around his shoulders like
[1:11:15] a judge would wear it
[1:11:17] listen these are things that for for
[1:11:19] centuries people just read over and read
[1:11:21] over and read over and these things
[1:11:23] didn't stand out but you have a prophet
[1:11:24] in this day come and say every little
[1:11:26] detail matters
[1:11:29] every little facet matters every
[1:11:32] description matters and he says it's now
[1:11:34] over his shoulder the way a judge
[1:11:37] would wear it
[1:11:39] we know that right now
[1:11:41] he is currently our high priest and he
[1:11:44] is our intercester intercessor but
[1:11:47] that's not something that's going to
[1:11:49] last forever
[1:11:50] right now he can be touched by the
[1:11:52] feelings of your infirmities
[1:11:54] but John sees him here as his role was
[1:11:56] changing from that of of priest to judge
[1:12:00] and it says in John 5 22 for the father
[1:12:03] judgeth no man
[1:12:04] but hath committed all judgment
[1:12:07] unto the son
[1:12:09] and brother Brown says what we're seeing
[1:12:11] here in this scripture is actually the
[1:12:12] Fulfillment of that scripture there in
[1:12:15] John
[1:12:17] so what we're seeing is a time where the
[1:12:19] days of Prophecy
[1:12:21] are finished
[1:12:22] you know we just see down through the
[1:12:24] Bible that this is going to happen and
[1:12:25] then this is going to happen and this is
[1:12:26] going to happen and he says the days of
[1:12:28] Prophecy are finished
[1:12:30] and he has come to a place where he is
[1:12:32] no longer interceding for the Lost
[1:12:35] he is no longer interceding for those
[1:12:37] that haven't accepted him but he has
[1:12:39] turned to judge
[1:12:42] and tonight even as we go through the
[1:12:44] rest of this I'll probably say it over
[1:12:45] and over again because as I study this
[1:12:47] is so weighed upon my heart that I want
[1:12:49] to urge you to find him tonight while he
[1:12:51] can still be found as intercessor while
[1:12:54] he can still be found as priests while
[1:12:56] he can still be one that can be touched
[1:12:57] by the feelings of your infirmity why
[1:12:59] he's still standing there with his blood
[1:13:00] saying calling saying come unto me all
[1:13:03] you that are heavy laid and I will give
[1:13:05] you rest that's the call tonight but
[1:13:07] it's not the call that's going to go on
[1:13:09] forever because there's coming a time
[1:13:11] where he's no longer going to be
[1:13:12] interceding and he's going to be judging
[1:13:14] but right now there is still Mercy to be
[1:13:16] had listen we've still we preach mercy
[1:13:18] and we believe there is Mercy to be had
[1:13:21] we preach Grace and we believe that
[1:13:23] Grace is still here but there is coming
[1:13:25] a day it is the Lord's day and John saw
[1:13:28] it where the priesthood is over and he
[1:13:31] stands now girded no longer as a priest
[1:13:33] but he stands girded
[1:13:36] as a judge
[1:13:37] Revelation 1
[1:13:39] 14-16 and every one of these as we go
[1:13:42] through them I want you to keep in mind
[1:13:44] we're seeing him as judge
[1:13:46] every detail points back to his
[1:13:48] judgeship
[1:13:49] it said his head and his hairs were
[1:13:51] white like wool as white as snow in his
[1:13:54] eyes were as a flame of fire
[1:13:56] and his feet like undefined brass as if
[1:13:59] they burned in a furnace and his voice
[1:14:01] has the sound of many Waters and he had
[1:14:04] in his right hand Seven Stars and out of
[1:14:07] his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword
[1:14:09] and his countenance was as the sun
[1:14:12] shineth
[1:14:13] in his strength
[1:14:16] in these verses like I said we continue
[1:14:18] to see him as judge even though John is
[1:14:21] describing him in his seventh-fold glory
[1:14:23] it's still as judge I'm very sorry that
[1:14:27] that got that small I didn't mean to do
[1:14:28] that I'll read it to you we'll be okay
[1:14:32] so the Sevenfold Glory of his person
[1:14:35] every descriptive attribute that we just
[1:14:38] read in those three verses every little
[1:14:40] description has significance
[1:14:43] it all matters we'll start there it said
[1:14:46] his hair as white
[1:14:48] as snow
[1:14:50] this isn't telling you that God got old
[1:14:54] okay this isn't an old man
[1:14:57] humans that tends to happen but what
[1:15:00] it's saying here is is that he's crowned
[1:15:03] in wisdom
[1:15:04] it is speaking of his wisdom it's
[1:15:07] showing us that the judge is crown and
[1:15:09] wisdom it's exactly how Daniel saw him
[1:15:11] in the Old Testament I want to go there
[1:15:13] and and read that for you
[1:15:15] Daniel 7 and 9 says I beheld till the
[1:15:18] Thrones were cast down and the Ancient
[1:15:21] of Days did sit whose garment was white
[1:15:24] as snow and the hair of his head like
[1:15:27] pure wool his throne was like the fiery
[1:15:30] flame and his wheels as burning fire a
[1:15:33] fiery stream issued and came forth from
[1:15:36] before him thousands thousands
[1:15:38] ministered unto him and ten thousands
[1:15:40] time ten thousand stood before him the
[1:15:43] Judgment was set and the books
[1:15:47] were open
[1:15:49] so what we see here is John and Daniel
[1:15:52] see him exactly the same way they see
[1:15:55] him I love the continuity of the
[1:15:57] scripture how it all lines up they both
[1:15:59] see him as a wigged one hair white as
[1:16:02] wool and and Daniel describes it as the
[1:16:05] judgment and we know that John's seeing
[1:16:07] him as the judge in his boat lining up
[1:16:09] now I'm going to show you this picture
[1:16:14] it's actually symbology that even the
[1:16:16] world understands when you see this
[1:16:19] other if I say what does this mean other
[1:16:23] than saying well it means they were
[1:16:24] stupid
[1:16:26] because why would you do that
[1:16:30] as young people I you know you look at
[1:16:31] you're like what are they doing
[1:16:33] but it wasn't necessarily a status thing
[1:16:37] it was what judges did
[1:16:40] this was a judge and and wearing this in
[1:16:43] ancient courts the judge would appear
[1:16:44] dressed in a white wig in a long robe
[1:16:47] that signified complete Authority
[1:16:51] so John sees him and he sees it's an
[1:16:55] authority Daniel sees him and he sees
[1:16:57] it's an authority and it's something
[1:16:59] that people can relate to because they
[1:17:01] knew that judges wore these robes and
[1:17:03] they wore these these Whigs the
[1:17:05] symbology here is unmistakable that he
[1:17:09] is being seen as a judge we can no
[1:17:12] longer argue it's the priesthood there
[1:17:14] is no doubt Daniel saw him John saw him
[1:17:17] the the dispensation has changed he is
[1:17:20] now
[1:17:21] the judge
[1:17:25] his eyes is fire
[1:17:30] you're the first sermon I ever preached
[1:17:32] came from this
[1:17:33] I called it the eyes of Christ and I was
[1:17:36] dealing with this same thought that
[1:17:38] you know these are the eyes that were
[1:17:40] once full of compassion
[1:17:42] these are the eyes that wept at the tomb
[1:17:45] of Lazarus
[1:17:46] these are the eyes that saw visions
[1:17:49] these are the eyes that that would look
[1:17:51] beyond the evil of those crucifying and
[1:17:53] say father forgive them they don't even
[1:17:54] know what they're doing
[1:17:58] eyes that would look on lepers and and
[1:18:00] feel compassion and heal them these are
[1:18:03] the eyes we're talking about
[1:18:05] but now they have turned to Eyes Of Fire
[1:18:08] because now they are the eyes of the
[1:18:11] judge
[1:18:12] brother Brown says now those eyes are a
[1:18:14] flame of fire the eyes of the judge who
[1:18:17] will recompense those who have rejected
[1:18:20] him
[1:18:21] he says there is nothing hidden that
[1:18:23] shall not be revealed
[1:18:25] I want you to listen young people
[1:18:28] many times we think well I did that in
[1:18:29] secret I kept that from Mom Mom and Dad
[1:18:32] don't even know that's going on well the
[1:18:34] preacher don't know and oh it's cute and
[1:18:36] it's funny and we have things hit listen
[1:18:38] I'm not saying that just because I think
[1:18:40] so I know I'm not that old I remember
[1:18:43] I'll just say it I remember when I was a
[1:18:46] rebellious teenager
[1:18:47] I remember even when I was trying to
[1:18:50] live right and still there was things
[1:18:52] you didn't want people to know because
[1:18:53] you were failing to live right so you
[1:18:55] hit them
[1:18:56] you hid these things
[1:18:58] he says there is nothing hidden that
[1:19:00] shall not be revealed
[1:19:02] for all things are naked before him with
[1:19:05] whom we have to do think of it he knows
[1:19:08] even now what you are thinking
[1:19:14] as a young person that statement used to
[1:19:16] always shock me awake
[1:19:19] tonight
[1:19:20] instantly Lord forgive that thought
[1:19:23] I'm very sorry you know in those moments
[1:19:25] your carnal and you're 14 and you're
[1:19:27] going I'm sorry that I haven't been
[1:19:29] paying attention in church and I was
[1:19:30] thinking about all this other stuff but
[1:19:31] it's much deeper than that he knows even
[1:19:34] now what you're thinking he says yes
[1:19:37] there he stands as judge with flaming
[1:19:39] eyes to meet out judgment the day of
[1:19:42] Mercy is over
[1:19:45] oh that men might repent and seek his
[1:19:49] face in righteousness while there is yet
[1:19:51] time
[1:19:52] listen young people God is is so patient
[1:19:55] God is so full of love and he's so kind
[1:19:58] but there is coming a time where he must
[1:20:00] judge
[1:20:02] there Comes A Time because he is a just
[1:20:04] God where Justice must be meted out
[1:20:07] and John was in the Lord's day looking
[1:20:09] upon the day of the Lord when he comes
[1:20:11] not as a prophet not as a priest not as
[1:20:14] a king but he's coming as judge
[1:20:17] and what I'm telling you tonight is
[1:20:18] wherever you're at tonight you don't
[1:20:20] ever want to look into those eyes as the
[1:20:22] eyes of a judge you don't ever want to
[1:20:24] look into those eyes as the eyes of fire
[1:20:26] but tonight he's still looking through
[1:20:28] eyes of compassion tonight he's still
[1:20:30] looking through eyes of Grace tonight
[1:20:32] he's still looking down saying come unto
[1:20:34] me I'll give you rest yes you fail but I
[1:20:37] have compassion yes you fail but I have
[1:20:40] the rest you need that you won't fail
[1:20:42] anymore and he's looking tonight saying
[1:20:44] I don't ever want to look at you through
[1:20:46] eyes of judgment but that day is coming
[1:20:49] that time is coming but right now
[1:20:52] there's Mercy right now his eyes have
[1:20:54] compassion right now his eyes have Grace
[1:20:56] and right now he's wanting you to come
[1:20:59] unto him as your intercessor the
[1:21:01] atonement still works he's telling you
[1:21:03] tonight it's not too late for Mercy it's
[1:21:06] not too late
[1:21:08] for Grace
[1:21:11] still on the theme of judgment because
[1:21:13] this is what John is seeing
[1:21:15] he's seeing him as judge and it says
[1:21:17] there in our reading and his feet like
[1:21:19] undefined brass
[1:21:21] as if they burned
[1:21:23] in a furnace
[1:21:26] brass signifies All Through the Bible
[1:21:29] brass signifies Divine judgment
[1:21:34] we see the serpent of brass on the on
[1:21:36] the pole
[1:21:38] represented sin judged Divine judgment
[1:21:42] we'll read that there in numbers 21-8 it
[1:21:45] says and the Lord said unto Moses make
[1:21:47] thee a fiery Serpent and set it upon a
[1:21:49] pole and it shall come to pass that
[1:21:51] everyone that is bitten when he looked
[1:21:53] at the opponent shall live
[1:21:55] and Moses made a serpent of brass
[1:21:58] and put it upon a pole and it came to
[1:22:01] pass that if the serpent had bitten any
[1:22:03] man when he beheld The Serpent of brass
[1:22:06] he lived
[1:22:08] so the serpent of brass on the pole
[1:22:10] represented sin judged remember brass
[1:22:13] signifies Divine judgment and Israel had
[1:22:17] sinned
[1:22:18] and therefore they had to be judged and
[1:22:21] so it being made of brass showed that
[1:22:23] Divine judgment had already fallen upon
[1:22:26] the thing it had already fallen upon
[1:22:28] sin's curse so whoever looked upon it
[1:22:30] and accepted the significance of it was
[1:22:34] healed of the serpent bite and I'm
[1:22:36] telling you tonight if you've been
[1:22:38] bitten by the serpent if the things of
[1:22:40] the world have got a hold of you and
[1:22:42] that poison has gotten on the inside of
[1:22:44] you it's where you can't see yourself
[1:22:45] being saved you can't see yourself being
[1:22:48] filled with the Holy Ghost you can't see
[1:22:49] yourself overcoming he says tonight just
[1:22:52] look and live just look and live sin was
[1:22:55] judged sin hung on a cross and told he
[1:22:58] became sin that you might become his
[1:23:00] righteousness he says tonight you can
[1:23:02] once again look and live because sin has
[1:23:05] been judged
[1:23:10] the temple altar where sacrifices were
[1:23:13] made was made out of brass
[1:23:15] Elijah in his days when God withheld the
[1:23:18] Reigns the sky was described as brass
[1:23:21] because it was God's judgment
[1:23:24] so once again his feet being made out of
[1:23:26] brass once again point us to he is now
[1:23:29] judge
[1:23:31] he is judging even even in his feet we
[1:23:34] see judgment is being declared
[1:23:39] his feet of brass it says
[1:23:42] his feet have withstood the furnace
[1:23:45] what's that mean it's not talking about
[1:23:48] trials and tribulations necessarily like
[1:23:50] we go through you know we go through
[1:23:52] fiery trials
[1:23:54] but this is actually speaking of what he
[1:23:56] did for you
[1:23:58] he alone faced the Wrath and the
[1:24:02] judgments of God
[1:24:04] he took the wrath of God he took your
[1:24:06] judgments and he faced them
[1:24:08] he was he was the just being beaten and
[1:24:11] judged for the unjust
[1:24:13] he was wounded for your transgressions
[1:24:15] he was bruised for your iniquities he
[1:24:18] suffered like no man suffered ever
[1:24:20] before and he took all that judgment for
[1:24:23] you and so now these feet that were that
[1:24:26] were pierced for you these feet that
[1:24:28] took the wrath of God for you they they
[1:24:31] they they have withstood the furnace or
[1:24:33] the judgments of almighty God and now
[1:24:36] these feet that were pierced will stand
[1:24:38] on the earth as judge
[1:24:40] he went through judgment but now he has
[1:24:42] earned the right to stand and judge
[1:24:45] brother Branham says but someday those
[1:24:47] feet of brass will stand upon the earth
[1:24:49] and the judge of all the Earth he shall
[1:24:52] be and with equity and Perfection will
[1:24:55] he judge mankind
[1:24:58] listen he took judgment for you but if
[1:25:02] you don't accept it then one day he must
[1:25:04] judge you
[1:25:07] So In This Moment he took your judgment
[1:25:10] he took your punishment he did all these
[1:25:12] things for you but when he comes on that
[1:25:13] day and he stands and he sees one
[1:25:16] standing there that didn't accept it and
[1:25:18] he took that Whip and of that for their
[1:25:19] life for nothing
[1:25:21] he took that beaten for their life
[1:25:22] specifically for nothing and so because
[1:25:25] of that now he will judge them for
[1:25:27] turning that down that judgment that he
[1:25:29] took but I say Lord in my life you
[1:25:31] didn't take it for nothing in my life
[1:25:33] that beaten wasn't for nothing that
[1:25:35] crucifixion wasn't for nothing but it
[1:25:36] saved me Lord it healed me Lord Your
[1:25:39] Life release came back and filled me
[1:25:41] with the Holy Ghost Lord in my life it
[1:25:43] wasn't for nothing I want him to Judge
[1:25:47] Me Now by the word I want to be judged
[1:25:49] now so I never have to face his
[1:25:51] judgments then
[1:25:53] brother Branham says he that is unjust
[1:25:56] will be unjust still
[1:25:59] he that is filthy will be filthy still
[1:26:02] the unchanging one will not change then
[1:26:04] for he never has and never will
[1:26:07] those feet of brass will crush the enemy
[1:26:09] they will destroy the Antichrist the
[1:26:12] Beast and the image and all that is vile
[1:26:14] in his sight he will destroy the church
[1:26:16] systems and that have taken his name
[1:26:18] only to corrupt its Brilliance and crush
[1:26:21] them along with the Antichrist all the
[1:26:23] wicked The Atheist the agnostics the
[1:26:26] modernists the Liberals will all be
[1:26:28] there death Hell In The Grave will be
[1:26:31] there yes they will for when he comes
[1:26:33] the books
[1:26:35] will be open
[1:26:37] and like I said earlier if you read that
[1:26:39] and you're on the wrong side of
[1:26:40] Salvation tonight that sounds scary
[1:26:42] but to the believer tonight there's
[1:26:44] nothing scary and that what I read is
[1:26:46] the feet of brass will crush the enemy
[1:26:48] this is victory for the believer this is
[1:26:51] victory for those that are safe in
[1:26:53] Christ that has entered into that
[1:26:54] Eternal rest this is this is that enemy
[1:26:56] of Torment that's been upon your life
[1:26:58] his feet of brass crushed that thing
[1:27:00] this is that that sickness that has
[1:27:02] tormented your family his feet of breath
[1:27:04] crushed that thing this is a Victorious
[1:27:07] moment where the feet of brass come and
[1:27:09] they crush the enemy that is in your
[1:27:11] life I say tonight look and live don't
[1:27:14] be crushed by the feet but let that
[1:27:16] those feet crush the enemy that has
[1:27:18] tried to crush you tonight but you got
[1:27:21] to look and live now you got to look to
[1:27:23] the to the Cross now you have to accept
[1:27:25] his atonement for your sins now because
[1:27:28] you don't want to meet him as judge then
[1:27:31] these feet can be the greatest weapon
[1:27:33] that has ever gone before you
[1:27:36] but to many there will be the very thing
[1:27:38] that crushes them as he comes to judge
[1:27:40] the Earth
[1:27:44] he says when he comes he will take over
[1:27:46] the kingdom for it is his and with him
[1:27:49] will be thousands times ten thousands
[1:27:52] his bride who come to minister to him
[1:27:55] glory oh it is now or never repent
[1:27:58] before it is too late wake up from
[1:28:00] amongst the dead and seek God to be
[1:28:03] filled with his Spirit or you will miss
[1:28:07] eternal
[1:28:08] life
[1:28:12] don't meet him in the condition you're
[1:28:14] in tonight
[1:28:15] don't meet him as a sinner you can take
[1:28:18] care of that tonight it's nothing more
[1:28:20] than just it's not some big fancy thing
[1:28:22] you have to do you just gotta get to the
[1:28:24] place where you say God I know I haven't
[1:28:25] entered into that rest yet I want to
[1:28:27] enter into that rest I want I want to
[1:28:29] move from from from judgment on that day
[1:28:32] to where I can come in that day and hear
[1:28:33] well done my good and faithful servant
[1:28:35] it's not something you have to carry on
[1:28:37] and living a life of fear am I going to
[1:28:39] make it am I going to go on a Rapture am
[1:28:41] I going to be left behind he said in
[1:28:43] that day you shall know you don't have
[1:28:46] to guess whether he's in you and you're
[1:28:47] in him he said You shall know I say Lord
[1:28:50] let us know tonight let me know let my
[1:28:52] anchor get down deep that I know that I
[1:28:54] know that I know that I know that on
[1:28:56] that day I won't see you as judge but
[1:28:58] I'll see you as friend I'll see you as
[1:29:00] the bridegroom I see you with as one
[1:29:02] With Arms Wide Open that say come unto
[1:29:04] me that's the desire of my heart for
[1:29:07] each and every one of you tonight
[1:29:11] foreign
[1:29:14] the sound
[1:29:16] of many Waters
[1:29:19] it says his voice was at the sound of
[1:29:21] many Waters
[1:29:23] and Waters represents peoples
[1:29:26] multitudes
[1:29:27] Nations
[1:29:29] and tongues
[1:29:30] so his voice is as the sound of
[1:29:34] multitudes
[1:29:35] speaking
[1:29:39] brother Branham says it's the voice of
[1:29:41] judgment
[1:29:45] he says take heed this very hour for at
[1:29:48] this moment your thoughts are being
[1:29:49] recorded in heaven
[1:29:51] there your thoughts speak louder than
[1:29:55] your words
[1:29:58] he says for these are the voices of the
[1:30:01] multitudes of witnesses listen now about
[1:30:03] the voice of many Waters
[1:30:06] this just so jumped out at me he says
[1:30:08] who by the Holy Spirit All Through the
[1:30:10] Ages hath testified to Christ and
[1:30:13] preached his gospel it will be the voice
[1:30:16] of every man rising in judgment Against
[1:30:18] The Sinner who would not take warning
[1:30:21] the voices of the seven Messengers will
[1:30:23] be heard loud and clear those faithful
[1:30:25] preachers who preach the saving power of
[1:30:28] Jesus who preach water baptism in Jesus
[1:30:30] name who preached the infilling of the
[1:30:32] power of the Holy Ghost who stood with
[1:30:34] the word more than they stood with their
[1:30:36] own lives all of them were the voice of
[1:30:40] Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost down
[1:30:43] through
[1:30:44] the ages
[1:30:47] and if you stand there that day
[1:30:50] on the wrong side of judgment every
[1:30:52] opportunity you ever had will Flash
[1:30:54] before your eyes
[1:30:56] every sermon you ever heard preached
[1:30:59] will replay in your ears
[1:31:01] every time the Pastor said this and you
[1:31:03] thought oh that's just brother Tim he's
[1:31:05] so old-fashioned
[1:31:07] oh that's just Mom and Dad
[1:31:09] what do they know they're they're not a
[1:31:10] teenager
[1:31:11] in every opportunity and every warning
[1:31:14] and every sermon and everything as it
[1:31:17] rises up as a voice of many Waters in
[1:31:20] your ears
[1:31:22] and you hear it over and playing and
[1:31:23] playing brother Branham would say it
[1:31:25] would sound like a a Rushing River going
[1:31:28] over the cataracts if you don't know
[1:31:29] what cataracts are that's like a giant
[1:31:31] waterfall with all the rocks and it'd be
[1:31:33] it'll be roaring in your ears the voice
[1:31:35] of judgment as you hear every sermon
[1:31:38] every voice every messenger it says
[1:31:40] every man
[1:31:42] rising in judgment
[1:31:44] Against The Sinner who would not take
[1:31:47] warning
[1:31:49] it's rough
[1:31:51] what a scary moment
[1:31:53] what an awful time
[1:31:55] and I tell you that's not a sound I ever
[1:31:57] want to hear
[1:31:59] instead of that on that day you can hear
[1:32:01] well done
[1:32:03] my good and faithful servant
[1:32:05] he says and someday now this is right
[1:32:08] after he talks about the cataracts he
[1:32:10] says and someday we will hear that same
[1:32:12] sweet voice speak not in judgment but in
[1:32:17] welcome to us whose sins have been
[1:32:19] remitted by his blood whose lives have
[1:32:22] been Spirit-filled and whose walk was in
[1:32:24] the word what could be more precious
[1:32:27] than to hear the multitudes those same
[1:32:29] multitudes that while ago would have
[1:32:31] been terrifying to hear to hear the
[1:32:33] multitudes of welcoming voices and be
[1:32:36] surrounded by those multitudes who have
[1:32:39] believed unto eternal life make that
[1:32:42] your goal tonight on that day let it be
[1:32:44] a welcoming multitude a multitude that
[1:32:46] says welcome you did it welcome you made
[1:32:49] it you overcame and Satan's eating you
[1:32:51] got down and you got beat down but you
[1:32:53] wouldn't quit you wouldn't stop you got
[1:32:55] back up and you went again and you got
[1:32:57] back up and you win again and you got
[1:32:58] back up and you went again welcome my
[1:33:01] good and faithful servant you did it
[1:33:03] enter into the joys of the Lord that's
[1:33:06] what I want to hear that's what I want
[1:33:08] to hear from every single one of you
[1:33:09] welcome welcome welcome
[1:33:13] I say welcome tonight welcome his
[1:33:16] presence welcome it into your heart
[1:33:19] welcome it in so that on that day he'll
[1:33:22] welcome you in
[1:33:23] Hallelujah
[1:33:25] you don't have to hear the sound of
[1:33:27] judgment
[1:33:32] oh God May none of us hear that sound
[1:33:36] he says in his right hand
[1:33:41] or Seven Stars
[1:33:44] we're told in verse 20 that these are
[1:33:47] these seven stories it says in the
[1:33:49] mystery of the Seven Stars are the
[1:33:50] Angels or The Messengers of the seven
[1:33:53] churches
[1:33:55] the Seven Stars Are The Messengers to
[1:33:57] the seven successive Church ages in
[1:34:00] other words there is one to each age
[1:34:03] don't ever forget that when this one
[1:34:05] Rises and that one Rises and I'm the
[1:34:07] eighth messenger and I'm here to finish
[1:34:08] it no no there's one to each age
[1:34:11] we have received our Prophet messenger
[1:34:14] we have received our church age
[1:34:15] messenger and each messenger is
[1:34:18] identified
[1:34:19] and Vindicated by almighty God
[1:34:22] as each age would would drift away from
[1:34:25] God and get further and further away the
[1:34:27] messenger would come and and then he
[1:34:29] would turn them back to the word and God
[1:34:31] would vindicate that what he was saying
[1:34:33] is the truth through signs and wonders
[1:34:36] and miracles
[1:34:38] and brother Branham says I found that
[1:34:40] interesting he said that the messenger
[1:34:43] would always be accused of being Holy
[1:34:46] Rollers
[1:34:48] and I thought if the messenger to the
[1:34:50] Ages were always accused of being Holy
[1:34:53] Rollers I think it's just fine if we are
[1:34:56] yeah well Holy Roller and y'all are a
[1:34:58] little bit Pentecostal and y'all get a
[1:35:00] little bit excited brother Brandon says
[1:35:01] every messenger was accused of being a
[1:35:04] Holy Roller
[1:35:06] I say if it's been too long since you've
[1:35:08] been accused of being a holy roll or
[1:35:09] shame on you
[1:35:11] if it's okay for The Messengers to be
[1:35:13] accused of that I'll take that I don't
[1:35:15] mind it one bit
[1:35:17] but he says that every True Believer is
[1:35:20] found
[1:35:21] in the hand of God not just the
[1:35:23] messengers he says every True Believer
[1:35:26] is in the hand of God and can draw from
[1:35:29] his love and power and receive the full
[1:35:32] benefit of all that God is to the
[1:35:35] believer I want you to key in on this
[1:35:36] tonight
[1:35:37] so many times and I know I'm even guilty
[1:35:40] of it many times I sit right there and
[1:35:41] you you see certain Gifts of different
[1:35:44] Ministries operating
[1:35:46] and it's not that you're jealous but you
[1:35:48] you look at certain ones and and you
[1:35:51] think well this one's higher and this
[1:35:52] one's here and this one's here and this
[1:35:54] one's more spiritual and and I'm just
[1:35:57] here
[1:35:57] and brother Branham goes and says it
[1:35:59] ain't just The Messengers it ain't just
[1:36:01] the greatest gift and he's pointing to
[1:36:04] something Beyond any gift we have
[1:36:06] standing around here today he says it's
[1:36:08] not just for them every True Believer
[1:36:10] how many is Believers tonight
[1:36:12] is in the hand of God and can draw from
[1:36:16] his love and power and receive the full
[1:36:20] benefit of all that God is to the
[1:36:23] believer listen
[1:36:25] this right here struck me so hard what
[1:36:28] God gives the messenger
[1:36:32] so I'll say it like this so we have no
[1:36:33] doubts what God gave brother Branham
[1:36:38] and How He blesses and uses brother
[1:36:41] Branham
[1:36:43] is an example to all believers of his
[1:36:47] goodness and care to all members of his
[1:36:51] body amen
[1:36:53] I say we've been selling ourselves awful
[1:36:55] short for far too long and we've been
[1:36:57] living far below our privileges for far
[1:36:59] too long it's not just for some
[1:37:01] hierarchy to operate in the Supernatural
[1:37:03] this isn't the doctrines of the
[1:37:05] Nicolaitans where we find you know just
[1:37:07] just the preacher can have the
[1:37:08] Supernatural and just the prophet can
[1:37:10] have it and the rest of you just have to
[1:37:11] sit out there and try to absorb it but
[1:37:13] brother Branham said it's for all of you
[1:37:15] to have all of you can have a taste all
[1:37:17] of you can operate in the Supernatural
[1:37:19] it's for every last believer because all
[1:37:22] of us are drawing our strength all of us
[1:37:24] are drawing our life from the exact same
[1:37:27] reservoir of oil listen when it goes
[1:37:30] back to the day of Pentecost they were
[1:37:32] all endued with power from on high it
[1:37:35] doesn't say Peter got it and the rest of
[1:37:37] them just had a little bit different
[1:37:38] they were all received the same baptism
[1:37:41] of the Holy Ghost you can live in power
[1:37:43] you can live in the Supernatural you can
[1:37:46] overcome the enemy you tonight well
[1:37:48] who's he talking to I'm talking to you
[1:37:50] it is for you you are in the hand of God
[1:37:53] and you can draw your strength from
[1:37:55] there tonight Hallelujah
[1:38:01] he goes on and says
[1:38:03] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[1:38:05] two-edged sword
[1:38:07] which is the word of God
[1:38:12] it is the discerner
[1:38:14] we've all seen it maybe you've never
[1:38:16] experienced it but I know I've
[1:38:17] experienced it multiple times not
[1:38:19] necessarily where the preacher would
[1:38:20] stand here and say
[1:38:22] and Call My Name by turning pointing at
[1:38:24] me
[1:38:25] but where the word calls my name by by
[1:38:28] repeating precisely conversations I had
[1:38:30] maybe the night before or on the way to
[1:38:33] church or maybe a doubt I had in my
[1:38:35] heart and that word will go right down
[1:38:37] in there and it still discerns the
[1:38:38] thoughts and intents of the heart and
[1:38:40] speaks directly to that need and as a
[1:38:42] human your first instinct is
[1:38:44] somebody told him
[1:38:48] you're right
[1:38:49] the Holy Spirit did
[1:38:52] you don't know how many times I've
[1:38:53] preached things and then I thought man
[1:38:55] that was a flop man that didn't go over
[1:38:57] well you know I I didn't it just didn't
[1:39:00] go the way I thought then somebody come
[1:39:02] and say you're not going to believe that
[1:39:03] you were dealing with this exact
[1:39:04] situation such and such such as by any
[1:39:07] chance have you talked to so and so not
[1:39:09] in an accusing kind of way but almost
[1:39:11] just in a way of wanting to make sure
[1:39:13] did God just speak to me tonight
[1:39:17] and and you recognize that he's still
[1:39:19] the discerner his word is still a a
[1:39:22] sharp two-edged sword Hebrews 4 12 says
[1:39:24] for the word of God is quick and
[1:39:26] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:39:29] sword piercing even to the dividing
[1:39:31] asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the
[1:39:34] joints and Morrow and as a discerner of
[1:39:37] the thoughts and intense
[1:39:40] of the heart
[1:39:42] brother Branham says it is going to
[1:39:44] discern All Nations and all men just
[1:39:47] like it did Nathanael when Nathanael
[1:39:49] came and he said you know I saw you when
[1:39:51] you were underneath the tree it was a
[1:39:53] discerner it went right into his
[1:39:54] thoughts it went right into where he had
[1:39:56] been
[1:39:57] and he says the word of God will show
[1:39:59] who did the will of God
[1:40:02] and who didn't do the will of God
[1:40:05] works are going to be judged by the word
[1:40:08] motives will be judged by the word those
[1:40:11] who claim to believe but didn't live
[1:40:14] will be judged all by the word
[1:40:19] he says every secret will be shouted
[1:40:22] from the housetops
[1:40:27] imagine how exposed you would feel every
[1:40:30] thought every secret every word every
[1:40:32] deed even the motives of your words when
[1:40:36] you said something nice but you really
[1:40:37] didn't mean it exposed
[1:40:41] when you did this and you raised your
[1:40:43] hands and you did this and you went here
[1:40:45] or whatever you did but the motive
[1:40:47] behind it
[1:40:48] exposed no secrets
[1:40:51] he says every Secret
[1:40:54] will be shouted from the Housetop
[1:40:58] now once again that's not something
[1:41:00] for us to fear
[1:41:02] because we're not on the side of that
[1:41:04] we're saying Lord expose me now
[1:41:06] Lord if there's anything in my life that
[1:41:08] needs fix and expose it now let the word
[1:41:10] speak to me now let me deal with it at
[1:41:13] an altar now I don't want to deal with
[1:41:14] it then he says the word preached is
[1:41:17] like a flaming two-edged sword don't let
[1:41:21] that scare you that's exactly what we
[1:41:22] need because the word preach it is quick
[1:41:25] and it is sharp that means it's alive
[1:41:27] that means it'll go right out there and
[1:41:29] that sharp sword will cut out bitterness
[1:41:30] and then it'll come right over here and
[1:41:32] it'll cut out unbelief and then it'll
[1:41:34] come right over here and the preaching
[1:41:35] and the words going forth and you're
[1:41:37] sitting there and if you're accepting it
[1:41:38] and it'll come in it'll cut out
[1:41:39] selfishness and it'll come over here and
[1:41:41] you've been dealing with a with
[1:41:42] Rebellion it'll cut out Rebellion I say
[1:41:44] Lord let that sword go and start doing
[1:41:46] surgery in my life Lord I know there's
[1:41:48] places I've fallen short but tonight
[1:41:49] Lord do surgery on my heart do surgery
[1:41:52] in the young people of Eden like
[1:41:53] Tabernacle cut out Rebellion cut out
[1:41:55] unbelief cut out selfishness cut out
[1:41:58] those things oh I've been struggling in
[1:41:59] my body it'll come in and it'll cut out
[1:42:01] sickness brother Branham spoke and put
[1:42:04] the word upon his on his lips and then
[1:42:06] his wife had a tumor in her body
[1:42:08] thousands of miles away and it went
[1:42:10] there in that sharp two-edged sword cut
[1:42:12] that tumor right out it'll cut out
[1:42:14] sickness out of your life oh by that
[1:42:16] sword the sick are healed by that sword
[1:42:19] shackles are broken chains are pushed
[1:42:21] back people are set free it's not
[1:42:23] something that scares us that sharp
[1:42:25] two-edged swords we say operate Lord
[1:42:27] operate by Your Word operate in your
[1:42:30] power be quick be sharp and cut off the
[1:42:32] things in my life that need to be cut
[1:42:35] off
[1:42:36] it cuts out what we needed to cut out
[1:42:39] now
[1:42:40] so that we don't stand before it then
[1:42:44] now it is an instrument wielded to bring
[1:42:46] you freedom
[1:42:47] but then that instrument will bring
[1:42:49] death as it cuts out those and sends
[1:42:52] them to judgment that never would accept
[1:42:54] it
[1:42:55] but he says that word that sharp
[1:42:57] two-edged sword has never failed in the
[1:43:00] mouths of believing Christians once
[1:43:05] again that sword is judgment to the
[1:43:06] world but you can take it now and let it
[1:43:09] judge that Affliction in your life you
[1:43:12] can take it now and let it judge that
[1:43:13] unruly tongue in your life unruly spirit
[1:43:16] in your life judge that spirit that
[1:43:18] haunts you and that sword will come in
[1:43:20] and cut it off it'll cut that chain
[1:43:24] it'll cut that anxiety it'll cut that
[1:43:27] fear
[1:43:28] you got to recognize what those things
[1:43:29] are they're only chains that are trying
[1:43:31] to keep you from coming to the full
[1:43:32] manifestation of what God intends you to
[1:43:34] be it's not making you an unbeliever
[1:43:36] that anxiety that fear that thing rising
[1:43:39] up trying it's not keeping you from
[1:43:41] being a Believer but it's keeping you
[1:43:42] from realizing your full potential as a
[1:43:44] Believer and it's keeping you from going
[1:43:46] deeper and it's keeping you from going
[1:43:47] further and tonight the sword of the
[1:43:49] word of the words come in and going
[1:43:50] you're free you can walk in Freedom you
[1:43:53] can go into the depths you can serve him
[1:43:55] with all your heart you can worship him
[1:43:57] with all your heart oh Hallelujah you
[1:43:58] don't have to face him in the Judgment
[1:44:00] tonight you're free young people you're
[1:44:02] free to serve him you're free to have
[1:44:04] eternal rest you're free to go in a
[1:44:06] Rapture you're free to be Overcomers
[1:44:08] because the sword of the word has come
[1:44:10] in this day and it's cut you free I say
[1:44:13] rejoice in your freedom rejoice in your
[1:44:16] Liberty Hallelujah you never have to
[1:44:19] stand before him as judge
[1:44:24] says his face
[1:44:28] was like the sun
[1:44:30] and we're getting close to being done
[1:44:32] here
[1:44:34] and his countenance was as the sun
[1:44:36] shineth in its strength
[1:44:38] if we go back to Matthew 17 we see other
[1:44:40] examples of this when it speaks of Mount
[1:44:42] Transfiguration it says and it bringeth
[1:44:44] them up into a high mountain apart and
[1:44:46] was transfigured before them and his
[1:44:48] face did shine as the sun
[1:44:51] Revelation 21 23 in the city had no need
[1:44:55] of the son
[1:44:57] neither of the moon to shine in it for
[1:44:59] the glory of God did lighten it and the
[1:45:02] lamb is the light thereof you ever think
[1:45:06] about that his faith his face shine like
[1:45:08] the sun when Paul saw him on the road to
[1:45:10] Damascus it was so it was so bright it
[1:45:12] was like the sun it put his eyes out and
[1:45:15] then it goes for and says there's no
[1:45:16] need for the sun or moon there because
[1:45:18] his face his glory shineth like the Sun
[1:45:21] what a light that's shining in this day
[1:45:23] what a light that John saw when he
[1:45:25] looked down through time and it's never
[1:45:27] it doesn't matter how dark the world has
[1:45:29] gotten that light has not been put out
[1:45:31] Satan has tried to put it out and I say
[1:45:33] it's still shining in layout to see her
[1:45:35] it's still shining in my heart it's
[1:45:37] still shining in your heart it's a light
[1:45:39] that overcomes Darkness let that shine
[1:45:41] that light shine down into the dark
[1:45:43] places of your heart tonight down into
[1:45:45] the crooks and into the crannies where
[1:45:47] the things are that you don't want to
[1:45:48] deal with let that light get down in
[1:45:50] there let the son of righteousness arise
[1:45:53] tonight and let that light shine with
[1:45:55] healings in its wings for your life
[1:45:57] there he is shining in the midst of the
[1:46:01] seven golden candlesticks
[1:46:03] his glory shining in every Church age
[1:46:08] I like that it says he was in the midst
[1:46:10] that means he was there in the middle of
[1:46:12] all the ages
[1:46:13] he was seen in our age church he was
[1:46:15] seen in laodicea he didn't say he was
[1:46:17] walking there and after the sixth age
[1:46:19] his face dimmed a little bit no but it's
[1:46:22] shining like the sun in this day so that
[1:46:24] you would have light so that you could
[1:46:26] see so that you could overcome
[1:46:29] brother Brandon says there he stands the
[1:46:31] judge the one who suffered and died for
[1:46:34] us he took the wrath of divine judgment
[1:46:36] upon himself he tread The Wine Press of
[1:46:39] the fierceness of the wrath of God alone
[1:46:41] as we have already stated to The Sinner
[1:46:43] his voices is the sound of the Cataract
[1:46:46] or the surf pounding in ways of death
[1:46:48] upon the Rocks but to the Saints his
[1:46:51] voice is as the sound of sweetly singing
[1:46:53] Brook as you lie at rest satisfied in
[1:46:56] Christ shining upon us with the warming
[1:46:59] rays of love he says fear not I am he
[1:47:02] which was which is which is to come I am
[1:47:06] the almighty besides me there is no
[1:47:08] other I am the Alpha and the Omega I am
[1:47:12] all of it
[1:47:13] are you ready to meet him I'm ready to
[1:47:16] meet him but I'm not ready to meet him
[1:47:17] as judge I'm ready to meet him as one
[1:47:19] that his voice is sweetly singing to the
[1:47:22] brook As I lie at rest I'm ready to meet
[1:47:24] him as One Shining upon me with his
[1:47:26] warming rays of love as he and it says
[1:47:29] fear not I am he which was which is I'm
[1:47:33] asking tonight
[1:47:34] will that voice be a voice of judgment
[1:47:36] to you
[1:47:39] or will it be a voice that says fear not
[1:47:42] enter into rest
[1:47:44] is it a voice of cataracts and rocks
[1:47:50] is it a consuming light of rays that
[1:47:52] come to consume his enemies
[1:47:54] or is it the light of warmth shining
[1:47:57] upon your back
[1:48:00] you don't have to feel the consuming
[1:48:02] fire consuming you unto death you can
[1:48:04] say Lord consume me with your life
[1:48:06] take control of me now so that I don't
[1:48:08] have to face you in that way
[1:48:12] that brings us to Revelation 1 17 and
[1:48:14] 18.

[1:48:18] feet is dead and he laid his right hand
