[9:14] them in prayer also we have a request to
[9:16] remember brother Joel Forney we have a
[9:20] note just saying that hits a major fluid
[9:25] in his chest they found out that one of
[9:27] the pills he was taking was just causing
[9:28] a lot of different interactions so they
[9:31] changed the medication around and he
[9:33] already lost 40 pounds worth of fluid so
[9:36] he's talking a lot clearer he's almost

[9:55] done for brother Ron a man but we're
[9:57] just expecting nothing less than the
[9:59] miraculous for him as well as for sister
[10:01] Karen I was able to speak to her for a
[10:03] while this evening and she sounds like

[10:10] come back that a her memory is good she
[10:13] was transferred to a rehab facility

[29:09] here upon this earth Lord we know that
[29:12] we're just right at the right at the
[29:15] cusp of the coming of the Lord
[29:17] looking over the brink at it father and
[29:19] seeing prophecy fulfilled and things
[29:22] around us taking place the very signs
[29:24] Lord of your coming or we're thankful
[29:28] that we can see those things Lord Lord
[29:31] that were not blinded by the glare of
[29:33] Sodom Lord but God we've had a personal
[29:36] visitation Lord with an angel God as
[29:39] called as my name and let us know who we
[29:42] are father what a blessed people we are
[29:45] tonight Lord we just want to say how
[29:47] much we love you and appreciate you Lord
[29:49] and we thank you for all that you've
[29:52] done for us Lord but where would we be
[29:55] if it wasn't for you and your grace in
[29:57] our lives and Lord calling the sword out
[29:59] of darkness into this marvelous light
[30:01] nor does many that's walking away
[30:04] there's many of this saying that ain't
[30:05] true there's many Lord that's maybe even
[30:08] sitting on the edge Lord and wondering
[30:10] about it but god I'm so thankful Lord
[30:12] and hearts tonight you've anchored it so
[30:15] deeply Lord that all the storms of hail
[30:17] could come against us we as Lord of
[30:20] every kind Norda blow but god we're just
[30:23] gonna rise above it all gonna rise above
[30:26] it all today Lord and we're just looking
[30:29] for your presence Lord to be here among
[30:31] us father to speak to us to touch our
[30:34] hearts to touch your lives Lord Lord I
[30:37] know there's those here today that
[30:39] really needs a touch from you lord
[30:41] or they cried out to you they asked for
[30:44] it father and they're needing you today
[30:47] we just ask that you would come by and
[30:49] minister we pray or there's many that
[30:52] couldn't be here tonight may you just
[30:54] touch them as well we ask it in your
[30:56] name for your glory and for your honor
[30:58] in Jesus name Amen amen let's turn in
[31:04] our Bibles to 1st Corinthians 15
[31:08] amen is good to be in the house of the
[31:10] Lord as you've heard my mother was moved
[31:15] today to a specialized rehab facility
[31:19] she's thankfully not needing rehab on
[31:23] him on her mind or her bodily functions
[31:26] per se but just on strength you know
[31:28] from being in bed in the bed for two and
[31:31] a half weeks and not moving very much in
[31:33] that manner while we got a lot to be
[31:35] thankful for
[31:36] and just a miracle that God has done for
[31:39] our family and our church here
[31:41] amen to bring a person back from the
[31:44] brink of death and the doctors even not
[31:47] giving any hope but God who is rich in
[31:49] mercy amen we think the Lord for that
[31:53] first Corinthians 15 and verse 51 it
[31:57] says behold I show you a mystery we
[32:00] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[32:04] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[32:08] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[32:11] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[32:14] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[32:18] for this corruptible corruptible must
[32:21] put on incorruption and this mortal must
[32:24] put on immortality so when this
[32:27] corruptible shall have put on
[32:29] incorruption this mortal shall have put
[32:31] on immortality then shall be brought to
[32:35] pass the saying that is written death is
[32:38] swallowed up in victory Oh death where
[32:42] is thy sting o grave where is thy
[32:46] victory
[32:46] a man will let you be seated this
[32:49] evening like to just kind of continue on
[32:53] the thought have been on for the last
[32:55] a couple of Wednesday's on pressurized
[32:58] pressurized and just looking back a
[33:01] little bit as we been a few weeks since
[33:03] we spoke on this with Lord Lord just
[33:06] bringing some more things to a heart and
[33:08] just looking at this word pressurized it
[33:11] means to be brought to or maintained and
[33:15] an atmospheric pressure higher than that
[33:19] of the surroundings or greater than that
[33:22] of the surroundings and I believe there
[33:25] is a people that has been inoculated
[33:27] against the pressures of this world and
[33:30] there are great pressures in this world
[33:32] and is seemingly getting in more than
[33:34] seemingly it is getting worse it's the
[33:38] government's and things and all the
[33:39] things is going on if you look upon that
[33:41] and you and you and you feed upon that a
[33:44] lot and you're feeling that very much
[33:46] you'll become very disillusioned and
[33:48] very depressed about the things that's
[33:50] happening in this world but I'm thankful
[33:53] that that is not our hope that is not
[33:56] why we gathered here tonight to have
[33:58] hope in the government of the United
[33:59] States or have hope in this world of any
[34:02] sense or any form but we gathered here
[34:05] because we have a greater hope and that
[34:07] hope is the coming of the Lord Jesus and
[34:09] I I believe there's a people that's
[34:11] going to be able to stand in the most
[34:13] evil day there's ever been a menace that
[34:16] be able to stand and stand for
[34:18] righteousness and stand for holiness and
[34:21] and stand for the supernatural moving
[34:23] among us stand amen for the kingdom of
[34:26] God and able to take the pressure
[34:28] because there is going to be pressure
[34:30] against us amen you know people are
[34:32] looking for the squeeze that come
[34:33] against the bride well congratulations
[34:35] we're here amen and it's not going to
[34:38] get any better but it's going to get
[34:39] tighter and tighter and tighter until we
[34:41] just pop out of this old dimension and
[34:43] go to be with him amen in other words
[34:45] there's a power but in other words
[34:47] there's a power greater or higher than
[34:50] the power that's on the outside you know
[34:52] the devils want you to get your eyes on
[34:54] the outside and show how great he is and
[34:57] how how how impossible it seems or how
[35:01] how you know sickness may seem
[35:02] impossible or how great it is but you
[35:05] never forget the power that's on the
[35:07] inside of a Holy Ghost
[35:09] believer is greater than anything he
[35:11] could ever bring it's greater than any
[35:13] sickness he could ever put upon the
[35:15] Church of God is greater than any
[35:17] pressure he could ever put upon the
[35:19] Church of God amen that pressure or that
[35:21] Spirit of God as whether Aaron spoke
[35:23] about is there is a greater wind Amen
[35:26] there's a Holy Ghost that is greater and
[35:28] it has enough and it's more than enough
[35:30] for any situation that we could ever
[35:32] face and there's going to be a people
[35:35] that's even inoculated or pressurised
[35:37] against death itself
[35:39] amen that death is going to try to come
[35:42] but this corruptible must put on
[35:44] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[35:47] immortality and I believe that we're
[35:50] looking at a people that step in from
[35:51] getting ready to step from being mortal
[35:54] to be an immortal from being corruptible
[35:57] to be an in corruption amen amen I
[36:00] believe there's a people that's being
[36:01] ready and conditioned into such a place
[36:03] and we see the world that's being
[36:05] conditioned to a Tribulation their been
[36:07] their mind as being conditioned to drift
[36:09] tribulation period of tribulation amen
[36:12] to come upon this earth to where their
[36:14] minds would go so insane and that begin
[36:16] their imaginations run so wild and their
[36:18] insanity and we see the insanity of that
[36:21] dimension coming in this world and it's
[36:24] pressing upon every person it does not
[36:26] have a man there's not any kind of a
[36:28] code or any kind of a small print that
[36:31] says either you're white or black or red
[36:33] or yellow it's coming upon every person
[36:35] and it's coming upon every Amen male
[36:38] female amen they're being conformed into
[36:41] the image of that world at the world
[36:43] they underneath the world and we see
[36:45] there that hell is being unleashed in
[36:47] this hour and it's coming more and more
[36:50] and more into fruition in the body of
[36:53] people upon this earth but so as we see
[36:55] that that that dimension is being more
[36:57] fulfilled and more amen showing itself
[37:00] in and in the form of flesh so shall
[37:03] that other dimension also amen begin to
[37:06] show more and more of itself amen he
[37:08] said when all hell turns loose all
[37:10] heaven turns loose with it Amen so if
[37:13] you see hell turning loose into this
[37:15] dimension and the insanity of the
[37:18] world and the mind of the devil being
[37:20] put upon people and you see it more and
[37:22] more and more you got to say Amen heaven
[37:25] is also turning loose that there's a
[37:27] people that's coming in the mind of
[37:29] Christ and they're getting more and more
[37:31] and more into his mind until they're
[37:33] going to take a body change amen and
[37:35] this is the world that we're living in
[37:37] we're living in a very scientific world
[37:39] and we're living in a time that never
[37:41] before amen in the seven churches is a
[37:44] man that never has been able to make a
[37:46] man take from this dimension and to move
[37:49] into another dimension until the time
[37:51] that we're living in and it's only
[37:53] speaking of him n is the natural say man
[37:55] speaks of the supernatural it's only
[37:57] speaking of that we are now for the
[37:59] first time in human history a man a man
[38:03] a body that's able to go from this
[38:05] dimension into another dimension
[38:08] hallelujah by the body change and so we
[38:10] see science has been able to prove this
[38:12] and they take an astronaut as saying as
[38:15] we spoke only sings and I want to just
[38:17] go for a minute and they can go forward
[38:19] so far till you can't even see it with
[38:21] their natural eyes no more and it'll go
[38:24] so far into the pressure of another
[38:26] dimension he said he can just go on out
[38:28] because it's me he's in a pressurized
[38:30] tank he can go and he can go into
[38:33] another place and sail around and see
[38:36] the world all around him he said so it
[38:39] is there is a spiritual age and there's
[38:41] a spiritual time where God is going to
[38:44] have spiritual astronauts and I still
[38:48] can't help but believe that in the
[38:50] middle of all this chaos and in the
[38:52] middle of all the struggle then the
[38:54] trials of life that are going on and the
[38:56] coronavirus and the riots and all this
[38:58] that in the middle of that that there
[39:00] would be a rocket lifts off any man I
[39:03] believe that's showing something to us
[39:05] said his brother Brennan would speak
[39:06] count down he would see in his age of a
[39:09] rocket taking place and he would say hey
[39:10] not only they're doing that in the
[39:12] scientific world but I'm telling you God
[39:15] is also doing that in the spiritual
[39:17] world and then in the middle of all this
[39:20] chaos around us that we'd see a rocket
[39:22] taking taking off a man I believe it's
[39:24] God just letting us know don't forget
[39:26] now
[39:27] we're on so we're on set and set and go
[39:29] we're ready to take off out of this so

[41:40] would believe there could be an
[41:41] astronaut that it'd be somebody that
[41:43] would believe and say yeah I believe if
[41:45] I got in that rocket I can go into
[41:47] another plane I had to be somebody John
[41:50] Glenn or any of the other ones that
[41:51] would say hey I believe enough to get in
[41:54] there more come on somebody has to be
[41:58] enough be enough before somebody that I
[42:01] believe enough to say I believe and I'm

[42:11] I'm going to get into the Word of God
[42:14] I'm gonna get into what he said
[42:17] hallelujah and by their belief that
[42:22] natural scientists achieved by man to go
[42:26] into another atmosphere and you can
[42:29] believe that but people won't say well I
[42:32] don't believe in God I don't believe in
[42:34] God I don't look but you can believe a
[42:36] man by his own two little orders one
[42:39] little pea-brain could come up with
[42:41] enough ideas enough drawings to take a
[42:43] man off of this earth and put him into
[42:45] another atmosphere you can believe that
[42:47] or even believe about a man who could
[42:50] hook it in his own little brain he come
[42:52] up with the idea of a car and you had
[42:54] enough belief in that man to get in that
[42:56] car and come to church amen you had
[42:58] enough belief in that man to believe in
[43:00] him to get in the airplane and go in the
[43:01] sky it took belief to get in there you
[43:05] believe that when you got in that
[43:07] airplane you're gonna get in that
[43:08] airplane and go to your destination
[43:10] why because you believe that or you
[43:12] wouldn't get in it I wouldn't get in it
[43:15] I wouldn't get in the car if I didn't
[43:16] believe that car is gonna start and get
[43:18] me to my destination I wouldn't get in
[43:21] that car and people's got enough faith
[43:23] to bless what it is is faith
[43:25] hey man and they can believe in man the
[43:28] man that has failed time after time a
[43:30] man that hasn't done nothing but made
[43:32] things work for himself yet they can't
[43:34] believe in a card that can come on the
[43:37] sea and change her life forever don't
[43:42] tell me you ain't no God don't tell me
[43:46] you ain't got any something in you to
[43:47] believe in a God when you can believe in
[43:48] a man to do those kind of things a
[43:52] spiritual astronaut he meant living in a
[43:56] spiritual age and natural men were able
[44:00] to achieve by natural abilities what
[44:02] they achieve and God is saying I need a
[44:05] man he'll stay with the Bible that'll
[44:09] stay with the Word of God and I won't
[44:11] stay with he's the same yesterday today
[44:13] and forever and not afraid of the
[44:15] promises regardless of what anybody else
[44:18] says don't you know John Glenn had
[44:21] enough people in his ear trying to tell
[44:22] him you're crazy this is impossible
[44:24] you're gonna die you're not going to
[44:26] make it back but he had enough faith to
[44:27] believe I'm gonna get in there and I'm
[44:30] coming back and I'm going into another
[44:32] dimension I'm going into another place
[44:34] amen he had enough faith to believe that
[44:36] no matter what anybody else said
[44:41] hallelujah and don't get on me when I
[44:43] got enough faith to believe that this
[44:45] body is going to change that this body
[44:48] is gonna come I got enough faith to
[44:50] believe that the dead in crisis went
[44:52] down on the grade they're all going to
[44:53] rise again hey man I got enough faith to
[44:56] believe that if somebody gets sick God's
[44:58] got enough power to heal them
[45:00] I got enough faith to believe that if
[45:01] you'll come and humble yourself and
[45:03] repent of your sins gonna save you I got
[45:06] enough faith to believe he's the same
[45:08] yesterday today and forever
[45:10] [Applause]
[45:19] here he wants you to become an astronaut
[45:23] that a ghosts are so far beyond
[45:26] denominational thinking or beyond man's
[45:29] thinking beyond anything else beyond
[45:32] they meant even beyond the things of a
[45:35] church but with God and him alone you
[45:39] know in order to be an astronaut you had
[45:42] to get in a tank and it was something
[45:44] they couldn't control themselves I mean
[45:46] they had a few little buttons they could
[45:48] push but it was something underneath
[45:49] them that could it could really cause
[45:52] some issues and it had done it but even
[45:56] later on you know in the eighties when
[45:57] they had that that one blow-up and then
[45:59] in the 90s when they had the other one
[46:01] blow-up returned to Earth there's a lot
[46:03] of things that could have issues with it
[46:05] but there was still people even beyond
[46:07] the issues we're still getting a rocket
[46:09] just a few days ago come on now and
[46:15] people want to say well there's issues
[46:16] at that church there's issues with
[46:18] believing there's issues with God and
[46:20] stuff there's a lot of issues but
[46:21] there's a lot of issues with man but
[46:24] they don't keep people from believing
[46:26] they don't keep people from saying yes
[46:28] it is possible yes we can go there
[46:31] amen why because they know Amen that is
[46:34] there and they're able to move amen they
[46:36] are able to push these buttons do
[46:38] whatever it takes taming the light
[46:40] diffuser light it off and into another
[46:42] dimension amen and so man's got enough
[46:45] about them to believe in that in a
[46:47] man-made rocket in a man-made
[46:48] instruments and man-made math and
[46:51] man-made everything man-made everything
[46:54] they're sitting on yet they still had
[46:56] enough in them to say I'm getting in it
[46:58] and I'm leaving here then what's wrong
[47:02] with the people of God saying Amen this
[47:05] ain't a man-made creature saying a
[47:06] man-made dogma this is God's Word and
[47:09] God said get in there
[47:11] he not into a church not into a person
[47:14] get into Jesus Christ
[47:16] [Applause]
[47:22] God wants men he'll come into Christ
[47:26] we're not interested in getting you to
[47:28] come into a church but if you come into
[47:32] Christ you're coming to church but
[47:34] that's not the goal that's not what
[47:36] we're interested in there's been a lot
[47:37] of people that set on church pews for
[47:39] years and where they at today we need
[47:42] people to come into Christ not into the
[47:45] message as far as the creed or a Dogma
[47:48] or some some idealism we told my people
[47:50] get into Christ you know he understand
[47:53] what I'm saying
[47:54] amen now I believe the message is Christ
[47:56] amen but come into him find him amen if
[48:02] you'll find him you won't have to worry
[48:04] about all the codes of this that and the
[48:06] other
[48:06] amen it'll just naturally happen on the
[48:08] inside of you because there's a
[48:10] different control tower a man but he
[48:18] wants somebody to believe he's the same
[48:20] yesterday today and forever not our own
[48:24] thinking and that's what a lot of people
[48:27] get hung up right there because you know
[48:29] they want their own thinking well I I
[48:31] just can't believe that one of maybe you
[48:33] can't but does that keep me from
[48:36] believing it oh there's a lot of people
[48:39] they couldn't believe anything but one
[48:42] day they couldn't believe he was gone
[48:44] either people who said I can't believe
[48:49] that message one day you're gonna can't
[48:51] believe we're gone hey man not your own
[48:58] thinking but moving out into space
[49:00] controlled not by man's Creed's or men's
[49:03] dogmas or man's ideas or your own ideas
[49:06] but controlled by the Holy Ghost oh ma
[49:11] Amen you know I think we're ought to be
[49:13] a people that gets past our closets
[49:15] controlling us and our ideas controlling
[49:20] us and what we feels right controlling
[49:22] us and how we feels comfortable
[49:23] controlling us and say God you control
[49:26] me I'm in your ship
[49:31] hey man astronauts how far it is away
[49:36] from the old horse and buggies and even
[49:39] the airplanes how far it is
[49:40] even from justification and
[49:42] sanctification and even the Baptist of
[49:44] the Holy Ghost the rent restoration of
[49:46] the gifts amen we're coming to eagles
[49:48] first maybe chickens lizards crows
[49:51] whatever but now there are Eagles no one
[49:53] can follow their astronauts for Jesus
[49:57] hallelujah amen we got people to be
[50:00] astronauts for the United States or
[50:02] astronauts for Russia how about some
[50:03] astronauts for Jesus let's say Lord let
[50:07] me get my eyes of what's going on on
[50:09] this world and the things around me and
[50:11] the problems and situations I can't
[50:13] control anyhow and get my eyes on Jesus
[50:16] Christ see even the natural one he a
[50:21] natural astronaut he don't leave by his
[50:23] own power he's fired out of there
[50:25] there's another force that's pushing him
[50:28] it's pushing him beyond all that he said
[50:31] that's all you have to do get into Jesus
[50:33] and God will do the shooting gonna do it
[50:39] it ain't gas line power no more it ain't
[50:42] some church cream it's God's atomic
[50:44] power that'll push you all the way out
[50:47] into space out under what is astronauts
[50:50] beyond justification sanctification amen
[50:53] going all the way the whole Bible
[51:03] hallelujah a real astronaut gets into
[51:05] all the promises of God he's not
[51:07] interested in saying what I want this
[51:09] one or not there's a no he's got to have
[51:11] all of them he knows that God is able to
[51:13] perform every promise he ever made
[51:18] hallelujah I mean if a man's got enough
[51:20] faith to believe this rocket it's gonna
[51:22] get on top he won't get on set on top of
[51:24] this rocket and he's gonna lift him up
[51:26] high enough to get out of the atmosphere
[51:27] of the earth into another atmosphere
[51:29] amen into where things are the once
[51:32] thought impossible or now possible once
[51:35] thought never would happen is now
[51:37] happening there was a time that it was
[51:40] thought that you would never leave
[51:42] atmosphere of this earth there was a
[51:44] time people actually science would even
[51:46] say that if a man went a certain miles
[51:48] an hour he'd explode didn't think it was
[51:51] possible to go that fast and now we're
[51:53] getting cars that goes beyond what they
[51:55] thought was possible
[51:56] come on that they meant an astronaut out
[52:00] there right now are doing things that
[52:01] once was thought impossible but that way
[52:05] it wasn't never impossible it was always
[52:07] possible
[52:09] come on I'll admit we are now receiving
[52:13] things in this word and things in this
[52:15] hour that once was thought impossible
[52:17] but it never was impossible it was
[52:20] always possible it just took somebody to
[52:22] believe it was possible it took somebody
[52:25] to say hey if this can happen for them
[52:27] and this can happen there and this can
[52:29] go here it's possible I believe it's
[52:33] possible pressure there's all kind of
[52:42] pressures that comes against us there's
[52:45] going to be more and more pressures and
[52:48] then cope in 19 is very small compared
[52:50] to what's coming upon this earth
[52:53] pressures and things that are pushing on
[52:56] every side amen but this but when I
[52:59] astronaut is in that tube he's
[53:03] controlled a man by radar or something
[53:07] that guides him to his destination a man
[53:10] that's a big radar you know that and
[53:12] pushes him to certain directions in
[53:14] certain places and brings him to a
[53:16] certain door of trajectory to reach a
[53:19] certain places it takes a precise moment
[53:22] for them to take off they can't just
[53:24] take off anytime they want to or decide
[53:26] when to push the button there's things
[53:28] they got to do they got to push it at a
[53:30] certain time so they reach a certain
[53:32] window so they reach a certain place to
[53:34] get to a certain thing it's all precise
[53:38] it's all in measured it's all exactly
[53:41] exactly to the T to try to get them to
[53:44] match up to this place and God has been
[53:47] doing this for seven thousand
[53:49] for 6,000 years he's been doing it for
[53:52] years and years and seven church ages
[53:55] all the way what's he doing adjusted and
[53:57] moving it wasn't man's power it was
[53:59] God's power
[54:01] it wasn't Martin Luther on his own
[54:03] decided to do what he does no it was the
[54:05] anointing of the Holy Ghost it was a
[54:07] radar that went off and said hey the
[54:09] just shall live by faith and I moved him
[54:11] over in a certain direction and I just
[54:18] wanted I you know Martin Luther you know
[54:20] I got a friend that I actually met over
[54:22] there in Switzerland just that randomly
[54:25] at a site it was it was a big wall in
[54:28] the wall of the Reformers and they took
[54:30] me there to look at it and it was this
[54:32] man from Singapore and I walked up to
[54:35] him beginning to talk to him but the
[54:36] David mayor was at work at the time so
[54:39] it was me and my wife and sister Ann and
[54:41] I went up to begin to speak to this man
[54:43] begin the witness to him begin to talk
[54:45] to him because I could tell he was
[54:46] interested in biblical things because he
[54:48] was there taking selfies with Martin
[54:50] Luther and all those ones and I'm
[54:51] beginning to talk to him about it and
[54:52] have been conversing with him even yet
[54:54] still a man and you know he takes me
[54:57] takes a picture of where Martin Luther
[54:58] nailed the theses on the door all the
[55:02] time he sent it to me God tries to go
[55:04] there at the anniversary of every year
[55:05] because he just he just really looks to
[55:08] martin luther in' and i've just been
[55:10] speaking to him about him in the
[55:11] reformation but now we're in the age of
[55:13] restoration
[55:15] hey man and and yes martin luther played
[55:18] a very important part but he went to
[55:19] john wesley all the way down to where we
[55:22] are today
[55:24] hey man but Martin Luther had to take a
[55:26] stand and he he protested it's what he
[55:32] did he protests that though the Roman
[55:34] Catholic Church in annually they want to
[55:38] come today and think there's the first
[55:39] protesters listen protests have been
[55:41] going on a long time ago a man because
[55:43] listen I believe we ought to protest we
[55:47] ought to protest against the aim and the
[55:49] formal ungodliness it tries to come in
[55:52] our churches and the easy believers and
[55:54] we ought to be protesting that
[55:56] well to be protesting that Amen the
[55:58] people to say days of miracles are
[56:00] passed know we didn't nail something on
[56:01] the door the days of miracles is here
[56:05] Amen we need we do need to protest
[56:07] against certain thing the darkness is
[56:09] trying to come in and take our children
[56:11] at you who your moms and dads want to be
[56:13] standing protesting against their amens
[56:17] the pressure that's trying to come in
[56:19] and take this all right now we ought to
[56:21] stand up against that and say look these
[56:24] are the days God has visited this
[56:27] generation and he's anointed some people
[56:30] not to stay here on earth not to build
[56:33] their own Kingdom in the old houses and
[56:35] old lands but it's by no native people
[56:37] to lift off from here and they go into
[56:40] another dimension we have people that
[56:45] gets caught up in all the things and
[56:49] they're getting drugged down by it but
[56:52] this astronaut once he gets into that
[56:56] chamber there's another power there
[57:00] that's taken over he's no longer his
[57:03] power John Glenn could not get himself
[57:04] into that place neither can you get
[57:07] yourself in into a body change there's
[57:09] another power Amen you know it was a he
[57:13] said brother Brennan sent like this he
[57:15] said he has a radar that guides him just
[57:18] like he guided Martin Luther just like
[57:20] the radar pushed down Wesley over to
[57:22] sanctification and radar push the
[57:24] Pentecostals to the places of the recent
[57:26] restoration of the gift
[57:27] there's over there still that Holy Ghost
[57:28] says God in the church come on now we're
[57:32] not under the guidance of a man we're
[57:34] under the guidance of the Holy Ghost
[57:37] we're under the guidance of thus saith
[57:39] the Lord
[57:40] we're under the guidance that God has
[57:43] nay he has never left us neither will he
[57:45] ever leave us he's still leading and God
[57:47] is still the same pillar of fire that
[57:49] that walked the children of Israel to
[57:51] the desert and he didn't get lost he
[57:53] didn't get turned around he didn't get
[57:56] eaten get disillusioned he led him the
[57:58] way that he was to lead the children of
[58:00] Israel neither to
[58:01] will he get lost he's leading us and
[58:03] guiding this bringing us through all
[58:06] this nonsense of this world into another
[58:08] place and there's a radar that guides
[58:13] this uh the spiritual astronauts it's a
[58:17] word that holds us it's a word that
[58:20] grabs ahold and says ask the Father
[58:22] anything in my name and I'll do it
[58:25] and thresher starts going forth and that
[58:28] prayer starts guiding you hello I'd seen
[58:34] prayer at work this these last couple of
[58:36] weeks and then ain't the first time I've
[58:40] seen it at work I've seen it work all my
[58:42] life seen prayer changed things and just
[58:44] in that instant and this is what he says
[58:46] radar the radar of the church is the
[58:49] prayer and the Holy Spirit that backs it
[58:52] up just watch the way the churches pray
[58:59] and you'll see the way the missile will
[59:03] fly did you hear that watch the way the
[59:09] church is praying and you'll see the way
[59:12] the missile will fly you can tell by the
[59:14] way the astronauts of track are
[59:16] traveling by the way the churches pray
[59:22] how's your prayer life it might be the
[59:25] reason why your missiles going down
[59:29] amen prayer leading you for air amen not
[59:33] not just not just laying down sit father
[59:35] thank you for this day thank you for all
[59:36] you've done amen no that's not the
[59:39] prayer God is wanting fellowship God is
[59:43] wanting the people that are fellowship
[59:45] with him that'll talk to him that he can
[59:47] talk to them amen God still got a voice
[59:51] he can still speak he's just looking for
[59:53] somebody say God speak to me lead me
[59:57] guide me I'm not oh this is not by my
[59:59] power I'm not here by myself
[1:00:02] I didn't bring myself here I need you

[1:00:17] spirit upon the church give us what we
[1:00:19] have need up pour out your Holy Ghost
[1:00:21] take out every reasoning we believe the
[1:00:24] word is right we're going to stand right
[1:00:26] with it and he said when you begin to
[1:00:28] move into that place you'll see it begin
[1:00:31] to rise the astronaut to begin to move
[1:00:34] up going beyond what anybody says
[1:00:37] going beyond anyone anybody thinks and
[1:00:39] going into another atmosphere until an
[1:00:45] astronaut breaks the sound barrier he
[1:00:48] goes beyond the restrictions of this
[1:00:50] world he goes beyond what's going on
[1:00:52] around him amen right on through he's
[1:00:54] not it he don't even hear any of it he
[1:00:56] just moving on he's living in the
[1:00:58] presence of God his word what His Word
[1:01:01] says he's the high priest you see that
[1:01:03] great big radar sitting out there moving
[1:01:05] watch him in the meeting you can watch
[1:01:08] when the Holy Spirit comes in the form
[1:01:10] of the pillar of fire like he said he
[1:01:11] would a man's not gonna be sitting there
[1:01:13] trying to reason that was science a real
[1:01:15] believer why he's looking at a radar
[1:01:18] screen watch him he gets the point and
[1:01:20] it catches one there and that astronaut
[1:01:23] you got cancer you got so and so you're
[1:01:25] from such-and-such a place the Lord
[1:01:27] Jesus makes you well hallelujah off
[1:01:29] cells that astronaut he said all my what
[1:01:32] a church he said is being proved
[1:01:38] everywhere around us we're living in an
[1:01:41] astronaut age
[1:01:48] we're living in a place that at any
[1:01:52] moment we're gonna take one more step
[1:02:00] we're living room right now you know the
[1:02:02] little story it just touched my heart
[1:02:04] hearing it again I was a little girl
[1:02:06] that was out on the ranch she's out on
[1:02:09] the ranch and the rich young Sun came
[1:02:12] out from the east to find him a wife you
[1:02:14] know when all the sisters were there of
[1:02:15] that ranch ramrod was there his
[1:02:19] daughters was making themselves up
[1:02:20] getting ready and had a little cousin
[1:02:22] you know that was there tending the
[1:02:23] dishes and washing the clothes and
[1:02:26] making the beds and nobody ever thought
[1:02:28] anything about her nobody thought that
[1:02:30] surely if he came he's not coming for
[1:02:32] her she don't look good enough she don't
[1:02:34] have big enough place you don't have
[1:02:35] this you don't have that she looks so
[1:02:37] humble and they put on this big party in
[1:02:42] and out they go and they're just putting
[1:02:44] on the bling you know and trying to get
[1:02:45] his attention and everybody's vying for
[1:02:47] his attention but he's looking for
[1:02:49] certain character he's looking for a
[1:02:51] certain person he's looking for a
[1:02:52] certain kind of people and all of a
[1:02:55] sudden he goes out to get away from it
[1:02:56] all outside and down by the bunkhouse
[1:02:59] and he sees this little girl come out
[1:03:00] with a pail of dirty dishwater and she
[1:03:02] throws it over the fence and and he
[1:03:04] looks at her and he catches her hind
[1:03:06] he's like I wonder who that is he finds
[1:03:08] out about her and it begins to talk to
[1:03:10] her and begins to fellowship with her
[1:03:11] and he decides she's the one and he
[1:03:15] tells her look you're the one I come to
[1:03:17] marry you're going to be my bride and on
[1:03:19] this certain day I'll it's a certain
[1:03:21] time I'm coming back again amen and time
[1:03:26] went on and time went on it seemed like
[1:03:28] nothing was happening of course all them
[1:03:30] sisters made fun of her and made me in a
[1:03:32] made light of the situation but you know
[1:03:34] it came the time that there was only one
[1:03:36] year left it was only a few months left
[1:03:39] it was only a few days left
[1:03:42] there was only one day left there was
[1:03:44] only a few seconds left Oh hallelujah
[1:03:47] there was only a few moments left until
[1:03:50] she'd hear the sound of a buggy coming
[1:03:53] down the road to pick her up again and I
[1:03:57] could imagine that day was her last day
[1:03:59] of being there with all them people and
[1:04:02] them critics are making fun she came to
[1:04:04] her last day
[1:04:06] chiju she wind took that dirty dishwater
[1:04:09] and she thought it over the fence for
[1:04:11] the last time hallelujah she went and
[1:04:15] she win then went into the beds and she
[1:04:17] made the bed for the last time and she
[1:04:20] got up and she made breakfast for the
[1:04:22] last time and I'm thinking about a
[1:04:25] people it's been years he's been 40
[1:04:27] years and 50 years we've heard that
[1:04:29] coming of the Lord and the coming of the
[1:04:31] Lord and now we get into one of years or
[1:04:33] year may be months or days but then
[1:04:36] we're gonna come to the last day how am
[1:04:41] I gonna come right to the last time we
[1:04:43] ever deal with cancer that we ever deal
[1:04:45] with high blood pressure and we ever
[1:04:47] deal with any demon of depression or
[1:04:50] anxiety on our children we're coming to
[1:04:53] the last day and we're gonna throw it
[1:04:56] over the fence one last time and then
[1:04:58] all of a sudden we put in the clothes of
[1:05:01] the word old and we're gettin their self
[1:05:02] ready and we hear the sound hallelujah
[1:05:09] what do you think those astronauts are
[1:05:10] feeling all of a sudden they feel all of
[1:05:15] a sudden they know it's my time to lift
[1:05:18] off of here Oh hallelujah
[1:05:21] I hear the sound in the mulberry tree
[1:05:24] it's the sound of not staying it's not a
[1:05:28] sound of occupied it's not a sound of
[1:05:30] the things that's going on I hear the
[1:05:32] wind of the Holy Ghost moving in a heart
[1:05:35] believe in all things are possible
[1:05:37] believe in the days of miracles were
[1:05:39] here believe in healing is here
[1:05:41] deliverance for God come on Sal

[1:05:52] last day ten men to deal with anxieties
[1:05:55] and fears and depression this might be
[1:05:58] the last service

[1:06:05] Bible said is David there in the
[1:06:06] mulberry bush he heard a sound of a goin
[1:06:12] well hallelujah hallelujah glory to car
[1:06:16] the world is worried about the following
[1:06:18] Kaiser and the stock markets and this
[1:06:20] and the other and their kingdoms they
[1:06:22] built they're all crumbling around them
[1:06:24] and they worried about how am I gonna
[1:06:26] make it

[1:06:28] to keep this I'm a little I'm not
[1:06:30] worried about it I'm not staying here
[1:06:32] I'm leaving here and there's the people
[1:06:35] that hears the sound of the buggy coming
[1:06:38] down the road the Holy Ghost moving in
[1:06:40] the Church of God it's not moving with
[1:06:42] less power it's moving with greater

[1:07:32] but that's not gonna keep it from hell
[1:07:35] you said how did you know the Bible
[1:07:42] teaching you here oh I don't know if I
[1:07:48] can believe the Bible is written by man
[1:07:49] well you can believe every kind of
[1:07:51] nonsense written by man I get amazed by
[1:07:55] people so I can't believe the Bible was
[1:07:57] written by man but that gum down seeing
[1:07:59] in they've gone down their old worldly
[1:08:00] things that all the things they're doing
[1:08:02] and it's written by inspired by Devils
[1:08:10] I'll try believing something may be
[1:08:13] written on paper by men but inspired by
[1:08:16] God you say well I tell you what we
[1:08:23] gonna do
[1:08:23] ain't no into there sing no in this
[1:08:25] world you're gonna close your eyes and
[1:08:26] it's gonna be finished it's just gonna
[1:08:29] be over to big blackness you'll not know
[1:08:31] nothing it'll be done you believe that
[1:08:33] if you want to I happen to believe we're
[1:08:37] sent an eagle here in this age that told
[1:08:40] us what's over there and there's nothing
[1:08:43] indication behind this eagle to believe
[1:08:45] him it's like I told her how a theist
[1:08:50] one time young man used to believe this
[1:08:52] message talking to him just visiting and
[1:08:55] and and and just thinking on these
[1:08:58] things and I don't think I've told this
[1:09:01] before but you know he said what are you
[1:09:03] just gonna close your eyes and there's
[1:09:04] not gonna be nothing I said okay great I
[1:09:06] close my eyes and there's nothing
[1:09:08] whatever lost I've had a good life tell
[1:09:15] you what I had I had a wife that
[1:09:17] wouldn't run out on me had children that
[1:09:19] would obey and do the things right and
[1:09:21] amen be good to people and good citizens
[1:09:24] and have a love for people that's what I
[1:09:26] have I have a church that loves each
[1:09:28] other and and people that love each
[1:09:29] other and care for each other what do
[1:09:31] you guys
[1:09:34] as if illicit this flipped the script
[1:09:37] just a little bit what if we close our
[1:09:40] eyes and there is something to this
[1:09:42] afterlife there what do you have think
[1:09:52] about it what are you gonna have if Oh
[1:09:55] foggy Timothy knows what he's talking
[1:09:57] about if this whole fogey Bible knows
[1:10:00] what he's told what are you going to
[1:10:02] have and what have you missed and what
[1:10:10] are you going to miss but he has come in
[1:10:21] this hour
[1:10:22] he brought such a revelation and
[1:10:25] vindication in this hour to put
[1:10:27] stability in our hearts to make a stable
[1:10:31] in an instable hour a mental over to
[1:10:34] where we can have enough stability in
[1:10:35] our heart to believe in the miraculous
[1:10:38] to believe in things that were once
[1:10:40] thought impossible by man but we're
[1:10:43] always possible by God amen stab it
[1:10:46] listen it didn't just all of a sudden
[1:10:47] become possible by God it's always been
[1:10:50] possible but now there's people that
[1:10:53] believes it to be possible a stability
[1:10:55] are having a straight turning door he
[1:10:59] said what a man once catches a vision of
[1:11:01] an invisible God and knows he's always
[1:11:04] present hello I know the devil's got her
[1:11:09] minds on Quran coronaviruses always
[1:11:11] prison and rights are always present and
[1:11:15] evil is always present and that's all we
[1:11:17] all were put in front of our faces if
[1:11:19] you look at those things out there it's
[1:11:21] constantly evil evil evil and it puts
[1:11:23] out the persona that everything evil is
[1:11:26] always present but if you can catch a
[1:11:30] vision of an invisible God and know he
[1:11:35] is always present oh he's always present
[1:11:42] amen he's there in every situation he's
[1:11:45] there in every problem he's there when
[1:11:48] you've lost loved ones he's down when
[1:11:50] you when you're down to your last minute
[1:11:52] or your last piece of money or your last
[1:11:54] food he's there he's always there and
[1:11:59] then that when you realize that
[1:12:00] something stabilizes a man's thinking
[1:12:05] and this is what we see people that's
[1:12:08] unstable because they've been feeding on
[1:12:10] the wrong things and they've become
[1:12:12] unstable because evil it's always
[1:12:14] present and this is always present and
[1:12:16] that's always present and it is in their
[1:12:18] thinking becomes unstable it in
[1:12:21] stabilized when you realize God is
[1:12:22] present right now just think that and I
[1:12:27] believe it do more than think it believe
[1:12:29] it God is present right now I told y'all
[1:12:38] the other day when I was sitting in my
[1:12:39] chair lift me and my boy I've been
[1:12:42] reading the Bible and things together
[1:12:44] and we got down to pray and I used that
[1:12:46] phrase whatever we biting spraying about
[1:12:48] my mom whatever we bind on earth will be
[1:12:50] bound in heaven whatever we loose on
[1:12:51] earth to be loosed in heaven and it just
[1:12:53] struck me go back and read that again
[1:12:55] and I went back and read it and realized
[1:12:57] it was directly tied to a question who
[1:13:01] do you say that I am if you can say he's
[1:13:07] present if you can say he's here not
[1:13:12] because my senses declares he's here but
[1:13:14] his words said he's here if you can
[1:13:17] believe that then all things are
[1:13:19] possible to you Peter
[1:13:23] hallelujah and that went when I were
[1:13:25] when I realized I have to I must believe
[1:13:28] he's present right now he's not just a
[1:13:31] God of of Elijah or a god of Moses and
[1:13:34] the good stories and good things to pull
[1:13:37] straight from yes but he's not just you
[1:13:39] know the devil sent way there back there
[1:13:41] but not here
[1:13:42] yeah and Peter's day but not here Paul's
[1:13:44] day but not here brother branham's David
[1:13:46] not here but when you realize the same
[1:13:48] God that was
[1:13:49] here it stabilizes your thinking it
[1:13:53] stabilizes your actions it stabilizes
[1:13:55] everything about you
[1:13:57] and it makes you look out port it turns
[1:14:00] your eyes on him instead of the problems
[1:14:03] it turns your eyes on the unseen instead
[1:14:05] of what you can see and what we can see
[1:14:09] your very dark and very bleak but if we
[1:14:11] can look to the unseen we could have a
[1:14:18] little glimpse tonight with Johnny he
[1:14:21] ain't fightin along sister Teresa not
[1:14:23] fighting alone we're not here by
[1:14:26] ourselves none of you are here by
[1:14:28] yourself he's here
[1:14:30] and when God arises his enemies are
[1:14:34] scattered when God comes on the scene
[1:14:37] brain bleeds have to push back cancer
[1:14:42] has to flee God's moving in impossible
[1:14:46] situations God doing the miraculous it
[1:14:50] stabilizes your thinking this is what's
[1:14:52] wrong with people they haven't caught a
[1:14:54] glimpse of the unseen because of them
[1:14:57] people out there doing what they're
[1:14:58] doing right now and the people of this
[1:15:00] world can catch a glimpse of what's
[1:15:02] anointing them Lord and mercy they can
[1:15:05] really see what is pushing them and
[1:15:07] their ideas and their thinking it was
[1:15:09] push the driving force behind them they
[1:15:11] can't see what's there they think that's
[1:15:14] my own thoughts it's not your own
[1:15:15] thoughts it's a spirit behind that it's
[1:15:20] a spirit moving in the realms of this
[1:15:22] world and political and this idea it's
[1:15:25] spirits but if the spirits of Hell being
[1:15:28] push people in the places where they are
[1:15:30] today and it pushed Sodom where they
[1:15:33] were and it pushed thought where he was
[1:15:35] but Abraham there was another spirit it
[1:15:38] was a stronger wind it was something
[1:15:40] else it was a visitation of that angel
[1:15:42] that stabilizes thinking instead of 50
[1:15:47] righteous Lord Savior if forty or
[1:15:50] righteous Savior 10 what was it was
[1:15:54] stabilizing his thinking
[1:15:59] in time of distress in troubles if you
[1:16:04] can catch a vision of the invisible God
[1:16:08] knowing he's always present it'll
[1:16:12] stabilize your thinking he goes on he
[1:16:19] says you see when you look with these
[1:16:21] eyes this is in now 58 so imagine we'll
[1:16:24] read today he said you look with your
[1:16:26] eyes and you see now nations are shaking
[1:16:29] and trembling war clouds are flying
[1:16:32] everywhere every nation is under
[1:16:34] distress perplexities of time every sign
[1:16:37] that jesus said would happen is
[1:16:39] happening there would be signs in the
[1:16:42] heavens above and the earth below and
[1:16:44] great things would be taking place
[1:16:45] flying saucers mystic things taking
[1:16:48] place but in those times he commanded
[1:16:52] his church to lift up their heads in the
[1:16:56] day to look up for the unseen Christ
[1:16:59] will be appearing very soon when you do
[1:17:04] it when you catch that glimpse it makes
[1:17:06] you think things you wouldn't ordinarily
[1:17:08] think it makes you a man wouldn't
[1:17:10] ordinary thing it makes you people do
[1:17:11] things that normal man when ordinary do
[1:17:14] it made Paul do things it wasn't
[1:17:15] ordinary Moses did things that he wasn't
[1:17:18] think in his own mind to do but he
[1:17:20] caught a glimpse of the unseen he caught
[1:17:23] a glimpse of something else around him
[1:17:25] more than what was there the desert the
[1:17:27] bush is this he caught a glimpse of the
[1:17:29] unseen the fire of God that could come
[1:17:32] down and it stabilized it's a stabilizer
[1:17:34] it's like a anchor in the ship it's a
[1:17:37] ship when the ship is tied to an anchor
[1:17:39] in the time of storm it holds it there
[1:17:41] in this place no matter how big the
[1:17:43] winds or how big the waves it holds it
[1:17:45] there and he said if Christ is your
[1:17:47] absolute and you're tied to him in the
[1:17:49] time of trouble the ship yep it'll rock
[1:17:52] it'll break if it gets to the rocks
[1:17:54] it'll break if it gets over there and
[1:17:56] the problems in this situation but you
[1:17:59] hung on to that anchor and let that
[1:18:01] anchor hang on to here it's your
[1:18:03] absolute in a born-again Christian is
[1:18:08] tied to Christ and the Bible as his
[1:18:11] anchor it's the thing
[1:18:12] tied to let organizations let different
[1:18:15] things science educators say what they
[1:18:17] want to but as long as that word says it
[1:18:20] I'm tied to it
[1:18:22] hallelujah and I'm not moving from it no
[1:18:25] matter what anybody else says and this
[1:18:31] is probably one of my favorite quotes in
[1:18:36] Christ as revealed in his own word in 65
[1:18:39] something that just brings peace and mom
[1:18:42] in my store
[1:18:43] he says the stabilisers have been put on
[1:18:47] the ship oh yeah great fearful waves are
[1:18:54] out there before us we know but just
[1:18:57] beyond that way that last wave we're
[1:19:00] nearing the shore just stay stable just
[1:19:04] stay in the word no matter how you feel
[1:19:07] stay in the word stay stable when you
[1:19:10] see those great big old clouds around us
[1:19:12] storms rising atomic bombs everything
[1:19:15] they're talking about but our stabilizer
[1:19:17] is right in the word God said it would
[1:19:21] be and we will crash every wave that
[1:19:28] shouting ground right there you need to
[1:19:31] look at that that wave has been coming
[1:19:33] against you as I'm about to crest you
[1:19:35] I'm about to come over the top of you
[1:19:38] because I've been stabilized in the Word
[1:19:40] of God and upon this rock this
[1:19:42] revelation and he is now present I'll
[1:19:45] build my church and the gates of Hell
[1:19:48] will not prevail against it oh it'll be
[1:19:51] against it it'll come it'll blow it'll
[1:19:53] hit a hack at the doors it'll push
[1:19:56] against the old well old rugged wood of
[1:19:58] the cross but them stabilizers are still
[1:20:00] holding hey man things are coming and
[1:20:03] we're rising above it all go right over
[1:20:06] the top of them
[1:20:07] it can't sink us Oh hallelujah the
[1:20:13] devil's been telling you he's gonna sink
[1:20:15] unit looking back and say you can't sink
[1:20:17] me cuz I'm not the one holding me
[1:20:23] to sink me you got to sink him to defeat
[1:20:27] me you got to defeat him and he done
[1:20:29] proved you are a defeated foe hallelujah
[1:20:34] they can't sink us they can Travis you
[1:20:37] can put us in the gara grave we're gonna
[1:20:39] come out again that's just all there is
[1:20:41] to it there ain't no way in the world to
[1:20:43] keep it from coming to pass or keep it
[1:20:46] down there
[1:20:46] we will crest every one of them because
[1:20:50] our great chief captain is calling on
[1:20:52] the other side we're anchored in Jesus
[1:20:55] the storms of life will break I'm a Kurd
[1:20:57] in Jesus I'll fear no wind away whatever
[1:21:00] it might be let it come whatever manner
[1:21:03] whatever the world doesn't make any
[1:21:05] difference we're anchored in Jesus
[1:21:07] Christ pressurized but it takes the
[1:21:16] inoculation of the Holy Ghost to keep
[1:21:19] saying in the insane hour you see people
[1:21:23] that's run this race for many years are
[1:21:25] cracking under the pressure they're
[1:21:27] cracking under the pressure of critics
[1:21:29] and turning away from this glorious
[1:21:31] truth they're cracking under the
[1:21:33] pressure of the world and the political
[1:21:34] spirits and they're turning away from
[1:21:36] this glorious truth and they think well
[1:21:40] I'm just turning away from my idea no
[1:21:42] you're turning away from Christ listen
[1:21:47] this pressure this cuts in this world is
[1:21:50] to only get greater and greater and
[1:21:52] greater until all hell comes into this
[1:21:55] place till the man himself comes and
[1:21:59] incarnates himself the man of sin comes
[1:22:03] in and coordinates himself in a man and
[1:22:06] you're talking about pressure I'm not
[1:22:10] gonna be here there's in a way there's a
[1:22:14] sound of a going that's taking place
[1:22:16] there's a people getting ready to leave
[1:22:18] here and let me just say it very plainly
[1:22:21] and very bluntly when this bride leaves
[1:22:23] here all hail is turning loose
[1:22:27] it will have its full sway and his full
[1:22:31] way but right now you got a way of
[1:22:34] escape somebody showed me a video
[1:22:40] earlier out sometime this week of a man
[1:22:42] ministering on Hale has no exit once you
[1:22:46] get there there's no leaving but what
[1:22:49] you can exit there is a way of escape
[1:22:53] there is a way called the way of
[1:22:56] righteousness but you can leave it you
[1:23:00] don't have to go down with that thing it
[1:23:03] exit get up and leave I'm not I'm not
[1:23:07] going there I'm not going down on defeat
[1:23:09] I I'm not I'm not bowing down to this
[1:23:11] thing listen but the pressure that's
[1:23:13] coming upon this earth this is only a
[1:23:15] foretaste and you can't run far enough
[1:23:19] in the woods because go get away from
[1:23:20] this pressure
[1:23:21] I know people got the ideas well I'm
[1:23:24] gonna get off the grid I'm gonna get out
[1:23:26] there by myself nobody knows where I'm
[1:23:28] at but Lonnie they got a GPS thing
[1:23:32] that'll come right on top of your house
[1:23:35] and they know what you are they know
[1:23:37] what you will be they know everything
[1:23:39] about you seems like and you think it's
[1:23:43] this bad now just wait freedoms are
[1:23:48] being rolled away one by one things are
[1:23:51] being moved into this place one by one
[1:23:53] it's setting itself up for the
[1:23:55] Tribulation Period and there is a
[1:23:57] tribulation coming but there's also a
[1:24:01] leaving an exit there's a way to get out
[1:24:07] of here
[1:24:11] this whole world's about to burn but
[1:24:13] there's a way to get out of here this
[1:24:17] world's going down into hell but there's
[1:24:19] a way to get out of here there's an exit
[1:24:23] there's a way of escape there is an
[1:24:24] inoculation you can't sink inwardly
[1:24:27] enough and become so inward and so so
[1:24:30] drawn into yourself to get away from
[1:24:32] this pressure it's going to have to take
[1:24:35] an inoculation it's going to have to be
[1:24:37] something that come up on the heart that
[1:24:39] a pressure
[1:24:40] you for a pressurized age then I
[1:24:43] pressurize you that the pressure on the
[1:24:45] inside is greater than the pressure on
[1:24:47] the outside therefore it keeps what's on
[1:24:50] the outside from coming on the inside
[1:24:53] hallelujah that's why I said the gates
[1:24:55] of Hell will not prevail up against it
[1:24:57] because Peter you're gonna go to the day
[1:24:59] of Pentecost and you're gonna read
[1:25:01] you're gonna read the Spirit of God is
[1:25:03] gonna be unleashed to pull my people and
[1:25:05] you're gonna come out of there like a
[1:25:06] drunk man but you're not gonna be the
[1:25:08] same no more you went in there liar you
[1:25:11] went in there deceiver you went in there
[1:25:12] cursor you went in there denier but
[1:25:15] you're going to come out and you're
[1:25:16] gonna stand for me why because I got an
[1:25:18] inoculation that I hope I got something
[1:25:21] to rise above ever hell that come to
[1:25:24] ever Dart they come from Hell every kind
[1:25:26] of spirit that comes against you I got
[1:25:28] something greater
[1:25:29] I got something more powerful I got
[1:25:33] something a hope in the time of death
[1:25:35] it'll hold so much you'll go down but
[1:25:37] it'll bring you back up again and ain't
[1:25:40] no hell can stop it they can put guards
[1:25:43] around they can put it I sold over they
[1:25:45] can do what it roll to with the word
[1:25:47] done been spoke the words Dunn's been
[1:25:50] spoke Amen I'll show you a mystery will
[1:25:53] not all sleep but we all shall be
[1:25:56] changed

[1:26:00] people in a moment in a twinkling of I
[1:26:03] one day their own the next step they're
[1:26:05] young again Oh hallelujah one day

[1:26:50] believe his words tonight it'll
[1:26:52] pressurize you God's got it I don't know
[1:26:58] how he's got it but he's got it when
[1:27:02] that happened to my mom a couple of
[1:27:03] weeks ago it struck my heart God's got
[1:27:06] this I don't know how he's got it but
[1:27:09] he's got it he saw this wave coming
[1:27:12] before we ever got here and he's got the
[1:27:15] answer and he answered but it'll keep
[1:27:23] you in the moment of temptation man
[1:27:26] vitals sure he tried to come to our
[1:27:27] minds I wouldn't visit her last Monday a

[1:27:57] to constantly pull those thoughts down
