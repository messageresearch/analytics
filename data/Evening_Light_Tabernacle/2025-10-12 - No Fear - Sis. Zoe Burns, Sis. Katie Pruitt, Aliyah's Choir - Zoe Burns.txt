========================================

[Music] [Music] I got enemies on every side. Ain't looking good. I ain't going to lie. Arrows flying, devils trying to make me think I'm going down this time. You might think that I'd be afraid. Running scared with a shaking faith, but the God I know says it ain't over. The God I know is going to make a way. Yay. Though I walk through the valley, I will have no fear. No fear, no fear. The mighty power of Jesus is fighting for the fear. The light of the world makes the darkness disappear. Out of my life, out of my life. Out of my life. Out of my life. Out of my life. I don't mind. No fear when I'm walking through the fire cuz I know you're walking right through. No fear when the blood rise by my eyes on you. No fear. No fear. No fear. The mighty power of Jesus is mighty for me here. No fear. No fear. No fear. The light of the world makes the darkness disappear. No fear. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my life. No fear. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my family. Not over my future. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my battle. Not over my struggles, not over my life. God's over my life. Not over my feelings, not over my future, not over my life. God's over my life. Not over my battle. Not over my struggles. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my feelings. Not over my future. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my battle. Not over my struggles. Not over my life. God my life. Though I walk through the valley, I will have no glory. The mighty power of Jesus is fighting for no. Light of the world makes the darkness disappear. No be my life. Not over my life. Not over my life. No my life. Not over my life. Not over my life. No. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my life. No. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my family. Not my future. Oh my. My Oh my god. [Music] [Applause] No, no. The light of the world makes the dark out of my life. My life. No, my life. My life. Out of my life. No. Out of my life. Not over my life. Not over my life. No. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my life.
