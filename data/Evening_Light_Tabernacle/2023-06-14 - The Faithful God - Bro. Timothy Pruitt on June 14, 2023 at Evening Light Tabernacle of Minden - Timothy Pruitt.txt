opportunity Lord ask you to just speak to our hearts touches by your grace and by your mercy we love you now with everything within us in Jesus name [Music] and turn your Bibles to Deuteronomy 7. verse 6. amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord hey man wanna welcome brother Joe and his family back with us hey man glad you're back home with us sure have missed you and and uh thankful the Lord was able to use you and to do great things for him no doubt and that's what it's all about but it's always good to be home amen amen let's turn the Bible on to Deuteronomy chapter 7 and verse 6. it says for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth could you imagine hearing these words amen when he spoke about you amen this is this is the natural Israel but it's also to spiritual Israel the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you're more number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which is sworn to your fathers hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt now therefore the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations amen God bless you be seated actually I was going to speak on something else tonight but this this thought the faithful God just was running through me as I was driving to church and you feel to bring this tonight if the faithful God faithful means Worthy it means steadfast it means sure it's wonderful to have a god like that in an unsure world means true it's wonderful to have a god like that in an untrue world it's truthful it's blameless irreproachable amen firm without wavering irrevocable and unmoving this is a God that we serve tonight amen he's not a a god who's one day as we said let me be less service one day he loves you the next day you don't or one day he thinks good about you the next day he hates you but no he's unwavering about his love towards you and he called you and loved you not because you was a great person or a great people or a of great number as he said we were of the fewest of all people but he loved you and he called you beyond all your faults and all your failures and all your mistakes and and all the things that you ever done in your life amen and he called you without with a mighty hand and every one of us could have be a witness of that Mighty hand that he would take us out of a life of sin and a life of ungodliness a life of uh unworthiness amen and bring us right out of that into the place that we are today and redeemed you out of the house of bond men from the ham of the Pharaoh king of Egypt and he said now know therefore the Lord thy God he is God and he is the faithful God you know there there's a belief that's called deism it's a belief where people think that God created the world and then he walked away from it all leaving us to fend for ourselves it's actually one of the first steps towards being an atheist is to believe this way because if you believe this way then in the end you doubt God's faithfulness and when you begin to doubt God's faithfulness and then you begin to blame everything that's happening upon this Earth upon God in this belief system you know people think of like a child who would spin a top and you know how you maybe you used to play with a little spin top and it would Spin Real firmly at first and then it would begin to spin out of control and it would crash against the wall and it would crash against this and it would Teeter and it was totter and ultimately fall and you as a one who put it into orbit you had a the ability to re-spin it or to bring it to his right place but you know just let it go however it wants to go and this is how people think God is they think God spun this all into being and and spun this all into place and now he's walked away and he's left it all and he just kind of forgot all about it and many times we can bring it on down to individual lives we think that a lot of times about God ourselves because we find ourselves in the Calamity or we find ourselves in a in a hard situation and and we want to think that God has left us or God has walked away from us but he has ultimately and intimately concerned about this Earth's well-being and not only is he concerned about the Earth's well-being but he is also concerned about our well-being amen God is faithful God is honest God Is is true you know you may have let people down in your life you know I've let people down in mine and no doubt but there remains one who has never let one person down he has never let you down in the struggles and the trials and the hardships you can see God is still faithful and not only is he faithful but he's sitting above our circumstances and he's working it even though he's working even no we cannot see him he's still working and God's faithfulness though is woven into his character that's who he is a faithful God Amen you know his faithfulness is actually independent of our faithfulness Hallelujah his faithfulness is independent of our devotion or lack thereof he is independent of our faithfulness or lack thereof he remains faithful even if we don't remain faithful Hallelujah he remains faithful to his promises his faithfulness will be fulfilled trustworthy he's trustworthy to his promises amen he's going to stand on him and he's going to Shield us and he's going to protect us and he's going to be there for for us even when every friend on Earth has walked away from us and so God's promises are trustworthy and they are true and I'm going to stack a lot of scriptures on this right quick amen faithfulness is who God is it's who his character is amen and therefore he he cannot move away from that amen it says here in Deuteronomy says know therefore that the Lord your God is God he is the faithful God Amen in another place in Psalms 81 it says who is like you Lord God Almighty you Lord Almighty and your faithfulness surrounds you your faithfulness surrounds you another place in numbers 23 it says God is not man Hallelujah God is not man that he should lie or son of man that he should change his mind hath he's what hath he said that he will not do or what has he spoken that he will not fulfill but God will bring his word to Bass what he said he will do what he speaks he will fulfill he's not man he's not going to say one thing and change his mind and do something else but God is going to fulfill his word that's why he put it in Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I I know that's one of our favorite scriptures as a Cornerstone of the message amen but in that scripture is the faithfulness of almighty God because if he was faithful yesterday he's faithful today and if he's faithful today he'll be faithful tomorrow amen God cannot change his mind if he thought about you yesterday and he loved you yesterday he'll love you today and he'll still love you tomorrow now man on the other hand will you and can and can and will change their mind they will one day love you and the next day hate you they will one day call you their best friend and the next day they have a a list of alts against you and how come you did this and that and their faithfulness is dependent upon how faithful you are but that's not God Amen you can walk away time and time and time again and God is faithful over his word and over the seed of God and God will bring that seed to life I don't care how many times you walk away I don't care how many times you try to turn and go down the wrong way God is faithful to his word and he will bring it to pass amen But You O Lord are God that is merciful and gracious slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness he's abounding in it a God in First Corinthians 1 9 said God who has called you into fellowship with his son Jesus Christ Our Lord is faithful amen so he didn't just call you to leave you he didn't just call you son and say make it all the best way you can he didn't just call you and say hey I brought you to this place I brought you out of Darkness but now you make it the best way you can no the one that's called you the one that started the work is the one that's going to finish the word amen he's either he was a faithful one to call you and he's the faithful one to bring you in amen amen the God who called you therefore he had he had to be made like his brothers in every respect so that he might become a merciful and high faithful high priest in the service of God to make perpetuation for the sins of people the Lord is trustworthy and all his promises and is faithful and all he does the Lord upholds all who falls and lifts all who are bowed down maybe I need to bring that one up Psalms 145 and verse 13. the Lord is trustworthy in other words he's somebody you can trust last week we heard about his mercy and his mercies are new every morning and I'm here to tell you that he is faithful no matter what day you wake up in he can be trusted I don't care how impossible the situation may seem I don't care how impossible it may look I don't care if the doctors have wrote you off God can still be trusted Hallelujah medicine may not be trick and be trusted doctors sometimes can't be trusted man can't be trusted but God will and can be trusted he's trustworthy in all his promises and faithful and all he does the Lord upholds all who Falls how many has ever failed how'd you get back up the Lord you didn't get out of that old dirty place on your own you didn't get up and push yourself out of there you couldn't do it God is faithful first second Timothy 2 13 says it like this if we are faithless he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself Hallelujah man these are some rejoicing kind of scriptures here because there's been a lot of times I didn't feel like I had faith it was a lot of times I didn't feel like I was a fat I was a man of faith in other words if you believe not yet he abided Faithfully even when you can't believe he's still faithful to his word even when you can't believe he can do it he's still faithful to his word even when you can't believe he's healed he's still faithful to his word even when you can't believe he can bring your children home he's still faithful [Music] he's still fat even when you can't believe your marriage can be put back together he's still faithful you know why he's faithful because he cannot deny himself you know why he can't turn you away because he cannot deny himself you know why he can't push you away as I give up on you because he cannot deny himself Hallelujah but he stands there faithful when we've lost all faith so Hebrews 10 then says it like this let us 10 23 let us hold fast the confession of our faith without wavering for he who promised is faithful so we can hold it you can hold your peace what are you talking about brother Timothy I'm talking about when you're in a storm you can hold your peace when you're going through trials you can be at peace when you're going through the hardest time in your life you can be at peace because God's faithful amen just because you're going through a storm does not mean that God has went off somewhere and left you alone defend for yourself no he's still right there he's still guiding he's still leading he's still got the boat on top the water amen it ain't you keeping the boat on top of the water it's him keeping it on top of the water and he's watching over you oh my what promises are you looking to be fulfilled I mean he's looking for Promises of healing to be fulfilled how many is looking for Promises of Deliverance to be fulfilled how many is looking for Promises of prodigals to be fulfilled how many is looking for Promises of of a body change to be fulfilled well let's read about it first Thessalonians 5 verse 24 says he who calls you is faithful he will surely do it even when I do it he'll do it even when I can't make it he'll make it even when I can't provide it he'll provide it oh that's for somebody right there even when you've done all you can to provide God is a provider and you can't go any further he will still provide because he's faithful he'll surely do it Psalms 119 says your faithfulness endures to all generations that means my children's in there Hallelujah you have established an earth and it stands fast Romans 3 verse 3 says what if some were unfaithful does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God not at all let God be true and every man a liar no matter how many promises God has made they are yes and so through him the amen is spoken to us for the glory of God so in other words they're not now I am about to go the way of the earth you know all the heart and the soul and not one of all the good Promises of the Lord your God gave you will fail every promise has been fulfilled not one has failed this is Joshua 23 and verse 14. I'm about to go the way of the earth you know with all your heart and the soul that all of God's promises the Lord your God gave you not one has failed but they have everyone been fulfilled not one where's our what's our testimony tonight well God failed here and God fell no no God's never failed you said well what about this one this one died and this one died your mama died well God didn't fail no no God didn't fail God kept his promises amen the Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise and some count slowness but it's patient towards you not wishing that any should perish but that all should reach repentance wow so maybe that's why we're still here in 2023. because the Lord is patient he's going to fulfill his promise but he don't want any to perish God's faithfulness is our protection so how's that well second Thessalonians 3 verse 3 says it like this but the Lord is faithful and he will establish you and guard you against the evil one um boo devil the Lord is faithful the one who has established you why are you here because God established me why are you standing in the place that you are because God did it why are you alive why are you allowed to stand when all hell seems against you because God allows it Garden us against that evil one Deuteronomy 31 6 says be strong and courageous do not be afraid or terrified because of them for the Lord your God goes with you he will never leave you nor forsake you um Hallelujah Psalms 91 says he'll cover you with his feathers and under his wings you'll find Refuge his faithfulness will be your shield and Rampart you will not fear the terror of night nor the air that flies die by day nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness nor the plague that destroys at midday first Peter 5 says after you suffered a little while the grace of all the God of all Grace has called you to his eternal glory will himself restore confirm strengthen and establish you his faithful promises are something you can stand on the Bible says that we know that all for that those those who love God all things work together for the good to them that are thee called according to his purpose how many are they called according to his purpose he said my God Will Supply every need of yours according to his riches and Glory another one let us then have this confidence draw near to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find Grace in the help of need the Lord God is a son and shield the Lord bestows favor and honor no good thing does he withhold from them who walk uprightly if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our sins so he's also faithful in forgiving us or something you can learn from you want an attribute of God get that one down pat faithful and forgiveness well so and so did me wrong how long has that been 20 years ago Let It Go people are so good about keeping lists kind of like that man you know in the Bible Jesus talked about who was forgiven I never forgotten now is uh I preached a sermon on it one time heart trouble over 17 dollars man went to the king order of his insurmountable of dead he could not and he couldn't even sell all of his kids and his wife and his land it still wouldn't pay at all and it goes to him and he finds Mercy and the King just writes it off and he walks right out the door and he finds somebody who owned owed him about 17 bucks and he throwed his hands around his neck and throwed him into the prison and the King heard about it how quickly we are to hold things against people and hold things against her husband hold things against our wife I don't know why I'm here but I'm just talking about the faithfulness of God and we're supposed to be the children of God well we're also supposed to be faithful in forgiveness because he is faithful to forgive the king's going to hear about it all the stuff that he's forgiven us Mercy Jesus he said my grace is sufficient for you for my Powers made perfect in weakness therefore I will boast all the more gladly in my weakness of the power of God May rest upon me he said Matthew 28 I am with you always to the end of the world Isaiah would put it like this he would say oh Lord you are my God I will exalt thee I will praise your name for you have done wonderful things plans you have formed of old that are faithful and sure these plans that you know these wonderful things you're doing Lord are plans that you had before the foundation of the world and they're faithful and sure as we read last Wednesday Jeremiah said it like this the unfailing Love Never Ends the unfailing love of the Lord never ends his mercies by his mercies we have been kept from complete destruction great is thy faithfulness great is thy faithfulness Moses would write it like this as the Lord passed before him the Lord proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abounding in goodness and Truth faithful God when he passed in front of Moses he said I'm the Lord God I'm merciful and very patient with my people that's another good attribute to have patient with my people I show great love and I can be trusted sure Hallelujah know therefore the Lord your God is God he is the faithful God who maintains Covenant loyalty with those who love him and keep his commandment to a thousand Generations Moses would say it like this to the children of Israel when they were Unfaithful he said is this the way to repay the Lord you foolish and senseless people isn't he your father who created you has he not made you and established you and he has been faithful the Lord is faithful his ways are passed finding out brother Tim's been preaching on Sarah found that he was faithful she actually judged him Faithfully you see by faith Sarah herself also received strength to concede seed conceived seed and she bore a child when she was past the age because she judged him faithful who had made the promise so it was her attitude toward the promise that brought it to pass even when I don't see him working he's still working you say well brother Timothy I can read over in the Old Testament where where Sarah did laughed unless Sarah did this and Abraham did this well that was under the blood of bulls and goats but under the New Covenant the faithful God said I don't want a loud to be shed every to every day or every month or once a year for my people's sin I'm going to come down the faithful God and I'm going to become flesh and I'm going to take on their sins once and for all and this lamb the faithful one who knew no sin he came and became sin for us and in the breaking of that blood no more of Abraham's sin is ever mentioned no more and if Sarah's doubting ever mentioned but she judged him faithful II Samuel said oh Lord God you are God and your words are true and you have promised this goodness to your servant that is so awesome Sunday to hear we're a friend of God and let me tell you something God is a real friend God ain't going to come up with all your negative side and everything negative against you because listen if he wanted to he could every one of us has a lot of negative I have a hard time being around people that's all they want to deal with is dwell in as the negative there's negative everywhere and every seat that's filled there's negative there Everest Place in this whole building where there's a human being there is negativity there but you have a choice listen you can find out all the negative stuff about your husband or about your wife or about your family about this or that and this but we have a choice God's a real friend he's a friend that won't walk out on you he's a friend that won't talk about you behind your back amen he's a friend that wants first thing you say something you go gospel to everybody else no no he's not that kind of friend he's a true friend he's a real friend and I'm thankful for that friend he's faithful to forgive he's a faithful high priest he will not abandon his people friends may walk out on other friends but this friend ain't gonna walk out on his friend he will not abandon his people he will not let them they get in a trial they get in sickness and they get in situations getting a pinch and he walks away and says try to figure it out on your own that's not the God that I serve this is going to stay there he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you he showed it Omaha I don't know how many times in the Old Testament through the New Testament you can find God's faithfulness where he never walked out on his people God's people may have walked out on him but he never walked out on them amen he would be right there with them when they was in Egypt he was there when they was at the Red Sea he was there in bitter Waters he was there with no food no water he was there when they crossed the Jordan River it was there when they went to take the promised land he was there with shamgar he was there with Gideon he would get in and walked out on him but God hadn't walked out on Gideon and when God looked at him he didn't call him what he was he called him what he was in God's mind [Applause] he said Gideon thy Mighty Man of Valor that's a true friend right there he'll look at you being a coward and call you a man of Courage Deuteronomy 4 31 says for the Lord your God is merciful he will not abandon you or destroy you or forget the Covenant he'd made with your ancestors oh my God Joshua would read it say it like this we'll use a different translation Joshua 21 verse 43-45 said the lord gave Israel all the land he had swore to give their fathers and they took possession of it and settled there and the lord gave them rest on every side according to all that sworn to their fathers none nine of their enemies were able to stand against them for the Lord handed over every enemy to them none of the promises of the Lord had made to the house of Israel failed everything was fulfilled Hallelujah if that's the way it was with the physical Israel that's the way it's going to be with spiritual Israel when we get on to the other side we can say not one time did he fail me but he was with me every step of the way did I see him all the time no I didn't did I feel him all the time no I didn't did I know he was there all the time no I didn't but his word said he was and I stood upon his word and God fulfilled every promise because he is a faithful God has not brought us here to this moment for defeat come on now amen seemed like Cancer's coming on every side Demons of every kind are coming in and they're getting louder and louder and louder and proclaiming their nonsense and screaming and knocking on the doors inside them and doing all that kind of stuff we did not come here for defeat God did not bring the bride to this moment to say Hey you deal with cancer by yourself you deal with issues by yourself you deal with this over here by yourself you figure it out no he is still here because he's a faithful God and he will not leave his bride alone but he'll fight with her to the end he's faithful Hebrews 2 verse 16 says for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham he wanted to know what it was exactly what it was like to sit in bodies just like you sit in because he want to be faithful so only way he could be faithful is to know he had to know what it was like to have mind battles so he could be faithful deer in mind battles he had to know what it was like to face sickness so he could be faithful during sickness he had to know what it was like for when friends walk away or this one does this or that one or to even in his own Inner Circle Amen to deny him or is or to betray him he wanted to know what it was like so when you faced these things he could be faithful wherefore in all things you hear that in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be merciful can I have mercy well I know what that's like I know what it's like to go Woody through what he's going through she's going through so therefore he could give out mercy and be a faithful high priest and the things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted foreign myself a fit back there a while ago you know what this word secure means it means to run to run to when you hear a cry for help but to write to you when you're crying for help and you're saying God does anybody out there know what I'm going through he says I do I know exactly what you're going through I know exactly I'm coming oh maybe that's what he's wanting to scream out to somebody tonight don't give up I'm coming don't give up I'm coming I'm running with Mercy I'm running with my faithfulness because it's surrounding me they would have run to those who cry and give assistance it means to uphold to help to assist to take part with that's a real friend listen you don't really want to take advice for somebody from somebody when you're going through something take advice for somebody who's never been through it because they can be blowing smoke for all you know they they might have some good advice they might I don't know but but chances are they've never been through it they don't know what it feels like they don't know what it's like to be in that moment they have no idea therefore having no feeling they can say whatever they want to but it's just empty words but when you have somebody that's been through what you've been through that's been where you are that's walked in the same place as you are walking that's been right there where you are I can say that I mean I don't mean this no no disrespect every word does help in this case but there's just something about some who's been through what you've been through when I lost my mom you know what really ministered to me was those who had also lost theirs because they knew what I was going through they knew what it was like sure I had great friends that offered me Comfort and never lost a mother or daddy or or a parent but you know they'd never been there and it was great comfort I'm not saying that but what I'm saying is those who had been there they had some deeper things to say to me because they had walked where I'm walking they had been through what I'm going through and this is why Jesus and his faithfulness would come down and become human because he wanted you to know I walked where you're walking I've been through where you're going through I've already conquered it I've already been there I Rose above it so you can also rise above it I have conquered it so you also can conquer I've overcome it so you also can overcome it let me give you some real words of encouragement I've been there I've overcome it you'll overcome it as above it and you're defeated cause I have been there he's taken part he's come to your side not as a bystander but for assistance he's come to throw together his help and his strength he's come to work to stand to place oneself right by their side to provide to take thought for that's the God we serve he's a faithful God he says in First Corinthians 10 and 13 He says there hath no temptation taken you but such is common to man how could he say that because not every man's been through everything but there's one man who's been through everything so now all Temptations is common to man hello but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that year Abel but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape so that when the acid trial come in so is the way of his case hallelujah oh come on he will also make a way to escape that ye may be able to Bear it Hallelujah brother Ben said like this Satan May pin you in a corner with cancer but God has already made a way of his cave Satan May pin you under a car but God has already made an escape Satan may have taken your family from you but God has already made a way which king God Will Make A Way he has a way because he's faithful God always makes a way of Escape every time sickness pinned you in the corner Satan pins you down to a place after you become a Christian did he become a Christian or how it is then maybe you've been a gambler cars that say the cards are on the table come on John you know it was you you know what's in you Satan's there to tempt you but God every time will make a way of Escape if you'll just accepted maybe he's a drunk or the glass is under your nose come on John now if you heed that voice you'll go right straight out in your Waller again but God is always there God is always there turn your mind towards heaven and look towards Calvary blessed Holy Spirit come to me I'm in need that's a call for help I'm in need and he said watch what takes place God will come and he'll make a wave Escape every time see but that's what the devil likes to work on you and depress you and that's a trick of the devil to oppress but when this Christian knows his legal rights when you can quote God's word I will never leave you or forsake thee that takes all the oppression away and the clouds begin to clear back and if you just know that God promised and God is faithful and he'll keep it every time because he promised it it was a and you say well what about for us older folks was for you too it's one thing I've always appreciated about our pastors he always has stood and very firmly on Divine Healing is not just for the Young is for everyone amen you don't listen I'm older you get the more Divine Healing you need anyhow so I mean but the devil wants to make you think well you just you just you're just getting old and you just got to die and go no you don't have to he said if you want to you can just go on that away but you don't have to go that way that's what the prophet of God said you don't have to go that way amen so we're not going that way it was old man Simeon in the Bible and Anna the prophetess and prophet in the Bible that was there in the time of the birth of Jesus and he was given a promise that he would not die until he saw the Christ and the Holy Ghost had promised him and he was going to see the Christ and Christ was now in the temple he said but now it was up to the Holy Ghost to lead him to Christ if God's made a promise God is under obligation to lead you to it God is under obligation to lead you to his word if God promised Divine Healing God's under obligation to place Divine Healing here come on now did God make the promise of Divine Healing we can read the Bible where you ought to know this by heart it's there in the scripture Old and New Testament I feel sorry for those I want to call themselves Church of Christ but I call them the Church of the Antichrist because there ain't nothing about Christ in them they've wrote out God that heals wrote it off Struck it off you don't do that no I don't care how many times you can prove they've done it or that he's done it it doesn't matter to them but it's in the Bible come on now it's in the Bible so we're going to hold it up as a banner and we're going to wave it right in the devil's face right now Cancer's screaming as hard as he can but I'm screaming back at him my God heals my God delivers my God Saves there's nothing too hard for my God listen yeah the World's Screaming out there leftism and their their ungodliness Sodom and Gomorrah nonsense and they don't mind they're loud about it and on the flip side the devil wants Christians to be quiet you're supposed to just be quiet sane and sensible and sit there and just nod and say Amen no we got something to stand for give me libertarian give me death hey man we got something to declare we got something to weigh before the world Our God heals our gods are faithful God our God's the same yesterday today and forever he said well what about this when she died this one I does not matter our God is still to deliver he's still the Healer he's still the Savior he's still the satisfying portion he's still God [Applause] he's the same yesterday to him forever he is under obligation to place upon somebody to represent him if he promised it he said the things that I do shall you do also he is under obligation to that word hello it ain't me trying to bring that to pass he's under obligation to it if he when he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe he is under obligation to make those signs follow direct quote how far to all the world to the end of the world he's under obligation to do it no matter how much they try to stop it no matter how much they try to put it down there is no way of stopping it God said so you can stop this world easier and you can stop there it'll move on just the same Communists or unbelievers this that and the other they might as well keep still because God is going to move on anyhow hallelujah amen I don't care how many rise up in this message and say there's no such a thing as a as a baptism of the Holy Ghost sir or Miracles or past or signs of Wonders don't follow God's going to move anyhow God's gonna do it anyhow because it's his word believe it or not it's his word walk away from it if you want to it's his word and he's faithful to it and he will fulfill it Simeon sitting there way off in a prayer room maybe and the Holy Ghost says stand up Simeon and Simeon stands to his feet and here he comes walking out of the temple not knowing where he's going but led right by the Holy Ghost down to the line until he finds and he stops in front of this little woman with that baby and he reaches over and tears begin to run down his white beard and he takes that baby in his arms bless God and said let thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for my eyes have seen your salvation the Holy Ghost promised him that and the Holy Ghost is under obligation to do that and yet he didn't know nothing about it but God led him to Christ when he was in the temple he said how many of you believe in Divine Healing well then if David said the Deep calls to the Deep there's got to be a deep to respond amen how many would like to have more of God tonight well because you want more of God that's a good sign there's more of God for you and he's faithful to bring it to pass reason Simeon believed that Christ would come the holy spirit said so and the Holy Spirit no matter how strange it seems to people how crazy he seems to be yet he believed it because there was something in him that told him so maybe nobody else knew it maybe nobody else heard it but it was revealed to Simeon and that was enough the same Holy Ghost said let Simeon up to the Christ because he had promised it he said if you read it in the Bible you believe in the same Holy Ghost LED you here tonight and I'm sure the devil wouldn't do it I'm sure the devil wouldn't lead you to your moment of Deliverance I I'm sure the devil would lead you to your moment of seeing the Christ but the Holy Spirit Will amen the holy spirit will also strike a man in his car on the way to church and say hey you don't need to preach that you need to preach about my faithfulness because there's somebody that's about to give up and about to walk away and they need to hear one more time I'm still faithful the Holy Ghost has led you here tonight for your deliverance been a negative person all your life the holy spirit is here to lead you here for your deliverance all you see is clouds and Gloom and work and what worry and fear and unbelief the Holy Spirit has led you here for your deliverance I I got to saith the Lord on this the Holy Spirit has led you here for your deliverance you said well brother Timothy I was adopted I was this I was that listen you know I I understand kids that get adopted they get all tore up and they get worried and thinking you know their parents didn't love them so they gave them up and and they did maybe also but one thing you gain overall override is God's grace and God's mercy he goes beyond what parents could ever do or everything and their best intentions are their worst intention and it'll bring you right to a place that you can receive something from God and God can come and move upon your behalf if you will see this is the Christ hallelujah amen listen you want to look Beyond I was adopted and said hey that was the grace of God because he put me in a family that I could be at the place I am right now the Holy Ghost has led you to the place is I'm showing it to you the resurrection of Jesus Christ the power of God that's here tonight flowing freely to every man whosoever will let him come take of The Fountains of Water of Life freely no strange job no nationalities no decree whether you're poor whether you're rich whether you're litter whether you're educated whether you're black yellow brown white no matter who you are whosoever will let him come the same only ghost that tells you there is a healing that's brought you here tonight look at the Holy Ghost let Simeon said stand up and tonight you was just in a hurry you eat supper real quick he said hurry up let's just get on to the church real quick wife maybe the Lord will move on us tonight maybe we'll just see the Lord's power maybe we can believe maybe going to be sitting there we're going to be sitting there praying and when this brother is preaching and talking we may see it let's hurry I can just see them potato set them potatoes aside I'll eat them when I come home what was it the same Holy Ghost was moving Yonder it's moving now there's a man a woman sitting here now that may be sick or Afflicted it's going out of here Hill tonight [Applause] Hallelujah maybe it's not sick or healed here sick or Afflicted in something in this Physical Realm maybe it's in your spiritual Realm but whatever realm it is somebody is walking out of here Hill somebody's walking out of here delivered he said there's sick people are getting real right now they're sitting here right now it's going out to be tonight well no doubt dying people will go out of here to live life again praise God the same holy spirit that leads Simeon is now leading you here tonight don't be scared to drink walk right up to it freely with a lot of boldness he's faithful to forgive me he's a faithful God and he will forgive all my iniquities don't be afraid to drink he said what you need to do is drink till you get so drunk on the salvation of God you'll not listen to the critics no more you'll not listen to your feelings no more you'll not listen to your symptoms no more you'll look to Calvary and say God I just want to hear the Roars of Calvary that's all I want to hear she brings us down Revelations 1 5 and says from Jesus who is the faithful Witness 3 14 these things saith the amen the faithful and true Witness Revelations 19 11 I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he just judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire in his head were many crowns and he had a name written no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a Vester dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword and with it he should Smite the Nations and he should rule them with a root Rod of iron he treteth upon the wine press with the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God and he hath on his Vester and on his thigh named written King of Kings and Lord of lords good read in Isaiah 9 and verse 6 says the government shall be upon his shoulder what does that mean the answer is this the phrase the government upon his shoulder comes from a wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it on the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he Bears a responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power no other anything has any right or responsibility and that beloved is the king of Key of David God being Sovereign he foreknew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride and he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not cover her own he died for her he washed her in his blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him and accepts him he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is ahead of us church and Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy to call he his her for him that because he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight all right subarians foreign you know why you can see nothing but clouds and Gloom fear worry because you truly have not taken your Veil off and
