[34:04] as we
[34:06] take our hearts to him in prayer father
[34:09] lord we just come to you lord just
[34:12] asking once again that you would help us
[34:14] father

[34:17] us this evening
[34:18] lord that you administer to hearts and
[34:21] lives
[34:22] give us strength i pray father
[34:24] lord we just ask the lord that you
[34:25] anoint this word lord that it comes off
[34:28] of our lips it did not just
[34:30] be me or
[34:31] something i've thought of it'll be the
[34:33] very thoughts of god
[34:35] we just commit our hearts to you lord be
[34:38] with those who are traveling to the
[34:39] different meetings lord keep your hands
[34:41] on them we pray
[34:42] we commit this service to you in jesus
[34:45] name
[34:46] amen luke chapter 12.
[34:49] turn the bibles to luke chapter 12.
[34:55] amen
[34:56] i was glad when they said unto me
[34:58] let us go into the house of the lord
[35:01] amen it's a wonderful oasis to better
[35:03] come together in the mid-week and
[35:05] just kind of let off the pressure and
[35:07] start worshiping and praising the lord
[35:09] and letting his presence come around us
[35:12] and
[35:13] amen here you know facts may say one
[35:15] thing but we're thankful we have the
[35:16] truth
[35:17] and the truth is what sets us free
[35:20] amen
[35:22] amen luke chapter 12 and verse 27
[35:25] consider the lilies
[35:27] how they grow
[35:29] they toil not they spin not
[35:32] yet i say unto you that solomon
[35:35] in all his glory was not arrayed like
[35:38] one of these
[35:40] like one of these consider the lilies
[35:42] how they grow they toil not
[35:45] and they spin not amen we'll let you be
[35:48] seated
[35:54] like to speak to you this evening on the
[35:57] drawing power of the light
[36:00] drawing power of the light
[36:02] amen you know i also want to read in
[36:04] john chapter 6
[36:06] and verse 44 it says no man
[36:09] can come to me
[36:10] except the father which has sent me
[36:13] draw him and i will raise him up at the
[36:16] last day this word draw it means to pull
[36:19] upward by inward power
[36:22] is to lead or to impel he would also say
[36:25] in john chapter 12 and verse 32 and if i
[36:29] be lifted up from the earth i will draw
[36:32] all men unto me
[36:34] amen so i just want to look at this
[36:36] thought on the drawing power of the
[36:39] light it's amazing that jesus would use
[36:42] this thought on the lilies and he would
[36:44] say look at them consider them you know
[36:46] the lilies or or the plants and things
[36:49] they don't told they don't spin but yet
[36:52] solomon all of his glory
[36:54] was not arrayed like one of these
[36:57] amen so there had to be something that
[36:58] was causing them to grow there had to be
[37:01] something that was causing them to come
[37:03] out of the ground to amen to come out
[37:05] and to give
[37:07] uh to grow up to a place where their
[37:09] leaves could come out and the green
[37:10] would turn and and then it would turn
[37:12] into a beautiful flower and it would
[37:15] show the beauty that was what was on the
[37:17] inside and we know that we can look and
[37:19] around us and we could see the life that
[37:21] we live we can see in the in the sun and
[37:24] the phases of the sun that's why we have
[37:27] the winters and the falls and and the
[37:29] summers and the springs is because
[37:31] actually it's the sun that is the angle
[37:34] of the earth as it would turn it would
[37:36] move it changes the impact of the sun
[37:38] upon the earth
[37:40] and therefore in certain seasons you can
[37:42] have growing seasons in certain seasons
[37:44] you have dying seasons
[37:46] certain seasons you have real hot heat
[37:48] and and different or more warmth than
[37:50] others you have cold because it's the
[37:52] power of the sun or the effects of the
[37:55] sun and the sun can get seeds i've read
[37:58] read today that seeds can lay literally
[38:00] for 50 years 100 years many years and
[38:03] never come to life but once it gets in
[38:06] the right atmosphere or the right place
[38:08] and the right circumstances around it
[38:11] and the sun begins to pull upon it it
[38:13] begins to pull it out of the earth no
[38:15] matter how long it laid there dead no
[38:17] longer no matter how long it was there
[38:19] without life when that sun began to call
[38:21] for its life it came to life
[38:24] and man we can say that on our own lives
[38:26] many of us laid in darkness we laid in
[38:28] sin we laid in unbelief we laid in
[38:31] places of all kinds of things different
[38:33] walks of life different places but every
[38:35] one of us was in darkness was born in
[38:37] sin shaped an iniquity came in this
[38:39] world speaking lies so we were all born
[38:42] in darkness we were all born in a place
[38:44] a man seemingly dormant seemingly no
[38:46] life but the sun began to pull things
[38:49] out of us that we didn't even know was
[38:51] there and this is how it is you know
[38:53] with a pond lily you can look at a lily
[38:55] that comes out of a pond and out of the
[38:57] dirt now the muck and then the muddy
[38:59] waters all around it but all of a sudden
[39:02] something begins to draw it from the
[39:04] earth and where it's down below fair you
[39:07] can't even see it with your own eyes so
[39:08] far down it's so deep in there you
[39:11] thought there'd be nothing there that
[39:13] would have that kind of life or that
[39:14] kind of beauty but the sun begins to
[39:16] pull it out of that mud and the sun
[39:19] begins to pull it out of that muck and
[39:21] that mire and things that had cased
[39:24] around it for years and years and years
[39:26] and it begins to draw a life out of
[39:29] there amen out of that darkness and out
[39:31] of that place and it begins to bring it
[39:33] to the part amen and brother bran will
[39:35] say when it comes up through all of that
[39:37] and it gets into the presence of the sun
[39:40] then it's born and that little seed
[39:42] bursts into life and and it goes through
[39:44] all that process amen what makes it do
[39:47] that he said it's the sun itself it's
[39:50] what's drawing it from the mud it's the
[39:53] sun itself that's drawing it from the
[39:56] filthy waters and the muck and then it
[39:58] comes forth and it's so happy and so
[40:01] free and so beautiful he said i think
[40:03] that's a beautiful type of the christian
[40:05] life something is drawing you out of
[40:08] this world
[40:09] amen something is drawing you out of the
[40:12] place that you thought you belonged in
[40:14] you thought that's who you were you
[40:16] thought your life was set you thought
[40:18] that's what you would always be but
[40:20] something on the inside began to respond
[40:22] to something amen it wasn't you seeking
[40:25] god it was god seeking you it was a son
[40:28] seeking that life amen that was laying
[40:30] on the inside of you amen just like you
[40:32] know he said how beautiful it is and he
[40:34] said if you try to help it come up
[40:36] you'll kill it amen it has to move on
[40:39] its own it has to respond to the sun on
[40:42] its own amen he said just like a chicken
[40:44] when it's being born you ever notice one
[40:46] of those little fellows right on top of
[40:48] his little beak is this little hard spot
[40:50] amen as it begins to come into that egg
[40:52] and all the egg begins to rot away it
[40:54] realizes i have to get out of here i
[40:57] have to move out of this place into
[40:59] another dimension and all those old
[41:02] inner parts of that egg begins to rot
[41:04] but all of a sudden something on the
[41:06] inside of that little chicken begins to
[41:08] say i gotta get out of here i don't
[41:11] belong in here no more this is not where
[41:13] i
[41:14] this is not where i'm going to stay this
[41:16] might be a temporary place but this is
[41:18] not my home and it begins to peck and it
[41:21] begins to scrape against that old shell
[41:23] and it begins to try and then they call
[41:26] pimping its way out and it begins to
[41:27] peck against it how many has ever seen
[41:29] that you put in an incubator all of a
[41:31] sudden you see that egg all of a sudden
[41:33] that whole hard shell it just cracks
[41:35] open what's happening that little
[41:37] chicken on the inside of there saying i
[41:39] need out
[41:40] but there's something drawing it out of
[41:42] there amen it's not just on its own
[41:44] there's a atmosphere that's pulling it
[41:46] there's a there's a something on the
[41:48] outside that is greater than the force
[41:50] that's holding it on the inside amen and
[41:52] i'm thankful to god that when i came to
[41:55] him amen i knew i realized at one moment
[41:57] this is not who i am this is not who i
[42:00] belong this is not who i'm supposed to
[42:03] be amen i got to get out of here and
[42:06] let's take it another step further amen
[42:08] we're not here we're here in this world
[42:10] for a temporary time in a diff temporary
[42:12] place but i believe there's some
[42:14] believers that are pimping their way out
[42:16] of here amen this is not where i belong
[42:18] this is not who i am this world is not
[42:21] my home i'm only passing through here
[42:24] amen i'm looking for a way out of here
[42:26] amen what is it it is a call from
[42:28] another dimension it is a pull that is
[42:31] upon our lives it's not something that
[42:33] we're trying to conjure up on our own or
[42:35] try to do on our own we can't produce a
[42:37] body change on our own we can't produce
[42:40] something on our own but by faith in the
[42:42] word of god that said i'm going to have
[42:44] a bride without spot without wrinkle i'm
[42:46] going to have somebody that's going to
[42:47] be alive and remain and they will be
[42:50] changed and we begin to read that word
[42:52] and we begin to eat that word and we
[42:54] begin to become that word and we go to
[42:56] pepin to get peeping against that old
[42:58] dark world that we're in and we're
[43:00] saying this world is not my home there's
[43:02] another place i belong
[43:04] amen there's another place amen that i
[43:06] belong it's god's provided way you try
[43:09] to help him he'll kill him
[43:12] amen that's why preachers amen as we
[43:14] speak you know you have to come you have
[43:16] to die out we can't make you do nothing
[43:19] amen we can pray for you we can ask god
[43:21] to move on your life amen but you have
[43:23] to say i want out of the situation i'm
[43:26] in
[43:27] amen i want i want to leave where i'm at
[43:30] and go to where i'm being drawn to i
[43:33] want to be pulled into another place
[43:35] amen amen see you begin to pick the
[43:37] shell off of that person or that little
[43:39] that little chicken he'll die he's got
[43:41] the labor he's got the strain he's got
[43:44] to break forth that's the way of a
[43:46] christian's got to do it it ain't
[43:47] somebody just shaking your hands and
[43:49] taking you in you got to lay there till
[43:52] you die and rot and born into the
[43:54] kingdom of god it's god's provided way
[43:57] we don't go in by a book we don't go in
[44:00] by a shake of hands or a joint or a pump
[44:02] up or a pull down you simply have to get
[44:05] away from that old shell
[44:09] hallelujah you have to get away from
[44:11] that old thing and say i don't want to
[44:13] stay here
[44:17] amen you know
[44:18] god is pulling but you have to respond
[44:20] to the pull you got to respond to the
[44:22] call you got to respond to what he has
[44:25] he said there's no better way ever been
[44:26] found he said just like a little dew
[44:28] drop it falls to the earth and when it
[44:30] does it's born in the night amen born in
[44:33] the night born in the darkness but in
[44:35] the morning it's laying there cold and
[44:37] shivering on a little blade of grass and
[44:39] hanging on or maybe hanging on a
[44:41] clothesline but just as that sun begins
[44:43] to shine do you notice how happy that
[44:46] little dew drop gets it begins to
[44:48] glisten it begins to quiver what is it
[44:50] it knows that the sunlight is going to
[44:53] draw it back to where it was at the
[44:55] beginning
[44:58] hallelujah amen maybe that explains some
[45:01] things to some folks they wonder why we
[45:03] get happy in the presence of god they
[45:05] wonder why we act like we do in the
[45:06] presence of god i'm just a little dew
[45:08] drop and the sun is shining on me i
[45:11] can't help but glisten because i know
[45:13] it's pulling me back to where i was in
[45:16] the beginning because i wasn't a sinner
[45:19] in the beginning i wasn't lost in the
[45:21] beginning i wasn't without god in the
[45:23] beginning i was in his mind before the
[45:26] foundation of the world
[45:30] so as every man or woman that's born the
[45:32] spirit of god there's something about it
[45:35] when that light spreads over us
[45:39] hallelujah we get happy because we know
[45:42] we're going back to where we came from
[45:45] from the bosom of god it can sparkle
[45:47] with joy when the sun hits it of course
[45:49] knowing it's going back to where it came
[45:52] from
[45:55] how many knows you're going back to
[45:56] where you came from amen this world is
[45:59] not our home amen this atmosphere that
[46:02] we're in is not where we belong i mean
[46:04] the sin and all the things around us
[46:06] it's not who we are amen you know we
[46:08] know the old seeds amen before it become
[46:11] a new seed it's got it's got a rod amen
[46:13] has got to die we know that to be the
[46:15] truth it's the same thing with a new
[46:17] birth you never go back you go forward
[46:20] to where you're born again
[46:22] amen that's why i think today says
[46:24] there's not so many
[46:26] genuine new verses because the seed
[46:28] maybe will sympathize with the word or
[46:30] with the preacher but they don't want to
[46:32] rot away from that old system they're in
[46:36] that old idea that old thought amen they
[46:39] don't want to let it go well that thing
[46:41] that has held them they don't want to
[46:42] allow it to fall away and to rot out of
[46:45] their lives
[46:47] they want to act like you know well i've
[46:49] asked for forgiveness it's got to be
[46:50] like i was and there's no true
[46:52] repentance
[46:55] come on now amen many of people are
[46:57] sorry just because they got caught
[47:00] they're not truly sorry to repent as
[47:02] they're sorry because they got caught
[47:04] and so they got caught they want to say
[47:06] i'm sorry and go back to what they was
[47:08] amen in the beginning had a place they
[47:09] had or the position whether it be a a
[47:11] preacher or a husband or wife or
[47:13] whatever they want that same respect
[47:15] they want that same authority but that
[47:17] only comes by true repentance that only
[47:20] comes by dying out and being born again
[47:24] amen they don't want to come on it they
[47:26] want to stay in that old system and
[47:28] claim the new birth or the message of
[47:30] the age and they found it to luther or
[47:31] wesley or pentecost or other places they
[47:34] want to try to hold on to the old system
[47:36] and claim this or claim that but that
[47:38] old system must die it must rot in order
[47:41] to bring forth a new one but they want
[47:44] to cling to it
[47:45] amen they want to hold on to it you know
[47:47] but many people begin to think that well
[47:50] i've been seeking god but it wasn't
[47:52] really you seeking god it was god
[47:54] seeking you
[47:55] it was god pulling on you it was
[47:57] actually god pulling you to the place
[48:00] that you are today you're not sitting
[48:02] here on this pew because of you you're
[48:04] not sitting here on this pew because of
[48:06] some person somewhere you're sitting
[48:08] here because god has pulled you to this
[48:11] place you're not who you are because of
[48:13] you you're not who you are in your
[48:15] christian walk because of what you've
[48:17] done or how hard you work or what you
[48:19] you're there because god has called you
[48:22] to that place
[48:24] he's pulling you no man can come to me
[48:26] except the father draws me that draws
[48:28] him you said oh i sought god i went to
[48:31] seek in him no no god's been seeking you
[48:35] amen not you seeking god human nature
[48:38] proves that we don't have to go back but
[48:39] just to the beginning of the bible and
[48:41] see adam's sin he didn't start hunting
[48:44] god
[48:46] god where are you i need you god
[48:49] no god came looking for him
[48:52] adam where are you
[48:54] adam where are you
[48:56] adam where are you jesus said no man can
[48:59] come to me except the father draws him
[49:02] then god drawed you first
[49:06] hallelujah he drawed you first now
[49:09] listen to this i thought this was
[49:10] interesting he said how many here sinner
[49:12] or saint had said i know that god has
[49:14] spoke to me and he's trying to get me to
[49:17] come to his son christ jesus let me see
[49:19] your hand have you how many in here has
[49:21] ever felt the pull of god in other words
[49:26] listen this he said just raise your hand
[49:28] sinner is saint don't matter who you are
[49:30] he said you mean there's only one third
[49:32] of this people that's ever heard god
[49:34] speaking to you to become a christian
[49:37] only one-third he said i ought to change
[49:39] my text and preach the gospel and call
[49:42] for an altar call
[49:46] amen every person ought to have the
[49:48] right to hear one time god calling on
[49:51] their lives
[49:52] god pulling on them now there are those
[49:55] that hurt him many times but refuse to
[49:57] call
[49:58] amen they turned it down he said no one
[50:01] can come to me except god the father
[50:04] draws him jesus said then when he comes
[50:07] i will no wise cast him out
[50:11] hallelujah what a promise that is when
[50:14] you respond to his call he's not going
[50:16] to turn you down
[50:17] when you respond to him and say god i
[50:20] heard you and i'm coming to you as hard
[50:23] as i can come i'm laying aside my old
[50:25] garments i'm laying aside my pride i'm
[50:28] laying aside my unforgiving spirit i'm
[50:30] laying it all down i'm coming to you he
[50:33] said if you'll come like that i won't

[50:58] what is happening the words going forth
[51:01] and the holy spirit's following the word
[51:03] and he's wanting to see it come to pass
[51:05] in somebody's life
[51:07] amen and he's standing there and he's
[51:09] pulling and he's pulling how many
[51:10] remembers that skin and i believe it was
[51:12] brother aaron standing back there

[52:50] laying on the inside of you
[52:54] hallelujah amen he don't care where he
[52:56] has to go there's no place too bad that
[52:58] god can't get to a seed of god there's
[53:01] no darkness too dark that he can't go
[53:03] beyond and pierce through it and come to
[53:06] that seed and say hey i'm knocking at
[53:08] your heart

[53:21] god god's knocking at you
[53:25] amen
[53:26] amen adam never knocked at god's heart
[53:28] god was knocking at adam's heart
[53:32] that's right before adam could be a son
[53:33] of god god had to knock at his heart
[53:36] because you become a son
[53:38] before you can become a son of god god
[53:40] has got to knock at your heart many
[53:42] people say well i saw god i saw god i
[53:45] saw god that's error god sought you not
[53:48] you seeking god it wasn't adam running
[53:51] up and down the garden hauling father
[53:53] father where art thou it was god
[53:55] screaming adam
[53:57] adam where art thou
[54:00] hallelujah i'm so thankful he called my
[54:03] name
[54:06] hallelujah amen he reflected that what
[54:10] all man was adam did a runner a fighter
[54:12] instead of a man coming right out and
[54:14] confessing is wrong and being honest
[54:16] before god he tries to hide back behind
[54:19] some kind of fig leaf affair
[54:22] some man may think
[54:24] it's still in the nature of man to do it
[54:26] it's just in him trying to do it himself
[54:28] instead of just saying i'm wrong
[54:32] god
[54:33] help me i'm wrong
[54:36] instead of just taking god at his word
[54:38] he tries to bypass it
[54:42] he tries to live with that unforgiveness
[54:44] and still be a christian
[54:48] hello
[54:50] he still tries to do all those things
[54:52] and still have a form of godliness
[54:56] shall we read it
[54:58] was it second timothy 3
[55:00] perilous times shall come for men shall
[55:02] be lovers their own self covenants
[55:04] boasters proud blasphemers disobedience
[55:06] apparent unthankful unholy without
[55:08] natural affection truth breakers false
[55:10] accusers incontinent fierce despiser of
[55:12] those that are good traity traitors
[55:15] heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[55:17] more than love of god having a form of
[55:18] godliness
[55:21] he didn't say some he said all of these
[55:24] are doing that but they have a form of
[55:26] godliness they're all doing that but
[55:27] they're in church
[55:31] they're all doing that but they're still
[55:33] proclaiming a part of christianity
[55:35] they're all doing that but they're
[55:36] saying i'm going in the rapture
[55:42] they try to bypass it instead of just
[55:44] taking god at his word instead of just
[55:46] saying you know what i was wrong i don't
[55:48] need to hold this no more i'm going to
[55:50] let it go
[55:54] god help me
[55:56] ministers today many of them trying to
[55:57] weigh and find a way to bypass divine
[56:00] healing
[56:02] they're trying to find a way to bypass
[56:04] the baptism of the holy ghost there's no
[56:06] way to bypass it
[56:08] people will go on receiving it just to
[56:10] say
[56:12] hallelujah i love that that's the word
[56:14] of the prophet he said they're trying to
[56:16] bypass divine healing they're trying to
[56:18] bypass the baptism of the holy spirit
[56:20] period but there's no way to bypass it
[56:23] people will go on receiving it just the
[56:25] same
[56:27] because it's the promise of god and his
[56:30] word will be fulfilled
[56:37] jesus said we wouldn't argue with jesus
[56:39] would we
[56:40] say it again no man can come to me
[56:43] except my father draw him first
[56:45] then it was god knocking on your heart
[56:48] not you seeking god
[56:50] it was god seeking you
[56:53] amen see the covenant is to you also
[56:56] as it was with abraham listen it wasn't
[56:58] abraham looking for god it was god
[57:00] looking for abraham abraham probably
[57:03] would have been just satisfied living
[57:04] his life out in earth
[57:06] but god came looking for him
[57:09] god began to pull on him and said
[57:10] abraham i've got something better for
[57:12] you i'm not going to get into all that
[57:13] because we know what the pastor had been
[57:15] preaching on amen but see the light of
[57:17] god began to draw him out of the place
[57:20] that he was into the promised land amen
[57:22] it wasn't abraham looking for god it was
[57:25] god looking for abraham it was god
[57:28] pulling on him and saying come walk with
[57:30] me
[57:30] amen it wasn't rebecca that was looking
[57:33] for god that day it was the angel of
[57:35] light the angel of god that came down
[57:37] and brother branham would say beat
[57:38] eliezer to the well by about 30 minutes
[57:42] and it began to pull and begin to
[57:43] pulsate there at the well calling that
[57:46] heart
[57:49] amen rebecca i might have been happy
[57:50] knitting or cooking or whatever she was
[57:52] doing they were there doing whatever her
[57:54] normal duties of the day amen and
[57:57] working just as hard as she could work
[57:58] amen but all of a sudden something began
[58:01] to pull
[58:02] something began to pulsate on the inside
[58:04] of her go to the well go to the well go
[58:08] to the well i ain't getting time to go
[58:10] the way i don't i got other things to do
[58:11] go to the well go to the well i can't go
[58:14] right now i got this to do go to the
[58:15] well
[58:18] what was it there was an angel sitting
[58:19] over there at the well and saying come
[58:21] on rebecca i got a visitation for you
[58:24] you can't miss it
[58:26] you got to be at this place so i can
[58:29] reveal to you who you really are and
[58:31] what your purpose really is oh
[58:33] hallelujah amen you thought you was a
[58:36] druggie you thought you was a drunkard
[58:38] you thought you was somebody else down
[58:40] in the world and down in sins or maybe
[58:42] you thought you was a baptist or a
[58:44] methodist or a presbyterian or a
[58:46] catholic but all of a sudden the angel
[58:49] of god came to a well
[58:52] and it began to send a pulsation of
[58:54] light and it began to go down to the
[58:56] darkness where you was at and began to
[58:58] call and it began to call you it began
[59:00] to pull on you it began to draw you out
[59:03] of where you was to where you are now
[59:06] hallelujah and every devil in hell try
[59:09] to put his face in there in your path he
[59:11] tried to stand up and say no you can't
[59:13] go but that light was greater than he
[59:15] was and it kept pulling and it kept
[59:18] drawing and it kept pulling and it kept
[59:20] drawing
[59:22] it pulled you into justification it
[59:24] pulled you into sanctification and
[59:26] pulling you into the holy ghost
[59:29] and one of these days and that final
[59:31] pull is going to pull us out of these
[59:33] old mortal bodies into immortality
[59:37] [Applause]
[59:41] he reached down
[59:42] and chose you
[59:46] and you never chose him he chose you
[59:51] mercy
[59:52] out of the millions in the world today
[59:55] out of the billions in the world today
[59:57] he chose you
[1:00:02] because he put your name on the lamb's
[1:00:03] book of life before the foundation of
[1:00:05] the world that's what the bible said
[1:00:07] before was there was a world
[1:00:10] he chose you
[1:00:13] before there was sin
[1:00:15] he chose you
[1:00:16] before there was demons he chose you
[1:00:20] and he don't change his mind
[1:00:24] oh we ought to better rejoice on that
[1:00:26] one
[1:00:28] even when he wasn't sin he didn't change
[1:00:30] his mind even when you did run straight
[1:00:32] away from him he didn't change his mind
[1:00:34] even when he was clouded up with every
[1:00:36] darkness and every kind of doubt every
[1:00:38] kind of spirit of hell he didn't change
[1:00:40] his mind he just kept pulling
[1:00:43] he just kept drawing amen he just kept
[1:00:46] moving amen kept bringing her to the
[1:00:48] place where you're at amen you said well
[1:00:50] brother tell me i'm not worthy of this
[1:00:52] amen none of us are worthy of this
[1:00:54] it ain't about whether we was worthy or
[1:00:56] not it was he chose me
[1:00:59] amen it isn't about amen
[1:01:01] you say well i'm not worthy of healing
[1:01:03] it ain't about whether you're worthy of
[1:01:05] healing or not it's about is the lamb
[1:01:07] worthy of the giving of the healing is
[1:01:10] he able to provide it is he powerful
[1:01:12] enough is the blood and we know the
[1:01:14] answer to that yes he is
[1:01:16] amen so it's not about us being worthy
[1:01:18] that's the devil's thinking again he's
[1:01:20] trying to put the spirit of unworthiness
[1:01:22] upon our young people that they don't
[1:01:23] feel worthy enough amen to be born again
[1:01:26] they don't feel worthy enough to be in
[1:01:28] church they don't feel worthy enough
[1:01:29] amen to be in the family they was born
[1:01:31] in you wasn't born in the family you're
[1:01:33] born in amen because you was worthy
[1:01:35] enough you're not sitting on this pew
[1:01:37] because you're worthy enough you're
[1:01:39] sitting there because god chose you to
[1:01:41] be there and if god chose you to be
[1:01:43] there there ain't enough devils in hell
[1:01:45] that can keep you from your place
[1:01:52] amen because we got a lamb who is worthy
[1:01:55] hallelujah you know we can we know the
[1:01:58] story of the old covenant when the that
[1:01:59] little mule was born out in a pasture
[1:02:02] during the night during darkness
[1:02:04] so i don't know whether you're formed in
[1:02:05] the department or not but this mural was
[1:02:07] born with floppy ears horrible looking
[1:02:09] mule crawl sided knocked kneed and bow
[1:02:11] legged tail stuck straight up in the air
[1:02:13] what a horrible looking thing he can
[1:02:15] look around his man and say you know
[1:02:16] what as soon as this master comes out of
[1:02:18] the house he'll knock me in the head i'm
[1:02:20] not even worth eating i'm not even worth
[1:02:23] the food i can provide i'm no good but
[1:02:25] if this mammy was really instructed
[1:02:27] she'd say wait a minute son just a
[1:02:29] minute i'm going to tell you something
[1:02:30] you don't know that's what i want to
[1:02:32] tell you see you don't know who you are
[1:02:36] you don't who you are you were born
[1:02:39] under a birthright and when the master
[1:02:41] of the house i don't care what you look
[1:02:43] like but when the master of the house
[1:02:45] comes out you got to see he's got a new
[1:02:47] mule born then the thing he has to do is
[1:02:49] get a lamb without blemish and take that
[1:02:52] perfect lamb and he dies so you can live
[1:02:55] and when that little mule began to hear
[1:02:57] those words he could kick up his heels
[1:02:59] and have a big time amen it's not me
[1:03:01] that's worthy it's not me that looks
[1:03:03] good enough or acts good enough it's a
[1:03:06] lamb that's worthy and he's called me by
[1:03:08] name
[1:03:14] he said that's the way it is with us
[1:03:15] we're imperfect
[1:03:17] we have imperfections no good born in
[1:03:19] sins shaped in iniquity come in the
[1:03:21] world speaking lies we were no good to
[1:03:24] begin with
[1:03:27] but i want you to understand something
[1:03:31] god don't look at you
[1:03:33] he came looking for you
[1:03:41] hallelujah he don't look at you and
[1:03:43] inspect you and say well is he worthy
[1:03:46] enough to receive my grace
[1:03:48] let me see he wouldn't find anyone
[1:03:50] worthy enough
[1:03:53] they ain't a person in this building is
[1:03:54] worthy enough for what we've received
[1:03:57] as far as on our own human
[1:04:00] human genealogies or human abilities or
[1:04:03] human works and things we ain't none of
[1:04:05] us
[1:04:06] worthy of the grace that we have
[1:04:08] received but he didn't come looking at
[1:04:10] you he's already looked at something
[1:04:14] he looked at a lamb that was hung on a
[1:04:17] tree
[1:04:18] and he said that lamb was perfect
[1:04:20] and that blood came rolling down on that
[1:04:22] earth what was that blood doing it began
[1:04:24] to speak better things than the blood of
[1:04:26] abel
[1:04:28] the blood of abel began it was speaking
[1:04:30] murder and and hatred and jealousy
[1:04:32] that's what the blood of abel spoke but
[1:04:34] when the blood of jesus came down it
[1:04:36] began to speak out names that were
[1:04:38] redeemed before the foundation of the
[1:04:40] world
[1:04:42] hallelujah that blood began to call out
[1:04:44] your name
[1:04:48] and it's been going for two thousands of
[1:04:50] years through every church age calling
[1:04:53] out the names of the seeds that were
[1:04:55] down there in the darkness
[1:05:02] he came looking for you
[1:05:04] he looks at the sacrifice but he's
[1:05:07] looking for you
[1:05:09] he looks at the lamb but he's looking
[1:05:12] for you
[1:05:13] because when he sees you he don't see
[1:05:15] you he sees christ
[1:05:18] jesus died for you now if you can find
[1:05:20] some fault with jesus then your healing
[1:05:22] might not be right if you can find fault
[1:05:25] with him then things might not be
[1:05:27] perfect if you can find thought with him
[1:05:29] then maybe there's nobody worthy
[1:05:32] but he called you by his grace not that
[1:05:34] you would but it was god if god would
[1:05:39] and god would
[1:05:41] he has called you he has pulled you he
[1:05:44] has brought you to this place and if
[1:05:46] he's brought you here to this place
[1:05:48] don't think he's going to forget about
[1:05:50] you
[1:05:51] don't think he's going to draw you right
[1:05:52] here to the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:54] and the things of god and the promises
[1:05:56] of god that say that's it we're all done
[1:05:58] and we're all finished no he's still
[1:06:00] pulling
[1:06:02] he's still drawing amen he's still
[1:06:04] calling when god speaks it begins to
[1:06:06] pull the light begins to go forth it's
[1:06:09] good as finished right then
[1:06:15] so he goes on he says so how in the
[1:06:17] world
[1:06:18] are you going to stamp out the baptism
[1:06:21] of the holy ghost
[1:06:23] how in the world are you going to stamp
[1:06:26] out all the gifts
[1:06:28] how are you going to stamp out the
[1:06:29] church you can't do it god spoke it it's
[1:06:32] going to be it's settled certainly it'll
[1:06:35] materialize somewhere in someone
[1:06:43] then when god foresaw by his
[1:06:45] foreknowledge how he redeemed the world
[1:06:48] of sin and corruption he slayed christ
[1:06:50] before the foundation of the world when
[1:06:52] he spoke the word four thousand years
[1:06:54] before it was manifested
[1:06:56] so what are you scared about what are
[1:06:57] you afraid to take his word don't be
[1:06:59] afraid call the thing right
[1:07:02] i'm an heir
[1:07:07] why are you in there because i've been
[1:07:08] made in there through christ jesus
[1:07:11] not because i'm worthy enough but
[1:07:13] because he's worthy enough i am in here
[1:07:16] oh i don't you say i know i don't
[1:07:17] deserve it but i'm an heir i receive it
[1:07:20] there you are i am an heir of the holy
[1:07:22] spirit i am an heir of salvation i am an
[1:07:26] heir of the holy ghost i am an heir of
[1:07:28] healing and deliverance
[1:07:30] that is my
[1:07:32] portion
[1:07:34] given by the blood of jesus christ i'm
[1:07:37] an heir to old perfect assurance jesus
[1:07:39] of mine oh what a foretaste of glory
[1:07:40] divine an heir of salvation satan can't
[1:07:43] stand that but let me tell you he's a
[1:07:45] defeated being
[1:07:47] he's tried to stop it but he's nothing
[1:07:49] but a bluff jesus paid the price and he
[1:07:51] called us by his grace with an heir what
[1:07:53] a perfect set up that is he's already
[1:07:56] defeated i didn't have to defeat him
[1:07:58] christ defeated him i'm just claiming my
[1:08:00] own god-given privileges that's all i
[1:08:03] have to do
[1:08:11] brother brandon would talk about a
[1:08:13] little man
[1:08:15] says a little color man was being
[1:08:16] ordained one day and the elder stand
[1:08:18] around said lord
[1:08:19] wrap him up in burlup sacks
[1:08:21] pour carousing on him and set him a fire
[1:08:24] for the gospel
[1:08:25] he said that's what we need today
[1:08:27] is on fire
[1:08:30] turn him loose and let him run
[1:08:33] he said i used to brand calves we'd take
[1:08:35] a calf i know you've roped and hogtied
[1:08:37] many one i guess we used to brand them
[1:08:39] down someone said to me aren't you
[1:08:40] ashamed to pack that iron and stick it
[1:08:42] to his side as a note i stuck it on the
[1:08:44] side he had a kicking fit he squalled
[1:08:46] and battled he turned loose he had a
[1:08:48] spasm boy he could run but he always
[1:08:51] knew he who he belonged to from then on
[1:08:54] as long as he lived
[1:08:56] i tell you brother it takes a lot of
[1:08:58] grace to come up to the altar and stay
[1:09:00] there till the holy ghost burns a seal
[1:09:02] down in you you may scream he may cry
[1:09:05] you may act funny but you know who you
[1:09:07] belong to from then on for you're sealed
[1:09:10] into the kingdom of god by the holy
[1:09:12] spirit remember the holy spirit came to
[1:09:14] seal those who god foreknew
[1:09:17] who he called
[1:09:21] he didn't just come down jesus and say
[1:09:23] i'll die maybe somebody'll have pity and
[1:09:25] look on me and say well i suppose maybe
[1:09:27] if they think i've suffered so much
[1:09:28] it'll break their hearts and they'll
[1:09:29] come
[1:09:31] no no
[1:09:32] you won't you wouldn't come anyhow
[1:09:35] no matter how sad it looked
[1:09:38] there's plenty of people that watched
[1:09:39] the crucifixion that what was the name
[1:09:41] of that one the passion
[1:09:45] and saul the how they portrayed it
[1:09:49] and walked away from there
[1:09:51] maybe said i'll never do something or
[1:09:53] maybe didn't even never feel nothing
[1:09:58] it wasn't going to be good enough
[1:10:00] to just go up there and die
[1:10:04] maybe maybe if i suffered enough it'll
[1:10:05] break their hearts and they'll come
[1:10:07] no
[1:10:09] we're pigs
[1:10:11] born in a manure pile
[1:10:13] he can just tell you right quick if he
[1:10:15] could talk i'll tend to my business and
[1:10:17] you tend to yours that's what a pig
[1:10:18] would say
[1:10:20] oh yeah we got pigs in church
[1:10:24] don't get on that preacher that ain't
[1:10:26] none of your business
[1:10:27] maybe it ain't the preacher maybe it's
[1:10:29] god
[1:10:32] but it takes a conversion
[1:10:35] god has to do it
[1:10:36] no man can come to jesus except god draw
[1:10:39] him first it takes the work of the holy
[1:10:42] spirit to even turn your heart
[1:10:44] it takes god someone said i sought god
[1:10:47] and i saw no no god is seeking you
[1:10:49] you're not seeking god god is seeking
[1:10:52] you all right the holy spirit is just
[1:10:53] doesn't just come in and take any kind
[1:10:55] of wife doesn't just come take
[1:10:56] somebody's smoke somebody drink somebody
[1:10:58] lives immoral somebody carries along
[1:11:00] with all kind of worldly things because
[1:11:01] he said if you love the world and the
[1:11:02] things of the world the love of god is
[1:11:04] not even in you but the holy spirit
[1:11:06] comes in the seal and the body the wife
[1:11:08] of jesus christ that he foreknew before
[1:11:11] the foundation of the world by being god
[1:11:14] by by him being god in foreknowledge he
[1:11:17] could see who would receive him and who
[1:11:19] will not receive him
[1:11:21] amen so the holy spirit comes to get
[1:11:24] that bride that's the one he takes in
[1:11:27] notice he said it's cause it's by the
[1:11:29] holy ghost i love this part it's got

[1:13:58] his voice has a purpose
[1:14:01] it's it's not just a broad as far as a
[1:14:04] broadcast yeah so he'd love to see the
[1:14:06] whole world say
[1:14:07] but it's going to very specific places
[1:14:10] and very specific people we read about
[1:14:13] in genesis 1 and verse 2 and the earth
[1:14:15] was without form and void and darkness
[1:14:18] was upon the face of the deep and the
[1:14:20] spirit of god moved upon the face of the
[1:14:23] waters
[1:14:24] amen in the word was the beginning the
[1:14:26] word was with god and the word was god
[1:14:27] that word was a thought expressed but
[1:14:30] that thought expressed became a word and
[1:14:32] went out let there be but the spirit of
[1:14:35] god was sent to make sure it was
[1:14:37] fulfilled
[1:14:39] amen he says he said may i go on record
[1:14:42] when that word goes out there isn't
[1:14:44] enough power and hell that can ever
[1:14:47] defeat the purpose of god
[1:14:50] god will do it anyhow
[1:14:52] see god put seeds in darkness he put
[1:14:55] seeds upon that formless earth and with
[1:14:58] avoided earth and full of just covered
[1:15:00] with chaos and water but why would he
[1:15:03] throw his seeds in such a place
[1:15:05] why would he put him in such darkness
[1:15:08] and such chaos why would he put him
[1:15:10] there because he knew his power to draw
[1:15:13] them out was greater than the power of
[1:15:16] darkness to keep them
[1:15:19] hallelujah why would he put seeds in
[1:15:21] laodicea in the darkest ages ever been
[1:15:24] because he knows his power to draw them
[1:15:27] out is greater than the power to keep
[1:15:29] them there
[1:15:31] and he'll draw him out of every walk of
[1:15:33] life he'll draw him out of the streets
[1:15:35] and off the off the highways and the
[1:15:37] byways his word is going to go forth and
[1:15:40] it will bring forth the people of bride
[1:15:42] for this age
[1:15:44] and it's doing so even now
[1:15:49] god looked over this bleak earth it
[1:15:52] wasn't nothing but one great big ball of
[1:15:54] turmoil and water and chaos
[1:15:57] and god sent the holy spirit to the
[1:15:59] earth
[1:16:00] the logos
[1:16:02] that light
[1:16:03] that went out of god
[1:16:05] and it began to brood over the earth
[1:16:09] now the word brood means to make love
[1:16:12] or to coo
[1:16:14] like a dove
[1:16:17] he said let there be life
[1:16:21] and that light went out
[1:16:23] and he began to put his wings brother
[1:16:25] around said we draw a picture like a big
[1:16:27] big two big wings that just put their
[1:16:30] arms around the earth
[1:16:32] and they go cool
[1:16:36] and in that darkness with seeds
[1:16:40] in that darkness
[1:16:41] was and that chaos
[1:16:44] seemed like nothingness
[1:16:46] it began to bring it to peace
[1:16:48] and tranquility
[1:16:50] with his arms wrapped around the earth
[1:16:53] it bring began to bring it to out of
[1:16:56] chaos and began to bring creation upon
[1:16:58] the earth and it was cool and it was
[1:16:59] brood and it was bringing and he said
[1:17:01] it's the same thing when the word goes
[1:17:04] forth amen the holy spirit is there to
[1:17:06] wrap his arms around somebody
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:11] it word knows where it's sent to
[1:17:14] amen the word is goes out it's not just
[1:17:16] sent out for just any reason the word is
[1:17:19] always for a purpose amen a man who
[1:17:22] preaches something that don't just get
[1:17:23] up and say well i'm just going to come
[1:17:25] up here and just say some things you
[1:17:26] know but god has begun to deal on his
[1:17:28] heart for specific things and god begins
[1:17:30] to pull this one off of that one and
[1:17:32] that one out of this job and that one
[1:17:33] thought they couldn't make it to church
[1:17:35] that night thought there wasn't no way
[1:17:36] but all of a sudden someone said i got
[1:17:37] to get to church
[1:17:39] i got to be there i i can't miss tonight
[1:17:42] i i want to receive something i got
[1:17:44] something in store i feel it
[1:17:46] what was it it's the cool of the holy
[1:17:48] spirit it knows what is vixen to come
[1:17:50] forth therefore it begins to prepare a
[1:17:52] bedding ground it begins to prepare a
[1:17:55] place for the word to have preeminence
[1:17:57] for the word to be fulfilled amen and
[1:18:00] that's that's why when you feel that tug
[1:18:01] and you feel that brother branham said
[1:18:03] i'll tell you what brother brown said he
[1:18:04] said if you've got the holy ghost when
[1:18:05] the doors are open that tug is too great

[1:19:52] his disciples said well what what good
[1:19:54] and what's in samaria
[1:19:56] well it happened to be a little soul

[1:20:00] darkness
[1:20:02] but those words went out i got a need to
[1:20:04] go that need was her
[1:20:07] and that word went to that need and
[1:20:09] began to pull her

[1:20:14] to go to the well that day i don't know
[1:20:16] maybe she was just going to do it later
[1:20:18] but at that moment something began to
[1:20:20] move on the inside of her and it began
[1:20:22] to pull her to that place what was it
[1:20:24] that word went out but the word don't
[1:20:26] just go out it's accompanied by the
[1:20:28] spirit of god and it began to pull that

[1:20:43] got to listen to this tattoo and take i
[1:20:44] got to do this i got to read my bible
[1:20:46] it's the cooling of the holy ghost
[1:20:49] trying to pull something out of your
[1:20:51] life
[1:20:54] trying to pull fruit trying to pull
[1:20:55] flowers trying to pull life
[1:20:59] after the while
[1:21:01] petroleum started coming up a little bit
[1:21:03] of this little easter lily all of a
[1:21:05] sudden popped out of the ground holy
[1:21:07] spirit cooing
[1:21:08] a dahlia come up in azalea
[1:21:11] it must have been somewhere around
[1:21:12] louisiana
[1:21:15] other bushes
[1:21:17] then along came visitation vegetation
[1:21:19] the holy spirit brought in then after
[1:21:21] that vegetation came trees
[1:21:24] and plant life afterwards birds began to
[1:21:27] come out of the dust of the earth
[1:21:30] the holy spirit brooding them together
[1:21:32] sent them into the air then came along
[1:21:35] animal life out of that dust stepped
[1:21:37] forth a line
[1:21:39] out of that dust stepped forth an
[1:21:40] elephant
[1:21:41] out of that dust death throat everything
[1:21:43] that was in the mind of god that holy
[1:21:45] spirit was brooding it out of that earth
[1:21:53] after a while came human life and all of
[1:21:56] our bodies
[1:21:58] was laying right there in the earth
[1:22:02] at that day
[1:22:08] but it wasn't time yet for your seed to
[1:22:10] come up
[1:22:12] it wasn't time for you to come into
[1:22:14] manifestation
[1:22:16] he had a specific time
[1:22:18] that he wanted this specific specie
[1:22:22] to come at a specific time
[1:22:25] so it could
[1:22:28] be able to withstand
[1:22:31] its surroundings
[1:22:35] do you know they do that they they make
[1:22:37] seeds you know man just perverts
[1:22:40] call it hybrids
[1:22:42] anybody's doing it for a reason he's not
[1:22:44] doing it just to try to maybe just maybe
[1:22:45] some of them do but they're really
[1:22:47] looking amen to see if they can make it
[1:22:49] maybe weather resistant or
[1:22:51] bug resistant or
[1:22:54] you know parasite resistant or or or
[1:22:57] to make it where it'd be more healthy
[1:22:58] and invite in this climate or in this
[1:23:00] environment
[1:23:01] they're trying to make it where they can
[1:23:03] you know maybe maybe let's just say
[1:23:05] citrus or something couldn't grow in a
[1:23:07] certain area so they tried to change it
[1:23:09] a little bit so it could grow in that
[1:23:11] area
[1:23:13] but god didn't do it by perversion he
[1:23:15] did it by conversion
[1:23:19] and he knew i have seeds laying there
[1:23:22] that are going to be powerful enough to
[1:23:24] withstand everything the devil has to
[1:23:26] have offered them amen and i'm going to
[1:23:28] bring them up at a certain time nope it
[1:23:30] ain't their time yet right now it's
[1:23:32] adam's time right now it's eve's time
[1:23:34] right now it's at abel's time right now
[1:23:36] it's moses or abraham's time right now
[1:23:38] moses time and right now and it keeps
[1:23:40] coming and keeping them all the way and
[1:23:42] even brother brown said that holy spirit
[1:23:44] began to brood a blood
[1:23:46] cell to where it created a blood cell
[1:23:49] inside of a little virgin to bring forth
[1:23:52] his own body that he could live in
[1:23:55] amen what was it he's brood and he's
[1:23:57] calling he's bringing them up out of the
[1:23:59] dust of the earth amen out of the place
[1:24:01] of darkness out of the place of chaos
[1:24:03] out of the place of impossibilities god
[1:24:05] the holy spirit is saying hey what i've
[1:24:08] got is greater than what's holding them
[1:24:10] the drawing power is that's able to draw
[1:24:13] them out of the darkness you can see it
[1:24:15] you can see when concrete's covering a
[1:24:17] seed of grass even if that seed is
[1:24:19] ordained to life it'll crack concrete
[1:24:22] i've seen a picture one time of a tree
[1:24:24] that burst open a rock and came how many
[1:24:26] has ever seen that picture is pretty
[1:24:27] popular came right up through a rock
[1:24:29] what was it that seed was ordained to
[1:24:32] life
[1:24:33] and there wasn't enough that could be
[1:24:34] put on top of it to keep it to come into
[1:24:37] life
[1:24:40] that ought to give us some victory
[1:24:41] tonight amen maybe maybe we ain't seen
[1:24:44] those seeds come up but just give the
[1:24:46] holy spirit time he's still wooing he's
[1:24:49] still calling
[1:24:50] he's still bringing them he's still
[1:24:52] calling them he's still cooing and one
[1:24:54] day that seed is going to come to life
[1:24:58] so don't ever give up hope
[1:25:02] it don't matter how dark it is it
[1:25:04] doesn't matter how deep they may sing it
[1:25:06] doesn't matter how far off they may be
[1:25:08] amen if they are ordained to life and i
[1:25:11] believe my children are i don't know
[1:25:13] about you but i believe my children are
[1:25:14] because i said the promise is unto me
[1:25:16] and my children
[1:25:18] hallelujah amen so it doesn't matter how
[1:25:21] much gets on top of them and how deep
[1:25:23] they seem to be covered but when that
[1:25:25] sun begins to pull on their life they
[1:25:27] can be in a drug house somewhere they
[1:25:29] can be in a bar room somehow they can be
[1:25:31] in a wherever even in the darkest of the
[1:25:33] four corners of the earth but that's the
[1:25:36] holy spirit begins to wrap his arms
[1:25:38] around
[1:25:39] cool
[1:25:40] cool
[1:25:42] cool
[1:25:43] because he knows
[1:25:44] what's calling is greater than what's
[1:25:47] holding.
[1:25:50] he knows where his seeds are
[1:25:57] he's not like humanity that can forget
[1:26:01] and just say well i lost him
[1:26:04] i don't know where i put them
[1:26:06] i don't know about you but that's pretty
[1:26:08] easy to do nowadays
[1:26:10] if you've got something you're trying to
[1:26:11] put up somewhere and you put it up too
[1:26:13] good
[1:26:15] like man

[1:26:26] a kid well if it had been a snake it bit
[1:26:28] you
[1:26:30] you're looking and you're looking right
[1:26:31] up god doesn't do that he knows where
[1:26:33] you're at
[1:26:36] he knows
[1:26:37] he's not forgot one of his
[1:26:40] he said could a mother forget a suckling
[1:26:42] child maybe
[1:26:45] maybe so
[1:26:46] but i'll never forget you
[1:26:48] because your names are engraved in the
[1:26:50] palms of my hands
[1:26:51] he knows where you're at he knows what
[1:26:54] it takes he knows how how to get you to

[1:27:14] come out
[1:27:15] someone he could fellowship with someone
[1:27:18] in his own image
[1:27:20] someone in his own likeness
[1:27:22] and he said there was nothing greater
[1:27:24] for the father that and he loved to do
[1:27:26] was to come down in the evening time
[1:27:29] and say

[1:28:02] in this time he's drawing a people to a
[1:28:05] place

[1:29:44] went through
[1:29:47] a very difficult time
[1:29:49] as you all know
[1:29:52] start even over over into
[1:29:55] 2020
[1:29:57] where my wife would be put in the
[1:29:58] hospital
[1:30:00] and uh
[1:30:02] with uh coven
[1:30:03] come very close to dying closer
[1:30:08] closer than i ever wanted her to
[1:30:12] and then that same week
[1:30:14] not getting much sleep with her in the
[1:30:16] hospital and me at home and
[1:30:18] same week i'd get woke up in the early
[1:30:20] morning by phone call from my father my
[1:30:22] mother was having a
[1:30:24] seizure we didn't know what it was
[1:30:26] so for
[1:30:27] for weeks and months months months
[1:30:30] wasn't able to rest
[1:30:33] because of those traumatic things had
[1:30:35] gotten a few phone calls from ruth
[1:30:38] just not been able to breathe and pray
[1:30:40] for me during the night
[1:30:41] so from that it would just begin to
[1:30:43] snowball as we went through the things
[1:30:44] we went through to my mom's death
[1:30:48] and
[1:30:50] and not even realizing the burden that
[1:30:52] was there and the
[1:30:53] pain that was there and the heartache
[1:30:55] was there
[1:30:56] it was just someone's crushing
[1:31:00] other things would go on it would even
[1:31:02] add to the burden and the crushing
[1:31:06] but on saturday morning
[1:31:08] i was out in the audience
[1:31:11] and
[1:31:13] something began to say
[1:31:14] to me brother andrew needs a drink

[1:31:20] drink go get somebody give him a drink

[1:31:30] and i go through the back reaching the
[1:31:31] cooler they had there and grab a
[1:31:33] gatorade
[1:31:34] around brother aaron's standing there
[1:31:36] and i said brother andrew needs a drink
