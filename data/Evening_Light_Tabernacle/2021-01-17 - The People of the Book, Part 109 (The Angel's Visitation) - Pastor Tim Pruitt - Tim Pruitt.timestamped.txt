[29:24] news amen the devil wants you to think
[29:28] it's all bad news but it's not all bad
[29:30] news matter of fact
[29:31] it's good news it's the gospel of jesus
[29:35] christ
[29:36] you know we've been uh remembering
[29:38] sister erica parker in our prayers
[29:40] every service trying to bring her name
[29:42] before you
[29:44] brother donny reagan shared this just a
[29:46] few days ago said sister erica had her
[29:48] follow-up today
[29:50] from the scans you had tuesday the scan
[29:53] showed us just scar tissue now and no
[29:55] growth which is good
[29:57] they wanted to go to nashville to see if
[29:58] there's a clinical trial she can
[30:00] participate
[30:01] and to be sure it never starts growing
[30:03] again as of now
[30:05] she's cancer-free
[30:09] [Music]
[30:14] [Music]
[30:18] hallelujah
[30:20] hallelujah praise the lord
[30:25] oh what a mighty god we serve
[30:29] cancer free
[30:33] he's a good god her
[30:36] sister-in-law sister crystal works in
[30:38] that field with
[30:39] specifically with cancer a lot of times
[30:41] and she said the
[30:42] type of cancer she has is treatable but
[30:45] it's not curable
[30:46] so it's a very big thing that there's no
[30:49] more cancer
[30:50] left in her body that's what the word of
[30:52] god can do
[30:54] sure god uses doctors but it takes god
[30:56] to heal
[30:57] and god to deliver and god is set free
[31:01] you know and i as we told these
[31:03] testimonies i i
[31:04] was reminded of that quote brother
[31:06] branham talked about he said it's time
[31:08] to have her joy shoes on
[31:10] amen to rejoice in the things of god
[31:13] and you know brother there's a little
[31:16] little fellow in this church his name is
[31:17] drew dexter and he
[31:20] he um he's quite the prayer warrior
[31:24] he knows what it's like for god to heal
[31:26] and deliver he's witnessed it
[31:28] in his own life and he's seen god move
[31:30] in miraculous ways
[31:32] as a matter of fact just recently as he
[31:35] was brought up here for prayer
[31:36] he was on some quite extensive
[31:40] therapy for his thyroids and things and
[31:43] some
[31:44] some really crazy medicines but even now
[31:47] the doctors have said his
[31:48] thyroid levels are perfect and he don't
[31:51] even have to have the medicine no more
[31:54] he knows what it's like to be healed and
[31:57] he's been praying every night for erica
[31:59] and
[32:00] brother mike just a few days ago or
[32:03] maybe weeks ago
[32:04] come home and just felt a real burden
[32:05] for my sister esther
[32:07] as he come home if i understand the
[32:09] story right comes into the house

[32:25] and so as he heard this news i believe
[32:27] they got this ready i want you to see
[32:29] amen the reaction this is just a few
[32:31] minutes into his reaction
[32:33] brother brother drew got happy because
[32:35] god answered his prayer
[32:38] amen go ahead

[33:58] they're sending me to sarah canassen and
[34:00] center
[34:01] to nashville to see if they have any
[34:03] available clinical trials to ensure it
[34:05] doesn't come back my doctor's so happy
[34:07] to tell us the news
[34:09] he said we praise god here every day
[34:13] thank you so much for every prayer there
[34:16] each one so appreciated the love and
[34:18] support we have felt in the past six
[34:19] months has been overwhelming

[34:26] there is nothing too hard for god the
[34:28] battle is over the victory's won it's

[34:59] two or three months to live and now

[35:04] of going and finding the cancer in his

[1:05:31] abraham

[1:05:38] seed of abraham
[1:05:40] through jesus christ the royal seed
[1:05:43] of abraham and god would take the
[1:05:45] natural seed here to
[1:05:47] do do a great work in order that he
[1:05:50] might
[1:05:51] prophesy and foretell of what he would
[1:05:54] do
[1:05:55] in his bride coming in this last day
[1:05:58] genesis 18 verse 1 and the lord did you

[1:06:34] he changed my life amen he made me a new
[1:06:38] creation in christ
[1:06:40] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[1:06:42] plains of
[1:06:43] memory in the as he sat in the
[1:06:46] tent door in the heat of the day
[1:06:49] and he lift up his eyes and lull three
[1:06:52] men
[1:06:53] stood by him and he saw them and he ran
[1:06:56] to meet them
[1:06:57] from the tent door and bowed himself to
[1:07:01] the ground and he was no trinitarian for
[1:07:03] he said
[1:07:04] my lord if i have found favor in thy
[1:07:08] sight pass not away i pray thee from thy
[1:07:11] servant
[1:07:12] and it didn't matter how many
[1:07:14] manifestations he had seen god in
[1:07:17] whether it had been as melchizedek or
[1:07:19] elohim
[1:07:20] or jehovah or as um el shaddai
[1:07:25] what manifestation god's revealed
[1:07:28] himself
[1:07:29] and each one of these was a revelation
[1:07:31] of himself
[1:07:32] you know el shaddai the breasted god the
[1:07:35] need supplier the almighty
[1:07:37] amen and so here he is comes as
[1:07:41] elohim and he here he's standing now
[1:07:45] in human flesh that he is wrapped around
[1:07:48] himself
[1:07:49] for visitation amen

[1:07:55] earth right now
[1:07:57] amen and to reveal them to reveal
[1:08:00] himself he will wrap himself
[1:08:02] in human flesh in your flesh and my
[1:08:05] flesh
[1:08:07] because that's where the angel of god is
[1:08:09] being revealed
[1:08:11] is in his people and he says
[1:08:14] let um verse 3 my lord if i found favor

[1:08:36] amen and i will fetch some morsel bread
[1:08:38] or verse four and
[1:08:40] let a little water i pray you be fixed
[1:08:42] and wash your feet and

[1:08:45] will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
[1:08:48] ye
[1:08:48] your hearts after that you shall pass on
[1:08:52] and therefore are you come to your
[1:08:53] servant and they said
[1:08:55] so do as thou has said
[1:08:58] and the abraham hastened unto the tent
[1:09:02] unto sarah and said make ready
[1:09:07] quickly three measures of fine meal
[1:09:10] knead it and make cakes upon the hearth
[1:09:13] and abraham ran to the herd and
[1:09:16] fetched a calf tender and good and gave
[1:09:19] it to a young man
[1:09:20] and hastened to dress it and he took
[1:09:22] butter and milk and the calf which he
[1:09:24] had dressed and set it before them
[1:09:27] and he stood by them under the tree and
[1:09:28] they did eat
[1:09:30] and they said unto him where is sarah
[1:09:33] thy wife
[1:09:34] and he said behold in the tent
[1:09:38] and he said i will certainly return
[1:09:41] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:09:45] and sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:09:48] and sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:09:50] which was behind him
[1:09:52] now abraham and sarah was old and well
[1:09:55] stricken in age
[1:09:57] and it ceased to be with sarah after the
[1:10:00] manner of women
[1:10:02] therefore sarah laughed within herself
[1:10:04] saying
[1:10:05] after i am waxed old shall i have
[1:10:07] pleasure
[1:10:08] my lord being old also and the lord said
[1:10:11] unto abraham
[1:10:12] wherefore did sarah live saying shall i
[1:10:16] of a surely bear a child which i'm old
[1:10:20] is anything too hard for the lord
[1:10:24] at the time appointed i will return unto
[1:10:28] thee
[1:10:28] according to the time of life and sarah
[1:10:31] shall have
[1:10:32] a son and then sarah denied saying i
[1:10:36] laughed not
[1:10:37] for she was afraid and he said nay but
[1:10:39] thou didst
[1:10:40] life god bless you you can be seated
[1:10:44] we're going to be speaking today on the
[1:10:46] angel's visitation
[1:10:50] and i i as we start in this service here
[1:10:54] today of course
[1:10:56] we are living in a great hour a great
[1:10:59] time
[1:11:00] of um of great trouble upon the earth
[1:11:05] we are living in a time where the in the
[1:11:08] political arena
[1:11:09] in our united states of america
[1:11:13] that our freedoms are quickly being
[1:11:16] taken away from us
[1:11:17] as we see the according to revelation 13
[1:11:22] the the the beast that rose up like a
[1:11:26] lamb
[1:11:28] has now begun to speak like a dragon
[1:11:31] so we're living in some very peculiar
[1:11:35] times it's troublesome hours and
[1:11:38] i just i as i'm thinking of this i
[1:11:41] wanted to share with you
[1:11:42] something that brother branham preached
[1:11:44] called watchman one of the night he said
[1:11:46] oh my friends listen
[1:11:48] to thus saith the lord if you consider
[1:11:51] me to be a servant
[1:11:53] is just before the break of day
[1:11:56] that's why this horrible gloom is over
[1:11:58] the earth it's just before the coming of
[1:12:01] the lord jesus
[1:12:02] there's no more hope left in nothing
[1:12:05] but is coming nations are against
[1:12:08] nations
[1:12:09] and they have filled through god's
[1:12:11] laboratory till they got power to blow
[1:12:14] one another into atomic ashes and
[1:12:17] they're wicked and they're unreligious
[1:12:19] and they're
[1:12:20] unchrist-like and the only motive they
[1:12:22] have and objective
[1:12:24] is to destroy and they are inspired
[1:12:27] what you at least listen these words
[1:12:29] they are inspired
[1:12:30] by the destroying angel that was sent
[1:12:33] from heaven to inspire these men
[1:12:37] let me say in the name of the lord jesus
[1:12:39] the holy spirit
[1:12:41] was sent as a watchman on the tower and
[1:12:44] the people cry
[1:12:46] what of the night and he says are you
[1:12:49] weary of this life
[1:12:51] are you weary of sin are you weary
[1:12:55] of funeral possessions and
[1:12:58] on sickness and ungodliness on every
[1:13:01] hand
[1:13:02] has the night been long and weary
[1:13:05] what other night watchmen and he said
[1:13:09] the morning come and see the comfort and
[1:13:11] the night is coming also
[1:13:14] so we're in a time when the night is
[1:13:17] coming and
[1:13:17] you know it's it's dark the watchman
[1:13:20] says the night cometh
[1:13:21] but also the morning so just remember
[1:13:24] that no matter what we see going
[1:13:26] wrong that we know the morning's coming
[1:13:30] as i was there this week and looking
[1:13:32] over
[1:13:33] the waters and looking watching the sun
[1:13:36] to rise
[1:13:38] and i saw you know as it were the sun as
[1:13:41] it
[1:13:41] broke over the horizon
[1:13:45] and and watching first um the morning
[1:13:48] star
[1:13:49] as it came out to herald the coming
[1:13:52] of the day and that's what god sent in
[1:13:55] this day was a messenger
[1:13:57] to herald the coming of the lord
[1:14:00] and actually you two are a herald of his
[1:14:03] coming
[1:14:05] because we are announcing the
[1:14:07] approaching
[1:14:08] day that's why we are of a different
[1:14:11] people we are a different
[1:14:12] race we are of a different culture we're
[1:14:16] not we're not just a
[1:14:17] americans living here we're more than

[1:14:24] getting ready for another kingdom to
[1:14:26] come
[1:14:27] and there is a kingdom that is now
[1:14:30] approaching
[1:14:31] and as it does you know the the
[1:14:34] darkness comes before the day but as it
[1:14:38] does
[1:14:38] the herald of the morning comes out
[1:14:42] and it begins to announce the coming
[1:14:45] of the day so you know though that we
[1:14:48] see you know and we're so weary of
[1:14:51] funeral processions
[1:14:53] and we're so weary because the night has
[1:14:55] been long
[1:14:56] and we're so weary because of sin and
[1:15:00] and sickness and ungodliness and i can
[1:15:03] hear some of you moan you know sometimes
[1:15:06] oh that could just all be over with
[1:15:09] you know that i'm so sick of this
[1:15:11] covader

[1:15:20] sickness on every hannah
[1:15:21] and and and things that are rising that
[1:15:24] there's no cure for
[1:15:27] when the night has been long and it's
[1:15:29] weary
[1:15:31] oh but the morning cometh
[1:15:34] it's not going to remain nighttime all
[1:15:36] the time
[1:15:38] we're about to see the dawning of a new
[1:15:40] day
[1:15:41] and i i hear brother branham saying he's
[1:15:43] in our friend says
[1:15:44] no matter how much you pray how much you
[1:15:47] pray for wars to cease
[1:15:49] just remember this is coming for this
[1:15:51] coming from me if you believe me to tell
[1:15:53] you the truth
[1:15:54] it won't do any good we're at the end of
[1:15:57] the road
[1:15:58] and god said that the world would get in
[1:16:01] this condition
[1:16:01] so we are we're here it's a signpost
[1:16:05] and when you see these things begin to
[1:16:07] come to pass
[1:16:08] lift up your head your redemption draw
[1:16:11] it nigh
[1:16:13] oh my now of course this
[1:16:16] is this how is what god does is always
[1:16:20] before that
[1:16:21] he he sends destruction or an angel of
[1:16:25] destruction and just
[1:16:26] just let me tell you just as sure as i'm
[1:16:29] standing in this pulpit there is an
[1:16:31] angel
[1:16:31] of destruction that is already being
[1:16:34] felt
[1:16:38] it's an angel of death and it's already
[1:16:41] struck
[1:16:42] churches and it's already struck homes
[1:16:44] it's already struck societies
[1:16:47] it's already struck america
[1:16:50] do whatever you want to to try to revive
[1:16:52] her you can't revive her
[1:16:55] are you with me you can you can you know
[1:16:58] join any kind of political system that
[1:17:00] you that you want to
[1:17:02] join with or whatever you will never
[1:17:04] change her
[1:17:06] you can go demonstrate in washington it
[1:17:08] won't do any good
[1:17:10] whatever you want to do is there there's
[1:17:13] no turning around because
[1:17:15] an angel of destruction america as we
[1:17:18] know it is being destroyed
[1:17:22] and man i really the the religious
[1:17:24] values that we've stood upon as being
[1:17:27] undermined the whole thing is coming to
[1:17:30] an end
[1:17:31] and it won't get any better you
[1:17:34] you're you know we we cry and we say
[1:17:36] well the crooked voting machines and
[1:17:39] you know the crooked elections and and
[1:17:41] all of this and
[1:17:42] and you know you'd have to be a foolish
[1:17:45] foolish
[1:17:46] uh almost an idiot to believe it wasn't
[1:17:50] let me just say it that way amen or
[1:17:53] brainwash
[1:17:54] by listening to the news
[1:17:57] liberal agenda are you with me
[1:18:01] amen because you we know but i mean it
[1:18:04] was that way
[1:18:05] it was that way when the first catholic
[1:18:07] president came in
[1:18:08] and the prophet of god told you they
[1:18:10] they rigged the machines to get this to
[1:18:12] happen
[1:18:13] and we come right back in and it's
[1:18:15] rigged again
[1:18:17] so there's no nothing you can do to turn
[1:18:20] things around
[1:18:21] there's no hope for it there's only one
[1:18:24] thing that you can hope for and that's
[1:18:26] the morning coming
[1:18:28] on that bright and cloudless morning
[1:18:31] when the dead in christ shall rise
[1:18:34] so there is an angel of destruction but
[1:18:37] before that happens he sends an angel
[1:18:41] of mercy and i want you to know the
[1:18:44] angel of mercy
[1:18:45] is still here he's still among his
[1:18:48] people
[1:18:49] and this is what we were seeing that
[1:18:51] just before sodom was burned
[1:18:53] here god with an angel of mercy would
[1:18:56] come
[1:18:57] and visit abraham
[1:19:00] amen now the angel of the lord preaches
[1:19:04] righteousness and repentance and the
[1:19:06] coming of the lord
[1:19:07] and showing signs and all of this is to
[1:19:10] get us to believe
[1:19:12] let me just share this one little
[1:19:14] quotation as we
[1:19:16] go a little further into this and this
[1:19:18] is from will the church go through the
[1:19:20] tribulation
[1:19:21] and the church will but the bride won't
[1:19:25] i want you to notice this because we
[1:19:27] have to cross cut
[1:19:28] short here on the count of the prayer
[1:19:30] lines you notice what the angel said
[1:19:32] i can't do nothing until you come hither
[1:19:35] what was it
[1:19:36] was a message of deliverance one before
[1:19:39] one speck of fire could fall from heaven
[1:19:42] lot had to get out of sodom and before
[1:19:45] one drop of rain fell from the earth
[1:19:48] uh from from upon the earth from heaven
[1:19:50] noah went into the ark
[1:19:52] and before the atom bomb can strike this
[1:19:55] nation the church will go into rapture
[1:19:57] to meet the lord jesus and if the
[1:20:00] spudniks and the
[1:20:01] missiles are sad and the hammers are
[1:20:04] pulled back
[1:20:05] and the angels all stand in an order
[1:20:08] hallelujah he says the great
[1:20:11] quarters of heaven is crowded full
[1:20:16] the harps are all in tune
[1:20:19] the great bands are already practice up
[1:20:22] there is a home time coming pretty soon
[1:20:26] for the church of the living god who's
[1:20:28] been waiting for his coming
[1:20:30] everything's in order i'm so glad he
[1:20:33] said i'm so tired
[1:20:35] and all for that great hour you know to
[1:20:37] think we've had a part in this junction
[1:20:40] time and to remember so shall it be in
[1:20:42] the coming of the son of man when the
[1:20:44] son of man is revealed from heaven
[1:20:46] now remember for the rain fell noah's in
[1:20:48] the ark for the fire fell
[1:20:50] lot was out of sodom for the angel said
[1:20:52] i can do nothing till you come hither
[1:20:54] i've got the leopard in my hand to pull
[1:20:56] and make the virus fall from heaven
[1:20:59] and i think that's exactly the the angel
[1:21:02] of destruction is holding the hand of
[1:21:04] russia
[1:21:05] with the atomic bombs until the church
[1:21:08] comes together as one great big body of
[1:21:10] christ
[1:21:11] and i can do nothing to you come hither
[1:21:14] oh if that isn't a blessed assurance if
[1:21:17] we see everything set in order
[1:21:19] the going home of the church is in order
[1:21:21] here is the angel of god with the same
[1:21:24] message performing the same signs the
[1:21:26] same wonders
[1:21:27] everything is set in order
[1:21:31] hallelujah can you imagine
[1:21:36] i can only think of him coming
[1:21:40] like isaac getting restless
[1:21:44] waiting for the caravan
[1:21:48] looking scanning every day making a move
[1:21:51] toward the well
[1:21:54] come on for the meeting in the air
[1:21:58] because we don't meet him in the heavens
[1:21:59] we meet him between the heavens and the
[1:22:01] earth
[1:22:02] just like isaac met the rebecca not at
[1:22:04] the tent but in
[1:22:05] at the well and we're about ready to
[1:22:08] make
[1:22:08] a move
[1:22:13] do you know what that means that means
[1:22:14] the easter the resurrection
[1:22:16] of all god's children is hanging low now
[1:22:19] and it's pressing on
[1:22:21] amen the angels are coming down the holy
[1:22:23] spirit is moving
[1:22:25] and the darkness has taken its last toll
[1:22:28] for the light will soon be here
[1:22:30] christ will come and the joy and the
[1:22:32] hope of all the ages of real
[1:22:34] resurrection for all believers
[1:22:36] for we will share with him in his
[1:22:38] resurrection
[1:22:39] as we have shared with him in his
[1:22:41] suffering
[1:22:43] last sunday we were preaching on who
[1:22:46] hath believed
[1:22:48] are you a believer amen
[1:22:51] that's who he appears to those
[1:22:54] who believe the report to them the arm
[1:22:57] of the lord is revealed
[1:22:59] amen we spoke of how the angel of the
[1:23:01] lord accompanies this
[1:23:03] message and and i i just want to remind
[1:23:07] you
[1:23:07] as we're talking about in the reason i
[1:23:09] am even bringing some of these things
[1:23:11] out i want you to remember
[1:23:14] that god doesn't forget his promise
[1:23:18] are you are you with me he doesn't
[1:23:20] forget his promise
[1:23:22] so for therefore the very angel that
[1:23:24] brought us a message
[1:23:26] is that very angel of the lord that is
[1:23:28] here to see it through
[1:23:30] he hasn't forgot us he hadn't forgot his
[1:23:33] promise
[1:23:34] as he said to sarah i will return
[1:23:37] according to the time of life
[1:23:39] there is a return of the angel and you
[1:23:41] should be under expectation
[1:23:44] amen we received a report that as a
[1:23:46] brother and his wife listened to the
[1:23:48] service they saw the angel of the lord
[1:23:50] come in their home
[1:23:53] and let tell you i'll just say this you
[1:23:55] need to live
[1:23:56] in a condition where the angel can
[1:23:58] appear to you
[1:24:00] or he's welcome in your home
[1:24:03] sister eileen walner told me of a
[1:24:05] testimony
[1:24:07] of seeing the pillar of fire where the
[1:24:10] angel of the lord brought healing to her
[1:24:12] house
[1:24:13] and let me tell you maybe you don't
[1:24:15] always see him
[1:24:17] because you know he can he
[1:24:21] to see him is never with these naked
[1:24:23] eyes
[1:24:24] it's with a it's with a spiritual eye
[1:24:27] that you see him
[1:24:29] amen because he is invisible to the eye
[1:24:33] the flesh as we'll get into the service
[1:24:36] in a little bit the flesh
[1:24:37] actually this flesh actually blinds us
[1:24:40] from his presence
[1:24:41] amen but you you neither do you feel him
[1:24:44] so much with your
[1:24:45] with your flesh you feeling with your
[1:24:47] spirit
[1:24:49] when he comes and passes by the holy
[1:24:52] spirit
[1:24:53] jesus said is is like a win he didn't
[1:24:55] say it was a win
[1:24:56] he said it was like a wind it moves in
[1:24:59] and you can tell by things that it does
[1:25:02] that he was there you know you never see
[1:25:05] the wind you just see the trees moving
[1:25:07] back and say well i see the wind that's
[1:25:09] blowing no you don't see the wind
[1:25:11] blowing you see the reaction
[1:25:14] of the of the the foliage to the wind
[1:25:17] so you don't actually see the wind but
[1:25:19] when the holy spirit begins to move and
[1:25:22] healings begin to happen or people begin
[1:25:24] to rejoice in the word
[1:25:26] or amens and hallelujahs begin to come
[1:25:28] forth
[1:25:29] it's the angel of god coming down and
[1:25:32] touching lives
[1:25:34] and you see the effects of them
[1:25:37] sister eileen you know her son david was
[1:25:41] born with a tear duct that was not
[1:25:43] complete
[1:25:44] and we all know sister walner brother
[1:25:47] joe's sister
[1:25:48] waldner that's brother joe's sister
[1:25:50] kathy morgan's brother and
[1:25:52] that's sister anita's mom and dad
[1:25:56] and her her son david was born with the
[1:25:59] tear duct
[1:26:00] it was not complete the tear duct was
[1:26:03] there but
[1:26:03] wouldn't drain the fluids and every
[1:26:06] morning his eye was completely covered
[1:26:08] with a green gummy substance that would
[1:26:10] glue his eyes shut and
[1:26:12] that eye appeared to be weak and a
[1:26:13] little smaller than the other
[1:26:16] and she would have to wash the eye out
[1:26:19] every day and throughout the day
[1:26:21] all through the day and in a prayer
[1:26:24] service
[1:26:25] a prophecy had went forth you still
[1:26:27] believe in prophecy don't you
[1:26:29] that said in three days you'll see the
[1:26:31] glory of god
[1:26:32] and the presence of god went home with
[1:26:34] them now that's what we want to happen
[1:26:38] you just don't want to have the presence
[1:26:40] that god felt at a meeting you want to
[1:26:41] take it home with you
[1:26:44] amen and the presence of god went home
[1:26:47] went with them
[1:26:48] as they went home and they went to bed
[1:26:50] that night and she was just still
[1:26:51] basking in the presence of the lord and
[1:26:54] she said lord
[1:26:57] you feel so near to me i feel like i
[1:26:59] could just reach out and touch you and
[1:27:01] and immediately speaking those words she
[1:27:03] saw a yellowish
[1:27:05] green light coming to the room and hover
[1:27:09] over her face
[1:27:10] it was like a living thing it was it
[1:27:13] quivered and
[1:27:14] felt warm on her skin it felt like a
[1:27:17] gentle caress
[1:27:19] and you know just was warm and beautiful
[1:27:23] and comforting
[1:27:24] yet it carried with it an awesome
[1:27:27] presence
[1:27:28] and in this experience he began to speak
[1:27:32] in other known tongues and
[1:27:33] or in unknown tongues and and
[1:27:36] immediately
[1:27:37] she she prophesied actually what it was
[1:27:41] is that light was now speaking using her
[1:27:44] vocal cords
[1:27:48] amen are you with me
[1:27:51] the light was used in her body to speak
[1:27:54] audible words
[1:27:56] and he says he says you are my child
[1:28:00] haven't i called you have not i said to
[1:28:02] you i will never leave you or forsake
[1:28:04] you
[1:28:04] but be with you even in you to the end
[1:28:07] because of your faith
[1:28:09] i will do it quickly even now
[1:28:12] and at that moment the light left and
[1:28:14] went right over to the baby crib
[1:28:17] and he the child let out a scream and
[1:28:19] was completely
[1:28:20] healed now i'm just gonna tell you
[1:28:24] i'm just gonna go ahead and tell you you
[1:28:26] get ready to see
[1:28:28] more and more of the angel of the lord
[1:28:36] and especially as the pillar of fire
[1:28:38] moves around us because he is here
[1:28:41] to confirm the message
[1:28:46] now you know brother branham had things
[1:28:49] to say about that and he says if you
[1:28:51] want the angels to appear to you
[1:28:54] keep your mind on god
[1:28:58] that's your war your battle right now in
[1:29:00] this service don't think the devil ain't

[1:31:51] right clean up the house clean up your
[1:31:53] habits clean up the things of the world
[1:31:55] get rid of your cards
[1:31:56] your worldly association
[1:32:02] come on now you already know facebook is
[1:32:05] programming your mind
[1:32:08] you know they are only only
[1:32:12] they're they're putting things on there
[1:32:13] only that they want you to believe
[1:32:16] so instead of facebook face the book
[1:32:25] rates in the book start looking at the
[1:32:26] prophecy
[1:32:28] start looking at what the word of god
[1:32:30] said of you
[1:32:33] i'll tell you you'll have a happier home
[1:32:36] you know why because you won't be over
[1:32:38] there envying what somebody else has got
[1:32:42] you won't be over there looking and
[1:32:44] saying well i wish i had a husband like
[1:32:46] that or a wife like this or a car like
[1:32:48] that or
[1:32:49] or you know they didn't give me that for
[1:32:51] my birthday
[1:32:54] i don't know why i'm here
[1:32:58] but i i know i'm here because i want
[1:33:00] angels to visit us
[1:33:04] amen get rid of your worldly association
[1:33:08] get ready and then the angel of god can
[1:33:10] speak and say fear not
[1:33:13] it is i and then things take place
[1:33:17] oh when a message when an angel comes
[1:33:20] he's got a message for you
[1:33:22] and the holy spirit god's angel is here
[1:33:26] with a message for every believer keep
[1:33:28] your mind
[1:33:29] on him keep thinking about him how
[1:33:32] lovely he is how sweet he is
[1:33:34] of his promises if you're sick
[1:33:38] get this on your mind he was wounded for
[1:33:41] my transgressions
[1:33:43] he was bruised for my iniquity the
[1:33:45] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[1:33:47] and with his stripes i was healed keep
[1:33:49] your mind centered
[1:33:51] like that something will happen to you
[1:33:59] if you want the honor of an angel
[1:34:01] visiting your home
[1:34:03] have your home ready to visit prepared
[1:34:07] and ready under the blood of the lamb
[1:34:09] the angel lord comes to such
[1:34:11] places notice you can't walk with the
[1:34:14] world and expect god to walk with you
[1:34:16] angels won't visit you nothing else but
[1:34:18] the world because you can't mix
[1:34:20] god in the world together they will not
[1:34:23] mix god's holy s
[1:34:25] holy and separated from the world and
[1:34:27] the only thing he will ever see you is
[1:34:29] through
[1:34:29] when he looks to the blood
[1:34:33] amen now when god visits the earth
[1:34:37] by an angel and announces something by
[1:34:40] angel
[1:34:40] he has something great he's going to say
[1:34:42] he's got a message
[1:34:44] and god has sent something great
[1:34:47] and he announced it by an angel sent
[1:34:50] from the presence of god to show us once
[1:34:52] again
[1:34:53] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:34:56] today and forever
[1:34:58] and we're here in the holy ghost
[1:35:00] dispensation
[1:35:02] and this will continue on right into the
[1:35:04] end because
[1:35:05] this is um this is the apostolic age
[1:35:10] and and it it will continue on brother
[1:35:13] branham says
[1:35:14] by the administration of angels to the
[1:35:17] church
[1:35:18] truly they are ordained spirits of god
[1:35:20] sent from god to carry out things
[1:35:23] and and every man was a
[1:35:27] special calling back to the age ages
[1:35:30] angels has visited men and he said it'll
[1:35:34] it won't it won't speak of some kind of
[1:35:37] mythical something
[1:35:39] that no one understands it'll speak of
[1:35:41] jesus christ
[1:35:42] it'll testify jesus christ and it'll
[1:35:45] produce
[1:35:45] jesus christ to the world
[1:35:49] what a privilege
[1:35:54] yet we live in a day that's the most
[1:35:59] anti-christ age ever
[1:36:01] anti-anointing
[1:36:06] days of miracles have passed no such
[1:36:10] thing as the holy ghost divine healing
[1:36:12] and varus anymore
[1:36:15] no such thing as visit of angels
[1:36:18] no such things as miracles and of course
[1:36:21] when you explain all the supernatural
[1:36:23] away from the bible
[1:36:25] you take god right out of church
[1:36:28] amen you do it by your traditions
[1:36:32] and traditions of course you know are
[1:36:34] the substitutes for the word of god well
[1:36:37] god spoke to a prophet to an angel but
[1:36:39] he won't speak to you to him by an angel
[1:36:41] oh yes he will
[1:36:43] amen he absolutely will you see
[1:36:47] what it is is that our christ
[1:36:50] is coming king and satan is doing
[1:36:53] everything that he can
[1:36:55] to throw dirt on his name to keep you
[1:36:58] from believing and and you know that
[1:37:00] it's like when when jesus um or excuse
[1:37:03] me when david was a fugitive
[1:37:06] from his throne and uh was being
[1:37:09] chased by absalom and had to gather with
[1:37:12] his
[1:37:12] generals there to to fight that great
[1:37:15] fight it was a man came out and began to
[1:37:17] spit on him
[1:37:19] and i want you to remember that this is
[1:37:21] the hour that we're living in christ has
[1:37:23] been rejected from the church
[1:37:26] and men and women are spitting upon him
[1:37:30] and as they as they do you know they're
[1:37:32] they're spitting and they're saying wow
[1:37:34] you're just a bunch of holy rollers just
[1:37:36] shouting you how this
[1:37:38] this rejoicing or like little
[1:37:41] drew was doing running around around
[1:37:43] because you know
[1:37:44] that was his way of shouting in my
[1:37:48] mind you know what it's the heart of a
[1:37:51] child
[1:37:52] but you see again they throw the dirt on
[1:37:55] and said there's nothing
[1:37:56] to this divine healing there's no such
[1:37:58] thing as angels there's
[1:38:00] no such things as prophets the days of
[1:38:02] miracles are past
[1:38:04] what are they doing they're just
[1:38:05] throwing dirt on his name
[1:38:09] but i'll tell you what when he comes
[1:38:11] back
[1:38:13] them little dirt throwers are going to
[1:38:14] be weeping and wailing and nationality
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:38:20] and we're living in the hour where he's
[1:38:22] coming back
[1:38:24] amen now
[1:38:30] a time where we're looking in the
[1:38:32] prophecy
[1:38:33] god come down walking among men
[1:38:37] revealing himself discerning the
[1:38:39] thoughts of sarah in the tent
[1:38:41] behind him all of these things
[1:38:44] using the dust of a man
[1:38:47] and of course as we've explained he
[1:38:49] could not use
[1:38:51] man in that fullness where he could step
[1:38:53] into at that time
[1:38:55] because there was no blood that could
[1:38:57] take away sin
[1:38:59] but after calvary now god uses men
[1:39:03] that he steps down into and he will use
[1:39:06] those
[1:39:06] men that he will speak through
[1:39:10] and of course this is this is what we
[1:39:13] are know that is happening in our age
[1:39:16] it's the same pillar of fire that led to
[1:39:20] israel
[1:39:21] because when jesus left from here he
[1:39:23] said
[1:39:24] i came from god and i go back to god
[1:39:28] so he returned to a pillar of fire that
[1:39:30] he had
[1:39:31] descended from now paul saw him on the
[1:39:34] road to damascus and he said that bright
[1:39:36] light he said
[1:39:37] i am jesus so now we know that jesus
[1:39:42] is not going to come here in a physical
[1:39:45] form and a nail scarred body
[1:39:47] but he will come in the power of the
[1:39:50] holy ghost the pillar of fire
[1:39:52] and every one of you who have been born
[1:39:55] again
[1:39:56] by the spirit of god had received a
[1:39:58] portion of that fire
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:01] amen so he's dwelling in your body to
[1:40:04] use your flesh
[1:40:07] to give a message to this world too that
[1:40:09] he lives
[1:40:14] in fact you're the greatest sign that
[1:40:16] this world is ever going to receive
[1:40:19] in fact shall i say that the bride of
[1:40:21] christ is the last sign
[1:40:24] and when he removes this sign the
[1:40:26] judgment is to move to come
[1:40:29] now he said of angels are they not
[1:40:32] ministered spirits
[1:40:34] sent forth to minister for them that
[1:40:35] shall be heirs of salvation
[1:40:38] so i want you to notice this scripture
[1:40:41] is so true that's hebrews 1 14.
[1:40:44] angels are ministering spirits
[1:40:47] to those that are heirs of salvation
[1:40:50] so if we're heirs of salvation we're
[1:40:53] going to be recipients
[1:40:55] of ministering spirits which are angels
[1:40:59] and because they come to those who the
[1:41:02] heirs of salvation
[1:41:04] the people of the book are going to hear
[1:41:07] from minister and spirits
[1:41:09] angels have received angelic visitations
[1:41:13] now i want you to remember that when the
[1:41:16] angel appeared to brother branham
[1:41:18] it was for a specific reason it was not
[1:41:21] just to
[1:41:22] uh to just start a divine healing
[1:41:24] movement and
[1:41:25] and many many people be healed but it
[1:41:27] was that was just to
[1:41:29] that was just to attract the attention
[1:41:32] in order to get the people ready for a
[1:41:34] message
[1:41:36] so he could prove that the angel of the
[1:41:38] lord
[1:41:39] was there and the angel lord had a
[1:41:42] message
[1:41:43] we'll speak more about that message as
[1:41:46] we go along things that were revealed
[1:41:48] personally by the angel lord to us
[1:41:51] because we have
[1:41:52] a message that was administered by an
[1:41:55] angel
[1:41:56] as i say this sets us apart from all the
[1:41:59] other denominations
[1:42:00] even even from bringing from from
[1:42:03] joseph smith and the mormons it sets us
[1:42:06] apart from the mormons
[1:42:07] he had an angel but it wasn't according
[1:42:10] to the word
[1:42:11] this was a scriptural angel who revealed
[1:42:15] to us
[1:42:17] not a new book but the bible and made it
[1:42:20] a new book
[1:42:22] and the reason it made the bible a new
[1:42:24] book is because
[1:42:26] we quit looking through the lenses of
[1:42:29] the
[1:42:29] of the theologians and begin to see it
[1:42:32] through the eyes of an
[1:42:34] angel
[1:42:37] now so this this angel of god sent from
[1:42:41] jesus christ is to testify
[1:42:44] that the last days are here
[1:42:49] that's why he came he's letting you know
[1:42:53] you're in the last days little children
[1:42:57] now he gave a message as brother bradham
[1:43:01] said he said to me this message would go
[1:43:04] around the world
[1:43:05] and would start a revival
[1:43:11] don't don't let that pass over your head
[1:43:14] it would start a revival
[1:43:17] so if you're sitting dead in your sins
[1:43:21] or dead in your pew are
[1:43:24] dead in your churches and lifeless
[1:43:28] with no god there you miss the message
[1:43:33] go back and hear it again amen because
[1:43:37] this message was he said he'd send me
[1:43:39] this message we'd go around the world
[1:43:41] and start a revival
[1:43:45] amen you ought to begin with saying to
[1:43:50] god today and start that revival right
[1:43:51] here
[1:43:53] let me be the revival let me i'll just
[1:43:56] talk about a revival
[1:43:57] let me be that revival and so much that
[1:44:01] i become a messenger of this revival
[1:44:06] and this revival would sweep around the
[1:44:08] world and it'd be just before the coming
[1:44:10] of christ the second time
[1:44:12] and i hear the scoffer saying but oh
[1:44:15] that was 75 years ago
[1:44:18] that he said this and he didn't come yet
[1:44:26] and you're a skeptic and an unbeliever
[1:44:30] and you're blind because he has come
[1:44:36] he come with a shout and a prophet and
[1:44:39] brought a message
[1:44:40] the word coming to prophet that's his
[1:44:42] coming
[1:44:44] it takes flesh in and bright form
[1:44:48] so the true bride is this coming
[1:44:52] are you with me amen because he comes
[1:44:54] before he
[1:44:55] we meet him in the air and the groom
[1:44:57] coming he has to be here on the earth in
[1:45:00] bride coming
[1:45:03] so we're right here in the very middle
[1:45:05] of the coming lord don't go to sleep in
[1:45:07] this hour
[1:45:08] remember but become a part of that
[1:45:11] [Applause]
[1:45:14] coming
[1:45:19] remember the blessings from the angel is
[1:45:22] dependent on your faith
[1:45:25] in the report you must believe the
[1:45:27] report
[1:45:29] you must believe you must believe and be
[1:45:31] able to see and many people can say yeah
[1:45:33] he was in god's prophet hey we got
[1:45:35] we we got a personality cult
[1:45:39] where they they worship the personality
[1:45:42] of william branham
[1:45:44] make him infallible make him a god make
[1:45:46] him
[1:45:47] you know all kinds of things are you
[1:45:49] with me it's a personality cult
[1:45:51] they think that's all the message was
[1:45:53] god sent on a prophet
[1:45:55] it was a part of the message it wasn't
[1:45:58] part of his coming
[1:46:00] it was a phase of his coming but it's
[1:46:02] not all of his coming
[1:46:04] he's got to come in you and you and you
[1:46:06] and you and you and you
[1:46:10] the word has to become flesh
[1:46:15] a bride has to materialize on the earth
[1:46:17] whether it can be a rapture you can't
[1:46:19] rapture nothing
[1:46:22] you've got to have a people for his
[1:46:23] namesake of people whose hearts
[1:46:26] turn back to faith again a people who
[1:46:28] believe again
[1:46:35] the whole thing was dependent on if you
[1:46:38] can get people to believe
[1:46:44] not even the angel can help you if you
[1:46:47] don't believe
[1:46:51] amen there was a woman given a message
[1:46:56] and she refused to believe it she was
[1:46:59] told
[1:46:59] don't look back
[1:47:05] and the angel couldn't help her
[1:47:08] when she didn't listen she turned to
[1:47:11] pillar assault
[1:47:14] amen and she became a part
[1:47:19] she became a part of the of the ashes
[1:47:23] and the salt and the burning and the
[1:47:25] brimstone
[1:47:26] of sodom
[1:47:30] now i don't want to be a part of the
[1:47:32] brimstone of sodom
[1:47:34] and man i want to be one of those that
[1:47:37] stays with abraham
[1:47:39] that the angel of god comes to and sarah
[1:47:42] brings forth that promised son
[1:47:44] the church brings forth that promised
[1:47:47] son
[1:47:48] now again brother branham was told
[1:47:52] over again if you can get the people to
[1:47:55] believe you
[1:47:56] then nothing will stand before your
[1:47:58] prayer
[1:48:00] anything can happen if you can get the
[1:48:03] people to believe
[1:48:04] you the rapture will take place
[1:48:07] if you can get people to believe you or
[1:48:10] your heart has got to be turned
[1:48:12] or you're with me and he says now not
[1:48:14] believe me as him
[1:48:16] but leave believe that he sent me to
[1:48:19] help you
[1:48:20] i'm just his voice
[1:48:23] amen i'm just his voice by vision by
[1:48:26] looking at
[1:48:27] just like looking at anything you see
[1:48:29] now you believe it
[1:48:31] so he says now i'm just his voice that's
[1:48:33] all i am i'm his voice
[1:48:36] i'm the voice that the angel is using
[1:48:40] and you've got to believe me like i said
[1:48:42] this man
[1:48:43] would be different from others there was
[1:48:46] others with gifts
[1:48:48] there was or robert said i've got the
[1:48:50] power of god in my right hand
[1:48:52] which god's power don't dwell in
[1:48:53] anybody's hands but nevertheless he had
[1:48:56] he had a gift of healing and people were
[1:48:59] healed
[1:49:00] there was jackko a man with blind faith
[1:49:05] amen but many were healed
[1:49:08] and delivered are you with me amen
[1:49:12] but this man william branham was
[1:49:14] different from all the others
[1:49:16] because he was the voice of an angel
[1:49:23] now not in everything because he was
[1:49:25] still human
[1:49:27] he was still a man he'd still have human
[1:49:30] thoughts
[1:49:31] he could still have human assumptions
[1:49:35] he could be presumptuous and presume
[1:49:37] things
[1:49:38] he understood some things as a man and
[1:49:40] would misunderstand
[1:49:42] things but when the angel wanted to
[1:49:44] speak
[1:49:46] he would use his vocal cords
[1:49:50] it was a message administered by an
[1:49:53] angel
[1:49:54] he said he said in the south african
[1:49:56] testimony he said the age of the lord
[1:49:58] said
[1:49:58] not believe me as him but leave but
[1:50:01] believe
[1:50:02] me that he sent me
[1:50:06] and then he says now to you who believe
[1:50:08] the angel of god who has
[1:50:09] been sent to help me to help you to
[1:50:13] believe
[1:50:14] jesus christ
[1:50:20] now this is exactly what the whole
[1:50:23] message
[1:50:24] was about to get you to believing again
[1:50:27] to believe jesus christ someone say oh
[1:50:30] we're just going to go back
[1:50:32] and we're going to just leave the
[1:50:33] message and we're just going to go
[1:50:35] because we're just going to believe in
[1:50:36] jesus no you won't
[1:50:38] you believe in the jesus of methodist or
[1:50:40] baptist or pentecostal
[1:50:43] but you won't believe in the jesus of
[1:50:45] this bible
[1:50:46] because this jesus of the bible would
[1:50:48] come in the pillar of fire and he would
[1:50:51] identify a message
[1:50:55] well we'll just take the bible no you
[1:50:57] won't you'll take your interpretation of
[1:50:59] the bible
[1:51:00] you say well you you follow william
[1:51:02] branham and his interpretation no we
[1:51:04] don't
[1:51:05] we follow what the angel of god told
[1:51:07] william branham
[1:51:09] it's a message administered by an angel
[1:51:13] that come from the scripture
[1:51:17] are you with me if you can get me get
[1:51:20] the people to believe you not believe me
[1:51:22] as a man but believe the message
[1:51:25] that i'm telling you you see like sarah
[1:51:28] she believed
[1:51:29] everything that abraham reported
[1:51:32] she even believed what he told what the
[1:51:34] angel of god told hagar
[1:51:36] you know the first time the first time
[1:51:39] that
[1:51:40] the angel of god appears is to hagar
[1:51:43] that's first of all time the word angels
[1:51:45] mentioned in the bible is to hagar
[1:51:50] and and the angel goes and and says
[1:51:53] to hagar you know this is the first time
[1:51:55] that she's been
[1:51:56] thrown out of the camp and has ran
[1:51:59] because of
[1:52:01] sarah's persecution and and she's up in
[1:52:04] the bushes crying and
[1:52:05] god the angel the lord appears to her
[1:52:07] and said go back and be subject to sarah
[1:52:10] because the child in your womb will be a
[1:52:12] great nation
[1:52:15] is that right amen so you know but
[1:52:19] remember it was abraham's camp
[1:52:22] that the angel was appearing and like
[1:52:25] sarah she believed
[1:52:26] everything that abraham reported about
[1:52:28] the angel of the lord
[1:52:30] she believed that he had heard that
[1:52:32] voice
[1:52:34] there in the earl of the chaldeans and
[1:52:36] and
[1:52:37] that told him to to to walk before me
[1:52:39] and be thou perfect
[1:52:41] she believed about him being um
[1:52:45] there and revealed himself as as jehovah
[1:52:49] of jehovah um
[1:52:52] there on the at the altar and all the
[1:52:54] things that the very
[1:52:56] events that happened and how that he
[1:52:58] revealed to abraham
[1:53:00] how to offer a lamb and how to give a
[1:53:03] blood
[1:53:03] sacrifice and all the things that he
[1:53:06] taught abraham to do
[1:53:07] she believed all of that she believed
[1:53:10] that
[1:53:10] abraham was going to have a child
[1:53:14] come on amen she believed it but it
[1:53:17] wasn't personal
[1:53:21] and you can believe about jesus and you
[1:53:24] could even believe he was virgin born
[1:53:27] oh how can i even believe this you know
[1:53:29] that is that he can be virtual but i
[1:53:31] believe it
[1:53:33] you can believe you can believe that
[1:53:35] guts and a prophet
[1:53:37] you can believe he was visited by an
[1:53:39] angel you can believe that the miracles
[1:53:41] were real
[1:53:42] but it's got to become personal to you
[1:53:49] and that's the purpose of the coming of
[1:53:51] the angel was to make
[1:53:52] god personal to us a personal god
[1:53:56] i know your address i know where you
[1:53:59] live
[1:54:01] i know where i know where your location
[1:54:03] is it's 17
[1:54:05] 500 highway 371 men to louisiana
[1:54:09] amanda he could tell your address come
[1:54:12] on somebody
[1:54:13] your name your condition what the doctor
[1:54:17] said
[1:54:18] amen everything else what was it to make
[1:54:21] us aware
[1:54:22] of a supernatural gospel that this god
[1:54:25] is a god
[1:54:25] who knows every detail of our life
[1:54:28] and this is a god who even hears you
[1:54:31] when you pray
[1:54:32] when you were praying there you prayed
[1:54:34] such-and-such and such
[1:54:36] and god has answered your prayer
[1:54:38] [Music]
[1:54:42] god hears amen somebody mentioned it the
[1:54:47] other day but a little sister there
[1:54:49] was dying and then the doctors had given
[1:54:52] her up
[1:54:53] and even brother branham told her to get
[1:54:55] ready to die said look like it's going
[1:54:57] you're gonna die you know just get ready
[1:55:00] for it
[1:55:04] and he said
[1:55:07] that this little lady was there and some
[1:55:10] women had come
[1:55:11] in nurses and so on to help with
[1:55:13] situations and
[1:55:15] maybe made to clean the house and some
[1:55:17] of them was tall i don't believe in that
[1:55:19] billy branham i don't believe that an
[1:55:21] angel of god
[1:55:23] come by his way i don't believe none of
[1:55:25] that stuff i don't believe none of it
[1:55:28] and that little sister raised up you
[1:55:30] remember her name
[1:55:32] maybe it was miss weaver but anyway she
[1:55:34] she raised up
[1:55:36] she raised up and she said oh yes sir
[1:55:38] but i've been there
[1:55:40] i've seen the holy spirit move i've seen
[1:55:42] it discern hearts
[1:55:44] i've seen it healed and i believe that
[1:55:46] angel
[1:55:49] a man and a vision breaks over to
[1:55:51] brother branham and said go tell her
[1:55:52] i heard her i
[1:55:56] heard her when she stood up for the
[1:55:57] message
[1:55:59] when she stood for the truth i heard her
[1:56:01] what she said
[1:56:02] and because of that i'm sin of the
[1:56:04] healing right her way
[1:56:06] and the woman was killed of her cancer
[1:56:09] and
[1:56:09] death left her body because the angels
[1:56:13] bird
[1:56:18] that's why that's why hagar you know
[1:56:22] what
[1:56:22] would name one of the places there the
[1:56:24] lord sees and hears
[1:56:31] that was the purpose of the coming of
[1:56:33] the angel of god to make god personal
[1:56:36] to make us aware of a supernatural
[1:56:38] gospel
[1:56:40] look you're a people
[1:56:44] that whether you like it or not you're
[1:56:46] different from any
[1:56:48] other race of people i'm talking about
[1:56:51] just
[1:56:52] a natural people here on earth you're
[1:56:54] different from those that were
[1:56:56] a hundred years ago
[1:57:00] you believe in a world that they didn't
[1:57:04] know anything about
[1:57:09] you go you walk right over there to a
[1:57:12] wall and plug
[1:57:13] in a in a a vacuum cleaner or
[1:57:17] or some other kind of instrument you
[1:57:19] walk right over there and you expect it
[1:57:21] to run and to turn on and a power
[1:57:24] to come into that thing by plugging into
[1:57:26] that power
[1:57:28] you live in a realm that they knew
[1:57:30] little or nothing about
[1:57:33] maybe 150 years ago but they didn't know
[1:57:39] you're living it's an invisible round
[1:57:42] you can't even see it like i said
[1:57:45] you can feel it it'll shock you
[1:57:50] you live in a realm where that you know
[1:57:53] you have moved into a time that was once
[1:57:55] a dick tracy um uh
[1:57:59] fantasy man where you
[1:58:02] get messages on your watch
[1:58:06] word that you can speak into your watch
[1:58:08] and it goes across the world
[1:58:11] where you got a little device in your
[1:58:13] hand and you can be in real time around
[1:58:16] the world
[1:58:17] your your your people
[1:58:20] that's not natural that was natural back
[1:58:24] there this is not natural
[1:58:26] this is super natural but a
[1:58:29] man has broken into realms
[1:58:32] that has made in the invisible realm
[1:58:36] that right now my voice my image goes in
[1:58:39] real time
[1:58:40] over into africa down to india over into
[1:58:44] japan over anywhere around the world
[1:58:47] in in milliseconds time to where that
[1:58:50] it's in real time
[1:58:53] that they're watching this you know
[1:58:55] right there just as you're hearing
[1:58:56] they're hearing it
[1:59:00] and it's a world that has been
[1:59:03] previously
[1:59:04] unknown to man but now known to man
[1:59:12] might ask you a stupid question how many
[1:59:15] believes that's real
[1:59:19] every one of you believe that's real you
[1:59:21] know it's real
[1:59:23] you know now that's a real dimension
[1:59:27] that's a real world
[1:59:32] and those men that understand that you
[1:59:34] say wow
[1:59:38] right those men who can figure it out
[1:59:42] and how it works and you know how this
[1:59:44] and
[1:59:45] and knows how to troubleshoot you say
[1:59:47] wow
[1:59:48] it's a world that has been made real to
[1:59:51] you
[1:59:52] but in the same age
[1:59:56] god has used a man
[2:00:00] to bring the invisible realm of the
[2:00:03] supernatural
[2:00:05] right here and
[2:00:08] open up a world to us that was
[2:00:11] previously unknown to the church
[2:00:16] that hadn't been known about for
[2:00:17] hundreds of years
[2:00:19] thousands of years amen to where we're
[2:00:23] walking where the apostles have
[2:00:25] tried were angels appearing i send them
[2:00:28] descending
[2:00:29] visions break humans take place
[2:00:33] and my voice is speaking
[2:00:36] listen i know i was there
[2:00:40] some of you you know some of some of you
[2:00:43] say well i i don't know about all this i
[2:00:45] i say
[2:00:46] i was there i was there i
[2:00:49] i sat there you know in a pew watch
[2:00:51] brother brad and preach watch him
[2:00:53] discern the thoughts and intents of
[2:00:54] heart
[2:00:55] and i knew it was somebody besides
[2:00:57] william branham there
[2:00:59] i didn't see an angel i didn't see a
[2:01:02] light
[2:01:02] but i knew he was telling things that
[2:01:04] only god knew
[2:01:09] and he was bringing god present to me
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:14] now so you see the very purpose of the
[2:01:18] coming of the angel
[2:01:19] was to make us cognate to make us
[2:01:22] realize and aware of a supernatural
[2:01:26] gospel
[2:01:29] now brother branham would say about it
[2:01:33] he says now i'm just his voice
[2:01:39] i i i could share with you a quotation
[2:01:42] where he would say
[2:01:43] you know i i've prayed and prayed and
[2:01:45] asked for
[2:01:46] uh healing and and waited for visions
[2:01:49] for
[2:01:49] for a little edith wright and she sat in
[2:01:52] a wheelchair and she suffered and
[2:01:54] i've seen god heal her and heal her of
[2:01:56] of sicknesses and
[2:01:58] and and and things but she still sit
[2:02:01] right there
[2:02:02] in that wheelchair he said now
[2:02:06] if i had anything to do with it i would
[2:02:09] heal her
[2:02:12] but i don't have anything to do with
[2:02:16] this
[2:02:19] you say well why why would god do that
[2:02:21] well i don't understand that god
[2:02:23] well i'll just tell you this much his
[2:02:26] ways is par
[2:02:27] past finding out
[2:02:30] and if he would explain it to you'd
[2:02:32] probably go over your little pea brain
[2:02:34] head anyway
[2:02:35] one day when you become immortal we'll
[2:02:38] understand things
[2:02:40] better by and by the wise and the word
[2:02:43] followers
[2:02:44] right now we just walk by faith lord you
[2:02:46] hold it all in your hand you know what's
[2:02:48] best for me
[2:02:53] and he brother bradham said in anointed
[2:02:55] ones at the end time
[2:02:57] he said you might have thought today i
[2:02:59] was trying to say something about myself
[2:03:02] that i was packing this message being i
[2:03:04] was packing this message
[2:03:06] i have no more to do with it than
[2:03:08] nothing no more than just a voice
[2:03:11] and my voice listen this even against my
[2:03:14] better judgment
[2:03:17] i want to be a trapper
[2:03:20] in other words even against what he
[2:03:23] wanted to do
[2:03:25] and he says but it's the will of my
[2:03:27] father that i declare to do and
[2:03:29] determined to do i wasn't the one that
[2:03:31] appeared that day
[2:03:32] that down on the river i was only
[2:03:34] standing there
[2:03:36] when he appeared
[2:03:39] i'm not the one that performs these
[2:03:40] things and foretells these things that
[2:03:42] happens just as perfect as they are
[2:03:44] i'm just the one that's near when he
[2:03:46] does it
[2:03:47] some people want to come along and
[2:03:48] discredit the message say well
[2:03:50] when he was standing there that day and
[2:03:53] he was
[2:03:53] he was there on the ohio river it was
[2:03:55] his voice it said
[2:03:57] as john the baptist well
[2:04:00] what if he was that's the way god does
[2:04:06] when he prophesied through sister eileen
[2:04:09] a while ago
[2:04:10] we were talking about that was the
[2:04:11] angel's voice
[2:04:13] angel using her voice
[2:04:16] any time a prophecy comes and saying
[2:04:19] thus saith the lord it's god using a
[2:04:22] voice
[2:04:24] amen so what if it was i don't say it
[2:04:26] was i said what if it was
[2:04:27] it don't discredit nothing because why
[2:04:30] i know this man was the angel's voice
[2:04:34] amen and he said it wasn't me he said
[2:04:38] i was only the voice that i'm only the
[2:04:40] one near when he does it
[2:04:41] i was i was only a voice he used to say
[2:04:44] it
[2:04:44] i'm not the one who tells these things
[2:04:46] and foretells these things that happens
[2:04:48] as perfect as they are he says it wasn't
[2:04:51] me what i knew
[2:04:52] it's just what i surrendered myself to
[2:04:56] that he spoke to it isn't me it wasn't
[2:04:58] the seventh angel
[2:05:00] oh no it's the manifestation of the son
[2:05:02] of man it wasn't the angel
[2:05:04] his message it was a mystery of god that
[2:05:07] unfolded
[2:05:07] it's not a man it's god the angel was
[2:05:11] not the son of man he was a messenger
[2:05:13] from the son of man
[2:05:14] the son of man is christ and he's the
[2:05:17] one you're feeding on
[2:05:21] you're not feeding on a man his words
[2:05:24] will fail
[2:05:25] but you're feeding on the unfailing body
[2:05:28] word of the son of man
[2:05:32] that's the personality i'm following
[2:05:38] now there was a great pool
[2:05:41] of bethesda this great pool was a place
[2:05:45] where
[2:05:45] maybe hundreds if not thousands gathered
[2:05:50] they were waiting for the waters to be
[2:05:52] troubled
[2:05:54] ever so often we are not told how it was
[2:05:57] that
[2:05:57] in the season the angel of god would
[2:06:01] come and trouble the water
[2:06:04] now when that when that would happen
[2:06:08] the the pool could not say
[2:06:11] look what a great water i am
[2:06:14] of all the waters i'm the greatest
[2:06:18] you see because the water had nothing to
[2:06:21] do with it
[2:06:23] it was the angel of god that came down
[2:06:26] upon the water and when the angel left
[2:06:28] it was just water again
[2:06:32] i remember the same thing with brother
[2:06:34] branham you know when the angel of god
[2:06:36] came down
[2:06:37] it was the voice of god to you he said
[2:06:40] now if i offended you by saying that
[2:06:42] forgive me but i felt it might have been
[2:06:43] resented but i
[2:06:44] am god's voice to you you say i say that
[2:06:47] again
[2:06:48] and that time was under inspiration i
[2:06:50] felt about it the first time
[2:06:51] but it repeated it
[2:06:54] now he said i can't i can say nothing in
[2:06:57] myself but when
[2:06:58] what he shows me i say it and you
[2:07:00] believe it and watch what happens
[2:07:02] see and he says now he's here at the
[2:07:06] platform it's true
[2:07:08] i don't know how to make you believe it
[2:07:09] but it's true and if you'll not look at
[2:07:11] the man your brother but if you'll look
[2:07:13] to what i'm speaking about the lord
[2:07:15] jesus
[2:07:16] his and his healing angel at the
[2:07:18] platform
[2:07:19] you believe god has angels of healings
[2:07:22] commissioned
[2:07:23] what was on the breath serpent land you
[2:07:26] think a
[2:07:27] piece of brass could heal you from the
[2:07:29] serpent bite
[2:07:30] it was the angel of god a man that was
[2:07:34] that caused him to look at that brass
[2:07:35] serpent which meant sin was judged
[2:07:38] brass being the color of judgment and he
[2:07:41] says
[2:07:42] he says um again what was the water on
[2:07:45] the pool but that's a
[2:07:46] if it wasn't an angel that came from
[2:07:48] heaven
[2:07:50] see i'm not god's gift the angel is
[2:07:52] god's gift
[2:07:55] and it came out of heaven i come from
[2:07:57] the earth and he come from heaven down
[2:07:59] in shroud and clothed an earthly vessel
[2:08:02] to speak to an earthly people that you
[2:08:04] would believe on him not on me but on
[2:08:07] him of what i'm talking about
[2:08:09] and by doing so god will heal you
[2:08:12] and that's the whole thing this is the
[2:08:14] whole point of deliverance is when you
[2:08:16] believe
[2:08:17] on what the angel said
[2:08:20] now even they testified never die
[2:08:23] did that angel ever speak but what had
[2:08:26] happened
[2:08:28] never time did he ever miss
[2:08:31] it wasn't 90 it wasn't 99
[2:08:35] it was every time
[2:08:38] [Music]
[2:08:40] why because it was god it was jesus
[2:08:43] christ the pillar of fire
[2:08:44] speaking and he would use a human vessel
[2:08:47] to speak
[2:08:50] i see a doctor he's a big man
[2:08:53] he's got tortoise health glasses like
[2:08:56] he's
[2:08:57] he said that your cancer is incurable
[2:09:03] i see you've had one two
[2:09:06] three four five operations
[2:09:12] this is where you live this is your
[2:09:15] address
[2:09:16] you're healed
[2:09:19] you know why because all of a sudden
[2:09:22] somebody's faith
[2:09:24] got lifted up to realize this man don't
[2:09:27] know all of this
[2:09:28] so there has to be an unseen presence
[2:09:32] that knows my life and if he knows my
[2:09:36] life
[2:09:38] i know he's real
[2:09:41] and he's healed me
[2:09:46] now brother branham liking that same
[2:09:48] thing now listen
[2:09:49] you're not a prophet maybe you're not
[2:09:52] gifted in the same way
[2:09:56] but he likened it to when you get lost
[2:09:58] in the spirit
[2:10:02] he said when you're praising god it's
[2:10:04] your voice
[2:10:06] and when you get lost in the spirit
[2:10:07] praise and god see what i mean
[2:10:09] and if i would you try to use one speck
[2:10:11] of my own thoughts it'd be wrong
[2:10:14] i must have been fully on the holy
[2:10:16] spirit on the angel of god
[2:10:18] therefore i can only speak as he speaks
[2:10:20] and he can only speak if you believe it
[2:10:24] amen come on and he equates it and when
[2:10:28] you're praising god
[2:10:29] and you get lost in the spirit and begin
[2:10:32] things just begin to flow out of your
[2:10:33] mouth
[2:10:34] amen he said it's the holy spirit taking
[2:10:38] your voice
[2:10:42] amen it happens when you preach maybe
[2:10:45] you have never preached
[2:10:46] but i have and when the anointing comes
[2:10:49] and
[2:10:49] it begins to strike you begin to say
[2:10:51] things you never thought of saying
[2:10:54] revelations even come amen as if it just
[2:10:57] begins to flow from the holy ghost
[2:11:00] when god begins to take over your your
[2:11:03] vocal cords
[2:11:04] and it'll even discern hearts
[2:11:10] it'll say things to you that that only
[2:11:14] listen and confirm the word to you
[2:11:18] amen confirm the word are you with you
[2:11:21] amen it can happen there just in a
[2:11:24] little consultation
[2:11:25] sitting with a young lady and their
[2:11:28] words just come out
[2:11:29] that confirms to her the very thing
[2:11:33] that has been told to her already
[2:11:43] i believe there's a church that can
[2:11:44] praise god get lost in the spirit
[2:11:47] become the voice of the angel
[2:11:52] come on church this this man was
[2:11:55] different from oral roberts
[2:11:57] different from jack cole because
[2:12:00] every service the angel came
[2:12:05] and he would say i can do nothing till
[2:12:08] he comes
[2:12:10] you know i'm waiting on something you
[2:12:12] can tell i'm stalling here
[2:12:15] i'm waiting on him to go here he
[2:12:19] that's is amen
[2:12:25] i can't know none of you how could i do
[2:12:27] anything i can it's him
[2:12:29] and i can't do it even when he comes
[2:12:32] unless your faith operates it
[2:12:34] it isn't me i can't see vision unless
[2:12:36] your faith that does it
[2:12:38] see somebody's got to believe the report
[2:12:40] he said god's will by
[2:12:42] divine gift only thing that i i do is
[2:12:45] just keep healing myself and
[2:12:46] as i get myself completely yielded to
[2:12:48] the holy spirit
[2:12:49] then he starts talking it's not me he's
[2:12:52] using my voice but it's not me
[2:12:54] it's him now
[2:12:57] you know again this this was true even
[2:13:00] to john on the isle of patmos
[2:13:03] there the an angel came
[2:13:06] to john and revealed to john things that
[2:13:10] must sure
[2:13:11] shortly come to pass amen do you know
[2:13:14] why because
[2:13:15] john had a holy spirit filled heart
[2:13:19] now let me break something to you
[2:13:20] brother branham said angelic beings
[2:13:23] associate together so if you've got a
[2:13:27] holy spirit heart
[2:13:28] come on that the holy spirit the angel
[2:13:31] of god can reveal himself to you
[2:13:33] he can reveal healing deliverance he can
[2:13:36] reveal to you
[2:13:38] and many situations in your life and
[2:13:40] tell you exactly what to do
[2:13:43] because the angelic beings associate
[2:13:46] together he can come and appear in the
[2:13:49] church service
[2:13:52] hallelujah and faith could not heart
[2:13:54] somebody believe the report
[2:13:56] and somebody healed jump out of their
[2:13:58] pew right around the building
[2:14:00] killed by the glory of god why
[2:14:05] because angelic beings associate
[2:14:10] together
[2:14:16] i mean he's got the holy spirit today
[2:14:18] you are a welcome place for angels
[2:14:22] to associate with you don't need
[2:14:25] facebook
[2:14:33] if you got the holy spirit in you then
[2:14:35] you're a candidate
[2:14:37] for association with the unseen world
[2:14:40] and the supernatural
[2:14:42] no wonder people can't believe in those
[2:14:44] things they never come in contact
[2:14:46] they have got nothing in here to believe
[2:14:48] with
[2:14:49] but when the holy spirit comes into the
[2:14:51] heart quickly
[2:14:52] he becomes a twofold bend
[2:14:55] can you think of that a twofold bend
[2:14:57] amen
[2:14:58] one of the earth to die
[2:15:02] that's his flesh and one of heaven to
[2:15:05] live amen
[2:15:08] that's what we can say i can't die
[2:15:12] amen the body might can but i can't
[2:15:16] amen because the moment i pass this veil
[2:15:18] i'll be right in the realms of the
[2:15:20] supernatural
[2:15:23] as i tell many of them that are crossing
[2:15:25] over and i'm stepped by their bedside
[2:15:27] you know in a little bit you know it's
[2:15:29] going to get dark around you and then
[2:15:31] you'll see a light just head toward the
[2:15:34] light
[2:15:36] as you walk in that light it'll just get
[2:15:37] brighter and brighter and you'll open up
[2:15:39] until where it's full
[2:15:40] light full daylight and the next thing
[2:15:42] you'll see is a panoramic
[2:15:44] a wide open field just full of light and
[2:15:47] beautiful
[2:15:48] things and people running to you
[2:15:52] saying my precious brother i'm so glad
[2:15:54] you're here my precious sister
[2:16:02] in his body he's still subject to death
[2:16:04] but his soul is passed from death to
[2:16:06] life
[2:16:07] in his body he has earthly contact
[2:16:10] with his five senses in his spirit he
[2:16:13] has contact with god through the holy
[2:16:15] ghost
[2:16:16] and the angels of god visits them
[2:16:21] and the angel of god angels of god
[2:16:24] visits them and speaks with them
[2:16:26] and they are messengers what
[2:16:30] then you become a messenger that's why
[2:16:33] brother branham was a messenger you know
[2:16:34] they are
[2:16:35] angelic messengers from heaven but then
[2:16:38] when they come to you
[2:16:39] then you become an earthly messenger
[2:16:43] do you know every son and daughter of
[2:16:45] god is a messenger of god
[2:16:48] just as much as that angel stood there
[2:16:51] in front of abraham wrapped
[2:16:53] in human come on human body
[2:16:57] that he had spoke out from the dust and
[2:16:59] whipped together there with the 16
[2:17:01] elements or whatever it was
[2:17:03] and rolled it together and stepped into
[2:17:05] a man and here come
[2:17:06] the angels and they stepped in the ones
[2:17:08] he created come on
[2:17:10] and three men when they got in their
[2:17:12] body they got hungry
[2:17:15] amen they appear to abraham for a little
[2:17:17] visitation
[2:17:19] and because they've got to enlighten
[2:17:22] abraham
[2:17:23] they're going to enlighten him about the
[2:17:25] end time
[2:17:26] sodom is going to burn but uh but will
[2:17:29] you save a church out of that
[2:17:31] what about my loved ones that are out
[2:17:33] there what about that lot
[2:17:35] oh they don't believe exactly what we
[2:17:37] believe and they went down to sodom but
[2:17:39] oh
[2:17:40] if i can find i will not leave
[2:17:44] one righteous one there i'll pull your
[2:17:47] loved ones out
[2:17:49] even though they gotta go through the
[2:17:50] tribulation i'm not leaving or hooked
[2:17:54] behind
[2:17:56] hallelujah remember
[2:17:59] for you abraham i'm going to reveal to
[2:18:01] you the mysteries
[2:18:03] i'm going to change your body amen
[2:18:06] you're going to bring forth the promised
[2:18:08] son oh you've had churches before you've
[2:18:11] had an hagar
[2:18:12] that gave forth the son he was not the
[2:18:14] heir of the promise and abraham
[2:18:16] in isaac shall my seed be called
[2:18:20] amen because he was the child of the
[2:18:24] promise
[2:18:29] we've had movements come up and
[2:18:31] movements come up in little ishmael
[2:18:32] movements and
[2:18:33] you know hagar gives birth and you know
[2:18:37] denominations gives birth to another
[2:18:39] wild man
[2:18:40] another eastmere light who won't be
[2:18:44] subject to the word yet god uses them
[2:18:46] for a time yet there's a purpose for
[2:18:48] them
[2:18:49] is somebody with me amen but finally the
[2:18:52] child of the promise comes
[2:18:57] and i don't care how barren this church
[2:18:59] has been how long she's been barren
[2:19:03] amen how old she is how long it's all
[2:19:05] dried up
[2:19:07] how long it's been since the spirit
[2:19:09] moved it doesn't really matter
[2:19:11] how old she is is there anything too
[2:19:14] hard for the lord
[2:19:17] he'll come amen in his power and his
[2:19:20] glory to start awakening in faith
[2:19:22] in that seat of abraham sarah suffering
[2:19:25] for the child
[2:19:28] it's going to bring forth the promised
[2:19:30] son
[2:19:33] but i'm changing her i'm causing her to
[2:19:36] believe first
[2:19:38] yeah she's believed what abraham said
[2:19:40] yes he believed it was far abram
[2:19:42] yeah jesus can do anything
[2:19:47] but now she's starting to believe
[2:19:51] all things are possible to them that
[2:19:54] believe
[2:19:58] notice
[2:20:01] he's in contact with his five senses in
[2:20:03] his spirit
[2:20:04] he has contact with god to the holy
[2:20:06] ghost
[2:20:08] the angels of god visits them speaks
[2:20:10] with them they're messengers
[2:20:12] sent from god to reveal and to bring
[2:20:14] messages from god to the individual
[2:20:17] he's out to get the first things out
[2:20:20] first
[2:20:22] notice you've got to seek first the
[2:20:23] kingdom of god and his righteousness
[2:20:27] you've got to live want to just kind of
[2:20:30] put this to you
[2:20:31] you've got to live where you're
[2:20:32] conscious of the unseen world
[2:20:37] amen so you you you realize you know
[2:20:42] that that somebody can live that way
[2:20:46] just like we live today with a cell
[2:20:48] phone and
[2:20:49] we're conscious of another world
[2:20:52] and where conscience i can contact
[2:20:54] anywhere around the globe and just
[2:20:57] just milliseconds
[2:21:00] amen the unseen world
[2:21:04] through the unseen world now but we're
[2:21:06] conscious right now
[2:21:08] amen this message makes us conscious of
[2:21:10] another world
[2:21:12] i remember when you walk out here and
[2:21:14] you get in your car
[2:21:15] angels take positions beside you
[2:21:18] remember when you walk through that
[2:21:20] toward that man that's
[2:21:21] kind of unlovely and not a nice person
[2:21:23] the holy spirit's standing
[2:21:25] right above you and angels all around
[2:21:27] you
[2:21:28] the bible said the angels of god encamp
[2:21:31] about those
[2:21:33] amen they don't go back to heaven amen
[2:21:35] they camp right there
[2:21:38] amen you're worried you're you're
[2:21:39] worried because uh
[2:21:41] uh the the enemy is out to get you
[2:21:43] you're worried because
[2:21:45] uh uh unscrupulous unrighteous men
[2:21:48] trying to take
[2:21:49] even the little pennies that you got
[2:21:51] here on the earth
[2:21:52] through some lawsuits let me tell you
[2:21:54] there's angels all around you
[2:21:57] you're not in this by yourself you're
[2:21:59] not alone
[2:22:00] you're not the year i walk through the
[2:22:03] valley of the shadow of death
[2:22:04] i have no fear no evil but thou art with
[2:22:07] me
[2:22:09] hallelujah i'm comforted by your rod and
[2:22:11] your stuff
[2:22:12] because it keeps guiding me well i'm
[2:22:14] gonna get over this way to the edge or
[2:22:16] that way
[2:22:17] he's pushing me this way and he pushes
[2:22:19] me that way angels all around me
[2:22:21] keeping me from harm
[2:22:29] they don't go back to heaven they camp
[2:22:31] there they're sent on missions to watch
[2:22:33] you through life's
[2:22:34] journey
[2:22:38] why can't you see him your veil that's
[2:22:41] right
[2:22:42] you have something called the veil of
[2:22:44] the flesh
[2:22:46] now adam was made with an
[2:22:49] immortal body he could see
[2:22:52] he could see the angelic presence he
[2:22:54] could see
[2:22:55] the the pillar of fire as he come down
[2:22:58] to kiss him good night and say did my
[2:23:01] children have a good day today in eden
[2:23:05] you could see god face to face but when
[2:23:08] sin entered in and he turned from
[2:23:12] immortal to mortal then
[2:23:15] this supernatural world became blocked
[2:23:18] off to him
[2:23:20] no longer could he control the earth by
[2:23:22] the supernatural he would have to do it
[2:23:24] by the sweat of the brow
[2:23:27] and and so what keeps us from seeing god
[2:23:30] face to face is this chur in this church
[2:23:32] this morning
[2:23:33] is the veil it keeps us from seeing
[2:23:37] angels in their position and when the
[2:23:40] angels
[2:23:41] are there standing by their seats
[2:23:44] by your seat if you could just see
[2:23:47] in the in the supernatural realm there
[2:23:50] are
[2:23:50] as i said they're angels they're
[2:23:52] dropping to you handfuls on purpose
[2:23:55] ministering angels ministered spirits
[2:23:58] lifting up your spirit
[2:24:00] causing you to you know lift up that
[2:24:03] heavy depression off of you
[2:24:05] causing you to believe amen
[2:24:08] and then it's there but it's the veil
[2:24:10] this flesh is what keeps us from seeing
[2:24:13] him
[2:24:14] and we're you know we're sons and
[2:24:15] daughters of god we're in the presence
[2:24:17] of god the angels are camped about us
[2:24:19] and they i said i'll never leave you or
[2:24:22] forsake you
[2:24:23] is that right listen church this is what
[2:24:28] he said
[2:24:30] he said i'll never leave you or forsake
[2:24:33] you
[2:24:35] that's his promise
[2:24:39] do you believe that let me look here for
[2:24:41] a scripture just for a moment
[2:24:43] i'll tell you what i i'm almost positive
[2:24:46] i know where i'm at
[2:24:47] here but hang on just for a minute yeah

[2:25:03] let's look at hebrews 13
[2:25:07] 5. let the way you live be without
[2:25:10] covetousness

[2:25:18] you know quit desiring to be have all
[2:25:20] the luxuries of laodicea
[2:25:25] amen and be content with such things as
[2:25:28] you have
[2:25:29] for he has said i will never
[2:25:33] leave thee nor forsake thee
[2:25:37] amen so that you
[2:25:40] may boldly say the lord is my helper
[2:25:45] and i will not fear what men
[2:25:48] shall do to me
[2:25:52] amen oh hallelujah next verse
[2:25:55] amen remember them which have the rule
[2:25:57] over you that have spoken to you the
[2:25:58] word of god whose faith
[2:25:59] follow consider the end of their
[2:26:01] conversation the way they live
[2:26:04] jesus christ is saying yesterday today
[2:26:07] and forever

[2:26:30] the holy ghost
[2:26:32] he sealed you to the day of redemption
[2:26:34] he does not come
[2:26:36] and go he does not get breathed away
[2:26:38] from you

[2:26:42] leave you or forsake you
[2:26:48] hallelujah i'll be there with you all
[2:26:51] the way to the end but it's our flesh
[2:26:55] that keeps us out of his presence
[2:26:58] amen remember the boy
[2:27:02] the servant with elijah or elijah rather
[2:27:05] when he when they were all surrounded by
[2:27:08] this
[2:27:09] by the syrians down in samaria
[2:27:13] and you know the the young
[2:27:16] young servant looked out and said man
[2:27:18] all i can see
[2:27:20] is the syrians all around where where
[2:27:23] there's no way out
[2:27:24] that may be the way you see it this
[2:27:26] morning you see yourself surrounded
[2:27:30] amen but i may feel like i'm surrounded
[2:27:34] but i'm surrounded by you
[2:27:40] come on come on
[2:27:44] i may feel like i'm surrounded i may
[2:27:47] feel like there's
[2:27:47] devils everywhere i may feel like i've
[2:27:50] been satan's even in the last
[2:27:52] the worst things that there was i may
[2:27:54] feel surrounded but i'm surrounded by
[2:27:56] you

[2:28:00] that he's here jesus christ to say
[2:28:04] yesterday today and forever never read
[2:28:07] it
[2:28:10] and the veil dropped out for the old
[2:28:12] boy's eyes
[2:28:13] he saw horses of fire and chariots of
[2:28:16] fire
[2:28:20] see the veil dropped
[2:28:23] amen the veil keeps us from doing what
[2:28:25] we really want to do
[2:28:27] you battle it out with your own flesh
[2:28:34] god came in veil in the veil of flesh
[2:28:38] and there calvary rent the veil into and
[2:28:40] god became god again
[2:28:43] and he raised up from that veil that
[2:28:45] he'd hid himself in
[2:28:46] somebody with me amen
[2:28:50] and remember remember that day
[2:28:53] whenever it'll be we don't know when
[2:28:55] it'll be
[2:28:57] but at the coming of the lord jesus now
[2:29:00] his coming
[2:29:01] might be today for you
[2:29:05] he may not wait till we all go he may
[2:29:08] come for you today before you get out of
[2:29:10] this building
[2:29:11] or as you're driving down the road you
[2:29:14] don't know when he's coming
[2:29:15] but he's coming
[2:29:19] amen and at the coming of jesus the lord
[2:29:22] jesus the veil will be dropped
[2:29:25] amen and and you you will walk
[2:29:28] and talk with him your lord and savior
[2:29:31] and then you know there
[2:29:32] when he takes the throne of david will
[2:29:33] live for him forever
[2:29:36] in a perfected veil hallelujah but this
[2:29:39] veil has sin in it
[2:29:42] i don't ever think that we're perfected
[2:29:44] we're perfect in this
[2:29:46] amen but i tell you what we do have
[2:29:48] something going on
[2:29:50] we have the holy spirit in here that
[2:29:52] keeps bringing this thing in check
[2:29:55] subject to the word of god and every
[2:29:57] time we would do wrong
[2:29:59] he brings to the word to our remembrance
[2:30:02] brings us to repentance and straightens
[2:30:04] up our lives he don't let us live and
[2:30:06] sin
[2:30:07] amen aren't you glad for that
[2:30:10] amen hallelujah now the bible speaks of
[2:30:14] heavenly places
[2:30:16] that's what this is is where angels are
[2:30:19] all around
[2:30:21] where that the presence of god is it's
[2:30:23] heavenly places
[2:30:25] it's places that you cannot know about
[2:30:27] till you're born again
[2:30:31] beast nature cannot know about this amen
[2:30:34] but when you're born again you're
[2:30:36] you become a candidate for association
[2:30:40] with an unseen world and angels become
[2:30:43] visible they begin to appear to you
[2:30:46] and then you begin to feel their
[2:30:48] presence you know your cognitive
[2:30:50] there's something going on here hey man
[2:30:53] you walk into a church like this and you
[2:30:55] say
[2:30:56] this is heavenly places and it just
[2:30:58] feels different from anywhere else

[2:51:23] brother branham in his sermon he was
[2:51:26] looked out at an elderly lady that was
[2:51:28] all crippled up
[2:51:30] he said they were she was the last one
[2:51:33] of the wheelchairs
[2:51:35] that had not been emptied out in the
[2:51:37] building
[2:51:38] and she was weeping and crying she's
[2:51:41] sitting there
[2:51:42] uh night after night weeping and crying
[2:51:46] and he said i see what her trouble was
[2:51:49] and and what started it
[2:51:53] but instead of her accepting enough
[2:51:56] faith
[2:51:57] she would think oh i'm too bad
[2:52:03] and it would move up again now i want
[2:52:06] you to notice
[2:52:07] the angel of the lord would come
[2:52:09] actually come down upon her
[2:52:11] produce a vision but then she would
[2:52:15] think
[2:52:15] oh but i'm too bad
[2:52:19] now remember i told you it's a war
[2:52:24] but he's got to get you to believe him
[2:52:28] on somebody because when you believe the

[2:53:09] [Music]
[2:53:11] amen you could be sitting there i'm
[2:53:14] unworthy
[2:53:15] maybe that's what you meant i'm too bad
[2:53:18] i'm unworthy i'm not good enough
[2:53:21] amen it isn't that at all it's given on

[2:53:33] i'm too bad
[2:53:35] i'm not good enough what was it it was
[2:53:37] pushing
[2:53:38] the angel back away from her
[2:53:43] but in the last moments after brother
[2:53:46] branham was
[2:53:47] through through with the prayer lines
[2:53:50] walking out of the church
[2:53:52] hey man that there's there he spoke to
[2:53:55] her two or three times
[2:53:56] trying to get her faith up to a level to
[2:53:58] believe and she just couldn't get it
[2:54:01] she just couldn't get it but all of a
[2:54:03] sudden there
[2:54:05] she felt something that was real warm
[2:54:08] and tingling go through her body
[2:54:10] and she got him out of her wheelchair
[2:54:13] and started pushing her wheelchair
[2:54:17] around the building time you start
[2:54:20] pushing that cancer
[2:54:22] stop pushing that signal that puts in
[2:54:24] that habit
[2:54:25] raise them out of that and start pushing
[2:54:28] it
[2:54:29] it puts me around mostly i've been
[2:54:32] pushed around in this whole chair

[2:54:36] pushing it's time to turn
[2:54:38] and start pushing back we're not going
[2:54:40] to let the devil have any
[2:54:42] leeway witness anymore we're sons and
[2:54:45] daughters of god

[2:54:50] the holy ghost
[2:54:51] in this turn and i feel the people
[2:54:53] pushing back
[2:54:55] pushing back and pushing back
[2:55:06] he said the angels of god are camped
[2:55:08] about those that fear
[2:55:10] there's a dark shadow between you and
[2:55:12] and that angel that wants to help you
[2:55:15] bring in the message of christ that's
[2:55:17] unbelief
[2:55:19] now if you can get that unbelief that
[2:55:21] dark shadow

[2:55:54] whatever god wants to say
[2:55:55] it's not me i'm not a healer it's god
[2:55:57] and your individual
[2:55:59] faith in god you shut up your compassion
[2:56:01] and say you don't believe it and nothing
[2:56:03] will happen
[2:56:04] but open your heart and say god i'm
[2:56:06] ready to believe it then watch what
