[18:46] we want to remember to pray for a uh
[18:50] longtime friend of the [music] Patton
[18:51] family, Mary Lynn Mcola.
[18:55] She's being transferred to a facility
[18:57] because she has a issue with the vein
[19:00] that drains the blood from the brain
[19:02] back into the heart and causing a lot of
[19:04] pressure buildup on her brain.
[19:07] be having to have a see a surgeon in the
[19:09] next couple of weeks. So Lord, they ask
[19:12] that we remember that need in prayer
[19:14] this morning. Also, sister Sherry
[19:15] Wilkerson's [music] brother-in-law
[19:17] passed away. Want to remember the family
[19:21] this morning as well during this [music]
[19:22] time. So we have a prayer request from
[19:25] brother Nathan Ball asked to remember
[19:27] his daughter McKagen that's pregnant
[19:29] with twins. [music]
[19:31] one of the twins is not developing
[19:34] properly. And
[19:36] so ask that we remember that need. And
[19:39] if you have a need you want to lift to
[19:41] the Lord, I reminded of a time [music]
[19:43] that we were told that our daughter
[19:46] wasn't developing properly. We had
[19:48] prayer and
[19:50] we had a healthy child [music] right
[19:51] after that. Amen. I believe God's in the
[19:55] business of doing miracles this morning.
[19:57] Whatever your need is, if [music] you
[19:58] want to lift it to him as we pray
[19:59] together, Brother Joe, if you would
[20:01] come. Amen. [music] Let's turn to the
[20:03] Lord in prayer.
[20:07] Amen.
[20:09] Let's just bow [music] our heads and
[20:10] take these knees to him this morning.
[20:12] Approach them as if this is your your
[20:15] daughter with twins. [music]
[20:18] One of them struggling
[20:20] struggling to develop and to form. take
[20:24] it as your brother-in-law who just
[20:25] [music] recently passed away and or a
[20:28] family friend in need. Father, we we
[20:31] come before your [music] throne this
[20:32] morning, Lord.
[20:35] What a privileged people we are.
[20:39] Lord, that in this hour, Lord, the the
[20:42] waning hours of the Gentile [music]
[20:43] dispensation, yet you have called the
[20:45] people,
[20:47] Lord, a people by your name, Lord,
[20:49] they've taken on not the name of [music]
[20:51] some church or some idea, but Lord,
[20:53] they've taken on your name, your
[20:56] character, God, they've taken on your
[20:58] reputation, [music]
[20:59] Father. And and we're here today, God,
[21:01] because a word has been spoken over us.
[21:03] And Father, how thankful we are, Lord.
[21:06] when we look back at maybe the
[21:07] difficulties that we face in life and
[21:10] Satan will sidet [music] track us Lord
[21:12] and will get us from seeing who we
[21:15] really are Lord putting [music]
[21:16] obstacles in front of us strongholds
[21:19] around us God trying to keep us from
[21:21] reaching our potential that idea [music]
[21:23] that thought that you saw us before the
[21:25] foundation but God we come before you
[21:28] today Lord as sons and daughters of God
[21:31] recognizing our position in the body
[21:33] recognizing our place in the headship
[21:35] Lord of Christ and the economy of God.
[21:37] And Lord, we just come. We want to say,
[21:39] Lord, that we love you. We're thankful,
[21:41] Father, for this word that you've given
[21:42] us in this hour. We're thankful, Lord,
[21:44] that our hearts have been turned. We're
[21:46] thankful, Lord God, that we we have a
[21:48] desire to come to the house of God,
[21:50] [music] Lord, to worship the one true
[21:51] and living God, Lord. We're thankful,
[21:53] Lord, that we no longer desire the
[21:55] things of the world, but we desire the
[21:57] heavenly things, Father. And we're just
[21:58] asking today, [music]
[21:59] Lord, that there would be a mighty
[22:01] rushing wind of your presence just come
[22:02] and sweep in this place this morning,
[22:05] God, and just fill our hearts to
[22:06] gladness, to overflowing this morning,
[22:08] Lord. Though we may be trial on every
[22:10] side, that we may, Lord, be going
[22:12] through trials and situations, but God,
[22:14] maybe even in our trial, may we worship
[22:16] you and Lord, dig deep this morning, per
[22:19] se, and just offer up a sacrifice of
[22:22] praise to you, Father, for you're worthy
[22:24] to receive honor. You're worthy to
[22:26] receive praise. You're worthy to receive
[22:28] our our worship. And God, we want to be
[22:30] a people that are mindful of who you are
[22:33] and what your needs are, Father. And not
[22:35] just our needs, not just our desires,
[22:38] not just our wants, but God, your
[22:40] desires. A desire to be worshiped, a
[22:43] desire to be loved, a desire to be cared
[22:46] for. And Lord, we want to honor you by
[22:49] giving you [music] what you deserve this
[22:51] morning. And Lord, may we just love you
[22:54] with our worship, love you with our our
[22:57] amens and our hallelujah and our lifting
[23:00] of our hands and the responding to your
[23:02] word today. And and Father, as your
[23:05] children, we petition you on behalf of
[23:07] these needs that were mentioned. Lord,
[23:09] we pray you'd comfort the family of this
[23:11] one who's passed on. Father, bring them
[23:14] together and bring them peace and
[23:15] comfort, Lord. And Lord, Brother Sam,
[23:17] the family friend there in the need. May
[23:19] you just go to [music] that need and
[23:21] minister, Lord. And Lord, we pray for
[23:24] McCagan and these unborn [music]
[23:25] children, Lord, that are in her womb at
[23:28] this time. We pray for that one in
[23:29] particular, Lord, that's underdeveloped,
[23:32] Father. May you just go to her even now,
[23:35] Father. And may you just breathe the
[23:37] breath of life into that womb, Lord. And
[23:40] may these babies come out healthy
[23:42] [music] and strong, Father. Lord, we're
[23:44] not looking at the doctor's report.
[23:46] We're not looking at the sonograms and
[23:48] alter sounds. [music] We're looking to
[23:50] the word of promise. You said whatsoever
[23:52] things that you desire when you pray.
[23:54] [music] If you can believe, then you can
[23:56] have whatsoever it is that you desire.
[23:58] Lord, we're believers this morning. And
[24:00] we're petitioning your throne to do what
[24:02] the doctors can't do. Father, may you
[24:05] move now, Lord, on behalf of McCagan and
[24:08] these babies. And Lord, [music] we pray
[24:10] for brother Aaron and brother Timothy as
[24:11] their way this morning ministering. God,
[24:14] use them for your glory, Lord. May they
[24:16] be an extension, an arm of Evenite
[24:18] Tabernacle, Father. And and may wherever
[24:22] they are, Father, may you just use them
[24:23] in a a mighty way this morning. Now,
[24:26] bless our [music] pastor, Lord, as he
[24:28] would come forth today and bring the
[24:30] word, Lord. You see what you've laid
[24:31] upon his heart. [music] May you speak
[24:33] expressly, Lord, to every heart, every
[24:36] life, every need, and every situation.
[24:38] We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[24:45] And you [singing] are the one that

[52:39] &gt;&gt; His mercy endures
[52:42] &gt;&gt; to all generations
[52:44] &gt;&gt; and they're new every morning
[52:45] &gt;&gt; and they're right here for us today.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; If you got a need in your life today, a
[52:50] loved one you're praying about a
[52:52] situation, [music]
[52:53] why don't you just lift a hand to God
[52:55] and say, Lord, remember me this morning.
[52:58] Father, thou knowest every need, every
[53:00] desire of every heart. [music] And we
[53:02] just pray, dear God, today you who looks
[53:06] down from above and then comes and walks
[53:09] among us by your Holy Spirit, will you
[53:12] come and discern every heart
[53:15] and see what the need is that is there
[53:17] [music] behind that hand because it's
[53:20] never lifted in vain. [music] You know,
[53:23] every motion, every move, every desire
[53:26] of the heart. So we pray that you'll
[53:28] just manifest your glory today by
[53:32] bringing deliverance in thy holy name.
[53:35] Lord, will you just speak to hearts
[53:36] [music] and lives and reveal yourself as
[53:39] only you can. And as we minister today,
[53:43] Lord, may we not minister [music]
[53:45] intellectually.
[53:47] But Lord, may the Holy Spirit speak
[53:50] today. May the anointing of the Holy
[53:53] Spirit take over your servant. I'm here.
[53:56] I'm yours reporting for duty asking now
[53:59] Lord that you would speak as we will
[54:02] start Lord with your holy sacred [music]
[54:04] word and then we will begin to speak and
[54:08] we will move into the uncction of the
[54:11] spirit. I pray Lord the audience will
[54:14] move into the same uncction and will
[54:17] hear what the spirit is saying and Lord
[54:19] you'll deal with their hearts and as we
[54:22] minister Father may you bring victory in
[54:24] lives in Jesus name.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[54:29] Amen. God bless you. Thank you. If
[54:31] you'll turn with me to second Timothy
[54:34] 1 verse 7. We'll read from there this
[54:37] morning and then one more scripture
[54:40] before you're seated which will be found
[54:42] in 2 Corinthians chapter 10.
[54:46] But I just want to read this one portion
[54:49] this morning. For God has not given us a
[54:52] spirit of fear,
[54:54] &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and a sound
[54:57] mind.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; And then turn with me to 2 Corinthians
[55:01] chap 10:3.
[55:04] For though we walk in the flesh, we do
[55:07] not war after the flesh. For the weapons
[55:10] of our warfare are not carnal, but
[55:13] mighty through God to the pulling down
[55:15] of strongholds,
[55:17] casting down imaginations and every high
[55:20] thing that exaltth itself against the
[55:22] knowledge of God, and bringing into
[55:25] captivity every thought. Somebody say
[55:27] every thought.
[55:29] to the obedience of Christ
[55:32] &gt;&gt; and having in readiness to revenge all
[55:35] disobedience when your obedience is
[55:38] fulfilled. And of course our obedience
[55:40] given us by the word here is to cast
[55:44] down imaginations
[55:46] &gt;&gt; and every high thing. And then when we
[55:49] do that, then he will revenge all
[55:53] disobedience,
[55:55] every enemy that has tried to come and
[55:58] fortify something in your life. God
[56:00] bless you. Can be seated. I'd like you
[56:03] to turn to to um
[56:09] to put your heart together with mine
[56:11] today as we look into this subject. I
[56:13] want to speak on pulling down
[56:16] strongholds.
[56:18] We are here in a in a very vicious fight
[56:23] &gt;&gt; and we face heartache and trouble and
[56:25] despair. You know, some of you uh like
[56:29] our sister Sher Wilkerson got bad news
[56:31] about a brother-in-law today who was um
[56:34] he just had a recent heart attack and
[56:36] went into surgery today and died on the
[56:39] operating table.
[56:41] And this is a life where you know time
[56:44] of of in where we're living in where
[56:47] that there's all kinds of difficulties,
[56:50] situations and problems because we live
[56:53] in an imperfect world.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; And we are born in bodies that decay. I
[56:59] don't know if you noticed yours, but
[57:01] mine is decaying. And I'm for sure if
[57:05] you know that as as you reach a certain
[57:08] age, from there on, as you reach a peak,
[57:10] you just start eating the same things
[57:12] and drinking the same water and doing
[57:14] the same exercise, but you get weaker
[57:16] and weaker
[57:18] &gt;&gt; because we're born in bodies that decay.
[57:20] And and to minds that wrestle with sin,
[57:24] yet our souls are saved. Yes.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; I I I want you to get this in your heart
[57:29] today about your salvation which is
[57:33] complete which is real
[57:35] &gt;&gt; and and even if you have not yet
[57:38] received the Holy Spirit and which is
[57:40] the seal into the day of redemption but
[57:42] you have just done that very first work
[57:45] where that you have repented of your
[57:48] sins and you have accepted God's pardon
[57:51] for sin. Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; You know, you have you're like a a a
[57:55] baby in the womb and and any father or
[58:00] any parent is concerned even about the
[58:03] child in the womb.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; And so you are very loved already by the
[58:08] father even though you might not have
[58:10] come to a full birth as yet
[58:12] &gt;&gt; and you're valuable to the kingdom of
[58:14] God. Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even told us that. He
[58:17] said in question answers on the Holy
[58:19] Ghost, he said, "You have to protect the
[58:22] church from the hard bruises of Satan
[58:25] because she is pregnant. She's expecting
[58:28] children that are in that that
[58:30] justification, that's conception,
[58:32] sanctification, which is growth stages.
[58:35] And though they have not yet been fully
[58:37] birthed, um they, you know, they are
[58:41] still a child in the womb. And you must
[58:44] protect the church from the hard bruises
[58:46] of Satan.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; So I'm trying to tell you, no matter
[58:49] where you are in your Christian walk
[58:51] today, you're valuable to God.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And and you and you might ask, why if
[58:58] I'm saved, why is there a battle in my
[59:01] mind? Now, I touched on this in my
[59:04] closing ser uh statements on my last
[59:07] service that I was here a couple of
[59:09] weeks ago. And and I want to pick this
[59:13] up today because many are questioned,
[59:15] you know, even how could I even have the
[59:17] Holy Ghost? And yet I I fight and deal
[59:21] with, you know, terrible thoughts,
[59:24] sometimes vile thoughts, ugly thoughts,
[59:27] sometimes filthy thoughts that come in
[59:29] my mind.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; And and I just want to say it's because
[59:34] my friend, the mind is the battlefield.
[59:38] And of course, those are weapons that he
[59:41] has to to come against you to try to get
[59:45] you to walk in defeat. And and of
[59:48] course, the mind being the battleground,
[59:50] it's the very ground where Satan then
[59:52] tries to build his strongholds.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; And Paul tells us that Satan can build
[59:59] strongholds in our mind, but we are to
[1:00:01] tear them down. Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Now, let's get it clear that that the
[1:00:05] devil cannot touch a redeemed soul. So,
[1:00:09] he attacks the mind.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; And if he can't possess you, he will
[1:00:13] oppress you.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. If he can't
[1:00:17] possess you, he will oppress you.
[1:00:21] And and and brother Brandham told us in
[1:00:23] the message future home he said Satan
[1:00:25] can tempt but he cannot get a bornagain
[1:00:28] Christian
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; for God for the foundation of the world
[1:00:32] foraw him and he sent Jesus to redeem
[1:00:35] him and the blood speaks for them. SO
[1:00:37] HOW CAN HE sin when it can't be seen
[1:00:40] even by God?
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; SO SATAN KNOWS HE CAN'T PLUCK YOU OUT OF
[1:00:46] GOD'S HAND. So he WORKS TO WEAR YOU DOWN
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; TO CLOUD YOUR JOY TO WEAKEN your
[1:00:53] confidence TO MAKE YOU DOUBT WHO YOU ARE
[1:00:56] IN CHRIST.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; AND SINCE HE CAN'T TOUCH YOUR SOUL, HE
[1:01:00] FOCUS HIS his assaults on your thoughts
[1:01:03] to keep you from living IN VICTORY.
[1:01:06] BECAUSE SATAN KNOWS THAT YOUR PATHWAY to
[1:01:08] God, to his power is faith. And faith is
[1:01:12] the only language that heaven responds
[1:01:15] to. Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; So the Bible said in Hebrews 1 11:6, HE
[1:01:20] SAID, "FOR WITHOUT FAITH IT IS
[1:01:22] IMPOSSIBLE to please him. For he that
[1:01:25] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:01:28] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:01:31] diligently seek him."
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; SO GOD SIMPLY CANNOT RESPOND TO
[1:01:35] UNBELIEF.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; You see, it breaks the law of his own
[1:01:39] nature. So the devil, if he can get you
[1:01:44] to waver, TO DOUBT GOD'S PROMISE, he he
[1:01:47] knows YOU CAN'T RECEIVE THE VICTORY that
[1:01:50] belongs to you. And it's my desire to
[1:01:53] see every one of you walk in victory.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that, of course, if you
[1:01:58] waver, they you're like a double-minded
[1:02:00] man. You know that you're and you're
[1:02:02] unstable in all your ways. And the Bible
[1:02:04] said, "Let not that man think he shall
[1:02:06] receive anything from the Lord." that
[1:02:09] when you come to God, YOU MUST BELIEVE
[1:02:11] that he is. You must have a steadfast
[1:02:13] faith, not a wavering faith, you know,
[1:02:16] not a not a something reaching out and
[1:02:18] then withdrawing and reaching out, oh
[1:02:20] well, I'm not worthy. We're reaching out
[1:02:21] and say, I'm not good enough. I'm
[1:02:23] reaching out and and then withdrawing.
[1:02:25] But you must be steady in your approach
[1:02:28] to God. You see, you see THAT THAT'S THE
[1:02:32] STRATEGY OF HELL THOUGH is to sever your
[1:02:35] line of communication.
[1:02:37] To make it seem as though heaven is
[1:02:40] silent and to fill your MIND WITH SO
[1:02:43] MUCH NOISE and confusion that you can't
[1:02:47] hear the still small voice.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW GOD SPEAKS IN MANY WAY. GOD
[1:02:52] WILL SPEAK to you from the preaching of
[1:02:54] the word this morning. He'll speak to
[1:02:55] you through recorded sermons. He will he
[1:02:58] will speak to you through written text
[1:03:00] of of men of God OF MANY MANY THOUSANDS
[1:03:03] of years ago. Whether it was Moses or
[1:03:06] Enoch or whether it be of Jeremiah or
[1:03:09] Isaiah or or Ezekiel or Daniel or or
[1:03:12] some in the New Testament like the
[1:03:14] Apostle Paul. You see, God is speaking.
[1:03:17] He'll you can hear his voice in nature.
[1:03:19] You can hear his voice in in other
[1:03:21] children of God as they speak to you.
[1:03:24] There's been A MANY OF TIMES, YOU KNOW,
[1:03:26] GOD SPOKE TO ME WHILE I WAS JUST HAVING
[1:03:28] A PHONE conversation and something was
[1:03:31] said and God quenched something in my
[1:03:33] heart. You see, but again, you you see
[1:03:37] the strategy of hell is to sever your
[1:03:40] line of communication to make it seem
[1:03:44] like heaven is silent. AND AND I DOUBT I
[1:03:47] REALLY DOUBT THAT God
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; um truly withdraws and and gives you the
[1:03:54] silent treatment. Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; I I DON'T I DON'T JUST THINK THAT HE'S a
[1:03:58] moody God
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; that that you know, he just kind of
[1:04:02] gives you the silent treatment, but I I
[1:04:05] wonder really if it's really God being
[1:04:08] silent or I wonder if your mind is being
[1:04:11] filled with so much noise,
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; with so much confusion of what's going
[1:04:16] on. YOU SEE, IF HE CAN CLOUD YOU WITH
[1:04:19] DEPRESSION,
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; THEN THE SUNSHINE OF GOD'S GOODNESS
[1:04:23] CAN'T WARM your heart.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; AND THOUGH YOUR SOUL IS REDEEMED, IT
[1:04:28] BECOMES LIKE A SEED THAT'S buried in
[1:04:31] frozen ground, is alive, but is
[1:04:34] unfruitful.
[1:04:35] YOU SEE THE BIBLE SAID THAT THOSE ARE
[1:04:39] THESE ARE THEY THAT ARE sown among
[1:04:42] thorns such as hear the word and the
[1:04:44] cares of this world and the WORRIES OF
[1:04:47] LIFE CHOKE THE WORD and it becomes
[1:04:50] unfruitful.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE IF I COULD JUST GET YOU THIS
[1:04:54] MORNING TO DOUBT YOUR DOUBTS.
[1:04:57] IF I COULD GET YOU TO TAKE AWAY EVERY
[1:04:59] LIE, EVERY FEAR, EVERY REASONING, AND
[1:05:03] CAST IT DOWN IN THE NAME OF JESUS. IF I
[1:05:06] COULD GET YOU TO DEMOLISH ARGUMENTS AND
[1:05:10] EVERY DEMONIC CLAIM THAT SETS ITSELF UP
[1:05:13] AGAINST THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AND TO TAKE
[1:05:16] CAPTIVE EVERY THOUGHT TO MAKE IT
[1:05:18] OBEDIENT TO CHRIST, THEN YOU WOULD SEE
[1:05:21] THAT THE BATTLE WAS NEVER YOURS TO BEGIN
[1:05:24] WITH. IT WAS THE IT BELONGS TO THE LORD.
[1:05:27] IF IF YOU'LL JUST STAND UP ON HIS WORD,
[1:05:29] IF YOU'LL JUST HOLD FAST TO YOUR
[1:05:31] CONFESSION OF FAITH AND LET THE HOLY
[1:05:34] GHOST WASH OVER YOU AND AND IT'LL DO
[1:05:37] LIKE 1 JOHN 1 AND7 SAYS, THE BLOOD OF
[1:05:41] JESUS CHRIST, HIS SON, CLEANSES YOU from
[1:05:45] all sin.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you something. Maybe we
[1:05:50] don't sin like smoke, drink, lack,
[1:05:52] fornicate, adulterize, and all of that,
[1:05:55] but every one of us falls short.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And if EVERY ONE OF US, ANY ONE OF US,
[1:06:00] IF ME OR ANY PROPHET, any priest, any
[1:06:03] any great man, WHOEVER YOU WOULD THINK,
[1:06:06] NAME HIM THROUGH THE BIBLE, WOULD STAND
[1:06:07] BEFORE GOD, he would be blemished and
[1:06:10] sinful.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Because their angels are even black in
[1:06:15] his presence.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; He is so holy. AMEN.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S WHY WE ALWAYS NEED AN
[1:06:21] INTERCESSOR.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; WE ALWAYS NEED THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:06:24] CHRIST, HIS SON, BECAUSE WE MAKE WE MAKE
[1:06:27] ENOUGH MISTAKES in one day to be wiped
[1:06:30] off the earth forever.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; But his mercy and his goodness hold us.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT BLOOD NOT ONLY REDEEMS YOUR
[1:06:37] SOUL, IT GIVES YOU VICTORY IN YOUR MIND.
[1:06:41] And that's WHAT I WANT TO HELP YOU WITH
[1:06:42] TODAY IS, YOU KNOW, you you SAY, "WELL,
[1:06:44] BROTHER TIM, I I I I just I'm I'M IN
[1:06:48] SUCH A BATTLE. I I I I THINK I I BELIEVE
[1:06:52] I I KNOW THAT GOD TOUCHED MY HEART, AND
[1:06:55] I I know that I've been changed, but I I
[1:06:58] I I'm HAVING THIS HORRIBLE BATTLE
[1:07:00] WITHIN." BUT YOU SEE, WHEN YOU DOUBT
[1:07:03] YOUR DOUBTS AND WHEN YOU believe his
[1:07:06] word, THEN THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED
[1:07:09] UP JESUS FROM THE DEAD RISES UP ON THE
[1:07:12] INSIDE OF YOU TO SILENCE THE ACCUSER
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; AND TO RESTORE YOUR PEACE.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO. WE WANT
[1:07:20] TO SILENCE THE ACCUSER. WE WANT TO
[1:07:23] SILENCE THAT ONE THAT SAYS YOU'RE
[1:07:26] UNWORTHY.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; That you're NOT WORTH LOVING. THAT THAT
[1:07:31] JUST SAYS PUNISH YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU
[1:07:34] FEEL SO WORTHLESS.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; TRUE. You are unworthy.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; You were a miserable, wretched sinner.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. But the blood has
[1:07:47] redeemed you
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; and has restored you to sunship.
[1:07:52] The Bible SAID, AS I QUOTED AGAIN, IN
[1:07:54] WHOM WE HAVE REDEMPTION THROUGH HIS
[1:07:56] BLOOD,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; THE FORGIVENESS of sins.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, WHAT MANNER OF LOVE THE FATHER
[1:08:02] HATH BESTOWED UPON US THAT WE SHOULD BE
[1:08:04] CALLED THE SONS OF GOD.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SILENCE THAT ACCUSER THAT SAYS
[1:08:09] YOU'RE NOT WORTH LOVING. YOU SHUT UP
[1:08:12] THAT DEVIL THAT SAYS that and and THAT
[1:08:16] THAT ACCUSES AND YOU SAY, "BUT GOD SO
[1:08:20] LOVED ME." I WANT YOU TO GET IT. I WANT
[1:08:22] YOU TO MAKE THIS PERSONAL. WE WE TAKE
[1:08:24] JOHN 3:16 AND SAY, "WELL, GOD SO LOVED
[1:08:27] THE WORLD." I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT THIS
[1:08:28] MORNING AND SAY, "GOD SO LOVED ME
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR ME."
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; SO I AM WORTH SOMETHING.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; HE GAVE HIMSELF FOR ME.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; There was an old man. There was a story
[1:08:45] of an old man, you know, he was poor and
[1:08:48] seemed to be a forgotten old soul and
[1:08:50] nobody cared about him and he just eaked
[1:08:53] out a living, maybe picking up aluminum
[1:08:55] cans or whatever. And one day, you know,
[1:08:58] picking out up his cans and trying to
[1:09:01] trying to make a few cents, he somebody
[1:09:05] come by and was reckless and hit him and
[1:09:08] be, you know, broke him all up in an
[1:09:10] accident. The ambulance takes him into
[1:09:13] the hospital and in the hospital there
[1:09:16] where uh he is laying there seemed like
[1:09:19] dead almost lifeless and you know there
[1:09:24] was the doctors got to talking and they
[1:09:26] looked at him said this old man you know
[1:09:28] he don't have any life he ain't got any
[1:09:31] money he ain't worth anything you know
[1:09:34] we we're not even going to spend our
[1:09:36] time patching this old man up you know
[1:09:38] he's all broken and such a mess he ain't
[1:09:41] ain't worth fixing. And he wasn't as
[1:09:43] dead as what they thought.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; And he SPOKE UP AND SAID, "BUT I AM
[1:09:47] WORTH SOMETHING."
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST GAVE HIS OWN BLOOD FOR ME.
[1:09:51] I AM WORTH SOMETHING.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; AND I I WANT YOU TO REALIZE THAT JUST
[1:09:56] BECAUSE THE WORLD BECAUSE OTHERS LOOK AT
[1:09:59] YOU AND SAY, "YOU'RE A BROKEN PIECE OF
[1:10:02] HUMANITY AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH INVESTING
[1:10:04] IN AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH ANYTHING." JESUS
[1:10:08] DECLARED YOUR WORTH
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; AND HE SO LOVED YOU WHEN YOU WERE
[1:10:13] UNLOVABLE
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; WHEN NOBODY CARED ABOUT YOU. OH, NOBODY
[1:10:18] CARES FOR ME LIKE JESUS.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAID OVER HIS
[1:10:24] MASTERPIECES IN IN ZEPHANIAH 3:17, HE
[1:10:28] REJOICES OVER YOU WITH SINGING.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; OH, when God looks at you, it makes him
[1:10:34] sing. There's some gladness in his
[1:10:35] heart. And the Bible said these words,
[1:10:38] "If God did not spare his own son, how
[1:10:41] shall he not with him freely give me all
[1:10:44] things?"
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; SO I AM BELOVED. I AM LOST. I'M ADOPTED.
[1:10:50] I'M ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SILENCE THAT ACCUSER THAT URGES
[1:10:57] YOU TO HARM YOURSELF AND TO INFLICT PAIN
[1:10:59] ON YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU FEEL so
[1:11:01] worthless. I want to just tell you, you
[1:11:05] don't have to do that. That's right.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus already bore your punishment.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for your transgressions.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; He was bruised for your iniquities.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; He bore your punishment already. You
[1:11:17] don't have to carry what the cross has
[1:11:20] counseledled.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; SO YOU UNBBURDEN YOURSELF. LET IT GO.
[1:11:24] DROP IT AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS. AND
[1:11:26] LET AS THE BIBLE SAID COLOSSIANS 3:15,
[1:11:29] LET THE THE PEACE OF CHRIST RULE IN YOUR
[1:11:33] HEART AS HE SAID IN PHILIPPIANS 2:5,
[1:11:35] "LET THE MIND THAT WAS IN CHRIST BE IN
[1:11:38] YOU." I'M TELLING YOU THIS MORNING, LIFT
[1:11:40] YOUR HEAD, CHILD OF GOD. YOU'RE NOT
[1:11:43] LOSING YOUR MIND. YOU'RE WINNING THE
[1:11:45] WAR.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FAITH STILL WORKS.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; THE WORD STILL PREVAILS. THE BLOOD STILL
[1:11:53] SPEAKS.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND VICTORY IS YOURS.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; So cast DOWN THOSE IMAGINATIONS, CAST
[1:12:00] DOWN EVERY HIGH THING THAT EXALTS ITSELF
[1:12:03] against the knowledge of God and bring
[1:12:05] to captivity every thought
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; to the obedience of Christ.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; What are these high things? These high
[1:12:12] things are mental fortresses.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; You know, Satan builds them to block
[1:12:19] revelation, to choke faith, to keep a
[1:12:22] believer from walking in full victory.
[1:12:24] All right.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; These high things are not high because
[1:12:28] God made them so, though.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; They're high because we've allowed Satan
[1:12:32] to exalt them in our mind.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; We've allowed them to make something
[1:12:36] bigger
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; than what they are.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; They may be big problems, BUT THEY AIN'T
[1:12:43] AS BIG as your God.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; You see, you know, THEY THEY ARE
[1:12:48] IMAGINATIONS. THEY ARE ARGUMENTS. THEIR
[1:12:50] DECEPTIVE THOUGHTS THAT SETS THEMSELVES
[1:12:54] UP AS rulers taking the place that ONLY
[1:12:57] BELONGS TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID, "LET THE PEACE OF GOD
[1:13:02] RULE."
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Rule your mind.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE AGAIN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
[1:13:10] TO ALLOW OH YEAH. YOUR SOUL IS SAVED,
[1:13:13] BUT IN YOUR MIND,
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; you're going TO HAVE TO LET HIM RULE
[1:13:17] YOUR MIND.
[1:13:20] AMEN.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; NOW, a stronghold is not a random
[1:13:24] thought.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; It's a fortress.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; It's a mental It's a mental citadel that
[1:13:30] is built by repeated lies.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Now, some of us, we deal with random
[1:13:36] thoughts. They just come randomly and
[1:13:38] they're gone and we dismiss them and
[1:13:40] whatever. But these are these
[1:13:42] strongholds are repeated lies,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; fears, reasoning that stand in defiance
[1:13:49] of God's truth.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan will construct these
[1:13:53] strongholds ONE BRICK OF DOUBT AT A
[1:13:56] TIME,
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; AND HE WHISPERS LIES UNTIL THEY BECOME
[1:14:02] TOWERS OF OF FALSE REASONING THAT
[1:14:05] DOMINATE YOUR THOUGHT LIFE. AND THE
[1:14:07] BIBLE said as a man thinkketh in his
[1:14:09] heart so is he. So you know that so
[1:14:12] AGAIN IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT
[1:14:15] YOURSELF YOU CAN NEVER REACH YOUR FULL
[1:14:17] POTENTIAL AND BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'RE
[1:14:19] THINKING in your heart
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; and you're thinking well I might as well
[1:14:23] GIVE IN. YOU'RE THINKING I'LL NEVER
[1:14:26] OVERCOME THIS. YET GOD SAID YOU WILL.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE THE BIBLE SAID THE CARNAL MIND
[1:14:33] is a is enmity. THAT MEANS IS OPPOSED
[1:14:37] AND IS HOSTILE TO GOD. AND AND SO THESE
[1:14:40] STRONGHOLDS ARE MENTAL. THEY ARE MENTAL
[1:14:43] FORTRESSES OF UNBELIEF,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; ARGUMENTS, EXCUSES,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, INTERNAL DIALOGUES THAT REASON
[1:14:52] AGAINST THE WORD. THEY'RE THEY'RE INNER
[1:14:54] VOICES THAT SAY, "GOD won't forgive me.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; I crossed the line."
[1:15:03] Well, why are you here?
[1:15:09] Come on.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; If you'd crossed your line, you would
[1:15:12] want nothing to do with God.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; So, none of you under the sound of my
[1:15:17] voice right now is has crossed the line.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; SO, GOD WON'T FORGIVE ME. THAT'S A LIE.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; TH THIS SICKNESS WILL NEVER LEAVE.
[1:15:29] OH, how often we hear that I I'LL NEVER
[1:15:34] CHANGE. I I'LL NEVER get over this. THAT
[1:15:38] THE PROMISE IS NOT FOR ME. MY MY
[1:15:41] CHILDREN WILL NEVER BE SAVED.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; You You see, EACH ONE OF THESE THOUGHTS
[1:15:47] ARE IMAGINATIONS THERE. THEY'RE A FALSE
[1:15:50] CREATION OF THE MIND
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; THAT DARES
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; THAT DARES TO CONTRADICT WHAT GOD HAS
[1:15:57] ALREADY DECLARED.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, you're Come on, church. AMEN.
[1:16:04] YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; AND YOUR OFFSPRING WITH YOU.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Is that the word?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BELIEVE THAT THOU IN THY HOUSE
[1:16:13] SHALL BE SAVED.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE GREAT
[1:16:19] IN THE LAND.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT GOD'S WORD SAYS.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THE ENEMY WANTS TO CONTRADICT
[1:16:26] WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY SAID. WELL, I'M
[1:16:29] SICK AND I'LL NEVER GET OVER THIS. BUT
[1:16:30] HE WAS WOUNDED FOR YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS
[1:16:33] AND HE WAS BRUISED FOR YOUR INIQUITY AND
[1:16:36] WITH HIS STRIPES YOU'RE ALREADY HEALED.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; You see, these are the high things
[1:16:43] because you let them occupy the highest
[1:16:46] place. the throne of your thoughts.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; That God, you should be inviting Christ
[1:16:53] to sit upon. Lord, not just, you know,
[1:16:57] sit on the throne of my soul, but sit
[1:17:00] there on the throne of my mind.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Give me a renewed mind. Let the peace of
[1:17:05] God rain.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Rule.
[1:17:12] You see,
[1:17:14] these are high things cuz you let them
[1:17:16] occupy the highest place.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; It's the place only Christ belongs.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; The battles in the mind.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SAID, "OUR WARFARE IS NOT
[1:17:26] CARNAL. We we we do not WE WE DON'T
[1:17:30] FIGHT FLESH AND BLOOD, BUT MIGHTY
[1:17:33] THROUGH GOD TO THE PULLING DOWN OF
[1:17:35] STRONGHOLDS."
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU, YOU CAN'T
[1:17:38] REASON A DEMON AWAY. YOU CANNOT COUNSEL
[1:17:42] REBELLION OUT OF THE FLESH.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; These things must be demolished
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; BY THE SPIRITUAL POWER OF GOD'S WORD IN
[1:17:49] HIS SPIRIT.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; You see, THE THE WORD OF GOD, THE BIBLE
[1:17:54] SAID, IS ALIVE. IT IS QUICK OR ALIVE AND
[1:17:57] POWERFUL. IT'S SHARPER THAN ANY
[1:17:58] TWO-EDGED SWORD. AND IT WASN'T GIVEN TO
[1:18:01] YOU FOR DECORATION. IT WAS GIVEN TO YOU
[1:18:02] TO FIGHT WITH.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; AND WHERE YOUR FIGHT IS GOING TO BE IS
[1:18:06] IN THE BATTLE OF YOUR MIND. YOUR SOUL IS
[1:18:08] ALREADY WON.
[1:18:10] AMEN.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN FEAR RISES, FAITH MUST SPEAK.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN LIES WHISPER, TRUTH MUST SHOUT
[1:18:20] LOUDER.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; EVERY THOUGHT MUST MUST BOW TO THE
[1:18:25] AUTHORITY OF THE WORD. AND EVERY
[1:18:27] IMAGINATION MUST BE BROUGHT CAPTIVE to
[1:18:29] the obedience of Christ.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends.
[1:18:37] Even angels use divine authority.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. IN THE BOOK OF JUDE chapter nine
[1:18:45] or verse 9 RATHER, MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL
[1:18:47] when contended with the devil dared not
[1:18:50] to bring against him a accusation but
[1:18:52] said the Lord rebuke YOU. THIS IS A
[1:18:55] PICTURE OF A POWERFUL CONFLICT
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; BETWEEN ANGELIC FORCES.
[1:19:02] AND AND EVEN MICHAEL THE MIGHTY
[1:19:03] ARCHANGEL DIDN'T RELY ON HIS OWN
[1:19:06] STRENGTH AND WISDOM. HE DIDN'T ARGUE
[1:19:08] WITH SATAN.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; If anybody home,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT ABOUT ARGUING WITH THE
[1:19:15] DEVIL.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE DIDN'T TRY TO OUTWIT HIM.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; HE STOOD UNDER DIVINE AUTHORITY AND
[1:19:21] [screaming] INVOKED THE POWER OF THE
[1:19:23] GOD'S WORD AND SAID, "THE LORD REBUKE
[1:19:26] YOU."
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; YES, he did. If an archangel's got to
[1:19:30] appeal to the Lord's authority to
[1:19:33] overcome Satan, how much more do we have
[1:19:36] to depend on God's word,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; on the blood of Jesus,
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; the power of the Holy Ghost to bring
[1:19:43] down the strongholds of our mind.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Now, the battle begins and ends in the
[1:19:49] mind.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And victory COMES WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THE
[1:19:55] LIE. THE BIBLE SAID, "YOU SHALL KNOW THE
[1:19:57] TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU
[1:19:59] FREE."
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU RECOGNIZE THE LIE.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BY WHAT? KNOWING WHAT GOD'S WORD
[1:20:09] SAY.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; AND THEN LETTING THAT AND THE AND THEN
[1:20:12] THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE. AND THEN
[1:20:14] OF COURSE VICTORY COMES WHEN WE REPLACE
[1:20:17] IT WITH TRUTH.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let this mind be in you that was
[1:20:22] in Christ Jesus. Victory comes when we
[1:20:25] reinforce it with the word.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Thy word have I hid my heart
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; that I not sin against thee.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; And this is where we sin.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HEAR BROTHER BRANDHAM PRAY and
[1:20:38] he says, "Lord, forgive me of my sins."
[1:20:41] He not talking about, "I I went out with
[1:20:43] a woman today.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; I committed adultery. I I I went on a
[1:20:47] binge and drank too much.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; I I smoked a cigarette. I I I I I
[1:20:53] stole some money.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; That's not what he was saying.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But this is where we sin.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; We when we don't take positions of or
[1:21:03] possession of the strongholds and
[1:21:05] destroy them.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; We We're not called [snorts] to manage
[1:21:09] these strongholds. Amen.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; WE ARE CALLED TO DEMOLISH THEM,
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; TO TEAR DOWN EVERY LIE THAT EXALTS
[1:21:16] ITSELF ABOVE GOD'S PROMISES AND REBUILD
[1:21:19] OUR THINKING AROUND HIS TRUTH.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; IN FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE TAKE THE
[1:21:24] TRUTH OF GOD AND WE BUILD A FORTRESS
[1:21:26] WITH IT.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:29] So as he said in in Romans 12 and2, be
[1:21:33] not conformed to this world, but be
[1:21:35] transformed, be changed by the renewing
[1:21:39] of the mind.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; A renewed MIND IS A BATTLEFIELD
[1:21:42] RECLAIMED.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO TODAY. MANY
[1:21:46] OF YOU NEED TO RECLAIM your mind.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; YOUR SOUL ISN'T LOST,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE LOSING YOUR MIND.
[1:21:56] YOU'RE LETTING SATAN, YOU'RE LETTING
[1:21:57] WRONG THOUGHTS RULE IT.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; You You see, AND A RENEWED MIND IS A
[1:22:03] BATTLEFIELD RECLAIMED. IT IS NO LONGER
[1:22:06] THE DEVIL'S FORTRESS.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; IT BECOMES THE DWELLING PLACE OF CHRIST.
[1:22:11] HIS PEACE REIGNS.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; THE THOUGHTS THAT ONCE IMPRISONED YOU
[1:22:16] ARE CHANGED AND AND ARE SANCTIFIED. AND
[1:22:19] THEN THEY BECOME THE VERY STONES WHICH
[1:22:22] GOD BUILDS HIS TEMPLE OF PEACE WITHIN
[1:22:24] YOU. SO I'M TELLING YOU THIS MORNING,
[1:22:26] TAKE UP YOUR WEAPONS OF WARFARE.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; TAKE THE WORD, TAKE THE BLOOD, TAKE THE
[1:22:32] NAME OF JESUS AND PULL DOWN EVERYTHING
[1:22:34] THAT DARES EXALT ITSELF AGAINST GOD'S
[1:22:37] WORD.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. If anything,
[1:22:42] if anything, these lies ought to make
[1:22:45] you mad.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; They ought to anger you
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; like David. You know, how dare HOW DARE
[1:22:56] THIS GIANT oppose the living God.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; LET FAITH RISE. LET TRUTH REIGN. LET THE
[1:23:02] SPIRIT OF CHRIST ESTABLISH PEACE WHERE
[1:23:05] ONCE CHAOS RULED.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; AS HE SAID, THE WEAPONS OF OUR WARFARE
[1:23:10] ARE MIGHTY THROUGH GOD.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; THE THE WEAPONS WE FIGHT WITH ARE NOT
[1:23:14] WEAPONS OF THE WORLD. THEY HAVE DIVINE
[1:23:17] POWER TO DEMOLISH STRONGHOLDS.
[1:23:20] WE DEMOLISH ARGUMENTS AND AND EVERY
[1:23:22] PRETENSION THAT SETS ITSELF UP AGAINST
[1:23:24] THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD. AND WE TAKE EVERY
[1:23:27] CAPTIVE EVERY THOUGHT
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; TO MAKE IT OBEDIENT TO CHRIST.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:34] You see,
[1:23:36] fear
[1:23:37] is faith turned inside out.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; It's the opposite of faith.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Fear is the opposite of faith.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. It believes, now get this.
[1:23:52] It believes more in Satan's power to
[1:23:55] harm than God's power to deliver.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; SO LET YOUR FAITH triumph over your
[1:24:05] fear. AMEN.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID IN in 2 Timothy 1:7, "FOR
[1:24:10] GOD HATH NOT GIVEN US THE SPIRIT OF
[1:24:13] FEAR,
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; but of power, OF LOVE, AND A SOUND MIND,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; WELL, BROTHER TIM, I'M OLD AND I I FEEL
[1:24:24] LIKE I'M LOSING MY MIND." WELL, YOU
[1:24:27] KNOW, DON'T FEAR.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. IF YOU GET YOUR MIND BACK ON
[1:24:34] HIM, HE'LL KEEP YOU IN PERFECT PEACE.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU GOT THIS.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU'RE ABLE.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FEAR IS A LIAR.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; LET ME CALL IT WHAT IT IS. IT'S A
[1:24:45] POISONOUS SNAKE. IT'LL SLITHER RIGHT
[1:24:48] LIKE A SERPENT THROUGH THE QUARTERS OF
[1:24:50] YOUR MIND AND IT HISSES. It's poisonous
[1:24:53] doubts.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; It says, "You won't make it.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; You're not worthy. You failed too many
[1:25:00] times.
[1:25:02] you'll miss the rapture.
[1:25:04] The Lord will come and you'll be left
[1:25:06] behind.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; But the voice of faith rises UP AND
[1:25:12] ANSWERS BACK with a with A HOLY
[1:25:14] AUTHORITY. THE LORD IS MY LIGHT
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; AND MY SALVATION. WHOM SHALL I FEAR?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THAT PSALMS 27:1, THAT'S A
[1:25:23] RAPTURE SCRIPTURE. IT'S THE SCRIPTURE
[1:25:26] BROTHER BRADAM USED WHEN WHEN SPEAKING
[1:25:28] ON THE RAPTURE AND HOW FITTING IT IS.
[1:25:30] THE FIRST DECLARATION IS NOT ABOUT
[1:25:32] DARKNESS OR DREAD BUT ABOUT LIGHT AND
[1:25:36] SALVATION.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE LORD IS MY LIGHT.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; HE SHINES A PATH BEFORE US. HE HE OPENS
[1:25:44] THE WAY THROUGH DIMENSIONS. HE BREAKS
[1:25:46] THROUGH THE BARRIER AND THE VEIL BETWEEN
[1:25:50] TIME AND ETERNITY. HE'S THE GATEWAY TO
[1:25:53] HEAVEN.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE IS NOT OUR ESCAPE ROUTE.
[1:25:56] IT'S GOD'S ENTRANCE PATH. IS FOR CHRIST
[1:25:59] IS COMING FOR HIS OWN.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; AND THE RAPTURE IS ABOUT SALVATION, NOT
[1:26:05] ABOUT FEAR.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING LEFT BEHIND. IT'S
[1:26:11] BEING ABOUT TAKING UP.
[1:26:14] [cheering]
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. I'M LEAVING HERE.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT CHRIST FAILING TO DELIVER
[1:26:20] HIS BRIDE. IS ABOUT THE TRIUMPH OF HIS
[1:26:23] REDEEMING POWER. SO WHY SHOULD WE FEAR
[1:26:27] OF BEING LEFT BEHIND WHEN HE'S THE LEVER
[1:26:29] OF OUR SOUL?
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE'S COMING TO GET US AND TAKE
[1:26:33] US OUT OF HERE.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE TREMBLE AT HIS APPEARING WHEN
[1:26:37] IT'S coming is the final act of
[1:26:39] redemption?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a scripture and I want
[1:26:45] you to nail it down in your heart. I
[1:26:47] want you to build a fortress with it. I
[1:26:50] want you to use it as a foundation. 1
[1:26:52] Thessalonians 5:9. For God hath not
[1:26:56] appointed us to wrath,
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; BUT TO OBTAIN SALVATION BY our Lord
[1:27:02] Jesus Christ.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ETERNAL WORD THAT CAN'T
[1:27:08] FAIL. HE HAVE NOT APPOINTED YOU TO
[1:27:10] WRATH.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; HE HAVE NOT APPOINTED YOU TO THE
[1:27:13] TRIBULATION.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; HE HAS APPOINTED YOU TO OBTAIN
[1:27:16] [screaming]
[1:27:16] SALVATION.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR DESTINY. THIS IS YOUR
[1:27:20] CALLING. YES, SIR.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; To receive this deliverance,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; let not your hearts be troubled.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; I will come again and receive you unto
[1:27:31] myself
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; that where I am, there you may be also.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Can't you see it? The rapture isn't
[1:27:39] about fear. It's about faith.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Faith that our redeemer is faithful.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Not faith that we've done everything
[1:27:49] right.
[1:27:51] That's right.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; FAITH THEN THAT OUR REDEEMER IS
[1:27:55] FAITHFUL.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; FAITH THAT HE THAT BEGAN A GOOD WORK
[1:27:59] WILL FINISH IT.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; FAITH THAT HE'S NOT COMING TO REJECT US
[1:28:04] BUT COMING TO FINISH TO REDEMPTION, NOT
[1:28:06] TO CONDEMN, BUT TO CLAIM WHAT HE'S
[1:28:08] PURCHASED WITH HIS OWN BLOOD.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID IN COLOSSIANS 3 AND 4,
[1:28:13] WHEN CHRIST WHO IS OUR LIFE SHALL
[1:28:15] APPEAR, THEN YE SHALL YE ALSO APPEAR
[1:28:18] WITH HIM IN GLORY.
[1:28:20] WHEN HE APPEARS, WE'RE GOING TO APPEAR
[1:28:22] WITH HIM.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT ME.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; NOT I'M GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; NO, HE SAID WHEN HE APPEARS THAT WE WILL
[1:28:31] APPEAR WITH HIM IN GLORY.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Titus 2:13 said, "Look into that blessed
[1:28:37] hope than the glorious appearing of our
[1:28:39] the great God and our Savior Jesus
[1:28:42] Christ."
[1:28:43] Oh, but brother Tim, I I I I'm afraid
[1:28:48] some kind of impurity might keep me from
[1:28:51] the rapture.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at the next verse.
[1:28:54] Titus 2:14.
[1:28:57] Who gave himself for us
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; that HE MIGHT REDEEM US from
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; all iniquity
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; AND PURIFY ON HIMSELF A PECULIAR PEOPLE,
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; ZEALOUS OF GOOD WORKS. AMEN.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; SO HE GAVE HIMSELF WHAT? THAT HE MIGHT
[1:29:17] REDEEM US
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; FROM ALL INIQUITY.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; SO THE RAPTURE IS NOT A THREAT. IT'S A
[1:29:24] PROMISE. [screaming]
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A CURSE TO THE BRIDE. IS IT'S
[1:29:28] HER CORONATION DAY.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S THE MOMENT WHEN WE SHALL BE
[1:29:32] CAUGHT UP TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; WHERE FAITH THEN BECOMES SIGHT. RIGHT?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; What we believed and longed for all our
[1:29:41] life becomes real
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; and we realize realization.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; So the Lord is my light and my
[1:29:47] salvation. Whom shall I FEAR?
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; SO WHY FEAR THE DAWN WHEN YOU'RE A CHILD
[1:29:52] OF THE LIGHT? WHY WHY FEAR THE TRUMPET
[1:29:55] WHEN IT'S CALLING YOU HOME?
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not fearing the trumpet.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M WAITING FOR THAT TRUMP. I'M
[1:30:03] ANTIFIED. IT'S MY [screaming] CALL HOME.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:07] SO LET EVERY SHADOWED DOUBT FADE AWAY IN
[1:30:09] THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS PROMISE AND AND
[1:30:12] LET EVERY TREMBLING HEART RISE WITH
[1:30:14] CONFIDENCE AND SAY, "THE LORD IS MY
[1:30:16] SALVATION.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; WHOM SHALL I FEAR? I WILL NOT BE
[1:30:20] AFRAID."
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; For the same light that called you out
[1:30:23] of the darkness is the light that will
[1:30:25] lift you up out of this world.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; How many's been reading in the newspaper
[1:30:30] lately or the news? We hardly nobody
[1:30:33] reads newspaper. But anyway, you know,
[1:30:36] but you're you're reading you're hearing
[1:30:38] about in the news about all of the the
[1:30:41] increase of thousands upon thousands of
[1:30:45] of of sightings of unidentified flying
[1:30:48] objects.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Mystic lights, mystic signs, mystic
[1:30:53] things.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; I understand even Tucker Car Carlson
[1:30:57] made a statement the other day. I
[1:30:59] thought I I was told it was at Charlie
[1:31:01] Kirk's funeral where he spoke and he
[1:31:04] said, "I believe them are angels that
[1:31:07] are coming into this dimension."
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Well, he's right.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "You see these
[1:31:12] little pockets going to the air and they
[1:31:15] call them saucers and so forth. Well, we
[1:31:18] better leave that alone." But you hear
[1:31:19] of all these people coming up missing
[1:31:21] and you say, "You don't hear from them.
[1:31:23] They're standing there and they're not
[1:31:24] there." And he said, "That's the way the
[1:31:26] rapture is going to be." Yes,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:31:29] ONE OF THEM WILL DROP DOWN and this
[1:31:31] celestial terrestrial body will take on
[1:31:33] the celestial body and there'll be hair
[1:31:35] hide HAIR OR BONES LEFT. IT'LL BE
[1:31:38] TRANSFORMED IN A MOMENT OF TIME DROPPING
[1:31:40] RIGHT OUT OF SPACE AND TAKING home that.
[1:31:43] AND WE SEE ALL THIS GOING ON IN THE
[1:31:45] PENTAGON wondering about these lights
[1:31:47] and mystic lights and everything that
[1:31:49] they're seeing in the sky and had one
[1:31:51] here in the paper Jeffersonville this
[1:31:53] week and and so forth. A mystic light.
[1:31:56] Oh, they don't know what it is. But
[1:31:58] listen, little children, it's going to
[1:32:01] pick you up one of these days.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, I WONDER IF ALL OF THESE
[1:32:10] sightings
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; aren't AREN'T THE REDEEMED SOULS OF
[1:32:14] THEOPHANES
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; ABOUT TO BREAK INTO this dimension?
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I wonder.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; I WONDER. OH, BROTHER, WHERE ARE WE NOW?
[1:32:25] YOU YOU SAY, "OH, I DON'T THINK SO."
[1:32:27] WELL, LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIBLE.
[1:32:28] ELIJAH WAS TAKEN UP IN A WHIRLWIND IN A
[1:32:31] CHARIOT OF FIRE.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; An unidentified flying object.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS TAKEN UP IN a whirlwind and
[1:32:40] a CHARITY OF FIRE. THINK OF THAT. A
[1:32:41] WHIRLWIND AND A FIRE.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT INAUGURATED THE CHURCH.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; A RUSHING MIGHTY WIND
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; AND TONGUES OF FIRE.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:52] Let me ask you, what do you see the
[1:32:54] prophet describe of an angel coming? A
[1:32:57] light hung in the room.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; And out of that light stepped a man 6'
[1:33:04] tall, 200 lb.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And when he left, he walked back into
[1:33:08] that light
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; and went out. Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; And one day that light that you got in
[1:33:17] your heart
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; that baptized you with the Holy Ghost,
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; the fullness of it will come and spread
[1:33:23] over your body. And you'll step into
[1:33:25] that light
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; and be transformed in a moment, in a
[1:33:30] twinkling of an eye, be changed.
[1:33:34] And when that great morning comes, the
[1:33:36] one who's shown the path BEFORE YOU WILL
[1:33:39] OPEN THE HEAVEN ABOVE YOU AND SAY, "COME
[1:33:41] up higher. Your redemption is complete."
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; SO I WANT YOU TO SAY, LET THE VOICE OF
[1:33:47] FAITH RISE UP AND ANSWER BACK WITH A
[1:33:51] HOLY AUTHORITY. IF GOD BE FOR
[1:33:53] [screaming] US,
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; THEN WHO CAN BE AGAINST US?
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; So are you afraid of missing it? Then
[1:34:02] what weapon then what demon power what
[1:34:06] what demon power is able to hold you
[1:34:08] down when he said no weapon formed
[1:34:12] against you shall prosper.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; What can hold you down when you've
[1:34:17] already turned heavenly?
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "WHO IS
[1:34:24] THIS MELZDC?" WHEN WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE
[1:34:26] THE WORD OF GOD AS EAGLE FOOD, IT TURNS
[1:34:29] YOU HEAVENLY.
[1:34:31] AMEN. SO YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MISS
[1:34:33] IT. YOU'VE BEEN TURNED HEAVENLY. YOU'RE
[1:34:36] ALREADY AIMED IN THAT DIRECTION.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; CHILD OF GOD, FEAR DOESN'T COME FROM
[1:34:40] YOUR FATHER.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HIS SPIRIT WHISPERING THOSE
[1:34:43] DOUBTS. IT'S THE VOICE OF THE ENEMY
[1:34:46] TRYING TO DETHRONE YOUR CONFIDENCE IN
[1:34:48] CHRIST.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; You see, the spirit of God don't
[1:34:52] paralyze you with dread.
[1:34:55] He empowers you with faith and love
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; and a disciplined mind.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; The word there speaks of a sound mind.
[1:35:09] It means a disciplined mind.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; It's where you take those wrong
[1:35:14] thoughts. Any thought
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; contrary to God's word,
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; you take control of it.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You take authority over it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And because your mind is
[1:35:28] disciplined only to receive what God's
[1:35:30] word said,
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID. BUT MY MIND IS
[1:35:34] DISCIPLINED.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; TO BELIEVE ONE THING.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; GOD'S GOT CONTROL OF MY LIFE.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; SATAN CAN'T TAME ME TILL GOD'S THROUGH
[1:35:42] WITH ME.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NO MATTER WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY, HE
[1:35:46] DOESN'T HAVE THE LAST ANSWER.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; COME ON. HE'S NOT HE'S NOT THE FINAL
[1:35:50] ANSWER. HE'S NOT THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY.
[1:35:52] THERE'S A GREATER AUTHORITY.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A DISCIPLINED MIND TO BELIEVE
[1:35:57] WHAT GOD'S WORD SAID
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEN PERFECT LOVE CASTS OUT ALL
[1:36:04] FEAR
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; AND THE JUST THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL LIVE by
[1:36:12] faith.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; So faith is a life.
[1:36:21] I fear not today what the tomorrow may
[1:36:24] bring.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; If shadow or sunshine or rain,
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; the Lord I know ruleth or everything
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; and all of my weary is vain.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; What am I singing? Living by faith. Yes.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; You see, the just shall live by faith.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Faith speaks a different language.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS FEAR IN THE EYE AND AND IT
[1:36:54] DECLARES, "GREATER IS HE
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; THAT IS IN ME
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; THAN HE THAT'S IN THE WORLD."
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN JESUS SAID, "I AM THE
[1:37:02] RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE," HE WASN'T
[1:37:05] POINTING TO A DISTANT EVENT. HE WAS
[1:37:07] REVEALING A PRESENT REALITY.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. RESURRECTION LIFE WAS
[1:37:11] RIGHT THERE CLOTHED IN FLESH.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; RESURRECTION LIFE WAS STANDING THERE AND
[1:37:17] THAT SAME LIFE, THAT SAME LIFE, THE VERY
[1:37:20] SPIRIT THAT RAISED UP CHRIST FROM THE
[1:37:22] DEAD NOW DWELLS IN YOU.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; SO IF THE SPIRIT THAT RAISED UP JESUS
[1:37:27] FROM THE DEAD DWELLS IN YOU, HE THAT
[1:37:29] RAISED UP CHRIST FROM THE DEAD SHALL
[1:37:31] ALSO quicken
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; your mortal body.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; So we don't fear being left behind.
[1:37:39] We're part of the body he's coming for.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; We're the reason he's coming.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY GHOST THAT SITS ON THE
[1:37:50] THRONE of your heart is the very one
[1:37:53] that will lift you up in that glorious
[1:37:55] moment. The rapture cannot happen
[1:37:57] without the bride. And the BRIDE CANNOT
[1:38:00] LEAVE WITHOUT THE SPIRIT. And when THE
[1:38:02] SPIRIT LEAVES THE EARTH, HE'S TAKING YOU
[1:38:05] WITH HIM.
[1:38:06] SO YOU'RE NOT A CANDIDATE FOR FEAR.
[1:38:08] YOU'RE A VESSEL OF FAITH.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR RESURRECTION
[1:38:12] LIFE. YOU CARRIED IT WITHIN YOU.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; SO LET LET ME JUST TELL YOU, LET YOUR
[1:38:17] FAITH ROAR LOUDER THAN YOUR FEAR.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; LET THE WORD DROWN OUT THAT DOUBT.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE ENEMY HISSES, YOU WON'T
[1:38:26] MAKE IT. YOU STAND CAUGHT. AND YOU SAY,
[1:38:28] "I'M SEALED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT OF
[1:38:31] PROMISE." AND DEVIL, YOU'RE SEALED OUT.
[1:38:34] AMEN.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR IT'S CHRIST IN ME THAT'S THE
[1:38:37] HOPE OF GLORY.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; FOR THE LORD HIMSELF SHALL DESCEND FROM
[1:38:41] HEAVEN WITH A SHOUT, WITH A BAND. WE
[1:38:43] SHALL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER TO MEET THE
[1:38:45] LORD IN THE AIR.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; So fear says you're not enough.
[1:38:53] But faith says he's more than enough
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; and he lives in me.
[1:39:00] So don't allow the devil to build
[1:39:03] strongholds in your mind,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; but go to war.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6, he tells you, I I'VE
[1:39:12] DRESSED YOU FOR WAR,
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; A HELMET OF SALVATION,
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; A SHIELD OF FAITH, A SWORD OF THE
[1:39:19] SPIRIT, A BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:39:22] I'VE DRESSED YOU FOR WAR.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I I didn't dress you to uh you
[1:39:27] KNOW TO TO HANG ALL OF THAT UP THERE AND
[1:39:30] SAY LISTEN I'M A SOLDIER AND HERE IT IS
[1:39:33] ON MY WALL. YOU ARE TO DRESS IN IT
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; AND EVERY DAY YOU GO TO [screaming]
[1:39:37] BATTLE.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Amen.
[1:39:43] But let me just tell you
[1:39:46] strongholds
[1:39:48] don't mean you're not a child of God.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Satan can tempt
[1:39:54] But he cannot touch your redeemed soul.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to shout.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; You're sealed by the Holy Spirit of
[1:40:02] promise. Let me tell you clearly, the
[1:40:05] devil is sealed out and can never,
[1:40:07] never, never get in.
[1:40:11] [applause]
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. EPHESIANS 1:13. IN WHOM YOU ALSO
[1:40:19] TRUSTED AFTER YOU HEARD THE WORD OF
[1:40:21] TRUTH. HAVE YOU HEARD THE WORD OF TRUTH?
[1:40:23] HAVE YOU HEARD THE MESSAGE? HAVE YOU
[1:40:25] TRUSTED IN IT? IT'S THE GOSPEL OF YOUR
[1:40:27] SALVATION. AND WHOM AFTER YOU BELIEVE,
[1:40:29] YOU WERE sealed
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; with that Holy Spirit of promise.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; And that promise is I'm not leaving you.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Even when you're in your darkest trial,
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving you.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; You're not fighting alone.
[1:40:50] So when those dark thoughts come,
[1:40:53] don't mistake them as proof of defeat.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Those thoughts don't mean you're not
[1:41:00] saved.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; But they can rob you of your joy and
[1:41:03] your peace if you let them take root.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; They'll keep you they can't keep you out
[1:41:08] of heaven, but they'll keep you living
[1:41:10] under clouds of unbelief, defeated,
[1:41:13] discouraged. Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, I I
[1:41:18] I know you can't hardly believe it. You
[1:41:22] know, surely nobody goes through what I
[1:41:24] go through and nobody thinks what I
[1:41:26] think and nobody has the problems I
[1:41:28] have. And you know, it's like, oh, dear
[1:41:30] sister Kenny, one time she was a an old
[1:41:33] saint. I buried buried her in her 90s.
[1:41:37] She was in the early part of our church,
[1:41:39] but she want come one time to me and
[1:41:41] she, oh, brother Tim, you don't know
[1:41:43] what it is to go through a trial. You've
[1:41:46] never had a trial in your life,
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; these ain't trials. I don't want to know
[1:41:54] what one is,
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; you know. But but WE LOOK AT HOLY MEN
[1:42:00] and we think, "Oh, they they can never
[1:42:03] have a bad thought.
[1:42:05] They can never have something go through
[1:42:08] their mind that's impure or unworthy or
[1:42:10] unholy or filthy.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; You know, listen, I heard the testimony
[1:42:19] of brother Roy Borders and I TRYING TO
[1:42:22] GO BACK IN MY MIND. I don't know if this
[1:42:23] was told to me or whether he told me
[1:42:26] because I spent time with him. I back in
[1:42:30] the early 70s. I preached before I got
[1:42:32] married down there in his church a
[1:42:35] number of times while he was going
[1:42:36] through heart surgery down in Ber,
[1:42:38] Texas.
[1:42:40] I was like 18 years old,
[1:42:44] 19 maybe. Brother Borders was the
[1:42:47] campaign manager for brother Brandham
[1:42:50] and he's directing the prayer line. Now
[1:42:52] that's a pretty holy place, isn't it?
[1:42:54] Prayer line. People are being prayed,
[1:42:55] deliverance going on, people coming for
[1:42:57] prayer. power of God is moving
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; and he's directing the prayer line and
[1:43:02] during the prayer line he started having
[1:43:04] these most evil and vile and filthy
[1:43:07] thoughts and it condemned his heart so
[1:43:10] bad he just he just was so wounded
[1:43:14] inside you know he's ashamed and he was
[1:43:17] embarrassed because HE KNEW STANDING
[1:43:20] BEFORE THAT prophet everything was
[1:43:22] exposed
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; and he and after the prayer line was
[1:43:27] over and he got with brother Brandham.
[1:43:29] He apologized, "Brother Brham, I I I'm
[1:43:32] so embarrassed. I'm I'm so ashamed. I
[1:43:36] had the most filthiest thoughts. I know
[1:43:38] you knew them. I know you got THEM. I
[1:43:39] KNOW I KNOW YOU DISCERNED THEM. I I I
[1:43:42] you know, I had all these thoughts and
[1:43:44] and I'm so ashamed. I'M SO EMBARRASSED."
[1:43:46] WHILE THE PRAYER LINE WAS GOING ON. And
[1:43:49] Brother Brand looked at him and he kind
[1:43:53] of surprised. He said, "Roy,
[1:43:55] those were aimed at me,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; and you just got in the way."
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; The devil doing everything HE COULD TO
[1:44:06] CLOUD THAT PROPHET'S MIND
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; TO KEEP HIM FROM PRAYING THE PRAYER OF
[1:44:10] FAITH.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; SOUND FAMILIAR?
[1:44:13] AMEN.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; BUT LET ME GO BEYOND THE THE HOLIEST OF
[1:44:20] ALL.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; THE ONE WHO WAS WITHOUT FAULT.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; AND LET ME tell you, even Jesus was
[1:44:25] tempted.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; He faced those same intrusive thoughts,
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; but he conquered them with the word.
[1:44:37] Amen.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible said Jesus was led up by the
[1:44:41] spirit into the wilderness be tempted of
[1:44:43] the devil. You know why? Cuz God ain't
[1:44:45] afraid of his salvation.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered him every time.
[1:44:52] Matthew in Matthew 4 L and Matthew 4:4,
[1:44:55] Luke 4:4, it is written [clears throat]
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; every time he DID WHAT? HE CAST DOWN
[1:45:02] those strongholds
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; with WHAT THE WORD SAID. I'M TRYING TO
[1:45:08] TEACH YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MIND.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; NOW, SO YOU SEE, TEMPTATION ITSELF IS
[1:45:17] NOT SIN. EVEN OUR LORD WAS TEMPTED YET
[1:45:19] WAS WITHOUT SIN.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; NOW, and how can I overcome? Let me just
[1:45:29] quote brother Bradom. Temptation was for
[1:45:31] him. You know that the Bible said he was
[1:45:34] tempted in all points like we are, yet
[1:45:36] without sin.
[1:45:40] Get ready. Put seat belts on.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; He was tempted by drinking.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; He was tempted by women.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; He was tempted by everything that could
[1:45:53] be tempted by.
[1:45:58] He was tempted by everything we are.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; He was a man. And yet he you couldn't
[1:46:04] put a mark on him.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; You see, HE FACED EVERY FIERY DART, THE
[1:46:12] LUST OF THE FLESH, THE PRIDE OF LIFE,
[1:46:14] AND EVERY LIE THAT SATAN could hurl. And
[1:46:17] he overcame by standing firm on the word
[1:46:19] of God. Listen to me. You got to
[1:46:22] recognize your enemy.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THE POWER
[1:46:29] WITHIN YOU.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. Now
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; let let me tell you, you've got to
[1:46:35] recognize your enemy. WHEN JESUS WHEN
[1:46:37] JESUS FACED THE DEVIL, HE SAW A DEVIL.
[1:46:40] HE SAW SATAN. HE SAW LUCIFER. HE SAW a
[1:46:43] form.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; But most time you face him, you don't
[1:46:49] see anybody.
[1:46:51] And that's why you think it's you.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham had an experience
[1:47:00] and you can look this up. Just look up
[1:47:02] Alioop.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about how that
[1:47:07] one day that he was laying in bed and he
[1:47:11] said there was a
[1:47:15] he began to hear a voice in the room and
[1:47:17] he said it sounded a weird voice. It
[1:47:19] sound like a hen cackling going to the
[1:47:21] barn.
[1:47:23] So,
[1:47:27] so it said,
[1:47:30] "You're not really a prophet.
[1:47:34] These miracles you talk about isn't
[1:47:36] real.
[1:47:38] Those things never really happen.
[1:47:42] They're just all made up."
[1:47:47] Can you imagine the audacity of a devil
[1:47:50] standing there and telling a prophet of
[1:47:52] God who had defeated him time after time
[1:47:54] after time after time after time in the
[1:47:56] prayer line
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; discerned him and cast him out
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; that it wasn't real.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; You see, but in as a prophet, he could
[1:48:08] see his enemy. He said he looked like a
[1:48:12] distorted figure because see Satan fell
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; and and he he is he is a a he was a like
[1:48:21] a distorted figure like Alioop. I don't
[1:48:23] know if you ever saw him but like a
[1:48:25] caveman all de deformed and and bloated
[1:48:29] out and whatever else out of the funny
[1:48:30] papers. He said look like that.
[1:48:34] And he said, "I I thought ah I'm going
[1:48:37] to wake up me and let her see it." He
[1:48:39] said, "No, that scare her to death."
[1:48:43] And he said, "I, you know, I WAS
[1:48:44] LISTENING TO THAT AND AFTER A WHILE, I
[1:48:46] GOT TIRED OF IT."
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; And I said, "SATAN, YOU'RE AN OFFENSE TO
[1:48:50] ME.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; GET OUT OF HERE.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST IS AGAINST
[1:48:56] YOU."
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; OH, ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
[1:49:00] YOU WANT THE BATTLE TO ROAR IN YOUR
[1:49:03] MIND. BUT YOU CAN STOP IT RIGHT NOW IN
[1:49:06] HIS TRACKS. [applause]
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO RECOGNIZE your enemy. YOU MAY
[1:49:14] YOU MAY NOT SEE HIM AN ALLEY. YOU MAY
[1:49:17] NOT SEE HIM AS LUCIFER. YOU MAY NOT SEE
[1:49:19] HIM AS A SPEAR. YOU MAY NOT SEE HIM AS A
[1:49:21] DARK SHADOW. BUT HE'S there
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; warning in your mind.
[1:49:31] So don't let anybody tell you there's no
[1:49:33] devil. That's just a thought. No,
[1:49:35] there's a real devil. He's real as you
[1:49:36] are.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; But there's a different reality though.
[1:49:40] You're eternal and he's not.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And here's a real victory. The God that
[1:49:44] lives inside of you is greater than he
[1:49:46] that is is greater than the one that's
[1:49:48] against you.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can do what James 4:7 said
[1:49:53] and submit yourself therefore TO GOD AND
[1:49:55] RESIST THE DEVIL.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; And he will flee from you. SO THE YOU
[1:50:01] SEE THAT'S THE REAL OVERCOMING IT IS TO
[1:50:04] RECOGNIZE BOTH THE REALITY OF the enemy
[1:50:07] and the authority OF THE CHRIST THAT
[1:50:09] lives in you. AND FOR YOU ARE NOT
[1:50:12] FIGHTING FOR VICTORY. YOU ARE FIGHTING
[1:50:15] FROM VICTORY.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE CONQUEROR ALREADY LIVES INSIDE
[1:50:20] OF YOU.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; MAN IN ALL THESE THINGS WE'RE MORE THAN
[1:50:22] conquerors
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; through him that loved us.
[1:50:26] Now
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; listen, faith does not deny reality.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; It declares dominion.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Overcoming doesn't mean denying the
[1:50:37] problem.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; You You can't say, "I don't believe I'm
[1:50:40] sick."
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; If sickness has attacked your body, no,
[1:50:44] you're sick.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; You know, you say, "Well, I don't have
[1:50:48] cancer." Well, yeah, you do. If the
[1:50:50] doctor said and they did all the Yeah,
[1:50:51] you got it. Jesus never told us to deny
[1:50:54] the existence of the mountain.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "SPEAK TO IT."
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't SAY, "PRETEND IT AIN'T THERE."
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; NO, THE MOUNTAIN'S THERE. IT'S BIG. IT'S
[1:51:06] IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SPEAK TO IT.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; YOUR mountain has to hear your voice.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; You see, you got to realize and remember
[1:51:18] there's a greater power in you than this
[1:51:20] power that's attacked you. The Holy
[1:51:22] Spirit already dwells in you and has
[1:51:24] already overcome every disease, you
[1:51:26] know, EVERY DEMON, EVERY DOUBT. AND THIS
[1:51:29] IS WHAT HE SAID YOU WOULD DO. THESE
[1:51:31] SIGNS shall follow them that believe.
[1:51:33] Are you a believer?
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. THEN IN MY NAME, THEY SHALL CAST
[1:51:37] OUT DEVILS. AMEN.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; NOW, YOU MAY NEVER DO WHAT I'VE DONE
[1:51:40] HERE AT THE ALTAR OR OR OUT AND ABOUT OR
[1:51:42] WHEREVER BECAUSE I've seen it done where
[1:51:45] people in the audience fell out under
[1:51:47] under power of demon spirits and they
[1:51:49] they were cast out as I preached the
[1:51:51] word.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; I've seen it as I laid hands on them as
[1:51:54] I even just whispered to them.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; You may never do that,
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; but you have the authority to cast out
[1:52:03] Satan.
[1:52:04] And you start by casting him out of your
[1:52:06] mind.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Salvation cast him out of your soul. He
[1:52:11] ain't there.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; But he comes in the mind.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's the battlefield.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And just because you won the war
[1:52:22] yesterday don't mean he don't come back
[1:52:25] today.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; You see, but I I'm just trying to trying
[1:52:30] to tell you something. I I'm I'm trying
[1:52:33] to let you know you are not to let FEAR
[1:52:36] OR GUILT TAKE YOU PRISONER.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; THE WORD DECLARES THERE IS NO THEREFORE
[1:52:42] NOW NO CONDEMNATION. ROMANS 8:1 IS MY
[1:52:45] FAVORITE PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE. ROMANS
[1:52:48] CHAPTER 8, THERE IS THEREFORE NOW
[1:52:50] [screaming]
[1:52:50] NO CONDEMNATION
[1:52:52] TO THEM WHICH ARE in Christ Jesus
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:52:57] the spirit.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the battle begins in the mind
[1:53:01] but victory begins in the spirit.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; You you don't overcome remember our
[1:53:08] mountain moving scripture from
[1:53:10] Zechariah. You don't overcome by might
[1:53:12] or by power but by his spirit living in
[1:53:15] you.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; So child of God, I'm telling you this
[1:53:18] morning, fight.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't surrender your mind to fear
[1:53:23] or doubt or depression. YOU'RE SEALED OR
[1:53:25] YOU'RE REDEEMED. AND NOT ONLY THAT,
[1:53:27] YOU'RE ARMED.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; EQUIPPED.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; THE WEAPONS ARE MIGHTY.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE FOR CASTING DOWN STRONGHOLDS.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; AS I KEEP SAYING, NOT THE DECORATIONS.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; SO, pull down those strongholds,
[1:53:45] demolish those imaginations.
[1:53:47] You stand there, stand your ground in
[1:53:50] the authority of the blood, and remind
[1:53:53] the devil, he's the one locked out. Not
[1:53:56] you.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; He's been locked out of heaven,
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; but heaven is open for you.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; But he's locked out. He cannot come into
[1:54:09] you. HE IS LOCKED OUT CUZ YOU'RE
[1:54:12] REDEEMED. COME ON.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW, UNBELIEF IS ALWAYS THE THE
[1:54:16] ENEMY'S STRONGHOLD. UNBELIEF questions
[1:54:19] God's goodness. He questions his timing
[1:54:22] and and his promises. He comes and
[1:54:24] whispers that same lie.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; That same lie the serpent spoke in in
[1:54:30] Eden. Yes, God said.
[1:54:32] And in that moment, Satan convinced Eve
[1:54:35] that God was holding something good
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; back from her.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; God's holding something good back from
[1:54:43] you. I want you to see Psalms 84:11.
[1:54:47] I want you to get this. Psalms 84:11.
[1:54:50] Let them put it up.
[1:54:55] For the Lord God is a son and a shield,
[1:55:00] AND THE LORD WILL GIVE GRACE AND GLORY.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; NO GOOD THING
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; WILL HE WITHHOLD FROM THEM THAT WALK UP
[1:55:11] RIGHTLY.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; NO GOOD THING WILL HE WITHHOLD. That's
[1:55:20] right.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; OH.
[1:55:23] UH OH. Uh oh. Some of you just got a
[1:55:26] dart. You just
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; beer come right in and you just thought
[1:55:31] came in your mind. I knew there was a
[1:55:34] catch.
[1:55:35] No good thing from them that walk up
[1:55:37] rightly.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure I have a flaws somewhere.
[1:55:43] [laughter]
[1:55:43] I I'm less than perfect.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; So God ain't going to give it to me.
[1:55:50] He going to give it to me
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; cuz he'll he won't withhold from those
[1:55:54] who walk uprightly. And I I I know I got
[1:55:56] flaws.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; I know I made mistakes. I know I have
[1:56:00] failures. I I I know I blunder
[1:56:02] sometimes. Sometimes I have doubt in my
[1:56:04] heart. Sometimes I
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:56:10] well, let me tell you. Let's Let's put
[1:56:12] up a few scriptures because we're going
[1:56:15] to use them to woof the devil with.
[1:56:18] CUZ WE DEFEAT THE DEVIL BY THE WORD.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; EPHESIANS 1:4, ACCORDING AS HE HAD
[1:56:23] CHOSEN US
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; IN HIM
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD THAT
[1:56:29] WE SHOULD BE HOLY AND WITHOUT BLAME
[1:56:31] BEFORE HIM IN LOVE. [applause]
[1:56:35] NOW TAKE THAT, DEVIL.
[1:56:37] AMEN. THERE'S AN ATOMIC BOMB TO BLOW
[1:56:40] DOWN YOUR STRONGHOLD.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; I'LL TURN THAT DIRT AROUND, THROW IT
[1:56:44] BACK AT YOU WITH A FLAME OF FIRE ON IT.
[1:56:47] AMEN.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; He chose me to be holy. He didn't choose
[1:56:50] me because I was holy. He chose me to be
[1:56:53] holy. He didn't choose me because I was
[1:56:55] blameless. He chose me to be blameless.
[1:56:58] So if I lack, he's going to make up for
[1:57:00] it.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim,
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; how could we go through this evil world
[1:57:09] and be blameless? Well, let me give you
[1:57:11] another scripture.
[1:57:13] You know, Philippians 2:15, we're going
[1:57:15] to we're going to cast down every
[1:57:17] argument.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. that we
[1:57:22] Philippians 2:15 that we may be
[1:57:24] blameless and harmless, the sons of God,
[1:57:29] without rebuke,
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; in the midst
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; OF A CROOKED AND PERVERSE
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; NATION,
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; AMONG WHOM YOU SHINE AS LIGHTS IN THE
[1:57:41] WORLD,
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; HOLDING FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR THAT? YES.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR THAT?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT YOU MAY BE BLAMELESS
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; AND HARMLESS.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; CAN'T HAPPEN IN THIS EVIL AGE, SONS OF
[1:57:57] GOD, WITHOUT REBUKE IN THE MIDST OF A
[1:57:59] CROOKED AND PERVERSE GENERATION.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Holding forth the word of life. Yes.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; So why did he send a message,
[1:58:15] a raptured message in the last day
[1:58:18] to prepare people for his name's sake?
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; To call out a bride.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, she was not spotless.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; She was not blameless.
[1:58:33] But he took her blame
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; and he made her spotless.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:40] And do you think you really think this
[1:58:42] word is going to return to him void or
[1:58:45] empty?
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; The the God that made the heavens, the
[1:58:47] earth with the power of his word, THAT
[1:58:49] THAT GOD WILL FAIL. THAT AFTER 6,000
[1:58:52] YEARS OF REDEMPTION WORK AFTER TAKING ON
[1:58:55] FLESH AND GOING TO CALVARY AND THAT I
[1:58:57] SHED IN HIS BLOOD THAT HE'S GONNA FAIL
[1:59:00] IN GETTING you ready.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; No, he ain't GONNA DO THAT. THE BIBLE
[1:59:07] SAID IN PSALMS 107:20, HE SENT HIS WORD.
[1:59:11] HOW MANY BELIEVE HE SENT A MESSAGE?
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SENT HIS WORD AND
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; HEALED THEM.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND DELIVERED THEM
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; FROM THEIR DESTRUCTIONS.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE WORD WAS SENT FOR. NOT
[1:59:26] TO CONDEMN YOU,
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; BUT TO CONDEMN THE DEVIL.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HEAL YOU. YES.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; AND DELIVER YOU
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; FROM YOUR destruction
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; because of his great love that he has
[1:59:44] for you. Ephesians 5:26.
[1:59:48] That he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:59:51] with the continual washing of the water
[1:59:54] by the word. That's what I'm doing with
[1:59:56] the word this morning. I'm giving you a
[1:59:58] good scrubbing in your mind.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. sanctify and cleanse it with the
[2:00:05] washing of the water by the word that he
[2:00:09] might present it to himself.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; A FAILED CHURCH, NO, A GLORIOUS CHURCH,
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; NOT HAVING SPOT OR WRINKLE OR ANY SUCH
[2:00:19] THING, YOU NAME IT, THAT WE SHOULD BE
[2:00:22] HOLY
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; AND without blemish.
[2:00:27] Glory to God.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; But you know, back to Eve again. Satan
[2:00:32] convinced Eve that God was holding back
[2:00:34] something good from her.
[2:00:36] And yet God had already fortified them
[2:00:38] with the word. He gave him a clear
[2:00:40] warning. His word built a fortress
[2:00:42] around them. And the day you eat
[2:00:43] thereof, that day you shall surely die.
[2:00:46] He It was there. It gave perimeters.
[2:00:49] But Satan But Eve allowed Satan to exalt
[2:00:52] his thoughts against the word of God.
[2:00:55] And that's where unbelief begins when
[2:00:58] reasoning becomes elevated over
[2:01:00] revelation.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; You see, she accepted his imagination
[2:01:05] over God's inspiration. AND IN DOING SO,
[2:01:09] SHE BECAME CAPTIVE TO his deception.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; AND THE SERPENT BUILT THE FIRST
[2:01:14] STRONGHOLD, A FORTRESS OF DOUBT. And
[2:01:18] then you what happened? Humanity became
[2:01:21] enslaved to sin.
[2:01:24] AND SIN KILLED US.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; I mean that
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; it's death is separation.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; SO IT SEPARATED FROM GOD AND ALL MANKIND
[2:01:37] WAS DEAD.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; And that's what happened.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; He come and built a fortress in Eve's
[2:01:47] mind there poisoned her soul. Set death
[2:01:50] in her soul, death in the flesh. And
[2:01:53] then we're all born that way.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; But that ain't the end of the story.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; It might have be sin's beginning,
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; but it ain't redemption's ending.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians 2:1, "AND YOU HATH YE MADE
[2:02:10] ALIVE." AMEN.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; WHO WERE DEAD IN TRESPASSES AND SINS,
[2:02:15] WHEREIN TIME PASSED, YOU WALKED
[2:02:17] ACCORDING TO THE PRINCE OF THE POWER of
[2:02:20] the of the of THE AIR, THE SPIRIT THAT
[2:02:22] NOW WORKKETH IN THE CHILDREN of
[2:02:24] disobedience, among whom we all had our
[2:02:28] MANNER OF LIVING, OUR CONVERSATION IN
[2:02:30] TIMES PAST, IN THE LUST OF OUR FLESH,
[2:02:33] FULFILLING THE DESIRES OF THE FLESH AND
[2:02:35] OF THE MIND. And we're by nature
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; the children OF WRATH
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; AS OTHERS.
[2:02:48] It's
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; a bleak picture, ain't it?
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; But God,
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. BUT GOD, [applause]
[2:02:58] BUT GOD WHO IS RICH IN MERCY, FOR HIS
[2:03:02] GREAT LOVE WHEREWITH HE LOVED US, EVEN
[2:03:05] WHEN WE WERE DEAD
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; IN SINS AND TRESPASSES.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He hath quickened us
[2:03:14] together
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; with Christ. For by grace,
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; by grace,
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; BY THE FAVOR OF GOD,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; NOT IN anything you did,
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; not because YOU WERE WORTHY,
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE YOU WORKED HARD,
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; BUT BY GRACE, BY THE FAVOR OF GOD,
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; BY HIS LOVE THAT HE HAD FOR YOU. YOU ARE
[2:03:38] SAVED.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS RAISED US UP TOGETHER AND
[2:03:43] made us sit together in heavenly places
[2:03:45] in Christ Jesus to reign with him that
[2:03:48] in the ages to come he might show the
[2:03:50] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[2:03:53] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[2:03:55] For by grace are you saved through
[2:03:57] faith, not of yourself. It's the gift of
[2:04:01] God,
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; not of works, lest any man should boast.
[2:04:07] Amen.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; I can't brag. You can't brag. I was
[2:04:11] good. I was better than you. That's why
[2:04:12] I am what I am.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; No, it's by grace.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Grace.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; God's grace.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Grace. Say, "Oh, amazing."
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Did he look beyond your fault
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; and he saw your need?
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. IN COLOSSIANS 1:21, "AND YOU THAT
[2:04:32] WERE SOMETIMES ALIENATED AND enemous
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; in YOUR MIND
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; BY WICKED WORKS, YET NOW HAS HE
[2:04:41] reconciled
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; in the body of his flesh through death
[2:04:45] to present you to present you to present
[2:04:48] you holy, unblameable, unreprovable in
[2:04:53] his sight."
[2:04:55] So now because of the finished work of
[2:04:57] Calvary,
[2:04:58] Satan can no longer possess
[2:05:01] you.
[2:05:03] He can no longer enter the redeemed
[2:05:05] soul.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; You have been sealed by the Holy Spirit
[2:05:09] of promise.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Is somebody hearing me this morning? I'm
[2:05:13] trying to get it to you.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot take you captive.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; But he can try to hold you hostage
[2:05:20] through thoughts of fear and doubt. HIS
[2:05:24] STRATEGY IS NOW IS mental warfare
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; because he wants to keep YOU LIVING
[2:05:31] UNDER DARK CLOUDS OF UNBELIEF
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; AND AFRAID TO USE THE VERY WEAPONS THAT
[2:05:36] GOD HAS GIVEN YOU. BUT REMEMBER, YOU
[2:05:38] WILL KNOW THE TRUTH.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then you know truth and you're
[2:05:46] already free.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; I'm looking out here at men and women
[2:05:50] today. You're already free. Amen.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO WHY ALLOW THE DEVIL CONTROL
[2:05:56] WHAT CHRIST IS LIBERATING?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; UNBELIEF IS NOT MERELY DOUBT. IT'S
[2:06:01] REBELLION AGAINST TRUTH.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; IT SHUTS THE DOOR THAT FAITH WAS MEANT
[2:06:06] TO OPEN. YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAID HE
[2:06:08] CANNOT DO MIGHTY WORKS BECAUSE OF THEIR
[2:06:10] UNBELIEF. UNBELIEF BUILDS WALLS
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; WHERE GOD INTENDS TO MAKE A WAY. IT
[2:06:15] LOCKS THE DOORS OF HEALING, OF PEACE,
[2:06:17] AND PROVISION. Even when the key of
[2:06:21] faith is in your hand,
[2:06:25] he tries to lock it from you.
[2:06:29] And if you fall or stumble,
[2:06:33] if you let doubt enter,
[2:06:35] I'm trying to tell you, don't stay
[2:06:36] condemned.
[2:06:39] The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; from all sin.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; First John 1:9, if we confess our sins,
[2:06:57] he is faithful.
[2:07:00] He is faithful
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; and just righteous
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; to forgive us our SINS
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; AND TO CLEANSE US
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; from all unrighteousness.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; FOR THEREFORE THERE IS NOW NO
[2:07:14] condemnation
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; to them who are in Christ Jesus.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; SO I'M TELLING YOU TO STAND TALL, CHILD
[2:07:20] OF GOD.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE REDEEMED. YOU ARE BLESSED.
[2:07:24] YOU'RE CLEANSED. YOU'RE MADE PURE. THEY
[2:07:27] QUIT QUESTIONING GOD'S PROMISES OR HIS
[2:07:29] TIMING. HE HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; HIS DELAYS ARE NOT DENIALS.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE DIVINE PREPARATIONS.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; GOD'S GETTING YOU READY FOR A BIGGER
[2:07:40] MIRACLE.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; For a buck says the vision is for an
[2:07:46] appointed time.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Though it tar, wait for it, for it will
[2:07:50] surely come, it will not carry.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Faith says God will do it. Unbelief says
[2:07:56] maybe he won't. Faith builds altars.
[2:08:00] Unbelief builds walls to make
[2:08:01] strongholds. Faith opens the heaven.
[2:08:05] Unbelief clouds the mind.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; So I'm telling you this morning, tear
[2:08:09] down, tear down every thought that rises
[2:08:12] against the word.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; CAST DOWN THOSE IMAGINATIONS, THOSE HIGH
[2:08:16] THINGS THAT EXALTS ITSELF AGAINST the
[2:08:18] knowledge OF GOD. LIFT UP THE SHIELD OF
[2:08:21] FAITH AND MARCH FORWARD AND TAKE
[2:08:23] POSSESSION OF YOUR THOUGHTS.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT A PRISONER OF YOUR PAST.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE NOT TO BE A PRISONER OF YOUR
[2:08:29] THOUGHTS. YOU ARE A WARRIOR OF FAITH.
[2:08:32] YOU'RE STANDING ON AN UNSHAKABLE
[2:08:34] PROMISE.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; But you see, condemnation
[2:08:40] keeps believers chained to their past.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:46] It says, "Ah, yeah, you're forgiven, but
[2:08:49] you'll never be free."
[2:08:54] And the word declares,
[2:08:56] "Whom the Son has made free."
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Is free indeed.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE FREE.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NO LONGER IN BONDAGE. SOMEBODY
[2:09:09] HELP ME PREACH.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE IS NO CONDEMNATION
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; TO THOSE IN CHRIST.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; GUILT LOOKS BACK AT A FAILURE, BUT GRACE
[2:09:18] LOOKS TO CALVARY. IT REM, YOU KNOW, FEAR
[2:09:21] AND AND GUILT WILL REMIND YOU OF YOUR
[2:09:24] PAST. You cannot be truly pardoned.
[2:09:28] Though, until you receive that pardon,
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; you quit accepting punishment for what
[2:09:35] Jesus has paid for.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Quit taking weapons.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:41] FOR WHAT JESUS PAID IN FULL FOR.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BELIEVE HIM. IF HE SAID YOU'RE
[2:09:48] FREE, BELIEVE HIM.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; I know. It's like old Johnny Crow. You
[2:09:53] know, he was there tied there for years.
[2:09:57] He's tied by string.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; And he could only go so far. Every time
[2:10:03] the other crow said, "We're going to fly
[2:10:05] south. You know, come go with us." I
[2:10:08] can't. I'm tied to the string. He
[2:10:10] jumped. He tried. The string would pull
[2:10:12] him down.
[2:10:14] One day a good man come by
[2:10:17] and cut the string.
[2:10:19] But Johnny Crow was so used to the
[2:10:22] string
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; and that he could only go so far
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; until he was too afraid
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; to go past
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; the boundaries
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; that had been put on him.
[2:10:37] I'm trying to tell you this morning,
[2:10:39] you're not Johnny Crow.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; You're a son or daughter of the living
[2:10:43] God
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; and every string has been cut.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN RISE UP AND FLY,
[2:10:50] LITTLE EAGLE.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO BE CAVES. RISE UP IN
[2:10:54] THE SKIES WHERE YOU BELONG, WHERE ALL
[2:10:57] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[2:11:02] But there's all kinds of things that are
[2:11:05] strongholds.
[2:11:07] Strongholds of lust,
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; carnal desires.
[2:11:11] What is lust? Lust is its desire for
[2:11:15] that which is forbidden.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Lust exalts pleasure above purity.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; It feeds the flesh until the flesh rules
[2:11:26] the spirit.
[2:11:28] The Bible said in 1 John 2 and 6 2:16,
[2:11:31] for all this in the world, the lust of
[2:11:33] the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the
[2:11:35] pride of life is not of the father.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, then can a child of God lust?
[2:11:43] Lust is evil. Brother Tim, let me ask
[2:11:46] you this. Are you still in the flesh?
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Your flesh has the propensity to do all
[2:11:55] kinds of evil.
[2:11:58] It did it.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; You know what it can do?
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; The life you lived in the flesh.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It has the propensity to do evil.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; It can still do that.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You You say, "Brother Tim, your
[2:12:15] flesh, yeah, my flesh has the propensity
[2:12:18] to do that.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; But I have been redeemed in the soul,
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; and now there's a new king that sits on
[2:12:25] the throne. And no matter WHAT MY FLESH
[2:12:28] WANTS TO DO,
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; there is A KING THAT SAYS down boy.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Down, boy.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR THE BIBLE SAID IN GALATIANS
[2:12:40] 5:17, FOR THE FLESH LUST AGAINST THE
[2:12:43] SPIRIT, AND THE SPIRIT AGAINST THE
[2:12:45] FLESH.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; So there's a war going on.
[2:12:50] YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAID IN JAMES 1:14,
[2:12:52] "EVERY MAN IS TEMPTED WHEN HE IS DRAWN
[2:12:54] AWAY OF HIS OWN LUST AND ENTICED, AND
[2:12:56] THEN WHEN LUST IS CONCEIVED, it bringeth
[2:12:58] forth sin. And sin when it is finished
[2:13:01] bringeth forth death,
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; but the Holy Ghost
[2:13:09] gives us the power
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; to crucify those affections and lust."
[2:13:17] The Bible said IN GALATIANS 5:16, "WALK
[2:13:19] IN THE SPIRIT,
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; AND YOU WILL NOT FULFILL THE LUST OF THE
[2:13:24] FLESH."
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. We're we're IN THE FLESH, BUT WE
[2:13:30] DON'T WALK AFTER THE FLESH, BUT WE WALK
[2:13:32] AFTER THE SPIRIT. NOW, SO YOU SEE AGAIN,
[2:13:35] WE WE HAVE THE FLESH TO CONTEND WITH. AS
[2:13:38] LONG AS WE'RE IN THIS BODY,
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; it has lust, it has desires, it wants,
[2:13:43] and what. But you take control.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; You have a power within you. A king sits
[2:13:49] on the throne.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; It's like Adam in Eden.
[2:13:54] The lion had a lion nature. The lamb had
[2:13:57] a lamb nature. When the lion rose up,
[2:14:02] Adam was a ruler.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Down boy.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Peace reigned.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was a ruler. That's
[2:14:13] right.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; A godly ruler. When Satan came in and he
[2:14:17] was the ruler, animals ate each other.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; The kingdom destroyed each other. Men
[2:14:22] hate each other.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; When there's the king sitting on the
[2:14:26] throne, Amen. He brings an Eden all
[2:14:29] around.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; This flesh that has the nature, has the
[2:14:35] ability
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; to do wrong.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; You can read TO READ GALATIANS 5. YOU
[2:14:41] SEE WHAT THE WORKS OF THE FLESH ARE.
[2:14:43] THAT'S WHAT THE FLESH IS IS CAPABLE OF
[2:14:45] DOING.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING IT
[2:14:50] BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN BORN AGAIN.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A KING SITTING ON THE THRONE AND
[2:14:55] IT GIVES YOU THE POWER TO RULE.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; So that's a stronghold. There's other
[2:15:04] strongholds
[2:15:06] and I couldn't begin to name all of what
[2:15:09] every one of you are have to deal with,
[2:15:12] but let me just deal with a few
[2:15:15] cuz I know there's some of you deal with
[2:15:18] the stronghold
[2:15:20] of rejection and unworthiness.
[2:15:26] That stronghold,
[2:15:30] it whispers,
[2:15:32] "God can bless others,
[2:15:34] but not you, cuz you're not good enough.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; You just don't measure up."
[2:15:49] And let me just tell you,
[2:15:51] some of these strongholds have been
[2:15:52] there a long time.
[2:15:56] Because rejection often begins as a seed
[2:16:00] planted in your childhood.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; It can happen when a father ab abandons
[2:16:07] his family. Mothers and dads separate.
[2:16:12] [snorts]
[2:16:13] It happens in moments of betrayal,
[2:16:16] disappointment, neglect.
[2:16:20] Some things are not even intended harm.
[2:16:24] It's just life. [snorts]
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; But it tells you you're not wanted.
[2:16:32] YOU'RE NOT WORTHY. YOU'RE NOT GOOD
[2:16:35] ENOUGH.
[2:16:37] But that seed is a lie.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; IT IS PLANTED BY THE SAME SERPENT WHO
[2:16:42] WHISPERED to Eve, who caused HER TO
[2:16:45] DOUBT.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SPIRIT OF REJECTION THAT CAUSES
[2:16:48] YOU TO QUESTION YOUR VALUE TO GOD. IT
[2:16:50] MAKES YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS.
[2:16:56] WELL, they're blessed and I'm not.
[2:17:00] They got this and I didn't.
[2:17:05] Don't seem like God loves me like he
[2:17:07] loves everybody else.
[2:17:09] They shouted in church and got a
[2:17:11] blessing from God and I didn't feel
[2:17:12] nothing.
[2:17:16] And it makes you compare yourself to
[2:17:18] others. Makes you feel like you'll never
[2:17:21] measure up.
[2:17:25] My family was too poor.
[2:17:27] My home was too troublesome.
[2:17:30] My past is too bad.
[2:17:33] My situation's too hard.
[2:17:38] But the scripture declares this about
[2:17:40] you.
[2:17:42] Psalms 139:14, "I will praise thee for I
[2:17:46] am fearfully and wonderfully made."
[2:17:48] Amen.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; God made you
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; unique
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; and with a purpose.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; And I don't care, woman at the well, how
[2:18:02] many husbands you have
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; and how you're living in sin now.
[2:18:06] There's a seventh one coming by
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; that's not going to take advantage OF
[2:18:10] YOU, BUT WILL REDEEM YOU,
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; THAT WILL CALL YOU OUT, THAT HAS A
[2:18:14] DIVINE APPOINTMENT FOR YOUR LIFE THAT
[2:18:16] will change you. [applause]
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, you're not a mistake
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; and you're not forgotten.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; You're handcrafted by God.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; You're designed for a purpose. You're
[2:18:35] redeemed by his own blood.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil's goal isn't just to
[2:18:44] make you feel sad. IT'S MAKE YOU DOUBT
[2:18:46] WHO YOU ARE IN CHRIST.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT'S BAD ENOUGH JUST TO MAKE
[2:18:50] YOU FEEL SAD, BUT HE WANTS TO MAKE YOU
[2:18:51] DOUBT WHO YOU ARE IN CHRIST. HE KNOWS IF
[2:18:54] IF YOU QUESTION YOUR IDENTITY IDENTITY,
[2:18:57] YOU WILL QUESTION YOUR AUTHORITY.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Did you get that? Yes.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Well, that's the WAY HE CAME WITH JESUS.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; HEY, RIGHT AFTER he got the Holy Ghost,
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; did Jesus get the Holy Ghost? Yeah. At
[2:19:13] the River Jordan, [snorts]
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; and he gets the Holy Ghost. And the
[2:19:19] first thing that happens
[2:19:23] is he led in temptation
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; where the devil says
[2:19:28] it didn't really happen.
[2:19:35] Well, there was a dove, there was a
[2:19:37] light, there was a voice, and there was
[2:19:39] a prophet.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; But it didn't happen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; You didn't [snorts] really get it.
[2:19:48] If you are the son of God,
[2:19:51] Satan tried to plant doubt into his mind
[2:19:54] about his sunship,
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; but Jesus didn't argue with him.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; I I WANT TO GET IT.
[2:20:01] THIS IS NOT ABOUT ARGUING WITH THE
[2:20:03] DEVIL.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; IT IS ABOUT ANSWERING BY THE WORD. IT IS
[2:20:08] WRITTEN.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU AT THAT
[2:20:12] MOMENT JESUS DIDN'T FEEL LIKE HE FELT
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE HE WAS THERE IN CHURCH IN
[2:20:18] SERVICE ON THE RIVER BANKS
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; AND THE THE POWER OF GOD CAME DOWN. HE
[2:20:24] WASN'T FEELING IT. HE WAS FEELING A
[2:20:26] DEVIL,
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; a demon spirit.
[2:20:33] The same one
[2:20:35] that deceived
[2:20:37] Eve in the garden
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; now comes to get him
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; to make him doubt.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; And the first thing he wanted to do was
[2:20:46] get you to doubt your sunship.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; So you're to tear down that lie what it
[2:20:58] is written. That's right.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Prove it. Prove it. IF YOU ARE, PROVE
[2:21:03] IT.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
[2:21:07] TO PROVE TO THE DEVIL.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Come on now. AMEN. YOU YOU JUST SAY,
[2:21:13] "MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE, BUT
[2:21:15] BY EVERY WORD." I'M GOING, HOW I'M GOING
[2:21:17] TO LIVE IS BY THE WORD. THIS IS THE WAY
[2:21:20] I'M GOING TO DEFEAT THE DEVIL IS BY THE
[2:21:21] WORD. HERE'S HOW I live
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; is by the word. Amen.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; So what
[2:21:30] first John 3 and1 behold what manner of
[2:21:33] love the father has bestowed upon us
[2:21:37] that we should be called the sons of
[2:21:39] god. God called me his son. That's all I
[2:21:41] need to know.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; When you know you're loved, when you
[2:21:47] know you're chosen,
[2:21:50] when you know you're called, that's when
[2:21:52] rejection loses its grip. Amen.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; But it's one of Satan's crulest lies
[2:21:57] that is designed to make a believer feel
[2:22:00] unloved or overlooked or forgotten. AND
[2:22:03] JESUS SHATTERED THAT LIE when he said,
[2:22:05] "YOU HAVE NOT CHOSEN ME. I CHOSE YOU."
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; AND I ORDAINED YOU TO BRING FORTH FRUIT,
[2:22:12] TO BRING FORTH LIFE.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; YOU You didn't choose him. HE CHOSE YOU.
[2:22:17] YOU WERE IN HIS HEART. I WANT TO GET
[2:22:19] THIS TO YOU. YOU WERE IN HIS HEART
[2:22:21] BEFORE YOU EVER BOWED YOUR KNEES. FOR HE
[2:22:23] LOVED YOU WHEN YOU WERE UNLOVABLE.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; NOTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE HAS EVER
[2:22:31] CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT YOU.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; He chose YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF
[2:22:36] THE WORLD AND HE'LL NEVER UNCHEOOSE YOU.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S A GOD WHO CAN'T CHANGE HIS
[2:22:40] MIND. SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, CALVARY IS THE ETERNAL
[2:22:47] ANSWER TO THE TO THE LIE OF UNWORTHINESS
[2:22:50] BECAUSE AT THE CROSS, JESUS DIDN'T JUST
[2:22:53] TELL YOU YOU'RE LOVED. HE PROVED THAT
[2:22:55] YOU'RE LOVED.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible said in in Romans 5:8, he
[2:23:01] commended his love toward us. And that
[2:23:02] when we WERE YET SINNERS, CHRIST DIED
[2:23:06] FOR US.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't wait till you was righteous to
[2:23:11] die in your place.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. to take your punishment.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Oh no,
[2:23:18] you're worth the blood of Jesus.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; He declares in Isaiah 49:15,
[2:23:24] "Can a woman forget her nursing child
[2:23:29] and not have compassion on the son of
[2:23:31] her womb? Yay, they may forget, but I'll
[2:23:33] not forget you. Behold, I have craven
[2:23:36] thee upon the palms of my hands." You
[2:23:38] know why we write things? Why we write
[2:23:41] things in our palms?
[2:23:43] so we won't forget.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. AND AT CALVARY, HE PROVED YOUR
[2:23:49] WORTH ONCE AND FOR ALL. HE SHED HIS
[2:23:51] BLOOD FOR YOU. AND AND IF HE EVER NEEDS
[2:23:53] TO REMEMBER, which God can't forget,
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; but if he ever NEEDS TO REMEMBER YOUR
[2:23:58] NAME,
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; ALL HE HAS TO DO IS LOOK AT THE NAIL
[2:24:01] SCARS IN HIS HANDS, THE ETERNAL MARKS OF
[2:24:03] HIS LOVE. LET ME TELL YOU, THAT'S NOT
[2:24:06] REJECTION. THAT IS ETERNAL REMEMBRANCE.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, WHY? BECAUSE HE had made us
[2:24:14] accepted in the beloved.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; You are accepted, not rejected. You are
[2:24:18] chosen, not forgotten. You are loved.
[2:24:21] You're not overlooked.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:24:28] let me take you back to elementary grade
[2:24:31] for a moment.
[2:24:36] Let me take you back to your first
[2:24:37] beginnings.
[2:24:41] LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO THE church where
[2:24:44] it made its first turn
[2:24:47] toward
[2:24:50] toward restoration and it was
[2:24:52] reformation.
[2:24:54] Wasn't even restoration yet.
[2:24:58] And that was Martin Luther.
[2:25:01] And constant condemnation was what
[2:25:04] troubled. It was a trick that Satan used
[2:25:08] to torment him.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know from his
[2:25:14] deliverance came a message.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; And that message was delivered to the
[2:25:19] church. You know, as a monk, LUTHER
[2:25:21] WOULD BEAT HIMSELF TRYING TO PAY FOR
[2:25:23] SINS that Jesus had already paid for.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; But one day a REVELATION CAME AND STRUCK
[2:25:29] HIM LIKE LIGHTNING THAT READ, "THE JUST
[2:25:31] SHALL LIVE BY FAITH." AMEN.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; AND FAITH liberated him. AND HE REALIZED
[2:25:37] THAT HOLINESS ISN'T ACHIEVED BY
[2:25:39] SUFFERING. IT'S RECEIVED BY BELIEVING.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; AND AND LIKEWISE, THERE'S MANY
[2:25:45] CHRISTIANS TODAY, THEY THEY LIVE UNDER
[2:25:48] SPIRITUAL SELF-PUNISHMENT.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; THEY THEY'RE REPAYING THEY'RE REPLAYING
[2:25:53] THEIR PAST. THEY'RE DOUBTING THEIR
[2:25:55] FORGIVENESS. THEY'RE TRYING TO EARN WHAT
[2:25:57] GRACE HAS ALREADY GIVEN. BUT THE CROSS
[2:26:01] DECLARED IT IS FINISHED.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIE BY DOUBT. YOU'RE
[2:26:06] CALLED BY TO LIVE BY FAITH.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Faith that Jesus paid it all.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Faith that our record has been wiped
[2:26:16] clean.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; FAITH THAT WE STAND NOW IN THE
[2:26:21] RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST AND WE'RE
[2:26:22] CLOTHED IN HIS GRACE and we're MADE
[2:26:24] FREE.
[2:26:26] SO START, YOU KNOW, STOP LETTING THE
[2:26:28] DEVIL DRAG YOU THROUGH THE MEMORIES OF
[2:26:30] YOUR PAST
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT EVEN REMEMBER THEM.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY IT AGAIN.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; STOP LETTING THE DEVIL DRAG YOU THROUGH
[2:26:43] THE MEMORIES OF YOUR PAST
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THEM.
[2:26:50] ISAIAH 43:25 AND blazing this in your
[2:26:53] heart. He said, "I even I am he that
[2:26:57] blotth out thy transgressions for mine
[2:27:00] own sake and will not remember thy
[2:27:02] sins."
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want you to know, friends, YOU
[2:27:08] HAVE THE RIGHT IN THIS BATTLE TO REMIND
[2:27:10] THE DEVIL of his own failures.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE TEMPTER COMES WHISPERING,
[2:27:15] YOU AREN'T WORTHY, I WANT YOU TO TURN
[2:27:16] THE TABLES ON HIM. YOU REMIND HIM OF HIS
[2:27:19] PAST.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS CAST DOWN LIKE LIGHTNING.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT HE'S KICKED OUT OF HEAVEN.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; AND REMIND HIM OF HIS FUTURE THAT HE'D
[2:27:28] BE BOUND AND CHAINED AND DESTINED FOR
[2:27:30] THE LAKE OF FIRE. AND THAT ONE DAY I'LL
[2:27:33] STAND THERE AND LOOK NARROWLY UPON YOU
[2:27:35] AND CONSIDER it and SAY, "IS THIS THE
[2:27:37] MAN that made the earth to tremble and
[2:27:39] that shake kingdoms?" [applause]
[2:27:42] This one,
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; this nasty devil.
[2:27:48] And then I want you to remind yourself
[2:27:49] of your future.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Your past is buried in the sea of God's
[2:27:55] forgetfulness.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; And God put up a permanent sign that
[2:28:00] says no fishing.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Nobody's got a right to fish for your
[2:28:05] sins or my sins.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're under the blood of
[2:28:09] Jesus Christ.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil can't EVEN FISH THEM
[2:28:13] OUT. COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH YES. YOUR YOUR PAST IS BURIED
[2:28:18] IN THE SEA OF GOD'S FORGIVENESS. YOUR
[2:28:20] PRESENT IS SECURED AS LOVE. YOUR FUTURE
[2:28:23] IS RADIANT WITH THE GLORY OF HEAVEN. AS
[2:28:25] FAR AS THE EAST IS FROM THE WEST, SO HE
[2:28:29] HAS REMOVED OUR TRANSGRESSIONS FROM US.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; I didn't MAKE THAT UP. THAT'S PSALMS 103
[2:28:35] VERSE 12.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; And that makes it that in his presence
[2:28:41] is the fullness of joy.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you're not forgotten.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Rejection is a lie.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Unworthiness is a deception.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; The truth is you're chosen. Redeemed
[2:28:56] accepted in the beloved.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; I don't feel that way. Well, like Daniel
[2:29:01] Williams said one time comes to mind.
[2:29:04] Said, you might feel like you're so ugly
[2:29:06] you have to sneak up to get on a drink
[2:29:08] of water, [laughter]
[2:29:11] BUT CHRIST GAVE HIS BLOOD FOR YOU. AMEN.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, TEAR DOWN THAT THOUGHT OF
[2:29:16] REJECTION.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; SILENCE THE LIE THAT SAYS YOU'RE NOT
[2:29:19] WORTHY OR YOU'RE NOT LOVED OR YOU'RE NOT
[2:29:21] BEING BLESSED. YOU'RE ENGRAVED IN HIS
[2:29:24] HANDS. YOU'RE SEALED BY HIS SPIRIT.
[2:29:25] YOU'RE DESTINED FOR THE GLORY. YOU'RE
[2:29:27] NOT FORGOTTEN. YOU'RE YOU'RE FAVORED.
[2:29:29] YOU'RE NOT FORSAKEN. YOU'RE CHOSEN.
[2:29:31] YOU'RE NOT CONDEMNED. YOU'RE REDEEMED.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE SAY? I KNOW THE THOUGHTS
[2:29:38] THAT I THINK TOWARD YOU.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T KNOW, GOD. WHAT DO YOU
[2:29:42] THINK ABOUT ME? GO. I'M AFRAID OF WHAT
[2:29:44] YOU THINK. I KNOW THE THOUGHTS I THINK
[2:29:46] ABOUT YOU.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29:11. I KNOW THE THOUGHTS I
[2:29:51] THINK OF YOU,
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; SAITH THE LORD. THOUGHTS OF PEACE AND
[2:29:57] NOT OF EVIL TO BRING YOU TO A HOPE AND A
[2:30:01] FUTURE.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; That's your expected end.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. DON'T LET SOME DEVIL SIT ON
[2:30:08] YOUR SHOULDER AND TWIST THAT. WELL, MY
[2:30:10] EXPECTED END WILL BE THE LAKE OF FIRE.
[2:30:13] NO, MY EXPECTED IAN IS A HOPE AND A
[2:30:16] FUTURE. THAT'S WHAT HE CAME TO BRING.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; A HOPE AND A FUTURE.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; NOT TO ABANDON ME, NOT TO LEAVE ME
[2:30:23] behind
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; because I'm accepted in the beloved. I'm
[2:30:27] his love. I'm the love of his life. I'M
[2:30:30] THE JOY OF HIS HEART. HE SINGS OVER ME.
[2:30:32] I AM HIS MASTERPIECE. AND GUESS WHAT?
[2:30:35] HE'S NOT THROUGH WORKING ON ME.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO IF HE SEES SOMETHING A
[2:30:40] LITTLE WRONG, HE'LL FIX IT. [cheering]
[2:30:42] YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FIXING TIM
[2:30:45] THROUGH IT. HE'LL FIX IT. [applause]
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hopelessness says it'll never change,
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; but Jesus said, "The spirit of the Lord
[2:30:57] is on me.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; He hath anointed me."
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. To bring deliverance to the
[2:31:03] captives.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; Don't fear. Here, here's a word from the
[2:31:07] church age book. Don't fear little
[2:31:09] flock.
[2:31:10] All I am your heir to. All my power is
[2:31:13] yours. My omnipotent is yours. As I
[2:31:16] stand in your midst, I have not come.
[2:31:19] Oh, listen. I have not come to bring you
[2:31:21] fear and failure, but love and COURAGE
[2:31:24] AND ABILITY. ALL POWER IS GIVEN UNTO me
[2:31:27] and it is yours to use. YOU SPEAK THE
[2:31:29] WORD AND I will perform it. This is my
[2:31:31] covenant and it will never fail.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; So when the light of God's forgiveness
[2:31:40] and that he's declared you righteous
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; and holy, when that breaks through the
[2:31:46] darkness, that's when joy returns.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; And the joy of the Lord is your
[2:31:51] strength.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we reason.
[2:32:02] And this is one of the devil's most
[2:32:04] deceptive weapons.
[2:32:07] Human reasoning that exalts the
[2:32:10] intellect
[2:32:12] above revelation.
[2:32:15] And it says it doesn't make sense.
[2:32:23] Well, you're not alone.
[2:32:25] There's a lot of things in life don't
[2:32:27] make sense.
[2:32:32] That's why we sing we'll understand it
[2:32:34] better by and by.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Because all we see is from this human
[2:32:39] perspective.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; We don't see God's great plan.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; Because you know sometimes, you know, we
[2:32:47] have this human reason that exalts
[2:32:50] intellect above revelation says it
[2:32:53] doesn't make sense. But that's when
[2:32:55] faith says nevertheless at thy word.
[2:32:59] Amen.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; It don't make sense.
[2:33:03] Peter said, "I fished all night and
[2:33:05] caught nothing."
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; There ain't nothing. I I DID IT ALL. I I
[2:33:10] TRIED I TRIED EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME TO
[2:33:12] TRY. IT DON'T MAKE SENSE.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; But nevertheless,
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; at thy word,
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; I'll let down the net.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the next nets begin to break
[2:33:25] with fishes. But you see that's where
[2:33:29] reason argues for revelation just obeys.
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; You you SEE THE BIBLE SAID TRUST IN THE
[2:33:37] LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND LEAN not to
[2:33:40] your own understanding. And there's only
[2:33:42] one way to do it and that's tear him
[2:33:43] down.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT argue a stronghold DOWN. YOU
[2:33:46] CAN'T OUTTHINK THE DEVIL. So I I wanted
[2:33:49] you to quit your stinking thinking.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. CAST DOWN. CAST IT DOWN BY THE
[2:33:56] AUTHORITY OF THE WORD AND THE BLOOD OF
[2:33:59] JESUS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU OVERCOME BY
[2:34:01] THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB AND BY THE WORD OF
[2:34:03] YOUR TESTIMONY.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; So take every lie,
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; take every reason
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; and bring it captive to Christ.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; And do more than just cast it down.
[2:34:14] Replace the devil's lie with God's truth
[2:34:18] until your mind is renewed and your
[2:34:21] faith is free.
[2:34:30] I know.
[2:34:34] I'm going to try this. I don't know
[2:34:35] it'll work.
[2:34:39] So, let the musicians come.
[2:34:43] I don't know if that'll help me stop
[2:34:44] preaching or not,
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; but I know
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; that many of you came to Christ, you was
[2:34:54] thinking the fight would be over,
[2:34:58] [crying]
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; that salvation would mean a rest
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; from temptation.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; But instead, you found yourself in
[2:35:08] another kind of war.
[2:35:11] Yes, sir.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; A war inside your mind
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; and you're weary from it all.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; And you'd love to never be tempted
[2:35:20] again.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; And you cry out, "Lord, when will this
[2:35:25] struggle ever end?" When will it, Lord?
[2:35:31] Well, it will end,
[2:35:33] but not till we leave this flesh. That's
[2:35:35] right.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; As long as you're in this flesh, you're
[2:35:39] going to fight
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; to the day you leave it.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; You know, the the flesh is going to lust
[2:35:46] against the spirit against the spirit
[2:35:48] against the flesh. There's going to be a
[2:35:49] holy war
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; that's going to wage within you.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; And you know where we got this flesh? We
[2:35:56] got it from our first birth.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; We were born in sin. We were shaved in
[2:36:00] iniquity.
[2:36:02] And your soul's been redeemed and washed
[2:36:04] in the blood, but you still live in a
[2:36:05] body
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; that's under the curse.
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; And Satan will anoint that body. It
[2:36:12] senses its appetites to war against the
[2:36:14] spirit that dwells in you. And your
[2:36:16] flesh isn't saved.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; But one glorious day it will be.
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:29] Philippians 2:3 and verse 20 says, "For
[2:36:32] our conversation, the way we live is
[2:36:34] from heaven, from whence we also look
[2:36:38] for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:36:40] WHO SHALL CHANGE OUR BOWED BODY,
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; that it may be fashioned like his own
[2:36:46] glorious body.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; Think of it now. A new body, a body
[2:36:51] that's never been defiled by sin.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; A body that an evil thought can never
[2:36:56] enter. YES.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; A BODY THAT I NEVER NO FEAR.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; THAT I NEVER FEEL LUST,
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; THAT I NEVER TASTE JEALOUSY, THAT I
[2:37:05] NEVER BURN WITH ANGER.
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; Just peace.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; Wonderful peace
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; flowing like a river from the throne of
[2:37:14] grace.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; And until that day, the battle may rage,
[2:37:20] but I want to remind you, I'm declaring
[2:37:23] to you this morning, the victory is
[2:37:25] already won. Amen.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; You were not called to be defeated.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; You were called to overcome.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; CAST DOWN THOSE STRONGHOLDS.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; TAKE THEM DOWN. TEAR THEM DOWN.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; AND REPLACE IT with the word of God.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; March forward with the sword of the
[2:37:43] spirit
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; and say, "I'm going through, Jesus.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going through.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; No matter what others do, I'm pressing
[2:37:52] on the upward way. I'm climbing higher
[2:37:56] every day. I'm leaving behind this world
[2:37:58] and all it is. And every day I'll fight
[2:38:01] the battle.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to start today with a
[2:38:04] renewed mind,
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; a cleansed mind, a mind to set on
[2:38:08] Christ. The word has COME TO SET MY
[2:38:12] THOUGHTS ON Jesus Christ and knowing I
[2:38:15] can prevail.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[2:38:28] No, it's not the millennium. It's not a
[2:38:30] perfect world. This is a broken world.
[2:38:33] In this fallen world,
[2:38:36] people wound one another.
[2:38:39] But in a world like this, God still
[2:38:42] heals.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; God still restores.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you've been through.
[2:38:49] And maybe I don't know what you've been
[2:38:51] through. Maybe maybe you don't even want
[2:38:53] to tell anybody what you've been
[2:38:54] through. Maybe nobody should know what
[2:38:56] you've been through.
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; My daddy was an abuser. My mama was an
[2:39:04] alcoholic. My grandfather was immoral.
[2:39:07] That's the way I am. The way I am.
[2:39:12] You don't have to be.
[2:39:17] You can't keep going through life
[2:39:19] blaming why you are what you are
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; because of what other people have done
[2:39:25] and said
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; or even what you've done or said.
[2:39:32] God's going to give rising up a people
[2:39:34] right now
[2:39:38] who will say
[2:39:40] right now,
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; right now I'm not going to let my past
[2:39:45] define who I am.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; Right now, I'm quitting. I'm stopping
[2:39:51] the thoughts of unbelief in my heart, my
[2:39:53] mind. And I'm going to get my mind
[2:39:55] stayed on Christ because great peace
[2:39:57] have they, you know, that whose mind is
[2:40:00] stayed on Christ.
[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; Get it on Jesus.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; And forget those things that are in the
[2:40:08] past.
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; Well, my daddy died when I was young. My
[2:40:13] my mother abandoned me. My this
[2:40:15] happened. This happened. You know, junk
[2:40:18] happens. This is not the millennium.
[2:40:20] Horrible things happen. If you've had a
[2:40:22] good childhood, thank God for it.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; That won't be your trial, but you'll
[2:40:27] have another.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, you may not be able
[2:40:33] to change your childhood.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; You may not be able to rewrite your
[2:40:37] past.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; You may not be able to undo your pain.
[2:40:43] But you can refuse to let it define you.
[2:40:49] So I want you to do what the Bible said.
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; Forget those things which are behind
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; and I want you to reach unto those
[2:40:57] things which are before and say today I
[2:41:01] press toward the mark
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; toward the goal of a higher calling.
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm tearing down the strongholds in
[2:41:09] my mind
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to rule. Let the God of
[2:41:12] peace rule in my mind from this day on.
[2:41:16] I'm taking control of those demon
[2:41:18] thoughts
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; and I'm casting them down
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; right now. While I've been preaching,
[2:41:25] Satan's been running.
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; He has been cast out. He has strongholds
[2:41:30] have been torn down. Deliverance has
[2:41:32] started happening in the house of God.
[2:41:34] And right now already you feel lighter.
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; You feel unburdened. [applause]
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; JOY IS [cheering] RETURNING. STRENGTH IS
[2:41:43] RETURNING. GLORY IS RETURNING. POWER IS
[2:41:46] RETURNING BECAUSE WHY? YOU'VE GOT A
[2:41:49] RENEWED MIND. YOUR MIND IS NOW SET ON
[2:41:52] CHRIST. [cheering] GO WALK IN THAT. GO
[2:41:54] BELIEVE IN THAT. [applause]
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; Accept what he said about you
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; and love him with all your heart. In
[2:42:03] moments like these, I sing out a song.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; How could you not love him? Amen.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; How could you not love him?
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; Can you sing [music] from your heart
[2:42:26] in moments
