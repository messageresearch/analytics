deliverer he's our soul savior amen we want to welcome you today in the name of the Lord Jesus what a privilege it is to serve the Lord together come together Gather in his name man I look back there see a dear friend sister Karen Schultz that is here longtime friend I've known known them back from the early days and brother and sister yeski is here and that's Nathan's parents we're happy to have them we have brother Kenny mcki God bless you and the church family they're with you all the way from Connecticut and uh they got got a long ways to drive back home today uh in the next few days so may the Lord be with them brother brother Kenny and I we uh play together as children you it's a quite an incredible moment that we stand here together today under the same roof and thinking about many years ago uh living in Boer city right next to streetport his father was in the Air Force my dad dad was a homebuilder and and they lived right around the corner from us um and uh lived in our neighborhood and you know we we played together as children um I think we even probably were together in the same meetings there and when um later on in brother bram's meetings was you there on the wings of a dove too yes yeah okay so we were we were all there say he say sister Janie first cousin and and uh my I tell you you know I I think about those moments in time and where we were there and and seeing the spirit of God move in such a tremendous way give Vindication to message that's coming I tell you you know we are a privileged people this morning to be able to stand here and we bear witness amen that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that he hadn't left us alone it was in that in those streetport meetings sister Janie was a young girl she was living in Hinesville with her mother I think a cheerleader in high school had a sweetheart Kenny Camp uh who's a football player you know uh all of that you know coming up and got invited to come to the meetings by I her uncle Carlton MC other Kenny's father and attended there was there with us in that meeting brother Jim Morgan he's not here today but he's traveling home he was also in that meeting and uh you know we we're just Witnesses of things that God Did In Our Generation brother brother Kenny here would live right down from us my mother for Halloween would always put tracks in a sack you know for all for the trick-or treats it was a treat she put out a treat not a trick but she put out things like wheel of Prophecy pointing to one God and different things like that and I'm sure your family got a hold of some of them um you know it it it was it was there that God would lead his family from the Church of Christ movement into the Full Gospel and then on into the message recognized God sending a prophet and and uh you know it it's it's moments you know that are like this that cement our faith together and sister Jeanie was in the prayer line and there just to show you the grace of God and the power of forgiveness that was a she knew nothing about it she was a Methodist girl and knew nothing about um anything to do with a prophet or message or and just kind of got introduced to it and taken to the meeting to see this prophet of God and got invited into a a prayer line got a prayer card and stood there in the prayer line and she had as a young girl had picked up the habit of slipping around smoking and about two or three ahead of her in the prayer line was a woman and brother brandom stopped her and said you're Desiring a great thing you want a baby but if you'll give up those cigarettes and repent of that got to give you that baby and you know just three more down the line or so here comes Jeanie and she's praying God whatever you do don't let that man tell that my mother what I've been doing forgive me I didn't know how wrong this was and you know it never was called out you know why you cannot call out sin when it's been placed under the blood amen it don't take fancy prayers it takes one moment of believing God and God will forgive you and remove your sins as far as the East is from the west and not even a prophet could go back in your life and bring it out that's how great God's grace is amen so it's just good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and worship together and I I want us to sing the song is Jesus on the inside working on the outside want you turn around shake hands with those that are around you and in and just welcome them to the house of the Lord As we sing this together amen we're so happy to have each one of you well it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a changes in my life it's Jesus on inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life well is Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life oh what [Applause] change is in my life one more time now well is Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh want to change in my life it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life will Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life and know what A change is in my life let's give the Lord a [Music] hand oh Hallelujah that just makes me feel good on the inside amen knowing Jesus dwells on the inside working on the outside amen if you don't see him on your outside he ain't on the inside got to be on the inside working out amen I tell you why I like that so much I'm going to sing it again well it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life it's Jesus on the inside working on on the outside oh what a change in my life it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside for what a change in my life I know change is in my life amen if you turn to 2 Kings chapter 2 we're going to read from verse 9 and let's let us just stand for the reading of the word this morning to honor him next Sunday we're going to have communion in foot washing I also want you to remember in the offering coming up um to to take out an envelope and write it write it on your check we want to take up something also for the Japan missions we have enough to um to take care of another um another six or eight more sermons of brother branham's there we started out in that country there was nothing in the Japanese language we now have um nearly 650 sermons that have been translated into the Japanese language and we want to see um you know that con continued as we uh we see now there's a we have by God's grace there's a church there now in Japan several now smaller work workers works as well that are that are moving forward so um we want to encourage them by feeding them amen so uh if you'll remember that just take out an envelope of any kind tie envelope write on it Japanese offering you know and and send it there and we'll we'll be sure to help get the message translated and uh God has blessed us with that in a tremendous way with Google translate we get it translated just needs proofreading but it still takes some funds to get that done and and you remember on one of the trips over there God provided us a translator and uh we want to certainly make that um available for the Believers there so uh God bless you as you serve the Lord together these things go on the message Hub and people Japanese people from around the world can read them not just in Japan but wherever they are in the world if they're in America if they're in South America where Africa wherever they are they can read these sermons in their language so it's a tremendous Thing 2 Kings chapter 2:9 and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of my spirit be upon me and and he said thou H has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I'm taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them aunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them into two pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoked the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had also smitten in the waters they parted hither and thither and Elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah does rest on elishah and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before Him Father take these words today bless him to our hearts Lord we draw from inspiration from the strength as we look to your promise in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated today I'm going to speak to you on Elijah and Elisha restoration and the double portion now all we need to do is look at Elijah and Elisha as a prophecy to know what we must do for both are a prophecy of of the end time remember when we look in the scripture we do not look at them as just a historical event or a story in the Bible but we look at it as something that is prophesying of the end time as we believe there is a bride in this last day that is going to fulfill um all righteousness and all that has been spoken of a bride and this is of course why brother Brandon preached the great message of Christ the mystery was was to show the coming of Christ and his Redemptive plans and and it was shown to the lives of men and women of the Old Testament now you know men like Abraham did not realize they were prophesying they were living a life and and maybe they didn't even understand why they did what they did but it had to be written in the scripture be you know even the story of his of his lie where he lied to ailec it had to be written in the scriptures so we would know that that that um when he when he a then took her Sarah for a wife that we could see a young king or a man taking this woman beautiful something had to happen to a 90y old woman transformation power had to have taken place and so we can see in there you know in the prophecy of body chains we can see in in the prophecy um the promised son that had been waited on a long time being given I and I tell you I I believe it's about time for this 2,000 year old bride to give birth to the Son of God for the Jesus Christ The Promised son to come and so God used the Old Testament to forhad of the new and and then he uses even the New Testament to prophesy of the end time is the whole Bible is actually pointing to our day and our hour in this time of visitation now Isaiah prophesies you know that in the last days that the moon shall be as the light of the Sun and the Moon represents the bride the wife to the Son and the light of the sun will be as a combination of seven days so all the light of the church Jesus will be our light making the moon the bride the same as Christ Christ was in the beginning you will find that in Isaiah 30 and verse 26 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be Sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of the people and health The Stroke of their wound now according to Revelation 101 he comes and his face is shining in full strength you see this is the day not of the veiling of God but of the unveiling of God where God is coming as a shining light on the scripture that has been held in obscurity that has waited for this end time now as we look into the prophecy we actually see Elijah brought a drought upon the kingdom of Jezebel and I'm calling it that because Ahab was only a figurehead she ran the show and brought terrible idolatry and false worship to Israel and at Mount carel Elijah brought a showdown he was showing that the gods of Jezebel were powerless they were powerless idols and he would do this by demonstrating the power of God this this would this in itself would be part of what helped turn the hearts of of the children of Israel back to God again this same thing had to be done in the days of Moses Moses could not walk out with a message and even say well I met an angel out there a pillar of fire and have no Vindication amen but God would send signs and and and wonders and whatever to identify a message and his messenger and so at Mount caral Elijah brought this showdown and and and in doing so before he would before the fire fell before the worship was accepted he would first a restorer He restored the altar the altar that had been torn down the stones that had been left and disarrayed that was discarded amen and so he was restored could we say a mystery truth he rebuilt the place of worship he put the stones back in the proper order the sacrifice in his proper place and then the fire of God came down and consumed it showing God had accepted it these Stones must be in order the altar rebuilt scattered truths and loose ends had to be gathered like Elijah he dug out and dusted off the stones and rebuilt the altar of God the seventh angel we know does the same Revelation 10:7 if you'll put that up for me the the seventh angel gathers them up and finish fin es the entire mystery that's what the Bible says he finishes The Mystery of the written book so Revelation 107 said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets actually all of the word has been declaring this end time it has been pointing to our day and to our hour amen so all the scripture whether it's the types of Esther whether it's the types of Ruth whether it's is these are not stories but prophecies in the Bible pointing to our day to our hour and we we see like even the mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven that Jesus talked about which is life under the rule of Christ and that only comes by a true baptism of the Holy Ghost and so you know it would be in parables it would be it would be written symbolically it would be told about like wise and foolish virgins now you may wonder about whether you know the kingdom of God or the Kingdom of Heaven there's really no significance different one phrase emphasizes God is The Sovereign ruler of the Kingdom the other emphasizes the kingdom itself but they're the same Kingdom and the Kingdom of Heaven is life in the Holy Ghost true conversion Enders you into the rule of Christ you come under his government the kingdom of God the Bible said is not meat and drink but it is righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost so the kingdom of God is righteousness in the Holy Ghost peace in the Holy Ghost joy in the Holy Ghost amen the so the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost and unless you're born again and you cannot see or understand the kingdom of God Jesus would speak in Parables he would actually read parables are symbology in the Bible in the Book of Revelation that would be left for the last day people to understand this book of Revelation would be written years after the Apostle Paul was gone Paul never refers to the Book of Revelation it was written but it was all in symbols it was left and not understood it was Mysteries that was not revealed but it was things that were left for an end time people amen that when the time came it would be pertinent to them amen there would be an understanding come there would be a wise Who would know their God and who would do exploits amen so you see these as Jesus said in Matthew 13:11 he he answered and said it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given so we know then some is given to some is not given to but God has given to us to know the mysteries of the Kingdom you can know the mysteries of the Kingdom young people is not over your head it's not something Beyond you it's given to you you to know you're are predestined people for an end time for truth to be revealed amen and this truth is a sacred truth that is revealed and it brings a liberty with it it brings a freedom from and from bondage from the chains of of the Creeds of man from the from the doctrines and the ideas of theologians and it breaks those chains and it sets you free it sets your Fe about a solid rock these restored mystery truths include God being one not two or three amen it includes water baptism by immersion taken on the name of Jesus Christ I'm just going to be very brief here it it it goes into the baptism of the Holy Ghost not as a sensation but the Life of Christ within you performing the Greater Works it it it it produces the security of the believer not this once saved always saved no matter how you live but sealed to the day of redemption Satan sealed out and you sealed in with him so you see it's not an in and out not an anointing that comes and goes but it is the spirit who abides with you forever amen and the proof of it is that it governs and it rules your life it leads you into truth it opens up your understanding it changes your life it sets you free from sin it gives you victory in your life it gives you understanding that only God can give amen and you're sealed to the day of your Redemption and there's nothing no nothing no tribulation no trial no problem no devil no nothing can never separate you from that love of God Amen for you are sealed in with him and the devil sealed [Applause] [Music] out not only that but we're predestined predestinated and chosen from before the foundation of the world as a gene of God you are his offspring you are son Sons and Daughters of the most high God and this brings us this brings us to an understanding this brings us to an understanding of Eternity it Maks us to realize that God is the only one that has immortality 1 Timothy 6:16 the Bible says of him who only have immortality amen there there is no Immortal Life in hell so hell is not Eternal that's right amen there is an eternal fire but not an eternal hell to make it Eternal would be make it equal with God it would make it in equal to Heaven hell is not an equal to Heaven There is no one lives eternally in Hell life there is temporary the soul that Sinners shall die it may burn forever and ever however long millions of years I don't know but it comes an End Amen to make it Eternal would make it equal with God people don't have eternal life in Hell God only is eternal Hallelujah and when you realize you're a Son of God you always were you didn't just begin at an altar somewhere or the day you were born here but you were there in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and there's nothing can ever remove you from God's mind you are his offspring and I got news for you not one of his children will ever be in Hell Hallelujah hell was not created for you hell was created for the devil and his angels amen here's another history that Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen the same in every detail I said the same in every detail except he's not here in the Corporal flesh of Jesus but is here in the form of his body his bride the elect lady so Jesus is here this morning he's walking upon the Earth in a people his spirit is manifested in flesh his word has has taken on flesh so there is the mystery of the church who is the true bride the wise virgin who is separated from the foolish group who goes through tribulation they both have different Destinies the bride is raptured and the other goes through the tribulation for purging so it's written in the types Enoch walked with God the seventh from Adam and here we are the seventh from the the Church age from from Calvary from the F from the second Adam Jesus Christ are you with me and Enoch was the the seventh from Adam and he walked with God let me me remind you walk is a progression it's not a one and done it's Keep On Walking it's go higher it's reach for higher rounds it's adventures with God hallelujah it's going from glory to glory amen I want you to think of this now and and here and so he's tip by Rapture he was not for God took him but there was a church eight of them that went through the tribulation come out on the other side now remember again you know it's written in the Bible there was there was Abraham who was called out and elected and chosen never never part of Sodom but then there was lot who was called out of Sodom there was a CH there is the true bride the Church the true church the church is a bride and the Bride is a church brother Bram said there's been churches churches churches but there's got to come one who's a real bride who's the real church and I believe the message of this hour produces something real amen amen and so lot would go through the tribulation be saved by out as it was by fire but here Abraham never goes through that instead he receives a visitation his body is changed he receives the promised son it's all written in the types we don't have to make it up we can just look at the script and we can see we're part of the script amen here's another part the mystery of iniquity starting with the serpent seed and the fall of Man until the last age where Satan is the God of this evil evil age worshiped by millions Satan has s succeeded in sitting in the temple of God and worshiped as God he has a bride Satan does she's myy babblin the great the mother of harlots amen so he has concubines as well you see there there is other Mysteries that are laying there for example The Mystery of the Seven Stars representing seven Messengers anointed by the seven spirit of God which is one God manifested in seven different ages and and there the these ages the these ages cover the entire Gentile dispensation there's a mystery of the return of the pillar of fire now you said brother why are you going there because we've had an Elijah in this day who gathered up the up the stones discarded truths and build an altar hallelujah amen what did he do he didn't go up and write a new Bible he didn't have to go outside of the Bible didn't even have to make a new version of the Bible took this very King James version and made it Live come on church amen so you see here again the the the the these ages cover the entire Gentile dispensation and I just say there's seven of them not eight not nine not another to rise up not another age to come amen I tell you what you get outside of the seven you get outside the lamb he has seven horns seven eyes seven Messengers Seven Ages not an eighth not another messenger amen we we have come down through it and I tell you if this message don't turn your heart back if this Elijah Ministry don't return you back restoration there ain't nothing else coming it'll do it everything else is a gimmick and I just say to them get in line you'll take a number get in line I've seen many comes and many go so you see the the mystery the mystery of of the the of these truths that God has restored in this day the m of the return of the pillar of fire of whom alone is the source of all Revelation that some The Mystery of the return of the pillar of fire of whom is the alone is the source of all Revelation and true understanding it's the same one who revealed the word to Paul is the same one today who revealed God's word to the prophet we are not following the men and there theology we're not even following Brother brandham We are following the pillar of fire amen you see yeah there was a physical man like Moses that walked out and was anointed but God said I have come down I have come down to deliver I you know it's my hand I may use Moses I may he may be the voice I use he may be the the the the the messenger that I use but it isn't Moses message he got his message from a pillar of fire and we're not following anything but a pillar of fire the same Pillar of Fire that led the per all the way through it's the same Pillar of Fire Hallelujah that would deserve the heart of that woman that was in front of sister jeie and so it was the word the son of man Christ the pillar of fire manifesting [Music] himself the same Wonder revealed to his word to Paul the same one today Paul said I had to count everything I learned as dung that's I got taught by Gia he was a good teacher but I had to count it as Dum that I might win Christ you know there's people don't understand why God would choose you know a man uneducated a seventh grade Kentuckian why would he choose that why wouldn't he choose one well where do you want him from Bob Jones or you don't like Bob Jones well then you want him from this one and this denomination want he from the God said I'm not using any of them I'm going to take a man that don't know nothing so I can teach him something a seventh grader that when he starts out you know his wife has to read he read the Bible and said oh yeah yeah you you just take what it says cuz he couldn't read it amen but but you see it would it would be that wise so we didn't have something that was leaning on somebody body's understanding amen even brother bam when that comes to the opening of the seals he said you know it wasn't me he said I was about to go back and and and write some things down of what different other theologians said that's the best I figure you know maybe they're right I was about to go out with that about that time he came in the room and those Revelations that came a from that ball of fire that came in that room and revealed this to me you say oh brother Tim that's that's a that's a baloney that's just hog was that's the way he did it to Paul amen that's the way he did it to Moses that's the way he did it all through the Through the Ages am 3 and S says surely the Lord God will do nothing except he Reveals His secrets to his servants the prophets and I tell you he don't need any help he don't need somebody else to come long and bring Clarity he don't need somebody else to straighten up the Altar and rearrange it to their taste God did it the way he wanted it he sent a messenger that he was not ashamed to be identified with people get offended because of the picture of brother brandham and the pillar of fire that we have in the church right there as you as you go out I'm not offended by that God wouldn't offended to take his picture with him that's not just a picture of brother Brandon that's a picture of the Angel of the Lord and I'm not ashamed of the Gospel amen so there there is a mystery of the seven sealed voices of Thunders who when was when was heard and the understanding given revealed the mysteries of the Seven Seals this is what brother brandom said question answer 64 he said have the they asked him have they been revealed and he says yes that's what the the the Seven Seals that's what they they're the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was all about we don't need somebody else to come along and tell us what the Thunders mean amen the man who heard the voice told is what they mean amen it was his job the job of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 to reveal those mystery truths to the church and I want to just say this day this scripture is fulfilled we're not waiting on it to be open to our understanding it's already been given it didn't take me or another preacher to rise up amen God did it the way he wanted it he said it the way he wanted it right the m of the spirit of Elijah who has come to bring full restoration and full Redemption these Mysteries Encompass the opening of The Seven Seals necessary to open the book to us I want to assert to you today that the book is no longer closed the mystery of God has been revealed The Silence has been broken truth that were misunderstood and misplaced placed correctly that's right it took a man with vision a prophet with vision I use this analogy often but remember you know that I I think of it sometime as 10 Blind Men Who were trying to describe an an elephant and one got a hold of the of the of the of the legs and said an elephant is a big tree trunk that's what he is that's an elephant another said nonsense he's got a hold of the Tusk said it's a shiny you know it's a very slick hard thing that ends with the point if you don't got my Revelation you're blind another blind man walks up and grabs a tail said no boys you're all wrong is a rope you see each one of them we could go on down each one of them had a part that's right but they couldn't see the whole picture until eyes came open it took a sear in this day to give us the whole picture and it's not just a tail and it's not just a lag and it's not just a tus it's the whole thing and it shows us the picture from Genesis to Revelation and the bright portion in the last day it's the same as it was in the in the Book of Daniel when handwriting was written in symbols on the wall and people saw it and people read it but they couldn't understand it and theologians and magicians came and they read it and they guessed at it and they pondered at it and probed got it but nobody could get it right until the Prophet Daniel came on the scene right amen and when Daniel walked out he said he wrote and he said it's all in symbols here's what it means the mystery is now revealed I tell you our truths are not longer no longer just symbols to us anymore it's not buried in Parable it's not hidden in symbology it has now been revealed but Isaiah said the people in the last day would be drunken and the Book of Revelation said they would be drunken with the wine of Babylon the wine of the great whor and Revelation the wine of her fornication and they would not remember alcohol wine it distorts the vision next thing you're looking and there's not one God there's three of them and you see the truth of it becomes sealed and this is what has happened down to the ages that's misunderstandings and misconceptions and the trick of the enemy coming in as a subtle Spirit as a white horse rider he comes in to ride and bring in a seed of discrepancy and he begins to distort the truth and Men begin to drink their wine men like Luther would raise up and say and this Vision clear a little bit the just shall live by faith and go back to seeing three Gods why it was it was still SE to them the Mysteries wasn't made known but that's not us Isaiah 29 in verse n said stay yourselves and wonder and cry out and cry they're drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink but look here's what it is in other words not literal wine or literal alcohol but the Lord had poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and has closed your eyes and the prophets and the rulers and the seers has he covered and the vision of all is become to you as words of a book that is sealed which men delivered to one that has learned a great Theologian and says you know what we really don't want to know what this means I I I can't understand it's it's sealed up it's a mystery god holds and I I don't know what it means and so then the book is delivered to him that's not learned in said read this and says I I I'm sorry I hadn't been to Bible school I'm not learned I don't know what this means wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouths and with their lips do honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men look this is why this derision this this cross Vision this this depthness of ears is because things have been taught by the precept of men therefore I will proceed to do a marvelous work among the people even a marvelous work and a Wonder for the wisdom of their theologians and their wise men Shall Perish and the understanding other their prudent men shall be hid but it don't end there for us because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom and then with all of the Revelation and things that God is revealing and making known and and proven now that this is not just something probed at and guessed at but this is now a revelation from God then comes the most important sermon that came because of the seals open the supernatural Supreme token you see the proper sacrifice you see Elijah did not just build an altar and there's no sacrifice amen he actually put and placed upon the altar the lamb and its blood and Christ Jesus and His holy spirit must be the center of our worship why did you say it like that Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit I'm not talking that they're two different beings I am talking about that one one is Christ Jesus the word and the and then the blood which is the spirit are you seeing are you understand what I'm talking about the life of the blood what came back on the day of Pentecost was the blood of God it was the Holy Spirit where the blood cell was broke out out open open at Calvary and out flow the Holy Spirit and I want you to understand that here the Elijah this day places the sacrifice the blood the life upon the truth the Holy Spirit must go with the word or it's not a proper sacrifice you see Christ Jesus the Holy Spirit must must be the center of our worship the token the true baptism of the Holy Ghost must be the focal point of our worship amen blood's got to get all over every one of those stones amen if the Life of Christ don't come on him it's just a it's just a a dead word to you it's got to cover it now listen you know true worship cannot revolve just around beautifully laid stones or mystery truth true worship must be the lamb or it must include the lamb and his blood the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost must be in the church it's like blood of the spirit on every stone of Truth and then what guess what God comes down in the pillar of fire to vindicate it as he consumes and that therefore proves that he accepts every doctrinal stone and the offering of the Lamb that's why we preach the restored truths of the Bible we preach a Bible Jesus a Bible Holiness a Bible Doctrine and the fire Must Fall so that the works that Jesus did we do also and when we preach a Bible Jesus and a Bible Doctrine then the fire falls and when it happens people are healed filled to delivered amen that's in spirit and in truth sir amen and you know you you said well we got the truth well where's the spirit said well I got the spirit where's the truth it has to take both of them it takes two wings to fly sir you can't clip one and and expect to get off the ground you'll never make it out now in the Days of Elijah he looked out in the sky looked like brass Divine judgment was all over the country and there was no rain God said I'll Smite the Earth with a curse but I'm going to send Elijah first to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers amen then Elijah brings the rain let's go let's go down to First Kings 18:43 and he said to his Ser go up go up and look toward the sea and he and he went went up and looked and said there's nothing he said go again seven times and it come to pass at the seventh time then he said behold there arises a little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said well go up and say to Ahab but prepare thy Chariot get thee down that the rain stopped the not and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heavens was black with the clouds and the winds and there was great rain and Ahab rode and went to Je jez now here we are we're here in the seventh time the seventh age comes out of a cloud a sign in the heavens amen with seven angels bringing rain amen you say brother Tim uh we're looking for the latter rain well I hope you are seeing the latter rain this latter rain is what's producing a bride well one day there's going to be a move for on the bride no brother B and soul is an invisible Union the move is on for the bride th thus sayeth the Lord amen Hosea 6 and3 said if we follow on to know the Lord oh I say today that we might know the Lord let us press on to know him his going forth is prepared as the morning just as sure as the sun will rise the Sun of righteousness arises with healing in his wings Restoration in his wings and he shall come I want you to see yes we will meet him in the air that's what Believers believe but I want you to understand that part of his coming as he comes is the rain as the flatter rain and the fer reain both the teaching rain and the har rain upon the Earth and God will send him in the same season using the same messenger hallelujah amen brother we we're here you're waiting for it I know but it's already here you're talking about it's coming but it's already been here you say the bride's Revival the bride's Revival has been on ever since God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to Faith again amen we are the bride's Revival it's not coming it's here amen so look he said in Joel 2:23 be glad then you children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath given you the former rain moderately he will cause to come down to you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month I'm going to send them at the same same time amen and the floors shall be full of wheat amen what is that Harvest Time the grain that was planted the seed planted at Pentecost comes into maturity and the floors are full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil plenty of the Holy Ghost and I will restore to you here it is a message of restoration the year that the Locust eeden the cankerworm the caterpillar or the pmer worm or we can say the White Horse the red the black the pale amen and and the and which my Army that I sent on but here's the key thing I will restore I tell you what if I were you today I would get ready for Restoration in my life amen I believe this restoration is not just spiritually I believe it's also physically that you can enjoy the restoration power of almighty God he's a Healer he's a deliverer he's a soul savior he's everything you need he is the restorer he's a restorer of broken homes he's a restorer of broken lives I don't care how broken how decrepit you are in sin this God is a restoring God Amen I don't care if you tried once or twice or three times or four times or five my God the god of first chances Second Chances third chances fourth chances he never gives up he'll work on any seed till he brings them in his Spirit follows after them goodness and mercy follows them all the days of their life I tell you right now goodness and mercy is on the trail of your children on the trail of your husband your wives your family he's on their Trail he's not going to lose a one of his amen there names were in The Book of Life before the foundation of the world and they shall be there and their offsprings with them your children shall be blessed in the land this is God's word I'd say mama that's me I'd look at him to it and say that's my promise I wouldn't let go of that promise amen notice here and the brother bradam talks about about this he said don't you know the scripture must be fulfilled God has to appear in this last day to do the things he doing now it's to fulfill the scripture and it shall come to pass in the last days I will pour out my spirit that's the last 2,000 years that's what your Prophet said in the last days in the last days what does he do amen as he's been pouring out dips of the spirit down to the ages this day he empties it pours out his fullness and of his fullness we have received Grace upon Grace look at it now as he says and remember he said there be a former and a latter rain and in the latter rain both former and Rain would come together a double portion Hallelujah so then if we see what the former rain produced how much for the latter rain more the L lattering produced when God pours out his Spirit there be signs and wonders take place and he says when a omnipotent speaks miracles happen and I want you to know omnipotent has spoken amen and still speaks here Elijah would look out and and he would on the seventh time there would be a cloud a cloud appear the Bible said behold he cometh with clouds I see the cloud of his appearing of his coming spreading across the earth I want you to know everywhere it goes it restores amen dead grass comes to life again dead trees come to life they put on new leaves and those leaves clap their hands it raises up a people that worships God come on church amen the breeze is blow amen and as it does it it it shakes off the Dead Leaves and brings life again as it rains on you and restores you I say let it rain this morning let it rain throughout our congregation let it rain in your life let it rain in this church let the Holy Spirit breezes blow and just reach out toward God and wave your hands and say Yes Lord thank you for the rain thank you that the drought has been broken thank you that the drought that Jezebel caused through the church ages is broken and the truth of the word has been revealed and that we are in the hour of restoration hallelujah it's a rushing Mighty Wind of the Holy Ghost it's a cloud with seven angels showing the fullness of redemption showing the a making up the head of Christ he's revealing himself from heaven in this last days amen it's a teaching rain a harvest rain and the word seed is producing a word bride that's why brother bradam said look at the seeds that's been seed Baptist will produce more Baptists Billy Graham was a seed swerer a head planter for that and he P said or Roberts was a head planter for the Pentecostal but the word has also been SED hallelujah amen the word sown is produced a word bride we believe that God sent one in the power of Elijah as Malachi 4 said to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers that anointing was the spirit of Christ that anointing would be given five times for a specific Ministry of restoration Elijah restored the altar John the Baptist would turn the hearts to the Jewish fathers to receive the children Jesus and the apostles Elijah's promised to come again according to Malachi 4 to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers Amen in the in the tribulation of head the spirit of Elijah will come with the spirit of Moses representing the fullness of the law and the prophets and point the them to the the the 144,000 back to the true atonement all the while our Elijah pointed us back to the true atonement and away from traditions of man amen there will not be another Elijah to the Gentiles and let me just say all one man scriptures have been fulfilled yeah I know there's been many that have stood up to take brother bram's Place claiming his mantle because but that's just because of impersonators just like Janice and jambre with stood Moses you think about when brother brandham left went went forth after the Angel's visitation in the cave or the room or both hundreds of others men and women Rose proclaiming their own gift promoting their own healing campaigns every denomination had to have their own it it It produced a whole time of impersonations and then you know so we we had that and they all rose up and what they do you know they they they would steal the Limelight from what God was doing God was not just bringing healing and deliverance there was a changing of dispensations right amen there was a word to be revealed and God was vindicating a word like he did with Moses Moses walks out throws down a serpent or stick and it becomes a serpent hey you know magicians comes and does the same thing what are they doing stealing his Thunder we can do this too we got miracles too you don't have to listen to Moses message one was keeping them in Egypt one was delivering them from Egypt one was keeping them in denom ational system the other was delivering them out come on Amen see you had a host of impersonator do you know same thing happen when seven Mysteries are revealed by the coming of seven angels hundreds of others have risen with their own personal Revelations leading and pointing people to themselves creating their own cultist denominations nevertheless there's still a passing of the Baton in spite of all of that in spite of impersonators Rising there's still the passing of the Baton from Elijah to Elisha now I want you to notice right after this restoration right after the altar is built right after the lamb is is placed right after the fire falls of course we hear Elijah run into the wilderness you know wanting to like brother Bram talked about and standing in the Gap his own Ministry W just to go and forget it all nobody will hear my message but God sends him back and said listen you're not through that's right amen I want you to go out and call Elisha come on amen God sends Elija to anoint Elisha oh you say Elisha is going to be some man no all one man's scriptures have been fulfilled Elisha brother bam tells us very clearly is the holy spirit poured out the same thing what was Upon Jesus poured out again on the day of Pentecost and it comes up a body not one man so the Bible said in First Kings 19:19 Elijah passed by and cast his M on him amen the manle is the the outer garment it represents the anointing that enveloped and clothed the prophet you know his the outer garment like I just shed his coat and he just comes by and all he does is he walks over his I remember when that anointing touched me yes yes sir I remember that I remember there as as a 11-year-old boy in brother Brandon's meetings sitting on the edge of my seat wanting a asking for a Bible for my birthday in September and this would be November wanted my name wanted a suit and a tie is getting ready to preach 15 I I stood stood up and begin to preach they thought one time would cure me I ain't stopped yet that's been 54 years ago I ain't stopped yet somebody said you're going to run out of fire brother you're going to run out of passion you're going to run you're going to wear down I can't wear down there's a fire set up in my bones I have been touched and so of you I'm not alone the message come by your way and say this is for you Hallelujah you were touched by it something happened you couldn't help it brother Johnny it was in a Civic Center there in men there in special meetings there it the the Manel touched you you've never been the same it turned you from a denominational Christian and a son of God you've never been the same we can't be the same it changed your life hallelujah amen it's anointing the anointing that was on the word came on you it changed your perspective it changed your goals in life it changed who you thought you were and made you to know who God called you to [Applause] be Spirit of Elijah is not a human spirit it's the Holy Spirit given for the purpose of restoration and to do a specific work the mantle is symbolic of prophetic Authority when we receive a mantle from God it represents God given us empowerment represents he's given us an assignment notice I want to ask you today what is our assignment what have we been called to do to fulfill every word that's been spoke of a bride amen this is what God that we are anointing wanted to do don't we realize that we you know as Elijah Elisha types the bride that we too have been called out by name I don't know I don't know how you feel about your call but I know you know it's like I was in the in the many times in the airport and I would walk along and I would hear these announcement so and so meet your party so and so I didn't pay attention so and so go here so and so go go pick up the red phone and and and th so and so I never listened to none of it tuned it out walked right on but one day I heard my name called Tim it come to the phone you're to meet your party at a certain place we got instructions for you all of a sudden I turned around what what where's the phone where's it at my name was called you were going along you were bapti Methodist Presbyterian Catholic but this message called your name you could keep going the direction you were going God called your name and he turned you around you heard the voice this message identified you as a believer I'm not who I thought I was I'm a son or daughter of the Living God I've been chosen ordained for this hour [Applause] yes Wonder from that time on Elisha is doggedly following the prophet wherever he goes I'm not taking my eyes off of him whatever he preached that's what I preach wherever he goes That's what I preach whatever he says that's what I believe so do you understand I didn't say I understood everything I said I believe it all there's been many of things I had to lay on the Shelf until God let me know what it meant I'm not a know at all neither are you and this message don't make us know it alls it makes us Spirit L and God will even Hold Us blind the prophet said to things until the time that we have need of it amen so Elisha had to keep his eyes on Elijah to receive the double portion just as the The Church Must Keep Their Eyes On Jesus in order to receive the Holy Ghost you seeking the Holy Ghost you'll never do it looking over at the world you got to follow Jesus all the way you got to do it or you either you take an organizational life you just settle down to denominational life and warm a Pew God didn't call you to warm a Pew God called you to be Sons and Daughters led by the spirit of God oh for people led by the spirit of God I believe God leads I believe he still speaks God can use God can use what we might think or some might think is the most insignificant one maybe people that didn't have a perfect track record I'll tell you this last Tuesday I was in bed I couldn't walk on my foot it was like a toothache Old Dan Tucker was a fine old man he died with a toothache in his heel cuz he ComEd his hair with a wagon wheel I know what that toothache is in the heel I couldn't put my foot on my foot down just photically just grabed me I was laying there thinking what about my life what about my future what's going to happen what will happen next you know I don't know well I have to have a surgery doctor said that would be the Cure some trust in Horsemen some in bows and some but we trust in the name of the Lord I'm not afraid to use a bow ride a horse you I'm not ashamed to go to a doctor been many times but I'm not trusting in them I'm trusting in the Lord and I'm laying there in the bed and I'm thinking about my future what will I do you know well what what what will I do how how will it be how will life be I'm living alone my wife is not here to even bring me a drink of water you know what will I do I laid over on the bed and just was praying to the Lord and just dropped to sleep and the phone rang and a precious brother that I baptized here recently up in his 80s brother Bill Mayo called me moved by the spirit and he said brother Tim you have prayed for me he lives way down in Mobile around there and he said you have prayed for me and God has answered your prayers on several occasions but I'm calling today to pray for you so I want you to know you know I I believe you're God's servant I I tell you his word just so bathed over me it just healed me it just lifted my faith up and there he he prayed the most awesome prayer amen and it touched heaven and I got up from there without a bit of pain hallelujah amen God can use you follow his impulse follow his leadership you're not too little that God can speak to he here's a humblest heart maybe your track record isn't perfect but once in the blood it is maybe you can see your past but God can't maybe the devil reminds you of your past but God never will so you know it's the voice of the devil don't listen to him anymore you know you stand there and say I'm redeemed I am Blood Washed I am a son or daughter of the Living God I am BL by the spirit I am directed by the Holy Ghost I am a child of the most high God hallelujah hallelujah well brother Tim is that the only time you'll be tested by that no on Wednesday I had the same thing to take in my heel and they laying on the bed right right there at the same place studying Daryl Ward a brother writes me he said brother Tim you just come on my heart I'm praying for your feet right now another man led by the spirit I'm here today preaching on both feet take that devil the devil wants to disqualify the devil wants to you to put you down the devil wants to say bad things about you don't listen to him listen to the voice of God you're called You're elected you're chosen you're place you're ordained for this hour oh Hallelujah every individual comes to this journey as Elisha did just as a church advancing from Luther Wesley to isusa Street to the fullness of the word and the spirit now you know brother Brandon would use Elijah and Elisha's narrative to typify different periods in church history he would talk about Elisha following Elijah representing the church coming out of the Dark Ages Elisha following Elijah to the school of the prophets represents the second stage of the journey which is John Wesley's age Elisha following Elijah to Jordan represents the third stage of the journey which is a Pentecostal age and finally Elisha crossing the Jordan after receiving a double portion of Elijah's spirit and it represents the stage we are in which is the time of the supernatural we have entered into the final stage using this type brother random connects the empowerment to specific historical periods like it in Luther and Methodist erors to stages and Elis Journey to the Pentecostal age is crossing the Jordan finally an entrance into the time of Supernatural manifestation you can get this by just searching Elijah and Elisha you know as you look in the message search but I want to just say to you in your own personal Journey you can not remain at any stage whether it is justification or sanctification or a baptism an anointing that comes on your spirit but you must see him as when he sends the double portion the Holy Ghost Elisha is tested as you will be stay here the word like Elijah will encourage you to stay there but I want you to say stay there only long enough to get that stage thoroughly because when Elijah or Christ moves on offering you a greater experience get up and follow him as he said as the Lord liveth and my soul liveth I'll not leave Thee I like that a determination to hold on regardless of the price you move on you keep going on with God deeper waters deeper experiences more into the love of God there's no limit it's unlimited you got to have a passion for the things of God if you're a seeker of the Holy Ghost today you got to have a passion for it it's got to mean more to you than anything I must have Jesus I must have the spirit I don't want to live another day without it I don't want to go another moment without it you've got to have a passion amen I believe I believe that that that that's the true evidence of even the spirit of God in the person is one of the true evidences which is a passion a Zeal the Bible said to the Le oans be zealous be zealous to repent every time you see something in the word line up to it come on Amen but you see you got to have a passion for the things of God you know you you want to go in the Rapture in this day and you don't even have a passion to come to church when the doors are open you got some kind of denominational view that I can take it or leave it am man you're too busy it's too far to come too much effort I said those that hunger and thirst for righteousness shall be filled amen I'm not preaching against you folks that drove three hours today I understand you can't come on Wednesday nights I get that but them making that effort should be a shame for those who just take what we have for granted amen so you see it's a prerequisite for receiving anything from God I just can't overemphasize the importance of complete Devotion to Christ having an unwavering faith in his promises just like Elisha's unwavering focus on Elijah fix your eyes solely on Jesus forget the worldly distraction I I know I know it's important to you if who wins the presidency I know I know your ball game is so important I know I know other things gets all in in line listen it's Leo deia Rich increase with goods and have need of nothing get your eyes on Jesus forget all of that let the things of this world go strangely themm so there will be many that will go and follow him to bethl now remember in this sense you know it's not it's not our Elijah our our Prophet that's there at bethl but it's the holy spirit that we're we're talking about as he leads and he you go to Beth and he says you know and you you follow Elijah there and you learn its truths you're forgiven that's the first stage of the journey you're forgiven but and don't live in past failures you're not only forgiven listen a person can be pardoned but have done the wrong you are guilty just pardoned you see you did it and you're guilty you're pardoned but you're guilty but I want you to understand true justification as revealed by this message you are not only forgiven but you are declared righteous in fact to the matter is he said you never did it in the first [Applause] place well I know I did it brother Tim I know I yeah I did it I I was there I I did that wrong I liveed that kind of life but we're not talking about that we're talking about the first place that's right where was the first place in the mind of God before the foundation of the world he do see you as a sinner he don't see your mistakes he sees you as an overcomer Hallelujah he sees you rising up as a Morning Star giving light to a darken World saying he's coming you never did it in the first place his thoughts he had toward you was not of a sinner that's my son that's my daughter and he looks over in his family album when you're looking at your mistakes he looks at your family his family album and he looks over and he finds your name and says your picture and he took a picture of you when you were in your Perfection before the foundation of the world something you ain't even been yet Hallelujah Clon you have never been yet but in his mind he saw you perfect and he can't change his mind about you he's donees everything come from Calvary to make you perfect Hallelujah if you've been justified by faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ is a great place to be but don't stay there come on up to sanctification follow right on to the to to there to the next place to the school of the prophets you see a Sanctified life is good too good things happen there to be cleansed of old sinful habits stay there long enough to get set free amen if your nature isn't change you'll go right back like a dog to his vomit and a hog to swallow how often do we see people climb the statue of a perfect man to build a tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place and never reach the top where the individual and God are united together by the baptism of the Holy Ghost always backsliding because sanctification will not hold you without the Life of Christ well it's hard to live this message yeah without Jesus it's impossible oh yeah it's a hard life and you can you can be a pretty good homage message believer dress the part look the part but God didn't call you to be homish God called you to be Sons and Daughters of God filled with the spirit offsprings of his with power over the enemy behold I give you power over unclean things over every serpent come on somebody over every devil amen that you your prayers can make Satan fall like lightning from Heaven sir School of the prophets where prophets are made man-made not ordained of God where certain groups claim to be the place of worship you got to stay here you know belonging I want you to say this belonging to a fellowship is good belonging to a group has its merits but can you can you imagine can you imagine how Satan would like to use the Elijah message to build denominational walls many of them worse than their mother themselves saying oh only the maturity can can come through belonging to my group The Token can only be obtained by belonging to us the Rapture is only for us I want to tell you it's not a group Affair God God is not taking certain groups or certain sex or certain Cults in the Rapture it is an individual Affair you're not going because I go amen amen and let me tell you on the other hand I can't hinder you or stop you from going that's right amen you cannot go into Rapture because you attend this church we will not go in as a group we go in as individuals that's right how often brother Bram to tell us like the cattle drives that he used to work in said I used to work on the old tripod i' go hunting many times in Colorado in the springtime we'd ride out with the cattle they had a drift fence coming down the app rapo Forest we heard it with the Herford Association the gra the Troublesome River there's a ranger that was there he said there was all kinds of brands that went in from different Farms that would graze on this federal land they had grazing rights there's all kinds there so he didn't check to see what brand was on them amen they wasn't looking to see if they're coming from Tim PR's church or so and so's Church looking for one thing the blood tag amen you you can you can I hope you're not branded with elt but if you're wearing that brand if that's your brand that won't make you into heaven it won't get you in the Rapture God's not coming after a bunch of little Tim bruits he's coming after Sons and Daughters of God born by the spirit washed in his blood he said brother Brandon said the ranger was looking for the blood tag that had to be genuine Herford they had to be born of a pure lineage what is that pure lineage brother it's born as a son or daughter of the Living God where God is your father and you recognize you are his son God will not look for the brown what message Brown we are we are we are wearing he won't be looking to see if you attend my church he'll be looking to see where's the blood tack he'll be looking for Thoroughbred Christians that the life get this close that the life and the nature of Christ is in you Christ a mystery brother Bram in his presence in the individual with a personal Vindication of himself expressing himself The Living Word This Promise for the day expressing itself through you a Vindication of the great revelation of God look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual you get that not the Methodist not the Baptist not the Presbyterian not the Luther not the Pentecostals he's naming all these different Christian sects but as an individual I'll take one and leave one I'll separate them there'll be two in a field I'll take one leave one there'll be two in a bed I'll take one and leave one it's not a group it's a personal Vindication of an impregnated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care anything about anything else is the holy spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal Vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and to the world but you see it's like I preached last Sunday you know every group claims to be the Jerusalem where all men must come to worship but we're in the time all Jerusalem's are ceasing they're over with that's not God's chosen place of worship it's in Christ and you only get in him by one Spirit baptism without the Holy Ghost you're not in there so well I don't have the Holy Ghost you're not in there I got bad news for you don't have the ticket for the Rapture you're going to be left behind amen you see every you know God's chosen place of worship is in Christ and the only way in Christ is by one Spirit we are baptized not water baptism but by Spirit baptism we're baptized into one body so the only way in the church is not by joining it not even being born in a message group my daddy believed this my granddaddy I don't care what they was you got to be born again and I mean you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost that's what I mean but you see you see men want to sit in the place of worship and want preeminence and this is what has broke the message up into a thousand fragments is party spirits of I'm a Paul and I'm I'm a sephus and this brings us to Jericho the a Revival brought the church right up to the edge and and they spoke with tongues and prophesied so anointed on the spirit realm but often we're living backslidden lives can you imagine alcoholics often drunk in the Pulpit praying for the sick and seeing results happened with AA Allen I'm just saying to you don't get them just enough to jump and Shout that's right it's all right to jump and Shout I'm not preaching against that amen you know but don't just get enough to jump and Shout up and down the aisle go on across Jordan to death to South amen now on the other side of Jordan every promis LS and this is where you must go into the choken life the literal life of Jesus Christ brother why would you preach this because some people are at Jericho some people are at bethl some people are School of the prophets and and I want to say God moved there and that was a work of God and even in your life that was a work of God but it's not a place to stay follow the spirit it's going to lead you across Jordan it's going to take you amen where the double portion comes the Holy Ghost is somebody with me amen and brother bradam said oh brother Cross Jordan get on the other side the portion double portion of the holy spirit that was upon Christ Jesus was sent back to the church to minister and to carry on the work of until he come a little while the world seeth me no more yet you will see me I a personal pronoun will be with you even in you to the end of the world he's raised from the dead with this church tonight in spiritual form giving you every bit of the powers he had upon him here on the earth is handed over to the church to use and you're afraid to use it I wonder if you have taken the last step he didn't say it's not here he says you're afraid to use it that's the problem I just want to ask you why did why would brother Randon preach the token if it's unattainable it's the promised land be filled with the spirit amen it's the ticket to the Rapture without it you're not going well if we receive the spirit you know many will say well we we received the spirit when we were justified by faith and we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and no that was a work of the spirit justifying you that's where many are disappointed in this day well I believe the message well great that's only being able to read it makes sense you know brother brandham said that's good but you must have the token well I believe you brother brandham every a bit of it he said that's good but you must have the token why would he say you've got to have it and it's not available amen why preach something that is out of our reach why preach the most important message from since to open on the Seven Seals and you can't get it it's something in the future you see let me just say to you it's only in the future if you're back over in justification or you're over in sanctification well then it's in your future but for the church is not in our future is present it's how you get into the body could I just bear with could you bear with me just for a moment I I want to go with this for for some of you that that are stuck here because you know I'm preaching to all levels of people so you know you don't receive the Holy Ghost When You Believe believing is a confession made unto salvation in Acts 19 Paul met a bunch of Baptists and was and asked have you received the Holy Ghost sent you belief well we didn't know there was such a thing as the Holy Ghost well how was you baptized so then they re-baptized them in the name of Jesus Christ and laid hands on them and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spake in tongues and prophesied in Acts chapter 8 in Samaria there was a man by the name of Simon he was a sorcerer who made himself to be some great one claiming to have great Powers the great power of God but Bewitched them with sorceries and Philip comes along and he comes to Samaria and he preached Christ unto them and guess what in verse 6 of chapter 8 of Acts the people with one Accord gave he unto the things which which which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying out with a loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and were and many were taken with py and that were lame were healed verse 12 and the Bible said they believed Phillip preaching the things of the concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ now that's a good start yeah they believed Phillip I didn't say they believe the Bible said they believed but notice he said they believed preaching Philip preaching concerning the things of the kingdom of God the name of Jesus Christ and guess what they were water baptized and there's where many people stopped short in the message they accept the truths of it get baptized in water what more can I do will receive the Holy Ghost amen they were baptized both men and women then guess what the sorcer Simon himself believed I didn't say he believed the Bible said he believed that's right and he was baptized notice this and the Bible says in verse 14 that samarra received the word of God so they receive the message they believe the message they accept Christ and they were baptized is everybody with me and then the apostles heard that they had received the word they sent unto them Peter and John who come down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost well I thought they would have got the Holy Ghost when they believed when they had heard the word when they had accepted the message but that's not what the Bible said amen they had not received the Holy Ghost as he had fallen on none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so the Holy Ghost is an experience that comes after believing and then they laid hands verse 17 on them and they reive the Holy Ghost Verse 18 and then Simon saw through the laying on hands of the Apostle the Holy Ghost was given and he wanted to buy it I want this gift too and of course Peter said your money perish with you verse 21 thou Hast neither part or lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God wait a minute he believed and was baptized and his heart was not right in the sight of God yet he had believed and had B was baptized verse 22 repent therefore of this wickedness this is how to get the Holy Ghost repent turn from your way you you can believe it you can intellectually receive it but you God to believe it from the heart and repent and pray to God if he that the thought of thine heart may be forgiven the for I perceive that in Thou Art in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity yet he was a baptized believer Ephesians 1:13 says in whom you trusted after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom after that you believe somebody say after after you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise you see we're in the script and this is the promise that is given this is how to get into the body this is what is required in this last day so you see right there even in Luke 1730 before the burning and I'm trying to hurry this cramming a lot right now you know trying to get this thought down you know right now we're here in the sodomite age and it's a time where the son of man the ministry of Christ returns and we saw it what we saw was the ministry of Jesus Christ but it returns to anoint a bride people listen God's object of sending the message was not just to have a prophet that's right or to give us a new set of doctrines the mind the central thought of God has always been I want a bride I want a people they'll be for my name's sake they'll be in my image they'll be in my likeness I want a bride and the ministry of Christ has come to anoint a bride now Sur we can see the son of man Ministry was more than discernment as a boy I stood there watched him talk about and turn his back and call them out call call people out that I knew and that I knew he didn't know hear their testimony people I went to church with I am a witness I saw it I heard it but you see surely we can see the son of man Ministry was more than miracles and working of Miracles it was more than discernment and working of Miracles it was the nature and the life of Christ has returned to the bride's body amen producing a people that is one with the word hallelujah so you see as Elijah Elisha followed Elijah I want a double portion amen sometimes friend we're afraid there to ask for big things but Elisha wasn't ask afraid to ask God for big things amen I want a double portion Jesus Promised a double portion he said the works that I do shall you do also and greater than the say you do for I go to the father brother Brandon said in the message trial I challenge you to believe that the son of man is being revealed in the bride's body where is he being being revealed in Bride body amen the word taken on flesh Oh my he said he would go he said if churches come through justification Luther sanctification Wesley through baptism of the Holy Ghost Pentecost go right into the Perfection of the son of man when husband and wife will be the selfsame person amen God will be so manifested in his bride his church till they will be the same one they are one amen I want to tell you you are the continuation of the book of Acts and I'm talking about the Holy Spirit who wrote the book you are the continuation you are the continuation of the ministry of Christ that's what you're seeing right here Among Us it's the ministry of Christ amen it's God expressing himself in the fullness of the godhead deity to his church having preeminence in the church the anointed man now the anointed people Amen to bring back the anointed bride in the my anointed bridegroom hallelujah hallelujah the life of Jesus must be in you his nature his life amen all that he is God's Earthly strength amen his rule is upon his shoulders the government his rule in his body amen this is a bride coming of Christ Elijah is was gone but the spirit of Elijah is still here anointing Elijah I'm not talking about human Spirit but the spirit of Christ that's associated with Elijah elishah asked for the double portion he asked for big things amen this is G given the teaching of what the church must do amen they must be John 14:12 in action can I say it to you we are John 14:12 in action amen you asked for a hard thing it's not hard for God Amen it's it's not hard for Elijah it's hard for Elisha because now he must understand I'm commissioned that's what is it when you see me as taken away from you you know there's a lot of people can't see the prophets going right they're sending out parties for him to come back school of the prophets sending out oh surely the spirit cast him down brother brandom's got to come back and finish says no you're here to finish this God is here in a briide body amen you see you got to see me is taken away from you but there's still a commission there's still a job to do amen God took Elijah away right and it ain't going to do any good to go looking for it amen yes God took him away but his spirit's still here amen it's still anoints I I ain't talking about the spirit of William brandom I hope you get that I'm talking about the spirit of Christ that was up him that is the spirit of Elijah it was not it was not a human Spirit passed down upon Elisha and then passed down upon John and then brother random gets the human Spirit that's not it that was the spirit of Christ working in the manner of restoration ation Hallelujah he was identifying the spirit of Christ it'll come again anointing men in the tribulation Moses and Elijah to be the Fulfillment of the old and the new yeah brother bam is gone let me just say the apostles died 2,000 years ago but the day of the apostolic age isn't over the god of Elijah is still here well how many will agree we've seen Elijah you believe that how many will agree you've seen Elijah then it's the hour them for Elisha to take the Elisha people to rise and take the mantle handed to them and strike the river amen saying where is is the god of Elijah I'm talking about somebody must have the double portion of spirit and in truth I'm talking about not just somebody that's got truth and no Spirit or somebody's all got all spirit and no truth I'm talking about spirit and Truth the double portion as we look at this if you want the Holy Ghost you're going to have to keep your eyes on Jesus as as he moves you move as he moves you from justification to Sanctified life follow him don't let him get out of your sight when he moves and you get a little jump or a shout keep following me keep fallowing till he sends his cloak send till he sends the Holy Spirit but that's what brother bam said it was so well brother Tim we we we're not having the spirit of William Brown I'm not even I ain't even been trying to get you to get the brother Brandon's human Spirit I'm talking about the Holy Ghost yes amen we can even focus away from that for a minute brother Bram told us that that Elisha typed the bride and Christ typed Elijah and they saw him when he went away and he sent back his mantle the Holy Ghost and I want to say the mantle of Jesus Christ is right here with the church today if you have the Holy Ghost you been anointed elected chosen sent ordained for this generation to manifest the life and the power and the anointing of Jesus Christ wow you said we don't have no right to the manle of Elijah that was only for brother Brandon well like I said same thing happened when Jesus went away after he ascended down came the mle that covered the Wrath of the Holy Ghost and The Same Spirit that clothed Jesus now indwelt his bride the mantle typed the baptism of the Holy Ghost well it ain't available well it is either you just havn't seen him go away your focus is on something else you hadn't received what came come on Amen time and time again he shows that Elijah represents Christ elishah represents the church the Elisha receiving a double portion of Elijah's Spirit after Elijah ascends to heaven in a Char of fire and represents the church receiving the Holy Ghost after Christ ascends to heaven the Holy Ghost is symbolized by The Robe that the lights awars amen now so what is it he asked for a hard thing I want you to say to you today write out your check is there anything for too hard for the Lord you know brother R said we got a problem today said some people's got money in the bank don't know how to write a check and he and he said another one of them he said they they they know how to write a check they ain't got no money in the bank he said if we could ever get the two together he said one is Spirit the other is truth if we could ever get the two together if we could ever get you both in spirit and in truth you can write out a check you can make that phone call and pray for Tim puit he'll get up and walk again amen you can send a text you can you can pray the prayer come on Amen the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man aileth much amen you say how am I righteous because he is my righteousness he watchs he sees him taken from him just in a mle back what I got his coat he rent his and two he tore his get rid of your own ideas get rid of your own ways get rid of your old C and put on the Holy Ghost put it on Hallelujah by this time Elisha has grown to fit the robe amen I believe there's a bride in this day that has grown to fit the robe yeah along the journey we'll meet with the mamba snake but we've been given power to bind him or loose him amen we can stand right there at the river of death there and bind it somebody help me preach right now amen listen the the bride must have the double portion of spirit and Truth therefore you come to your Jordans just like Elijah did and cross over and dry a land just like Elisha does same as Jesus did he come to his Jordan of trial he come to his times of Temptations you're not above Temptation he struck the waters and he walked on dry ground you can walk right through your difficulties instead of being drowned by them and when you receive the mantle there is no no hindrance there is no obstacle that can stop you nothing that you can't overcome you can believe for the impossible you can take the mantle and do as Jesus did and do the Greater Works Christ received the the church received a double portion of the Holy Spirit after Jesus Ascension this double portion empowers Believers to fulform per the Greater Works brother Bram would explain that in one one exp explanation many times he would use this it's more works because now he's doing it in other many bodies he did it in one man back now but now the same Jesus the Same Jesus you know it was an old story you know back uh Merlin the magician yeah it's a crazy story but you know he had all of this magic and there was this guy you know thought he could do the same and he reads in the books and he takes and and he's left with a job to do so he looks in the books and he figures out how to speak the magic over some brooms and these brooms grow arms and feets and they began to take buckets of water you know and fill up and do his job you know he's sitting back there relaxing but he can't but all of a sudden it gets full and he don't know how to read it he don't know he don't he can't find in the book how to stop them so he looks and he grabs an Axe and he chops them in two and guess what happens then Sprout arms and buckets and now he's got twice as many problems and he goes and he hacks and he hacks and now there's just hundreds of buckets filling up and he can't stop it now that's a fiction story but on the day of Pentecost the devil thought he could stop us he thought he could stop it he thought that Jesus was on the cross and he could be stopped it's over with it's finished it's over with but he didn't know it was not magic but it was power coming down from on high and what he had done to one was now multiply into 120 doing the same works that Jesus did Hallelujah the same life the same power the same Holy Ghost and he through the Dark Ages he's tried to chop it and bust them into pieces and they just SP more you can't stop it the devil can't do nothing to stop it God's word will move and power it'll rain and Glory [Music] hallelujah what is it what did he do he made you a messiah a little Jesus a walking talking Spirit Le word express Living Bible written epistle Hallelujah Believers anointed by the same Holy Spirit become Messiahs I'm telling you who you are Elisha stand standing at the river oh yeah facing a difficult situation the school of the prophets are watching there's scuffing there's really ridicule wondering doubting that God is with Elijah Elisha well the bride with the bride as it was with Elijah do we really know true worship or is it just another theology message dead with no power little children are mocking Elisha the bride go up in the Rapture like Elijah did there's nothing that's never going to be a raptor go up you bald head they come under curse go ahead and mock the message and the messenger the Russian bears will get you there's a bomb going to destroy him fire's going to burn the Earth Elija walks down and he says where is the god of Elijah he didn't ask where is Elijah amen Elijah was gone but he wanted to know that God he said here I received something amen I received his mantle I received a double portion what am I going to do with it will I make a boat and Float over well I drowned in the waters where is the god of Elijah I'll answer that he's revealed in sons who Worship in spirit and in truth hallelujah this is when Sons and Daughters of God are manifested this is the age of adoption when full Sons walk out and their words are back amen we at the fullness of time for the pyramid had reached the top the seventh age and we're here at the last Church age when full sons of God are manifested when they walk out in with the power of God and the fullness of the spirit and take every Power that Satan has away from you I just say to you this morning rise up take the anointing we're
