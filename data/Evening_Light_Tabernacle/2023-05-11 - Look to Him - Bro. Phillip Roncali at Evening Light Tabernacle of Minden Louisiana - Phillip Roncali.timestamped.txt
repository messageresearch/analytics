[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] and I know
[0:03] that the Bible says
[0:07] when you've done all that you can't
[0:10] stand
[0:13] just stand
[0:19] and I know that it's hard sometimes to
[0:25] look through those tears things
[0:30] and still see
[0:34] scars in
[0:36] those hands
[0:39] [Music]
[0:41] but just you keep this in mind
[0:47] When Hope
[0:49] seems so hard to find
[0:53] the surely
[0:56] you've not reached reached the air
[1:04] when the whole world
[1:06] is let you down
[1:10] Jesus oh he can still be found
[1:15] when you've
[1:17] tried it all
[1:20] look to him
[1:25] oh look to him for him only
[1:31] for sorrow
[1:34] makes lonely
[1:36] all the days
[1:39] then the night
[1:42] closes in

[1:50] your midnight and he'll call back to
[1:56] sunlight
[1:58] so how will it end
[2:03] Look to Him
[2:09] now I know the questions can
[2:14] oh they can get so hard to understand
[2:20] the thing
[2:25] but I know someone oh he knows it all
[2:30] if I see even that little Sparrow fall
[2:35] and he can hold back the sea with just
[2:41] one hand
[2:45] oh and he's so big he rides on the
[2:49] breeze it blows yet in your heart he's
[2:53] the only one that knows all the
[2:58] heartaches and All the Troubles your
[3:03] rings again
[3:06] oh and when life sings
[3:09] Everything but good
[3:12] remember him cause he's the only one
[3:16] that could
[3:18] and if you'd only dare
[3:22] Look to Him
[3:27] oh look to him
[3:30] for he only
[3:33] with sorrow
[3:35] makes lonely
[3:38] all the days when the night
[3:43] closes in oh
[3:48] and he can find his all your midnight

[3:59] so

[4:12] for the only
[4:15] with sorrow

[4:23] when the night
[4:25] closes in

[4:33] your midnight and he can call back to
[4:39] sunlight
