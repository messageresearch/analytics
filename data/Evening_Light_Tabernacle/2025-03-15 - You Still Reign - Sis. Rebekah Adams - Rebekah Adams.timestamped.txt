[0:13] When all foundations have been
[0:18] shen when I'm left standing in the
[0:24] dark and all I feel is my heart
[0:28] breaking.
[0:31] You still reign and you're still
[0:36] God. And when it feels all hope has
[0:41] faded, the heavy questions hit so
[0:47] hard. And through my soul may feel
[0:53] forsen, you still reign and you're still
[0:57] God.
[1:00] And though I can't see what's before
[1:04] me, I know that I can trust your
[1:10] heart. And this one truth will be my
[1:16] story. You still reign and you're still
[1:21] gone. I will declare that you are with
[1:26] me.
[1:28] The voices whisper that you're
[1:33] not. You'll never leave me nor forsake
[1:38] me. Cuz you still reign and you're still
[1:44] God. I know I can't see what's before
[1:50] me. I know that I can trust your
[1:55] heart. And this one truth will be my
[2:01] story. You still reign and you're still
[2:05] God.
[2:08] Though I can't see what's before
[2:12] me, I know that I can trust your
[2:18] heart. And this one truth will be my
[2:24] story. You still reign and you're still
[2:28] God.
[2:30] And when my eneies surround
[2:35] me, I'll trust the victory of your
[2:41] cross. And fix my eyes upon you,
[2:45] [Music]
[2:47] Jesus. For you are God and I am not.
[2:53] Though I can't see what's before me. Oh,
[2:59] I know that I can't trust your
[3:04] heart. One truth will be my
[3:09] story. You still reign and you're still
[3:13] gone.
[3:16] You are good and you are
[3:19] [Music]
[3:21] faithful as you have been from the
[3:26] start. And you are working for your
[3:31] [Music]
[3:32] glory. Cuz you still reign and you're
[3:35] still God.
[3:39] Though I can't see what's before
[3:43] me, I know that I can trust your
[3:49] heart. And this one truth will be my
[3:55] story. You still reign and you're still
[3:59] God.
[4:01] [Music]
[4:02] You are good and you are
[4:07] faithful as you have been from the
[4:12] start. You're working all things for my
[4:16] [Applause]
[4:18] glory. Cuz you still reign and you're
[4:21] still
[4:24] God. You're working all things for your
[4:28] glory.
[4:30] Cuz you still rain and you're still
[4:34] gone.
