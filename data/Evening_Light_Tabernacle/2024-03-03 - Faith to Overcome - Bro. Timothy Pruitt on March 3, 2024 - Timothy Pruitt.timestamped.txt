[23:59] called of his kingdom and the time that
[24:01] we're living in and it's a glorious time
[24:04] it's it's the most wonderful time to
[24:06] ever be right at the coming of the Lord
[24:08] Jesus many prophets many sages long to
[24:11] see the day that we see and the day that
[24:13] we live in but blessed are our eyes for
[24:16] we can see amen there's a whole lot of
[24:19] people in this world but they don't all
[24:21] see they might have eyeballs but they
[24:23] don't all see amen they may have ears
[24:26] but they don't hear but I'm so thankful
[24:27] to have an ear to hear amen so thankful
[24:30] for that 1 John 5 and verse 4 says for
[24:35] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[24:39] world and this is the victory that
[24:41] overcometh the world even our faith who
[24:45] is he that overcometh the world but he
[24:48] that believeth that Jesus is the son of
[24:51] God Amen we let you be seated amen I so
[24:55] enjoyed Wednesday night about the
[24:57] Champion within and amen just going
[25:00] along with some things I've been looking
[25:02] at and so uh this might be a bit of a
[25:04] part two I don't know but uh amen this
[25:08] is it's wonderful to be in the same
[25:10] channel amen so uh just looking at this
[25:14] this this scripture whatsoever is born
[25:17] of God overcometh the world and this is
[25:21] the victory that overcometh the world
[25:23] our faith and and I'll take some from it
[25:26] brother Brandon preached on
[25:28] faith is our
[25:29] Victory and uh I I I am so thankful to
[25:34] be a person who in the time that we're
[25:36] living in has Faith uh because there's a
[25:39] lot of faithless people in this world
[25:41] that we live in they they don't believe
[25:44] uh where they may believe in something
[25:45] but I'm talking about a faith to believe
[25:47] in a living God Amen you can have faith
[25:49] in a tree you can have faith in all
[25:51] kinds of things but amen I I I want to
[25:54] have something a faith in something that
[25:56] amen can respond resp to the need that I
[25:59] have and you know uh to to have this
[26:02] Victory there has to be something on the
[26:04] inside Amen to give you this overcoming
[26:07] power and the only way amen as we heard
[26:09] Wednesday night about the champion
[26:11] within amen how that he would come and
[26:13] he would give us life and from that life
[26:15] would come the life of God and it would
[26:18] come and live on the inside of you and
[26:20] and honestly that's the only way we can
[26:22] overcome the world is by that life amen
[26:25] as he overcometh the as he overcame the
[26:28] world and I just want to look in John 16
[26:31] and verse 16 and and it's quite a
[26:35] interesting scripture and the way Jesus
[26:37] done things just follow this for a
[26:39] moment it says a little while and you
[26:41] shall not see me and again a little
[26:43] while and you shall see me because I go
[26:46] to the father and then some of his
[26:48] disciples among themselves what is this
[26:50] that he saith unto us a little while you
[26:52] shall not see me and again a little
[26:55] while you shall see me and because I go
[26:57] to to the father and they said therefore
[26:59] what is this that he saith a little
[27:01] while we cannot tell what he saith now
[27:04] Jesus knew that they were desirous to
[27:06] ask him and said unto them do you
[27:08] inquire among yourselves of that I said
[27:11] a little while and you shall not see me
[27:13] and again a little while and you shall
[27:15] see me verily verily I say unto you that
[27:18] ye shall weep and lament but the world
[27:20] shall rejoice you shall be sorrowful but
[27:23] your sorrow shall be turned into joy as
[27:26] a woman who she is when she's in travail
[27:29] has sorrow because her hour has come but
[27:32] as soon as she is delivered of child she
[27:35] remember no more the anguish for the joy
[27:38] that a man is Born Into the world and
[27:40] that's that's the truth amen when a
[27:42] woman's in expecting a child and she's
[27:45] going through all the sorrow and the
[27:46] pain amen it'd be hard right then to
[27:48] talk her into having another one but
[27:50] when she's holding that baby and a few
[27:52] months down the road it ain't too long
[27:54] she wants another child why because the
[27:56] joy that this child brought that came
[27:58] into the world and she through that Joy
[28:01] she's forgotten all the sorrow and the
[28:03] travail that she's going through and he
[28:05] says ye now therefore have sorrow but I
[28:08] will see you again and your heart shall
[28:10] rejoice and your joy no man taketh from
[28:14] you and in that day you shall ask me
[28:16] nothing verily verily I say unto you
[28:18] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[28:20] my name he will give it to you hitherto
[28:23] have you asked nothing in my name ask
[28:26] and you shall re receive that your joy
[28:29] may be full and these things have I
[28:31] spoken to you in the proverb but the
[28:33] time cometh when I shall no more speak
[28:35] to you in Proverbs for I will show you
[28:37] plainly of the father and that day you
[28:39] shall ask in my name and I shall not say
[28:42] unto you and I said and I will say not
[28:45] unto you and I will pray to the father
[28:46] for you for the father himself loveth
[28:48] you because you've loved me and have
[28:50] believed that I came out from God I came
[28:53] forth from the father and then came into
[28:55] the world again and leave the world and
[28:56] go to the father father his disciples
[28:58] says lo now speaketh thou plainly and
[29:01] speak no proverb now we sure we now are
[29:05] we sure that thou knowest all things and
[29:07] needest not any man to ask thee but this
[29:09] we believe that thou comest forth from
[29:11] God and Jesus answers it do you now
[29:13] believe behold the hour cometh yay is
[29:17] now come that ye shall be scattered
[29:19] every man to his own and shall leave me
[29:22] alone and yet I am not alone because the
[29:25] father is with me these things have have
[29:27] I spoken unto you now sometimes when you
[29:29] want God to speak to you very plainly it
[29:31] ain't always going to be what you want
[29:32] to hear amen because sometimes it's
[29:35] going to be it's going to tell you
[29:36] exactly what's going to take place and
[29:38] it ain't all going to be roses and
[29:40] everything's hunky dory you're going to
[29:42] go through a lot of things and and then
[29:44] you know I look at all this all this uh
[29:47] scattered and and sorrow and all of this
[29:49] and he said I've told you these things
[29:52] because in the world you shall have
[29:55] tribulation a let me go back the these
[29:57] things have I spoken to you that in me
[29:59] you might have peace I I told you you're
[30:01] going to have sorrow I've told you going
[30:03] to go through tribulation I told you
[30:05] you're going to be scattered but I've
[30:06] told you this so you can have peace now
[30:08] that's that's a paradox because in your
[30:11] in yourself alone you'll never come to
[30:13] peace but if you'll look on me and know
[30:15] that I have also overcome the world I
[30:18] have overcome it and as I I have
[30:20] overcome it therefore you shall also
[30:23] overcome amen and I I believe that
[30:26] that's exactly why he put put his life
[30:27] on the inside of us amen is to overcome
[30:30] as he overcome to destroy every work of
[30:33] the devil as he destroyed every work of
[30:35] the devil amen he put his life in us to
[30:38] heal the sick as he healed the sick amen
[30:40] to raise the dead as he raised the dead
[30:43] Amen to overcome and this where he said
[30:45] be of good cheer I have overcome the
[30:48] world so when we hear of cancer we can
[30:50] be of good cheer and at peace because
[30:52] he's already overcoming amen when we
[30:54] have sin or things in our life or the
[30:57] oppressions or whatever it is amen we
[30:59] can be at peace because he has already
[31:01] overcome it and as he has overcome we
[31:04] shall also overcome so his word is where
[31:07] we base our faith it's it's not on what
[31:10] a preacher said to us or what somebody
[31:12] else may say but it's what God's word
[31:14] says you know we got you got a lot of
[31:17] people in this day wanting to hear a
[31:18] word from a preacher or or you know hear
[31:20] something amen it's not that's not
[31:22] always the way God our orchestrates now
[31:24] God can anoint a man to give you a word
[31:27] word or bring a inspiration upon his
[31:30] heart to do that but that ain't the way
[31:31] God is looking to do things God wants
[31:34] you to believe his word amen I don't
[31:37] believe that I'm Healed because a
[31:38] preacher said I'm Healed I believe
[31:40] because his word says I'm Healed I don't
[31:43] believe that I'm an overcomer because a
[31:45] preacher said I'm Overcomer I believe it
[31:47] because his word says I'm an overcomer
[31:50] amen I believe that's where we need to
[31:52] place our word our our our faith upon is
[31:55] not upon what some man can say what some
[31:58] man can do but what the word of God has
[32:00] already spoken upon our behalf amen
[32:03] unbelief you know will speak fear it'll
[32:05] speak worry it'll speak doubt it'll
[32:08] speak all kinds of things but faith will
[32:10] always speak the word of God Amen faith
[32:13] will look at a difficult thing and say I
[32:15] can do all things through Christ who
[32:18] strengthens me amen it don't say some
[32:20] things or good you know just when I'm
[32:23] feeling good it says I can do all things
[32:26] through Christ who strengthens me I
[32:28] faith will look and say I am born of God
[32:31] therefore I have World overcoming Faith
[32:34] yes sir I am born of God therefore I
[32:37] have World overcome in faith residing on
[32:40] the inside of me I will let the peace of
[32:43] God rule my heart and I refuse to worry
[32:46] about
[32:48] anything come on now amen this is what
[32:51] he said I told you these things so you
[32:53] can have peace amen this is a peace that
[32:56] the world didn't give and the world
[32:57] can't take away amen we're not talking
[33:00] about a pieace that is dependent upon
[33:02] whether there's a good economy or
[33:04] there's money in your pocket or or
[33:05] you're feeling good that ain't the peace
[33:07] I'm talking about I'm talking about the
[33:09] peace of God that passes all
[33:12] understanding in other words when you
[33:13] cannot understand you can still have
[33:16] peace amen when you still don't you
[33:18] don't know how it's going to work out
[33:20] and you don't know which way the word
[33:22] the road's going to turn next you can
[33:24] still have peace because there a peace
[33:26] that passes all understanding you can
[33:29] trust in the Lord with all your heart
[33:31] and lean not to your own
[33:34] understanding in all your ways submit
[33:36] yourself to him and he will make your
[33:38] pass St amen this this your faith will
[33:41] speak a word that'll look right in the
[33:43] middle of enemies surrounding you and
[33:46] doubt all around and unbelief all around
[33:48] and and situations you can't handle and
[33:50] said no weapon formed against me shall
[33:53] prosper amen no weapon formed against me
[33:56] shall shall prosper but every tongue
[33:59] that is formed against me shall be
[34:02] condemned amen that devil that's been
[34:04] whispering in my ear he shall be
[34:07] condemned that devil has been telling me
[34:09] I can't make it that this message is not
[34:11] for me it shall be condemned that devil
[34:14] that tells me I'm not a son of God I'm
[34:16] not a child of God it shall be
[34:21] condemned amen I am an overcomer I'm
[34:25] overcome by the blood of the Lamb and
[34:27] the word of my testimony I am submitted
[34:30] to
[34:31] God hallelujah and in my submitt to God
[34:35] the devil flees from me because when I
[34:37] resist him he will run in the name of
[34:40] Jesus Amen Faith looks at the word it
[34:43] says God is my refuge and strength he is
[34:46] my well proven help in the time of
[34:49] trouble hallelujah we're not dealing
[34:52] with a a a help that may work out or may
[34:55] not work out or isn't proving you know
[34:57] it'd be hard to uh depend or put your
[35:00] trust in something that's not proven
[35:02] right you know you got in your car today
[35:04] because it's been proven you know it's
[35:06] been proven it goes down the road but if
[35:08] you get you a car that ain't proven and
[35:10] you ain't likely to take it on a long
[35:13] trip go get a rental car or something
[35:16] you know you got old car old beater yeah
[35:19] you ain't going to just jump at it and
[35:20] go across the country not most likely
[35:22] cuz you'll get stranded somewhere but if
[35:23] you got a well proven thing and I
[35:25] understand it's man-made and it's still
[35:27] can break down I don't care if it just
[35:28] got one mile on
[35:29] it amen but I I was just trying to make
[35:32] a point here amen you put Faith and
[35:35] something but listen God is not a
[35:37] man-made thing he's not going to get you
[35:39] down 500 miles down the road or 5 years
[35:42] down the road or 20 years down the road
[35:44] and leave you stranded somewhere he's
[35:46] not a man-made thing he's going to take
[35:48] you all the way from the beginning to
[35:50] the end he who started the work shall
[35:53] finish the work he's the author and the
[35:55] finisher amen in all these things we are
[35:58] more than conquers through him that
[36:00] loved us greater is he that is in me
[36:03] than he that's in the world this is
[36:05] where Faith goes to it doesn't go to our
[36:07] feelings it doesn't go to our thoughts
[36:10] amen God if we we we went we went on our
[36:12] thoughts and our faith was only in what
[36:14] we thought where would we be we wouldn't
[36:16] be here this morning most likely we'd be
[36:18] still in bed somewhere probably in the
[36:20] hospital somewhere but our our faith is
[36:23] not resting upon what I think or what
[36:25] anybody else things it's only resting on
[36:28] what the word of God
[36:31] says amen if we could receive this truth
[36:34] he that is in you is greater than he
[36:37] that's in the world we know that's true
[36:39] how many know that's true the one that
[36:41] resides on the inside if you got the
[36:43] holy ghost that champion within it's
[36:46] greater than the one that's in the
[36:48] world he's proven that he knocked him
[36:51] out he gave him the knockout punch at
[36:54] Calvary come on somebody he broke his
[36:56] back at Calvary he proved he was greater
[36:59] than the one that's in the
[37:03] world Amen so what is in what what what
[37:07] in you is greater is Christ the anointed
[37:09] one amen that's Christ in you greater is
[37:12] he that's in you than he that's in the
[37:14] world and if he's in you it's not you
[37:17] anymore living that's it's him living in
[37:20] you it's not your thinking it's not what
[37:23] you thought about it it's what he said
[37:25] about it
[37:27] I can't drive that point home hard
[37:30] enough it ain't what we think about it
[37:33] it's what he said about
[37:35] it amen then if he is in you he would
[37:39] absolutely not deny what he
[37:42] said he can't deny his own word he can't
[37:45] do it he would keep what he said he's
[37:48] trying to find a person that he can
[37:49] vindicate himself through he said he
[37:51] that's in you is greater than he that's
[37:53] in the world God in you like he was in
[37:56] in Jesus
[37:58] Christ come on now God in you like he
[38:01] was in Jesus Christ amen that's the
[38:03] words of a prophet God in you like he
[38:05] was in Jesus Christ because what all God
[38:08] was he poured into Christ and what all
[38:11] Christ was he poured into a church into
[38:14] a bride how many's part of that church
[38:17] let me tell you it's not a wimpy church
[38:19] it's a powerful church it's a church
[38:22] that'll get up and believe no matter
[38:24] what situation is around it it'll
[38:26] believe in Divine Healing it'll believe
[38:28] in the spirit of God it'll believe in
[38:31] all things that's written in the word of
[38:33] God doesn't matter what Theologian says
[38:36] doesn't matter what anybody
[38:38] says it's God in you he that's in you no
[38:42] wonder the winds and the waves obeyed
[38:45] him it obeyed his word it obeyed his
[38:48] word because it was God's word through
[38:50] him amen you may not go out you as a
[38:53] person go out and individually turn a
[38:55] hurricane around or turn a tornado
[38:57] around you may may he may God may work
[39:00] that way sometime through I'm not saying
[39:02] he can't but am man that's not the
[39:04] that's not the storms that he's worried
[39:05] about right now he's worried about the
[39:07] storms in this earth that's right that
[39:09] storms that try to come and trying to
[39:11] whirl you out of the path of God and
[39:14] bring destruction to you that you
[39:16] something on the inside of you will rise
[39:18] up and say devil this is enough I'm not
[39:21] taking it a piece be
[39:25] still and take dominion over those
[39:27] things when he spoke it was God speaking
[39:30] through human lips the very creator that
[39:34] created the winds and the waves was in
[39:36] him think that think that he said now
[39:39] think deep now
[39:40] because he said no wonder demons
[39:43] paralyzed at his word it was God in him
[39:47] it was God in Christ demons was
[39:52] paralyzed amen that's what he said about
[39:55] Moses he said Moses Faith was either
[39:57] going to Egypt was either going to
[39:59] paralyze moses' Faith or moses' faith
[40:01] was going to paralyze
[40:03] Egypt amen I believe we're right there
[40:06] at that same time this world is either
[40:08] going to paralyze you or you're going to
[40:10] paralyze this world Amen make it where
[40:12] it has no dominion over you he says now
[40:15] think about this the demons were
[40:17] paralyzed no wonder the dead that was
[40:19] turned back to dust could let could not
[40:22] lay there at his word for he was the
[40:24] word he said Lazarus after being dead
[40:26] and stinking four days his face his nose
[40:29] has fell in that much in that much time
[40:31] no Lazarus come forth and a man dead
[40:34] raised up from his on his feet why it
[40:37] was God he he that was in Christ was God
[40:40] the dead could not stand in his presence
[40:43] it was God in Christ and let me tell you
[40:46] he still raises the dead
[40:49] today he did it in William bram's day he
[40:52] still does it
[40:54] today amen it's happened before amen
[40:58] God's still God he said God created the
[41:00] winds in the air God created the waves
[41:03] it's it's the water that produced him he
[41:05] created all that but the devil got into
[41:08] it and it got to tumbling to bring
[41:10] destruction God created men to be sons
[41:13] of God but when the devil gets into them
[41:16] then it tries to bring destruction he
[41:18] said that's what the devil got into the
[41:20] winds and sent that storm but couldn't
[41:22] the creator that created the wave say go
[41:25] back for I created you isn't that the
[41:29] same Creator standing on top of the hill
[41:31] the other day isn't that the same one
[41:33] that could take a piece of fish and
[41:35] break it and another piece grow on he
[41:38] didn't he didn't exactly have to do it
[41:39] that way but he could have said it he
[41:41] could have done whatever you want to
[41:43] he's a Creator couldn't he create
[41:46] squirrels amen he that was in Christ is
[41:49] in us for it does the same Works he did
[41:53] the same thing he did it does now the
[41:56] dead cannot stand in the presence of his
[42:01] word greater is he it's God the
[42:06] Creator it's the the winds and the waves
[42:08] had to obey him demons become
[42:12] paralyzed Hallelujah I like to tell that
[42:15] again to that old devil demons become
[42:19] paralyzed all nature obeyed him because
[42:22] he was a creator of that nature and he
[42:25] said we we we ought to understand isn't
[42:28] it isn't man man can't do that but man's
[42:30] part of the creation it's the winds and
[42:33] the waves that obey the
[42:35] Creator see what he's saying he said it
[42:38] isn't man it's man that's part of the
[42:41] creation it's the winds and the waves
[42:43] that obey the Creator it's this flesh
[42:47] that has to come into into and into obey
[42:50] the Creator it takes the Creator to do
[42:53] it for he that is in you is great than
[42:56] he that's in the
[43:00] world
[43:02] Amen he that can the one that can cause
[43:05] turmoil the one that can turn your world
[43:07] upside down the one that's inside of you
[43:11] is greater than
[43:15] that he can rebuke the devil out of the
[43:20] Winds I've seen him do it seen him do it
[43:24] right there in Youth Camp there's winds
[43:25] and w get to roll in and demons start
[43:28] speaking out of that
[43:30] creation amen and the power of God begin
[43:33] to speak and say come out of them what
[43:36] was it peace be still what was it the
[43:38] same creating power that put his foot up
[43:41] the bow of the boat was the same one
[43:43] that spoke those words and the same
[43:45] Devils that became paralyzed then is the
[43:48] ones that become paralyzed
[43:50] [Applause]
[43:53] now greater is he that is in you than he
[43:58] that is in the world what what do you
[43:59] think happened in that back room there
[44:01] at Youth Camp when brother brother Aaron
[44:03] was summoned to come in and pray for
[44:04] that girl that was having that demonic
[44:07] manifestation and that demon looked
[44:09] around and said
[44:11] no not
[44:14] you she wasn't talk about Aaron
[44:17] Obby he's a big dude but she wasn't
[44:20] talking about
[44:22] him she wasn't worried about him she was
[44:25] worried about what was on the inside of
[44:27] him it was the same one when that Maniac
[44:31] come running out to that boat and that
[44:33] same Creator stepped
[44:35] out and he starts walking up there and
[44:38] this maniac's going to come destroy him
[44:40] as he's destroyed many others all of a
[44:42] sudden what are you doing in
[44:46] there Hallelujah that devil saw beyond
[44:49] what the human flesh people were looking
[44:51] at that human flesh calling him Bel
[44:53] calling him the devil calling him an
[44:55] illegitimate child called him everything
[44:56] but the devil knew who he was and he
[44:59] said what are you doing in there amen
[45:01] there was the same one of that little
[45:03] girl that looked beyond human flesh and
[45:06] said what is what not you not you you've
[45:10] defeated me too many
[45:12] times and he defeated him
[45:15] again cuz he's the same yesterday today
[45:19] and
[45:24] forever he that's in you he can rebuke
[45:28] the devil out of the
[45:32] Winds those winds that get stirred up in
[45:34] your home he can rebuke that those devil
[45:38] those Devils that get stirred up in the
[45:39] Winds of your own flesh make you think
[45:43] all kinds of
[45:46] things yeah yeah he can rebuke that but
[45:49] you better not lean on your own
[45:51] understanding cuz he'll whoop you around
[45:53] on your own
[45:54] understanding but greater is he that's
[45:57] in you than he that's in the world the
[45:59] devil is in the world the world belongs
[46:01] to him that's what the Bible said oh
[46:03] Lucifer why art thou following Lucifer
[46:06] the son of the morning the world belongs
[46:07] to him that's when he was kicked out of
[46:09] heaven he's he's he's now in rulership
[46:12] he's the same one that said to Christ
[46:14] these kingdoms are mine I do with them
[46:16] as I will they belong to him and he's
[46:18] the one that's in the world John told
[46:21] had just told the disciples you heard of
[46:22] the Antichrist who has come and is here
[46:24] already working in the children of
[46:26] Disobedience but little children you're
[46:28] not of the world you're of God and
[46:30] greater is he that's in you than he
[46:33] that's in the world that's Christ in
[46:36] you greater is he amen that was in
[46:39] Joshua than that than the
[46:43] son amen that Joshua was just a man he
[46:46] was sin born like you and I greater was
[46:48] he that was in Joshua than the son that
[46:51] was running by the Commandment of
[46:53] God God had commanded that sun to shine
[46:56] and to stay there it was governed and
[46:58] controlled by the laws of God but
[47:00] greater was he that was in Joshua than
[47:03] the laws of
[47:05] God Mercy because the Creator himself
[47:09] was in Joshua working there in that
[47:12] anointing he'd come down to take on the
[47:14] on the Battle of them as they took
[47:17] Jericho and was taking the promised land
[47:19] Joshua looked up the Sun and said you
[47:21] stand there where you're at and the moon
[47:23] you stay where you're at till the till I
[47:25] finish the battle and the Sun and the
[47:27] Moon obeyed him for he was the Joshua
[47:30] was greater than the Sun and the Moon he
[47:33] that was in Joshua was
[47:35] greater he that was in Moses was greater
[47:38] than
[47:40] Egypt we're talking about our champion
[47:42] this morning and we're not talking about
[47:44] necessarily about Moses and Joshua he
[47:46] could have used whoever he wanted
[47:48] to but we're talking about the one that
[47:51] used them the one that was inside of
[47:52] them Egypt had great armies had the
[47:54] greatest army in in all the world they
[47:57] they had conquered the world at that
[47:58] time but greater was he that was in
[48:00] Moses than was in
[48:02] Egypt amen the Nile God wasn't big
[48:05] enough the frog god wasn't big enough
[48:08] the flea God wasn't big enough he
[48:10] destroyed all of their
[48:16] gods maybe it wasn't a fleeing
[48:19] sight might have been even winter time
[48:22] but whatever God said to Moses go speak
[48:24] my word and I'll put your mind what to
[48:27] say you go out there and pick up some
[48:28] dirt off the ground and throw up in the
[48:30] air and say Let There Be fleas and fleas
[48:34] went to crawling said probably several
[48:37] inches
[48:39] deep that gives me the heie
[48:43] jeebies yeah buddy makes me want to
[48:45] scratch right
[48:47] now all over the ground in a few moments
[48:50] what was it the
[48:52] Creator there wasn't any frog so he
[48:55] stretched out his rod and said let there
[48:56] be frogs and there they were piled up
[48:58] till the whole land was
[49:01] stinking and dum Pharaoh says Mo Moses
[49:05] said when you want me to take him away

[52:23] sure he had enjoyed himself that that
[52:25] day in that Lion's
[52:27] Den here he is down at Lion's Den the
[52:30] king comes the next morning what did he
[52:32] tell the king for when he got thought oh
[52:33] King I'll see you in the
[52:36] morning amen he had faith in his God cuz

[52:41] nothing wrong he was praying to his
[52:43] God come on
[52:45] somebody amen and he gos down that lines
[52:48] then and the King opens it up and there
[52:49] he still is and he said it isn't by my
[52:51] might or my strength it's by my
[52:54] God amen see the LI what was in Daniel
[52:57] was greater than what's in the D the
[52:59] lion he said the man man it was made to
[53:02] be a friend of man but he said the devil
[53:04] is what makes him do that he said you
[53:06] know the devil but in the Millennium the
[53:09] devil will be gone he'll be chained up
[53:11] it's the devil that makes wild beast
[53:13] tear and rip and eat and things like
[53:15] that that's the way they do it's Satan
[53:17] that does that but greater was he that
[53:19] was in Daniel that was in the
[53:22] lion amen this is why we see men losing
[53:25] their mind and women amen doing things
[53:28] to babies that's unheard of and
[53:29] unthought Unthinkable what is it it's
[53:31] Satan that's gotten the winds and the
[53:33] waves he's gotten the Flesh and the
[53:36] creation men and women who were created
[53:38] to be amen lovers of God and worshippers
[53:41] of God the devil gets into them and they
[53:43] turn into nothing but vile beasts and
[53:46] and they rip and they Roar and they tear
[53:48] and they
[53:49] ma but greater is he that is in
[53:54] US that's
[53:58] right the Hebrew
[54:02] children getting ready to be thrown in
[54:04] the fire and he said heated it up seven
[54:07] times hotter well I mean if that ain't a
[54:09] type of us I don't know what
[54:11] is seven time why didn't he use six why
[54:15] didn't use four why didn't use 10 he
[54:17] said
[54:19] seven seventh Church age it's worse than

[55:03] a image of Daniel but whatever image it
[55:06] was here they were told to Bow and they
[55:10] wouldn't know no no cuz the word says
[55:13] you shall have no grave in
[55:15] image the word says there's only one God
[55:18] that what was it going back to the word
[55:20] again said do what you want to oh King

[55:23] bowing amen and I love how brother
[55:25] Brandon plays all all that out he says

[55:47] he grabbed a zigzag of lightning a roll
[55:49] of thunder and down into the fire he
[55:51] went and there he was standing there in
[55:53] the fire when they came into the
[55:56] fire cuz he knew what was going on he
[55:59] knew what was taking place he knew what
[56:01] was happening he knows exactly what is
[56:04] going on at all
[56:07] times sir Hallelujah that's why we can

[56:17] when we're going through things and we
[56:18] don't know which way to turn we can

[56:23] knows
[56:31] he
[56:35] knows so well what about sickness
[56:38] greater is he that's in you than the
[56:41] sickness because that is interrupting

[57:41] life I I'm talking about as a bride
[57:43] coming down the seven Church AE right
[57:45] down the last moments of time he hasn't
[57:47] lost control he's still in just as much
[57:49] control as he's ever been or he's not
[57:52] God but he is God so he's if he's God
[57:56] his word is still real his word is still
[57:58] true and it's still in control and he's
[58:00] still orchestrating all that is going on
[58:02] in this world it may seem like the devil
[58:04] is in control but the devil ain't
[58:06] nothing but a
[58:08] puppet the Bible says he said I will put
[58:11] rains in his mouth have you ever seen a
[58:14] puppet it has strings attached to it it
[58:16] can only do as the one is pulling the
[58:19] strings and it's playing out his part
[58:22] amen that's nothing but what the devil
[58:24] is I want to put a picture in your mind
[58:26] what he really is he ain't nothing but a
[58:28] dumb puppet that's and he's sitting
[58:30] there and he's only moving where God
[58:32] says he can move and he's only doing
[58:34] what God says he can do God is in
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:44] control it's Christ in you he said I
[58:48] don't rest on something you've done so
[58:49] well I felt a little shiver you know I
[58:51] spoke in tongues I danced in the spirit
[58:53] all those things are fine and wonderful
[58:55] he said that's all right that's great
[58:57] but don't just rest on that your life
[58:59] has got to be this greater is he that's
[59:03] in
[59:03] me this is it you and this has become
[59:10] one and then this manifest itself yes
[59:14] sir hello amen you don't dance to get it
[59:18] you dance because you got
[59:21] it you don't cry to get it you cry
[59:23] because something happened
[59:25] amen you don't shout to get it you shout
[59:27] because something
[59:34] happened he said what if tonight that
[59:37] you can say with all your heart the
[59:38] spirit of SP of Shakespeare lived in you
[59:41] then uh Shakespeare if he lived in you
[59:44] then what would you do You' do the works
[59:46] of
[59:47] Shakespeare you would create poems and
[59:49] plays and so forth and you know be great
[59:52] writer or something if Shakespeare lived
[59:54] in you he said Bo bethoven lived in you
[59:58] what what would you do you'd be a great
[59:59] composer you'd write songs you you would
[1:00:02] do like what because that's what
[1:00:03] Beethoven would be in your
[1:00:06] life if Beethoven lived in you the works
[1:00:08] of Beethoven you would
[1:00:11] do and and but if if Christ lived in you
[1:00:15] then the works of Christ you will
[1:00:17] do and if Christ is in you the works of
[1:00:20] Christ you would do for Christ lives in
[1:00:22] you he said so in John 14 vers 12 he
[1:00:25] that believeth in me amen The Works that
[1:00:28] I do shall he do also so if you was in
[1:00:31] Christ if Christ lived in you then the
[1:00:33] Christ is the word and the word Came To
[1:00:35] His prophets and down through he said
[1:00:37] Christ lived in you the works of Christ
[1:00:39] will be done through you the Life of
[1:00:40] Christ will be lived through you The
[1:00:42] Works he did the life he lived and
[1:00:44] everything would live in you just as if
[1:00:46] Shakespeare Beethoven or whoever it was
[1:00:49] lived in you if his life but if you're
[1:00:52] still living your own life then your own
[1:00:55] works you'll still see but if you're
[1:00:57] living the life of Christ if Christ is
[1:01:00] in you he that's in you is greater than
[1:01:03] he that's in the world so if your doubts
[1:01:05] and frustrations about God's promise in
[1:01:08] you then Christ isn't
[1:01:11] there maybe I need to read that again if
[1:01:13] your doubts and frustrations about God's
[1:01:16] promises is in you then Christ isn't in
[1:01:19] you in isn't there you're only worked
[1:01:23] up yeah that's what he says but if
[1:01:26] Christ is living in you his word he will
[1:01:28] recognize and his promises he will
[1:01:33] do when thou prayest believe that you
[1:01:36] receive what you ask for and it shall be
[1:01:38] given to you if you say to this mountain
[1:01:40] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:01:42] amen but believe what you say it will
[1:01:44] come to pass you can have what you ask
[1:01:47] the father worketh and I worketh hither
[1:01:49] too verely verely I say unto you the son
[1:01:51] can do nothing himself but what he sees
[1:01:52] the father doing that doth the son
[1:01:54] likewise and when the father showed him
[1:01:56] what to do he walked out there with a
[1:01:59] without a failure of everything and said
[1:02:01] let it be and it was that that same
[1:02:04] Christ is living on the inside of you it
[1:02:07] lives in us and his works we will
[1:02:12] do there ain't nothing can stop
[1:02:15] it he said I'll not leave you comfort is
[1:02:19] comfortless but I will come to you be in
[1:02:22] you I the person Christ and the form of
[1:02:25] the Holy Ghost that champion within will
[1:02:29] come and live in
[1:02:31] you you cannot overcome the world until
[1:02:34] you get the life of the Overcomer in
[1:02:38] you you can lo law your way all you want
[1:02:41] to you can put laws and regulations and
[1:02:43] rules and and people who look at the
[1:02:45] message is nothing but laws and
[1:02:47] regulations and rules is because they
[1:02:48] don't got the Life of Christ on the
[1:02:50] inside of them because if they had the
[1:02:52] Life of Christ in them they wouldn't
[1:02:54] look at laws and rules and regulations
[1:02:56] they would look at it as their
[1:02:58] protection amen that God is with them
[1:03:00] and for them and God so Lov me that he
[1:03:03] came down and he anointed a man to
[1:03:05] preach a message that would call me out
[1:03:07] of my sin call me out of denominational
[1:03:09] system or wherever he found
[1:03:11] me and bring me to this
[1:03:15] place he that was in Noah was greater
[1:03:19] than the judgments of
[1:03:21] water greater is he that was in David
[1:03:25] than the bear that show stole his sheep
[1:03:27] or the lion that stole his sheep or the
[1:03:30] great Philistine the giant that stood in
[1:03:32] his
[1:03:35] path you know Faith looks at tomorrow
[1:03:38] and says no matter what tomorrow brings
[1:03:41] I know God's already
[1:03:45] there that's what faith does faith looks
[1:03:48] beyond circumstances and situations and
[1:03:51] uh and you know faith is the
[1:03:56] Victory faith is the Victory and this is
[1:03:59] where David
[1:04:00] was as I've said before David didn't go
[1:04:03] into the valley because he fought well
[1:04:06] he wasn't a fighter he was a Shepherd he
[1:04:09] wasn't a soldier he was a Shepherd he
[1:04:12] wasn't a trained man he was a Shepherd
[1:04:14] that's right his greatest thing he ever
[1:04:17] did was keep take care of some bye bye
[1:04:20] by
[1:04:22] B he was the last the totem pole in his
[1:04:25] family let's just be honest even when
[1:04:28] the when the prophet came to anoint a
[1:04:30] new king and knew it was coming out of
[1:04:32] the house of that Jesse he comes to the
[1:04:34] house of Jesse and Jesse brings all of
[1:04:35] his sons nope ain't this one nope ain't
[1:04:38] this one nope nope nope nope down the
[1:04:42] last one
[1:04:44] nope you got another son cuz God told me
[1:04:47] to come to your
[1:04:49] house his dad didn't even think enough
[1:04:52] about him he's like if anybody was going
[1:04:55] to be king it sure ain't going to be
[1:04:57] David I ain't going to call
[1:04:59] him but that was the one God was looking
[1:05:03] for and he said yeah well I got one more
[1:05:06] but he's out there he the Sheep Hur her
[1:05:08] go get him we ain't sitting down and eat
[1:05:10] until he gets here amen so he comes and
[1:05:13] he anoints him amen but David now
[1:05:15] anointed he didn't go down there amen
[1:05:18] because he fought well he yeah he had
[1:05:20] fought a bear he had fought a lion he'
[1:05:22] done all those things but he wasn't a
[1:05:24] trained soldier he didn't have armors he
[1:05:26] didn't have none of that he didn't go
[1:05:28] down in the valley because he fought he
[1:05:30] went down there because he
[1:05:32] believed right and he believed the same
[1:05:35] one who kept him from the line who kept
[1:05:38] him from the bear would be the same one
[1:05:40] that would keep him from
[1:05:42] Goliath and I'm telling you right now
[1:05:45] the only reason you got a Goliath in
[1:05:47] your path is cuz God wants you to know
[1:05:49] you're a
[1:05:51] David he wants you to know there's more
[1:05:54] in you there's a God that's in you
[1:05:56] that's greater than that one that stands
[1:05:58] before
[1:06:03] you so Goliath laughed throw his head
[1:06:06] back and laughed so I'm going to just
[1:06:08] stick you with my Spear and I'm going to
[1:06:10] hold you up in the air and let the birds
[1:06:12] eat your
[1:06:13] carcass David said I didn't come to
[1:06:17] you in the name of some great army or in
[1:06:22] my own belief system or what I think I
[1:06:25] come to you in the name of the Lord
[1:06:27] Jesus Christ today I'm going to cut your
[1:06:30] head
[1:06:32] off cuz he knew greater was in him and
[1:06:35] he said how much more is he greater
[1:06:37] that's in you than in that
[1:06:41] wheelchair greater is he that's in you
[1:06:44] that put you on that stretcher greater
[1:06:46] is he that's in you than that cancer
[1:06:48] greater is he that's in you than that
[1:06:49] Affliction greater is he that's in you
[1:06:51] than anything somebody say anything
[1:06:54] anything the devil could ever put on
[1:06:57] you anything the devil could ever lie to
[1:07:00] you about greater is he that's in you
[1:07:03] than he that's in the
[1:07:05] world yes
[1:07:11] sir Christ in you the hope of
[1:07:16] glory he that's in you that's Christ
[1:07:19] greater is he but you have to to have
[1:07:22] faith there has to have be something you
[1:07:25] can believe
[1:07:28] in now people some people can believe in
[1:07:30] stuff I never could believe
[1:07:32] in It's s right that's just the way it
[1:07:34] is you know they can believe in all kind
[1:07:36] of things they they can put their faith
[1:07:38] in all kinds of stuff but there's really

[1:18:43] unto God it's your faith that saved thee
[1:18:47] is what Jesus said receive thy sight thy

[1:19:00] with him begin to say with them
[1:19:01] themselves who is this that forgiveth

[1:19:12] Faith is the
[1:19:14] substance faith is the victory faith is
[1:19:19] what
[1:19:21] saves the the same word in the bible
[1:19:24] translated saved and healed is the same
[1:19:27] word all the way through the scripture
[1:19:29] saved and healed saved and healed saved
[1:19:31] in it's saved to the physical and saved
[1:19:33] in the spiritual it's both salvations
[1:19:36] both healings saved and heal the very
[1:19:39] same word all the way through the
[1:19:40] scriptures he said anyone knows that
[1:19:42] well you're saved spiritually or you're
[1:19:44] saved physically now he said the woman
[1:19:47] thy faith has saved thee physically
[1:19:49] saved you and now in redemption in
[1:19:52] atonement in the plan in the plan of God
[1:19:56] you can be spiritually saved or
[1:19:58] physically saved because he was wounded
[1:20:01] for our transgressions by his stripes we
[1:20:04] were healed it's all right there it just
[1:20:07] takes Faith it's according to our faith
[1:20:09] that we believe what he said he said if
[1:20:11] there wasn't a law that said Sons and
[1:20:14] Daughters of God would they said there
[1:20:16] wasn't a law uh uh saying this saying
[1:20:19] they couldn't do this Sons and Daughters
[1:20:20] of God would create a world out there
[1:20:22] and go live a private life on it he said
[1:20:24] that's the power that's in you to do it
[1:20:27] if you got a shadow of the power of God
[1:20:30] in you you've got power to do
[1:20:33] it
[1:20:36] hello go create my own world and go live
[1:20:39] privately on it boy that sounds real
[1:20:40] good right
[1:20:42] now God is omnipotent see what I mean
[1:20:45] the power that's in you will make you
[1:20:47] can speak a whole world into existence
[1:20:49] and go live on it there you are that's
[1:20:51] what power is is in the church
[1:20:56] now but see it's not God's desire for us
[1:20:59] to speak another world into exist he's
[1:21:01] already created us a world his desire is
[1:21:05] to take this world into
[1:21:08] subjection and let it be burned over
[1:21:10] with fire so the spirit of God can come
[1:21:12] down and create a new creation upon
[1:21:17] it it's a law of Faith Jesus said all
[1:21:21] things are possible to them that believe
[1:21:23] all
[1:21:24] things so that includes all things right
[1:21:28] of does all things include all things
[1:21:30] far as I know it does all things are
[1:21:32] impossible to them that believe and if
[1:21:34] you can believe it whatsoever God will
[1:21:36] lead your soul to believe it's yours
[1:21:37] every place the soul of your foot can
[1:21:39] set upon by faith God gives it to you
[1:21:41] amen it's yours it's your possession if
[1:21:44] you can find the key to this law of
[1:21:46] Faith it'll open it to you see the power
[1:21:49] is controlled he said if you are sons of
[1:21:51] God your daughters of God that never
[1:21:53] leaves you it's with you all the time
[1:21:55] but your faith gets away from it but
[1:21:58] it's still there so when you're saved
[1:22:00] God gives you Faith to rise from the
[1:22:03] muck of the earth your faith overcomes
[1:22:06] the things of the world what is it what
[1:22:08] does it your
[1:22:09] faith it overcomes the things of the
[1:22:12] world your faith in the act that God

[1:22:42] faith not just to rise above the muck of
[1:22:44] the world and become sons and daughters

[1:47:35] already have the
[1:47:40] word amen when you get down to business
[1:47:43] he said often wonder why does Christian
[1:47:45] want to frustrate them things amen with
[1:47:47] the things of the world men and women he
[1:47:49] said come to to me many times go back
[1:47:52] why do Christians want to frustrate
[1:47:53] themselves with them things anyhow men
[1:47:55] and women come to me many times and say
[1:47:57] their confession and so forth when I
[1:47:58] have those private interviews and meet
[1:48:00] them make confessions living Immortal
[1:48:01] and all kinds because they can't deny it
[1:48:03] the holy spirit's right there and if
[1:48:05] they try to cover it up it'll bring it
[1:48:06] out he say so they might as well tell it
[1:48:08] but if they try to get out the Holy
[1:48:09] Spirit stops them and say just a minute
[1:48:11] here's a certain certain thing but when
[1:48:12] they come they begin to tell me about
[1:48:13] the little things of the world I noticed
[1:48:15] amongst the Believers you're going
[1:48:17] somewhere what are you drifting for get
[1:48:19] an ambition about you set your goal on
[1:48:22] Christ and quit tallying with the world
[1:48:24] he said you pick up a magazine say well
[1:48:26] now the Divine Healers of this day
[1:48:27] there's no such thing as Divine healers
[1:48:29] that'll put de my doubt in your mind
[1:48:31] somebody gets on the radio and preaches
[1:48:32] a pretty good sermon but says the days
[1:48:34] of Miracles are pass he said that'll
[1:48:36] weaken you he said get right with God
[1:48:38] either be what you are or don't be at
[1:48:41] all if God's Bible doesn't teach it then
[1:48:43] get away from it but if it does teach it
[1:48:45] stay with
[1:48:49] it
[1:48:53] said for instance what if we're going to
[1:48:55] take a little trip in 30 days from now
[1:48:57] to another land and in this land the
[1:48:59] climate was so wonderful till you never
[1:49:02] come back no
[1:49:03] more over there we would never have to
[1:49:06] die or get old we' just be there
[1:49:10] forever he said I could I imagine seeing
[1:49:12] you go around to a 10- cent store buying
[1:49:15] a lot of junk to take with you you'd be
[1:49:18] trying to get rid of the junk you had
[1:49:19] amen
[1:49:20] he said when you just frustrate yourself
[1:49:22] with joining one church or this or that
[1:49:24] and you act accumulate more junk he said
[1:49:26] but if that but if you just think of
[1:49:28] where you're going you'll get a rid of a
[1:49:31] lot of doubt and
[1:49:34] nonsense you'll have real faith I say to
[1:49:37] people are you brother BR he said are
[1:49:38] you they say brother brand are you the
[1:49:40] one to pray for sick yes well that's
[1:49:42] against my faith said you ain't got any
[1:49:45] faith said that's what the Bible
[1:49:47] teaches there so many people come to the
[1:49:49] line they say well I've got all Faith
[1:49:51] then what you doing up here
[1:49:54] then hello
[1:49:57] somebody just tell what he said oh it
[1:49:59] isn't so real Faith knows no
[1:50:03] defeat it will never be defeated even
[1:50:06] death itself can't defeat it it knows no
[1:50:08] defeat trials no defeat but Faith knows
[1:50:10] no defeat it cannot be defeated it's the
[1:50:13] only way that you can please God without
[1:50:15] faith it's impossible to please God and
[1:50:17] then in this place could I imagine you
[1:50:19] go around some of you using slang slang
[1:50:21] using Christians using smudy dirty words
[1:50:24] you belong to a church could I imagine
[1:50:25] you're going over to that other land in
[1:50:27] America learning all the American slang
[1:50:28] you here about certainly wouldn't the
[1:50:30] thing you'd be trying to do would learn
[1:50:31] a few words of that language over
[1:50:35] there did I read that right he said I I
[1:50:39] I think You' try to be learning a few
[1:50:40] words of that language over there as
[1:50:42] much as you say how do you do anyhow he
[1:50:44] said I think it would behoove Christians
[1:50:46] more today if they try to learn some
[1:50:48] Heavenly language
[1:50:50] the Praises of God that we're going to
[1:50:53] sing over there enjy and the people
[1:50:55] that's not going to believe that does
[1:50:56] not believe in shouting what would you
[1:50:58] do when you get over there you're going
[1:51:00] to be out of place you better get Faith
[1:51:03] and overcome now for faith is a victory
[1:51:05] that overcome no we wouldn't be tagging
[1:51:08] little things like that we would be
[1:51:09] having
[1:51:11] Victory he says how do I do it brother
[1:51:14] Brown he said it's so simple yes sir it
[1:51:18] is just give yourself over to the Holy
[1:51:25] Spirit then it isn't you
[1:51:28] anymore you don't know what you're going
[1:51:30] to say you just let him do the saying
[1:51:33] it's so simple as
[1:51:40] that got a few more minutes he said many
[1:51:43] of you people have faith in in your
[1:51:45] doctors you should if you got a doctor
[1:51:48] so when something gets wrong with you
[1:51:49] you go to that old fa faithful doctor
[1:51:50] you believe in that's what you should do
[1:51:52] that's good then you submit your case to
[1:51:55] him and if he says you should go to the
[1:51:56] hospital and you don't do a thing but go
[1:51:58] home and pack your clothes and you go to
[1:52:00] the hospital sure you got faith in the
[1:52:01] doctor but if he doesn't decide you want
[1:52:04] to go to the hospital or you should go
[1:52:05] rather he'd write out a prescription
[1:52:07] give you some pills hack full of pills
[1:52:09] and you'd swallow them you don't know
[1:52:11] what in those pills but you got faith in
[1:52:12] the doctor he said how about
[1:52:16] God can I say it again how about God
[1:52:20] you're scared to swallow some of the
[1:52:22] gospels he gives you by his stripes you
[1:52:25] were healed faith is a victory that
[1:52:26] overcomes the world swallow it and see
[1:52:29] what happens swallow it and see what
[1:52:32] happens it's a confidence you show what
[1:52:35] confidence you have in your doctor by
[1:52:37] taking his medicine then you don't know
[1:52:39] what it is you show your confidence in
[1:52:40] the doctor by submitting yourself to an
[1:52:42] operation that proves your confidence in
[1:52:45] the doctor but when it comes to Christ
[1:52:47] we're scared to take him at his word
[1:52:51] hello and you know God has never
[1:52:53] misdiagnosed a
[1:52:56] case I know doctors do all they can
[1:52:59] humanly speaking but they still make
[1:53:01] humans
[1:53:04] mistakes they have went in and pulled
[1:53:06] the wrong
[1:53:10] tooth they got x-rays they got all kinds
[1:53:12] of stuff and still go in and pull the
[1:53:14] wrong tooth it's happened before they go
[1:53:16] in and do some of the wrong things but
[1:53:18] do we quit go going to a
[1:53:20] dentist no do we quit going to doctors
[1:53:28] no why would we quit going to Jesus when
[1:53:31] he's never misdiagnosed a case when he's
[1:53:35] never lost a
[1:53:38] patient he's never overdosed
[1:53:41] anybody he won't give you more than what
[1:53:43] you can
[1:53:45] handle he'll give you exactly what you
[1:53:48] have he said submit your cas to Jesus
[1:53:50] Christ just as you submit your case to a
[1:53:55] doctor give me anything you want Lord
[1:53:58] You're the doctor on the case then you
[1:54:01] got the victory then you got faith that
[1:54:04] overcomes you'll never hunt another
[1:54:06] prayer line You'll never hunt nothing
[1:54:09] else you'll have it right then it's
[1:54:10] settled you'll never jump from church to
[1:54:12] church to see if this one's got or that
[1:54:13] one's got it you have it you got it when
[1:54:16] you got the faith you got the victory he
[1:54:19] said what we need today is to let doct
[1:54:22] Jesus come in and perform an operation
[1:54:24] on our
[1:54:26] faith the doctor tells you you got a
[1:54:28] little appendix it's all poison it ought
[1:54:30] to come out you got this that it needs
[1:54:31] to come out well he takes out so the
[1:54:34] rest of you can live can function that's
[1:54:36] what the matter tonight with our faith
[1:54:38] we're afraid to let God take his
[1:54:40] operating word his knife sharper than in
[1:54:43] two-edged sword and operate on us and
[1:54:46] tell us that our little Fandango hung um
[1:54:49] bugging around is
[1:54:55] wrong your laxidasical
[1:55:00] attitude your depression your anxieties
[1:55:04] your fears are
[1:55:06] wrong it's
[1:55:12] unbelief we've got to turn loose every
[1:55:16] shadow and sail towards God's Eternal
[1:55:19] promise
[1:55:20] he said if we'll do that Jesus will
[1:55:22] perform the operation of Faith taking
[1:55:25] away all doubt all fears all worries all
[1:55:30] sin when our faith is clearly operated
[1:55:33] on then come out a new creation can you
[1:55:36] trust Jesus for an
[1:55:43] operation can you believe him can you
[1:55:45] say Lord at Thy
[1:55:48] Word
[1:55:51] we've done all we can but at Thy word
[1:55:53] nevertheless Lord at Thy word I'll let
[1:55:55] down the net Lord I'm a fisherman I know
[1:55:58] what I'm doing I know the signs of the
[1:55:59] moon I I know when they're biting when
[1:56:01] they're not I know all the schools and
[1:56:03] the theologies I know all but at Thy
[1:56:05] word I'm going to let down the net and
[1:56:08] when they did they enclosed such a
[1:56:11] multitude of fishes to their Nets almost
[1:56:13] broke faith is the victory there might
[1:56:16] not have been one fish in the water but
[1:56:19] God made the promise he will create a
[1:56:22] fish when you throw the net
[1:56:25] in there might not be a chance for you
[1:56:28] to live you might be dying with cancer
[1:56:30] you might be bound to a wheelchair you
[1:56:32] might be totally blind I don't know what
[1:56:33] your trouble is but if you'll take the
[1:56:35] chief doctor's prescription yes
[1:56:38] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:56:40] pray believe you receive them and you
[1:56:42] shall have them and believe that that
[1:56:44] faith will overcome any difficulty that
[1:56:47] there is my God you may be so burdened
[1:56:51] with sin until your soul is as smudy as
[1:56:53] you can be you might have tried to get
[1:56:54] rid of that ill temper and that
[1:56:56] slandering tongue and that gossip it
[1:56:58] might have tried you might have tried
[1:56:59] ever remedy but if you'll let Jesus come
[1:57:01] tonight and operate on your faith and
[1:57:04] give you a faith that'll climb beyond
[1:57:07] anything the world could ever
[1:57:09] produce a victory that'll overcome the
[1:57:12] world let's power our
[1:57:18] hearts
[1:57:24] Faith to
[1:57:29] overcome Faith to rise above it
[1:57:41] all many of
[1:57:45] us I never had to up to this point about
[1:57:50] the worst thing has happened is a broken
[1:57:52] arm one time that cracked actually and
[1:57:54] they just put a cast but many of us has
[1:57:57] had to submit ourselves to an
[1:58:01] operation faith enough to let them give
[1:58:03] us something that'll put us out Faith to
[1:58:06] believe they'll give us something else
[1:58:07] to wake us back
[1:58:09] up and while we're out they're doing
[1:58:11] what they're supposed to do it's going
[1:58:13] to fix and allow other things to operate
[1:58:16] how they're supposed to operate what
[1:58:18] about right now would you have faith to
[1:58:21] believe and allow
[1:58:24] God to come and operate on your
[1:58:29] faith how many can say Lord I I just
