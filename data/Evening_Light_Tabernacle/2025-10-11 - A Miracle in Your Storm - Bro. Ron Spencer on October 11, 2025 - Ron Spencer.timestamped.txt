[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And who are you, oh great mountain
[44:18] &gt;&gt; before this bride, she will it will
[44:21] fall. It can't stand against you.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; We are more than conquerors to him that
[44:26] loved us.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, what God's looking for in this
[44:30] hour is somebody that'll believe him.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody that take him at his word.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to do that tonight?
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:40] I'm just thinking of something
[44:43] that I want to share with you from the
[44:46] prophet of God before we pray over the
[44:48] request. Jesus is the sweetest name I
[44:51] know.
[44:54] Brother Bradom said that healing it is a
[44:57] finished work.
[44:59] Christ did it on Calvary.
[45:02] And if he can only come into your heart
[45:05] and open your heart till you can see the
[45:08] finished work, it's finished when you
[45:12] accept it. Salvation is the same. If
[45:15] there's power to heal a man, there's
[45:17] power to save a man. Man was both saved
[45:21] and healed when Christ died at Calvary.
[45:24] For he was wounded for our
[45:27] transgressions and with his stripes we
[45:30] were healed.
[45:32] Therefore, that little door, that's
[45:35] faith. Now, listen to this. You say,
[45:38] "Oh,
[45:40] I'll give it a try."
[45:43] Faith doesn't try.
[45:45] Oh, blessed be his name. Faith knows
[45:48] where he's standing. Faith has got big
[45:51] muscles and a hairy chest.
[45:54] And when he stands and raises up his big
[45:56] muscles, everything contrary sets down.
[46:00] He lets out a scream and it sounds like
[46:03] a panther screaming and every jack
[46:06] rabbit takes to his den. Faith is the
[46:08] boss. All things are possible to them
[46:12] that believe all things. Or you say, I
[46:16] might ask God too much, brother
[46:18] Brandham. You can't ask him enough.
[46:21] He loves to do it for you. Could you
[46:24] imagine a little fish a half inch long
[46:26] out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean
[46:28] saying, "Well, I better drink of this
[46:31] waters apparently, I might run out
[46:33] someday."
[46:35] That would be nonsense.
[46:37] And it would be more nonsense to think
[46:41] you could ever exhaust the father's
[46:43] goodwill to do things for you. Could you
[46:47] imagine a little mouse about so long
[46:49] under the great garners of Egypt saying,
[46:52] "Now just a moment. There's only 450
[46:56] billion tons in this garner. So maybe I
[46:59] better eat just one grain a day cuz I
[47:02] might run out in the springtime."
[47:05] Of course, that's the way some
[47:07] Christians think God is trying to
[47:10] allowance yourself. just join the
[47:13] church, just doing this, or I just do
[47:15] the best I can. If you do the best you
[47:19] can, you'll believe every promise God
[47:22] made that is for you. You can never ask
[47:25] him too much. He loves to give it to
[47:28] you. Ask that your abundance that your
[47:31] joys might be full. Just ask for great
[47:34] things and believe for great things. How
[47:37] many's ready to believe for great
[47:38] things?
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe God's got great things
[47:42] in store for us.
[47:45] He's got healing, deliverance,
[47:46] salvation, everything, every promise in
[47:49] the book. We're not living in a day and
[47:52] an hour where there's seals on the book.
[47:55] The book has been unsealed. The
[47:57] mysteries have been revealed. The whole
[48:00] land of the promise is open to us. Every
[48:03] promise in the book is yours tonight.
[48:06] You can have it.
[48:08] Hallelujah.
[48:10] We're going to speak the name of Jesus.
[48:13] We're going to believe for you tonight
[48:15] for the needs that you have in your
[48:17] life. Our brother Sherman Thomas is sick
[48:19] tonight. Wasn't able to come to church.
[48:22] We had prayer last night for brother
[48:23] Buster Wiggins.
[48:26] We continue to pray for him. I'm sure
[48:28] there's needs here. Will you stand with
[48:30] me and let's just if you got a need to
[48:32] God, just raise your hand right now as I
[48:33] pray. Father, in the name of Jesus,
[48:37] the name of Jesus is higher than all
[48:39] names.
[48:41] For at the name of Jesus, every knee has
[48:44] to bow and every tongue confess that you
[48:46] are Lord, your Lord over every sickness,
[48:49] disease, problem, situation. And I'm
[48:52] asking in the name of Jesus, oh God,
[48:55] that every knee tonight will bow to that
[48:58] name, knowing and believing that the
[49:01] word is true, then sickness has to bow.
[49:04] Death has to give way. Cancer has to
[49:07] leave. Oh God, your promises are ours
[49:11] tonight. And they are yes and they are
[49:13] amen. I speak healing tonight over this
[49:16] congregation. I don't care what a
[49:18] condition that it is. If it's a physical
[49:21] need, a spiritual need, a financial
[49:23] need, you are our God and you're able to
[49:26] supply all our needs according to your
[49:28] riches and glory. So we ask that you
[49:30] would do it now. Touch our brothers,
[49:32] Lord, that we've mentioned tonight. The
[49:34] hands went across this congregation. May
[49:37] you just bless them with your healing
[49:39] touch in Jesus name. Amen. Tonight,
[49:45] as we come to this service,
[49:49] I'm very honored to have with us our
[49:51] brother Ron Spencer.
[49:53] Brother Ron is loved by all of us,
[49:56] people across the world, and pray for
[49:58] him daily.
[50:02] Been over five years ago, the doctors
[50:05] told him he wouldn't live by four
[50:06] months. Gave him four months to live.
[50:10] He's defied all odds. But you know what
[50:13] it's been? It isn't because of
[50:15] medication. The medicine's actually
[50:18] killing him. But I tell you what, it's
[50:21] been because of the power of the living
[50:23] God. He's alive today. A testimony of
[50:27] the grace of God.
[50:34] I just think about just um some time
[50:37] ago, brother Donnie Reagan and I
[50:40] who also loves Brother Ron very much and
[50:43] we love Brother Donnie
[50:46] and he met us there with to pray with
[50:49] Brother Ron who had cancer now in both
[50:52] eyes after getting in the lungs and then
[50:56] go into the brain and then and then now
[50:59] would come into his eyes And they would
[51:01] say that was going to have to take his
[51:04] eye out and then treat the other with
[51:06] chemo. Tried to to save his life.
[51:10] And he would suffer with blindness. A
[51:13] complete removal of the eye.
[51:17] Went through all of the specialist test.
[51:20] I was there. I was there. I was present
[51:23] when he got the call and they were
[51:26] telling him all the procedures what they
[51:28] would do.
[51:31] I was with him in that moment. We sat
[51:34] down and to eat breakfast together. I
[51:37] just arrived and we had prayer together
[51:40] and talk with him. Those of you that are
[51:44] full from full gospel lighthouse,
[51:46] brother Donnie preached a wonderful
[51:48] message inspired our faith and then I
[51:51] preached on a sermon called the hour has
[51:53] come
[51:55] because we had reached a very critical
[51:58] hour.
[51:59] You know, something had to be done
[52:03] here. You know, he was facing the
[52:06] removal of an eye and chemo in the other
[52:08] and loss of vision and all of this.
[52:11] It was very dire situation.
[52:16] But you know, as we prayed with him that
[52:18] day and the Holy Spirit just came down
[52:21] and he would go back to the doctor and
[52:24] just following up on the treatments to
[52:26] to to follow up and they would go
[52:29] through, yeah, the cancer's there. Send
[52:31] him to another doctor. Yes, this is what
[52:33] the procedure to do. Yes, we see it
[52:35] there. And they go to the next one and
[52:37] to the next one. come down to the very
[52:39] last one.
[52:43] And he looks at all the reports and he
[52:44] says looked in the eye and he said, "No,
[52:48] no cancer. It's all gone. We've made a
[52:51] mistake. That's all. We just made a
[52:53] misdiagnosis.
[52:55] We know.
[52:58] We know what God did."
[53:01] Amen. We saw the hand of God. The hour
[53:04] had come for deliverance. I want you to
[53:08] know we are at a critical hour. There
[53:11] there is trouble in our land. There's
[53:14] trouble in politics. There's trouble in
[53:16] government. There's trouble in the
[53:17] world. And we are in a very very
[53:20] critical hour. And the hour has come.
[53:23] And it's come and it requires somebody
[53:27] who believe God's promise.
[53:30] Somebody that'll put faith into action.
[53:33] You know, it's great to come and agree
[53:35] with the word, but you've got to put it
[53:37] in action in your life. Faith is an
[53:41] action word. I said that last night.
[53:43] You've got to put it into action.
[53:46] We must believe. If there was ever a
[53:49] time for us to step out in faith, it's
[53:52] right now, this hour, this time to
[53:56] believe for your miracle. Last night, we
[54:00] heard from the Lord. God spoke to us
[54:02] directly and I I just I just trust that
[54:07] you know he's writing in your life a new
[54:10] story rewriting from the sorrows, the
[54:13] troubles of the past. That you can hear
[54:16] from God tonight and through this
[54:18] message that your future is clear.
[54:20] There's a rapture ahead for you. You're
[54:23] not just going to make it. You've
[54:25] already made it because we've read the
[54:28] end of the book and we know we are more
[54:31] than overcomers. We are the conquerors.
[54:34] God bless you. As our brother Ron comes
[54:37] tonight, I want you just to open your
[54:40] heart to the Lord and let God speak to
[54:43] you. Let him minister you in a special
[54:45] way.
[54:49] Jesus
[54:50] is the sweetest
[54:54] name
[54:55] I know.
[54:57] Oh, what a lovely name.
[55:01] And he's just the same
[55:07] as
[55:09] his lovely name. Can you say that
[55:13] tonight? That's the reason why
[55:19] I love him so
[55:23] [Music]
[55:26] far
[55:28] Jesus
[55:30] is the sweetest
[55:33] name I know. Can you raise your hand to
[55:36] God right now and sing it one more time?
[55:40] Where my Jesus
[55:43] is.
[55:44] the sweetest
[55:46] name
[55:48] I know. There's just no one like you,
[55:51] Lord.
[55:53] And he's just the same
[56:00] as
[56:01] his lovely name.
[56:06] And that's the reason
[56:10] why I love him.
[56:16] [Music]
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it one more time.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Oh
[56:34] Jesus.
[56:37] the sweetest
[56:39] name
[56:41] I know.
[56:46] And he's just the same
[56:53] as his
[56:56] name.
[56:58] [Music]
[56:59] And that's the reason
[57:03] why I love him so
[57:09] [Music]
[57:13] Jesus is
[57:16] the sweetest name.
[57:19] [Music]
[57:24] Hallelujah.
[57:26] Isn't he wonderful?
[57:28] He is so wonderful to us and I'm so
[57:31] honored to stand here before you again.
[57:33] And so many of you I know and got new
[57:36] friends with us and so glad to see you
[57:39] and meet you and and so glad to have so
[57:43] many friends from home and we love you.
[57:47] What a wonderful meeting already.
[57:50] Amen. Brother Andrew on Thursday night
[57:54] and then last night I I just I actually
[57:58] asked him if he would go ahead and speak
[58:00] tonight. And so Amen. What a wonderful
[58:03] time. Amen. We so love you with all of
[58:06] our hearts and so thank you for your
[58:08] prayers.
[58:10] You know when brother Tim was speaking
[58:11] of those things, they're true.
[58:16] We were there. We lived it.
[58:18] Sister Connie and I walked down about an
[58:20] 80 foot aisle way and going to the last
[58:25] doctor knowing what they were getting
[58:28] ready to do.
[58:31] Our hearts was
[58:34] just tore apart.
[58:37] And when we got to the end of that hunt
[58:40] there and we met with the doctor and
[58:44] he said, "I'll see you in a year."
[58:48] I said, "Okay."
[58:50] He said, "You're good."
[58:53] So we called him back in and said,
[58:56] "We've been told we've got cancer." He
[58:58] said, "Well, it was a misunderstanding."
[59:06] I like misunderstandings.
[59:08] Don't you?
[59:10] [Applause]
[59:20] We were just with a team of doctors and
[59:22] I'll share this will be my first time to
[59:24] share it but
[59:26] we had our brain uh MRI and and uh for
[59:31] those that don't know I've been
[59:32] suffering from brain u stage four brain
[59:35] and lung cancer
[59:38] and and uh got a brain MRI and and so
[59:43] they they brought us then said it was
[59:44] clear, which means there's no big cancer
[59:47] working and and so we continue the chemo
[59:51] every day and and so he was he's been a
[59:54] real friendly doctor, wonderful doctor
[59:56] to me and I always get a good hug from
[59:58] him and and uh he's the kind of guy
[1:00:02] that's just so caring and so he gave me
[1:00:04] all the legal jargon and all the things
[1:00:06] to say and he cut off his recorder
[1:00:10] and he said, "Uh, Ron, I'd like to talk
[1:00:12] to you a bit." He said, "We have we have
[1:00:16] teams of doctors from all over the world
[1:00:18] come and we talk about this brain cancer
[1:00:22] that you you've got." And he said, "Um,
[1:00:27] I would like to ask you." He said,
[1:00:29] "We've never did this before, but we
[1:00:31] don't we've never had one like you." And
[1:00:34] he
[1:00:36] he said, "I'd like for you to start
[1:00:39] coming to our meetings." and and uh be a
[1:00:43] representative for us.
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:48] I'd like to be God's testimony. Don't
[1:00:50] you?
[1:00:51] I like it with all of our hearts.
[1:01:00] Hallelujah.
[1:01:01] Hallelujah.
[1:01:04] Amen. It ain't good to us.
[1:01:07] That doesn't mean that there's not bad
[1:01:09] days and not a lot of sickness and not a
[1:01:12] lot lot of all of that. But no matter
[1:01:14] your trial,
[1:01:16] he'll bring you through it. He'll
[1:01:19] absolutely bring you through it. I'm
[1:01:21] glad to have my chief nurse with us
[1:01:22] today and and she's such a trooper and
[1:01:26] sister Connie. So glad to have her with
[1:01:28] us. Amen.
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:38] I so love the songs tonight because they
[1:01:40] seem to line up perfectly. God
[1:01:43] orchestrates everything. And so, Amen.
[1:01:46] If you will turn with me to Luke chapter
[1:01:48] 8 and verse 41.
[1:01:54] Amen.
[1:01:56] Luke chapter 8 and verse for 41. I'd
[1:02:00] like to just talk to you a little bit
[1:02:02] about a miracle in your storm.
[1:02:11] Every one of us are going to have some
[1:02:13] storms.
[1:02:16] Every one of us are going to have a
[1:02:18] storms. But I'm a Christian, brother
[1:02:20] Ron. You're going to have some storms.
[1:02:24] The difference is he's going to be with
[1:02:26] you.
[1:02:28] Whether you feel like he's a million
[1:02:30] miles away or you feel like he's
[1:02:32] carrying you, he's with you.
[1:02:36] It's not based on your feelings.
[1:02:39] It's based on the word of God.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; And you can always look back after your
[1:02:44] past your storm and you're looking at
[1:02:47] your rainbow and say, "Without God, I
[1:02:50] would not have made it through it."
[1:02:53] And I can say after 5 years without God
[1:02:56] I would not have made it through it.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke chapter 8 and verse 41. And
[1:03:03] behold there came a man named Jarius.
[1:03:07] And he was a ruler of the synagogue.
[1:03:10] And he fell down at Jesus's feet and
[1:03:12] besought him that he would come into his
[1:03:15] house.
[1:03:18] for he had only one one only daughter
[1:03:23] about 12 years of age and she lay a
[1:03:27] dying. But as he went the people thawned
[1:03:31] him and a woman having an issue of blood
[1:03:34] 12 years which had spent all of her
[1:03:37] living upon physicians
[1:03:40] neither
[1:03:41] could be healed healed of any.
[1:03:46] came before him and touched the border
[1:03:48] of his garments. And immediately her
[1:03:51] issue of blood staunched.
[1:03:54] And Jesus said, "Who touched me?" And
[1:03:57] when all denied, Peter and they that
[1:04:00] were with him said, "Master, the
[1:04:03] multitude throng thee, and press thee,
[1:04:06] and sayest thou,
[1:04:08] who touched me?" And Jesus said,
[1:04:10] "Somebody hath touched me, for I
[1:04:13] perceived that virtue is gone from me."
[1:04:17] And when the woman saw that she was not
[1:04:20] hid, she came trembling and falling down
[1:04:24] before him, and declared unto him, and
[1:04:26] before all the people that for what
[1:04:29] cause that she had touched him, and how
[1:04:32] that she was healed immediately.
[1:04:36] And he said unto her, "Daughter,
[1:04:39] be of good comfort.
[1:04:42] Thy faith hath made thee whole.
[1:04:46] Go in peace."
[1:04:49] Maybe you have a need tonight and God
[1:04:52] has arranged this service for you and
[1:04:55] you would like him to speak to you.
[1:04:58] You've been going through some trials.
[1:05:01] You say, "Lord, I need you. It's all
[1:05:05] right to be dead honest with God and
[1:05:07] say, "God, I can't do this on my own. I
[1:05:10] need you.
[1:05:12] Could you just raise your hands before
[1:05:14] the Lord now?
[1:05:17] Father,
[1:05:21] I so love you with all my heart.
[1:05:26] All of us as ministers stand here
[1:05:28] tonight and know without you, we can't
[1:05:32] do anything.
[1:05:34] But I'm so amazed that how that you can
[1:05:38] take the lips of man
[1:05:42] and inspire him with the word of God
[1:05:45] and you can go to situations in lives
[1:05:49] and we can walk out of this building a
[1:05:52] complete different person.
[1:05:55] Now father may our faith reach to a
[1:05:58] different realm tonight.
[1:06:01] Help us. Help us to look past our storm
[1:06:04] just for a moment. Now I ask you that
[1:06:07] you'd minister to every hand that has
[1:06:09] went up. I too have need. I pray that
[1:06:13] you'd strengthen us in a special way. We
[1:06:15] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen
[1:06:20] and amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:06:22] seated.
[1:06:26] I just want to remind you that every
[1:06:28] miracle
[1:06:30] before every miracle
[1:06:33] there's a mess.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Every miracle has a moment
[1:06:40] to where the things begin to change. We
[1:06:44] understand that and and this is just a
[1:06:47] simple principle that you have to know
[1:06:48] as a Christian. You can't worry and pray
[1:06:52] at the same time.
[1:06:57] You can't worry. That has no virtue in
[1:06:59] it whatsoever.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; It's actually anti-faith.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; You can't worry and pray at the same
[1:07:07] time.
[1:07:09] Now, sometimes we realize our miracle
[1:07:11] has happened and and we can step forth
[1:07:14] and rejoice and praise and then there's
[1:07:17] other times that the miracle takes place
[1:07:19] and we begin to walk and we realize that
[1:07:23] I don't have that condition no more.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; We walk in faith. We talk in faith. Our
[1:07:30] confession begins to build. We
[1:07:33] understand. We understand that our life
[1:07:35] is orchestrated of God. God pre-plans
[1:07:39] our life. He watches over us. We've
[1:07:41] heard it the last couple of nights how
[1:07:43] God that is always with us. We make
[1:07:45] choices a lot of times that doesn't
[1:07:48] please him very well, but he don't throw
[1:07:51] us away.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Uh we make choices that later in our
[1:07:59] lives we will regret.
[1:08:01] But we look at a constant God that has
[1:08:04] always been with us, that has taken care
[1:08:06] of us, that's been there to provide for
[1:08:08] us, to watch over us, and in our
[1:08:12] ignorance, he still loved us.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe maybe
[1:08:20] your miracle has been even hundreds of
[1:08:22] years in the making.
[1:08:25] DNA that you've carried since your
[1:08:27] birth, situations of your life that has
[1:08:30] taken place,
[1:08:32] but you have a divine appointment. Maybe
[1:08:35] tonight
[1:08:37] you have a divine appointment. Sister
[1:08:40] Carne and I have spent thousands and
[1:08:43] thousands of hours in doctor's offices.
[1:08:47] And if you've been to a doctor's office
[1:08:49] lately, they're
[1:08:51] they're not they're not necessarily on
[1:08:54] your time,
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; they're on their time.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; And there's times that you have to wait
[1:08:59] for hours. Sister Connie is quite a
[1:09:01] patient person. And let me just drop
[1:09:03] this here. She has taken me
[1:09:07] to to the clinics two and three times a
[1:09:10] week. And sometimes the clinic starts at
[1:09:12] 9:00 in the morning, sometimes 6:00 in
[1:09:14] the morning, and sometimes it's dark in
[1:09:16] the evening before we leave. To this
[1:09:19] day, she's never complained one time.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; That's a miracle. That's a miracle. God
[1:09:27] bless sister Connie.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Now, we we understand through the
[1:09:31] scriptures that there's been a lot of
[1:09:33] messes or a lot of situations that look
[1:09:35] totally impossible to take place. Let me
[1:09:39] just go through a couple just for a
[1:09:41] moment. Sarah was barren.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Not just a few days, but nine decades.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; And we talk about what a phenomenal
[1:09:52] miracle that happened in her life, but
[1:09:55] nine decades
[1:09:57] she suffered with being barren.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Job had phenomenal amount of things that
[1:10:05] took place. Isaac when it comes toward
[1:10:08] the end of his life and a blessing has
[1:10:10] happened we don't understand everything
[1:10:12] but Isaac becomes blind
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; he would have never picked Jacob
[1:10:20] but God has to allow blindness
[1:10:25] are you with me
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; he has to allow blindness to happen to
[1:10:29] where now I I I don't know everything
[1:10:31] I'm not going to stand here and try to
[1:10:33] explain everything but he would have
[1:10:35] never picked Jacob
[1:10:39] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego we heard
[1:10:42] about last night.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. They had a
[1:10:46] quick trial.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; They had to stand in a moment. They had
[1:10:52] to they had to act and have faith on the
[1:10:54] word of God. There was a man named Blad
[1:10:57] Barnabas
[1:10:58] that suffered his entire life, but he
[1:11:02] had a moment.
[1:11:06] Lazarus was Jesus's friend,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; but no doubt there was some complaining
[1:11:12] by his neighbors. If Jesus was your
[1:11:14] friend, where's he at right now?
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Then they begin to call for Jesus and
[1:11:20] Jesus didn't come.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; But there was a plan.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; They didn't get a letter from the
[1:11:26] government saying, "Hey, Jesus is on a
[1:11:28] mission
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; and it's all going to be all right."
[1:11:31] Listen, he had to die.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; They had to roll a stone in front of him
[1:11:38] because the appointment with Jesus was
[1:11:41] after the stone was laid.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; So everything is orchestrated
[1:11:51] of God in our lives.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; We all have difficulties and situations.
[1:11:56] Tonight in this meeting, there's two
[1:11:58] people that I'd like to just share with
[1:11:59] a little testimony with you. And I so
[1:12:02] love brother Tim's meeting meeting on
[1:12:04] Sunday and and uh he told us he said you
[1:12:08] got to tell these stories they got to be
[1:12:10] real and just keep keep the fire alive.
[1:12:13] Keep an upto-date story of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:16] No, we're not trying to be brother
[1:12:18] Brandham but God works in our lives.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; He works in your lives
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; in the building. This is the first time
[1:12:26] that in a meeting that I've had these
[1:12:28] two and and so I I'll just I just want
[1:12:31] to share this with you. We have a
[1:12:33] brother Marcus. Brother Marcus, I I
[1:12:35] haven't found you yet. Brother Marcus,
[1:12:37] are you here? Would you stand up for us?
[1:12:39] There we are. Could you just keep
[1:12:40] standing for a moment? I'm going to be
[1:12:42] standing for a while.
[1:12:46] Brother Marcus and myself had not known
[1:12:48] one another up until 22 years ago. I was
[1:12:52] going home from a meeting like here and
[1:12:56] uh when I got to the air airport uh they
[1:12:59] told me said uh your plane has been
[1:13:01] cancelled and and uh you're probably not
[1:13:04] going to get home. And I begged them to
[1:13:06] I said whatever you got to do I I got to
[1:13:07] get home. And so they actually switched
[1:13:12] uh even the one one air air to another
[1:13:16] airport and they put me on a they put me
[1:13:19] on a plane.
[1:13:21] They put me at a window seat
[1:13:23] and and there was a guy that was sitting
[1:13:25] beside him and he was a jabber box.
[1:13:30] I was wore out. I was in a wet suit from
[1:13:32] preaching and I thought, "Oh jeez,
[1:13:36] this guy talked. We about two and a half
[1:13:39] hours in flight, maybe more than that."
[1:13:41] And this guy just rattled off. And you
[1:13:44] know, we were getting ready to land and
[1:13:46] you know, you're coming in to land and
[1:13:47] uh and and he asked me, he said, 'What
[1:13:49] do you do? My first chance to talk.
[1:13:56] What do you do? And I said, "Well, I'm a
[1:13:58] preacher." And I have a long time to
[1:14:00] speak to him and and I wore out and and
[1:14:03] he said, "What do you do?" I said,
[1:14:04] "Well, I'm a preacher." And I said, "I I
[1:14:06] preach the message of William Brham."
[1:14:11] Brother Marcus was sitting on the aisle
[1:14:13] and he'd been looking at a magazine the
[1:14:15] whole time. He just kind of had his arms
[1:14:18] on his legs and he'd been he'd been
[1:14:20] looking at this magazine just flipping
[1:14:22] pages and and you could just tell he was
[1:14:25] bored out of his mind and and he said,
[1:14:28] "I grew up in the message."
[1:14:31] And he told me two different stories for
[1:14:32] me to identify that he had grew up in
[1:14:35] the message. plane landed. They got off
[1:14:38] of the flight and I said, "Well, maybe
[1:14:39] they'll wait for me. I'd like to meet
[1:14:40] him, shake his hand, pray with him,
[1:14:42] whatever." And he told me while I was on
[1:14:44] the plane, he said, "My life is
[1:14:46] devastated."
[1:14:48] He said, "I'm out of the church." He
[1:14:49] said, he said, "I I I think he said,
[1:14:52] "I'm divorced. I I I I I've got a great
[1:14:55] job, but my life is just just
[1:14:57] destroyed."
[1:15:01] Well, I told that story in a lot of
[1:15:03] meetings
[1:15:04] looking for him.
[1:15:10] 18 years went by
[1:15:14] and some people from North Carolina,
[1:15:16] some of you are here, came to begin to
[1:15:19] come to our church
[1:15:22] and we had a fellowship to where that we
[1:15:24] could I could get to meet them. And and
[1:15:27] so I I walked through the parking lot
[1:15:29] with brother Marcus. I didn't know who
[1:15:31] he was. And we walked in and we just did
[1:15:34] small talk. We sat down. I think we had
[1:15:36] pizza. And we're sitting there now. I've
[1:15:39] I've said I I'd like to meet that man
[1:15:41] again. I'd like to be able to lead him
[1:15:43] to Christ. I'd like to to get him sat
[1:15:46] round settled in life. I I'd like to I'd
[1:15:49] like to become a buddy to him.
[1:15:52] I'd look for him for all these 18 years.
[1:15:54] And I'm sitting there at the table and
[1:15:56] the Lord whispers in my ear, "The man
[1:15:59] you've been looking for is sitting
[1:16:00] beside of you,
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; brother. I don't know if I believe
[1:16:09] that." Well, what if I was wrong?
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And I looked at him and I said, "You and
[1:16:16] I have met before." And he just quickly
[1:16:17] said, "No, no, we haven't met before.
[1:16:24] And he was just quick. He was quick to
[1:16:26] brush me off. No, we hadn't met before.
[1:16:29] And I said, 'Yeah, we've met before.'
[1:16:30] And he said, "No, I I don't think so."
[1:16:33] And I said, "We met on a plane."
[1:16:37] And I just told him the same story I
[1:16:39] just told you. And he put his hands on
[1:16:42] his face and he said, "The love of God.
[1:16:57] I want to tell you if your loved ones
[1:16:59] are look like they're so gone and so
[1:17:02] destroyed and so messed up in life and
[1:17:05] divorced and all kind of situations of
[1:17:08] life, there's a God.
[1:17:11] [Applause]
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; There's a God that totally cares and
[1:17:17] understands.
[1:17:23] Just before di being diagnosed with
[1:17:25] cancer,
[1:17:27] it was in December.
[1:17:30] Brother Tim and Brother Timothy
[1:17:32] and I was at brother Danny's Demons and
[1:17:36] we're staying in a in a in a house
[1:17:40] and in the house we were there and I had
[1:17:43] my own bedroom and and and I was staying
[1:17:46] there and I had a vision
[1:17:49] and I saw in this vision that I was
[1:17:51] going through a a horrible horrible time
[1:17:54] and and I began to drop in this pit and
[1:17:57] I can't describe the pit but it was like
[1:17:59] a coal mining pit was no light, no light
[1:18:04] in there and it was just total darkness
[1:18:06] and and I I saw I saw two men their
[1:18:09] lives destroyed and and they would die
[1:18:13] and and I I just kept crawling down in
[1:18:15] this pit and this road and kept going
[1:18:17] and I I just can't describe how bad it
[1:18:20] was.
[1:18:22] At the bottom of the pit, there was a
[1:18:24] girl standing
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; and she was standing in a beam of light.
[1:18:32] That girl had
[1:18:36] I'm not going to go into it, but that
[1:18:37] girl had stepped away from God and her
[1:18:40] life looked like it was spiraling into
[1:18:43] utter darkness.
[1:18:46] And when I got to the bottom of that
[1:18:48] pit,
[1:18:51] I said, "Sissy,
[1:18:53] are you ready to go home?"
[1:18:57] She put her arm in my arm and she said,
[1:18:59] "Uncle Ron, I'm ready to go home."
[1:19:04] We led her out of there.
[1:19:08] Went home and I told her parents
[1:19:12] she's going to come home.
[1:19:14] I told others, I said, ' Don't don't
[1:19:16] throw a rock at her.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Don't you dare throw a rock at her.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Don't
[1:19:24] Don't say nothing bad about her. She's a
[1:19:26] daughter of God.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; She's just lost her way.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Listen, it kept looking more impossible
[1:19:35] and more impossible and more impossible.
[1:19:37] Let me show you the the impossibility
[1:19:40] today. would you and brother Tom
[1:19:43] stand up today?
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; From a horrible pit. Her dream was to
[1:20:02] come to this meeting.
[1:20:05] to come to this meeting and sit with you
[1:20:07] guys in this church cuz God has turned
[1:20:10] her life around completely.
[1:20:23] I wrote this note a week ago.
[1:20:29] The author of your book
[1:20:33] has the pen in his hand.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; You just let him write it as you live.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; He's got big plans in your life.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand.
[1:21:00] Only God can make this stuff up.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "If God made a
[1:21:05] promise
[1:21:06] and God gave a promise and you believe
[1:21:09] it, I don't care what takes place, it's
[1:21:13] yours.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Fight the devil on every ounce of ground
[1:21:19] that he stands on. Walk over and take
[1:21:22] it. Take the sword of the word. God's
[1:21:25] promises are true and nothing can stop
[1:21:29] them.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; God's promises are true and nothing can
[1:21:35] stop them. They're God's promises. He
[1:21:38] gives the pro gives us the promise of
[1:21:40] just what he said like he did the
[1:21:43] children of Israel. The Pentecostal
[1:21:45] church has come to their tus darbia and
[1:21:48] are we able? Can we do it? Jesus Christ
[1:21:52] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:21:54] forever.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Can we walk up there and take a hold of
[1:21:58] God's promises and say, "It's the truth,
[1:22:01] and I claim it. I own it. It's mine. God
[1:22:05] gave me the promise." Another
[1:22:12] place he said, "God will never give you
[1:22:14] a promise
[1:22:16] until first, unless first there is a
[1:22:19] deposit for it." A good man wouldn't
[1:22:22] give you a check with no money in the
[1:22:24] bank. An honest man wouldn't. Well, God
[1:22:28] wouldn't give you his check for
[1:22:30] salvation or healing unless there's a
[1:22:33] deposit for it.
[1:22:37] God has prepared it. I love that word.
[1:22:40] God has prepared it.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Cancer would have never struck my life
[1:22:48] until God has prepared a healing for it.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; He told Abraham that he was going to
[1:22:58] have a child and that settled it.
[1:23:03] He's told you that you're going to get
[1:23:04] the rapture.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; So now, no matter what's taking place in
[1:23:11] the earth, our government's falling
[1:23:13] apart, Russia's full of nonsense,
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; all of the things that are taking place
[1:23:19] around us, Sodom and Gomorrah is
[1:23:21] everywhere that you see it, God made a
[1:23:23] promise.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ. It's
[1:23:30] not even up for option.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; It's not somebody's idea or some
[1:23:35] concoction of William Brandham. God made
[1:23:38] the promise.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know if the message works. Look
[1:23:43] around.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; I want you to know. Look around.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Look around. The message works.
[1:23:56] If we could just understand the power of
[1:23:58] the word of God and allow it to be
[1:24:01] released maybe even for you this this
[1:24:04] night. God arranged a service like this.
[1:24:07] God's arranged these three thoughts for
[1:24:09] so far for the meeting. So it means that
[1:24:12] God's got plans.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Let's just think about examples that one
[1:24:19] might might help us here.
[1:24:22] We've come, we've spent money to come in
[1:24:25] these meetings. God's made arrangements
[1:24:27] of who would speak and and when they
[1:24:30] would speak, even who sings, the
[1:24:33] musicians that are here. I wish I could
[1:24:35] play a play a horn like that guy.
[1:24:41] Maybe I'm a little vain, but I Hey,
[1:24:43] listen. I quit preaching if I can blow a
[1:24:44] horn like that.
[1:24:49] But since we're here, we don't want to
[1:24:51] miss out on our opportunity.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would stop and say,
[1:24:56] "Don't miss it."
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. You sitting there, then
[1:25:00] go over to a couple people and then come
[1:25:02] back to him say, "Now, don't miss it."
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to I'm just going to say
[1:25:06] this to you. You've come to the meeting.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; God knew where you were going to sit. He
[1:25:13] knew what color outfit that you would
[1:25:15] have on.
[1:25:17] I want you to understand, don't miss the
[1:25:20] opportunity that you're sitting in even
[1:25:23] right now.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; A moment can be short or can be long.
[1:25:36] God God's not so worried about time.
[1:25:39] Well, give me an example, brother.
[1:25:41] Joshua said, "Son,
[1:25:45] stand still."
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Moses said, "Let my people go."
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you abide in me and my
[1:25:58] words abide in you, ask what you will
[1:26:03] and it shall be done unto you."
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "I and my father are one. When
[1:26:09] you've seen me, you've seen the father.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Whom do men say that I, the son of man,
[1:26:16] am?
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; One man spoke up. Peter spoke up and
[1:26:21] said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of
[1:26:24] the living God."
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed that
[1:26:28] unto you, but my father which is in
[1:26:31] heaven.
[1:26:37] There's a man named Finey.
[1:26:41] Finey was a lawyer.
[1:26:45] He was a lawyer. This might be good for
[1:26:47] our young people sitting here. Finey was
[1:26:49] a lawyer.
[1:26:52] God be to deal with his heart, but he
[1:26:55] knew he needed the Holy Ghost in his
[1:26:57] life. He needed the living presence of
[1:26:58] God.
[1:27:00] And one day he was outside of the office
[1:27:03] and he was down behind some bushes
[1:27:07] and he was praying out to God,
[1:27:10] "God, fill me with the Holy Ghost. I
[1:27:13] need you to live in my life. I need to
[1:27:16] be powerful." And two women walked past.
[1:27:21] And he was ashamed that he was caught in
[1:27:23] that condition. So he jumped up and he
[1:27:25] realized
[1:27:27] he was ashamed in front of people.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And then when he went back down on his
[1:27:34] knees, he asked God to forgive him of
[1:27:39] his being embarrassed.
[1:27:41] Forgive him of what other people would
[1:27:43] think.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; We need to be so changed it doesn't
[1:27:50] matter what other people think.
[1:27:53] It doesn't matter if we embarrass
[1:27:55] oursel.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; If we got to go to a hole pin, let's go.
[1:28:00] I got to have Jesus.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just got to pray through
[1:28:06] until he comes down.
[1:28:09] How long, brother Ron? Listen, let me
[1:28:11] just say this to you. Some comes quick,
[1:28:13] some takes a long time. Let me just say,
[1:28:15] keep praying.
[1:28:18] Not just today, tomorrow, months maybe,
[1:28:21] that he will come.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; John Wesley was quite a man,
[1:28:30] brother Joe, for you. 5 foot one
[1:28:36] for me, redheaded,
[1:28:39] once will be again.
[1:28:43] And his speaking was so powerful.
[1:28:47] He was so powerful. He was a man that
[1:28:50] really didn't believe in a lot of
[1:28:51] emotion, but his speaking was so
[1:28:53] powerful until people would get drunk
[1:28:56] while they were hearing him speak. Fall
[1:28:59] out.
[1:29:02] 10,000 people was slain in the spirit in
[1:29:05] a field.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; And he was, you know, he thought he had
[1:29:10] so much to say until he wanted him. He
[1:29:12] went out and tried to get them to set
[1:29:14] up. This is important. You need to hear
[1:29:16] it. But they were so inspired under the
[1:29:19] Holy Ghost, they were slain in the
[1:29:22] spirit.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a moment that that must have
[1:29:27] been like. Yes.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Patrick Henry came by a preacher in our
[1:29:37] area.
[1:29:38] And this preacher was against the the
[1:29:41] Orthodox church. And they were putting
[1:29:44] him out and they had now put him in
[1:29:46] jail. And he was standing in stocks to
[1:29:48] where he would die hours later. And this
[1:29:52] man was screaming his last sermon, "Give
[1:29:55] me liberty or give me death.
[1:29:58] And Patrick Henry was on a horse and he
[1:30:00] was riding to where his voters or his
[1:30:03] constituents were
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; and he heard that man preach his last
[1:30:07] sermon and in that moment it changed
[1:30:11] Patrick Henry's life. Of course we know
[1:30:13] the rest of the story but had it not
[1:30:15] been for that preacher.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; But that shouldn't be a couple of
[1:30:22] hundred years ago. Let me just say you
[1:30:24] need to be inspired in the moment. Give
[1:30:27] me life.
[1:30:30] Give me life. God, I'm sitting in this
[1:30:33] service. I need the life and the
[1:30:36] inspiration of Almighty God in my life.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about what happened
[1:30:42] decades ago. I'm talking about what
[1:30:44] happened right now.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; This meeting is more than about seeing
[1:30:49] one another or hearing great preaching.
[1:30:52] We need a rekindling of the fire in our
[1:30:55] lives.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; We want a living God.
[1:31:02] A living God. A living God. A living
[1:31:07] God.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say it with me? I want a living
[1:31:12] God in my life.
[1:31:17] Our
[1:31:27] nation was shattered.
[1:31:30] War had taken place.
[1:31:39] Gettysburg had happened
[1:31:44] and they were going to have a ceremony,
[1:31:47] a memorial.
[1:31:50] They were going to have a couple
[1:31:51] different speakers to stand.
[1:31:55] Somebody had to have God in their life
[1:31:58] for the moment. I'm talking about for
[1:32:01] the moment.
[1:32:04] Charles Spurgeon had sent a letter from
[1:32:08] Europe to Abraham Lincoln
[1:32:12] and he said the only way to settle a war
[1:32:15] is God.
[1:32:18] With those things in his mind, he went
[1:32:21] to the Gettysburg
[1:32:23] and he sat there for two hours
[1:32:27] as a man named Edward Edbert
[1:32:31] spoke.
[1:32:34] For two hours,
[1:32:37] if I hadn't have told you his name, you
[1:32:39] wouldn't know it right now.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Everybody forgot who it was
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; that spoke. Two hours
[1:32:49] But the next speaker was a tall, slender
[1:32:53] man
[1:32:55] that now had the weight of a nation that
[1:32:58] was split apart.
[1:33:03] And he stood up and he spoke two
[1:33:06] minutes.
[1:33:09] Two minutes.
[1:33:12] And those two minutes
[1:33:14] changed this nation.
[1:33:19] I've done spoke way more than two
[1:33:21] minutes,
[1:33:23] but I pray that this service change your
[1:33:26] life.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Winston Churchill was standing when our
[1:33:32] nation was at war.
[1:33:35] Europe looked like it was going to be
[1:33:37] trounced.
[1:33:39] And he stood up and they had said it was
[1:33:41] the greatest ortor in the entire world.
[1:33:46] And after making all kind of applause
[1:33:48] about how great this orator was, he
[1:33:51] stood to the feet
[1:33:53] and before all the cadetses and
[1:33:55] soldiers,
[1:33:56] he screamed these words, "Never give
[1:34:00] up."
[1:34:03] He took a minute and he screamed it
[1:34:05] again, "Never give up."
[1:34:12] And then one more time he screamed it in
[1:34:14] the audience. Never give up.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, we've heard you tell that
[1:34:20] story before. Well, let me just say it
[1:34:22] again to you.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again to you. There's a
[1:34:32] lot of powers that want you to give up.
[1:34:35] There's powers of darkness trying to
[1:34:37] press you from your position
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; because you've got more authority than
[1:34:43] every devil in hell
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; and he would like to press you out of
[1:34:48] your position. But I want to say this to
[1:34:51] you, regardless of your storm or
[1:34:54] regardless of your trial, never.
[1:35:01] I've sat in many doctor's offices and
[1:35:04] they would look at me and say,
[1:35:07] "Have you come to the point to where
[1:35:09] you're ready to give up?"
[1:35:12] And I can see the blood ball in Sister
[1:35:15] Conniey's face.
[1:35:18] And I say these words that Winston
[1:35:20] Churchill said, "I'll never give up.
[1:35:36] Now, let me just say many people can
[1:35:38] quote these great words when there's no
[1:35:41] storm.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; And a lot of people say, "Well, you
[1:35:45] know, I would do this or I would do
[1:35:47] that."
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of Monday morning
[1:35:50] quarterbacks in life.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; They're not in the storm,
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; but they got an opinion.
[1:35:57] I'm always interested people that have
[1:35:59] an opinion's never done anything.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. A lot of people that
[1:36:06] have an opinion about your life.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; There are a lot that they want to tell
[1:36:12] you about this and that and this and
[1:36:14] that and well, brother Ron, I don't know
[1:36:16] what you're talking about. There's a lot
[1:36:17] of couples that say, "I'll never let my
[1:36:20] child act like that."
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; When they don't have any children,
[1:36:29] But their children have become brats.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's a lot of grandmas
[1:36:43] and granddads sitting here. That's
[1:36:44] right. If I ever heard thus sayeth the
[1:36:47] Lord. That's right. Right there.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham told us nobody can take
[1:36:54] your place. That's right.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Nobody can take your place. You're a
[1:37:02] special individual. Your fingerprints
[1:37:03] are special. Your eyes are special. Your
[1:37:05] hair, your build is special.
[1:37:09] The reason is God pre-planned you.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; He had this one to marry this one and
[1:37:15] this one to marry this one and this one
[1:37:16] to marry since Adam.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; And then you say, "God hasn't done
[1:37:21] nothing for He did a whole lot for you
[1:37:23] before you ever got here.
[1:37:28] We wouldn't have known this without a
[1:37:30] prophet, but when you were born, you
[1:37:31] were one out of a million.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Now, you take that one out of a million
[1:37:37] through all those generations all the
[1:37:39] way back to Adam.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you can even calculate
[1:37:43] that, but I want you to understand, look
[1:37:45] at all of that calculation, and he still
[1:37:48] got you here.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; And if he can get you here, he can get
[1:37:53] you there.
[1:38:04] Now maybe you've come to this service
[1:38:06] tonight like that little woman came. She
[1:38:09] had been at a spot where 12 years
[1:38:12] 12 years that she had been she had been
[1:38:16] uh battling with this condition. She had
[1:38:19] went to all kind of doctors. She'd went
[1:38:21] to all kind of situations in life. She
[1:38:24] had done a lot of different things
[1:38:28] and she had give it all.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; She was now expended all of her
[1:38:34] insurance. She expended all of her all
[1:38:36] of her help and all of her neighbors
[1:38:38] help. And let me just say the condition
[1:38:40] that she was in. She couldn't go to
[1:38:43] church. She couldn't hug her neighbors.
[1:38:46] She couldn't be with her family.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; They all believed that she was cursed.
[1:38:52] She couldn't go to worship
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; and she constantly had this on her mind.
[1:38:57] She You talking about battle of the
[1:38:58] mind.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Will I ever be whole again? Will I ever
[1:39:04] live a normal life? Am I preaching to
[1:39:07] somebody?
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; When you've expended all
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; and your storm won't give up.
[1:39:21] She didn't want to contaminate nobody
[1:39:23] else. Given all of her money, nobody
[1:39:27] wants to be around her. They all said
[1:39:29] she'd cursed.
[1:39:31] Rumors. Rumors were all around her. You
[1:39:34] got to imagine the rumors that was
[1:39:35] there.
[1:39:38] But she believed
[1:39:40] if I can get to Jesus.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:47] It doesn't matter about your neighbors
[1:39:48] at this service.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter who's sitting here.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; That's the situation you've got to be
[1:40:01] in. I'm not here for somebody else.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Don't blame nobody else for the service.
[1:40:09] Don't blame Brother Tim. Don't bring the
[1:40:11] deacons.
[1:40:13] Don't blame who you're sitting around.
[1:40:15] You've come to see Jesus.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Then don't let nobody get in your way.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; She heard that Jesus was coming by. No
[1:40:24] doubt she'd heard miracle after miracle
[1:40:26] after miracle after miracle after
[1:40:28] miracle. Today she decided, "Today's my
[1:40:30] moment.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; If I'm ever going to have an
[1:40:33] opportunity, I cannot miss this.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; I cannot miss it." Let me just say when
[1:40:41] opportunity comes, you've got to take
[1:40:42] advantage of it.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; We won't be here Tuesday night. So, you
[1:40:48] got to get ready.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Tonight's your moment.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Don't let this meeting go by and you
[1:40:54] miss.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; No doubt as she begins to come toward
[1:41:02] the crowd, people tried to discourage
[1:41:04] her from going. She wasn't there for
[1:41:06] them.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Maybe she was like the
[1:41:08] lady in Mexico carrying a dead body.
[1:41:11] Listen, you can have 300 deacons and
[1:41:13] you're not going to stop me.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; My baby's been dead all day, all night.
[1:41:18] But I if I can get him to the prophet of
[1:41:21] God,
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; I saw all those miracles. If I can get
[1:41:25] my baby to the prophet of God, don't try
[1:41:28] to stop me. Don't get in my way. I'm not
[1:41:31] leaving this service with a dead baby.
[1:41:43] She took her opportunity.
[1:41:46] She pressed her way. She didn't need a
[1:41:48] private interview.
[1:41:51] She didn't need her name called.
[1:41:54] She didn't need him to turn and lay her
[1:41:56] his hands on her.
[1:42:00] All her desire was was to touch
[1:42:05] the hymn
[1:42:08] of his garment.
[1:42:11] Brother Ron, you ever heard of anything
[1:42:13] like that?
[1:42:15] We were preaching a meeting in North
[1:42:17] Carolina as a man came to our table
[1:42:20] said, "What are you guys here for?" I
[1:42:22] said, "Well, we were here to for a
[1:42:24] convention
[1:42:26] and what do you do?" And we preached the
[1:42:28] message of William Brandham. He said, "I
[1:42:30] was in his meeting." Older man said, "I
[1:42:33] was in his meeting. and I was eat up
[1:42:34] with cancer.
[1:42:37] And he said, I didn't get a prayer card
[1:42:39] and I couldn't get in line.
[1:42:41] He said, I said, I thought I'd stand
[1:42:44] beside of a pole, the closest pole to
[1:42:46] where Brother Brandham was at.
[1:42:50] And he said, I knew that I wasn't going
[1:42:52] to get get to be prayed for,
[1:42:55] but I wanted to get close and get in his
[1:42:57] atmosphere.
[1:42:59] And he said, "Brother Brandham, step to
[1:43:00] that side of the platform and he
[1:43:03] spinned." And he said, "When he spend,
[1:43:06] his coattail came out." And he said, "I
[1:43:09] just reached and touched his coattail."
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I felt it leaving."
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; For the critics that don't believe the
[1:43:26] message, ought to talk to that guy.
[1:43:35] And this woman was now
[1:43:38] and she felt it dry up immediately.
[1:43:43] She knew.
[1:43:46] She knew. Now Jesus stops the entire
[1:43:50] crowd and he says, "Who touched me?" And
[1:43:53] the disciples quickly say, "Who touched
[1:43:57] you?" Everybody's trying to touch you,
[1:44:00] but this touch,
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; this touch
[1:44:06] took strength away from me, took virtue
[1:44:09] away from me.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; I got to find out who touched me.
[1:44:16] And then she came forward
[1:44:20] and she told him her condition,
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; her situation.
[1:44:27] Now listen,
[1:44:28] he's not found any kind of faith like
[1:44:30] this. But I want you to just notice his
[1:44:33] words. He said, "Thy faith,
[1:44:39] thy faith,
[1:44:43] thy faith hath made thee whole."
[1:44:49] Understand now,
[1:44:52] it's your faith that operates.
[1:44:55] It's your faith that's a situation.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; It's your faith, as brother Tim says,
[1:45:01] has to be put into action.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; You must think about a miracle,
[1:45:12] your miracle that that you're seeking
[1:45:14] for. Maybe there's just a few people
[1:45:16] that are sitting here tonight that that
[1:45:18] need such a miracle, but they know what
[1:45:20] it is to be broken.
[1:45:23] They know what it is for their life to
[1:45:25] be destroyed.
[1:45:26] They didn't ask for this trial in their
[1:45:28] life.
[1:45:30] They didn't ask for things to go upside
[1:45:32] down. But I want to talk to you.
[1:45:36] When a mess takes place in your life,
[1:45:39] it's only the building blocks of
[1:45:41] material to make you well.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Need an example. Joseph had a vision
[1:45:53] and then the trials
[1:45:56] and the tests and the jealousy that he
[1:46:00] would have to endure being sold by his
[1:46:03] brethren,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; being sold into slavery,
[1:46:09] then be lied on and throw into a pit.
[1:46:13] There's no way that you could have asked
[1:46:16] Joseph, Joseph, is this drawing you
[1:46:19] closer to the vision.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Is this Can you explain how this is
[1:46:25] drawing you closer to the vision? But
[1:46:28] all of these steps had to go on
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; to put him in in position
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; to put him in position to get him ready
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; to sit on the throne.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Betrayed by his brothers was stepping
[1:46:47] him to a vision. Being sold into slavery
[1:46:50] was stepping him toward the vision.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; To be lied on was another step into the
[1:46:56] vision.
[1:46:58] to being in a pit in a prison. What's
[1:47:01] getting him closer
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; to the vision?
[1:47:14] five years ago
[1:47:18] when the Lord spoke to me
[1:47:22] and he said these words, "If you will
[1:47:24] trust me, I will use you like never
[1:47:26] before."
[1:47:28] I never would have thought my world was
[1:47:32] about to be spinned
[1:47:35] into stage four cancer.
[1:47:38] I was looking for a greater anointing to
[1:47:40] preach.
[1:47:44] Maybe a channel of healing,
[1:47:47] maybe for God to do a special place
[1:47:49] another gift in my life. I was not
[1:47:52] expecting
[1:47:54] a trial.
[1:47:56] I was not expecting a storm. If I could
[1:47:59] evaluate the storm, this is a hurricane.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; I'm reminded that God's walking in
[1:48:07] storms.
[1:48:08] The disciples were in a ship.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:13] and they looked like they were going to
[1:48:15] die, these men knew how to handle a
[1:48:17] boat.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; But in a storm where it looks like that
[1:48:21] they were about to perish,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; they saw look like a ghost coming to
[1:48:27] them
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; because Jesus walks in storms.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; So in the middle of your storm, if you
[1:48:37] will take notice when it looks like
[1:48:39] you're about to be destroyed,
[1:48:42] When it looks like your world is about
[1:48:44] to be crushed,
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; if you'll just look closely, Jesus is
[1:48:51] walking in your storm.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a big hand.
[1:49:06] Is this mine?
[1:49:08] It is now.
[1:49:14] The very thing that looks like it will
[1:49:16] destroy you
[1:49:18] may be the very thing that God's glory
[1:49:21] is using.
[1:49:22] And God knows that you'll come through.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; You don't know it.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Can I make it through this? Well, God
[1:49:34] knows.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; So why don't we just trust him?
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Trust doctors. Listen, they're
[1:49:40] practicing physicians.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; They're practicing physicians.
[1:49:48] I've taken as much as $36,000 worth of
[1:49:52] chemo in months. In one month, I'm now
[1:49:55] on $18,000 worth of chemo every month.
[1:49:58] Thank God I don't have to pay for it.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; So, God is a provider.
[1:50:07] What was meant for evil?
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; What was meant for evil?
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; When somebody lies on you, don't worry.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; God will make a way for you.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; When somebody tries to destroy you,
[1:50:24] don't get upset. God will make a way
[1:50:27] through it.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Can I just say it again? The pit didn't
[1:50:33] stop the promise.
[1:50:36] Being sold as a slave didn't stop it.
[1:50:38] Having a blood issue for 12 years didn't
[1:50:41] stop it.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Being married to five husbands and
[1:50:44] living with another did not stop the
[1:50:47] predestinated seed of God.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:51:02] probably none of us would have thought
[1:51:03] Paul was a messenger.
[1:51:07] Because Paul was trying to get some of
[1:51:08] us throwed in prison. Then he would hold
[1:51:11] the coat for Stephen
[1:51:14] and he had destroyed some of our
[1:51:15] families.
[1:51:18] He was after us to destroy the message
[1:51:21] while he was the creator of Believe the
[1:51:25] Sign.
[1:51:31] Can you imagine? He's now on a road to
[1:51:34] Damascus
[1:51:35] to destroy some some more of us.
[1:51:39] But today, there's going to be a moment.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're a critic sitting here today
[1:51:46] and you're you're believing all the
[1:51:47] nonsense that the that the world has got
[1:51:50] going on and you're believing this
[1:51:52] situation.
[1:51:53] Let me just say, don't get your
[1:51:55] information from CNN and
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Fox and all of this nonsense of America.
[1:52:02] You get your eyes on Jesus.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; You get your eyes on Jesus. Are you with
[1:52:08] me?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to behave.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I get so tore up about
[1:52:17] Tennessee being champions, sir. I get so
[1:52:20] tore up about this one, and I get so
[1:52:22] tore up about that one. I get so tore up
[1:52:24] about blue hair. I get so tore up about
[1:52:27] this gay business and all of that kind
[1:52:29] of situation.
[1:52:31] The world world's heating up. Well, let
[1:52:33] me just say this to you. The world is
[1:52:34] heating up. It's going to heat up.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; But if you don't believe the message,
[1:52:40] it's going to heat up for you.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I don't believe bombs are
[1:52:47] going to drop. We'll stay here.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; You don't need a prophet. Then you go,
[1:52:54] "No,
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; I may be just talking to one or two, but
[1:53:00] I I'm here
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; now." You see the people that had
[1:53:04] listened to Noah preach for 120 years.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; That had give him all kind of criticism
[1:53:11] and all kind of nonsense. Come here just
[1:53:13] a minute, Bubb.
[1:53:21] You don't have to fix it. I'm just gonna
[1:53:23] let it go. Here it go.
[1:53:33] It's worse than a barking dog.
[1:53:37] Is there something wrong, brother? Well,
[1:53:38] we don't pay attention to that kind of
[1:53:40] thing. No way.
[1:53:44] So you've heard him for 120 years and
[1:53:49] you said science tells us there's no
[1:53:51] rain up there,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; no water up there.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; And it's told us that, you know, he's
[1:53:58] just a he's not even an architect.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; And and that kind of wood won't build a
[1:54:04] good ark.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; He's building it three stories. The
[1:54:10] windows at the top,
[1:54:14] one door. Where is the fire escape plan?
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And he keeps preaching the same message.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; He keeps preaching the same message.
[1:54:32] Maybe a lot of people would come and
[1:54:34] just borderline believers and listen to
[1:54:36] it, make fun of it, talk about him and
[1:54:40] his family. Oh, it's just a family
[1:54:41] thing.
[1:54:46] But I think it's interesting. I don't
[1:54:49] know what those people were thinking
[1:54:51] when all of a sudden
[1:54:55] two by two
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; animals came from all over the world
[1:55:01] without drones.
[1:55:06] You talking about a big God that me and
[1:55:07] you serve
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; without a system of technology.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Just a movement hit them
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; and a gathering begin to happen from all
[1:55:20] over the world to the ark.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; How's the rapture going to happen? Don't
[1:55:25] you try to figure it out. It's going to
[1:55:27] be orchestrated by God.
[1:55:39] Well, brother, I don't know about that.
[1:55:41] If God could get a warthog on a on a
[1:55:44] boat,
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; if he could get a wthog on a or a
[1:55:53] turtle. Are you with me? I'm just going
[1:55:55] to keep on.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; If he could do that,
[1:56:04] A creature that doesn't have a soul, how
[1:56:07] much more can he take care of
[1:56:09] predestinated
[1:56:10] seed of God?
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; It is not you and I that's going to
[1:56:21] produce a rapture. It's going to be in
[1:56:22] us.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; But it's God
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; has gathered us together from all over
[1:56:29] the world.
[1:56:37] Oh, he's going to make us a zoo.
[1:56:41] Going to make us a zoo. Ain't that
[1:56:43] interesting? He's making us a zoo.
[1:56:50] Now
[1:56:52] the door closes.
[1:56:55] Noah didn't close the door. God closed
[1:56:58] the door.
[1:57:01] And it doesn't happen the first day.
[1:57:04] Brother Bham said they would have to
[1:57:07] sweat it out.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Didn't happen today. It didn't happen
[1:57:11] tomorrow. It's going to happen.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; When's going to happen, Brother Ron?
[1:57:15] When's the rapture? When's the
[1:57:16] resurrection going to happen? When's all
[1:57:18] these things going to happen? Just wait.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Just keep walking.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Can I talk to you now, Brother Ron? I'm
[1:57:27] so miserable in this world. Why?
[1:57:30] Why? The token ought to be applied to
[1:57:33] your home.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; The joy of God ought to be in your life.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; When you come to church, it's not a
[1:57:41] miserable time. You're ready for the
[1:57:43] house of God. Preach to me. This is what
[1:57:45] I live on.
[1:57:50] Come on, church.
[1:57:52] Preach to me a half an hour. Preach me
[1:57:54] three hours. It don't matter. I'm ready
[1:57:56] for the word of God. I'm thirsty. I'm
[1:57:58] hungry. That's what feeds my soul,
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron. We've heard it all. You
[1:58:08] better listen again.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; You better listen it again. Are you with
[1:58:12] me? That's why God has us to repeat
[1:58:14] sermons.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't get it the first time.
[1:58:17] That's why you've got to listen to
[1:58:18] things that are to be over and over
[1:58:20] again. Spoken word is original seed. You
[1:58:22] got to listen to it over and over again
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; cuz you're walking in different stages
[1:58:27] of your life and maturing as you going
[1:58:29] along. You're going to catch more and
[1:58:31] more and more.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; That's why Wednesday night service is so
[1:58:36] important. That's why Sunday morning
[1:58:38] service is so important.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; That's why it's important for you to
[1:58:42] have the right attitude.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; I've only got one service.
[1:58:52] Now, the scripture says, and this is my
[1:58:54] favorite scripture.
[1:58:56] And we know that all things
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; work together for the good to them that
[1:59:01] love God.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; When it's talking about all things, it
[1:59:05] doesn't specifically stop, Brother Tim.
[1:59:07] It doesn't stop and say, "Except for
[1:59:09] that storm,
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; except for that season in your life."
[1:59:15] It says that when we know all things
[1:59:17] work together for the good to them that
[1:59:19] love God to them who are the called
[1:59:22] according to his purpose.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; For whom he did for know he also did
[1:59:27] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:59:29] image of God of his son that he might be
[1:59:31] the firstborn of many brethren.
[1:59:33] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them
[1:59:35] he also called it. And whom he called
[1:59:36] them he also justified it. Whom he
[1:59:38] justified them he also glorified.
[1:59:42] And what shall we then say to these
[1:59:44] things? If God be before us,
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; I want to say there, let's read this
[1:59:49] together. What shall we then say to
[1:59:51] these things? If God be before us,
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; who can be against us?
[2:00:02] [Applause]
[2:00:14] This is in my notes, so I'll go ahead
[2:00:15] and say it. It's not your reputation
[2:00:18] that's on the line.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; It's not your reputation that's on the
[2:00:25] mine.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Let me give you an example. It's God's
[2:00:29] reputation.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; 42inch caribou.
[2:00:34] That's right.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Silver tip grizzly bear.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Three squirrels,
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; seven seals,
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; all of them opened,
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; seven thunders. Are you with me now? An
[2:00:45] open book in your hand.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; God did all of that.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; I don't see a bear nowhere. It's God's
[2:00:56] reputation on the line.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; How long are those horns? There'll be a
[2:01:00] 42 in green checkered shirt.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; I've never been in a vision, brother
[2:01:10] Ron. Let me just say all of us are in a
[2:01:12] vision.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; We all are in a vision.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; And it's not somebody else's vision.
[2:01:21] It's God's vision.
[2:01:28] I want to ask you, do you have any idea
[2:01:29] how big God is,
[2:01:36] Brother Ron? I'm in a trial. Ain't
[2:01:37] nothing's going to fix it. Really?
[2:01:41] Really?
[2:01:43] The God that said, "Let there be," and
[2:01:45] believed his own word, and the sun came
[2:01:48] into existence.
[2:01:51] The God that created the heavens and all
[2:01:54] the stars
[2:01:57] and aligned them up and they orbit a
[2:02:00] certain way
[2:02:03] and it's all in a perfect order.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; The God that created your hand.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; The God that created your eyes.
[2:02:16] The God that knew where you would be
[2:02:18] born. So he put your potassium and the
[2:02:22] pot ash
[2:02:25] so your natural body can be taken out of
[2:02:28] the earth.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; The God that knew how tall you'd be,
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; how fluffy you would be,
[2:02:36] how athletic you would be. He knew even
[2:02:40] your characteristics.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Why don't you quit wrestling with
[2:02:45] yourself a little bit?
[2:02:48] We're looking in the mirror and say,
[2:02:49] "I'm a nobody." You're God's somebody.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; So when you pray,
[2:03:01] how do I pray, Brother Ron? It's like
[2:03:03] talking to the best friend that you got.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; It's not mental transfusion to where
[2:03:10] that you you send your thoughts to God.
[2:03:13] You got to pray.
[2:03:21] Pray is when you lift your voice before
[2:03:24] God and he knows your voice and you lift
[2:03:28] your your decree before God and your
[2:03:31] need before God. A God that hears every
[2:03:34] prayer.
[2:03:38] But I'll tell you our problem. And
[2:03:39] here's why I'm here. So many times we
[2:03:42] look for things to be answered and we
[2:03:45] haven't prayed them yet.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Now God's the prophets told us that
[2:03:54] God's crowning achievement is you.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; So he pre-planned you. He orchestrated
[2:04:00] your life. But he also just didn't leave
[2:04:03] you here to go through storms unarmed.
[2:04:07] The prophet will tell us about the
[2:04:09] military and they'll arm them a certain
[2:04:11] way. They're going into battle. So,
[2:04:13] they're going to need the best weaponry
[2:04:15] that they can get. Now, God doesn't
[2:04:17] evolve and give better weapons as we go
[2:04:20] along. Every hundred years, God changes
[2:04:22] the weaponry.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; He gave us his word.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; And when your word, the word of God goes
[2:04:32] across your lips,
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; moms and dads claim your children. Yes,
[2:04:36] sir.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Put them in the hands of Jesus. Are you
[2:04:40] with me now?
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; We can believe these signs shall follow
[2:04:46] them that believe and say that's just
[2:04:47] for the ministry, but it's for you.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; How powerful prayer is. Prayer changes
[2:04:55] things. Prayer is the most powerful
[2:04:57] weapon that was ever put in the control
[2:04:59] of human beings. There is no atomic
[2:05:01] bomb.
[2:05:03] Hydrogen bomb is powerful as prayer.
[2:05:05] Prayer will change even the mind of God.
[2:05:07] That's powerful.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Brother man says, "And the church has
[2:05:12] the authority from Jesus Christ. In my
[2:05:14] name shall they cast out devils and
[2:05:16] speak with new tongues. And if they take
[2:05:18] up serpents or drink any deadly things,
[2:05:20] it will not hurt them."
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; They'll lay hands on the sickened, they
[2:05:25] shall recover.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Let me just drop this note here. The
[2:05:31] word of God is superior to your
[2:05:33] feelings.
[2:05:36] Where'd you get that right there?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; He said it and I believe it.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; It's not based on your feelings.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; I didn't feel nothing. Don't mean
[2:05:48] anything.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; The scripture says in Philippians
[2:05:56] chapter won't be much longer. I can do
[2:05:58] all things
[2:06:00] through Christ which strengthen me. Yes,
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; he giveth power to the faint and to them
[2:06:05] that have no might. He increasth
[2:06:08] strength. Paul said this, "Therefore, I
[2:06:11] take I take pleasure in infirmities and
[2:06:13] reproaches and necessities in pers in
[2:06:15] persecutions and distresses for Christ's
[2:06:18] sake. For when I am weak,
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; then I am strong."
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; So, it's not based on your feelings. For
[2:06:27] God hath not given us the spirit of
[2:06:29] fear.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; But of power and of love and of a sound
[2:06:34] mind.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Psalms 18:12, "I will love thee, oh
[2:06:39] Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock
[2:06:41] and my fortress and my deliverer, my
[2:06:44] God, my strength, in whom I will trust,
[2:06:46] my buckler and the and the horn of my
[2:06:48] salvation and my high tower."
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; First John chapter 4 and verse four. Ye
[2:06:54] are of God.
[2:06:57] Ye are of God. That's your origin.
[2:06:58] That's where you came from. We came from
[2:07:00] God. We're going back to God. Ye are of
[2:07:02] God, little children, and have overcome
[2:07:04] them because greater is he.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; You got to need greater is he.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; He's greater than your financial
[2:07:20] trouble. He's greater than your children
[2:07:22] going out in the world. He knows how far
[2:07:24] they'll go.
[2:07:33] Andrew's got a dog.
[2:07:38] That dog is a wiry dog.
[2:07:42] He's a dirty looking dog.
[2:07:48] I've got cats.
[2:07:50] That dog hates my cats.
[2:07:53] I got a dog and that dog's named
[2:07:55] Dorothy. Dorothy's a house dog.
[2:07:59] Dorothy knows where she lives.
[2:08:02] That dog don't know where he lives.
[2:08:11] That dog.
[2:08:16] Now, what happened? Andrew had a
[2:08:21] had a a collar on that dog that would
[2:08:23] buzz every time he got close to the to
[2:08:25] where his boundary was.
[2:08:28] And that dog had too much energy to be
[2:08:30] placed in a little bitty pin,
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; probably acre pin.
[2:08:36] And so he would get bored and he would
[2:08:38] eat lights,
[2:08:42] rubber off of bicycles.
[2:08:46] He would tear flowers out of the ground.
[2:08:50] He would make a mess. He'd go off to
[2:08:52] preach somewhere and I would give him
[2:08:54] report, detailed report. He ate the
[2:08:57] gutter off of your house.
[2:09:11] I did not like that dog.
[2:09:16] You know what? What happened one day? He
[2:09:19] took the collar off.
[2:09:22] Now that dog now thinks I'm his owner.
[2:09:29] I get on my farm buggy. That dog's
[2:09:31] sitting in my lap.
[2:09:34] We go to get mail, he's sitting right in
[2:09:36] my lap.
[2:09:39] I go to haul things over to Whitney's
[2:09:41] house, that dog's right there.
[2:09:43] The collar's off.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Now, when the collar was off, I found
[2:09:49] out how much I like that dog.
[2:09:53] When Brother Tim stayed a week with me,
[2:09:55] he and I walked every day. That dog
[2:09:58] walked right with us step for step. Of
[2:10:00] course, it went a lot of different
[2:10:02] places that brother Tim and I didn't go,
[2:10:03] but he was right there with us.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; That dog don't think he owns it no more,
[2:10:11] but I make sure, Sister Connie, don't
[2:10:13] we? We make sure that dog gets fed.
[2:10:20] Now, I don't mean to cont to to to
[2:10:22] equate you to a dog, but some of you
[2:10:25] have got a collar on you
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; and you're bored and you're chewing
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; the gutter off your house.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; And God knows if you can ever break
[2:10:41] through.
[2:10:58] Come on, church. If you can ever break
[2:11:01] through,
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; if you can ever have a breakthrough in
[2:11:06] your life,
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; and you're not sitting there bound by
[2:11:10] what somebody else thinks
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; and after a while, start praising God
[2:11:16] for yourself.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Stop worshiping God for yourself.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad your storm is. The
[2:11:26] way to to get out of your storm is
[2:11:28] praise.
[2:11:30] Praise.
[2:11:32] Worship.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Can I go? Can I have just a couple more
[2:11:45] minutes?
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; It must baffle the devil.
[2:11:52] It must blame. It must blow his mind.
[2:11:58] How do the worst girl in the community
[2:12:02] can walk in this church
[2:12:06] and in a service?
[2:12:09] Walk from a harlot
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; to a princess.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; From a drunk
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; to a prince.
[2:12:22] That's right.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; From a dope addict to an addict of God.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I just got to
[2:12:32] have a fix." We need more than a fix. We
[2:12:35] need a transformation with God.
[2:12:49] This might be for somebody.
[2:12:52] The night I got saved,
[2:12:55] the night I walked to an altar, let me
[2:12:56] put it like that.
[2:12:59] I had a 12-pack in my car
[2:13:03] cuz I was planning to go to a party,
[2:13:07] but I went to a pre-party.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; I listened to a guy that I thought
[2:13:14] preached too long
[2:13:17] because it was getting into my business.
[2:13:21] Now, I had been raised in the message
[2:13:24] and I knew the quotes and I could tell
[2:13:26] the stories.
[2:13:29] But tonight, I realized this service was
[2:13:31] for me.
[2:13:37] I found myself at the altar.
[2:13:40] I found myself at the altar. And let me
[2:13:43] just say, if you get in his presence, it
[2:13:46] don't take five hours.
[2:13:50] I got up from that altar. I walked out
[2:13:52] to my car. I drove. The church was a
[2:13:54] near a filling station, the gas station.
[2:13:57] I went across the street and there was a
[2:13:59] trash can sitting there and I took that
[2:14:02] 12-pack and I put it right in that trash
[2:14:04] can to today.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; I've never had another desire for one of
[2:14:11] them.
[2:14:24] I've watched prostitutes come to the
[2:14:25] Lord.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Drug addicts come to the Lord.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Murderers come to the Lord.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, God knows the depths of the pit.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; He knows the depths of the pit. He knows
[2:14:39] where you're at.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; God knows how to find you.
[2:14:45] Brother Ron, I don't know how I can
[2:14:47] change. It's not up to you.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; All God needs is a willing vessel to
[2:14:53] say, "I surrender."
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Give me a biblical answer. Paul,
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Peter,
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; the woman at the well,
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; God knows how to come and get us.
[2:15:12] He knows how to set us on fire to turn
[2:15:14] our world upside down.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I don't know if I can
[2:15:21] understand the word. Let me just say
[2:15:22] this. You just keep getting washed by
[2:15:24] it.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; You just keep coming to church. Are you
[2:15:27] with me, brother? I don't understand it.
[2:15:29] Keep getting to just keep coming and
[2:15:31] listening.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; And the word of God will open itself up
[2:15:35] to you.
[2:15:47] Brother Ron,
[2:15:54] I'm in a storm.
[2:15:58] They say it's an F5
[2:16:02] and they say I'm not going to make it.
[2:16:10] My house is going to be washed away. My
[2:16:12] house is going to be blew away.
[2:16:17] I may go to prison. I may do all these
[2:16:20] things in my life.
[2:16:22] I don't care how bad a storm is, there's
[2:16:24] always a rainbow.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Isaiah,
[2:16:32] I told your daddy, don't give up on him.
[2:16:39] The odds looked almost impossible.
[2:16:46] I was with brother Tim the other day and
[2:16:48] we was sitting
[2:16:52] on a great big deck
[2:16:57] and this is what happened.
[2:17:00] Your father said, "Brother Ron, I've
[2:17:04] been trying for five years to try to ask
[2:17:06] you a question." And he said, "Every
[2:17:07] time I get close to you, I ask you a
[2:17:09] question." He said,
[2:17:13] "I just can't get my question asked.
[2:17:16] We're on the top of the parkway.
[2:17:20] We're overlooking the Shannondoa Valley.
[2:17:27] We're standing there and he said,
[2:17:28] "Brother Ron, this is a good place. This
[2:17:30] is a good place for me to ask you a
[2:17:32] question." I said, "Okay."
[2:17:34] I said, "Brother G, let's sit down just
[2:17:37] for a moment."
[2:17:43] We sat on some tall chairs.
[2:17:46] I won't forget it because I had to jump
[2:17:47] up on it.
[2:17:53] And he had just been talking about you.
[2:17:57] It was his dream to see you in church.
[2:17:59] It's his dream to see you doing good. It
[2:18:02] was his dream. He had a token with God.
[2:18:07] Are you with me? I'm sorry to point you
[2:18:08] out, but this is a good deal.
[2:18:11] He said, "Can I ask you the question
[2:18:13] now?" I said, "No, I'm going to tell you
[2:18:14] your question."
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; And I told him the question he'd been
[2:18:19] wanting to give me for five years.
[2:18:22] And I said, "Brother Gito,
[2:18:25] God forgave you of that a long time
[2:18:27] ago."
[2:18:31] And the friend that you was with, so you
[2:18:33] know that I know cuz God showed it to
[2:18:36] me. Your friend was named Eddie.
[2:18:39] And he just throwed his hands back.
[2:18:41] Sister Connie, you remember that. He
[2:18:43] screamed
[2:18:45] and all those tourists on that on that
[2:18:47] balcony looked over said, "What is going
[2:18:49] on?" Listen, that Belgium man could
[2:18:51] scream.
[2:18:55] And I told him, I said, "Brother Ger,
[2:18:58] don't you worry about Isaiah.
[2:19:00] You put a token over his life.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; And I don't care how far he's gone. Are
[2:19:05] you with me?
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; I don't care about the situation that's
[2:19:09] going on. God's made us a promise.
[2:19:24] Your storm may seem bad, but God made
[2:19:28] the promise.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Not a man made the promise.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Not some fickle man that'll change his
[2:19:34] mind, but God made the promise.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; What about your life?
[2:19:42] I pointed out three different people
[2:19:44] here tonight out of the mouth of two or
[2:19:46] three witnesses.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; These stories are real.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; No need me telling your story.
[2:19:56] These stories are real to me.
[2:19:59] Brother Ron, you shouldn't tell those
[2:20:00] stories. Well, your pastor preached on
[2:20:02] Sunday
[2:20:05] that we've got to keep these stories
[2:20:06] alive. That's right.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; So, what he preached about, I'm standing
[2:20:11] here to tell you
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; our God's alive.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; And if you're wanting the Holy Ghost,
[2:20:19] he's here for you.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; He made the promise for you.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; If you haven't given your heart to God,
[2:20:26] he's here for you.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; If you got children that need to come
[2:20:30] in, he's here for you.
[2:20:35] But you have to have faith to believe.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Sister Melissa,
[2:20:46] remember at 17 hours that couple five
[2:20:49] years ago that I said I preached a
[2:20:51] sermon named I must get to Jesus
[2:20:58] because I was getting weaker every day.
[2:21:01] I knew that if I continued to get
[2:21:03] weaker, I wasn't going to have the
[2:21:05] strength to be able to fight cancer.
[2:21:09] And I preached I preached my sermon on I
[2:21:13] must get to Jesus. I'm like Jarius.
[2:21:18] I need more than church.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; I got to get to Jesus.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; When I walked out of that pull pit, I
[2:21:26] came to my own bed and Sister Connie, I
[2:21:28] said, "Where is 17 hours?" Well, we've
[2:21:31] drove it enough times to know this place
[2:21:33] is 17 hours.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; And during the night, God dealt with me.
[2:21:38] You got to get
[2:21:46] We're buddies,
[2:21:48] but you represent more than a preacher.
[2:21:52] Listen, if you want to die, don't get to
[2:21:54] him.
[2:21:56] Don't ask him to come pray for you
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; cuz he's not going to commit you to the
[2:22:01] ground
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; cuz he believes in a God that to heal
[2:22:04] you.
[2:22:05] [Applause]
[2:22:17] They arranged it. Sister Karen was in
[2:22:19] the hospital with a brain bleed. Didn't
[2:22:21] know if she was going to live or die.
[2:22:23] And he made time
[2:22:29] Did I see lightning? Did I feel thunder?
[2:22:31] No.
[2:22:34] But in that prayer service,
[2:22:38] there's two representatives here. In
[2:22:40] that prayer service, three boys got the
[2:22:42] Holy Ghost.
[2:22:45] Luke and Andrew, where you at?
[2:22:50] Luke and Andrew. There you go. Stand up.
[2:22:58] Luke and Andrew
[2:23:00] and a man named Adam, a boy your age,
[2:23:04] got the Holy Ghost. He's now a deacon in
[2:23:06] our church.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; When God does business, he does it
[2:23:13] really well.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; He does it really well.
[2:23:27] I was so sick going home, they had to
[2:23:29] stop over and over and over again for me
[2:23:31] to get home. But when I got home
[2:23:35] and the boys were going to go to work
[2:23:37] tomorrow morning,
[2:23:39] I said, "Wait on me. I'm going to go
[2:23:41] with you."
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; Since that day,
[2:23:47] I've not missed a day of work.
[2:23:52] [Applause]
[2:24:04] Why, brother Ron? I got to Jesus.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; I got to Jesus
[2:24:10] more than a man.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Guys like him and brother Donnie,
[2:24:15] they're my buddies. But more than a man
[2:24:18] lives in there.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; More than a man liv. Go ahead and just
[2:24:23] point at your chest right now. More than
[2:24:25] a man lives in here.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the storms of your
[2:24:31] life are telling to you tonight.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Greater is he
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; that is in you
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world.
[2:24:45] I could spend the next weeks telling you
[2:24:47] the miracles that I have seen.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Weeks telling you the miracles I've
[2:24:54] seen.
[2:24:56] Brother on that's just people you know.
[2:24:58] Okay. Sister Melissa that stood just a
[2:25:01] few moments ago. They called me about
[2:25:04] her cousin
[2:25:06] that was dying. They said she would die
[2:25:07] in a couple hours.
[2:25:10] She was now weighing 85 pounds and she
[2:25:12] was totally green. Drugs had ate her
[2:25:15] body up. When I got to the hospital, her
[2:25:19] husband talked to me about funeral plans
[2:25:21] and I said, "Listen, I have not driven
[2:25:23] an hour to talk to you about funeral
[2:25:24] plans. I'm going to pray for her."
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Her eyes were rolled back in the back of
[2:25:30] her head and I called her by name. And
[2:25:32] that was the first time that she had
[2:25:34] actually looked out of her eyes in days.
[2:25:38] and her eyes rolled up and I told her
[2:25:39] what I was there for. I was going to
[2:25:41] pray for her. And I told her, I said,
[2:25:43] "There's been times that you hated me,
[2:25:45] but I have came here to pray for you and
[2:25:48] God's going to raise you up."
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Listen, doctors were there. They were
[2:25:56] sitting there and they when I got done
[2:25:58] praying for her, I said, "She'll walk
[2:25:59] down the hallway with you tomorrow."
[2:26:02] The doctors, the nurses stopped me and
[2:26:04] said, "Brother Ron, you don't know what
[2:26:05] you're talking." Said, "She's she's
[2:26:07] dying in the next couple of hours." I
[2:26:08] said, "No, no, no. I didn't say it." He
[2:26:10] did.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; She walked down the hallway with her
[2:26:15] husband the next day.
[2:26:28] I want to ask you one more thing. How
[2:26:30] big is your God?
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; How big is your God?
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here needing deliverance
[2:26:41] tonight. I want to ask you, when are you
[2:26:45] going to ask for it?
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; The storm's in your life, when are you
[2:26:51] going to call for the peacekeeper?
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; You got marriage problems, he can help
[2:26:59] you.
[2:27:00] financial troubles, he can help you.
[2:27:04] Your children are away from God, he can
[2:27:06] help you.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Cancer in your body, he can help you.
[2:27:12] You're laying in a hospital right now in
[2:27:13] a hospital bed and the doctors tell
[2:27:15] you're going to die. I want you to
[2:27:17] listen. You say, "Brother Ron, I've
[2:27:18] never seen a miracle.
[2:27:35] Let's stand to our feet just now.
[2:27:46] Brother Brandon would tell us when wood
[2:27:47] lays hands on another a believer to a
[2:27:50] believer said there's a light that's
[2:27:52] transmitted from one hand to another.
[2:28:00] I'm going to ask you to do something. I
[2:28:02] want you to believe.
[2:28:07] I want you to believe.
[2:28:12] I want you to believe.
[2:28:15] It's not about what your neighbor
[2:28:17] thinks. I want you to believe.
[2:28:22] Young men, young ladies, you're wanting
[2:28:24] the Holy Ghost in your life. I want you
[2:28:26] to believe.
[2:28:30] You got a storm going on. It looks so
[2:28:33] horrible.
[2:28:34] I want you to have a vision that Jesus
[2:28:37] is there
[2:28:39] to speak peace to your storm.
[2:28:44] Can he?
[2:28:46] I'm living proof.
[2:28:48] [Music]
[2:28:51] I'm living proof that he can.
[2:28:55] I don't know if this message works. Look
[2:28:57] around.
[2:28:59] Look around. You got questions about the
[2:29:01] message,
[2:29:02] just open your eyes just for a moment
[2:29:05] and look around.
[2:29:07] This message works.
[2:29:10] This message works.
[2:29:12] There's a lot of impossibilities that
[2:29:14] have stood in this building,
[2:29:17] but they've been at peace for decades
[2:29:19] now
[2:29:21] when God changed their life. Brother
[2:29:24] Isaiah, I believe you could say it. This
[2:29:26] message works.
[2:29:30] You gave your heart for brother Timothy
[2:29:32] preaching to you. Something became real.
[2:29:35] It was a moment in your life and you've
[2:29:38] never been the same.
[2:29:42] never been the same. Now, here's what I
[2:29:45] believe. You can walk out of this
[2:29:47] service and never be the same.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Will you believe me?
[2:29:56] Will you believe me?
[2:29:58] Will you believe me?
[2:30:01] Now, I want you to believe. Now, here's
[2:30:03] what I'm going to ask you to do. I want
[2:30:05] you to pray across your lips to where
[2:30:08] even you can hear your prayer.
[2:30:12] And I want you to call out the storm in
[2:30:13] your life and say, "I'm done with this
[2:30:16] storm.
[2:30:17] God, I ask you to help me just now. Ask
[2:30:20] you to help me. Ask you to help me. Lay
[2:30:23] your hands on one another now.
[2:30:30] [Music]

[2:30:54] Hallelujah. Sister Melissa, you got a
[2:30:56] son.

[2:31:11] the name of Jesus,
[2:31:13] every knee shall bow.
[2:31:18] I call on Jesus.
[2:31:22] Father,
[2:31:25] the one that said, "Let there be."
[2:31:28] and believed his own word.
[2:31:32] The Lord, you see the storms of lives
[2:31:35] across this building now.

[2:31:41] lives, situations that look so
[2:31:44] impossible.

[2:31:48] to believe.
[2:31:51] I've got needs in my life, even standing
[2:31:53] here as a minister.

[2:31:58] where doctors can't help. I need you.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[2:32:04] lift your name.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; You see our needs. You're a living God.
[2:32:11] We don't need our name called.
[2:32:14] We don't need us to tell us where we
[2:32:16] live. You've already in this this
[2:32:19] message orchestrated this entire
[2:32:22] service. Now, we ask for action. We ask
[2:32:26] you for the word to live now in our

[3:54:54] I am a friend of God.
[3:54:58] I am a friend of God.
