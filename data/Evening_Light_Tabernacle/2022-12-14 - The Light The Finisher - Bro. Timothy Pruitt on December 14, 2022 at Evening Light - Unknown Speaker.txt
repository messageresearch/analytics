move in the situations of Our Lives we commit this to you Lord every part everything to be said and done For Your Glory we love you father and thank you and [Music] amen amen has turned to Hebrews chapter 12. and verse 1. Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1. it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen just want to remind you of the New Year's meetings that are coming up um be Friday and Saturday and Sunday times and things will be posted and so we're looking forward to that also the Wednesday prior to that the Wednesday right between Christmas and New Year's we will not be having that service but it will be moved to the Friday night so if you can remember that that would be helpful for you amen Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1 we'll definitely be making more announcements in the coming near future we're foreseeing we also are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen we'll let you be seated we spoke last Wednesday on the author like to look tonight at the light the finisher because he's not just the starter or the beginner of us of our story or the beginning of our story he's also the end of our story and uh he's he's quite the finisher he knows how to write a good ending and I'm thankful for that amen the devil may have planned an ending for you but his doesn't matter what matters is what God has planned for you amen you know we can look at him at this finisher and we can see him and even in the beginning of time we can read it in the Book of Genesis of how he created all the different things by the each day day one day two but there's something that he he would uh chapter 2 and verse 1 it says the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the hosts of them and then he would rest from his work and so God is very uh in tune with he's very concerned or he's very his mind is on the finish of things he doesn't leave anything halfway done you know we may do that as human beings a lot of us are real good at beginning things but maybe not too good at ending things or finishing things and and my you know I myself we can be guilty of that you get all enthused and all into something and and that carries you so far and then a lot of times you end up with a lot of uh unended uh or unfinished projects and but God is not that kind of person if he starts something he's going to finish it amen he's going to make sure that it comes to an end a man and and I like how he talks about us in Jeremiah 29 and verse 11. he said for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in so it's not an end that's going to be uh catching him unawares or not an end that's going to surprise him but it's an expected in or a desire to end that God has determined for you in your life now you know we know as we're in this time of life that we are at the end we are at the B not at the beginning of the even at the beginning of the world no doubt but not even at the beginning of the church ages We Know by the prophet of the hour that and the Revelation that's coming this day that we are at the end we're at the closing of time and and you know uh God would plant a church and we know how he planted a seed as a man would plant a garden he plants a seed amen expecting the end to be in Harvest none of us goes out and exp and plants a seed expecting you know not to get anything out of it no we would plant it expecting to get in Harvest or to expect to get a flower or whatever it is that you plant amen you have an expectation that that's what it's going to come and now now only does God have an expectation of it he also knows that his word will not fail and so his amen if he places that word seed of God down there in that ground as he did in the first stage and it come up through the tassels and or or through the stalks under the tassels and and Luther and Wesley and all of that you know one thing about God he does not leave Amen in the middle of his work he doesn't get tired of it as I said he doesn't get uh uh you know worried about it not coming and just give up on it I I'm thankful he don't give up on his work but he's going to fulfill it he's going to finish it amen he's going to be there when the Harvest takes place and you know brother Madam talks about the age that each one lived in well you know he talks about Luther and Wesley said they were the age of reformation not the age of restoration amen he said neither was any age but this last age is the age of restoration it's also the age of complete blackout in apostasy but in this age of apostasy apostasy this is also the age of restoration it is the age of the finished cycle amen the Finish cycle when when this is over it is all over amen we're right at the end if you want to look at it as a race you know we are the last Runners amen you know you put your best at the last amen you put your closure at the last you put your finisher at the last you put the one to run the last as the batons would be passed you would put the one that could run and would have the determination that at the end when the horn sounds I'm going to cross that finish line now it's not so much important in this race that you cross first but it's important that you cross the finish line that's what's important in this race of life you know many have gone on before us many in the last few years have already crossed over and crossed that line but amen it's important that if you're going to win this race is to finish this race you know I got to looking at different races throughout the throughout time and many of them are brought up for the Olympics and and a lot of them are talks about the best last place finishes and and it was very interesting that that in these races that these men would train and they would beat their bodies and they would beat them into subjection and they would eat a certainly diet and they would do a certain way because they were training for a race and this race that they was going to win was not something of a great value that they was going to win it was going to be just a little metal to go around their neck but there was such passion in them to be able to get this so they would do that but in this race many of them would fall down or many of them would have issues and it was different races that one one lady who had run and she had failed and another one had tangled up with her and this one had jumped right up and could could have continued and maybe caught back up with the pack but she decided that it was important for this person that had failed amen that she would encourage her to get up and finish the race and I thought that was really good amen and we're in this race of life and it ain't so much who crosses the Finish Line the first in this race but it's important that the ones that are called to finish finish this race therefore if we see somebody that has fallen that has went down we all ought to encourage them get back up get continue on we're going to finish amen we're going to go to the end of this thing it was another one that is a man that was running a race and then he had a devastating energy injury of his hamstring that had snapped him and he but he was determined you know I didn't realize this until I was reading it but if a medical team comes out and begins to assess you then you're you're automatically disqualified so he pushed him away and he said no I'm going to finish this race and he's limping along and out of the stands comes his father and he comes down he puts his arm around his son and they walk across the Finish Line one of the most famous photos that there is as is of the father and the son and I thought about that as many times as we have fallen in this in the in life and we got damaged and we got hurt amen the father was interested in us finishing the race and he would come down and he would ride himself in our story and he would reach down and pick us up and we would think how did I make it across there how did I make it through there and we would look back and we'd see one set of footprints where the father wrote himself in our story and he picked us up and he carried us through and I'm so thankful to know a father like that amen you know there was another man who would he was running a marathon and he got way back and he got injured of some sort and he was determined and it was some hours since the last Runner had crossed and many I think it was only a few uh just about 14 of the 40 something had quit actually and walked away and he was in with injuries and hurts but he was determined I'm going to cross that finish line I'm going to get to that finish line and it was hours after the last Runner it went and there was just a few people that was in that grandstand and they were watching and and they were cheering as he would come around the corner and he's dragging a leg or whatever he had going on with him but he finished the race and they had the reporters run down to him people were screaming and hollering and making a lot of noise at the last place finisher amen why because he had enough guts in him amen not to just start a race but to finish the race and they asked him said why why did you finish he said my country did not send me 5 000 miles to just start a race they sent me to finish a race Hallelujah I like that there's something about a person that has that in them that that you know God put us in this age not to start the race but to finish the race and we are going to finish this we heard brother Ron preach on that they saw the day in our meetings let's finish this we are going to finish this we're going to finish and bring forth amen out of this finish will bring forth the body change will bring forth the dead in Christ and in this finish it'll also finish every sin it'll finish every sickness it'll finish every trouble ever trial ever heartache amen it'll finish all parting and crying and and all the things that goes on in this life that we deal with we are to finish this race so this is not the age of Beginnings this is the age or the finished cycle that we're in now when God has spoken anything he will perform it he will bring it to pass when he said I'm going to have a bride I don't know how he's going to do it how it's going to be at the end without spot without wrinkle but I can tell you it's going to be somebody and he's going to finish it he's going to finish that line that is wrote there in that Bible and there is going to be a church without spot without wrinkle that'll be here in this last day where they're going to come from how's it going to be I don't know how it's all going to take place but I know it's going to happen because God is interested in finishing every promise every word every line every dot every Tittle and none of it will go unfulfilled because he is a finisher you know the angel of God will perform his word you know I think that's something how how he came and he and he brought down the children of Israel and he heard their cries and all of that but he came down and he wrote himself in their story and he came down on a burning bush and he got a hold of a prophet's attention and it begins to speak to him and it begins to talk to him says go to tell Pharaoh let my people go now it was going to be a big thing it wasn't going to happen overnight it was going to take a time and the Pharaoh is going to harden his heart and maybe Moses didn't have all that figured out but God knew exactly what was going to take place and I was reading today and I thought it was very interesting in the middle of all that's going on he tells Moses he said now you go back in there and you tell Pharaoh let my people go and in the middle of it he starts going down through the genealogy and he starts saying the sons about Moses and they have Aaron and a Simeon and of Judah and he names them all by names I thought well it ain't that interesting that in the middle of all of this he brings out the genealogy what was God doing I'm going to finish this I've started something that I'm going to finish it and I want to let the devil know this one's mine this one's mine this one's mine this was mine this one you go tell Pharaoh this one's mine that one's mine and you're not going to have one of them but I'm going to take them every one of them out of here foreign ain't that amazing that in this age he can look at the devil and he can say that one's mine that was mine that was mine that was mine that was mine and there ain't nothing you can do about it let them go and he's going to finish it he's going to fulfill every promise amen it might be the Bride of one for one part of the bride's still in the bar room what part of the bride's still over here but when God speaks their name they are going to come forth Hallelujah he's going to perform the things that he had said amen when the season comes the Harvesters will be there to take the right fruit amen Isaiah 46 and verse 9 says remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning amen declaring the end from the beginning or the beginning from the end or the but the end from the beginning from the anxious times of things that are not yet done saying my cancels my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure Hallelujah declaring from the ancient times the things that are not yet done but saying my counsel shall or my word shall stand and I will do all can you say all tonight I will do pleasure Hallelujah I want you to understand there's not one of his seeds that are German or to be germinated to life uh that was supposed to come to life amen that will not come to life but they will ever one come to life every one of them it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do and he tries to cover him up and he tries to keep him down he tries to push him down if God has a seed that's been predetermined before the foundation of the world to come to life to be a part of this bride she or he will be there the angel will watch over it to perform what he said he would do yes amen amen Isaiah 43 13 says from even from eternity I am he and there is none who can deliver out of my hand I act and who can reverse it hmm who can reverse it Jeremiah 32 and verse 27 behold I am the Lord the God of All Flesh is anything too difficult for me you know I was reading just a little thought somebody wrote down about Rachel in the Bible today and how Rachel had longed for a child and longed for a child and she was buried and she was bearing and she said it said the wrote there said she tried to rejoice when Leah would have a child and I'm trying to rejoice and sooner or later begin to come to where she said well maybe I'm just going to be this way maybe I'm just going to be this way and maybe I'll never have a child and maybe it'll never be this way amen but the scripture says God remembered Rachel wasn't Rachel remembered God God remembered Rachel and he remembered the promise that he had gave her and God was more than able to bring it to pass so therefore it doesn't matter how long the promises have lingered and how how long it seems like it's never going to come if God said it was going to come it'll be there there's nothing too hard for him he's the God who formed the foundation of the world and the word with the words of his mouth from the breath of his nostrils were the Stars cast forth and they hung in their place this God moves an angel stands to attention when he speaks creation Springs forth he is awesome he is powerful he is unparalleled he's unprecedented he has no rival he has I'm talking about your God tonight he has is not challenged he is all-powerful he is all-knowing therefore omnipotence and omniscience equals the perfect finisher Hallelujah so if he knows all about your story he knows how to get you to the end the expected ear he knows how to bring you where he wants you to be amen he's a finisher therefore he's going to finish he didn't come down to 2022 leaping over just about to break over into 23. and say you know what I just give up on this walk away he didn't leave his bride in the darkest time there's ever been walking alone but he has rode himself in her story and he's walking hand in hand with his bride he's leading her he's guiding her he's moving he's making a way where there seems to be no way he got an expected in for her amen if you're part of that bride I've kind of rejoiced a little bit right there because God knows exactly where the period goes in your life John chapter 4 and verse 34. let's let's just look at it Jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to what finish his work so he's a finisher to finish his work he's do everything he took to whatever he had to do to finish his work amen it led the Finish would lead to his death but he would do everything it took to finish his work amen there were scriptures that had to be fulfilled of him laying in a tomb somewhere so he would do everything he had to do to finish the work Philippians 1 6 says being confident of this very thing that he that which has begun a good work in you will perform it or we'll finish it we'll bring it to pass until the day of Jesus Christ matter of fact he would ride himself in our story Amen in Revelation 3 and verse 14 these things saith thee amen all right do you know what an Eggman is it's the Finish he wrote himself in your story as the finisher Hallelujah and not just the finisher but a faithful finisher and not just a faithful finisher but a true witness at the beginning of the creation of God so he's saying look I've been here since the beginning and I'll be here till the end I'm not going to leave you alone I'm not going to leave you out there by yourself and you're wondering how this is all going to take place don't worry I got the pen and I got the power and I'm going to bring my word to pass he's a finisher Brandon will talk about he said that's a wonderful description of the attributes of our Lord Jesus our savior Lord and Savior Jesus Christ these words alone makes me want to shout because they bring such a spirit of reality in my heart just reading them without even waiting for a thorough revelation of the spirit upon me Thrills me Jesus has given us a description of himself in relation to this last age so if it's going to be the cycle of the Finish he's going to write himself not as the beginner not even as the one in the middle but the finisher the amen amen he has looked from the first century right down to the 20th and told us all things concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last days to us he gives us one final look at his own gracious and supreme deity that's the cat this is the Capstone revelation of himself this is the summit this is the F and the Apex this is the top and here it is thus saith the amen Jesus is the a man of God he is the so let it be of God Amen stands for finality oh Hallelujah so I want you to understand he would say you are my son amen you are my daughter amen amen you are an overcomer amen amen yeah that's that hell never was for you amen are there any finishers in here this morning this evening is there any amens here today amen hell wasn't for me amen it ain't just you saying amen but Jesus Christ is also said amen it's not your home amen but I have a home for you I have a prepared place for an expected end amen and you're going to go to a place that knows no more doubt knows no more Darkness knows no more sin there's no more sickness there's no more devil there's no more torment amen amen amen Hallelujah it is the song Let It Be of God it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the Seal of God hello the Seal of God we would get excited if we had the Seal of the queen of or I guess it's now the king of England I got a letter look at here look what I got conceal do you know you got something with the King seal on it tonight hitting a worthless piece of paper Amen to say Amen it's the finisher hey man he he's not going to just finish it by his own power and His Own Strength In A Man Called Jesus but he's going to take the finisher and put it in you so there'll be something in you that when you the race gets tough I'm going to finish when it seems like you're getting hurt on every side I'm going to finish but it seemed like sickness is coming I'm going to finish when it seems like all hell is against you wake up in the morning the devil's around this corner and the devil's behind that door and the devil's over there and they're howling they're making fun I'm going to finish I'm going to get to the end I'm going to come across the finish line do we have anybody determined tonight I didn't start this race to quit I didn't start this race just give up I didn't start in this life to say I just want to walk away I didn't start here to quit and to give up and to walk out on God but no I started to finish I started to win I started to overcome I started to defeat every devil in hell come out now how many we got oh there's a lot of starters but where's the finishers at there's a lot that will begin the way so that's going to be holding the trophy at the closest Finish Line see I got it I made it it's over amen Hallelujah these people in these Olympics and these races are racing for a crown little Decay and it'll Fall Away you're not racing for a gold medal you're Racing for eternal life you're Racing for a crown it'll never come off your head that'll never go away better be there with you throughout the Eternal ages do we have some finishers it's one thing to start but it's another thing to finish and it's easy when you get started man go ahead jump on a bike first little bit is going to be easy start running toward Dixie end you get past that fence right there that man this ain't too bad just clicking along some of you may be better shape might make it down to that first church down there on the left like wow this is good I'm gonna and then well so far it ain't so far in the car I don't remember it being this far what's that I see way up there at the lights of dicks in no that's just the road it's got a couple of lights around it that turns down to the David Alanis and it's a lot further past that it was so easy started people get so enthused starting for the Lord and it's so easy you know why I've never had it so easy being a Christian we'll just keep going a couple miles and you get smacked around by a few Devils you get smacked around by this and that troubles in the church and this and that goes on if you're not immune from it amen you're the next thing you know man it's a lot harder than I thought it was I just don't have the joy I used to have and those in the beginners say I got it well just come on a little further come on a little further amen but what is it it ain't about who's in the middle who's in the beginning it's who crosses the end line amen is he that endures to the head it's he that presses the mark of the high calling and we're going to go to the mark not just see the mark not just look at the Mark not just shoot to the mark but we're going to go to the mark there's going to be somebody that's going to cross and we already got those this went on before us if we can look up in the grandstands tonight it'd be brother Daniel Williams it'd be brother Jerry Shaw it'd be Peppa memo box it'd be sister Kerry and be a whole bunch of people and they're up in the grandstands and they're looking down at you on a Wednesday night and they ain't just somebody standing with their arms folded they say come on let's go finish this don't give up don't stop trying to go it's worth it the finish line is worth it [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah yes let's read about the finish line Isaiah 65 says verse 16 says he that blessed me blesseth himself in the Earth shall bless himself in the god of Truth and he that has the god of the amen brother will bring that out he said he that sweareth and the Earth shall swear by the god of the amen the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten oh my God what a day that's going to be yeah I probably shouldn't ask for hands but I wonder how many woke up this morning and the first thing you thought of was your troubles that's going to be the be a day that the troubles are no longer remembered they are forgotten because they're hid from my eyes behold I create a new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be a glider Rejoice forever in that which I created from behold I create Jerusalem I rejoice and her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem enjoy my people and the voice of weeping there won't be no more caskets laying before a Pulpit and there's weeping and crying and missing and carrying off the voice of weeping shall be no more hurt in her nor the voice of Christ and this is the New Jerusalem this is the millennium he's the god of the amen Amen brother I don't talk about he said see the Old Testament was showing you the god of the amens the god of Truth the Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the new finishers God finished every story and Jesus came to finish and then he said you know what I'm going to need some finishers in the last day and the only way I'm going to better get finishers is they're going to have to have the finisher in them because those that walked with him they wasn't willing to finish ask Peter he denied him well I walk with Jesus that walking with him wasn't enough amen so Jesus knew that just being with me ain't enough he said therefore I got to go away so I can send the comforter so I can send the power that you can finish like I have finished that you will go and do the things that I have done not even the things just that I've done but greater than this shall you do because I'm going to not just be with you I'm going to be in you and I'm going to put the finisher on the inside of you the one amen that has given me the strength to carry the cross the one that's going to give me the strength to go down into hell and to knock on hell and the pump to punch the devil in the face and to slam the door in his face and to go back to the to the region of the lost and preach to them and then go to my Saints and tell them it's time to go home and the resurrection I'm going to give you that finisher and that finisher is going to be inside of you that when you get in the race and this comes against you and that comes against you this one says something over there that said something over there the devil Bops you over her head on a Wednesday morning get you in a foul mood but all about three o'clock there's something moving around I gotta go to church amen I gotta be in the house of God Amen what is it there's a finisher on the inside of you and it's going to finish the race if it has to Bear a cross if it has to die whatever it's going to finish [Music] he's the god of the amen and he never changes Sophie write something about you and it gives you a part to play and in this script you're giving this part son daughter he don't get to the middle of the story and say you know what you don't fit the part giving you something else you're going to hell they gave you the part to begin with and this God don't change amen he gave you the title of son the title of daughter he ain't about to change your title he ain't about to change nothing about that title if he put that on you he's going to make sure you finish as a son you finish as a daughter come on now you Finn if he put you as a title amen you I'm gonna write you in as an overcomer he that overcome shall set with me in my Throne just as I have overcome and sat with my father in his throne so he wrote you that way therefore you can't come and sit with that one didn't do it um he just writes the story and he changes the the not just not your story not who you are he just writes it around to bring you to the place where you got to be as job God wanted to ride himself in the job's story so the Devil comes by and he says and God says have you considered my servant job well yeah I've considered him but you know what this store is rigged you put a wall around him and I can't get to him he said well let me write a little something in here I'm going to take the wall down do everything but destroy his life but he will not deny me and job ends up you know all the destruction he went through and you know what he had some church members about three of them come over there and try to give him some comfort I listened to that the other day and I thought God have mercy don't send me no comforters like that don't send me nothing like that amen well you hadn't done something job it has to be some sin in your life job has to be something oh God was just writing a story and God was going to bring him to an expected end and you know the the latter of job's life was going to be greater than the farmer his end was going to be greater than his beginning come on now and yours will be the same way wait man when you say well I just began I got the Holy Ghost and yes you that's a wonderful thing we all got to have it praise God we've got to have a finisher in your life amen but that is just a deposit that's a down payment of what's going to come he's going to finish it and at the end of Joe's story was it Allahu is that his name came into the story he said job let me show you a few things get up off that ass Heap get up off that ass sheep I want you to look past where you're at I want to look past all that my ashes and that destruction around you and I want you to catch another vision and he lifted him up to a place to where he could look thousands of years later and job hey I know my redeemer living there he is that's the finisher and those skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh I will see God he never changes what he does never change what he says it stands fast he does it and it's done forever that's quite the finisher none can take from what he says or add to what he says the devil wants to add to it well your son but you're a daughter but no no nobody can add to what he said he said Son he said daughter he said overcomer he said Satan Bruiser he said Satan Stomper and nothing can add or take away from what he says so let it be amen so let it be aren't you glad you served that kind of God I don't know about you I said it before but I'm sure glad I don't serve a god who's so fickle that one day he loves me and the next day he don't one day I'm his and one next day I'm not that ain't God if God ever loved you he's always going to love you if God ever called you you're always going to be called if you ever was a son or a daughter in his mind you're always going to be a daughter or son in his mind he's never going to take his pen and strike you out if he wrote your name on the Lamb's Book of Life God himself cannot take that away amen the devil tries he tries to erase it all the time but he ain't got nothing powerful enough to take that name off of the Lamb's Book of Life It Was Written there before the foundation of the world and what the author says stays and he's going to finish it these things saith amen I like that it means that whatever he said is final so did you get cancer it ain't what you said is final it ain't what your boss said is final it ain't what somebody else said it's fine it ain't what the devil says is final it's What God Says is finally the devil says you're sick but that's not final what's final is what God Said I'm the Lord God that heals all diseases amen the devil said you've done this you've done that but that's not final the devil says you're lost that's not final Hallelujah but God said you're an overcomer amen God said you're you're you're more than able amen it means that what he started out with in Genesis he will finish in Revelations he has to for he is the amen so let it be so we can see why the devil hates the Book of Revelation or Genesis and Revelations he hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail he knows what his end will be Hallelujah he's already read the back of the book and he knows there ain't nothing he can do to change the end of his story that makes me able to run around this place because the devil wants to try to tell you he's going to last longer than you he tries to tell you he's going to overcome you he tries to tell you I'm greater than you know the back of the book says there's a pit of fire that you're going to be thrown into and there's no going to be no more to you forever amen and while you're down there burning and carrying on and screaming I'm going to be on the heels of Glory shouting the victory [Applause] the devil knows the end of his story and he knows you're into these things saith the faithful and true Witness he's faithful it's true he said is you know he said many people think make you want to view him as being impersonal but he's a very personal God as though God made us it looks like as though God made a way of salvation for lost Mankind and wave being the cross and then the death of the Cross of Christ has atone for our sins Resurrection gave us an open door to him and God just folded his arms and stood back it is if we major in believing in a great Creator who's have created lost personal interest in his creation Now say that is how too many people are apt to think but that's the wrong thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now he's both Creator and sustainer Hallelujah and he's in the midst of his church he's working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he's in the midst of it all he's a great Creator savior God is faithful Faithfully working amongst his own right now as a great Shepherd of the sheep his very own existence he is his very existence is for his own he loves him and cares for them His Eye Is ever upon them when the word says that your lives are hidden with Christ and God it means exactly what it says oh I'm so glad that my God abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to his word he will back it up he's true to us he will lose not one of us but will raise us up in the last day I'm glad I can rest in that kind of faithfulness Philippians 1 6 says being confident of this very thing he that has begun a good work and you will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ John let's look at one last thought on the finisher amen John chapter 19 and verse 30 said when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghosts but I understand when the Great Shepherd was smitten that great shape Prophet when he was smitten back there he said it is finished and that minute as soon as a Shepherd was smitten it was over sin is settled there's no more to sin they were clean the penalty was paid the Believers whose names were written in the Book of Life predestinated from the foundation of the world it was finished from the very minute Jesus said it's finished Hallelujah he put the finishing touches on it he that great Shepherd had come for his sheep it was finished God's right hand was pulled from his bosom smitten but then on Easter he returned it again and raised up that Buddhism again and extended it down to you and I in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original Garden from which sin took us from that hidden secret of his Great Harvest revealed he said no wonder the mountains jumped for joy and shouted that day no wonder the sun hid his face and it screamed for joy catch the picture now no wonder all nature broke loose and the wind shook the trees and they shook and Shook and Jordan they seen the prophet Shepherd on the mountain redeem every name on The Book of Life [Music] Hallelujah and they seemed that their own nature was being redeemed I saw that was being redeemed they screamed they jumped they shouted the Earth went into an earthquake and the mountains written the Rocks fell out and the sun went down what happened the shepherd screamed out it is finished oh Hallelujah he said I've seen jumping sparrows and I've seen Joyce spells and there was nobody hurt the mountains rung out the sun went down he said I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people we're free why are we free the finisher said it's finished [Applause] oh hallelujah what would happen tonight when you realize the finishers spoke over your life and he said it's finished that torment devil is finished that's sin is finished and sickness is finished and suicide spirit is finished I hear the finisher speaking tonight this ain't just Timothy Pruitt this is the finisher speaking see it is finished healing is taking place this is finished oh Hallelujah prison bars are finished amen have a prison in the house is open suicide is finished Hallelujah anxiety is finished fear is finished Hallelujah pressures of laodicea that's trying to make you bow it's over with the finishers come in the building and people are revealed to them it's over [Music] that's what happened to Sister Lana amen The Finisher came in the building and the next thing she's new I'm leaning on the arms of my finisher Hallelujah he saw me in this battle he showed me over and over I'm with him he's with me amen and I'm just going to run around this church on the arms of my finisher hey man I'll never forget that service she come out of there by the time she came by this Pulpit Mario your enemy is dead finished oh I've seen George spells and I've seen jumping spells and there wasn't nobody hurt but when people begin to realize amen I'm free from the world I'm free from the things of the world and the joy of the Lord feels a congregation they'll stand and scream and cry and Shout to the top of their voices for the glory of God I never seen anything disheartily it was always right in order because they recognize my name is on the last book alive that's what happened to John when he saw that book and he looked down in there what'd he say he saw his name written there he said all heaven and all Earth and all things under the Earth heard me shouting heard me screaming heard me rejoicing amen why he saw himself and he saw the finisher had wrote his name oh my god when you begin to realize maybe you've just been coming around this hill for a while it's maybe you're going to been on a flat place but it's getting tough ever been on a flat place and you don't realize it but you're actually still going uphill it wouldn't look like it in fact it probably look like you may be going downhill let off the gas right well you want to buy some quit pedaling you'll come to just a squeak and a halt amen you may be feeling like you're on a flat place but we're still climbing we're climbing up the mountain we're climbing up to the top amen we're climbing to the place of Ascension why do you think that Caleb wanted the mountains he wanted that place where the resurrection was going to take place he wanted that place amen with a with the glories of God was going to be and he said I'm going to finish this I've waited 80 something years for this give me my Mountain it was a finisher inside of for Caleb something about it he didn't care what the odds was he didn't care what was against him he didn't care how highly climbed I'm going to take my Mountain because that's where God's glory is going to be revealed and I want to be there we're all climbing up the hill you may feel like you're just barely climbing and it seems like everything's about to finish you you're about to suicide's about to finish you depression's about to finish you sickness of some sort is about to finish it it's about over but I want you to understand it's not about to finish you you are about to finish it amen you are about to be the finish of every sickness of every disease of every devil of every Spirit of hell Hallelujah because when we cross that Finish Line it is finished [Applause] so why would we give up when we're so close to home Mercy bring this down Paul would write about it in second Timothy 4 and verse 6 he said for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand but I fought a good fight I say I've said before I say it again if we're going to fight let's make it a good fight let's make sure the devil knows we fight we ain't laying over and just giving him the right of way no no we didn't come this far to just lay over and let the devil run Rob rip shot over the top of us and make fun of us no no no no no no no no no no no no no but there's an authority in the body of Christ there's a finisher there I have fought a good fight I have finished my finished my course I have kept the faith that's a good finish I've kept the faith henceforth there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness with the Lord the righteous judge should give me at that day and not me only but to all of them also that love is appearing of the other finishers will also have this crowd of righteousness First Corinthians 9 verse 24 says know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain that's on the Earthly race and he said every man that's striving for the master is tempered in all things in other words what they win is temporary now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we and an incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainty so fight I not as one that beats the air but I keep my body and I breathe I keep under my body and I bring it into subjection less by any means when I preach the others I myself might be a Castaway started good finish there's preachers that start good but they didn't finish they're wrecks all looked like great gifts and great anointings and great powers and singers and players of music and this that and the other and then today laying along the sides of the road off on some trail somewhere and they didn't finish read the scripture again being confident of this very thing he that which begun a good work in you will perform it it will accomplish it it will finish there will be a performance made to bring to an expected end this is the meaning of it to accomplish something to perfect something to execute something to complete something oh my he's going to bring it and when we come to that moment of crossing the finish line that day you see Jesus face to face it'll be worth it all when you come to that last moment the dead in Christ rise and we go to meet him in the air all of the moments that you spent from whatever your dash was you know that's what I was thinking about the other day on tombstones 1960 to 2000 and one there's a dash in between all that really matters is what happens in that Dash that little bitty spot and in that Dash can be a lot of hurts can be a lot of pressures can be a lot of persecution can be a lot of people walked away from me can be a lot of things that just stuck so deep but past that Dash whether you go by the way of the grave or whether you go into body change all of a sudden that Dash is going to seem so insignificant all that toll and all that running and all that pressuring all that torment and all those mind battles and all all the things that Satan tried to stop you and trip you along the way and you fell down you skint yourself and you got back up and you kept pushing and you fell down you got back up and you kept pushing somebody stuck their foot out and tripped you and you got back up and you kept pushing all in that Dash all of a sudden you see his face that Dash is not going to mean so much it's not going to hurt so much it's not going to make you cry so much it's not going to be worrying no more because you will be transformed in that moment to be like him not just him being in you but your whole body be transformed into the finisher all your weaknesses will be gone you had to limp all the way down the last miles crippled up in some kind of condition it'll be over with all your weaknesses will be gone you had to drag legs how to make yourself get up had to make yourself go it'd all be gone all your failures and all your frailties will all be gone all your insecurities will all be gone you'll be transformed into Perfection that day and you will totally reflect the glory of God the finisher First John 3 said beloved now are we the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him amen and we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is all of the dash insecurities the complexes the things that tried to hinder you in every step of the journey all of a sudden you cross that line and it's all gone and all you're looking at is the face of Jesus what's he going to say well done you finished you made it he wasn't the one who ran the fastest he wasn't the one who carried the most burdens you may not be the one who who had the most battles you might be the one who carries the most burdens you might get the most rewards of all the battles but the most important thing is you finished all of us here about the Finish Revelations 21 and 1 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away man that makes me want to shout because I know in that first Earth there was a lot of Mind battles in that first Earth there was a lot of devils of torment and it's passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw that holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven said behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears to all glory all those things that happened in that Dash it's all going to be wiped away from their eyes and there'll be no more death there'll be no more sorrow there'll be no more cry there'll be no more pain for the former thing did you hear that devil for the former things are passed away Hallelujah and he that settle the Thrones and behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done whoa there's a finisher again it is done I am the alpha I am the Omega I am the beginning I am the end I give unto him that is thirst of The Fountains of the water life freely and he that overcometh oh do you hear the author writing your story amen he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son so he wrote you at a sign at the beginning and he's writing you as a son at the end Hallelujah Hallelujah oh my but the fearful and the unbelievers and the Abominable and the murders and the whoremongers and the sorcerers and the idolaters and all liars to have their part of the language partner with fire and brimstone which is the second death and every devil that was in that Dash is gone finished The Finisher finished him he's not come to this place and here we are back to harvest time and the seed is pulled away from the shuck is pulled away from the seed and the seed has been laying in the presence of the Sun ripening and he comes down to the Harvest that's about the dumbest time for a farmer to ever give up be the dumbest time he's done hold he's unplanted he's unwatered he'd unswaited the droughts and so every kind of thing he's done went through and to give up when the Harvest is ready well if you think you think God's going to get no way in the world he hadn't watched this plant go down into the ground come up as a little little blade of grass into what it became in the tassels and or the blades and the tassels and and the ear of corn and the Chuck pull away and there's a seed it's a I can't finish this no no he's going to finish it he's going to finish it and behold all things will be made no he's gonna burn this place with fire and every whoremonger Sorcerer And idolater every liar ever unbelievable ever fearful ever devil of hell he's going to finish and he's going to have a people that's going to finish it are you part of that group I am I'm determined going to finish it not by strength not by my power but by his spirit saith the Lord the finisher has made sure he's got a people who will finish come on now this ain't the time to be ready to just
