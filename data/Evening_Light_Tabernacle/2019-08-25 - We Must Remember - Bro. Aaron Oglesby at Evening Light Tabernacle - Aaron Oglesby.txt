anxious heart how so easily you forget I believe that's the human condition this morning that's something we're going to be dealing with how easily we forget but this morning we want to remember the Lord Jesus this morning we want to remember what he's done for us this morning we want to look past the circumstance of Laodicea look past the circumstances of your life I know many times we were surrounded by awful circumstances we don't downplay that we're not here to tell you just pick yourself up by the bootstraps we're and Lord we know that you care for us Lord and you're gonna do what's best for us even if we don't understand it sometimes Lord we can trust in you oh that's where my trust is this morning for this service Lord God that you'll take my words and all God that you'll take this the time and study Lord God as I lay it down before you now and you'll use it how you see fit Lord know that you'll speak what you want spoken Lord Lord that this morning we will remember you Lord God I pray that you'll take complete control now of this body Lord of my lips of my tongue Lord for I can say nothing Lord that would help these people if you don't come and move Lord though we're asking your presence to convict hearts Lord God we're asking your presence Lord God to lift people up and log on me everything today be said Lord in the spirit of love Lord Jesus and the spirit Lord God that we all want to be ready no matter what it takes come now I pray father in Jesus precious name Amen bless y'all if you'll take your Bibles and open with me to Psalms chapter 78 I have a little bit of a lengthy scripture wheat reading I don't have to pray that you'll just bear with me and stand through the reading of the word Psalms chapter 78 and we will we'll start right at verse 1 he says give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth I will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children's showing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done for he established the testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children notice a theme right here he wants it repeated he wants it repeated he wants it told - that your children and your children's children he never wants his works or his word to ever be forgotten he wants it to go on for a generation after generation in verse eight it says and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart all right and whose spirit was not steadfast with God the children of Ephraim Ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned back in the day of battle they kept not the Covenant of God and refused to walk in his law and forget his works and his wonders that he had showed them marvelous things he did in their sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt and in the field of Zola and so not only does he want you to remember he's pointing out certain people's that have already forgotten he's pointing out that even though I did so many amazing things in Egypt they forgot and so he's telling you remember today he's gonna tell you remember remember remember and never forget we're gonna keep reading verse 13 he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as a heat in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with the light of fire he clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depths he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness and they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust yea they spake against God and said can God furnish a table in the wilderness after everything he's done they said but can't he do this after everything he gave them they said but what about meat nothing he did was good enough for him and because it was not good enough for him they would forget it verse 20 behold he smoked the rock that their waters gushed out and the streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for his people therefore the Lord heard this and was wroth so that a fire was kindled against Jacob and anger also came up against Israel because they believed not in God entrusted not in his salvation though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven and had rained nana upon them to eat and had given them of the of the corn of heaven man did eat angels food he sent them meat to the fool may God bless you as you have your seat I'm a read from a to more places very briefly before we get started I'm gonna read one verse in Psalms chapter 20 I want to read verse 7 now we see what the children of Israel did we see that no matter what God did for them they would never remember and in Psalms chapter 20 verse 7 this is to be our testimony some trust in chariots some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord our God Psalm 77 and 11 ah we'll remember the works of the Lord surely I will remember thy wonders of old this morning I want to encourage you to remember I'm gonna speak to you this morning our title today is we must remember last week I told you or two weeks ago when I ministered here I told you that I wanted to encourage you and and lift you up and and surely I believe the Word of God should always be encouraging no matter what we speak on but today I want to challenge you I want to challenge you that if you have forgotten today you must remember if you have forgotten what God has done for you today jog your memory wake up and realize he's been so very good to me we see right here that that victory comes through remembrance but failure comes through forgetting and that's how it's going to be our themes today victory comes through remembrance failure comes from forgetting and God hates to be forgotten God does not like to be forgotten when he's done so much when he's poured himself out and yet how easily we forget and you saw in our scripture reading how his anger burned within him and he was so frustrated because these were his children and we've all been there we know how it is when you feel like you've done so much for one of your children or you've you've given them so much maybe it's for for a special day and you go and you do all this stuff and at the end of the day they're pouty because they didn't get to do this one thing they wanted to do and how frustrated it makes you you feel like I gave and I gave and I gave and what I thought I would get was thank you so much what I thought I would get is I love you so much I appreciate it I know you gave so much thank you thank you thank you and instead you're like what's wrong well I thought we were going to do this and that is just a minor thing compared to what we're talking about we're the King of Kings laid aside his splendor laid aside his glory lay aside everything and came to be a man to take beatings for us to take whippings for us to take the cross for us and then we forget and say Lord my life it and what I wanted it to be imagine the pain that causes him the disappointment that causes him and we're going to be going a little bit slower today so just bear with me God hates to be forgotten and we live in a hyper busy tongue we live in a time in a world that's designed to keep you busy all the time every day it seems like that our schedules are packed to the max and it seems like we don't have time for anything and if we squeeze just one more thing in this day I'm just going to explode because I've already got so much to do so much to do and there's so much going on and it seems that we have more convenience than ever before but it seems like we're stretched for time more than we've ever been stretched before and I've often wondered how did people and in the days gone by how did they get everything done in a day I mean they didn't have a microwave they didn't have a zero-turn they didn't have these things to knock out all the the work and the chores and the just the basic things of life like we do and I've often wondered how did they get everything done and then I begun to think about how what I believe it is is that we do a lot of things that aren't necessarily things that we have to do we spend a lot of time chasing after things that aren't actually a necessity you come to realize that we do more than what's necessary and in times gone by before modern convenience they only had and they only focused on what their needs were why do I have to do today to put food on the table what do i have to do today to make sure there's a roof over our head why do I have to do today to make sure I have clothing and then focusing on that it gave them plenty of time to focus on and why do I have to do to make sure my family has a walk with the Lord why do I have time yeah what do I need to do today to make sure my children know that God is a living God what do I need to do today to make sure that the presence of God is welcome in my home and because they had time because they weren't focused on all the extra stuff they knew what was important in their life they needed food water and shelter and most importantly they needed the Lord Jesus they couldn't get by without the Lord Jesus but we've come to a point where everything so convenient how easy it is for us to forget him for a day or forget him for two days and then not remembering until trouble comes around us see I believe we live in a time where the lines between needs and wants have become blurred to where we spend a lot of time working for things that we want we spend a lot of time doing things that we want and then complaining that we don't have any time see I hear it all the time and I'm extremely guilty of this myself I really need to do this today I really need to get that today I don't have any time for this this week I have so much to do and so many of these things actually fall underneath the want category and they don't fall underneath the needs category now listen I'm not complaining I'm very thankful we live in a place where we have stuff I'm not complaining I'm not getting on to you I'm thankful that that we get to do fun stuff I'm thankful that I get to go on a vacation I'm thankful that I get to have hobbies but what I'm telling you is that those things in the pursuit of those things cannot be what consumes your life those things cannot be what consumes our life and our pursuit of pleasure in our quest for the things that we won't have we've forgotten what it is that we really need have we forgotten what it is that we really have Israel was / I did four on their journey in every single way imagine Allah imaginable but time after time after time they would forget time after time they would allow their walls to get in place of their needs the Lord was pouring out angel food for them and angels food and they're going but we won't meet this is angels food I've opened up the heavens and done something for you that I've never done for anybody your needs have been supplied yes Lord but this is what we want and we got to get to a point to where our wants and our needs are in there right in proper place it's okay to want stuff but the Lord said he would provide every one of your needs there are so many things right now that seems so important to us and young people you may not understand this yet and then the older you are you definitely understand this better I can remember well very well being a teenager and the things that I just had to have the things that I just needed so very much and yet all of its gonna pass away every bit of it is a vapor and and the reality of it is this morning you take everything you're sitting there on that bench thinking about whoever you are whatever your age is what you have need of your thinking I need to do this and tomorrow I need this and tomorrow at the end of the day let me tell you you only have need of one thing you need the Lord Jesus Christ at the end of the day you need a closer walk with the Lord you need a consecrated home we need consecrated Daddies that produce consecrated homes that produce cuts are created children that is truly our need today we need more of the Lord Jesus and we need less of the stuff we think we need and that's where we're at today but the world has been created in a place where there's stuff at our fingertips all the time and there's social media showing where this person is doing this and this person is doing this and this person got a new car god bless them I'm happy they got to do those things but it begins to weigh on our minds and why not me why am I getting to do that why don't I have a new vehicle Lord why don't I have more money Lord why don he's they're going after all I've done for you after all I've done for you and what you're gonna get back to me is a great what you're gonna get back to me is a focus on what you don't have remember today the Lord Jesus remember today what he's done for you in your life what we need to remember today is our calling what we need to remember is our purpose why are we here have we forgotten what we're really here for not to live through life not to perpetuate the ages not to have a good church service not to gather together and just have a good time have we forgotten why we're here have we forgotten our purpose and if you get nothing else out of this today I want you to remember why you were here you were here to serve the King of Kings you were here to serve the Lord of lords you've been called to be the very bride of Jesus Christ remember the Lord Jesus today you're going to hear that all through the service and you're gonna say man he's repeating that a lot but I want you to leave here today going I must remember I must remember the Lord I can't get caught up in the ends and outs of the word I can't get caught up in circumstances and forget the most important thing I can't get so focused on my pursuit of my dreams it's good to have dreams pursue your dreams but you better make sure that the Lord is in those dreams you matter make sure that it's the Lord's will you better make sure that he has the most important place in your life don't forget the Lord this morning listen working for a better life is good working to better your family's good working to better your education is good making sure your bills are paid that's good you better or next week you ain't have no lights it's important to make sure we take care of those things having hobbies having fun those things are good we're not we're not preaching about that but that cannot be what consumes us book of Luke chapter 21 verse 33 the Lord Jesus says heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away so there's only one thing that's truly important there's only one thing that's not going to burn and that's his word and those who trusted in his word and those who remembered his word and those dudes stayed true to his word verse 34 and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting that's extreme living consuming too much partying things of that nature drunkenness and cares of this life so that they come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all of them that dwell on the face of the whole earth we all have cares notice every single one of us has carriers of this life we all have jobs we all have as children to take care of we have things to do those are cares of life we all have a wife to take care of her a husband to take care of her a family to take care of we have things each and every day and those things are our cares now notice what are we to do with those cares he didn't say those cares were sinful but notice he said those things were just as dangerous as sinful things he mentioned sir fighting he mentioned drunkenness and then he said and the cares of life no the cares of life you would think well why are those things mention in with drunkenness why are those things mentioned in with sir fighting because he's telling you that is just as dangerous as sin if that's the thing that ensnares you if that's what in Snares your heart then it's just as dangerous as sin so so much it says that these things are so dangerous that there'll be a snare on to you so what do I do with these cares what do I do with these words if I know that they can snare me if I know that they can trap me yet I know that I'm consumed with them and I have them what am I to do with these well he gives us specific instructions on what to do with these cares if you look in first Peter chapter 5 and verse 6 he tells you exactly what did you are to do with your cares because we all have cares and we all have these things weighing down upon us and he says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you he says give all these things to him and let him sort them out too busy we're trying to sort out I want this I want this I need this I need I need I need I need and he's saying just give it off to me give it off to me I care for you which means I will you exactly what you have need of I'll look at these cares in decides which ones you really need and I'm going to trust his decision over my own decision my selfish flesh will say I need it all but the Lord says cast it all to me give me all your cares and then because I care for you I will give you exactly what it is you have need of first Peter five and eight we're continuing he says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour so he says give him your cares so that you can focus on the Lord Jesus because those who are not focused on the Lord Jesus are going to be devouring so you say my job is dangerous but not necessarily it can be a blessing but if it's what consumes you and it's all you think about and that's all you think day and night day and night which I don't know who would do that because when I leave work I'm done alright but some people get so consumed with things and he says he's walking about to consume whom he may devour if you don't lay it all at Jesus feet so today give him your cares focus on Christ notice those who focus is not on him are subject to the enemy's attack that's what I want us to remember this morning if your focus is not on him and you've forgotten him then you are subject to the enemy's attack listen this morning this is not a sermon against things they're sitting a sermon against your leisure time but what we're talking about is a world that has been designed to make you forget a world that has been designed to make you so busy an Eden of Satan that takes your time that fills every single minute with something to do that sends new battles at you every single day that put your focus on the trials and put your focus on the evils and Satan's job his one thing is to make you forget this man Satan is trying to make you forget with everything what the Lord has done for you where the Lord has brought you from Satan's job is to distort the truth and to point you to the circumstances because he knows that God hates to be forgotten see if we can if we can if he can get you this morning to forget about God's promises if he can get you this morning to forget all that God has already done for you in the past and he will begin to rob you of your victory because when you forget then the next thing that comes along with forgetting is doubt because you forget that he's already delivered you once and so when you face something you begin to doubt and then after a doubt comes unbelief and we know that you can't please the Lord if you're living in unbelief so if he can get you to forget what God has done for you this morning he's gonna rob you of your victory and he's gonna rob you of your worship he's gonna rob you of your prayer life and then unbelief and doubt and these things are soon gonna follow and it's time that we start to forget the things that should be forgotten and start to remember the things that should be remembered you know fraidy says in philippians verse three he says with one thing I do forgetting the things that are in the past forgetting those things I look towards the future I look to those things which are to come it's time that if we're gonna forget something we start forgetting things that should be forgotten if you're gonna forget something this morning how about you forget to love the enemy if you're going to forget something this morning how about you forget the devil in his past and all the things he's put on you how about you forget the life that you once live how about you forget your failures this morning and remember Jesus remember what done-for-you remember what he did for you in the past and then looking to that realizing he's faithful then look to the promises of the future forget what's in the past I realize I have a promise of healing have a promise of the Holy Ghost I have a promise of a rapture I have a promise that I've gone to prepare a place for you forget the things in the past forget the lies of the devil and look to the truth of God's Word this morning if we're gonna be forgetful forget the things that should be forgotten and remember the things that should be remembered remember every one of God's promises remember that they're true remember today that you've been bought with the price remember today that you're God's child remember today that he's worthy to be praised remember that he's done so very much for us how can we not praising how can we not give him our everything but you don't know my situation I don't but I know he's done so much for you I know he's done so much for this church every single one here today is a blessed person we have something to give him praise for remember he's worthy to be praised God loves to be remembered he hates it when we forget God has not a forgetful God himself although there are things that he chooses to forget thank God he chooses to forget our sins when we repent of them when we give him our sins and he forgets those things but when it comes to his promises to you when it comes to his people he said a mother may forget her child he said but I will never forget you I will never forget you and yet we so easily forget him how easily we forget our purpose how easily we forget our calling has the cares of this life begin to pile up all around us we must remember that we are called to be overcomers in this age we must remember that we're called to shine the light of a gospel to a dying world there are things we must remember this morn we're called to be the bride of Jesus Christ and what that calling comes a responsibility to remember we're called to take a rapture and yet sometimes when I hear the conversations of people and the things that maybe they desire or won't when I hear the things that stumble people when I hear the grippe and the complaints and you hear why this one quit or why that one quit or why this one's unhappy what this one doesn't like and why this person's grumbling I begin to wonder have we forgotten have we forgotten what it's really all about have we forgotten how much God has done for us have we forgotten what he's done for us even in this building and then go back to the old place in the years that his hand as God at us brother Craig the years his hands been upon your life the blessings that you've seen the blessings I've seen how can we forget that how can we look at a trial coming up and in the middle of something and go oh God are you able oh God what's going on God have you forgotten me how can we forget all that he's done as we see things creep back in we begin to see the world try to blend its way back in amongst our young people sometime amongst the old people you say have we forgotten have we forgotten the cry come out of her my people come out separate yourselves if you fail to separate yourselves don't you realize even if you're sitting in this church or whatever Church I don't care if it's Methodists or message if you haven't separated yourself then you're going to be protectors of the plague have you forgotten come out of her my people be separate saith the Lord we can't forget this brother Branham says how can we blend in with the day when God is so against the day he's called out this day the the he said it's past us they have grace it turned down the call of God there's been an indictment you can't blend in with something that's been indicted that makes you yourself guilty if we forget we'll be partakers and her plagues brother Branham says he will come in judgment upon the nation's and while he is being revealed in mercy Oh hurry you hither run quickly children get away from these man-made Babylonian theological walls of unbelief in cold formalism like I said I don't care what titles on your church door if it's man made Babylonian walls with cold formalism run away from it get away from that where light flows don't forget what he restored us back to in this day we must remember he says run away from man-made theology get out in the middle of the field in God's grace and there scream for mercy for it is his blood of his own son that gives the mercy to us get away from this old world of doubt get away from your superstitions accept God's message of mercy and his message of deliverance and flee to the middle of his grace and their scream O Jesus thou son of God have mercy on me others did it down through the ages many were willing to separate another stood before us we can't forget them brother Branham would point to it many times he said must I be carried to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sell through bloody seas have we forgotten who we are in this day look I know this is simple I'm very aware of it but last Sunday morning as I was getting ready for church I was going lord I don't know what I'm going to minister what thought it just struck me we must remember we must remember I was standing there in my home and I told Lydia Sheba asked me what are you going to preach I don't know well you're gonna freak I don't know I wish I knew and then I told her I said it just came to me and it hit me this is what the Lord wants you to hear this morning maybe I'm not doing it justice but we must remember you cannot forget what the Lord has done for you in this day what he's done for you have we forgotten who we are have we forgotten what the Lord has done for us have we forgotten Calvary there's a great danger in forgetting over and over again the scripture would tell you to remember remember remember it's all through the scriptures search the word remember it's a central theme in the scriptures remember remember brother Branham would say over and over again he would say he would use this statement he would say remember and never forget remember and never forget it's because forgive will lead you to defeat forgetting will lead you to defeat whereas remembering is going to bring victory even like Tabernacle this morning we must remember one God doesn't like to be forgotten - God hates complaining lord have mercy on me there's been many times in my life I've been a complainer lord have mercy on me because he's done so very much for us when we complain it makes it look as if what does it make it look as if it shows that we're ungrateful for what he's done when we complain and griping and it's an indication that you've forgotten if you're complaining you're saying Lord your blessings on me are not enough the things you have done for me Lord they're not enough His goodness is not enough his miracles is not enough and it's really at the end of the day it's a slap in the face to God Israel had a problem they were on this vicious cycle of forgetting complaining forgetting complaining forgetting complaining and you find it it's almost a theme of the Old Testament as they journey to the promised land forget complain forget complain and they're on a journey exactly like the one we're on and in the journey there's going to be times where unexpected things come upon your life listen brother Tim has a saying he says you know heathens have flat tires - no that's not how he says it Christians have flat tires - I totally messed that up Christians have flat tires - heathens - that's great Christians have flat tires - in other words we are not immune to problems of life we're not immune to one day getting in a situation that we don't know how to handle as a matter of fact if we would get ourselves to the place that we realized we don't know how to handle anything we'd be much better off because as soon as we walked into that situation and we hit that moment instead of trying to figure it out instead of trying to fix it ourselves we would instantly cast our cares upon Jesus and we would be way better off because he would figure it out a lot better than you could and I promise you you would always live in the will the Lord if you gave everything to him but instead we always try to figure it out so when we hit something we didn't expect when we hit something we look at as a problem it's why me Lord why is this going on in my life how come this is happening and Lord why didn't you forewarn me of this and why and why and why and you've forgotten that the last time you hit a situation like that he delivered you out of it you've forgotten that the last time you were down in a ditch like that he pulled you out of it we've forgotten that his grace is sufficient we've forgotten that no matter what's going on around us he's going to see you through he has not forgotten you you are his people he can never forget you just trust in the Lord and remember they're going to journey and we know that there's going to be hardships and trials but hasn't he already done enough that if he never does another thing in your life you should be able to remember and thank him for it Israel had a front-row seat it's one of the most powerful outpourings of God that ever hit the face of the earth they were there in the land of Egypt and they witnessed the actual power of the spoken word as a man would call for flies brother Branham said there might not be a fly in the country and a few minutes later there's one little green fly and then next thing you know he said something like five pounds a square yard or something I'll remember the exact number but they witnessed they witnessed him speaking call for frogs they witnessed these things they witnessed that the the hell and they witnessed yet the plagues that fell upon the cattle they witnessed the river turned to blood they witnessed all these things they saw every bit of it with their own eyes they they realized that here we are in Goshen right there all these things are falling and none of us even touching us I'm sure it was a common talking around the table can you believe this brother Craig once again God spoke and it's striking our enemies isn't God good isn't God wonderful he's delivering us isn't God good this is amazing and they saw as their God brought Pharaoh in Egypt to its knees they witnessed the most powerful world or country in the world be brought down and left in absolute shambles they had a front-row seat to this and they may march out of Egypt and their testimony is God is good god is wonderful our god is great God is mighty wondrous are his works oh we love you God you're so good to us you're soulless you're so great you're so wonderful how we appreciate you Lord and they started out and their initial response to this the spectacular deliverance from Egypt starts out as praise and you remember when God saved you when he first called you out how you just couldn't wait to talk to him thank you Jesus you couldn't wait to be in the house of God you couldn't wait to worship the music would start playing and you would just begin to feel just relaxed that the cares of the world would fade away and that's how they start out out of Egypt god you're so good and their praise and worship wholehearted trust and yet it doesn't take but a few days and it's grumbling complaining murmuring quarreling Moses where's the meat we're supposed to eat Moses who put you in charge Moses there's no water here have you forgotten have you forgotten already spiritual amnesia can take takes complete control of them covers over their eyes and so soon they forgot God's gracious and miraculous deliverance we're literally days away from them leaving Egypt when they come to the Red Sea you know we read this and through our eyes you look at the people of Israel and if you're anything like me you look at me go how could how could they not realizing how guilty we are of the same thing how could they possibly do that and guilty of it ourselves Exodus 14 and 10 and when Pharaoh drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord now if you read that Scripture and it was a standalone Scripture I don't think I'd have a problem with it they cried out to the Lord if you stopped right there does that mean they said Lord we know what you did in Egypt we're crying out to you now to once again bring your mighty deliverance we're crying out to you Lord right now to strike down Pharaoh once again we trust you Lord we know that just days ago you delivered us from his hand we trust you lord thank you Lord Jesus is that what it means by cried out to the Lord there nope next verse and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt dust with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians that we should die in the wilderness my didn't we tell you just leave us alone then we tell you a preacher to get off our back didn't we tell you to stay off those worldly pleasures and the things we like to do in our TV and all this stuff did we tell you to stay off our music why'd you pull us out of that now we're hearing I'm bored all the time but I got nothing to do why didn't you just let me die back there in the world why you preach this clotheslined religion why don't you just get off our back didn't we tell you to leave us alone the amazing thing about this is in the midst of all this God moved what a merciful God in the midst of their griping in the midst of their complaining God move surely this jogged their memory sure that's how God we're so sorry that'll never happen again it was a mistake sure twas they they messed up but God moved because of his goodness Exodus 15 23 and when they came tomorrow they could not drink of the waters of Marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called Marah and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink and God moved once again he moved in spite of the people and even like tabernacle may he never move in spite of us but may he move because we've invited him to move may he move because he feels welcome here may he move because we come here knowing what he's done knowing what he's gonna do and we begin to enter into worship we begin to give him our praise and we can say God it's been a rough week but I know who can fix that for me I've had a bad day but I know where I can cast my cares at this morning and then allow God to move not having move in spite of you but move because of you because you created an atmosphere and invite him into this place and say Lord God move upon my life Lord moving changed me change my attitude may the atmosphere around me affect others may we never get so cold and formal that a devil can rest on somebody and feel comfortable sitting next to you but may you soul enter in and so worship that the demons begin to feel uncomfortable and God can move and deal with hearts and the demons can be run out of this place and that can be victory in the house of God because we remember what God's done for us because we haven't forgot what he's done for us because he doesn't have to move around us and go home for us to make things happen how many times is he right there waiting to break forth across the audience but somebody's attitudes wrong and he has the whole back he's waiting to break forth and save a life but your attitudes wrong you've forgotten and it hinders the moving of the Spirit God forgive us of that we must remember exodus 16 - in the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and the children of Israel said and they would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we set by the fleshpots and when we did eat bread to the fool for you have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger then said the Lord unto Moses behold I will rain bread from heaven for you when God moved again God moved Exodus 17 3 and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said wherefore is this that thou has brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and God moved time after time we could go on on and on and on in their journey and every time God would move until God couldn't stand it anymore their forgetfulness and their ungratefulness eventually he just said that's enough his anger began to rise up within him and he had all that he could take and it tells us in numbers 11 verse 1 and when the people complained it displeased the Lord remember this this morning when you get into a tough spot and you begin to complain it displeased the Lord and the Lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the Lord burnt amongst them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp they're complaining caused the fire of God to come down and burn them up it consumed him they witnessed this with their own eyes they witnessed what happened when you complain and grumble and get outside the camp and leave the church and they sit there and watched as some walked away and their lives fell apart into shambles and it was an example to us Oh that'll never happen okay we're never gonna let that happen again and they forgot surely they won't forget now they just watch people burn alive because they were complaining they witnessed it numbers 14 1 and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them what God that we have died in the land of Egypt or what God we had died in the wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were not better for us to return to Egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return to Egypt until his Lord finally had enough and he's going to wipe the whole people off the face of the earth but in Moses we know he intercedes and we find in numbers 14 11 it says and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me how long will it be err they believe me for all the signs which have showed among them make this personal this morning for all the signs which I've showed among them I will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a great nation and mightier than they skip down to verse 20 says and the Lord said I have pardoned according to thy word but as truly as I live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of God because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness have tempted me now these 10 times and have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it forgetting God as a big deal forgetting his works is a big deal crying out and complaining and in the midst of all God has done for us God hates it to the point he said not one of them will enter into the promised land jesus said every one of them are dead and brother Brandon picked that up and said that means eternally separated from God every one of them eternally separated from God because they forget they were ungrateful they didn't remember the Lord they didn't remember his mighty works so finally the Lord cries out how long repeatedly time after time the Lord had demonstrated his faithfulness in every single situation however as soon as they would encounter another trial they would instantly forget the victory that they had just had they had seen enough in Egypt that if God never did another thing for them they should have never complained if they had been trapped at the Red Sea and he didn't move they still should have been able to praise him for the things that he did for them in Egypt not every single situation you face is gonna work out exactly the way you think it should he's not always just gonna wipe it away and let you walk through just perfectly there's times we go through battles but it's he that gives the victory don't complain about the fact you were in a battle rejoice because you've got the victory you're gonna fight battles that's part of the journey we're in and yet how quickly they forgotten Church I'm telling you today how much should we remember what God has done in our midst how victorious our lives ought to be how what overcomers we should be with all that God has done for us here at evening lights haver not going abroad around the world but I'm speaking to you this morning even light tabernacle the things we've witnessed in this building there's not a person in here that should ever doubt again there's not a person in here who has a right to complain ever again there's not anybody in here he's done enough in this congregation that we should always remember the Lord he's done enough in this congregation that we can lift our hands to him and praise Him and say Lord you are wonderful Lord you are mighty Lord you have been good to me Lord you saved my soul Lord I'm unworthy but you're worthy this morning and you deserve all the praise and honor you deserve me to remember you but sometimes in service I'm not saying anything ugly yo y'all forgive me but sometimes in service I see people who have forgotten sometimes when the praise and the worship is going forth then you look out across the faces you see people who have forgot you see people that forget that God deserves everything no matter what your day was like we see that people forget that we're praising a God who has given his everything and yet the praise that you're giving doesn't match what he deserves now I realize that no amount of praise could ever equal what he truly deserves but I believe we have an obligation to give them every single thing we have and if you can sit there today as I'm preaching this and you go you know what I agree with that and I'm not guilty because every service I'm ever in I sing with everything I have I respond with everything I have my mind stays focus with everything I have I hang on every word then that's what we're looking for but if you're sitting there today and you know I haven't given him everything in every service I haven't always gave my all then this morning we got to remember God's not fixing to come down and and consume you was fired this morning because you didn't sing in the song service I said please don't think that's what I'm telling you but we saw when they forgot God was merciful and God moved and I'm telling you he's merciful this morning but he wants you to remember he wants you to praise he wants you to give him every single thing that you can possibly give him Church if we truly remembered think about how we would worship if we truly remember think about all you would pour into it if you remember what you were and you remember what he's made you if you remember where you were going but now you know your destination in the future how can you not give him praise and you think about the times he healed you when you were sick he delivered you when you were bound how can you not give him praise this morning how can we forget where he's brought us from if you're saved then you can worship when you were set free you can worship and yet there's still many sitting there Wade by slave mentality you're not a slave anymore you've been set free but you're learning yourself to be held by broken chains we heard Wednesday that you shouldn't be held by broken chains but you're still sitting there and those chains are weighing you down and you haven't come to that realization that I'm free the devil doesn't have a hold on me anymore God has paid the price he's gone to prepare a place for me he's sending a rapture for me he's provided healing for me he's gonna save my children and if you really understand that if you really believe that there's no possible way you can sit in a service and not worship the king of kings and the Lord of lords it would be impossible it's not possible to be a believer and sit in church and not worship it is impossible it is impossible well I don't worship you're not a believer you got to remember that you're free this morning you got to remember everything he's done for you and you got to remember he deserves your praise you got to remember that you saw your taskmasters floating in the Red Sea remember that you saw them floating in the Red Sea or have you forgotten why can't you worship why are you not content in life as the scripture tells us to be is he not enough has he not blessed you enough has he not done enough oh lord I know you've forgiven my sins I know you've done so much for me I know you healed me I know you delivered me but things are tough right now really I know you've done so much for me Lord but we're struggling financially I know you've done so much for me but I'm down about where my life is and the prospects of my life I'm down because I thought my life would be better than this it is very provoking to God to undervalue the things he gives you it is very provoking to God to undervalue his blessings and the things he has poured out upon your life to undervalue His mercies and undervalue his provision provisions well I only have this and we only have that and I'm in this situation and I only have this ok Israel we only have manna we only have this look angels food wasn't good enough for them either what does he have to do to be good enough for you what does he have to do I say he doesn't have to do another thing I say he's poured out his blessings more than enough I say if he never did anything else after Calvary he's done more than enough for you that you can praise Him through all eternity but you got to remember what he did for you you cannot forget Israel said yeah well I wish we had meat I wish we had fishing garlic Israel have you forgotten brother Brown says it's fine that God has so fixed this earth that we can all be happy if we would just try to be that way we can all be happy if we would just try to be that way so I'm just gonna take what he said and say so if you're not happy you're not try if we would try to be that way live happily and be thankful to him for what we have I'm quite sure that one of the great faults with us is that we're not grateful enough for what we have he has been so good to us to give us so many things and we just don't seem to appreciate it as much as we should see grumbling and thankless Nizar not a response to your circumstance if you grumble and complain you're not grumbling and complaining to your circumstance you're grumbling and complaining to God understand that grumbling and complaining is not a response to your circumstance it is a complaint to God Israel grumbled when they were slaves Israel grumbled when Moses showed up Israel murmured and grumbled on the way to the promised land see the grumbling was in their heart it had nothing to do with their surroundings it had nothing to do with their current situation because it didn't matter what situation you found them in they were complaining they were grumbling they were upset so it had nothing to do with the current situation the complaint in the grumbling is in your heart because you don't recognize what God has done for you you don't remember how good he is so nothing's ever quite good enough and there's always a grumble and there's always a complain your attitude towards God should not be rooted in a bank account it should not be rooted in your current health condition it should not be rooted in your current state of affairs it should not be rooted in your job condition because just as grumbling is a reflection of your heart so as a life filled with praise a reflection of your heart so today my attitude towards God it's not on my bank account not on my job situation but my attitude towards God is because I remember what God has done for me my heart cries out Lord you are worthy of my praise I may be sick today but you're worthy of my praise I lost my job today you're worthy of my praise my children are sick Lord you're worthy of my praise because I remember I was lost I was bound for hell you came to Calvary and your precious blood I will remember today Lord Jesus I will praise the king of kings I will lift up the name above names because you're worthy regardless of my circumstance and that's a reflection of the heart because he sits there and I can't keep quiet I can't not praise him but look at Joe look at Jobe you have not had a day quite like job but he praised him anyhow and when people just said curse God and I said you speak as a foolish woman his circumstances never determined his attitude because it's a reflection of your heart we are to remember I don't want to believe there's anybody sitting here today that's lost I don't believe it I know there's three kinds of believers but I choose to believe each and every one of you will be there it's up to you and the Lord to work that out I choose to believe that we're believers I don't believe there's anybody here lost so if you're saved and if you're free then you know what happened in your life then how can you not give every single moment in a church service everything you've got why are you harping on church services well I'll put it to you like this I know it's not supposed to be just in church it's supposed to be every day your life but if you're not giving it your all for an hour and a half on Wednesday and a couple hours on Sunday I don't even got worried about what's going on the rest of the week if you're not giving it your all on Wednesday and Sunday I don't even got worried about what you're doing the rest of the week because you definitely ain't giving it your all if you can come in and sit down on God when his presence is moving I know you sit down on him when you're all alone and you can't feeling when works hard and when your minds off him I know you're not giving it if you can't pour it out in this atmosphere if you can't pour it out when he's moving amongst his people then I'm not even giving thought to what goes on the rest of the week if you're saved how can you not praise Him how can you not give him everything when he's given everything for you if you can't praise him it's because you've forgotten and I want to challenge you this morning to remember don't walk away and say brother Aaron said I'm lost I'm not saying that I'm telling you to remember this morning shake your memory shake your consciousness look back at what God has done when you see he's always been faithful then look ahead to the other promises and go I know he'll be faithful there and because he's faithful he deserves my praise God hates his works to be forgotten forgetfulness brings lukewarmness forgetfulness brings death and he hates for his works to be forgotten and he hates it also when they become common to us they should never become common to us and and he has constantly reminded Israel of his deliverance telling them to rehearse it and teach their children teach their children exodus 13 and 3 and moses said unto the people remember this day in which you came out from Egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand and the Lord brought you out from this place remember this day Deuteronomy 15 and excuse me fit 5 and 15 and remember that that was a servant in the land of Egypt and that the LORD thy God brought the out thence through a mighty hand and by stretched out arm and then he implements feast and and celebrations and all of them are with the purpose of remembering every single thing that he implements for the children admitted Israel is for the purpose of remembering an event so that they would never forget because look God understands there's one place in Psalm 78 where he goes on and on and on about how awful they've been and then it says in the middle there but he remembered that they were just flesh as human beings we have times where we forget we have times where we get distracted it says he didn't destroy them because he remembered they were flesh he remembered that they were humans so he's constantly reminding it and in the sabbatical year which in every seven years they would make a release that's in Deuteronomy 1515 it says and thou shalt remember that thou was abundant in the land of Egypt and the LORD thy God redeemed thee therefore I command thee this thing today feast of weeks Deuteronomy 16 and 12 and thou shalt remember that that was a bondman in Egypt Deuteronomy 24 18 but thou shalt remember that I was a bond man in Egypt and the Lord that God redeemed these ends Deuteronomy 24 22 and thou shalt remember that that was a bondman in the land of Egypt and you're thinking look I thought we were supposed to forget that we were slaves why is he constantly reminding them I delivered you you were bondsman you were slaves the reason he constantly is reminding them of that is they began to look back at Egypt as if it was something Pleasant they began to look back at Egypt and say Egypt was good Egypt has this and he's constantly having a Tim don't you remember you were slaves don't you remember that you were a bondsman don't you remember you're remembering the wrong things and you're forgetting the wrong things you need to forget what needs to be forgotten and remember what needs to be remembered you were slaves you were beat you were worked every single day you had no time for God and yet you're looking back going we ain't freely you did nothing freely you gave your backs to Pharaoh Satan with a terrible torment or a terrible taskmaster do not look back and say oh it was good you were slaves he says constantly reminding them I set you free I set you free because otherwise they would forget they were always forgetting and looking back with fondness numbers eleven five we remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic but now our soul now that we're in this message is dried away there's nothing at all besides this manner before our eyes notice here how they remember and what they forgotten they forgotten the whips on their back they forgotten their children were being murdered their women were being ravished when we complain and look back have we forgotten how evil the world was to us have we forgotten what an evil taskmaster Satan was in our lives have we forgotten what he did to our families have you forgotten what he's done to your children when we look backwards have we forgotten what a sacrifice Jesus paid at Calvary so that we could come out of that look it's okay to remember it's not okay to look bad because a memory is I'm still walking forward doesn't show a longing in my heart but if I stop and I look back remember Lot's wife if you're wanting to look back this morning repent and remember what God has done for you repent and remember what he's done don't forget that the taskmaster upon you don't forget your slavery to drugs and alcohol and things of that nature you look back you say you know what I had a pretty good time with my friends I did it here looking at it with fondness or at least you're not looking at it with the hatred and the disgust that you should be looking at it with it should be a part of our lives that we don't want anything of except to remember my God is good the only reason I remember is because I say God you saved me the only reason I even remember it is I can say Lord Jesus thank you so much that when I was lost and undone when I was on my way to a sinner's grave in a devil's hell you cared enough about me to reach down and save me when I wasn't even looking for you and I remember it this morning and I'll praise you for it this morning no matter where I found myself at today I'm not there no matter where you find yourself at today you're not back there you're not still stuck in Egypt you may be in the middle of a battle but you're on your way to the promised land I'm willing to fight any battle on my way to the promised land remember where you are remember where you're going and forget the things in the past forget those things and press on we begin to say well maybe it wasn't really so bad yes it was bad we almost remember it was almost as a pleasantry have you forgotten the stripes of your taskmaster and maybe you don't want to go back maybe you recognize that you're free but if you brought some things of Egypt along with you God was angry that they were lusting for Egyptian food he was angry that even despite what they get he gave he gave the manna that they were lusting for the Egyptian food says his mana not enough is the revealed word and this I were not enough for you brother branham says I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the presence of God is it not enough as the open seven seals not enough that we have to look back and look for other things is it such a boring thing that we have to cram entertainment down our face at all times to where it consumes us are you that bored with what God has done he's opened the word in this day never forget what went in the Ministry of Malachi for never forget what he's done for you in this last day never forget the signs and the wonders and the healings and not only that they were done back there you know I think brother Brannon would be ashamed and upset if he'd thought that people believed it was only to be done in his ministry that thing where that was that gift was demonstrated before us to show us that the pillar of fire had returned to the church you never forget that the pillar of fire is still with you today never forget that he's in this building to do the same things that he's always done never forget that he's here to deliver you out of whatever situation you're in because he's done it before he'll do it again never forget these things have we forgotten that we were slaves have we forgotten that we were lost have you forgotten that you've been set free never forget it's kind of our thing the enemy wants you to forget the slavery he wants you to forget the stripes he wants you to forget the bondage you know there's those in the world today trying to claim that the Holocaust didn't even happen or trying to claim that it wasn't as bad as they say it was but the people in Israel say no no we will never forget everywhere you go there's memorials about it everywhere you go there's signs everywhere you go they're talking about it as I say we will never forget because they recognize that if you ever forget how bad it was you don't even have to forget that it happened but if you begin to think maybe it wasn't so bad if you begin to think it wasn't as bad as the others say it was then you're doomed to begin to repeat that process when we begin to forget where we came from we're doomed to repeat it we cannot forget what it was that God saved us from yes it was that bad yes the life of sin was that evil I was on my way to hell I don't care where you were you were on your way to hell I'd say that's pretty bad well I didn't live as bad as others you were on your way to hell I'd say that's pretty bad so wherever you are today at least you're not on your way to hell so you ought to be able to give him your everything give him your all every time there's an opportunity to remember and an opportunity to praise some maybe look backwards today even at the denominations and the things that they came out of and they begin to try to bring denominational ideas into this message because in their mind it wasn't that bad yes it was that bad there was no freedom in those camps the church system was that bad that's why God called you out of it it wasn't a reformation this time this time he said it is that bad get out of her my people because there's going to be plagues fall upon her that Roman system it tortured millions and killed millions of your brothers and sisters how can we forget that it was that bad it is that bad we must remember them we must remember the stand that they took in their day don't let those things just become something you talk about we must not forget the rugged soldiers of the past that have gone home the pastor's that stood the men who stood in circumstances way worse than what we stand in hiding in houses and basements and caves hiding here and there standing for the word we must remember the men of the great revivals gone past you had Luther and the great Reformation and Edwards in Whitefield and the first Great Awakening and then then you have Finney and Spurgeon and different ones like that down to men women children who still we can't forget them they're invested in what you do today they're invested men and women who were tortured to death and would not recount children burned at the stake and torture and they would not recap they would not recant they would even praise God right up to the point of their death many of them even preach in to the ones that were killed I'll tell him you can be saved they wouldn't stop but I can't praise God this Sunday because I had a bad week and they would sit there with their stomachs ripped apart hands tied back burning going I love you Jesus thank you lord thank you for this opportunity to give my life for you but I had a bad week how can one be so callous and how can we forget so easily we expect it to be a flowery bed of ease you must remember it's a war today you must remember it's a battle you must remember they're watching you even today those that gave their life or watching even today because they without you cannot be made perfect they are counting on your success they are invested in your success that watch it go and don't forget don't forget we laid our lives down today don't forget remember what he's done for you don't forget Preston battle they told brother Branham there they said press the battle press the battle you don't don't forget what's at the end of the road they're invested in what you and I do and we cannot forget this morning God have mercy on us for how easy we had it I will not forget when that same spirit that ruled those denominations and that Romans spirit that put all those people together to death begins to try to come back in the church denominational spirits try to come into the message church and once again take rule over God's people we will not forget we will not stand by and let the devils of cold dark formalism begin to come back into our services when they're trying to push out the leadership of the Spirit trying to push out the moving on the Holy Spirit I will not forget I will not forget what Malachi 4 was sent to to turn our hearts back to don't forget what you were restored to you were not restored back to the word the original word at Pentecost so you can sit on a Pew and think about tomorrow or sit on a Pew and think about what you did yesterday he didn't go through all the trouble of sending you malachi for behold i'll send on to you malachi for and you go have you forgot that he's opened the seals has he forgot that he allows you to see your name i will not sit by idly and allow us to go back to cold formal church services do not take our church services for granted do not take the moving of the spirit for granted do not forget what he's told us back to well people are wondering why are people leaving the church why are people leaving the message why our family's falling apart they forgot what we were restored to they'd forgotten and they became cold and formal and mechanical and mechanical and it holds no one don't forget what we have to have in this day to overcome he wants to rob the life take the moving on the spirit but we won't forget brother Brown says the riches about blessings may rest upon this people and may they go from here this day filled with the Holy Ghost may they live from hereafter Lord filled with your spirit may they never forget this that they're contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints you're contending for the faith it was once lost but it's been put back in your hands what are you going to do with it what will you do now that it's in your hands and it's your race to run we must remember and if we remember then we can praise Him not just on Wednesdays not just on Sunday but when we do come together on those Wednesdays and Sundays you can just pour it all out you can let it all go you can remember how he healed me you can remember how he saved me you can remember how he delivered me and then if you can remember there's nothing that will keep you from singing and there's nothing that will keep you from shout and there's nothing that will keep you from pulling on the word because you remember what he's done remembering brings worshiped remembering always brings worship but when we forget we often see it reflect in our praise not only in service but the praise that our life gives off each and every day we see it affect the dedication we have to the house of God those that remember are dedicated to the house of God those who have forgotten hey we'll see maybe maybe not you've forgotten what he did for you you don't remember those who have forgotten see it affect their dedication to prayer but our praise reflects our remembrance brother Branham would say it's been my great mystery in my life of all things that he wondered about he said this is my great mystery how can the Scriptures be so plain and the people set there and know that the Spirit of Christ is in the room now he's talking about where he says where two or three guy that I'll be there in the midst of you this is the great mystery - brother Branham how can you know the scripture so plain and know that the Spirit of Christ is in the room and can hold your peace I can't understand it unless their eyes are not open think about it it becomes common to us but Jesus Christ is in this room and because you don't see his flesh you think you can take the service off or go halfway in your heart ask yourself this if he was standing here in the flesh if he appeared here in the flesh would you have acted the exact same way in the service that you've acted today and I'm not getting on to y'all been wonderful I'm just asking you a question would it have been exactly the same would you as saying exactly the same with him standing here pouring the worship on him I think not I think not for myself at least I'll speak for myself I think not for me how can you believe that the Spirit of Christ is in the room and hold your peace when I realized that he took my place through a divine exchange I can't hold my peace when I realized that I was gonna die and go to hell I can't hold my peace when I realized he's healed in my body I can't hold my peace when I realized that he pulled us out of denominations I can't hold my peace when I realized he's never failed I can't hold my peace when I realized that he's coming very very soon brother Branham said I can hear the ticking of the clock and I can I can see the angel getting ready to proclaim no more it's right here I can't hold my peace it excites me to know that it's almost over it excites me to know that I'm fitting to go home it excites me to know that he's in our building in this place every time we worship it excites me to know that he goes home with me he rides in the car with me it excites me to know that he's never left me and never forsaken me that's enough this morning I can say I am not forsaken thank you Jesus thank you Jesus I'm not forsaken [Applause] it's enough to shout about thank you Lord Jesus how can I not praise your brother Brown says and when the church gets to the place where that Christ means so much to us that we thirst to get in his presence we thirst you know what it is to be thirsty you gotta have so you gotta have it your mouth parched you got to have it that's how it should be on Sunday and Wednesday I gotta get there I got to get there I got to get there and worship he says when you're that thirsty to get in his presence and get with each other Wow the gathering together is important why have church just at home by myself that's not very important that I gather with people what the Prophet said it was the scripture said it was that's good enough for me gather with each other it's a life-giving resource no devil can ever overtake you and in doing so we remember Christ was the one who made it possible for us he was the one who did these things for us we must remember him for remember once you was aliens and without God Gentiles carried away with dumb idols but remember Christ died not for the Jew but for every creature of Adam's fallen race Christ died can we remember that this morning Jesus died for me what else do I need he died for me he saved me he redeemed me his blood is sufficient this morning I remember Lord Jesus the things you took I want me remember that beating you took the stripes you took that were supposed to be for my back the cat of nine tails would just rip the flesh out Lord I remember they took the thorns and they smashed it deep down in his head Lord I remember I haven't forgotten it was for me Lord I'm gonna praise you this morning because of it there may be a thousand other things you can praise him for but I know you can at least find one and you can look to Calgary this morning and say it was for me but I praise you today because it was roomy I remember Lord Jesus let us never forget but Satan's designed this world to make you forget he knows that man has a problem remembering even the disciples did this with Jesus his story it's amazing to me in Matthew 16 5 it says and when his disciples were come to the other side they had forgotten to take bread then said Jesus under them now he's teaching them something here a doctrinal thing and he says take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees now because their carnal mind did and they're hungry and they've forgotten to bring bread they say and they reasoned among themselves saying is it because we forgot to bring bread is that what's going on here we didn't bring bread so he's talking about leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees which when Jesus perceived he said unto them o ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because you brought no bread do you not understand neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets you took up the story continues and another it's also told in mark 8 18 he says having eyes see you not in having ears hear you not and do you not remember and when I break the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took you up I can see them kind of being sheepish now because they're probably not feeling real bright at the moment and they said twelve and he says and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of fragments took you up they said seven now I'm sure and I don't mean the sacrilegious but I'm sure Jesus didn't talk the way we talk but I also look at it and realized the disciples were his friends and and I have to imagine he was human and he talked to him like friends I have to imagine he said and you're worried about bread really with all this going on you're worried about bread I just fed 5,000 with five loaves and then four thousand with seven loaves and y'all are worried about bread are you kidding me in some ways how frustrating it must have been to him this just happened and they're going I ain't got no bread and he's trying to teach him a doctor and they going I think he's talking about bread cuz we can bring that can you imagine he says worry about bread remember what I did last time and even like timer talk I want to tell you don't worry about that sickness that's trying to attack you don't you remember what he did last time I tried to come don't worry about that depression that's trying to come on you don't you remember how you restored the joy last time it came don't you remember don't worry about your finances that you're in the move out you remember how you blessed you financially last time can't you look down through scriptures and see what he did last time he says you're worried about sickness didn't I promise that by my stripes you're healed in this very Church haven't I defeated cancer heaven undefeated alopecia haven't I healed kidneys how can I've done these things time and time and time again and you're worried about this are you serious don't you remember you're worried about bread don't you remember what happened last time we were in this situation don't be like Israel and you come to this and go oh no what do you just do yesterday honi get you through it all praise God yourself Oh No what do you just do yesterday and you're worried about bread you're worried about things that he's proven Tom and Tom and Tom and Tom again that he's going to take care of so next time you hit that situation cry for the Lord go thank you Jesus cuz I know I'm gonna be victorious cuz I remember what you did last time I know what you're gonna do this time I remember thank you Jesus don't forget this morning but remember don't be worried about bread remember all that he's done for you haven't you seen me deliver enough to know that I'm gonna do it again didn't I promise to heal you forget not all his benefits he paid for them with his blood he died for them he was beat with them beyond anything you can possibly imagine and then we just so easily forget him that's why I said forget not my benefits don't forget them they're precious they're bought with the price don't let them go by the wayside don't complain don't gripe don't forget please remember remember all my benefits it calls me alive it cost me everything remember them this morning everything that I promised you when you're in need of deliverance don't panic don't fret don't complain just remember he is my deliverer when you need a job just remember he is my provider when we need healing just remember he is my healer brother branham tells this lady that little cysts want hurt you you know that don't you you know that it won't hurt you and your worries that you got on your heart it won't hurt you but you must remember that God is your healer look we've seen the miracles we've heard the word for years but have we forgotten you say brother brother I hadn't forgotten I remember all those things if you ask the children of Israel they would have told you they hadn't forgotten as well because they could still recite it they could tell you all about it but their life and their actions proved otherwise their words said in one point they said they remember that he was their rock and in some sending out and cried out to him he said but they were just giving him lip service they were a line they really didn't remember you say but there and I haven't forgot I can remember I can tell you about sister Elena I can tell you about the day he saved me I can tell you and then the worship goes forth this song again you forgotten the children of Israel would tell you they hadn't forgotten but God looked at him and said they'd forgotten me and it enraged him and it made him angry and they would say we loved Lord he'd say they'd forgotten me even in light Tabernacle we must remember this morning first Chronicles 16 and 12 I'm trying to hurry remember his marvelous works that he had done his wonders in the judgments of his mouth the marvelous works of God cannot become common to us as I mentioned earlier we cannot take his presence for granted there is nothing that can replace the presence of Almighty God there is nothing like it when he moved down in a service I've said it many times I've said it to friends I said there's nothing like that in the world I've experienced a lot of things in the world things I wish I had not experienced and yet I can tell you this there is nothing like the presence of God there is nothing that can compare to the presence of mamani God and his works are so wonderful and he's gone to such great lengths to make sure that we didn't miss it he sent Malachi four hundred thousands upon thousands times thousands of miracles opened the seal signs and wonders to make sure you wouldn't miss it he over vindicated it to the point that you cannot miss it unless you just choose to walk away from it to ensure that it was so overly vindicated that you would have absolutely no doubt and as a people that are accustomed to the supernatural that have heard about the supernatural your whole life that is witnessed the supernatural God hates it when it becomes common God hates it when we don't look at it and realize how precious it is how wonderful it is how mighty his brother branham says you've seen the Lord God manifests himself and do the things that he said he would do until it's become so common there's no more thrill to it God shake us tonight God is so good to you people and you people who are full gospel and believe all the Bible God has done so many miracles and done so many things for you he's been so good and you don't recognize it wake up open your eyes he's standing he's knocking trying to get in to control you to make you what you should be to take away the world from you and to make you new creatures of his that's why he gives you these things that he has given you and then he goes and he tells the story about the young man walking down to the seashore and he was so excited to go down to the seashore he wanted to see the waves leaping and the Whitecaps and the seagulls and smelled the sea salt he was excited to go you remember when you were excited to come to the house of God like that I can't wait to see what God's gonna do today I can't wait to see him move I love it when I'm hanging out with people or just sitting around on Saturday and you hear somebody say man I can't wait for church tomorrow I love that I can't wait to get into service tomorrow I'm looking forward to the service tomorrow and he's walking down to the sea and he meets an old sailor he says where are you going I'm going down to the sea it's gonna be wonderful I can't wait to see these things I can't wait to smell this and and and the sailor says I was borned on the sea I've been there for 40 years there isn't nothing thrilling about it that I can see he'd seen it so much till it become common to me when it gets to the point that you aren't excited to see what's gonna happen in church on Sunday and you aren't excited to see what's gonna happen in church on Wednesday it's become common to you it's gotten to the point where it doesn't throw your heart anymore brother Brown says your fathers and mothers rejoice when God had been to pour out his Spirit upon the church and sometimes today I think we can say your young people and your sons and daughters are rejoicing when they get to come to church how about you older folks how about you get with it sometimes we have a wonderful group of people I'm not piling on anybody I'm just saying let's all get in it together let's all move together let's all push together we have one common goal we have one thing and calling and our purpose is to leave here in a rapture don't forget what you're here for and when you come to the house of God recognize there may be people that aren't as far long as you and they need a touch and you may be just fine but you say I'm going to create an atmosphere so that person can be blessed so that person can be saved so that person can be healed Lord I'm going to give you my all this morning don't forget why we're here he goes on in that story and he says and now he says what about you Assemblies of God why you stood on the corner a little tambourine and everything else you would have died for the cause and now you won't walk across the street for the cause what happened you did run well what hindered you it's because it's common to you you believe it all sure you do but it doesn't thrill you anymore it's so common God's so good to you and you don't realize it he says you've seen him open the eyes of the blind and some of y'all wouldn't walk across the street to see it again you've seen him heal the sick you've seen him perform miracles you've done all this and it's so common it doesn't thrill you anymore Church please don't let our services become common don't get to the point when the spirit moves you sit there and go oh yeah she gets exciting all the time somebody breaks forth in a blessing again oh yeah that's about third time this month well you know if you were the one getting touched and getting excited to enter in you wouldn't know about it because it would be you getting blessed it would be you getting touched it would be you giving your all at the very least you know what I understand full well you've heard brother Joe say this before we're not all going to act the same I totally understand that but there ain't a one of us who should be able to sit there with our mouths closed and our hands down and a stone face and a church service I don't care what your personality is I don't care what your makeup is God's done enough for you that you can at least say hallelujah thank you Jesus God's done enough for you that you can at least sing the songs I've done enough for you that you can't least clap your hands you don't got to run around this church but when I do I don't need you to be critical I need you to say praise God he's getting the blood soon this morning I'm thankful he's getting a blessing this morning and when you tuck off and when you dance and when you shut I'm gonna say praise God they're getting the blessing praise God they got a blessing but we can all do something because he's done so much for us don't let these services become common it should excite us every single time when God moves he wants us to remember him in our services he wants us to remember him in our life and he wants us to give Him praise he wants our praise he wants our praise he wants our worship you say but I'm not made that way he wants your praise I don't feel like it today he wants your praise but I had a bad week I said he wants your praise you cannot forget listen he's looking for somebody in this day and I believe there's a people in the face of the earth who will remember he's looking for somebody to remember somebody who recognizes that it's a miracle that I'm even sitting in this building this morning somebody who recognized that should have been dead a long time ago but here I am somebody who is lost but now they're found somebody who is on their way to hell but now they're on their way to a rapture and they praise Him they praise Him when they had a bad day they praise Him when they had a good day they praise Him when things go bad they praise Him when things go wrong they praise him no matter what he's looking for somebody that has not forgotten somebody that'll worship brother brands his oh brother I wonder if the warriors today are willing to cut their way through formalism doubts and unbelief to refresh the presence of the Lord he was telling the story of David and the soldiers I went to get him a drink he says is there somebody here that will give the Lord a drink a fresh drink of their praise a good fresh offering of praise and worship he says the least of his desires if it's Africa India if it's the street the least of your desires Lord is my command death don't mean a thing to me popularity don't mean nothing me what I am what I will be means nothing Lord is to fulfill your desires that's the Warriors that standing by the side of him if they call me a Holy Roller if my name is scandalize if they kick me in the street that doesn't matter your desire is my command that's a real soldier I say it's time for evening light Tabernacle to remember this morning I say it's time to forget what you should forget and remember what needs to be remembered brother branham goes on to say if you've seen God provide and do a miracle then can't he do a miracle again see in other words like this if he saved you from sin can he not heal your body don't you remember when you as a sinner how he lifted up your soul and faith to believe can't he likewise do something great for you again can't he can't he do a miracle or something else for you the five baskets remember when they crossed over the Red Sea God opened the way like that made the Red Sea open and walked through he come right on the other side and as soon as they didn't have water they started murmuring as soon as they got without bread they started crying we don't have no bread didn't you consider the miracle back there at the Red Sea have you not come down when they got all in a spot by the Red Sea they said oh we ought to have died here comes the Egyptians on us now here it is what are we going to do he said who smote the earth with plagues down there who kept the sun shining in Goshen see we must remember those things remember God is God any of it he's still God he certainly can do anything remember this morning remember this morning God is God for your situation God is God for what you faced tomorrow God is God for your lost children God is God for your loss husband God is God you say well I'm logged in from this promise I can't get it didn't remember Jericho you say my children are lost out there then remember the prodigal son you say my loved ones too far gone remember Legion this morning remember the works of old and remember that God is God this morning who wants to remember this morning I'm gonna remember this morning Lord that I'm your child first John 3:2 beloved now we are the sons of God I remember today Lord that I'm forgiven by your precious blood I remember Lord that you said I'll never leave you or forsake you he told me a devil told me that I was no good now I was unworthy but I remember this morning Lord that you said you chose me to be a people for his treasured possession but I remembered that you loved me when I was unlovable I remember today that all your promises are true there's victory in remembrance Nehemiah 14 for says and I looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brothers your sons your daughters your wives and your houses for their and I'm surrounded today forget about them remember the Lord for he is terrible no he's not terrible to you but to your enemies and he says and fight for your brothers fight for your sons fight for your daughters fight for your wives and fight for your houses you want victory this morning remember the Lord Jonah and the belly of the whale said I remembered the Lord and when he did the whale had to bring and spit him out on dry land thousands of men forgot who they were but David remembered and it brought victory against Goliath gar forgot for years and years and years who he was but when he remembered who he was it brought victory there's victory this morning in remembrance listen even if you were in the enemy's prison this morning and I'm bringing this to a close even if you forgot him I promise he has not forgotten you maybe you used to be victorious maybe you used to remember brother branham said that Samson actually won battles because he remembered he was seed of Abraham he would get in a bad situation there'll be nothing around he'd say I'm seed of Abraham and he just reached down and pick up that jaw bone and faith he says but then he forgot that he was seed of Abraham by birth brother Branham says he says he forgot he was seed of Abraham by birth and then brother brown just says I'd remember I'd remember he's telling you it's important if I were you I'd remember this morning maybe you've lost your joy I'm just bringing this down to you maybe you've lost your peace maybe you've lost your praise maybe you've lost your victory and when I'm asked me to do this morning us begin to remember remember who saved you remember who healed you remembered who delivered you remember he is mighty in battle remember your enemy is a defeated foe remember that my God has conquered death hell and the grave I remember Lord though what I remember your faith to begin to build if you dwell on those things and remember brother Brandon says skipping them all this to get to the end he says let us remember you made the promise you were the ones that's responsible for this promise let us remember no matter what anyone else says you were the one you were the one that we're looking to fulfill your promise you're the one that said if he believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die member you said that Lord and when you said those who did believe in you now you said if we believed we had eternal life and you said those that did believe in you the works that you did they would do also now father we know that you are God and we know that there is none other but you and we believe you and we are trusting you now in the name of Jesus Christ now with our heads bowed how many in this building that knows that you're not remembering your Lord in the way that you should remember him and at the end of this little chopped-up message you're willing to raise your hand up and say god make yourself real to me till I remember you till I remember your Commandments till they be upon my bedpost I put the Lord always before me as David said Lord give me more of you that I can remember you bow your heads together with me please Psalms 20 and verse 5 says we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we will set up our banners the Lord fulfill all the petitions now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven and the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord our God they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright I wonder how many of us have forgotten I want to ask you now with every head bowed and every eye closed I'm not asking you to come to the altar and ask for forgiveness I'm just asking how many would raise a hand like brother Browne said say lord help me to remember helped me to remember everything you've done for me Lord help me to remember your goodness help me to remember to praise you regardless of my circumstance you know no wonder remembering is such a central theme throughout the scripture God knows our mind is drawn to forgetfulness and he wants us to remember what he has done and when we remember then we can praise Him when we remember we can have victory churches should never be a service that we don't praise Him with everything we got the day you had doesn't matter the week you had doesn't matter because if you remember the reality of what God has done for you it's so far outweighs anything you're going through think of the exchange that he made for you think of the trade he made for you have we forgotten right now I want each and every one of us to think back every one of us can go to this place think back and remember a time that God moved for you can we all go there right now to a place where God moved for you to when God touched your life and I guarantee you there's not one person sitting here that doesn't have something to thank him for there's no one here who hasn't been touched in some way by the hand of God he's worthy to be praised Lord Jesus we love you Lord you've done so very much for us Lord Jesus how could we forget you how can we forget the sacrifice Lord God at Calvary how can we forget Lord God all that you've done Lord the cry of my heart all week has been I will remember Lord I'll never forget but I'll remember Lord what you did nor what at Calvary what you did Lord's sending a message in this day what you did oh it's saving me Lord God filling me with your spirit or God turning my life around a life that was rotten and unworthy and in shambles Lord but you saved me how could I forget Lord God I remember today you're worthy to be praised the Lord know what I remember that you're gonna deliver me what I remember that you said when my enemies come upon me they're gonna stumble and fall but I remember you made a promise that you've gone to prepare a place for me and we're gonna press the battle this morning Lord because we remember Lord we love you with all our heart you saw the hands go up across this congregation I pray that Joe does
