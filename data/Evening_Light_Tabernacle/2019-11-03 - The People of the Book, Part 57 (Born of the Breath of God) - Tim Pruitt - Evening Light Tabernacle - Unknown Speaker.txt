I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance and he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner for he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire Amen may God bless you as you have your seats today a man

families here we welcome want to welcome them today just so happy they could come over from Georgia away and be with us and may the Lord just reveal to them the mystery of his will as they're seeking his will as well you hear me sigh I I've um this week has been quite a week as we just got one report after another of many saints that have gone home to be with the Lord sister Benton's which is brother Jackie Benton's wife passed away and they planted her as a seed into the ground waiting for a resurrection and there's been many many others that I could name that and some that I don't know very well but just hearing their names called and and whatever the different prayer requests that have come in for us to pray for those that are struggling with needs several deaths up in Tennessee and several deaths up in the UM Cloverdale area several deaths in Virginia and so on different ones that we've heard about this week and also one of our minister brothers from Belgium brother Guiteau van Bronk has just passed away you know his going home didn't make me feel real well he was only two years older than me so you know as he he left he just just kind of had his last notes you know that he on his desk and it was wrote a new body and so you know that's what he was looking forward to was a new body and just once wasn't so much sick he just come off of some mission trips and shared with us about that Saten it was like he sat down on the stairwell laid his head down on his shoulder and went home a man so but back in August brother Ron Spencer had a meeting there in the North Carolina meetings and they were not intending a prayer line that night they just had mass prayer for everybody because there are many many needs and and so he stepped behind the curtain of the stage there in the auditorium were they were having the meetings and someone came from prayer and then another came for prayer and another coming from prayer brother Guido come running up and the Lord just spoken and and told him trouble lays just ahead the train is coming for you but it'll be okay to go and now less than six weeks later two months later he's gone to be with the Lord God knows exactly our our date of birth and the time that he wants to take us home amen but there's no such thing as death for a Christian you just changed dwelling places amen so you know we want to thank the Lord for those words of comfort as as it was spoken trouble lays just ahead the Train is coming for you it'll be okay to go and that's why we want it when it comes our time to go we want to know it's okay to go any man but we're looking for the coming of the Lord the rapture of the church we want to thank God that there are gifts that lay in the body gifts of healing give some miracles gifts of discerning of spirits gifts of words of knowledge that are given to us now none of these take brother branham's place or our even duplicate the Ministry of Jesus Christ that was displayed through that particular ministry that did what Jesus did none of these are intended to impersonate or to take their place they are just gifts that lays in the body a man that we believe that and you know it's just like the gift of faith are some people have great faith just and claim the promises of God and and gifts of healing give some miracles all of these things lay in the body of Christ they all come because of what Jesus did for us at Calvary and were born into that body I just just wanted to share with you a little testimony they come in you know the the other Sunday we prayed for a little sister who her husband had a typhoid type fever that the doctor said and their little two-year-old about two year old son was also come down with the fever and and you know we had sent a prayer cloth here some time ago and and to her because she has cancer and and so she'd been taking chemotherapy and and so on and and she you know asked for prayer so we sent her prayer cloths and I just told her to take that prayer cloth and go lay it on her husband and her child and while the husband went to work the next morning and the child it was healed and running around and without a fever and I told God is still God and the answers prayer no matter what it is but she just shared with me and I just want to share a part of this that when the she said when the prayer cloth reached me I just finished my fifth chemo and came home I held on to it and prayed and claimed my healing what I didn't tell you was usually after my chemo I cannot eat or drink I'd be tired and in pain it takes almost two to three weeks to feel well and mouth ulcers to go away and the last three to four days I can eat a little better but this time it was different I ate normal food from days 7 itself I wasn't feeling fatigue and no mouth ulcers in fact I was even in the the cooking in the kitchen running around after my son and even my blood work was normal unlike before and the doctor said if it goes down I might need a transfusion but it never went down it only went up and after my six chemo I was able to eat normal food and within four days I forgot I'd went through chemo I was surprised myself I was eating normal being normal active I'm sorry I didn't tell you but I I didn't have time to sit and write with much my son running around and I was so caught up enjoying and sharing the Fall Meeting messages it's a blessing with my family and friends and I shared that link to all my contacts so they could have a revival to amen but I'm healed sir and no in fact I'm demanded my husband we should stop the radiation because it ain't required anymore our radiation is from the Lord amen these folks regularly listen in from India and and so we're just want to greet you today in the name of the Lord and the bright around the world wherever you're assembled and our being with us it was something just more that I I wanted to share about that if I could because I didn't read you this whole thing but she just one doesn't you see said God bless your congregation - said I really love them the love they have the atmosphere that they create takes us more into his presence so it's really really important about the atmosphere you create remember when you come together we're not playing Church we are here to come in the presence of God and worship Him with all of our hearts and just let the Holy Spirit move in our lives and you know you don't ever want to be destructive or or whatever you know just sit patiently and stay in tune and do your part to pull on the gift of God because it's affecting somebody around the world that may mean the difference for their healing or their deliverance so I wanted just to bring that to your memory to your attention today Matthew chapter 13 verse 24 we want to read from as we look into the Word of God today Matthew 13 and verse 24 will you just read this together with me if you'll open your Bibles there and another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit there appeared also the tares also and so the servants of the householder came in 7 to him sir did it sound not so good seed in thy field from whence then hath it terrors and he said unto them and the enemy has done this and the servant said unto Him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay less Wow you gather up the tares ye root up also the weed and with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather ye together first to tears him bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn and the answered and said unto them this is verse 37 now he answered and said unto them he that sowed the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the Reapers are the Angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the Son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth and then shall go how the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their father who have ears to hear let him hear a man always wonderful words of life reminding you of what we read in Matthew where'er that he spoke John the Baptist was the forerunner of the coming of Jesus and he came as the Alliance Elisha prophet to prepare the hearts of the fathers for the children to come on the scene the children meaning Jesus and His disciples and he told them said that he that cometh after me shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire verse 12 of Matthew 3 says whose families in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner and the Corsa Garner is a granary or storehouse or barn and but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire so now as we're looking upon this today we're we're going to we're going to set some foundational work as I go into this subject today because I'm gonna be speaking on being born of the breath of God and so wouldn't but as we look here in the scripture we see that Jesus would also speak of the kingdom and he defined the kingdom of God in stages of the wheat plant for an example the seed the blade the ear and after there the full corn in the in the ear now the reason why that Jesus would use these parables was when the Jews rejected Christ and thus would prevent him from reigning as son of David in the Millennial Kingdom the kingdom that took on a different form it became a mystery form and and so Jesus would actually tell us of the kingdom of God that he was introducing was a spiritual Kingdom that would be in place until the Millennial Kingdom could come in where he could reign physically as the son of David with his bride with his church now so Jesus let us know that the kingdom as a wheat plant would go from grain the grain planted to the grain harvesting in other words um that what was planted would be manifested in the harvest time but in between those time the kingdom would look like nothing like the original grain like the blade the stalk and the husk looks nothing like the original grain that was planted of course we identify as well that's a that's a wheat plant but it look anything like the grain it's it's green it's a blade it's not a it's not a hard seed with life in it but it is life in it but it's now in a different form as it goes through its stages and so the kingdom in between the two seeds would look nothing like the original grain until it come back to a mature corn in the ear again now Jesus would tell us in mark chapter six and I mean mark chapter four verse 26 he would also tell us how the kingdom of God would be and he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man cast seed into the ground and he should sleep and rise night and day and the seed spring and grow up he know it not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear and after that the full corn in the ear but when the fruit is broke forth immediately he put it put it in the sickle because harvest has come so Jesus again would tell us and describe how that the kingdom would actually go from grain to grain but in between those times it would be different other stages and these stages they would possess different qualities of the life that was in the grain but the resemblance and the look would not be the same that there would be it would be the same church but it would be in a different form but it wouldn't be a mature form it would be an immature form and it wouldn't be a harvestable form it would be a form that wasn't ready for the garner or the rapture it would be a something that was in stages waiting until the grain come back again and the the wheat would put on the full corn and within the ear now according to the Bible there are three groups that represents the church we know there's only really one church but yet at the same time there are many groups that represent the church all right so there are these there are two that are described in the book of Matthew chapter 25 word that he speaks a bill of wise and a foolish virgin now both of these are under the umbrella of the word Church you know and but the the wives will go into the marriage because they have oil in their vessels with their lamps now the foolish are there also virgins there are pure people they they're also a part of of the group but yet the foolish have lamps and that which is a profession but they have no L they they have a confession and confess that Jesus is Lord but never go on to receive the Holy Ghost are you with me they and as a result because they have no oil in their vessels with their lamps they are cast into outer darkness where there is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth now this is the Great Tribulation now this group receives life at the white throne judgment they're not lost now let's get an understanding you know God is a God full of grace and he's got a lot more grace you know what you and I can imagine we think a lot of times only if God God only deals with with my little group or this little group or whatever but God is such a big God a mountain and he's a god that is such full of grace he's got his children he's got a bride that's an elected is his church that's going in a rapture but according to the Bible there's also another elect people who will go through the tribulation and they will need further purging and will be given life at the white throne judgment now we're gonna look into some of these things as we look in the scripture along but before we do I want to talk about another group that is also called the church and this church is not a virgin you know with the other two our virgin they're pure people they have works of purity in their lives and but the other one is not a virgin she's called the great now she is found in revelation 17 and 18 she also is a church and unfortunately she will be burned with fire so now already we're seeing something because this group is lost eternally but he will burn them up like the Bible said he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire so now the Bible the Bible now tells that when the great babblin comes up in remembrance before God that he will stone that prostitute with hell stones weigh in a hundred pounds apiece if you look in Revelation 18 and verse 8 it tells about her plagues shall come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord who gestured so we can see her plagues will come but it also tells us and I didn't write the scripture down but it's also in Revelation that he will he will stone her with hailstones weigh in a hundred pounds apiece I'll tell you what God that's the fury of Almighty God that'll be poured out on the Hori system but all of these are churches so now we got a bride that's going in the rapture she is the church we got a church that is going to the Tribulation Period that lays ahead after that the rapture is over and that will they will be and that will be hunted down by the beast and the false prophet and a great terrible persecution that we already see things coming in order right now in our very nation as our nation turns from from being a nation under God to nation who doesn't want God and so you can see the very attitude and the spirits of people that are being changed even in Revelation 13 as it shows the Beast that rises up out of the land which is America it changes from like a lamb to speak as the dragon so it leaves as part of freedom of religion and begins to speak as a dragon did before them which which again we're we're living in a day where we're fastly losing our Liberty now but however before that time comes the Bride of Christ is leaving here now that's what our job is to do is to try to prepare you for the leaving not the stay now there are those that are prophesying people right into the tribulation but what we want to do is prophesy you right into a rapture any man because I believe that there is a rapture for the church but then there's another group who has also calls themselves a church and she's a woman also but she's not a virgin she's a because she's taken in the seeds of man theology and ideas of man over the Word of God and God calls her a and he will burn her with fire I just read it in the scripture he will also heal will also stone her with stones just like they did in the Old Testament where that knew were men and women caught in adultery with stone with stones and burn with fire God will do the same thing to the prostitute system so again it's important that we we be in the right group where we can win we're part of the church we don't want to be in the church that receives the plagues in the book of Revelation we don't either want to be in the church that goes through the tribulation we want to be in the bride that goes in a rapture how many wants to be a part of that bride a ma'am just cake the thing is under coming up on the earth now brother Branham would tell would tell us in the message that token he said it's a type of today shown that we face in another exodus God bring an Israel out of Egypt to the promised land was a type of Christ bringing the bride out of the church to the promised land we're in another exodus now if you study the scripture you know where it's God brought a nation out of a nation God will bring the bride out of a church the bride will be called from all the churches it'll be the election of God will be brought out and we're on the verge of that exodus right now but we have every scriptural proof that we're standing there and he said I know it's been said a lot of times but my friends one time it'll be said for the last time time will fade into eternity then he's coming to take a bride out of the church and the token was the thing that the token in the in Israel was the blood of the Lamb a man our token is the Holy Ghost it's the sign that we must have so the death angel will pass over us so the token was the thing that made the difference between Egypt and Israel the two nations they were all human beings all God created all the handiwork of God but the difference when the death penalty was passed the difference between life and death was to token so will it be at the coming of the Son of God when he brings the bride out of the church the difference will be the token now listen close and see the truth the token will be the difference yes God would be a difference so notice these things as brother Branham was bringing it to us there is a difference between the church that goes in a rapture and the church that goes through the tribulation and the church that gets burnt with fire are you with me remember now is part of the wheat plant that gets burned with unquenchable fire so you is shown in the scripture some has burned some is harvested and summons for other uses right amens because there there's a use for other parts of the plantiffs the straw is bailed for other uses but the grain goes in the barn he goes into garner but but the but part of it gets burned with unquenchable fire so you know you want to identify and see what part and realize what makes the difference what is going to make the difference between the real church that goes in a rapture and the church that goes through the tribulation or the others against mark with fire the difference is going to be the token which is the baptism of the holy ghost now so you see as we're looking at this there's coming up your vacation upon the earth the Bible says so that the earth will burn with the fervent Heat Malikov or cells that will walk out on the ashes of the wicked because that the earth will burn and yea the wicked and all that do wickedly shall burn with it with them all will be ashes under the soles of our feet this is the Bible right so you know so they're the first as we look at there is a church and that church we call the bride because he said I will have a church without spot or wrinkle and yet that church is also in a marriage relationship with Christ and that marriage relationship well and Paul would use that in in Ephesians 532 and he would tell us this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church and he would define the man and the woman and the marriage between the man and the woman to show that the mystery of what Christ was doing that he had come for the purpose of getting a bride and Manny he come me come to get a people who would be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life power of his power all that he is she is are you with me so again he would identify that look at verse 23 as he as he defines it Christ is a head of the church he's the savior of the body he would see Christ love the church gave himself thought that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word verse 27 that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be wholly without blemish in verse 30 he would say we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones and he says they too shall be one flesh so now he is very clear that there is going to be a people that that match him then a bone of his bone and life of his life and power of his power and they have his life that's what the token is they have his life the Holy Ghost in their life there they're not just professed believers but they are filled with a very life of Jesus Christ they are of his species they are miss Janice they came from him they are going back to him a man that she is this bride is a perfect match peace to him a man she can yield to him because he is the head and and she can surrender her life unto Him because I'll surrender her all because he's her husband and so all of these come into play in this relationship between the bride and cries now look with me in Revelation 19 and 7 let's just get another a word for this bride another scripture about is let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready so I want you say something here what we're here because the marriage of the lamb has come what species must marry species kind after kind is that Bible amen so every seed must bring forth of his kind all the way back from Genesis so now if the lamb is going to get married he's gonna have to have a lamb owner that matches the lamb coming from heaven so even as he was a lamb submissive to the father's word even so the bride would be a lamb submissive to the word hey man now so and to her was was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God now mark that place because we'll refer back to it in a little bit but now so you notice there's a bride and there's going to be a marriage of the lamb there is a people that is being married to the groom let me just stop just for a moment you remember everything God did through the scriptures was really a reflection of the very longing of the heart of God so when God dwelled alone and by himself the longley God not before he was even called God God is an object of worship and there was nobody to worship him see not God at this point he hasn't he has the abilities to become God but he has to first make objects to worship Him a man so he would make angels and angels would worship Him but now he's God when angels worship him but now but now but he's Elohim the self-existent one he exists alone and by himself and he has desires within him he has thoughts within him and these thoughts have never been released and then when he releases these thoughts they're in the form of the word or the logos and by the word he'll create everything so this is why he has thought of his father and the son because he as a father he out from him comes the logos through which he will create the whole world a man he'll bring all things into existence are you with me now so this is why this when it when it comes back to the beginning the Christ sent in the begin was the word the logos and the Word was with God and the Word was God and this word was in the beginning with God and by the word he created all things that was made right so therefore when God would say let us make man he is he is speaking of what he is doing not as in it as the Eternal Spirit along but working through the very vehicle of the logos by the word he begins to beget he begins to create by the word but now there's something in the heart of God God is very lonely he is dwelt for eons while there was no time so of eternity which we can't comprehend before time ever even exists as it begins and you can't even mention in years because there immeasurables called God always was and so there in the eternal as he there dwells alone and by himself he has these desires I want I want someone I can share my life with I want someone that you know that will will be someone that I can that well it'll just be me and another farm I want fellowship I desire to hell I'm lonely and I won't fellowship you know what God made man in His image how did he make him he made the man he made the man but he didn't make a woman right but the woman was there but she was just in him that's the way it was with you I mean you always were because when we see this lonely God it wasn't that you didn't exist you were just in him before the world ever began all brother that's why I'm trying to tell you you're not a temporal being your are eternal being your coming from God you're going back to God you always were you didn't just begin at the altar hallelujah you didn't just become a son at the altar you always were a son you always were a daughter of God no matter how lost you were no matter how far you were out in the sin you were always his son you were always his daughter he came to seek and to save that which was lost everything God has ever done is a count on the count of you the reason he made a world is because of you the reason he made angels is on account of you the reason there is a heaven is because of you your the central theme of God's heart so don't let the devil to tell you you some kind of down trust something that God don't care about your the very thoughts of his heart so when he makes man he makes him in His image so being in the image of God you don't see a woman because to be in the image of God the woman was in the was in Christ in God right amen so here where was he she was there all the times he was just hidden in the man she was that hidden secret until God put him to sleep and then when he put him to sleep there who Adam to sleep he pulled out a part of him and now because why he said it's not good that man should be alone a man God knew that he knew what it meant to be alone he went he wanted to counterpart so this is why he began all of creation this is why the logos was released from him to begin with a man so that he would have more sons of God more daughters of God more logos just like him they're going to be the word the word bride the word people are you with me now so now again there he would put Adam to sleep and he would pull out the elements that was necessary to farm Eve and I can imagine as God formed her imagine as his fingers formed her carefully her face and he pulled there and began to develop and begin to to look into that no doubt his eyes were looking way beyond this little piece of clay he's working on right here with a rib from Adam and he's thinking one day I'm gonna go to sleep one day I'm gonna be hunting across one day in my sleep there's gonna be something coming forth from me and there's gonna be elements of water blood and spirit a man that will come from me from my body and it'll be the elements I'll form a bride out and once I get that bride I'll never be lonely again because it's a different listen it's a different form of fellowship if I could explain it to you and oh god help me to to do this but you know did you know you you are greater than angels you only made a little lower than the Angels for a time for the purpose of temptation and sin and whatever we've had to go through but but but friends that's not our original position our original position is is to be the very image the very likeness of God hey man now you don't I've had a lot of nice animals in my life I've had goats and cattle and you know I've had I've had dogs I've had some in my lifetime I've had wonderful dogs when I was 50 I when I turned 50 if I could go back to my childhood my desire was to be a veterinarian so you know I loved I loved the animals so it was just an animal lover and I hated dog pounds I would I would curse everyone in my come by killing all them wonderful dogs I'm a little oh I'm a little older now I kind of now for animal control but you know but you know that they mom some family members called me Timmy dog because I love dogs so much I had a lot of wonderful dogs you know you can pet a dog you can just love a dog and talk to him fellowship with him tell him about everything he just wags his tail you know it looks up at you you know got a pretty little grin on his face his tongue lolling out his mouth and but you know fellows have been with a dog there's nothing like fellowship in with another human I can tell the human down to something and they understand something that I'm talking about I did Gordon you know in my tenure of raising dogs on I used to have kennels of them and so on and raise different breeds of them from beagles to rat terriers to hounds to everything I've been through it all and I I'd build a dog house and the dog would sit over there watch me build it I'd say okay yeah it's all finished don't wouldn't get in that thing I'd have to chain that dog to that thing the only one that would start raining or something will it finally run into it you get fixing up just as nice that dog wouldn't get in that thing for nothing because you know oh you could not convey to it what you were doing for it and the good it would bring a man but you see when you when you come to another human being it's somebody of your of an equal intelligence it's on the same lines of fellowship and this is what God is wanting to do with you is to elevate you to a place of a fellowship where that he you and him can have a fellowship together that you got things common you understand what is purple in his plan is and when he says I've made a heaven for you you want to go to that heaven and then you want to be a part of everything you has because he is telling you bringing things here up to you to share with you his innermost secrets and his secrets was you know before the world began I cared for you I've had you on my veranda I knew you were telling I've made plans for a honeymoon a man before the tribulation comes I've got a rapture promise for you I'm not gonna leave you here to fend for yourself but I got it escaped from the Laodicean age and there's gonna be a harvest in the last day and you're a part of that harvest you will not be left behind but you're gonna go with me and that's my spirit leads here you're leaving with me [Applause] the marriage supper of the Lamb Pilate sent an extra plate I don't know exactly which one of you are coming and who you are planned for your place be one of my children listen there but even all of that I know there's gonna be some that you love left behind and I made a place for them too that after the tribulation is over I'm gonna take them into life also would you like to read that with me let's look in the book of Revelation and for this we'll find chapter 7 and verse 9 revelation 7 and I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number and look here there of all nations Kindred's people and tongues hey man don't you like that man that means and no matter what nationality are you know they're there and they stood before the throne and before the lamb and they were clothed with white robes and palms within the hands and the cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our God which sit upon the throne and unto the lamb you know the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and about and the four beasts and and fell before the throne and there on their faces and worship God saying hey man blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving and honour and power and might be under our God forever and ever amen and one of the elders answered and say unto me what are they these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they now if we were to read the whole chapter we would have seen that from the from the different tribes the twelve tribes that were coming twelve thousand so there was 144,000 and he knew he recognized these these were Jewish people coming from the Jewish backgrounds but now notice in this that he's asked um you know who are these and John doesn't know he doesn't recognize these these are not a tribal people these are not Jews and he said sir thou knowest and he says these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb therefore there before notice this what's there presented there before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them now I want you to notice this does not match the overcomers in the Laodicean age because they don't sit with because they sit with him on the throne look at revelation 3:21 real quick to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and I'm said that with my father in his throne so we see now this is a different even before the throne but the bride sits with him in the his throne and notice now as we go back to this revelation 7 they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall there be sunlight on them in on them nor any Heat for the languages in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears their eyes oh look how gentle he is for these look how loving he is like a shepherd but notice notice this after the tribulation is over because they have come out of Great Tribulation so this is the other side of the tribulation after the tribulation is over this group is seen cared for by the Lamb who leads them to living fountains of water which is eternal life so if you turn with me to John chapter 7 verse 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water for but this he spake of the Spirit which they will that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified so what junior watch this very carefully these people had done works of sanctification in other words they had went through different stages of purification there had washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb and they were sanctified now listen carefully they were sanctified through their works of washing they were not given robes of righteousness but rather made their robes white by washing them in the blood of the Lamb now note this is different from the bride who did not get white robes by works but rather as a gift a royal granted you know with that final linen which is none other than the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is given by grace so turn with me to Revelation 19 and 7 let's just look and see the bride it's a royal grant that is given it's not works of sanctification where you know well I'm gonna quit this smoking or I'm gonna quit this drinking or I'm gonna lay down drugs or I'm gonna try to be good to my neighbor I'm gonna carry firewood to the widow woman I'm gonna do all these work and all that these are what this other group did they did works to purify themselves but this group it's just given back grace not something they earned but because of just the unmerited favor of God so he says in verse 7 revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen and that fine linen is exceedingly soft and dazzling white this linen would be sold for twice the price of gold viable she said to be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for fine linen is the righteousness of the saints so I want you to notice the difference notice one is working for purification going through steps you know I'll quit this and I'll reform here and I'll try to do right here and this other one he's not it's not works at all it's something just granted to them by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that brings them into his righteousness not their own righteousness in this group in Revelation 7 after the tribulation is over they are led into eternal life so they're believing unto but it's not until the white throne judgment when they're before the throne and are divided as the Sheep are from the goats and they're judged according to the deeds done in their bodies let me just get something clear you the Bride of Christ will never be judged for the deeds done in your body it's a home gone he took away your filthy rags and exchanged it for the greatest exchange that was ever and that's the righteousness of the saints so now we find that these had to go through the tribulation period for purification she has to be purged for sins of unbelief and rejecting the message so that the sleeping virgins had to go through the tribulation for more purification because it wasn't ready if you look back in the parable of the wise and the foolish then both are virgins and one goes into the marriage the other goes into we've been in wailing gnashing of teeth that go into great tribulation but both the virgins are you with me Amen the difference is one has oil one I don't have oil and the one has all goes into marriage the one who doesn't go through tribulation because they were dilatory come on slothful and somehow another did not prevail all the way into receiving the true baptism of the Holy Ghost so you see how important the Holy Ghost is a man now brother Branham would say she's not the bride but it's the church the pure people that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way were blinded by these false prophets and they didn't get a chance but they were really sincere in their heart and God knows their heart and hear their purge during that time I'd say what a merciful God needs I'm going to rapture they're not in the honeymoon which is a millennium but they come at the white throne judgment where they're separated as a sheep from the goats again let me just share another little thing about it here he said these Tribulation Period Saints they come up went through Great Tribulation now the church will not go through the tribulation combat the bride see they're already in Gori and here's the tribulation Saints the sanctified ones being this mind are your fault and your fault did they never heard the word if they heard it and rejected it they went on to hell that was cast into outer darkness cause they rejected the word but if they would never have never heard it God is just the Tribulation Period comes to them notice the Saints are washed by the same word because it's the same altar now and but he said they're there because we never took their word to them that's the reason that was like that we never took the word to them we're going to be held responsible and we're and so will not be able to catch all the peoples the church won't in this age has got the truth because they'll go through the tribulation they're not the Saints that died way back yonder in them church changes cause he said they come out of Great Tribulation and the Great Tribulation is yet future after the church goes home so now they are those that come out of Great Tribulation now so they they stand up before the white throne judgment and remember the Saints the true Saints will judge the earth they will sit with him on his throne but there's gonna be multitudes brought before him during that time that will will be divided as the sheep are from the goats as a shepherd would separate the two species right so now they're separated like sheep from the goats the church members come up they've heard the truth if they've heard the truths rejected it then what's gonna be said when the great big things spread across the canvas when your own thoughts will be there when you thought about what you thought about it how are you going to escape and it's right there on the canvas so these are the skies and God's great television there's your only on tops rebelling right your own thoughts will speak against you in that hour so if you speak one thing and think another you better stop that get your tops on God and keep them pure stay right there and speak the same thing all the time they say well don't say well I believe it I say I'll say I believe it I'll go find out you believe it now deeds the reason they die out they go to the purging of the tribulation because they are not actually under the bud they claim they are but they're not so how can they go through a trial to purify them with the blood of bleached blood of Jesus Christ take several symptoms and sin and step away from you and you're already dead your life is here than God in him through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what are you gonna be just for what's your from purification what do you have to be purified from when you're already perfectly in Christ sinless what's the judgment for but they're sleeping but is what think the people can can't make out so now what we're trying to tell you today is that's what the true baptism of the Holy Ghost does for you it removes ever symptom of sin a man and it'll lead you into all truth now how is it that they're not truly under the blood this is a group of people that are watching the robes in the blood the lamb but they're still you know doing things to to be purified because they're not now this is gonna stumble some they are not fully born-again they have just gone through some of the requirements of the birth like believing on the Lord confessing him as Savior and maybe doesn't work so sanctification but they have not been filled with the spirit now remember the difference between between the church and the bride is gonna be the token that's going to be the difference both of my virgins both of them good people both of them at their names in the book of life somebody with me even in the Lamb's Book of Life their names are there in my boat but the difference is is one has the Holy Ghost and what doesn't and because of that one is the bride because she has his life and has the spirit and the other his great mercy has rude their blindness and gave them life I say what a merciful God now let's just talk about this minute because again meaning or call themselves born again when they're not truly born again or maybe they just started in the initial steps of the new birth let's look at it this way let's go back to the origin of the church the origin of the churches on the day of Pentecost that's where she was born of the Spirit of God and and there she was a born-again Church so remember this was a very new thing the Old Testament Jews knew nothing about a new birth this is why you know in the Old Testament laws if you were born because of a sinful birthless a bastard child whoa you know you were you were never allowed into the congregation of the children of Israel and into the temple worship you wasn't accepting than in ten generations it would take to breathe that one sin out so it was a horrible thing adultery was so bad in the eyes of God and remember God had a plan he wanted to have a people that through he could bring a virgin and a virgin would conceive he wasn't going to find that among the Gentiles because sex was in their religion as they did there are drunken orgies and things around their gods they they participate in sexual acts so there wasn't that that was there was no no such thing as purity among the Gentiles so you don't free even the Gentiles be saved it was going to say something different because we didn't have a lineage of ten generations to breed out all the call amen somebody with me Amen so Jesus introduced a new doctor and that doctor was you mouth be born again well you thought they thought would just reborn to the seed of Abraham that's good enough to be Abraham's sons and his offspring that's God's chosen people that's good enough but Nicodemus is told no you've reached a time that is not gonna work just to be born in the lineage of Abraham you must be born again there it is required that there's a new birth that births you out of sin and into righteousness so they started out everybody knew what the new birth was it was the receiving of the life of God when the Holy Spirit came in the church that was the breath of God then he come into the church on the day of Pentecost nobody was confused and when when they asked Peter what shall we do he says repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises to you and to your children and that them that are fall even as many as the Lord our God shall call you see there was no confusion everybody knew what it meant to be born again but it didn't take long for as a church this planet remember it would be planted as a seed and that seed a seed deteriorates and it begins to break down and life comes out of it and the old seed rots away and how comes as shoot and it doesn't look anything like the grain but it still is still the wheat is till the church but it don't look anything like the original and this began to happen in the early church the first thing you know the church isn't look like what they were on the day of Pentecost they were they were still the church that God called as his eyes his own and God is still moving on and sin and revival Sinden is his holy spirit reign upon them but still at the same time they don't look anything like the seed because that's not going to come until you come back to harvest again and it harvest there's gonna be a group of people who will look exactly like to see that was but yet it's the bride all the way through is God's church all the way through their me a resurrection for all of them all the way through they man but now it wasn't long until the devil began to get in the book of Acts church there were people that were bypassing the new birth in Acts chapter 15 and I chapter 15 there was people bypassing the new birth bye-bye there were Pharisees which believed so how did they remain Pharisees and still be a believer that had died to the teachings of man and their own ideas and they were trying to incorporate their past thoughts into the new message so therefore they would hybridize or change to try to change the the gospel Paul would call it a bewitching he say this actually witchcraft is a demonic influence that is trying to take you away from the original gospel and he said if you preach anything other than what I preached you you be a curse for of an angel would come from heaven and preach any other gospel than what I preached let him be accursed but what would begin to happen now as these poor people received the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost I say poor meaning they were impoverished it wasn't wealthy the wealthy of the land you know they heard the message preached 3,000 were saved a man outta to the church and filled with the Holy Ghost and in the house of Cornelius and Gentiles were saved and mothers revival going on and the Holy Spirit is moving and there's miracles and there's signs and there's wonders and the Holy Ghost is he is filling people and they're speaking in other tongues and they're shouting rejoicing they're there they're getting the same experience that they did on the day of Pentecost see everybody with me right now but it wasn't long until you know they as these were these miracles were being witnessed and the EM were seen you know that the asses of these people as say with would see them and say yeah take me to I want some of that I want to go to that church and and they would embrace Christianity and they'd go down to you know where they were in meetings in that little dark dingy hall and clapped their hands and shout and speaking in tongues and I'm quoting from the second seal here and he said in getting messages and said why he could never take that to his competitors are his associates or whatever in his business he could never believe it like that certainly not he's got to dress it up so they begin to get together and say we'll form a little something different and so Jesus would call this the deeds of the Nicolaitans he said there's a spirit that is coming to conquer validity and to overcome the laity now all these are Bible terms you find that in the book of Revelation so you see to overcome the laity you see they wanted to take out of the church the resurrection Lord Jesus with signs and wonders among the believers and just change them over into formalism you don't kind of dress it up make it where the rest of the Society of the church couldn't receive that you know it'd be a little easier to swallow if everybody wasn't shouting and rejoicing and and speaking in other tongues and messages come in like that list let's kind of listen let's have a dignified Church and so the devil dim winds up getting in the book of Acts Church you know and begins to take away the power of God the signs and the wonders remove all the emotion from the pew amen take even the a man's out of it and then place it all up on a holy ministry amen where the priest does all it does everything and and whatever can forgive you of your sins they can lay you know bring you in or keep you out they will be the mediator between you and God sounds like some of these backslidden message people that want to preach today amen trying to say you know that that now that they can be the intercessor you're nothing more than a Catholic but again you see begin but again they were getting to lose the truth of the new birth and the Catholics would reduce it further but simply the new birth number can begin to mean that we just born into a Catholic family now if you're not careful the same thought can be passed along that I'm in the message you know I'm born again this because I'm born into a message family and men physical birth will only birth you into sin it'll never birth you into life every person must have his own chance at the word and meant to receive a reject the word and meant to have their own revival and so it doesn't come because my daddy was a Christian and my granddaddy was a Christian so I'm a Christian no the only way you can be a child of God is to be born of God by the Holy Spirit so again you know it would be reduced I mean would be until I you know if you're born in this family where you're a Christian because everybody in this family is a Christian well then Luther come along and said but you know the just or the righteous selling of my faith and and this became his message as he got a realization but it's not being born physically in the church you've got to have you gotta have faith in Christ and the Luther came out of the Gallic Church and received that revelation so he taught that faith was the new birth death for you were justified or declared righteous by faith now so again now it's not been born into the gathered churches a new birth but now they understand you've got to believe on Christ to be born again amen now Wesley would come along John Wesley in the Methodist movement he would teach sanctification but there's got to be a sanctified life that goes with this so he recalled this the second blessing he taught that a holy life must come with believing on Christ and after you believe then you become sanctified so now now it is understood to be born again means to I must be um I must believe in Christ and I must live a holy life and then the Pentecostals especially the Assembly of God which was the first part of the movement of the penalty Azusa Street revival they taught after that you were saved by believing but then you receive your added power after receiving the Holy Ghost now I didn't want to say to you in all of these things and all the denominations out there the truth of it is people many people are believing on Christ and some summer like you said they're just there cause a family member but some have a absolute perfection of faith they have professed Jesus Christ as their Savior and they have accepted him as Lord of their life and so they have believed on him but but again I want you to understand believing is not the same as receiving because you must be born again by receiving the Holy Spirit in your life you're not truly converted until you receive the Holy Ghost as they did on the day of Pentecost now the Evangelic alieve that you receive the Holy Ghost the moment you profess Christ as your personal Savior you got the Spirit of God you know don't all scheme this is a common prayer of his and this is what he does he says you know you just say Lord Jesus I repent of my sins come into my heart wash me clean I'm making my Lord and Savior amen and then he says we believe if you prayed that simple prayer born again so to them that's to be born again that you just repeated this simple prayer after somebody else and said I make you my Lord and Savior wash me clean come into my heart and the Romans 10 and 9 does say I'm gonna give this that thou if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so I want you to notice thou shall be saved and the confession is made unto salvation it is not salvation to confess Jesus and Lord and Savior and ask him into your heart is a good beginning if it's done in sincerity but you must continue on to salvation amen that's what you believe when you accept Christ as your personal Savior you're believing on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost a man salvations thought to me you know for one to be saved in their sin rather than from their sin you know Peter let's just go to him for a minute Peter knew by divine revelation that Jesus was the Christ the Son of the Living God hey man since he he professed him as Savior as Messiah the one who comes to save man and it was by divine revelation but he didn't get the Holy Ghost I'm to Pentecost are you with me now so the mean you see I'm here was Peter he had followed him for three years he had his name on the Lamb's Book of Life he had cast out devils he done great works he'd healed he preached the word everything but he still wasn't converted because you see you're leading to conversion you see the Bible said that he that cometh to God must believe so that's the first part you must believe and man you must believe that he is and that he will reward those who diligently seek Him amen so the first parts of it is you must believe you're not going to get the first base without believing and I want to say to you who I believe congratulations you got the first base hey man but you gotta keep on moving you can't camp down there there's more to it than just believing you must receive after you believe hey man now it's like leading to conversion now Jesus typed it as a birth so in the birth there is a conception so the conception is first but no baby yet right although it's a life and we believe it people sincerely die in that condition and you never having a chance to to go on with God and receive the Holy Ghost we believe that person will will be saved that there's a place in heaven for them but friends to be a part of the bride I want to get it back to you you're gonna have to have the Holy Ghost to go in the rapture there is a difference God is making a difference between the church and the bride in this day and then because now the word has been restored now so you see when I when a baby is concerned conceived in the womb and then it's developed and it's in the second stage but the baby has to be born and when that baby is born it receives the breath of life now we can't say there wasn't life there before but there's a different life than that life hey ma'am now Peter had believed on the Lord he had confess him as Christ but he wasn't yet converted let's just look here Luke chapter 21 - in verse 31 said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou I converted strengthen thy brother when you're converted what do you mean Lord our God the one that got the revelation doctrine crisis send the Living God flesh and blood has not revealed this to you Simon but my father which is in heaven he's revealed this to you and on this rock I build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it because every person must have that that first rock confession of who Jesus is a man that he came to seek and save that which was lost and he's my Savior he asserted for my Redemption his blood was shed for me so I can be filled with his spirit but he said but when you are converted strengthen your brethren now during this time of sifting the trash was exposed in his life you know this if that week was like winnowing the grain you take it you throw it up in the air the grain falls down the chaff gets blowed away the trash gets lotus-eyed right hey man so I wouldn't I won't just get something me oh the sifting in the world that Satan could do - Peter could not make him not be great it couldn't change him from being drained only thing that happened would be exposed to chaff and blow that away hey ma'am but when Peter come down to it you know when the trash wood was exposed in his life he would denied the Lord three times and he would curse and say I know not the man and then he would weep bitterly about ho he would be so sorrowful he he would be so repented I've sinned again I I've done it again sounds like a lot of people in their Christian experience they have a confession of faith but they're truly not yet converted because when on a bond they'll deny the Lord and by their actions say I know not the man and then that we bitterly because with all their good intentions in the trial they have a bit chilly over and over again deny the Lord there's so many believers like Peter are you with me that go through this over and over and over again they they than when the time of sifting it's discovered when the winds of trial blows the evil is is discovered that has been clinging to their lives and is exposed and they've come I know not the man now come to that point of denial now there had to have to be something that would happened to that Christ denying cussin preacher Simon Peter and on the day of Pentecost it changed forever because what had been conceived by believing on the Lord that was birthed in the sonship and the life of God came into him by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you never find a hair from that point on a cussin lying the nappy Christ denying Peter but you see somebody in the face of adversity in the face of imprisonment his talent is is gone there's a holy boldness in his life there's a power that lays within him that no matter what he faces never never never again will he ever deny the Lord because now he is converted changed forever we got churches full of Peters today hey man I'm not saying that all they're not good people are sincere or even didn't didn't have a real sincere confession of faith and believe on the Lord and accept him as Savior and really believe on that but there's something still needs to happen to change them because this Holy Spirit when he comes he seals you to the day of redemption ah you know so now on the day of Pentecost he's given the key to the kingdom Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for a remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed this is a hold of our problem right here people pretend of their sins that get baptized in water but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost you believe I'm to receiving the spirit believing on Jesus is a step in the right direction which is toward the Holy Ghost but people stop there they go as far as the water and then stop they believe and then stop and this is where you find him in Acts chapter 19 they had been baptized by John the Baptist that's a pretty good person to be baptized by don't you think they had believed but yet but but had yet to receive the Holy Ghost for they said we didn't know there was to be such a thing as a Holy Ghost we we thought just believing on the Lord was enough we just stopped being believing it baptized and was was all we need and he said we'll have you received only your sense you have believed now this is the question comes right down to it and it's the question that's going to make the difference between the church and the bride and then because the the the one has believed that church going through the tribulation has believed on the Lord unto salvation but has not yet been converted and the other has been converted by receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost therefore they can go into rapture they have the oil in their vessels with their lamps they're not just professors and they're not just cleaned up people sometimes we think that's what we got to do we just clean people up get them to change the way they dress the way they talk you know you quit using your extremities you you start doing this and you reform them it isn't a reclamation it's a transformation they have no power for they stopped short of Pentecost and that's the thing now brother Branham would explain this about the red heifer how God made a way of faretta reconciliation and the Old Testament and that was you would God would instruct him to take a red heifer heifer without blemish and there they would taken would burn her with was with scarlet and with with cedar all of these reds the Reds the red thread there were the red cedar and then the red heifer and it would burn them together to make a water of separation and this was so that there would be a cleansing so that they could come into the tabernacle and in the presence of God so the first thing a sinner does is he comes and he hears the word faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God so he comes to be convicted that he's a sinner and he's without God so no matter how long he's going to church that don't mean anything all these all this all these things has a spiritual meaning well you know because listen anybody can come in and get baptized hey man let somebody baptism but water will never wash away your sins you know who can you know you've have them stand up and we can even sprinkle a little anybody could and a little water on you holy water will cleanse you it won't mean won't save you people can make a cold and drive profession say and I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God well every devil in Hell believes he's the son of God hey man but the coming to church is good attending church still won't make you a Christian any more than going to a barn makes your horse you know but really to come and fellowship with God means you accept the blood it's been applied in your heart but the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you become not just a partner with God but you become in relationship with God a son and daughter of God hey man now so you see is good to come to church it's good to be baptized but everyone coming into divine fellowship with Christ he has to he has to recognize that before him when Jesus Christ with his own blood sprinkled away put the stripes on the glad and went in not like Aaron with the blood of an animal but with his own blood and he stands in the presence of God tonight right now make an intercession amen so let me tell you you know you and the baptism of the Holy Ghost you you are in the presence of God you are in the holiest of Holies you're in the presence of the Shekinah and that's why that we know the lamb hasn't let the mercy seat because where I am the Lambs there a man where I am healing is there I can see he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by His stripes I am healed hey man she's sitting right there and brother he'll make good anything we confess to be true and that'll make demons tremble sinners come to life when they recognize we have an intercessor that we have a God there that will do more than just shake your hand and bring you into the fellowship of the church but bring you in the fellowship with Christ a man that'll satisfy that loneliness is in the heart of God a man plunging beneath the blood now let's just go to a principle in the scripture I've got a little more time but in John chapter 3 let's just look there you can turn there it starts with you know where Jesus begins to talk to Nicodemus you must be born again and he would say you must be born of the water and of the Spirit so the water is the word we are cleansed by so now notice it's a great thing to come to the water part and that water part the new birth and get washed and the wants from all your sins washed from all the false doctrines and embraced truth that's one part of the birth but like brother Branham said don't just come this far and say I believe the message you must have the token the Holy Ghost and that's the breath of God so you see again he would say in and in John he would make any plain the Spirit is the breath to be bored of the Spirit is to be born of the breath of God for Jesus immediately we'll we'll talk about after the new birth he'll describe the wind as as the breath and then and John 20 verse 22 he said when he said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost so jesus knew that coming to the spirit as of birth and he likened it as to a wind that the that the new birth of his offspring would be to be born of the breath of God are you with me so he said Marvel not I say that you must be born again verse a the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but cannot tell where it cometh and whither it goeth and so is every one that is born of the Spirit and then on the day of Pentecost it came it came like a rushing mighty wind hallelujah and when the high priest didn't know where he come from it certainly didn't come from them the Pharisees didn't know where he come from it hadn't come from them they didn't know where this wind came from but from him from his own beers came a breath among the breath of life and feel the church and for the first time in all of history was a redeemed son by the blood the lamp burned up the Spirit of God and on the day of Pentecost it was a hundred and twenty initially that would be born of the breath of God God breathed the breath of life into them and now that life into them was kids life and that breath into that church was his breath so therefore the power that was in him was in them a man and the healing that was in him was in them and the signs that was in him was in them and everything that he was they were because he breathe like his old life his old breath and amber and they became a new creation they became a divine species they became God man they became God and dwelt a man and they went out and did exactly what Jesus did a man they went out of a room with the spirit and action they were Jesus men and women they raised the dead they discerned the hearts they cast out Devils they healed the sick they spoke peace to the center they showed God to the world somebody help me preach now this is what happened on the day of Pentecost they became God breed now let's just see what he what he says this about you he says as a man God makes you to be a ruler over all things so this clearly means all things a man born on the breath of God is the word of God they came from his thoughts as Jesus did then they reach a point in time and he breathed life into them John says beloved now we are the sons of God Paul would use Old Testament Scriptures to prove to us our sonship and he says in some 2222 I'll declare that name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee so I'll declare thy name unto my brethren God has brethren what I'm trying to tell you is he calls you family that you're a kinfolk somebody help me preach Isaiah 818 for I behold I and the children whom the lord hath given me are for signs and wonders in israel from the lord of hosts with dwelleth in mount zion zion the children who the lord hath given Ron Paul said in Romans 8:29 for whom he did foreknow them he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that means to be made to be made to the same essence of his character hallelujah Amen that he might be a somebody help me say this firstborn among many brethren so God's great design was not just to have Jesus as his son come on but to have many sons many daughters a man that would be God breeds just like him hallelujah that would come from from his thoughts in the word hallelujah and the word in the manifestation are you with me now a man so Jesus calls us brethren he be God became a brother to man when he took on humanity so that we as man can become a brother to God and He calls his family you're his family look over look over at somebody and say I'm part of God's family amen he calls you ever family title there he is look at the Bible because he bride wife sons daughters brethren ever ever favorite title of a relationship of family time title he gives it to you a man oh my listen and not only that he stooped down to us to pick us up and elevate us to sonship when you and I were lost a man and in dirty garments somebody help me preach now he made it a greatest exchange for your life he he made it were that you could be arrayed in white linen clean and white image which is the righteousness of this age is that right for the Bible said he made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so he stooped down because God's mindful of us he was so mindful of this generation that we've been through 2,000 years of church history until the gospel has been diluted and watered down with men's theology but we returned back to the land of the Holy Ghost a man that is not just an anointing that comes upon us and that leaves but it's the breath of God that has filled us with eternal life and power hallelujah oma then this is it I just want you to understand for him when when he said when he said to Israel he said let my people go when he said that about Israel to Egypt and let my people go God has a relationship with you my people my sons Israel is my son my firstborn and if you don't let my son go I'll kill all your firstborn this is God's decree these are my children my sons they're born of my life they're part of my power the barn of my breath hallelujah now listen brother Branham would bring this down and in the blasphemous names he said the church is a mystical body of Christ born of the breath of God whom did you get it he says the Church of God is born of the breath of God God breathed breath into the nostril spirits live my Adam and he became a living soul did you know that true Pentecostal church is born of the breath of God hallelujah now so jesus said did the Spirit is like the wind in the wind is the breath of God we know this that when the breath of God enters us that were changed forever as our soul then becomes alive you see man can't see where it comes from and you don't know where it goes when it leaves but we know this when it leaves us little body we're gone with it a man Adam became god-breathed he became a living soul God breathed the eternal life into him which he would later forfeit for II remember but what they've turned down we come back and accept a man and Adam became God breathed and he became a living soul come on he breathed the breath of life into his nostril and he became an eternal so God breathe not what Nick's are done what God did he wasn't born of the natural birth didn't come from a woman and then get a breath but the Bible says of him God breathed the breath of life in the Adam and Adam became a living soul Alleluia now Adam would forfeit this a man he would father this for his wife Eve remember I tell you friends as we come down to it remember on the day of Pentecost God's got another church man she has been formed through his ministry and three and a half years of ministry walking on the earth and teaching and doctrine and they believed in Christ and they've accepted him as personal Savior and they know is either that he's the Christ the Son of the Living God and all of these things in the been through purging and Peter us with his person and they come down to repentance and there they've been baptized in his name is a matter with me but our brother God wasn't through with just a water baptism suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty Wagner at God breathed upon his church and there was a church that rose to their feet that was of his life that was of this power they found that whoa that scene was him that he's a pisser now bone of my bone and this is my flesh of my flesh and she is life for my life but she is god-breathed hey man now every son that is born of the word of God or God breathed is when God breathed the breath of eternal life into them as brother Branham said in spoken words original seed all sudden all God's sons must be the same yes to be born of the word and the spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 to be born in the water in the spirit what does it do it brings you back to the place where you should have been at the beginning and that was a reason of Christ's death to bring us back to where sons of God now let's look at this scripture for a moment let's go to 2nd Timothy 3:16 I'll wait till they get it on the on the screen just a moment let's just get some of these points together all Scripture is given by inspiration of God it is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness now that word there is translated all Scripture is given by inspiration of God but actually it comes from a greek word and it means this literally all Scripture is god-breathed and it is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so all Scripture is god-breathed a man a man I actually ever word that I spoke has been breathed out and when God speaks a word it's his life breathing out his word are you with me now then this is the only use of in the Bible of this Greek word theophan T of notice which means God breathed inspired by God due to the inspiration of God so the word of God is formed by God's own breath stop for a minute that's why this message didn't come from a denomination this message didn't come from a school of theology this message was came from God's own breath God breathed a message in this last day to an endtime people he would prove that he was here then he was present that he knew the harlot that he knew the thoughts that he knew your address to show you that he was present because God was breathing a message oh man I want you to understand this is what the message of God is the word of God is formed by God's own breath and when a man speaks under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost you know God speaks to man it's the life of God the Holy Ghost for man his words as a man will speak as Oracle for the Bible said if any man speaks let him speak as the Oracles of God Amen or hallelujah that means it's the logos coming out a man jesus said the words that I speak they are spirit and they are life we got a lot of words that are out there that are just dead trees but when Jesus speaks them they are spirit and they are life oh man now that you see the power of God's breath in the in divine inspiration is shown throughout the Bible God breathed the breath of life into Adam amen Jesus breathed upon his disciples and said receiving the Holy Ghost and my Peter said where that the prophecy never had its origin in the will of man but men spoke from God as they were moved by the spirit it was God breathing through the through those men of God and rent speaking his word so these are the types of the scripture but every son God is born of the word of God so therefore they too are God breathed a man and it's when God breathed eternal the breath of eternal life until now I want you to go back to Revelation 19 and 9 and let's look carefully at the scripture that defines the bride blessed are they that are called into the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God now let's just go back to what it says these are the true words of God these are the true logos of God and remember the logos comes out from his breath he breathes his word are you with me he breathed his breath and more sons are born a man he breathed in the Adam and he received eternal life he breathed into the church and even the Turks receive the eternal life he breathes into you and you received the Holy Ghost eternal life is that right amen but I want you to notice these that are going to the marriage supper they are the true sayings of God none are you you didn't get what I said these that go in the marriage supper they are the true sayings of God they are the true Word of God amen because they are God breed they are God's own word we're not you're saying Junction's not saying what I've said is true and it's the true Word of God he said deeds that go to the marriage supper they are the true letters of God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we can believe in miracles hallelujah because the locust we are that we can live right because the world is a power in us there's somebody with me now because these that go in the marriage supper they are the true words there are other words but this is a true word there are other gospel but this is a true gospel you generation hallelujah you are the logos those that are called or the true logos they are the thoughts of God breathe a word is the thoughts of God breathe if it isn't breath it never comes word but when God breathes it out of his thoughts and it comes from thoughts and conveyed by the wind of his spirit it becomes word and when you came from hallelujah where you were once only in the thoughts of the flower the lonely God are you in there now but all now you are now made manifest and become God breathe that what God has in his thought have been propelled by a spirit to the stage of time to be the work demonstrated for your age and your time [Music] [Applause] Jesus was at rubra Word of God and the bride will be the true Word of God Jesus was the true lamb in comparison to the woolly lamb somebody help me preach now a man he was the true lamb now that lamb was true but this is the true lamb in comparison to the woolly lamb the woolly lamb was only temporary it only worked for a time but Jesus was the true lamb this was a lamb but this was a true lamb it's somebody with me now and this is these are the true sayings of God this is where we come back to where the scene was that this is a to grind just like the original grain this is not the in-between where the light passes through the stuff but what was in the beginning is mallet again what was it aware that pinnacle is not the word at the end time okay are the true sayings of God hallelujah hallelujah a man the others that never come to a full birth that go as far as confession our conception of belief of Christ but are never born of his breath no this is what's going to happen with the church because in the church there's been too many rotten eggs because the church hadn't been with the real mate they never received the junk of life are you with me and this has been the problem is that the babies has come to the birth but the church hasn't had the strength to bring forth so in Luther's time you know it was time it was it was time that should have been a birth but they didn't have strength to bring it so they brought it just as far as justification who s slow it brings us a virus sanctification and Pentecost would bring us as far as the restoration of the gifts but in this day there's strength to bring forth birth there's a church that has being born of the word and these are the true sayings of God that's who you are and not only that but when he did since you're the word he granted that you be arrayed in the righteousness of the saints remember you know a lot of customs in the wedding time is something borrowed something blue something whatever I don't remember all the slowly saying somebody someone wants something that one of these girls are no but anyway do you know let me just tell you for this minute the Bible said he granted that you be arrayed in the righteousness of the saints did you notice he didn't say my righteousness he said the righteousness of the saints of course it's his righteousness but do you realize the righteousness that was in Abraham come on let's come back for a minute Abraham I mean excuse me Jesus he was not the woolly lamb he was the true lamb we're not Abraham we're the true Abraham Abraham was only prophesied of us we are the word he was prophesied about he was prophesied are you with me now he was prophesied that he would go from them from faith into grace into the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the meat melih him to the chains of the body he prophesied your whole life and it's late right out in Abraham's life but I want you to know you are not wearing the the sins of Abraham you are not wearing the unbelief of Abraham come on church you're not wearing where he lied hey man your children tell the [Applause] children so that all of the scripture that spoke of the bride you are here fulfilling of you because you are God you can be filled with the rushing mighty wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and they were filled with the breath of God send your feet let's worship God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus amen all breath of God breathe on me a man born of the breath born of the breath born of the breath amen not going in the tribulation I've been born pouring of the breath hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus father take the words that were spoken today
