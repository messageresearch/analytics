taken place and some that are scheduled so we just want to keep those close to our hearts Amen brother Joe [Music] amen we have sister Nancy uh who put a prayer request in this evening her sister just recently lost her husband and has many physical issues so she's needing prayer we also got a request this evening from sister Trish Pruitt in regards to Elijah he came down with an ear infection or earache on Sunday and a lot of pain going in his neck they're going to do a virus panel I think this coming up week she's got a lot of pain in his legs and his stomach coming up to his neck so we just want to remember him in prayer and pray that he gets relief and sister Erica Park is about to enter a new phase of her treatment and she writes in and asks for some prayer for that so she's headed to Nashville for treatment tomorrow they give us some kind of name it's IV radiation but it targets the cancer cells wherever they are in the body and says with it comes Usual Suspects of symptoms but I'm believing for a maximum cancer busting effects and minimum side effects that's how you go to the doctor you believe in maximum cancer defeating effects but very minimum side effects so we just want to join with her she has four of these treatments every eight weeks and she just requests us to join in with prayer and brother Wilson had surgery yesterday and he's in a lot of pain with his knee so we want to remember him in prayer and sister Lily many you may know she had like what they would call a stroke-like symptom uh the doctor said the symptoms looked like a stroke but there it's actually a rare symptom of severe migraine called hemiplegia and it numbs the body so she had another episode of that yesterday I think I think it was yesterday maybe or today actually so she's in ICU and she really needs our prayer and uh you know we got Jesus on the main line we just need to tell them what we want you know we believe that God's a Healer so let's let's ask God to do what he

Zion have been sung lordly worshiping you and we lord we have you on the main line right now and I believe Lord that the king of Heaven just dropped down into this room today and God we can ask

and the union together of a couple and it was wonderful to see brother Wendell in their church and how they operated and pulled together she didn't she doesn't have a a mother but uh they pulled together and and gave her a mother and that was staying for her and and to do things for her and I believe that's wonderful to have a body of Christ that'll stand for you when you have lackings but they'll make up for him amen so and then we had wonderful Services there as well and uh the Lord really moved and and done some wonderful things but we're back home here tonight and I I was able to watch a little bit of Sunday and man just looked like y'all had a wonderful time and in the presence of God and and I believe that we ought to be participators and not just Spectators amen amen because God is doing some wonderful things in this hour moving in some wonderful ways and and so we want to be a part of and put our shoulder to the wheel in every way possible uh this weekend we're having our fall festival just a time of Fellowship together this Saturday and there's been some announcements and things but uh we want to encourage you to sign up to make a cake or a pie I know there's some good Cooks in this house amen and we only got just a few of them and that only means there's only going to be just a few people get dessert and so we want to just do everything we can to have a wonderful time last year was just over the top and and I know that there's there's brothers that can make these or sisters that can make these there's uh young people that can make these and so if you would right after church put your name down for that and it would be a wonderful blessing to all to enjoy there's going to be prizes for those things too it's not just going to be for the

prayers before we read the word of God father we're so thankful Lord to be in your presence and Lord for your word to be real to us Lord and in this time and age that we live in Lord when so many Lord are going into outer darkness and and to weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth Lord we've been called into the light the light of your word and God what a privileged people We Are Tonight Lord we don't want to take that for granted Lord but father we want to to appreciate it and thank you thank you for the call in our lives thank you Lord that we're not Lord just to ship out on the ocean bobbing up and down with no hope to no guide No Light No just lost and undone but Lord we're here tonight father because we have a call in our hearts and a love for your word and a love for and a passion for the things of God we ask Lord you'll bless us in this time in this season Lord you bless each heart that's here tonight father we want to remember our pastor tonight it's not feeling well we ask that you would strengthen him strengthen his body we ask you in Jesus name amen turn to Romans 1 and verse 16. amen had a again I don't know it seems like it happens to me more than I like for it to happen but by five o'clock today the Lord changes my my thought and so on we're just going to speak on thankful thankful Romans 1 and verse 16 said for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God and the Salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is manifesting them for God has showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead and so that they are that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish Hearts would darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and change the glory of the uncorruptable god into the image made like to corruptable man and to the birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness to the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up into vile affections for even their women to change the natural use that into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burning their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receive it in themselves that recompense of the era which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetness maliciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit malignity Whispers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventor of evil things disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who know in the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them amen will let you be seated this evening also want to look in second Timothy verse chapter 3 and verse 1. it says we also we know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own self Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinence Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away amen just want to look at this word as on thankful because you know as we know we're coming into a season that's been set aside or was set aside to remember the things that God has done and so I I thought it was interesting how Paul would put this in the middle of of the invisible things of God being understood by what was made or by the creation that a man something that was created could have the understanding of it or the understanding or the knowledge of the invisible God that that he would allow himself to be shown to them that he would allow himself to be made manifest to his creation but in turn his creation would not think that this would be important or would not be thankful amen that God would come and he would show himself and he would become human he would become man and he would he would give of himself and they became unthankful and they they actually begin in in becoming unthankful they begin to bring forth things that were created like beasts and four-footed beasts and birds and creeping things and begin to exalt them above the Living God and begin to worship the creature more more than the Creator and that's that's backwards because the Creator is greater than the create creation amen and so uh you know it's so his glory the glory that he deserved they begin to give it to something undeserving because they were unthankful for who he was and what he was doing for them and how he was moving in their hearts and lives and you know I got to thinking about our Thanksgiving Day and and I got to looking at some things people were writing about it many are being making it very aware that Thanksgiving day as it approaches there's not much about it in the news there's not much said about it there's not much discussion there's more discussion about Halloween and and then the Black Friday sales following Thanksgiving or the day after Thanksgiving then more than Thanksgiving Day itself he said you know this man said is this American national holiday not important anymore why is Thanksgiving being forgotten and said when Thanksgiving first became a national holiday in 1863 President Abraham Lincoln called it a day of Thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens President Lincoln Proclamation also said the year that is drawing towards as close as close has been filled with blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies to these bounties which are so constantly enjoyed that we're prone to forget the source from which they come others have have been added ever by the ever and other other benefits have been added by the ever watchful Providence of almighty God Lincoln would continue said no human cancer Council has devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things but they are only the gracious gifts of the most high God it has it has seemed and you know it said it seemed to me uh fit and proper proper that they should be solemnly reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American people so why is our American leaders or or even America average Americans you know why don't they even talk like this anymore they're not thankful they don't even want to acknowledge God in their thoughts they don't want to acknowledge God in their speeches or or acknowledge God in the things that they say and he said you know one of the reasons we have forgotten how to be thankful the intent of this holiday was to be thankful for the blessings from God the idea of being thankful should impress upon us that we are unobserved undeserving of so many good things that we have received but do we understand this today and you know and it says you know they say the Black Friday sales dominate the thoughts of many during Thanksgiving season it seems that many would rather focus on getting things for themselves than focusing on giving thanks to God where all these blessings come from today an attitude of entitlement has replaced the attitude of things thankfulness for many Americans many talk about how they deserve their fair share how they expect certain things or how they how they have a right to have benefits instead of focusing on God and showing appreciation many focus on themselves and their personal wants and many people focus inwardly and they forget to be thankful you know you know he said this man said as a child I was taught to say thank you amen for some of the most simple acts of kindness like someone holding the door for me he said but today you can hold a door for a young generation one of the younger generations and they'll walk right through a door held for them and not acknowledge the kindness that had been shown to them he said if we as parents aren't setting the example of showing thankfulness how can we expect our children to be thankful hey man let's bring that right on I ain't talking about a door being held open for you that's right there in front of you but there has been a door that's been given to us has been opened unto us amen a revelation has been opening to us how can we not be thankful for what God has given us it's more than just a knowledge it's more than just a head knowledge it's more than just you know just a number on a Pew but God has actually given us the revelation of this hour Amen to show us who we are and we who we are and we ought to be the most thankful people not that our our heads are in the clouds and look who we are and who I am and look what God's made us know God has shown me his benefits he has given me his grace he he has given me his Mercy therefore I'm thankful for it and you want your children to be thankful well then you need to start being thankful and you need to start expressing your Thanksgiving unto God and what God has done for you in your life and what how God has moved in your heart I wonder how many children tonight have heard the testimonies of their mothers and their fathers of their Thanksgiving that God helped them cross across an old ocean and on an old ship and they may have went down in defeat but God rich in Mercy allowed them to come and land Upon A firm ground a firm foundation I ain't talking about pilgrims hundreds of years ago I'm talking about us tonight have you told your children how thankful you are of how God has brought you out of sin and out of darkness and out of things of this world and put you on a place that you can stand a place that you can have an assurity that you're not going to fall back from that you're not going to go back but you're going to go forward and you're going to press toward the mark of the high quality have they seen that Thanksgiving in your heart hallelujah amen the Bible foretold as we read of people that would become so self-absorbed and unthankful as we say lovers of themselves lovers of money posters I'm thankful it's amazing he put that right in the middle of all what we would consider big sins and and homosexuality yes let's see but right in the middle of it unthankful amen this really struck me as I began to think on it about five o'clock amen perhaps this is why Black Friday sales dominate the thoughts of many during Thanksgiving season it seems that many would rather focus on getting things for themselves than giving thanks to God he said why he said why is that because we have forgotten God I don't even know if this man's a Christian maybe he must be he said but we have forgotten to acknowledge God's blessings therefore we will start to believe that the things we are we enjoy are solely the results of our own efforts come on now that is a dangerous way of thinking that you're here because you're you've done something we're not here because we've done something we're here because of the grace of almighty God [Applause] you're sitting on these pews not because you're somebody or just because you made yourself something in life you're sitting here because it's of the unmerited favor and Grace of almighty God therefore we should always be thankful to be able to sit on those pews but when people begin to begin to think well I just do it myself and I'm doing this myself it's all about and it's just bro it's just so and so and he's just doing it himself and they become unthankful for the place God has put them it's a dangerous way of thinking notice how even God would warn the children of Israel he says when you have eaten this is in Deuteronomy chapter 8 when you have eaten and are full then you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land which he has given you Deuteronomy 8 and 10 I believe that he has given you beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping his Commandments his judgments his statues which I command you to today lest when you have eaten and are full and built beautiful houses and dwell in them and when your herds and your flocks multiplying your silver and gold are multiplied and all that you have is Multiplied then you lift your heart is lifted up and you forget the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt then you say in your heart by power and the might of my hand have I gained this wealth this is where America is they forgot the Simplicity of how it all began that that God raised this nation up they forgot why that it even started and now it's not the freedom of religion it's the freedom from religion instead of feeling self-important we should have the same mindset as David would have who said to God who am I O Lord God and what is my house that you have brought me this far man that's worth reading again ain't it that's in second Samuel 7 verse 18. who am I oh Lord God and what is my house that you have brought me this far that I have come to this place who am I always remembering God is the source of our blessings it helps us to stay humble and not take things for granted he said unfortunately as we look at America we see a country that seems to be losing blessings the nation faces multiple internal and external problems and solutions seems non-existent could it be that God has removing his blessings he has given to this nation this is them saying this of course we know that's true this is a natural consequence of a Nation forgetting God Jeremiah 18 says because my people have forgotten me they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways because they forgot where it all came from but even though the United States and other nations may be unthankful we can determine to make our life one of Thanksgiving to God amen for all the blessings he has given to me and my family amen it all comes from him everything that you have today I don't care if it's the shoes on your feet the socks the pants the shirt the dress amen the hair the body whatever it all comes from him Every Blessing as big or as my new it all comes from him [Applause] well Branham talks about Lazarus he said when he left his home he said as soon as Jesus leaves a home sickness left the home sickness set in and sorrow said in listen Christian when Jesus leaves your home sickness and trouble was set in right behind him when he leaves your home get ready for trouble because it's on the road you welcome him into your home you let him be the Unseen guest sat down at the table and never eat without thanking him for it he said I see many people call themselves Christians never return things just as a litter as a Hogan or apple tree a hall can sit on the apple tree and Apple's true can beat him in the head all day long and he'll eat till he can't grunt no more hardly but he'll never look up to see where they're coming from that's exactly the truth people have become unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent fears all of these other things begin to come because of unthankfulness so here we are living today the Pentecost was getting right into it your Holiness people going right into it just head long what a sad sight he said well I guess he said well I guess I'm a pretty good Christian brother Branham you can't be a pretty good Christian there's no such a thing you're either be a Christian or you're not a Christian amen a grain of wheat or a grain of salt a weed can't be barley today and wheat tomorrow it's a week today it's a week for always and a man that's become a Christian is not a Christian today and a sinner tomorrow and a Christian today and a sinner tomorrow he seemed like Christ yesterday today and forever Hallelujah because he's become a Son of God and a nation we are called a Christian Nation well the reason we're called that is because we hold that name but just be in that name doesn't expel us from the judgments of God Amen he talks about how things begin though he said look he said he said look look at look at all the things that begin to take place Upon This Nation he said each year is moving on and moving on and what is it they're more and more forgetting God they're more and more forgetting God that's the main thing friends we got plenty to eat we got plenty to wear we gotta find automobiles we're the most prosperous nation in the world in the midst of it all we don't look to where it comes from he said it's like a hog under apple tree he'll eat apples all day long they'll beat him in the head and he'll never look up for which way they're coming it's just the way we are we're just God will pour His blessings upon us and we'll never look up to say Thank You Lord I'm so glad to be here Lord thank you that you give me something to eat Lord thank you that you're not moving Upon My Heart Lord [Applause] we just go ahead just like he owed it to us we owe it to him he owes us nothing we all we are all we are to him another place he says when your eyes come open you can see he said you might can hear when your eyes are closed but when your eyes come open you can see then when your eyes are open we can see the goodness of the Lord there's many times that God has walked with you he's kept you from the wreck he's brought you from the hospital and we go on like a hog Under The Apple Tree just a southern expression apples will beat him in the head all day long he'll just grab them and eat them and never look up where they're coming from that's the way many Christians do the blessings of the Lord falling all around them and they never get on their knees to recognize it come from God what a Pity it is need to be open another reason I should be open is when we come to the house of the Lord we see a spirit moving and Performing just the way he said it was done and we sat with our eyes closed and act like nothing's happening he said I know that's true they sat with their eyes closed as well I don't know it could be just some mental telepathy it can be just a fortune teller but if your eyes was open Jesus would come by and say it's me it's my word and you would begin to thank him for his goodness and appreciate him for all that he's done for you Hallelujah sometime ago way down in the Southlands he said there was a minister of the Gospel he had a man that worked for him a colored man I called him Gabe his right name was Gabriel but they call him Gabe for short he was a good fella but he just couldn't get lined up with the Lord he said no matter what we would do he would just get out of line he liked to play dice and cards and drink a little whiskey and he just couldn't stay lined up okay he'd like to hunt real well but he couldn't hit nothing couldn't shoot this is endured to his heart this is really good so the pastor of this certain church he liked to hunt also so one day when they'd been out hunting and they got shot they had shot so much game to the rabbits and the birds were hanging all over them late in the evening they were coming up a long little path and no one had said nothing for a few minutes and old Gabe just loaded down with game title along the path after a while he tapped a minister on his shoulder he said Parson he said tears were running down his cheeks he said partially you know what I'm going to do I was going to do no Gabe what you're going to do I was coming down to your church Sunday morning I'm going to find my position my right right down at the mourner's bench and I'm going to come in and fellowship in the church and I'm going to live true to a god Till I Die Pastor rather upset that this quick decision came from Gabe after after for years trying to persuade those fellow to become a Christian he said Dave you don't know how much I appreciate that how happy I am but Mom for your decision but there's one thing that's bothered me after all my preaching and I picked you up on the street and took your wife home when he was drunk to keep keep you from getting arrested and all these things I've done and still couldn't get you to comment and come to church and be saved what what made the sudden change he said boss you know I was a poor shot and I couldn't hit one rabbit but look here at these rabbits and game that has given me surely he must love me or he would have never gave me one it's simple it's simple but if you only knew the poor the blessings you possess and where they come from the clothes you eat and the out of the wearing the food you eat he said if you'd ever once been out on a mission field and seen them just rake out of the garbage and do those things he said oh God I my I begin to realize the goodness of God how many people that would be in Hell tonight that's sitting in these seats when you're sitting that would give anything to come back and said again and have one more opportunity he said the goodness of God and we take it for granted he's so good to come to us on these last days and call us out of sin call us out of denominations call us out of every device everything every kind of entertainment all kind of and my goodness the goodness of God is revealed and we sat and stare at it like a Mueller looking at a new gate foreign he says are we guilty of eating good food enjoying good sight wearing good clothes driving good cars living in a great nation going to a good school and all the blessings we're enjoying and yet we never really thank him for him amen it's getting better while we're enjoying these blessings each one feeling this presence and saying amen praise God hallelujah and so forth and that in that we can remember the one that brought all this to us and made it all possible the death of the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God remember him I think that's what many times he said one time you know I was amazed when I went with a bunch of Christians of a certain church and they sat down to eat never returned thanks for their food I thought that's kind of strange went to another house and they just sat down and ate and didn't say nothing God provides any owl he said what about us he said I think it pays for us to stop and look up and see where these things are coming for from and how glorious it is to remember our Lord how glorious it is to remember our Lord and remember that there was no one else that could make this possible there is nothing could make it possible but our Lord and he so freely did it was no worthy person there was no Prophet there was no sage no potentate no Monarch no King no one could do it but the Lord Jesus himself and he's so willingly did it for us let's just remember he's done it what he's done for us it's starting to go through quite a bit of scriptures in Ephesians 5 and verse 15 see him then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is and be not drunk with wine we're in his excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns what the will of the Lord is speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things ouch giving thanks always for all thanks you mean the trials I'm supposed to give thanks you all things work together for the good to them that are the called according to his purpose how many are they called then it's all working for you good so you can thank him for it God you brought me to the to this trial but I know that you brought me you're not going to leave me but you're gonna take me through it and when I get on the other side it'll be precious as gold amen Colossians 1 12 says giving thanks unto the father for what because he's made me meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and Light hallelujah what does that make me it's made me sufficient it's rendered me fit it's equipment with adequate power to perform duties that's necessary he equipped me he made me meet I'm giving him thanks because he gave me the ability to have an inheritance and not the inheritance of darkness and the Darkness of Darkly on the sin of hell that's not my inheritance but my inheritance is with the Saints and lies so therefore I can give thanks and who has delivered us from the power of dark there ought to be some Thanksgiving going on right now he has delivered me from the power of darkness and has translated to the kingdom of his dear son and whom we have Redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin that's something to be thankful about Hebrews 13 1 let Brotherly Love continue be not forgetful to un entertain strangers for therefore thereby some have entertained angels unaware remember them that are in bonds as bounded with them oh don't just remember I remember brother so-and-so over there and such and such he's in bonds no remember them have such a compassion that you can feel the pain and the things that yourself and then they suffer adversity as being yourself also in the body wow isn't it hit me upside the head I hadn't never read this apparently but when you're praying for someone it ain't just remember so and so remember so but you're entering into amen into a a moment of uh what's the word I'm looking for I know there's a word huh intercession that's the word of thank you intercession for them how do you do that because you have to actually enter into their body into what they're going through them that suffer adversity being yourself also and therefore if you was in that body you would be praying as one in that body if you had cancer you'd be praying like one who had cancer so he's saying pray for them as if you have what they have and be thankful that you don't marriage is Honorable and all in the bed undefiled whose whoremongers and adulterers God will judge let your conversation be without covetness and be content with such things as ye have well you mean you don't understand my situation well I don't but he does amen made mention of this it's just very powerful because as I answer any questions about whatever situation you find yourself Jesus has already dealt with it here's what I don't know about yeah he said he was tempted in all things so no matter what you're finding yourself in he's already been there brother Danny steamer was just up at I'd heard the story before but he brought it up to my attention again of a man when he was there and brother Ron's I was listening to him just a couple weekends ago and he said it was a man who was dealing with a homosexual spirit I actually went out and and and and had an affair with another man that this this man was a supposed to be a believer a message believer and this other man was a nomination denominational believer but they wanted to be right they knew that they'd done wrong and they wanted to make everything right and be delivered they wanted to be delivered so this man came to his pastor and he said well telling them about you know they come and trying to trying to get get deliverance and he finally looked at his Pastor he said I don't know why I'm coming to you because you can't help me you don't know what it's like to deal with what I'm dealing with Pastor said you know what he was right I didn't know I didn't know what to say he said I he was exactly right I couldn't say yeah I've I've done that or even come closer even had those kind of thoughts he said I just I couldn't say anything he said I just kind of bowed my head like Lord what now he said a voice spoke to him and said you tell him I have he was tempted in all things so he knows what it likes so when you find yourself in an uncontented State be content with such things as you have for he has said I will never leave you or forsake you we can raise our hands tonight I guarantee you every one of us no doubt is maybe five of us are dealing with the same thing but I'd say more most likely we all have different things we deal with but with whatever position you find yourself in tonight he has said I will never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll be with you to the end of the world therefore we can have Thanksgiving in the middle of our situation so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what men shall do unto me remember them which I rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today do you know what that seven means children that means remember them who have rule be thankful for Godly Parents just had to stop there for a minute be thankful for Godly Parents well yeah they got these stupid rules are they really stupid or are they keeping you from a wreck are they keeping you from some bad problems and situations and well they just won't let me do what I want to do there's a reason for that because if you did what you want to do you make a wreck out of your life I understand hey man amen well you know I've seen that one day you know teenagers need to move out while they got it all figured out and got it all you know just move on out but listen if you did many of you would find yourself drug addicts and wrecks don't don't be resentful the hand that's guiding you be thankful for them that have rule over you who has spoken unto you the word of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever be not cared about what divers and strange doctrines but it's a good thing that the heart be established with great it's not with me Grace with not with Meats which have not profit them that have occupied their end we have an altar wherever we have no right to eat we serve the Tabernacle for the bodies of these beasts those whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin will burn without the camp wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gay let us go therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City be thankful but we seek one to come by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise or Thanksgiving to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name it's a sacrifice it hurts first Thessalonians 5 18 and says in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you wow well that pretty much locks it down for me in everything give thanks for this is the will of God concerning you if your situation need to be changed got to change it he's got the he's got power to do so he's a career Creator not the creation but many times a creation wants the power of the Creator and to make moves and make eye a handle think they got it all figured out listen it ain't just children to make mistakes adults make them too amen but why not why because they tried to play the part of God instead of just being thankful and content God you've put me in this place for now or whatever you know what I'm saying I understand if you're getting a place where there you know you can go a lot of different directions don't don't go to seed on this stuff some people get in a church and they're preaching false Doctrine well I'm just going to be content and all you find your church that preaches the truth because what he said if I remember correct let me go back up there remember them which have rule over you which have spoken unto you the word of God amen second Thessalonians 2 and verse 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you bro Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through the sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth that's something to be thankful for because God from the beginning chose you therefore no matter what the devil's done it cannot unchoose you I'm gonna read from second Corinthians 9 and verse 6 but this will be the Amplified so now remember this who who so sparingly will also reap sparingly and he also sows generally generously that blessings may come to others will also reap generously and be blessed Let each one give thoughtfully and with purpose just as he has decided in his heart not grudgingly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver and delights in the one whose heart is in his gift and God is able to make all Grace every favor and Earthly blessing come in abundance to you hello somebody y'all y'all hearing what I'm reading God is able to make all Grace every favor and Earthly blessing come in abundance to you so that you may always under all circumstances regardless of any need have complete sufficiency in everything being completely self-sufficient in him [Applause] and have an abundance for every good work and act of Charity as it is written in Forever remains written he the benevolent and generous person scattered abroad and he gave to the poor his righteousness endures forever now he who provides seed to the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed for sowing that is your resources he will multiply it he will increase the Harvest of your righteousness which shows itself as an act of goodness kindness and love you will be enriched in every way so that you may be generous and this generosity administered through us is producing Thanksgiving to God from those who benefit my God Amen what you give actually is producing Thanksgiving out of others who benefit to God not to you but the God who gave it to you to give Mercy for the ministry of this service offering is not only supplying the needs of the Saints God's people but it's also overflowing through many expressions of Thanksgiving to God did you hear that God is doing this so he can be praised why do you think you give your tithes and offerings people people become unthankful about that and becomes a burdensome thing and well that preacher is doing this and the preacher is doing it don't matter what the preacher is doing that's God's money if you give it as unto the Lord is is between the preacher and the god what he does with it you did what you were supposed to do therefore if he did and with a thankful heart with what you were supposed to do God will do what he's supposed to do but if you come with bitterness and worry and this that and the other thing well they're just doing this and they're doing that and I don't approve how I can't tell you how many people give tithes like that I ain't necessarily talking about here we got some wonderful folks that give give us unto the Lord as you can see because of this act of ministry what up I got I got a minister yeah it's called the ministry of giving because of this act of Ministry they will glorify God for your obedience to the gospel of Christ which you confess as well as your generous participation in this gift for them and for all the other believers in need and they also long for you while they pray on your behalf because of the surpassing measure of God's grace his undeserved favor mercy and blessing which is revealed in you now thanks be to God for this Indescribable gift which is precious beyond words and everything give thanks no matter what the situation well brother Timothy I'll tell you what when the days are good and the skies are blue I can really praise God knows when it's all cloudy and shattered showers are everywhere and rainstorms and thunder and Lightnings and your world's turned upside down you can still praise God it's called a sacrifice of praise amen amen that's what God really Longs for that's why God allows you to go in those places so he'll see what your reaction is going to be all right well let's read about it Jonah 1 and verse 17. now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights chapter two then Jonah prayed in the Lord to the Lord God out of the fish's belly what prayed and a belly of a whale Darkness all around and fish guts stinking rotten I mean they ain't hardly nothing smells worse than a fish it's the truth I mean you get a rotten fish it stinks this wasn't a good proper place to praise God but that wasn't what God was looking at and said I cried by the reason my Affliction of the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried eye and thou hearest my voice for thou has come to me in the deep in the midst of the Sea and the floods come past me about all thy Billows and waves passed over me then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward thy Holy Temple and the waters could pass me about even to the soul and depths closed around about me and weeds were wrapped about my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountains the Earth with their bars about me forever yet has I brought up my life from corruption oh Lord my God and when my soul fainted with me I remember the Lord and my prayer came unto thee and thy Holy Temple they that observe lion vanities forsake their own Mercy but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving and I will pay that that I about salvation is of the Lord and the Lord speak unto the fish and it bothered him out of Jonah out on dry land what if he'd never gave that sacrifice of praise he would have become more than Wells vomit I'll leave you with that one to figure out he had been processed it had been over and there's plenty of wrecks and stenches unto the Lord because they failed to offer him the sacrifice of praise of Thanksgiving then in the middle of my situation I still got two hands I still got two eyes that see his salvation I still got two ears that hear the goodness of God I'm still a witness of what he's doing Among Us I still see what God is doing Psalms 136 is a whole chapter of Thanksgiving oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever oh give thanks unto the god of God for his Mercy endurethra oh give thanks to the Lord of lords for his mercy and there you can get the hint oh give thanks oh give thanks to him who alone does great wonders give thanks to him by the wisdom made the heavens give thanks to him the stretches out the Earth above the waters give thanks to him that made great life the son to rule by day the moon and stars rule by night he to give thanks to him that smote Egypt in their firstborn that brought Israel from among them with a strong hand with a stretched out arm to him that divided the red seed and made Israel a pass to the midst of overthrew Pharaoh on his host them that led his people through the Wilderness to him the smoke great king and slew famous Kings if we give them thanks for Sion and OG and he gave their land for inheritance and inheritance under Israel is servant who remembered us in our lowest state but his mercy endureth forever give thanks who giveth food to All Flesh give thanks that he has redeemed us from our enemies oh give thanks unto God Of Heaven for his Mercy endures forever plenty of reasons to thank him Psalms 140 13 says surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name and the upright shall dwell in thy presence first chronicles 16 8 says give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people that's why we constantly remind of what God has done in our generation brother Branham did it almost out after every service he began to testify and praise God and thank God it was always a testimony nearly every service what was it he was reminded and making known God's Deeds among the People Sing unto him sing songs of them talk give is all of his wondrous Works glory in His holy name and let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord in his strength seek his face continually remember His Marvelous works that he has done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth oh ye seed of Israel is servant you children of Jacob his chosen ones his chosen ones he is the Lord Our God his judgments are in the Earth and all the Earth be mindful always of his Covenant and the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations even of the Covenant which he made of Abraham and his oath unto heising and it confirmed the same to Jacob for the law in Israel for an Everlasting Covenant say it unto thee I will give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance when you were few even a few and strangers in it and when they went from Nation to Nation one Kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved Kings for their sake saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm Hallelujah sing unto the Lord all the Earth show forth from day to day is salvation

moved let the heavens be glad and let the Earth Rejoice let men say among the nation the Lord reigneth let the sea Roar and the fullness thereof let the fields rejoice and all that is therein then shall the Trees of wood sing out at the presence of the Lord because he cometh to judge the Earth all give thanks unto the Lord for he is good in his mercy and do Earth forever and say ye save us o God our Salvation gather us together and Deliver Us from the Heathen that we may give thanks in the holy name and Glory into thy praise blessed be the Lord God of Israel forever and ever and all the people said and praise the Lord Hallelujah he's worthy to be praised hallelujah how many is To Zion tonight it says in Isaiah 53 and 3 51-3 for the Lord shall Comfort Zion he will Comfort all her waste places he will make her Wilderness like Eden and her deserts like the garden of joy and joy of the garden of the Lord and joy and gladness shall be found therein what Thanksgiving and the voice of Melody wow Psalms 94 5 and verse 1.

well you ain't you must you must have had something good for dinner boy I tell you what you show up at no God really spoke to me we need to be thankful this nation is forgetting where she came from and so will every person be the same as she if they forget where they came from and where God brought them from they get so elevated until they know more than the preacher they know more than this and they got it all figured out and they give up their seat and they walk away why because of unthankfulness come let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving well it ain't all it ain't all the way I want it that ain't what he said he said come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God how many can testify that tonight and a

Thanksgiving brother Brandon would preach one of us it would be his last Thanksgiving service in Shreveport Louisiana and you preach on the invisible Union of the bride of Christ go listen to it he said this is he said I want to preach on the invisible Union of the bride of Christ it doesn't sound like a Thanksgiving message though we're thankful he said I'm thankful to God to be living in this time the closing scenes of this world's history if I would have to have a say so before the foundation of the world when God would laid out a whole program to me and said I want you to preach now what age do you desire to go to Earth to preach I would have chose this age this is the Golden Age I certainly would have loved to been there during this time of his visit on Earth but still I think this right now is a greater time because it's the time that he's coming to take people that he's redeemed he's nearing the resurrection with all the redeemed will come forth what a glorious opportunity we have to speak to a dying people a great time we're enthused about it he said we know that history is closing out world's history will soon be over and we'll step into a New Day to a great Millennium as one believer in a millennium a millennium reign with Christ a thousand years on earth a physical Return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood he said we've got a lot to be thankful for you say well what you may say well what's this got to do with Thanksgiving what are you talking about you didn't say nothing about Thanksgiving as he comes to the end of it he said what a message for the occasion to me he said the pilgrim fathers were thankful for the old Newfound for their Newfound way of life being separated from the old English denominations and Creeds they can marry a new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed word for their age for their day and he said so can we be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourselves from the things of the world and all of our Associates as Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all dead religions he said I'm speaking Across the Nation now all dead Creeds he separated us and opened to us a new land a new message for this day Pentecost is dry to Lutheran the wrestling and the rest of them's dried up there's no no more than a bunch of churches they're just all dried up good people in there what has yet to come out wow what did he do he opened up to us a new land he opened up the Seven Seals and he gave us a message showed us where we're at showed us where we're going showed us who we are and who he is the seven sealed revealing himself in this hour is blessed Revelation he said we got a lot to be thankful for Hallelujah he said my he says see he says he said see that God pulling himself a bride elected God is calling the elected is it all down through there I'm just pulling out some highlights he said calling The Virtuous bride the word the last day Church the elected Lady of our Lord Jesus amen Christ he said wow the bride was always part of the bridegroom so the bride will never be part of that denomination note sir she's always part of him and he's calling her to his side we got a lot to be thankful for Oh my he said we used to be associated with this and that and this and that one husband we used to be married but God annoyed it all he took it all away and he put his name Upon Us amen he wrote oh he wrote him he said he said he wrote it and he annihilated it and he took his sins and he put him in the sea of forgetfulness he'd go on and say listen you're Justified he said that's not just a word he said it's a dog you've never done it in the first place that's a message of Thanksgiving that I know what I've done but by by the thoughts of God I've never done it in the first place we got a lot to be thankful because if we would put our own thoughts to it we'd still think well I ain't never going to be worthy enough I'll never make it I'll never go to the top I'll never make a Rapture by our own thoughts you never will but by his thoughts he said it and he said I look at you I don't call you church I call you bride and I'm calling you out and I'm placing you a laugh that you can have real Thanksgiving in and you can thank him for healing you can thank you for Joy you can thank him for the Holy Ghost you can thank him for all of it because it's all in the land Hallelujah Hallelujah God has cut the old life off my God there's so much in here he goes into the eagle story he said thankful you once was in a hole pen or a chicken pen Walling around trying to figure out where your next meal was coming from but all of a sudden one day you heard an eagle scream and it lifted your head up oh man that kind of looks like me that's what I that's what I've been looking for I knew I didn't look like that chicken and that chicken over there and that thing I knew that why can't I wasn't making now it's making all sin and he begins to scream to you come on up a little higher come on up a little higher you never was born you was never made for the chicken pen you might have been born in the chicken pin but that's not who you are you never was a chicken to begin with Hallelujah you never was a drunk to begin with you whatever was a dope smoker degree you never was a whoremonger to begin with that's not who you was in the mind of God but God knew down through this age and this old chicken pear called laodicea I have people down there and he sent a voice out an eagle that came flying over and began to scream out and he called you by name and you looked around said hey that's me I'm rising up I'm going higher I'm not staying here I'm not going to hell matter of fact hell was never made for me although All My Life The Devil told me that's where I was going that's where I was headed it was made for me that was the whole reason hell was made but I found out by the word of God it never was my place it never was where I was going and it's not where I'm going to enter path but I found out I'm going to a higher land I've been called to a higher place and I got something to thank God about because he didn't leave me where he found me but he reached out and then Omari clay and he pulled me up and he didn't get discouraged by the way I looked and all the things that hung off but he began to send the word and he watched me and he cleaned me and then he sent his spirit and he filled me with the Holy Ghost we got some things to be thankful for Hallelujah hey man we got a reason to scream we got a reason to shout and Mama evil can scream how can I can scream how can I keep thanking for all that he's done when the anointing word is being Vindicated how come I can't say thank you Lord [Applause] when I see what he's done for me I cannot tell it all I cannot tell it all because he has done so much he has done so much [Applause] hello somebody aren't you glad to be free of that old

that you was an eagle to begin with you was never a denominational chicken you knew there was something wrong there something happened but the bridegroom took your sins and he put him he took away all your shame that was a lot of shame in sin but when the bridegroom comes to the bride and said ah no no no that's not who you was that's right brother Joe he began to roll away the reproach and he rolled it all away [Music] I feel I kind of feel like Rahab when she stood there and was going to be married to that General and he said well this woman used to be this and she used to do this and they said well if that's so bro you got to bring her accusers because that's what though that's what the law says we're a woman where's your accusers well see that pile of rubble they're all back there they're all gone they're dead they had no more voice to give why because the bridegroom stepped in don't you think when that Revelation hit her [Music] that she had a right to be standing there
