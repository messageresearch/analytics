Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, we come to you today, Lord, so thankful. You are greater. You are mightier. You're more than able for any situation, any sickness, any struggle. Anything that we could ever go through or deal with, Father. You're greater. Lord, today we just come to you with our whole hearts, Lord. just open before you, Father, asking you to come, you to speak, you to touch you to minister, Lord, you to walk down the aisles of our heart, Lord, and touch those parts of our lives, Lord, that maybe we don't know what to do with or we don't know where to turn to, but God, we could just give them to you because you're greater. Lord, we give this service to you, everything to be said and done for your glory. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Turn to John chapter 5 and verse one. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Says, "After this, there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water. Whosoever then first after the trouble in the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. A certain man was there which had infirmity 30 and 8 years. And when Jesus saw him lie, he knew that he had been there a long time. in that case. And he said unto him, "Wilt thou be made whole?" And the impotent man answered him, saying, "Sir, I have no man when the waters troubled to put me in the pool, for while I'm coming, another stepeth down before me." And Jesus said unto him, "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk." And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked. And on the same day was the Sabbath. And the Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, it is the Sabbath day, is it not lawful for thee to carry thy bed? And he answered them, he that made me whole. The same said unto me, take up thy bed and walk. Then asked they him, what man is that which said unto thee, take up thy bed and walk? And he and he that was healed was not who it was? For Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. Afterward, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, "Behold, thou art made whole. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee." Amen. We let you be seated. This evening, once again, I'd like to speak to you on faith and action. As we our scripture here, as we read, it's actually a call to obedient faith. And obedient faith is a faith in action or a faith in motion. You know, the command that Jesus gave required action. He said to him, "Take up your bed and walk." The man had to believe the word of Jesus and then act on it and to move in faith before he ever had proof of his healing before he maybe even felt one thing. Amen. It was he didn't, you know, Jesus didn't tell him, "Well, when you feel better, then rise up or when you feel a little change, rise up." No, he just said, "Rise and take thy bed and walk." It was a direct call to put faith into action. It was not just an agreement of what he said or agreement in his mind that this is a good thought or a good thing, but to actually move. Amen. A faith that moves and not just a faith that believes. And you know in every account in through the scripture a person had to act on what Jesus said on his word. The paralytic in Mark chapter 2 you know did not argue. He did not hesitate. He did not test his legs first. The man at Bethesda in John 5 had been helpless for 38 years. Yet he moved at the command. So faith became real the moment action began. &gt;&gt; It became real the moment action began. And immediately and the scripture says immediately he rose and took up his bed and went before them all. You know as I said Jesus didn't say feel strength and then walk. He didn't say when you feel better walk. He said rise. It shows a b biblical principle here that the word comes first and then the action follows and then power meets you in your action. It meets you in motion. Amen. Just as Peter had to take to make the motion of stepping out of a boat. Amen. and the healed man had to stand up while trusting the word of God. What taking up the bed meant or symbolized also spoke of no return to that same old position. There was no place to retreat to. There was no going back to a former weakness. And this is what Jesus said, you know, don't disbelieve anymore unless a worse thing come upon you. In other words, there's no going back to this. There's there's no returning to this. It was a visible declaration that God has done something for me. So faith was no longer inward. It was a it was demonstrated in this man rising up and getting his bed and walking. Amen. Is a faith, you know, a faith that carries what once carried you. I'm thankful for that kind of faith. Amen. A faith that'll Amen. move in the moment. A faith that responds even when it looks like there is no way for anything to happen. A faith that'll move when everything seems unmovable. A faith that obeys even when the step feels impossible. Amen. What is it? The word speaks, but it needs a vessel to put it into action. Amen. Or other words, it's just dead letter. But it has to become a written epistle read unto all men. It's a it's an action. Jesus said to the sick of the Pauly, "Son, thy sins be forgiven. Arise, take up thy bed and walk." Nothing changed physically until Jesus spoke. So faith, Amen, began by hearing. As we know in Romans 10, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. And an action followed. This healed man responded in obedience. He didn't respond in discussion. He didn't respond in well, if I do this, then what will happen? But immediately he arose and he took his bed and he went forth. The miracle though was not activated by effort. It was activated by obedient response to the word that was given. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not about our efforts. I'm not trying to make it our efforts and what we do, but it's being obedient to respond to what the word has told you to do. Amen. So Jesus, Amen, like I said, consistently required movement. He would say to the withered hand, "Stretch forth thy hand." He didn't say when it felt better, you felt a little tingle or you felt something. He just said, "Stretch forth thy hand." And they would begin in that action. When they begin that action, then power met them in the motion. Amen. Go wash in the pool of Saleom. He would tell that to a blind man. That blind man walked there blind. He walked there and could not see. But he came away from there seeing. Why? Because power met him in his motion in in his action. Amen. When he told the disciples to launch out into the deep, what was it? They took action upon the word that was spoke and the power met them in their motion. It met them IN THEIR ACTION. GOD'S power is manifested when faith is put into action. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's all through the scriptures. Amen. and the 10 lepers in Luke 17:14, he told them to go show themselves to the priests. Now, if you'll follow the scriptures, as they went, they were cleansed. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't they were healed and then goes, "No, but as they they walked away from him lepers, but as they went, as they followed what the word said, then the power met them in the action. It met them in motion. as they begin to follow exactly what the word spoken to them. I believe tonight if we can get somebody to follow what the word spoke to them that the power of God will meet you in the action. It'll meet you in the motion as you fulfill the word of God. Amen. Amen. When Peter was to come out of the ship, he walked on water, but he had to come out of the ship first. He could sit in the boat. He could talk to Jesus all he wanted to. But until he put it into action, if he'd have never went into action, he'd have never walked on water. Amen. He would have never felt the power of God given him the ability to overcome, Amen. the the human thoughts and human thinking of if I get on this water, water don't hold man, gravity's going to pull me down. But he got past all of that and he put Jesus words. What was Jesus words? Come. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like how Jesus does it. He He gives us a command, but he doesn't tell us all what's going to happen in that command. He didn't tell Peter, "Come and you're going to walk on the water like I'm walking on the water. You're going to overcome like I'm No, he just showed him to come out and it caused an action in Peter." He had to put that word come into action. And when he stepped out into the water, then the power of God met him in the water. It met him in the motion of the word as he put the word into motion. Amen. The healing doesn't wait. Healing does not wait for certainty. Amen. Power meets faith in motion. GOD SPEAKS, WE RESPOND, God confirms. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith though is not a passive waiting. It's an act of trust. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's action first. It's hearing the word. It's responding to the word and then God meets us when we put that word into action. This is what it was at the Red Sea in Israel. They came up against the Red Sea. What happened? It looked impossible. It looked like they didn't have boats enough. They didn't have they they couldn't they couldn't they didn't know how they was going to get past it. And they started looking at their past and looking at their failures and but the word spoke and it said speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward. &gt;&gt; That they go forward. Amen. The ocean, the sea was still there, but the action followed. They stepped towards AN IMPOSSIBLE SEA. THEY STEPPED TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT LOOKED HUMANLY IMPOSSIBLE AND THE POWER MET THEM IN THE MOTION. IT MET THEM IN THE ACTION AND THE WATERS WERE DIVIDED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Old Hebrew writings will write of how these men actually heard the word speak speak and go forward and they actually begin to take their belongings and walk into that water and it got up to their nose before it parted. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Listen, it may get up to your nose sometimes. IT MAY SEEM LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE WORD, THE POWER IS GOING TO MEET YOU IN THE MOTION. IT'S GOING TO MEET YOU WHEN YOU'RE ACTIVE, PUTTING THE WORD IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. It has to. It's too much scripture. Amen. Action came and the sea. Amen. The sea parted. Now, it didn't part before they moved. It part as they was moving towards it. The Jordan River, the same thing. The word came, when you come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. Amen. The priest stepped into flooded waters. &gt;&gt; Right? Brother Brown teaches this. He said it was in in the springtime. And he said it was flooded out of its banks. It was not just a little trickling stream. It was impossible for them to get across. And the word said, "You're to step into the waters. You're to step into that Jordan River. And as they bear the ark, they that bear the ark came to the Jordan, the waters stood and rose up on as a heap. What was it? The power of God met them in the motion. It met them in the action. Amen. They had to have an ACTION FOR THE POWER OF GOD TO BE FULFILLED. AMEN. We can read about a non the prophecy, the prophet that told him to go dip in the river seven times into the Jordan. The word came first, go and wash in the Jordan seven times. Now, this man, he was very wroth when he heard this. It was actually a servant of his and said, "Hey, you came all this way. You might as well put what he said into action. You might as well believe what he said." And he began to dip himself and as he come the seventh time, power met him in his obedience. Amen. That he followed what the prophet said and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child. Healing comes after obedience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you obey the word OF GOD, GOD IS OBLIGATED TO FULFILL his word. &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brandham taught us as well. I mean, he said if the one man gets healed and the next man comes and he meets all the same obligations that the first man met, God is therefore obligated to heal that man. What is it? When you put that word into action, God is obligated to you. Amen. He's not obligated as long as you just sit there and try to think about it. Well, I believe it. I believe it. NO, BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO ACTION in your life, THEN IT MAKES GOD obligated to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He would do that in the widow's oil. Amen. The word came first. When the widow didn't have no money, didn't have anything. The prophet said, "Go borrow all these vessels and then take the vessel of oil and pour it out." What was it? She poured from an empty pot. And power met her in her motion, in the action of her faith. And the Bible says that the oil stayed not. It stay it never ran out. &gt;&gt; As she would follow the WORD OF THE PROPHET and she would begin to pour out, it would pour out oil and she'd fill this vessel up and fill this vessel up and fill this vessel up. WHAT WAS IT? THE POWER OF GOD met her as she fulfilled the word that was spoken to her. Listen, IF YOU'LL FULFILL THE WORD THAT IS SPOKEN OF YOU, THE POWER OF GOD IS OBLIGATED TO MEET YOU IN THE MOTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; As is what he said again as he said, "Stretch forth thy hand." The word came first. Stretch forth thine hand and the action followed. The man stretched what was withered. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It wasn't healed and then he stretched it. He stretched out a withered hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the the man stretched out what was withered and power met him. The Bible says and his hand was restored whole. He had to attempt what he could not do. &gt;&gt; What seemed impossible AND MAYBE HE TRIED MANY TIMES BEFORE AND IT SEEMED but the word came &gt;&gt; and THE WORD WAS SPOKE OVER HIM AND HE BELIEVED the word but not only did he believe the word HE PUT THE WORD INTO ACTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, God wants more than a word believe. HE WANTS WORDS IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT BROTHER Brandham said. GOD JEFFERSON BUILDS THOUSANDS OF live voices that are that are that are lives that are in action. That's voices that are speaking the word of God. That's voices that are living THE WORD OF GOD, not just on dead letters somewhere at a Bible rolled up or TAPES ON A SHELF. THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD DESIRES. GOD WANTS ACTION. PEOPLE FULFILLING THE word of God and as they are fulfilling and walking in step with the word then the power is there to meet them and to fulfill that word they're not we're not able to fulfill it on our own we're not saying that &gt;&gt; I can't fulfill nothing that God said on my own I can only do as he said &gt;&gt; right it's what we said about the blind man amen the blind man he told him to go wash in the pool of shalom Oh, he went blind. You know, it's one of my favorite stories in the Bible because it's so confounded the religious men of that day because here this blind man and Jesus comes up to him and he sees that he doesn't have even eyeballs. &gt;&gt; And brother Brown talks about how it was the creator there that day that said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; And he would in some dirt. I don't know if he was blind hearing them sounds what you might think for a moment. He said, "But he spit in the dirt and he be to make a mud pile." He said, "But what was it?" It was the creator in action. &gt;&gt; And he actually began to put mud in his eyes and he said, "Now you go wash in the pool of salom." Now he walked there trying to feel his way. He But what was it? He was putting the word that Jesus spoke to him in action. That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you may not have it all FIGURED OUT. GUESS WHAT? You don't have to have it all figured out. &gt;&gt; Right? You don't have to have it all. 1 plus 1 equals 2 and 2 plus 2 equals 4 and this and this great big problem ALL FIGURED. IT AIN'T UP TO US TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. IT'S US UP TO US TO believe the WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN OF US AND PUT IT IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; He had an impossible problem. I got to go find the pool of salom. I'm a blind man. But he was just following what the word spoke to him. And as he followed it, no doubt people like, "What are you doing? You crazy. What you got all that mud on your face?" I'm only doing what the word said. &gt;&gt; What are you doing dressed like that? What are you doing acting like? I'm only doing what the word said. &gt;&gt; Right. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why you acting like that way in church? I'm only doing what the word said. &gt;&gt; Right. And here he comes back seeing. What was it? He said he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing. And then Jesus had pulled himself back and he he never saw Jesus with his own eyes. So he didn't know who the man was. He just knew that I once was blind. Now I can see &gt;&gt; and so he well goes into the temple and they like well who who did this who? And they started questioning well bring his parents. Well the parents didn't want to give no answer. Ask him. He was the one that that had this experience. He was the one that received this. Ask him. And and this man finally stops. HE SAID, "WELL, THIS IS A marvelous thing." He said, "Never since the world began as a man being born blind, given his eyes, his sight, and you don't know who that is, &gt;&gt; right? What was it?" HE KNEW BECAUSE GOD HAD SPOKE TO HIM. AND THE WORD THAT WAS SPOKE CAME TO pass &gt;&gt; and it was manifested. Is it what again? To the lepers. Go show yourself to the priest. They went away still lepers. They didn't have it all figured out, but power met them in the way. &gt;&gt; As they went, they were cleansed in the miraculous catch of fish. You know, the scripture says Jesus told them to launch out to the deep and let down your your your nets. They obeyed against their own experience. &gt;&gt; They were fishermen. THEY THEY DONE TOILED ALL NIGHT. THEY DONE FISH. They done sain. THEY DONE FIGURED GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT. THEY AIN'T NO FISH. According to their own ideas and intellectual abilities, there wasn't nothing there. But Jesus said there was &gt;&gt; What did he Yeah. He said, "Go out and launch let your nets down. That's good enough. Just go do what he said." Right. This is what this is what they did at the at the wedding at Canaa. And and and they said, "Go get me some new some bottles of water." And what was it? Mary said, "Just go do what he said. If you do what he said, then a miracle is going to take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. If you'll do what he said, a miracle will take place in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just go do what he said. Let down your nets. They obeyed against experience and then power met them and they and the scripture says they were enclosed a great multitude of fish. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU'RE SERVING A GOD THAT CAN CREATE A FISH OUT OF NOTHING. There may not have been no FISH DOWN THERE, BUT when he TOLD HIM TO PUT DOWN THEIR NETS, HE COULD CREATE A BILLION FISH IF HE WANTED TO. &gt;&gt; He could create a NUMBER OF INNUMERABLE AMOUNT OF FISH. HE'S A CREATOR WITH limitless abilities. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT LIMITED by your mind. He's not limited by how you think. He's not, thank God, HE'S NOT LIMITED BY OUR HUMAN ABILITIES. WE SERVE A GOD WHO IS NOT LIMITED. SO IF HE TELLS YOU TO DO SOMETHING, DO WHAT HE SAID CUZ HE'S GOING TO MEET YOU WHERE HE TOLD YOU. &gt;&gt; LAZARUS, the word came, take away the stone. I remember as a young man hearing brother Donnie preached this thing. He titled it Mary's Belief at Youth Camp. And he said, "Ain't this amazing? Jesus turned to those women and said, "Take away the stone." 12 disciples there turns to the women. Take away the stone. He said he acted it all out. Getting up, if I remember right, got up against the pull pit and begin to Mary, are you pushing? What was it? It required an action. &gt;&gt; This wasn't the disciples miracle. This was Mary and Martha's miracle. Amen. Sometimes we want other people to do something so we can receive a miracle. NO, GOD REQUIRES us to do what he said so we can receive the miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, action followed. THEY HAD TO THEY HAD TO MOVE THE STONE AND POWER CAME. LAZARUS COME FORTH. &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER GOT TO THE RESURRECTION POWER IF THEY WOULD HAVE NOT PUT HIS WORD INTO ACTION and move the stone. Resurrection power came after obedience. God speaks, faith responds, powers confirm. &gt;&gt; Obedience to the word creates the meeting place for God's power. &gt;&gt; Hello. I say it again so you write that down. Obedience to the word creates the meeting place for God's power. Faith does not wait for evidence. It moves when the word says move. Amen. Well, you know, it's directly tied. One of the one of the scriptures I want to bring out for a moment is Moses's hands that were lifted in the wilderness in Exodus 17 and verse 8 through13. It's one of the clearest scriptures of faith that must be active faith and not just merely believed. Amen. It's the word in the action and power meeting you. Amen. in the action. Listen, the B this battle that was that that Joshua was down in the valley f fighting was won or lost by visible obedience. &gt;&gt; Right? Moses's hands being lifted up. &gt;&gt; It was WON OR LOST BY VISIBLE OBEDIENCE. Scripture says in Exodus 17:11, "It came to pass when Moses held up his hands, the Israelites prevailed. But when he let his hand down, Amalecch prevailed. &gt;&gt; Come on now. SO IT REQUIRED AN ACTION. &gt;&gt; IT REQUIRED SOMETHING THAT HAD TO HAPPEN for them to get the victory. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T DRIVE THAT HOME ENOUGH. YOU THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING OUT OF THIS SERVICE, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S REQUIRED OF YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It ain't all just on a PREACHER OR A SONG LEADER TO KEEP YOU MUSICIANS. IT'S UP ON US. ARE WE FOLLOWING WHAT THE WORD SAID DO? &gt;&gt; Are we in OBEDIENCE TO WHAT THE WORD SAYS? WELL, I know why I don't like that song. I don't like It ain't got nothing to do about what I like. It's about what his word says. &gt;&gt; I don't like the way they're play. It ain't got nothing to do with the way I like it. IT HAS WITH WHAT THE WORD SAYS. THAT IF I respond to what the word says, God's going to meet me in my motion. &gt;&gt; But yeah, we want God to deliver our children and we want God to do this and we want God to do that. And we'll just sit there and stare at this screen as words are being sung and words never come out of our mouth and we're all in the mro. There's an action required. &gt;&gt; We got some issue there. Let that issue go. There's actions required here. It's class participation. It ain't all just on the man standing behind this desk. Thank God. &gt;&gt; Listen, victory did not depend on Israel's military skill. Victory depended on Moses keeping his hands lifted. &gt;&gt; So faith is not a passive belief. IT'S A CONTINUED ACTION. WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS NOT A A PASSIVE MOMENT THAT YEAH, I'M IN ACTION ON SUNDAY, but on Monday I I don't believe no more. NO, YOU YOU CONTINUE TO BELIEVE LESS A WORSE THING COME UPON YOU. &gt;&gt; No wonder the Amalachites are taking a hold of you and taking hold of your your calm and your peace and all that. You ain't got your hands lifted up. &gt;&gt; You ain't praising God. You ain't giving him glory in the middle of the battle. &gt;&gt; Faith is not passive. It's a CONTINUED ACTION. WHAT GOD HAS SPOKEN MUST BE ACTIVELY PUT INTO ACTION FOR HIS POWER TO FLOW. It has to. It's like a heartbeat. IT HAS TO BE MOVING. It has to be Amen. GOD'S WORD IS NOT A DEAD LETTER. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST SIT there and it just sit there to admire and to look at and say, "Wow, ain't that beautiful?" NO, IT'S TO PUT IT IN ACTION IN OUR LIVES. Lifted hands was showing I got a dependence on God and not my own strength and not the strength of my men. In the scriptures, lifted hands consistently res represent surrender. You can read that in Psalm 63 and 4. I won't go there at these scriptures, but also it represents a petition or or repentance. That's Psalms 28:2 and l Lamentations 3:41. But Moses standing with lifted hands declared this and declared the victory is not coming from having greater weapons or or a greater number of people. This victory is coming from the Lord and my obedience to his word. &gt;&gt; Right? So victory is not coming from from something a place where I feel good all the time or things are going just right all the time. No, it's when it's not going all right. It's when things are all against you and the spirits of hell are coming against you, BUT YOU'RE WILLING TO FOLLOW THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Not follow your feelings. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. Not follow how you feel or you feel good or don't. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT'S WITH THE WORD OF GOD. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW HIS WORD NO MATTER HOW I FEEL. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? So honestly, Moses had to keep his body, his posture in line with the word even when he got weary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what we have to do in church sometimes, right? &gt;&gt; Keep our body, our posture in line with the word even when we're weary. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when we don't feel like singing, &gt;&gt; even when we don't feel like entering in, even when things are against us, I'm going to keep my body and posture in line &gt;&gt; with the word. &gt;&gt; Even when I'm sick as a dog, &gt;&gt; I'm gonna keep my body and posture in line with the word. You know, I I'm just going to give a man a flower right now. Brother Ron Spitzer fighting one of the worst battles of cancer a man's ever fought now. Five, was it five almost six years? Six years on chemo. And one of the greatest greatest testimonies I ever heard about the man is you'll never know it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; People actually writing in saying he's acting and making it up because he ain't lost his hair. And because, you know, he never acts like he ain't feeling bad. He always looks good. It's a choice. &gt;&gt; You know what the choice is? I'm going to follow the word. I'm not going to follow my feet because listen, I've been behind the scenes enough to know that man don't always feel the greatest. Probably 98% of the time, he don't feel good. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; But when you greet him, he'll have a smile on his face. &gt;&gt; He won't talk about how bad it's been or how terrible it is and how MUCH TROUBLE, HOW MUCH of this, and how much OF THAT. NO, HE'LL SAY, "GOD BLESS YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THE GREATEST person in the room." WHAT IS IT? HE'S PUTTING HIS MOUTH. HE'S PUTTING HIS POSTURE, HE'S PUTTING HIS BODY IN LINE WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; And let ME TELL YOU, THE POWER WILL BE THERE TO MEET IT. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, MOSES' hands got weird. That's what the scripture said. His hands were very heavy. How many has ever just tried to hold your hands up? You know, it don't feel too bad for the first five minutes maybe, &gt;&gt; but then it gets worse and worse. &gt;&gt; It was showing though that starting in faith is not enough. &gt;&gt; Faith must be held until the victory is complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what the scripture says in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 36. For you have need of patience after you've done the will of God that ye might receive the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it ain't just starting out in faith, though. It's continuing in faith. It's not just feeling faith on a Sunday or a Wednesday night. It's on the Monday morning blues. It's on Tuesday. IT'S ON THURSDAY. IT'S ON FRIDAY. IT'S ON SATURDAY. IT'S ON EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK, 247, 365, 666, whatever year we're in days a year. &gt;&gt; Faith must be upheld. &gt;&gt; Do I always feel like having my hands up? No, I don't. Do I always feel like I want to surrender? No, I don't. Do I always feel like I'm on top of the val up on top of the mountain, not down? No, I don't. But that has nothing to do with our feelings. Has nothing to do with our faith. We've got to separate the two. That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible doesn't say that the battle ended when Moses lifted up his hands, but it does say as long as his hands were lifted, Israel prevailed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, it goes with what we've been speaking about, the priests stepping into the Jordan, the lepers going to the priest still while still unclean, the man taking his bed up before strength was fully returned. Faith acts first and then power follows the movement. &gt;&gt; We want the power, then we'll have the faith. No, that ain't the way it happens. You get the faith and then you act on it and then the power will come. &gt;&gt; This is what he shows there in Isaiah. Brother Brandon would bring this out very clearly in Isaiah seen the angels before the throne. They had we spoke on the wings of faith last weekend. And this kind of ties a little bit in with that around the throne with three sets of wings. One to cover his face, which brother Brandon would teach that was reverence. And one set to cover his feet was humility and respect. But there was another set to it was a set to fly. It was to be an action. It wasn't good enough just to have reverence. It wasn't good enough just to have humility and respect, BUT IT HAD TO BE AN ACTION. &gt;&gt; This is what THIS IS WHAT GOD DESIGNED his angels TO BE. HE WAS SHOWING US WHAT WE MUST BE. We brother Brandon would bring it out. Go listen to it. Amen. He was showing us that we have to be reverent towards the word, HAVE RESPECT TOWARDS THE WORD, BELIEVE THE WORD, BUT WE HAVE TO PUT THE WORD INTO ACTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He said, like the woman at the well, when she saw something happen, he said she had two wings, brother. She got away with with them real quick. She'd come out there to Jacob's well to get some of that contaminated water that they were arguing about. But what she got was a drink out of the fountain of life and she went into action right quick. She didn't say, "Well, sir, please tell me. Let me get a deeper understanding here. What where did you get your education? Where did you get this stuff? How did you learn that I I only had I had five husbands and the man I'm living with is not my husband? HOW DID YOU KNOW WHAT WAS wrong with me? Can you tell me? Can you explain it to me better? Can you give me a better intellectual understanding? No, she never questioned. She never tried TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. SHE JUST SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER SAID, "SIR, I PERCEIVE YOU'RE A PROPHET." &gt;&gt; And something began TO STIR ON THE INSIDE OF HER UNTIL HE TOOK HER TO A PLACE THAT NOT ONLY DID SHE SEE IT WAS A PROPHET, SHE SAW THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH TO COME. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER SAID IT PUT HER INTO ACTION. AND HE SAID, "I am he." AND SHE WENT RIGHT INTO ACTION RIGHT DOWN INTO THE CITY AS HARD AS SHE GO. COME SEE A MAN WHO'S TOLD ME EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE. ISN'T THIS THE MESSIAH? WHEN SHE SAW THE TRUTH, she didn't try to pack the ball. She didn't TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. SHE HAD A LOT OF RESPECT. She had she g she was sure to GIVE A LOT OF SUPPORT, BUT SHE WENT DOWN AND SAID, "COME SEE, COME SEE. COME SEE." WHAT WAS IT? HER GOING INTO ACTION. And when you're in action following the word, you'll realize very quickly you're not concerned about earthly things. &gt;&gt; Right? Because the scripture says she left her water pot &gt;&gt; now. At the beginning of that scripture, that was the first thing she brought up when he asked her of a drink. And then she said, "Well, who are you to ask me of a drink?" You know, and go through that whole conversation. And then he said, "Well, if you knew who I was, you'd ask me of a drink." And she says, "Well, how are you going to get me a drink? You don't have a water pot." &gt;&gt; So, she thought, "This is the most important thing in this conversation is this water pot." Well, we got all the way down to it. And when she went into action, she left it. She left what she thought that she had deemed necessary, what she thought was important, what what she thought was lifegiving. She found the real true lifegiver. &gt;&gt; And she left the same thing that happened to us. What we thought one time was a right thing. What we thought was one one time was a great thing. What we thought, what we kept, what we Oh, she left it. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz she went into action with the word. &gt;&gt; She went into action. You got them wings. She be to fly. Amen. When the Apostle Peter when he took God at his word one day out to sea, fished all night, hadn't take nothing. And Jesus said, "Past your net on the other side of the boat." Well, Lord, I'm a fisherman. I know when they bite and when they don't bite. I know when they're there and when they're not there. &gt;&gt; I FISHED ALL NIGHT and I haven't even I haven't even caught a little minnow. &gt;&gt; But if you say cast your net over there, I know there's no fish there, but at your word, &gt;&gt; I'm going to let down the net. He went into action. Amen. It's brother R bring it down. He said it's time to get into action. If you're just a church member, it's time to get into action. If you don't know God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's time to get into action. He said, "Cover your face with reverence. Cover your FEET WITH HUMILITY. BOW ON YOUR KNEES and go into action. If you don't know God, GET IN ACTION." AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, they got another service. There may not be another service. &gt;&gt; We don't know. &gt;&gt; What the church needs, he says, is get in action. Oh, we got a lot of form. We got a little bit of worldly dignity about us, but we need some action. &gt;&gt; This bride needs some action. &gt;&gt; Not just words on a tape. Not just words on scripture. &gt;&gt; What was it? What was the book wrote about the apostles? The book of acts. &gt;&gt; Not the books of sitting on their laurels and tell swapping stories. How they used to walk with Jesus and how they used to be with Jesus and how they used to see miracles and how it used to be. NO, THEY WENT INTO ACTION. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Went into action to WHERE THEY WALKED UP TO THE GATE CALLED BEAUTIFUL AND THERE'S a lame man sitting there and they begging for arms and he said Peter Peter said silver and gold have I none BUT WHAT I HAVE GIVE I UNTO THEE. THERE WAS AN ACTION THAT TOOK PLACE. &gt;&gt; Give I unto thee in the name OF JESUS CHRIST RISE UP AND WALK. &gt;&gt; What was it showing? That the very action of Christ is now inside of other believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what he was showing on Mo and Moses with his hands lifted up. HE WAS SHOWING THAT ONE DAY I'M GOING TO COME AND I'M GOING TO PUT MY HANDS UP FOR HUMILITY AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THEM DOWN UNTIL THE VICTORIES WON. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT DOWN UNTIL SATAN'S KINGDOM IS FINISHED. &gt;&gt; It was finished in water, blood, and spirit. the chemicals needed to create himself a bride left out of his body and it came back on the day of Pentecost. Not to put some people on their laurels and think about what they used to do and how it used to be. No, he's a God today. &gt;&gt; What such as I have rise up and walk &gt;&gt; now this lame man had it had an opportunity whether he's going to think about it right &gt;&gt; maybe next church service brother Peter speaks I I'll probably I'll probably move up to the altar. I I'll probably Make a commitment. Then the devil will talk you that way all the way to next year. &gt;&gt; All the way to the next year. If there is another year, all the way to hell. &gt;&gt; Little carrot. Next service. Next service. Next service. We ain't worried about next service. May not have a next service. This service. &gt;&gt; This service. &gt;&gt; This service. This service. I'm getting the Holy Ghost. This service. I'm I'm receiving I'm receiving God as my savior. This service. I'm getting a renewal, a re a renewing of my spirit. I'm getting a renewing of the power of God. This service, I'm getting a healing IN MY BODY. THIS SERVICE, I I'M SEEING PROMISES BEING FULFILLED. WHY? BECAUSE I'M NOT WALKING ACCORDING TO MY FEELINGS. I'M WALKING ACCORDING TO THE WORD. HIS WORD SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT. AND I'M GOING TO WALK IN IT UNTIL THE POWER MEETS ME IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Get in action. Well, he said and he said, "You shall receive Holy Ghost." He said, "Let me go back a little bit." He says, "The people in the Pentecost, they didn't know very much. Maybe couldn't even sign their own name." Some of them, they were scared up in the upper room. But one day, what did they do? They went into into the obedience to his word. They took his word. He said, "Oh, if people today would just take his word, then they'll get into action." Try in the city of Jerusalem. You shall receive the Holy Ghost after the promise. After this, the Holy Ghost shall come upon you. Then you'll be witnesses of me. Then you'll be put into action. What was it? Behold, I send the promise of the Father, but wait in the city of Jerusalem until due with power from on high. How long? 1 hour, 2 hour, 10 days, 4 months, 6 months. Didn't make any difference. Until. How long is that? Just until. But when God asks you for anything, stay right there until. Stay until. until what? It happens. &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE WORD until &gt;&gt; Don't get out of line. Brother, Brother Wayne Lawson preached a wonderful message some years back there in North Carolina, but I'm in line for a miracle. &gt;&gt; He brought it from the people that was there at the miracle of the breaking of the bread and the and the fishes. And he said they was all in line for a miracle. He said, 'What if one have went home early? &gt;&gt; Well, I got some something I need to take care of home and they just moved off or this they' have stepped out of line for their miracle. &gt;&gt; You don't know when the miracle will happen. &gt;&gt; But, uh, but it ain't up to me to figure out when it's going to happen, how it's going to happen, how God's going to fulfill his word, when it's going to happen. I It ain't up to me. What's up to me is to stay in the word. &gt;&gt; To stay with him until what? They were in the upper room praising and blessing God for what? The promise. They knew it had to come. How did they know it had to come? Cuz he said it was going to come. There you are. Get in action. Go to praising God till the promise is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Hello. YEAH. &gt;&gt; GO TO PRAISING GOD TILL THE PROMISE IS FULFILLED. YOU GOT THE PROMISE. IF YOU BELIEVE GOD HEALS, STAY IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; Don't get in the mully grubs and brother brother Joe Forny would talk about it. The wy wowsy woos, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, nobody cares about me. Nobody understands what I'm going through. That ain't in action. That's in moly grubs. That ain't in the word. That's in your feeling. Get out of your feelings. &gt;&gt; Get in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. If God says he heals, stay in that word. &gt;&gt; He's going to bring it to pass as long as you're in that word. &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't know when the healing angel's coming through the neighborhood. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN HE'S GOING TO WALK. WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, WE ENTERTAIN angels unaware. YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN HE'S COMING AND HE COMES TO VISIT YOU, BUT YOU'RE IN THE WRONG ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU'RE NOT IN THE ATTITUDE TO RECEIVE A MIRACLE. YOU'RE ALL FRUSTRATED AND MAD AND TORE UP AND GOD'S READY TO GIVE YOU A MIRACLE, BUT YOU STEPPED OUT OF LINE. &gt;&gt; WELL, just do like the prophet taught us. Repent and get back in the line. get back in the word of God that when he comes THE NEXT TIME, I'M GOING TO BE IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BE STANDING ON THE WORD. I'm going to be believing the word. &gt;&gt; And when my feelings get out of sorts, I'm going to bring my feelings back subject to the word of God. &gt;&gt; The joy OF THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; Stay in action. You got two wings. Stay in action. He says, "If you believe God heals, stay in action. If you believe he's going to call you, stay in action. Hold on. You're holding on to him, stay in action." You got two wings, so use them. Stay in action. Wave them back and forth and say, "Lord, I believe." &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe. He said, "If you can't holler, say, "Holy, holy, holy." Say, "Lord, I BELIEVE." STAY IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; They stayed in action TILL THERE CAME A SOUND FROM HEAVEN LIKE A RUSHING MIGHTY WIND. THEN they were really in action. THEY WERE PUT IN THE ACTION OF THE SAME GOD OF THE SAME SPIRIT OF THE same Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; ought to we ought to be he said when we see the things that are being fulfilled in this day this was back in the 60s 50s and 60s he's preaching these messages talking about things that are being fulfilled how we ought to be in he how much more should we be in action &gt;&gt; when we hear the war &gt;&gt; drums beating We're standing at now at a time of nuclear destruction. &gt;&gt; Threaten it straight out calling it out. Said if you do this, I'm going to bring the end. &gt;&gt; I guess I want to say then what? &gt;&gt; You had the biggest bombs, but you still lost. But we hear all these things. We see things happening. We see the God fulfilling his word. We see all the signs that's being fulfilled. We see Israel in his place. We see the word Sunday, the violence and things and all the things that are going on. It is the word being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; IT IS GOD FULFILLING HIS WORD. IT'S THE WHEELS OR THE COGS OF PROPHECY THAT ARE GRINDING SLOW BUT SURE. BUT IT'S COMING DOWN to the end of the tape. IT'S COMING DOWN TO THE end of the line. And as as WE SAID BEFORE, AS IT WOULD GET DOWN TO THE END, IT GOES FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER and faster and faster and it's gone. What kind of people should we be? What kind of expectations should we have? Don't let the Don't let the world blind you. The glare of Sodom and Gomorrah, the smoke get in your eyes so much &gt;&gt; that you can't see what's really happening on. &gt;&gt; If it is in your eyes, I got a cure for you, it's called Isav. &gt;&gt; If all you can see is all the things and the terribleness and all that stuff and and the world, if that's all you can see and THE SMOKE IS BLINDING YOU, there is some eyes here tonight &gt;&gt; that'll give you some clear vision that you can see. Not only is there a lot of demons been unleashed in THIS REALM, BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF ANGELS THAT HAVE COME ON ON THE BEHALF OF THE BELIEVERS. WE'RE NOT IN THIS BATTLE ALONE. &gt;&gt; They're angels, as we've read, not just of humility and reverence, but they're also angels of action. We get a whole another sermon. He said, he said, "How how much ought we to be?" They saw the pillar of fire. We've saw the pillar of fire. They saw the They saw all the things take place in their day. We should also see the things that are taking place in our day. And he's tying it back and forth showing they're a book of Acts, but we should also be a book of Acts. &gt;&gt; We are the continuation of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Not the book of sitting on our laurels and talking about 60 years ago. No, the book of action. &gt;&gt; NOT HUMAN ACTION. THE ACTS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVING IN HIS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what the acts WERE ABOUT. IT WASN'T about this fuss AND ABOUT THAT FUSS. NO, IT'S WHAT GOD WAS DOING IN THE MIDST OF HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; And let me TELL YOU, HE'S THE SAME GOD WITH THE SAME POWER AND THE SAME DEMONSTRATION. HE'S THE SAME IN PERSON. HE'S THE SAME IN DETAIL. HE'S THE SAME IN ACTION. HE'S THE SAME IN POWER. &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE A CONTINUATION of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; The acts of the Holy Ghost. Yes, &gt;&gt; brother Rand would teach us many times about this. He said he never ordained us to build any church. He never ordained us to build hospitals or to schools or have a seminary. He never one time commissioned us to do that. All them things are okay. They're good. But yet he did commission us to preach the gospel to all the world. And he said, "And we have built churches and schools and seminaries and taught theologies and onethird of the world is all that's heard about Jesus yet. But after all the passing of tracks," he said, "But after all, passing tracks is not preaching the gospel." The gospel came not in word only, said Paul, but through the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. Not just teach the word, but preach it. Make it manifest. Make the word manifest. Make the word be alive. It's a dead letter until it's made manifest. But then when it's made manifest, it's quickened and brought to pass what God said about it. THAT IS THE GOSPEL IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE WORD OF God in action. &gt;&gt; He'll tell us in the church age book as we bring this down. Satan knows assurely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God. Mark 16 in action. &gt;&gt; Preach the word. Lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. If they drink any deadly thing, it shall not harm them. &gt;&gt; Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own. If you don't find yourself in Mark 16, you are not the true church. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's the word. THAT'S JESUS RED LETTER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PROPHET COMING RIGHT BACK AROUND AND SAYING MARK 6:16 IN ACTION IS THE TRUE CHURCH THAT Jesus claims as his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All else is false. &gt;&gt; It has to be. Yes. &gt;&gt; But remember this, Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. But the book of Revelation shows that Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, make it lukewarm, formal, and powerless. &gt;&gt; What is a powerless body? A body that has no action. &gt;&gt; It's dead. &gt;&gt; Oh, it might look beautiful. It might be a corpse bejeweled, but it's still a corpse. right &gt;&gt; is still dead. But this book exposes Satan, revealing his works, the attempted destruction of God's people, and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire. He fights that. He cannot stand. He knows that if the church gets the true revelation of the true church and what she is, what she stands for, she will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That she can do the greater work. She will be an invincible army if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework. What are the true spirits? Two spirits. One that's trying to make you powerless and one that's trying to put you in action. &gt;&gt; One is trying to make you formal and lukewarm. One that's trying to make you on fire for the power of God and the love of God in your life. &gt;&gt; The word in action. &gt;&gt; The word lived. But if you can by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before her. He will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withtood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert. Yes, SATAN HATES REVELATION, BUT WE love it. For true revelation or I in our lives, THE GATES OF HELL CANNOT PREVAIL AGAINST US, BUT WE WILL PREVAIL over them. Amen. &gt;&gt; THIS CHURCH, THIS MARK 16:16 CHURCH IN ACTION WILL PREVAIL OVER THE GATES OF HELL. &gt;&gt; IT WILL PREVAIL OVER CANCER. IT WHAT DOES THE gates of HELL REPRESENT? THE GATES REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT'S BEHIND THE GATE. &gt;&gt; SO IF WE WE PREVAIL OVER THE GATES, we prevail over everything BEHIND THE GATES. THEREFORE, WE PREVAIL OVER SICKNESS, WE PREVAIL OVER HELL, WE PREVAIL OVER EVERY DEVIL, WE PREVAIL OVER DEATH ITSELF. WHY? CUZ WE ARE CHURCH IN ACTION, MARCHING IN STEP WITH THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Paul said the word came in power as well as voice. The word preached will actually demonstrate itself. &gt;&gt; I've seen it happen preaching and people be healed right in the middle of it. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Chains fall off right in the middle of we heard about all that Sunday, right? &gt;&gt; What was what was we hearing? A church, the book of Acts, a continuation of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, as we heard Sunday, God ain't finished yet. &gt;&gt; He's still got the pen and he's still writing the letters out. He's still finishing up the chapter. There's going to come a the end one of these days, &gt;&gt; but it ain't going to be my the end. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I tell you whose the end is going to be. It's going to be the end to depression. It's going to be the end to fear. It's going to be the end to anxiety. It's going to be the end to every devil in hell. It's going to be the END TO SATAN, LUCIFER HIMSELF. BUT IT WILL NOT BE MY END. I'LL STILL BE IN ACTION. PRAISING GOD, giving him glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word demonstrated is like a flaming cutting sword that'll cut right into the consciences of men like a surgeon's knife. It'll cut out diseases. It'll set captives free. Everywhere those early believers went, they went preaching the gospel word. And God confirmed the word with signs following. &gt;&gt; If you don't find yourself there, you're a false church. Right? The sick were healed. The devils cast out. THEY SPOKE A NEW TONGUE. THAT WAS THE WORD IN ACTION. THAT WORD HAS NEVER FAILED IN MOUTHS OF believing Christians. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me say it like this. It will never fail in mouths of believing Christians. And in this last age, it is weaker. It is less. NO, IT'S STRONGER. IT'S GREATER THAN EVER in the true word bride. &gt;&gt; So the actions is not going to get less. It's going to get greater. &gt;&gt; It's going to get so great. The action of the spirit of God in the people in people's life is going to get so great until this action takes over in these bodies as they're walking like a dead one step at a time. One day that step's going to step and the power is going to be there to meet them in the motion. It might feel like just a regular Monday morning, but on that Monday morning, Monday evening, Monday afternoon, whenever it is, THAT POWER IS GOING TO MEET YOU IN THAT MOTION. AND ONE STEP YOU'RE going to be in humanity, and the next step you're going to be IN ANOTHER DIMENSION, CHANGED FOREVER. NEVER TO GO BACK TO THAT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; NEVER TO GO BACK AND TAKE UP THE OLD BED OF HUMANITY, THE OLD BED OF OF DEPRESSION, THE OLD BED OF ANXIETIES AND FEARS, BUT WALK AWAY FROM it forever. FOREVER. GOD WANTS SOMEBODY IN action &gt;&gt; to believe what his word says. &gt;&gt; He says, "Little flock, you little minority, hold on to the word. Fill your mouth and heart with it, and someday God will give you the kingdom. &gt;&gt; This last age is going to be stronger and greater." &gt;&gt; So don't be looking for less, be looking for more. He ain't finished yet. &gt;&gt; Is brother Jeremy here tonight? Okay. He ain't finished yet. God is looking for somebody that'll take his word &gt;&gt; and put it into action. You're sitting in a building tonight. We've told the testimony of it many times, but you're putting sitting in a building because a man heard something more than a heard something more than a a little sick man laid on a bed. But he saw God meet him in the motion. As he would walk there into that hospital, he would text me and he said, "I'm going in to pray for brother Gary." said, ' Don't forget, Dad. I just was just reading that. Me and my family were just reading in the book of Acts. Said, "Don't forget. We're writing a new new book of Acts. We're the continuation. Another book of Acts. We're the continuation." He'd walk in there and he would hear this man begin to express things about wants and desires. And God came down and the power met them in the motion. And you're sitting now in the very visible form of that power &gt;&gt; that gave us this place that we didn't even have to go to a bank and borrow a dime. &gt;&gt; If God could do that about a building, &gt;&gt; don't you think he can do that about your son, &gt;&gt; about your daughter, about your body, &gt;&gt; about your mind, about your spirit, about whatever you're going through? This God will meet you in the motion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk in his word. Live in his word. And he's going to meet you there. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts. The word in action. Stretch forth thy hand. Hey, God. It's withered. It hurts. He didn't ask you if it hurts. He just said, stretch it out. He didn't ask you to give a 10-page report on all the doctor said and all this said and all that. All what your emotions says and what what what all your symptoms say. No, I'm not interested. Stretch forth thy hand. Rise up and walk. Step out of the boat. Go show yourself to the priest. Lift your hands. Moses actions. Not thoughts, not excuses, not well, I ain't got nobody to take me to the water. I some as soon as I try, somebody gets in front of me. It ain't about that. It's about rise up, take up your bed, and walk. It's an action. It's the day. It's the moment. It's the time. It's the moment that God can meet you in the motion. He can meet you in the action. He can meet you and show you what you thought was impossible is possible. What you thought was not even no way. There's no human human way it could ever happen. God's not taking human equation in he's not taking humanity into the equation. Matter of fact, he takes it out of the equation because God does impossible math and he comes in. He just needs you to take a step. Maybe you feel like it's up to your almost up to your nose. Take another step. What if I step in that old stormy river? What's going to happen? God will meet you there if you're following his word. Brother Timothy, I don't know. I got so many things going on. I got so many situations. I got so many struggles. I I don't quit dwelling on that. Quit looking at that. Go into action. And the true action of a Christian is the word of God. That is the only action. That's the motion you want. That's the way you need to go. That's the What did he say? Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be given to you. Many people want this all the things and then they're going to seek the king. That ain't how it works. Seek you first the kingdom. It's an action. But when you seek him with your whole heart, then God will give you the desires of your heart. God will meet you in the motion. How many just say, "Lord, I I just want to take you at your word tonight. I want to take you at your word. Give it all to you, Jesus." Maybe we just sing that I surrender all. Maybe I just invite you to do what God told Moses to do. Just lift up your hands as a sign of surrender and say, "Lord, I surrender it all. All all to thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender. &gt;&gt; He'll meet you in the action in the motion. Oh, I surrender. Oh, I surrender all. &gt;&gt; I surrender my thoughts. I surrender my feelings. I I surrender what I think. &gt;&gt; I surrender. &gt;&gt; I lay myself down as a sheep &gt;&gt; before the master. Oh, all to thee, my blessed Savior, I surren. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I surrender all.
