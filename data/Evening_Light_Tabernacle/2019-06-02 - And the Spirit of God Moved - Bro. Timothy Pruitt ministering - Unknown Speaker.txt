pray father that you can use this vessel one more time we just ask that you would just come in a special way this morning or deal with each and every heart we pray in Jesus name Amen amen we'll let you be seated for a moment before we go to the Scriptures he meant I have a few things to say it's my first time - I believe to speak since I've been home anyway haven't had we had was gonna plan on doing a you know be dismissed we're planning on doing a report on our mission trip but decided to kind of break it up and do a little different so brother Craig I believe you talked about Japan and the things that had happened there and you know as we left here I told my wife I said I don't know if I've ever been overseas where I felt like I'd even I felt like I just come back I so wore out and exhausted from the camp and things and things that had happened there and the prayer lines and afterwards there after camp at brother David's and just and so my body was real wore down and actually got pretty sick on the way over there landed in Japan my ears was all stopped up and I was really having a rough time and I spoke the first service and after I got through brother Craig said you know what that's it for you you the kids and the Philippines needs you so we can we can handle it from here and and so I just was able to rest for a minute and get get on my feet because I had five services to preach there in the field Ping's to the young people and you can bring those up as we talk about this and so me and brother Tim winters left on Tuesday to head to the Philippines and and we got there Tuesday night and you talked about a cultural shock you leave you know Shreveport it's just a little small airport and and and you go to those places and there's just not just seemingly thousand it seems like millions of people swarming around you and you don't have cell phone service immediately when you land so you don't know where the brothers are to pick you up and you're looking around like a little lost lamb and trying to figure out your way and finally we got connected and then and this was we landed about 8:30 at night and nine o'clock something like that 9:30 about time we got out of the airport and we go right into rush hour and nine o'clock at night and I believe Philippines is English for traffic the most traffic I ever seen in my life and the Manila there and I just we took we went a couple of miles to the hotel but it took like an hour to have to get to the hotel and just through bumper-to-bumper look like a parking lot out on the highway and you know you'd have three or four lanes but they'd go six or seven cars wide and and you know just and then in between all the cars was motorcycles and everything we'll get some of those pictures in a minute but you know all through the all through that you know and then motorcycles going in and out and we're just looking at that and like man there's not a driver in the United States let a motorcycle do what they're doing it'd be a door opening up and slamming them or something I can't but that's just the way they operate and so you know they're moving on through and and then and then we get down the road a little bit in the middle of the road in the middle of all this chaos is a man standing in the middle of the road selling peanuts I mean he's willing to die for peanuts reminded me of that Wednesday night brother brother Tim mentioned that quote would rather read him said throw your worldly bag of peanuts down and get on the train that's what you're doing if you still got peanuts today you're standing in a bunch of traffic and you're gonna die there is a way out of it a man but anyway we got there and we got to the hotel spent the night got up the next morning went to the camp a couple hours away and we gathered here at this place it was a resort there which resort there's not what you think of a resort is not you know what we would have in the United States but it was a nice place and they've done everything they could to make us comfortable and enjoy ourself and we sure appreciate brother Danny del mundo and all the ministry there they're a model I mean it's um it's really amazing what they do and how they do it and work together and really appreciate their love for the Lord and their they want to do something for young people they normally have their camp on Easter weekend which is of course the same weekend as ours and he had asked me last year when he was here to come and I said well brother Danny I said I'm booked far as I know on Easter weekend into the rapture and so I can't give you a gave you a yes on that day so what I'll see what I can do so we waited till January he texted me and he said I'm sorry but I can't move it this year we'll have you next year in about five days later he said I can't help it you got to come this year we're going to move it and so we're gonna have it this such-and-such weekend can you come what am I supposed to say then so I say yes and so anyway we got there Wednesday night and they gather together and I'll tell you I haven't seen as much talent and love for the Lord and and just willingness to serve God in these young people it's a wonderful group it's a tribute to good ministry there in the Philippines so this is the one of the pictures here can go on and this is just during the day you sitting around you know they wanted us to visit so we'd sit around of course they found out really quickly but the Tim winters could sing and and you know they they came running from everywhere to listen to him saying so this is this a picture actually some of this mixed up because I wasn't able to get it all on the right order but this is actually on Sunday at brother Danny's church I preached at his church sunday and brother Tim's out afterward his church here they lived to the right and the bottom there and up those stairs into the back of his church got a real nice place there and this is where they this is their old church is just right behind where I've taken that previous picture and this is where they have their Sunday school for kids now they're at their church now this group here was amazing his brother Rolando and he's a wonderful man he's a wonderful musician and a minister their pastor and his family's great musicians just talented unbelievable talent to sing and play and by play anything just incredible I mean this boy would tear up the piano reminded me of that story brother Branham talked about the woman that got on the anointing said if there was four sets of keys should play all four of them he was that kind of guy and so brother Rolando began to play for brother Tim and and his son would play and man you talking about a Pentecostal Jubilee there was having a good time they love playing for brother Tim but anyway this group here if you see all them people there's about seventeen of them came in that van behind them yeah with their luggage and not only that they traveled for 33 hours in a that van with no AC and it's just as hot there as it is here but they just wanted to be there he said I I've come to this camp every year and it's worth every sacrifice I made he says see how God works in my young people and the change is brought in their life and he said I wouldn't miss it for anything in the world oh wow what a testimony and go ahead as to some of their journey flat tires you see the road they're traveling on there's the road they're traveling on it's not paved all the way I mean you sure they have some pavement there but there's a lot of a lot of dirt road and stuff ferries they have to call cross and he was just a wonderful wonderful man we really fell in love with him and his family there's still him there with the kids as they was on the ferry coming all over just excited to come to camp now this is Sunday all the all the young people and different ones they love pictures and so they got us all together as much as they could stash in that little spot and they crammed in there they get pictures you can see me and brother Tim and the blue right up here in the middle and and this was actually a group we had I don't remember I think about five different countries represented there this is a group of young people from Indonesia and it all started with brother Danny and brother Nestor and those going to the different places inviting the pastors to come into a mystery Expo and they begin to tell them about the mysteries of God and they go through all the mysteries and these people just start eating out of their hands because they've never heard how you know these the truths and these things in a Bible and then they then after they show them all that they show them to where it came from to the Prophet and their pastor actually spoke one of the morning services he came he came to the message was baptized gave his heart to the Lord and as far as I know just about his whole church came to the message and this is a group from Indonesia there they came and song this is some of the traffic this is these big old they call them jeepneys they're just extended Jeeps they make them out of various cars various parts decorated and it's kind of long along their owners taste I guess and it's a cheap way to travel and they use them to run up down the roads and there's thousands of them and they don't have good there's a man selling peanuts and water cigarettes whatever he's in the middle of the road selling him you just keep going that it okay well anyway we had a wonderful time I actually missed it I had of another picture there I thought I had it was actually at the end of that in that meet and we baptized 30 young people for the glory of God and we're just thankful for all that he's done is doing a man and just still getting testimonies and things of God working in their lives and their appreciation they'd really love the Lord they love God's people I guess their favorite song you'd hear them singing I love this family of God so closely knitted into one and and so anyway we really love them and appreciate them and thankful for the opportunity amen we thank you for your prayers and for all that you've done to support that and amen it wasn't in vain Amen God came on the scene let's stand together I tell you back in the back of just shouted cried danced just had myself a good old time back there he meant as I heard the worship and the singing I don't know if it felt that good back there I couldn't believe how good it felt in here amen and we just want to move into this as we have some things on a heart this morning Genesis chapter 1 and verse 1 it says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from darkness and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day god bless you this morning's you seated I like to just take a thought this morning Lord gave it to me actually in preparation I'll be gone the into this month to brother John spinach and he gave it to me then but spoke a little bit on it open up at brother Nathan's and it felt to bring it this morning but out of the second verse and the Spirit of God moved and the Spirit of God moved you know looking upon this this fall without form and void I got to looking at that and so the words the meanings of the word means to be formless a lot of confusion unrealities emptiness nothingness empty space a place of chaos void means empty unfilled desolate or barren and there was a time when the world was laying in this condition as we read here it was without form it was without void it was all covered with water and was laying in the dark and a dismal gloomy atmosphere but that wasn't the final word a man that wasn't the final place that wasn't the final atmosphere a man but the scripture begins and it says it love how it speaks it says the voi it was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the wall of the deep and the Spirit of God began to move a man then the Spirit of God began to move the word was spoke and the dynamics was there to bring it to pass the Spirit of God proved it was greater than the darkness they covered the earth it proved it was greater than the void it proved it was greater than the nothingness that was there it was greater than the gloom it was greater than the coldness it was greater and light begin to dawn upon the earth no doubt the gloom and the darkness fault it tried to hold his position it tried to hold his place but the Spirit of God proved he was greater amen because today we have a son we have a moon amen the very creation the spoken word of Almighty God that said let there be light and it was so it's still hanging there today proving that the Holy Spirit is greater than gloom is greater than darkness is greater than void it's greater than emptiness is greater than all of that if you can get the Spirit of God moving there will be light that will shine amen they'll be bursts that take place there'll be a change in hearts there'll be a change in life when the Spirit of God begins to move a man he said here in the power of the devilish - tonight maybe a cancer has got us-- maybe something else has taken ahold of you some diseases even the disease of sin whatever it is it may look ever so dark and gloomy it to you now it may look like you'll never recover maybe it looked like you can't get over that TB or that prostate trouble or that lung trouble or that tumor or that condition the doctor may say that ever hope is gone but standing right by your side today ready to take you in possession stands the eyes of faith and the eyes of faces of victory through the Lord Jesus Christ he says away was Satan and his glue away was Satan in his gloom and up with the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ the faith of Almighty God faith can take his holy stand on the Rock of Ages and Pearson eagle-eyes to the stormy clouds in every ways of death and disappointments that's trying to wash away the foundation from here it'll stand there and look beyond it the skies and say God is right and this morning we can say God is right he said let there be light and that Sun is still hanging there that moon is still there you didn't get up this morning word and if the Sun was going to come up you knew by faith God spoke it it'll happen hallelujah and you can have that faith this morning you don't have to worry about it God said you're healed it's going to happen God said you're delivered it's called a happen and the Spirit of God begins to move and bring that word to pass the Spirit of God moves amen he says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things seen the very faith is that little wimp it's a will he said that little will that you have by you if you only let it take your possession tonight take you believe it and how faith in it and believe that God's Word is true you've accepted it then faith will work miracles for you but you need to take that whip and go to driving the devil off your property maybe we need some people anointed by the Spirit of God who can slip those Holy Ghost take their body take their mind take their soul take complete every fiber and go to whipping the devil out for the promises of God there will be a bride that will stand when all hell is washing away the foundations and pushing this and pushing that they'll stand regardless hey man there's something trying to work in every individual heart here today he says saying that's the truth but does it mean me he said it means whosoever will it means you and so the Spirit of God moved something that was for you say well sometimes I feel so empty well let the Spirit of God start moving sometimes I feel so depressed let the Spirit of God start moving I hadn't felt God he seems so far away let the Spirit of God start moving I'm not even talking about in this building I'm talking about and youth and small Amen we can have it in this building but most importantly we wanted in our hearts we want God changing lives and changing my heart and moving me up higher let him move in your heart let him move in your life let him move in your family let him move in your marriages let him move in the church let me move in the service let him move today and let the Spirit of God let him begin to flow like rain upon our lives the Spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there be light God had a reason for doing that Oh hallelujah God had a reason for doing that for down beneath that water were seeds he had planted down beneath all that gloom and that darkness and that void and that emptiness that was seeds lay in there and so he had a reason for saying let there be light and it had to be have sunlight to make it live and the first light that was ever given in the earth was God spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was God spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring the creation of joy and life upon the earth then the Spirit of God has it move with love and compassion on that day the first day of the creation the Sun rose and swept across his rays begin to dry up the water and made an atmosphere above and for the first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth that was a great hour but he says the world was without form and void and darkness was upon the earth nothing but complete chaos but when the world was in that condition the Spirit of God began to move on the face of the water and the entire picture was changed it was changed from total chaos to a garden of heat I've seen lives that have been changed from chaos a man that was empty and void and without car but the Spirit of God began to move it might have been in your room might have been in your car it might have been in the dark places of your life in the darkest moments with the Spirit of God begin to move and it turns you from chaos into a Garden of Eden a man is transforming power of God that'll take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it I was nothing they meant God transforming power it takes some moving of the Spirit to bring the seeds to life hey man that's why we can't stand by for some cold dead formal doctrine amen but we must have the movie of the Spirit in our church hey man is not not just in church but in everyday life you know it's possible and this is what I'm saying this for you because we can have it moving in this building but it's possible you can be sitting here every one of us has got the same senses and you can have such a headache that you can't hardly stand it and I wouldn't have no headache how do I know about your headache it's something dealing individual with you and he says that's how the Spirit of God can come into a group of people and can baptize that person in such a way that the power of God cares them to where they don't even know where their hat anymore and the next person sitting by them don't know nothing about it hey man so it's not just about Oh God moving my church moving me moving this earth moving my life amen we use it as a cop-out more we had a good service but did the service happen in your pew then it happened in your scene did it happen in your life did it change you that's what we're interested in Amy we want him to move us I don't want to ever get in that condition that the Spirit of God can fall in the building and I don't know nothing about it sir I want to be knowing what God is doing I want to be cognitive his presence he comes every service but sometimes we get bias before he realize he was here and we use the words was a great service truly it was for somebody this is a great service is not just a bunch of clapping and a Manning and great services when you came to the building and you left different that's a great service hey man and that's what we want forever individual you know it's not as we're not going in this all together yes we will be raptured all together but it is an individual walk hey man hey man he said the doctor said to me not long ago Billy you think them Pentecostal people just get excited hissing no sir I don't he said well what makes them that nervousness but they begin to have and causes them to scream and holler and go on I said doctor you mean to tell me that the nerves can be excited without something to excite them something has to excite them something so what's there I said it's an unseen force of the Holy Ghost moving among us it excites that born-again spirit hallelujah it excites that born-again spirit it brings us excitement to that spirit the power of God begins to come down faith comes by here and the Holy Ghost takes the word and it out over the people to catch it with the power that regenerated born-again life something has to cry out hey man he said god help today when they come to an adopted theology when we come to an adopted theology instead of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said God helped the day when we come to a head knowledge or an intellectual understanding instead of the baptism of the Holy Spirit because of the Spirit of God didn't begin to move and begin the world within Earth seeds wouldn't have popped out of the ground it began to create an atmosphere where seeds could come to life amen the word could be spoke but the spirit had to follow the word and bring it to pass when we'll get there in a minute he said God helped the day when we've come and adopted theology instead of the baptism of the Holy Spirit God helped the day when he took away tithers from the church and balled up some old tough rooster and sold it for fifty cents of plate to get money to pay the preacher god help the day when we substituted the upper room and made it a supper room God helped the day what we need today is a good old fashioned st. Paul revival in the Bible Holy Ghost preached back again in his power and simplicity he man he goes on the store and I love this story because the truth is still true today he said I was way up in Canada I was riding one night been waiting back about 40 or 50 miles thousands of miles from a hardtop road last fall back hunting I was riding out through the moonlight come to this little barn over place big ole bunch of big tall stately pines the moon was shining on looked like a graveyard a spooky looking place and he said all of a sudden the wind came down and the wind began to hit them and they go more just a mournful sound I've heard it I've been there myself up on Mount Lemmon I stood and looked a little bit and thought of this scripture right here yes sir talking about Joel's prophecy amen I will restore say the Lord these trees me in mind of some of those great big fine churches standing there but just as dead as a doornail he said even the pummel worms eat all the bark off of him and everything else I heard his preacher other day say that pretty good he said if you ain't careful you sisters at Palma warm eat your bark off you get it later he said I see it's been at work eating your bark off a man these trees put them onto some of those great big fine spark churches just as dead as the door now the fiery trials has blazed all the spirit away from it and there's nothing left but a big statue but just as dead as it can be and he said when the rushing mighty wind comes from heaven the only thing they can do is groan and carry on and sailing so I hardly know anything that's right they say days of miracles are past just every time God sends a revival and signs and wonders begin to come up and fall around the people they say well ah that's all right everybody else does it too and everybody else has these feelings too and everybody has this everybody got blah blah blah and it just go on and they begin to actually mark the moving of the real Holy Spirit of God is that what the palmer worm left the caterpillar even what the Methodists left the batma seen what the Baptist's left the Pierce Presbyterian ate what the Prince of material left the pentacle dog it's so a man we've just set the Scottsville camp and that man that had been raised in that Church of the Nazarenes he said we come to our services that we used to have services like this he said we don't have them no more why because the worm got in the church theologies and man-made ideas begin to eat away amen all that's moving of the Spirit and begin to turn it into a bunch of pluralism and now that same worm is against the message of the hour it's still the same word but he said I will restore hey man that will be a people who is open to the moving of the Holy Ghost that will be a people in the spirit of God moves they move with him hey man he says what is it there until they strip the church down till they got them setting just as dead as a doornail no spirit no shouting they said well we don't need that no more brother Brent apparently thought so no shouting no joy no peace no healing no nothing what the Methodists left the Baptist see what the Baptist left the cattle parading or some other Church this one eat that and that he took away this and it took away that haven't got nothing but a bunch of church creed you know that's the truth what one left the other eight until you got nothing but a big dead tree and he said every time God sends a big rush of glory down they would just sit there and moans they I don't believe it it's psychology we don't need altar calls no more we don't need a prayer line no more we don't need that no more that's just a bunch of worked up emotion somebody's got a hold of our humble workers got a hold of somebody hey man when Joel looked at that insulted gods but he said God said I will restore says the Lord if that wasn't in there I wouldn't know how to preach that's what a prophet of God said he said if that wasn't in there I would know how to preach it but I will restore saith the Lord it happened to look right night there the wind began to blow how those still fanned starching dead as it was sitting moaning and groaning didn't have no life to bend no bark on it to make it flexible we're just moaning and groaning with the account of the wind my doctor so-and-so said this and there's no mercy here and there's no more blood here and there's no more intercessor somebody's got a pommel worm in the church amen I happened to notice down underneath there was some undergrowth coming up some other bushes about like that they had life in them and when the wind began to hit them they began twisting and shouting and giving glory to Carl let me tell you brother God's going to raise up a generation God's gonna raise up a generation of people out of all this dead stop I will restore hey man green leaves clapping their hands having a wonderful time what a frolic it was but that big old tree standing there moaning and groaning then he says same wind same way what was grown and embolden others and thank you Jesus thank you Lord you want to know why I'm running because I'm running because the hearts been clean now you want to know why I'm shouting for lunch outing from a soul that's been routine how we restore says the Lord the same we're making one grow what's giving the other a good time it happy to think what was this doing doing every time that little tree would twist what would it do it pull the roots he would loosen up the ground so he could go deeper and get a better hold every time God sends his blessing upon a born-again mana one man a woman it'll only loosen up the roots so they can go deeper higher better free don't find God I will restore hey man he talks about how we can take a man we can teach him the native language of the native take him to about ten years of college ten years over here when he comes out if he goes into foreign lands he'll have to he's got a can't have to have a cane to walk on he's so old it took so long to get him there in other words is it brother the only thing you need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and an honest heart you know that's the truth wait for nothing God called you get going get moving ride the street tell somebody we need another Stephen D says when God sent Stephen down there where they tried to kill him and everything else he was like a house on fire in a windy day put it out if you can the more you fainted the worst should've get and I'd like to tell our critics the more you criticize the worse is going to get don't want power that's cool if all the Morlock go ahead and criticize go ahead and curse because the more you curse me the more God's gonna bless me hey man he says all you think I'm crazy go ahead that's alright I'm happy this way leave me where I'm at yes indeed is there was every time we need to get going it's today as I think about back in the time when Moses back there he's tall he said here he was when you say wait till you get ready when God called Moses he didn't have nothing but a hat in his hand but a stick what are you doing with that hand he said what do you got in your hand a stick take that how am I gonna whip the army well what you got in your hand is stick take that and go down what service near you pick it up and go on and away Moses went a one-man invasion why because he got in the moving other spirits in the burning bush he got a name he got his own personal experience with all he had tried it on his own and killed one Egyptian but in the power of God and the Spirit of God he went down there and he loosed every slave and he said every captive free and he destroyed Pharaoh's army why because he got into the spirit of god hey man you see Samson out there minding his own business in the cage bunch of Philistines surrounded thousands of them beginning to run a thousand of them he didn't have nothing they all these train flips team standing there he what if he said no wait wait just a moment I get out and learn how to spar wait till I learn how to do this wait maybe I can go get a sword and come back perhaps just a little while maybe I quip some of you Philistines he's not not that only team laying close to him was a job Oliver knew and he picked it up and the Spirit of God came on him and he killed a whole group of listings all he's waiting for you to do is pick up the promise of God and the Spirit of God will fall on you and you'll whup that devil you gonna dance it on top of him to you stomp a mudhole in him hallelujah he's I think about Shamgar during the time of to my mind is liberal joking preachers party done a fine job he ran up there in Indiana as I think I'll Shamgar than the time of judges over in Israel Amen here he was his family was done it was getting worse and worse they come here after year and stole their crops and here he raised up another crop and all of a sudden here's trunk trunk trunk what was it it was coming back to critisize to take back to say it wasn't real to say you don't have nothing what you have I'm going to take away but Shamgar had enough of it and when they grabbed an ox goes the Spirit of God began to fall on him he's not how do you know because the Spirit of God would have to be a one man to work 500 and it would have to take the spirit of God and it was the same spirit back in the world over the earth and it brought out of the seeds and it brought out the trees and the birds and animals and the people it was the same spirit that fell on Shamgar it was the same spirit of fennel David when he said who is that an uncircumcised for listening to challenge the armies of the Living God David only needed hearing one time because why he'd been anointed I know he had his critics - matter of fact the prophet of God didn't even know he thought well surely be this man he went through all of his sons he's like D ya God told me to come here surely you got one more song hey yeah I got another one his own dad didn't believe in him I think I want he's out there with the Sheep Sammy said go get him said we're not sitting down till it gets here Samuel he come walking in Samuel open up that barn here's the king next king of Israel dad is like what David and here this anointing David comes walking in the camp all of a sudden he hears a challenge you know Goliath got up that morning saying you know what I'm done with breakfast I'm gonna push it back that was the last day he pushed his breakfast back he's I'm gonna get up put on my armor that was the last day he put his armor he said I'm gonna get up and walk out of my tent that was the last day he walked out of his tent he's I'm gonna go down there challenge the armies of the Living God that was the last day he challenged the armies of God because there was anointed David in the camp and the Spirit of God was upon him he said this day I'm gonna take your head off do we have any of Nordic David's here this morning take a lot this is your last day you spirit this is your last day you depression is your last day this is your last moment I'm gonna take your head off the Spirit of God is upon me [Applause] you let the spirit of hims the same spirit of god that was on David that just fell on you just then a man we're not talking about another God or another spirit what I'm at the same one that began in the world of the earth it's in this field in this corner and if you will invite him to you it'll fall on you and out of your emptiness and your voice will become become a garden be what was the Spirit of God came on it was a need Martin is here was at hand something had to be done Shamgar he couldn't wait till he's had had education had enough quote and learned them all had it all figured out no he had to be a warrior he had to jump and grab what he had and go whooping Devils he's a brother what's what's that close to you tonight he said we at least got the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just an anointing but a in Philly that's the greatest weapon they're gonna be putting your hand with the word of God behind it to back it up don't let them rob you he said of every man or woman here would realize that the things that's got you divine health and everything God gave it to you at Calvary every born-again man is circumcised by the Holy Ghost you have a right to every redemptive blessing let don't let the devil rob you of not of it but what the pummel will left the caterpillar eating but this tree will grow again 1st Thessalonians 5 and verse 19 says quench not the spirit this means to quench means to extinguish or to suppress in other words when it comes don't try to push it down and say it's just a motion or a workout don't try to suppress it don't try to hold it back don't try to put it onto another service or another day in other words don't become a spiritual fire extinguisher hey man I've seen them at working in service usually they do their most damage after service cuz ain't got a nerve enough nerve to stand up in the middle of it they go out the doorway I tell you what I was a bunch of bubble dancing I was a bunch of this bunch of that oh I might have been to you but to me it was the Spirit of God amen don't become a spiritual fire see when he said you asked him to come to your church you asked him to come and near-peer you he will fall an old-fashioned way if and you're not ashamed to let loose and let him have his way if you are you'll quench him right away he says you invited him to your home and you're ashamed of him before your neighbors and you left him there and let him dare stay there on an entertaining Jesus wants to be worshipped he wants to be entertained how do you entertain Jesus say come Lord Jesus come to my pew come tomorrow I love you I want to worship you if nobody else will I will God if someone come to your house and you didn't make them welcome or entertain them they wouldn't come back many times maybe that's what's the matter tonight maybe that's what's the matter around their homes and around our churches we're afraid or shame to entertain Jesus we're afraid somebody will hear you say a man we're afraid to raise up your hands and give him praise you're ashamed because your neighbor sitting or somebody else what do I care about your neighbor worship the Lord you ask him you invited him here then worshiping when it comes [Applause] [Music] hallelujah listen you don't need the light you don't have to be ashamed of the worship that takes place in this house you don't have to be saying to these musicians they play and give their heart to Almighty God and play with all the heart you don't have to be ashamed of the preaching of the word and the moving of the spirit when he come just worship and [Applause] you can't win know how with a critic hey man just talk to a brother he left the tabernacle years a couple years before it is the boys had to split and they said well because you left the reason why it split oh really he said just me and my family left well it's what happened in a few confused sentences later why did you stay there so long you can't win with a critic so a critic way that criticize you for worshiping too much or not worshiping enough for him fine so critics gonna criticize us why they call it critic that's what they do that's who they are but I Know Who I am and I know what I do when I invite him I'm gonna worship Him when I asked him to come and he's honored to answer my request and he comes down and falls upon my heart you think I'm gonna sit there like a bump on the log no sir I'm gonna wash his feet I'm gonna cauterize neck I'm gonna entertain him while he's here hey man all right so let me read one for the critics he said I was to hope they put this on their next video he's I was talking to a man not long ago they didn't believe in music in the church he was holding the fuss with me about it he said oh the music belongs to the world I said the Spirit of God didn't come on that stood up profit until he got a minster out and begin to play a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost song you know what he's talking about he said the Spirit of God came down on the Prophet that's right God doesn't change and if God liked music and that day he likes music today he began to play a song I don't know what they played in them days but I like to imagine a good old song life there's going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet Bible that kills a lot of Church of Christ message believers and sweet by-and-by God's own son will be the leading one and they're all behind because he's already coming we can't sing that song no he's coming I can sing that song still yet today because he is going to appear and I'm going to be changed to be just like him [Applause] something like that some of those good old-fashioned Holy Ghost songs and the Spirit of God came on the Prophet he said I tell you brother when we get all the formal shackles shook off and the Spirit of God in the songs again wow and I thought his word word word work in the songs again and get back to the whole place what we can have the Spirit of God moving in the place then the Prophet can see a vision then the powers of God can come into the church then they'll see divine healing then they'll see the resurrection of Christ then they'll see he's the same yesterday today and forever come on I'm about to choke you now he said well you say 'la brother Brando I'm not a prophet well if you ain't the prophet you can be an instrument oh just keep playing if you ain't got more no more than them ten give it to them ten just as hard as you can hallelujah listeners write this down if you can't be the Prophet be part of the minstrels do something to bring the Spirit of the Lord down I wanna be one is guilty I'm bringing the Spirit of God down I don't want to be guilty of bringing a critical spirit in the church bringing my bitterness turn to my unbelief in the church I want to be guilty and I was warned they drop the Spirit of God down you say well you're making yourself nobody not somebody no I'm making myself what the Prophet said for me to make myself be do something be something to bring the Spirit of God yeah man prophet couldn't do it himself you probably couldn't do it himself he had to have the minstrel to help it yeah you know my Bible I didn't see that it was a tape player anyway when this prophet and the people got in harmony with God the Prophet begins to see things now brother if you don't see divine healing you don't see the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't see the mighty move of the Spirit of God moving in the last stage here just get in the spirit one time and you'll see those six things will be revealed to you you'll begin to notice things look different Wow ladies many hypocrites in that churches I thought there was I was a hypocrite Hey many critics and heirs I thought many of this back I was the one he said you begin to notice things look there listening what they used to be that's right and you won't go along with that criticizing spirit no more you'll come humbly he said oh I feel religious right now he said now property God got the Smiths from spin moving spirit of God come down on him cuz here brother man who said he was in the Stewart said he tried to say it different he got angry said he got mad he said well how about for some of you that didn't like that he got his righteous indignation was stirred up in other words he wasn't in the mood for the moving of the Spirit but he knew what it took to get it there why is the devil against worship because he knows what takes to get the spiritually cuz I just listen to a clip of a brother a man they got it all figured out there's no more blood no more my intercessory no more this and they got it all figured up in your head and how they got it added one plus one equals two and you couldn't pipe an 8-man out of that church ain't no spirit moving in that church dead as a doornail the same time we've got critics that said you got to take this song out we can't sing this song we can't do that okay who know who left and left you in charge all right off of me I'm going with the pillar of fire he's still here in the building he's still here moving is bride one step further to the closer to the coming of the Lord hey man he said

Amen throw it out keep on digging he said you'll hit a pasture that comes along sometimes and I wouldn't pull around with that bunch of holy rollers he said throw him out and keep digging hey man go

Fuhrman is a song leader for brother Nathan his son Ethan come up Friday night for a brought him up for prayer his young boy had been having strokes autistic brought him up for prayer Saturday night

the Spirit of God began to move is but a Joe was preaching next thing you know the power of God fell in that place and people were running and dancing and shouting his mom and told her hands up with praising garden and full Halle know how long I'll since she realized eighth and where's he at she looked down he just calmly sitting there on his pew and he's opening up his hand like this Oh will you just get somebody just to start having a little movement and start moving a little bit it's time bending a little bit in the spirit God can take over you hallelujah she started out of her seat with her boy a man because I saw astounding and I'm on the front row with her back to her sister Rebekah brother Nathan's wife but God spoke to and said you go tell I remember the sisters name what was her

know he's delivered amen you talking about a rock the throw down and some old cold form of government I want the Spirit of God in my life [Applause] that's what happened when the Spirit of God Luke he calls that which is dead back to life again it calls life to the body to a place that was void and empty but the spirit begins to murder and it changes the whole landscape man brother Joe got drunk that night he only gonna lie to you just got he one point he said please somebody get me another bottle brother and Aaron was over there trying to behave himself the Lord was just moving all of a sudden this woman on the front row we had prayed for been ended up diabetic on dialysis for 20 years the Spirit of God hit her and around that building she went giving praise and glory to hope God mighty God getting the service Saturday night when brother Aaron was preaching a woman that was sitting about the second row grabbed all her diabetic medicines and chucked it up on the altar she said I had my Shamgar moment she said I'm done with this saying hey then she was the janitor of that of that building she said but she said told her one of the things that you want to pick that up I ain't picking it up you take it throw it in the trash hallelujah that's what happened when the Spirit of God begins to move hallelujah when the spirit moves the sin loses its hope when the spirit moves changed fall off when the spirit moves grave loses his power when the Spirit of God is free to move lives are changed home to transform lives were filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah I love it so if I shout with no one shouted it's from a heart that's been clean when I run from I when I run but no one else is running it's running from a soul that's been retained there's no telling what we're gonna do the Spirit of God begins to move in this building hallelujah would it be somebody say Lord stop with man let it move in my heart let it move in my family I'm just going rejoice for me Lord Almighty God when the Spirit of God begins to move lines are changed he said when the Holy Spirit begins to move and give discernment that's what brings the presence of God among the people just like singing a hymn wow I just caught that we listened yeah I listen tapes yeah many takes hundreds of tapes one of my favorite parts I have to admit is in every one of them I mean I love the word of course but something special is a vindication for our day and discernment starts to taking place just this week the past week we got to walk down the same places brother Branham walked in mill town called Georgia Carter's house I remember when I was open buddy Craig me and brother Joe was preaching brother Craig's Labor Day meetings I preached on Georgia Carter's just part of my sermon because a lady sit in the audience she came up to me at the end that service she said you know that's amazing he said I was actually her caretaker in her later years so I got a picture of her we like to census absolutely she opened up her album her sitting buyer and looked at it oh wow and I looked a little deeper in that photo behind Georgia Carter was this little plaque sitting on her wall hanging on the wall it said I believe in the power of a living God trying to talk that one out of it when the Holy Spirit begins to move and give discernment that brings the presence of God among the people just like to singing a hymn shouting a message given in unknown tongues and it goes to critic he went out the door now it brings the Spirit of God among the people he said you heard your pastor preach many times on the word unto the spirit got among the people they just screamed out they couldn't hold their peace no longer why because the Spirit of God moved he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God the Spirit of God takes the Word of God to the congregation and feeds them so they can grow spiritually on that word it takes the Spirit of God moving amen to take the word to the people because if it ain't the Spirit of God it's man's intellectual abilities it takes the Spirit of God that's the thing that delivers the word the word goes right out the Holy Spirit follows that word wherever the words preach you'll see your pastor preach it first thing you know across the building goes a Holy Ghost that's right it's the conductor of the word amen the word so rather than word is the conductor of the Spirit because where the word is preached the spirit follows it wherever he goes why the spirit follows the word he said oh I like that he said I like sound Bible teaching and the Bible Holy Ghost coming back confirming Bible teacher hey that's what I like but I don't need no lectures I don't need no man's abilities to put this quote and splice this quote together I want the Spirit of God moving if the Holy Ghost don't conform it confirm it you're got your wires crossed ain't saying this to embarrass anybody but these speakers didn't remember how many problems we have with these speakers come in here you sit over there sound be great next day you sit there and it's bad over here just kept jumping around poor brothers pulling their hair out finally we got the master to come the engineer who engineered him he'd come walking in here guys off the plane walked in here he walked down that outlet to the top walk back down walk back up he said you got your wires crossed it took a master ten minutes and a screwdriver and then we got the sound we got today the one who engineered it the one who made the parts and put it all together and said he knew it would work he came and he proved it but at what was wrong it was two wires that was crossed a mental nice fail most speakers is positive negative positive negative something like that but on those bows they do things different is be negative positive positive negative or something like that so the last two or first two one of the other were crossed but it only took was ten minutes with the master who designed it preachers can put a sermon together they can put it this quote in that scripture and do this and do that but ten minutes or less with that master and one little tool of the Holy Spirit in his hand he can rewrite you why are you two what are you a sound out of living God with the same size the same power the same only goat Jesus Christ the same yesterday today you will hear the power of the resurrection by in the Church of here [Applause] the problem is we got too many people that's crossed the wires they tried to do the best they could they try not many of them ain't doing it out of malice or maybe hatred I don't know some of them a I don't know but this is how Paul felt first Corinthians 2 and verse 4 he said my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and a power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God that's the kind of preaching I like to hear brother Brian would say this he said today with great intellectual messages we can explain it to you can see the picture he said but that isn't what we're looking for we're looking we're not looking for the mechanics we're looking for the dynamics we got the mechanics of religions of the Bible soap bottle eyes it takes like a great 35 coach train sitting out there on the track but you ain't got a lick of steam in it to make it go down the tracks it takes the dynamics to prove to perform with the monkey mechanics and what we need now is to see that this is what we've been taught all these years this is the truth or not it's been explained over and over and over through different seminaries and churches and message churches that's me and master churches and so forth until we're looking but now we're looking to see who this person is now you say brother Branham how would you do it God is here Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is here his powers just the same in whatever ones he does not fail he cannot fail he is the Donna Mae here's God he has remained God serves we would see Jesus that's what I want to see in the service I don't want to just see a bunch of mechanics and this lying down with that if I don't see Jesus you wasted my time but if I can see Jesus and I can see him in the revealed word of this day look when he was crucified the old critic some drunken Roman soldiers come out there put a rag on his face hit him on the heads and now for your profit prophesy and tell who here to hit you he didn't clown for a devil he never opened his mouth and said a word course he knew they had passed the stick to another one said you tell us who hit you now we'll believe you see that's the critics they don't believe it but he was a prophet but he didn't clown for nobody he said well last night we had so much of the mechanics and not the dynamics he said now my body is the mechanics but my body will not operate without the dynamics the spirit operates my body brings it in control he said like an automobile with no gasoline in it no firing power no matter how fine the dynamics and the mechanics is fixed up the cylinders and the points and the plugs and whatever more and this may have a current also you get you got the hell you can have all those things he said but that's the way God is you've got to get a believer with God to make contact then something's going to happen our educational systems our denominational system has took the place of the Holy Spirit leading in the church he's on our grapevine training of Ministers and things of taking the place of all-night prayer meetings an old-time way we used to get with God instead of having preachers we got lectures men knows the word just as well they can sit there and put it together in such a way that it astounding how they do it they know the mechanics but they ain't got the dynamics he said we want the dynamics I don't care about the mechanics I want to know the dining [Applause] boy rock this fluid hit an intellectual demon right in the head he said I don't care about the mechanics I will to know the dynamics he said what good does it do he said I don't know how the car runs out there it's got Pistons and cylinders I don't know how to much pressure issues only thing I know is the dynamics put the key in there and turn it put it in the gear and drive that's what we know God made the promises I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy how is he gonna do it I can't tell you I just want to know the dynamics of God's system that's the main thing today listen Estate Minh or will fallen apart he said today we've studied the mechanics until it's all mechanical worship is mechanical responding to the words mechanical there's mechanical devices on pulpits now put that one in your pipe and smoke it it's all mechanical what good is an automobile without something in it to drive it what good is the lights or the fixtures if there's no current running through it what good is all the mechanics we've got schools educators so forth that can train a man till he can stand in the pulpit with such manners till he's an eloquent person and still don't bring the power of God where is the power that used to be in the church listen what he calls it where is the Pentecostal blessing that used to flow through the churches he said that's the reason our world has fallen apart because we got away from the real principles of God what's the real principle God get the Spirit of God in the turns let the wind blow again listen it wasn't Peter standing up on the day of a book of Acts and he began to lecture the group until he had enough smarts to go out there and begin to spread the gospel no it wasn't Peter at all Peter needed that same wind amen he said this ain't it boys just hold on he made a promise the venison was awesome I got it no you ain't got it yet hang on a little bit it's coming in about that time they got all in one mind and one Accord and the Holy Spirit blew through the place and lots of the lights of fire come upon their lives what started this whole thought was me I'll watch the little video the other day science is putting out now that actually when an egg of a female is germinated by the male it actually gives forth a burst of light they're catching it on video now and they're watching it and all of a sudden let there be light I can remember me you when you was in that dark place away from God so lost and undone void emptiness you talking about a real emptiness how many has experienced that emptiness and all of a sudden the Spirit of God began to move a man I don't see him right now but brother Justin was sitting there playing her drums it began to move over his bed one night what was it all of a sudden a hit and the light let there be light there was a wired spoke about our brother Justin there was a wired spoke about me there was a word spoke about brother Joe and Billy Craig but there and all of you let's receive the life of God it said let there be light and there wasn't no darkness it was going to hold that life back and wouldn't no void or emptyness or depression of spirits of hell they could put itself around and try to guard it and keep it from happening that spirit came through anyhow hallelujah don't you know the devil trying to block that book of Acts try to block it from happiness but the word was spoken tarry in Jerusalem until you receive power on high let there be light Polson and that light is still burning today same as the Sun millions or whatever years ago let there be in life and in 2019 six thousand years past the beginning of time it's still hanging there it's still there it's raining outside sounds like clouds must be out there it's still there it's still shining today is just as good as it is on a bright cloudless day it's still there because his word said it would be in that light broke forth on the day of Pentecost let there be light 2,000 years later it's still here that light's still burning just the same as it burned in Peter burning Paul it's back to another book of Acts again it's back to the same power the same resurrection the same life it'll bring old withered hand just like it did and bring it back to life again and play with his fingers and just smile and he who started the work he's going to finish the work hallelujah it's still burning he says in the hour let me go by he said where where is that Pentecostal blessing that used to flow through the churches that's the reason our world has fallen apart because we got away from the real principles of God the educated men got educated men into systems and things it does that's what got us into the condition we are today that's the reason our world has fallen apart another place in the terminal Ida said this and this our brother when we wonder what's the matter with our revival what's the matter we got the material we got everything we got the mechanics but where's the dynamics that's what we need to move Jesus Christ on the scene what's the matter he's not tell you there is one here today hallelujah called the Holy Ghost that can touch you off with the dynamics he is the dynamics of the mechanics we stand today us Pentecostals one of the greatest churches in the nation thousand times thousands added each year but where is the Holy Ghost we've accepted it by speaking in tongues we've seen how it's acting I listen to this Methodists accepted it by shouting Luther accepted it by faith sound like we got more Lutheran's in the message again today and so forth like that that isn't it well you just received the word by a preach well thank the Holy Ghost there I'm not receiving nothing but intellectual ideas and what you conjured up and your studying has made you mad to make you think the life is coming from you life comes from him if he ain't in it it's nothing but man-made Creed's if lives ain't being changed people say we're having amazing services but we don't need off the cost yet sitting out there they got pornography demons and act like they don't they're like people whistling in the graveyard skeletons in the closet well we got such a perfect Church because I'm preaching who fold you know we need the Holy Ghost movie don't ever settle for an intellectual sermon no sir I don't want ever be in the service that's just intellectuals and just this and that some man's Creed I want to see the Spirit of God moving and not just over there right here amen he said we stand today said Luther accepted by faith so forth like that that isn't it it's the word it's the word turned on hello it's the word turned on the light turns on the mechanics and they become the dynamics they are the Dannette dynamics when the dynamics comes to the mechanics it starts the thing rolling take the word if there's one thing missed up it won't start lay aside every weight every hism every Creed that the dynamics the Holy Spirit can flow through the word and vindicate the word that's promised of this day then the great Church of God will rise to her feet like a jet-propelled plane and take off the skies to meet her master that's exactly right until we do that it won't work that's what's about will who will do it who will keep it in this day what we're talking about remember remember remember it must be the dynamic he says there's churches churches Brides brought you've heard this quote and he's been quoted in churches bride Brides but there's got to come one I will restore sayeth the Lord there has to come a real bride it has to come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics in it makes that church live moving the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs we've got this clean looking car on the outside it's all polished but inside is the cage of every unclean and hateful bird we've allowed pornography we've allowed spirits of hell and our churches in our lives and it ain't the church fault if the words being preached and the spirit God made it to church fall it's daddy's fault it's Mama's fault his children's fault it ain't the word it ain't somebody else in the churches fault it's you and you alone but we can polish the hubs we can make it look all clean and shiny sing just certain songs what good does it do to give her a facelift when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics proved to be right there's got to be dynamic to make it work but I can promise you if the mechanics ain't right that dynamics ain't gonna make it work that's what he proved that's what Easter proved he wasn't the only the word he was God himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus cold stiff dead in the grave shake to life again and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead to the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said it all nature said he was dead and the whole world has to recognize he's alive again he was not only the mechanics he was also the dynamics hallelujah and as he being the groom the bride has come forth comes causes part of him and he can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all revelations from all all the others who spoke of the bride he can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him until the church becomes both dynamics and mechanics the Spirit of God that moved him to do the same things he did if he hit on all 16 cylinders so of the bride he said if he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I give him a charge of my than that dynamics and it to his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again at the last day that's a message Easter message the dynamics and the mechanics being one together the mechanics without the dynamics is no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout you can jump up and down you can do what you want to but deny the word it won't do no good you're just cranking the pistons got a little spark in there to fire but no gasoline to fire by it's only work as they come together so one will sit still and the other and go up that's the only thing there is yet both make it look alike both claim to be churches both claim to be bride but one has mechanics and dynamics it proves this brings the past of what he said the truth it won't it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come and when the dynamics come the fires may connect contact with an octane the gasoline and when that explodes it caused a combustion whew because I like to break forth it moves every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever that resurrection that's a real power of God mechanics with the deny dynamics the spirit that quickens the spark that fires it's not the guests at fires it's the spark that fires a gas you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things hallelujah here's the word it is the father living father sent me so send I you as a father has fired me woo as a father has he said as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything I only do that which is pleasing to God now as he sent me so send I you with the same mechanics and the same dynamics operator and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the did not dine at the mechanics and the dynamics will take place Paul said the gospel came not to us in word only not just gasoline but in spark also to make him move there you are it came to us in the manner it's the same spirit that raised him up that quick and empower the Holy Ghost to fall on a dead body in the grave who and there wasn't enough stone there to hold him in and there wasn't enough of the governor seal around it to keep it there when that word was to break forth I can imagine an old dark cold tomb all Sinemet let there be light in a body they've been laying there three days stood back he didn't have to worry about the stone it was a power for the stone hallelujah the Bible says there was angels they rolled that stone away and they sat down on it they were showing the thing that held you there greater than it when that word is Quicken at the pre-designated moment that time is to be quicken that word in your life then enough Devils to keep it from happening that's what gives me hope to keep preaching I can see people said dad on a Pew for years but I know maybe today's the moment maybe this is a time all of a sudden they'll hear a voice say let there be light and all of a sudden the Spirit of God moves and stones beginning to roll out of the way those old chains that held and begin to fall off and the spirits begin to move back and they can walk out of that old grave amen a brand new creature move out of there well I love that song listening to it only if you can feel like what I'm feeling say a man if your new creations saying man if you're born by the power of God say a man if he's still the same today as he was yesterday saying man if he was one of those that was dead in the grave and lost in sin but the Spirit of God began to rule over here and begin to pull upon you awesome that came for say man if he's here today and he's filled you with the Holy Ghost there ought to be something on the inside a man if there's something that God has done for you if he's healed your body you ought to say a man if he's touched your life you're honest a man if he's brought your lost loved ones back I would be screaming amen amen [Applause] is there somebody here with voice to praise your God to give him glory to give him honor to say Amen I say yes Lord I say yes Lord let your spirit move on me Jesus let me be the one this morning that it breaks the pole I'll be changed I'll be moved into another place into another dimension to give God free oh let's just stand to our feet everyone and just lift your hands to heaven come on young trees well yeah it's the same win let the wind of God move for you right now and the Spirit of God begin to move and the Spirit of God begin to move you say well my daughter my sons out there were lost and the Spirit of God begin to move hallelujah Oh can you say Amen hallelujah is that what I doctor said it ain't gonna do no good and the Spirit of God begin to move amen

away everything I want to be moved by the Spirit of God Spirit of God moved winblo change our lives move us into high heights deeper depths I want the dynamics this morning sure I love the word but
