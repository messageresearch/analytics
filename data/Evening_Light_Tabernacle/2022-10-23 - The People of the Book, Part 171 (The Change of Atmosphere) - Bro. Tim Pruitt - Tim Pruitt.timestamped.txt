[47:47] May the Holy Spirit just go to where you
[47:49] are and minister to you hold in my hands
[47:52] a couple of prayer cloths I'm going to
[47:54] send to Washington State to Sister
[47:56] Debbie Ray this asked for prayer I know
[47:59] she mentioned cancer and other things
[48:01] God knows every need and we believe that
[48:05] nothing will stand before our prayers
[48:08] not even cancer
[48:10] so we're looking to the Lord today for
[48:12] deliverance for this need
[48:15] man I remember when I sent it over to
[48:17] South Africa the little woman with third
[48:21] stage rectal cancer
[48:23] and got healed her
[48:25] I believe he's still the same God
[48:28] I believe the prayer face shall save the
[48:30] sick and God shall raise them up
[48:32] I believe that healing is a children's
[48:35] bread
[48:36] we're going to send this little sister
[48:38] some bread this morning
[48:40] amen healing in the name of Jesus

[55:55] in the prayer line and and
[55:57] um and different times after the service
[55:59] and the special meetings and this is a
[56:02] result of that amen she's made that

[56:08] for that amen God bless you if you'll be

[56:17] wanted to tell you brother Timothy and I
[56:20] are leaving for Switzerland we're having
[56:22] meetings from there I wonder how many of
[56:25] you enjoyed Brother David Mayer when he
[56:27] was here did you enjoy that amen well
[56:30] that comes with the price
[56:32] so you know we have to go and pay up so
[56:37] you know
[56:38] um you know we just can't have a mouth
[56:40] has come our way without also going
[56:43] there to and trying to help out and it's
[56:45] been a long time since I've been over
[56:47] there we was there during the Easter
[56:50] Camp
[56:50] um some years ago now four or five years
[56:53] ago I can't remember the date but anyway
[56:55] we're going back again and there's a
[56:58] couple hundred people Gathering there
[56:59] from England and Belgium and Switzerland
[57:02] and France and
[57:04] um and several other places and a lot
[57:06] more tuning in than Serbia Croatia
[57:09] different other places over there so
[57:11] going to be quite a few that will be uh
[57:14] you know joining with us in those
[57:16] meetings if they're not physically there
[57:18] but maybe uh in the broadcast and so you
[57:22] know it's the way that the gospel has a
[57:24] spreading around the world
[57:26] amen and so we just pray that God would
[57:30] bless us in a great day wait today in
[57:34] his presence amen Genesis 18 verse 1 and
[57:38] the Lord appeared unto him in the plains
[57:40] of mammary and he sat in the tent Door
[57:43] In the Heat of the day and verse 9 and
[57:46] they said unto him where is Sarah thy
[57:47] wife and he said behold in the tent
[57:50] and he said I will certainly return unto
[57:53] thee according to the time of life and
[57:55] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[57:59] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[58:01] was behind him and how Abraham and Sarah
[58:03] were old and well-stricken in age and it
[58:06] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[58:09] of women therefore Sarah laughed within
[58:12] herself saying after I'm old waxed old
[58:15] shall I have pleasure my Lord being
[58:17] older also
[58:19] and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore
[58:21] did Sarah laugh saying shall have a
[58:24] church he bear a child which him all is
[58:26] anything too hard for the Lord at the
[58:29] time appointed I will return unto thee
[58:31] according to the time of life and Sarah
[58:34] shall have a son then Sarah denied
[58:37] Saiyan I laughed not for she was afraid
[58:40] and he said neighbor thou did his life
[58:42] God bless you can be seated
[58:45] I'm going to speak today on the changing
[58:49] the Change of Atmosphere
[58:52] The Winds of Change are blowing across
[58:55] the world as we know it today and
[58:58] we are entered into a very very
[59:00] different season it's a very serious
[59:02] time that we're living and ever everyone
[59:07] no matter who you talk to whether it
[59:10] even be the news you listen to everyone
[59:12] is feeling restless and we know that
[59:15] something bad is foreboding in the world
[59:17] and we have had a pandemics that we have
[59:21] just passed through and still are
[59:23] threatened by and the viruses that have
[59:26] killed Millions shut down world
[59:28] economies brought back brought about
[59:31] global inflation
[59:33] and this is brought about
[59:36] um even with all of this in the midst of
[59:38] all of this it brings about rampant
[59:40] voter fraud and throughout the nation
[59:43] we have elected a Catholic President and
[59:46] a woman vice president
[59:48] Royal Purple
[59:50] and we have a a new woke agenda from our
[59:55] government that has weakened our
[59:57] military
[59:59] and the same agenda is destroying our
[1:00:02] educational system
[1:00:04] and and the American families
[1:00:07] and the spirit of lawlessness has
[1:00:10] increased across our nation
[1:00:12] as we hear the cries defund the police
[1:00:15] and and then riotin in the cities and
[1:00:19] Rising crime
[1:00:21] and brother Brandon talked about this he
[1:00:24] said um uh himself when he when he
[1:00:27] referred to such times like this he he
[1:00:31] can compare it to a lamb that was out
[1:00:34] eating in the field
[1:00:36] and the little poor the poor little
[1:00:38] fellow couldn't see nothing but he
[1:00:40] begins to feel Restless even though he's
[1:00:43] not seeing anything he's he senses
[1:00:45] something's wrong that there's something
[1:00:47] fixing to happen because crouching over
[1:00:50] in the bushes is a lion coming up
[1:00:53] and it's just something about it he
[1:00:55] can't tell it but he knows something is
[1:00:58] fixing to happen
[1:01:00] he can he can't see the line but he
[1:01:02] knows something is wrong and that's the
[1:01:04] way it is today that there is a setting
[1:01:08] scene today with all the conglomeration
[1:01:11] of Blackness and darkness and sin and
[1:01:14] things that are going on the world
[1:01:15] they're actually setting the stage for
[1:01:18] the greatest drama that was ever acted
[1:01:21] out in all the ages the coming of Jesus
[1:01:24] Christ
[1:01:25] now if you actually look back in the
[1:01:28] days of Sarah and Abraham they were
[1:01:30] actually actors on the the stage as it
[1:01:34] was and they were prophesying of end
[1:01:37] time events
[1:01:39] and so
[1:01:40] um again they they were in this
[1:01:43] situation but Sarah was not quite in the
[1:01:46] spirit of what was happening
[1:01:49] you see she was sitting back there
[1:01:52] um perhaps confused as to what was going
[1:01:55] on and hearing the Angels reported she
[1:01:58] just couldn't somehow believe that that
[1:02:01] was true
[1:02:02] now but of course you know we can't have
[1:02:06] the last day until people get in the
[1:02:09] spirit of the last days
[1:02:10] we can't have a healing service unless
[1:02:13] people get in the spirit of of a healing
[1:02:16] service you you know that the atmosphere
[1:02:19] has to be right
[1:02:20] and we we cannot have a feeling of the
[1:02:23] Holy Ghost unless the atmosphere is
[1:02:25] right for people to get in that kind of
[1:02:28] an atmosphere and it's in the right
[1:02:31] atmosphere that the Holy Ghost comes
[1:02:33] remember when the day of Pentecost was
[1:02:36] fully come it was where when the
[1:02:39] atmosphere became right that's when the
[1:02:41] Holy Spirit came down
[1:02:43] and of course
[1:02:45] um you know the the people was
[1:02:49] um in the atmosphere back in the days of
[1:02:53] Sodom and Gomorrah that we are reading
[1:02:55] about these days that that to bring
[1:02:58] judgment upon the earth and the Angels
[1:03:00] were coming down and mixing with human
[1:03:02] beings and as far as walking among them
[1:03:06] and they were they were um looking there
[1:03:09] looking and judging the the the the the
[1:03:13] fruits of the people upon the Earth
[1:03:16] and uh and of course they they're in the
[1:03:19] same atmosphere today and brother
[1:03:21] Branham told us we are also in another
[1:03:24] time of investigating Angels where that
[1:03:27] they are looking for something they're
[1:03:30] looking they're looking to hear as um as
[1:03:33] uh God would say to Abraham I've come
[1:03:36] down to see if the report of these sins
[1:03:39] is true or not and and if it is I will
[1:03:42] know and so he sends Angels down there
[1:03:45] to investigate and and of course he
[1:03:48] comes to Sarah and he's looking for
[1:03:51] Faith and this is what God is looking
[1:03:53] for in this last day God is looking for
[1:03:57] somebody who will believe him whose
[1:03:59] Hearts have been turned back to
[1:04:01] believing again but of course we look at
[1:04:04] the age that we're living in that's like
[1:04:07] Sodom and Gomorrah that their their
[1:04:09] marriage and and giving and marriage and
[1:04:11] divorce and remarriage and then you know
[1:04:14] just cohabiting and all kinds a sin of
[1:04:17] the uh you know of drinking and and um
[1:04:20] carousing and so on and
[1:04:23] um the glory of God of course is also
[1:04:26] being preached and demonstrated in the
[1:04:29] power of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:31] and uh it sets forth a example of the
[1:04:34] resurrection of Jesus Christ and and it
[1:04:39] shows us that God is going to take a
[1:04:41] church into glory and I believe even the
[1:04:44] atmospheres that we can see that are
[1:04:47] changing Even in our in our church in
[1:04:49] the church body and the and the ministry
[1:04:52] that is going for us it's being preached
[1:04:54] with certain expectation with certain
[1:04:57] atmospheres producing certain atmosphere
[1:05:00] because that we know just as certain as
[1:05:03] I'm standing here Jesus Christ is coming
[1:05:06] back to the Earth again for a people but
[1:05:10] at the same time men are ignoring that
[1:05:12] and paying no attention to it or walking
[1:05:14] away from it because they are in the
[1:05:17] spirit of the last days
[1:05:20] and the atmosphere is coming right for
[1:05:22] this now for Sarah there had to come A
[1:05:25] Change of Atmosphere in her life
[1:05:28] and man in order to receive the promised
[1:05:30] son I just want to say she's typing the
[1:05:32] bride and so there has to be a change of
[1:05:36] atmosphere within the bride of Christ
[1:05:39] where she comes under the expectancy of
[1:05:42] seeing the miraculous and recognizing
[1:05:45] the presence of God Among Us the there
[1:05:48] had to become a Change of Atmosphere in
[1:05:51] Sarah's life in order for her to receive
[1:05:54] the promised son
[1:05:56] and the same thing it is we we cannot
[1:05:58] just sit and lay Ode to see in
[1:06:00] conditions and and um you know locks and
[1:06:05] um rich and increasing Goods saying we
[1:06:07] have need of nothing and expect expect
[1:06:10] the coming of the Lord we've got to get
[1:06:13] in the spirit of his coming now brother
[1:06:16] Branham told us I don't look for Revival
[1:06:18] in this generation he said I look for
[1:06:20] the coming of the Lord but with the
[1:06:22] coming of the Lord does come Revival
[1:06:24] it is a restoration it is Reviving it is
[1:06:28] a refilling of the Holy Ghost it's an
[1:06:31] outpouring of his spirit
[1:06:33] and and so again you see the The Church
[1:06:37] Must Get in the atmosphere in order to
[1:06:40] receive the promised son
[1:06:43] now Sarah was barren
[1:06:46] she was sitting in her tent in unbelief
[1:06:49] how much longer can Sarah sit there
[1:06:52] and I just want to say that about the
[1:06:54] bride of Christ how much longer can we
[1:06:57] just sit in the tent
[1:06:59] and sit there you know wear it like
[1:07:02] Sarah did Sarah had loud bitterness to
[1:07:06] rule within her
[1:07:07] she had come to a point that rather than
[1:07:10] easily believe in the promise and
[1:07:13] receiving it she would actually laugh at
[1:07:15] the promise and so you see she had let
[1:07:18] bitterness rule in her life you know
[1:07:22] there's many of people make that mistake
[1:07:24] and this is what happens to their
[1:07:26] marriage or in their home or even in
[1:07:29] their Church it drives them out of the
[1:07:31] house of God they start letting
[1:07:32] bitterness rule in their life
[1:07:35] and and so this was Sarah she had just
[1:07:39] kind of got bitter at life sitting back
[1:07:41] in the chin and and I'm not expecting
[1:07:45] the Fulfillment of the promise of God
[1:07:47] now I want to tell you you must rule
[1:07:50] your atmosphere
[1:07:52] you see you must rule your thoughts you
[1:07:56] know what you think will Define you what
[1:07:59] you dwell upon and what you're thinking
[1:08:01] on will become what you are they become
[1:08:04] words and words become actions and
[1:08:06] action becomes in deeds and deeds become
[1:08:09] uh who you are and you become associated
[1:08:13] then with those bitterness that
[1:08:16] bitterness but I I want you to know that
[1:08:19] if you can ever get your heart turned to
[1:08:21] Faith that faith will change your
[1:08:24] vocabulary it'll take it from it'll
[1:08:28] never happen to me or it's impossible
[1:08:31] for me or looks like the promises you
[1:08:34] know are way off from me and my children
[1:08:36] will never come in well I'll never have
[1:08:38] that promised child or I I'll never get
[1:08:41] over this sickness or I can't Rise Above
[1:08:44] This problem you see you when when Faith
[1:08:47] Comes interchange your vocabulary it'll
[1:08:50] take away the I can't and put in I can I
[1:08:55] can do all things through Christ that
[1:08:57] strengthens me so with his power I can
[1:09:00] do this you see Sarah had let her
[1:09:05] barrenness Define her and I want you to
[1:09:08] know you cannot allow your baroness to
[1:09:11] Define you well it's been a long time
[1:09:14] God doesn't really love me I hadn't felt
[1:09:17] the spirit of God in years do not let
[1:09:20] baroness Define you that is not who you
[1:09:23] are you are a people of promise
[1:09:26] you are a people of faith you're not a
[1:09:30] people of defeat I mean you're not to
[1:09:32] have a victim mentality but an
[1:09:34] overcoming mentality because he said to
[1:09:38] the Leo to see an age to him that
[1:09:40] overcometh so there has to be somebody
[1:09:42] in this age overcome
[1:09:46] now so you see we can we cannot let
[1:09:49] whatever situation we are going through
[1:09:51] Define us amen we cannot look at our
[1:09:56] problems and let that Define Who We Are
[1:10:00] the trouble in our families don't let
[1:10:02] that Define your family
[1:10:05] that may be what you went through and
[1:10:07] what you've been but that's not who you
[1:10:09] are you are the child of the most high
[1:10:12] God you are a possessor of Heaven and
[1:10:15] Earth you are you are the sons and
[1:10:18] daughters of the king so you don't let
[1:10:21] anything negative Define you you take
[1:10:24] the word and let it Define you and so
[1:10:27] who you are I am a bloodbot blood loss
[1:10:31] son of daughter daughter of the Living
[1:10:33] God
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:10:39] you need to look at your situation
[1:10:42] and say I'm not going to let it Define
[1:10:44] me
[1:10:48] I will not take on the name of this
[1:10:50] sickness
[1:10:52] this problem
[1:10:54] this debt my failures
[1:10:58] that's not who I am
[1:11:01] that is not my day what defines me now
[1:11:04] Sarah had let this Define her
[1:11:06] until she become bitter
[1:11:09] oh it'll never happen for me she had
[1:11:11] given up on the promise
[1:11:13] I'm going to tell you friend she was
[1:11:15] right on the right in the the very face
[1:11:19] right on the cusp of her promise being
[1:11:22] fulfilled and she was about to miss it
[1:11:28] but there's something about God
[1:11:31] when he prophesies
[1:11:34] when he puts it in his word when he says
[1:11:37] I'll have a bride without spotted
[1:11:39] wrinkle or blemish
[1:11:41] Hallelujah when he puts in his word what
[1:11:43] you're going to be amen that God's going
[1:11:46] to bring you the past and he's going to
[1:11:48] work until he brings it to pass
[1:11:58] now
[1:12:00] when you get to where you should be in
[1:12:03] your faith
[1:12:04] then you can be like the shunamite woman
[1:12:06] and say all is well
[1:12:12] don't give up
[1:12:15] until you get to where your faith is
[1:12:18] reaching the level of God's promise
[1:12:22] now
[1:12:23] you are you see you are you are not
[1:12:27] built to remain in the valley
[1:12:31] you may have had things in your life
[1:12:33] that has blowed you down
[1:12:35] and you're sitting down maybe on the
[1:12:38] lowest of the lowest limbs
[1:12:41] but I want to remind you you're still an
[1:12:43] eagle
[1:12:45] just because storms have blowed you down
[1:12:47] just because trouble has got you down
[1:12:50] just because that it doesn't seem like
[1:12:53] it's ever going to happen for me
[1:12:55] does it mean that you're not an eagle
[1:12:58] anymore
[1:12:59] are you with me amen you were made to
[1:13:03] fly with the Eagles where all things are
[1:13:05] possible to them that believe
[1:13:08] you are to rule the skies in other words
[1:13:11] you are to rule the atmospheres
[1:13:16] but right now Sarah is letting her
[1:13:18] atmosphere rule her
[1:13:24] and
[1:13:25] God comes to visit
[1:13:28] because he has to birth faith in Sarah's
[1:13:33] heart first
[1:13:36] you see words have been spoke of her
[1:13:38] many years before
[1:13:39] but she just regarded them as for
[1:13:42] somebody else
[1:13:45] you know uh her years of baroness had
[1:13:48] taken this toll and
[1:13:50] she believed the promise was true for
[1:13:52] Abraham
[1:13:53] but not for her
[1:13:55] you see it wasn't possible for her she
[1:13:58] she kind of had a victim mentality
[1:14:02] and God had to change her to a
[1:14:05] restoration mentality
[1:14:08] and this is what God wants to do with
[1:14:11] you he wants to take you from where
[1:14:12] you've always been the victim
[1:14:15] to where that you can be the victor
[1:14:20] word that you've always lived a defeated
[1:14:22] life and and baroness and I you know you
[1:14:25] just not ever been on what you're
[1:14:27] supposed to be and you never quit cloudy
[1:14:30] attained and you'd never been good
[1:14:31] enough God wants to change you from an
[1:14:35] atmosphere of unbelief to a restoration
[1:14:37] mentality
[1:14:40] for he said I will restore saith the
[1:14:43] Lord
[1:14:45] now you see it's kind of about a
[1:14:48] mentality I've talked about quite a bit
[1:14:50] a slave mentality
[1:14:53] you see Sarah had to get rid of the
[1:14:55] victim mentality that enslaved her
[1:15:00] Victory starts in the mind first
[1:15:06] I want you to get this right I want you
[1:15:09] to get it this is the womb to the soul
[1:15:12] the mind is the Gateway
[1:15:15] and victory starts in the mind first
[1:15:19] that's why that of the right mental
[1:15:23] attitude toward the Divine promise will
[1:15:26] bring it to pass
[1:15:28] and as long as you've got this poor me
[1:15:30] it'll never happen for me I I can never
[1:15:34] do it we can never attain we might as
[1:15:36] well give up this this is what defines
[1:15:39] who I am as long as you have that then
[1:15:43] that raw mental attitude will come out
[1:15:46] of your mouth and you will be speaking
[1:15:48] unbelief
[1:15:50] and fear and doubt rather than faith and
[1:15:55] only faith can create
[1:16:00] now so you see Victory starts in the
[1:16:03] mind first
[1:16:04] some mental right mental attitude toward
[1:16:07] the promise of God is what must be I can
[1:16:11] be I can do all things through Christ's
[1:16:13] strength
[1:16:14] everybody who's going to bless me in the
[1:16:17] field he's going to bless me wherever I
[1:16:19] go His blessings upon me his love is
[1:16:23] upon me amen he is he's put his love
[1:16:26] upon me he's going to bring into my life
[1:16:29] what what he is to design for me to be
[1:16:31] you see Sarah had been prophesied over
[1:16:35] but she began to believe that the
[1:16:38] promise you know carried so it's not for
[1:16:41] me it's not for me it couldn't be for me
[1:16:43] it's got to be for somebody else or else
[1:16:45] it would have happened and now it's
[1:16:47] beyond you know even what I could ever
[1:16:50] believe before I could believe this when
[1:16:52] I was young I could believe this when I
[1:16:54] was healthy and a young girl but I can't
[1:16:57] believe it now it is past
[1:17:00] but that's when God likes to work
[1:17:03] when it becomes impossible for man then
[1:17:06] God steps in and works
[1:17:11] because he's the one who can do the
[1:17:14] impossible
[1:17:16] now Joseph for example Joseph was a
[1:17:20] slave down in Egypt
[1:17:21] and you know he that he had had dreams
[1:17:25] and prophecies over him
[1:17:27] right
[1:17:28] and yet so far it didn't ever it wasn't
[1:17:31] producing nothing but slavery and
[1:17:34] captivity and
[1:17:36] abuse and false accusations
[1:17:40] lies and imprisonments
[1:17:45] he could have easily looked at the
[1:17:47] promise and said well you know I missed
[1:17:49] it
[1:17:51] it's not for me the prophecy ain't for
[1:17:53] me it ain't going to happen like it said
[1:17:56] I mean I had this vision of the 12 stars
[1:17:59] and the Sun and the Moon balling before
[1:18:01] me I had this vision of the of the
[1:18:04] twelve sheaves bound before me I had all
[1:18:06] of that but it's not for me it's never
[1:18:08] going to happen it'd be impossible for
[1:18:10] it to happen in my condition
[1:18:13] you see after all of these years of
[1:18:15] trying to believe I'm just still Barren
[1:18:18] it's never never been fruitful in my
[1:18:20] life
[1:18:21] but you see you see Joseph had to see
[1:18:25] himself differently
[1:18:27] than his situation
[1:18:31] he had to see himself as an overcomer as
[1:18:35] a Victor
[1:18:37] and so even though he sold into slavery
[1:18:40] he excels into positions
[1:18:44] is that right he didn't just sit there
[1:18:47] in his bitterness and say well I'm so
[1:18:49] down here you know you got to look at
[1:18:52] even the wisdom of God how did he
[1:18:55] orchestrated the whole thing how in the
[1:18:57] world is he going to ever reach this
[1:18:59] position of governor of Egypt and he
[1:19:01] don't even know their language
[1:19:03] did you ever notice when he spoke in the
[1:19:06] Egyptian tongues his brother didn't
[1:19:07] understand him
[1:19:09] right they spoke a different language he
[1:19:12] had to be sent and and abased in order
[1:19:15] to be prepared to sit on the throne
[1:19:19] I'm telling you everything that you have
[1:19:21] been going through is only preparing you
[1:19:25] for your moment of victory
[1:19:30] the heartaches the stress the Weeping
[1:19:33] the crying the baroness the hurt
[1:19:37] everything has only been preparing you
[1:19:40] for your victory
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:19:52] he was a slave down in Egypt
[1:19:55] but in order to get from being a slave
[1:19:58] to the government Governor he had to see
[1:20:00] himself as a Victor
[1:20:02] an overcomer
[1:20:04] this is why you've got to start seeing
[1:20:06] yourself
[1:20:08] your name is not defeat
[1:20:10] your name is not barren
[1:20:13] your name is not I can't do it
[1:20:16] your name is I'm an overcomer
[1:20:20] I Will Rise Above This
[1:20:23] you see no matter how many times that
[1:20:26] Joseph tried to get up he was pushed
[1:20:29] down
[1:20:31] you see every time that he almost raised
[1:20:34] and thought Oh My this is going to be it
[1:20:37] now and I'm I'm going to I'm gonna I'm
[1:20:40] gonna raise it you see my brothers will
[1:20:42] come and now I'm head of Potiphar's
[1:20:45] house and uh glory to God he'll see me
[1:20:48] in an important position with an
[1:20:50] important man one of the leaders in
[1:20:52] Egypt and now see they'll see and
[1:20:55] they'll have to recognize
[1:20:57] but that wasn't what God's plan was
[1:21:01] so he almost achieves only to drop down
[1:21:04] again
[1:21:05] so then it gets put in jail
[1:21:09] on a lie
[1:21:10] trying to do right
[1:21:16] are you with me you think well if I do
[1:21:18] everything right it's just going to be a
[1:21:20] Bed of Roses yeah but they got thorns
[1:21:26] amen yeah there'll be roses along the
[1:21:29] way but there's going to be a lot of
[1:21:30] thorns in that too
[1:21:32] are you with me I mentioned Joseph again
[1:21:35] he almost achieves and he's now made you
[1:21:38] know again he's not just set back in
[1:21:41] bitterness but he reaches toward the
[1:21:44] promise even when he's in prison
[1:21:47] and he becomes the head of the prison if
[1:21:50] God placed me here I'm going to excel
[1:21:52] while I'm here
[1:21:54] that ought to be your attitude Wherever
[1:21:57] You Are
[1:21:58] Amen in your walk with God you ought to
[1:22:00] say wherever I am God's going to excel
[1:22:03] right here until God moves me higher
[1:22:08] I'm gonna be faithful
[1:22:10] now here again you know it looks like
[1:22:14] it's man it's just going to come to pass
[1:22:16] you know what my brothers will get down
[1:22:18] here to Egypt and and I'll tell you what
[1:22:20] will happen that you know they will they
[1:22:22] will uh
[1:22:23] um they will surely see me
[1:22:26] um because you know my brothers are
[1:22:28] Scallywags they'll get in prison down
[1:22:30] here and they'll get thrown in jail and
[1:22:32] when they do well they'll see me I'll be
[1:22:34] the head of the prisons
[1:22:36] but God had more for him
[1:22:40] more
[1:22:42] did you hear the song More
[1:22:46] I want more
[1:22:48] don't be satisfied Where You Are
[1:22:51] there's more for you
[1:22:53] stay in his presence but expect more
[1:22:57] so Joseph was a slave and and now he
[1:23:00] comes into prison and no matter but no
[1:23:03] matter how many times he gets pushed
[1:23:05] down he had to get up again and again
[1:23:08] and that's what I'm saying to you if
[1:23:10] you've been pushed down if you've been
[1:23:12] disappointed get up one more time
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:18] Sarah is saying I'm in the tent there
[1:23:20] ain't no need for me to get up but God
[1:23:22] comes to her and say get up
[1:23:25] I got more plans for you than that
[1:23:28] baroness and that bitterness and that
[1:23:30] unbelief I am going to make you a woman
[1:23:33] of faith
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:41] listen
[1:23:43] God wants us to be a people
[1:23:46] who believe in his promise
[1:23:50] who believes for ourselves
[1:23:54] that it's just not oh I believe brother
[1:23:56] Branham could do that and I believe
[1:23:58] brother Tim could do that or I believe
[1:24:01] God wants you to end a place where you
[1:24:03] believe that your prayers means
[1:24:06] something to God
[1:24:10] the children of Israel when they was
[1:24:12] leaving Egypt I'd like to point out to
[1:24:14] Exodus 3 and verse 21.
[1:24:16] and I will give this people favor in the
[1:24:19] sight of the Egyptians
[1:24:21] and it shall come to pass that when you
[1:24:23] go you shall not go out empty now listen
[1:24:25] they are again another type another
[1:24:28] prophecy of an Endtime people
[1:24:31] they are in their Exodus
[1:24:34] which they are typing us
[1:24:36] and in their Exodus what does he say
[1:24:38] when you go you're not going out of here
[1:24:41] empty
[1:24:43] but every woman shall borrow of her
[1:24:46] neighboring of her that sojourneth in
[1:24:48] her house jewels of silver and jewels of
[1:24:52] gold and Rhema and you shall put them
[1:24:55] upon your sons and upon your daughters
[1:24:57] and you shall spoil the Egyptians
[1:25:01] now think about this here they are
[1:25:03] leaving going to the promised land and
[1:25:05] they have been slaves 400 years slaves
[1:25:10] they're great dad their great granddaddy
[1:25:12] was a slave their great great granddaddy
[1:25:14] was a slave that's all they knew listen
[1:25:16] they were full of uh they were victims
[1:25:18] they were they were full of of slave
[1:25:21] mentality
[1:25:23] we'll know we how could we be the people
[1:25:25] of God how could we ever do anything how
[1:25:28] could we ever rise above all of this
[1:25:31] and God said I tell you what when you're
[1:25:33] going
[1:25:34] I don't want you going out here looking
[1:25:37] like slaves
[1:25:39] [Applause]
[1:25:43] I want you to call go out of here with
[1:25:45] the finest the finest garments
[1:25:50] I want you to go out of here with gold
[1:25:52] and Raymond and silver and every kind of
[1:25:56] wealth I don't want you leaving here
[1:25:58] like you're a victim I don't want you
[1:26:02] leaving here like you're a slave because
[1:26:05] today you're no longer a Slave
[1:26:09] or if that could get in the heart of the
[1:26:11] pride we're not going to leave out of
[1:26:13] here as victims and slaves and with the
[1:26:17] slave mentality but God has made sure to
[1:26:21] address you in the Garment of his word
[1:26:23] with gold with silver with abundance
[1:26:27] with healing with Miracles with signs
[1:26:29] with wonders
[1:26:31] Hallelujah with powers of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:34] and you're not going to leave out of
[1:26:36] here looking like a bunch of Rejects
[1:26:39] but by elect my bride My Chosen and
[1:26:44] you're not a victim anymore and you're
[1:26:46] not a slave anymore but you're mine
[1:26:55] mine
[1:26:58] you look like the King's Daughter
[1:27:01] Gold Silver and fine Raymond
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:07] the children of Israel had this trip
[1:27:09] Egypt of their wealth
[1:27:12] it's doing so they got payment for the
[1:27:15] years of captivity
[1:27:19] forever striped to God
[1:27:21] for all the beatens that they had
[1:27:24] for all the times that they were misused
[1:27:27] and abused
[1:27:29] God made sure they got paid back before
[1:27:32] they left
[1:27:35] and no matter how much Satan has abused
[1:27:37] you no matter what much evil has
[1:27:40] befallen you
[1:27:42] God is going to make sure this bride is
[1:27:46] not going to leave here in a defeated
[1:27:48] condition but looking and acting address
[1:27:51] if the Ravens of the Queen of Heaven
[1:27:56] pay back Satan it is now payday we're
[1:28:01] gonna we're gonna get paid back for all
[1:28:03] the evil that you've done for what you
[1:28:06] did to our bodies so what you get for
[1:28:08] our children to what you did in our
[1:28:10] family to what you did to all of it
[1:28:12] there is coming a great payday
[1:28:20] all right
[1:28:33] guess who
[1:28:35] is Barren when we leave
[1:28:39] guess who is stripped
[1:28:41] when we leave
[1:28:43] guess who is poor when we lead
[1:28:47] foreign
[1:28:51] the devil
[1:28:53] now so you see God wanted them to
[1:28:57] realize
[1:28:59] they were not poor and slaves but rich
[1:29:04] he wanted them to ditch
[1:29:06] their their slave mentality
[1:29:10] for a restoration mentality
[1:29:15] you see they were not going to the land
[1:29:18] as slaves and vagabonds God wanted them
[1:29:22] to see themselves in a new light
[1:29:26] this is why he comes to Sarah
[1:29:29] she's got to see herself in a new light
[1:29:33] because right now she's so full of
[1:29:36] unbelief
[1:29:37] that when an angel of God announced when
[1:29:40] Jehovah God himself is standing in front
[1:29:42] of her telling her what's going to
[1:29:44] happen she disbelieves in the face of
[1:29:47] God
[1:29:54] as I look at this for a moment
[1:29:56] I want you to think of this like Israel
[1:30:00] we're going out of here the Bible said
[1:30:02] they went out with a high hand
[1:30:05] and what I want to say this how we're
[1:30:08] going to leave from here we're going out
[1:30:09] in New Clothes
[1:30:13] fully dressed in new bodies
[1:30:16] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:30:19] eye
[1:30:20] everything that the devil stole got back
[1:30:23] again
[1:30:25] now the last miracle God would do did
[1:30:29] for Sarah was to make her young again
[1:30:34] fixing the original problem
[1:30:37] and in doing that he bypassed the
[1:30:40] natural processes
[1:30:42] and to prove it all
[1:30:44] and I think it's amazing
[1:30:46] that in the story of Sarah and Abraham
[1:30:48] and we'll maybe get to it a little later
[1:30:50] again
[1:30:52] but uh there is King abimelech once this
[1:30:54] 90 year old for a wife
[1:30:57] she is so restored
[1:31:00] that he wants her womb for his own seed
[1:31:04] foreign
[1:31:05] remember this this is the devil this is
[1:31:08] what he's out to do he wants to see that
[1:31:12] the womb of Sarah for his own
[1:31:15] he did this to Eve come on he he done
[1:31:19] this now to Sarah he's doing it to the
[1:31:21] church he wants her womb to reproduce
[1:31:24] himself in there
[1:31:27] now
[1:31:28] but you see King abimelech looked at
[1:31:31] this 90 year old woman and wanted her
[1:31:33] for a wife she was so made new and so
[1:31:38] restored that this old woman
[1:31:41] well-stricken an age
[1:31:42] she would actually live 37 more years
[1:31:46] after the birth of Isaac and and and the
[1:31:50] and razor son Isaac to manhood
[1:31:54] think of this I mean she didn't just
[1:31:55] have strength to give forth she had
[1:31:57] strength to live another almost 40 years
[1:32:01] raise her son to manhood
[1:32:04] and and Abraham after his body was now
[1:32:07] dead that's what the Bible said was so
[1:32:10] changed that he lived another 75 years
[1:32:13] and was so full of Vitality at nearly
[1:32:16] 140 years old that he be got six more
[1:32:19] Sons even after Sarah's death now how's
[1:32:22] that for restoration
[1:32:26] yeah
[1:32:28] now the first miracle that Jesus did
[1:32:32] when he began his Earthly Ministry was
[1:32:34] at a wedding feast
[1:32:36] we are now at another wedding feast
[1:32:39] remember brother Branham even tells us
[1:32:41] America you have been called to a
[1:32:44] wedding feast and you refuse to come
[1:32:47] and and so again they at the wedding
[1:32:51] Feast that Jesus went to
[1:32:53] they ran out of wine
[1:32:56] and and when they did Jesus bypass all
[1:33:00] of nature I want you to think about this
[1:33:03] you see to bring water into wine he
[1:33:07] actually bypassed the seed
[1:33:10] the leaves the vine the grapes
[1:33:15] in other words the fruit he didn't he
[1:33:17] didn't wait for the the
[1:33:19] cluster of Vine of grape to uh cluster
[1:33:23] grapes to to grow and for the vine to
[1:33:26] grow up he bypassed a squeezing of the
[1:33:29] juice
[1:33:31] the weeks of preparation are processing
[1:33:34] the wine
[1:33:36] you see he took water and he bypassed
[1:33:40] the entire process
[1:33:43] and took water which would have been
[1:33:45] lined by coming up through the grapevine
[1:33:47] into the fruit and mashed out and then
[1:33:50] made into wine Jesus bypassed that for
[1:33:53] his first miracle
[1:33:55] his last miracle I want you to get this
[1:33:59] he will do the same thing for his bride
[1:34:02] people he's going to bypass the natural
[1:34:06] processes
[1:34:08] you see you see as I quote from Brother
[1:34:11] Branham he's God you fail to see who he
[1:34:13] is he's the unchanging God I'm glad I
[1:34:16] got my faith in him tonight that someday
[1:34:19] when my body my life my body with his 16
[1:34:22] elements will be back in the dust of the
[1:34:25] earth he will say William Branham and
[1:34:28] I'll come forth
[1:34:30] and uh and he will breathe the breath of
[1:34:32] life into it and say there you are and
[1:34:35] you'll bypass the birth of my mother and
[1:34:37] so forth like Jesus on his first miracle
[1:34:40] he turned water into wine eventually it
[1:34:44] would have been wine but he bypassed all
[1:34:46] that procedure and he said turn water
[1:34:49] into wine and at the resurrection he
[1:34:52] will not say Mr Mrs Branham get married
[1:34:55] again and bring forth William he will
[1:34:58] speak and I'll come forward that's him
[1:35:00] that he's God that will come for the
[1:35:02] time he says again word that will be no
[1:35:06] more sex but God will call his children
[1:35:08] from the dust of the earth back like
[1:35:11] there was in the original not to any
[1:35:13] woman but to the molding of the clay and
[1:35:15] the cosmic lights and the petroleum he
[1:35:18] will create again like he did Adam at
[1:35:21] the first time
[1:35:23] the last miracle
[1:35:25] will be like that
[1:35:28] he did it took water turned to the wine
[1:35:32] God will do the same thing he will
[1:35:34] bypass the natural birth process
[1:35:37] and give you a brand new body
[1:35:42] we're right here
[1:35:44] at the last miracle
[1:35:47] brother Timothy was preaching Wednesday
[1:35:49] night
[1:35:51] about along these same lines I felt like
[1:35:54] it made a good platform and I want to
[1:35:56] say thank you brother Timothy brother
[1:35:57] Timothy was sick
[1:35:59] and he preached when he wasn't feeling
[1:36:01] good
[1:36:02] and I want to thank him for laboring for
[1:36:04] the Lord
[1:36:05] but you know and he mentioned there
[1:36:08] about uh the prophet Elisha how he got
[1:36:11] all out of sorts
[1:36:13] seeing the son of ahabit come to him
[1:36:15] along with Jehoshaphat now Jehoshaphat
[1:36:17] was of the of the one of the kings of
[1:36:20] Judah and the son of Ahab he was just a
[1:36:23] scoundrel like his daddy was he was a
[1:36:25] descendant of Jezebel
[1:36:28] and it was uh you know he had lived a a
[1:36:31] a a a a horrible life and had followed
[1:36:34] the gods of Baal and other gods and and
[1:36:37] when he come when he come to their
[1:36:41] remember
[1:36:42] um they they went to seek the Lord
[1:36:45] because they had a formidable host out
[1:36:48] there and they didn't know what to do
[1:36:49] and Jehoshaphat said let's consult the
[1:36:52] prophet
[1:36:53] now I think that's what real true
[1:36:56] sincere men and Dog Sons and Daughters
[1:36:58] of God do they want to consult the word
[1:37:01] what did the word say about this
[1:37:03] so he goes to the prophet and of course
[1:37:06] the prophet looks out and he sees that
[1:37:08] scallywag that son of Ahab there and it
[1:37:11] makes him mad because he come to his
[1:37:13] church service
[1:37:16] I know Rascal like him coming here you
[1:37:18] know he served other gods he's went and
[1:37:21] chased this and all kinds of false
[1:37:23] doctrines and things and now he's going
[1:37:25] to show up my meeting when he needs help
[1:37:27] here he comes
[1:37:28] and it got the prophet out of sorts
[1:37:32] you can do that
[1:37:37] in case you didn't know
[1:37:40] still happens
[1:37:43] but anyway you know remember the story
[1:37:45] and brother Branham tells us so well and
[1:37:47] making the valley full of ditches
[1:37:49] this was in Shreveport 1956 I happen to
[1:37:53] be in this in this series of meetings
[1:37:55] there's a boy about almost two years old
[1:37:57] in the fairgrounds in Shreveport my
[1:38:00] family attended there
[1:38:01] and brother branham's talking about here
[1:38:04] of what you have to do to prepare
[1:38:07] for prepare for the promise to be
[1:38:10] fulfilled
[1:38:11] I mean he said and they went and got all
[1:38:14] the music and they first got to play in
[1:38:16] the music some real good hymn and the
[1:38:18] first thing you know when the songs
[1:38:20] returned to Zion when the music and the
[1:38:23] children began to sing from the heart
[1:38:24] something takes place a spirit of the
[1:38:27] Lord come on the prophet
[1:38:30] and if a real old-fashioned Godly
[1:38:32] singing repenting would bring the spirit
[1:38:35] of God on the prophet Dam it would do
[1:38:37] the same today and notice he wanted to
[1:38:40] see the way out and the only way they
[1:38:41] could do it would be a Revival and he
[1:38:44] had some repentant Sinners that had come
[1:38:46] in the music played and the prophet saw
[1:38:48] Vision now let me let me pause for a
[1:38:50] minute
[1:38:51] because he said well that's it brother
[1:38:53] Tim we we need
[1:38:55] old-fashioned songs for what you don't
[1:38:57] realize I you know I am a student
[1:39:00] I do know what I'm talking about
[1:39:03] what you don't realize is that most of
[1:39:05] brother branham's old-fashioned songs
[1:39:07] were written in his generation
[1:39:10] they were contemporary for the time
[1:39:13] they were even sang by like you know
[1:39:15] worldly men like Roy Acuff and and uh
[1:39:18] you know Dad well I can I can name a lot
[1:39:21] of different ones and brother Brandon
[1:39:23] would use those songs and sing those
[1:39:25] songs and speak of those songs he would
[1:39:28] take a high on the chart pop song
[1:39:31] called on the wings of a dove
[1:39:33] and write a verse to it by the Holy
[1:39:35] Spirit
[1:39:36] so you see this was a solid these were
[1:39:39] songs that were written in his time this
[1:39:41] is what he's calling old-fashioned
[1:39:44] this is what he's called because it is
[1:39:46] old-fashioned you see the music We Sing
[1:39:50] is old-fashioned to the world
[1:39:53] it is
[1:39:55] it is old-fashioned to the world they
[1:39:57] you see they don't want that kind of the
[1:40:00] singing Because it brings the spirit of
[1:40:03] God down what's the Holy Spirit anoint
[1:40:06] those songs and anoint the people and
[1:40:09] see the atmosphere get charged
[1:40:11] to be able to receive the word
[1:40:14] now in making the valley full of dishes
[1:40:17] he's ditches he said the only way you're
[1:40:20] ever going to see your way out is an
[1:40:22] old-fashioned spiritual Revival where
[1:40:24] the hallelujahs of God is ringing from
[1:40:28] the bottom of your heart and an
[1:40:30] old-fashioned Holy Ghost said your
[1:40:32] Revival hits the place and then you
[1:40:35] begin to see things that God will bring
[1:40:37] to begin to reveal things and you wonder
[1:40:39] why these real Christians are hanging on
[1:40:42] while they're praying for you what a
[1:40:43] Revival and he got in the spirit and
[1:40:47] that's the reason that these people have
[1:40:48] dances they didn't have a dance so they
[1:40:50] could get in the spirit of dancing you
[1:40:52] can't have a ball game until you get in
[1:40:54] the spirit of the ball game you got to
[1:40:56] get in the spirit of it
[1:40:58] and never can we have a Revival in
[1:41:01] Shreveport or anyone else until the
[1:41:03] church gets in the spirit of Revival and
[1:41:06] then God can perform come and conform
[1:41:09] Miracles he can show signs and wonders
[1:41:12] he can stretch forth his hand to heal
[1:41:14] the sick and Afflicted the preacher can
[1:41:16] preach the gospel as hard as he can but
[1:41:19] there'll never be a Revival until the
[1:41:23] church gets in the spirit of Revival
[1:41:28] so our brother Tim that's a problem we
[1:41:31] don't believe in Revival yeah you don't
[1:41:33] but God does
[1:41:34] because this is an hour of restoration
[1:41:36] Revival
[1:41:39] amen this is the time where God is
[1:41:42] pouring out his Spirit upon All Flesh
[1:41:44] you want some spirits
[1:41:46] he says how they begin to move and it's
[1:41:49] the spirit of anything that does the
[1:41:51] work of it anyhow the people have to be
[1:41:53] in this kind of a spirit to bring the
[1:41:55] latter days
[1:41:56] the peoples and the spirit of the latter
[1:41:58] days the nations are in the spirit of
[1:42:00] the end time they got Atomic weapons and
[1:42:03] hydrogen weapons all kinds of things
[1:42:05] because it's in the spirit of the day
[1:42:07] the people are are in the spirit of the
[1:42:10] end time the church is moving together
[1:42:13] under the power and the impact of the
[1:42:16] Holy Spirit and the world is running out
[1:42:19] yonder and making fun and scoffing and
[1:42:21] laughing and they're living like the
[1:42:23] devil every day it's the spirit of the
[1:42:25] thing
[1:42:26] so brother Branham tells us it's the
[1:42:29] atmosphere has got to get right
[1:42:33] so no wonder we see Sodom all around us
[1:42:37] no wonder we see evil in the land no
[1:42:39] wonder there's all of this trouble
[1:42:41] that's everywhere
[1:42:42] is because people are actually getting
[1:42:46] in the spirit of the end time
[1:42:50] and if you took a glimpse down and Sodom
[1:42:52] you would see Satan become incarnate in
[1:42:56] people
[1:42:57] you wonder how the Hideous crimes are
[1:43:01] being done in the world today and the
[1:43:03] insanity that is on the world today it
[1:43:06] is because the mind of Satan is pressing
[1:43:08] down
[1:43:10] and you are seeing people getting so
[1:43:13] full of the devil that they will mock
[1:43:15] righteousness and abuse the angels
[1:43:19] as I said as I said last Sunday Sodom
[1:43:22] has increased from less than one percent
[1:43:24] of my generation identifying as
[1:43:27] homosexuals to nearly one out of four of
[1:43:29] those who are of Generation Z 18 to 25
[1:43:33] and the rest are okay with it it's your
[1:43:36] freedom
[1:43:37] to do so
[1:43:39] while I'm here let me correct something
[1:43:41] I said because brother EJ corrected me I
[1:43:44] said one of our school resources
[1:43:45] officers and Shreveport identifies as a
[1:43:48] fox now I got that wrong the fox
[1:43:50] actually signed up as an
[1:43:52] auxiliary deputy
[1:43:55] but nevertheless he's not a human he's a
[1:43:58] fox
[1:44:00] they're coming in to enforce the laws of
[1:44:03] the land
[1:44:04] to pretend that he's protecting us
[1:44:08] this is a Sodom world that we're living
[1:44:10] in
[1:44:12] insanity and let me just repeat again
[1:44:14] why it is it is because Satan there's
[1:44:18] actually right now we are in the process
[1:44:21] as we Ascend Satan is falling
[1:44:25] as he falls he's incarnated in people
[1:44:28] until he will become full King of the
[1:44:31] earth just wait until the bride leaves
[1:44:35] and I tell you you don't want to be here
[1:44:37] to find out what I'm saying is right
[1:44:39] because the evil that you see today is
[1:44:42] just the tip of the iceberg as to what's
[1:44:44] coming
[1:44:45] but brother Branham told us an anointed
[1:44:47] once at the end time he said first and
[1:44:50] he said there's three things that lays
[1:44:52] before us now and I believe these things
[1:44:54] are prophetic first the world is in his
[1:44:57] in the Sodom condition Jesus said it
[1:45:00] would happen look at the perversion are
[1:45:02] women trying to act like men are men
[1:45:04] trying to act like women sissified
[1:45:07] rotten filthy low-down devil possessed
[1:45:10] and don't know it
[1:45:14] amen
[1:45:16] and the Bible said it would happen and
[1:45:18] that's where it's at
[1:45:20] secondly it's an hour according to
[1:45:23] scripture that Janice and jamaries
[1:45:24] appears and that's number two and
[1:45:27] Jenison Damaris are impersonators of the
[1:45:30] genuine
[1:45:32] so therefore even in message ranks we
[1:45:35] have a whole generation of impersonators
[1:45:37] who are impersonating the Holy Ghost
[1:45:39] because it raised their hand in a
[1:45:42] meeting
[1:45:43] and said they believe on Christ or
[1:45:45] accept him as Savior and they're
[1:45:47] impersonating a real Holy Ghost life
[1:45:52] thirdly it's the same hour the son of
[1:45:54] man is to being revealed and I'd like to
[1:45:56] say where he's being revealed in his
[1:45:59] bride form
[1:46:01] now why is Sodom increasing because
[1:46:03] Satan is incarnating himself
[1:46:07] and we'll advance from the Antichrist to
[1:46:11] the full embodiment in the false prophet
[1:46:15] now in the second seal brother Branham
[1:46:18] said in the age after the church goes
[1:46:20] home he becomes a beast he becomes the
[1:46:24] devil incarnate the red dragon himself
[1:46:27] oh my can't you see it he is Incarnate
[1:46:30] in his people then he's got his people
[1:46:32] Bound by his power the false prophet has
[1:46:35] prophesied them right into them give
[1:46:38] them over to strong delusions to believe
[1:46:40] a lie and to be damned by it denying the
[1:46:43] word with a form of godliness
[1:46:46] now this of course is why you want to be
[1:46:49] careful who you're listening to
[1:46:52] because they can prophesy you right into
[1:46:55] the Incarnation of the devil
[1:46:58] amen and Satan has incarnated himself by
[1:47:02] education
[1:47:04] systematic instruction until the sea
[1:47:08] generation the young adults ages 18 to
[1:47:12] 25 one out of four have now now identify
[1:47:15] as homosexuals
[1:47:17] and we're hearing constantly it's become
[1:47:20] it's become quite regular a drag queen
[1:47:24] shows in our public schools for little
[1:47:26] kids
[1:47:27] and how much more delusional can the
[1:47:30] world get
[1:47:32] right here in this in the Commonwealth
[1:47:35] of Virginia there are State lawmaker is
[1:47:38] who are wanting to introduce a bill
[1:47:41] making it a crime for parents not to
[1:47:44] affirm their LGBT child
[1:47:47] and this meal will expand the state's
[1:47:49] definition of child abuse and neglect to
[1:47:52] include parents and the Guardians who
[1:47:54] will not affirm their LGBT children
[1:47:58] so there again they are they are
[1:48:01] fortunate remember the marking of the
[1:48:04] Beast will be forced in the end time
[1:48:08] brother Branham calls these side of the
[1:48:10] laws
[1:48:13] amen a school in San Diego is left
[1:48:16] reading and writing the arithmetic to
[1:48:18] host what is called a family friendly
[1:48:21] Halloween drag queen show
[1:48:25] and the event was sponsored by no less
[1:48:28] than a local San Francisco gender gender
[1:48:32] reassignment surgery center in
[1:48:34] collaboration with popular a popular gay
[1:48:37] nightclub
[1:48:38] these people have an agenda
[1:48:43] our Educational Systems are now filled
[1:48:46] with groomers and activist pimps
[1:48:51] Decades of parents of public school
[1:48:54] education have indoctrinated many of
[1:48:57] today's parents
[1:48:59] where they feel like this is okay
[1:49:03] the offices of the U.S government is
[1:49:05] filled with homosexuals and transgenders
[1:49:08] and the nation has ceased from freedom
[1:49:11] of religion
[1:49:13] promoting now freedom from religion
[1:49:18] and with the Incarnation of Satan comes
[1:49:21] the mind and the thinking of Satan and
[1:49:24] Satan is pressing down and forcing
[1:49:27] himself upon the world that we're living
[1:49:31] in fortunate by Sodom laws
[1:49:35] amen all in the name of freedom
[1:49:39] you see Satan has had 6 000 years of a
[1:49:43] perversion which now has climaxed into a
[1:49:48] time of Satan's Eden
[1:49:50] Satan's Eden has been created by
[1:49:53] bringing all the times of perversion uh
[1:49:57] the keeping up of all the sins of the
[1:49:59] past all the days from the days of Noah
[1:50:03] all the way down
[1:50:05] um where the man's mind was on evil
[1:50:07] continually until the days of Sodom were
[1:50:12] it was the ultimate a perversion
[1:50:15] localized in a couple of cities of Sodom
[1:50:18] and Gomorrah
[1:50:19] and now the now it is now climaxed into
[1:50:25] a Sodom world it's no longer a local
[1:50:29] place
[1:50:30] whether you can just be out in the
[1:50:33] desert like Abraham was and be far
[1:50:35] removed from it but it's right there in
[1:50:38] your neighborhood in your workplace in
[1:50:40] your schools it's there in the colleges
[1:50:43] it's everywhere and Satan's got an
[1:50:45] agenda
[1:50:47] and that is to take over your thinking
[1:50:50] and to produce an attitude or an
[1:50:53] atmosphere of unbelief in your life
[1:50:56] you see a word that it becomes a
[1:50:59] conglomerate of sin and evil keeping up
[1:51:03] all the sins of all generations it's now
[1:51:07] keeping up every demon power now
[1:51:10] congregate in itself in this last day as
[1:51:15] Darkness makes its final stand
[1:51:23] first Peter 5 and 8 says
[1:51:26] for us to be sober
[1:51:28] that means to be serious
[1:51:31] to be vigilant to be on guard
[1:51:34] because your adversary the devil as a
[1:51:37] roaring lion an impersonator
[1:51:39] he's not a roaring lion
[1:51:43] the King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[1:51:45] the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:51:47] but he goes as a roaring lion you know
[1:51:50] very religiously walking about seeking
[1:51:53] whom he may devour
[1:51:55] and then he says whom
[1:51:58] resists steadfast into faith I want you
[1:52:02] to notice you are to be resistors
[1:52:06] constantly pushing out the mind and the
[1:52:09] thinking of Satan and his predominant
[1:52:12] views that he wants to press upon this
[1:52:15] world
[1:52:16] you see
[1:52:17] listen I've seen it even among our young
[1:52:21] people I've seen I message youth get up
[1:52:25] and defend defend the the black matters
[1:52:29] movement defend which is a homosexual
[1:52:33] agenda by the way defend a homosexual
[1:52:36] lifestyle defend abortion on demand
[1:52:40] young people who's supposed to believe
[1:52:42] the message raised in the message church
[1:52:45] but their minds have been taken over
[1:52:50] and we've got to guard against it
[1:52:53] and resist it
[1:52:55] amen now listen where brother Brandon
[1:52:58] placed the scripture he said he said
[1:53:00] that here in the beginning ending of the
[1:53:03] Gentiles dispensation he said the Bible
[1:53:05] said in the last day that Satan would go
[1:53:07] about like a roared line he's gathered
[1:53:10] together all of his enemies all his
[1:53:13] friends our enemies and congregating
[1:53:15] them together keeping under one big head
[1:53:18] the mark of the beast
[1:53:21] in the ecclesiastical Realms that kind
[1:53:24] of federates our churches all the year
[1:53:26] 19 and making themselves a great
[1:53:28] organization the same as Catholicism and
[1:53:31] the world Empires are uniting themselves
[1:53:33] together forming up a big head
[1:53:36] um there in the political Realms called
[1:53:38] communism and the life of God is
[1:53:42] pressing on
[1:53:43] now I want you to get this because he
[1:53:46] said they're congregating like a roaring
[1:53:50] line
[1:53:51] and people are actually being pushed
[1:53:56] into this very trap
[1:53:59] of Satan
[1:54:02] where that they are receiving the mind
[1:54:04] and the thinking of the Beast
[1:54:08] are you with me
[1:54:09] but the same time the life of God is
[1:54:13] pressing on
[1:54:16] so when you're we're preaching here
[1:54:18] about Sarah and God appearing at the
[1:54:22] same time Satan is there in a
[1:54:25] civilization
[1:54:27] and he's bringing about an agenda there
[1:54:31] against righteousness against Holiness
[1:54:34] and again it's not one city it's the
[1:54:38] whole world
[1:54:41] now the pressures of the age become so
[1:54:44] hard
[1:54:45] against a Believer to keep you from the
[1:54:48] revealing of the hour
[1:54:50] brother Branham said himself he said
[1:54:52] well you know why do you hunger Church
[1:54:53] why do you thirst it's a father trying
[1:54:55] to reveal this great mystery to you but
[1:54:58] you keep letting so many other things
[1:55:00] keep you from it
[1:55:01] amen and then he goes on and starts
[1:55:04] naming some of the things that keep
[1:55:06] people from it but Satan's doing
[1:55:07] everything he can to keep the bride out
[1:55:11] of the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:15] amen but the life of God is pressing
[1:55:19] against that
[1:55:22] because there has to be a people whose
[1:55:26] hearts are changed whose mind is set on
[1:55:30] God who believed the word whose seeds at
[1:55:33] work
[1:55:35] I know that there's something happening
[1:55:38] in them
[1:55:41] it may be invisible yet
[1:55:44] but it's happening
[1:55:47] now the pressures of this age
[1:55:51] presses so hard against the Believers
[1:55:54] to keep you from the revealing of the
[1:55:56] hours to drive the spirit of Christ from
[1:55:58] you and he does it in the Unseen realm
[1:56:00] and he uses tools of the scene realm to
[1:56:03] keep you out of the presence of the
[1:56:05] angel
[1:56:06] he comes with his evil AIDS
[1:56:09] but I want you to understand he has no
[1:56:12] part in US
[1:56:14] John Chapter 14 verse 30 Hereafter I
[1:56:17] will not talk much with you for the
[1:56:19] prince of this world cometh
[1:56:22] and he had nothing in me
[1:56:26] how many could say that today
[1:56:28] the prince of the world is come
[1:56:31] he's here we're creating a Sodom with
[1:56:35] all his evil but he doesn't have a part
[1:56:38] in my life
[1:56:39] I'm not a part of that
[1:56:42] he I ain't giving him my mind I ain't
[1:56:44] giving him my heart I'm not giving him
[1:56:46] my faith come on Amen I am standing
[1:56:49] there on the promise of God he comes
[1:56:51] with his music but there's nothing in me
[1:56:53] to feed on that he comes with his money
[1:56:56] his women his popularity but he have
[1:56:58] found no place in me I cannot be bought
[1:57:04] I cannot be compromised
[1:57:06] amen I cannot be lured away
[1:57:09] amen but there is nothing in me I'm
[1:57:13] saying take this whole world
[1:57:15] but just give me Jesus
[1:57:19] Hallelujah
[1:57:21] now Jesus said in Luke chapter 22 verse
[1:57:24] 53 when I was dated with you in the
[1:57:27] temple you stretch Fortune no hand
[1:57:29] against me but this is your hour
[1:57:34] and the power of Darkness
[1:57:37] now I want to point out something
[1:57:38] because this is prophetical
[1:57:41] because as the bride leaves from here
[1:57:44] and the crucifixion of the word has
[1:57:47] taken place
[1:57:49] it becomes his hour
[1:57:52] and the hour of the power of Darkness
[1:57:57] this is our word Darkness Reigns
[1:58:02] and Jesus said when I was daily with you
[1:58:05] in your temple
[1:58:06] you stressing up with no hand against me
[1:58:10] but now this is your hour and the power
[1:58:13] of Darkness
[1:58:15] so there comes again Satan's hour and
[1:58:19] his power of Darkness as he comes now to
[1:58:22] Incarnate himself in a people in this
[1:58:25] end time
[1:58:26] now we are in a spiritual squeeze
[1:58:31] a persecution a press upon the mind of
[1:58:35] man that is designed to keep you from
[1:58:37] giving preeminence to the word of God
[1:58:40] this was Sarah she was so pressed upon
[1:58:43] she was so she was so embittered the
[1:58:47] days the toil the long the length of
[1:58:50] time had at War upon her and hear all of
[1:58:54] the pressures there had come upon her
[1:58:57] and she was not given preeminence to the
[1:59:00] word
[1:59:01] she was not given preeminence to the
[1:59:04] word to the to God that was right there
[1:59:07] in the inner midst that was calling her
[1:59:09] name that was identifying her in a
[1:59:11] promise and even with the identification
[1:59:14] she's still unbelieving
[1:59:17] no I want you to know we are in a
[1:59:21] spiritual squeeze
[1:59:22] a persecution a press
[1:59:26] a press upon the minds of men
[1:59:29] that is designed to keep you from giving
[1:59:33] the word of God its proper place in your
[1:59:36] life
[1:59:37] now letting off the pressure brother
[1:59:39] Branham talks about how that this has
[1:59:42] become a neurotic age
[1:59:44] and everybody's built up hadn't got any
[1:59:46] time that builds up a place to or that
[1:59:49] it breaks up things it causes people to
[1:59:51] have a hard feelings as they snap off
[1:59:53] and say things you didn't mean to say he
[1:59:56] said everybody's guilty of it I'm guilty
[1:59:58] you're all guilty
[2:00:00] so the pressures of this age can
[2:00:02] actually cause us to do things
[2:00:06] that are wrong
[2:00:10] that are really the result of the
[2:00:13] pressure on us
[2:00:14] rather than the result of God on us
[2:00:18] this is Sarah
[2:00:21] now so you see there's an excess
[2:00:23] pressure he said build up today you're
[2:00:26] under excess pressure
[2:00:29] every age has had its burdens
[2:00:32] every ages had its problems
[2:00:35] but this is a proud day where all is
[2:00:37] sinned heats up against this generation
[2:00:42] you are not just facing a few things
[2:00:45] you're facing all the tactics of the
[2:00:47] enemy that he has learned for six
[2:00:50] thousand years
[2:00:52] and he's coming directly against you
[2:00:56] press it on you
[2:00:59] trying to keep you from believing
[2:01:02] and brother Brandon said I believe it's
[2:01:04] the enemy coming down and pressing it's
[2:01:06] the devil
[2:01:07] and we know the coming of the Lord is at
[2:01:09] hand the Bible said that the devil go
[2:01:11] about like a roaring lion and if he
[2:01:13] could get you under pressure hurrying
[2:01:15] running over something you'll make
[2:01:17] decisions that you wouldn't do if you'd
[2:01:19] sit down and thinking over
[2:01:22] so it's not so much a physical press or
[2:01:25] squeeze
[2:01:27] that won't come until Satan becomes full
[2:01:30] of King of the earth and then there'll
[2:01:32] become a persecution
[2:01:34] but right now the great burden of the
[2:01:38] last age is a pressure of riches
[2:01:42] self-living nervous tensions in the
[2:01:44] complex age that we seem unfit to live
[2:01:47] in
[2:01:48] so why is this press this is what I want
[2:01:51] to ask you then why why is all of this
[2:01:55] Satan coming down into this age why is
[2:01:59] it all of this heaping up and congealing
[2:02:02] together and mixing together and coming
[2:02:05] together why is this press because it is
[2:02:08] the dawning of a new day
[2:02:12] come on
[2:02:13] Sarah when you thought it couldn't get
[2:02:16] any worse
[2:02:17] it did
[2:02:19] when your condition progressed to where
[2:02:22] it was impossible it did
[2:02:25] when it got so dark you can't believe
[2:02:29] anymore it's dead you thought oh you
[2:02:33] know I I wrestled with this in ages
[2:02:35] Pastor days past but it gets worse
[2:02:41] unbelief is coming in harder than ever
[2:02:45] but why is this press
[2:02:47] it is because it is the dawning of a new
[2:02:50] day and light is pressing against the
[2:02:54] darkness
[2:02:58] this is why it's congealing and coming
[2:03:01] together and getting darker and darker
[2:03:02] and darker because there is light that
[2:03:06] has come to an end-time people
[2:03:10] Hallelujah who are not of this present
[2:03:13] world who are not of this present
[2:03:15] Darkness
[2:03:17] but they are light in the Lord somebody
[2:03:19] help me preach amen they are looking
[2:03:22] upon the face of the mighty angel with
[2:03:25] the full countenance of the Sun in whom
[2:03:28] there is no Darkness or Shadow attorney
[2:03:33] with every type
[2:03:36] every Veil being taken away to see him
[2:03:40] in his fullness
[2:03:43] and it presses the darkness
[2:03:48] now in Abraham's day Satan has been
[2:03:51] pushed
[2:03:52] and darkness had congealed and pressed
[2:03:54] in a place called Sodom
[2:03:56] today it's a Sodom world
[2:03:59] but I want you to know the light is
[2:04:02] coming on
[2:04:04] you can't put it back
[2:04:09] when the Sun rises
[2:04:12] and it begins and on the darkness is
[2:04:15] there you know and it starts coming
[2:04:17] forward with light and Progressive you
[2:04:20] can't rewind the clock
[2:04:24] you can't turn it back into darkness
[2:04:28] and when this light is coming this day
[2:04:30] and hour there is no way Satan in all
[2:04:33] his forces can put light back in a box
[2:04:37] Hallelujah this light is bringing a new
[2:04:40] day a dawning of a new day to believe us
[2:04:45] and Sarah this is not Satan's hour this
[2:04:50] is your hour
[2:04:52] this is not just the hour of Darkness
[2:04:55] but this is the hour of light and light
[2:04:58] is pressing the darkness
[2:05:07] brother Branham said
[2:05:09] and the great darkness is swinging over
[2:05:12] the earth now is nothing but to declare
[2:05:15] the light is pressing its way down
[2:05:20] Hallelujah I don't know about you but
[2:05:22] there's already been a prophet in this
[2:05:25] day that ran up to the height of the
[2:05:27] mountain
[2:05:29] and saw the rise into the sun
[2:05:33] amen you you remember the story of the
[2:05:36] slave son when they were down in the
[2:05:38] valley
[2:05:39] and the light wouldn't shine down there
[2:05:42] but on a certain day at Sunrise they
[2:05:46] would be free
[2:05:48] and so but down in the valley it
[2:05:50] wouldn't come till about 12 or 1 o'clock
[2:05:53] in the day where the sun got over the
[2:05:55] mountain so there was some young men
[2:05:57] that run up to the top of the mountain
[2:06:02] amen that when the sun came up
[2:06:05] amen they looked over there and said
[2:06:08] here it comes it's risen a man that they
[2:06:12] shouted down to the next one hey the Sun
[2:06:15] is up
[2:06:17] he is risen you're free
[2:06:20] you may not have seen the light yet but
[2:06:22] you're free anyhow the light is up
[2:06:26] I tell you there's a prophet came in
[2:06:28] this day when all the wages are top of
[2:06:31] the pyramid and he saw the light coming
[2:06:35] and he declared Salam
[2:06:38] peace it's the dawning of a new day and
[2:06:42] there ain't nothing the devil can do to
[2:06:44] stop it
[2:06:46] that light will press the doctors back
[2:06:49] to his place
[2:06:57] and he got up to the top of the mountain
[2:07:00] and said it is the rising of the Sun
[2:07:03] Hallelujah Shalom good morning church
[2:07:07] it's no longer a night the evening light
[2:07:11] has come
[2:07:12] Hallelujah and the evening light it
[2:07:14] dispelling the darkness
[2:07:24] this great darkness is swinging of the
[2:07:27] earth now is nothing but declare the
[2:07:32] lightest person its way down
[2:07:35] when death is hanging so close that it
[2:07:38] could be in an hour
[2:07:40] one hour from the from now the world
[2:07:43] could meet its death you know that's
[2:07:45] true look what Russia is claiming
[2:07:48] look a lot of how Iran is racing look at
[2:07:52] all the listen they said we're closer to
[2:07:54] nuclear destruction than we have been
[2:07:57] and now now since the other Roman
[2:08:00] Catholic President was in
[2:08:02] we're closer now to Doomsday than we've
[2:08:05] ever been
[2:08:07] amen and he said death is hanging so
[2:08:09] close it could be within an hour
[2:08:12] one hour from now the world could meet
[2:08:14] its death if death is hanging that close
[2:08:18] what is it doing it's life life is
[2:08:22] coming
[2:08:24] Hallelujah it ain't all bad news
[2:08:27] the good news is the sun shining
[2:08:31] good the good news is it is the rising
[2:08:35] of the sun amen the good news is a man

[2:08:47] Hallelujah little Bride come on Sarah

[2:09:06] victor

[2:09:23] age to cast Satan down the prince of the
[2:09:26] world has come he offered me everything
[2:09:29] but he had no part in me
[2:09:33] there's a people on Earth today that can
[2:09:36] say he offered us everything but nothing
[2:09:39] he offered we walked
[2:09:41] we want Jesus let him stay let his
[2:09:45] presence abide let me get more of him
[2:09:49] [Applause]
[2:09:56] he said what is this
[2:09:58] death coming so close the Resurrection
[2:10:02] the Easter

[2:10:38] as we have shared with him and his
[2:10:41] suffering he that suffers with me shall
[2:10:44] reign with me
[2:10:46] we're in the time dimensions are
[2:10:48] blending
[2:10:49] Angels coming down into this dimension
[2:10:53] seven angels in the cloud declaring
[2:10:56] declaring that the seven thunders of
[2:10:59] Revelation 10 are now revealed the voice
[2:11:02] of God speaking out the Seven Seals
[2:11:05] being made known that's the hour we're
[2:11:07] in amen we're we're in the we're in the
[2:11:10] hour where that Angels come without a
[2:11:13] door open and walk right through the
[2:11:15] door where the pillar of fire is seen
[2:11:18] Among Us
[2:11:19] this is where we are the Holy Spirit
[2:11:21] moving down Angels coming in and
[2:11:25] darkness is taking its last toll
[2:11:28] for the light will soon be here Christ

[2:11:35] oh think of this even dimensions are
[2:11:37] blending
[2:11:40] hallelujah it's the ending of time and
[2:11:43] the blending of Eternity
[2:11:45] the dead in Christ are closer to this
[2:11:48] Dimension than they ever have been
[2:11:52] are you with me this is where we are in
[2:11:56] time where that they can almost be felt
[2:12:00] Hallelujah and soon they will be seen
[2:12:04] and when they are seen we'll be changed
[2:12:06] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[2:12:12] the winds have changed
[2:12:15] Angels coming down
[2:12:17] when I think about
[2:12:19] the Angels holding the whims of war and
[2:12:23] strife
[2:12:24] until the Servants of God are sealed in
[2:12:27] their forehead
[2:12:29] you realize before he concealed 144
[2:12:32] thousand he has to seal the last Gentile
[2:12:36] into the kingdom
[2:12:38] did somebody catch that
[2:12:41] I hope that didn't go over your head let
[2:12:43] me just say it again you see the angels
[2:12:46] are holding the Winds of War and strife
[2:12:49] the Bible said it they hold the Four
[2:12:51] Winds of the Earth
[2:12:53] winds represent war and strife
[2:12:57] and he's holding them back
[2:13:00] you see it would have destroyed it back
[2:13:03] when I was a little boy in the mission
[2:13:05] and the and the Cuban Missile Crisis
[2:13:10] amen it would have destroyed come on the
[2:13:13] window destroyed the Earth
[2:13:15] and when it is flooded all right you
[2:13:18] know are you with me for a moment
[2:13:20] what what year was that brother Timothy
[2:13:22] where brother Doug Baker talks about
[2:13:24] living in North Carolina and there are a
[2:13:28] nuclear weapon actually crashed into the
[2:13:31] ground right near the base
[2:13:34] and there are would have wiped out the
[2:13:37] whole East Coast
[2:13:40] but there were Angels there holding it
[2:13:42] back
[2:13:44] why didn't Christ come in 1963 some say
[2:13:47] he did well he didn't
[2:13:49] sure he revealed himself in the word but
[2:13:52] and there was a word coming to Christ
[2:13:53] but it wasn't his physical return
[2:13:56] are you with me amen but why did he come
[2:13:59] then when the book was opened and the
[2:14:01] Seven Seals revealed because there were
[2:14:03] more names written on the Lamb's Book of
[2:14:06] Life that had not been manifested on
[2:14:08] Earth
[2:14:09] [Applause]
[2:14:10] Hallelujah the message had to go out and
[2:14:12] catch some of you some of you were out
[2:14:15] in sin and worldliness and everything
[2:14:16] else wasn't ready for the coming of the
[2:14:19] Lord but God wasn't going to leave one
[2:14:21] of his behind
[2:14:25] so he's been holding back the limbs of
[2:14:28] strike and laws
[2:14:32] he's been holding it back
[2:14:37] until
[2:14:38] he steals
[2:14:40] the Servants of God in their forehead
[2:14:43] that's the Jews and they're all back to
[2:14:46] Israel now waiting there for their
[2:14:49] ceiling time but he had to seal the
[2:14:52] Gentile in first
[2:14:54] so he held it back not just for Jews but
[2:14:57] for you
[2:15:01] Hallelujah
[2:15:02] amen and when the last one comes in
[2:15:07] the Angels gonna let some things fly
[2:15:11] amen now
[2:15:14] so you said brother Brandon said there's
[2:15:16] darkness that is pressing in now watch
[2:15:20] you got to recognize darkness when it's
[2:15:22] coming in see there seems to be
[2:15:24] something wrong among men men don't seem
[2:15:27] to be have that masculine touch that he
[2:15:30] used to have
[2:15:31] women don't have that feminist touch she
[2:15:34] used to have
[2:15:35] you men today you take men today they
[2:15:38] don't seem to be Burly like they used to
[2:15:42] I I happen to see a clip there was a
[2:15:45] song that come on that I I liked and it
[2:15:48] came up and I happened to be on
[2:15:50] Facebook and saw this song come up that
[2:15:52] I wanted to hear it was a gospel song
[2:15:55] and I listened to that singing next
[2:15:57] thing come on
[2:15:58] and here's this guy
[2:16:01] and he comes on he looks like about
[2:16:04] coming 50 45 50. and he's complaining
[2:16:08] about adult bullying
[2:16:11] and he said I went into a hardware store
[2:16:13] and he said I had these shorts on and he
[2:16:16] points down he's got these little mini
[2:16:18] shorts on and they're all flowery and
[2:16:20] you know full of all the multicolors and
[2:16:23] whatever and so these men come in a
[2:16:26] truck and they got out and everyone
[2:16:28] looked like rough men and they had
[2:16:29] beards and and and whatever looked like
[2:16:32] you know Hillbillies and whatever and
[2:16:34] they began to Snicker at me
[2:16:36] you know and then he goes on this whole
[2:16:38] race you see like a woman would
[2:16:42] on Facebook
[2:16:44] about this bullying that's gone on in in
[2:16:47] America today you know when I can't even
[2:16:50] wear my shorts into without somebody
[2:16:53] making a crude remark
[2:16:56] you know you because you see they don't
[2:16:59] have men don't have that masculine touch
[2:17:02] anymore
[2:17:04] the first thing you know that God this
[2:17:06] little bracelet on and you know got a
[2:17:09] little necklace on and you know an ear
[2:17:12] ring or two or you know some some kind
[2:17:15] of effeminate ways
[2:17:18] Amen brother Brandon said men don't seem
[2:17:22] to be Burly like they used to and I want
[2:17:24] to just say something to you women you
[2:17:27] know I know you think it's cute for your
[2:17:29] little boy to be set up in his little in
[2:17:32] his little shorts and you know dressed
[2:17:34] up in his little ways and and and a
[2:17:37] little cute and you you did them that
[2:17:39] way when they were young but I'm telling
[2:17:41] you you need to treat your teacher young
[2:17:43] man how to be men
[2:17:46] not a feminate
[2:17:50] and I've seen mothers that actually
[2:17:52] pushed out on their kids and of course
[2:17:54] when they grow up the next day you know
[2:17:55] they're still wanting to wear those cute
[2:17:57] little shorts
[2:18:00] you see they want brother Bradley said
[2:18:02] they don't need they don't seem to be
[2:18:05] Burly like they used to be they want to
[2:18:07] wear suede shoes with purple they want
[2:18:10] to act like women and it seems more like
[2:18:13] a perversion a woman wants to cut off
[2:18:16] her hair act like a man man wants to act
[2:18:18] like a woman and yet you talk to them
[2:18:21] they're nice people to talk to nice
[2:18:23] people friendly sociable people what's
[2:18:25] caused this it is gross Darkness upon
[2:18:28] the people it is something that pressed
[2:18:31] them into it
[2:18:34] but I want you to know friends that
[2:18:36] ain't us
[2:18:38] your light has come
[2:18:41] and it's come from the Eternal Realms
[2:18:43] and
[2:18:44] Eternity is now shining into this
[2:18:47] Dimension the glory of the revealed word
[2:18:50] has risen and the pillar of fire has
[2:18:53] returned and is working Among Us healing
[2:18:56] Our Sick casting out Devils filling Sons
[2:18:59] and Daughters of God with the spirit
[2:19:02] light and darkness is here all at the
[2:19:05] same time light pressing the darkness
[2:19:08] forcing or gathered together the fortune
[2:19:12] of religion and politics until they will
[2:19:15] actually Crown Satan as king
[2:19:19] now brother Branham says the difference
[2:19:22] is just like it was at the beginning
[2:19:24] when there was gross Darkness upon the
[2:19:26] Earth and the spirit of God moved upon
[2:19:29] the waters said let there be light
[2:19:31] and God separated the light from the
[2:19:33] darkness and I believe we're now living
[2:19:35] in that hour again where God is
[2:19:38] separating light from Darkness
[2:19:41] right there
[2:19:42] amen he'll come right down even even in
[2:19:45] the church and he'll separate light from
[2:19:47] Darkness make sure you don't join with
[2:19:50] Darkness
[2:19:51] and that's the reason why he said and
[2:19:54] God is pressing it to the other side of
[2:19:57] the world the light might be manifest
[2:19:59] then the then the church the reason I
[2:20:01] say shalom to them is because it's God's
[2:20:04] peace that's what I want to bring to you
[2:20:06] this morning for the new year not
[2:20:08] looking back but we're looking forward
[2:20:11] to the breaking of a new day until
[2:20:14] there's something great laying ahead of
[2:20:16] us where the years has been the joy
[2:20:19] we've looked forward to depressing
[2:20:21] coming of the great light and now we see
[2:20:24] it breaking between Mortal and
[2:20:26] immortality we see it breaking between
[2:20:28] heavens and earth from an Earthbound
[2:20:31] sickness and a troubled world to bright
[2:20:33] and sunny day of an immortal life an
[2:20:36] immortal body and a mortal Earth that
[2:20:39] can never pass away it's shalom to the
[2:20:42] church now it's light time coming from
[2:20:45] the believer but across Darkness upon
[2:20:47] the people
[2:20:49] so even as we see Satan incarnating
[2:20:53] himself
[2:20:54] even so God is now incarnating himself
[2:20:57] in a people
[2:20:59] moving from justification to
[2:21:01] sanctification unto the baptism of the
[2:21:03] Holy Ghost until the Incarnation of God
[2:21:06] into his people when God incarnates
[2:21:10] himself in his people the very life that
[2:21:13] was in Christ
[2:21:15] is in that person
[2:21:18] think of that
[2:21:19] Satan
[2:21:21] taking on flesh
[2:21:23] and at the same time God is taking on
[2:21:27] flesh I don't know about you
[2:21:30] but I don't want my flesh yielded to the
[2:21:32] devil
[2:21:33] I've seen the wreckage that brings
[2:21:36] I've seen the herd and the harms and the
[2:21:38] confusion and the trouble that brings I
[2:21:42] want to yield myself to God say Lord
[2:21:44] come and incarnate yourself in me come
[2:21:46] step down inside of me come live and
[2:21:49] dwell in me come move in my life come
[2:21:52] change me from bitterness to believing
[2:21:55] again
[2:21:57] from Faith from doubt unto faith
[2:22:00] you know God pouring out a spirit upon
[2:22:02] All Flesh now not in one flesh
[2:22:06] this is where the problem is men are now
[2:22:09] looking up for another one to rise
[2:22:12] you know they want to Crown the he'll be
[2:22:14] the Messiah he's going to be the one
[2:22:16] that leads the bride in and people won't
[2:22:19] accept him oh so he becomes in the
[2:22:21] rejected Christ that's nonsense you see
[2:22:24] again it's not it's not that anymore all
[2:22:29] one-man scriptures has been fulfilled
[2:22:31] it's a body Ministry it's a body move
[2:22:36] amen where God is coming in flesh in
[2:22:39] bright form God walking and talking and
[2:22:43] dwelling among his people
[2:22:45] this is what God's doing now and because
[2:22:48] of him the atmosphere is changing
[2:22:51] now what happens what are we trying to
[2:22:54] do what are we want in an evening like
[2:22:56] Tabernacle you see we've got to be a
[2:22:59] people of the right atmosphere
[2:23:02] because in the atmosphere Sarah was in
[2:23:05] she would never bring forth that
[2:23:06] promised son
[2:23:08] she was in the wrong atmosphere
[2:23:10] so in order for us to bring Jesus back
[2:23:13] to Earth the last one's got to come in
[2:23:15] so we got to have the right atmosphere
[2:23:18] in the church
[2:23:19] where that God can come and fill newborn
[2:23:22] babes in Christ with the holy spirit
[2:23:24] amen an atmosphere where there can be
[2:23:27] healing because if there is no Divine
[2:23:30] Healing there's no change in the body
[2:23:32] amen we've got to have every promise
[2:23:35] manifested in our lives not just part of
[2:23:38] them so you see we've got to create an
[2:23:41] atmosphere
[2:23:43] where the Holy Spirit can move
[2:23:49] we're newborns can be birthed into the
[2:23:52] kingdom
[2:23:54] where we can bring Isaacs
[2:23:56] the church has got to bring it forth
[2:24:00] now so you see
[2:24:02] it doesn't matter if it's a word written
[2:24:05] in the scripture and I'm closing on this
[2:24:08] words written in the scripture it's got
[2:24:10] to be quickened by the Holy Spirit no
[2:24:14] matter how much you read it
[2:24:16] even the message no matter how much and
[2:24:19] even even a vision no matter how much a
[2:24:21] vision has spoke the word it's got to be
[2:24:24] received in the atmosphere for that to
[2:24:26] take to cause a faith to come in you you
[2:24:30] can't just get the visions of well I
[2:24:31] believe well God's Gonna God's gonna do
[2:24:34] this for me you've got to do more than
[2:24:36] that you've got to open your heart to it
[2:24:38] you've got to come to the point that you
[2:24:40] no more scorning at the promise so well
[2:24:43] if you don't come in a certain time I
[2:24:46] don't even want it anymore no I want it
[2:24:48] it doesn't matter when it comes if God
[2:24:51] you gave a promise I want it if God said
[2:24:55] I can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:57] I want it if God said I can have Divine
[2:24:59] Healing I want it if God said the church
[2:25:02] can be on fire for God I want it I want
[2:25:06] the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[2:25:08] the atmosphere
[2:25:11] we're the word of God
[2:25:13] can be manifested God bless you will you
[2:25:16] stand together with
[2:25:20] you can have
[2:25:22] genuine seed you can even be genuine
[2:25:26] seed
[2:25:28] seed Gene of God
[2:25:31] wheat all the way
[2:25:35] I can hold in my hand grains of wheat
[2:25:39] and it's got life in it
[2:25:40] but you'll never know it until he gets
[2:25:43] in the right atmosphere
[2:25:45] you can have really seed of God
[2:25:49] oh yes names on The Book of Life for the
[2:25:52] Lambs from the foundation world but if
[2:25:54] there's no atmosphere for it
[2:25:57] thank you
[2:25:58] that see will lay dormant
[2:26:00] you can have scripture theology
[2:26:04] truth
[2:26:05] message
[2:26:08] and without the spirit on it
[2:26:11] it'll never make manifest
[2:26:14] you see
[2:26:16] Sarah knew all these things
[2:26:17] intellectually
[2:26:19] but our atmosphere had to be changed
[2:26:25] I'm saying to you today
[2:26:27] look at your atmosphere of your life
[2:26:32] your creator yourself
[2:26:35] you can create an atmosphere
[2:26:38] let the Holy Spirit
[2:26:40] do it work in you
[2:26:42] and produce a creation of attitude
[2:26:45] of receiving from God
[2:26:49] so there's a change in your life
[2:26:52] to your new creature in Christ
[2:26:55] that it changes your vocabulary
[2:26:58] this takes out that I can't
[2:27:00] to I can
[2:27:02] that Lord I don't care when it comes I
[2:27:05] just want it
[2:27:07] I'm not going to make any kind of deals
[2:27:09] I I ain't gonna make some requirements
[2:27:11] well if you don't come when I want it
[2:27:13] Lord
[2:27:14] it's coming
[2:27:16] prepare my heart oh God
[2:27:19] do something like you did for Sarah
[2:27:21] come down and call my name speak to me
[2:27:26] it means something when your name gets
[2:27:28] called sometimes
[2:27:30] the other day on Saturday
[2:27:33] I'll just tell you this
[2:27:35] I was suffering so bad with my feet they
[2:27:38] were burning so bad I was in tears I was
[2:27:41] back in the back rubbing them I couldn't
[2:27:43] come out in time because I couldn't
[2:27:45] stand I couldn't stand it even I had my
[2:27:48] shoes on I had my socks off
[2:27:50] brother Ron was back there with me he
[2:27:53] was going to preach
[2:27:55] I put my shoes and socks back on and
[2:27:58] came back out here and sat down
[2:28:01] and at the end of the service I said
[2:28:03] Lord
[2:28:05] about my way
[2:28:07] it would just means something to me you
[2:28:09] just called my name
[2:28:11] you speak to me Lord It's a spark of
[2:28:13] faith in my life
[2:28:15] and no more and I got that prayer out
[2:28:19] he began to pray for me and my feet
[2:28:23] it didn't all go away for one moment
[2:28:25] but every day it got a little less
[2:28:28] until in two weeks I haven't had that
[2:28:30] burning anymore

[2:46:34] [Music]

[2:47:03] [Music]
[2:47:05] big bags
[2:47:13] Jesus
[2:47:24] [Music]
[2:47:33] I won't turn back
[2:47:37] don't turn it back
[2:47:40] it's the Lord
[2:47:43] this is wonderful to see one of our
[2:47:45] young people there surrendering their
[2:47:47] heart to the Lord and so I'd say young
[2:47:50] age brother Tim well
[2:47:52] when I first gave my heart to the Lord I
[2:47:54] was five
[2:47:55] so I guess God can do that don't you
[2:47:58] I believe the Lord can save our young
[2:48:00] people and before they go out and live
[2:48:02] an awful life of sin
[2:48:05] you know there's always all kinds of
[2:48:07] testimonies there's many testimonies
[2:48:10] I was a sinner I was in drugs and
[2:48:13] alcohol prostitution all that all the
[2:48:16] things that we don't want our children
[2:48:17] to have to go through
[2:48:19] you know and that can be a testimony in
[2:48:22] a great testimony but I think
[2:48:24] as great a testimony as the Lord kept me
[2:48:28] Raise Me Up in a Christian family and
[2:48:30] taught me the right way and when I was a
[2:48:33] young age I gave my heart to the Lord
[2:48:36] and I think that can be your testimony
[2:48:38] too I think that's just powerful a
[2:48:40] testimony as those that says well I was
[2:48:44] the Hell's Angels or I was drunkard I
[2:48:48] was dope or I was you know this horrible
[2:48:51] sin and but yet God Saves us no matter
[2:48:54] who we are
[2:48:56] and all of us needed a savior because
[2:49:01] we were born wrong to begin with that's
[2:49:03] why we have to be born again
[2:49:05] so God did that for for us to provide a
[2:49:10] second birth because our first birth
[2:49:12] was wrong and we were birthed into sin
[2:49:15] so Jesus taught us you must be born
[2:49:18] again
[2:49:19] so we bring Ellie here to the Lord today
[2:49:22] and you know if you slide this way just
[2:49:26] a little bit sweetheart
[2:49:27] and Ellie has gave her heart to the Lord
[2:49:30] and you know in the meetings he was so
[2:49:33] blessed and God just did a miraculous
[2:49:36] work in her life
[2:49:37] and I believe that he'll continue that
[2:49:39] because I believe that he that begun the
[2:49:42] good work in you will perform it to the
[2:49:44] day of Christ
[2:49:45] so you know whatever steps you make with
[2:49:48] the Lord God will take you even further
[2:49:51] you may have made certain steps with the
[2:49:54] Lord and but you know
[2:49:56] I believe he'll finish it and if he
[2:49:59] hadn't finished it in you I believe he
[2:50:01] will and so just keep pressing toward
[2:50:04] him with all your heart
[2:50:05] now Sister Ellie the Lord Jesus sent
[2:50:08] another Tim to the world called him at a
[2:50:11] young age
[2:50:13] and you know when I was about your age I
[2:50:16] already knew I was called to preach
[2:50:18] already making plans to minister the
[2:50:21] gospel of Christ
[2:50:24] at 11 years old you're about 11 aren't
[2:50:27] you
[2:50:28] at your age I asked
[2:50:31] my mother and dad for a Bible with my
[2:50:34] name on it
[2:50:35] and the new suit
[2:50:38] at 11 years old for my 11th birthday
[2:50:40] because I believe that God was calling
[2:50:43] me to the ministry
[2:50:45] I wouldn't preach till I was 15.
[2:50:48] but yet even then I knew the Lord had
[2:50:51] put something on my heart and God can
[2:50:54] deal with you and work with you as a
[2:50:56] young person
[2:50:57] and he has
[2:50:58] and it's for this reason you're in the
[2:51:00] water today
[2:51:02] so he sent me here in this end time to
[2:51:06] preach the gospel
[2:51:07] and he commanded me in his word that
[2:51:12] those who believed and followed him
[2:51:15] that I was to baptize them that believed
[2:51:19] in the name of the father and of the son
[2:51:21] and of the Holy Ghost
[2:51:23] so in obedience to that Divine command
[2:51:27] that God made and gave me in the Bible
[2:51:30] I baptized you my beloved sister in the
[2:51:33] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:51:36] thank you Lord praise the Lord
[2:51:39] Amen in God good for us
[2:51:53] and that's why we praise him that's why
[2:51:57] we sing
[2:51:59] that's why we
