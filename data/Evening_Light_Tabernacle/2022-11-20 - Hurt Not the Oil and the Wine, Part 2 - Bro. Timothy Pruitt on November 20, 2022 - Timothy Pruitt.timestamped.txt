[32:22] we're so thankful Lord that you have
[32:24] looked beyond our our faults our
[32:28] Humanity our weaknesses Lord and you see
[32:31] our need today Lord
[32:33] you sing the needs that was listed
[32:35] behind represented by ever lifted hand
[32:38] we ask Lord that you would come and you
[32:40] would move and you would take control
[32:42] you see the need in my own body Lord we
[32:45] just give it to you today Lord
[32:48] Lord just take this service what you
[32:50] want to do with it have thy own way we
[32:52] pray
[32:53] we give it to you in Jesus name amen
[32:58] let's turn to Revelations chapter 6.
[33:03] amen
[33:06] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[33:08] amen had a wonderful time yesterday of
[33:10] fellowship and I just want to thank
[33:13] everyone that was involved every person
[33:15] no matter how little or how much you
[33:17] brought and put your shoulder to the
[33:19] wheel to we want to say we appreciate
[33:22] that amen I know our young people and
[33:25] our children really appreciated that
[33:27] time just of enjoyment and to have a
[33:30] little fun and that's what it's all
[33:32] about amen God bless you today
[33:34] Revelations chapter 6 and verse 5 and
[33:37] says when he had opened up the third
[33:39] seal he heard the third Beast say come
[33:42] and see
[33:43] and beheld and low a black horse and he
[33:46] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[33:49] in his hand
[33:51] and he heard a voice in the midst of the
[33:53] four B saying a measure of wheat for a
[33:56] penny three measures of barley for a
[33:58] penny and see thou hurt not the oil and
[34:02] the wine
[34:03] amen we let you be seated today
[34:07] spoke on this
[34:09] few Services ago and actually was going
[34:12] to continue this this last Wednesday
[34:14] Lord wanted had had solved that we was
[34:18] to speak something else but today I want
[34:20] to pick up on this again on hurt not the
[34:22] oil and the wine
[34:24] amen and I it must be very important
[34:26] because it was the lamb who spoke it it
[34:30] was a voice that was in the midst of the
[34:32] four beasts it wasn't even one of the
[34:34] anointings that spoke it but a voice in
[34:36] the midst and I believe that voice is
[34:39] still in our midst today and he's still
[34:41] moving and he's still touching and he's
[34:44] still speaking in that voice amen still
[34:47] speaks with power and authority amen and
[34:50] so we we look at this brother Branham
[34:52] took this question in the in the
[34:54] question and answers on the seals and he
[34:56] says what does see thou hurt not the oil
[34:58] and the wine mean in Revelation 6 and
[35:02] verse 6. he said it's the Holy Spirit
[35:04] see we just got through that probably
[35:06] somebody came in a little late for the
[35:09] message he said but what does the oil
[35:11] and wine mean the oil as we look in it
[35:14] in symbols that all represents the Holy
[35:17] Spirit and the wine and oil is connected
[35:20] together in Bible in the Bible Always In
[35:23] Worship they're always connected the
[35:26] wine as we know amen he said well I get
[35:28] the idea of stimulation wine stimulates
[35:31] amen wine is the answer type of is
[35:34] natural from stimulation comes the
[35:36] Revelation or from the Revelation comes
[35:38] of stimulation he said what stimulates
[35:41] the church Revelations
[35:43] amen so wine the new wine amen the oil
[35:46] and the wine went together in sacrifice
[35:49] and went together in church worship and
[35:52] so if it went together then it still
[35:54] goes together now amen maybe you don't
[35:57] understand how these come together but
[35:59] maybe you came a little bit late to the
[36:01] message amen but God spoke it at these
[36:04] may he said he put it in his word hurt
[36:07] not the oh he didn't just say hurt not
[36:09] the oil or hurt not the wine he said
[36:11] hurt not the oil and the wine because it
[36:14] takes both it takes spirit and it takes
[36:16] truth amen you can't have one or the
[36:19] other or one by itself but you have must
[36:21] have both of them working together he
[36:24] said but see you you see a whole stream
[36:26] all the way through the Bible of oil and
[36:29] wine always meeting together in worship
[36:32] he said if you follow it through the
[36:35] Bible it's always meeting together he
[36:37] said you can look at it in in Ezekiel
[36:40] you can find it in the Old Testament you
[36:42] can find it in the New Testament he says
[36:44] why do we anoint the sick with oil we
[36:46] anoint the sick with oil because it
[36:48] symbolizes him is symbolizing the
[36:51] pouring out of the Holy Spirit
[36:54] amen so that so the reason why we put
[36:56] oil upon people's forehead is
[36:58] representing the holy spirit that the
[37:01] holy spirit will be placed between you
[37:03] and that disease that is against you
[37:06] amen so we know that that works we've
[37:08] seen it work amen
[37:10] because we know his spirit is more
[37:13] powerful than any disease any problem
[37:15] any situation and so if you place it
[37:18] there amen between you and that there is
[37:20] a protection not of your own strength or
[37:22] your own ability but a protection of the
[37:25] Holy Ghost
[37:27] and we also see that the wise virgins
[37:30] had oil and the wise and The unwise
[37:32] Virgins did not have no oil amen so it
[37:35] always comes together and so he said the
[37:38] wine is a revelation that reveals the
[37:41] interpretation of the word which
[37:42] stimulates the believer he said he said
[37:45] well I you never seen that before he
[37:47] said my glory he said I I didn't see it
[37:50] either until the god opened it to me he
[37:52] said stimulation of Revelation it's the
[37:55] oil and the wine and I got to looking at
[37:58] this word stimulate amen because as a
[38:01] whole lot of words that comes behind
[38:02] that I like to follow those Trails
[38:04] sometimes stimulate synonyms of
[38:06] stimulate it means to encourage to
[38:09] inspire to prompt to Quicken to spark to
[38:12] Spur to trigger to vitalize to activate
[38:15] to animate Amen to move
[38:19] I thought what does that word come move
[38:21] it means to move one to the point of
[38:24] being violent
[38:26] amen that's in the scripture Jesus said
[38:29] the days of John the Baptist until now
[38:31] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[38:33] and the violent taketh by force
[38:36] amen so the word the Revelation when you
[38:39] begin to reveal to you that it's for you
[38:41] and his promises of God are yours and
[38:44] it's not just for somebody else or Mom
[38:46] and Daddy amen it begins to cause
[38:48] something to rise up on the inside of
[38:50] you Amen to where you can grab the
[38:52] promise of God for yourself and
[38:55] sometimes you're gonna have to fight
[38:56] tooth hand and nail with everything you
[38:58] got amen but you're going to stand there
[39:00] upon the word of God and not let Satan
[39:03] back you off of it therefore it's going
[39:05] to come move you it's going to move you
[39:07] to the point of becoming angry and
[39:10] violent and enlightening not allowing
[39:12] that devil to ever one more time talk
[39:14] you out of the promises of God but

[42:34] lives and they begin to realize that Old

[43:45] defeat it's setting you up that you
[43:47] arise above it it's to set you up in
[43:50] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[43:55] amen the importance of Revelation by the
[43:58] spirit to a True Believer can never be
[44:01] over emphasized
[44:04] Revelation means more to you than
[44:06] perhaps you know or realize he said I'm
[44:09] not talking about just the Book of
[44:10] Revelation I'm talking about all
[44:12] revelation
[44:14] it is tremendously important to the
[44:16] church we remember in Matthew chapter 16
[44:19] where Jesus asked the disciples he said
[44:21] whom the men say that I the son of a son
[44:24] of man am he said some say that thou are
[44:26] John some say your lies some say you're
[44:28] Jeremiah's or one of the prophets he
[44:30] said but who do you say
[44:32] let me stimulate your faith for a minute
[44:35] who do you say that it is
[44:38] if this ain't nothing but a bunch of
[44:40] work up and some man's Kingdom and some
[44:42] man's idea amen it'll never do nothing
[44:45] for you but if you'll look beyond the
[44:47] fails of humanity that's exactly what
[44:50] they had to do that's what Peter had to
[44:52] do he had to look Beyond the Veil of
[44:54] humanity that was standing there before
[44:56] him and others were saying this some
[44:58] were not saying good things some were
[45:00] saying bad things some were calling him
[45:03] an illegitimate child some were saying
[45:05] he was you know he was born out of
[45:07] wedlock and all he was you know all
[45:09] these other ill-fame names they're
[45:11] trying to put on him but Peter looked
[45:13] beyond all of that
[45:16] and he said I believe Thou Art the
[45:19] Christ the son of the Living God
[45:24] and Jesus said blessed art thou Simon
[45:27] barjona for Flesh and Blood had not oh
[45:31] this wasn't passed down by intellectual
[45:34] reasoning
[45:35] and intellectual abilities and
[45:37] intellectual TED talks and teaching
[45:39] somebody
[45:41] well we got to have more teaching to get
[45:43] people established I agree Holy Ghost
[45:45] teaching
[45:47] not man's intellects not man's ideas but
[45:50] the spirit of God moving and touching it
[45:53] and changing hearts
[45:55] [Applause]
[45:58] but he said flesh and blood has not
[46:00] revealed this to thee but my Father
[46:02] which is in heaven
[46:05] and I say unto thee that thou art Peter
[46:07] and Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[46:09] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[46:12] against him
[46:13] so the Roman Catholics take that and
[46:15] they build the church on Peter
[46:18] a man again it's all Peter
[46:22] sounded like it's being repeated in our
[46:24] generation too
[46:25] amen it's all William Branham
[46:29] it's all just a man he said that's
[46:31] really carnal how could God build a
[46:34] church Upon A man so unstable that he
[46:37] denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while
[46:38] he's doing it God can't build his church
[46:41] upon any man any man any man born in sin
[46:47] he cannot build his church on any man
[46:50] born in sin it wasn't some rockly in
[46:53] there though God had howled the ground
[46:55] at that spot it isn't the Protestants
[46:57] say that the church is built upon Jesus
[46:59] it was built upon revelation
[47:03] flesh and blood is not revealed it but
[47:06] my father hath revealed it to you and
[47:09] Upon This Rock This Revelation I'll
[47:11] build my church
[47:13] what Revelation who Jesus was
[47:17] [Applause]
[47:23] how did Abel offer a better sacrifice
[47:26] than Cain did
[47:27] by revelation
[47:31] that's how your offering is going to be
[47:33] accepted is because of by Revelation it
[47:36] won't be because you got a certain head
[47:38] knowledge or certain abilities or are
[47:40] certain you're you you're going to out
[47:42] think or outsmart know anything about
[47:43] that or what you've done
[47:45] Cain brought all that he had done
[47:48] he brought his Altar and he built it up
[47:50] just pretty he had it all straightened
[47:52] out he didn't want nobody dancing around
[47:54] and nobody having a good time in the
[47:56] Lord nobody he wanted to show God his
[47:59] best
[48:01] and all of a sudden all of a sudden I
[48:03] can hear some noise as Abel decided it
[48:06] comes to that moment in his life to go
[48:08] off her sacrifice and he don't go and
[48:10] find something he'd done he goes find
[48:12] what God required
[48:14] and he finds a lamb out there and he
[48:16] puts a string around his neck he wasn't
[48:19] no good quiet nice little communion with
[48:22] God there was a lot of noise that took
[48:23] place there was a lot of blood that was
[48:26] shed it looked unhealthy it looked it
[48:28] looked like there wasn't it shouldn't be
[48:30] done it looked impossible amen that the
[48:33] God would accept this
[48:36] blood everywhere
[48:39] he said he got him a rock he laid that
[48:42] lamb upon that Altar and he began to
[48:44] hack at it
[48:46] let me tell you something that ain't no
[48:48] fun
[48:49] that is not no fun I did it
[48:52] not out of necessity not out not that I
[48:54] wanted to but it was out of necessity is
[48:57] actually right there in front of sister
[48:58] Angie's mom's house a deer run out of
[49:01] out in front of me was coming home late
[49:03] one night and it ran out in front of me
[49:04] and hit the side of that big old truck I
[49:06] used to have with that flatbed and it I
[49:08] knew I said man that deer is hurting or
[49:10] maybe dead I'll go back and see it's
[49:12] after midnight
[49:14] and uh I pull up turn around pull up
[49:16] there's deers in the in the middle of
[49:18] the road and and it ain't good shape his
[49:21] legs are broken but it's still trying to
[49:23] live and I thought man I go dig into my
[49:26] truck and I ain't got anything and I
[49:27] hear this voice
[49:29] out there at the house hey
[49:31] you hit a deer
[49:33] I said yeah I hit a deer you need a
[49:35] knife
[49:36] yeah I need a knife you got a knife sure
[49:39] went down there and Bobby brought me a
[49:40] knife it was a it was duller than a
[49:42] butter knife
[49:45] I didn't know that but I walked back out
[49:47] that deer and I started
[49:49] right there
[49:52] that ain't no fun
[49:55] and I'm like oh God help me you know I
[49:58] I'm like what am I gonna he said hey you
[50:01] need a sharper knife
[50:04] I said yeah that would be awesome he got
[50:07] one he said sure do I mean you've been
[50:09] good if you gave me that one the first
[50:10] time
[50:12] look it looked like a murder scene when
[50:14] it was over
[50:15] it wasn't fun Adam or Abel he he coming
[50:19] his blood was flying everywhere
[50:21] it was getting all over him
[50:23] [Applause]
[50:25] it didn't look like it was a good thing
[50:27] surely God would like what was pretty
[50:30] and God would like what was more thought
[50:31] out and placed just right no God wanted
[50:34] worship
[50:36] and Abel was worshiping by revelation
[50:39] [Applause]
[50:42] and it was getting all over him
[50:45] amen if your worship isn't getting all
[50:48] over you you're not worshiping by
[50:50] revelation
[50:53] you're worshiping by Creeds and dog
[50:55] missing intellectual ability God wants
[50:58] true worship
[51:00] you know
[51:05] amen
[51:07] Cain
[51:08] he couldn't offer the right sacrifice
[51:10] because it was a revelation from God
[51:11] that made the difference and it gave
[51:13] Abel eternal life
[51:16] and sound like it's worth worshiping by
[51:19] revelation
[51:21] if eternal life is on on the is what's
[51:24] available
[51:26] I'll do it amen
[51:28] he said you might take what the pastor
[51:30] says what the Seminary teaches though it
[51:32] might be taught with you with eloquence
[51:34] God reveals to you that Jesus is the
[51:38] Christ and that it is the blood that
[51:40] cleanses you and that God is your savior
[51:43] or you will never have eternal life it
[51:47] is spiritual Revelation that does it
[51:51] amen now I said that this book of
[51:54] Revelation is a revelation of Jesus and
[51:57] what he's doing in the churches for The
[52:00] Seven Ages
[52:01] it is a revelation because the disciples
[52:04] themselves didn't know these recorded
[52:05] truths it had been previously it had not
[52:08] been previously revealed to them you
[52:10] remember they came to Jesus in the book
[52:11] of Acts and said are you at this time
[52:13] going to restore the Kingdom of Israel
[52:15] he said it's not for you to know the
[52:17] time or the seasons
[52:20] but it's been given to you
[52:23] it wasn't given to them but it's been
[52:25] given to you
[52:28] Hallelujah the revelation of where we're
[52:30] at and who we are it has been given to
[52:34] us
[52:35] they didn't realize there was going to
[52:37] be seven more Church ages
[52:39] God allowed it to be that way because
[52:41] you know what would happen with men and
[52:43] women and if they realize well it's
[52:45] going to be 2 000 more years before
[52:47] Jesus returns
[52:49] there wouldn't have been no going out
[52:50] and preaching the gospel
[52:52] they wouldn't have been ready
[52:55] that had just been doing their own thing
[53:00] amen but for you it's been given
[53:04] the revelation of we are not in the
[53:06] first age or the second or third fourth
[53:08] fifth we are in the last stage
[53:11] therefore at the last stage we're not
[53:13] going back down to be planted we're
[53:15] coming up to be harvested
[53:18] amen so it's a revelation so he said see
[53:21] it was a spiritual Kingdom that he was
[53:22] going to build even he could not tell
[53:25] them about the pla about his place in it
[53:27] for the father had not revealed to them
[53:28] but now after his death and resurrection
[53:30] and at this particular time his
[53:32] meditorial ministry he is able to set
[53:35] forth here in the revelations of himself
[53:37] to John what is glory and his presence
[53:40] in the church would mean and do
[53:44] did you catch that
[53:47] what his glory in the church would mean
[53:50] and do
[53:54] so his glory has something for us
[53:57] so it shows you there's still a voice in
[53:59] the midst
[54:01] he's still in the midst of them amen in
[54:03] this Revelation he tells us what the end
[54:06] of the devil is
[54:10] man that ought to cause some stimulation
[54:12] right there
[54:13] when you begin to think about it that
[54:15] Satan has an end
[54:19] amen the sicknesses that are bothering
[54:21] you the problems that you've been facing
[54:23] the trials that you've been going
[54:25] through the devil that's been tormenting
[54:27] you he has an end
[54:29] [Applause]
[54:34] Hallelujah but turn it all the way
[54:36] around the other way when you begin to
[54:39] realize I don't have an end
[54:42] Glory good God Amen they're shouting to
[54:45] begins to take place there's something
[54:47] that begins to move up into another
[54:49] atmosphere when you begin to realize ma
[54:51] amen my I bet my where I'm going is not
[54:54] down it's not into hell it's not into
[54:57] problems and situations and drowning all
[54:59] of that but I'm gonna rise I'm gonna
[55:03] rise and I'm gonna rise until I leave
[55:06] this whole world
[55:10] Hallelujah
[55:15] have you ever noticed how Satan hates
[55:18] two books of the Bible more than any
[55:20] others
[55:22] it's the beginning and the end
[55:27] he's always attacking the Book of
[55:29] Genesis and the Book of Revelations
[55:33] so he also attacks the he of course he
[55:36] he worked very murderously through the
[55:39] Dark Ages but he's really coming against
[55:41] amen the first of the life and the last
[55:43] of the life
[55:46] to try to hinder it
[55:49] he thought the first church was going to
[55:51] try to go up in a Rapture he didn't know
[55:52] either that it was going to be 2 000
[55:54] years
[55:55] so when it began to move on and on he
[55:57] tried to stamp it out and put it out and
[55:59] put it out and put it out and put it out
[56:00] and put it up and he's come to the
[56:02] seventh age and it still ain't out
[56:07] he's come to this moment and he still
[56:09] can't do nothing about it
[56:12] Hallelujah
[56:15] he's always attacking
[56:17] both of these books we find Satan's
[56:19] origin
[56:21] in his awful ways and then we also find
[56:24] his destruction
[56:26] I wouldn't like them two books either
[56:30] but I like them because I find my origin
[56:33] and I find my Redemption I find my body
[56:37] change I find me leaving this whole
[56:40] world
[56:41] glory and it causes something on the
[56:44] inside of me to rise up
[56:46] [Applause]
[56:50] oh he hates it he hates to be exposed
[56:55] Satan said he has no part in me or Jesus
[56:58] said it's about Satan he has no part in
[57:00] me and I have no part in him
[57:02] the devil would like to prove that
[57:04] different but he cannot for he does all
[57:06] he can to destroy confidence in the word
[57:11] so that's where he starts he tries to
[57:13] start destroying the confidence in the
[57:16] word
[57:19] so where how how does he how does he
[57:22] start trying to destroy the ministry
[57:23] well what the word said about them
[57:26] so he tries to start destroying
[57:28] confidence in the word what did he do to
[57:31] Eve when he when he finally got her to
[57:32] fall he started by trying to destroy the
[57:35] confidence she had in what God Said
[57:38] so the devil is always there to try to
[57:40] destroy the confidence of the ministry
[57:43] or what God has said and he's trying to
[57:45] destroy why because if he can destroy
[57:47] that he can destroy you
[57:50] know I don't believe well ask Eve
[57:55] when the church disbelieves Satan
[57:58] and believes the spirits revelation of
[58:02] the word
[58:03] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[58:07] her
[58:09] does that stimulate or kind of
[58:15] he said let me let me just put a word
[58:17] here for my own Ministry he says you
[58:20] know all this that this gift in my life
[58:22] is Supernatural it's a gift whereby the
[58:24] holy spirit is able to discern diseases
[58:27] and thoughts of men's hearts and other
[58:28] hidden things that only God can know and
[58:31] then reveal to me I wish you could stand
[58:33] with me and see the faces of people when
[58:36] Satan knows he's going to be exposed
[58:40] amen so now it isn't the people that I'm
[58:44] talking about it's that Satan has got a
[58:46] hold of their lives through sin and
[58:48] difference and disease
[58:51] hello sin indifference and disease but
[58:55] you should see their faces Satan knows
[58:58] he's going to be exposed in the most
[59:00] peculiar change comes over people's
[59:02] countenance Satan is afraid he knows
[59:05] that the spirit of God is about to let
[59:07] the people know of his works
[59:11] that's why he hates he's meeting so much
[59:14] what names are called and diseases are
[59:17] revealed Satan hates that
[59:22] he said it ain't Now by mind reading or
[59:25] telepathy or witchcraft it's a
[59:27] revelation by the Holy Ghost
[59:30] the oil
[59:34] Hallelujah
[59:35] then all of a sudden it becomes revealed
[59:37] to them he's talking about me
[59:44] and he's telling me what my address is
[59:47] he's telling me what I'm going through
[59:49] he's telling me of the diseases that are
[59:52] attacking me he's not exposing me he's
[59:54] exposing what's against me
[59:58] amen if people were beginning to realize
[1:00:00] that's what the word does it isn't that
[1:00:03] the ministry wants to expose you they
[1:00:05] want to expose the disease that is
[1:00:07] against you
[1:00:09] so don't get it mad at the ministry get
[1:00:11] mad at the disease
[1:00:12] [Applause]
[1:00:18] Hallelujah
[1:00:21] so let me show you another reason why
[1:00:23] Satan hates This Book of Revelation
[1:00:26] he knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:00:28] yesterday today and forever and he
[1:00:31] changes not
[1:00:33] so if he wanted oil and wine he still
[1:00:37] wants oil and wine
[1:00:40] well I don't know about that what either
[1:00:43] that or he's not Jesus Christ the same
[1:00:44] yesterday today and forever let's just
[1:00:46] rip that one out of the book too
[1:00:51] but the problem is people want to try to
[1:00:53] interject their ideas of how they think
[1:00:56] God ought to operate and how he responds
[1:00:58] and how somebody ought to respond when
[1:01:01] he comes by
[1:01:04] and they want to start dictating what
[1:01:07] the oil and the wine and how much can be
[1:01:09] released and how much you can drink and
[1:01:11] how much you can amen how much of the
[1:01:13] effect can be lived out in your life
[1:01:22] foreign
[1:01:23] so he knows
[1:01:26] he said he knows that a whole lot more
[1:01:28] than 90 percent of theologians
[1:01:32] he knows that God is immutable in his
[1:01:34] nature
[1:01:35] then he's just as Mu and if he's
[1:01:37] immutable in his nature then he's just
[1:01:38] as immutable in his ways
[1:01:41] so if he still wants blood sacrifice if
[1:01:44] he wanted it then he wants it now
[1:01:47] if he wants oil and wine then he wants
[1:01:49] it now
[1:01:51] amen thus Satan knows assuredly that the
[1:01:55] original Church in Pentecost with the
[1:01:58] power of God March 16 in action is the
[1:02:02] true church that Jesus claims as his own
[1:02:06] all else is false
[1:02:11] it has to be
[1:02:14] he said but now remember this Christ in
[1:02:16] the true church
[1:02:17] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:02:22] but the Book of Revelation shows that
[1:02:24] that Antichrist Spirit would come into
[1:02:26] the church and defile it making it what
[1:02:28] lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:02:33] it exposes Satan revealing his works as
[1:02:36] tempted destruction of God's people and
[1:02:38] the decre discredited of God's word
[1:02:40] right down to the time he's cast in the
[1:02:43] Lake of Fire
[1:02:46] so that word is still exposing him
[1:02:50] because as far as I know he's not in the
[1:02:52] Lake of Fire much as I'd want him to be
[1:02:54] he ain't there yet but he does have his
[1:02:56] day coming
[1:02:59] I like to think of the devil just like
[1:03:01] this when you go to the grocery store
[1:03:03] and you see like you're going to get a
[1:03:04] gallon of milk and there's a date up
[1:03:06] there
[1:03:07] and just say it says 10 or no yeah let's
[1:03:10] go a little further 112 2023
[1:03:14] there's a date there
[1:03:16] that says this is no good no more after
[1:03:19] this date
[1:03:21] don't drink it
[1:03:22] the devil has an expiration date
[1:03:29] he has a predetermined day God knows
[1:03:33] when it is I don't know no man knows but
[1:03:35] God has put a date on his life oh my
[1:03:38] well Hallelujah that when it comes to
[1:03:41] this moment past that it's over
[1:03:45] pass that he's finished
[1:03:48] you say well that's the Lake of Fire
[1:03:50] well also amen the devil has been
[1:03:52] tormenting you has an expiration date
[1:03:55] that one day you'll be walking and
[1:03:58] you'll be dealing with trials and the
[1:04:00] next day it'll all be over with
[1:04:04] it causes a stimulation to rise up
[1:04:12] Hallelujah one day he's tormenting you
[1:04:14] and then that stays gone
[1:04:17] one days made you sick in the body and
[1:04:19] the next day he's finished
[1:04:21] [Music]
[1:04:22] one day he's got your son and the next
[1:04:25] day your son's free
[1:04:30] he has an expiration date
[1:04:35] let's just rejoice in that this morning
[1:04:37] the devil has an end
[1:04:40] the devil has an end shake this has an
[1:04:43] end
[1:04:44] depression has an end
[1:04:48] fair and anxiety and every David of hell
[1:04:51] has an end
[1:04:59] what you need to do is look at your
[1:05:01] devil and say devil you have an end
[1:05:04] [Applause]
[1:05:12] Hallelujah hey man he fights that
[1:05:15] [Applause]
[1:05:18] he can't stand against it
[1:05:21] he knows that if the people
[1:05:24] all right
[1:05:29] he knows that if the people get the
[1:05:32] revelation
[1:05:34] of what
[1:05:35] the true church
[1:05:38] and not just a church not just an
[1:05:41] assembly of people not just a gathering
[1:05:45] not just singing a few songs and having
[1:05:48] a few good words and walking out and
[1:05:50] saying I've done my religion for the
[1:05:52] week no the true church
[1:05:54] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:05:57] that she
[1:06:01] how many is she this morning
[1:06:04] how many's got a direct Revelation I'm
[1:06:06] she
[1:06:06] [Applause]
[1:06:09] I'm she she can do the Greater Works
[1:06:14] she will be an invincible Army
[1:06:17] they get a true revelation of the two
[1:06:19] spirits
[1:06:21] within the framework of the Christian
[1:06:22] church
[1:06:23] and by God's spirit discern and
[1:06:26] withstand
[1:06:28] not just oh I see it over there
[1:06:30] withstand it
[1:06:32] put something in you though come move
[1:06:35] you
[1:06:39] make you violent
[1:06:44] time will get a little bit not just a
[1:06:46] little bit let me rephrase that it's
[1:06:47] time we get a lot
[1:06:49] mad at the Devil
[1:06:56] and withstanding Satan will be powerless
[1:06:59] before her
[1:07:02] how many is the her
[1:07:04] he will be definitely thwarted today as
[1:07:07] when Christ withstood his ever effort to
[1:07:09] gain power over him in the desert yes
[1:07:11] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:07:15] yeah with true Revelation Our Lives the
[1:07:18] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[1:07:21] but we will prevail over them
[1:07:25] it don't say that the Gates of Hell
[1:07:26] won't be against you
[1:07:29] if they're not going to Prevail that
[1:07:31] means they're trying to prevail
[1:07:33] they're trying to tear you down they're
[1:07:36] trying to bring you down but the word
[1:07:38] says they will not
[1:07:48] you know Moses by intellectual knowledge
[1:07:52] been passed down he tried to deliver
[1:07:54] Israel
[1:07:58] he had the word
[1:08:01] he had the promise
[1:08:03] he had been taught it from a young man
[1:08:05] he knew it by intellectual knowledge
[1:08:08] he was going to be a deliverer he was
[1:08:10] told that over and over over he had
[1:08:12] tried it in his own works and his own
[1:08:14] deeds and failed
[1:08:16] he didn't deliver him he killed one
[1:08:18] Egyptian
[1:08:21] but what he was lacking what he what
[1:08:24] what he was lacking he met on the back
[1:08:27] side of the desert
[1:08:29] the pillar of Fire
[1:08:31] the spirit the all
[1:08:33] amen and he'd be getting first he began
[1:08:36] to question well why me I don't even
[1:08:37] talk why me I stutter why me but the
[1:08:40] spirit began to move past all of his
[1:08:42] questions and all of his reasonings and
[1:08:45] all the why Nots he'd been out there and
[1:08:47] got a 40 Years of why not
[1:08:52] a bunch of why not
[1:08:54] why why why why why
[1:08:57] and here but all of a sudden he sees a
[1:08:59] bush that's on fire but it ain't burning
[1:09:01] though well I'm gonna go check this out
[1:09:03] and out of that Bush was what a voice
[1:09:09] I don't know your voice and began to
[1:09:11] speak and said Moses take off your shoes
[1:09:13] you're on Holy Ground
[1:09:19] and through that communication they're
[1:09:22] beginning to be a revelation that was
[1:09:23] transferred to him as it began to look
[1:09:27] and he sees his hand going to his breast
[1:09:28] and come out white and go back in and
[1:09:31] come out clean he sees his Rod turn into
[1:09:33] a snake and he runs and the voice says
[1:09:35] come back and pick it up
[1:09:37] I'm showing you that you've got dominion
[1:09:39] over it
[1:09:40] and he comes back and he picks it up and
[1:09:42] it brought it back to A rod again amen
[1:09:44] Revelations struck him
[1:09:47] and apparently it has stimulated him so
[1:09:50] much that he ran back to the house he
[1:09:53] packed his cow or his mule had his wife
[1:09:55] and his child grabbed his staff and went
[1:09:57] down to Egypt to what take over
[1:10:03] he said Moses took this stick
[1:10:05] and he went there and took that Nation
[1:10:08] took a nation out of a Nation
[1:10:11] when it came with a stick in his hand he
[1:10:13] told Pharaoh let my people go
[1:10:17] Pharaoh seen in Moses The Works that he
[1:10:20] had faith in what he was doing
[1:10:22] he had faith in the promise of God that
[1:10:25] it made the promise and he went down and
[1:10:27] to take it over no other man would have
[1:10:29] done it no other man would have thought
[1:10:31] it was possible
[1:10:34] listen we ain't talking about taking a
[1:10:37] gun and going taking over a restaurant
[1:10:40] Mike can do that
[1:10:42] we're not talking about taking a machine
[1:10:43] gun and going getting your car off a car
[1:10:45] lot Mike can do that
[1:10:47] he was taking a donkey a wife and a
[1:10:50] child and a rod and going down to the
[1:10:52] most powerful Nation at that moment
[1:11:03] everybody like you going up to the White
[1:11:05] House with a plum limb
[1:11:08] I'm here to take over
[1:11:10] well you better have a revelation
[1:11:15] are you gonna get kicked out probably
[1:11:17] won't even make it up there
[1:11:19] but if God told you to go do it you'll
[1:11:21] go do it
[1:11:24] that's the problem with a lot of people
[1:11:26] they blame a lot of stuff on God
[1:11:29] they're so spiritual and high-minded
[1:11:31] with God I have not there's some people
[1:11:34] that God lies to more than anybody ever
[1:11:35] seen in my life
[1:11:40] come on now
[1:11:41] [Laughter]
[1:11:44] God told me this and God told me that
[1:11:47] and God showed me this and God said and
[1:11:48] not one of them has ever come to pass
[1:11:52] I know who he was it was God human
[1:11:56] abilities and human mind and what you
[1:11:59] thought what you thought was should be
[1:12:01] done
[1:12:02] Moses tried to do it when he thought it
[1:12:04] should be done and it didn't work
[1:12:06] but when God said it's time to do it
[1:12:09] it worked
[1:12:11] Hallelujah
[1:12:14] about to turn this over brother Aaron
[1:12:17] laughs
[1:12:20] so when the time of the promise Drew now
[1:12:23] there was a little boy born Fairchild
[1:12:25] his parents amram and Jacob was not
[1:12:28] afraid of the king's commandment and
[1:12:30] there was something grounds were already
[1:12:31] being prepared he said go God I hope I'm
[1:12:34] speaking to people that are prepared
[1:12:37] that seeds can fall right into the right
[1:12:39] place and bring forth fruit
[1:12:43] they say what brother Brandon what kind
[1:12:45] what kind of text it takes
[1:12:47] what what about this
[1:12:50] what about Moses that would do something
[1:12:53] like this
[1:12:54] he said Moses expressed faith in the
[1:12:58] promise of God that he believed and
[1:13:00] Pharaoh the man could see what it was he
[1:13:03] couldn't see how Moses was going to do
[1:13:05] it but you know Moses believed and what
[1:13:07] he was talking about he wouldn't be
[1:13:08] standing in that palace with a stick in
[1:13:10] his hand
[1:13:12] but the stick I'll take he said buy this
[1:13:14] stick I'll take them out from you an old
[1:13:17] man 80 years old not an athlete an old
[1:13:19] man stoop shoulders Whiskers hanging
[1:13:21] down his probably down to his waistline
[1:13:23] gray hair
[1:13:24] looked impossible but I'm going to take
[1:13:27] them out let them go that's thus saith
[1:13:31] the Lord
[1:13:33] now if it had been Moses saith it
[1:13:35] wouldn't happen
[1:13:38] but it was thus saith the Lord
[1:13:43] I mean thinking one Spirit could have
[1:13:45] ended it
[1:13:47] one little shot from a bow could have
[1:13:49] finished it but he stood there Fearless
[1:13:52] because he knew God spoke to me and it
[1:13:55] became a revelation to where he was so
[1:13:57] stimulated by it he would lose his mind
[1:13:59] and go down there until Pharaoh face to
[1:14:02] face let him go
[1:14:03] if you don't let them go I'm going to
[1:14:05] torment you
[1:14:08] you and what army
[1:14:12] I don't need an army I've got thus saith
[1:14:14] the Lord
[1:14:18] Hallelujah for God told him you'll come
[1:14:21] back here to this mountain again and
[1:14:23] worship me
[1:14:27] oh Hallelujah
[1:14:31] he said when things are revealed to you
[1:14:33] you are fearless
[1:14:37] you don't care what anybody says or what
[1:14:40] they doubts and they're you could care
[1:14:42] less
[1:14:43] you become Fearless this is the truth
[1:14:46] coming from God then then you become
[1:14:48] Fearless David became Fearless
[1:14:56] David got up that morning his dad come
[1:14:59] to him and said you know I need you to
[1:15:00] go down
[1:15:02] I need you to go down there and take
[1:15:04] some cakes and some figs and some some
[1:15:07] nice nourishment to your brothers they
[1:15:10] got a war going on
[1:15:12] I can see David
[1:15:15] as he began to go and I wish I had the
[1:15:17] voice this morning
[1:15:21] he wasn't going fearful
[1:15:24] he didn't get out of his beds like oh
[1:15:26] man do I really got to go down there he
[1:15:29] couldn't hardly wait
[1:15:32] he wanted to go he's like okay go ahead
[1:15:35] load them up load them up come on let's
[1:15:36] go
[1:15:37] I'm ready to go I I got something in my
[1:15:40] heart that I I got to be there
[1:15:44] it was something that was moving him
[1:15:46] something that was that was firing him
[1:15:48] up
[1:15:49] something that was come over in him
[1:15:51] something that was overtaking him
[1:15:54] and listen it didn't just start when he
[1:15:56] got to the Battleground it started way
[1:15:58] before he got to the Battleground he
[1:16:00] said got out of his bed and put that one
[1:16:02] foot on it he said wow it feels good to
[1:16:05] be a son of Abraham
[1:16:08] amen I'm I'm blessed to be able to stand
[1:16:10] right here in the same land Abraham
[1:16:13] walked in Abraham talked in the same
[1:16:16] land that the angels of God visited
[1:16:18] Abraham the same place that they changed
[1:16:21] their bodies and gave them a son it
[1:16:23] feels good to be a son of Abraham
[1:16:26] whoa I don't change it a little bit when
[1:16:29] you get up on a Sunday morning and you
[1:16:32] put one foot down so wow I'm in the land
[1:16:35] I'm in the same land Peter talked about
[1:16:38] and he said repent and be baptizing me
[1:16:41] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:43] I'm in that land I'm in the land of the
[1:16:45] routine I'm in the land of shouting
[1:16:48] hallelujahs and praising God I'm in the
[1:16:51] land to overcome every enemy because
[1:16:54] this is my land
[1:16:56] all right
[1:17:01] Hallelujah
[1:17:05] he began to sing his way all the way
[1:17:07] down there
[1:17:10] I'm no doubt he would have sang that
[1:17:12] song we heard this morning
[1:17:14] Mercy
[1:17:18] mercy and goodness has brought me to
[1:17:21] this place
[1:17:22] I'm here because of his Mercy
[1:17:28] I'm not here because why why was David
[1:17:31] doing this why was David so happy why
[1:17:34] was David moving like this
[1:17:36] because David had already been in the
[1:17:39] anointing oil
[1:17:43] he had been anointed for King
[1:17:50] hello somebody I'm looking at a people
[1:17:53] why are you stimulated why are they why
[1:17:56] do you hear the word it makes you shout
[1:17:58] and dance and move around because you've
[1:18:00] been in the anointing more
[1:18:02] amen the anointing oil has been poured
[1:18:05] over your life and not just to be a
[1:18:07] peoner or just a pond somewhere but you
[1:18:10] have been anointed Kings and Priests
[1:18:13] of the most high God and he's placed you
[1:18:16] in a place of authority
[1:18:20] so David woke up in his place of
[1:18:22] authority
[1:18:26] he went down to that service on a Sunday
[1:18:28] morning
[1:18:31] he walked out there he'd cut around that
[1:18:34] last corner
[1:18:35] just got him a comfortable spot on a
[1:18:37] rock
[1:18:38] he's looking for his brothers
[1:18:42] and he found him a real comfy spot it
[1:18:45] was about it was Green
[1:18:46] about that thick
[1:18:48] little place of his back can lean up
[1:18:50] against it's like man this is a good
[1:18:52] spot
[1:18:54] I found a good spot all of a sudden he
[1:18:56] hears a voice
[1:18:58] send me a man
[1:19:02] I defile the armies of the Living God
[1:19:08] send me a man that'll fight me and if he
[1:19:11] wins we'll serve you but if I win you'll
[1:19:13] serve me
[1:19:18] well you know what you need to do is
[1:19:20] look that devil in an eye and say you
[1:19:21] know what I may not win every battle but
[1:19:23] if I lose I'm still not serving you
[1:19:30] a bunch of nonsense
[1:19:32] amen but he he said brother brother
[1:19:34] Bradham said you know he said that giant
[1:19:36] I didn't said these things before but
[1:19:38] that giant had come out there that
[1:19:39] morning he says 40 days
[1:19:42] 40 church services
[1:19:49] and he sat there and he made his
[1:19:51] Challenge and he made his Challenge and
[1:19:53] he went back in his tent said boy a
[1:19:55] bunch of chickens they won't do nothing
[1:19:56] about it they're just going on like they
[1:19:58] always went on they just still stay send
[1:20:01] me a man
[1:20:02] but on this day
[1:20:06] it happened to be the day of his
[1:20:08] expiration date
[1:20:11] he didn't know it the children of Israel
[1:20:14] didn't know it even David didn't even
[1:20:16] know it but God had put it on his life
[1:20:18] said this day you're going to die this
[1:20:21] day your head's coming off this day
[1:20:24] you're gonna fall
[1:20:27] and you ain't gonna fall before great
[1:20:29] Harmony you're gonna fall before a
[1:20:31] little Ruddy boy
[1:20:34] I wish I had the voice to preach right
[1:20:36] now Hallelujah you may not feel like
[1:20:39] much you may feel soaking insignificant
[1:20:42] but what if today was the day that devil
[1:20:46] had his expiration date
[1:20:51] all it takes is a man

[1:25:30] daddy did but God is a chain breaker
[1:25:36] what my dad done is not my same
[1:25:39] destination
[1:25:41] what my mom
[1:25:43] I'm a son I'm a I'm a daughter of the
[1:25:46] living king of God
[1:25:50] and I'm from another kingdom
[1:25:55] get Fearless
[1:25:58] I ain't done
[1:26:00] get Fearless
[1:26:02] get Fearless
[1:26:04] you I don't care there's more if you
[1:26:07] want to stand up or you want to sit down
[1:26:08] I don't really care just whatever you do
[1:26:11] grab a promise
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:17] but I will say this
[1:26:19] if David would have stayed in his seat
[1:26:22] he'd have never got a promise
[1:26:24] [Applause]
[1:26:26] hey man let me go back over here
[1:26:29] David wasn't a match for this giant
[1:26:34] this man had shoulders that were would
[1:26:36] almost bust the door open probably when
[1:26:38] he walked his head would hit up the duck
[1:26:40] maybe crawl through
[1:26:42] he wasn't no joke
[1:26:47] looked impossible but David wasn't
[1:26:49] looking at it impossible he was looking
[1:26:51] past impossible
[1:26:54] Revelation struck him
[1:26:56] he said see I've already been here God's
[1:27:00] delivered me out of the Paul the bear
[1:27:01] and he delivered me out of the Paw of
[1:27:03] the line how much more
[1:27:07] well he delivered me from that
[1:27:09] uncircumcised devil
[1:27:15] come on somebody
[1:27:17] he delivered me from a car wreck
[1:27:19] he's going to save my soul he brought me
[1:27:22] to this place how much more he deliver
[1:27:24] me from the spirit that's been haunting
[1:27:26] my life
[1:27:28] it's uncircumcised devil that has no
[1:27:31] right being in this land
[1:27:37] brothers that were probably more able
[1:27:41] they've been in the Army longer than he
[1:27:43] had ever he ain't even been in the Army
[1:27:44] so
[1:27:45] I mean they've been they've been trained
[1:27:49] I never forget hearing brother Danny
[1:27:51] steaming preach on this and he says John
[1:27:54] that giant would come out and make his
[1:27:55] boast and all that Army run back in them
[1:27:58] tents whoop out their laptops and see if
[1:28:00] they could find a quote about it
[1:28:02] foreign
[1:28:06] that's all right if you find a quote but
[1:28:09] do something with it
[1:28:11] if the quote just stays in the tent
[1:28:13] it ain't going to be anything
[1:28:19] if it just stays in the tent
[1:28:21] and it don't become an expression
[1:28:25] well I love the Lord well if it just
[1:28:27] stays in the tent and it don't become an
[1:28:29] expression he don't even know if you
[1:28:31] love him or not he wants expression
[1:28:36] amen
[1:28:38] if it's absolutely revealed to you that
[1:28:40] God's going to heal you you're going to
[1:28:42] get it
[1:28:45] if it's absolute a reveal I said I don't
[1:28:47] care what's wrong with you what the odds
[1:28:49] are
[1:28:50] the doctor may have come and said the
[1:28:52] odds are no good
[1:28:54] well what he ain't putting into the
[1:28:56] equation in his impossible math
[1:29:00] is there an equalizer there
[1:29:03] I really wish I'd have paid him
[1:29:05] attention to math now because there's
[1:29:06] probably something really good in that
[1:29:09] there's an equalizer there
[1:29:12] can take any odds
[1:29:15] any odds
[1:29:18] they may be a hundred percent against
[1:29:20] you
[1:29:21] any odds
[1:29:23] and make it possible
[1:29:28] so it really doesn't matter if the
[1:29:30] doctor says 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
[1:29:33] percent chance you're not going to have
[1:29:35] or you're not going to be or you're
[1:29:37] going to die it don't matter what does
[1:29:39] that mean that's the best he can do
[1:29:41] that's his abilities he learned he done
[1:29:43] he's applied itself great
[1:29:45] but there's an odd
[1:29:47] equalizer
[1:29:50] and he's in the building this morning
[1:29:55] he's here to give life he's here to give
[1:29:58] stimulation
[1:30:00] he's here to invoke something
[1:30:07] whenever it was revealed to him he
[1:30:09] became Fearless he just would tell that
[1:30:11] devil anything today
[1:30:12] I'm going to cut your head off
[1:30:15] well I'm sure that made you Goliath real
[1:30:17] happy
[1:30:19] well that was that was a thank you for
[1:30:22] being so kind
[1:30:25] he said well who in the world sent this
[1:30:28] little boy out here
[1:30:31] this is nonsense is it wasn't there a
[1:30:34] man
[1:30:35] but you sent this little squirt
[1:30:39] and he's laughing and he's making fun
[1:30:41] and he he's making fun of the he don't
[1:30:44] know that he's not really making fun of
[1:30:46] David
[1:30:47] he's making fun of the oil
[1:30:53] that was poured over him by a prophet
[1:30:57] that's really what he's making fun of
[1:31:00] he's trying to make fun of David but
[1:31:02] what he don't see is the voice that's in
[1:31:04] the midst
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:07] and there's a voice that is speaking and
[1:31:09] when it was I'm going to take your head
[1:31:11] off it wasn't a little four and a half
[1:31:13] foot boy that said that
[1:31:15] it was the anointing the holy ghost that
[1:31:18] said that
[1:31:20] it was a revelation that said that it
[1:31:23] was the voice that spoke
[1:31:26] sure to use David's voice but there was
[1:31:29] a voice that spoke because it happened
[1:31:32] if David would have said that and that
[1:31:34] giant went and killed David then it
[1:31:36] wouldn't have been The Voice or the oil
[1:31:37] that said it had been David getting
[1:31:39] worked up
[1:31:42] but there was more than that
[1:31:44] David became Fearless because he had a
[1:31:47] true revelation
[1:31:48] he didn't care what anybody else said
[1:31:50] his brothers can make fun of him and
[1:31:53] they did
[1:31:56] other churches make fun of you and they
[1:31:58] have
[1:32:03] bam
[1:32:05] they'll make fun of your singing they'll
[1:32:06] make fun of your worship they'll make
[1:32:08] fun of your response they'll they'll
[1:32:09] make fun and they'll make fun and make
[1:32:11] fun
[1:32:14] but you don't got to pay no attention to
[1:32:15] that
[1:32:18] David's brother's like you're making
[1:32:21] yourself into somebody who do you think
[1:32:24] you are you're supposed to be back with
[1:32:26] a sheep
[1:32:28] you're supposed to be back there
[1:32:31] well fine but why don't you do something
[1:32:33] about this voice that is speaking over
[1:32:35] here
[1:32:39] but David said no I'm here for a purpose
[1:32:43] I'm here to take his head off
[1:32:46] amen he said see I don't know brother
[1:32:49] Brown caught a little Hunchback looking
[1:32:50] boy seeing his heart the same God in
[1:32:53] that crucial moment
[1:32:55] he said it moved upon him he's the same
[1:32:57] God in this crucial moment that could
[1:32:59] take that woman from a wheelchair that
[1:33:02] man if you can believe with all your
[1:33:04] trouble God will reveal it to you then
[1:33:06] you won't be able to say there
[1:33:09] foreign
[1:33:11] amen you believe that
[1:33:13] he says the Giant
[1:33:15] didn't believe it he said neither will
[1:33:17] the cancer
[1:33:19] he'll laugh at you and say oh my dog you
[1:33:22] sent a kid here to fight with me that
[1:33:24] didn't Shake David all he had a faith in
[1:33:26] what he was doing he knew he was going
[1:33:29] to do it because God had put it there
[1:33:31] already
[1:33:38] he would go on
[1:33:40] so many others Samson was called out
[1:33:44] with a thousand Philistines
[1:33:47] and all he had he have nothing
[1:33:49] and he looked down he seen this old
[1:33:51] dried up mule and died it's like Mueller
[1:33:53] died and he's picked up his old dry
[1:33:55] Jawbone just as dry as it could be and
[1:33:58] he took after those Philistines beating
[1:34:00] him over the head with this old dry drop
[1:34:02] Jawbone of a mule
[1:34:04] he said it was something amazing because
[1:34:06] it would break through metal
[1:34:08] and breakthrough helmets and kill all up
[1:34:12] to a thousand
[1:34:15] I've said this before but it's worth
[1:34:17] repeating
[1:34:18] how stupid is the Philistines
[1:34:24] I mean I've got 10.
[1:34:28] you're the 11th and you keep fighting
[1:34:31] but you're 990 and you're still trying
[1:34:33] to kill this guy
[1:34:38] it don't make no sense
[1:34:41] that's how stupid the devil is
[1:34:46] he's trying with it and he knows
[1:34:49] he has an end
[1:34:52] he don't know when it is but he knows he
[1:34:54] has he he knows he has a short time
[1:34:57] but he's fighting and he's fighting and
[1:35:00] he's fighting
[1:35:01] well I mean if a God knowing he has an
[1:35:03] end we'll fight that hard
[1:35:06] how much more should we fight who has no
[1:35:09] wind
[1:35:13] spoke that to the young people up there
[1:35:15] in Ohio we have something worth fighting
[1:35:17] for
[1:35:19] Amen brother man will say it he said I
[1:35:21] have a seat sitting at a table that's
[1:35:24] over a thousand miles long it's got my
[1:35:26] name on it
[1:35:27] he said I want to sit there and I'm
[1:35:29] going to begin to talk to others and no
[1:35:31] Heroes of Faith and he said tears will
[1:35:33] come down our eyes he said but about
[1:35:34] that moment he'll walk out of the glory
[1:35:37] and he'll reach down and he'll wipe
[1:35:39] those tears away
[1:35:43] he said so we got something worth
[1:35:45] fighting for
[1:35:47] so if we're going to fight let's make it
[1:35:50] a good fight
[1:35:52] let's fight with everything that we have
[1:35:54] within us

[1:36:10] got up this morning and I couldn't even

[1:44:22] made by fire unto the Lord
[1:44:26] and thou shall be a continual burn
[1:44:28] offering throughout your Generations at
[1:44:29] the door of the Tabernacle of the
[1:44:31] congregation before the Lord where I
[1:44:34] will meet you and speak there unto thee
[1:44:36] and there I will meet with the children
[1:44:38] of Israel and the Tabernacle shall be
[1:44:40] Sanctified by my glory
[1:44:43] hey
[1:44:44] you want his glory then bring the oil
[1:44:47] and wine
[1:44:51] don't leave it out
[1:44:53] if you leave any part of what he's
[1:44:55] asking out you're not going to see his
[1:44:57] glory
[1:44:58] you might see your intellectual ability
[1:45:00] you might see is that your intellectual
[1:45:02] understanding but you will not see his
[1:45:04] glory
[1:45:07] and I will sanctify the Tabernacle of
[1:45:09] the congregation and the Altar and I
[1:45:11] will sanctify also both Aaron and my son
[1:45:13] some minister to me in the priest's
[1:45:15] office and I would dwell among the
[1:45:18] children of Israel and be their God and
[1:45:20] they so know that I am the Lord their
[1:45:21] God that brought them forth out of the
[1:45:24] land of Egypt then I may dwell among
[1:45:26] them I am the Lord their God
[1:45:30] and daily
[1:45:32] morning and evening on the behalf of the
[1:45:35] whole Congregation of Israel the priest
[1:45:37] to offer a lamb
[1:45:39] with the accompanying meal of and drink
[1:45:42] offerings
[1:45:43] thus day by day the dedication of all
[1:45:47] the people was renewed it's not just a
[1:45:51] Sunday morning sacrifice
[1:45:53] is not just a Wednesday night sacrifice
[1:45:57] but it's a continual offering unto the
[1:45:59] Lord this amplifies a continual
[1:46:03] intercession which Christ ever lives to
[1:46:06] make yet that one offering thus becomes
[1:46:09] a continual offering
[1:46:12] this teaches us to offer up to God
[1:46:15] the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and
[1:46:18] praise every day
[1:46:21] every morning every evening in Humble
[1:46:25] acknowledgment of our dependence upon
[1:46:26] him and also of our obligations to him
[1:46:30] our daily devotions must be looked upon
[1:46:32] as the most needful of our daily works
[1:46:35] and the most Pleasant of our daily
[1:46:37] comforts
[1:46:38] wow
[1:46:40] whatever business we have this must
[1:46:43] never be omitted either morning or
[1:46:45] evening
[1:46:46] prayer time must be kept up as a duty as
[1:46:50] me time the daily sacrifices were his
[1:46:53] daily meals in God's house and therefore
[1:46:56] they were always attended with Bread and
[1:46:59] Wine
[1:46:59] with oil and wine these those Stars
[1:47:03] those starve their own Souls that kept
[1:47:06] not a constant attendance on the throne
[1:47:09] of grace
[1:47:12] but Satan has tried to take the oil and
[1:47:14] wine
[1:47:16] the lifeline out of the body through the
[1:47:19] Dark Ages
[1:47:21] and would have done it
[1:47:23] and would have done it except the voice
[1:47:26] said don't hurt it
[1:47:29] because there had to be a restoration
[1:47:32] not a replacement
[1:47:37] hello somebody
[1:47:38] he was going to restore the restoration
[1:47:41] of the Bride tree not the replacement of
[1:47:44] it
[1:47:45] he wasn't going to just start all over
[1:47:47] again but he was going to bring the same
[1:47:49] one up that went down in the beginning
[1:47:51] back up at the end
[1:47:53] therefore to be able to do that the life
[1:47:55] had to travel through so the voice said
[1:47:58] don't you touch that
[1:48:00] and that voice is still saying that
[1:48:01] today
[1:48:05] so to have a restoration there has to be
[1:48:08] something left to restore
[1:48:11] so let's turn to Joel 1 and verse 1 the
[1:48:13] word of the Lord that came to Joel the
[1:48:15] son of pathwell hear this you old men
[1:48:18] I guess that means me this morning
[1:48:20] and give here all your inhabitants of
[1:48:23] the land
[1:48:24] had this been in your days or even in
[1:48:26] the days of your father tell you of your
[1:48:28] children of it and let your children
[1:48:30] tell their children and their children
[1:48:32] another generation
[1:48:35] excuse me
[1:48:36] that which the palm of worm has left has
[1:48:39] the locus eaten that was the Locust has
[1:48:41] left has the canker worm eaten and that
[1:48:43] which the kinky worm is left has the
[1:48:45] caterpillar eaten wakey junk drunkards
[1:48:48] and weep and howl all you drinkers of
[1:48:51] wine because of the new wine for it is
[1:48:54] cut off
[1:48:55] from your mouth
[1:48:58] for a nation has come up before my land
[1:49:00] strong and without number whose teeth or
[1:49:02] the teeth of a lion his cheek teeth of a
[1:49:04] great line and he's laid my Vine waste
[1:49:07] and barked my fig tree and he's made it
[1:49:10] clean bare and cast it away the branches
[1:49:13] thereof are made white
[1:49:16] lament Like a Virgin girl it was cyclos
[1:49:19] for the husband of her youth the meat
[1:49:21] offering of the drink offering is cut
[1:49:22] off from the house of the Lord the
[1:49:24] priests and the Lord's ministers mourn
[1:49:27] field is wasted the land way it mourneth
[1:49:30] for the corn is wasted and the new wine
[1:49:33] just dried up and the oil languisheth
[1:49:37] so there it is wine and oil be ashamed
[1:49:40] oh your husband how oh you Vine dressers
[1:49:43] for the wheat and for the barley because
[1:49:45] the Harvest of the field is perished
[1:49:48] the vine is dried up in the Fig Tree
[1:49:50] language with
[1:49:51] and the pomegranate and the palm and the
[1:49:54] apple and all the trees of the field are
[1:49:55] withered because Joy is withered away
[1:49:59] from the sons of man
[1:50:02] what
[1:50:04] because Joy is with why why is Joy gone
[1:50:07] because Revelation is gone
[1:50:10] and Revelation brings stimulation
[1:50:14] Revelation left during the Dark Age sure
[1:50:17] Parts I'm going to grab a certain part
[1:50:19] Wesley regard Lutheran grab a part in
[1:50:22] West Liberty but the full round of
[1:50:24] Revelation was ate away
[1:50:27] therefore stimulation was gone
[1:50:36] because the joy is withered away from
[1:50:38] the sons of men gird yourself and lament
[1:50:40] you priests
[1:50:41] how you Ministers of the altar come lie
[1:50:44] all night in cycloff
[1:50:46] that's what ministers should be doing if
[1:50:48] they don't see the oil and wine in their
[1:50:50] Church
[1:50:51] not making excuses for why it ain't
[1:50:53] there
[1:50:55] but saying God we need it
[1:51:00] loud night in cyclophy ministers and my
[1:51:03] God for the meat offering to drink
[1:51:04] office withholder from the house of your
[1:51:06] God sanctify your fast call us all the
[1:51:09] assembly gather the elders and all the
[1:51:11] inhabitants of the land of the house the
[1:51:12] Lord your God and cry into them so this
[1:51:15] must be important
[1:51:18] a last for the day for the day of the
[1:51:20] Lord is a hand and destruction from
[1:51:21] Almighty shall it come
[1:51:23] this is not the meat cut off before our
[1:51:25] eyes
[1:51:26] yay joy and gladness from the house of
[1:51:30] our God
[1:51:31] the seed is rotten under their clods and
[1:51:33] the Garners are laid desolate and the
[1:51:36] barns are broken down
[1:51:38] they don't have no faith to move
[1:51:40] anything anymore
[1:51:42] they've allowed their altars to be moved
[1:51:44] into the basement
[1:51:46] they don't believe in prayer lines no
[1:51:48] more
[1:51:49] things have become very desolate why
[1:51:52] because there's no oil and there's no
[1:51:54] wine
[1:51:58] it isn't in his fullness to bring
[1:52:00] stimulation to bring growth to bring
[1:52:02] movement
[1:52:04] how the Beast grown
[1:52:08] and the herds of cattle are perplexed
[1:52:10] because they have no pasture
[1:52:17] people are becoming very perplexed in
[1:52:19] this age
[1:52:20] they can't find anything good to eat
[1:52:22] listen children brother I'm talking
[1:52:24] about he said children you've got to eat
[1:52:26] out of a garbage can if they have to
[1:52:29] say but they don't have to he said the
[1:52:31] skies were full
[1:52:34] of the Pentecostal blessings
[1:52:38] but why are people don't have something
[1:52:40] to eat why are they languishing why
[1:52:46] so Lord today will I Cry
[1:52:49] for the fires divide the pastures of the
[1:52:51] Wilderness and the flame has burned all
[1:52:53] the trees of the field and the Beast of
[1:52:55] the field cry also unto thee for the
[1:52:57] rivers and Waters are dried up and fire
[1:52:59] had to fire the pastors of the
[1:53:01] wilderness

[1:53:10] seemed like nothing is left but
[1:53:12] Blackness and Ashes

[1:53:20] trumpet and Zion
[1:53:22] sound alarm on my Holy Mountain let all
[1:53:24] the inhabitants of the land tremble for
[1:53:26] the day of the Lord cometh
[1:53:29] for it is not hand a day of darkness and
[1:53:32] of gloominess a day of clouds and of
[1:53:34] thick Darkness as the morning spread
[1:53:35] upon the mountains a great people and
[1:53:38] strong there hath not been ever like
[1:53:40] neither shall there be any more of it
[1:53:42] even into the years of many generations
[1:53:44] a fire Delight Divine behind them a
[1:53:47] flame burners the land is as a Garden of
[1:53:49] Eden before them but behind them is a
[1:53:52] desolate wilderness

[1:53:57] nothing shall Escape them
[1:54:00] the Empire the appearance of them is as
[1:54:02] appearance of horses oh

[1:54:19] as a Horseman so shall they run like the
[1:54:22] noise of Chariots on the tops of
[1:54:23] mountains so they leave like the noise
[1:54:25] of a flame of fire that devireth the
[1:54:27] stubble as a strong people said in
[1:54:29] battle array before their faces the
[1:54:32] people shall be much pain all their
[1:54:34] faces Shall Gather blackness
[1:54:37] they shall run like Mighty Men
[1:54:40] they shall climb the wall like Men of
[1:54:42] War they shall March every one in his
[1:54:45] own ways and they shall not break their
[1:54:47] ranks
[1:54:48] neither shall one thrust another they
[1:54:50] shall walk everyone in his path and when
[1:54:52] they fall upon the sword they shall not
[1:54:54] be wounded they shall run to and fro
[1:54:56] they shall run upon the wall they shall
[1:54:57] Clump on the house they shall enter into
[1:54:59] the Windows like a thief the Earth shall
[1:55:01] Quake before them the heavens shall
[1:55:03] tremble and the sun and the moon shall
[1:55:05] be dark and the Stars shall withdraw
[1:55:07] their shine in the Lord shall utter his
[1:55:09] voice before his army for his Camp is
[1:55:11] very great for he's strong that
[1:55:12] executeth his word for the day of the
[1:55:15] Lord is great and very terrible and who

[1:56:16] give not thine Heritage to reproach that
[1:56:19] the heathens shall rule over them
[1:56:20] wherefore should they say among the
[1:56:22] people where is their God then will the
[1:56:24] Lord be jealous for his land and piteous
[1:56:27] people yea the Lord will answer and say

[1:56:35] and all and ye shall be satisfied
[1:56:38] therewith and I will no more make your
[1:56:40] approach among the Heathen but I will
[1:56:42] move remove far off of from you the
[1:56:45] northern Army and I will drive him into

[1:57:52] desolation and all that Pro the Army had
[1:57:54] eaten all up and it seemed impossible

[1:57:58] little rotten seed
[1:57:59] and it began to pop up amen it began to
[1:58:02] come out of the ground it laid there
[1:58:04] through a dark age but it came out of
[1:58:06] the ground and Luther said the just
[1:58:07] shall live by faith and it came up a
[1:58:10] little higher Wesley said amen to begin
[1:58:12] to preach the message of sanctification
[1:58:14] and then there was a restoration of the
[1:58:16] gifts

[1:59:43] shall call on the name of the Lord shall
[1:59:46] be delivered
[1:59:48] shall be delivered for in the Mount Zion
[1:59:51] and Jerusalem shall be deliverance and
[1:59:53] the Lord has said in the remnant whom
[1:59:54] the Lord shall call
[1:59:57] so is not a replacement
[2:00:00] it's not something new
[2:00:03] well we got something new no we got how
[2:00:06] we got what Paul preached
[2:00:11] it's a restoration
[2:00:13] it's a restoring back to the church what
[2:00:16] was in the beginning
[2:00:21] therefore it'll have exactly what the
[2:00:23] first church had
[2:00:25] the same power it'll have the same
[2:00:27] passion it'll have the same Glory it'll
[2:00:30] have the same love this was the lamb
[2:00:32] that said I will restore
[2:00:37] not start something new
[2:00:41] well it just started this is playing a
[2:00:43] new plan no he said I'm going to restore
[2:00:45] what that Army did
[2:00:49] but the same life the same oil the same
[2:00:52] wine in the first church will be the
[2:00:55] same oil the same life the same wine in
[2:00:58] the last Church
[2:01:00] don't hurt the oil in the wine the wine
[2:01:02] that brings stimulation not just
[2:01:04] revelation
[2:01:06] but stimulation of Revelation
[2:01:11] if you get just Revelation and it's just
[2:01:13] a bunch of head knowledge and it does
[2:01:15] nothing for you it's nothing but head
[2:01:17] knowledge
[2:01:18] but if it begins to stimulate you to the
[2:01:21] point that you begin to realize I am a
[2:01:23] Son of God I am a daughter of God this
[2:01:26] is my Heritage this is my home this is
[2:01:29] my place this is my promise
[2:01:32] I don't have to bow down to what the
[2:01:34] devil says anymore
[2:01:37] I can worship Him in spirit and Truth
[2:01:41] Mercy how about other one what's
[2:01:44] happened here
[2:01:47] I'm on a different time I think
[2:01:51] it's my birthday let me preach
[2:01:55] amen he says the only way you're going
[2:01:58] to see your way out
[2:02:00] did you hear that
[2:02:02] it's an old-fashioned spiritual Revival
[2:02:05] where the hallelujahs of God is ringing
[2:02:08] from the bottom of your heart an
[2:02:10] old-fashioned Holy Ghost sent Revival
[2:02:12] hit the place then you'll begin to see
[2:02:14] things
[2:02:17] as somebody really got stimulated by
[2:02:20] some drink they see things you can't see
[2:02:24] right that's Naturally Speaking they see
[2:02:25] things they can see a pink elephant walk
[2:02:28] to this room and they can see all kinds
[2:02:29] of stuff I ain't talking about a pink
[2:02:31] elephant
[2:02:32] I ain't talking about some imagination
[2:02:34] but I'm talking about getting stimulated
[2:02:36] enough to where you can leave this old
[2:02:38] pest house this old world and set in
[2:02:41] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and rise
[2:02:44] above your old filthy rotten attitudes
[2:02:46] and things of this life and the devil
[2:02:48] trying to push things down you rise
[2:02:50] above it
[2:02:55] he said wow what a Revival then
[2:02:58] when God starts beginning to reveal
[2:03:00] things you wonder why these real
[2:03:01] Christians are hanging on
[2:03:03] it's because of Revival they got in the
[2:03:05] spirit
[2:03:07] that's the reason that people have
[2:03:09] dances that they don't get have a dance
[2:03:10] so they could get in the spirit of
[2:03:12] dancing you can't have a ball game
[2:03:14] unless you get in the spirit of a ball
[2:03:16] game you got to get in the spirit of you
[2:03:18] can't never have a Revival in Shreveport
[2:03:20] or anywhere else unto the church gets in
[2:03:23] the spirit of Revival God can come and
[2:03:25] perform Miracles he can show wonders he
[2:03:27] can stretch forth his hand to heal the
[2:03:29] sick and The Afflicted and the preacher
[2:03:31] can preach the gospel as hard as he can
[2:03:33] but there'll never be a Revival until
[2:03:35] the church gets in the spirit of it
[2:03:43] he says
[2:03:48] what makes men Gamble
[2:03:51] I just got a few more minutes what makes
[2:03:52] men gamble what makes men carry on
[2:03:55] what makes these little girls and boys
[2:03:57] out there do the little boogie woogie
[2:03:58] and rock and roll and ungodly things
[2:04:02] he said because Sunday school was let
[2:04:04] down and no home was let down and
[2:04:06] parents have let down the Nations let
[2:04:08] down but men sing songs that Inspire him
[2:04:12] it says that's the reason Elvis Presley
[2:04:14] saying All Shook Up
[2:04:16] they didn't they didn't teach them Rock
[2:04:18] of Ages for me that's the reason the
[2:04:20] reason that people don't believe in
[2:04:21] shouting tonight
[2:04:23] but was scream at a ball game is because
[2:04:25] they haven't been taught such things and
[2:04:27] kept away from the Glorious presence of
[2:04:29] Jesus Christ that gives them that
[2:04:31] satisfying portion
[2:04:35] John was in the spirit on the Lord's Day
[2:04:39] get in the spirit however he got the how
[2:04:42] are you ever going to get in the Holy
[2:04:43] Ghost get in the spirit how are you
[2:04:45] going to get something from God get in
[2:04:47] the spirit when you're with a sinner you
[2:04:49] went to a dance you got in the spirit
[2:04:51] you started Clapping Your Hands started
[2:04:52] patting your feet started Shin digging
[2:04:54] throwing your hat on the floor and going
[2:04:56] around around acting silly he was in the
[2:04:58] spirit of it could you imagine a fellow
[2:05:00] with a dance fiend going to a dance
[2:05:02] saying well you all having a pretty good
[2:05:04] time I suppose all they'd say well you
[2:05:06] wall flower get out of here
[2:05:10] wow you Wallflower get out of here amen
[2:05:13] you go to a ball game somebody knock a
[2:05:15] home run or something another sat and
[2:05:16] look and say well I guess that's pretty
[2:05:18] good you ain't a baseball fan but if
[2:05:20] you're a baseball fan somebody hits a
[2:05:22] home run you'll knock somebody else's
[2:05:24] hat off
[2:05:25] shouting and screaming he said the
[2:05:27] church gets in the spirit and begins to
[2:05:29] raise up and holler Glory Hallelujah
[2:05:32] praise the Lord somebody had turned
[2:05:34] around and say you're a Holy Roller he
[2:05:35] said I'm going to ask you a question if
[2:05:37] we are Unholy rollers because our holy
[2:05:39] roses cause we do that then them are
[2:05:41] Unholy rollers out there
[2:05:43] he said I'd rather be a Holy Roller than
[2:05:45] an Unholy one
[2:05:49] Hallelujah amen the Bible will talk
[2:05:52] about when Aaron was going to the holy
[2:05:54] of holies they would pour the oil over
[2:05:56] him
[2:05:57] he says you know
[2:05:59] he said I know you think we're an awful
[2:06:01] noisy bunch
[2:06:04] he said but I can prove to you if there
[2:06:07] ain't no no ain't noisy there ain't no
[2:06:10] God there
[2:06:13] wow
[2:06:14] people don't people that likes the other
[2:06:16] side they don't like these quotes
[2:06:19] rip them out
[2:06:23] but in the Old Testament when Aaron was
[2:06:26] anointed with the rose of Sharon the oil
[2:06:28] of God and he had the anointing run down
[2:06:30] his beard to the hems of his skirt and
[2:06:32] he took the sacrifice and he went into
[2:06:34] the holy of holies
[2:06:36] and he went behind that curtain across
[2:06:37] the Garment and he had a pomegranate and
[2:06:39] a bell
[2:06:40] and they'd hit together and then when he
[2:06:43] walked he played holy holy holy unto the
[2:06:46] Lord that's the anointed Church of God
[2:06:49] moving into the holy of holies
[2:06:52] look here brother that's the reason they
[2:06:54] did that that's the only reason they
[2:06:55] could tell that he was alive
[2:06:58] they had to listen to see if there was
[2:07:00] any noise he said if there's no noise
[2:07:03] he's dead
[2:07:06] that's what's today the church is Born
[2:07:08] Again going into the holy of holies
[2:07:10] Anointed with gods of pomegranate Baal
[2:07:13] Hallelujah you know they're alive

[2:07:26] unto the Lord
[2:07:32] foreign
[2:07:38] to lay a foundation what that incense
[2:07:40] meant and speaking of Christ and
[2:07:41] everything the instance now is his blood
[2:07:43] the rose of sharing the lily of the
[2:07:45] valley and how the high priest before he
[2:07:47] went into the holy of holies had to be
[2:07:49] Anointed with the oil from the top of
[2:07:50] his head and it run all the way down his
[2:07:52] beard and over to over his hems of his
[2:07:54] skirt
[2:07:55] it wasn't just a little bit of a war
[2:07:58] it was a lot of War
[2:08:00] he said somebody happens to tell you
[2:08:02] that these Full Gospel people are just a
[2:08:05] little noisy here's something for them
[2:08:07] Aaron when he went to the holy so holies
[2:08:09] once a year he had to wear that kind of
[2:08:11] garment had to be anointed amen what was
[2:08:13] it that was screaming out he said well
[2:08:16] brother Branham it's just emotional it's
[2:08:18] just emotion he said oh I can
[2:08:20] scientifically prove to you anything
[2:08:22] without emotion is dead so if your
[2:08:25] religion hasn't got any emotion in it
[2:08:27] bury it
[2:08:30] bury it because it ain't no good anyhow
[2:08:34] it's dead

[2:08:40] the body
[2:08:44] hallelujah it's the life if it moves
[2:08:47] through you and it comes into your life
