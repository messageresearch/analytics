[35:09] lord just i commit myself to you for
[35:11] your glory in jesus name
[35:13] amen
[35:18] amen let's turn to ezekiel chapter 36.
[35:25] i had something
[35:26] i
[35:27] was planning on preaching
[35:29] as of this week and but
[35:31] this this chapter here is just
[35:33] so maybe we'll move it on to next
[35:35] wednesday but this chapter's just been
[35:37] rolling through me and i've tried to
[35:38] find a place to just break into it
[35:41] somewhere and
[35:42] and uh it wouldn't be quite as lengthy
[35:45] but i'm gonna have to read the whole
[35:47] chapter
[35:48] amen ezekiel 36 and verse one it says
[35:51] also
[35:52] thou son of man prophesy unto the
[35:54] mountains of israel
[35:56] and say ye mountains of israel hear the
[35:59] word of the lord
[36:00] thus saith the lord god because the
[36:02] enemy has said against you aha
[36:06] even the ancient high places are ours in
[36:08] possession
[36:09] therefore prophesy and say thus saith
[36:12] the lord god
[36:14] because they have made you desolate and
[36:16] swallowed you up on every side
[36:18] that you might be a possession unto the
[36:20] residue of the heathen and you were
[36:23] taken up in the lips of the talkers and
[36:26] our infamy of the people therefore you
[36:28] mountains of israel hear the word of the
[36:30] lord god
[36:32] thus saith the lord god to the mountains
[36:34] and to the hills to the rivers to the
[36:36] valleys to the desolate wastes to the
[36:39] cities that are forsaken that was
[36:41] forsaken which become a prey and
[36:44] derision to the residue of the heathen
[36:46] that are round about
[36:49] therefore thus saith the lord god surely
[36:51] in the fire of my jealousy have i spoken
[36:54] against the residue of the heathen and
[36:57] against idomia
[36:59] which i have which have appointed my
[37:01] land unto the possession with the joy of
[37:03] all their heart with despiteful minds to
[37:06] cast it out for a prey
[37:08] prophesy their concern in the land of
[37:10] israel and say unto the mountains to the
[37:12] hills to the rivers and to the valleys
[37:15] thus saith the lord god
[37:18] behold i have spoken in my jealousy and
[37:20] in my fury because you have borne the
[37:23] shame of the heathen
[37:24] therefore saith the lord god have lifted
[37:27] up my hand surely the heathen thereabout
[37:30] you they shall bear their shame but ye o
[37:33] mountains of israel you shall shoot
[37:34] forth your branches and yield your fruit
[37:37] to my people of israel for they are at
[37:39] hand to come and behold i am for you and
[37:43] i will turn unto you and you shall be
[37:45] tilled and sown
[37:47] and i will multiply men upon you all the
[37:50] howls of israel and even all of it in
[37:52] the cities which be shall be inhabited
[37:55] and the waste shall be builded and i
[37:56] will multiply upon you man and beast and
[37:59] they shall increase and bring forth
[38:00] fruit and i will settle you after your
[38:03] old estates and will do better unto you
[38:06] than at your beginnings and you shall
[38:08] know that i am the lord
[38:10] yea i will i will cause men to walk upon
[38:13] you even my people israel and they shall
[38:15] possess thee
[38:16] and thou shalt be their inheritance and
[38:18] thou shalt no more henceforth bereave
[38:21] them of men
[38:22] thus saith the lord god because they say
[38:24] unto you
[38:25] thou land devourst up men and has
[38:28] bereaved thy nations therefore thou
[38:30] shalt devour men no more neither bereave
[38:32] thy nations any more saith the lord god
[38:35] neither will i cause men to hear in thee
[38:38] the shame of the heathen any more
[38:40] neither shall th
[38:41] shalt thou bear reproach of the people
[38:44] anymore neither shout thou cause thy
[38:46] nations to fall anymore saith the lord
[38:48] god moreover the word of the lord came
[38:51] unto me saying son of man when the house
[38:53] of israel dwelt in their own land they
[38:55] defiled it by their own way and by their
[38:57] doings their way was before me as an
[39:00] uncleanness of a removed woman
[39:02] wherefore i poured my fury upon them for
[39:05] the blood that they had shed upon the
[39:07] land and for their idols wherewith they
[39:09] had polluted it and i scattered them
[39:11] among the heathen and they were
[39:13] dispersed through the countries
[39:14] according to their way according to
[39:16] their doings i judged them and when they
[39:19] entered into the heathen whether they
[39:21] went they profaned my holy name when
[39:23] they said unto them these are the people
[39:25] of the lord and are going forth out of
[39:27] his land but i had pity for my holy name
[39:30] which the house of israel had profaned
[39:32] among the heathen whether they went
[39:34] therefore saying to the house of israel
[39:36] thus saith the lord god
[39:38] i do not this for your sakes o house of
[39:41] israel but from my holy name's sake
[39:44] which you have profaned among the
[39:45] heathen whether you went and i will
[39:47] sanctify my great name which was
[39:49] profaned among the heathen which you
[39:51] have profaned in the midst of them and
[39:53] the heathen shall know that i am the
[39:55] lord saith the lord god when i shall be
[39:57] satisfied in you before their eyes for i
[40:01] will take you from among the heathen and
[40:03] gather you all out of all the countries
[40:05] and will bring you
[40:06] into your own land and i will sprinkle
[40:09] clean water upon you and you shall be
[40:11] clean from all your filthiness and from
[40:13] all your idols will i cleanse you a new
[40:16] heart also will i give you and a new
[40:18] spirit will i put within you and i will
[40:21] take away the stony heart out of your
[40:23] flesh and i will give you a heart of
[40:25] flesh
[40:26] and i will put my spirit within you and
[40:28] cause you to walk in my statues and you
[40:31] shall keep my judgments and do them and
[40:33] you shall dwell on the land that i gave
[40:35] your fathers and you shall be my people
[40:37] and i will be your god i will also save
[40:40] you from all your uncleanness i will
[40:42] call for the corn and will increase it
[40:44] and lay no famine upon you i will
[40:46] multiply the fruit of the tree increase
[40:48] of the field and you shall receive no
[40:50] more reproach of famine among the
[40:52] heathen then shall we remember
[40:54] your own evil ways and your doings that
[40:56] were not good and shall loathe
[40:57] yourselves in your own sight for your
[40:59] iniquities and for your abominations not
[41:02] for your sakes do i do this saith the
[41:04] lord god be it known unto you and be
[41:05] ashamed and confounded for your own ways
[41:07] o house of israel thus saith the lord
[41:10] god and the day that i shall have
[41:11] cleansed you from all your iniquities i
[41:14] will also cause you to dwell in cities
[41:16] and ways shall be built and the desolate
[41:17] land shall be tilled whereas whereas to
[41:20] lay desolate in the sight of all that
[41:22] pass by
[41:23] and they shall say this land that was
[41:25] desolate is become like the garden of
[41:27] eden and the wastes and the desolate and
[41:30] ruined cities or become fenced are
[41:32] inhabited then the heathen that are left
[41:34] round about you shall know that i the
[41:36] lord built the rune places and planted
[41:39] that which was desolate and i the lord
[41:42] has spoken it and i will do it thus
[41:45] saith the lord god i will yet for this
[41:47] be inquired of by the house of israel to
[41:50] do it for them i will increase them with
[41:52] men like a flock
[41:54] as the holy flock as the flock of
[41:56] jerusalem and their solemn feasts
[41:58] so shall the waste cities be filled
[42:01] with flocks of men and they shall know
[42:04] that i
[42:05] am the lord
[42:07] amen so many wonderful things in that
[42:09] scripture you can be seated
[42:14] oh i'd like to speak to you tonight
[42:18] i had a very difficult time finding the
[42:20] title for this because
[42:22] there's so many things to to be able to
[42:24] go in so many directions but
[42:26] i'd like to speak to you on his spirit
[42:29] the main spring
[42:31] his spirit the mainspring and we've been
[42:34] reading about the land of israel and how
[42:36] that how that had become a very desolate
[42:39] place and we we've witnessed that
[42:41] actually in our generation here in the
[42:43] last within the last
[42:45] 100 years or so of how a desolate land
[42:48] would begin to bloom again
[42:50] and a people would come back to that
[42:52] land but you know god's not only
[42:54] interested in a physical land and a
[42:56] physical people he also has a spiritual
[42:59] people and a spiritual land
[43:01] amen and so he his word is there and it
[43:03] will not return into him void and
[43:06] brother branham would pick up about
[43:07] ezekiel and he would say ezekiel was
[43:09] prophesying or he was foretelling what
[43:12] would take place in the age to come not
[43:15] in his age but an age to come
[43:17] he said you know god likens his prophets
[43:19] to eagles that would go in the makeup of
[43:21] a prophet he's a seer and in the spirit
[43:24] he climbs beyond the emotion of the
[43:26] church it goes beyond the rhythm of the
[43:28] music
[43:29] he goes beyond the clapping of the hands
[43:31] he goes beyond the joy among the saints
[43:34] he goes beyond all of that and god
[43:36] brings him to a realm alone then he
[43:39] opens his eyes and he lets him look
[43:41] around and see things that are to come
[43:44] now it might be five minutes five years
[43:46] five months or 50 years or thousands of
[43:49] years but he allows him to see things to
[43:52] come then he brings him back down among
[43:54] the members of his body to be able to
[43:56] foretell of them what is in the making
[43:59] see he said the word of god has been
[44:01] spoken before the foundation of the
[44:03] world it isn't that god speaks and says
[44:06] something to a prophet at that time it's
[44:09] at that time the prophet catches what
[44:12] god has already said
[44:14] and what god has already said god's word
[44:16] will be fulfilled and we've seen as we
[44:19] read that it's very clear that we can
[44:21] look at it in our day and we can see
[44:23] mountains that were desolate lands that
[44:25] were destroyed that are now you know uh
[44:27] has gardens and now has vineyards and
[44:30] and now has a
[44:32] multitude of people upon it and we can
[44:34] see how god
[44:35] how they went into the heathens and went
[44:37] into the other lands and how god began
[44:39] to draw them back to himself and bring
[44:43] them into this place and we can see
[44:44] god's word being fulfilled in our time
[44:47] he says for the word was before the
[44:49] foundation of the world god spoke the
[44:51] word and it's laying way out there
[44:53] stretched out into time and the prophet
[44:56] goes up and sees that time coming so
[44:59] it's a gift of knowledge or a gift of
[45:00] prophecy that he grabs a hold of what's
[45:03] coming and he puts it upon paper and
[45:06] ezekiel the prophet goes out and sees
[45:08] the day that we're living in well he
[45:11] said oh what a trip he took up jacob's
[45:13] ladder to foresee what will be and he
[45:16] brings it back down he puts it on paper
[45:18] and now in the last 2000 years which you
[45:21] know
[45:22] ezekiel lived some 600 to 800 years
[45:24] before christ you know and he begins he
[45:27] says he said they had a stony heart and
[45:29] then the holy ghost could not enter into
[45:32] that heart had no way of entering to
[45:34] their heart because it was a sinful
[45:35] heart it was a stony heart and he said
[45:37] so there had to be a place
[45:39] in time that would come to where the
[45:41] atonement of blood not the atonement of
[45:44] the blood of an animal or or a sheep or
[45:46] a lamb or a goat but the atonement of a
[45:49] blood that was co-equal with a human
[45:52] that could come upon a human's life and
[45:54] so amen zika would actually pick up i'll
[45:58] put a new heart in you i'll put a new
[46:00] spirit in you i'll put my spirit in here
[46:03] that could not happen in the day that
[46:05] ezekiel was living in but it only could
[46:07] happen when the blood sacrifice of the
[46:09] lamb of god would come into time because
[46:12] it already been spoken amen and this
[46:15] word was stretching out into time to
[46:17] where it could be fulfilled and be
[46:19] brought to pass amen and to where now
[46:21] that where that our people could receive
[46:24] a new heart of flesh a new spirit and
[46:27] his spirit amen and so because we know
[46:29] the animal life it has no soul in it so
[46:32] it's like mixing oil and water together
[46:34] don't mix so christ had to come and the
[46:37] blood of christ which was shed at
[46:39] calvary inside that blood cell
[46:42] they knoweth nothing other than the life
[46:44] of god and the worshiper comes before
[46:47] god with this appropriate blood
[46:50] appropriated
[46:52] it is the blood of the redeemer that
[46:54] redeemed us now adam put us in the pawn
[46:57] shop but the blood of christ brought us
[46:59] back out of the pawn shop and he's your
[47:02] redeemer and now
[47:04] you belong to christ
[47:06] through the blood of jesus christ amen
[47:08] it's only in the time that that we now
[47:11] live in now that the
[47:13] heart can be changed it can be given a
[47:15] new heart a heart to believe a heart to
[47:17] receive a heart to understand man we see
[47:20] we you know jesus would even say to the
[47:23] pharisees oh you slow of heart you know
[47:25] slow to understand you're you're seeing
[47:27] things being fulfilled in scripture but
[47:29] you're not seeing them because you have
[47:31] a stony heart
[47:33] but you have to receive a heart that can
[47:35] believe a heart that can receive
[47:37] something from god now you know in in in
[47:40] doing so you become his by his spirit
[47:43] amen so we see and this quote right here
[47:45] just about sent me through the roof he
[47:48] said see and in doing so god gave you to
[47:51] christ as a love gift for his sacrifice
[47:55] and you are brought to christ by the
[47:57] holy spirit
[48:00] who wounds you who wounds you through
[48:02] the blood of the lord jesus to present
[48:05] to him as a gift and god loves his gifts
[48:11] and he will not stand to see them
[48:14] destroyed
[48:16] oh hallelujah amen that gives me great
[48:19] confidence in the time that i'm living
[48:21] in he's wooed me amen he's gave me a
[48:24] heart of flesh he gave me a heart to
[48:26] believe he's he's placed a new spirit in
[48:28] me he's given me his spirit and i've
[48:31] been presented to him as a love gift
[48:35] amen is a love gift and he will he loves
[48:37] his gifts
[48:39] i'm not talking about just the gift of
[48:41] singing and the gift of preaching and he
[48:43] loves his gifts amen his blood bought
[48:46] saints of almighty god has been bought
[48:49] by the blood of the lamb and been placed
[48:51] in this time he loves you
[48:56] hallelujah and because he loves you he
[48:59] will not stand and see you destroyed
[49:03] hallelujah well the destroyer is in the
[49:06] land this destroyer amen the pill horse
[49:09] rider is about to ride and we see things
[49:12] begin to take place as his ride is
[49:14] coming very imminent amen as he starts
[49:17] it and we see it all taking place but
[49:19] the destroyer is in the land but you'll
[49:21] not be destroyed
[49:24] amen because he is here and he loves you
[49:31] well i can't get past that this evening
[49:33] amen you know we need to realize and
[49:35] really think about how god amen has
[49:38] brought you in this time that you're
[49:40] living in and it be his spirit begin to
[49:42] woo over your body
[49:45] begin to wool over your soul and begin
[49:47] to wow over your life and satan had come
[49:50] and it brought every kind of sin upon
[49:52] you and covered you up as it would be
[49:54] concrete over a grass seed but the
[49:57] spirit of god began to draw you it began
[49:59] to woo you it began to call you it began
[50:02] to pull on you amen you was a drunkard
[50:04] you was this you was that but there was
[50:06] something on the inside said this is not
[50:09] who you're supposed to be
[50:11] what was it it was god bringing his love
[50:14] gifts
[50:17] he had seeds there
[50:20] he said one fellow asked another fellow
[50:22] one day said do you believe if a man
[50:25] wants a child of god born of the spirit
[50:28] of god washed in the blood and redeemed
[50:30] thoroughly by god by the renewing of his
[50:32] heart by the washing of the water by the
[50:34] blood through the word and becomes a
[50:36] child of god don't you think that person
[50:38] could sin and get away from god to where
[50:40] he would be lost
[50:41] this man said i'll answer your question
[50:44] when you answer mine
[50:46] do you think that a man can be so good
[50:48] that he could lie
[50:50] still do anything bad but he would be so
[50:53] good that god would receive him into
[50:55] heaven without the blood of christ
[50:57] no
[50:59] then if that's no the others know
[51:02] amen amen you can't be so good
[51:06] that you're going to make it it ain't
[51:08] because you was born in a certain family
[51:10] or are born in the south i'm talking
[51:12] about earthly family prince family uh
[51:15] ledale family whatever family you want
[51:17] to be amen adam's family always be
[51:19] family whatever family that's not what
[51:22] gave you the the ability to be his gift
[51:26] what give you if god gives you the right
[51:28] to be his gift is god put a seed on the
[51:31] inside of you
[51:33] and he began to call upon you and it
[51:35] began to woo upon you amen and you begin
[51:38] to give love back to him
[51:42] amen
[51:44] he says see no of course not you could
[51:46] not go to heaven without the blood of
[51:48] the lord jesus no matter how good you
[51:50] are that would be self-made
[51:52] righteousness no matter how good you are
[51:55] it's totally impossible for you to get
[51:57] to heaven on your goodness
[51:59] so let's put our goodness on a tree
[52:00] somewhere it's the mercy of god that
[52:04] brought you at calvary
[52:07] hallelujah it's the mercy of god that
[52:10] bought you at calvary
[52:13] and you were god's love gift to christ
[52:17] and if god gave a gift to christ christ
[52:21] keeps his gift
[52:24] so not only is he going to make sure
[52:25] you're not going to be restored
[52:27] destroyed he keeps you
[52:30] that's why he would say when he all that
[52:32] comes to me and all the father has given
[52:34] me will come and none of them will be
[52:36] lost but i'll raise them up in the last
[52:39] days
[52:40] so he's not brought you to this place to
[52:43] watch you up in the trash and throw you
[52:45] away but he keeps his gift
[52:48] [Applause]
[52:51] listen i understand how it is we live in
[52:53] a land of you know
[52:55] especially compared to other worlds amen
[52:57] are plenty and you get gifts for
[52:58] christmas and you might like it it's a
[53:00] new toy and you know it's the greatest
[53:02] thing and and since sliced bread your
[53:04] mama or daddy fought through every kind
[53:06] of thing to find it for you because you
[53:08] just had to have it and you got this
[53:10] gift and you played with it for a few
[53:12] days and the next thing it's an old hat
[53:15] don't matter no more it stays in the
[53:16] closet
[53:18] finally your mom gets tired of looking
[53:19] at it and she puts it in a yard sale and
[53:21] she gets rid of it
[53:23] and one day you loved it and the next
[53:24] day you don't
[53:26] may take months it may take years amen
[53:28] but you you have those things amen every
[53:30] one of us does
[53:32] amen amen that's not the way god is with
[53:35] his gifts
[53:36] [Music]
[53:38] he didn't receive you one day and down
[53:40] the road decided i don't want you no
[53:42] more
[53:43] he didn't receive you at one time and
[53:45] say you know what i've changed my mind
[53:46] about you i'm putting you back in the
[53:48] pawn shop no sir if he had you in his
[53:51] mind and you was his gift given to him
[53:54] for his sacrifice you will always be his
[53:58] gift
[54:02] he keeps his gifts
[54:06] hallelujah
[54:08] now he said you know you said brother
[54:10] brown will say it like this you might be
[54:11] emotionally worked up you might have all
[54:14] through your hands speak with tongues
[54:15] dance in the spirit join the church some
[54:18] of the other things fantastics of today
[54:20] you know and you could be
[54:22] lost have all of that be lost
[54:25] but if your love god's love gift to
[54:28] christ
[54:29] you are safe
[54:35] if you are god's love gift to christ
[54:38] you are safe
[54:42] your life will prove who you are by
[54:45] their fruits you shall know it if you're
[54:47] trying to make yourself act sweet
[54:50] make yourself be humble
[54:52] you're still outside the kingdom it's
[54:54] not your own works
[54:56] he said that's where the church is the
[54:58] people so-called the church has failed
[55:00] so miserably because it's their own
[55:02] personal work that they feel that they
[55:04] met by their own personal work they feel
[55:06] they merit the goodness and the grace of
[55:08] god but what they do and how they live
[55:10] that's not one thing to do with it it is
[55:13] the gift of god
[55:17] your own conscience to shun you from
[55:18] hell would try to make you
[55:20] uh your which that would you would shun
[55:23] from hell rather will try to make you
[55:24] live good and be right and be a good
[55:27] citizen
[55:28] you know there's good citizens as not
[55:30] actually not necessarily christians
[55:34] i've seen people who called themselves
[55:36] christians wasn't good citizens
[55:39] amen
[55:40] but also it's a flip-flop you know a
[55:43] good christian a good citizen
[55:45] is not necessarily a christian
[55:48] might be a good person might have some
[55:49] good morals might have some good things
[55:51] he said i've seen many people who's even
[55:54] denied the name of the lord jesus
[55:56] we're fine people
[55:59] oh it's humanly speaking look how much
[56:02] more better was a man esau than jacob
[56:06] but he didn't have the conception to
[56:07] know that he's when he sold his
[56:09] birthright
[56:10] he despised it
[56:12] and when he sold it he was despised and
[56:14] rejected of god
[56:17] but he was far more gentleman a neighbor
[56:19] a man of works than what jacob was jacob
[56:22] was a deceiver he was a planner he
[56:25] deceived people
[56:26] but he saw a gentleman in every respect
[56:29] but jacob had recompense or he had a
[56:32] respect to the birthright
[56:35] he wanted the birthright more than he
[56:36] wanted anything else
[56:40] that's pretty much the calling card for
[56:42] who a real christian is somebody who
[56:44] wants to birth right more than anything
[56:47] else
[56:48] somebody that wants the birthright more
[56:50] than their closet to be the new thing
[56:53] somebody wants to birthright more than
[56:55] their outward appearance to be the up
[56:57] the ups and this and that and the other
[56:58] they want god more than anything
[57:03] amen
[57:04] or they call him a holy roller and
[57:06] fanatic whatever they wish to but he had
[57:08] respect to the birthright that was his
[57:10] whole motive that was his whole wants
[57:12] that whatever it cost him he wanted the
[57:15] birthright
[57:17] but he said you know many people he said
[57:20] if the body of christ was controlled by
[57:22] intellectuals or theology or mental
[57:24] conceptions then we're wholly dependent
[57:27] upon the intellectual knowledge of man
[57:31] he said if the church only rests upon
[57:33] the intellectual
[57:35] upon your abilities that's what the
[57:37] intellectual is upon your abilities and
[57:39] what you think and you know we built
[57:41] this great thing and flushed seats and
[57:43] thousand dollar pipe organs and and how
[57:45] he could preach his message in such a
[57:47] way that would get people to church and
[57:49] join a church and more members on the
[57:51] book
[57:52] he said i want you to get this and never
[57:55] let it slip
[57:57] so that sounds something pretty
[57:58] important
[57:59] if we only need the intellectual
[58:01] conception of man
[58:03] we don't need the holy ghost
[58:08] said if the church is to be run and
[58:10] governor about governed upon intellects
[58:12] and educational programs and upon the
[58:15] intellects of a man of mankind we do not
[58:18] need the holy spirit
[58:21] but if it's to be run by the holy spirit
[58:25] we don't need the intellectuals
[58:26] [Music]
[58:28] that's the prophet of god's words it's
[58:30] either one or the other
[58:33] amen
[58:34] oh my amen so we got to have something
[58:37] on the inside a mainspring
[58:40] amen see the smarter the man would be
[58:42] the more intellectual he's had the more
[58:43] schooling he got the better grammar he
[58:45] would be the better off the people are
[58:47] the better off the church is if he can
[58:49] present the program and say well they
[58:51] said what is that he said that is
[58:52] nothing but mental emotion
[58:56] he said if we can present the program
[58:58] and say now we'll build a great church
[59:00] we'll call it a certain name we'll
[59:02] attract the attention of the people all
[59:04] through the city when we play chimes
[59:06] every sunday morning on our spire we'll
[59:08] attract the attention of the poor lost
[59:10] center in the gutter when he sees we
[59:12] wear better clothes and when we offer
[59:14] him food and we offer him this
[59:17] and we wear nice hats
[59:19] we'll present this to the people and and
[59:21] see what and we'll show them the desires
[59:23] of of what a woman ought to be in a man
[59:26] how nice we ought to wear and how suits
[59:28] ought to be just right our dresses ought
[59:30] to be our cars ought to be great what we
[59:32] ride in
[59:33] how we stand in social abilities and and
[59:36] the city and and you know we're able to
[59:38] bring this one in and bring that he said
[59:40] if that's god's program they're right
[59:44] he said but jesus never quoted it that
[59:46] way
[59:47] he said if i be lifted up
[59:51] not the church not what we can do not
[59:53] our abilities but if christ can be
[59:55] lifted up he said so through the whole
[59:57] world educational program he said it's
[1:00:00] all right if you don't he said that's
[1:00:02] all right if you don't leave this house
[1:00:04] he said but man is not drawn to christ
[1:00:06] by intellectuals or by theology
[1:00:10] the holy spirit alone is god's drawing
[1:00:13] power
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:16] oh hallelujah amen you know it's not the
[1:00:18] dre it's not there be people get a man i
[1:00:21] i met somebody just up there when he was
[1:00:22] built was looking to build that uh
[1:00:24] gymnasium out there the you know for the
[1:00:27] youth youth building there and uh
[1:00:30] we went up to spring hill and was
[1:00:31] talking with the because the builder had
[1:00:33] sent us up there to look at a building
[1:00:34] he had built previously
[1:00:36] and she's like well what what what do
[1:00:38] you need one of those for you got young
[1:00:40] people
[1:00:41] i said yeah
[1:00:42] we got your own people
[1:00:44] she said well how many you have and i
[1:00:46] said uh probably enough about 40 to 60
[1:00:49] or so and then several
[1:00:52] several about the same in sunday school
[1:00:54] and
[1:00:54] and more coming and she just kind of
[1:00:56] looked at me with a wild eye and stare
[1:00:58] it's like
[1:00:59] what are you doing to get those young
[1:01:01] people there
[1:01:03] she said we've tried everything
[1:01:09] you know i i i'll say this brother josh
[1:01:11] bennett you know was in in the middle of
[1:01:13] uh building starting to build a church
[1:01:15] and he had to be in a gymnasium because
[1:01:17] they've you know through you know it's
[1:01:18] amazing through covert his church has
[1:01:20] outgrown his church
[1:01:22] so he had to move to a gymnasium and
[1:01:24] they'd been renting this gymnasium from
[1:01:25] a wesleyan methodist church and
[1:01:28] and they all of a sudden on sundays they
[1:01:30] saw this gymnasium full of people two
[1:01:32] three four hundred people i don't know
[1:01:34] it was full of folks
[1:01:36] and and and brother josh was hoping
[1:01:38] maybe that they would sell the place to
[1:01:39] him because they'd only had a few
[1:01:40] members
[1:01:42] and then and and so he went and
[1:01:43] approached him and said look we'd like
[1:01:45] to buy this if y'all if y'all want to
[1:01:47] sell it they said oh no we see what
[1:01:49] you're doing
[1:01:50] we're going to get us a young preacher
[1:01:55] and we're going to we're going to have
[1:01:57] it in that gymnasium
[1:01:59] and we're going to get our music program
[1:02:00] right so we'll be able to have church
[1:02:02] like that
[1:02:04] they're missing the whole point
[1:02:06] it ain't the preacher it's christ
[1:02:08] [Applause]
[1:02:11] amen it ain't the building it's christ
[1:02:14] for months that gymnasium said empty and
[1:02:16] was growing cobwebs but you get christ
[1:02:19] in there
[1:02:21] you get god moving in there in the
[1:02:23] spirit of god he said i will draw all
[1:02:25] men unto me
[1:02:28] listen we don't have young people
[1:02:30] because we got a program or even because
[1:02:32] we got a place for them to play some
[1:02:34] basketball we have young people because
[1:02:36] there's families and pastors and
[1:02:38] preachers that preach jesus christ
[1:02:42] and they lift him up out of history and
[1:02:44] say he's not a god of the past but he
[1:02:46] can be your god too
[1:02:49] he's not just your daddy's god but he
[1:02:51] can be your god too he can change your
[1:02:53] life just like he changed him pruitt he
[1:02:56] can change every life in here
[1:02:59] it's not a program it's christ
[1:03:07] the holy spirit alone is god's drawing
[1:03:10] power
[1:03:16] he said see it's the scripture he that
[1:03:18] exalts himself shall be a base he that
[1:03:20] humbles himself that'll be exalted
[1:03:23] he said they got that upside down
[1:03:24] they're trying to get men into a church
[1:03:27] by intellectual speeches
[1:03:29] he said we do not need intellectual
[1:03:31] speeches
[1:03:33] there's a prophet of god we don't need
[1:03:36] intellectual speeches but it's the
[1:03:38] baptism of the holy spirit with power
[1:03:40] and demonstrations and manifestations of
[1:03:43] the spirit that is what we need to bring
[1:03:45] men to the church
[1:03:47] it is the drawing unction of the holy
[1:03:49] spirit
[1:03:51] he said schools and seminaries are fine
[1:03:54] have nothing against them but that's not
[1:03:55] god's
[1:03:56] program amen god chose the ignorant and
[1:04:00] the illiterate man who couldn't speak
[1:04:02] well there was plenty of people that had
[1:04:03] education he could have got
[1:04:06] there had been plenty that had a
[1:04:07] doctrine of divinity and pharisees he
[1:04:10] could have pulled from but he pulled
[1:04:12] from a poor fisherman couldn't hardly
[1:04:14] write their name if they could at all
[1:04:16] amen he pulled from the illiterate they
[1:04:18] couldn't speak they couldn't read and
[1:04:20] the bible said they were ignorant and
[1:04:21] unlearned but they had been for to a far
[1:04:24] better school
[1:04:27] for when they healed a man at the gate
[1:04:29] called beautiful they took the knowledge
[1:04:32] they learned at that school up on the up
[1:04:34] in the upper room
[1:04:37] that they had been with jesus
[1:04:40] and people around them had to realize
[1:04:43] and take knowledge these men had been
[1:04:45] with jesus because they're doing exactly
[1:04:47] what jesus did
[1:04:51] and people want to say they've been with
[1:04:53] jesus and they don't believe in healings
[1:04:54] and they don't believe in deliverances
[1:04:56] and they don't believe in salvation
[1:04:58] anymore and they don't believe they say
[1:05:00] days of miracles are past you ain't been
[1:05:02] with jesus
[1:05:03] you've been in the intellectual realms
[1:05:07] explaining all the way the same
[1:05:08] intellectual realms the serpent operated
[1:05:11] out of
[1:05:18] said this be an intellectual type of the
[1:05:19] churches that we have today in america
[1:05:21] and all over the world
[1:05:23] we get to that type of school
[1:05:25] then the christian the believer the
[1:05:26] church may be reading the bible sees
[1:05:28] he must try to act humble he must try to
[1:05:30] be this way
[1:05:32] he said what they do is they begin to
[1:05:34] become carnal impersonations he said let
[1:05:36] that soak deep a carnal comparison
[1:05:39] trying to act something that he really
[1:05:40] isn't in his heart
[1:05:42] in his heart he's thinking in one way
[1:05:44] and is trying to act another
[1:05:47] he said in genuine language that's a
[1:05:49] hypocrite
[1:05:52] jesus said you hypocrites how can you
[1:05:53] speak good things for out of the
[1:05:55] abundance of the heart speaketh the
[1:05:57] mouth the heart the mouth speaketh if
[1:06:00] you don't speak according to what's in
[1:06:01] your heart your heart thinks one thing
[1:06:03] and you speak another that makes you a
[1:06:05] hypocrite i mean the very word pharisee
[1:06:08] means actor they acted out their
[1:06:10] religion but they had a stony heart
[1:06:14] they acted out that they believed it but
[1:06:16] inside they really didn't
[1:06:22] they came to jesus said good master we'd
[1:06:24] like to see a sign
[1:06:26] well just how many signs do you need
[1:06:30] he doesn't raise the dead
[1:06:32] he didn't open the blind to the eyes of
[1:06:34] the blood even a blind man saw him
[1:06:41] and jesus would say
[1:06:43] how can you call me good
[1:06:46] there's none good but god
[1:06:47] said the weak and the adulterous
[1:06:49] generation seeks for a sign but there'll
[1:06:51] be a sign given as jonah was in the
[1:06:54] belly of the well three days and night
[1:06:55] so the son of man will be in the heart
[1:06:58] of the earth three days and three nights
[1:06:59] and they saw that fulfilled
[1:07:02] and still couldn't figure it out with
[1:07:04] their intellectual ideas
[1:07:06] still tried to explain it all away
[1:07:09] say it didn't happen that was just a
[1:07:10] made-up story by some guards because
[1:07:12] they didn't want to lose their life
[1:07:15] the disciples come and stole the body
[1:07:17] away he still they wouldn't put him
[1:07:18] somewhere else
[1:07:20] intellectual ideas
[1:07:23] and of course if they they would have
[1:07:24] had youtube back there that had all
[1:07:26] their videos on about the end too
[1:07:30] about how this ain't so and how that
[1:07:32] ain't so and i got this figured out and
[1:07:33] i got that figured out and you wasn't
[1:07:35] even there
[1:07:37] if you'd have been there you'd have saw
[1:07:38] the angel come down and the stone rolled
[1:07:41] away and the guards fall as dead people
[1:07:44] and a man who'd been in the grave three
[1:07:45] nights amen well three days walk out
[1:07:52] that's what really irritates me about
[1:07:54] these these youtube
[1:07:56] wannabe peoples whatever you want to
[1:07:58] call them i don't know what you want to
[1:07:59] call them heretics is what they are
[1:08:01] blasphemers
[1:08:03] bound for hell is what they are
[1:08:06] they get up and they want to say what
[1:08:07] happened back in the 60s and the 50s and
[1:08:10] what didn't happen and line it all up
[1:08:12] and have it all figured out and they got
[1:08:13] it all and it wasn't even there
[1:08:17] and they want me to believe you again
[1:08:19] you wasn't even there
[1:08:22] i mean let's go out here and let's go to
[1:08:23] this witness you know hear a big crash
[1:08:25] out there
[1:08:26] and you know i just sorry brother and i
[1:08:28] used brother aaron
[1:08:30] he's good at putting words together
[1:08:33] telling stories
[1:08:36] he wouldn't hear a big crash and he runs
[1:08:38] out there and he tells the cop well this
[1:08:40] car was coming this way and this car was
[1:08:41] coming this way and this one swerved
[1:08:43] over here and that one come over there
[1:08:44] and bam they hit right there it was this
[1:08:46] person's fault
[1:08:48] and he wasn't there
[1:08:50] it's no different than what they're
[1:08:52] doing on youtube videos
[1:08:55] well they did this and that happened
[1:08:56] over here and they're they're putting
[1:08:58] their own intellectual ideas into it and
[1:09:00] expecting me to believe it
[1:09:06] but i got a different heart
[1:09:13] they try to place this new program this
[1:09:15] new deal god has with the church that
[1:09:17] was presented to pentecost
[1:09:20] not an intellectual at all
[1:09:22] when intellectualism at all
[1:09:25] it was 120 fishermen tent makers and
[1:09:28] housewives housewives went up into the
[1:09:30] upper room and waited until god's
[1:09:32] prophecy was fulfilled and they received
[1:09:35] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:37] jesus told them stop you preaching don't
[1:09:39] go any further don't do any more go up
[1:09:41] and wait in the city called jerusalem
[1:09:43] until you endue with power from on high
[1:09:46] not to you receive your ba or your daddy
[1:09:49] or your phd or your psychology degree
[1:09:53] you can you become an intellectual
[1:09:54] teacher
[1:09:56] but wait until you get your diploma
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:02] not wait until
[1:10:04] but not wait until you get a degree but
[1:10:06] wait until you endure with power
[1:10:11] from on high
[1:10:13] not from a school but from on high then
[1:10:16] you shall be my witnesses in jerusalem
[1:10:19] and judea and samaria to the uttermost
[1:10:21] parts of the earth his last commission
[1:10:23] to all the world preached the gospel
[1:10:30] and we want to change it
[1:10:33] we get icicles and put them in the
[1:10:35] pulpit
[1:10:36] and they give a little intellectual
[1:10:37] speech
[1:10:39] and you're supposed to receive it by
[1:10:40] receiving it you receive the baptism of
[1:10:42] the holy ghost
[1:10:46] that's not how they did it on the day of
[1:10:48] pentecost
[1:10:50] on the day of pentecost it was the
[1:10:51] rushing mighty wind it was a wooing of
[1:10:54] the holy ghost upon lives and seeds that
[1:10:56] were sitting there amen until fire could
[1:10:59] fall upon a seed and it burst into life
[1:11:03] it wasn't given by peter giving an
[1:11:05] intellectual speech
[1:11:07] it was given by the power of the holy
[1:11:09] ghost
[1:11:13] and in my name you'll cast out devils
[1:11:16] and speak with new tongues
[1:11:18] you drink any deadly tank or take up a
[1:11:20] serpent it won't harm you and they shall
[1:11:22] lay hands upon the sick they shall
[1:11:24] recover
[1:11:26] that was to be the sign of the believer
[1:11:29] that was to be the sign of the believer
[1:11:31] instead of educated intellectualism
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:40] now
[1:11:41] god was going to make a new church
[1:11:44] so he's going to put a new heart in
[1:11:45] there
[1:11:46] and a new spirit in there
[1:11:48] he wasn't just going to give it a
[1:11:49] facelift
[1:11:51] and it'd be the same old church no it
[1:11:54] wasn't going to be a hot the old heart
[1:11:55] just polished up it's going to be a new
[1:11:58] heart
[1:11:59] i'm going to take that old stoney heart
[1:12:00] away but i'm going to put a new heart in
[1:12:02] there he said what was it it was an act
[1:12:04] of grace
[1:12:06] it was god placing something inside of
[1:12:08] there to be able to receive something
[1:12:10] from him
[1:12:12] amen so i'll take the old heart out i'll
[1:12:14] put the flesh your heart in you say see
[1:12:16] he said he would do that you can't put
[1:12:18] that in an old intellectual church
[1:12:23] and he said that's the reason why
[1:12:24] america is in the condition you won't
[1:12:26] know why america's in the condition is
[1:12:28] today because it's been calloused with
[1:12:31] an old intellectual idea
[1:12:34] that's the reason that is go forth and
[1:12:36] every person signs papers and because
[1:12:38] they are now a member of a certain
[1:12:40] church and so forth for a little
[1:12:41] hollywood revival that's coming and all
[1:12:43] them come out with glamour girls and
[1:12:45] boys and put out their little programs
[1:12:47] and when they leave they go back and
[1:12:48] find out about 90 of that accepted
[1:12:51] christ as savior they're not there
[1:12:53] anymore what's the matter it wasn't a
[1:12:55] revival
[1:12:57] it was an intellectual illusion
[1:13:01] mercy
[1:13:02] it only presented something as the
[1:13:04] american people would clap their hands
[1:13:07] and ho and the hollywood television
[1:13:09] articles would come out and the pulpit
[1:13:11] you know had been
[1:13:13] replaced by a hollywood fashion box and
[1:13:15] when the old-fashioned gospel preacher
[1:13:17] used to drink wash sister and water and
[1:13:19] preach all night by lamp light it's
[1:13:22] changed
[1:13:23] but we changed it and that's why we got
[1:13:26] the intellectual group that we got now
[1:13:30] because we have changed what was given
[1:13:32] to the original church
[1:13:38] and that's how
[1:13:39] and he said that's how you're ever
[1:13:41] are you ever in the place where every
[1:13:43] home is now televised with who loves
[1:13:45] lucy and all these other ungodly
[1:13:48] programs over the air and television
[1:13:50] such that how we ever going to present
[1:13:51] this new gospel the way that christ told
[1:13:54] us to do and to such as that
[1:13:56] if the mind still remains carnal it'll
[1:13:58] run through fantastics and fanaticism
[1:14:01] it'll
[1:14:02] bypass the word of god and run off in
[1:14:04] oil droppings and everything he said how
[1:14:06] are you going to stop it the bible said
[1:14:07] it would be that way
[1:14:09] and god said it would be that way the
[1:14:11] intellectual the whole lady they give
[1:14:13] her you know they give her a facelift
[1:14:14] but she's still the same old woman hey
[1:14:16] old man they give him a facelift but
[1:14:18] he's still just the same old man oh i'll
[1:14:20] turn a new page i'll i'll start a new
[1:14:22] life i'll throw away my pipe
[1:14:25] i'll throw away my beer i'll clean out
[1:14:27] my refrigerator but still the same old
[1:14:29] man
[1:14:30] and years later go right back to it
[1:14:34] why because they never received him
[1:14:38] oh sure they'll get up behind it and say
[1:14:40] well i always had it and i never you
[1:14:42] know a person can fall make all their
[1:14:43] excuses in the world but they never had
[1:14:45] it in the first place
[1:14:51] it ain't a face lifting
[1:14:54] we're not interested in giving you a
[1:14:55] facelift
[1:14:58] we're not interested i i i
[1:14:59] this group is one of the only groups
[1:15:01] left so it's a reason why i use them
[1:15:03] we're not interested in making you like
[1:15:05] a mennonite or amish
[1:15:07] because you have a certain dress and you
[1:15:09] you do a certain thing and and you
[1:15:13] i'm a message believer
[1:15:19] that's not a life that's a lifestyle
[1:15:25] hey i know i it don't work
[1:15:28] i was just telling somebody other than
[1:15:30] the paris family the other night me and
[1:15:32] sister ruth was on a cruise here if our
[1:15:34] only cruise we've ever been on brother
[1:15:35] george sister trish we decided to go on
[1:15:37] an excursion we wanted this horse ride
[1:15:39] out into the out into the uh uh
[1:15:42] plantation but i think it was a banana
[1:15:44] plantation and then i was going to take
[1:15:46] a ride in the ocean on the horses really
[1:15:48] really really interesting in jamaica
[1:15:50] when we first got on the boat we noticed
[1:15:52] this amish couple that was walking
[1:15:53] around and would you know it we got on
[1:15:55] the bus to go to our excursion and right
[1:15:57] in front of us on the seat in front of
[1:15:59] us was this amish couple of course that
[1:16:01] puts my wife's radars out because she
[1:16:03] can understand what they're saying
[1:16:05] and she finally says something to them
[1:16:07] and they do it
[1:16:09] scared them to death
[1:16:12] and so
[1:16:13] if we go on this horse ride they move
[1:16:15] away from us they don't have nothing to
[1:16:17] do with us they don't want to be around
[1:16:18] us and they go on going about their
[1:16:20] business and we go on this horse ride
[1:16:22] ride through this plantation along the
[1:16:24] coastline come back around they change
[1:16:26] the saddles out and they say all right
[1:16:28] we're going to go in the ocean listen
[1:16:29] these two amish people went into some
[1:16:31] changing rooms and there wasn't ever

[1:16:47] amish people came back out
[1:16:50] listen we're not interested in that
[1:16:52] we're not interested walking in here and
[1:16:54] you're you're a message believer and
[1:16:56] you're going out and you're not
[1:16:59] this ain't a changing room that you can
[1:17:00] just drop clothes and put on clothes and
[1:17:03] drop ideas and put on ideas this is a
[1:17:06] birthing room

[1:17:25] the spirit of god fall on you and you'll
[1:17:27] walk out like never before never to be
[1:17:30] the same again

[1:17:40] sunday or on especially easter listen
[1:17:43] we're not interested in that that's a
[1:17:45] facelift
[1:17:48] it just
[1:17:50] it's just painting an old
[1:17:53] if i could say it like this an old barn
[1:17:55] you just paint it up and it looks all
[1:17:56] pretty but inside it's ate up by
[1:17:59] termites
[1:18:01] it's ate up and boards are decaying and
[1:18:03] it's about to fall in that's what a
[1:18:05] facelift is god's not interested in a
[1:18:08] facelift he's interested in a new
[1:18:10] creation
[1:18:12] that your own life has done away with
[1:18:14] and a new life has begun
[1:18:23] he said now you can't preach that in the
[1:18:25] old church
[1:18:26] so you ain't gonna stand that
[1:18:30] jesus said it in luke about the fifth
[1:18:32] chapter about the wine and bottles
[1:18:34] he said you can't put new wine in old
[1:18:36] bottles
[1:18:37] if you do they'll burst they'll perish
[1:18:40] he said that used to wonder me about a
[1:18:42] little bit he said i used to start on my
[1:18:44] boy's mind when i got to think how could
[1:18:46] a bottle perish
[1:18:47] when you call the bottle being old makes
[1:18:49] no difference because it's glass
[1:18:52] but in jesus time he was speaking about
[1:18:54] bottles that were not glass that were
[1:18:56] made out of animal hide
[1:18:59] and animal eye had to be tanned and
[1:19:01] when it was new and young it was been
[1:19:03] tanned it was flexible
[1:19:05] but when it got old it got dry and dried
[1:19:07] up
[1:19:09] he said many of you people know what a
[1:19:10] hide is when it gets dry
[1:19:12] it's all shrunk up and it's real hard
[1:19:16] yep i've seen them in churches
[1:19:18] oh old drunkard
[1:19:20] shrunk i ain't even talking about their
[1:19:22] age i'm talking about their spiritual
[1:19:24] age
[1:19:26] amen old and dry and all shrunk up and
[1:19:28] real hard
[1:19:30] but they're believers i tell you but the
[1:19:32] spirit of god can move and they'll sit
[1:19:34] there as stone as they can be
[1:19:38] why because they become dried up
[1:19:43] he said if you put new wine in that it
[1:19:45] hasn't got no life to it'll burst
[1:19:48] he said just like the priests of baptism
[1:19:50] the holy ghost and the real genuine
[1:19:51] power of the resurrection is trying to
[1:19:53] place that in before the people when you
[1:19:55] do what happens if you put it in that
[1:19:58] new wine's got life
[1:20:00] hello somebody that new wine's got life
[1:20:03] that new wine is still firming
[1:20:06] it's still moving it's still it's still
[1:20:08] flexing it's still it's still uh
[1:20:11] something's happening bubbling up on the
[1:20:12] inside he said if it's put in a new
[1:20:14] flexible bottle then the old of the
[1:20:17] animal is still in the skin when the new
[1:20:19] wine goes to pushing out that skin will
[1:20:22] stretch
[1:20:24] it'll move with it
[1:20:25] otherwise when the bible said jesus
[1:20:27] christ is the same yesterday the day and
[1:20:30] forever that new skin will stretch out
[1:20:32] it'll say amen
[1:20:35] yes lord and when the new one said that
[1:20:38] is the baptism of the holy spirit i am
[1:20:40] the life of god that's working in you
[1:20:43] that new skin will stretch out and it'll
[1:20:46] say amen
[1:20:49] oh hallelujah when the new wine says
[1:20:52] that the holy ghost is sufficient for
[1:20:54] your healing today that new wine will
[1:20:56] stretch itself out inside of that old
[1:20:58] bottle and that bottle will stretch out
[1:21:00] and say amen
[1:21:06] well what will the old bottle do
[1:21:08] days and miracles are passed
[1:21:12] it's gone
[1:21:14] the season we're not in the season of
[1:21:16] miracles you old dried up cowhide
[1:21:25] he said it's almost like casting your
[1:21:27] pearls before swine
[1:21:29] when you're trying to put new wine in
[1:21:31] old bottles
[1:21:33] this is why he said i have to take that
[1:21:34] stony heart out and put a new heart
[1:21:38] that'll move
[1:21:39] a new spirit i receive
[1:21:42] he said see
[1:21:44] christ doesn't anoint ministers to
[1:21:46] preach
[1:21:47] the gospel
[1:21:49] just to have it return back void
[1:21:55] he expects you to receive the word
[1:22:00] hello somebody
[1:22:02] he expects there to be some new bottles
[1:22:05] and the wine is poured out on a sunday
[1:22:08] morning or wednesday night or whatever
[1:22:10] day of the week it is and those bottles
[1:22:12] begin to stretch out and say yes lord
[1:22:15] be it unto me lord it's my promise god
[1:22:19] i'm accepting it for me lord i'm not i'm
[1:22:21] not quenching the spirit god i'm moving
[1:22:24] in the presence of god i'm moving when
[1:22:26] he says move i'm moving when he says go
[1:22:29] i'm not going to sit on my path and my
[1:22:31] past laws and what i did last sunday or
[1:22:34] what happened last revival but when the
[1:22:36] spirit of god moves i'm a new bottle and
[1:22:39] that wine begins to pour out and the
[1:22:41] bubbling starts taking place and
[1:22:43] something has to go
[1:22:46] because this new water this new wine has
[1:22:49] life in it
[1:22:52] it's not some dried-out dry confession
[1:22:55] or some creed or dogma it's life with
[1:22:58] put his word with power in it
[1:23:01] he expects you to receive the word
[1:23:04] and in receiving the word
[1:23:06] be ready
[1:23:09] oh my my take that old cowhide you've
[1:23:12] been living in over there in that old
[1:23:14] formal condition and swap it off with
[1:23:16] some sheepskin that's flexible
[1:23:20] come on now
[1:23:22] hello somebody
[1:23:25] can i be real personable
[1:23:31] it's dangerous
[1:23:33] but i mean i heard
[1:23:35] a couple of sundays ago there was about
[1:23:37] nine or ten of you and said you know
[1:23:38] what the spirit of god moved across me
[1:23:41] and i didn't move
[1:23:45] well if i was you and i say lord oh my
[1:23:47] cow hide up
[1:23:51] make it more stretchable
[1:23:53] that when you come by i won't say no
[1:23:55] ever again
[1:23:58] that when you come by i won't i won't
[1:24:00] quench the spirit of god i won't sit
[1:24:02] down on what you want to do but i'll say
[1:24:05] yes lord
[1:24:06] i'll say yes lord i'll open myself up to
[1:24:09] you to your will and to your way to the
[1:24:11] movement of the spirit of god
[1:24:15] brother brown would equate this the same
[1:24:16] to that old burnover amen that burned
[1:24:18] over those old stags and that new that
[1:24:20] new growth underneath that was moving
[1:24:22] with a spirit and one one saying is
[1:24:24] fanaticism the other rejoicing one
[1:24:27] saying is a much emotional workup the
[1:24:29] other rejoicing
[1:24:31] and he said it was the same wind
[1:24:34] one making one howl and moan and the
[1:24:36] other rejoice
[1:24:39] mercy
[1:24:41] he said it must come
[1:24:44] for the new wine
[1:24:47] the new wine only ferments new wine
[1:24:50] it only verifies that the elements are
[1:24:52] there the yeast
[1:24:54] presses forth the bulb of the alcohol
[1:24:56] listen
[1:24:57] if all you got was a drink of
[1:25:00] whatever i don't know what to use here
[1:25:02] water is good but
[1:25:04] just just a good drink of water
[1:25:09] it don't it don't bring forth more life
[1:25:11] in the sense of wine expands itself
[1:25:15] there's a bubbling there's a
[1:25:16] almost a multiple multiplication if i
[1:25:19] could say it that way and it begins to
[1:25:21] move and it goes into every fiber and
[1:25:24] every place
[1:25:26] to where the holy ghost has direction
[1:25:27] over every portion of your life
[1:25:33] amen
[1:25:35] it bubbles
[1:25:37] it makes it
[1:25:38] perfect makes it is it because what is
[1:25:41] it doing that yeast is bubbling in there
[1:25:43] it says making that wine taste better
[1:25:46] it's giving it a better substantial
[1:25:48] holding it's making it stronger it's
[1:25:50] making it so it can't sour
[1:25:55] man he puts in such beautiful language
[1:25:57] is it when the leaven of the
[1:25:59] human element has been brought into the
[1:26:01] new wine seeks to burst the bubble that
[1:26:03] spreads forth its strength of alcohol it
[1:26:06] shows from the old church from that
[1:26:08] church all the worldly elements and it
[1:26:10] preserves the church he said grace grape
[1:26:12] juice that's a good eye that's a good
[1:26:14] one grape juice will sour in 24 hours
[1:26:17] but wine never sours
[1:26:21] because the germ of life and the wine is
[1:26:23] fermenting it's pushing it's sterilizing
[1:26:27] it's going forward it's moving out it's
[1:26:29] coming out it's going out that's why it
[1:26:32] can only be put in new pentecostal
[1:26:36] bottles
[1:26:38] it can't be put in lutheran bottles it
[1:26:40] can't be put in some denominational
[1:26:42] creed it can't be put in some of your
[1:26:44] your own ideas it can only be put in the
[1:26:47] same bottles that worked on the day of
[1:26:50] pentecost
[1:26:51] [Applause]
[1:26:53] god had 120 up there gathered in the
[1:26:56] upper room and he'd all them with his
[1:26:58] word it softened them up and he renewed
[1:27:01] them and got all that orthodox out of
[1:27:03] them and that old system out of them and
[1:27:05] he had 120 bottles laying there with
[1:27:08] their necks up in a funnel on top
[1:27:11] hey that's a good way for a bottle to
[1:27:13] come to church
[1:27:16] don't come to church with your stopper
[1:27:17] on
[1:27:20] and you're stopping at everything and
[1:27:21] you're stopping this and you're stopping
[1:27:23] don't take the stopper out
[1:27:26] and then put a funnel in there make it a
[1:27:28] little bit bigger area for the holy
[1:27:30] spirit to hit and he can fill your life
[1:27:32] even more you say well brother timothy i
[1:27:34] received the holy ghost 20 years ago you
[1:27:36] still need more wine
[1:27:38] you need to take another drink again you
[1:27:41] need to get another dip in the holy
[1:27:42] ghost again amen it's not one filler
[1:27:45] it's many real feelings
[1:27:50] hallelujah it's time we come with our
[1:27:53] cups up
[1:28:03] he said he got them all renewed
[1:28:06] and they had their necks up in a funnel
[1:28:07] on top
[1:28:08] and when the holy spirit began to raise
[1:28:11] these bottles got so alive until they
[1:28:14] run outside preaching the gospel
[1:28:16] bouncing from place to place one jumped
[1:28:19] on a stump and said this is that right
[1:28:20] back to the word which the prophet of
[1:28:22] the joy spoke about it shall come to
[1:28:25] pass in the last days saith god i will
[1:28:28] pour out my spirit my new wine into my
[1:28:31] new body
[1:28:33] hallelujah i will pour it out what a
[1:28:35] revival they was having that's god's
[1:28:39] order
[1:28:45] here comes a burst couple bursting
[1:28:47] bottles we've already mentioned it
[1:28:49] and their later afflicted man
[1:28:52] this afflicted man touched the hand of
[1:28:53] one of those said
[1:28:56] give me arms
[1:28:58] that bottle said
[1:28:59] i don't have no silver and gold
[1:29:01] but what i have let me give you a little
[1:29:04] bit
[1:29:06] and he poured that wine down on top of
[1:29:08] that a crippled man and that wine went
[1:29:10] to bubbling inside that body
[1:29:13] and bones started cracking and popping
[1:29:15] and things started happening that man
[1:29:17] been sitting there for year after year
[1:29:18] day after day begging but that wine got
[1:29:21] to bubbling on the inside of him to
[1:29:23] limbs that had never worked worked again
[1:29:26] to bones that had never moved moved
[1:29:27] again to sinews that never bent bend
[1:29:30] again and he began to jump on them feet
[1:29:32] those ankle bones popped in place and
[1:29:35] down through the street he began to run
[1:29:36] give him praise why because the wine of
[1:29:38] god got loose inside of a new bottle
[1:29:43] oh hallelujah i want to be a bottle that
[1:29:46] the holy ghost can work inside of
[1:29:54] that's god's order
[1:29:56] not a big school with a degree
[1:29:58] but a living
[1:29:59] acting experience of the holy ghost
[1:30:04] not fanaticism but the real genuine holy
[1:30:08] spirit in action
[1:30:11] amen
[1:30:12] my spirit
[1:30:16] said i'll take you see first god said i
[1:30:18] had to take the old stony heart out i'm
[1:30:20] going to be a little bit longer i've
[1:30:21] been saving up some time so just hang on
[1:30:23] with me
[1:30:24] i'll give you a new spirit
[1:30:26] see that new spirit is not the holy
[1:30:28] spirit
[1:30:29] so that's where people make mistakes
[1:30:32] they come to the altar and pray
[1:30:34] get the feeling a little better get up
[1:30:36] go out and jump around a while
[1:30:38] bounce before i find out they
[1:30:40] they bounce bounce bounce and
[1:30:41] they bounce their bounce out
[1:30:45] they never received the holy ghost
[1:30:47] no matter how much they bounce how much
[1:30:48] they scream how much oil ran out of
[1:30:50] their hands or bloody faces or how much
[1:30:52] tongues they spoke in or shouted that
[1:30:54] that was only human emotions
[1:30:57] they got a new spirit that can rejoice
[1:30:59] in the presence of god
[1:31:02] did you hear me because there's a lot of
[1:31:03] spirits that can't rejoice in the
[1:31:05] presence of god
[1:31:07] he says i'm going to say something he
[1:31:08] said i want you to sink deep and make
[1:31:10] god help there's an emotional side of
[1:31:13] the so-called holy ghost church today
[1:31:15] they got a lot of built up fanaticism
[1:31:17] run off out there because they disregard
[1:31:19] the word they go only together
[1:31:23] you've got to have the word
[1:31:26] if your emotion takes you off the word
[1:31:28] it's fanaticism
[1:31:30] amen but if your emotion is in the word
[1:31:33] it's not fanaticism
[1:31:36] and shouting and those things are in the
[1:31:38] word
[1:31:40] where were you job
[1:31:43] when the sons of god were shouting for
[1:31:45] joy
[1:31:48] speaking in tongues is in the word
[1:31:51] people want to call it fanaticism it can
[1:31:54] be if that's what you lean on and that's
[1:31:55] all and you go to seed on that as we
[1:31:57] have seen in our generation but it's in
[1:31:59] the word
[1:32:04] if you do that we said because when you
[1:32:06] do all of that and don't
[1:32:08] bear the fruit of the spirit then you're
[1:32:10] in the new spirit
[1:32:12] he said that's right but god has to give
[1:32:14] you a new spirit
[1:32:16] because if he didn't you couldn't get
[1:32:18] along with others you couldn't get along
[1:32:19] with yourself you couldn't get along
[1:32:21] with god you couldn't get along with
[1:32:22] anybody
[1:32:24] so god has to give you a new heart not a
[1:32:26] patched up one a new heart that's your
[1:32:28] intellect what you think a new way of
[1:32:30] thinking and then he gives you a new way
[1:32:32] of that's right a new way of thinking
[1:32:37] yeah buddy all you got to do is look at
[1:32:39] the world because if it wasn't for this
[1:32:41] new spirit you'd be thinking like the
[1:32:43] world thinks
[1:32:46] amen
[1:32:50] yes sir they say well you sure i i i
[1:32:53] don't want to go to hell i i want to
[1:32:55] accept christ that's all right that's
[1:32:57] your first step
[1:32:59] you don't want to go to hell except
[1:33:00] christ he said after that i'll give you
[1:33:02] a new spirit what is that a new desire
[1:33:05] but that's the new spirit notice in
[1:33:07] order of scripture i'll give you a new
[1:33:09] heart a new spirit but then i'll put my
[1:33:12] spirit in there
[1:33:14] my spirit in there that's what the
[1:33:16] scripture says here that's the order the
[1:33:19] numerics the numerical order of the
[1:33:21] scripture a new heart a new spirit and
[1:33:24] then my spirit
[1:33:27] oh hallelujah
[1:33:28] so what is his spirit
[1:33:30] he said his spirit is the holy ghost
[1:33:32] this holy spirit god's new heart that he
[1:33:35] puts in he sets right his new spirit his
[1:33:37] spirit he sits right in the center of
[1:33:39] you that's your impulse that's your
[1:33:40] emotions that new heart that new spirit
[1:33:43] but then the new spirit sits right in
[1:33:44] the center of the new heart and then
[1:33:46] god's spirit sits right in the middle of
[1:33:48] the new spirit and the new heart and it
[1:33:51] controls everything he said it's just
[1:33:53] like a mainspring of a famous watch it's
[1:33:56] self-winding you don't have to wind it
[1:33:59] every day god has wound it once and for
[1:34:02] all
[1:34:03] oh he sets it right in the middle of you
[1:34:07] and it don't have to be rewind
[1:34:10] it don't have to have a new youth camp
[1:34:12] to get built back up again and to get
[1:34:14] back over pornography and get back over
[1:34:17] things again that's not the holy ghost
[1:34:19] if the holy ghost is in you it's been
[1:34:21] wound up since the foundation of the
[1:34:24] world and it's never going to run out of
[1:34:26] power
[1:34:29] that holy ghost is if that holy ghost
[1:34:31] said god's spirit is on the inside of
[1:34:33] you you won't have to worry about days
[1:34:35] down the road years down the road and
[1:34:37] you've been delivered of alcohol and one
[1:34:39] day you hit a hit weak moment and you
[1:34:41] get drunk all over again if you do
[1:34:43] you've never had it
[1:34:48] never
[1:34:49] you can make all the excuses you want to
[1:34:51] make
[1:34:52] you're just pushing the can down the
[1:34:53] road
[1:34:55] what you need to do is get on your knees
[1:34:56] and say god i'm sorry
[1:34:58] i want not just a new heart and a new
[1:35:00] spirit i want your spirit i want the
[1:35:03] mainspring inside of me this guy has
[1:35:06] moved in every gear of my life it's
[1:35:08] moving every motion of my life it's
[1:35:11] moving every thought of my life and when
[1:35:13] the thought comes in that i know ain't
[1:35:15] from the mainspring it kicks it out a
[1:35:17] new thought from the word of god comes
[1:35:18] and takes its place that's the main
[1:35:20] spring operating on the inside of you
[1:35:28] it sits right in the middle of your new
[1:35:29] life
[1:35:31] as it
[1:35:32] begins to tick and begins to control
[1:35:35] every little organism of that watch
[1:35:38] the holy spirit will control
[1:35:40] every little detail of your life
[1:35:44] when the holy spirit not a new degree
[1:35:47] not a new church
[1:35:49] not a new thought not a new emotion not
[1:35:51] a new oil not a new dance not a new lip
[1:35:53] not a new tongue not a new this not a
[1:35:55] new that but when god places his spirit
[1:35:58] in the middle of your spirit
[1:36:00] your new spirit
[1:36:02] then you don't have to act mike
[1:36:06] hello somebody you don't have to act

[1:38:45] up your pride and your bitterness and
[1:38:47] your fear and your unbelief and
[1:38:49] everything that's not of god and lay it
[1:38:51] upon an altar and say god i want you

[1:38:58] life

[1:39:07] but when you blow up at every little
[1:39:08] thing that happens
[1:39:10] and that disposition's in you
[1:39:12] when the pastor happens to hit something
[1:39:14] that's in the word and you make this
[1:39:16] says he makes a spitting noise
[1:39:19] i don't believe that look out old

[1:39:31] it makes you believe
[1:39:32] it makes you act in a certain way
[1:39:35] it'll make you act in a way till you
[1:39:36] become so salty the whole world thirsts
[1:39:38] to be like you
[1:39:41] that's the holy spirit sitting in the
[1:39:43] middle of your heart that's the main
[1:39:45] spring
[1:39:46] amen he said but when it's a yoke and
[1:39:49] your yoke with

[1:39:56] oh i like hearing him from is the
[1:39:58] prophet okay i like hearing him for a
[1:39:59] few minutes
[1:40:01] but i tell you the last time i went
[1:40:05] when i went down to that card party
[1:40:06] susie said to me do you believe to tell
[1:40:08] me the very audacity that you have
[1:40:10] belittled yourself to take your hair
[1:40:11] down you mean you wear those old old
[1:40:14] folky clothes now and you don't wear
[1:40:16] what you used to wear
[1:40:18] he said the thing of it is you just got
[1:40:20] a new spirit
[1:40:21] but it just and it kills you
[1:40:23] he said but when you get his spirit
[1:40:26] it makes every tick just right to the
[1:40:28] word of god
[1:40:30] every little tick right with the word
[1:40:33] when the word preaches on bitterness
[1:40:34] you'll search your heart and get rid of
[1:40:36] bitterness
[1:40:37] if the word preaches on sin or something
[1:40:40] in your closet you'll go home you'll
[1:40:41] kick the trash out
[1:40:45] amen if the word preaches on certain
[1:40:47] things in your life you'll go home and
[1:40:49] get rid of them
[1:40:54] it's the truth i mean the word can be
[1:40:56] preached about our time and video games
[1:40:59] and we just go right back to them
[1:41:02] go to a new revival and get all fired up
[1:41:04] and burn them and go buy some new ones
[1:41:08] you ain't got the main spring yet
[1:41:12] amen
[1:41:15] when you get his spirit it makes every
[1:41:17] emotion tick just right
[1:41:19] the holy spirit in my heart
[1:41:22] that mainspring will tell you to abstain
[1:41:24] from all the filth of the world
[1:41:26] it'll tell you to pray
[1:41:28] it'll tell you to seek after god it'll
[1:41:31] begin to woo over you it'll begin to
[1:41:33] draw over you it'll begin to move in
[1:41:36] every facet of your life
[1:41:41] well what about our are our young people
[1:41:43] going to college if they got the main
[1:41:45] spring they'll come out of college with
[1:41:47] the mainspring
[1:41:51] amen but if they got the new spirit
[1:41:53] they might come out
[1:41:55] and be filled back up with every kind of
[1:41:57] thing
[1:42:00] and even doubt
[1:42:02] and even in unbelief
[1:42:05] don't even believe it's right anymore
[1:42:08] why
[1:42:09] one day they used to shout and they used
[1:42:10] to praise god right here on the same
[1:42:12] pews you do
[1:42:14] but they never got the main spring
[1:42:17] they never got the holy spirit they
[1:42:19] never got him moving in their hearts and
[1:42:21] in their lives
[1:42:22] but see what it what is it
[1:42:24] he said the holy spirit
[1:42:26] wants for himself a body
[1:42:30] just like he wanted to land for israel
[1:42:31] and he wanted a place for israel so he
[1:42:33] said i'm going to do this i'm going to
[1:42:35] be able to draw begin to draw out of the
[1:42:37] deserts flowers and i'm going to draw
[1:42:40] out of their wineries and and things
[1:42:42] that people can live in and i'm gonna
[1:42:44] bring out of these deserted places and
[1:42:46] these desert that what happened the holy
[1:42:48] spirit began to brood over that place
[1:42:50] and not only did it brood over a land it
[1:42:52] brewed over a physical people and they
[1:42:54] began to have a longing and an intense
[1:42:56] desire i want to go to that place
[1:42:59] hey they had good livings where they was
[1:43:01] at
[1:43:02] they was in good places and good
[1:43:03] positions but they began to cry out as
[1:43:06] things begin to turn and things began
[1:43:08] they began to go into death camps they
[1:43:09] begin to say i i want to go to a land
[1:43:11] for israel i got to have what was it he
[1:43:14] said it was the tender hand of jehovah
[1:43:16] wooing them to a land
[1:43:19] wooing them to a place it was the
[1:43:21] mainspring calling them
[1:43:25] amen it begins to make it says what is
[1:43:27] it what does it mean to brood or to woo
[1:43:29] it means to make love to cool like a
[1:43:31] dove it begins to brood over a land as
[1:43:34] it did six thousand years ago and the
[1:43:36] earth without form without void what was
[1:43:39] it the holy spirit began to overshadow
[1:43:41] it and begin to woo on it
[1:43:43] and so desolate looking place it began
[1:43:46] to pop out a seed and a flower drew it
[1:43:48] and a lily and a rose and this and that
[1:43:50] and the other trees and pine trees oak
[1:43:52] trees and mountains and every kind of
[1:43:54] thing why because the spirit was pulling
[1:43:56] it out
[1:43:59] and you wonder why in services you feel
[1:44:02] such a pull
[1:44:04] it ain't a man
[1:44:06] it's the holy spirit trying to pull
[1:44:10] poor
[1:44:11] brood
[1:44:13] he's going cool
[1:44:16] cool
[1:44:20] if you'll come to me
[1:44:22] i'll give you a drink
[1:44:26] if you'll move
[1:44:28] i will give you what you have need of
[1:44:32] if your desire from if you'll just open
[1:44:35] up your heart and say yes lord i'll do
[1:44:37] more for you than you could ever think
[1:44:39] more abundantly than you could ever
[1:44:42] imagine
[1:44:43] what is that that's cool
[1:44:45] his word goes across the desk and it's
[1:44:47] whoo
[1:44:53] and you hear it
[1:44:55] off old cowhide
[1:44:58] as it begins to hit places
[1:45:00] and hard places
[1:45:02] people just sit there with their arms
[1:45:04] folded and they're not interested at all
[1:45:05] picking at their fingernails not even
[1:45:07] tuned in at all
[1:45:11] meanwhile the spirits
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:14] all of a sudden next
[1:45:16] to this person over here that's been
[1:45:17] dried up is a life that pops out poof
[1:45:21] yes lord
[1:45:24] i'm here god i i hear you call and i'm
[1:45:26] responding
[1:45:28] and he's pulling and he's pulling and
[1:45:31] he's pulling he said what happens in the
[1:45:33] beginning the holy spirit began to brood
[1:45:35] over a bleak desert he said well when
[1:45:37] there was nothing never been nothing but
[1:45:39] that holy spirit began to pull and the
[1:45:41] big wings stretched over that earth at
[1:45:44] main spring
[1:45:45] that holy spirit began to pull out trees
[1:45:48] and animals and out of the animals and i
[1:45:50] began birds began to fly trees began to
[1:45:53] bloom it kept cooing until a man popped
[1:45:56] up and man and this man looked
[1:45:59] lonely and lonesome and he could begin
[1:46:01] to coo and and they brought eve out of
[1:46:04] adam and he loved adam and he loved eve
[1:46:07] and he takes them and begins to pull
[1:46:09] them to himself
[1:46:19] that's what he did two thousand years
[1:46:21] ago we'll get into it wednesday
[1:46:24] as he begin to draw upon a place
[1:46:26] that was so dark and desolate
[1:46:28] and so broken up in political
[1:46:31] chaos
[1:46:32] but the holy spirit began to coo
[1:46:34] until it found a virgin
[1:46:36] that said be it unto me
[1:46:39] how many other virgins was there in the
[1:46:40] land
[1:46:42] but he knew there was one that was going
[1:46:43] to say be it unto me
[1:46:46] be it unto me
[1:46:48] let me go on down just for a second
[1:46:57] he said god
[1:46:59] trying to bring you to himself
[1:47:02] that's why spirit is lingering that's
[1:47:04] why spirit is moving that's why his
[1:47:06] spirit is calling unto people calling
[1:47:10] because he wants a body
[1:47:11] he wants a people
[1:47:13] he wants a people
[1:47:15] a spiritual people
[1:47:17] in a millennium
[1:47:18] in a new heavens and a new earth
[1:47:22] and it begins to coo
[1:47:25] and as i read in
[1:47:26] ezekiel 36 as this spirit of god begin
[1:47:29] to go over that desolate land and begin
[1:47:31] to bring it up
[1:47:33] it moves over into ezekiel 37
[1:47:38] and it's still the spirit of god cooing
[1:47:42] it says the hand of the lord was upon me
[1:47:43] and carried me out of the spirit and set
[1:47:46] me in the midst of the valley which is
[1:47:47] full of dry bones
[1:47:50] and it caused me to pass by them round
[1:47:52] about and behold there were very many in
[1:47:54] open valley and they were very dry
[1:47:58] dry cowhides
[1:48:01] dry nothing just broken humanity
[1:48:05] and he said son of man can these bones
[1:48:07] live and he said oh lord you know
[1:48:09] he said prophesy these bones say oh ye
[1:48:12] dry bones hear the word of the lord thus
[1:48:15] saith the lord god and these bones
[1:48:16] behold i will cause breath to enter into
[1:48:19] you and ye
[1:48:20] shall live and i'll lay sinews and i'll
[1:48:23] bring flesh and i'll cover you with skin
[1:48:25] and i'll put breath in here and you
[1:48:27] shall live and you shall know that i am
[1:48:30] the lord what was it it was the spirit
[1:48:32] of god calling to dry bones

[1:48:42] my spirit listen the holy ghost wants to
[1:48:44] be in you more than you want the holy

[1:48:50] overcome and lay on us here he wants to
[1:48:52] come in your life
[1:48:59] he said prophesy
[1:49:01] and you see prophesied he watched
[1:49:04] a great noise and a shaking began to
[1:49:06] take place
[1:49:07] bones came together bone to bone
[1:49:10] and the sin used in the flesh came upon
[1:49:12] them and the skin covered them above
[1:49:14] but there was no breath in them
[1:49:17] a new heart and new spirit
[1:49:20] and he said unto him prophesy in the
[1:49:22] wind prophesy son of man and say to the
[1:49:24] wind thus saith the lord god
[1:49:26] come from the four winds o breath and
[1:49:28] breathe upon these slang that they may
[1:49:30] live and i prophesied as he commanded me
[1:49:33] and breath came into them and they lived
[1:49:35] and stood upon their feet an exceedingly
[1:49:38] great army and he said to me son of man
[1:49:41] these bones of the whole house of israel
[1:49:42] behold they say our bones are dried our
[1:49:45] hope is lost we're cut off from our
[1:49:47] parts therefore prophesy and say unto
