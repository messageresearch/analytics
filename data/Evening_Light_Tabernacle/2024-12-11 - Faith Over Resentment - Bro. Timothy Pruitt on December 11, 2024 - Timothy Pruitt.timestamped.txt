[39:02] let's turn to Exodus 15 verse 22 amen
[39:07] this thought's been on my heart since
[39:08] the end of the service last Wednesday as
[39:11] I touched on this and just I knew as I
[39:14] touched on it I touched something the
[39:16] Lord uh was mindful of and just a real
[39:20] sweet Spirit came into the place and so
[39:23] I I just want to continue on this for a
[39:25] moment Exodus chapter 15 and verse 22 so
[39:30] Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea
[39:33] and they went out into the Wilderness of
[39:35] sh and they went three days journey in
[39:38] the wilderness and found no water when
[39:41] they came to Mara they could not drink
[39:43] of the Waters of Mara for they were
[39:45] bitter therefore they called the name of
[39:48] it was called Mara amen we'll let you be
[39:53] seated uh last Wednesday I just hit a
[39:56] little spot on resentment and I like to
[39:58] speak to you uh today on faith over
[40:02] resentment uh just looking at this word
[40:05] resentment is actually a very complex
[40:07] thing complex word it's a complex
[40:11] emotion that can be uh described as a
[40:14] combination of anger and bitterness
[40:16] disgust disappointment and
[40:19] disapproval it's generally a reaction of
[40:22] being mistreated or wronged by someone
[40:24] or something whether that's really real
[40:27] or
[40:28] perceived and you know the Bible speaks
[40:31] about bitterness and all this is that's
[40:33] and anger and things that's contained in
[40:35] resentment of course there's no time to
[40:37] go through every scripture but few
[40:39] scriptures Ephesians 4 and verse 29 says
[40:42] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[40:44] of your mouth but that which is good for
[40:47] the use of edifying that it may Minister
[40:50] Grace unto the hears and grieve not the
[40:53] holy spirit of God whereby you are
[40:55] sealed unto the day of your Redemption
[40:58] let all bitterness wrath anger and
[41:01] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[41:04] from you with all malice and be ye kind
[41:07] one to another tenderhearted forgiving
[41:10] one another even as God for Christ sake
[41:13] has forgiven you now we know that as you
[41:16] can only be forgiven as you are as you
[41:19] forgive amen that's that's what he said
[41:21] in the Lord's Prayer he said forgive us
[41:24] as we forgive our debtors so the
[41:26] forgiveness that you give is the
[41:28] Forgiveness that you receive amen
[41:30] Hebrews 12 what in verse 14 says it like
[41:33] this 15 also follow peace with all men
[41:36] and Holiness without which no without
[41:39] which no man shall see the Lord looking
[41:41] diligently lest any man fail of the
[41:45] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[41:48] spring up trouble you and thereby many
[41:51] be defiled and and I I just been
[41:54] thinking on that how how Paul described
[41:56] it as a root of bitterness he didn't say
[41:59] just any bitterness but he described it
[42:01] as a root of bitterness and and this
[42:03] root you know would to signify that it's
[42:05] a deep-seated or underlying issue that
[42:08] can grow and spread when it's left
[42:10] unchecked and many times you know as
[42:12] roots you don't see the root of a tree
[42:14] you don't really see the roots of plants
[42:17] and those things can grow out and become
[42:19] very big and you not even realize what
[42:21] has happened around you and you know
[42:23] just this week uh uh my two my two boys
[42:26] uh brother Luke and brother Andrew were
[42:28] coming home every day and they had been
[42:30] working on this pool and and this pool
[42:32] beautiful looking pool as far as the
[42:33] pictures i' had seen and it had a leak
[42:35] in it and this leak they couldn't they
[42:37] took a while to find it but when they
[42:39] found it it was a big root they had a
[42:41] picture of this great big root had it
[42:43] growed under there and caused pipes to
[42:45] break and and caused it to where this
[42:47] pool could not really be a functioning
[42:49] pool or it was constantly having to add
[42:51] water to it and I I thought about that
[42:53] because there's many things in our lives
[42:55] as as we allow a man things to grow and
[42:58] become unchecked hindrances in our heart
[43:01] and our lives and we allow it to lay
[43:03] under the surface unseen by many unseen
[43:06] Maybe by a preacher but amen but God
[43:08] sees our very heart he he sees the
[43:11] depths of our heart and the things that
[43:12] we're holding and have allowed things to
[43:14] crack Us in the place where we become as
[43:17] brother brand would talk about broken
[43:18] sisters to where we can't even hold
[43:21] things of God any longer because our our
[43:23] heart is all broken apart by things
[43:25] we've allowed to grow there another
[43:28] translation of this is actually uh
[43:30] Bitter Root is not just a root of
[43:32] bitterness but it's translated as Bitter
[43:34] Root another words if the root is bitter
[43:37] the fruit is also bitter amen because
[43:40] amen when the root down there because
[43:42] the life comes through the root amen and
[43:45] so if the root is bitter that means the
[43:47] fruit that that tree gives off is also
[43:49] bitter amen it also gives off a certain
[43:52] taste or certain Aroma you know the root
[43:54] is not seen it can grow and cause or
[43:57] issues and you're not even realizing
[43:59] bitterness or or resentment can fester
[44:02] in a person's heart and affect their
[44:04] life and their relationships Nega
[44:06] negatively if they're not dealt with you
[44:08] know describing it as a root of
[44:10] bitterness is showing that it's not just
[44:13] a fleeting
[44:14] emotion amen it's not just a fleeting
[44:17] emotion or feeling I'm not talking about
[44:19] you having a feeling about something but
[44:21] then you just push that away but
[44:22] something that lays there constantly
[44:25] amen and engra becomes ingrained in your
[44:28] attitude towards that person or or that
[44:30] thing or even God Amen their attitude
[44:34] and can produce negative consequences
[44:36] not only in their lives but also lives
[44:39] around them amen to overcome it you have
[44:42] to constantly uproot that thing and when
[44:45] that uprooting requires to bring you to
[44:47] have forgiveness and also letting
[44:51] go amen forgiveness is not just saying I
[44:55] I I forgive a person but yet you still
[44:57] hold it you do not forgive them but if
[44:58] you actually have forgiven somebody you
[45:01] can lay that thing aside and sure
[45:03] feeling may come but now you can conquer
[45:05] that thing and not allow it to grow
[45:08] inside of your life resentment or
[45:10] bitterness is not always towards someone
[45:13] or something but many times people
[45:15] actually become bitter towards God
[45:18] because their life ain't exactly how
[45:19] they thought it would be or their
[45:21] expectation of God he ain't met their
[45:24] expectation how he would do this and he
[45:26] would heal this or he would save this or
[45:28] he would do that and many times we
[45:30] become bitter in our hearts toward God
[45:32] and if we have that bitterness or that
[45:35] resentment then God can't do anything
[45:37] for us amen God cannot move in our lives
[45:40] and our hearts and our services amen you
[45:42] know I was looking as we read the
[45:44] scripture the children of Israel you
[45:46] know they had come through the Red Sea
[45:48] and God had brought them a great victory
[45:50] anden in spite of all their doubting and
[45:53] in spite of all their unbelief in spite
[45:55] of it all God opened up the Red Sea and
[45:58] he brought them across the dry land and
[46:00] he destroyed their enemy and you thought
[46:03] you know they they brought them into a
[46:05] place amen that they begin to praise God
[46:07] and worship God and give God glory and
[46:10] you know brother brand says it like this
[46:12] he said when they come across that sea
[46:14] and got on the other side and God closed
[46:16] it in on their enemies those old
[46:18] Taskmaster he said could you imagine how
[46:20] those Jews felt looking back there the
[46:23] very things that had whipped them and
[46:25] beat their back with stripes pulled him
[46:27] over like this was now dead floating in
[46:29] the sea he said brother when you come to
[46:31] the Red Sea of the blood of God every
[46:33] old dirty habit that drove you to things
[46:35] you wouldn't do you find it dead in the
[46:38] blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah them
[46:40] things floating and down Face Down In
[46:42] The Stream he said no wonder Moses got
[46:45] in the spirit he said you talk about you
[46:47] having some kind of new religion look at
[46:49] this maram a prophet is she looked out
[46:52] there and she picked up a tambourine and
[46:54] she began to beat it and dance and she
[46:56] began to pray God and Daughters of
[46:58] Israel begin to follow or praise and
[47:00] Moses raised up his hand and got so
[47:02] caught up in the Holy Ghost till he sung
[47:04] in the spirit Hallelujah that's right
[47:06] and he said the same holy ghost that was
[47:08] on Moses is in this building tonight
[47:11] same one that M made marryam dances here
[47:14] again tonight God is God and it changes
[47:17] not but notice they left that place of
[47:21] enjoyment of Happiness of praise and it
[47:24] took three days
[47:28] three days yeah not three months not
[47:31] three years three days they found
[47:35] themselves at Bitter
[47:38] waters you know after the big song was
[47:40] over and the big shout was over and a
[47:43] big Hallelujah big time was over and
[47:45] they started through the Wilderness and
[47:47] they LED them and he led them straight
[47:49] to Bitter
[47:51] Waters he said right into temptation
[47:54] right into where the water were bitter
[47:56] and they couldn't drink and they had
[47:58] nothing to eat and the water was bitter
[48:00] and the stream of mar bitter Waters laid
[48:03] laid right in God's path that God was
[48:06] leading his children isn't that strange
[48:08] he said isn't that strange look look
[48:10] like God would have bypassed all of
[48:13] that there was Oasis out there in the
[48:16] desert there was places they could have
[48:17] got drinks there was place but he
[48:19] brought them right to that place and he
[48:22] said ain't it funny that God's path or
[48:25] God's leadership will lead lead us
[48:27] straight by those places and lead us to
[48:30] Opportunities amen how to see how we are
[48:33] going to react in the middle of our
[48:35] struggle in the middle of our trial in
[48:37] the middle of our Temptation are we
[48:39] going to become bitter about it are we
[48:41] going to become a resentful about it or
[48:43] are we going to say God I have faith
[48:45] that all things work together for the
[48:47] good to them that are the called
[48:49] according to his purpose and if I'm at
[48:52] Bitter Waters I'm in his purpose if I'm
[48:54] in the desert I'm in his purpose if I'm
[48:56] at a fountain I'm in his purpose no
[48:59] matter where I'm at I'm in God's
[49:03] purpose see some are LED through Waters
[49:07] some through floods some through deep
[49:09] trials but it's all through the
[49:11] blood amen that's God's way of leading
[49:14] people how soon though they begin to
[49:17] resent God for bringing them to this
[49:20] place you know not like many today that
[49:23] resent God for the situation that
[49:25] they're in
[49:27] or are the way things have worked out in
[49:29] their life or the situation that that
[49:32] has happened or you know it just didn't
[49:34] come out like I thought it would or or
[49:35] this person did this to me and I I I I
[49:38] resent them for that if you ain't
[49:40] careful you're not you're not listen
[49:42] unforgiveness is not holding somebody
[49:44] else a
[49:45] prisoner unforgiveness is holding
[49:48] yourself a prisoner but if you can
[49:50] forgive and let those things go then
[49:53] you're no longer a prisoner no more it's
[49:55] you know to forgive somebody of
[49:56] something that they actually done wrong
[49:58] and they' done wrong to you amen
[50:00] forgiving some them of something is not
[50:02] letting them go of God's
[50:04] punishment no they have to make
[50:06] themselves right with God Amen that's
[50:08] between them and God but what is letting
[50:10] go is letting you go of the hurt and the
[50:13] pain amen that they cause that's trying
[50:15] to hold you down and clamp down on your
[50:18] worship and clamp down on the on the
[50:20] real fruit God wants to bring out of
[50:22] your life
[50:27] and here they go through the Wilderness
[50:29] and after the oldfashioned meeting you
[50:30] know ah my I just on top of the mountain
[50:33] and then three days later were sitting
[50:35] at Bitter Waters could you imagine God
[50:38] taking his children right after they got
[50:40] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost to
[50:42] The Fountains of bitter
[50:45] Waters I thought when I got saved and I
[50:48] filled with the Holy Ghost it was a just
[50:49] a Highway to Heaven brother we're going
[50:51] to have a good time all the way there no
[50:52] we're going to go through
[50:54] trials he said you know when you get the
[50:56] Holy Ghost you're going to come up
[50:59] against a lot of
[51:01] obstacles a lot of obstacles many are
[51:03] the Affliction of the righteous but God
[51:11] deliverthat said many are the
[51:13] afflictions of the
[51:15] righteous and period but he didn't leave
[51:18] us that way he said
[51:21] but but God deliver them out of them all
[51:26] so man no matter what situation you find
[51:29] yourself in if you'll put your trust in
[51:31] your God he will deliver you out of your
[51:35] situation well why ain't so and so going
[51:37] through this and why ain't they facing
[51:39] this listen it may not be for them God
[51:41] knows what a person can handle at what
[51:43] time they can handle it he knows exactly
[51:46] how much he can put upon you he knows
[51:48] exactly how much he can test you and
[51:50] therefore you may can hold more be
[51:52] tested more and somebody else can at
[51:54] that moment but it might be just down
[51:55] the road three days later that they're
[51:58] tested in a worse way than you
[52:02] are you know it's it's easy to find
[52:04] ourselves you know well I'm telling you
[52:06] what God's just cruel well is he really
[52:08] being
[52:09] cruel no he's not being cruel he's
[52:13] bringing you to a prepared place so if
[52:16] he's going to bring you to a prepared
[52:18] place and he's got to prepare you for
[52:19] that prepared
[52:23] place you know it's like he said I heard
[52:25] the story of a shepherd in Jerusalem
[52:27] broke a sheep's leg they said why are
[52:29] you so cruel the shepher being a such a
[52:31] cruel Shepherd why would you break the
[52:33] Sheep's leg said well she didn't she
[52:35] didn't she didn't love me she thought
[52:37] you know uh but I thought I thought if I
[52:40] would just do this and cause her to lean
[52:42] on me more and then so then that I could
[52:45] give her some special attention and she
[52:48] could love me more from then on so if
[52:51] you hear what he's saying I mean God's
[52:53] not going to just literally break your
[52:55] leg but he's going to bring you to a
[52:57] place that you can't do nothing on your
[53:00] own amen you can't do it by your own
[53:02] wisdom you can't do it by your own might
[53:04] you can't do it by your own intellect
[53:06] you can't do it how you think it ought
[53:08] to be done amen or what it should and so
[53:10] you have to lean on him more and realize
[53:13] I'm leaning on him and he's the one that
[53:15] is carrying me through and when you get
[53:18] to the other side of it you'll love him
[53:20] more why because it wasn't you that did
[53:23] it it was God that did it in you
[53:29] amen this is the way Jesus leads his
[53:33] church when they were there the waters
[53:35] were bitter and they couldn't drink it
[53:38] but God had provided a way if they had
[53:40] just said Lord I trust
[53:43] you then those bitter Waters become
[53:49] sweet because he said right there was a
[53:52] tree he had already planted he he had
[53:56] already prepared for this problem for
[54:00] this situation he already had an
[54:02] answer come on now if we realize God
[54:06] does listen your problems does not catch
[54:08] God by
[54:10] surprise said that before I keep saying
[54:12] it until we believe it our problems does
[54:15] not catch God by surprise it catches Us
[54:17] by surprise because we're finite beings
[54:19] but God has already prepared something
[54:22] by your problem for your way of
[54:25] Escape come on somebody before you even
[54:28] get there God's already provided a way
[54:30] of Escape but he's trying to let you tr
[54:33] get to a place that you're going to
[54:35] trust him no matter what
[54:41] happens that's right Calvary he said
[54:44] right there was that tree representing
[54:46] golgatha and Calvary he said many times
[54:49] we get into some hard places he said but
[54:52] when I get into a hard place this is a
[54:55] good advice when when I get into a hard
[54:57] place I shut my eyes and think about
[55:05] Calvary I don't think we any of us been
[55:07] in that kind of hard
[55:10] place come on now what kind of place was
[55:13] he in
[55:15] Calvary everybody knows that story
[55:18] right I mean he had been beaten he had
[55:21] been spit on he had been slapped he had
[55:24] been made fun of he had been mocked he
[55:25] had been strip
[55:27] naked and he's said Calvary he said so
[55:30] when I get in a hard place I think about
[55:33] Calvary not think about how am I going
[55:36] to get back at
[55:37] somebody not think about how am I going
[55:39] to get even or how am I going to hold I
[55:42] I think about
[55:44] Calvary what was in Calvary it was God's
[55:47] forgiveness for
[55:50] us and if he would take that punishment
[55:52] for me how how can I withhold
[55:55] forgiveness from somebody
[56:00] else preached on this before I preached
[56:02] on heart Trouble Over $17 it was about
[56:05] that man who went to the king and they
[56:07] brought him I brought him he held held
[56:09] such a debt it was over million just
[56:11] millions of dollars in debt and he's
[56:13] like I I can't pay it I I can't do it I
[56:15] I I I there's no way I can pay this debt
[56:19] and and the King and his mercy and Grace
[56:21] Struck it all
[56:23] off forgiven
[56:26] and this man walks out of that place
[56:28] walks down the street and he finds a man
[56:31] that owed him just a few dollars which
[56:33] was actually about into today's money
[56:34] about 17 bucks he be he had been
[56:38] forgiven millions and he was holding he
[56:41] had his hands around the but man's neck
[56:43] over
[56:46] $17 sounds like a lot of us sometimes we
[56:49] have been forgiven of so
[56:52] much I don't care who you are from the
[56:55] worst to the Great
[56:56] we're all
[56:58] Sinners we've all fallen short of the
[57:01] glory of God we have all been forgiven
[57:03] of much we our debt that we could not
[57:07] pay there ain't one person in this
[57:09] building could pay your own sin debt I
[57:12] don't care if you committed one sin or a
[57:13] billion sin you can not pay your own sin
[57:16] debt but God rich in
[57:19] Mercy he he shed his blood on the cross
[57:22] that we can be forgiven and how dare us
[57:25] hold somebody body's head over
[57:29] $17 so when I get in a hard place I
[57:32] think about
[57:37] Calvary and a redeemer who bled for me
[57:40] and died for my life then my trial
[57:45] begins to seem so
[57:47] little yes
[57:49] sir but you
[57:51] know and he said I he said it seems and
[57:54] I throw that aside and I walk on he
[57:56] said' what happens it makes my trial
[57:58] sweet it sweetens it because I'm not
[58:02] going through what he went through he
[58:04] went it through he went through it for
[58:06] me so I don't have
[58:09] to but you know the Bible there's many
[58:11] examples of people who displayed
[58:13] resentment you can go right at the very
[58:15] beginning of the of the whole thing when
[58:17] Cain amen slew his brother Abel what was
[58:20] it he was resentful over Abel's
[58:23] worship he was resentful that God would
[58:26] come down and be pleased with what Abel
[58:29] had offered and and it looked like what
[58:30] in the world you offering Abel you got
[58:32] nothing but a bloody a bleeding lamb I
[58:35] here I've got my fruits I've got
[58:37] everything that I've done and prepared
[58:39] all in a beautiful decorated way and God
[58:42] rejected me but he hasn't rejected you
[58:44] but see Abel was looking by
[58:47] Revelation he wasn't looking by his own
[58:49] abili or what he could do or what he
[58:51] could produce he was looking by
[58:53] Revelation and by revelation he was
[58:56] revealed to him that it took
[58:58] blood not the blood of a turnup or the
[59:01] juice of a tomato or the or the juice of
[59:03] a corn it took blood and so he brought a
[59:06] living D lamb and laid it there upon the
[59:09] Altar and hacked his throat to blood
[59:12] spew and him and his and his sacrifice
[59:15] became
[59:18] one and and God told told Kan said if
[59:21] you'll do as able you'll be accepted too
[59:26] but he was resentful over his worship he
[59:29] was resentful over God how God had
[59:32] accepted
[59:35] him hello somebody and if we're not
[59:39] careful and we bring it a little
[59:40] different manner if we're not careful we
[59:42] can get resentful towards other people
[59:44] because they look more blessed than we
[59:48] look oh
[59:52] yeah Joseph's brothers became resentful
[59:56] towards him because he was a
[59:58] supernatural boy he had Supernatural
[1:00:01] dreams and and you know the funny thing
[1:00:03] about it it they were also in his
[1:00:07] dreams they were also a part of it but
[1:00:09] they wern't the part that they wanted
[1:00:11] they wanted the one to be bowed to not
[1:00:13] bow to they wanted the one to be
[1:00:16] worshiped not worship too amen they
[1:00:18] wanted the exhaustion they wanted all
[1:00:20] that but here they saw oh Joseph you're
[1:00:22] just having a dream ain't that funny
[1:00:24] you're always in the top you're always
[1:00:26] the one being worshiped and God was
[1:00:28] showing them what was about to take
[1:00:30] place in their life if they would have
[1:00:31] only not been so resentful they could
[1:00:34] have saw it that's right but they became
[1:00:37] so resentful that they sold him for 30
[1:00:39] pieces of silver and they put him on a
[1:00:41] camel and he went his way to to Egypt
[1:00:44] and sometimes later they were still so
[1:00:46] tore up about it that they could not see
[1:00:48] God's plan in it all and God had raised
[1:00:51] him up to be next in line with Pharaoh
[1:00:54] just as what the dreams had said
[1:00:57] and here they are and they find
[1:00:59] themselves still
[1:01:04] resentful and it kept
[1:01:07] them resentment keeps you from receiving
[1:01:10] what God really has for you Saul became
[1:01:15] resentful towards
[1:01:18] David you're going to read a good book
[1:01:20] and I'm I'm just throwing it out there
[1:01:23] The Tail Of Three Kings
[1:01:26] tells about Saul and David and Absalom
[1:01:29] and their lives and the tell that they
[1:01:32] that all the different things in Avenues
[1:01:34] as they went but here Saul began to
[1:01:36] resent David and here David had brought
[1:01:39] him one of the greatest victories in his
[1:01:41] kingdom had ever
[1:01:42] had but what happened people begin to
[1:01:45] sing the song of
[1:01:46] David ah David's killed 10,000 Sauls
[1:01:49] only killed a thousand well at least I'm
[1:01:52] killing
[1:01:54] somebody come come on he was still
[1:01:57] killing
[1:01:59] enemies he may not was doing it in the
[1:02:02] in the capacity that David was called to
[1:02:04] hello somebody but he was still killing
[1:02:06] enemies you know that's where you got to
[1:02:08] be careful amen is when you look at
[1:02:10] other people's lives and you resent
[1:02:11] because God seemingly using their gift
[1:02:13] more God seemingly doing this and we
[1:02:15] begin to re become resentful to where
[1:02:18] the point we make it a carnal thing and
[1:02:20] said they're only that because of their
[1:02:22] last name they're only that because
[1:02:24] they're doing this and that's happening
[1:02:25] and that that's going on and we put it
[1:02:27] all on the hands of man meanwhile God is
[1:02:30] the one that's doing
[1:02:32] it God is the one that's orchestrated
[1:02:35] and so if we're not careful our
[1:02:36] resentment is not really towards that
[1:02:38] person it's towards a God that's behind
[1:02:41] that
[1:02:45] person Pharisees and scribes never could
[1:02:48] receive nothing Jesus said because they
[1:02:51] res resented his teachings and Authority
[1:02:58] I'll go through a couple quotes here
[1:03:00] says if you get brother BR talk about
[1:03:02] resentment say incredible and this why
[1:03:05] this is why we got to be real careful
[1:03:07] what we bring into the house of God and
[1:03:09] say God forgive me of that and let me
[1:03:12] let that go he said see if you got a
[1:03:15] resenting audience the Holy Spirit won't
[1:03:18] even
[1:03:21] reveal yeah see something you got to
[1:03:24] have something working together they're
[1:03:26] they were in one place in one Accord
[1:03:29] then there came a sound from heaven but
[1:03:31] no matter how much I pray lay day and
[1:03:33] night studying praying before the Lord
[1:03:35] walk down here maybe anointing on me but
[1:03:38] walk up here and that resentment on you
[1:03:41] it just Grieves him right away and he
[1:03:43] won't reveal
[1:03:46] anything he said and when you walk down
[1:03:48] here under the anointing but when you
[1:03:50] walk down here under the anointing and
[1:03:52] you feel the audience under that same
[1:03:54] anointing then the the holy spirit will
[1:03:56] work and he'll begin to move and do
[1:03:59] great things for
[1:04:01] us come on somebody amen listen you may
[1:04:05] not have enough resentment in your life
[1:04:07] to hinder a whole service but you can
[1:04:09] have enough in your life to hinder what
[1:04:11] God has for
[1:04:13] you amen hallelujah that's what he said
[1:04:16] in other place he said there was a man
[1:04:18] and his wife first time they ever in one
[1:04:20] of my meetings they were sitting in the
[1:04:22] audience lady come in and sat down right
[1:04:24] beside them and this and the little lady
[1:04:27] resented
[1:04:29] it there's somebody sitting beside her
[1:04:32] resent got my
[1:04:35] PE
[1:04:37] oh got in my
[1:04:40] Pew and the lady was cuz the lady was
[1:04:43] sitting a little
[1:04:44] close and she got kind of in her way so
[1:04:48] that lady made her move
[1:04:53] back well is my right I've been here 25
[1:04:55] five years got my own Pew no you
[1:05:00] don't you got your own seat there
[1:05:02] wherever you sit in
[1:05:07] it Hallelujah
[1:05:10] anyhow and after while this lady made
[1:05:12] her move back and she resented this this
[1:05:16] woman that moved back she resented the
[1:05:19] woman resenting
[1:05:21] her now we got two people affected
[1:05:26] but she got to praying the woman that
[1:05:28] had to move she got to
[1:05:31] praying and she said Lord I ought not do
[1:05:33] that forgive me I didn't mean it and
[1:05:37] about that time the lady that was now in
[1:05:39] front that had resented her still turned
[1:05:41] around and said sister I'm sorry I
[1:05:44] shouldn't have done
[1:05:46] that and the two the husband and wife
[1:05:49] were
[1:05:50] sick there were the two that came just
[1:05:52] first came to me the one that just made
[1:05:54] the woman but those two were were sick
[1:05:57] and just a little bit after all of that
[1:06:00] was
[1:06:02] done I seen the angel of the Lord stand
[1:06:05] on them call them by name and heal them
[1:06:13] both and sent them back to their home

[1:06:19] again come on somebody isn't that worth
[1:06:22] saying Lord I'm sorry
[1:06:26] forgive me Lord I shouldn't acted like
[1:06:28] that I shouldn't have that in my heart
[1:06:29] amen because why that thing is sitting

[1:06:34] from visiting where you sit from
[1:06:37] visiting your Pew and healing your heart
[1:06:40] and healing your life and setting you
[1:06:42] free totally from that
[1:06:47] thing another
[1:06:51] place two months ago he said my church
[1:06:55] once Sunday morning Satan was doing
[1:06:57] something to try to attract the
[1:06:59] attention of the people there was an
[1:07:01] Englishman there by the name of way on
[1:07:04] his address you right all the way down
[1:07:06] he said I had a private interview told
[1:07:08] him I said Mr way you have heart trouble
[1:07:11] he even resented that I said what you
[1:07:13] come for me then why why why did you
[1:07:15] even come then so after a month after
[1:07:17] that he went to the doctor and the
[1:07:18] doctor told him you have a very bad
[1:07:20] heart so he come to the meeting one
[1:07:22] morning something was said here's a real
[1:07:25] hot headed Englishman you know had his
[1:07:27] wife a wonderful norian woman the nurse
[1:07:29] was sitting with him I said something
[1:07:32] and he resented what I said right
[1:07:35] quick and when he did they were standing
[1:07:38] on their feet and they were singing and
[1:07:39] when he did his head went back and his
[1:07:42] eyes just flipped back and his face went
[1:07:44] real red dark like that and he fell dead
[1:07:46] on the
[1:07:48] floor and the church went going on went
[1:07:51] to going on a bunch of people screaming
[1:07:52] I said sit down your train better than
[1:07:54] that just sit down
[1:07:56] and let God move and so his wife got
[1:07:59] down and tested it heart he was gone she
[1:08:01] began screaming I said sister wait just
[1:08:03] a minute till I can get out of the pull
[1:08:04] pit here we don't know what the father
[1:08:06] has planned I went down there he was
[1:08:08] just as stiff his eyes wasn't a it
[1:08:10] wasn't a put on his eyes were sticking
[1:08:12] right out like that back I couldn't feel
[1:08:14] no more heart than I could feel in that
[1:08:16] I said she said oh she begin to scream I
[1:08:19] said now just be careful easy you don't
[1:08:22] know what the Heavenly father's going to
[1:08:24] do
[1:08:25] maybe he did it for a purpose but I said
[1:08:28] because brother way was
[1:08:34] resenting and he said he and she said
[1:08:36] yeah he whispered to me that he was
[1:08:39] resenting what you had just said and I
[1:08:41] said he ought not have done that but I
[1:08:43] said Heavenly Father forgive brother wa
[1:08:45] for his error and I called for his
[1:08:47] Spirit to return and he said brother
[1:08:49] bradam and he was alive again see if
[1:08:53] anything gets out of the way just keep
[1:08:55] keep quiet right amen just keep quiet
[1:08:58] see it happens so many times when the
[1:09:00] church gets so tore up and then you end
[1:09:03] up grieving the Holy
[1:09:06] Spirit come on somebody that's what we
[1:09:09] got to do when we see something
[1:09:10] happening it's not get all tore up about
[1:09:12] it just stay Reverend and stay quiet and
[1:09:15] say God I don't know what your plans are
[1:09:17] I don't know how you're going to work
[1:09:18] this but I know you're going to work it
[1:09:20] For Your Glory and for my good therefore
[1:09:23] I can rest in that
[1:09:30] but we're speaking on faith over
[1:09:36] resentment you know in 2 Kings 4 and
[1:09:38] verse
[1:09:40] 8 reads about a woman don't know her
[1:09:44] name we know her as the shunamite
[1:09:48] woman doesn't she's never given a name
[1:09:50] but she's given this and I thought I I I
[1:09:53] caught this today again a fresh I guess
[1:09:56] said it fell on a day that Elisha passed
[1:09:59] through shunum where was a great
[1:10:07] woman didn't say her
[1:10:09] name her name wasn't what was important
[1:10:12] what was important was what was on the
[1:10:14] inside of
[1:10:16] her why why what how could he call her a
[1:10:20] great woman was it because she had
[1:10:22] certain statue in the community maybe
[1:10:24] maybe she had some money maybe but I
[1:10:26] believe as we read through these
[1:10:27] scriptures he call the scripture calls
[1:10:29] her that because of her
[1:10:34] faith a great woman and she constrained
[1:10:38] him to eat bread and so it was that that
[1:10:42] as of as he passed by he turned in
[1:10:45] thither to eat bread and she said unto
[1:10:47] her husband behold now I perceive that
[1:10:49] this a holy man of God which passes by
[1:10:52] us continually so it didn't take her
[1:10:54] long to be able to look past the the
[1:10:56] veil of Flesh and she said this ain't
[1:10:58] just no ordinary man this is a holy man
[1:11:01] of God so this is why the scripture
[1:11:03] would call her great because there was
[1:11:05] attachment to her of the
[1:11:09] Supernatural and and so it said let us
[1:11:11] make a little chamber I pray thee on the
[1:11:13] wall and let us set for them a bed and a
[1:11:16] table and a stool and a Candlestick and
[1:11:18] it shall be when he comes to us he shall
[1:11:20] turn in thither and it fell on the day
[1:11:22] that he came thither he turned into the
[1:11:24] chamber and laid there and said to Gesa
[1:11:27] servant call This shunamite And when he
[1:11:29] called her she stood before him and he
[1:11:31] said say now unto her behold thou has
[1:11:33] been careful for us with all care what
[1:11:36] is to be done to
[1:11:37] thee so what what what can I repay you
[1:11:41] with and we know gesi he said Master she
[1:11:43] don't have a child she she she don't
[1:11:45] have a child and her husband is old and
[1:11:47] he said call her and when he called her
[1:11:49] she stood in the door and he said about
[1:11:51] this season according to the time of
[1:11:53] life Thou shalt embrace a son and she
[1:11:56] said nay my Lord thou thou man of God do
[1:11:59] not lie to thy handmaid or don't give me
[1:12:02] some false hope I've been hoping for a
[1:12:05] long time he said this ain't no false
[1:12:07] hope amen the woman conceived and bear
[1:12:10] son and the season that Elijah Elisha
[1:12:13] had said un her according to the time of
[1:12:19] life brother brand talks about
[1:12:22] this talks about this woman
[1:12:26] preparing a place for a promise to be
[1:12:30] fulfilled look she could have been
[1:12:32] resented
[1:12:34] resentful well I ain't had a baby why
[1:12:36] should I take care of anybody
[1:12:39] else God hadn't given me a child so why
[1:12:42] should I care for anything else becomes
[1:12:45] resentful she could have had that but
[1:12:46] that wasn't her character that wasn't
[1:12:48] who she was something about her amen
[1:12:51] want to prepare a place for a prophet
[1:12:54] not knowing She Was preparing a place to
[1:12:56] receive a
[1:13:00] promise amen and see God knew this and
[1:13:03] he was there behind the scenes making
[1:13:05] preparations for God knows all things
[1:13:08] he's omnipotent he's omnicient he knows
[1:13:10] all things he knows exactly how to
[1:13:12] prepare you for a certain time and
[1:13:14] season in your
[1:13:20] life and how that he warns his people
[1:13:23] and gets things ready you know like this
[1:13:26] like the destruction he prepared people
[1:13:28] for the destruction to overcome it Noah
[1:13:30] his day but like he's getting ready
[1:13:31] people today he got that woman ready he
[1:13:35] says watch what that little bed did
[1:13:40] later she prepared a
[1:13:43] bed Elijah Elisha laid on the bed and
[1:13:46] while he was laying on that
[1:13:48] bed the the spirit of God fell in his
[1:13:51] heart and the anointing fell on him and
[1:13:54] he began to speak about her
[1:13:58] needs now we know the story goes on and
[1:14:02] and you know that was a great story she
[1:14:04] received a child in an old age and it
[1:14:06] seemed like you know amazing situation
[1:14:08] and how wonderful this is working out
[1:14:10] and how great this is his but about a
[1:14:13] few years later this same child is out
[1:14:16] in the field with his father and he
[1:14:19] falls
[1:14:22] dead screams you know about my head my
[1:14:24] head Maybe his son stroke or whatever
[1:14:26] and They Carried him to his mother and
[1:14:28] when she took him and brought him they
[1:14:29] brought him to his mother he sat on her
[1:14:31] knees till noon and then
[1:14:33] died wow that's reason enough to have
[1:14:38] resentment can you believe this he gave
[1:14:40] me this promise and then it only was ful
[1:14:43] it was fulfilled only for this I I I I
[1:14:46] didn't even get to watch him go through
[1:14:47] school I I didn't get to watch him do
[1:14:49] this I didn't get and all these thoughts
[1:14:51] are going through could go be going and
[1:14:53] resentment could start building and
[1:14:54] bitter bitterness and if she would
[1:14:57] allowed it she would have never received
[1:14:59] this son back to life
[1:15:04] again and here she is holding this
[1:15:07] little boy and he dies and she went up
[1:15:10] and she didn't complain she didn't cry
[1:15:12] she just went up and laid him back on
[1:15:13] that
[1:15:15] bed what was she doing reminding God you
[1:15:18] gave me the
[1:15:20] promise and you're good enough to keep
[1:15:22] your promise and She lays him red back
[1:15:25] on the place amen the bed where the word
[1:15:28] was spoke to her the word was given to
[1:15:31] her and the word became fruit inside of
[1:15:38] her she gets her a a donkey and she
[1:15:41] begins to ride out and go search after
[1:15:43] the man of God CU she knows that's the
[1:15:45] only help she can have in this time and
[1:15:48] she goes out and she finds him and the
[1:15:50] man of God sees her coming he tells his
[1:15:51] servant go to her you know and go go go
[1:15:54] see what's going on
[1:15:55] and he came and he said behold the shite
[1:15:57] woman he said run now pray thee and meet
[1:15:59] her and say unto her is it well with
[1:16:02] thee is it well with thy husband is it
[1:16:04] well with the
[1:16:06] child he covered all the
[1:16:09] bases is it well with thee is it well
[1:16:12] with your husband is it well with a
[1:16:15] child well she had an opportunity right
[1:16:18] there she you know wanted to go that one
[1:16:21] road yeah you know you gave him the
[1:16:24] promise but now laying dead but that's
[1:16:26] not what she said she said it is well
[1:16:29] that's
[1:16:30] right why because she was a great woman
[1:16:33] of faith that can overcome the
[1:16:35] resentment that no doubt tried to rise
[1:16:38] up on the inside of her and bitterness
[1:16:40] that tried to set in and confusion to
[1:16:43] try to go there and try to push down and
[1:16:45] keep her from receiving the promise of
[1:16:53] God but her resp response was it is
[1:16:59] well how can you say it is well brother
[1:17:01] Timothy I when you got all things all
[1:17:03] these things going because his word says
[1:17:05] it as
[1:17:07] well that's what she was speaking the
[1:17:10] word it is
[1:17:12] well well yeah I got sicknesses I'm
[1:17:14] facing it is
[1:17:16] well well I got tests I got to go
[1:17:18] through and the doctors don't know it is
[1:17:22] well come on somebody why can you say
[1:17:25] that cuz you have prepared a praise for
[1:17:27] the
[1:17:28] promise but see the heart amen where God
[1:17:31] wants to bring that promise that's why
[1:17:32] Satan is attacking it so much and trying
[1:17:34] to put bitterness there and resentment
[1:17:36] there because he's trying to feel that
[1:17:39] bed full of everything else so that the
[1:17:43] promise cannot be laid there and be
[1:17:45] brought to life in your
[1:17:51] heart the baby's dead Len L what the
[1:17:55] prophet of God said what good did a baby
[1:17:57] do for her if God gave her the baby and
[1:18:00] then he takes it away from
[1:18:04] her so you know what she did he said if
[1:18:07] she would have been just a lukewarm
[1:18:09] church member she would have got bitter
[1:18:12] right
[1:18:16] then but being that she wasn't she was
[1:18:19] blessed of God cuz she had made
[1:18:21] preparations when that happened she took
[1:18:23] the baby and took it back out the door
[1:18:26] down the street around the corner down
[1:18:27] to Elijah's room and laid him on
[1:18:29] Elisha's bed what a place to put
[1:18:33] him what a place to put here amen why
[1:18:36] what a place to put amen that the word
[1:18:38] of God is upon a heart that can receive
[1:18:42] it a heart that is open to it a heart
[1:18:45] that can say yes Lord it may look like
[1:18:47] all hell is against me but it is well it
[1:18:50] may look like my body is failing but it
[1:18:53] is well it may look look like everything
[1:18:55] is Flowing away and all kind of Trials
[1:18:57] and troubles but it is
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:07] well and we know the end of the story in
[1:19:09] that portion she received this child
[1:19:14] back to
[1:19:17] life God doesn't forget his promises
[1:19:25] I say it again God does not forget his
[1:19:28] promises if he said it it's going to
[1:19:31] come to
[1:19:35] pass if he promised you a child it's
[1:19:38] going to come to
[1:19:39] pass if he promised you healing is going
[1:19:42] to come to
[1:19:44] pass it's in his word but if she would
[1:19:47] allowed bitterness to come there and
[1:19:50] resentment she would have never received
[1:19:52] that son back to life again that's right
[1:19:55] no she would have been put him in the
[1:19:57] grave and it story been over and
[1:19:58] finished but you know her story wasn't
[1:20:00] quite
[1:20:03] finished we can read in 2 Kings 8 and
[1:20:06] verse one said then spake Elisha unto
[1:20:08] the woman whose son he had restored to
[1:20:11] life saying arise and go thou in thine
[1:20:14] household and sojourn sojourn
[1:20:17] wheresoever thou can soour sojourn for
[1:20:20] the Lord hath called for a famine famine
[1:20:23] and it shall also come upon the the land
[1:20:25] seven years and the woman arose and did
[1:20:28] after the saying of the man of God and
[1:20:30] she went with her household and
[1:20:31] sojourned in the land of the Philistines
[1:20:34] seven years and it came to pass in the
[1:20:36] end of the seven years that the woman
[1:20:38] returned out of the land of the
[1:20:39] Philistines and she went forth to cry
[1:20:42] unto the king for her house and for her
[1:20:44] land for her house and for her land and
[1:20:47] the King talked with gesi the servant of
[1:20:50] the man of God saying tell me I pray
[1:20:52] thee all the great things of Elisha has
[1:20:54] done and it came to pass as he was
[1:20:57] telling the king How He restored a dead
[1:21:00] body to life behold the woman with the
[1:21:03] son that had been restored to life cried
[1:21:05] to the king for her
[1:21:07] house come on somebody cried to the king
[1:21:11] for her house and for her land and gazah
[1:21:14] said my Lord oh King this is the woman
[1:21:17] and this is her son whom Elisha restored
[1:21:20] to life and when the king asked the
[1:21:22] woman she told him so the king K
[1:21:24] appointed to Earth certain officers
[1:21:26] saying restore all that was
[1:21:29] hers come on somebody restore all that
[1:21:33] was hers and all to the fruit of the
[1:21:35] field since the day she left the
[1:21:38] land and even unto now Hallelujah I
[1:21:42] think about that tonight church we are a
[1:21:45] people we are a woman that has the
[1:21:48] son we have the presence of the son why
[1:21:51] because we have believed and we've laid
[1:21:53] upon the promise of God and we have come
[1:21:56] back to our place of inheritance yes
[1:21:58] it's been a s a famine for seven years
[1:22:01] or seven Church ages but we're going to
[1:22:03] receive the fruit of all the church ages
[1:22:06] we're going to receive the fruit of it
[1:22:08] all why cuz we cast down our resentment
[1:22:11] we cast down our bitterness we cast down
[1:22:14] our unforgiveness and we say yes Lord it
[1:22:17] is
[1:22:18] [Applause]
[1:22:21] well Hallelujah if she would not had the
[1:22:24] son she would not have had her
[1:22:28] land but because of her
[1:22:31] faith she
[1:22:34] overcame and God the king granted her
[1:22:39] back everything that was taken from her
[1:22:42] her houses her
[1:22:45] land and he knew the count of every
[1:22:48] piece of fruit
[1:22:54] come on somebody you want restoration to
[1:22:57] start in your house then stop
[1:23:00] resenting you want restoration to start
[1:23:03] then stop the
[1:23:06] unforgiveness come on whether it's
[1:23:08] toward somebody or God just let it go
[1:23:10] and say God I want that son in my
[1:23:13] house I want the presence of God in my
[1:23:16] house I want God to come in and so when
[1:23:19] I come before the king he sees that I
[1:23:21] have the
[1:23:22] token that I have the right to this land
[1:23:25] that I have the right to my inheritance
[1:23:27] I have the right to what God has given
[1:23:33] me that's B
