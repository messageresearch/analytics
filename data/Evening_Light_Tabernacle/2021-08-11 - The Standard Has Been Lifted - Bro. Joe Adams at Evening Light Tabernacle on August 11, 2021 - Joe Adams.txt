[Applause] [Music] oh [Music] ohio [Music] amen the mighty god we serve sing hallelujah thank you lord for all that you've done you sustained us you you've been with us in our darkest hour our lowest moments he's remained faithful and i just like to take a few seconds just this evening on behalf of the ministry team i know that all our ministry with the exception of me is a pruitt or related to the pruist but i want to say thank you for your outpouring of love and support to the family the pruitt family and the butts family during this time not only did they suffer loss but we suffered a loss we suffered a very special person and our family of course has kind of been more i would say acclimated to death as we just had the death of jessica's brother and then just a few years ago her dad so we know what it means to grieve we know what it means to suffer loss but we also know the joy of knowing that there's others that love you and that care about you and that show their support send you a text call you on the phone bring you a meal whatever it is they're just there and i tell you those moments don't go unnoticed they mean a lot they mean a lot to the family they mean a lot to but this is a great church and uh i couldn't see the family i couldn't see the butt family my family us serving god anywhere else but right here and even like tabernacle as we see the times of the ages drawing to a close i'm glad that we have believers true genuine honest born-again sons and daughters of god to fight this fight with you're we're in a special place church don't take any service for granted don't take any brother or sister for granted god has placed us here together to do battle and i look around i see great men of god i see great sisters and daughters of god i couldn't dare wouldn't dare want to fight this battle with anybody else so now that we've suffered a loss you know what the next best thing to do is just strap on our boots and be determined to fight be determined to fight we're not going to back down we're not going to give up we're not going to give in we're going to draw our swords and we're going to fight another day because we're going to face another battle and god's promise to give us another victory so we just thank the lord for that let's just go to him in prayer this evening father we do thank you lord for this church not just the building lord the four walls the fellowship hall all the other amenities that are here but father i thank you for each and every person that calls us their home church i thank you lord for their prayers and their support to the ministry and to the musicians and to what they bring to this local body lord as they begin to pull on the gift of god god it's what changes the atmosphere in the service the ministers only have a part to play lord but it's the it's those that are listening it's those that are pulling it's us as a collective body or putting our shoulders to the will and god and just giving our all for the service of the lord so i just asked tonight god i ask that you put the words in my mouth and you'd put the anointing on their ears to hear exactly what you would have us to say tonight god as i looked at this thought several weeks ago and just really didn't see the inspiration or feel the inspiration behind it and set it aside and lord just this week you rekindled that inspiration so father we just commit this service to you tonight we commit every believer here and lord we especially lift up the pruitt butts family tonight father know that they're still grieving and we just want them to know lord that they're loved and they're not in this battle alone we've all are in this together tonight but we have a promise we have a consolation that you said lord you would be there you'd be with us even in us to the very end so father we're leaning upon you tonight drawing our strength from you and we ask that you bless this service lord and we thank you for this time you've given us and just ask that you just move in our hearts moving our lives speak as you will lord in jesus name amen if you would have your bibles tonight we're going to look here in isaiah 59. isaiah 59 and we'll start at verse 17 and read through verse 21 collectively and before we go there i want to read a scripture out of isaiah 35 as i was in the back and just nerved up for the service and you know you you it follows your lot to come behind such a special lady and a wonderful memorial service just the other day and you know you begin to stumble what do you say to the family what do you say to the church body after suffering such a great loss and as i as i was flipping through and just kind of fell open to this isaiah 35 and verse 4 it says say to them that are a fearful heart be strong and fear not your god will come with vengeance even god with the recompense he will come and save you i don't know about you with that comfort of me because i'm a ball of nerves right now just because i know what's was to be spoken i know kind of how i'm going to deliver this at least i feel it in my spirit this is not going to be what i would call my typical danny rooster as uh sister karen would call me running around running around running around but just kind of try to lay the word in there no brother aaron i'm not gonna teach we're all uh relieved tonight but isaiah 59 and verse 17 he says for he put on the on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgressions in jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon me my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the lord from henceforth and evermore god bless you you can have your seats tonight i just want to take a few moments this evening and we will speak to you on the standard has been lifted we have heard this and we have quoted this when the enemy comes in like a flood like a flood like a flood like a flood god's going to raise a standard raise a standard razor standard so i just kind of want to look at that tonight and i'll get to my my thought later on in this message but i just want to kind of build it and coming out of israel in the church brother branham will say no wonder christianity can't even lift up a standard it's because not because christ is not able but because the people won't do it so notice where he's putting the responsibility of lifting the standard it's not that christ won't do it he said the people won't do it the message is ready the power of god is sufficient men and women are scared to break out yonder into those fears before god and dare to trust him and take his word you know if you go around like brother aaron and i in different ministries you go to different churches and you find some churches they're afraid of the supernatural they're they're timid against the presence of the lord but yet because they're not they don't maybe they don't see it maybe it's not there in their church often enough but we find they become scared and they are scared to reach out into the supernatural break out yawning to the fears of god and dare to trust god dare to say god do what your word declares you're going to do and hold god responsible for his word all you got to do is remind god of what he said in his word so we find though in isaiah 59 and verse 17 and i love this because it shows what kind of god we serve he's not a passive god he's not a deletorio grandpa sitting back just gonna do nothing waiting on this but the bible says he puts on righteousness as a breastplate he puts on a helmet of salvation on his head and he puts on garments of vengeance god is dressing himself to do battle not to do battle for his own benefit but he is preparing to repay your enemy with fury he's really he's ready to to repay your adversary that's transgressed you he's going to pour out recompense upon recompense upon recompense and we find that the god that we serve is not a passive god but he's a warrior god and not only is he a warrior god in heaven but he's a warrior god for your need for your situation for your trial for the darkness that you're going through he's a warrior god and i want you to know that he's got the helmet of salvation on he's got the breastplate on but not only that he's clothed himself in vengeance he is ready in this hour to pour out upon your adversary and raise the standard against your foe to lift up the standard against your accuser our god is able he's willing and he's ready tonight to do battle with your enemy [Applause] so we know but the bible will tell us when the enemy comes in a lot of times we get fretful so what if he comes how many of you have never faced the enemy all right good i'm on good ground then but we finally isaiah 59 that when the enemy comes in not if he comes in but when he comes in and certainly he's going to come and he's relentless in his efforts to warp the plan of god and the movement of the spirit of god and if he can just get somebody now preoccupied tonight with what you're going to do tomorrow then he's already defeated you in the service tonight so he's coming so you got to keep your mind you got to keep your mind sharp under that anointing in the spirit because he's coming in to thwart the movement of the spirit no matter how that may be or it's not just with sickness not just with some major trial but even in the service get you preoccupied with what oh school's opening up this week so i got to go get my pencil sharpeners and i got to go do this and i got to do that and i got to get my supplies and your minds all wrapped around what you got to do tomorrow and you're missing the movement of the spirit he's here tonight to raise a standard for you so keep your mind in tune with the spirit tonight but we find the devil loves to buffet you every chance that he gets i like how paul will tell us and we know in second corinthians 12 he says lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of satan to buffet me and that word buffett means to beat with a fist so i want some of you young boys come up here and let brother aaron beat you with his fist who said no well then we'll let brother johnny he's got bigger guns anyway hey the looking at those guns will make me run but we find the devil is there to beat with the fist to buff it to my tree to treat with excessive force to punish he's not here passing out lollipops he's not here like my mother does every service when when she comes to church giving my little daughter a bag of candy that's not how he works no he's giving you a bag of fist he's he's buffing in you he's punishing you he's using excessive force and he's causing affliction upon affliction and the problem that god will say in the message experiences he said the messenger of the devil he said that word buffett there means to blow after blow after blow after blow after blow after blow how many times you feel like man you can't get out of one trial without being right back into another trial and if you're not really got one foot in the trial he's there knocking you out of this trial into that trial he sees everything you do every time you wake up you're in one blow after another blow after another blow i say thanks be to god tonight he said what do you mean thanks i said what that means to me is that the devil don't have you if he's blowing after you and hit you here and hit you there that goes to show that he don't have you and he's just trying to knock you off your pedestal he's trying to knock you down and keep the movement of the spirit of god away from you so there was a messenger of the devil to buffett paul blow after blow after blow and the prophet of god would say and i will admit that god permits satan sometimes to chastise us that's true but when that chastisement is through you come back to god god your father will heal you and that's right so don't only apply it on healing the supernatural deliverance but apply it on every aspect of your life whatever you're going through and he's blowing and he's hitting and he's coming against you you know that you can come back to god because god is always there and god is going to fight your battle god is going to raise that standard and god will heal god will deliver god will see you through whatever you're going through in the message testimony he said the theme of my revivals is this declaring to the world that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and through every critic and every type of criticism that i know that satan has led me with these statements and i'm giving jesus christ he has done everything that i know can be done speaking of to try to overthrow it but every time god has brought it out triumphant and won the victory every time he says check it test it by the government agents everywhere through nations every time i have a thorn in the flesh an angel of satan who knows or who follows and tries to buff it or beset but he's defeated in every case by the holy spirit and god come out triumphant winning hundreds and thousands to christ in that time so church tonight no matter what you're going through no matter what you're facing the god that we serve the god that declared that i will be with you the god that said here say unto them do not be a fearful heart but be strong fear not behold your god will come and when he comes he's coming with vengeance he's coming with force he's coming to do what to recompense your adversary for what he has put you through it doesn't go unnoticed god is taking notice of what the devil has done to you and god is raising a standard against it god is elevating the bar to tell you you're not alone my child you're not alone my daughter god knows your need and god is here to raise you up and to lift you up above the situation and notice not one time has our god ever been defeated oh it may look humanly what we saw we believed and we prayed for our sister karen and it looked maybe human that god felt was god didn't fail us god had a better plan god had a better plan let me tell you i trade places right now because where she's at is where we long to be where she's at is where we're headed to but it may look like well she went down in the feet no she didn't go down in the feet because the bible tells us faith is our victory if you look in first john 5 and 4 it says for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and his brother tim so poetically put it the other night or the other day when he preached she died a long time ago when he was going through the church age study that's where karen pruitt died and that's where each of us have to get to that place where we die die out to our sin sinful selves die out to our unbelief die out to everything and let god make us anew so that we can have the same testimony so that we can live up to the same level the standard that has been set before us so we find faith is our victory in isaiah 54 and verse 17 the bible tells us so plainly no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shall condemn now how many of you when you're faced with trial do you remember this scripture not very many of us do we man you guys got hit and beat by the devil's fist and he's buffeting you and buffing you the last thing you can think about is no weapon all you're trying to do is get this weapon off of me but we find here it may appear that satan is women the winning the battle that is weapon against you whatever that may be is triumphant and it's beating you in it's taking its toll on you but no weapon that is formed against you is going to prosper no weapon that satan has put upon you tonight is going to be successful because the god that you serve and the god that's called you and the god that's anointed you and the god that's filled you is raising up a standard tonight he's lifting the bar the anointing pouring out his holy spirit pouring out the supernatural to let you know you're not forsaken little church you're not just some beat down little nobody but you're my pride you're the apple of my eye and i'm gonna do whatever i've got to do to pull you through it and god will do that and that right quick god's not gonna leave you stranded fighting your enemy no weapon formed against you will prosper the weapon of brain bleach tried and tried and tried several times to take the life of karen pruitt but it was not successful brain bleeds didn't take her god took her and called her home brain bleeds may have tried to her life and humiliate her and put her in a hospital room but she never once recanted her faith she never once turned her back on god so what does that tell you it tells devil you don't have enough in the midst of the darkest tower in the midst of the lowest moment she remained faithful the pruitt family remained faithful the church remained faithful we remain faithful to what to the call of god to the word of god so no weapon tonight that is pointed at you will be successful against you the bible will tell us in hebrews the hall of faith chapter 11 speaking of abel and he naked noah and abraham and sarah and verse 13 it says all these dies in faith tell god in faith not having received the promise not having received but having seen it notice now having seen it afar off and they were persuaded of them notice what they did next and they embraced them they embraced the promises they embraced the word of god died in faith having not received but were fully persuaded and embraced the promise is when they woke up that day god was going to move and we find here in hebrews 11 and verse 33 who through faith notice now let me go back to 32 excuse me and what shall i say more for the time shall fail me to tell of gideon and barack and samson and jephthah of david also and samuel and the prophets notice who through faith they subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of wickedness we're made strong wax violent and fight turn the flight of the armies of the aliens women received their dead rays to life again wow don't you aren't you glad we got that in our heritage man that means every day when i wake up it's going to be like that man i'm going to subdue kingdoms today i'm going to write righteous i'm going to attain the promise man let a lie roar against me brother and i'm going to shut his mouth up but if you keep on reading others we're tortured that's right not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay more over a bonds and imprisonments they were stoned they were sewn asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wondered about in sheepskins and ghost skins being destitute afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and indians and in caves of the earth and all these having attained a good report through faith receive not the promise and yet god having provided some better things for us in this hour the finality of all history of all time god has provided us a better word than they ever had in any other age because now not only do we have all the problems of it the previous sages we got all the blessings of the previous ages compounded down upon this sage so not only do you fight one of the greatest battles but you get the greatest reward so we find here god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect what am i telling you i'm telling you tomorrow you make up you may wake up and you may subdue lions you may subdue kingdoms or you may wake up and you may be wander around in the mountain or on the deserts you may be wandering in dms you may be destitute you may be afflicted but it doesn't matter because god was with those that were victorious and god was with those that were in trial god never left them god was always there and let me tell you a little church evening like god is waiting on you and they are waiting on you god is raising a banner and you are that banner you are the standard and leave the light you are the standard and laodicea god is lifting up the bar to tell you that someday there's going to be a crowning time there's going to be a homecoming time god's gonna take his little bride home because somebody is waiting the champion's on the other side they're waiting on us they're waiting on you to do what to fulfill your role to do your responsibility don't you worry about what you're going through know that god is raising the standard in the source god is elevating the word in this hour job 14 and verse 1. and some of us feel like this many days man that is born of a woman is of a few days in full trouble feel like every day you wake up trouble go down to the store trouble go to walmart trouble sometimes you even come to church trouble at least trouble on the way to church sometimes it's troubled in church and we find her adam was not born of a woman and adam lived 930 years but the atom that was born from woman was three score and ten few days just a few days and adam had trouble this adam our adam we have trouble there's days that we face lions and then there's days we subdue kingdoms we have good great days mountain top experience then we have our valleys we have our moments where we sink real low and when you get to that low point you got to know that the property god would say be certain of god when he lays there and he's quiet and he fails to move or appears that he doesn't move appears that he's not listening you got to be certain as a believer that god is there so we find man that is born of a woman we have difficult times on the earth because we bypass the original plan of god due to the fall we bypassed our theophanies and now we're here as believers and we're full of trouble some of you you know i'm not even going to ask you because some of you live in a down moment you gotta find some people that are always negative you got some people that are always high you know i wish i was that high person all the time thankfully i'm kind of balanced don't laugh if you're honest you'd be right there with me we're on the same roller coaster a roller coaster of life and some of us never get off the ground though i ain't getting known i'm scared i ain't getting no no that's the way no supernatural huh not me don't you believe that conspiracy stuff that coronavirus was created over there and we just live on conspiracy and we and negative negative negative negative god is here to raise a standard his word this message is a standard by which he's lifting up to a people and let me tell you if god has raised that bar for our people god is going to raise the people to meet that bar god's not going to set that bar to you young people you young boys can't attain to it there's going to be young boys that overcome pornography there's going to be young girls that overcome fear and depression and suicide anxiety there's going to be people sons and daughters of god in this age in this church that's going to raise up to the bar and not only we're going to raise to the bar but our bodies are going to be changed and we're going to go past the bar we're going to go past the standard that was built here for three score and ten because these bodies one day are gonna take a change there'll be no more memorial services there'll be no more tears shed psalms 34 and verse 19 as you turn there we find though that we bypass our theophany and we as believers we have good days we have bad days but nevertheless god has always been there and we know that satan is going to attack he's going to assault us each and every day but thanks be to god we have a savior we have a redeemer we have a healer we have a warrior god that fights for us what we find here the bible will tell us many are the afflictions of the righteous so don't think when you're being buffeted that you're the only one you're not the only one join the club but i tell you what what better club to be in when our captain is going before us the captain of the host of the lord who's never lost a battle who's never lost a subject who's never lost a believer oh church what better company amen many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord capital l capital hold capital r capital d jehovah delivereth him out of them all that word affliction there means dysfunctional don't raise your hand because some of us come from dysfunctional families dysfunctional lives we got dysfunctional things that we have been through but we find the word affliction it means dysfunctional wrong evil wicked evil distress misery injury calamity bad unpleasant and evil giving pain unhappiness and misery and we find that from the scriptures man is of a few days and full of affliction full of misery full of heartache full of distress and then you know to cap it all off satan is there punching you man i'm painting a pretty picture arnold but god said when the enemy comes in no matter how he comes whether he comes in as a flood or whether he comes in at all god is raising the standard god has lifted the standard even like tabernacle we have been elevated not that this church is to be the model of all churches in the message but we're no longer on the back woods in the piney woods of louisiana back there where nobody could find us what god is doing in the natural he's also doing in the supernatural god is elevating a people god is elevating not just here in the flesh but also in the supernatural god is elevating a people that's going to attain to the word for this hour we're going to get there we're going to meet there not one of us not one promise is going to go unfulfilled not one promise of god is going to go unacclaimed by the children of god we are going to acclaim every promise because god has granted us he wouldn't tell us it if he wasn't there to provide it for us and if god has set the standard then god is going to make sure that he equips the people to achieve the standard verbatim would tell us this in gifts he said and just as i start to do something for god then expect all guns and he'll turn right on you all right so we got a new family at the church get ready god ain't gonna make it pleasant but he's brought you here to raise the standard so when you make your mind young person to serve god all guns in hell are going to be trained on you he says now i pray for me because and he says now pray for me because i need i realize that every time faith sets itself up the devil turns every gun and hell right on it like that you see so it makes it pretty hard man he's got iphones he's got widgets and gadgets man you say you're going to serve god you came to the altar and you got victory over and all of a sudden you go back the next day and you're all by yourself mama and i went to walmart to buy some groceries you pulled that little phone out and you don't found your little widget way to get in there and look up some bikinis and this that and the other all guns in hell are trained on you trained on you are you saying living what you're proclaiming and if you're not it's an easy fix it's called dying out he says now that's right he's a brother let me go back and go tell he said because the message is right because god sent the message because god sent the messenger no doubt that every gun in hell will be firing at him that's right he'll stumble and fall and get up and shake his head and go on so you may stumble tonight you may fall tonight but don't stay in the fallen condition get up shake your head and get back into the battle and know that god is on your side know that god is drawing you know that god is pulling you know that god wants more for you than just drifting through life and being a piece of driftwood hanging up on every little cooking corner that you can go by no god is calling you to be a real article a real son and daughter of god be a little voice in this hour if he said in the word or he said through a prophet that this bride is going to be the final voice to the final aid and somebody's got to raise up to be the voice and begin to speak what god's word declares that means that down with pornography down with fear down with anxiety down with depression down with anything that's unlike god and not with the word of god up with the supernatural i would just speaking in tongues off with the presence of god off with the dancing in the spirit off with the body change up with a rapture i said take yourself lord take us up in the fears of god take us up into the heavenly places that's what we're testing the sin that's our position that's our place in the body god lift us up raise the standard tonight for us as your believer in the message testimony now as i told y'all before i'm a lover and a fighter brother johnny i used to love to fight but you know what god didn't take the fight out of me he just channels it and he says here in the message testimony you got to fight for every inch of ground that you have every man in here that's born again of the spirit of god knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground toe to mark with satan isn't that right he says friends this is not a picnic you go and you find a nice pretty spot in the shade shake out your little blanket because heaven forbid you get grass on you and you get the little basket you start pulling out your food oh let's say grace ain't no picnic i don't know where you're living but i'm not picnicking it's a stinking battle he says now he said it's not a picnic this is a battleground see we never come here to eat cookies you thought brother joe was just the only one huh but the prophet of god we didn't come here to eat cookies no we're in a battle so if you don't want to fight go home if you're afraid of the battle go home like get in send them on home because what god's going to do he's going to do with true born-again believers god wants those that are dedicated to the call god wants those that are not wimpy god wants those that are determined no matter what they face who they face how they face it they are not afraid they're in a battleground and they're prepared to battle he said notice now he says now he's promised to meet you on every battleground that's right and he will bless so then what's your hope or where's your hope see i've seen many temptations tell me one christian let me go back excuse me the message's redemption by judgment he says you'll get to a place you say well brother bill i have so many temptations how many of you got many temptations well i got one believer here the rest of y'all are faking it tonight huh we face temptations every day he says oh i got so many temptations he says tell me one christian that doesn't have temptation we never come to a picnic we come to a battleground we're out here in a fight to fight the enemy why sure we don't put on our armor just to be looked at you know sometimes i play around i'm goofy yeah i get it sometimes with just me and my kids i put my suit on man i start walking the dog y'all don't know what that means do you i think i'm some runway model but what he's telling us that we ain't putting this suit on to walk some runway no he's dressed you with this word to fight he's prepared you and equipped you and he's dressed you in the best that he could put you in which is his word and it's not just to sit in the mirror oh i look like a christian i got long hair i don't wear i don't wear splits i don't do this i don't do that my pants don't sag i got a nice look my haircut is right i look right no he's not concerned about that what he's concerned about are you fighting are you in fight mode he's given you the word to dress yourself to prepare yourself to be victorious while you're in the battle you know that the united states army when they when a young man goes into the army and he's in boot camp and they put a 90 pound back pack on him and he's got all this stuff in his pack and you just think poor little mama's going by little johnny he's gonna die he's gonna kill him he's got that pack on he's got combat boots on and look at that stupid little shovel what is he how what kind of hole is he gonna dig with this but you know everything that's in that pack the army knows exactly what that soldier needs to survive if that soldier is out there and he ain't got no food in that pack as mres he's got enough to last him weeks if it calls for it and i'm telling you then god has prepared his sons and his daughters in this hour you may feel like you're taking a heavy load and that pack on your back it's weighting you down well let me tell you a church like god knows what you have need of that trial that you're going through what is god doing god is shaping you into a mighty warrior god is allowing that to vote to mold you and to shape you for the battle because we are in a battle and let me tell you i plan on being victorious i can't stand losing and i didn't get in this battle to lose but i got in this battle with brother aaron brother tim brother timothy and you sons and daughters of god to be victorious god has called us to be winners god has called us to be overcomers and more than conquerors don't lay your sword down don't throw that pack off say thank you lord i got my pack now help me hold it help me shoulder the load help me keep focused help me foot keep pushing forward lord guide my steps hold my hand don't leave me back here god lift me up another inch i'm prepared to fight first corinthians 10 and verse 3. but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able to bear know that that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way of an escape that you may be able to bear see god doesn't leave you where you are god raises the standard against the enemy so that you're victorious and no matter what battlefront you're facing you're going to be victorious see we have a promise we have a promise that there's many temptations there's many afflictions but he will deliver out of them all we may go by the way of the grave but it does not mean that the enemy was victorious it means that god had another plan for your life god knows the number of days he knows the number of breasts you're going to take he knows the number of beats your heart is going to beat and god knows and he's equipped you to face every trial every battle every sickness everything you're going through god has equipped us in this hour what other age has had the most glorious message that we have today this is a translation message and god is about to translate sons and daughters of god he said christians sometimes in the messenger's redemption by judgment christians sometimes look down up they're looked down upon they fun up but we come as a warrior we come sprinkled in the blood the old rugged cross going before us the morning star lighting up the way why we're on the road somewhere don't care what the world says well it's what god said the field belongs to us god said so we're on the road if we get knocked out of the battle here at this earthly earthly tabernacle is gone we got another one already waiting there's nothing to be scared about and we find in romans 8 and verse 31 says what shall we say to these things if god be for us who can be against us oh let when you wake up in the morning won't you quote that scripture to the devil if you're against me this wonder why do i care because god is for me this morning god is my help god is my hope god is my state he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not also with him freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifies who is it that condemned it it is christ that die day rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us and my probably one of my favorite scriptures who shall separate us who what what trial what spirit what demon possession or oppression no matter what you're going through who shall be able to separate us from the love of god shall tribulation shall tribulation shall distress persecution famine nakedness peril sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed that word killed there means we're exposed to death we endure sufferings equivalent to dying every day all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter but nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor present things present no things to come nor height nor death nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus though we are exposed to death though we endure sufferings of equivalent that are equivalent to dying yet you're more than a conqueror i said you're more than a conqueror you look in the mirror when you get up and you see a frail body you see a battle-scarred weary soul but god sees more than a conqueror because he's a mighty warrior god sees somebody that he's implanted his seed in and no matter what they face who they face when they face how they face they are going to be victorious that's what god sees so the battle may rage but church you'll not be defeated nothing can separate us from his love no nothing can separate us from his mercies and nothing can separate us from his presence there is not one thing that you face that the enemy can separate you from our god and god every time that enemy comes in he raises a standard and he raises it in you to meet the challenge of the hour he raises your faith another notch to do it to combat the enemy that you're facing he done it with the pale horse the red horse the white horse and the black horse every time one of those spirits came what did he do he raised a standard he had something not equivalent but more power more word more anointing more power the presence of the lord to combat that spirit and god has not ceased to be god today he's still the same and i love what brother man says he goes oh the glorious part every once in a while he'll give us a bunch of grapes a big bunch of grapes so that we can have evidence that there is a land beyond the river let me bring this to a close or start trying to bring it to a close we find that in the greatest battle ever fought and i know this is a message that we know all too well but he said there had to be a mutual meeting place and the mind was the battleground was a place that was chosen because that's where the decisions are made that's where satan meets you and decisions are made there because god made man that way he said the ma the mind accepts the life which is the word of god and there brings that life see just your thoughts don't do it so you can't just imagine yourself or think yourself and try to have mind over matter but no your mind accepts it and then it grabs hold of it and then it brings it down into your soul or to your heart and then that's where life is given so it's got to come from the mind down to the heart or into the soul but he said see the mind accepts the life which is the word of god and there brings the life just your thoughts don't do it see but the word of god brought in the channel of your thought it's not the thought it's christian science make its mind over matter but your mind accepts it it grasps it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of god and that's the thing that's got life in it and it brings life into you so when you hear the word go forth you're not just receiving it with your mind though it comes through the channel of your mind but your spirit catches it and it brings that life it brings that anointing it brings that word into you and what does it do it equips you for the battle see he says now if you abide in me in my word and you then ask what you will because you in the word are the same that's right so when god is elevating the standard he's elevating you because you are the word essentially even like tabernacle and those that are on stream those that are real born again sons and daughters of god you have become the word in flesh and god has lifted that standard up god has lifted that standard up and god has put it on display he is not afraid to back up his word and he's not afraid to back up his word in you to make this word live and flow from your life however whenever whoever he wants it to god is not ashamed of our services he's not ashamed of the outpouring of the spirit when sons and daughters begin to get emotional and i just listened to a tape this morning and brother brown said i like emotion i'm i'm i i'm paraphrased but i'm heavy on the side of emotion so all those that don't believe that the prophet of god was emotional you need to go back and listen to the tapes because that was from the message it wasn't so from the beginning 1958 you'll find that the prophet of god enjoyed emotion he enjoyed service he enjoyed the worship god and the reciprocation of the spirit coming back to say amen to the worship yes sir so we find now if you abide in me in my word which you become the word the word and you're the same he has preeminence he's got the ruler shipping and you become his prisoner he says so from the middle of the heart which is the soul from there goes forth feeding every channel the trouble of it is we're standing in a lot of doubt sometimes you know you want to believe but there's so much doubt just there but he says you got to blow out all the flu you got to clean it all out so that the word can drop down otherwise if you don't clean those flues out you're going to blow up and you find people get off oh they serve the lord 20 years but all of a sudden now they don't believe anymore because they had flus in there they didn't clean up they didn't blow out they had little doubts that were unsettled little things that just kept you know they kept pushing it down pushing it down pushing it trying to believe wanting to believe oh it makes regional rational sense to believe that this is the truth message but unless it becomes from the mind to the heart and you don't clean that thing out so that it becomes a reality and the life that's anoint that's in that word but comes from your mind and dropped down into that art and produces that same life in you you're going to blow up so it's got to be accepted in the mind believed in the heart then the word of god becomes a reality then every sense of the soul body is just scoured out with the holy spirit then your senses of god your conscience of god everything that's godly flows to you there's no doubt anywhere he says there's nothing can rise up if you're here this evening and there's doubts in your life know that the battleground is there it was drawn you had no choice in the matter god chose the battleground but he's also equipped you to receive life in the midst of your battle and how do you receive it faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of god don't allow yourself to drift off in la la land when the anointing in the presence of the lord is here to do what to say grab hold of that word because in that word has life eternal life changing body changing life to change transform you from an earthly tabernacle to an eternal tabernacle he says now as i begin to try to sorry i just got so much hail on my fork this morning or this evening rather he says but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled inside with the holy spirit that don't even come into the memories talking about miss doe miss john doe you know she tried this and she tried that and she failed he says that don't even come into memory no matter who miss jones or about miss jones what she did it's you and god together and nobody else but you too there you are there's your battle kill him at the beginning some of you like to pacify your devil here i got a pacifier sticking in his mouth i'll tote him around he'll go everywhere i go long as he hushes up no he said kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his track he says it ain't how long you make the war linger it stop it right now and if you're being persecuted you're being pressured and that little nagging death will follow you to church i'll tell you tonight stop it right now kill him in this service tonight don't walk out and think oh i'm going to be a better christian tomorrow and you hadn't dealt with your devil deal with your devil in the presence of the anointing of the holy spirit and let god fight your battle let god destroy your enemy let god put all those close up vengeance and let god pour out wrath on that adversary that's trying to take you down so no matter if ten thousand down this side today he says we're trusting ten thousand down that side tomorrow we're trusting that has nothing to do with me i'm the individual i'm the one that's trusting i'm the one that believes but the devil will try to come back right and get you there at all see he's got your army if he gets back if he comes back and he says if he can get in there then he's got your army routed so if your seed tastes male feeling here doesn't line up with the word he said put it aside remember your imagination conscious affections those things don't line up to the word put those things aside see but when god can get a man in his hands until he gets all the senses conscious everything cleaned out until it stands with god behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there then and that's what our that's what we preach at this church that's what we preach we aspire to preach don't let doubt come and rob you don't let complexes come and rob you don't let fear come and rob you don't let the devil in any kind of method any kind of trick or trickery that it comes with don't let them rob you you're in a battle but god has equipped you for the battle god has equipped you for the battle see there's your battleground your battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul back in your mind that opens the mind is a gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit so it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door see but when your mind closes itself to those things and let god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan cannot battle against it no sir he can't battle against it now he says now know that that's the truth so you got to say like brother banham says start doubting your doubts sometimes we find that hard but start doubting your doubts as we bring this to a close here and i want to get to a certain part he says we fight in the message victory day we fight it every day every christian fights a battle every day we're in a warfare right now going on constantly within us how many can testify to that between right and wrong shall we receive it what shall we do these are some of the battles shall we receive it what shall we do shall we bow to the world shall we give up to this thought that we got he goes now you got to focus it take it from genesis to revelation she is thus saith the lord each time right down through there he says we can't give it up we can't compromise with the rest of them he said we just we can't do it we got to stay here that's all no matter how great the enemy is how much machinery he's got against us how many organizations how many of this or any of the other he says we yet we have pulled the focus of god's word till we find that it's the one thing and that's the blood of jesus christ and he is the same yesterday today and forever so if you're in a battle tonight and you're losing focus that's why you come to the presence of the lord to refocus so that you can focus back on that his blood is still effectual and it's efficacious and it endures and it's lasting and he said the captain the captain give an order and you turn around and do something backwards why you'll mess the whole army up that's right you'll throw it right into a riot you've got to carry out the orders the only way you can do it is to focus it and see the purpose what it's all about we've had many great battles spiritual battles many great v-days that the church has made or has i mean the church the body of christ i'm not talking about the organization's systems now because i'm talking about the body of christ the body of believers down through the ages has had many great v-days so you have to carry out the orders you can't get the orders well i don't like them well tough luck you're not the captain you're the little peon little private that enlisted so you got to carry out the orders do what he says because he knows what's best for you that captain has reared himself he's going through the ranks he understands what it takes to keep his man safe as i was talking to one of the men one of the marines that came here for nathan's funeral and he's a high ranking captain now and and i was asking him you know kind of what they went through in the war that they faced when they all went in and he said our number one responsibility and what gives us so much grief and keeps us up at night and causes ptsd it's not it's not the people that we killed but it's the ones around us that were killed because their ultimate responsibility is the safety of their men and if they lose one that burden that pressure is on their shoulders because then there's a letter that goes to that family thank you for the service your son died in battle so they know the orders they know how to give the orders they know what it takes to be successful and to not only be successful and to accomplish the task but to save every life that's in the military or in that regiment so it's upon us church when you hear things being preached from the pulpit on sunday morning or wednesday night or whenever it may be a special meeting and the captain is giving orders well that's just their thought no that ain't just their thought that's the captain equipping you for battle so that you'll make it through laodicea what is he doing he's raising the standard and then he's not only raising it but he's giving you the equipment so that you're raised with it as i bring this to a close isaiah 59 and verse 17 he put on righteousness as the breastplate the helmet of salvation upon his head garments of vengeance for clothing it was clothed with seal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory shall from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him that word standard there it means so many things a lot of people want to you know they got so many ways but since they're not here preaching to you tonight and i am i'm going to look at it from the aspect of a standard is a flag that hangs on a pole oh man that's just simple i thought it was going to be something just supernatural the standard god's raising up a flag not just a flag see the standard is the bible would tell us that it's a flag on a pole it's a standard it's an inside it's a banner and there are many times that the enemy comes in and every time he comes god raises the flag what does he raise the flag for so that when you're in the midst of a hail storm of bullets coming your way you can see that he's still going before you the standard has been lifted the standard is still waving oh they thought when 1965 when the prophet of god went off the scene maybe the standard of fallen but if you do any kind of study of civil war that flag to that regiment was the identity of the regiment those flags symbolize more than just some cloth and a pole but no it meant so much more let me just kind of kind of go through and show you what when that flag there it meant the colors it helped the soldiers identify their troop in battle maybe there's a bunch of smoke all around but yet when they see that flag lifted up they see that's where my men are and they can rejoin their troop see the color bear or color bearers or the standard bears what did they do they they set the pace of the march otherwise they set the tone for church and you think it's all on brother mike brother timothy no you're the standard bear we're setting the tone for how we worship it even like tabernacle so they set the cadence they set the proper length the color bearers they didn't carry a weapon no and it increased their likelihood of being killed see these soldiers were chosen for their bravery and their steadiness they were chosen hand-picked by the captain because of their bravery god or the captain looked in and said that's who i want because i know when the battle's going there's no retreat whether they have a gun or not they're holding the standard they're holding the standard there's a story about a sergeant i believe it was um let me go and i'll find it for you real quick it's a battle here it's called cutler's brigade of land uh the 147th new york was among some of the first union infantry regiments to arrive near the mcpherson farm and i'm sure brother ross and brother aaron is going to correct me on this and that's quite all right but there's 380 new yorkers across the chambersburg pike and they formed up near the bed of the unfinished railroad cut and we find that these regiments with two other sister regiments engaged in sharp a sharp fire fight with the confederate army and the 155th north carolina worked its way around the right flank of the union line and they poured in a murderous fire orders were sent forward directing the troops to fall back to more secure positions but the commander of the 147th was severely wounded before they could transmit the command to his men and as a result as a result the new yorkers stood alone against three confederate regiments and the fight was fierce and hot the boys were falling like autumn leaves the air was full of lead after half an hour of this unequal conquest the courier rode in as a male storm and or maelstrom and he delivered the retreat order and color sergeant john hencliffe who was a very uh distinguished soldier he attempted to escape with the flag and he was struck by several bullets and he was he was killed instantly and sergeant william wiborn rushed back and he pulled the blood-soaked standard from underneath hindi's lifeless body he could have let us lay there he could just let us help man we're going to retreat i'm getting out of here before i'm next but no he ran to the lifeless soldier picked up the standard and raised it again and they would go on to say he said now lieutenant pierce narrated the remarkable remarkable conclusion conclusion of the incident i climbed up to the rocky face of the cut on the south side i made my way with many of our men across the metal between the railroad cut and chambers chambersburg's pike and i crossed the pike into a small peach orchard and i overtook the colors in the hand of sergeant william wyburn just as i joined him to he received a shot and they fell on the colors as if dead and i tried to remove the colors but he held on them with the true irish script and i commanded him let go and to my surprise he answered hold on i'll be up in a minute said he staggered to his feet and he carried them through the fight and he was commissioned for his courage and i will say this to even like tabernacle to the pruitt family to the butts family and to those that are listening on the internet tonight sergeant weibo rose to his feet and he lifted the standard once again and what did it do it rallied the troops so they made it through the battle and i'm here to tell you even like tabernacle may have suffered a blow but they're sons and daughters of god holding on to that standard hold on a minute i'll be back up in a minute we may have taken a blow but their standard has been raised even like tabernacle all those died in faith but we're still believing we're still trusting god we're still waving that banner that god has a people god has a word god has healing god has deliverance god has a supernatural god has the anointing god has a presence god has speaking in tongues god is dancing in the spirit god has the standard has been lifted and you are that standard i say arise people and claim that promise god thank you for the call in this hour thank you for raising the sanders thank you for calling me into the battle thank you lord you saw me under attack you saw the foolish that i hit you saw it lord but i'm in a razor standard once again even like we're not backing up we're not giving in we're not bowing to the devil we're pressing the battle we're marching forward we're trusting god musicians come the standard has been lifted the life of mary karen pruitt was nothing short of a life of christ being lifted up in this hour proving that god will have somebody that will believe the word no matter what the opposition no matter what they face no matter the difficulty her life proves that god will have a virtuous daughter she never wavered in her sickness never recanted in her devotion to serve god no matter how bad the condition never faulted in her faith she died in faith and that faith proved to be her victory a standard being waived over laodicea what you thought to bring evil god turned it for her coronation day what you thought satan to knock her down and she was knocked down but now the rest of us have picked the standard up and we're raising the standard what about the pruitt butts family what we've seen in their life as i marveled at brother tim and i told him on countless occasions what we have seen from you is nothing short of a display of true faith true grit in the face of the enemy breathing down your neck his threatening lies threatening to take your wife you steady and you can continually preach divine healing preach deliverance never showed weakness in the face of the church in the face of the the enemy but he showed the result what was he doing raising a standard even a light so when you face your enemy when you face your adversary you don't have to shed a tear but you can face him with true grit true faith true resolve that your god is going to see you through every battle a husband a pastor proclaiming god's eternal word you can just play something the eternal word that god heals whether it be on this side or whether it be on beyond the curtain of time god is still the healer what has been displayed here at even light tabernacle is a standard has been lifted the word of god in the pruitt family and now even light is time for us to measure up [Music] in the face of adversity losing a mom losing a wife losing a friend never waver never falten never saying why me the standard has been lifted i'm not saying that karen pruitt's a standard of the message but though she is because that's what the message produces i'm not saying tim pruitt in the pruitt family is a standard we all got to live by but yet it's been displayed so it gives you something to live by to measure up too sees no matter how hot the battle becomes no matter how dark the situation remain positive hold to the promise because we never know when that eagle anointing is going to turn our way and deliverance will be our promise so what we have seen is true faith true leadership true love and true christianity being displayed in man's darkest hour the standard [Music] the standard the standard has been lifted and now we got to achieve let me finish with these last couple quotes he said when the enemy comes in like a flood as is coming today what did god say he'd do he said the spirit of god would raise up a standard against it and he says are you one of them so he's showing that you believer are the standard by which he's raising up in this hour and the message to take on the whole armor of god he said when enemy comes in like a flood the whole he said the spirit of god raises a standard against it what does he do he makes the word that he's already said more positive taking his same word and just making it more positive see the word of god will raise up a standard the word would be more manifested and more manifested and from that time he says and as the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it greater and greater and greater building up now it's right down to this last thing what i was talking about last night oh i believe that he will come i believe that these old frail bodies of ours will be changed and made like unto his own glorious body so you may be in a battle today you may be staring at the enemy face to face standing toe to toe and you may be wondering how am i going to make it can i make it will i make it will i survive let me encourage you when the enemy comes in he threatens you as a ravenous raging stream full of hate and venom and things god's gonna make that word in your life more positive and greater is he that is
