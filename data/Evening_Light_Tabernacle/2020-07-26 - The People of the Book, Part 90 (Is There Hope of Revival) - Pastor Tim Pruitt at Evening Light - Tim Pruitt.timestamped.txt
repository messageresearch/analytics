[38:53] whom the lord
[38:54] shall call god bless you you can be
[38:57] seated
[38:59] i am going to speak today on
[39:02] a little subject and to be quite honest
[39:05] with you i'm
[39:06] you know going to take my time into this
[39:09] and probably have to do another part to
[39:12] this
[39:13] so this will be part one of this at
[39:16] least um
[39:17] we will try that if the lord will
[39:20] will inspire us that way but
[39:23] um i want to speak today on is there
[39:26] hope
[39:27] of revival is there hope
[39:31] of revival i read in
[39:34] 1963 in this report it's in the fall of
[39:38] the year
[39:39] way after the seals have been preached
[39:42] and brother branham talks about the
[39:44] church is ready she's sealed in
[39:46] ready to come there will be a great
[39:49] outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab
[39:52] that church and take her into the skies
[39:55] exactly because we see the church the
[39:57] word the bride in christ his ministry
[40:00] is in his bride which is body the
[40:02] supernatural bodies
[40:03] the spiritual body of his on the earth
[40:06] his spirit is living his life right out
[40:09] until him and the church becomes one in
[40:11] the wedding see they become
[40:13] one and again you know brother branham
[40:17] also speaks of this
[40:18] and what shall we do with jesus called
[40:20] christ this is in phoenix
[40:23] a 64 sermon he says listen we
[40:26] say about satan's big machine up there
[40:28] ready to move
[40:29] that's right to crush down but remember
[40:31] god's little flock that believes the
[40:33] word
[40:34] its mechanics is ready too it's ready
[40:37] for the dynamics
[40:39] to set it a fire with the holy ghost if
[40:41] you're not
[40:42] little flock it's your father's good
[40:44] will to give you the kingdom
[40:46] the holy ghost will strike a little
[40:48] church
[40:49] that's come out from the world women
[40:51] that wears long hair nazarite to prove
[40:53] they
[40:54] separated themself um themselves from
[40:57] the world
[40:58] again in the is your life where the
[41:01] gospel
[41:02] he talks about how that the the table
[41:05] was ready
[41:06] for the for the wedding and the
[41:08] invitation was given and he made three
[41:10] different calls
[41:12] and and he said that there was still
[41:14] room to spare
[41:16] because there were so many that made
[41:18] excuses
[41:19] and he says there's still room and he
[41:22] says i believe that maybe within the
[41:24] next few months
[41:25] or something a year or whatever it is
[41:28] god's going to send another shaking
[41:31] across the country for somebody out
[41:33] there somewhere
[41:34] that's a predestinated seed that the
[41:36] light has to fall on somewhere
[41:38] somewhere in the world the nation itself
[41:41] is gone
[41:42] now as we explained to you last sunday
[41:45] that
[41:46] that we have been given a promise to be
[41:49] taken
[41:49] back to the original pentecost this was
[41:53] the job of the elijah prophet
[41:56] he was to turn the hearts of the
[41:57] children back to the faith of the
[41:59] fathers
[42:00] so as he said um bring us back to
[42:03] pentecost
[42:04] not hollywood showmanship but a
[42:06] wholehearted turn to god is what we need
[42:08] once more lord once more and so it's
[42:11] another pentecost
[42:12] and again we emphasize not another azusa
[42:16] street but another book of acts
[42:19] not another book of corinthians now
[42:22] the bride of course at the beginning is
[42:25] the bride
[42:26] at the end as brother branham saw her in
[42:28] the vision
[42:29] and he said she's alpha and omega
[42:32] and of course um this restoration is
[42:35] promised that
[42:36] god will take this church right back to
[42:39] the pentecost
[42:40] of the beginning now this is different
[42:44] from azusa street the azusa street
[42:47] revival now has over 500 million
[42:50] that's a half a billion followers and
[42:53] brother branham predicted
[42:54] the shape that she would be in as it
[42:57] moved
[42:58] or toward the charismatic movement and
[43:00] listen to what he has
[43:01] to say in the laodicean churches he said
[43:04] then there's all this talk
[43:05] about the glossolalia that is speaking
[43:08] in tongues
[43:09] it is supposed to be the evidence of the
[43:12] baptism of the holy ghost
[43:14] and people are thinking that we are in
[43:17] the midst of a great revival
[43:19] and he says the revival is over america
[43:22] had her last chance in 1957
[43:25] and now the tongues are the sign of
[43:28] god's impending disaster
[43:30] even as they were when they appeared
[43:32] upon the wall
[43:34] at belshazzar this feast don't you know
[43:37] there are many going to say in the
[43:39] coming the last day and said lord lord
[43:41] have we not done many wonderful works in
[43:43] thy name even the cast out devils
[43:45] and he'll say to to them depart from me
[43:47] that we that work iniquity
[43:49] i never knew you so now again as
[43:52] he as he said this phenomena that that
[43:55] we see in
[43:56] the outbreak of speaking in tongues
[44:00] and he identified that not as a sign of
[44:02] life
[44:04] but the sign of the end the end
[44:07] of a of god dealing with a
[44:10] denominational system
[44:13] and and if you notice here that it is um
[44:16] it is a sign not of life but a sign of
[44:19] death
[44:20] that god is bringing about an end just
[44:23] as he said
[44:24] the the handwriting on the wall was a
[44:27] sign
[44:28] that god was fixing to bring judgment
[44:31] and and so a judgment he has done
[44:34] because he has
[44:35] he has judged the the horror and her
[44:38] daughters
[44:39] and he's called out a people for his
[44:40] namesake that is a judgment
[44:43] now jesus said these are workers of
[44:46] iniquity
[44:47] you get a man can come up and pray for
[44:49] the sick get oil and blood appearing in
[44:51] the congregation
[44:52] prophecy coming forth all manner of the
[44:54] supernatural
[44:55] and people gather around him and swear
[44:58] he is the lord
[44:59] even though he's actually making a money
[45:02] racket of religion and living in sin
[45:05] how many have seen that that identifies
[45:08] the charismatic movement
[45:10] the only answer that they have is an
[45:13] absolutely unbiblical one well to get
[45:15] results they must be of god how terrible
[45:18] how actually poor this age is in the
[45:21] spirit of god
[45:22] and the poor poverty stricken ones don't
[45:24] even know it
[45:26] but i want you to know in contrast to
[45:29] that
[45:30] there is a bride that is standing on her
[45:32] feet
[45:33] amen as a mighty invincible army
[45:37] we've all heard the prophets say it and
[45:40] we're reminded
[45:41] we remind you very often that satan
[45:44] knows if the people get
[45:46] the true revelation of the true
[45:49] church and what she is and what she
[45:51] stands for
[45:52] and that she can do the greater works
[45:55] that she will be an invincible army
[45:57] she gets a revelation of the two spirits
[46:00] that's working in the framework of the
[46:02] church and remember
[46:03] get that revelation and hold on to it
[46:06] amen and god's by god's spirit discern
[46:09] and withstand the antichrist spirit then
[46:12] satan will be powerless before
[46:14] her now so as i said
[46:17] we're not looking for another divine
[46:20] healing movement
[46:21] as brother branham said it was never
[46:23] god's will to do that
[46:24] he said god wanted divine healing in
[46:27] every church
[46:28] amen now so again
[46:32] um but he he said about the divine
[46:36] healing movement it's dead
[46:38] and it will never resurrect
[46:42] now he cautioned us he said now your
[46:43] pentecostals
[46:45] you want to believe that there's going
[46:47] to come a time
[46:48] that you'll get this power and you'll go
[46:50] forth and empty out all the hospitals
[46:52] and so forth he said i want you to know
[46:53] that's a lie it was never done
[46:56] and it never will be done amen he said
[47:00] jesus
[47:01] went and found one man at the pool but
[47:03] that's how he prayed for him
[47:04] raised him up and he left the rest of
[47:07] them laying there
[47:09] right so we want to have the right
[47:11] expectations for revival
[47:16] amen now now sometimes we
[47:20] want to just stop a moment and remember
[47:23] what that divine healing movement
[47:26] and that revival was like brother
[47:29] branham describes this
[47:30] after coming back to beaumont texas
[47:33] after
[47:34] 20 years before being there and he was
[47:36] there with raymond ritchie and
[47:38] f.f bosworth and other brothers and he
[47:41] says i still believe the same gospel i
[47:43] hadn't changed a bit
[47:46] um it's just the same thing but you see
[47:48] the revival was going on then
[47:50] and where there's no revival you just
[47:52] can't get things done
[47:55] and he said the ministry is more far
[47:58] more advanced because god was discerning
[48:00] the thoughts and intense the heart
[48:02] amen showing the sign of the messiah
[48:05] and and he says but um the
[48:08] revival is not on he said just your
[48:12] presence
[48:13] to walk in with the people what people
[48:16] would
[48:16] get up out of cots and stretchers and
[48:19] walk around
[48:20] you just lay hands upon them and my that
[48:23] just sent them whirling
[48:24] i've seen lines where four or five
[48:26] hundred people come through the lines
[48:28] deaf dumb blind cross side not one of
[48:30] them would fail
[48:31] but what was healed every one of them
[48:34] but try
[48:34] today see there's no fire
[48:38] in rome when the fires went out of the
[48:40] temple at vista
[48:41] the the people went home now there's no
[48:44] revival to back it up see
[48:46] that's just it and after a while if the
[48:48] world stands
[48:50] they will start living in the glare
[48:52] again
[48:54] now glare is a reflection
[48:58] or a mirage or are
[49:01] just a memory of the past
[49:05] and brother branham said this is the
[49:07] problem people
[49:09] live in a glare and
[49:12] and a reflection of something that was
[49:15] but no longer is
[49:19] so again he said they will start living
[49:22] in a glare now listen we as message
[49:25] believers must be
[49:27] careful that we ourselves don't live in
[49:30] the
[49:30] in a glare of the past
[49:34] god's in a mighty revival he sent a
[49:36] prophet of god
[49:38] amen but we cannot live in that day
[49:41] we're living in another day
[49:44] is that right amen sure i mean the
[49:47] message still goes on the prophet
[49:49] still is effective i'm not saying that
[49:51] i'm saying
[49:52] that we we are now in a in another time
[49:56] we're at the very end just before the
[49:59] trumpet sounds
[50:01] amen and he said after a while if the
[50:04] world stands he'll start living in the
[50:06] glare again that's the way it always
[50:07] done passed over and missed them
[50:09] that generation is to be judged for what
[50:11] passed over them
[50:12] they failed to see it jesus christ is
[50:16] alive this afternoon he's walking around
[50:18] here with us now he's ever present
[50:20] wherever two or three are symbol in my
[50:22] name i'm in their midst
[50:23] believe that won't you
[50:26] but you see when there's no atmosphere
[50:28] and when there's no faith and
[50:30] when there's no believing
[50:33] when there's not a believing atmosphere
[50:35] you cannot
[50:36] you cannot tap in to christ being in
[50:40] our midst again calling jesus on the
[50:44] scenes and denim spring
[50:45] he went over into louisiana and he
[50:48] reminisced
[50:49] on being there and he says he said now
[50:51] we've just
[50:52] witnessed one of the greatest revivals i
[50:55] believe the world's ever seen in
[50:57] the last 10 15 years a revival not just
[50:59] like the days of billy sunday or the
[51:01] welsh revival or
[51:02] the wesleyan revival or moody revival or
[51:04] billy sunday revival
[51:06] it's been a worldwide sweeping affair
[51:08] around the world
[51:09] great healing service great revival
[51:11] fires is burnt
[51:13] on practically every hill that's in the
[51:15] world
[51:16] right now way over in the lands of
[51:18] africa down in china japan this gospel
[51:20] is being preached
[51:21] and people are being healed right this
[51:23] very minute around and around the world
[51:25] it's been one of the greatest revival
[51:27] because i believe
[51:29] it's one of the last revivals
[51:32] that this world will see a world
[51:36] world sweeping revival
[51:39] amen but he said now i
[51:42] he said but in the last few years it's
[51:45] quietened down
[51:47] and you don't notice the enthusiasm in
[51:49] the people
[51:50] that used to be i remember having the
[51:53] privilege by the holy spirit to
[51:55] spearhead that revival that started
[51:57] when the angel of the lord appeared on
[51:59] the river and said that many years ago
[52:01] and to see it happen and see ministers
[52:03] hearts of fire
[52:05] everywhere revivals broke out why you
[52:07] could just simply walk in the building
[52:09] people get right up off their cops and
[52:11] stretchers and walk away healed
[52:12] you didn't even have to say a word
[52:16] just be in there that's all it taken i
[52:17] remember one night in vandalia illinois
[52:20] i walked in the meeting had no longer
[52:22] been in a meeting more than
[52:24] over five minutes and there wasn't a
[52:25] feeble person around the place anywhere
[52:27] wheelchairs pushed out piled up
[52:30] blind was seeing death and dumb speaking
[52:32] and simply yet the spirit of the lord
[52:34] was present
[52:34] and he just healed the whole group of
[52:36] them now that's when you can do
[52:38] something
[52:39] when the revival is going
[52:43] but let the revival fire die down then
[52:46] you can hardly
[52:47] the people are still christians but
[52:50] they're not revived into that spirit
[52:53] that great atmosphere that does
[52:56] something
[52:58] it's like just in a forge in the
[52:59] blacksmith shop you got the red
[53:02] hot iron before you go to get the iron
[53:05] hot before you go to pounding on the
[53:07] anvil if you don't you'll never
[53:08] straighten it out
[53:09] and that's what it takes to have a
[53:11] revival is
[53:13] everyone under the heat of this holy
[53:15] spirit that's brought down the powers of
[53:18] god
[53:18] and a revival moving then there's prayer
[53:21] meetings going day and night and every
[53:22] minute everywhere
[53:23] while the people won't even leave the
[53:25] grounds
[53:27] now again you know this described
[53:31] very well the things that was happening
[53:33] the great revival the buildings packed
[53:36] out
[53:36] the the many that was under expectation
[53:39] the thousands that were healed
[53:41] and delivered but i want to ask you
[53:44] something
[53:46] did the divine healing move bring the
[53:48] promised rapture
[53:54] hey man don't hang up on me i asked a
[53:57] serious question
[53:59] did it produce did it bring the promised
[54:01] rapture
[54:03] no you know what it did it built
[54:06] and made bigger denominations
[54:12] amen now so you see brother branham even
[54:16] said
[54:16] i sent three quarters of a million of my
[54:19] children to the assembly of god and
[54:21] others went to oneness and full gospel
[54:27] people who were who were in his divine
[54:30] healing movements and
[54:31] saw god real and they just went and
[54:34] joined the church
[54:36] and paul a prisoner brother branham
[54:38] explains this as he looks back
[54:40] over it and sees the effect
[54:43] of a divine healing movement now
[54:47] i'm trying to get something to you
[54:49] because our goal is not just to have
[54:51] another divine healing movement
[54:55] our goal is not to be all of us be
[54:58] little william branham's out here and
[55:00] all of us with the gift of god and all
[55:02] of us doing miracles and signs and
[55:04] wonders which is what
[55:06] the charismatic say is going to happen
[55:09] they'll point back to william branham
[55:11] and said we're all going to be that
[55:14] and it's the wrong expectation
[55:18] i want to focus on something for a
[55:19] moment
[55:21] i want you to realize that our next
[55:25] our next great move of god
[55:28] is where we're at right now produces
[55:32] a rapture
[55:38] and that's our goal our goal is not a
[55:41] bigger church
[55:43] our goal is not attracting as i said
[55:46] last sunday
[55:47] bugs to the light bulb our goal
[55:50] is to to to get ready for the coming
[55:54] of the lord jesus and to see that he's
[55:58] real
[55:58] and a living god among us
[56:02] and as he's god he's a healer he's a
[56:04] deliverer he's a need supplier
[56:06] and us to have that enthusiasm and that
[56:08] expectancy
[56:10] that we should have for the coming of
[56:12] the lord and prepare ourselves
[56:16] for his coming
[56:21] and paul a prisoner brother branham
[56:23] types himself with moses
[56:25] he said moses he took him out in the
[56:27] desert kept him there
[56:29] 40 years and stripped him of all his
[56:31] theology and ambition
[56:33] and i think sometimes that kind of types
[56:35] us
[56:36] we come down to the times where we've
[56:38] had a stripping time
[56:41] or what a time he could look back and
[56:43] see his failure and tonight
[56:44] we ought to do the same thing when we
[56:46] see our ambition
[56:48] look at the healing campaign and see if
[56:50] the lord did something
[56:52] a few years ago to start restoring
[56:54] healing to the sick and so forth
[56:55] and everybody every organization is
[56:58] because it didn't come to their
[57:00] organization
[57:01] they had to get them a healer
[57:04] and what have we done just look at it a
[57:06] moment we've done the same thing that
[57:07] moses did we went out
[57:09] and tried so hard to manufacture some
[57:12] kind of miracle
[57:14] i smelt a disease i've got a blood in my
[57:17] hand
[57:18] when manufactured miracle and what have
[57:20] we got some of the men in such
[57:22] hard strings that broke up and became
[57:26] regular drunkards and neurotics and got
[57:28] their mind
[57:29] and they switched all the way back the
[57:31] order from the pentecostal objective
[57:33] back to making organizations again
[57:38] building a kingdom
[57:42] now and what do you have it's true some
[57:44] of their main
[57:45] main ones died of drunk a.a allen guided
[57:49] drunk
[57:51] oh yeah he had miracles man just wrote
[57:54] us the other day and said i was there
[57:55] when um you know leroy jenkins who later
[57:59] became a
[57:59] healing evangelist of his own you know
[58:02] again that
[58:03] that was um that was questionable in his
[58:06] life
[58:07] but he had stitches on his arms and he
[58:09] watched
[58:10] there as um a allen prayed for him and
[58:13] the stitches popped
[58:14] and the and the the whole arm was healed
[58:17] and completely healed up a miracle right
[58:20] before him all
[58:23] but he died of drunk
[58:26] what good does it do to have divine
[58:28] healing
[58:30] and not have a life
[58:32] [Applause]
[58:35] you know the first thing we want to see
[58:37] captain to make sure we've got a life
[58:40] [Applause]
[58:42] amen because there's going to be many
[58:43] coming that day and saying did not do
[58:45] miracles didn't i
[58:46] cast out devils didn't i do all of these
[58:48] things in thy name and he said you're
[58:50] workers of iniquity
[58:53] you did things and knowing better than
[58:55] to do them
[58:56] you kept right on living the way you
[58:58] were living
[59:01] and he said what have we done we slew
[59:03] about one egyptian
[59:05] that's right we tried and we strained we
[59:08] paid we labored we go all night in
[59:10] prayer meetings till we had no voice
[59:12] trying to manufacture something sweep up
[59:14] something all these type of thing and
[59:16] find it a total failure
[59:19] we need a going back to the desert she
[59:21] says yes sir camp meetings and struggles
[59:23] why not just give up
[59:24] that's what you ought to do just go go
[59:26] back and give up the
[59:27] we've done the same thing that moses did
[59:29] it doesn't do any good
[59:31] after 40 years he found himself a
[59:33] prisoner
[59:34] to the word of god and i hope after all
[59:37] this time
[59:41] we've become a people that's a prisoner
[59:44] to the word we're chained to that word
[59:48] we're not going to deviate one bit
[59:52] come on but we're going to stay focused
[59:54] on the word of god
[59:56] the message of the hour again
[1:00:00] he continues this when the great
[1:00:02] blessing come out the manifestations of
[1:00:04] these great things that god told us
[1:00:06] about
[1:00:07] how we must be born again how we receive
[1:00:10] the holy ghost
[1:00:10] the baptism in the name of jesus and all
[1:00:13] of these things
[1:00:14] you see the people instead of state of
[1:00:16] that word and harness to it what they do
[1:00:18] they start their own denominational
[1:00:19] theory
[1:00:20] which had already failed and tried to
[1:00:22] manufacture something that looked like
[1:00:24] the truth
[1:00:26] and what we got tonight but a nation
[1:00:28] full of organized people who deny the
[1:00:31] scriptures of god
[1:00:33] who would call the life of the holy
[1:00:34] spirit say that it's a mental telepathy
[1:00:36] who would
[1:00:37] refuse to refuse such to come in their
[1:00:40] church and they wouldn't permit
[1:00:42] you to mention one word of serpency
[1:00:46] although it's all through the bible
[1:00:50] eternal security although it's all
[1:00:53] through the bible
[1:00:55] and the things the holy spirit has
[1:00:56] revealed and proved to be the word and i
[1:00:58] may challenge after challenge to come
[1:01:00] and prove me wrong
[1:01:02] what are they got same thing that luther
[1:01:04] had the rest of them slew an egyptian
[1:01:06] what was it maybe he made some
[1:01:10] man stop stealing well that's pretty
[1:01:13] good
[1:01:15] make a good citizen out of a guy where
[1:01:17] he quit stealing quits going to jail for
[1:01:19] it
[1:01:20] that's pretty nice isn't it amen or
[1:01:22] maybe make a man live true to his wife
[1:01:26] probably after he found his third one
[1:01:28] and finally decided well i better settle
[1:01:30] down
[1:01:32] we're talking about denominational
[1:01:34] christians
[1:01:36] but what you make out of him a church
[1:01:38] member
[1:01:39] come and join our group again
[1:01:42] we don't want church members
[1:01:46] we want people to be filled with the
[1:01:48] holy ghost
[1:01:48] [Applause]
[1:01:50] is that right amen we want the power of
[1:01:54] the almighty god that comes and changes
[1:01:57] lives
[1:01:59] not build a kingdom
[1:02:03] there again and pray in a prisoner paul
[1:02:06] a prisoner he says
[1:02:07] that stinking dead man was the only
[1:02:10] thing
[1:02:11] he'll point his finger to of his success
[1:02:13] of 40 years of training you know
[1:02:14] you remember you know here he here he
[1:02:17] tried and tried and trained and was told
[1:02:19] he was a deliverer
[1:02:20] and everything and he tried to deliver
[1:02:22] israel on his own
[1:02:25] and he killed an egyptian
[1:02:28] he didn't deliver israel he didn't
[1:02:31] produce an
[1:02:32] exodus a rapture come on
[1:02:35] and all he did was had a stinking dead
[1:02:38] egyptian
[1:02:39] one egyptian and this is what he said
[1:02:42] 40 years of training a stinking egyptian
[1:02:45] laying there rotten and dead and that's
[1:02:47] the way it is tonight the only thing we
[1:02:49] can point to
[1:02:50] to this revival that is crossed over is
[1:02:53] a stinking bunch of church members
[1:02:57] that knows no more about god than a hot
[1:02:59] and talk would know about an egyptian
[1:03:01] night right they would
[1:03:02] tell them about the word of god and they
[1:03:03] said i don't believe that
[1:03:06] i don't care what they say i don't
[1:03:07] believe it see it's an awful thing to
[1:03:09] have to point back to for all the
[1:03:11] strains
[1:03:12] and struggles and everything
[1:03:15] we got
[1:03:19] maybe we could point to a big school
[1:03:22] which that's what roberts did build to
[1:03:24] school
[1:03:25] that's what gordon lindsay did built to
[1:03:27] school
[1:03:28] amen this is what they were all they all
[1:03:31] did they went to went and built
[1:03:32] seminaries
[1:03:34] so they could teach divine healing and
[1:03:37] so they could
[1:03:37] teach the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:03:40] teach these things
[1:03:41] and he says it's dead
[1:03:45] we can point to an organization but it's
[1:03:48] dead
[1:03:49] it's thinking it's just like the first
[1:03:52] thing that we pulled out of
[1:03:53] like a hog going back to his swallow
[1:03:56] adopt his vomit when we return back
[1:03:58] one dead egyptian
[1:04:02] so he looks back over the divine healing
[1:04:04] movement
[1:04:06] and he says that's what it produced
[1:04:09] now again come on
[1:04:13] we don't want just what that produced
[1:04:18] we want to see a rapture
[1:04:21] we want to see people's lives changed
[1:04:24] now living right
[1:04:26] talking right come on treating their
[1:04:30] neighbor right
[1:04:31] being a real christian sons and
[1:04:33] daughters of god
[1:04:34] on fire for god amen
[1:04:40] so again what would another divine
[1:04:42] healing meet and produce
[1:04:44] or revival produce same thing
[1:04:47] what about america will she ever have
[1:04:50] another revival
[1:04:54] what we hear them praying all over the
[1:04:55] nation god's in america revival that the
[1:04:58] people
[1:04:59] oh you know will will humble themselves
[1:05:02] and
[1:05:02] and call on the lord and whatever humble
[1:05:05] themselves and pray out here from heaven
[1:05:07] and heal their land
[1:05:09] we hear them over and over and over and
[1:05:11] over a revival in america
[1:05:15] we had jerry falwell for years that was
[1:05:17] proclaiming
[1:05:18] we had a moral majority it's not there
[1:05:24] i say it again it's not there
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:29] what we've got is a bunch of hoodlums
[1:05:31] and people don't believe in god anymore
[1:05:34] and a godless society come on and even
[1:05:37] our churches being led by
[1:05:39] by a homosexual agenda the methodist
[1:05:42] church the leadership has now
[1:05:44] become a lgbt movement
[1:05:48] amen we're a godless nation
[1:05:53] and we have turned from a lamb to a
[1:05:56] dragon
[1:05:59] america is a beast that devours
[1:06:08] and you can see the hatred that is
[1:06:10] building up in her
[1:06:13] there's a radical element in this
[1:06:15] country and i don't want to mean to get
[1:06:17] into politics
[1:06:18] but i'm going to deal with some of this
[1:06:19] a little bit you just bear with me for a
[1:06:22] bit
[1:06:23] amen because a lot of people have the
[1:06:25] wrong expectations
[1:06:27] say god bless america god's not going to
[1:06:29] bless america
[1:06:31] america's damned america is cursed

[1:07:01] somebody blowing their nose
[1:07:05] come on there's no hope in any of this
[1:07:10] you have one hope and that's to leave
[1:07:12] from here
[1:07:15] one hope that's the coming of the lord
[1:07:18] jesus
[1:07:19] we are on the verge of the tribulation
[1:07:22] you see the spirits of insanity that has
[1:07:26] been loosed
[1:07:28] as they give their mind to the beast
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:36] this is not conspiracy theories this is
[1:07:39] the word of god
[1:07:40] revelation 13 15 and he had
[1:07:43] power to give life to the image of the
[1:07:45] beast
[1:07:46] that the image of the beast should both
[1:07:48] speak and causes
[1:07:50] many that would not worship the image of
[1:07:52] the beast should be killed
[1:07:54] and he calls all both small and great
[1:07:56] and rich and poor and
[1:07:57] free and bond to receive a mark in their
[1:08:00] hand or in their forehead
[1:08:02] and that no man might have a right might
[1:08:04] buy or sell
[1:08:06] save he that had the mark or the name of
[1:08:07] the beast or the number of his name
[1:08:11] amen so there is a beast that rose up
[1:08:15] that was rome there was one to come that
[1:08:18] was out of the sea there was one raised
[1:08:19] up out of the land that was america
[1:08:22] a place where that there were no people
[1:08:24] the other is sea which is multitudes
[1:08:26] nations people
[1:08:27] that was wrong then you have america
[1:08:29] america is the main player in this last
[1:08:31] age
[1:08:33] and she's a beast
[1:08:36] and then she starts out with freedom of
[1:08:38] religion she ends
[1:08:40] at speaking like the dragon

[1:10:02] now listen the image to the beast rises
[1:10:04] out of the land of america
[1:10:07] let me define it it is an ecumenical
[1:10:09] spirit
[1:10:11] that says we are all one
[1:10:16] and social justice for all
[1:10:19] and you and you will accept the
[1:10:21] homosexual their agenda
[1:10:24] or they will force you out of business

[1:10:40] day that the
[1:10:41] man of sin a spirit of lawlessness will
[1:10:44] rule
[1:10:45] it's a spirit of rebellion and it's
[1:10:49] there
[1:10:49] and it's anointing men and women and
[1:10:52] boys and girls of youth
[1:10:56] who are all screaming out for their
[1:10:58] rights because it's laodicea
[1:11:00] and laodicea means people's rights and

[1:11:20] for justice and he won a lot of good
[1:11:22] things

[1:12:22] of the beast
[1:12:24] they're not the marking of the beast i'm
[1:12:26] just saying it is the spirit of the
[1:12:28] antichrist is alive and well

[1:12:34] and in the world
[1:12:36] [Music]

[1:12:44] think of england goes over there and
[1:12:46] they will start pulling down statues and
[1:12:48] riot in their streets

[1:12:54] trying to bring the world under one
[1:12:56] world order
[1:12:58] and disrupt the democracies and
[1:13:01] capitalism and whatever
[1:13:02] and turn it over into socialism and
[1:13:04] marxism
[1:13:06] [Applause]
[1:13:08] cancel culture refers to the popular
[1:13:10] practice of withdrawing support
[1:13:12] over cancelling public figures and
[1:13:14] companies after they've done said
[1:13:16] or after they have done or said
[1:13:19] something considered
[1:13:20] objectionable or offensible you know
[1:13:24] kent's cancer culture is generally
[1:13:26] discussed as being performed on sodium
[1:13:29] social media in the form of group
[1:13:32] shaming
[1:13:37] and if you don't accept sin you are
[1:13:39] ashamed
[1:13:41] you don't accept their agenda you are
[1:13:44] ashamed
[1:13:46] brother branham speaking of this on the
[1:13:48] mark of the beast

[1:13:51] a number in your head
[1:13:54] or tattoo something in your hand don't
[1:13:57] you look for that it'll be a boycott
[1:14:02] amen no man could buy or sell unless he
[1:14:04] belongs to confederation of churches

[1:14:07] that'll come like a union unionizing the
[1:14:09] thing bringing it down
[1:14:11] unionized religion you see it's an
[1:14:13] economical spirit

[1:17:58] and the churches can't have church only
[1:18:00] under permission and
[1:18:01] they're doomed under judgment and even
[1:18:03] right now
[1:18:04] they have outlawed many of the messages
[1:18:07] of william branham
[1:18:11] but it's too late
[1:18:12] [Music]

[1:18:22] lives go into the communist country
[1:18:24] smuggling books

[1:18:28] their head lamps and whatever their cars
[1:18:30] and little secret pockets and
[1:18:31] get books over there and there and then
[1:18:35] god opened the doors

[1:19:02] share the gospel
[1:19:03] begin to prove begin to to tell what god
[1:19:07] had done in our generation

[1:19:45] here we're at one of the last
[1:19:46] strongholds there of satan

[1:19:53] citizen preachers today again of the
[1:19:55] congregation

[1:19:58] together and hungry hearts
[1:20:00] some of them coming out of the upc and
[1:20:02] other religious
[1:20:04] organizations and embracing the message
[1:20:06] of the hour
[1:20:08] amen they wanted a japanese group but
[1:20:10] it's international because
[1:20:12] you see it's a bride out of the out of
[1:20:14] every kindred tongue
[1:20:15] and nation is not just japan
[1:20:21] this is not an american thing or
[1:20:23] japanese thing
[1:20:25] hey man it's a bride out of every nation
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:30] thing
[1:20:33] and it's too late we're just now
[1:20:36] finishing
[1:20:37] up the all of the principal sermons in
[1:20:40] 1965 this little church
[1:20:42] sending out a man's translating the
[1:20:46] messages into the japanese language
[1:20:49] and it's too late for the devil to stop
[1:20:51] it
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:55] let me tell him that he didn't have
[1:20:58] enough
[1:21:00] he didn't have enough for japan he
[1:21:02] didn't have enough for china
[1:21:04] he didn't have enough for russia and he
[1:21:06] ain't got enough for you right here
[1:21:09] today
[1:21:12] he cannot hold back your revival he
[1:21:15] cannot keep the spirit of god away from
[1:21:17] you
[1:21:17] he cannot keep the anointing from coming
[1:21:19] down he doesn't have enough
[1:21:22] he couldn't keep this sister carrying
[1:21:25] the basketball
[1:21:26] he couldn't keep her sick in the
[1:21:27] hospital because he didn't have enough
[1:21:34] hallelujah he can't keep brother wrong
[1:21:37] down he's preaching this morning
[1:21:39] because the devil don't have enough
[1:21:54] hallelujah
[1:22:00] god bless you you can have your seats
[1:22:06] praise the lord it's still to come
[1:22:12] now 50 years ago he said the holy ghost
[1:22:16] fell in england
[1:22:18] after that king george jeffries ff
[1:22:20] bosworth charles price smith
[1:22:22] wigglesworth those great warriors of
[1:22:23] faith 50 years ago
[1:22:25] and offered england the holy ghost
[1:22:28] revival now this 1963 and 50 years ago
[1:22:32] would have been 1913.
[1:22:34] but what did they do they laughed at
[1:22:36] them they put them in jail
[1:22:38] they called them crazy they thought they
[1:22:39] lost their mind the churches refused the
[1:22:41] people to come to hear them they healed
[1:22:43] the sick cast out devils done great work
[1:22:45] and because that england as a nation
[1:22:47] rejected the gospel
[1:22:49] her sins is known throughout the world
[1:22:52] and there's hardly more of an apostate
[1:22:54] nation in all the world including rome
[1:22:56] and france than
[1:22:57] england she's a mother of apostasy right
[1:23:00] where finney and many of the great men
[1:23:02] preached in the hey market and charles g
[1:23:05] finney and wesley and on down she turned
[1:23:07] it down
[1:23:08] and then he talked about the scandal
[1:23:10] that had just come out there and showing
[1:23:12] the the their great men weakened to the
[1:23:14] sex of women and
[1:23:15] disgraceful things because she rejected
[1:23:18] the truth
[1:23:20] then it comes to america america 15
[1:23:22] years ago when the great divine healing
[1:23:25] or great healing revival continued on
[1:23:27] from pentecost
[1:23:28] broke out in the nations there was
[1:23:30] revivals on the capitol in washington dc
[1:23:33] i've been by there
[1:23:35] right there right down the street from
[1:23:37] the from the capitol itself
[1:23:39] there in uh in the auditorium you
[1:23:42] remember it timothy
[1:23:43] the the auditorium right there where
[1:23:45] deep collar to the deep
[1:23:47] still there and and um
[1:23:51] and and he said there was revivals on
[1:23:53] the capitol
[1:23:54] uh washington dc that presidents
[1:23:58] vice presidents great people governors
[1:24:01] great
[1:24:02] things like like that taking place men
[1:24:04] were healed like
[1:24:05] congressmen up been a crippled for 66
[1:24:08] years
[1:24:09] and they could not turn their face and
[1:24:11] say it wasn't so
[1:24:13] it was right before them but they turned
[1:24:15] it down and that's the reason this
[1:24:17] nation stays she's doomed
[1:24:19] there's no hope for it she's crossed the
[1:24:22] line between judgment and mercy
[1:24:24] and she's elected in what she has here
[1:24:26] to control the nation and she's rotten
[1:24:28] to the core
[1:24:29] her politics is rotten her morals of
[1:24:31] this nation is lower than anything i can
[1:24:33] think of
[1:24:34] her religious system is rotten her than
[1:24:36] the morals she becomes in doing this she
[1:24:38] has now joined herself all these
[1:24:39] churches in
[1:24:40] the nation to the federation of churches
[1:24:42] and has taken the mark of the beast
[1:24:44] what a thing christ why christ gave them
[1:24:47] the opportunity
[1:24:48] come to my feast the feasts of pentecost
[1:24:51] which means 50.
[1:24:53] when the holy spirit poured out on
[1:24:55] russia they were called to pentecost
[1:24:58] feasts of pentecost spiritual feasts
[1:24:59] they turned it down england the holy
[1:25:01] ghost poured out upon them they turned
[1:25:03] it down america
[1:25:04] holy ghost was poured out upon them they
[1:25:06] turned it down
[1:25:07] and when god sends the holy ghost
[1:25:10] and knocks at a man's door
[1:25:15] and he deliberately turns it down
[1:25:18] sometimes he's going to turn it down for
[1:25:21] the last time
[1:25:27] amen you can sit in the church and
[1:25:30] listen to the gospel and agree with the
[1:25:34] gospel
[1:25:35] but you're not going to be a privileged
[1:25:37] person anymore
[1:25:39] you might do as much to say i know it's
[1:25:40] right i never put a can
[1:25:42] but never put a finger on it to help
[1:25:43] yourself you just listen to it because
[1:25:46] you say i believe it's right and you're
[1:25:47] just sympathizing with it
[1:25:50] i could say i believe there's 10 that's
[1:25:52] 10 dollars but that don't mean i got it
[1:25:54] i could say that's good cold water
[1:25:56] but refuse to drink it you know what i
[1:25:58] mean and this is eternal life
[1:25:59] and refuse to do it one day you'll cross
[1:26:02] the line
[1:26:03] between judgment and mercy
[1:26:06] amen then you won't have the privilege
[1:26:08] to come and receive it
[1:26:10] and we're right there close
[1:26:15] in fact of the matter is you
[1:26:18] may not even have the privilege to wait
[1:26:21] that long
[1:26:24] you could cross it today
[1:26:30] amen i remember the day when
[1:26:34] i was in europe
[1:26:38] laying there at night and woken up
[1:26:41] waking up by a voice that was speaking
[1:26:43] to me
[1:26:44] and saying that denise was having her
[1:26:46] last
[1:26:48] call
[1:26:51] i remember what happened i remembered
[1:26:54] that i was the messenger
[1:26:56] i remember going to her and telling her
[1:26:58] that
[1:27:00] and i also remember the lord coming and
[1:27:01] saving her
[1:27:05] and she's lived a different life ever
[1:27:07] since
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:09] because our god is rich in mercy
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:12] sometimes he'll let you come right down
[1:27:14] to the line
[1:27:15] to snatch you right away from it
[1:27:19] don't give up on your loved ones yet
[1:27:25] but let me let me give a warning now
[1:27:27] those who do not become
[1:27:29] a part of this last day bride revival
[1:27:33] will go through the tribulation
[1:27:37] the super sign brother branham says he
[1:27:40] refers back he said what i said about
[1:27:43] five years ago
[1:27:44] this this um with this year the
[1:27:47] united states will accept the gospel or
[1:27:49] they'll never do it
[1:27:50] they've declined since that time there
[1:27:52] will never be a bigger revival in
[1:27:54] america no more like that if you believe
[1:27:55] me i'll be a prophet
[1:27:57] you believe you remember that's the word
[1:27:58] the lord just watch and see if it isn't
[1:28:00] dying
[1:28:01] and it kills me inside of me to know
[1:28:03] that men and women that i love better
[1:28:05] all my life that i give my life
[1:28:07] and what we need today is rooting out we
[1:28:10] may not
[1:28:11] we may root out too late now the hour
[1:28:13] maybe be passed
[1:28:15] we may never have another revival i know
[1:28:17] you're looking for it in the scripture
[1:28:19] but i don't see it in the scripture
[1:28:21] i look for a rapture for just a handful
[1:28:25] of people that's right just a handful of
[1:28:27] people they'll never be
[1:28:29] missed in the world and when they go
[1:28:30] you'll never know it's going it'll come
[1:28:32] like a thief in the night
[1:28:35] brother branham talks about this in the
[1:28:38] in
[1:28:39] again and i'm just going to share one
[1:28:40] more quote and we'll go on trying to do
[1:28:42] god of service
[1:28:44] america they say god bless america
[1:28:47] it's a nation it's a christian country
[1:28:50] it's a million
[1:28:51] miles from being a christian country
[1:28:56] i don't even pray for it
[1:29:01] how can i pray for it and it won't
[1:29:03] repent under the mighty powers that god
[1:29:05] demonstrated before
[1:29:06] denying and closing the doors to it and
[1:29:08] walking away i committed to god
[1:29:10] and she's going further away and now
[1:29:12] she's going to sink
[1:29:14] and we're here in the very sinking of
[1:29:17] america
[1:29:20] and i want you to stop a minute and
[1:29:22] forgive me
[1:29:23] for going down this path just a minute
[1:29:26] but again you know sometimes we see our
[1:29:28] young people they
[1:29:29] they get caught up in things and you
[1:29:31] know in movements and things and
[1:29:33] because it sounds good sounds like the
[1:29:36] end thing to do
[1:29:39] but i want you to look at the black
[1:29:40] lives movement which is nothing but a
[1:29:43] sodom movement you say well they're for
[1:29:47] social
[1:29:47] justice they are not they are
[1:29:51] a marxist group that wants to tear down
[1:29:54] america
[1:29:55] and his christian values they are
[1:29:57] against christianity they are an
[1:29:59] lgbt movement now i'm just gonna read it
[1:30:04] from their own
[1:30:05] website
[1:30:08] this is not this is not from hearsay
[1:30:10] this is what i copied
[1:30:12] right off of the black lives movement
[1:30:13] website of what they stand for
[1:30:16] we see ourselves as a part of the global
[1:30:18] black family
[1:30:19] we are aware of the different ways we
[1:30:21] are impacted or privileged as black
[1:30:22] people who exist
[1:30:24] in different parts of the world see it's
[1:30:26] a world wide thing
[1:30:27] we are guided by the fact that all lives
[1:30:30] all black lives matter regardless of
[1:30:33] actual
[1:30:34] or perceived sexual identity gender
[1:30:37] identity
[1:30:38] gender expression economic status
[1:30:41] ability disability
[1:30:42] religious beliefs disbeliefs immigration
[1:30:45] status
[1:30:45] or location we make space for
[1:30:47] transgender brothers and sisters to
[1:30:50] participate
[1:30:50] and lead we are self-reflective and do
[1:30:53] the work
[1:30:54] um to require to dismantle cisgender
[1:30:57] privilege and uplift
[1:30:59] black trans folk especially black trans
[1:31:02] women
[1:31:02] who continue to be disappoint personally
[1:31:05] impacted by trans antagonistic violence
[1:31:09] we build a space that affirms black
[1:31:11] women and is free from sexism
[1:31:14] misogyny and environments in which men
[1:31:16] are centered
[1:31:17] we practice empathy we engage comrades
[1:31:20] in the
[1:31:20] intent to learn about and connect with
[1:31:23] their context
[1:31:24] we make spaces make our spaces family
[1:31:27] friendly and enable parents to fully
[1:31:30] participate with their children
[1:31:32] we dismantle the patriot articles
[1:31:34] practice that requires mothers
[1:31:36] to work double shifts so they can
[1:31:38] leather in private even though they
[1:31:40] participate in public justice work we
[1:31:43] disrupt
[1:31:44] the western prescribed nuclear family
[1:31:48] you know what that is one male a man and
[1:31:51] a woman
[1:31:53] we disrupt the western prescribed
[1:31:56] nuclear family which consists of a man
[1:31:59] and a woman
[1:32:02] requirement by supporting each other is
[1:32:04] extended family and villages that
[1:32:06] collectively care for one another
[1:32:07] especially our children
[1:32:09] to the degrees that mothers parents and
[1:32:10] children are comfortable we
[1:32:12] we foster a queer affirming network
[1:32:16] when we gather we do so with the
[1:32:17] intention of freeing ourselves from the
[1:32:19] tight grip
[1:32:20] of heteronorma normative thinking or
[1:32:23] rather the belief that all
[1:32:25] in the world are heterosexual unless he
[1:32:27] or she
[1:32:28] or they disclose otherwise
[1:32:34] so what are you are seeing
[1:32:37] across america is sodomites
[1:32:43] oh no they're not they're not just black
[1:32:45] people they're white people too
[1:32:48] of all kinds gathered down there rioting
[1:32:51] in the streets
[1:32:52] tearing down defacing monuments
[1:32:56] erasing history
[1:32:58] [Applause]
[1:33:00] amen saying you know
[1:33:03] you know there's sodomites banging at
[1:33:06] the door of lot
[1:33:09] and they're banging on the door of
[1:33:11] christians in america
[1:33:13] and they're out to destroy the american
[1:33:16] life
[1:33:17] of christianity and it will and
[1:33:20] there we are an endangered species as
[1:33:23] christians
[1:33:27] and they are doing it as they did in the
[1:33:29] days of lot who made you to be a judge
[1:33:31] over
[1:33:32] us you have no right to judge us
[1:33:37] you can't call sin sin wrong rum
[1:33:42] if you do you will pay the penalty
[1:33:46] and they're demanding oh my if you read
[1:33:49] the book
[1:33:50] of genesis what happened there at sodom
[1:33:53] they demanded to have sex to pervert
[1:33:57] to desecrate angels
[1:34:02] and now even jesus christ to pervert him
[1:34:08] i got something to say about that
[1:34:11] because many many will reject jesus
[1:34:14] because he was a white man that's a lie
[1:34:20] jesus was not a white man
[1:34:24] neither was he a black man jesus was the
[1:34:28] god-man
[1:34:29] [Applause]
[1:34:30] he was the only begotten mean he is one
[1:34:32] of a kind
[1:34:34] there is none other like him
[1:34:44] and everyone that is born of jesus
[1:34:48] is neither black nor white or hispanic
[1:34:51] or native american
[1:34:52] but they too are god men and women
[1:34:58] born of the holy spirit washed by the
[1:35:01] blood
[1:35:01] and they have one vision and one faith
[1:35:03] and that is
[1:35:04] to be a part of the pride and leave from
[1:35:12] here
[1:35:19] thinking man's filter brother branham
[1:35:21] said o united states united states
[1:35:25] oh he says you're blindly old to see how
[1:35:28] god would have given you a revival but
[1:35:30] now your time has come it's too late now
[1:35:32] how you laughed and made fun of the
[1:35:34] people that god sent you
[1:35:35] but now your time has come
[1:35:38] o united states united states how that
[1:35:42] god would have hovered
[1:35:43] you as a hymn desert brood but you would
[1:35:45] not
[1:35:46] now this voice is going from coast to
[1:35:48] coast from north to south
[1:35:50] and from east to west how god would have
[1:35:52] ever
[1:35:53] over hovered you but you would not now
[1:35:56] your time is come nations are breaking
[1:36:00] the world's fallen apart
[1:36:01] 1500 mile chunk of it 300 or 400 miles
[1:36:05] wide will sink and
[1:36:06] maybe 40 miles down the great falls out
[1:36:08] you under one of these days
[1:36:10] waves shoot plum to the strait of
[1:36:11] kentucky when it does
[1:36:13] it'll shake the world so hard that
[1:36:14] everything on top of it
[1:36:16] will shake down don't forget there's a
[1:36:19] great earthquake
[1:36:20] at the resurrection oh hide me in the
[1:36:23] rock of angels
[1:36:25] god let me let me breathe upon me lord
[1:36:28] spirit of the living god breathe on me
[1:36:30] let me take god's filter and live under
[1:36:32] that lord
[1:36:33] let me breathe the fresh air of the holy
[1:36:35] ghost of my lungs and my soul every day
[1:36:37] that i'll sin not against you oh lord
[1:36:39] breathe on me
[1:36:41] holy spirit breathe on me
[1:36:52] we're a nation under judgment
[1:36:56] but hallelujah we're going to escape
[1:37:04] he'll snatch us out just in time it's an
[1:37:07] eagle anointing
[1:37:12] now brother branham told us very clearly
[1:37:17] that what is happening in the
[1:37:21] in our time he said the pentecostals
[1:37:24] had the wrong expectations and there's
[1:37:27] many in the message today
[1:37:29] are that you know said around the
[1:37:31] borders of the message
[1:37:32] they're still pentecostal in their
[1:37:34] thinking of what a revival
[1:37:37] is going to be what the next great move
[1:37:41] of god now i'm not going to be able to
[1:37:42] get into all today but i
[1:37:44] am going to deal on what the
[1:37:45] pentecostals are looking for
[1:37:48] in the message shalom he says there's
[1:37:50] gross darkness
[1:37:51] there's among the churches things today
[1:37:53] that fail to see the light
[1:37:55] that's shining there seems to be such a
[1:37:57] heavy press
[1:37:58] we take some of the notice evangelists
[1:38:00] today to constantly screaming for
[1:38:02] revival
[1:38:03] and working right against it see not
[1:38:06] understanding without understanding so
[1:38:08] if you don't have the right
[1:38:10] understanding
[1:38:11] of what the revival is going to be then
[1:38:14] you'll be working against
[1:38:16] it
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:19] because your expectations are wrong
[1:38:24] now in spiritual amnesia brother branham
[1:38:27] told us
[1:38:28] he said now this is the last sign
[1:38:33] remember thus saith the lord did you
[1:38:36] ever hear me say that but it was true
[1:38:38] you're seeing your last sign now
[1:38:40] remember that last sign
[1:38:42] it covers the coming of the son of man
[1:38:44] the revealing of the son of man
[1:38:46] and and then of course the manifestation
[1:38:49] in sarah
[1:38:50] and abraham because they were the ones
[1:38:53] to bring on the promised son
[1:38:56] and he said you've seen your last sign
[1:38:58] pentecost don't get
[1:38:59] mixed up with what he promised israel
[1:39:02] after the rapture that ain't you you're
[1:39:05] done then
[1:39:06] now is your day now is your sign now is
[1:39:08] your time don't reject it don't do it
[1:39:10] you better come now you believe me to be
[1:39:12] god's servant
[1:39:13] you need a revival you're dying you're
[1:39:16] taking spiritual amnesia
[1:39:18] you're dying don't do that revive that
[1:39:20] what you got and bring it up again
[1:39:22] quickly before jesus
[1:39:23] comes so again
[1:39:26] brother branham was telling us that
[1:39:29] don't get
[1:39:29] mixed up with what he promised israel
[1:39:33] so we're going to deal with some of this
[1:39:35] and so some of this is going to be
[1:39:37] some real teaching get your pen some
[1:39:38] paper out and get ready
[1:39:40] to to to take some um
[1:39:43] real important notes on that now
[1:39:46] recognizing your day in his message he
[1:39:48] said
[1:39:49] the atmosphere of the people at that
[1:39:51] time in the circles
[1:39:54] of pentecostal rounds he said
[1:39:57] there's no revival and people are
[1:39:58] complaining and ministers are crying
[1:40:02] and he said i was reading one of their
[1:40:03] outstanding papers
[1:40:05] where um you know there where they were
[1:40:08] um in the herald of his coming
[1:40:11] and they said well hardly print anything
[1:40:13] unless it's fast pray fast pray
[1:40:16] um sound a trumpet i said how many gifts
[1:40:19] reads it you know you see you see it all
[1:40:22] the time fast pray fast praise all you
[1:40:23] hear
[1:40:24] fast pray we're going to have a great
[1:40:26] break-in of the day
[1:40:27] there's going to be something going to
[1:40:30] happen
[1:40:32] and and there is a great thing going to
[1:40:34] happen and all you pray pray pray we're
[1:40:35] not too late yet
[1:40:37] and why did they do that why do they do
[1:40:39] that they want a great awakening
[1:40:41] and they're crying to believe and there
[1:40:42] will be an awakening
[1:40:44] they're good people what is it what is
[1:40:46] it done they have not recognized
[1:40:48] the awakening of the bride and but by
[1:40:51] being christians they feel the pull of
[1:40:53] the hour
[1:40:54] but they haven't recognized what has
[1:40:56] been done
[1:40:58] but that's what's making them feel that
[1:41:00] way and they know there's some something
[1:41:01] that may
[1:41:02] happen and they're looking for way off
[1:41:04] in the future to come and it's already
[1:41:05] happened right by you
[1:41:07] so god was doing a work calling out a
[1:41:09] bride for his namesake
[1:41:11] but because you know they were trying to
[1:41:14] you know make something happen
[1:41:16] manufacture a miracle you know get the
[1:41:18] gifts to working
[1:41:19] get get get uh tongues in the church
[1:41:22] the glossolalia began they fostered the
[1:41:26] charismatic movement
[1:41:30] which turned into a worldly bunch
[1:41:36] come on who won't be subject to the word
[1:41:40] of god
[1:41:43] it's the truth and they they run out on
[1:41:46] their
[1:41:46] their gifts and their spiritual uh they
[1:41:49] they think
[1:41:49] and and and they have certain elements
[1:41:51] of healing and deliverance
[1:41:53] and and certain kinds of things that you
[1:41:55] know gifts that happen and prophecies
[1:41:57] and so on
[1:41:58] but look at their lives
[1:42:02] married divorced remarried fornications
[1:42:05] in their man and their ministries and
[1:42:08] their preachers are double married
[1:42:10] their deacons are double married all
[1:42:11] kinds of things that are going on
[1:42:14] in the leadership of the church
[1:42:18] and it just becomes a big ballyhoo of
[1:42:21] emotions
[1:42:22] and it turns out to be and you know the
[1:42:25] working of the demonic spirits
[1:42:27] as they poof and people fall out and and
[1:42:30] and you know then they go into their
[1:42:32] laughing you know and everybody going
[1:42:34] into hysterical life and you ought to
[1:42:36] see it
[1:42:37] it'll make you sick in your stomach
[1:42:40] kenneth hagin it turned out there one of
[1:42:42] the leaders in this whole thing the
[1:42:43] teachers
[1:42:45] and they were crying for revival but
[1:42:47] that's what it produced
[1:42:52] now
[1:42:55] he said now he says
[1:42:59] he said recognize the date that we're
[1:43:01] living in the sign of the time
[1:43:02] see where everything is at israel where
[1:43:05] the church
[1:43:06] where the immoral where the bride is
[1:43:08] standing what's left the next thing
[1:43:11] is the taking up of the bride every
[1:43:14] church is looking for a great thing the
[1:43:16] pentecost say
[1:43:17] glory to god they'll come a day they're
[1:43:18] going to do this they're going to do
[1:43:19] that they're professors they do believe
[1:43:22] like one time campuses is it right isn't
[1:43:25] it right that one man should die
[1:43:27] not the whole nation perish and he was i
[1:43:29] priests and that's the reason he said
[1:43:30] that
[1:43:31] he prophesied not knowing what he was
[1:43:33] saying but
[1:43:34] he did he realized the truth of it that
[1:43:36] he was sacrificing the very god he
[1:43:38] claimed to be the high priest of
[1:43:39] so today so it is today they're looking
[1:43:42] yonder somewhere for a great time to
[1:43:44] come
[1:43:45] why go to the businessman's convention
[1:43:47] they say glory to god them preachers
[1:43:50] just get this
[1:43:50] disturb the crowd saying there's coming
[1:43:53] a great revival
[1:43:54] the hand of the lord is going to be upon
[1:43:56] the earth and all the people are going
[1:43:59] forth running and they don't realize
[1:44:00] that's under the trumpets
[1:44:02] for israel why do you do that
[1:44:05] because they're christian professors and
[1:44:07] they don't realize neither did campuses
[1:44:09] realize what he was doing
[1:44:10] and they don't realize they're rejecting
[1:44:13] the very message
[1:44:16] that was sent to them now there again
[1:44:19] they'll accept brother branham's
[1:44:20] miracles
[1:44:22] as genuine but they won't accept his
[1:44:25] message
[1:44:28] amen they'll crucify that now
[1:44:31] again in the 70th weeks brother branham
[1:44:34] said most are pentecostal brethren
[1:44:36] they'll disagree with this they're
[1:44:38] looking for a great powerful something
[1:44:40] to happen and my brethren
[1:44:42] if you listen real close and listen
[1:44:44] you'll find that that great
[1:44:45] powerful something has done past jesus
[1:44:48] is ready to return
[1:44:51] now we're talking about what's going to
[1:44:52] happen with the gentile
[1:44:54] he said the church leaves on the third
[1:44:57] chapter of revelation
[1:44:59] amen for the next chapter in chapter 4
[1:45:02] is the call come up hither
[1:45:04] right and he says then we deal with the
[1:45:07] the jew
[1:45:08] then we deal with the jews until the
[1:45:09] coming again of the bride and
[1:45:11] in the 19th chapter and
[1:45:14] so on and on and he then he says not
[1:45:16] pentecostal brethren
[1:45:18] he said do you know where the 144 000
[1:45:21] appeared do you know where all the great
[1:45:23] miracles of revelation appeared
[1:45:25] over in the jewish age not ours
[1:45:30] there's nothing recorded in it just the
[1:45:32] church getting ready and going out sure
[1:45:34] with the power of god we can work do
[1:45:36] work miracles and exploits we know that
[1:45:39] but the real thing was over here to the
[1:45:40] jews i mean the real working power
[1:45:43] miracle working they're going to shut
[1:45:46] the heavens
[1:45:47] they'll keep it from raining they'll
[1:45:49] control nature
[1:45:52] they'll bring down plagues
[1:45:57] amen this is this is this is something
[1:46:01] are you listening to me this is
[1:46:03] something for israel
[1:46:04] that's going to happen over there and
[1:46:06] and again he says
[1:46:08] he says that remember as soon as the
[1:46:10] church age the church goes
[1:46:12] then the jews take hold come in first
[1:46:14] thing next in the order is not a
[1:46:17] mighty national revival amongst the
[1:46:19] gentiles the next thing
[1:46:20] in order is the coming of the kingdom of
[1:46:22] god the coming of christ
[1:46:25] so i want your expectations to be right
[1:46:28] we're not going to have another national
[1:46:29] revival
[1:46:31] and we're not going to have another
[1:46:32] world revival the next thing is the
[1:46:34] coming of jesus christ
[1:46:36] but there will be revival at that coming
[1:46:39] there will be a people on fire for god
[1:46:41] there will not be a laodicea
[1:46:43] and there will be the mighty works of
[1:46:45] god performed in her midst
[1:46:50] question answers in 1962
[1:46:54] brother branham talks about that the
[1:46:56] tribulation period
[1:46:58] the church raptures and goes up at the
[1:47:00] fourth chapter of revelation
[1:47:02] never comes again until the 19th chapter
[1:47:05] when it comes
[1:47:05] with jesus that's right that's in the
[1:47:08] tribulation period not nothing to do
[1:47:09] with the church at all
[1:47:11] so what's he saying the bride is
[1:47:13] raptured in the fourth chapter
[1:47:17] and from revelation
[1:47:20] 4 to revelation 19
[1:47:24] is when when god is dealing with israel
[1:47:27] on earth
[1:47:28] but if there's a scene in there that
[1:47:30] applies to the bride
[1:47:32] it will happen over here in revelation 3
[1:47:36] before the rapture under the seventh
[1:47:39] church age
[1:47:40] message are you with me
[1:47:44] now i i wonder i want you to say in this
[1:47:47] because
[1:47:47] brother branham did not spiritualize
[1:47:51] revelation he did not spiritualize that
[1:47:55] this is most message preachers do and
[1:47:57] they're an era
[1:47:59] i just say it brothers you missed it you
[1:48:02] don't spiritualize where the prophet
[1:48:04] spoke of it as literal
[1:48:07] amen so they spiritualize the rapture
[1:48:10] until they trivialize and minimize the
[1:48:13] literal physical return
[1:48:15] and the median in the air
[1:48:18] and here's where the bride physically
[1:48:21] goes up
[1:48:22] in the rapture i want to show it to you
[1:48:25] it's at the end of the church ages
[1:48:29] well you just show me um adriana just
[1:48:31] pulled it down
[1:48:32] revelation 3 and and give me the last
[1:48:35] three or four verses just flash them out
[1:48:37] for us this is a laodicean church age
[1:48:40] just flash them on the screen the last
[1:48:42] three of them i stand at the door and
[1:48:44] knock
[1:48:45] again next one to him that overcometh
[1:48:49] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:48:51] and then is there another one and he
[1:48:54] that hath an ear to hear
[1:48:55] you see what's now revelation 4 1 the
[1:48:58] next verse
[1:49:00] laodicea ends as she ends
[1:49:04] this happens after
[1:49:07] this after the seven church ages when
[1:49:11] they complete
[1:49:12] behold a door was opened in heaven
[1:49:16] an entrance was made in heaven and the
[1:49:19] first voice i heard was a trumpet
[1:49:21] talking to me which said come up hither
[1:49:24] and john being a man he
[1:49:28] represents and symbol the entire bride
[1:49:32] by being caught up into the heavens at
[1:49:34] the end of the seventh church age
[1:49:38] and we are in the seventh church age
[1:49:41] and under the seventh angel's message
[1:49:43] until
[1:49:44] the rapture of the church
[1:49:53] and when the brightest caught up leo to
[1:49:56] see a ends
[1:49:58] until that laodicea is still going on
[1:50:01] the laodicean messenger is still the
[1:50:03] messenger
[1:50:04] and his message is still in effect and
[1:50:06] we are the overcomers
[1:50:08] of the laodicean age
[1:50:13] all right so now again
[1:50:16] again the voice the trumpet says come up
[1:50:19] hither
[1:50:21] now this is the trumpet of
[1:50:25] first thessalonians 4 16.
[1:50:30] are you with me amen this revelation
[1:50:33] revelation 4 1 tells us what the trumpet
[1:50:36] is saying
[1:50:38] it's not just making a sound it's saying
[1:50:40] something
[1:50:41] a trumpet sounds and it says retreat a
[1:50:43] trumpet sounds and it says go forward
[1:50:46] a trumpet sounds and it gives the clues
[1:50:48] to what is going on
[1:50:49] this trumpet when it sounds has come up
[1:50:51] hither
[1:50:54] leave the earth and go into the rapture
[1:50:57] first thessalonians 4 16 says
[1:51:00] and for the lord himself shall descend
[1:51:02] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:51:03] of archangel with the trumpet god and
[1:51:05] the dead and christ shall rise first
[1:51:08] that's revelation 4 1. until that
[1:51:11] happens
[1:51:12] revelation 4 1 has not happened
[1:51:16] again again first corinthians 5 15 15 52
[1:51:21] first corinthians 15
[1:51:22] 52 let's look at this one and i just
[1:51:26] want to
[1:51:26] make this clear
[1:51:29] all the scriptures are on things back up
[1:51:32] one verse if you will
[1:51:34] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[1:51:36] all sleep but we shall all be changed
[1:51:38] next verse
[1:51:39] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:51:41] where
[1:51:43] at the last trump
[1:51:48] and the last trump is revelation 4 1
[1:51:52] and it says leave the earth and go into
[1:51:54] glory and
[1:51:55] john types the entire bride by being
[1:51:58] lifted up into the heavens
[1:52:00] into the eternals and that's what
[1:52:02] happens at the end of the two changes
[1:52:05] and brother branham never spiritualizes
[1:52:07] this
[1:52:09] men do preachers do but brother brahman
[1:52:11] doesn't
[1:52:14] when will they be changed at the last
[1:52:17] trump
[1:52:18] for the trumpet shall sound
[1:52:21] and the dead shall be raised
[1:52:24] incorruptible and we
[1:52:25] shall be changed
[1:52:29] when the last trump
[1:52:35] you talk about the divine healing
[1:52:36] movement
[1:52:40] oh hallelujah amen we've never seen a
[1:52:44] divine healing movement like this
[1:52:48] the oil will be turned young again gray
[1:52:51] hair will come back the right color
[1:52:53] missile limbs will be restored the
[1:52:56] will walk and the blind will see
[1:53:01] we are on the brink of the greatest
[1:53:03] divine healing movement ever
[1:53:05] and it won't be 15 years and it will not
[1:53:08] it will not build up a denomination or
[1:53:11] some man's kingdom
[1:53:12] it'll take a bride and a rapture
[1:53:14] [Applause]
[1:53:18] hallelujah how would you like to come
[1:53:20] across some prayer the the platform
[1:53:22] you know for for prayer to have your
[1:53:24] gray hair turn back the right color
[1:53:28] huh that would be a healing wouldn't it
[1:53:31] a miracle healer
[1:53:32] well i'll tell you hey man there won't
[1:53:34] be no bald heads there
[1:53:40] hallelujah amen there won't be a
[1:53:43] hey there ain't going to be no old
[1:53:45] people there people
[1:53:46] people ridicule me for having a youth
[1:53:48] camp well brother
[1:53:49] there ain't going to be no old folks
[1:53:51] there's going to be one glorious youth
[1:53:53] camp
[1:53:55] we're all going to be young and immortal
[1:53:58] again
[1:54:00] never to die never to sucker sorrow pain
[1:54:03] sickness the greatest divine healing
[1:54:06] movement
[1:54:07] ever is right on the birds
[1:54:16] we're right on the edge of it
[1:54:20] any moment somebody could tap you on the
[1:54:22] shoulder
[1:54:23] it could be your mother your brother
[1:54:26] someone that's done going on
[1:54:28] and say it's on
[1:54:38] hallelujah and gabriel's instruction to
[1:54:42] daniel
[1:54:43] now in the fourth chapter john was
[1:54:45] caught up immediately after the church
[1:54:48] john going up he saw the
[1:54:51] complete church age there's where i'd
[1:54:54] like to stop for a second to say
[1:54:56] that people are looking for something
[1:54:57] great tremendous powerful
[1:55:00] something to happen the gentile age are
[1:55:02] certainly wrong
[1:55:04] the church age and all that happened
[1:55:05] during the gentile reign
[1:55:07] is recorded in revelation 1
[1:55:11] to 3 inclusive
[1:55:14] then the church was raptured and taken
[1:55:16] up in the rest under this 19th chapter
[1:55:19] is what happens to the jewish race
[1:55:20] after the church has gone up and it's a
[1:55:22] time of great tribulation
[1:55:24] nothing to happen among the gentiles
[1:55:26] only the slaughter and so forth we get
[1:55:27] to
[1:55:28] but the church itself is gone on the
[1:55:30] last verse of the third chapter of
[1:55:32] revelation when the
[1:55:33] late ocean church age ends
[1:55:37] oh my goodness amen this bright age
[1:55:41] is the overcomers of the laodicean age
[1:55:47] now brother branham and i want you to
[1:55:50] write this down
[1:55:51] brother branham teaches it this way all
[1:55:53] through
[1:55:54] the revelation series in the breach
[1:55:57] paragraph 23
[1:55:58] in the first seal paragraph 18 the fifth
[1:56:02] seal
[1:56:02] paragraph 87 and 218
[1:56:05] question answers on the seals 337
[1:56:09] and in the in the seventh seal he's
[1:56:11] still saying this
[1:56:13] i'm going to read this one now remember
[1:56:16] after the fourth chapter of revelation
[1:56:18] the church is gone
[1:56:20] after the four horse riders went out
[1:56:22] church is gone everything that happened
[1:56:23] to church happened
[1:56:24] up to the fourth chapter of the book of
[1:56:27] revelation
[1:56:28] he's still saying this in the seventh
[1:56:29] seal
[1:56:33] feasts of the trumpets where he
[1:56:36] separates what belongs to the jews and
[1:56:38] what belongs to us amen
[1:56:41] paragraph 37 he says the same
[1:56:44] future home through the invisible union
[1:56:47] he's still referencing the summons on
[1:56:48] high
[1:56:50] come up hither brother bradham taught it
[1:56:52] this way
[1:56:53] from before the seals during the seals
[1:56:55] and after the seals
[1:56:57] the bride is raptured in the laodicean
[1:56:59] age and as she does the laodicean age
[1:57:02] closes
[1:57:04] so you say but what about the seals
[1:57:06] brother tim there
[1:57:07] there after chapter 4. aren't you coming
[1:57:10] in the mess there
[1:57:11] yeah you know i i get your point but
[1:57:15] remember
[1:57:16] anything that though that happens to the
[1:57:19] bride
[1:57:20] must happen in the 7th church ages
[1:57:25] in chapters one through three
[1:57:28] so if the seals are open
[1:57:31] come on they happen back over here for
[1:57:34] the gentiles
[1:57:36] in revelation 3 under the seventh
[1:57:38] angel's message
[1:57:40] chapters 4 through 19 shows different
[1:57:42] scenes you go through different scenes
[1:57:45] he takes you from one scene to another
[1:57:46] to another to another to another
[1:57:49] it's a series of visions and it shows
[1:57:52] you
[1:57:53] on the seventh seal book in the book
[1:57:56] open
[1:57:56] and the seven trumpets the ceiling of
[1:57:59] the hundred and forty four thousand
[1:58:00] the mighty angel revelation ten the two
[1:58:02] witnesses
[1:58:03] the war in heaven the cast casting down
[1:58:05] of satan the going up of the bride the
[1:58:07] lamb with the
[1:58:07] 144 thousand the seven vials the great
[1:58:10] the call to come out of her my
[1:58:11] people
[1:58:12] the judgment of the great until
[1:58:14] the new jerusalem
[1:58:16] is ushered in
[1:58:19] you see if it's for the gentiles
[1:58:23] and if it happens on earth
[1:58:26] it must happen in the last church age
[1:58:31] in revelation chapter 3.
[1:58:34] under the seventh angel's message
[1:58:39] you see this rules out all of these
[1:58:41] wannabe
[1:58:43] newcomers one want to be prophets who i
[1:58:48] tell and when another one shows up just
[1:58:50] take a number and get in line
[1:58:55] wait your turn to be told nah
[1:58:58] you ain't got it
[1:59:04] now again if it happens for the jews
[1:59:10] it must i and i'm talking about 144 000
[1:59:13] here
[1:59:14] it must happen after chapter 4
[1:59:19] which is the going away of the bride
[1:59:21] amen
[1:59:22] if it's an event for the bride in
[1:59:25] revelation 4 to 19
[1:59:27] that it must happen in the church ages
[1:59:31] in revelation one two three because
[1:59:33] that's the only time that god
[1:59:35] deals with the bride the church
[1:59:41] from revelation chapter one through
[1:59:43] three is god dealing with his bride to
[1:59:45] the ages
[1:59:46] and he also addresses the false church
[1:59:49] revelation four one
[1:59:50] is the rapture would you would you like
[1:59:53] to go with me
[1:59:54] through this for a moment just kind of
[1:59:55] flip your bible revelation 4 1 is the
[1:59:58] rapture
[2:00:00] the remainder of chapter 4 shows the
[2:00:02] throne and the one who sits upon it
[2:00:05] chapter 5 is the scene of redemption
[2:00:09] spanning from adam's loss of the book to
[2:00:11] the coming of the redeemer
[2:00:13] to finally all creation worships god at
[2:00:16] the conclusion of revelation 5.
[2:00:18] all creation worships god so it's a
[2:00:20] process
[2:00:22] so when we look at the book of
[2:00:24] redemption and the opening
[2:00:26] of it it starts with adam losing it and
[2:00:28] the
[2:00:29] plight of man all down to the ages jesus
[2:00:31] coming as redeemer
[2:00:32] while the what god holds it in his hand
[2:00:34] the lamb steps forth to take the book
[2:00:36] and he loses the seals he reveals the
[2:00:38] mystery he opens the book and it brings
[2:00:40] it back to the people
[2:00:42] are you with me so revelation chapter 5
[2:00:45] is the scene of redemption
[2:00:47] revelation chapter 6 is a showing of the
[2:00:50] symbols of the book
[2:00:51] which are revealed in the seventh
[2:00:53] angel's message in the last church age
[2:00:57] again again the opening of the seals
[2:01:00] exposes the working of satan
[2:01:03] the mystery of iniquity showing the
[2:01:05] working of the antichrist as the four
[2:01:07] horse riders
[2:01:09] the fifth seal shows the fate of the
[2:01:11] jews who died for the testimony
[2:01:13] during the times of the gentiles
[2:01:16] from and they they're from the rejection
[2:01:19] of christ to them finally accepting
[2:01:20] their messiah
[2:01:22] in the sixth seal with 145 4 000 being
[2:01:24] filled with the same holy ghost the
[2:01:26] gentile bride received
[2:01:28] the the sixth seal shows the tribulation
[2:01:31] and those that are saved this happens
[2:01:33] after revelation 4.
[2:01:36] and and again the multitude without
[2:01:38] number which is the jewish
[2:01:40] i mean the gentile remnant the church
[2:01:42] not the bride
[2:01:44] and the 144 thousand and the judgment
[2:01:46] upon the earth in the great tribulation
[2:01:48] the seventh seal covers the rapture
[2:01:53] of the bride to her coming back with
[2:01:56] christ
[2:01:57] in the great battle of armageddon so it
[2:02:00] goes
[2:02:00] all the way from the breaking of the
[2:02:02] silence
[2:02:03] under the seventh angel's message and
[2:02:06] the revealing of the seven thunders
[2:02:08] to give us faith for a rapture it
[2:02:10] raptures that bride it continues on
[2:02:13] ending up all things until it brings
[2:02:15] christ back again with the bride
[2:02:17] so the seventh seal is a process that
[2:02:20] goes
[2:02:20] all the way from the prophet's message
[2:02:23] to
[2:02:24] bringing christ back again in revelation
[2:02:27] 19.
[2:02:28] that's all the seventh seal it spans
[2:02:30] that whole thing
[2:02:32] now again revelation chapter 7
[2:02:35] is the ceiling of the 144 thousand
[2:02:38] revelation chapter 8 is the trumpets
[2:02:41] that gathered israel back to their
[2:02:43] promised land
[2:02:45] and they will be revealed to the jews
[2:02:48] as the thunders were revealed to us
[2:02:51] by our prophet and as he brought us out
[2:02:55] of world religion
[2:02:56] traditions he will the the um the
[2:03:00] the great the the great
[2:03:03] um two witnesses will bring the jews out
[2:03:06] of their traditions
[2:03:08] as brother branham said of sacrificing
[2:03:10] geese and chickens which they didn't do
[2:03:12] but it's just as well might have been
[2:03:15] amen because the blood does not atone
[2:03:17] somebody help me amen coming back to the
[2:03:20] real atonement point them back to the
[2:03:22] real atonement
[2:03:23] our seventh angel does the same for us
[2:03:24] and brings us back to the real atonement
[2:03:27] all right which is jesus christ
[2:03:30] all right so again our atonement's not
[2:03:32] in the church it's not in rome it's not
[2:03:34] a
[2:03:34] denomination our atonement's in jesus
[2:03:38] all right so now again revelation
[2:03:41] chapter 8 is the trumpets
[2:03:43] that gather them back to their promised
[2:03:44] land question answer 64. i believe
[2:03:47] you're seeing the last thing that
[2:03:49] happened to the church before the
[2:03:50] rapture
[2:03:51] that's exactly i believe it the rain is
[2:03:53] over just remember
[2:03:54] just read the first three chapters of
[2:03:56] revelation and you'll see what's
[2:03:58] promised to the church
[2:03:59] that's what's promised church right
[2:04:01] there the church ages you notice the
[2:04:03] other day
[2:04:04] when we started them trump's holy spirit
[2:04:05] said that don't belong here
[2:04:08] and he said now ladder rain 144 000 jews
[2:04:11] no that is that's when
[2:04:12] moses and elijah that's where the
[2:04:14] miracles take place the things
[2:04:16] the peoples that uh that been looking
[2:04:18] for the pentecostals for miracles
[2:04:20] that's where that will take place unto
[2:04:22] them see that's moses and elijah they
[2:04:24] will smite the earth with curses
[2:04:26] as they will they'll close the heavens
[2:04:28] that it don't reign in the days of the
[2:04:29] prophecy
[2:04:30] and god will stand and fight for them as
[2:04:32] he did and he'll bring them out with a
[2:04:33] mighty hand
[2:04:34] just like he did in egypt out of the
[2:04:36] isms of the world and he'll
[2:04:38] do that we are just to wait
[2:04:41] on the coming of the lord
[2:04:45] amen this is our revival the rapture is
[2:04:49] our revival
[2:04:52] and it will crescendo in our body change
[2:04:56] in the greatest divine healing movement
[2:04:58] that's ever been
[2:05:04] but it won't last long
[2:05:08] and it won't be a preacher laying hands
[2:05:10] on you
[2:05:15] what's that sudden change
[2:05:18] when he sweeps over you and you're
[2:05:21] changed in the moment
[2:05:22] in the twinkle of an eye and in just a
[2:05:25] few minutes you're traveling like a
[2:05:26] thought
[2:05:33] and then we all get together and meet
[2:05:36] one another
[2:05:39] and embrace one another what a day of
[2:05:41] rejoicing that will be
[2:05:44] and then we'll get ready for the great
[2:05:46] appearing
[2:05:47] of our lord jesus in the air
[2:05:50] the world won't seem but we will
[2:05:54] because we'll see him with a different
[2:05:56] set of eyes
[2:05:57] looking in dimensions that men have
[2:05:59] never looked in before
[2:06:03] in mass like that
[2:06:07] easter seal brother branham said can't
[2:06:10] you see
[2:06:11] spirit-filled people something's fixing
[2:06:12] to happen don't look for some great big
[2:06:15] universal something sweeping nothing but
[2:06:17] the coming of the lord jesus
[2:06:18] remember just remember the words in the
[2:06:22] promise of the lord
[2:06:24] all right chapter 9
[2:06:27] concerning the chapter is illusion of
[2:06:30] the evil spirits
[2:06:32] somewhere out there a year the river
[2:06:34] euphrates others
[2:06:36] come that come out of hell with torment
[2:06:38] upon the earth
[2:06:40] a spirit of insanity that begins to move
[2:06:43] upon the earth
[2:06:45] are you with me we're already seeing
[2:06:47] pre-tribulation plagues and that
[2:06:49] insanity coming in
[2:06:50] now is that right amen chapter 10
[2:06:54] is a scene showing the coming of christ
[2:06:58] the mighty angel with the open book
[2:07:04] that was once closed somebody said help
[2:07:06] me now and
[2:07:07] handed that book to the bride of jesus
[2:07:10] christ
[2:07:10] and her eating it and prophesying again
[2:07:15] and that happens in the last church age
[2:07:21] now you can spiritualize this coming
[2:07:23] because it's not a physical return
[2:07:27] it's not a 900 foot tall jesus with one
[2:07:30] great big foot on the land and the other
[2:07:32] on the sea
[2:07:33] these are symbolic of him holding the
[2:07:36] powers of hell down
[2:07:38] where the the beast rises oh hallelujah
[2:07:42] glory to god rises out of the sea
[2:07:45] that's wrong rise it out of the earth
[2:07:48] that's america
[2:07:50] and he holds her down oh don't you know
[2:07:52] what you're doing
[2:07:53] you are those feet those pillars of fire
[2:07:56] and you're here on the earth holding
[2:07:57] down
[2:07:58] those powers and when this bride
[2:08:02] is lifted up and her feet lifts off the
[2:08:04] earth
[2:08:05] and the holy ghost lifts up off the
[2:08:07] earth those pillars of fire
[2:08:11] all hell breaks loose because then
[2:08:15] those powers can come into full fruition
[2:08:22] this is not the physical coming it's
[2:08:24] showing symbolically the anointing
[2:08:26] that is coming down did you know you are
[2:08:28] anointed by a mighty angel
[2:08:32] hallelujah christ himself finishing the
[2:08:34] mystery amen revealing it to revelation
[2:08:37] 10
[2:08:38] 7 the prophet of the last age somebody
[2:08:40] help me preach
[2:08:41] amen then the continuation of that same
[2:08:44] ministry and the bride as she eats the
[2:08:45] book for she must prophesy
[2:08:47] the same message again to ever kindred
[2:08:49] and tongue and nation and we've been
[2:08:51] doing it
[2:08:53] glory to god we're part of it prophesy
[2:08:56] now
[2:08:57] revelation chapter 11 is the same
[2:08:59] anointing
[2:09:00] if you notice it begins with and it is
[2:09:03] the same anointing that was upon the
[2:09:05] pride
[2:09:06] comes there upon the two witnesses in
[2:09:09] their ministry and the crucifixion
[2:09:11] and and their rapture that takes place
[2:09:14] under them
[2:09:15] somebody with me now because now that
[2:09:17] when the bride leaves the holy spirit
[2:09:20] moves right over
[2:09:21] and anoints the two witnesses and and
[2:09:24] they begin their ministry
[2:09:27] all right now let's just stop a minute
[2:09:31] because i know there are those that are
[2:09:32] listening to me they think brother
[2:09:34] branham is going to be one of the
[2:09:35] witnesses maybe the elijah
[2:09:37] that's going to go to to uh to israel
[2:09:43] and brother branham got ready to go if
[2:09:44] you remember
[2:09:46] how many has ever seen the the video
[2:09:49] film of the 20th century prophet and you
[2:09:52] see two men brother cop
[2:09:54] and and them coming there to um
[2:09:57] interview brother branham
[2:09:59] now this was a big ordeal
[2:10:02] they were spending thousands of dollars
[2:10:06] flying into jeffersonville meeting
[2:10:07] brother branham in his home
[2:10:09] setting all this up interviewing him and
[2:10:11] get it getting ready for an israel
[2:10:13] campaign
[2:10:21] brother branham gets ready to go he gets
[2:10:23] to cairo
[2:10:27] louis petrus had said you know if you go
[2:10:31] there brother branham now he was a big
[2:10:33] pentecostal leader in europe
[2:10:35] he had sent over a million
[2:10:38] bibles into israel new testaments
[2:10:44] figure out that cost
[2:10:48] that rented facilities
[2:10:51] they got all of it together
[2:10:55] brother branham's in cairo
[2:10:58] he gets that far
[2:11:01] and he said you know they're they're
[2:11:03] they're all helped up about this they
[2:11:05] have sent
[2:11:05] us video all over the place they've
[2:11:07] collected money from everywhere
[2:11:09] they're going to have a campaign we're
[2:11:11] going to turn israel back to god
[2:11:13] they'll see the sign of that prophet
[2:11:15] he'll discern the thoughts of the heart
[2:11:16] just like they did in abraham and
[2:11:19] they've always believed their prophets
[2:11:21] and brother adam you'll come
[2:11:22] and you'll show this sign and and there
[2:11:25] will be
[2:11:26] millions of them jews turn to god
[2:11:31] and what an opportunity he got over
[2:11:35] there
[2:11:36] and he got into to um
[2:11:39] there they were telling him brother
[2:11:41] argent brother branham it's just gonna
[2:11:43] alarm israel and bring them out and show
[2:11:44] them the sign of the prophet they'll
[2:11:46] believe it
[2:11:47] and he said i'm ready lord i'm ready
[2:11:49] he's ready to fulfill that bring israel
[2:11:51] back to
[2:11:52] god and the holy spirit stopped him in
[2:11:55] cairo
[2:11:59] he said i jumped on a plane now this is
[2:12:01] no little thing
[2:12:03] this is in the 50s and it's no little
[2:12:06] thing to jump on a plane
[2:12:08] and go across the seas
[2:12:11] you literally hop from little airports
[2:12:13] to airports and
[2:12:15] so on like that and finally get there
[2:12:18] this is
[2:12:19] no little thing
[2:12:22] and he's in cairo that's egypt he's
[2:12:25] about to make the next jump
[2:12:27] probably into tel aviv
[2:12:30] he said he was in cairo and he said the
[2:12:35] holy spirit said
[2:12:36] this is not your place
[2:12:41] i'm reading you i'm reading it to you
[2:12:43] from the the very sermon recognizing
[2:12:45] your day in this message this
[2:12:47] is not your place
[2:12:50] god made it known it was not his place
[2:12:54] to be the prophet to israel
[2:12:57] this is not your time so you get ahead
[2:13:00] of yourself i thought oh my
[2:13:02] i've come way over here i'm going to go
[2:13:07] and something said stop right here don't
[2:13:09] you go that way turn on to
[2:13:11] india don't go that way go to india but
[2:13:13] don't you go here
[2:13:16] and i thought why and i walked out the
[2:13:17] hangar and i said lord jesus
[2:13:19] what does this mean and he made known to
[2:13:21] me no gentile
[2:13:24] these prophets are the one it has to be
[2:13:26] according to scripture
[2:13:27] moses and elijah has to come and besides
[2:13:31] the bride hasn't been taken out of the
[2:13:32] way yet
[2:13:34] and then prophets will return and they
[2:13:36] will do the sign of the prophet
[2:13:38] that's the scripture there it is all
[2:13:42] fulfilled perfectly israel as a nation
[2:13:44] will be born in one day
[2:13:49] so you for you return ministry people
[2:13:52] the elijah to the jews is not brother
[2:13:55] branham
[2:13:57] he was denied the opportunity to preach
[2:14:00] the trumpets
[2:14:01] even because they were not his message
[2:14:03] [Applause]
[2:14:05] this is for the jews it's not your
[2:14:07] message you're not allowed to preach
[2:14:09] them
[2:14:10] come on and let me just say out here to
[2:14:13] the
[2:14:14] never never land out there if you're
[2:14:15] listening if you think one
[2:14:17] that you're one of the two witnesses
[2:14:19] then
[2:14:21] number one you don't have the holy ghost
[2:14:24] yet
[2:14:28] number two you are identifying yourself
[2:14:31] as not the bride but the jewish remnant
[2:14:33] so you're not bribed
[2:14:37] number three your message is a
[2:14:39] tribulation message and it'll never
[2:14:41] rapture the church
[2:14:44] number four you have to you have to be
[2:14:47] an israeli and not a gentile and you
[2:14:49] better get over israel because god can't
[2:14:51] bless you and fill you with the holy
[2:14:53] ghost
[2:14:53] until you get in your promised land
[2:14:56] you can't be blessed out of your
[2:14:57] promised land number five
[2:14:59] and don't be thinking the name of jesus
[2:15:01] is not effective and you got to say
[2:15:03] yeshua
[2:15:04] because brother branham clearly
[2:15:05] identified that thought as a cult
[2:15:09] and number six and don't think you're
[2:15:11] going to reveal the thunders because
[2:15:13] they've already been revealed
[2:15:16] and you can't reveal something that's
[2:15:18] already been revealed
[2:15:20] it's not a mystery no more we know what
[2:15:22] the thunders are
[2:15:23] they were once sealed up but now they're
[2:15:25] revealed they were once a sealed voice
[2:15:27] but now god has spoke out
[2:15:29] now we know what the thunders are they
[2:15:31] were the mysteries
[2:15:33] of the seven seals amen once they were
[2:15:36] symbols but now they're not symbols
[2:15:38] anymore we
[2:15:39] didn't have the voice and besides
[2:15:43] that's the seventh angel's job
[2:15:47] and he didn't need some profit some
[2:15:49] apostle to come along
[2:15:51] and bring clarity because that brought
[2:15:55] only confusion and division
[2:15:58] all right let's go on chapter 12.
[2:16:04] is the war between michael and lucifer
[2:16:07] and the casting out of satan and the
[2:16:09] going
[2:16:10] up of the bride so again if the bride is
[2:16:13] raptured it happens right over here
[2:16:16] in the last church age at the end of it
[2:16:20] so satan gets cast down when as the
[2:16:23] bride goes up
[2:16:24] chapter 13 is a scene that shows the
[2:16:27] beast of rome
[2:16:28] the beast that rises up out of america
[2:16:31] and the image
[2:16:32] to the bc a communicable spirit with its
[2:16:34] cancelled culture
[2:16:35] so that no one can by herself without
[2:16:37] complying complying to their demands
[2:16:40] revelation 14 through 15 deals with 144
[2:16:44] 000 during the tribulation revelation 16
[2:16:47] is the vials poured out by the seven
[2:16:49] angels
[2:16:52] which by the way
[2:16:55] are not angels they are men
[2:17:04] punch your neighbor and wake them up
[2:17:10] surely teaching don't bore you
[2:17:16] good thing i want you to look at this
[2:17:20] real close
[2:17:22] i want you to look at this revelation 16
[2:17:25] is the vials poured out by the seven
[2:17:27] angels
[2:17:29] they are stored up judgments
[2:17:32] that could not be poured out in the
[2:17:34] church ages
[2:17:36] that are reserved to be poured out on
[2:17:38] the beast in the last age
[2:17:43] now god hears so those
[2:17:46] those little martyrs back there that
[2:17:48] says god you're witnessing all of this
[2:17:50] you remember god said well i can't wipe
[2:17:54] out the beast now
[2:17:55] but i'll store this up
[2:17:59] because i'm going to bring judgment on
[2:18:00] those that persecuted you
[2:18:05] because i don't forget vengeance is mine
[2:18:08] i will repay saith god
[2:18:10] amen and you know and why do i say there
[2:18:14] are men
[2:18:15] because the last angel
[2:18:18] the one who held the seventh vial
[2:18:23] when he when it when john saw him
[2:18:26] and he was revealing things to him and
[2:18:28] showing him all kinds of things he was
[2:18:30] re
[2:18:30] he was taking him through the judgment
[2:18:32] of the and all this and the
[2:18:34] in the new city and this and that and he
[2:18:36] fell down to worship him
[2:18:38] and he said don't do it i'm a prophet
[2:18:42] i'm one of your fellow servants
[2:18:47] is that right so they're men and
[2:18:52] when the bride is having the marriage
[2:18:55] supper
[2:18:57] the tribulation has happened on the
[2:18:59] earth
[2:19:01] and part of our victory celebrations
[2:19:04] in heaven will be
[2:19:08] us gathering over the banister and
[2:19:10] watching an angel pour out a vial
[2:19:18] and we'll shout and dance
[2:19:21] and glorify god as it's poured out upon
[2:19:24] the earth
[2:19:25] in the tribulation period while we're at
[2:19:27] the marriage supper of the lamb
[2:19:31] hallelujah amen it will be
[2:19:34] forgive me for saying this but it'll be
[2:19:36] some of the entertainment
[2:19:39] provided at the marriage supper
[2:19:50] so i don't buy that brother tim huh go
[2:19:53] with me to revelation 19 verse one let's
[2:19:55] just watch it
[2:19:58] and after these things i heard a great
[2:19:59] voice of much people in heaven say of
[2:20:01] hallelujah
[2:20:03] salvation and glory and honor and power
[2:20:05] into our god
[2:20:06] for true and righteous serious judgment
[2:20:09] for he had judged the great
[2:20:11] which did corrupt the earth with with
[2:20:13] his fornication
[2:20:14] and avenge the blood of his servant and
[2:20:17] again they said
[2:20:19] hallelujah is that rejoicing or not
[2:20:24] amen and her smoke rules forever and
[2:20:27] ever
[2:20:28] and the and twenty elders and the four
[2:20:30] beasts fell down
[2:20:31] and worshiped god that sat on the throne
[2:20:34] saying amen
[2:20:35] hallelujah and the voice came out of the
[2:20:37] throne said praise our god
[2:20:38] all you his servants and you that fear
[2:20:40] him both small and great
[2:20:42] and i heard as it was a voice of a great
[2:20:44] multitude
[2:20:46] lord of god i'm in that multitude
[2:20:50] you are part of that multitude you were
[2:20:53] prophesied to be there
[2:20:57] amen as the voice of many waters is a
[2:21:00] voice of mighty thunder and saying
[2:21:02] hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent
[2:21:06] reigneth
[2:21:07] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[2:21:10] honor to him for the marriage of the
[2:21:13] lamb has come
[2:21:14] and his wife has made herself ready and
[2:21:17] to her was granted that she should be
[2:21:19] arrayed with fine linen
[2:21:20] clean and white for fine linen is the
[2:21:23] righteousness of the saints
[2:21:24] and he ends up saying these are the true
[2:21:27] saiyans of god
[2:21:28] blessed are they that are called to the
[2:21:30] marriage supper
[2:21:33] now then so in revelation 16 and 17 the
[2:21:37] vials are poured out the sort of
[2:21:39] judgments and they happen during the
[2:21:41] time that we
[2:21:43] are at the marriage supper the lamb they
[2:21:45] don't happen in the church age
[2:21:47] they happen after the rapture
[2:21:50] revelation 17 shows the great horror and
[2:21:53] identifies her and her daughters
[2:21:55] revelation
[2:21:56] 18 is the call that says come out of her
[2:21:59] my people
[2:22:02] which again is the seventh angel's
[2:22:04] message
[2:22:05] that happens over in the seventh church
[2:22:08] age
[2:22:11] revelation 19 shows the marriage supper
[2:22:14] of the lamb
[2:22:15] the and the mad the and um
[2:22:19] and and the marriage supper of the lamb
[2:22:22] and the marriage of the lamb
[2:22:24] amen you say well i i thought the bride
[2:22:26] was already married well spiritually
[2:22:28] that's true you can type it both ways
[2:22:31] but there's going to be a ceremony in
[2:22:33] heaven
[2:22:35] hallelujah amen a great marriage supper

[2:23:18] to be at the battle of armageddon i said

[2:23:25] revelation 20 is the binding of satan
[2:23:28] for a thousand years
[2:23:29] and the millennial reign
[2:23:34] revelation the concluding of revelation
[2:23:36] 20 is a great white throne judgment
