[56:31] amen may god bless you can be seated
[56:35] we're going to be speaking this morning
[56:37] about under the oak tree
[56:41] and of course um as we think about even
[56:44] our own environment and
[56:47] the weather here of late
[56:49] ah it's been hot and dry out there
[56:52] we just come through
[56:54] a time of drought and
[56:57] you know high heat and
[56:59] these recent showers have been certainly
[57:01] refreshing
[57:03] we want to thank the lord for that a
[57:05] little break in the weather
[57:07] i read the sign on the church coming
[57:09] down this way last month and said that
[57:12] louisiana is hot but hell is a lot
[57:15] hotter
[57:17] and for the world
[57:19] as for the world she is being prepared
[57:21] for the burning
[57:23] if you notice here that disappearing
[57:26] happened with abraham in the heat of the
[57:29] day
[57:30] and we're here in the heat of the day
[57:33] where we're already seeing signs
[57:36] of the last plague being poured out into
[57:39] the air the fullness of that will be in
[57:42] the tribulations but already
[57:44] the temperature has changed
[57:47] and the atmosphere is charged with evil
[57:50] you can hardly breathe
[57:53] sodom has you know sodom was a hot place
[57:56] the fires of sin was flaming throughout
[57:59] it wasn't getting any better it was
[58:01] getting worse and worse
[58:03] the tensions today and modern sodom and
[58:06] gomorrah are also flaming hot
[58:09] the gospel is all but dried up in our
[58:12] nation and the land is tender dry
[58:15] ready for the burning
[58:17] the fires of plagues are red-hot
[58:21] and riots are in our streets and women
[58:24] are screaming for the rights to kill
[58:26] their babies and these are wicked these
[58:29] are very wicked spirits from hell
[58:32] and there are there are heated debates
[58:34] of
[58:35] of politics and
[58:37] you know raiding the former president's
[58:39] home and a crisis at the border as an
[58:42] invasion takes place and the increase of
[58:46] homelessness the spirit of lawlessness
[58:48] everywhere there's looting and rioting
[58:51] and trashing our cities
[58:54] it is hot as hell out there
[58:56] the russian bear is whipping its cubs
[59:01] and um china is snarling at the world
[59:04] and america is going bankrupt and
[59:07] inflation is rampant with with our life
[59:10] savings just disappearing
[59:13] and here in america even we have 87 000
[59:17] new irs agents that are now being hired
[59:20] to hunt out and sniff down everything
[59:23] that they can to bring about persecution
[59:26] you don't think so brother branham saw
[59:28] it himself he said i i had a vision of a
[59:31] great hideously dark smoky scaly
[59:34] like an alligator man come moving toward
[59:37] me with iron fingers and i had one
[59:40] little knife like that and he had on him
[59:42] united states government
[59:45] and he identified that as the irs that
[59:48] was coming after him to that they had
[59:51] weaponized to try to keep him from going
[59:54] overseas into south africa put
[59:58] limits on his v on his visa and his
[1:00:00] passport and keeping the gospel out of
[1:00:03] foreign nations and you know doing
[1:00:05] everything they could to hamper unjustly
[1:00:08] hamper the gospel of jesus christ
[1:00:12] and and of course they've already
[1:00:14] weaponized the irs and have went after
[1:00:16] the tea party conservatives and this
[1:00:19] army will be used in a greater way in
[1:00:21] the tribulation to force the mark of the
[1:00:24] beast
[1:00:25] so it's hot out there
[1:00:27] we're
[1:00:28] living in a day it's the heat of the day
[1:00:31] it's where
[1:00:32] where the the fires of hell and the
[1:00:35] winds of hell and the smoke from that
[1:00:38] other dimension is permeating the
[1:00:41] society that we're living in
[1:00:44] and things aren't getting better they're
[1:00:45] getting worse
[1:00:47] and i thought of something that brother
[1:00:50] branham a prayer that he prayed in the
[1:00:52] is there anything too hard for the lord
[1:00:54] he said heavenly father your god the
[1:00:56] everlasting god and i'm quoting your
[1:00:59] only your own beloved son's word he said
[1:01:02] as it was down that that day in sodom
[1:01:05] just before the fire fell from heaven
[1:01:07] and destroyed the city so shall it be in
[1:01:10] the coming of the son of man
[1:01:12] now father we we see yonder hanging in
[1:01:14] the hangars automatic uh atomic
[1:01:18] bombs setting out on islands and atomic
[1:01:21] bombs hydrogen bombs at blow a hole in
[1:01:24] the ground 150 feet deep for 100 miles
[1:01:27] square and thousands of those pointed to
[1:01:30] each nation
[1:01:32] submarines warming their way
[1:01:34] around under the water earthquakes in
[1:01:37] diverse places flying saucers in the air
[1:01:40] fearful sights in the heavens above and
[1:01:43] men's hearts failing for fear
[1:01:45] perplex of time and distress among the
[1:01:49] nations and he says oh god then here you
[1:01:52] come moving on the scene with the holy
[1:01:54] spirit pulling into the church bringing
[1:01:58] up the days of sodom and we see the
[1:02:01] sodomite spirit women on the street and
[1:02:03] the churches
[1:02:04] dressing it morally wearing all kinds of
[1:02:07] filthy immoral dress clothes to tempt
[1:02:10] the man on the streets and evil spirits
[1:02:13] on them and don't know it and find women
[1:02:16] sending their souls to hell and we'll
[1:02:18] have to answer at the day of judgment
[1:02:20] for committing adultery does she be pure
[1:02:23] as the lily physically but throwed
[1:02:25] herself before
[1:02:27] men and whosoever looked at them on a
[1:02:28] woman to lust after has committed
[1:02:31] adultery with her already in his heart
[1:02:34] and the woman not knowing that her
[1:02:36] dressing like that and the man looking
[1:02:38] at her she'll have to answer for
[1:02:40] committing adultery before she permitted
[1:02:42] herself to be dressed like that and set
[1:02:45] before men to tempt him god look at the
[1:02:47] nation lord look at the church how it
[1:02:50] swallowed that stuff up just as satan
[1:02:53] just so easy
[1:02:54] and and satan has fed them this little
[1:02:58] this corruption of hell and and many
[1:03:01] thousands have believed it oh come lord
[1:03:04] jesus
[1:03:05] come lord you said if the work wasn't
[1:03:07] cut short there'd be no flesh saved
[1:03:10] truly lord we see that in our self today
[1:03:14] we see the fallen away and the cooling
[1:03:16] off and many may the remnant that
[1:03:19] escapes out of this babylon
[1:03:22] may it rise and shine may you fill it
[1:03:24] with the power of god the holy spirit
[1:03:27] come upon it lord
[1:03:28] perform the great works of god and pull
[1:03:31] that which is ordained to eternal life
[1:03:34] back into the fold again grant it lord
[1:03:37] grant it and hear our prayers
[1:03:40] so it's hot out there
[1:03:42] the atmosphere is ripe for the burning
[1:03:46] down in the sodom world the men of sodom
[1:03:49] would riot to get a chance to molest or
[1:03:52] desecrate
[1:03:54] angels or anything that was sacred or
[1:03:57] holy
[1:03:58] but you see that's the world
[1:04:00] but here abraham was dwelling under a
[1:04:04] tree
[1:04:05] and that tree was a place of refreshing
[1:04:08] amen he was there experiencing the an
[1:04:11] appearing of the angels
[1:04:14] one of which is the lord himself while
[1:04:17] the world is tender box dry
[1:04:20] no revival in the winds
[1:04:22] are winds of strife
[1:04:25] that are making things even hotter
[1:04:28] who would ever thought that jesus would
[1:04:30] come back to the earth in an evil day
[1:04:32] like this
[1:04:33] who would ever thought that he would
[1:04:35] pick a day like this
[1:04:37] to come
[1:04:38] to get a bride
[1:04:40] amen they they have said it can't happen
[1:04:43] when the with the winds of from hell
[1:04:46] this hot but no matter how hot it was
[1:04:49] no matter how evil day
[1:04:52] no matter though it was a day of sodom
[1:04:54] and gomorrah a time where sin
[1:04:57] reached to the heavens god was still
[1:05:00] appearing
[1:05:01] and he was appearing to his elect
[1:05:04] abraham
[1:05:05] and to his seed
[1:05:07] amen and abraham invited them to rest
[1:05:10] themselves under the tree and he
[1:05:12] prepared food for them
[1:05:15] the bible said he stood by the under the
[1:05:17] by them under the tree and they did eat
[1:05:21] he welcomed them to come and sit down
[1:05:24] under my tree
[1:05:26] and and let me entertain you just for a
[1:05:28] little while
[1:05:29] let me make you feel welcome let me wash
[1:05:32] your feet let me prepare a meal for you
[1:05:36] let's have some communion together
[1:05:38] amen oh it's hot outside but here's a
[1:05:41] place of refreshing
[1:05:43] there's a place that you can come that
[1:05:45] the lord is welcome
[1:05:47] in an age where he's the unwelcome
[1:05:49] christ
[1:05:50] among churches where he's the unwanted
[1:05:53] christ there is a place where the
[1:05:55] abrahams the elect seed they mended out
[1:05:59] that are dwelling under an oak that are
[1:06:01] inviting his presence that are seeing
[1:06:04] him appear that are entertaining angels
[1:06:07] that are having a visitation that the
[1:06:10] spirit of the lord is moving among them
[1:06:13] and the winds of the holy spirit is
[1:06:15] blowing through their tree and their
[1:06:18] shade there is providing a welcome place
[1:06:21] and an atmosphere for angels to come
[1:06:26] hallelujah
[1:06:28] it's so important
[1:06:30] that there is a place of refreshing
[1:06:33] where the spirit of god is welcome
[1:06:36] a place where angels can appear and be
[1:06:40] entertained
[1:06:42] and i thought of it last week as i
[1:06:44] preached on uh a prophetic class of
[1:06:48] people and how the holy spirit is the
[1:06:50] prophet that is here among us and
[1:06:53] there's a prophetic class of people that
[1:06:55] he's appearing to
[1:06:57] and to show that we're a prophetic class
[1:07:00] of people the book of joel said in the
[1:07:03] restoration old men would would drink
[1:07:06] dreams and young men would see visions
[1:07:08] and i will pour out my spirit upon this
[1:07:11] prophetic class
[1:07:13] and i'll open their eyes to what's going
[1:07:16] on and let them see clearly their day
[1:07:19] and their hour so they can recognize it
[1:07:21] and walk in it
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:25] it's so important
[1:07:27] to be a place or to have a place
[1:07:31] and for the church to be a place of
[1:07:34] refreshing
[1:07:35] where the spirit of god is wanted
[1:07:38] and welcomed
[1:07:39] and
[1:07:40] entertained and he visits
[1:07:44] a place where angels can appear
[1:07:47] be careful to entertain angels the bible
[1:07:51] said
[1:07:52] amen it's so important today that we are
[1:07:55] here not to be entertained
[1:07:58] but to welcome him and entertain him
[1:08:02] now you know brother branham actually
[1:08:04] lacking some ministers to oak trees
[1:08:07] they have been through the storms they
[1:08:10] have defeated and cast out devils
[1:08:12] they are contenders for the faith that
[1:08:14] was once delivered to the saints
[1:08:17] i wouldn't want to sit under a pastor
[1:08:18] that didn't have a walk with god
[1:08:21] that knew nothing but psychology and
[1:08:24] don't know how to cast the devil out
[1:08:27] amen you know there's many places that
[1:08:30] haven't seen a move of god for years and
[1:08:32] years
[1:08:33] where the ministry is dried up on a vine
[1:08:37] where it's a dry place
[1:08:39] where the spirit of god maybe once was
[1:08:42] there but is no longer there
[1:08:45] it is a sad place i wouldn't want to sit
[1:08:47] under that kind of a ministry that don't
[1:08:50] know how to cast satan out
[1:08:52] he said uh he pointed brother osborne to
[1:08:55] brother bosworth and said brother
[1:08:57] bosworth he said there there's an old
[1:09:00] oak tree sitting over there on my porch
[1:09:02] i was referring to brother bosworth i
[1:09:04] said who knows about divine healing
[1:09:06] crawl up under that tree and talk to him
[1:09:10] a little life
[1:09:12] so you see that's that's the way it is
[1:09:14] some ministers are oak trees
[1:09:17] they have been through the storms now
[1:09:20] some ministry they may have been through
[1:09:22] the storm and they're old but they're
[1:09:24] just on snags
[1:09:27] the life of god had moved there and used
[1:09:29] them for years and years and years and
[1:09:32] there's no fruit to their ministry
[1:09:35] but i'll just say this about our church
[1:09:38] that evening like tabernacle be one of
[1:09:41] those oak trees
[1:09:43] amount of oak trees with restored
[1:09:45] branches
[1:09:46] not stripped and wormied in the dead
[1:09:50] not withered leaves and bearing limbs
[1:09:52] that can't give shave
[1:09:55] why why should a church be like an old
[1:09:57] burn over forest
[1:09:59] that groaned in the wind when the winds
[1:10:01] of heaven blew
[1:10:02] and it can't wave its branches and
[1:10:05] glorify god
[1:10:07] in restoration of the bride tree brother
[1:10:09] adam said that god was speaking here of
[1:10:12] his fruit tree and joy
[1:10:15] that we have read and he said god
[1:10:16] planted a fruit tree
[1:10:18] he planted it on the day of pentecost
[1:10:21] and he brought forth a tree there for a
[1:10:23] purpose
[1:10:24] he wanted it to bear his fruit word
[1:10:28] god's word he wanted a church that would
[1:10:31] keep his word
[1:10:32] all down to the age eve failed to keep
[1:10:35] it and the jews had failed to keep it
[1:10:37] and the law had failed and all it failed
[1:10:39] so god planted himself a
[1:10:42] tree and he said i'm so glad i believe
[1:10:45] that god planted a holy o seed on the
[1:10:48] day of pentecost that hybrid it into
[1:10:51] denomination but after a while it got
[1:10:53] back to its original again back to the
[1:10:56] real holy ghost back to the gospel
[1:10:58] message back to acts 2 again back to the
[1:11:00] formula back to where it began at
[1:11:04] because this is his promise i will
[1:11:06] restore
[1:11:07] remember this
[1:11:08] god expects fruit
[1:11:12] he expects fruit out of out of your life
[1:11:16] out of this church
[1:11:18] out of this ministry or any ministry god
[1:11:21] expects fruit
[1:11:23] and when he found no fruit jesus cursed
[1:11:26] a fig tree
[1:11:27] because he had no fruit
[1:11:30] another parable was of a fig tree that
[1:11:32] wasn't barren and the owner of the field
[1:11:35] said cut it down
[1:11:36] and and and
[1:11:38] you remember the
[1:11:40] the caretaker said but just let me dunk
[1:11:43] it and you know dig around it and dunk
[1:11:46] it and fertilize it there and and see if
[1:11:49] it'll bring forth fruit and if it won't
[1:11:51] cut it
[1:11:52] down and that's exactly what god's done
[1:11:55] in this day he's taken and he's he has
[1:11:58] he has fertilized this bright tree he's
[1:12:02] fertilized the trees of the garden he's
[1:12:05] fertilizing your tree
[1:12:07] and if you won't bear his fruit you'll
[1:12:09] be cut down
[1:12:11] that's all there is to it
[1:12:12] you'll be left behind
[1:12:15] you're burned up in the sodom burnin
[1:12:18] now this gift this tree rider that god
[1:12:21] planted
[1:12:22] it was to bear nine different kinds of
[1:12:25] fruit think of that
[1:12:27] nine different kind which means nine
[1:12:30] different gifts
[1:12:31] nine fruits of the spirit to go with
[1:12:34] those nine spiritual gifts
[1:12:36] that was god's spiritual tree
[1:12:39] he planted it on the day of pentecost
[1:12:42] now notice now what taken place god
[1:12:45] planted a tree to bring forth spiritual
[1:12:48] gifts
[1:12:49] gifts of a spirit
[1:12:51] the same spirit that was in christ came
[1:12:55] down upon his church
[1:12:57] and it was growing and bearing forth
[1:13:00] fruit everywhere they didn't think of
[1:13:02] themselves they didn't organize anything
[1:13:05] they just went ahead and they were
[1:13:07] brothers
[1:13:09] and god planted this tree remember to
[1:13:12] bear spiritual fruit
[1:13:15] fruits of his spirit is that right amen
[1:13:18] but what did man do man has tried to
[1:13:20] take the spiritual church and make it
[1:13:23] into an artificial form
[1:13:25] so you see luther had a spiritual church
[1:13:28] but happened what happened as soon as
[1:13:30] luther died they made it into a form an
[1:13:33] artificial same thing with wesley same
[1:13:36] thing with the pentecostal move same
[1:13:38] thing that is happening with many
[1:13:40] churches and and moves across the
[1:13:42] message
[1:13:43] they they make an an artificial put on
[1:13:47] good works
[1:13:48] you know all maybe sometimes great
[1:13:51] congregations or smart people or
[1:13:54] celebrity of the city or it looks good
[1:13:56] on the outside but it never bears any of
[1:14:00] the christ-like fruits
[1:14:03] brother branham told us there in the
[1:14:04] second seal he said what did the nickel
[1:14:07] age nicoletan age ask for it asked to
[1:14:11] get away from them bunch of people that
[1:14:13] shouts and claps their hand
[1:14:17] let the services be a dead dump
[1:14:21] just let it be you know the people just
[1:14:23] sit and try their best to absorb it
[1:14:26] don't don't let there be a move of the
[1:14:28] spirit
[1:14:29] don't let there be the hallelujahs and
[1:14:31] the amens and people entering in and
[1:14:34] people rejoicing and making him welcome
[1:14:36] don't you know when you say amen to the
[1:14:38] word you are making him welcome
[1:14:41] don't you know when you raise your hands
[1:14:43] almighty god you are making him welcome
[1:14:47] don't you know that when you sing our
[1:14:49] praises from your heart you are making
[1:14:52] him welcome
[1:14:54] god wants a people that makes him
[1:14:56] welcome that welcomes his holy spirit
[1:15:00] that's invites them come move on me
[1:15:03] come shake my branches
[1:15:05] come cause me lord to wave in your
[1:15:08] presence i'm meant to worship you with
[1:15:11] all of my heart
[1:15:13] you see
[1:15:14] you see they ask to get away from that
[1:15:16] bunch of people that shouts
[1:15:18] and claps your hands and looks
[1:15:20] disgracefully like they did on the day
[1:15:22] of pentecost act like drunk men
[1:15:24] staggered in the spirit and thing they
[1:15:26] didn't want none of that stuff
[1:15:28] you see they said they were drunk and
[1:15:30] when the celebrity don't miss this might
[1:15:32] sound crazy to you but it's the truth
[1:15:34] when the dignitaries began to come in
[1:15:36] they couldn't stoop to that
[1:15:38] i wonder how many times we have tried to
[1:15:41] dignify the message
[1:15:43] to where we we don't want none of them
[1:15:45] shouting tongues speaking acts 2 38
[1:15:48] youngins
[1:15:49] we try to dignify it you know where
[1:15:51] where we we got to wear a certain kind
[1:15:54] of clothes and dress up a certain way
[1:15:56] and make that make those who who are not
[1:15:59] as wealthy as the others feel inferior
[1:16:03] you know again we we we do all kinds of
[1:16:06] things that is happen even within the
[1:16:08] framework of the message as it becomes
[1:16:11] denominational minded it becomes a
[1:16:14] little group of us for and no more
[1:16:18] so they become closed
[1:16:22] shut in
[1:16:24] afraid to let the gospel out
[1:16:28] that's why they're preaching against the
[1:16:30] internet
[1:16:32] is because they don't want the gospel to
[1:16:34] go into all the world
[1:16:36] they don't realize it's a way of
[1:16:38] breaking barriers
[1:16:41] they don't realize it's a way that it
[1:16:43] can go beyond the the bamboo curtain and
[1:16:48] get into areas there that couldn't come
[1:16:50] into a service like this but they can
[1:16:53] they can see it right there in their
[1:16:55] home
[1:16:56] and you can be an oak tree
[1:16:59] where that another believer over in
[1:17:01] china can get a refreshing from the
[1:17:04] presence of god where it's over in japan
[1:17:08] they can be ministered to whether it's
[1:17:10] down in africa they can be ministered to
[1:17:13] down in kuwait and muslim countries and
[1:17:16] down into egypt and down even into
[1:17:18] israel all around across the world that
[1:17:21] they can do it fulfilling the scripture
[1:17:25] that the gospel is to go into all
[1:17:27] nations
[1:17:28] [Applause]
[1:17:30] amen y'all tell you what you say i'm
[1:17:32] against the internet brother tim i tell
[1:17:34] you bring me a quote against it
[1:17:39] you don't have one
[1:17:41] then you got to shut up about it
[1:17:46] we don't want the gospel out there the
[1:17:48] gospel's got to go
[1:17:50] it's got to go to all the world so the
[1:17:52] end can come
[1:17:54] you see but they
[1:17:55] but again what happens when men become
[1:17:58] closed up
[1:17:59] they become sticky in a cactus
[1:18:02] and everything's just poking everybody
[1:18:04] else
[1:18:06] because of the heat of the day they are
[1:18:08] affected by it
[1:18:09] and become little bitty clustered groups
[1:18:12] i'll tell you what if you're that little
[1:18:14] bitty clustered group you got
[1:18:16] responsibility by yourself to preach the
[1:18:19] gospel to the whole world
[1:18:22] you got a huge job on your hand
[1:18:25] brother we're not we're not alone in
[1:18:27] this god's got to bride around the world
[1:18:30] amen and it's going out to all the world
[1:18:33] it's not us foreign no more it's not
[1:18:35] about us and a little kingdom building
[1:18:38] bringing a dried up branch somewhere
[1:18:41] now listen if the appearance of elohim
[1:18:43] comes when the world is hot and in a dry
[1:18:46] condition with blistering heat god's
[1:18:49] going to need a tree
[1:18:53] amen somewhere that will welcome him
[1:18:58] somebody that will
[1:19:00] make him welcome when he comes
[1:19:02] are you with me
[1:19:04] and the bible said and he stood by them
[1:19:06] under the tree and they did eat
[1:19:10] you see
[1:19:12] there's a lot about trees in the bible
[1:19:15] churches are trees
[1:19:18] the bride is a tree
[1:19:20] the groom is a tree
[1:19:22] and my righteous people are trees
[1:19:25] are you with me
[1:19:27] man god is like a tree for he's a tree
[1:19:29] of life
[1:19:31] man is like a tree
[1:19:33] but let me tell you what these trees do
[1:19:35] verse chronicles 16 33 then shall the
[1:19:38] trees of the woods sing out
[1:19:41] in the presence of the lord
[1:19:44] amen so this is what the trees do they
[1:19:46] sing out in his presence
[1:19:49] they worship in his presence
[1:19:51] psalms 196 12 let the field be joyful
[1:19:56] and all that is therein then shall all
[1:19:59] of the trees of the wood rejoice
[1:20:03] before the lord for he cometh
[1:20:06] for he cometh to judge the earth and he
[1:20:08] shall judge the earth with righteousness
[1:20:10] and his people with truth how many
[1:20:12] believes he's brought his truth
[1:20:14] how many believe it's a righteous truth
[1:20:17] amen so he has come bringing truth and
[1:20:20] when he does the trees sing out in the
[1:20:23] presence of the lord
[1:20:26] hallelujah will you see
[1:20:28] the word doesn't come without worship
[1:20:32] when the word comes what happens the
[1:20:34] trees sing
[1:20:36] [Applause]
[1:20:38] now
[1:20:40] the groom is likened to the tree let's
[1:20:42] go to some song of solomon chapter 2 and
[1:20:45] verse 3 as the apple trees among the
[1:20:48] trees of the wood
[1:20:50] so is my beloved among the suns
[1:20:53] i sat down on his shadow with great
[1:20:56] delight and his fruit was sweet to my
[1:20:59] taste
[1:21:01] think of that
[1:21:02] here it is the apple tree
[1:21:05] my beloved is like an apple tree
[1:21:08] i sat
[1:21:10] down under his shadow
[1:21:12] with great delight
[1:21:14] and his fruit was sweet to my taste
[1:21:18] so the bridegroom is also a tree
[1:21:23] a fruit tree
[1:21:25] amen
[1:21:26] given fruit to re refresh the bride
[1:21:30] now turn around over to the song of
[1:21:32] solomon chapter 4 and verse 12 and we'll
[1:21:35] see where the bride is likened to a tree
[1:21:39] in fact he said
[1:21:41] that a garden
[1:21:43] enclosed is my sister
[1:21:46] it's not just one tree
[1:21:48] he was one tree
[1:21:50] is that right
[1:21:52] amen he was the original tree but you

[1:22:10] of you is a fruit tree

[1:30:11] come on now
[1:30:12] amen a church is made up of individuals
[1:30:16] everyone's a cell in the body
[1:30:19] everyone makes a contribution
[1:30:22] we work together when we come to church
[1:30:25] it ain't just a song leader leading the
[1:30:27] songs
[1:30:28] or just the prayer of the man leading
[1:30:31] the prayer leading the prayers no it's
[1:30:33] you praying it's you singing it's you

[1:31:14] you see i also want you to see
[1:31:17] when the word returns
[1:31:20] and the doctrine falls
[1:31:22] it is the rain given seed to the sower
[1:31:26] and bread to the eater
[1:31:28] and it brings revival as the mountains
[1:31:31] and the hills break forth into singing
[1:31:33] and the trees clap their hands read with
[1:31:35] me
[1:31:36] in isaiah 55 and verse 10
[1:31:39] isaiah 55 and verse 10.
[1:31:44] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:31:48] from heaven
[1:31:49] and returneth not thither but water the
[1:31:52] earth
[1:31:52] and maketh it bring forth in blood that
[1:31:55] it may give seed to the sower and bread
[1:31:58] to the eater
[1:32:00] so shall my word be
[1:32:03] that goeth forth out of my mouth what's
[1:32:05] now words going forth out of my mouth
[1:32:08] prophets prophesying seeing vision
[1:32:11] dreaming dreams the word is spoken amen
[1:32:15] it's it's professed it's proclaimed it's
[1:32:18] confessed are you with me it shall not
[1:32:21] return and to be void but it shall
[1:32:23] accomplish what i please it's a
[1:32:25] prospering the thing that i sent it to
[1:32:29] and
[1:32:30] for ye shall go out with joy
[1:32:33] and be led forth with peace
[1:32:36] and the mountains and the hills shall
[1:32:37] break forth unto you unto singing and
[1:32:40] all the trees of the field shall clap
[1:32:43] their hands
[1:32:45] are you hearing me
[1:32:47] when the word comes
[1:32:50] what happened to trees in the field clap
[1:32:52] your hand and the mountains and the
[1:32:54] hills break forth under singing
[1:32:58] and instead of the throne oh my
[1:33:02] oh my instead of the thorn
[1:33:05] instead of scoffing
[1:33:07] instead of sitting there like a bump on
[1:33:09] a log
[1:33:10] instead of sitting there as a sour
[1:33:13] pickle
[1:33:14] somebody help me preach instead of a
[1:33:16] thorn that should come up a fir tree a
[1:33:19] useful tree and instead of the briar
[1:33:22] that shall come up the merle tree and it
[1:33:24] shall be for the lord for a name for an
[1:33:27] everlasting sign that shall not be cut
[1:33:30] off
[1:33:32] amen
[1:33:34] in this day of intense heat
[1:33:37] we're completing the scripture that
[1:33:39] jesus opened and said this day this
[1:33:42] scripture is fulfilled
[1:33:43] because it applies to the bride coming
[1:33:45] of christ everybody should know where
[1:33:47] i'm going to isaiah 61 and verse 1
[1:33:51] and again
[1:33:54] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:33:57] because the lord hath anointed me oh
[1:34:00] what a sweet anointing
[1:34:02] amen to preach good tidings to the meek
[1:34:06] he has sent me to bind up the
[1:34:08] brokenhearted
[1:34:10] to proclaim liberty to the captives
[1:34:13] to the opening of the prison to them
[1:34:14] that are bound
[1:34:16] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:34:18] lord and the day of vengeance of our god
[1:34:21] and to comfort all that mourn
[1:34:24] to point to them that mourn in zion
[1:34:28] those that are signed and crying
[1:34:30] it's hot out there in sodom
[1:34:33] amen all the sin that it's being done in
[1:34:35] the city
[1:34:37] amen to point to them that's that mourns
[1:34:39] signing crying in zion to give to them
[1:34:43] beauty for
[1:34:44] isis the oil of joy for mourning
[1:34:49] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[1:34:51] heaviness
[1:34:53] that they may be called the trees of
[1:34:55] righteousness
[1:34:57] the planting of the lord that he might
[1:35:00] be glorified
[1:35:03] hallelujah
[1:35:05] hallelujah
[1:35:06] amen that they might be called the trees
[1:35:09] of righteousness
[1:35:11] the planting of the lord we're going to
[1:35:14] we're going to emphasize on that in a
[1:35:16] little bit
[1:35:17] the planting of the lord
[1:35:19] now abraham
[1:35:21] fed him under the tree
[1:35:24] now why should a church
[1:35:26] be like an old burnover forest
[1:35:30] that groans in the wind when the winds
[1:35:33] of the spirit blows
[1:35:35] and it can't waves its branches and
[1:35:38] glorify god
[1:35:41] now david saw this tree a long time ago
[1:35:44] and in his writing of his psalms
[1:35:47] he
[1:35:48] you know expressing his joy
[1:35:51] he he saw this tree
[1:35:53] and he said it's planted by the rivers
[1:35:56] of water
[1:35:57] will you turn with me to psalms 1-1 and
[1:35:59] let's read this together
[1:36:01] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:36:04] the counsel of the ungodly
[1:36:06] he not with locke's group down in sodom
[1:36:10] nor does he stand in the way of sinners
[1:36:12] nor does he sit in the seat of this
[1:36:15] carnful come on
[1:36:17] but his delight is in the law that we're
[1:36:19] the lord and in his law in his word that
[1:36:22] he meditate day and night
[1:36:27] and he shall be what
[1:36:30] like a tree
[1:36:32] planted
[1:36:34] by the rivers of water
[1:36:36] that bringeth voice what his fruit
[1:36:39] in his season his leave also shall not
[1:36:42] wither and whatsoever he do it shall
[1:36:45] prosper
[1:36:48] hallelujah
[1:36:49] amen now here's what david said of a man
[1:36:53] and he said he's planted
[1:36:56] by the rivers of water
[1:36:58] he bringeth forth his fruit and a season
[1:37:01] he was not just seeing a man he would
[1:37:03] see in a church
[1:37:06] amen the water represents the spirit and
[1:37:10] it's singular notice there he shall be
[1:37:13] like it's replanted by the rivers of
[1:37:15] water one water one holy spirit
[1:37:19] no not waters a methodist or baptist or
[1:37:22] lutheran or perusian or seven thunder or
[1:37:24] two soul a
[1:37:25] none of these denominations
[1:37:28] are you with me but one spirit
[1:37:32] one spirit
[1:37:34] just rivers of one water
[1:37:38] nine spiritual gifts
[1:37:40] by the same spirit
[1:37:43] notice that rivers of one water
[1:37:47] so this water comes out around this tree
[1:37:52] with nine different spiritual gifts
[1:37:54] flowing around it to keep it fruitful
[1:38:00] because god wants fruit-bearing church
[1:38:03] god wants you to be fruit-bearing
[1:38:06] he should be like a tree planted by the
[1:38:08] rivers of water and a man that's planted
[1:38:10] by the rivers of water notice one water
[1:38:14] one spirit but they're around it and
[1:38:17] that spirit breaks out into different
[1:38:19] streams of of mercy of healing
[1:38:24] another stream of mercy by the same
[1:38:26] spirit prophecy another by the same
[1:38:29] spirit tongues
[1:38:31] interpretation
[1:38:33] discernment of spirits word of knowledge
[1:38:36] faith working on miracles one giver or
[1:38:39] one spirit but nine spiritual gifts
[1:38:44] amen if you don't believe it go listen
[1:38:46] to the restoration of the bride tree
[1:38:48] that's exactly the way brother branham
[1:38:50] placed it amen
[1:38:52] he said this tree would be planted am i
[1:38:56] not just stuck out but then planted not
[1:39:00] an accidental growth but a predestinated
[1:39:03] place
[1:39:05] i'm placing the tree in the spirit
[1:39:08] and there's gonna be nine streams of
[1:39:10] that spirit and there'll be nine
[1:39:13] spiritual gifts
[1:39:14] and it will flow around that tree so
[1:39:17] it'll bring forth its fruit and it's
[1:39:19] seasons
[1:39:21] notice this water
[1:39:23] this tree with a spirit nine streams of
[1:39:25] grace
[1:39:26] poured out his gifts gives the tree its
[1:39:29] vitality
[1:39:30] makes it a fruitful tree
[1:39:33] so what right has any man to withhold or
[1:39:36] block the streams of the holy ghost
[1:39:40] a tree without water will not produce
[1:39:42] fruit
[1:39:43] and it will have withered leaves
[1:39:47] and how can a tree with withered leaves
[1:39:50] produce the fruits of the spirit
[1:39:52] or how can it provide shade for the
[1:39:56] almighty to come and rest under
[1:39:59] can you imagine the almighty coming down
[1:40:02] and the oak tree all the leaves are
[1:40:04] withered
[1:40:06] and the heat's coming through
[1:40:09] it's not keeping away the atmospheres of
[1:40:12] evil
[1:40:14] come on somebody
[1:40:16] amen it's hot
[1:40:18] and how are we going to bear fruit
[1:40:19] without the water of the spirit with his
[1:40:21] streams of nine spiritual gifts
[1:40:25] the fruit becomes withered and naughty
[1:40:28] and worm eden
[1:40:30] and the church becomes worldly and the
[1:40:33] members relax in their spiritual life
[1:40:36] and the first thing you know instead of
[1:40:37] being a big shady tree it becomes a snag
[1:40:42] it becomes a place where buzzards roost
[1:40:46] it becomes the haunt of every unclean
[1:40:48] and hateful bird
[1:40:51] that's right you ever see you ever drive
[1:40:54] by where do you see the buzzards on an
[1:40:56] old snag
[1:40:58] big old tree up there with with limbs no
[1:41:01] leaves on it
[1:41:03] no refreshing there
[1:41:05] and the buzzard's sitting right out
[1:41:06] there all camped
[1:41:08] that's where buzzards roost
[1:41:11] amen buzzards are roofs where churches
[1:41:13] have dried up
[1:41:15] no longer fruitful don't have any leaves
[1:41:18] on it
[1:41:19] there's no worship the sap line has been
[1:41:22] cut off
[1:41:23] the lifeline is gone
[1:41:26] are you with me
[1:41:28] amen an unclean spirit's
[1:41:30] right to sit right under that tree
[1:41:33] adulteries
[1:41:34] married three and four times and
[1:41:36] rebellious young people and pregnant
[1:41:39] teens and fighting moms and dad and
[1:41:42] fault-finding
[1:41:45] high-tempered
[1:41:46] you try to get them to worship and they
[1:41:48] stop out of the building
[1:41:51] you know they cast their fruit
[1:41:53] love isn't there
[1:41:55] joy is gone
[1:41:56] peace is replaced with unrest
[1:42:00] and the unbeliever looks at that and
[1:42:02] said well there's no difference
[1:42:05] between that person and me
[1:42:08] and and the children say if that's what
[1:42:11] religion does for mom and dad i don't
[1:42:13] want no part of it
[1:42:17] are you with me
[1:42:19] amen because you see what happens they
[1:42:22] they become just a snag and a haunt for
[1:42:25] every kind of evil spirit that's not the
[1:42:27] bride of christ that's not the way we
[1:42:29] should be
[1:42:30] amen
[1:42:32] come on church
[1:42:33] we need to be a fruitful branch
[1:42:36] amen amen a shade tree
[1:42:39] full of leaves
[1:42:41] happiness joy peace
[1:42:44] i mean your homes need to be a kind of
[1:42:46] place where children can come in
[1:42:49] out of sodom there in the sodom heed and
[1:42:52] sit down there and refresh
[1:42:56] it's hot out there
[1:42:58] homer thank god for my home
[1:43:01] thank god for praying mom and dad
[1:43:03] thank god a father can come home after a
[1:43:06] day's work and sit down under a shade
[1:43:08] tree
[1:43:11] oh thank you lord for the good wife
[1:43:13] for loving mother for uh for doting wife
[1:43:17] i remember caring for a caring shade
[1:43:20] tree i can sit here in this home and
[1:43:22] it's welcoming your holy spirit is
[1:43:24] welcome when we say the grace around the
[1:43:27] table is not just to form but we feel
[1:43:29] your spirit come down we're just moved
[1:43:32] by the holy ghost
[1:43:41] what happens
[1:43:43] churches become a snag
[1:43:47] they become
[1:43:49] just an old snag the leaves is gone
[1:43:52] the bark's been gone a long time
[1:43:56] it's worm eaten
[1:43:58] the ball the branches are falling all
[1:44:00] around
[1:44:01] the cast of fruit
[1:44:03] love isn't there
[1:44:05] joy is gone
[1:44:07] peace is replaced with unrest
[1:44:11] and the unbelievers say there's no
[1:44:13] difference
[1:44:16] well you know what does the world when
[1:44:18] they do when they do their polls out
[1:44:21] there about about christian what have
[1:44:23] they discovered that there's no
[1:44:24] difference
[1:44:26] between the church and the unchurched
[1:44:34] and then a lot of times you have your
[1:44:36] kids raised in that environment
[1:44:40] because why you you know as a cactus
[1:44:44] you just don't
[1:44:45] do well
[1:44:48] under a you know in a garden that's lost
[1:44:51] and green and growing and moisture and
[1:44:55] winds of the spirit and refreshing no
[1:44:58] cactus likes it out there where it's dry
[1:45:02] do you ever try to get shade under a
[1:45:04] cacti
[1:45:08] did you ever go and try to rest under
[1:45:10] its lofty lofty branches it may have
[1:45:13] branches out there but you ever try to
[1:45:15] get up under it and rest and get shade
[1:45:18] under cactus
[1:45:20] you don't work
[1:45:22] many of them are jumping cactus
[1:45:25] and man they're they're going to be
[1:45:27] jumping all over you and sticky here and
[1:45:29] sticky there and sticky there fight
[1:45:31] vault finding here and find it there and
[1:45:34] you know well i i don't like it here oh
[1:45:36] no and first thing you know you the
[1:45:38] cactus is removed from the garden
[1:45:42] well there is a different way that you
[1:45:44] don't have to be removed from the garden
[1:45:47] because the devil will move you right
[1:45:48] out of this church if you can
[1:45:52] but i tell you you don't have to remain
[1:45:54] a cactus
[1:45:56] you can be changed in his presence
[1:45:58] brother branham said a cactus is what
[1:46:00] the you know this is it's it's leaf is
[1:46:03] just so so twisted up it becomes a thorn
[1:46:07] and people there they get that way when
[1:46:09] they get
[1:46:10] dry
[1:46:12] and then they get fault findings
[1:46:15] well the preacher preaches too long and
[1:46:17] this ain't to my case and they do this
[1:46:19] there and i don't like there and first
[1:46:21] thing you know you don't fit nowhere
[1:46:24] but an old desert somewhere
[1:46:28] where it's hot
[1:46:34] now
[1:46:37] brother branham preached many times on
[1:46:39] the subject i will restore
[1:46:43] many times
[1:46:46] and just before the church ages in the
[1:46:48] seals
[1:46:50] he preaches
[1:46:51] on the palm arm locust cankerworm
[1:46:53] caterpillar in his home church
[1:46:56] a month later
[1:46:57] he will preach on planting the vine and
[1:46:59] where to plant it
[1:47:02] and i'd like you to turn with me to
[1:47:04] psalms 80 and verse 8 because this is
[1:47:06] where that he took his sermon
[1:47:10] sermon um from
[1:47:13] his context from when he preached on
[1:47:15] planting the vine and word of planet
[1:47:17] thou has brought a vine out of egypt
[1:47:21] thou has cast out the heathen and
[1:47:23] planted it
[1:47:25] thou has prepared room before it and it
[1:47:28] caused it to take deep root and it
[1:47:31] filled the land
[1:47:34] you see israel was a vine that could
[1:47:37] never be fruitful until it was brought
[1:47:40] back into his promised land
[1:47:43] of inheritance
[1:47:45] until then it just produced the naughty
[1:47:48] bitter fruit of slavery
[1:47:52] are you with me
[1:47:53] amen they were a good vibe
[1:47:56] they were god's chosen
[1:47:58] amen but the good vine if it isn't set
[1:48:00] in good ground it'll not bring forth
[1:48:02] good fruit
[1:48:04] and i'm just going to say this god may
[1:48:07] have started you out in good ground
[1:48:11] but something removed you to egypt
[1:48:14] are you with me
[1:48:16] but god is bringing the people out of
[1:48:19] egypt and planting them in the right
[1:48:22] ground
[1:48:24] amen they were a good vine they were
[1:48:26] god's chosen but a good vine that isn't
[1:48:29] set on good ground it'll not bring forth
[1:48:31] its fruits it depends on where the vine
[1:48:34] is planted will determine the results of
[1:48:36] the crop
[1:48:37] so god picks israel up out of a barren
[1:48:40] land
[1:48:41] and he plants them into a land of
[1:48:43] promise what was he doing he was
[1:48:45] preparing them all of that was preparing
[1:48:49] for the appearing of the messiah
[1:48:52] where the word would become flesh
[1:48:55] and why has he brought us to this land
[1:49:01] so we could grow up to be a tree
[1:49:04] where the spirit of god was welcomed
[1:49:10] amen now you're gonna have to make up
[1:49:12] for those that ain't here yes sir
[1:49:15] i can't hear them say amen hallelujah
[1:49:17] second brother
[1:49:19] so you're gonna have to make up for him
[1:49:22] amen
[1:49:23] amen brother tim
[1:49:25] hallelujah brother tim do it brother tim
[1:49:28] seek him to brother tim
[1:49:31] you got a job to do
[1:49:33] you're not a spectator
[1:49:36] that's not why you're here you're not
[1:49:38] respecting
[1:49:39] you are here to participate
[1:49:43] all the way from the front room to the
[1:49:44] back of the vaseline mean you are to
[1:49:46] participate in worship
[1:49:51] now so again he planted them in a
[1:49:54] promise the land of promise prepared him
[1:49:57] to avoid the messiah and why has he
[1:50:00] brought us to this land
[1:50:03] so that we could grow up to be a tree
[1:50:07] where the spirit of god would be
[1:50:09] welcomed
[1:50:12] hallelujah
[1:50:13] amen where he could appear and be
[1:50:16] repressed and welcome and fed and
[1:50:19] commune there
[1:50:22] and god called you to be a leaf on that
[1:50:24] tree
[1:50:27] come on now don't fall of it let the
[1:50:30] wind blow you away
[1:50:32] hang on to the tree it's your life
[1:50:35] stay in the lifeline don't let your tree
[1:50:39] let your your leaf just wither away and
[1:50:41] you just flop off and and blow any old
[1:50:44] kind of direction amen
[1:50:47] some people have been that way for years
[1:50:49] and years and years they can never find
[1:50:51] their place
[1:50:54] but god wants a people who knows their
[1:50:56] god who does exploit who knows their
[1:50:59] place and their position
[1:51:05] some of you have been out for 20 years
[1:51:07] and you're back again why is it god
[1:51:09] wouldn't let you stay out there
[1:51:11] he wants you united to the tree
[1:51:14] amen because under that tree is
[1:51:16] appearing and where the appearing takes
[1:51:19] place the body change takes place
[1:51:21] the rapture will take place
[1:51:24] the promised sun will come
[1:51:26] so get under the tree
[1:51:30] be apart
[1:51:35] so now
[1:51:38] the church
[1:51:39] was the same way
[1:51:41] you know that
[1:51:42] we could never prosper
[1:51:45] it would
[1:51:46] remain dwarfed and stumbled planted in
[1:51:49] the soured soils of egypt
[1:51:53] where the days of miracles are passed
[1:51:57] listen what i'm saying
[1:51:58] every one of you
[1:52:00] some of you were catholic
[1:52:03] you never brought forth fruit there
[1:52:05] some of you were methodists some of you
[1:52:07] were pentecostal
[1:52:09] some of you were this some of you were
[1:52:11] nothing
[1:52:12] but your ground where you were in was
[1:52:14] soured
[1:52:17] you were a good seed you were
[1:52:19] predestinated
[1:52:21] you were called to this message
[1:52:24] amen but god said i'm going to take a
[1:52:27] tree
[1:52:28] out of egypt and i'm going to plant them
[1:52:31] in a good land
[1:52:35] hallelujah otherwise you remain dwarfed
[1:52:40] it says like david said in the psalms
[1:52:43] blessed is the man that won't join up
[1:52:45] with these scoffers and ungodly people
[1:52:49] you know you know
[1:52:50] that won't connect with them that won't
[1:52:52] see
[1:52:53] sit in the seat with them can you
[1:52:55] imagine can you imagine we we have a
[1:52:58] church and we have a body of believers
[1:53:01] here and you fail to just you know you
[1:53:04] become a in the seed of this cornfield
[1:53:07] instead of the seed of rejoicing
[1:53:10] you know brother brad i'm in the message
[1:53:12] how can i overcome
[1:53:14] he said there was an old log
[1:53:17] he said here's where i got my sermon
[1:53:19] from
[1:53:20] there was an old log it was a beach log
[1:53:23] and he said it had fallen and fallen
[1:53:25] right into the stream where the life was
[1:53:29] and he said there in that stream it
[1:53:32] rotted twice as quick
[1:53:36] and he said i stepped on it and a big
[1:53:38] chunk of it fell off and he said that's
[1:53:40] what's happening to many christians
[1:53:42] they're right in the stream where the
[1:53:45] life is going forth but they're
[1:53:47] rottening twice as quick
[1:53:52] you're not overcoming
[1:53:57] are you with me
[1:53:59] amen god brings you to to sit on the log
[1:54:02] but it's to be a living law
[1:54:04] and brother branham said i'll sit right
[1:54:06] here on this stuff
[1:54:08] and i'll proclaim i shall restore saith
[1:54:11] the lord
[1:54:14] so you may be sitting on a log but
[1:54:16] you've got to realize this is what god
[1:54:19] does he wants you to be restored not
[1:54:22] become dead and become rotten and fall
[1:54:25] out and go through the same bitter cycle
[1:54:28] over and over and over again amen
[1:54:36] now
[1:54:37] scoffers
[1:54:38] that say the days of miracles are past
[1:54:41] the baptism of the holy ghost is just
[1:54:43] make belief
[1:54:45] blessed is the man that won't do that
[1:54:47] blessed is the man that won't stand
[1:54:49] that'll stand forth for such a thing
[1:54:52] they don't want to mix those together
[1:54:53] you can't mix those things together
[1:54:55] blessed is a man who won't assemble
[1:54:57] himself under those things that denies
[1:54:59] the power of the lord
[1:55:01] the bible said come out from among such
[1:55:04] for the day will come where they'll be
[1:55:05] heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:55:07] more than lovers of god having a form of
[1:55:10] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:55:12] from such turn away
[1:55:14] blessed is the man that will not
[1:55:16] assemble himself with these golfers
[1:55:19] making fun calling the true church a
[1:55:22] bunch of fanatics
[1:55:24] he shall be like a tree that is planted
[1:55:27] by the rivers of water god has put him
[1:55:30] in a choice spot
[1:55:31] his fruit shall not wither he shall
[1:55:34] bring forth his leaves and his fruit in
[1:55:37] his season
[1:55:38] watch how david wondered that this man
[1:55:40] is blessed he will be planted not just
[1:55:43] set out
[1:55:44] you know i i see uh i like to see
[1:55:46] anything planted and either israel
[1:55:49] in egypt was not planted they were just
[1:55:51] set out
[1:55:53] it wasn't their original home ground
[1:55:55] in a man that's a christian that rests
[1:55:58] his eternal dona
[1:56:00] destination upon some denominational
[1:56:03] creed he's not in his right place
[1:56:07] he was born to be free
[1:56:10] amen but he's under a creed
[1:56:12] and he can't bring forth his fruits
[1:56:15] he was born to be a child of god and the
[1:56:18] worship god and something sent him to
[1:56:20] longing to do it he should be like a
[1:56:22] tree that's planted
[1:56:24] by the rivers of water
[1:56:26] rivers uh or water singular real rivers
[1:56:31] plural many rivers come into one channel
[1:56:33] in other words he'll be like a man in
[1:56:35] the scripture that believes all of god's
[1:56:38] word
[1:56:39] amen where the power and the nine
[1:56:42] spiritual gifts can flow through one god
[1:56:45] into his innermost being
[1:56:47] people don't believe in shouting the
[1:56:49] thing of it is they haven't got
[1:56:51] spiritual joy
[1:56:52] and the joys of the water of life can
[1:56:55] flow through and that's a whole lot lots
[1:56:57] of matter with branham tabernacle it's
[1:57:00] because the unbelief that cares the
[1:57:02] worlds has bound the people until it
[1:57:04] cannot produce spiritual growth and
[1:57:06] that's what's matter with our nation
[1:57:08] that's what's a matter with their
[1:57:09] churches they have no joy and the joy of
[1:57:12] the lord is departed was written one
[1:57:14] time in the scripture the hebrew word of
[1:57:16] ichabod which means the presence of the
[1:57:19] lord had departed that's over our
[1:57:21] churches because we left off the
[1:57:23] original foundation and placed it into a
[1:57:25] creed and denomination and permitted the
[1:57:28] things of the world to dry up our
[1:57:30] experience with god
[1:57:32] think about that
[1:57:35] man
[1:57:36] you know people get on fire
[1:57:39] they start out
[1:57:42] with a fervency and a love for god
[1:57:45] and it isn't long until what happened
[1:57:49] they get
[1:57:50] things that drives up their experience
[1:57:54] a little spirit of criticism comes
[1:57:57] and it begins to well i don't like the
[1:57:59] way they did their music and i don't
[1:58:01] like that one when he sings and i don't
[1:58:03] like this and you know this preacher
[1:58:05] ain't up to my power and you know they
[1:58:07] you know brother tim he preaches too
[1:58:10] long and this one does this and
[1:58:12] and and you know on and on and on and
[1:58:14] that one only screams when he preaches
[1:58:16] and you know it don't feed me and
[1:58:21] first thing you know you're a sticker
[1:58:24] a cactus like i said try to rest under
[1:58:27] shade
[1:58:29] he said oh go with me to arizona let me
[1:58:31] take you to the desert which i roamed so
[1:58:34] many years and everything in the desert
[1:58:36] has a sticker
[1:58:38] any little plant you come to don't get
[1:58:40] near it it'll stick you
[1:58:42] it's always got its stickers right out
[1:58:44] ready to stick anything that comes near
[1:58:45] it what's the matter what made it a
[1:58:48] sticker is because it had no water
[1:58:51] that's what dried it up
[1:58:53] that sticker is a leaf rolled up for the
[1:58:55] lack of water it becomes a sticker and
[1:58:57] this it is with the churches that when
[1:58:59] the church gets away from the fountain
[1:59:02] of life
[1:59:03] when it gets away from the joys of
[1:59:05] salvation when it gets away from the
[1:59:08] lord god then that person becomes a
[1:59:11] sticker
[1:59:13] finding fault
[1:59:15] sticking no sooner you come up i'm
[1:59:17] precipitation and i'm methodist i'm
[1:59:19] so-and-so don't talk to me about that
[1:59:20] stuff a sticker it has no fruit you take
[1:59:23] that same plant the cactus and you put
[1:59:25] it in the land for a few generations
[1:59:27] where there's plenty of water and that
[1:59:29] sticker will unfold and will become a
[1:59:31] soft leaf bearing fruit
[1:59:36] now i don't know if that's so true in
[1:59:37] the natural but it's your true in the
[1:59:39] spiritual
[1:59:40] amen so he said what's the matter with
[1:59:43] the church today
[1:59:44] it's been set into a denomination
[1:59:47] that has put denominational creeds and
[1:59:50] and binds it no joy
[1:59:53] just a sprinkle now and then of a little
[1:59:55] revival to hold it
[1:59:57] what it needs is to come out from among
[1:59:59] scoffers
[2:00:00] and unbelievers and be planted by the
[2:00:02] rivers of waters for there is a fountain
[2:00:05] filled with blood flowing from
[2:00:07] emmanuel's veins where sinners and
[2:00:09] unbelievers plunge beneath the flood
[2:00:12] lose all their guilty states
[2:00:15] a tree david said planet buy the rivers
[2:00:18] of water
[2:00:20] oh god cannot flow himself through a
[2:00:22] cactus
[2:00:23] now water represents life we know moses
[2:00:26] in the wilderness smoke the rock gave
[2:00:28] forth waters of life to pearson people
[2:00:30] jesus said as the moses smoked a rock in
[2:00:34] the wilderness so must the son of man be
[2:00:36] lifted up and he was smitten
[2:00:39] now however this tree according to joel
[2:00:43] gets eaten down by four different stages
[2:00:47] of one insect
[2:00:50] and this corresponds with the four
[2:00:53] horse riders
[2:00:54] of revelation
[2:00:57] and it was the same antichrist spirit
[2:01:00] that rose up starting out with a white
[2:01:04] horse
[2:01:05] and then bloodied in persecution and
[2:01:07] become red
[2:01:09] and then blackened in the dark ages
[2:01:12] and became black
[2:01:14] and the last stage a pale grizzled color
[2:01:17] combination of red white and black
[2:01:21] but irregardless of what kind of insects
[2:01:24] there has been
[2:01:26] god has said i
[2:01:27] will restore
[2:01:30] and that is the theme of this message
[2:01:34] that is the ministry of elijah
[2:01:37] that's what he was sent to do turn the
[2:01:40] hearts of the children back to the
[2:01:43] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[2:01:45] with a curse
[2:01:47] if it's not restored it is cursed
[2:01:52] i'll send you a light to the prophet
[2:01:55] to restore the original faith
[2:01:58] and if they refuse to be restored
[2:02:01] back to the book of acts of pentecost
[2:02:03] i'll smite the earth with a curse and
[2:02:06] fire will fall as sodom burns with an
[2:02:08] oven
[2:02:10] are you with me
[2:02:12] this is this is the consequences
[2:02:15] of not accepting the restoration amen
[2:02:19] so well i've accepted elijah but if you
[2:02:21] hadn't how your heart isn't turned
[2:02:24] back to believing again
[2:02:27] back to faith again
[2:02:29] a restoration taking place
[2:02:34] then you're smitten with a curse
[2:02:37] there's going to be a lot of cursed
[2:02:39] children
[2:02:42] because why they did not they were not
[2:02:45] restored are you with me amen now
[2:02:48] uniting time inside brother brethren
[2:02:49] said what he say in malachi 4 would
[2:02:51] restore restore back the original
[2:02:54] pentecostal faith
[2:02:56] back to the same people with the same
[2:02:59] pentecostal message the same pentecostal
[2:03:02] sign the same pentecostal evidence the
[2:03:05] same god the same power the same
[2:03:08] teaching everything exactly with the
[2:03:10] vindication of the same pillar of fire
[2:03:12] that struck paul down on the road down
[2:03:15] to damascus among us today doing the
[2:03:17] same things he did in that day
[2:03:20] again and turn on the light if it's a
[2:03:22] bright tree
[2:03:24] jesus was the bridegroom he was a tree
[2:03:27] they cut him down he was a tree of life
[2:03:29] that was in the garden of eden they cut
[2:03:31] him down hung him on a roman tree to
[2:03:33] make fun of him what did he do god
[2:03:35] raised him up the third day from the
[2:03:37] dead and today there's a bride tree that
[2:03:40] started back there at the beginning way
[2:03:42] back in the day of pentecost
[2:03:45] amen listen you people that belong to
[2:03:47] church the church never started in nazir
[2:03:50] rome it started in jerusalem on the day
[2:03:53] of pentecost started the church then
[2:03:55] what did they do they just kept
[2:03:57] organizing god keeps cutting off the
[2:03:58] branches they're
[2:04:00] organized solution and cut off the
[2:04:02] branches
[2:04:03] wesley cut off the branches pentecost
[2:04:05] cut off the branches
[2:04:07] god is gonna have a bride tree
[2:04:13] and i'm just saying don't get cut off
[2:04:18] come on god's going to have a bright
[2:04:20] tree all that the cankerworm ate and the
[2:04:22] caterpillar 8 i will restore
[2:04:28] hallelujah i will restore saith the lord
[2:04:31] amen brother bill can't you glad god's a
[2:04:34] restorer
[2:04:35] amen that he can take you out of
[2:04:37] unfruitful land and place you in a
[2:04:39] fruitful land and make you a fruit tree
[2:04:41] again
[2:04:42] aren't you glad that god doesn't give up
[2:04:44] on you
[2:04:47] hallelujah aren't you glad that god
[2:04:49] cares about you and your situation and
[2:04:52] he won't leave you where he found you
[2:04:55] but he said this time i'm gonna
[2:04:58] fertilize you i'm gonna dig around you
[2:05:01] and you're gonna pray for fruit
[2:05:07] brother branham said
[2:05:09] but god's going to have a bright tree
[2:05:13] and that cake of worm all that he ate
[2:05:16] and the caterpillar ate
[2:05:18] i will restore us say the lord malachi 4
[2:05:20] tells us we'll be brought back to the
[2:05:22] original faith like it was on the day of
[2:05:25] pentecost
[2:05:26] the faith of the fathers we believe that
[2:05:29] will come i believe it's time for it now
[2:05:32] amen
[2:05:33] and the lid the limbs are withered and
[2:05:35] dried up and they're taking them from
[2:05:36] the tree so that the fruit can bear
[2:05:39] itself right at the top of the tree
[2:05:44] hallelujah
[2:05:45] so jesus is coming but he's looking at
[2:05:49] your tree
[2:05:52] looking for fruit
[2:05:56] and you either let god restore you
[2:06:00] or your curse
[2:06:04] now listen
[2:06:06] satan's doing everything he can to
[2:06:08] destroy the bride tree
[2:06:11] satan has tried over and over again to
[2:06:13] destroy god's fruit tree
[2:06:16] but though it might be eaten down to a
[2:06:18] gnarled stump
[2:06:20] satan cannot destroy it
[2:06:23] let me just reassure you satan cannot
[2:06:26] destroy it
[2:06:27] though you were nadine down to a gnarled
[2:06:30] stump
[2:06:31] satan could not destroy you
[2:06:34] amen why it's predestinated
[2:06:37] amen and there is
[2:06:39] predestinated fruit
[2:06:42] and there is an elect church in the last
[2:06:44] day and she is predestinated to be there
[2:06:48] without spot or wrinkle or blemish or
[2:06:51] any such things and the worms might have
[2:06:54] eaten it down but it can't die
[2:06:58] and that's what brother branham would
[2:06:59] say i'm standing here on this jump and
[2:07:03] saying it's going to live
[2:07:05] there will be a bride tree in the last
[2:07:08] day that will bring forth the fruit
[2:07:15] it's always been that way
[2:07:17] satan's always tried to destroy the tree
[2:07:20] cain cut down the righteous tree of abel
[2:07:23] but it came back with seth the children
[2:07:26] of cain like bugs eight or eight at the
[2:07:29] sons of god married the daughters of men
[2:07:31] with them and god took noah through the
[2:07:33] flood and three branches come up to
[2:07:35] replenish the earth
[2:07:38] then jesus was the bride tree
[2:07:42] the bridegroom tree
[2:07:44] the restoration of the bride tree let me
[2:07:46] just share with you these quotes he was
[2:07:48] god's perfect
[2:07:49] prophet tree example tree the bridegroom
[2:07:53] tree
[2:07:56] from the garden of eden
[2:07:59] then the bridegroom tree without the
[2:08:02] female don't bear fruit so he's got to
[2:08:05] have a bright tree
[2:08:08] that's the way adam was without without
[2:08:10] eve he could never bring forth
[2:08:13] is that right
[2:08:14] amen so you same thing with christ he's
[2:08:17] the bridegroom tree he's the pollinator
[2:08:22] but he's got to have a bride tree
[2:08:25] to bring his life through
[2:08:28] amen and she's got to be born of the
[2:08:30] same material
[2:08:33] the same species that he is
[2:08:36] amen the word made flesh in the tree
[2:08:40] amen oh hope you get that it's the same
[2:08:43] life in this female tree amen as it was
[2:08:47] in the bridegroom
[2:08:49] the same life that was in the bridegroom
[2:08:52] isn't the bride
[2:08:54] because they're the same species and
[2:08:56] together christ and his bride in his
[2:08:59] garden produces sons
[2:09:04] oh my
[2:09:06] now
[2:09:07] so he said the works that i do
[2:09:11] shall you do also
[2:09:14] what's in the groom is also going to be
[2:09:16] in the bride
[2:09:18] amen so he says i am the vine and you
[2:09:21] are the branches
[2:09:24] i am the source and you're the one going
[2:09:26] to bring forth the fruit
[2:09:28] amen so you're the branches you bear the
[2:09:31] fruit and the male and the female tree
[2:09:33] produces the pollen one to the other
[2:09:35] brings the fruit and the branch of the
[2:09:37] vine does the same thing
[2:09:39] the first tree was a prophetry a perfect
[2:09:42] tree the god of the prophets he was the
[2:09:45] major tree he was god's perfect prophet
[2:09:48] proper prophet tree why he was the word
[2:09:52] now the others were minor prophets the
[2:09:55] word came to the prophets but he was the
[2:09:57] word himself in the form of a prophet
[2:10:00] that was the son of man
[2:10:02] now he was god's prophet tree why he
[2:10:05] preached all
[2:10:06] the perfect word of god for he was the
[2:10:09] word of god made manifest
[2:10:11] he was the perfect prophet tree
[2:10:14] that preached the perfect prophet word
[2:10:16] that brought forth the perfect prophet
[2:10:19] fruit by the perfect word of god
[2:10:23] hallelujah
[2:10:24] amen you talk about a tree
[2:10:28] amen he was the life tree
[2:10:32] that adam and eve went away from in the
[2:10:35] chairman's garden but now the cherubims
[2:10:37] the angels of god are trying to get you
[2:10:40] back to be in a tree again
[2:10:42] [Applause]
[2:10:43] hallelujah pulling back to human beings
[2:10:47] so they can eat of that tree
[2:10:49] so the perfect prophet tree preaching
[2:10:51] perfect prophet word with perfect

[2:10:56] perfect fruits of the spirit
[2:11:00] hallelujah this ain't peter piper picked
[2:11:03] a peck of peppers

[2:11:12] results perfect fruits of the spirit
[2:11:15] and for mockery they hung him on a roman
[2:11:19] tree
[2:11:21] amen being god's spiritual perfect tree
[2:11:25] they hung him on a mammoth tree and
[2:11:27] they're trying to take god's perfect
[2:11:30] tree the word and mix it and hang it up
[2:11:33] on some kind of creed and death in life
[2:11:36] what makes
[2:11:38] jesus never did attend a funeral service
[2:11:42] he would raise the dead death and life
[2:11:44] he said can't can't stay together
[2:11:47] they're contrary one to the other he
[2:11:48] didn't preach any funerals he just
[2:11:50] raised them up amen you know legion
[2:11:54] he lived among tombs
[2:11:57] dead things
[2:11:59] jesus went to deliver a man who was
[2:12:01] among the tomb he went to seek and say
[2:12:03] that which was lost
[2:12:05] and he said oh
[2:12:06] tombs
[2:12:08] that's a good place a good hangout for
[2:12:11] the devil around a dead place
[2:12:14] now think about it god likes to hang out
[2:12:17] under an oak tree
[2:12:19] with life in it
[2:12:22] but here the devil likes
[2:12:25] an old barren snag
[2:12:28] with no life in it
[2:12:30] and legion
[2:12:32] he howled out in the tombs because he
[2:12:35] said it's a good hangout for the devil
[2:12:37] around a dead place
[2:12:40] somebody that's dead and sins and
[2:12:41] trespasses don't believe in the power of
[2:12:44] the resurrection lord that's a good
[2:12:45] hangout for devils and if you want to
[2:12:48] know truthfully some of these old cold
[2:12:50] formal churches that's got a form of
[2:12:52] godliness and denies the power of god
[2:12:54] are real hang out for the devil
[2:12:57] that's right a place where they say oh
[2:12:59] that's all work up that's all mental
[2:13:00] that's psychology
[2:13:03] a place that looks over at our youth
[2:13:05] camp and say oh that's a bunch of huey
[2:13:06] and a bunch of workup
[2:13:09] you see dad is an old tomb
[2:13:13] good hangout for the devils
[2:13:16] amen because they deny the power of god
[2:13:20] amen
[2:13:21] you say brother tim all these young
[2:13:23] people they're just faking it let me
[2:13:24] tell you what i would rather see them
[2:13:27] knocking at the door amen seek it and
[2:13:30] keep on seeking
[2:13:32] so what some of them get up from there
[2:13:34] and they go back to their sin and their
[2:13:36] pornography and their evil but i would
[2:13:38] rather see them in church coming down
[2:13:40] the altar
[2:13:42] knocking on the door saying god let me
[2:13:44] in even if they didn't go all the way at
[2:13:47] least they were knocking
[2:13:49] [Applause]
[2:13:56] but you're only looking at half the
[2:13:58] picture
[2:13:59] amen there's many of them that knocked
[2:14:00] and it opened
[2:14:02] that sought and they found it that house
[2:14:04] can receive
[2:14:05] there's many of them today living
[2:14:07] victorious lives
[2:14:09] right here in this church there are
[2:14:11] young people amen who god transformed
[2:14:14] their lives right there at an old
[2:14:16] fashioned altar where god changed them
[2:14:18] in his presence
[2:14:26] brother branham said
[2:14:28] a good place where they say it's all
[2:14:30] work up that's just mental that's just
[2:14:31] psychology
[2:14:33] and oh my some of those devils don't
[2:14:35] make you cut yourself some of them are
[2:14:37] shrewd and polishes could be they're
[2:14:38] scholars don't think they're not no you
[2:14:41] say brother brian i'm no no i'm
[2:14:42] scripturally
[2:14:43] then them high priests and those jews in
[2:14:45] that day that denied jesus christ they
[2:14:47] were polished bible scholars hallelujah
[2:14:50] that same religious devil comes down to
[2:14:52] people today some trying to make fun of
[2:14:55] the baptism of the holy ghost or
[2:14:56] speaking with tongues
[2:15:00] but nevertheless
[2:15:02] god's going to have a tree
[2:15:05] and he planted a tree on the day of
[2:15:07] pentecost
[2:15:08] so it was established on the day of
[2:15:11] pentecost
[2:15:12] where
[2:15:13] peter preached the inauguration sermon
[2:15:16] when the church was born
[2:15:19] and was born on the day of pentecost now
[2:15:21] god he's infinite
[2:15:24] he's a and he cannot change
[2:15:26] his church must remain the same as it
[2:15:29] was at the beginning you believe that
[2:15:32] amen said must
[2:15:34] remain the same so you don't take her
[2:15:36] with it
[2:15:37] come on amen you you know you don't
[2:15:40] change it you don't add to it
[2:15:43] it never was shaking hands and saying i
[2:15:45] believe the message
[2:15:47] it never was except in a theology and
[2:15:50] say i believe that perusa are the
[2:15:51] presence or this or that the other that
[2:15:53] never was it
[2:15:55] what was it it was a sound from heaven
[2:15:58] like a russian mighty wind
[2:16:00] that made men and women come to life
[2:16:04] amen and they were endued with power
[2:16:06] from on high so you see every tree
[2:16:10] must have its beginning at pentecost
[2:16:14] what the church had in pentecost is her
[2:16:17] inalienable right
[2:16:19] originally she had the pure word of god
[2:16:21] she had the power of the spirit then
[2:16:23] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[2:16:25] and gifts of the holy ghost
[2:16:28] now planted any other place than
[2:16:32] pentecost
[2:16:33] will cause it to bear sour fruits
[2:16:38] but this is brother brandon's prayer
[2:16:41] he said granite father
[2:16:42] heal of the sick and afflicted
[2:16:45] bring them back to an old-fashioned
[2:16:47] revival type of people
[2:16:49] bring them back to original pentecost
[2:16:52] bring them back to the blessings bring
[2:16:54] them back like the pentecost that fell
[2:16:56] at 80 33 give them the pentecostal
[2:16:58] blessings may the power of god come into
[2:17:00] the church may there be divine healing
[2:17:02] gifts give to the church may there be
[2:17:05] speakers with tongues
[2:17:06] interpreters of tongues may there be
[2:17:08] gifts of prophecy all different
[2:17:10] manifestations not make believe or try
[2:17:13] to believe or put on but real genuine
[2:17:15] coming with the word and the word of god
[2:17:17] made known prophesying things that come
[2:17:20] to pass

[2:17:23] that's among you

[2:17:31] prophet because i'm with him god give us
[2:17:33] that kind of prophets
[2:17:35] give us the real kind the kind the real
[2:17:38] kind that speaks with tongues the real
[2:17:41] kind that has real interpretation
