turned his life around I'll tell you we ought to be able to say it God good to give us so many blessings hey man we're not deserving of any of them it's just grace a man his mercy and grace to us so god bless you let some stand together as we read the scripture this morning we're going to read from Isaiah chapter 27 and verse 12 I thought it was very striking to me as I was trying to prepare for service up there in Pennsylvania and actually a couple of services there and I just you know to it throughout my day of just preparing my my thoughts and my attention kept being brought back to this to service here and to speak to you today so I believe that God had this very service in mind before the world began and I believe he knew exactly who would be here who would not be here what the need would be who would listen in who would hear this service and the attitude in which they would hear it and today you know we will speak about some things as we close out the year and you know I you know I'm going to approach this maybe as if this was the last sermon I would ever preach because this is the last sermon that outreach this year and not just a month but the year and so you know I will speak some things to you as a congregation I'll speak some things to those who will listen in to throughout the world where it will be maybe those who will be streaming the service and you know will speak some very direct things and so you know if as we speak and and and maybe as we hear I just pray that the Lord give us wisdom to to say the things that is on our hearts today because I have some very direct things to say as we close out the yeren and I said I'm going to approach this as if this was the last sermon I would ever preach and you know I really think maybe that's the way we ought to approach any any time that we come to serve us because we don't know when this would be the last time we will gather amen and so we ought to approach it with some very great sincerity and dedication in our hearts of children there for a mural background today it's it's maybe not real clear um as you as you look upon it but I don't think this scene is really clear to the naked eye anyway and this is a glimpse into the holiest of holies the veil is being lifted back and the high priest is looking in and it would be here that the priest would go in for for the Day of Atonement where he would bring the atoning blood to put up on the seat of Mercy and today I'm going to be speaking on the call back to the original atonement now it is an a retelling of the sacrifice it is not going back to Calvary again and Jesus dying on the cross again but it is to call back to the original atonement which is the blood life of Jesus Christ and we're going to be speaking about that to call back to the original atonement amen so isaiah 27 in verse 12 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river under the stream of egypt and ye shall be gathered one by one o ye children of israel and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which are were ready to perish in the land of assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt shall worship the Lord in the holy mount at Jerusalem then I would like to go to Leviticus chapter 23 and we'll read from the 24th verse and this is where the day of atonement was established and it says speak unto the children of Israel sayin in the seventh month now we carry that that down you know there were seven feast and we are we are here worshiping under the last feast which is the Feast of Tabernacles where we're about to change our Tabernacles our dwelling place and and of course in this was in the seventh month which again represents seven church ages which we are in the endtime age or the seven churches now in this first day of the month you shall have a Sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets and holy convocation and then I would like you to back up to Leviticus chapter 16 we'll read from verse 11 there and this is instructions to Aaron the high priest and Aaron shall bring the Bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and shall make an atonement for himself and for his house and shall kill via the Bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and he shall take a sensor full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small and bring it within the veil and he said put the incense upon the fire before the Lord that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he died not and he shall take the blood of the Bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times so there would be seven sprinklings of blood which again for us there's blood forever church age a man now then back him back up to Leviticus 16 verse 29 we will read a here or going there Leviticus 16 29 and this shall be a statute for ever unto you that in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls and do no work at all whether it be one of your own country or of a stranger that sojourneth among you for on that day shall the pre make an atonement for you to cleanse you that you may be clean from all your sins before the Lord it shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you and you shall afflict your souls by a statue forever amen god bless you you can have your seats hey man just a little more sound up here brother Tim now as we are approaching this today and as you know we have read about the blowing of the trumpets we have read about the day of atonement and of course the Bible would tell us that these are all types and shadows Paul would say they were written to us for an example so God would actually plan out his work of redemption and then he would play it out through the the Jewish race as he would set up a tabernacle on the earth and and he would type out exactly what he would do at Calvary and his work of atonement now as you notice all of these are in the seventh month of the year which would be actually their day their their fall feast in which there would be the three feasts that would take place which would be the Feast of the trumpets and then the day of atonement and then finally the Feast of Tabernacles now there was also for more feasts before that which was a spring feast which would begin with the Passover and the firstfruits and the unleavened bread and finally Pentecost now this of course would in the fall feast would would began a a time first with the blowing of the trumpets now the trumpet is to call the people to assemble themselves together for something and I'm sharing this from the visas of their trumpets sermon we said sometimes it would announced an important person like in Joseph they sounded the trumpet and Joseph was appearing at a symbol of the great trumpet we'll get after a while in Isaiah that says when the great trumpet sounds when that enzyme will be lifted up up there and there come a time when the great trumpet will be sounded and all the nations will gather to Jerusalem and that's when the man the millennium starts the great trumpet so we know we're right here on the very cusp of this great trumpet as it sounds out throughout the land and of course we know as the trumpet begins to sound for Israel to announce to them the coming of their Joseph their Messiah that at the same time there will be it will call the dead in Christ and they will come forth and and then we will see them and we will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye now what a great promise that is this morning that we have as we know that we're living now not in the springtime where there is Calvary the Passover and the unleavened bread and and the firstfruits of the Resurrection and finally on the Pentecost where it comes to - there the day of Pentecost would which would initiate in the coming of the Holy Ghost but we are here in the hours of the finishing of redemption and so we're we're in the evening time but we could say in this the fall time but yet it's a new beginning um this one because these feasts would also introduce to them a new year where that they would come into a new beginning or a new year and this is a time for a new beginning the time for all the ages to be over and that will take place at the literal translation of the I do Christ not before but when she is literally incorporate chorus corporately changed into immortality there the ages will end then we will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air now so these trumpets though that they're also spoke about in the book of Revelation the blowing of the seven trumpets and these trumpets would sound and their purpose is to gather Israel back to their homeland now I want you to remember that we've got actually two things happen that it wants we have God dealing with the Gentiles and finishing up their Redemption we have then God in his beginnings of gather in Israel back to her homeland and then um initiating redemption or bringing Redemption to them and sealing in the 144,000 for them so you see God's doing two things in the end time he's dealing with Abraham's seed both the literal seed or the natural seed and the spiritual seed the royal seed of Abraham so he's doing he's doing two things at once and and we got to realize then what is our message and what isn't our message or else we try to become something or try to apply something to our lives that we're not you see and so again the trumpets sound to gather Israel back to their homeland and notice it is the call back to the atonement they're there come to back to they to God for reconciliation now this again as I said would bring in a new year for them the new beginning and the day of atonement was a gracious day for Israel each year were they could experience a new beginning by being cleanse from their sins and restored to fellowship with their maker whoa what a day that's going to be for Israel when that day will be from their sins of rejecting the Messiah and turning down the Word of God and then restored it back to fellowship with their maker it reminds us is reminiscent of the time of Joseph you know when he was rejected by his brethren sold out into Egypt and and then well then of course comes into power raised up from the pit and sat at the right hand of Pharaoh there and there on all of them his brethren would come and bow down before him and yet he was provided for them while all along the way until the day he finally makes his up known to his brother don't you know that's quite an our church where that God has been waiting a long time to call his brethren in and say I am Joseph I am Jesus that you crucified but it was done to save libel look at all of these that got redeemed because of what happened to me at Calvary I gave my life it was for your good what a day that's gonna be hey man now on this day shall the atonement be made for you he said in the Book of Leviticus to cleanse you from all your sins you shall be clean before the Lord oh what a day of atonement what a day now notice it's not gonna be that wreak ihling of the sacrifice it's not even on gonna be offering another sacrifice that lamb is sufficient a man that lambs blood is sufficient we're talking about the Lamb of God come on I mean it's not going to be offered a new lamb or bring it into a new worship but it's going to be changing their attitude toward who that the atonement that's already been given hallelujah well if they will recognize their Messiah now this day of atonement is one of the most solemn and important holy day on the Jewish calendar and it was the day where the high priest would go in beyond the veil and he would he would make an atoning sacrifice for the sins of the people and this this act of atonement would bring a reconciliation between God and His people now the call of the trumpets which precedes the day of atonement was to bring Israel true this time of atonement was a time of gathering together now remember there is another gathering that is going on with thee with the royal seed of Abraham and are gathered together of course is unto Christ is not to one church or one denomination or one little theory or this or that it's a gathered together under Christ a man that no matter where you are you don't have to belong to evening like Tabernacle you don't have to go to church here you may never have ducked in the doors of this place but if you're gathered in Christ and then you heard the trumpet call and you've been gathered into Christ that's what's important I gather it isn't a personality our gathering isn't to a certain preacher a man a certain location I'm shattered is under Christ and that Christ is the word are you with me now when the trumpet sound in this last age it was most it was about to fold spiritually literally are you with me now spiritually there was spirits that was released the Bible tells you in in Revelation chapter 9 that it was released from the from the river Euphrates spirits that were bound up and held back that was not allowed to be released until the end time and that's when 300 million demons come out and this age is more affected than any other age this is where all the same of all the ages pound together and heat together right here in this in this last day this is where all the evil of the world comes together this is where all the demons of the world are gathered together you know what they're gathered for one thing they're gathering for you so that Satan will become their king and he will become king of the earth the Bible said he will reign for three and a half years while the bride is in glory I'm so glad we don't have to be here it's bad enough right now ma'am but just cheer up the worst is yet to come and a man is not going to get any better it's going to get worse and worse and darker and darker and that's why we need Jesus to come back that is our only hope a man though I love it to see young people get married and make plans for the future but I'm telling you friends our real future is not on earth I love a new marriage her new job or a new this or new that I real hope is the coming of the Lord Jesus that's got to be our focus that's how we gotta live our lives as if yes we're our last day on the earth because even if he doesn't come in a corporal body today he may come for you today you have no promise on tomorrow not here you're only here a short time and it'll soon be over it'll be over soon enough more quicker than you realize it was only yesterday I got married it was only yesterday I started preaching it was only yesterday it wasn't no time ago like that we're about to celebrate this will we coming up 50 years for brother Jerry's sister Phyllis it's just yesterday flash you'll all be over it's only what's done for Christ is what's gonna last I'll tell you this if there ever was a time to put your whole heart into this to put away your lukewarmness to have a passion for truth a man to live your life for Christ and therefore living for others how important to see us now as I said all of these spirits were released it was released against naturally against the seed of Abraham there that the Jews and and then drove them from the places from their comfort zones from their places and Germany and Poland and Russia and wherever they were in the world and put a burning seal in their heart we gotta have a homeland there's gotta be a place for for the Jews and it puts something in their heart and they realized this ain't our homeland and the same thing happened spirits leader some of you spiritual Israel you were sitting there comfortable in the denomination that you were in but there was something driving in your heart I've gotta get to homeland I've got to find the place where the Bible is freeze where the Word of God is true where there can be healings and miracles and signs and wonders and real salvation something that works we got to have some reality we gotta have something that is real and you see we we were we were driven here I don't know about you but that's why I feel I'm driven to this place and driven to this Bible to this world of God hey man now so why why was it all what was all this about it was to drive them back to Israel to the homeland where that the Messiah could be revealed to them are you with me and so that day could come back to the original atonement now that's the whole purpose of the whole thing and that's a very purpose we are here we are not here to have a nice church and I have a little something different from everybody else and a little different belief from anybody else or to have another denomination forming a new denomination that's not why we're here we're here to see the Messiah we are here to crown him Lord of lords King of Kings man that the headship would be Christ amen that we wouldn't be ruled over by a pope or a bishop remember we be ruled over by the Word of God that's the longing that's in the heart now just sharing this quote from Feast of the trumpets he said now here is a calling out time at the sixth seal when it's opened the persecution struck the Jews in the little standpoint and here comes a persecution to the church in the ecclesiastical from the standpoint because the bride has already called the Sabbath's are over and ready for the Jews to to be called wear to the feast of atonement in other words we've decided being over we've reached the last church age hey man we're at the end of it and we're ready now for the Jews and then the gospel of the to turn back to the Jews and that they can be called to the feast of atonement what to recognize the atonement not the more chickens and geese and what they've been doing but the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world is was gonna know that hey man now the day of atonement for Israel will be their time the recognition of the atonement that was already made by the sacrifice of the sin offering Jesus Christ it will be a day of mourning and a time of recognition of the blood that was shed now part of this atoning redemptive work of the lamb is the blowing of the ram's horn which we preached about last Sunday which calls Israel - the day of atonement but it also calls us back by the last gospel trumpet - to the Gentiles the seventh angels message it calls us back to the original atonement now listen to this again and I'm sharing this from Feast of the trumpet this will be paragraph 291 where he said now those same as the two prophets did the same as those two prophets they remember the Gentile bride is they have a prophet called Elijah that is to call them out of their traditions the bride just the same as these prophets called Jews out of Judaism to Christ the atonement and the Gentiles already knows the atonement but it's to call the bride back to the original atonement hey man when all were all these seven Sabbath's that they've got away from and call them back it's at the end time listen the seven churches messenger the seventh trumpet messenger is all prophets and now that's right injected is 144,000 calling the seal switches to the Gentiles it had to be the Gentile so open up to the Gentiles to see the Gentile church that's all we know that's all we listened to what's already past we look for Jesus and what he saith is the seals has opened up to us our past don't you realize the coming of those two prophets and their message to Israel will open up to them their past hey man it'll open to them the Messiah that they rejected then their prayer that all the sins will them and the children and then the whole thing that that are the persecution the years old church there's not many people that has been so persecuted as the Jews we talked about in the Great Tribulation I had three and a half years of tribulation are you with me remember when you when you talk about the Jews it's been 2,000 years of tribulation and the Bible said of that day of these Tuesday it will never be repeated again there'll never be a time of tribulation upon a people for 2,000 years like the Jews okay man it's been a horrible time they've been scattered dispersed hated despised and would have been exterminated but God had a plan there were names in the Lamb's Book of Life are you with me a man that had not been manifested upon the earth that was a part of his great work of redemption that the lamb was not only slain for us but was slain for them too now so but for us what did the seals do it showed us the horse riders it showed us down of Christ it showed us how the church got dispersed through the denominations instead of the nation's and denominations it uncovered well you know that wasn't what we went through and why we are here where we're Ted today but it did more than that it emitted more than just telling us our history but it revealed to us Christ again the same Christ that was in the book of Acts the same Holy Ghost with the same accent the same power now notice I want you to notice who it calls us back to the original atonement it doesn't call us back and say the atonement is over it doesn't call us back and say the atonements no more effective that the blood no longer works or that he's no longer high priests or that he's no longer lam it calls us back to the lamb and his atoning blood that's what the real message does a man it's cults and creeds and dogmas of man that puts you away from Christ and his atoning blood and man there is only one way of salvation that is not Church Jordan that's not belonging to denomination they that's not balm into a cult or club or also a creed or a Dogma a man there's only one place of atonement and that's in Christ and His atoning blood nothing else can wash away your sins nothing but the blood of Jesus hey man so you see it would call us back to the original atonement making the atonement necessary in order for there to be a rapture let me just say it without an atonement there's no rupture without the atonement there's no body change when you take the atonement away we have no message without the atonement there's no divine healing without the atonement there is no mercy amen this is why the original totalement is so important that we come back to the original atonement now so you see the original atonement is what has brought us to a bride age and that bright age is an Apostolic age somebody help me now man as long as Mother it's it's the age the apple Stalag age put back into effect again so when we're saying come - the original atonement that it means we come back to an apostolic age again to an apostolic message word that the book of Acts is continued a man hallelujah are you with me so the bride age is within the Laodicean age and we're called there by the messenger of the church out of Azusa Pentecost into the Pentecostal Ginuwine and that's where it calls us it calls us back to the Pentecostal genuine to the same atonement they had on the day of Pentecost hey man I'm going somewhere now brother Branham tells us about in the resume of the ages as he talks about the seven ages and he talks about before the ages began that little spot maybe from Pentecost to to when the ages began somewhere about thirty year period he talks about a time where that the church was pure and undefiled now that was a bride age and when we come down to the end of Laodicea at the last of it by the prophets message within the latency in the age in the seven days it returns back to being a bride's age again hallelujah were the same gospel that Paul preached is what we preach the same word we don't deviate you from one bit and man the same power the same glory a man that was in that Friday he's before the defilement is the same ride that is in the last day in the last church age before we're raptured out of here a man a little space of time where God will have a bride again ready to be married to the groom a bride prepared adorned for her husband just and her wedding gown completing him without spot somebody say without spot without wrinkle without a blemish or any such thing a man a pure bride now so the birth of the church was at Pentecost and the first Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God and was undefiled for a brief span and so was Christ the last Adam given a bride pure and fresh at Pentecost and she remained separate and undefiled for some time but you know just like the serpent beguiled Eve now this is what Paul would come in and he would say look as a serpent beguiled Eve I'm worried about you I'm worried about you that you'll accept another Jesus I'm not worried that you won't still worshipped or that you still alive churches I'm worried that you won't know that Jesus that's the same yesterday today and forever but it'll be replaced with a bunch of cold Creed's and goblins and apostolic on the ideas of the apostolic Creed you know so you know you know again you know some kind of Creed replaced are you with me rather than another rather than the real Bible fundamental Word of God I'm afraid I'm afraid you'll be beguiled I'm afraid there's of seduction coming in fact he prophesied that it would be so this is found in 2nd Thessalonians were that he were that he says that the man of sin would be revealed the son of perdition and the church was so drift until finally they would be seen worship and the man of sin in the church instead of the real Christ now you talk about a falling away the Bible would declare her in the book of Revelation as a church that would stray so far he would call her a someone who hadn't been true to her husband someone who had taken in seeds of another man amen seeds of Pope's and bishops and ideas and denomination and everything else a man now but there when she came from the hand of God at Pentecost under the original atonement she was separate and undefiled a bride now he said how long discontinued we don't know but one day even as he was tempted and seduced by Satan so the church was contaminated by the interest of an antichrist spirit remember the Antichrist spirit comes in to defile to make her cold and formal and powerless and that's what the workings of Satan would want to do to you make you cold and formal and powerless Oh God God hates powerless forsen hey man oh my god hates worship without sincerity God hates it he would say there is well I hate your sacrifices can you imagine sacrifices he instituted but they become a farm that we're just doing it as a ritual and there was no sincerity to it God said I hate it now finally in Revelation 2 we would find the church that first church age he said remember from which you've fallen you have left your first love so already the first that first age was already a fallen woman and his Satan had gotten the before Adam even now Satan seduced the church the Bride of Christ before the marriage supper of the lamb and and what was was it what was it he called her fall the deeds of the Nicolaitans already the first age had turned from following the pure Word of God they turn from God's demand of a church absolutely dependent upon him depending entirely upon God to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government to Nikolaev anism which is organized in a human government within the church which is all governments do legislate for the people they did exactly what Israel did they took the Expediency of human government instead of the word and the spirit now notice what happened to bride got defiled as Eve did and just like Eve the church lost her position in the world and the church agents start out as a church who lost her first love her name would be emphasis which means aimed at and relaxed oh god that's what we don't want to be no feasts and age somebody that aimed at the high call and then relaxed don't you know the danger of the delay that's associated with the coming of the Lord don't you realize how important that it is at you what you know there's that word that Jesus uses with this coming over and over again watch watch watch watch keep your eyes open be alert don't go to sleep you're not at the world don't go to sleep like them be awake you're not of the night you're at the day all of these have to do with this coming don't let yourself get backslidden lukewarm cold farmer powers don't allow yourself to drift just like in this service don't allow yourself to go to sleep this is your last service keep that in mind this is the last service they just came to my mind Paul's last sermon he preached to midnight so hopefully we won't have to go to midnight to get my last one now remember remember how I want you to go back in your mind and I want you to remember how the devil got in the book of Acts church you read the verse seal and brother Branham tells us how he tells us there was a wonderful outpouring of the Holy Spirit and it fell upon upon the rich and the poor in the end the end the and a lot of poor people that were just slaves and there they begin to they begin to rejoice and the truth that they had and they had to joy the Lord and there were signs and wonders among them that was speaking in other tongues and interpretation there were healings and miracles and things that were happening it was a book of Acts church and the matter little dimly lit places of course they couldn't meet in the synagogue's it wasn't theirs they were cast out of there so where they were there a little dimly lit places there and and then many of them were slaves and poor and you know thought of as as a lower class of people and so then you know that they're seeing this joy and these signs and wonders they're some of the masters of these slaves would see them are so blessed by the spirit and God doing signs of wonder and they wanted to know that power salvation themselves and so some of them you know started coming when they come into that dimly lit places and the caves and the people who are in rags and slaves and they're not so celebrities and rich people and you know they're not dressed the best and whatever the rich could not stoop to such as local low subculture of these poor people who spoke in tongues and prophesied so you know what they had to do they had to dress it up a mound and that parallels today can I just say if Kelly can I just talk to you a moment can I kind of just say you know spill my guts as it were and just just say it but there you know that they're parallel since day when God purposely chosen nobody a seventh grade Kentucky with Heights and totes and noted and you know didn't have a college degree and he wasn't from this seminary they mouth and it wasn't classy enough for God to use a prophet with the seventh grade education whose grammar was hillbilly Asst so they had to rise up want to be apostles who thought they needed to bring clarity to the message to polish it up a little bit you know he needed to help to say what the thunders were they needed they didn't you see he he didn't say it plain enough well really he never did say what they said he said you know but even what they wound up saying but they needed something higher something beyond the seventh angel in his message so they claimed another age that something we got something beyond we went around higher we went into a bride age there's something beyond the seventh age oh you know you you back here you're just six sealed leavers were Seventh Seal believers we we got more truth we got more light we got more we're we're we're better off but let me just tell you you know today the fruits of it is shown it was not a it was not a return to the promised land it wasn't going back to the Bible it wasn't going back to the truth of God's Word it wasn't staying with the message hey man but it was it was like Hitler and his deceit Toulouse lured the Jews to a lake you know he he had that all kinds of ploys that he would do to manipulate the minds of these people we're gonna relocate you out of the ghettos here we're gonna give you a better place and and you're going to go there and then they would that would take them on trains and stop and matter place and they would give them a holiday for about three days and good food nice and they were tryin give them pens and papers they write all their friends and relatives we're doing good you know we read their treatments nice and we had good food today and my you know their grill rolled out the red carpet for us not knowing they were going to the death chamber not knowing there was being fed a lie but oh they would have feast and celebrations for a moment only to be left loaded up again like cattle taken down to place and stripped of their humanity see what a return to the promised land it was another concentration camp worse than the ghettos worsen listen worsened in a nomination to come out of you know was and it was just another mood to stuff out faith in God and place it in a personality cult and to traditions of man and traditions as a you know can be a long-established belief and that long as that believe we need a man to rule over us we need a bishop we need an apostle we need an overseer and this this apostle would lord it all over all the other ministers in the churches he become the the great apostles even greater even greater or equal to or greater than Moses on greater than a vindicated prophet I don't know how we take a man that maybe had a miracle or two or prophecy or something come to pass and compare it with a prophet who had miracle after miracle and sign after sign and the angel of God and vindication come on church hey man I'm not talking about some my brave for a deaf person and they were healed I've had that happen where that rule we had in our meetings in Germany a little lady come with her hearing aids and said I don't need this who can I give them to because I was healed by the glory of God today as I was there in the shower I began to hear children's voices and I begin to hear the shower run and I realize my healing has come and I don't need these hearing aids because I'm completely well but I'm not talking about of someone who has had a bad ears and they got healing I'm talking about going into the into to Little Rock Arkansas into the school of the death and a hundred and fifty-two healed in one day I'm not talking about a little miracle once in a while their science followed them that believe we can get you to believe science and follow a man you can get a Catholic now Catholic to believe even the the Word of God of Christ being the healer gotta heal the Catholic God's no respect to person he finds faith he'll heal but we're not talking about a little healing we're talking about God vindicating a message in this last day are you with me a man and now you know it wasn't long you know wasn't long what's the spirits that exalt himself it wasn't long you know until it becomes the voice of the Archangel then next he becomes Michael himself and the next thing you know when he's gone his followers they got a new one better so one of them one of them is Elohim the others the Holy Ghost that is the results of following men and it doesn't produce a rapture doesn't reduce raptured faith it causes disillusionment hurt confusion despair hey ma'am no see you know here here we go you see what is it it's the worship of a man giving him the headship instead of the Word of God now that wasn't enough we had the parousia tradition that went forth and a teacher become greater than the vindicated prophet they called it that the bride aged but it was another oz which just this teacher was needed to dress up the message in order to do so that wound up even denying the deity of Jesus Christ may Jesus lower than than Godhead and turned turned their movement into dead to death camp where there's no spirit no anointing just dry teaching without power and today they're just another little denomination bound even tighter that denominations and yeah and you think that you're in some Fridays because of the tradition you know tradition is is not just something long-standing that can be one one meaning event but a tradition as a doctrine that's not scriptural but just accepted as fact just based on a theory and you think you can just cherry-pick a few little quotes then you pick together and come up with something brother I'll tell you what you come up with you come up with another oz we call it every time remember this here brother branham would tell us in god of this evil aids remember it was an unpardonable sin three times in the Bible for persons to add one word of their own interpretation to God's Word after he had been vindicated the truth and I'll tell you it's been vindicated to be the truth in the Garden of Eden one word at it calls death when Balaam added the word you know we're all the same god never forgive that and everyone in Paris in the wilderness except the three that God brought out and Jesus said there everyone dead that's eternally separated they're all cold never was forgiving it was an unpardonable sin never forgiving them oh my flee it children of the evening lights a man fleeing where are we gonna go to what happened to the Jews when they finally got out of Oz with those that survived those that got out of the death trap Gramps what did they where did it go they couldn't go back their homes they didn't have homes they can go back and settle in Germany that wasn't their home no more they've been uprooted there are the houses torn down their cities rightful their their place is confiscated where could they go that can go to one place it was something in their heart there's gotta be a homeland for the Jews you said where can we go brother Jim where can we go I'll tell you where to go go back to the homeland get back to the Bible get back through the Word of God get back to above the backstrokes get back to truth amen let's suggest with the same today what about the message what about the dress even then you have other personality cults they want to rise to overlord us to tell us only to play tapes in our churches then other personality cults arise tell us what kind of music we can play and control Holy Ghost worship hey man I'm like that I'm like the Hebrew children I won't bend I won't bow and I won't burn hey man I've got a I've got an announcement I just want to say because you you think all day you're just talking about you your local your your local problems and your your your to your some movement problems let me tell you it's a problem whether you're in the charismatic round was the Pentecostal round the Baptist round everybody is juk in four position you see the attitude of it is who's going to be the greatest among us and we ought to know who should be the greatest among us about kingdom building and their kingdom it's about God and his kingdom being Lord of Lord and King of Kings but I've got an announcement for all of them ever personality cult in Christianity that there is today that are vying for position I got a I got an announcement for you take a number and get in line you know there's been many of them before you and there will be many getting the line behind you but when you when you get to the front of the line you're going to be told this so listen when you get to the front align you're finally there to get your physician brother branham tells us in Christ's a mystery as he as the head was taken up from the grave so must his body follow him to Eden ain't no preacher taking us there ain't no bishop taking us there Amen but follow him indeed and therefore the body I'm is part of the body cannot recognize any other headship but the headship of the word hallelujah no denomination can put anything to it for whosoever will add one word away from her or take one word away from it or add one word to it it took away your dead hybrid right there she's back here that's testimonies in her hands up filthiness of her fornication speared committing them spiritual adultery against some very words she claims to believe a man I'm just going to say to take any man as your husband that but Christ is adultery too may take anybody as you're a leader except the Holy Ghost is adultery against God sure a pastor is a leader of an assembly posture is is a head of a local body but he's not your head your head at the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man this is Bible and our head is Christ is that right and as pastors we lead the people by feeding them the word a man so he said therefore it's the word or nothing that's right he's the word how do you know he's the word is venda he the word is vindicated he the word improperly vindicated is the headship the head of the church so I just ask worship indication a man he is properly identified vindicated by his own spirit being in it in the church itself the person suing for himself in vindication is direct proof to the to the entire body you don't need Creed's then denominations as terrorists but the headship itself recognized in the body but personal identification see identify himself proves the headship to the body then we are united under one vindicated headship and that is Christ the Word of God not under any church hey Mac he would tell again in the message God's only provided place of worship have you noticed ever three years a great meeting what takes place a denomination this is twenty years and no denomination deer died lamb may it never do that if I go in this generation make the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination you've got right in your track remember that the very hour you mentioned denomination among you I don't care how sincere you are take man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this word that's the alley you die so we want to die that's all we got to do just become a part of a another personality cult and I'm gonna just tell you you know even then you got to remember your head is Christ you know a lot of people want to give their headship over to a pastor you are to be led by the Spirit of God yourself you should pray over the church that you go to a man because churches carry spirits and you should choose by by revelation and so where you go to church and you do it to find a place that will feed your soul that you can raise your children in the admonition of God whether it be an atmosphere the Holy Ghost air where the power God can move out and Savior children like he saved you dear God you know we knew it took atmosphere for us to be saved and why do we want to deny atmosphere for our own children we want to squash the songs and squats the worship and squelch the praise sprouts the shoutings quasi amens oh my goodness church we want to create an atmosphere remember Souls can be saved where sinners can live their way to Calvary where that God can have the preeminence we don't want to be a bard we don't want to be dad we will have the power of God unto salvation that when our sick needs healing there's a healer there with our children our loss when there's a Savior there well there's a need and the body doesn't need supplier there oh you know we have them we hear teachings today where the pastor claims to be the husband the husband of the church and they teach the pastors the husband of the individuals and assembly and then they begin to take it further it's adultery to listen to anybody else but then this is another form of popery you'd have been better off to stay out where you know at least 34 million that you know three or four about $3 billion that believes like that you did better better stay off like that out in an ism somewhere then to come under that but your brother Branham would make a statement and what's what what what men do with agendas he talks about Lot's wife she started out as an overcomer but she never did overcome oh she left the denomination she did she walked out of Sodom with a lot but when she she wanted to go back have her hair cut you know what it means she had to go back she couldn't she couldn't stand the test she had to go back again to see what the rest of them was doing oh you know I had some good friends down after all and and I tell ya you know this might be just a little movie I don't know whether it could be right or not I only got this man's word for it though he's my husband but yet then he says your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking you see now whether it could be right or not I don't know maybe this revelation wasn't right maybe his revelation wasn't right and and then he said if you're not perfectly satisfied you're not perfectly know that it's the Word of God then you can't go then you've got to be really sold out you got it no not just say well I see others do it I see a sign so if you're looking this in context he's speaking about lot and his wife lot and his wife Lot's wife didn't listen to the leadership of her husband instead she says I don't know whether it could be right or not I only got this man's word for it though he's my husband then brother Brennan said of this woman and referenced a lot in his wife your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking he not telling us that the that your pastor is your husband he's telling the that would the women using Lot's wife that you have a priest in your home who is a pastor of that home and that pastor is your husband the husband of the family the shepherd of the family the priest of the family come on hey ma'am your husband is your pastors fiercely speaking now that's what he's telling now so yeah passwords a head of a local church but he's not a head of the Bride of Christ and he's not your head and he's definitely not your dictator a man he leads the people by feeding them the word a man I you know how how I can't understand how a man could relinquish the headship of Christ to another man you know not to mention allow another man to serve headship over his wife can you imagine there that some some men will live today will leave a church and when they leave the church the pastor sells well now because he's left us he's dead now you just go get married again it's happened and these pastors a serf headship over the women in order to control the men and if the husband disagrees and goes to another assembly and I guess that he's considered dead and the women that just can go get remarried again breaking up homes somebody's going to answer to God for this nonsense hey man oh brother I you know I don't know you may want a pastor to tell you what kind of color cards it's a drive or what models are driver how much debt that you can incur we do do that you may want a pastor like that be you picked the wrong place I really don't care what color you drive and I really don't want to be bothered with the details of all your stuff I would love rather you get in love with Jesus Christ and that you know the leadership of the Holy Ghost and you pray over your decisions rather than come to me to make them cuz I ain't gonna be your Holy Ghost hey ma'am but notice now the atonement brings you back to where the head of every man is Christ and the head of the family is the man these are well what if I don't have a husband well in your head is Christ that's just that very simple a man who just goes right up to the next level if you don't have a husband you're unmarried you're a widow your widower your you've been divorced for whatever your condition is you know you that your head is Christ you've got a head all of us got a head a man and you're your husband your husband the man there is not a dictator somebody can help me get this done a man he's not be a dictator over the family he is to lead them by pointing them to the word not just not high his own whim and dictatorship but also considering the needs of the family hey man I'll be off this chain fit in a moment we'll preach something we'll get into some other things but while I'm while I'm cleaning up just let me clean because you know this message brought us from chickens and ducks and geese to from false worship and worship of man and worship whether idolatry is what it is I meant back to the power of Pentecost back to Napa starlit Fridays they meant back to divine healing back to living God a man not some form or tradition with no power over a man or power in it but in this right age you want to leave me somewhere there's no worship there's no holy ghost that ever moves on a person and they get so overjoyed they speak in other languages you there's no divine healing there there's no faith no atonement my blood you want to leave me there that's a ghetto that's where we're stripped a man were stripped of our Christianity and it's relying upon a Pope a bishop now you see the homeland was closed off to the Jews but the trumpet called it back hey Ben and let me tell you the same thing when we look at our homeland which is the Bible and now we're going to revelation 5 in our thinking and now the book is sealed off the homeland that's to our homeland in it amen is sealed off with seven seals and man but and so therefore was closed off to us and Paul's gospel closed tell us but what happened they meant God the Lamb took off his seven seals and revealed why we were out of the homeland and how come we got scattered out here in order that we can find our way back not to a closed book but to an open book not to a closed homeland but to our homeland back to an original atonement so the trumpets this trumpets call Israel back to their Bible homeland and the seven seals open our homeland back to us again now so it gathers them back the trumpets gather Israel to their homeland and the six trumpets have sounded and have gathered him back as a nation I think sometimes we fail to really see the significance just look at our counterpart there over there they're building up the wastelands the deserts are beginning to bloom like a rose and then there's life that is coming out of dry places somebody with me I met green pastures or a brand being brought forth revival is happening as there they are getting their land and reclaiming their promise that's our counterpart and but it's only a side then on the other side there is another group of people a royal seed of Abraham that are going back to the forgotten places the dry places Oh hallelujah call it back oh you might be weary you might bend whipped around by the devil you might have been in the ghetto you might have been disturbed in every way but all come back back there is a hole man the is open for you if you need he lives in the homeland that dry place can bloom beginning you need salvation that dry place can bloom again water can come down in the latter rain and bring it to harvest bring fruitfulness in your life so it was to gather them back now the seventh trumpet breaks the silence to Israel to where they recognize the Messiah and the seventh seal is a breaking of the silence which brings about the coming of the Lord the revealing of the Messiah now listen listen church not the revealing of another preacher but to reveal Ana Christ this messenger did not for run another one another preacher to come another apostle to come he was to forerun Christ coming are you with me a man and they would come first as the anointing word to restore his back to original doctrine again back to the original atonement again somebody with me now now that's what it was father it was to bring a restoration back to that first but it isn't it will never and has not and will never be successful unless it produces the corporal return of the Lord Jesus Christ that's what this message is to produce a rapture not one that's an imagination just a spiritual lifting up but something that translates you from this dimension to another so you see the breaking the sounding of that trumpet you know it breaks the silence it's like a trumpet does you know everything you'd be all quiet little sitting that stupid blows when it blows is breaking the silence that right now so again it breaks the silence for them when that seventh trumpet blows it breaks as it makes known as Joseph makes known himself to his brother now Joseph has been silent all of these years hey man now we know he's been working because we've been we've been privy to some things in the book and we found out under the fifth seal are you with me and Amanda when the fish seal was open we found some of his brethren that had died for the testimony that they held for the Word of God and they were martyrs I meant don't don't you imagine what the water day is going to be with them two prophets because that veil how he's been with you all the time you mean during the Holocaust yes that was him you mean during it yeah it was his hand lean your back getting your hand up roots through out of these countries and bring you back to your homeland it was his tender ham hey man it was him working all the time what about all those who are martyred they didn't believe on Jesus data they had no Messiah oh I'll show you look over here under this fifth seal they were given robes you meet my grandmother my great granddaddy who stood for Zion and stood for the Word of God and believed like they did and everything else and they they didn't know Jesus was the Messiah and yet they're given white yeah that's God's grace that's God's mercy to us you see this is what let those two prophets will do and they will reveal this Messiah who's been working with them all the time just like Joseph was given back the money given back to they given giving all the things and provide him for them all along the journey a man he's been providing for them he never forgotten a man he could say of them it was a said of you also could I forget you no I can never forget you why your name's is engraved on the palms of my him Oh if you could just get a revelation this lunar no matter how weary and despondent and depressed that you are if you could just get a revelation today that he hasn't forgotten you your names is engraved on the palms of his van I can never forget you good a woman forget her something child yeah he said but I can't forget you you're part of me every time I look at myself I'm reminded of you hey man I haven't forgot you and forgot your long prayers and your crying out and ignored nothing I hadn't hi you know the sparrow came for without me knowing it you can't get sick without I know it there's nothing can happen you accept I know it and I don't just know what I've done something about it for I was wounded for your transgressions I was bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of your peace is on me and with my stripes you were healed I say what a mighty God what a savior to care so much for us amen here you will come I'm Joseph now listen these words and the trumpet is to call them back to that atonement see the atonement they reject it and they reject they reject it so our eyes could be opened theirs was closed and during these times these seals open the trumpets blue and now the blowing of the trumpet just before the Messiah because he got to be in Palestine you remember God had the hardened Pharaoh's heart to run them out of Egypt he hardened Stalin Mussolini and all of that to get them backed into the promised land where the 144,000 is supposed to be and for the first time for thousands of years 2500 years that Israel is a nation with its own flash its own army and all considered in the UN and first time you spend the oldest fly that's ever flown on earth is at this time flies again the six point style Damon and he said he would lift that ensign in the last days when she'd be coming back hey man we're at the end there's just no doubt about it we're here I mean can say amen to that and that now the Jews are not scattered under a German banner or enzyme they're not under the flag of Oz witch or polish banner are a Russian banner come on wherever they were scattered but they've been gathered under the inside of the Star of David Oh hallelujah God took that which was despised and rejected they would have to wear that that start identify them and it will become a star of shame and despise and I rejected the null downcast people and he took it and lifted it up come on now and makes it now a flag a banner to all the world an enzyme that God has not forgotten his people that is working and bad work in spite of everything that's been going on God's been behind the scene the whole time working things out for their good now as a 1112 says and he shall set up an enzyme for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together to his first of Judah from the four corners of the earth noticed us all then he says and I say a 18 and verse 3 all ye inhabitants of the world in dwellers on the earth see when he lifted up an in sign on the mountains and when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye so let me just say it today we as a Gentile bride we are not gathered under a Methodists or Baptists or denominational banner let's say of one a tape only or return ministry or to soul or seventh under a parousia where we were once scattered but we're under the banner of the headship of Christ hallelujah amen they even say in Song of Solomon 2 and 4 he brought me to his banqueting house how many have been brought to his banqueting house a man a place where there's provision a place where there's a seven-course menu a place where all seven seals are open a place where the Word of God that can be preached freely and uninhibited he brought me to his banquet and house and his banner over me is love hallelujah his banner over me his love unchecked plot for his banner this motor man that his banner over you is without God so loves you he wanted a pride he wanted a people for his namesake and he chose you hallelujah praise the Lord hey man Christ a mystery he says don't you fail this the body therefore cannot recognize any other headship but the word because the head is connected with the body and the head is the word and it's the same word one headship therefore denominations Holy Fathers everything else is dead dumb you say brother Tim that's a bad way to say that Paul said I kill everything I know is dumb he studied under Gamaliel had all kinds of theology and he said I counted all his dumb that I might win Christ and then the body recognizes only one thing the word and he's here today in his word manifesting the same thing she can't recognize another headship there's no bishop no nothing she can she recognizes one headship that's Christ and Christ is the word he says oh I love that yes sir now when the seventh and the last trumpet sounds for the Gentiles the last trumpet sounds for us the bride is caught up and taken out just like Joseph's wife was dismissed to the palace he said they everybody go forth from me and he reveals herself to his brother and under that same trumpet Moses and Elijah distinct as it calls us up the dead from seven ages and we are translated as it Chrisette knows is somebody with me now Isaac could send out the masses turns right over into the Jews and continues right on in Redemption hallelujah a man notice under that trumpet Moses and Elijah those two witnesses shown in revelation 11 will bring them from the traditions of a little lamb now listen don't use our fervent they know it without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins they know they hadn't had bloodshed they know that they hadn't had a temple in effect they know all they've had all of these years was the words of the rabbi and their tradition and everything but they know they need to get ready to welcome the king so they're talking about building the temple and they're trying to breathe a red heifer for the waters of separation they're trying to produce a lamb and they're trying to get the menorah and they're trying to get all the artifacts because they said one day one day the temple will be rebuilt but can you imagine why those Jews those 144,000 and Elijah and Moses will be hated remember Moses and Elijah we use them because it's the law in the prophets which represents the whole Old Covenant and they're coming to him and showing them everything you know the a prophecies that Jesus was given of Jesus there's not enough zeroes that could line up around the world to make the odds of those eight prophecies coming to pass without a supernatural God bring in all of those prophecies to pass but their eyes have been bonded and they are over there celebrating literal Sabbath's we got those in Christendom that does that too you know there's there there's Sabbath day people good people they just don't understand Jews are good people they just don't understand you know we wouldn't we were in Israel we had two sets of elevators we had one set it was for the Sabbath and when you step on it you know you do not have to push a button because it just takes you to the next floor till it gives up the top and then you know and a you know stops it every floor and lets everybody off so you know you get on the Sabbath one on the Sabbath day it's it's kicked in and designed so you don't have to push a button cuz it would be work to push a button and put eighth floor so you just have to get on it at first floor step up here it opens at first 2nd floor 3rd floor 4th floor 5th floor till it finally gets the 8th floor and if that's the top then it'll go back down to 7th and 6th and all the way back down that's the Sabbath elevators so they have a little Sabbath but they're going to be told it ain't a little Sabbath anymore but the Sabbath is the Holy Ghost and it's the rest worrying the weary are called the rest and once you get the Holy Ghost and then you are real Sabbath keeper you've entered in your rest you no longer labor and salmon you home hey man and then there will be changed from the literal Passover of the literal lamp - hallelujah the real Passover the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and they'll be taken away from all of these that were only symbols and types now listen they're going to be hated by the rest of them they will be killed the Bible says so amen under the souls and the all tree said wrestle wild to your fellow brothers are killed like you are there will be killed for their testimony Moses and Elijah will be killed and resurrected and raptured amen and so will the hundred forty 4,000 cuz somehow they're in the Millennium somebody help me preach now you think you're the only one with a resurrection or rapture you think you're the only one with an I'll add your profit amen God's got this whole scene to play out with Israel come on oh man where he does exactly like she did for you took you from from from the laws of do's and don'ts of Old Testament keeping where roads types and shadows and feast and New Moon's and brings you right into where you see the true atonement the Lamb of God that was slain bring you in out of traditions now so before the seventh trumpet sounds to reveal him to the Messiah to the Jews and the last trumpet resurrects the dead in Christ it happens that the last truth doesn't it there is an Elijah a prophet to the Gentiles that calls us from traditions and points us back to the true atonement now it isn't that God makes a new atonement but rather that he simply changes our attitude in our view of the atonement in other words veils of tradition now because there's no wooly veil over this one or no no big heavy veil but it's a heavy veil of traditions of man that have been put on over the atonement over the mercy seat but in this day God sends a message come on to unveil that God not to take away the mercy see but to reveal the mercy seat not to take away the blood but to point us back to the bad hallelujah bringing us back to the atonement you know what this will do with Israel it will cause them to go into a state of repentance those Jews were lured hey man they were more morena to you in the Bible but you see this is this is why Italy oh to see an age that zeal of the hour is to repent allow the traditions to move back where you can see the real atonement now the atonement which is also known as Yom Kippur which is some in Leviticus 23 27 that it provides the day of confession is the highest of all holy days that on the tenth day of the seventh month shall be a day of atonement so it would happen as the Gentiles are having their last church age it would it would it would bring them bring us to where the Jews will come into a day of atonement it also brings us to an atonement it shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord so the Jews have been called back in their homeland to recognize the atonement or what the lamb has done for them what he's already done now remember coming back to this atonement it doesn't it doesn't reveal to us some new form of healing some new salvation it just reveals to us what he's already done hey ma'am healing is something he already did you just got to realize the atonement provided and then salvation is something he's already did and then you come in to the altar he's only accepting what he already did are you with me so now again the Bible said it will mourn for the one day appear so let's go to Zechariah 12 in verse 10 amen and I will pour upon the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace Oh hallelujah the returns in the atonement pours out the spirit of grace amen not the spirit of no mercy come on church not judgment but the spirit of grace are you with me I pour upon the house and David on the inhabitants aru's the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one that mourneth for his only certainty and shall be and bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first bond and that day there should be a great mourning in Jerusalem as a morning of had women in the valley of megiddo and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of David apart their wives apart the family of the house of Nathan apart their wives apart the family of the house to leave our partner wives apart and the family of Semmy our partner wives apart and all the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart they're just going to go into mourning when they realize oh we killed the Messiah now Church that's no different from you we Gentiles we come back to the homeland the Bible to the original atonements not something of geese and ducks and everything else you are insignificant offerings but it's a time to afflict our souls it's a time of mourning and realize my sins put him on the cross that's what really salvation it is when you realize yourself I'll pick this see that for me ma'am he was wounded for my transgressions I had senseless he took my penis he didn't deserve the beatings he got he took mine by this I'm healed delivered I say what a mighty God I said what a savior so here we come back to flicked our souls with Gentiles why we made three gods out of one we took a we took a Trinity baptism instead of the only way they baptized in a Bible which is in the name of Jesus Christ there's not one place in the entire Bible where anybody was ever baptized in any other way than in the name of Jesus Christ we come back to the original atonement we come back it's a day of repentance where we realize I was wrong that I realize now all my chickens and ducks now listen when they come they're gonna look at these red heifers so that won't do no good that lamb won't do no good this menorah won't do no good none of this Sevilla's any value there's only one thing that's a value and that's a lamb the one we pierced and it will be to them like chickens and ducks worthless as a sign atonement are you with me and that's how creeds and dogmas were they never provided anything they were worthless as chickens and geese to take away our sins or to change our lives that shows you how worthless he so-called revelations are that have no acceptable blood to provide an atonement a man atonement with our blood is a chicken and a duck j-man it's a worthless offering it's worthless worship it's a false religion it's a schemes offering now but notice but for the last in the 7th Trump there is a profit to appear before the Gentiles to call the people back to the original Pentecostal doctor hallelujah now that's what our message is to do produced to bring us back to our original Pentecostal doctor back to the gospel Paul preached a ma'am now in revelation 11 we find the Ministry of Moses and Elijah calling the Israel out of Jewish tradition it's just the same as a message called a bride out of Pentecostal tradition and remember Moses and Elijah to call Israel out of their old atonement of the lamb sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice to the world a man so even as their last prophet reveals Christ to the Jews I last seal reveals Christ to the Gentiles it breaks the silence of what he's been doing for the seven ages no and it's to call the bride out of Pentecostal world it can rug tradition to the genuine atonement not not a new atonement but a genuine attempt now bear with me just a moment now I want you to us to realize you see as a brother branham and say let me just share you this quote because this is where I'm gonna jump off from and the seven angels message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seventh seal as to what call the people the bride out of Pentecostal and world tradition now call about a tradition long-standing traditions of having bishops and Pope's and and hierarchies and and overlords and overseers and and pastors for head and all these other thing are you with me to bring you back to the headship of Christ the word a man to the genuine atonement the word Christ has he said he says impersonated it's for sana fide in his word here made flesh among us science proved it by pictures the church knows it the world around we firmly saw it we firmly know it for he never told us one thing and thus said the Lord but what has been the truth is that right is that right hey man what has been de but we every time it was been the truth he did not I say down there on the river as John the Baptist was sent so will this message now I want you to stop a moment let's reflect we're at the end of the year now but let's reflect back even more let's go beyond these years let's go back to the Ohio River for the 1933 the angel of God came down before hundreds of people a light a voice rang out as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of Christ I'm going to say it it's not in vain hey man the word has come but it's going to be more than the word there's coming down coming to the almighty the corporal return of Jesus Christ and we're right here hey man oh it could be in these next few hours it could be next year I don't know when it will be but I know this I want to live today as if he were coming today cuz he's coming for somebody oh man but that's John the Baptist now I want you to look again think again what happened with Jack Nora now that was right here live Tabernacle I went there as a boy you know we got people that were in those meetings raise your hands raise your hands that was in the 1 2 3 4 you know and then myself there was an amine brother different ones it was in that meeting no you know I know I was there I was in there I was I was there I was there on the wings of us no I dove I heard the wondrous things I I witness many their eye witness people that I knew people that I laid my head on her lap as a young boy being called out told her name what does condition was the situations that they were in I saw the Messiah kind but Jack Nora was even more privileged than I him and Gordon Lindsay they saw the atonement coming in full effect are you with me the same atonement the originally told me they saw it coming in full effect I know I ain't got time for all of this let me just hit some points just a moment Jack Moore would scream out human him and and and Gordon Lindsey would write which is now a book of history in a messy and a book called man sent from God and I knew Jack more upset during his certs have listened to service at preach I've heard him speak and Jack more Reuters account and the him along with Gordon Lindsey and they screamed out Bible days are here again why because they were seeing the atonement coming in full effect free of creeds and dogmas amend not bad not being brought by denominational preacher who was who was veiled with some is immerse ISM but oh one who was commissioned by God to break the veil of tradition well that we could see the atonement in full effect he would scream out he raped his account as he screamed out as people came from all over the hills came to them his meetings come to the meetings on the first evening brother Brandon's visit there he said in our large frame Tabernacle this building was so congested we could hardly get in that had never happened on the first night of any meeting but this was a Branham meeting it was a steady stream of traffic that had wound its way through Arkansas yields and Louisiana valleys that day reverently tracing the path of this twentieth century prophet whose prayers oh listen whose prayers the listened his prayers was what on the atonement to the back come on to the sacrifice to the Lamb of God whose prayers could cause diseases to be accursed broken homes to be reunited drunken father's to repent prodigal sons to return feuding churches to stack arms and make peace and lukewarm Christians to be rekindled by the fire of their first love that's what happens when you get your eyes back on the atonement a man it'll cause fathers to repent and prodigal sons to return and broken homes to be reunited and food in turn sister stop harms and make peace and lukewarm Christians to be rekindled by the fire of God I say God let us look beyond the crease let us look beyond the tradition let's see the mighty garden veiled and that's what I happened when you gaze on him when your gaze turns off the men in my church and my kingdom and my dissin my dad and we're the great one and he becomes the great one I say they went on to say yes Bible days are here again here's a man who practice what we preach and I'm gonna just come back around to this right now it's time we start practicing what we preach that we don't just talk about a God of healing we practice bringing a God of healing on the scene so we don't just preach a revival we are the revival then we don't just preach submissive but we become the life of this word lift out of our lives oh I wish you'd get with me in my last sermon this year pour your heart into it a man may it be said we're a church that practice is what we preach we don't only preach the glorious salvation with the provenance of the Holy Ghost but we practice that we'd only only preach the promise of divine healing saying God can but we practice that knowing that God will hey man how many would like to see a god that will instead of just a God that can oh man it's time that we look to a real living God has offered the atonement and it only happens when the veil of traditions are pulled back I'm just going to tell you when now those things happened that affected men of his generation men of his generation got a look at the atonement and it changed their views it changed their view of a God that can that a God that will a God that was at the pastor God of the present till God who used to but now does it again I mentioned jack code before Jack Cole came under that anointing when he saw the wondrous working power that came by the coming of the message remember is john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of Christ and that message showed that the that the atonement was in full effect full of grace full of mercy if it was healing and it was deliverance and it was salvation everything that was needed was in the atonement if you needed it he prefer God provided it for it with the sacrifice at Calvary come on now church is that what brother Tim we're past that now know this message brings us back to the original atonement it approaches to some other atonement it Hortis us back to the original atonement to the original bad - the power of Christ now the message was as it unfolded the first part of that message now remember this message was two 4runners coming and the first part of that message was the atonement is in effect there's never anywhere that the last part of the message is is not of effect in fact it points us back to an atonement that's in effect now the message that was in effect revealed that God was a healer and that he was healing now are you with me now to do this even there was all kinds of traditions it was over days of miracles are past that only happened in the Apostles day God doesn't do that now all kinds of traditions even people's unbelief clouds it you know that many times your own unbelief clouds of mercy seat and all you can see is that that gray cavern of our belief that foggy evil spirit between you in the atonement but oh if you could just take the sword of the word and cut through that darkness and let the bail be torn you would see a god rich and mercy you would see of God who's presently right now to heal you of every disease to save you from your sins Jack Cove this man's faith would be anointed he had scales over his eyes - he was an assembly of God preacher at the time and remember I only just say something remember Malachi 4 was not to turn us into a faithless powerless people Malekith or was said to inspire us to believe and the true message preached and demonstrated with will make the blood atonement more real it'll turn you back to the real atonement now Jack came under that anointing and he believed God for healing and delivers it it made Jack proactive in the new dispensation where that the atonement was was being reconfirmed remember not a killing of the sacrifice but but a reconfirming of the atonement then a new killing of the Lamb but bringing us back to the original atonement and what the Lapp did for us do you remember the story I told it already several times us this year bear with me once more but he went to meeting as a skeptic it was a man that was with note blind he had no eyeballs and he had heard of William Branham and he'd heard that he could discern the secrets of the heart he'd heard of his miracles being done but he was a skeptic can you imagine a Pentecostal preacher a skeptic that God was currently healing delivered sounds like a lot of message preachers still a skeptic they've never seen the atonement Jack scoffs you know when he heard brother Branham tell this boy this man with no eyeballs he told him said you can't see now but in three days eyeballs will form in your head and at the end of the third day you'll come back seeing and Jack sitting there said hey bigger crowd as this is anybody could say that this man to get lost in the crowd and nobody I know it so he just coughed he was sitting by the door it was the door where brother Branham would exit brother Branham would walk by him take him by the knee as he went by just stood there for a minute and prayed softly and he said to him you're not sick said you're just worn down from preaching meetings and don't be so skeptical of this you're doubting whether this was of God or not I want to tell you this is of God and we're both fighting the same devil go on and continue in your revival for you were called to pray for the sick oh he said that really shook him and rejoiced in his heart to realize I have a part in this and then I not only see there that Tolman tendrá that is working but I've got a part in this and he decided to return back to the meeting in three days to see if he couldn't find this blind boy he found him in the meeting there he was blind still doesn't blindness could be but now he had eyeballs eyeballs had formed in his head and he said about the evening time he all of sudden jumped up and began to run all over the building shouting the glories of God I can see I can see I can see because sight had now come into those blind eyes I said and what's been with our eyeballs why because there's a creator in the atonement hallelujah heals a provider whatever that heat is he's the provider Chuck became so inspired I want you to know something he became so inspired until he became fearless and faith I meant to the point he actually became reckless he just said well God said it it's in the word so I believe it's that I'm an active on it you know brother Branham talked to him he said I I thought so much and brother Jackson he had Bulldog faces to hold on for healing he said he would somebody bring up crutches he would have an axe their own and and or on the platform and for he even prayed for me it smack him into pieces hey mom he said that he said if they wouldn't he said if they wouldn't walk away they would have to call away till they got enough faith hey man he had a little anvil there is that he'd settled the pulpit there on the and there he would use this little handle with a little hammer and people come up with glasses and then to be preferred for the eyes he take them off and he'd beat him with that on that angle and sold over on the side he was believing God this is how much it convinced Jack I wonder has the message of the atonement convinced you that on somebody how much has it convince us that this word is true until we become fearless in our pain that we're not just satisfied to see one miracle but we want to see miracle after miracle we want to see healer after healer we want to see deliverance after deliverance why because our faith is back in the atonement you can you can search these things out yourself but there's testimonies one man was in a wheelchair and he came in the prayer line Jack Jack was a big man great big man you know so he looked down at him in that wheelchair and he grabbed him up out of that chair and he held him up and he said in the name of Jesus Christ run and the man crumpled to the floor well Jack reached down and he got him again and he he picked him up and he said I said in the name of Jesus Christ read that and he let him go and he crooked through the ground again this time jack can picked him up again he said I didn't say fall said Romney in the name of Jesus Christ and he spun him around and kicked him in the rear and he went off running around the build and killed by the glory of God hallelujah that was a man whose faith got turned whose battle adds a profit through this eyes back on the atonement and he can make that wooden scripture work now you know Jack looks like a solved there sometimes his own faith would waver and it wasn't Jack Coe it was a healer you know there was there was one man that was in the prayer line it was so hideously crippled up and deformed the jack whenever time he'd get up Jack Allah sent him back to the end of the line the ever time he'd finally pray and they'd get up but he'd get up to again he thumbed go back to the in line prayed again a bunch of people he finally gets up to end of the line here's this hideous man this hideous condition horrible shape and jackman finally there was nobody behind him he was the last person and he stuck with him now and he looks at him and he said he prays said god what am I gonna do and God spoke to Jack you're not the healer I am you know that's our problem sometimes we get the thinking is us and how we pray but it ain't us he's the healer not us hallelujah he's the one who's the healer he's the one that's a deliverer you know I heard of a testimony here's some time again you know of a man that was in a wheelchair paralyzed he was in the prayer line and it went way into the night and Jack became weary and said I'm not leaving the platform said I can't pray for no more I'm physically done and the man he said he was just a few people from being the next in line and you know here his hopes was dashed Jack went over there and he said but I tell you what I can't stand here and pray for anymore people but this is what I'm going to do and he draws a circle with his foot and he goes all around there drawing this circle with his foot he said now I'm going to go but Jesus will still be here and in every person who passes through this circle is going to be healed and so he said there they pushed me through that circle it is that I can't explain it but there's a power God that hit me and out of that wheelchair I came running all over the building years ago and I never been in a wheelchair it's time you see a living God is in our mess God wills to do more than heal elana doubles to do more than just bring one product all amen and this year to come there'll be more saved there will be more souls that will be delivered there will be shall i prophesy there will be both healed by the glory of God a man because why eyes have been changed back to the automa get your eyes on Jesus this morning he's the waymaker he's the healer he's the delivery hallelujah do you live in the slaughtered stand your feet and worship God and
