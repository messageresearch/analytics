[47:31] came to pass
[47:33] when the people removed from their tents
[47:35] to pass over jordan

[47:39] covenant before the people
[47:41] as they that bear the ark were comed

[47:49] overfloweth all his banks
[47:51] at the time of harvest that the waters
[47:53] which came down from above stood and
[47:55] rose up upon a heap
[47:57] very far from the city adam that is
[48:01] beside zaraten and those that came down
[48:04] toward the sea of the plain even the
[48:05] salt sea
[48:06] fell and were cut off and the people
[48:08] passed right
[48:09] against over right against jordan and
[48:12] the priests
[48:13] that bear the ark of the covenant of the
[48:14] lord stood firm
[48:16] on the dry ground in the midst of the
[48:18] jordan and all
[48:20] the israelites passed over on dry ground
[48:23] until all the people
[48:24] were passed clean over jordan amen we'll
[48:28] let you be seated
[48:30] just like to continue a little bit on
[48:32] the thought of step
[48:34] into the waters you know i had the
[48:37] a privilege of being at this very place
[48:41] as far as as man has been determined
[48:44] of the crossing of the jordan river and
[48:47] today it's not a
[48:49] what you would consider even maybe
[48:50] looking looking at it didn't look like
[48:52] much of a river
[48:54] it was actually uh it was deep in some
[48:56] parts but it wasn't very wide
[48:58] but you know today it's controlled by
[49:01] man-made devices and
[49:03] and with dams and different things that
[49:06] controls its flow
[49:08] but you know looking at this river is
[49:11] actually one of
[49:11] it was one of the fastest flowing rivers
[49:14] of its size
[49:16] i looked a little bit of history on this
[49:18] river as a prominent
[49:19] it was a prominent feature in ancient
[49:21] israel the jordan river
[49:23] was mentioned you know almost 200 times
[49:25] in the bible
[49:27] it's fast flowing waters created a
[49:29] natural barrier
[49:30] between the canaan between canaan and
[49:33] the lands to the east
[49:35] and at times it also served as a line of
[49:37] protection
[49:38] when god's prophets or god's kings were
[49:40] being pursued
[49:42] but it begins this river begins at the
[49:44] mount hermon as the jordan travels
[49:47] about 25 miles from that mountain and it
[49:49] would empty into the sea of galilee and
[49:51] then it goes from the sea of galilee
[49:54] all the way down to the southern end
[49:57] and goes about 65 miles on down to the
[49:59] dead sea
[50:01] and it's you know this river is
[50:03] surprisingly narrow many places you know
[50:05] 50 to 75
[50:07] feet wide in most places but you know
[50:10] the jordan name was derived from the
[50:13] words meaning to descend or go down the
[50:15] river
[50:16] actually significantly drops in
[50:18] elevation because
[50:20] mount hermon stands nine hundred nine
[50:22] thousand feet above the sea level
[50:24] while the dead sea sits 1400 feet below
[50:27] sea level
[50:28] so as it comes from a very high point to
[50:30] a very low point
[50:31] it's a very fast flowing river so it
[50:34] would help you understand the danger of
[50:36] this river and also in that day
[50:38] it was not controlled no doubt by
[50:40] man-made devices of dams and
[50:42] and locks and different things that
[50:44] would help control the flow of it
[50:46] and so in that time it was a very
[50:48] dangerous thing to even cross
[50:49] at the best of times amen and as we read
[50:53] in our scripture we they were to go
[50:54] across at seemingly
[50:56] the worst of times in the in the flood
[50:58] as it would come about
[51:00] at the time of the cross and there would
[51:01] be a flood in the harvest time
[51:04] you know and in many many ancient
[51:06] cultures rivers are thought to be
[51:08] sacred you know but the israelites
[51:10] didn't look at this necessarily as a
[51:12] sacred thing they looked at the jordan
[51:14] river
[51:14] as a barrier something that had to be
[51:17] crossed before they could move forward
[51:19] in their calling
[51:20] you know many ancient people you know
[51:22] would consider their their rivers uh you
[51:24] know to be sacred
[51:26] you know the the people of india they
[51:28] revere the uh
[51:30] genghis river uh they the egyptians they
[51:32] revered the nile river
[51:34] you know they made it to be a god to
[51:35] where they would worship and even the
[51:37] pagans that lived in
[51:39] in canaan would look at the jordan river
[51:41] as a god the jordan river symbolizes a
[51:43] power
[51:44] or a protection for them amen from their
[51:47] enemies it was also a power of fertility
[51:49] because rivers you know they give
[51:51] fertility to the land
[51:52] to bring forth fruits and different
[51:54] things and so they would begin to
[51:56] actually worship this god
[51:58] this god of the river but you know the
[52:00] israelites they didn't worship the
[52:02] jordan river they saw it as a barrier
[52:04] to be overcome and they would look from
[52:07] the other side of jordan over
[52:09] the jordan river to the other side there
[52:11] and on the other side was their promised
[52:13] land that had been promised them
[52:15] some 400 years before and here they're
[52:18] right here as
[52:18] they've been wandering even 40 years in
[52:20] the desert in the desert because of the
[52:23] others
[52:23] that refused to go in no doubt there was
[52:25] a great longing in their heart to cross
[52:28] over here
[52:28] but there was a seemingly a great
[52:30] obstacle in their path and it seemed
[52:33] impossible you know it seemed like it
[52:35] was at an impossible time and
[52:37] and this river was out of its bank so we
[52:39] would read here
[52:40] and you know and no doubt the the
[52:42] canaanites felt very comfortable that
[52:44] what an opportunity what a time
[52:46] this was that that the israel would try
[52:49] to cross but yet
[52:50] now it's flooding now it seems
[52:52] impossible to cross and no doubt the
[52:54] canaanites thought their god was
[52:55] protecting them during this time
[52:57] no doubt they thought that their god
[52:59] baal had been had come on their behalf
[53:01] and
[53:02] raised up the waters and caused floods
[53:04] to come to where the israelites could
[53:06] not cross over
[53:07] but what they did not realize is their
[53:09] bug their god
[53:10] baal was not as powerful as the living
[53:13] god that was among
[53:14] the israel amen and they did not realize
[53:16] how powerful that this god really was
[53:19] you know here they were amen please you
[53:22] know doubt no doubt by the timing they
[53:24] had heard about the israel's victories
[53:26] but they thought here our god has raised
[53:28] up a protection for us
[53:30] he's flooded the waters and is going to
[53:32] keep us from the israelites invasion
[53:34] but here israel had come to a monumental
[53:37] moment
[53:38] there was to either trust in god's power
[53:41] and step into a very dangerous river or
[53:44] they could disobey god's commands
[53:46] and go back into the desert in their
[53:48] fear
[53:49] amen god had brought them to a time of
[53:52] decision they had to make a decision
[53:55] am i going to go on with god or i'm
[53:57] going to go back in fear they'd already
[53:58] went back in fear and
[54:00] thousands of them died in the wilderness
[54:02] but here they had their own choice
[54:04] amen god gives every person their own
[54:06] choice amen a choice whether you're
[54:09] going to go on with
[54:10] god even though it may look impossible
[54:12] even though it may look insurmountable
[54:14] even though it may seem like god that
[54:16] god's against you or
[54:17] you know seemingly the devil has done
[54:19] more and he's done more he's more
[54:20] powerful than god and
[54:22] he's raised up things more but god is
[54:24] asking us to step out in faith
[54:27] amen when he bring when the devil brings
[54:29] cancer god
[54:30] is asking for you to step out in faith
[54:33] to believe the word of god no matter how
[54:35] insurmountable it may seem how
[54:37] impossible it may seem and you
[54:38] have to have been you will be brought to
[54:41] a time of decision
[54:42] amen and we are also a people in this
[54:45] age that we're living in
[54:46] when it seems like the world and it is
[54:48] getting worse and worse on every hand
[54:50] amen the demons have been released into
[54:53] this age and
[54:54] spirits on every kind and you can see it
[54:56] infiltrating
[54:57] amen to every government realm and to
[54:59] ever almost into every human
[55:02] amen thinking and to where their
[55:03] thoughts are on evil continually and it
[55:06] seems like the worst possible time for a
[55:08] rapture
[55:09] it seems like the worst possible time
[55:11] that god could come into this realm
[55:13] and snatch a body bodies out and take
[55:15] them into another dimension
[55:17] but god has got a people that say come
[55:19] to a time of decision
[55:21] you're either going to trust god or
[55:23] you're going to go back in fear
[55:25] amen but i believe there is a people
[55:27] upon this earth just like there was
[55:29] there amen that says yea though god slay
[55:31] me i'm going to trust him
[55:33] i'm going to go on into the into the
[55:35] power of god i'm going to go on into the
[55:37] holy ghost
[55:38] i'm going to go on unto the signs and
[55:40] wonders i'm going to go where god
[55:42] leads amen he may lead through the
[55:44] valleys he may lead to the mountains
[55:46] he may lead to the mountains or through
[55:48] the rivers but he said though the
[55:50] waters may come against you they'll not
[55:51] overflow you
[55:53] the fire won't burn you because i'll be
[55:55] with you
[55:56] even in you to the end of the world so
[55:58] he's looking for a people that'll go on
[56:00] with him
[56:01] amen that made their decision we're not
[56:04] going back
[56:06] hallelujah what's there to go back to
[56:08] there's nothing to go back to but death
[56:10] and dying
[56:11] and deserts amen the deserts of when
[56:14] there wasn't no spirit of god
[56:16] that could be moved and moving in the
[56:18] church we're not going back to that
[56:20] we're going on with jesus
[56:23] amen but it takes a trusting in him amen
[56:26] the priest
[56:27] a priest that would take the first steps
[56:29] into the jordan
[56:31] and immediately when they stepped into
[56:33] the river i mean the water stopped so
[56:35] they could pass through
[56:36] on dry ground and no doubt you know the
[56:39] pagans that had trusted in baal
[56:41] were stunned amen
[56:44] we're stunned at the power of god
[56:47] amen we're coming to a time that demons
[56:50] are going to be stunned
[56:52] people unbelievers are going to be
[56:54] stunned amen when they see the power
[56:56] that god has in the body called christ
[56:59] the bride of jesus christ
[57:01] living upon the earth he's going to be i
[57:03] mean his mouth is about to fall open
[57:08] you know we found that it was at the
[57:10] same cross at this same crossing
[57:12] amen of the jordan river is also where
[57:15] elijah would take the mantle
[57:16] and he would smite the water and it
[57:19] would open
[57:21] you know elijah seeing elijah you know
[57:23] and seeing god demonstrate so very
[57:26] powerfully in elijah's ministry amen he
[57:29] elijah would ask him what request he
[57:31] would have before he was to go and he
[57:33] said
[57:33] i want a double portion and he said you
[57:35] asked a hard thing he said but
[57:37] if you see me going up amen then then
[57:40] you can have what you asked for
[57:42] and we know that elijah as he came to
[57:44] that moment amen that chariot of fire
[57:46] swept down
[57:47] and picked him up and elijah's elisha
[57:49] saw him
[57:50] go up into the heavens and that man will
[57:52] come falling down and
[57:54] elisha grabbed that mantle and he took
[57:56] it to that same
[57:57] jordan river amen and he smote the same
[57:59] as elijah did and he said now where
[58:02] is the god of elijah if he's still the
[58:06] same today
[58:07] as he once did he has to show me himself
[58:10] to say
[58:11] amen and there's a people amen that the
[58:14] holy ghost has fell upon
[58:16] and they're calling for that same god of
[58:18] elijah
[58:19] i mean that same god that opened this
[58:22] red sea
[58:22] that same god that opened the jordan
[58:25] river that same
[58:26] god of the of elijah that would heal the
[58:28] blind and heal the lepers and heal the
[58:31] lame
[58:32] and raise them up out of wheelchairs
[58:34] amen there's a people here with the same
[58:36] holy ghost
[58:37] and saying where is that same god
[58:41] because if he is the same god he's the
[58:44] same god tonight
[58:45] as he was 50 years ago
[58:48] hallelujah i'm not serving a dead god
[58:51] i'm serving a god that's alive
[58:53] but it takes a people under the same
[58:55] anointing that'll grab that man of the
[58:58] holy ghost
[58:59] and walk down to the river and say where
[59:01] is the god of elijah
[59:05] hallelujah i believe we're at the same
[59:07] way at that moment
[59:09] amen where our people are under the same
[59:11] anointing as elijah was
[59:13] under the same god as elijah was
[59:16] [Applause]
[59:17] the same yesterday to tell him forever
[59:19] and we're saying if he healed cancer
[59:21] then
[59:21] he'll heal it now if you open the eyes
[59:24] of the blind then
[59:25] he'll open him now if he raised him up
[59:28] out of wheelchairs then
[59:29] he'll do it now and be filled with the
[59:32] holy ghost there
[59:33] he'll do it now where is the god of
[59:36] elijah
[59:38] where's the god i want him to be not
[59:40] elijah's god
[59:41] i want him to be my god i wanted to show
[59:44] himself to me
[59:46] to save all hallelujah the same
[59:48] yesterday

[1:00:03] the same yesterday
[1:00:08] hallelujah he's bringing you to the same
[1:00:12] place
[1:00:15] and he's asking you to step out in faith
[1:00:18] [Applause]
[1:00:19] hallelujah he was also
[1:00:22] at this same place jesus was baptized
[1:00:28] hallelujah and he would step into those
[1:00:31] waters
[1:00:32] and the world would never be the same
[1:00:34] again
[1:00:36] because when he stepped into those
[1:00:38] waters and he was baptized in that water
[1:00:41] he came out of there and there was a
[1:00:43] dove that came out of heaven
[1:00:45] the holy spirit what was it symbolizing
[1:00:47] that god
[1:00:48] and man are together again
[1:00:52] hallelujah and you have the right to
[1:00:54] come to the same place
[1:00:56] but you have to step in the water and
[1:00:58] die out to your thoughts
[1:00:59] down to your unbelief die out to all the
[1:01:02] things that you thought
[1:01:03] you were your pride and your arrogance
[1:01:05] and all that stuff leave it all behind
[1:01:07] and say god bear me in the waters
[1:01:10] [Applause]
[1:01:14] hallelujah you have to be baptized with
[1:01:17] the same baptism he was baptized with
[1:01:20] at the same place i'm not talking about
[1:01:23] now a physical place
[1:01:25] i'm talking about the same place the
[1:01:27] same spot
[1:01:28] in christ
[1:01:31] hallelujah who am i
[1:01:34] why can't we just have that tonight
[1:01:38] just have a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:41] amen i'm looking for him to come all the
[1:01:44] way from this wall all the way to the
[1:01:46] back wall
[1:01:47] not leave a person behind but say god
[1:01:49] how many were here tonight say lord
[1:01:51] i want to fall in those same waters i
[1:01:54] want to step in that same water
[1:01:56] i don't want to be back there in my
[1:01:58] unbelief and back there in my pride
[1:02:00] and back there in my arrogance but i
[1:02:02] want to lay it all down
[1:02:07] hallelujah this is what he said in mark
[1:02:10] 1 and verse 1 the beginning
[1:02:12] of the gospel of jesus christ the son of
[1:02:15] god
[1:02:16] as it is written in the prophets behold
[1:02:18] i send my messenger before thy face
[1:02:20] which shall prepare that way before thee
[1:02:22] the voice of one crying in the
[1:02:24] wilderness
[1:02:25] prepare the way of the lord make his
[1:02:26] path straight
[1:02:28] john did baptize where in the wilderness
[1:02:32] and preached the baptism of repentance
[1:02:34] for the remission of sins
[1:02:36] and there went out unto him all the land
[1:02:38] of judea
[1:02:39] and they of jerusalem and all were all
[1:02:41] baptized of him in the river
[1:02:43] of jordan confessing their sins and john
[1:02:46] was clothed with camel's hair
[1:02:48] and with a girdle and a skin about his
[1:02:50] loins and he didn't eat locusts and wild
[1:02:52] honey
[1:02:53] and preached saying there cometh one
[1:02:55] mightier than i am
[1:02:56] and then i after me the latchette of
[1:02:59] whose shoes
[1:03:00] i'm not worthy to stoop down and unloose
[1:03:02] i indeed haven't baptized you with water
[1:03:04] but he shall baptize you with the holy
[1:03:07] ghost
[1:03:08] and it came to pass in those days that
[1:03:10] jesus came from nazareth to galilee
[1:03:12] and was baptized of john and the jordan
[1:03:15] and straightway
[1:03:16] coming up out of the water he saw the
[1:03:18] heavens open
[1:03:20] and the spirit like a dove descended
[1:03:22] upon him
[1:03:23] and there came a voice from heaven
[1:03:25] saying thou art my beloved son
[1:03:27] and whom i am well pleased
[1:03:30] what happened here the priest stepped
[1:03:32] into the water
[1:03:35] just like they did on the jordan river
[1:03:37] amen some thousand years before
[1:03:39] bringing the ark of the covenant down
[1:03:41] and they step into the water
[1:03:43] and the barrier that kept them out of
[1:03:45] the promised land
[1:03:46] was now done away with
[1:03:49] hallelujah and when he came down into
[1:03:52] the water
[1:03:52] and was baptized the barrier that would
[1:03:55] keep you from health
[1:03:56] has been done away with
[1:04:00] hallelujah young person i'm here to tell
[1:04:02] you there's nothing that separates you
[1:04:04] from the holy ghost
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:09] hallelujah folks there's nothing to
[1:04:11] separate you
[1:04:12] amen there is one baptism but there's
[1:04:14] many refillings
[1:04:16] if i was you would ask god refill my cup
[1:04:19] again
[1:04:22] hallelujah jesus stepped into the water
[1:04:27] and it made a way for man to come to god
[1:04:31] that we could still then we could that
[1:04:33] we could also step
[1:04:35] into the water and die out to ourselves
[1:04:38] that god and man could be joined again
[1:04:40] and again he came to conquer
[1:04:42] every barrier
[1:04:46] hallelujah between god and man
[1:04:50] to reconcile you back to god again
[1:04:56] what do you do with the woman at the
[1:04:57] well
[1:04:59] it's a very wonderful story
[1:05:02] she had a lot of barriers
[1:05:06] she had rejection that's a big barrier
[1:05:09] to get past
[1:05:10] that's right young people have a hard
[1:05:12] time getting past rejection
[1:05:14] we all want to be accepted and sometimes
[1:05:16] you know even our own mamas and own
[1:05:18] daddies don't even
[1:05:19] receive us we get rejected and it causes
[1:05:22] a scar there
[1:05:23] and it cause a barrier amen in the past
[1:05:26] she had a big past
[1:05:29] wasn't a good past either it's a bad
[1:05:31] past but now she's been visiting she's
[1:05:34] meeting the present that can do away
[1:05:36] with the past
[1:05:38] that's right that's right hallelujah
[1:05:40] what was it he was wanting to take her
[1:05:42] from the surface
[1:05:43] to the depths
[1:05:46] amen like like we know in the scriptures
[1:05:48] of the uh they're in the
[1:05:50] old testament of the of the prophet
[1:05:52] looking at waters coming out from under
[1:05:53] the throne
[1:05:54] amen he said what was it it was a waters
[1:05:56] to up the ankle deep and he said i need
[1:05:58] you to move on out a little deeper
[1:06:00] it was knee-deep and hip deep and all
[1:06:02] the way out and he said until there was
[1:06:04] waters to swim
[1:06:05] in see god is not just wanting you to
[1:06:07] just be a christian
[1:06:10] well there's a confession i'm a
[1:06:11] christian he wants you to move a little
[1:06:13] deeper than that
[1:06:14] if that's all you got that's what the
[1:06:16] woman at the well head with her past
[1:06:18] that's right that's right amen her past
[1:06:21] didn't keep her from i said i'm a
[1:06:22] christian
[1:06:25] that's right come on amen and when jesus
[1:06:27] said
[1:06:28] said look if you if you knew who i was
[1:06:30] or who i am
[1:06:31] you would ask me of a dream what did she
[1:06:34] look at him and she's looking at it like
[1:06:35] with a superficial understanding she's
[1:06:37] looking at him like what do you mean you
[1:06:39] ain't got a water pot
[1:06:40] that's right i know i've used this
[1:06:42] before but you ain't even got a water
[1:06:44] pot
[1:06:45] look what i got you know and she's
[1:06:47] bringing up her crutch and her
[1:06:48] her thoughts and her reasoning and her
[1:06:50] thinking and that was more important not
[1:06:52] realizing what's sitting right before
[1:07:00] said bring me a drink she said what what
[1:07:02] are you talking about the well's deep
[1:07:04] and
[1:07:04] and and you have nothing to draw with if
[1:07:06] you knew who you were talking to
[1:07:08] you would ask for a drink from me
[1:07:14] but it's surface superficial things that
[1:07:16] she's concerned with
[1:07:19] and she goes into religion and and you
[1:07:21] want to take her past the religion
[1:07:26] some of you only got to religion
[1:07:29] he wants you past just a religion
[1:07:33] just a theology or or some uh you know
[1:07:36] buzz words or
[1:07:37] or something that'll just make you how
[1:07:39] he wants us past all of that
[1:07:41] amen he wants you to come to the rivers
[1:07:42] of life
[1:07:46] hallelujah and this is what he was
[1:07:47] trying to get her to understand
[1:07:49] there's more than a water pot sitting
[1:07:51] here
[1:07:52] there's a god of creation sitting right
[1:07:55] in front of you
[1:07:56] the way one that brought you into
[1:07:57] existence
[1:08:02] i don't think we understand sometimes
[1:08:03] who's before us
[1:08:05] in our services who walks among us is
[1:08:08] the very god
[1:08:09] who brought you into existence and he's
[1:08:12] wanting you to get past
[1:08:14] your surface relationship with him he's
[1:08:16] warned you to go
[1:08:17] deeper step into the water go
[1:08:21] deeper into christ don't don't just not
[1:08:23] a bunch of surface relationships
[1:08:25] and i well i got i got this quote and i
[1:08:27] got that over there and i got this
[1:08:29] memory no it's more than that
[1:08:33] amen caught her to step
[1:08:36] into the waters of eternal life the
[1:08:38] waters of eternal life are not just
[1:08:40] ankle-deep
[1:08:43] amen they're not just up to your hips
[1:08:46] let's see it brother madam said it's
[1:08:47] either sink or
[1:08:48] or swim that's what the waters of life
[1:08:52] is amen the waters of eternal life
[1:08:56] you know it's time to leave the past
[1:08:58] behind that's right
[1:09:01] some of you have been dragging your past
[1:09:02] with you all the way but there's
[1:09:04] somebody here to tell you
[1:09:06] leave it behind let the past be the past
[1:09:10] there's a god here to not worry with
[1:09:11] your past he's already paid for it
[1:09:13] he's already done away with it he's put
[1:09:15] in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:09:17] leave it there and look at now your
[1:09:19] present
[1:09:20] future
[1:09:24] amen step into the water
[1:09:29] hey man what was it he was trying to
[1:09:31] talk to her and she was well
[1:09:33] it's not customary for you jews you know
[1:09:35] the very surface
[1:09:36] you're jews oh yeah we asked we women of
[1:09:39] samaria is such a thing and
[1:09:40] the conversation went on until jesus you
[1:09:43] know caught her spirit
[1:09:45] he said go get your husband
[1:09:49] said i don't have a husband that's right
[1:09:51] you got five and the one you're living
[1:09:53] with now is not your husband
[1:09:55] that still didn't get it four
[1:09:59] he was wanting to go deeper because then
[1:10:02] she goes to well
[1:10:03] we know when the messiah cometh he'll
[1:10:04] tell us he's saying but who are you
[1:10:06] right come on you know i i'm not here
[1:10:10] to i guess promote anything but let me
[1:10:12] tell you that chosen series caught some
[1:10:14] things
[1:10:16] this particular one about about the
[1:10:18] woman at the well when jesus started to
[1:10:20] tell her details about her life
[1:10:23] we know he does that because we saw him
[1:10:24] do it in this day
[1:10:27] details of her life and i know all those
[1:10:30] that they come up with probably wasn't
[1:10:31] her
[1:10:32] but whatever it was showing you who he
[1:10:34] was
[1:10:35] that he knows the details of your life
[1:10:38] he knows the ins and outs he knows your
[1:10:40] private closets he knows all about it
[1:10:44] hey man and he begins to tell her who
[1:10:46] she is and
[1:10:47] no doubt did he did he no doubt he told
[1:10:49] her about her first husband and details
[1:10:51] just like you did you lived on this
[1:10:52] street and you married this man
[1:10:54] that goes all the way down her life and
[1:10:56] she realized this is more than a man
[1:10:59] this is more than just a prophet this is
[1:11:01] the messiah
[1:11:03] this is the one that god has promised in
[1:11:06] this generation
[1:11:08] and you can read the scripture and the
[1:11:10] scripture says she left
[1:11:11] her water pots and she ran into the city
[1:11:15] what she thought was important
[1:11:17] at the beginning was no longer important
[1:11:20] why because she had stepped into a
[1:11:21] different kind of water
[1:11:24] it wasn't a water that would quench in
[1:11:26] your thirst for just a moment
[1:11:27] and the next day you're thirsty again
[1:11:29] that's what sin is
[1:11:31] it leaves you thirsty and thirsty and
[1:11:33] more thirsty but there is a water
[1:11:35] that can quench your thirst
[1:11:39] and it'll take you from the surface into
[1:11:41] the depths
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:47] you know it was also at this river
[1:11:50] naaman the leper had to step into the
[1:11:54] water
[1:11:55] and this wasn't the easy thing for him
[1:11:57] to do
[1:11:59] you know he had he had a place
[1:12:03] you know to be a place of honor you know
[1:12:05] he was a
[1:12:06] a captain or a general whatever and but
[1:12:09] here he had something he was hiding
[1:12:11] under clothes and leprosy was eating his
[1:12:14] flesh
[1:12:16] people at his home knew about it but
[1:12:19] he'd go into the king's court as a leper
[1:12:21] hiding it all amen pride had kept him in
[1:12:25] this position
[1:12:29] and here he even finds out about a
[1:12:31] prophet and he hears
[1:12:32] this little servant girl in his house
[1:12:34] telling well there's a prophet in the
[1:12:35] land of israel and
[1:12:36] you go to him he he can tell you what to
[1:12:38] do
[1:12:40] amen man them little girls
[1:12:43] that little girl had more sense and a
[1:12:44] lot of people on this day we're living
[1:12:46] in
[1:12:47] somehow they're trying to do away with
[1:12:49] the message
[1:12:52] the very help that they could receive
[1:12:54] but here he goes and he comes up to the
[1:12:56] prophet and he said well you
[1:12:57] and no doubt he's thinking in his mind
[1:12:59] he's going to maybe say something over
[1:13:00] men
[1:13:01] and then all of a sudden he's going to
[1:13:02] vanish and the prophet says go dip in
[1:13:04] the jordan seven times
[1:13:06] he said what got angry about it
[1:13:10] here i am somebody that a nobleman are
[1:13:13] you going to tell me to get that muddy
[1:13:15] jordan river and bow down and humble
[1:13:18] myself like
[1:13:19] i ain't going to do it sounds like a
[1:13:21] bunch of message people
[1:13:24] they got hidden leprosy in their life
[1:13:26] but they refuse to get in what can cure
[1:13:28] them
[1:13:30] come on somebody there is a god who can
[1:13:33] cure you
[1:13:33] but you got to take the cure
[1:13:40] but there was somebody that must have
[1:13:41] been pretty wise in his his entourage
[1:13:44] and said look
[1:13:45] you need to do what that man said do
[1:13:49] it wasn't just one good good thing to
[1:13:51] dip in at one time he had to go two
[1:13:53] three four five six seven times amen to
[1:13:56] where
[1:13:56] all of a sudden at that seventh deal his
[1:13:59] blow his skin come out all fresh and
[1:14:01] renewed again
[1:14:02] wow but it took the first step
[1:14:06] it took that first step into that jordan
[1:14:08] river forgetting about his pride and his
[1:14:10] arrogance and
[1:14:12] who he was and well i'm the
[1:14:15] god's wanting us to shave all that off
[1:14:17] of us
[1:14:21] amen
[1:14:24] you know and jesus says we'll go back to
[1:14:26] him for a moment jesus
[1:14:29] with a ministry that moved that moved
[1:14:32] that area and that work
[1:14:33] and he said he went down the brother
[1:14:35] brown talks about him going down the
[1:14:36] jordan he said
[1:14:37] and that that spirit fell upon him he
[1:14:40] said it's now
[1:14:40] upon another people but they had to take
[1:14:43] a step
[1:14:44] to get into that place they had to move
[1:14:47] in that place into the spirit
[1:14:49] until god could anoint them god could
[1:14:51] baptize them with the holy ghost so god
[1:14:54] could change their lives amen that's
[1:14:57] what he wants to do
[1:14:58] he wants to do more than just crown you
[1:15:00] with a religion
[1:15:01] or clown crown you with some kind of
[1:15:03] head knowledge he wants more than that
[1:15:06] he wants to baptize you with his spirit
[1:15:09] that's why the church of the living god
[1:15:11] never never never needs to get away
[1:15:14] from the movement of the holy ghost from
[1:15:16] the baptism of the holy ghost preaching
[1:15:18] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:20] why that's what it takes
[1:15:27] when you have that the works he said the
[1:15:28] works that i do shall you do also
[1:15:32] listen what he said it is going away he
[1:15:33] said lo a little while the world
[1:15:36] the visible the intellectual the culture
[1:15:38] the scientific
[1:15:39] the world will see me no more
[1:15:42] but you will see me for i'll be with you
[1:15:46] even in you
[1:15:48] and the works that i've done you shall
[1:15:49] do also and more than this shall you do
[1:15:52] for i go to my father oh my he's a good
[1:15:56] great god of heaven we're talking about
[1:15:59] it's not something that he was it's
[1:16:01] something that he
[1:16:02] is where is the god of elijah
[1:16:06] it's something that he is and he said of
[1:16:09] his people
[1:16:10] who are called by his name
[1:16:13] uh who's that who who heard your name
[1:16:15] called right there and his people who
[1:16:17] are
[1:16:17] called by his name will get past the
[1:16:20] barrier
[1:16:22] there's a barrier here of what the
[1:16:24] world's got to say
[1:16:26] or what the church has got to say or
[1:16:29] what science has got to say
[1:16:30] it's put there as a barrier but if
[1:16:32] you'll get past that
[1:16:34] and look at what god has said
[1:16:37] amen in a minute if you'll continue to
[1:16:39] look in that direction
[1:16:41] and keep your eyes upon it you'll pass
[1:16:44] that vibration of unbelief and you'll go
[1:16:46] free
[1:16:47] and you'll go out of this building
[1:16:49] tonight as happy as you can be
[1:16:51] serving god free sins all gone
[1:16:54] healed from all your sickness
[1:16:56] [Applause]
[1:17:00] what a power there is in this word amen
[1:17:03] if you can get past the barrier
[1:17:05] of unbelief the barrier of what the
[1:17:09] world has said or
[1:17:10] what critics are saying or what this
[1:17:12] will get passed at all
[1:17:14] tune it all out
[1:17:18] he said boy it'd be wonderful we have a
[1:17:20] wonderful time if we can get past that
[1:17:24] and he said listen and when you do he
[1:17:26] said god would not be a god of justice
[1:17:29] who would reward one person of their
[1:17:30] faith and disreward another he can't do
[1:17:33] it
[1:17:33] and he goes into some things let me read
[1:17:35] these for a moment he said if god took
[1:17:37] the leukemia out of that girl when she
[1:17:39] was laying yonder
[1:17:40] one of the best hospitals john hopkins
[1:17:42] that she could have been in
[1:17:44] and her limbs were falling off from her
[1:17:46] and but in one hour after prayer
[1:17:49] the child was pronounced sound and well
[1:17:52] by the same doctors
[1:17:53] god can't be just he said congressman
[1:17:56] nutshall
[1:17:57] who's been in a wheelchair for 66 years
[1:18:00] broken his back
[1:18:01] walks now like mr roosevelt would and
[1:18:04] we would heal that man and bring him out
[1:18:06] of that chair by
[1:18:07] vision and if another man set the same
[1:18:09] way and met the same faith
[1:18:12] god would be unjust to heal one and
[1:18:14] leave the other one alone
[1:18:16] but he is just he said it is us
[1:18:19] friend did you hear me
[1:18:22] it is us friend if we can move past that
[1:18:26] barrier if we can get to a place
[1:18:29] where it don't make any difference who
[1:18:31] says it as long as god
[1:18:33] sells it says it's the truth sail on
[1:18:38] as long as it's written in his word
[1:18:40] stand on it and believe
[1:18:43] god will bring it to pass
[1:18:48] i love this he said i thought about a
[1:18:50] little poem in one of my school books
[1:18:53] i was a little boy many of you men and
[1:18:54] women my age maybe remember
[1:18:56] sell on sell on is that when christopher
[1:18:59] columbus was given ships by the queen of
[1:19:00] spain
[1:19:01] because in his heart he saw a vision
[1:19:04] oh my of another world
[1:19:09] you know it was men that was expressing
[1:19:11] their doubts and unbelief
[1:19:13] that you know that the world is square
[1:19:16] and you're going to go so far and you're
[1:19:18] just going to fall off the edge of it
[1:19:22] and there's doubting him and saying it
[1:19:24] ain't possible and
[1:19:26] it's it but he had caught another vision
[1:19:30] did you hear me and i'm looking today at
[1:19:33] another people
[1:19:34] who's caught a vision of another world
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:38] and people are expressing their doubts
[1:19:40] and and the rivers getting flooded more
[1:19:42] and more with the demons on every hand
[1:19:44] and spirits are rising up everywhere it
[1:19:46] says that ain't possible no more
[1:19:48] spirits even raising up in the message
[1:19:50] saying mercy's over
[1:19:51] and saying there ain't no holy ghost no
[1:19:53] more and saying all kinds of stuff
[1:19:57] nonsense
[1:20:00] but there's a people that's heard the
[1:20:02] word
[1:20:03] they've heard the cry of another land
[1:20:06] they saw it now by vision that that's
[1:20:09] been given to them by elijah prophet
[1:20:11] that's went to that place and said hey
[1:20:13] it's a good land
[1:20:16] it's a land flowing with milky honey you
[1:20:18] know in that land there ain't no sorrow
[1:20:20] there ain't no sin there ain't no
[1:20:22] worries there ain't no threatening
[1:20:24] amen and what is it has done something
[1:20:26] to my heart
[1:20:27] i can't help but believe it i want to go
[1:20:29] there
[1:20:30] and i believe if i want to go there god
[1:20:33] has made me a way to get there
[1:20:36] he has provided the power to get me from
[1:20:39] here
[1:20:39] over to there i just got to step out in
[1:20:43] faith
[1:20:43] no different than christopher columbus
[1:20:45] as he jumped on that boat it took a step
[1:20:49] and he goes settling across the ocean
[1:20:53] he said here he was
[1:20:56] given some ships with a bunch of
[1:20:58] prisoners and cowards
[1:21:01] that was his church members
[1:21:05] oh my bunch of pullbacks

[1:21:27] lives oh let's pull back on this

[1:21:37] songs that they would sing the devil

[1:21:40] we don't sing because the devil don't
[1:21:42] like us singing we don't shout because
[1:21:44] the devil don't like us shouting
[1:21:46] we don't praise god because the devil
[1:21:47] don't like us you know that a different
[1:21:49] verse
[1:21:52] but we got a verse we don't care what
[1:21:53] the devil don't like
[1:21:59] we don't care what critics don't like
[1:22:02] we don't care what unbelievers don't
[1:22:04] like
[1:22:06] amen i've been called to another land
[1:22:09] there's
[1:22:09] something pulling me there's something
[1:22:11] drawing me and i'm not going to be one
[1:22:13] that pulls back

[1:22:17] and say god
[1:22:18] i want more of you to fall amongst us i
[1:22:21] want more of that atmosphere
[1:22:23] i want more of the power of the holy
[1:22:24] ghost to fall in our services
[1:22:27] to give me a greater desire to leave
[1:22:29] here to go there

[1:31:21] i'm going on with the law
[1:31:25] hallelujah amen it was four lepers
[1:31:29] that set it again in a time of famine
[1:31:31] and the enemy had surround them on every
[1:31:33] side
[1:31:34] but something began to stir in their
[1:31:35] hearts and said hey

[1:31:39] here we're gonna die
[1:31:40] we might as well go out there into that

[1:32:03] anointing
[1:32:04] amen and anointed picked it up to such a
[1:32:07] place where the enemy
[1:32:08] out there heard them coming they said
[1:32:11] wow they
[1:32:12] got a big multitude that's headed our
[1:32:13] way and the fear began to come on them
[1:32:16] and
[1:32:16] all kinds of things began to happen
[1:32:18] until they fled
[1:32:20] from what four lepers
[1:32:25] yeah but it was the unseen force
[1:32:29] [Laughter]
[1:32:31] some of you need to ask that same
[1:32:32] question why am i going to sit here till
[1:32:35] i die

[1:32:39] set there and when god told them to go
[1:32:41] on in
[1:32:42] they'd have died just like their
[1:32:43] forefathers did that's right
[1:32:48] all it takes is one moving in the right
[1:32:49] direction
[1:32:52] amen that's why you would say one or two
[1:32:55] hearts on fire for god
[1:32:57] will do more for a church than 40
[1:32:58] revivals
[1:33:01] what do you what is it one or two hearts
[1:33:03] moving in the right direction
[1:33:05] stepping into the water may make them
[1:33:07] look foolish
[1:33:08] make them look like they're foolish for
[1:33:09] a while but they know god's done
[1:33:11] something for them
[1:33:13] and when you know something god god's
[1:33:14] done something for you you could care
[1:33:16] less what the world says

[1:33:20] says what anybody says
[1:33:21] you know what god's done for you you

[1:33:47] behalf
[1:33:48] and it changed my whole life
[1:33:51] and i'm not who i used to be
[1:33:55] all of a sudden it starts a little
[1:33:57] vibration something begins to happen
[1:33:58] and the devil's like oh wait wait wait
[1:34:00] wait wait a minute

[1:34:27] about what hell thinks
[1:34:29] there needs to be a group of people in
[1:34:30] this building that could care less
[1:34:32] what the game will ever say about them
[1:34:35] because i'm free

[1:34:58] or enough people amen has heard the
[1:35:00] voice of god
[1:35:01] that way they begin to break away from
[1:35:03] the vibrations and the little funny
[1:35:05] feelings that they felt coming to church
[1:35:07] and they lay them all aside and they
[1:35:09] said you know what tonight i'm getting
