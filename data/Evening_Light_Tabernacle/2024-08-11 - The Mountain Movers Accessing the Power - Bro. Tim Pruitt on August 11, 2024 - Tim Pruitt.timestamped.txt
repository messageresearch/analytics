[46:12] Sunday morning to enjoy it would be a
[46:15] great day that the dead in Christ rise
[46:19] they will come in that theophonic form
[46:21] and they will meet with the body and
[46:24] resurrected and glorify
[46:27] and then we who are alive and remain

[50:15] of thoughts and things that I've jotted
[50:18] down as we feel to go a certain
[50:20] direction today but Lord I pray that you
[50:23] would now anoint it and take those
[50:27] fragments Lord that would be just
[50:30] scattered thoughts and put it together
[50:32] as a concise message Lord that you would
[50:36] form the
[50:37] words I I remember in the scripture that
[50:41] you said when we stand before men that
[50:44] we were not to even think about what we
[50:46] were going to say or how we were going
[50:48] to say it but it would be the Holy
[50:50] Spirit speaking through us but Lord we
[50:54] have fed ourselves on the word we have
[50:57] taken on the things of of the word we've

[51:23] God bless you thank amen isn't it good
[51:25] to be together
[51:27] amen certainly Grand to be a Christian
[51:29] and have this privilege of serving the
[51:32] lord together this morning and uh you
[51:36] know we are a little bit smaller in
[51:38] number but we're here Jesus is here amen
[51:42] I started out preaching to 12 so you
[51:45] know you're a few more than 12 this
[51:47] morning and um so you know we uh we we
[51:51] know what it is to speak to small crowds
[51:53] middle middle-sized crowds big crowds
[51:57] doesn't matter what it is it's all the
[51:59] same it's God's people and it's our
[52:02] responsibility to be here now we just
[52:05] want to just enter in with all that we
[52:07] have today and surrender ourselves to
[52:10] the Lord and and um look into him John
[52:15] 14:12 for our scripture reading this
[52:17] morning John
[52:20] 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he
[52:24] that believeth on me the works that I do
[52:26] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[52:30] these shall he do because I go to my
[52:33] father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my
[52:36] name that I will I do that the father
[52:40] may be glorified in the son and if you
[52:43] ask anything in my name I will do it
[52:48] amen God bless you you can be
[52:51] seated today we're going to be speaking
[52:53] on the mountain movers the accessing the
[52:56] power and I've just been feeling in the
[53:00] the last few days knowing that we're
[53:03] here in and and fulfilling end time
[53:07] prophecy to and knowing that we must
[53:10] have um a Rapture in faith in this day
[53:13] of a faith that will be elevated to
[53:17] believe God's promise for the
[53:20] impossible and so knowing all of that is
[53:23] um uh laying before us I'm just been
[53:26] speaking here about faith and brother
[53:30] Timothy is coming back right behind me
[53:32] and or I'm right ahead of him or he's
[53:35] behind him somehow together we're
[53:37] working in sync together as he's been
[53:39] speaking on faith as well and so we're
[53:43] going today speak about accessing the
[53:47] power now as we're looking at this we
[53:51] see in our scripture reading that Jesus
[53:54] is telling his disciples
[53:57] that he is leaving and he's leaving this
[54:01] world's Dimension and he's going back to
[54:04] to God he's leaving the human form and
[54:07] he's actually going to go back into the
[54:10] God form again and it's not that he
[54:13] wasn't God but he it was God but it was
[54:16] God now working and dwelling in a human
[54:19] vessel as Jesus said it's not me that
[54:22] doeth the works but it's my father that
[54:24] dwelleth in me that doeth the works so
[54:29] again uh again we we have these words of
[54:33] Jesus telling them I'm going to go away
[54:37] and that True Believers will continue
[54:40] his works and they will also even do
[54:44] more than that but do Greater
[54:46] Works and and using the authority that
[54:50] Jesus will give them by acting in his
[54:53] name that the believer will act ask and
[54:57] he by asking will do God will do his
[55:00] Works through them they will work the
[55:03] work of God because the spirit of God
[55:06] will dwell in them now Jesus was God
[55:10] manifested In the Flesh amen now of
[55:14] course he was he was human for the sake
[55:17] of Dying God made a body for himself to
[55:19] dwell in but he was God Amen he was more
[55:24] than a man and so the the Holy Spirit uh
[55:28] overshadowed a virgin and and then that
[55:32] blood cell wrapped himself uh the spirit
[55:36] of God wrapped himself around a blood
[55:39] cell and and and of course the the blood
[55:43] cell of our Lord Jesus then would Veil
[55:46] the life of Jehovah the man Christ Jesus
[55:49] his body would become the temple or the
[55:54] dwelling place of Almighty God now
[55:57] difference between you and me and him is
[56:01] is because he he was the fullness of God
[56:04] in the body and we have a portion of God
[56:08] the Holy Spirit within us but remember
[56:11] even a portion of God is
[56:13] omnipotent so in there is is all power
[56:18] and together together we make up the
[56:21] body of Christ now in the beginning was
[56:24] the word or it was the logo cross the
[56:27] eternal spirit and and he made himself
[56:30] flesh if you go back to uh John's
[56:34] writing of the beginning and you know he
[56:37] doesn't do it like in the Book of
[56:38] Genesis in the beginning God created a
[56:40] Heavens Earth no he starts way back
[56:42] before that and said in the beginning
[56:44] was the word and so he goes Way Beyond
[56:48] you know just a creation of the world to
[56:51] where it was the logos the word and then
[56:55] that word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[56:58] Us now so you see everything in other
[57:02] words that God was in the pillar of fire
[57:06] he emptied into the son Jesus Christ and
[57:09] in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[57:13] bodily you see God said that God himself
[57:17] Jehovah the mighty one the buckler
[57:19] Jehovah jyra Jehovah Rafa all of his
[57:22] descriptive names of himself El shedi
[57:26] all of his Redemptive names everything
[57:28] that he was he emptied into Jesus Christ
[57:33] for the fullness of God dwelt in him and
[57:37] God in other words he made himself
[57:40] little coming down and got into a teeny
[57:44] blood cell and then begin to build
[57:47] something around him so God through his
[57:52] condescension from God to man he did
[57:55] this in order to have many sons he would
[57:58] come and condescend himself and WRA
[58:01] himself in a blood cell God would become
[58:04] a human and doing so God would father a
[58:10] body in other words he would he would
[58:13] actually through creation make a body
[58:17] for him to dwell in and thus become a
[58:19] son and that through the creation of a
[58:23] germ life in the womb of Mary
[58:26] and in her you know the cells would
[58:30] multiply around that from the food that
[58:32] she ate and flesh made of the earth
[58:35] wrapped itself around the blood cell of
[58:37] life and remember he does this for the
[58:40] purpose of DME because and for paying
[58:43] for the price of sin because as God the
[58:46] Eternal Spirit he cannot die so he takes
[58:50] on a body that he can give it up to
[58:54] death now we know The Germ of Life comes
[58:57] from the male and when God condescended
[59:00] and overshadowed Mary he created a blood
[59:04] cell to wrap around that life then at
[59:09] Calvary when the spear pierced his side
[59:13] and his life's blood was poured out he
[59:16] brought forth from him the elements that
[59:19] he would need to make a bride now this
[59:23] was foreshadowed many many many years
[59:26] ago before you know that's prophesied in
[59:29] Adam when God put Adam to sleep and from
[59:33] Adam side he took a rib and from that he
[59:38] made a woman so God did the same thing
[59:41] at Calvary with the second Adam you see
[59:44] as Jesus went to sleep in death that
[59:47] from his body came the elements to make
[59:50] up a bride so there were three things
[59:53] that came for from him at Calvary and
[59:57] that was water blood and spirit in John
[1:00:01] 19:34 the Bible said that when one of
[1:00:04] the so Soldiers with a spar um pierced
[1:00:07] his side forth with came out blood and
[1:00:11] water then in Luke chap
[1:00:14] 23:46 he said and when Jesus had cried
[1:00:17] with a loud voice he said father into
[1:00:19] thy hands I Comm in my spirit and thus
[1:00:21] he gave up the ghost so there were three
[1:00:24] things that came forth from from him
[1:00:27] which was water and blood and spirit
[1:00:30] these are the elements that make up the
[1:00:34] new birth are the elements that make up
[1:00:37] a bride and God did this just as he did
[1:00:42] in Eden when he put Adam to sleep took
[1:00:45] forth from him elements to make himself
[1:00:48] a bride he did the same thing at Calvary
[1:00:52] and and he took from Christ from the
[1:00:54] body of Christ the elements to make for
[1:00:58] his wife the bride of Christ and in
[1:01:00] doing so you see he rebirthed us who was
[1:01:04] born in sin now stop a minute I want you
[1:01:08] to get something nobody nobody was ever
[1:01:11] born again before
[1:01:15] Pentecost amen nobody was ever born
[1:01:18] again before Pentecost now the doctrine
[1:01:21] was being preached Jesus said to
[1:01:23] Nicodemus you must be born again but
[1:01:26] there could not be a new birth until the
[1:01:29] elements came forth from him to bring
[1:01:32] forth a new birth so there was no new
[1:01:35] birth under the Old Testament it's only
[1:01:37] in the New Testament that you have a a
[1:01:41] new birth and that could only come after
[1:01:43] Jesus death burial Resurrection
[1:01:46] Ascension and coming again by the spirit
[1:01:49] on the day of Pentecost so he rebirthed
[1:01:52] us who was born in sin thus we were lost
[1:01:56] and alienated from God and he brought us
[1:02:00] through the blood of Jesus that thus we
[1:02:03] are cleans from all sins and this re
[1:02:07] this brings us back to
[1:02:09] relationship to God and God's original
[1:02:13] intent and his original intent was that
[1:02:16] he would have sons that he could
[1:02:18] fellowship with sons and daughters of
[1:02:21] God and in giving up his life he
[1:02:24] destroyed sin and he brought us into the
[1:02:27] family of God now not by adopting the
[1:02:31] devil's
[1:02:32] children not by taking the devil's
[1:02:34] children and make them one of his and
[1:02:36] cleaning them up and say okay I'll take
[1:02:39] the Devil's Child and make a one one of
[1:02:41] mine no sir he didn't do that he brought
[1:02:44] us into the family by birthing us as
[1:02:48] Sons anden by putting part of his life
[1:02:52] or his holy spirit in us and now our
[1:02:56] body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:00] amen for God's spirit dwells in US isn't
[1:03:04] that
[1:03:05] marvelous What A Plan of Redemption that
[1:03:08] God had that God the Bible said you know
[1:03:12] that he would
[1:03:13] condescend and he would he would put off
[1:03:17] his Robes of godship to become a man in
[1:03:20] order for the for the purpose of
[1:03:23] redemption so didn't Jesus say in and
[1:03:26] that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:03:27] Father the father in me and I in you you
[1:03:31] see you see the Church of the Living God
[1:03:33] then is the anointed body of the Lord
[1:03:36] Jesus Christ and we're walking here upon
[1:03:39] the Earth given a hope to the world that
[1:03:42] blessed hope that that nothing else can
[1:03:45] give is the hope of eternal life amen
[1:03:50] and the proof of his love is that his
[1:03:53] Spirit Bears witness with our spirit
[1:03:56] that we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:03:59] Amen now there at Calvary when he was
[1:04:02] pierced with a spear it
[1:04:04] released the from the blood cell the
[1:04:08] spirit of God and released in the Holy
[1:04:10] Ghost and washing Us by the water of the
[1:04:13] word you know out that came came from
[1:04:16] from him it brought us into himself by
[1:04:18] the holy spirit's baptism and now we are
[1:04:22] sons of God Amen we are part of God
[1:04:26] deity lives within every Spirit-filled
[1:04:30] child of God Amen every man or woman
[1:04:33] that's born in the spirit of God is a
[1:04:35] part of
[1:04:36] God Amen and no wonder then we can
[1:04:39] believe in the
[1:04:41] Supernatural no wonder we can believe
[1:04:43] for anything that nothing is impossible
[1:04:47] why is it because in US is a portion of
[1:04:50] God that is wrapped up within this moral
[1:04:53] body a body that came because cuses sin
[1:04:57] through sexual birth but birth down on
[1:04:59] the inside amen within the soul by the
[1:05:03] overshadowing of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:05:06] work of God Alone through the power of
[1:05:09] regeneration by the shedding of the
[1:05:12] blood of Jesus that makes you and I Sons
[1:05:15] and Daughters of God and deity
[1:05:19] manifested In the Flesh no wonder Jesus
[1:05:22] said then these signs shall follow them
[1:05:24] that believe they can believe for the
[1:05:27] impossible Amen in my name they shall
[1:05:29] cast out Devils they will have dominion
[1:05:32] over the spirit realm amen and they you
[1:05:35] know if they lay hands on the sick they
[1:05:37] shall recover they have the right to
[1:05:40] impart uh impart life amen through the
[1:05:44] power of the Holy Ghost what is it you
[1:05:47] know we because we have become a part of
[1:05:50] Christ and any man that is born of Jesus
[1:05:53] that believes in him that believes the
[1:05:56] word you have to be a part of God Amen
[1:05:59] you're an offspring of God you're a Son
[1:06:01] of God a daughter of God you you can't
[1:06:04] do nothing else but believe it's
[1:06:07] impossible for you to still be a an
[1:06:10] unbeliever you something that on the
[1:06:12] inside of you from that new birth causes
[1:06:15] you to believe God's word and when
[1:06:18] there's something about God he cannot
[1:06:20] deny
[1:06:21] himself that scripture amen and if God's
[1:06:25] on the end you inside of you you cannot
[1:06:27] deny the word amen so as Sons and
[1:06:31] Daughters of God we're join I with him
[1:06:34] in the in the Kingdom believe in
[1:06:36] everything that the father says to be
[1:06:38] the
[1:06:39] truth amen
[1:06:42] now unless you're born of the spirit how
[1:06:45] can you believe when there's nothing to
[1:06:48] believe
[1:06:50] with you you have just a carnal mind
[1:06:53] with a mental conception therefore you
[1:06:55] can't
[1:06:57] believe and that's the reason that many
[1:07:00] don't believe today in Divine Healing
[1:07:02] you know I was just I was just on um the
[1:07:06] other day and and was uh was looking for
[1:07:09] a certain thing and came across in in my
[1:07:12] study there about the different
[1:07:15] denominations that take the position of
[1:07:18] why they don't believe in Divine
[1:07:20] Healing For example the Baptist say that
[1:07:23] they it was only for for the apostles
[1:07:27] that that was for just to establish the
[1:07:29] gospel and after the gospel is
[1:07:31] established um is not for us
[1:07:34] anymore so you see you see they make
[1:07:37] every excuse to deny it because they've
[1:07:41] never walked into that bloodstream to
[1:07:44] The Fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:47] and and truly been birthed by his Spirit
[1:07:50] you said well they they believe yes I I
[1:07:53] met a man the other day you know when um
[1:07:56] a young man that well I I call him young
[1:07:59] but he's um probably starting toward
[1:08:01] middle age now but never the less a few
[1:08:04] years ago he was a part of our youth
[1:08:06] group and then left and went out into
[1:08:08] the world and I met him the other day
[1:08:10] and he said brother Tim I believe every
[1:08:14] word in the Bible I believe in
[1:08:18] Jesus and I'm looking at him and I'm I'm
[1:08:23] one to believe that he believes
[1:08:26] I really am and it's not because he's
[1:08:28] not going to my church but because I see
[1:08:31] the fruit of sin of smoking and drinking
[1:08:34] and and drugs and you know a life and
[1:08:38] yet he's he's telling me but I
[1:08:44] believe but I believe in other
[1:08:48] words I can accept that as being true
[1:08:51] you know it's a mental
[1:08:53] conception but a real Faith bursts you
[1:08:57] into the kingdom of God as a Son of God
[1:09:01] and then it produces the works of
[1:09:04] God Amen now so you know again again I I
[1:09:08] didn't try to take from him what he had
[1:09:10] I just tried to add to what he had you
[1:09:13] know I tried to encourage him to to move
[1:09:15] in the right direction I didn't even try
[1:09:17] to take away the belief he had and man I
[1:09:20] just try to get him to build on it you
[1:09:23] know but you see again when you receive
[1:09:26] the Holy Ghost you you have God's
[1:09:30] attributes you have his
[1:09:32] characteristics and characteristics of
[1:09:35] God his character you can't help but
[1:09:38] believe in the Supernatural you can't
[1:09:41] you can't help but believe that all
[1:09:43] things are possible as an offspring of
[1:09:46] God then my soul is in God's likeness if
[1:09:50] I'm born again I'm in the image of God
[1:09:53] and in the image of God We Believe the
[1:09:56] supernatural now I know you're look at
[1:09:58] this body it's not the image of God it
[1:10:00] it's a fallen image but on the inside of
[1:10:04] the
[1:10:05] inside amen there is one that is born in
[1:10:08] the image of God that can believe God's
[1:10:13] word for anything that he
[1:10:16] says amen his love is within us we
[1:10:19] believe all things hope all things a man
[1:10:21] truly born again you talk about to him
[1:10:24] about divine healing sure he believes it
[1:10:26] you believe in miracles sure why because
[1:10:29] he's a part of
[1:10:30] God Amen if he makes excuses and says
[1:10:34] well it's not the season for
[1:10:37] miracles well that was only for the
[1:10:39] apostles or that was only for 40 or 50
[1:10:42] years ago in in a certain a certain
[1:10:46] dispensation and you know he's not of
[1:10:48] God that's right amen he that is of god
[1:10:52] Hearth God's word believes on it and
[1:10:54] acts on it yeah Amen Let allow me to
[1:10:57] quote from God perfecting his church
[1:11:00] brother Bram said that blood cell The
[1:11:02] Germ of Life Of God himself wrapped in
[1:11:05] this blood cell that brought forth the
[1:11:07] son Christ Jesus now what he did or does
[1:11:10] by that to make you perfect and to bring
[1:11:12] you back into Fellowship he brings you
[1:11:14] to the blood cell and to himself you get
[1:11:17] it through the blood cell of the Lord
[1:11:19] Jesus that unveiled the life of Jehovah
[1:11:22] and we come into the blood cell becomes
[1:11:24] a part of that life so deity itself lays
[1:11:28] in the man that has received the Holy
[1:11:31] Ghost yeah Holy Spirit you're a son I'm
[1:11:34] a brandom by birth a part of Mr Mrs
[1:11:37] brandom is in me and if you become a son
[1:11:39] or daughter of God part of deity lays in
[1:11:42] you see how the devil robs you say oh
[1:11:45] you can't do this all things are
[1:11:47] possible to them that believe no matter
[1:11:49] what it is you're a part of deity a son
[1:11:52] or daughter not a servant a son or
[1:11:54] daughter so you know this is not
[1:11:57] different from what the word says amen
[1:12:00] the word says this about us that now we
[1:12:03] are the sons of God again in Acts 17
[1:12:07] verse 28 he says for in him we live and
[1:12:12] move and have our being for we are also
[1:12:15] his
[1:12:16] offspring amen so you know Paul had
[1:12:19] quoted even from a poet who had said
[1:12:22] that but he said this is the fact that
[1:12:25] in him we live and we move and we have
[1:12:28] our being for we are also his offspring
[1:12:33] amen so now again this is the word of
[1:12:37] God and and then he says in 1
[1:12:40] Corinthians 6:17 that he that is joined
[1:12:44] or made relation to the Lord becomes one
[1:12:46] spirit with him so if you are joined to
[1:12:51] the Lord you are one spirit with him
[1:12:55] amen again 1 Corinthians 619 says your
[1:13:00] body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:02] within you whom you have from God you
[1:13:05] are not your
[1:13:07] own so you are the Temple of the Holy
[1:13:10] Ghost amen your body is God's Dwelling
[1:13:15] Place thanks be to God Amen and the
[1:13:20] Bible says about that one that lives in
[1:13:22] you in 1 John 4 and4 he who is in you is
[1:13:27] greater than he that is in the
[1:13:30] world Amen and we are Overcomers and
[1:13:34] conquerors like Jesus for he says in
[1:13:37] Romans 8:37 in all these things we are
[1:13:41] more than conquerors through him that
[1:13:44] loved us so he that is Born Again is a
[1:13:47] conqueror an overcomer amen he is a
[1:13:52] vessel whom God dwells in and greater is
[1:13:55] he that is in him than that he that is
[1:13:57] in the world and then he says in
[1:13:59] galatian 3:26 for in Christ Jesus you
[1:14:02] are all sons of God through faith and
[1:14:06] then he says in Romans 8:17 and if
[1:14:09] children then HS HS of God and fellow HS
[1:14:13] with Christ am a't that amazing these
[1:14:16] are wonderful
[1:14:18] scriptures he sums it all up by by
[1:14:21] bringing this in 1 Corinthians 2:16 we
[1:14:25] have the mind of Christ we think like he
[1:14:30] thinks so you think like Jesus that
[1:14:33] means you have the same attitude toward
[1:14:35] the loss he
[1:14:39] did amen somebody's truly filled with
[1:14:41] the Holy Ghost ain't going to try to
[1:14:43] close the door of
[1:14:45] Mercy amen they're going to hold it open
[1:14:49] and say whosoever will let him come come
[1:14:51] on I'll I'll read it to you from the
[1:14:54] Bible in the Bible Revelation 19 it says
[1:14:58] it said and the spirit and the bride say
[1:15:02] come and those that are thirst say
[1:15:07] come and come and drink of the Water of
[1:15:09] Life
[1:15:11] freely so it goes to show you that is
[1:15:14] who the bride is she is a people who is
[1:15:16] saying
[1:15:20] come not we closed the door somebody has
[1:15:25] the come watch
[1:15:28] now so we we have the same attitude
[1:15:31] toward the sick like Jesus
[1:15:37] did because why sickness is a result of
[1:15:42] sin not our sins per se but but the sin
[1:15:45] of Adam all the way from the
[1:15:47] beginning now so again we have the same
[1:15:50] attitude of redemption we believe that
[1:15:52] God can redeem the soul we believe he
[1:15:55] can save the body so again that makes us
[1:15:59] then a a a different species from
[1:16:03] another kingdom we're birthed into a
[1:16:05] kingdom for example 1 Corinthians 2 um
[1:16:08] excuse me Philippians 3:20 says our
[1:16:11] citizenship is of heaven so we're a
[1:16:14] people born of another kingdom that's
[1:16:18] why we don't do the things the world
[1:16:20] does that's why we're not influenced by
[1:16:23] what the world does we don't dress like
[1:16:26] them we don't act like them we don't
[1:16:28] believe like them behave like them
[1:16:30] because we are from another kingdom and
[1:16:33] we are here representing the kingdom
[1:16:36] we're
[1:16:37] from amen so again we are again the
[1:16:41] Bible said in 2 Corinthians 5:20 we are
[1:16:45] ambassadors for Christ which means we
[1:16:48] are God's
[1:16:52] representative so we are here right
[1:16:54] representing him as his Ambassador we
[1:16:57] are a citizen of heaven we have a
[1:17:01] kingdom within us we are we are inviting
[1:17:05] others into this Kingdom we are
[1:17:07] resisting the devil's Kingdom that's who
[1:17:10] we are now I did all of that because I
[1:17:15] want to remind you again what the word
[1:17:18] says about you yes now Jesus had faith
[1:17:23] in the word
[1:17:25] and that said it is written of me so
[1:17:28] I've just I've just read you just a
[1:17:30] small fragment of things that was
[1:17:32] written of
[1:17:35] you so just so you just have a sampling
[1:17:38] of of what it says about
[1:17:41] you amen and so that you can have faith
[1:17:44] like Jesus did of what was written of me
[1:17:49] he says that's what gave him faith and
[1:17:52] he would refer back to the Psalms and
[1:17:54] and and and said didn't David and the
[1:17:56] Psalms and the prophets and all of them
[1:17:58] speak of him remember this is the way
[1:18:01] Jesus when he walked with the Copus and
[1:18:04] the other disciple on the way to EMAs
[1:18:07] what did he do he began to go through
[1:18:10] the
[1:18:11] scriptures amen and began to reveal
[1:18:14] things concerning himself what the
[1:18:17] scriptures said of him and the Bible
[1:18:19] said he began with Moses and that's the
[1:18:22] five first books The Books of Moses
[1:18:25] amen he began with Moses and all the
[1:18:28] prophets and explained to him what would
[1:18:31] to them what was written in all the
[1:18:33] scriptures about himself what a
[1:18:35] marvelous sevenmile
[1:18:39] walk amen it was seven it was seven
[1:18:42] miles there that he he went down they
[1:18:45] were heading down even away from the
[1:18:48] promise I I want to get something to you
[1:18:50] there let me stop and talk about it here
[1:18:53] there was Copus and the other disciples
[1:18:56] and they were sad and
[1:18:58] brokenhearted because things hadn't
[1:19:00] happened the way they had it figured out
[1:19:02] to be they had it figured out that Jesus
[1:19:05] would be the son of David he would be
[1:19:07] the king and he would Reign and he would
[1:19:10] bring Rome under their feet and all the
[1:19:13] other things and and they didn't realize
[1:19:16] it wasn't this that coming that's a
[1:19:18] future coming he had to come first for
[1:19:22] Redemption amen so he he he joins them
[1:19:26] he has told them to go to the upper room
[1:19:30] go to the city of Jerusalem and stay
[1:19:32] there and wait for the power from on
[1:19:34] high but they're going the wrong
[1:19:38] direction amen and Jesus himself Drew
[1:19:41] near don't don't that tell you something
[1:19:44] amen that if he's got an upper room
[1:19:47] experience for you and you are going the
[1:19:50] wrong direction he's going to go after
[1:19:53] you
[1:19:56] amen he's going to start walking with
[1:19:58] you and begin to reveal things about
[1:20:00] himself and and saying shouldn't this
[1:20:02] have been done and wasn't should this
[1:20:04] been the way it be all of these things
[1:20:06] try to make you
[1:20:09] understand your current events and what
[1:20:11] is
[1:20:12] happening to do what get them back to
[1:20:15] Jerusalem
[1:20:20] again they ran all the way back I don't
[1:20:22] know how they did it but I I'll tell you
[1:20:24] what if IID have sat with him and he had
[1:20:27] have broke bread like he did before I
[1:20:29] don't know how he did it maybe pulled a
[1:20:31] piece off and another piece appear and
[1:20:33] another piece and another piece appear
[1:20:35] he's still the
[1:20:37] Creator somebody said the other day
[1:20:39] Jesus never performed any Miracles after
[1:20:42] his resurrection so you see there's no
[1:20:44] Miracles after the resurrection of Jesus
[1:20:46] I said oh come
[1:20:49] on come
[1:20:52] on you're talking the wrong f
[1:20:55] yes I have read my Bible this Jesus
[1:20:58] would come and appear and lock doors
[1:21:01] right through the walls this Jesus
[1:21:04] didn't put a hook in line and take a net
[1:21:06] out but he had fish on the
[1:21:09] fire this Jesus would tell them cast
[1:21:12] your net I'm talking about after his
[1:21:14] resurrection on the other side and they
[1:21:17] would and they would they would draw in
[1:21:19] the net and there would be 153 fishes so
[1:21:21] much that their Nets would start
[1:21:23] breaking
[1:21:27] he didn't do any Miracles his very
[1:21:29] Ascension was a
[1:21:32] miracle amen his resurrection was an was
[1:21:35] a miracle his Ascension was a miracle
[1:21:38] him coming back on the day of Pentecost
[1:21:40] was a miracle but unless you receive
[1:21:42] that
[1:21:43] Miracle then you're going to have to
[1:21:45] you'll have problems believing in his
[1:21:50] miracles so you see starting back in
[1:21:53] Genesis the first first book of Moses he
[1:21:56] began to tell he looked into the
[1:21:59] scripture is my point looking there and
[1:22:01] said okay I you remember all the way
[1:22:05] back in Eden who was that tree of
[1:22:11] life if a man eat of me he shall never
[1:22:14] die I am that I am I'm that burning bush
[1:22:19] I am that light that was in that burning
[1:22:22] bush I've come down to now to delivered
[1:22:25] from sin and sickness and he looked back
[1:22:27] at the Mana and he could point to that
[1:22:29] and he would
[1:22:30] say I am the bread of life that came
[1:22:34] down out of God from
[1:22:37] Heaven he would look at a serpent on a
[1:22:42] pole remember Moses the Bible said in
[1:22:45] John 3:13 as Moses lifted up the serpent
[1:22:48] in the wilderness even so must the son
[1:22:50] of man be lifted up what was he doing he
[1:22:53] was looking back into the scripture and
[1:22:57] he could even say I'm going to be
[1:22:59] crucified it'll be sin judged on the
[1:23:02] tree I'm going to die for the sins of
[1:23:06] the world come on amen he he would show
[1:23:09] it there I I'm going there to to the
[1:23:12] cross and and he says he said that
[1:23:15] whosoever should believe in him would
[1:23:17] should not perish but have ever eternal
[1:23:21] life in joh John 12:32 if I lifted up
[1:23:25] from the earth will draw all men to me
[1:23:27] this he said signifying which death he
[1:23:30] would die so Jesus would would look at
[1:23:34] himself as that serpent on the pole
[1:23:37] that's
[1:23:39] right that would be a little hard
[1:23:43] without
[1:23:45] Revelation without the spirit of God
[1:23:47] quickening to him the word when he read
[1:23:49] it to look at a serpent on the pole and
[1:23:52] said that's me
[1:23:56] not that he was sin but that he became
[1:24:01] sin and if anybody who's bitten by the
[1:24:04] serpent will look to him they can
[1:24:11] live so you see this he knew with
[1:24:15] perfect faith that he was a anointed
[1:24:17] Messiah now I'm trying to get you to
[1:24:20] understand because we want to think oh
[1:24:23] he was God though I mean he could
[1:24:26] remember all those no he would Veil from
[1:24:29] himself so that as a man he would go
[1:24:33] through it just like you did remember
[1:24:35] when he defeated the the devil on Mount
[1:24:37] Transfiguration he didn't use his great
[1:24:40] power not Transfiguration Temptation you
[1:24:43] know he he would he wouldn't use his his
[1:24:46] um um Power to do it he used the
[1:24:51] word because maybe you are not gifted as
[1:24:55] he
[1:24:55] was but you got the word like he
[1:24:59] had and what I'm trying to get you to do
[1:25:01] is read your
[1:25:04] Bible amen they are they that prophesy
[1:25:08] of this day that we are living they
[1:25:10] speak about you look in there and see
[1:25:14] what the word of God said let the Holy
[1:25:16] Spirit brood over you and reveal you who
[1:25:20] you are the scripture is speaking over
[1:25:24] over and over and over again pointing to
[1:25:28] this very day and
[1:25:29] hour so Jesus knew with perfect
[1:25:32] faith and if I believe and you see you
[1:25:37] see of course God was in him he was a
[1:25:39] word made manifest and when the word
[1:25:41] comes in you it's made manifest for you
[1:25:45] are a Believer and the believer is the
[1:25:46] faith of God that moves in you it's
[1:25:48] because you're not truly a Believer if
[1:25:50] the faith of God cannot move in you and
[1:25:53] through you so you must know who you are
[1:25:57] yes let me stop there a
[1:26:00] minute you got to know whose you
[1:26:03] are before you know who you
[1:26:09] are and when you know you never were the
[1:26:12] Devil's
[1:26:15] Child you were just lost and a strain
[1:26:19] from him but you never originally
[1:26:22] belonged to the devil
[1:26:25] in fact your name was written in the
[1:26:27] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:26:29] foundation of the world and when you
[1:26:31] know who you
[1:26:34] are then you know who you
[1:26:41] are
[1:26:43] now if
[1:26:46] you you must know who you are and who it
[1:26:50] is within you and and I just say if
[1:26:53] you're not there
[1:26:54] push toward it that's right like a
[1:26:57] little ACR and dig a Little
[1:27:00] Deeper amen dig in the nutrients from
[1:27:02] the soil of the word and push toward the
[1:27:05] sun toward the light until you become a
[1:27:07] Mighty Oak you see we've been planted
[1:27:10] into the inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[1:27:14] and we are just to drink and drink and
[1:27:16] drink and as we do we push out amen and
[1:27:20] and everything that we need for life's
[1:27:23] journey is is within us Divine Healing
[1:27:26] the power of God you know the baptism of
[1:27:28] the Holy Ghost everything if you're
[1:27:30] planted in Christ amen everything you
[1:27:33] have need of for the life's journey is
[1:27:35] already in you even the Rapture is in
[1:27:38] you yes
[1:27:39] sir man you you like Jesus would say I
[1:27:43] am the
[1:27:44] resurrection you got to realize I am the
[1:27:49] Rapture he can't leave without me
[1:27:54] amen the church can't go without me I am
[1:27:57] the
[1:27:59] Rapture you you see the Rapture is in US
[1:28:03] amen well how do you know that's true
[1:28:06] because those he called he justified and
[1:28:09] those he justified he had
[1:28:12] glorified so it's already within you so
[1:28:16] therefore as far as God's concerned is
[1:28:19] an already done deal we're just we're
[1:28:22] but he's he's up here watching in our
[1:28:24] journey here we see ourselves not there
[1:28:26] but he sees the end and he sees you
[1:28:29] already
[1:28:30] there so knowing who he was without a
[1:28:34] shadow of a doubt Jesus knew he was the
[1:28:37] Son of God the works identified him he
[1:28:40] said if I don't do the works of my
[1:28:42] father don't believe me
[1:28:44] but you just if I do them then believe
[1:28:47] the works for they are man the
[1:28:49] manifested word promise so he could
[1:28:52] actually stand and say who can condemn
[1:28:55] me of sin or of unbelief show me what
[1:28:59] the father said about me that I haven't
[1:29:02] done amen who can condemn me of sin you
[1:29:05] see that's exactly where the church has
[1:29:09] to come to where we can say ourselves
[1:29:12] who can condemn us of unbelief show us
[1:29:15] the scripture in the Bible that we're
[1:29:18] not
[1:29:20] fulfilling we're fulfilling what was
[1:29:22] spoken of us
[1:29:24] who can condemn me of sin sin is
[1:29:26] unbelief oh my I mean how how
[1:29:31] could don't you know we're going to be
[1:29:33] condemned of sins if we're saying days
[1:29:35] of Miracles are passed that's right if
[1:29:37] we're not believing for the
[1:29:39] impossible amen don't you know then we
[1:29:42] can be condemned of sin the only way we
[1:29:45] can be not condemned of sin is believe
[1:29:47] that all things are possible to them
[1:29:50] that believe amen then we will not be
[1:29:52] condemned with the word
[1:29:54] world Amen when we deny the gifts that's
[1:29:57] in the Bible the things that's in the
[1:29:59] word of God and say it's for another age
[1:30:01] well then we can be condemned of
[1:30:03] unbelief that's amen but you see but but
[1:30:08] you see the
[1:30:09] identification of a True Believer is
[1:30:12] these signs shall follow them that
[1:30:15] believe so how can you even call
[1:30:18] yourself a Believer and deny those words
[1:30:20] how how can you call yourself a Believer
[1:30:22] and and deny any word of God you have to
[1:30:26] believe oh my now I tell you what
[1:30:30] brother brandom talked about a church
[1:30:32] that is on his road that will be able to
[1:30:34] say those things who can condemn me of
[1:30:37] sin who what word has been spoken of a
[1:30:40] bride that I have not
[1:30:42] fulfilled I want to say I'm in that
[1:30:45] church amen I and I'm not talking about
[1:30:48] even and light I'm talking about the
[1:30:49] body of Christ amen the the power zone
[1:30:53] is God's provided unlimited power and
[1:30:57] unlimited
[1:30:59] resources but it's knowing how to exess
[1:31:03] it let's talk for a
[1:31:05] moment knowing how to access it we all
[1:31:09] know that there's electricity in these
[1:31:14] sockets and these electrical outlets if
[1:31:18] you plug an appliance in amen and and
[1:31:22] nothing happens
[1:31:24] well you're not going to say there's no
[1:31:25] such thing as
[1:31:27] electricity because you
[1:31:30] know you SE it
[1:31:34] work amen you say it's worked
[1:31:38] before it can work
[1:31:40] again so there's either something wrong
[1:31:42] with the appliance something wrong with
[1:31:45] the cord something wrong with the
[1:31:47] acceptable receptacle something wrong
[1:31:49] with the lines or something wrong with
[1:31:51] the power
[1:31:52] source what the thing about our power
[1:31:56] source mind it never ever ever Runs
[1:32:01] Out come on so we don't we know it
[1:32:05] doesn't lay in
[1:32:08] God it lays somewhere in the
[1:32:15] wiring something's disconnected
[1:32:19] somewhere now let's think about this
[1:32:22] because too often people do the same
[1:32:25] when someone's prayed for and don't get
[1:32:27] healed they want to say that there's no
[1:32:28] such thing as Divine
[1:32:30] Healing and that's just essentious to
[1:32:32] saying there's no such thing as
[1:32:35] electricity amen others are getting
[1:32:37] healed we can point them out right amen
[1:32:42] you know the world is full of
[1:32:44] electricity you know that there's
[1:32:46] electricity and unseen force in the
[1:32:49] heavens and when it builds up enough we
[1:32:52] see a light show in the heavens is
[1:32:54] called we call it
[1:32:55] lightning there's electricity in your
[1:32:59] hair there's electricity in your
[1:33:02] clothing it's everywhere you see you but
[1:33:07] if you're in the middle of the field and
[1:33:09] at night and you can't see where you're
[1:33:10] going and and you don't know if there's
[1:33:14] a snake you may be stepping on your next
[1:33:17] step you might stand out there and
[1:33:19] scream and you say oh it's dark I need
[1:33:23] electric
[1:33:24] I need some lights oh electricity you're
[1:33:27] in the
[1:33:30] heavens make light for
[1:33:33] me I know you can get light you know
[1:33:35] electricity I this is a dark place
[1:33:39] here and I know you're here electricity
[1:33:42] while you're in my hair you're in my
[1:33:43] clothing you're you're in the heavens
[1:33:45] you're there but even science has proved
[1:33:48] you're here come make me a light well
[1:33:51] you know you're wasting your breath
[1:33:54] be awful foolish wouldn't it looking out
[1:33:56] at our parking lot you know it was once
[1:33:58] a dark field but now at night it's lit
[1:34:01] up why because instead of
[1:34:04] screaming we have went through the right
[1:34:06] channels and made made have the power to
[1:34:10] light it
[1:34:11] up see and and let me say this way the
[1:34:15] whole room is full of the power of God
[1:34:18] there is enough here to make every
[1:34:21] person that that would in any person in
[1:34:24] here well whether it be a lady on the
[1:34:26] stretcher a boy in a wheelchair or or
[1:34:29] make people cripples walk by th seat
[1:34:31] there's enough power in this
[1:34:35] building right
[1:34:38] now to make every cancer patient
[1:34:42] well amen actually see every old person
[1:34:47] young amen there's enough power in this
[1:34:50] building right
[1:34:51] now but you got to know how to access
[1:34:56] it now and the way that to do it you've
[1:34:59] got to get the Holy Spirit flowing
[1:35:02] through the right category to do it now
[1:35:07] you say what how much power well we're
[1:35:09] seated in Heavenly places with power and
[1:35:13] authority and all the power of Heaven is
[1:35:15] behind us amen again you know right down
[1:35:19] here we right down the road we own this
[1:35:21] little Pond right here on our Church
[1:35:24] property and it has a spring in it has
[1:35:26] water in it all year round and we got
[1:35:29] right here on this field and around us
[1:35:32] we got grass that needs to be watered
[1:35:35] you're not going to get it by screaming
[1:35:37] at the pond and say come water
[1:35:40] this you know oh you great gusting
[1:35:43] spring from that that pond down there
[1:35:45] well up Old Spring and come up here and
[1:35:48] water our grass oh you can scream you
[1:35:51] can cry you can shout you can run you
[1:35:53] you could speak in tongues you could you
[1:35:55] could jump up and down you could sing
[1:35:57] songs you could
[1:35:59] preach but until you work in harmony
[1:36:03] Sir with the laws of nature you're not
[1:36:07] going to get that water here to
[1:36:11] water you see and the same thing you you
[1:36:14] can scream you can cry you can shout you
[1:36:16] can you can do everything you can work
[1:36:18] up but unless you get in harmony with
[1:36:20] the Holy Ghost you just make yourself
[1:36:23] horse and get
[1:36:24] nowhere so you see the water will water
[1:36:27] the grass if you work with the correct
[1:36:30] laws of gravitation so you can actually
[1:36:33] dig a ditch and if you will aim it down
[1:36:36] low enough you'll get water pulled up
[1:36:39] around here that you'll have water in
[1:36:41] this lawn but you know you just can't
[1:36:45] make it jump over here or you can do it
[1:36:47] the Modern Way which makes a lot more
[1:36:50] sense to me you could you could run
[1:36:52] electricity to pump put it out on the
[1:36:55] pond and you can irrigate this whole
[1:36:57] field out here there's enough water in
[1:37:00] it to sprinkle every day amen now what
[1:37:03] I'm trying to say is we've got enough of
[1:37:06] the Holy Ghost to heal every person in
[1:37:09] this place if we will work according to
[1:37:13] the plan and the will of the Holy
[1:37:15] scriptures there's enough Christians in
[1:37:18] this building today to close the heavens
[1:37:22] but you got to work according to the
[1:37:24] will of the spirit of God according to
[1:37:27] his laws and that's what we're trying to
[1:37:29] do right now is help you to understand
[1:37:32] your position in Christ amen where where
[1:37:35] that you instead of just running away
[1:37:38] from this truth and denying it and But
[1:37:41] realize there is a way to bring healing
[1:37:45] to the sick salvation to the lost and a
[1:37:49] Rapture to the church
[1:37:54] now again if you connect the wire with
[1:37:59] the word of the word with the Damo of
[1:38:02] the Holy Ghost and then you check the
[1:38:04] voltage that says the connection is true
[1:38:07] mountains are going to
[1:38:09] move because if the connection is true
[1:38:12] without a breakage in the
[1:38:15] current amen it's going to flow energy
[1:38:18] and power and it's the power that lays
[1:38:23] Within your Bible in the word of God is
[1:38:25] going to be released to do its
[1:38:28] work so like I said you know you just
[1:38:32] like taking an appliance cord and
[1:38:34] sticking it in a socket where there's no
[1:38:36] current there you know it's just a dead
[1:38:38] wire that no matter how much socket it
[1:38:41] is and I wanted to say a lot of times we
[1:38:44] have a lot of places that they got the
[1:38:49] structure they got the structure you
[1:38:52] know they got wires that are
[1:38:54] run but they have never connected to the
[1:38:58] Dynamo they have never connected to the
[1:39:01] Holy Ghost and as long as you're still a
[1:39:03] dead wire you know it has no life in it
[1:39:07] it's just dead Thunder with no
[1:39:10] lightning amen now electricity is a
[1:39:13] funny thing do you know you know I I I
[1:39:16] had to look it up the other day to to to
[1:39:19] be able to to to understand this but you
[1:39:22] know no one knows
[1:39:23] what electricity is you ain't figured it
[1:39:27] out
[1:39:28] yet in fact let me just quote it from
[1:39:32] from from their authorities what but
[1:39:35] what exactly is electricity that is a
[1:39:38] very complicated question and as you dig
[1:39:41] deeper and ask more questions there's
[1:39:44] really not a definitive answer only
[1:39:47] abstract or theoretical representation
[1:39:50] of how electricity interacts with our
[1:39:55] surroundings so now after all these
[1:39:58] years we don't even know what it
[1:40:02] is amen but we have made an invisible
[1:40:06] force work for
[1:40:09] us now that's in the natural realm with
[1:40:13] God's laws that he put up on the earth
[1:40:15] then if that's true how about the
[1:40:17] spiritual
[1:40:18] round am man I mean we're taking
[1:40:21] something we don't know what it's all
[1:40:23] about about and we're putting it to work
[1:40:25] and then you think about there's God
[1:40:27] he's so vast he's so big he's so beyond
[1:40:30] our human understanding and it ain't an
[1:40:34] understanding him it's just knowing he's
[1:40:37] the power and putting to
[1:40:40] work that it'll work in your life it'll
[1:40:43] give you overcoming power it'll defeat
[1:40:46] the Devil anywhere any place
[1:40:49] anytime no matter what it is physically
[1:40:52] spiritually
[1:40:54] whatever it is now brother bradam would
[1:40:57] simplify it in his terms and say it's
[1:40:59] two pieces of material rolling along
[1:41:02] together that makes the continuity and
[1:41:04] sends out the electricity and that's the
[1:41:05] way it is when those two pieces get to
[1:41:07] Rolling together what brings it off of
[1:41:09] the generator and so that's the way when
[1:41:12] a Christian gets to working with God
[1:41:14] rolling together that brings an unseen
[1:41:17] force that does Mysteries that none of
[1:41:20] us know nothing about Only We Know It's
[1:41:23] God
[1:41:25] amen now you know there again we we had
[1:41:29] a man some years ago back in the early
[1:41:32] days of America his name was Ben
[1:41:34] Franklin Benjamin Franklin he had a
[1:41:37] hunch that there was electrical charges
[1:41:40] in the
[1:41:41] heavens and he flew a kite in a storm
[1:41:44] and the wet uh kite string picked up the
[1:41:48] ambient electrical charge from the storm
[1:41:51] and the feel of that current let him
[1:41:54] know that electricity was in the heavens
[1:41:58] electricity is power and even the
[1:42:00] heavens were full of it and Franklin
[1:42:03] just needed to find a way to harness it
[1:42:08] and we know that the heavens are full of
[1:42:11] the power of God Amen and God is
[1:42:14] omnipotent power and we know that even
[1:42:17] his word has power somebody help me
[1:42:20] preach it's full of divine energy but we
[1:42:23] must know how to tap into to Heaven's
[1:42:28] resource now Franklin's Discovery did
[1:42:30] very little to put electricity to
[1:42:34] work it just proved it was there but
[1:42:37] here come along another man and his name
[1:42:39] was Thomas Edison and Thomas Edison
[1:42:43] believed that he could make that
[1:42:45] work that he could take that electrical
[1:42:48] charge and put wires together in a
[1:42:51] vacuum and make uh it Glow and produce a
[1:42:56] light and I tell you what he was
[1:42:59] tireless he would go through hundreds of
[1:43:02] wires trying to figure it out and you
[1:43:05] know that's the way it is with the with
[1:43:07] the Bible the Bible said he is a
[1:43:09] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:43:12] Him amen you know there again you you
[1:43:16] you plug your Appliance in it doesn't
[1:43:19] work well you don't say there's no
[1:43:20] electricity you want to find out okay
[1:43:23] why isn't it
[1:43:26] working amen there's something broken
[1:43:29] somewhere there's a broken line there's
[1:43:32] a broken wire there's a short in the
[1:43:35] system something there it's running it's
[1:43:38] a breaking wire it's running it into the
[1:43:40] ground and the power isn't reaching here
[1:43:43] why is
[1:43:44] it and you you don't give up on it you
[1:43:47] keep working until you figure it
[1:43:50] out and that's why the Bible said you
[1:43:53] must be
[1:43:55] persistent because he is a rewarder of
[1:43:58] them that diligently seek Him amen we
[1:44:02] don't just say oh well I was prayed for
[1:44:04] it and I didn't get healed well I guess
[1:44:06] there's nothing to it but you know don't
[1:44:08] throw the appliance out and say the days
[1:44:10] of electricity has
[1:44:11] passed amen go and find out where
[1:44:13] there's a break in the
[1:44:15] line amen God wants somebody who won't
[1:44:18] give up amen for a winner will never
[1:44:21] quit and a quitter never wins you got to
[1:44:23] stay and you got to call things right
[1:44:26] amen before Satan and tell him it is a
[1:44:29] way it is thus say the Lord the Lord
[1:44:31] said so it's written it is written
[1:44:34] whatsoever I ask and I believe God I
[1:44:37] shall receive it it's my property it's
[1:44:40] attainable it's
[1:44:42] mine it's a deep caller to the Deep
[1:44:46] there has to be something in the human
[1:44:48] heart that desires
[1:44:50] Deliverance that's why you'll never get
[1:44:53] delivered unless you desire
[1:44:55] Deliverance even on the on the
[1:44:58] physical on the physical as well as the
[1:45:01] spiritual until you're ready until
[1:45:03] you're ready to surrender your life to
[1:45:06] God you're not going to be delivered
[1:45:08] from
[1:45:09] sin you got to die out to every desire
[1:45:13] of
[1:45:14] it right same thing with you with
[1:45:17] healing with Deliverance you got to come
[1:45:19] to that point is you know I I love God I
[1:45:22] love his word I don't want to live that
[1:45:27] way like I said and I've used Jonathan
[1:45:30] for example brother Jonathan come time
[1:45:32] after time I want to give up these
[1:45:34] cigarettes I want to give up these
[1:45:35] cigarettes and he never could give them
[1:45:39] up finally one day he said to me you
[1:45:42] know why I can't give up them cigarettes
[1:45:45] I said why cuz I love
[1:45:48] them brother Tim I love the way they
[1:45:51] make me feel oh I get a cigarette after
[1:45:55] my meal oh I love it I love it brother
[1:45:58] DM I love it I said and it's killing
[1:46:01] you it's destroying your
[1:46:06] life and I said until you hate those
[1:46:09] cigarettes and you love God more than
[1:46:11] you love those cigarettes you will never
[1:46:13] be
[1:46:16] delivered amen what was it with the
[1:46:19] maniac well brother brandom made the
[1:46:21] spirit be subdued
[1:46:23] but he didn't cast it out of him he said
[1:46:25] he loves that Spirit he worships it and
[1:46:29] and and I want you to say as long as you
[1:46:33] worship as long as you worship that
[1:46:38] thing oh you know you get people all the
[1:46:40] time they pull it out oh see my
[1:46:44] scars see see where I've been hurt see
[1:46:48] what people did to me see what see my
[1:46:51] and they glory in their
[1:46:54] scars they glory in their past and
[1:46:57] they're not willing to move on past
[1:47:02] it well I I need to talk about it well
[1:47:05] talk it over with God give it to him
[1:47:07] Surrender Your Life let him take it out
[1:47:09] of
[1:47:10] you and you'll not glorify that thing
[1:47:15] anymore
[1:47:17] amen I you know I I well this is the way
[1:47:20] I was raised and this is why I'm this
[1:47:22] way and oh come on the reason you're the
[1:47:26] way that you are is because you choose
[1:47:28] to be the way you
[1:47:30] are you have a
[1:47:35] choice well people did this to me okay
[1:47:38] but you have a choice
[1:47:40] now well my daddy okay but it's your
[1:47:45] turn well I'm codependent because of
[1:47:49] them no you are what you are because of
[1:47:52] your children voice you don't want to
[1:47:54] move past
[1:47:55] it let God heal you of your past and
[1:47:59] move forward into God's future for
[1:48:09] you heals a rewarder of those that
[1:48:11] diligently seek
[1:48:13] him but you run looking for somebody
[1:48:16] with another sympathetic ear to hear
[1:48:18] your problem listen you you know all you
[1:48:21] are doing is feeding and worshiping that
[1:48:23] thing Let It Go move past
[1:48:28] it well things happen to me this is not
[1:48:31] the
[1:48:34] Millennium this is where we're
[1:48:37] Overcomers and God didn't allow anything
[1:48:40] in your life that is too big for his
[1:48:42] Spirit to move and overcome through
[1:48:45] you it was given to you to
[1:48:48] overcome rise up above
[1:48:51] it so I well then Surrender Your Life to
[1:48:54] him and you
[1:48:56] can amen so you know again Edison tried
[1:48:59] wire after wire and finally he found a
[1:49:02] wire that would light it had to be
[1:49:04] something was something inside of it
[1:49:06] told him this is this
[1:49:09] work everybody else you
[1:49:13] know would criticize make fun of him but
[1:49:17] he just go on through the night trying
[1:49:20] this trying that trying that to finally
[1:49:22] he found
[1:49:23] something now brother brandham Likens
[1:49:27] himself to Edison and he says I've been
[1:49:30] on a
[1:49:32] search and he said now brother sister
[1:49:34] you can call me a fanatic if you want to
[1:49:37] but I know there's a power of
[1:49:39] God first thing because God said
[1:49:43] so that ought to settle it right God
[1:49:46] said so amen second thing because in my
[1:49:50] heart I know there's something in there
[1:49:53] that says that there's a power of God to
[1:49:55] heal every sickness and I believe it and
[1:49:59] as long as I believe that I'll spend my
[1:50:01] life that I know it's the truth it's
[1:50:04] God's word verse and there's something
[1:50:05] in my heart telling me it's there and
[1:50:08] I'm searching every wire everywhere
[1:50:11] trying to find a place that we can get
[1:50:14] it into church Fanatics may rise and go
[1:50:17] but you'll see the day when the Church
[1:50:19] of Jesus Christ will stand to its feet
[1:50:22] with this great power that they're
[1:50:24] laughing at us about today it'll be
[1:50:26] brought forth just like electricity was
[1:50:29] because there's something down in the
[1:50:31] human heart that says it's there is the

[1:54:53] amen I just push out toward it and
[1:54:56] brother brandham said it like
[1:54:59] this if God loved you enough to bring
[1:55:02] you out of sin and filled you with the
[1:55:05] Holy Ghost what's the matter with you
[1:55:08] poor spineless weaklings around the
[1:55:10] country won't he much more deliver you
[1:55:13] from your afflictions when he promised

[1:55:22] we be spineless weaking after God
[1:55:25] brought to us such a word with such a
[1:55:28] display of the power of God and
[1:55:33] restoration the power is not
[1:55:35] coming the power is within
[1:55:39] you you you you're waiting for a a a
[1:55:43] certain surge a certain thing a certain
[1:55:46] but the power is there acts: 18 but you
[1:55:49] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:55:53] is come upon you in Luke 24:49 I send
[1:55:58] the promise of my father upon you but
[1:56:00] tear you in the city of Jerusalem until
[1:56:02] you be endued with power from on high so
[1:56:06] if you have the Holy Ghost the same
[1:56:08] power that raised Jesus from the dead
[1:56:12] dwells within you amen it will also
[1:56:15] Quicken or make alive your mortal body
[1:56:19] that power that you have within you
[1:56:22] from a boy hearing this quote of brother
[1:56:25] brandom listening to this it just always
[1:56:27] stirred my heart let me share it with
[1:56:29] you today he said that power that you
[1:56:32] have in you
[1:56:33] now could make a new
[1:56:37] world Amen God doesn't have little weak
[1:56:40] spots and big heavy spots that that's
[1:56:43] powerful the least little touch of God
[1:56:46] is
[1:56:47] omnipotent the least little touch of God
[1:56:50] I'm trying to get you into faith now
[1:56:53] then again in in everpresent waters he
[1:56:57] says if we're born again of the spirit
[1:57:00] of God God doesn't have little weak
[1:57:02] parts and big strong Parts he's allog
[1:57:06] together God that's right if you had
[1:57:10] enough God in you till it was just
[1:57:13] barely a shadow that's enough power to
[1:57:16] make a new Earth
[1:57:20] right that's enough power to make a new
[1:57:24] moon and a new system Solar
[1:57:28] System it's God and it's strong and
[1:57:30] right now and every believer in here
[1:57:33] that has eternal life which is God's
[1:57:35] spirit in you there is enough power that
[1:57:38] will raise up the dead that'll heal the
[1:57:40] sick that'll set orbits into
[1:57:42] conditions it's controlled by law it's
[1:57:45] the spirit that Spirit that's in you
[1:57:47] your sons and daughters of God the same
[1:57:49] spirit that you got in you will raise
[1:57:51] yourself up the day of Resurrection
[1:57:54] am amen
[1:57:57] so and brother brandom said the power is
[1:57:59] there that's what it can
[1:58:02] do how do we know that because the power
[1:58:05] of God made the universe it made the
[1:58:08] world it made the
[1:58:10] moon everything you see came from the
[1:58:13] power of that omnipotent
[1:58:15] God are you with me so we know then the
[1:58:19] power if God is in you then that power
[1:58:23] can make a new world we're living proof
[1:58:25] on it we got a we got an earth that
[1:58:28] we're living
[1:58:30] on amen amen
[1:58:34] now again but there's a law to
[1:58:39] that that Sons and Daughters would
[1:58:42] create a new world and go and live a
[1:58:46] private life on
[1:58:48] it you have the power in it if you got a
[1:58:51] shadow of the power of God in you you
[1:58:53] have the power to do it God is
[1:58:55] omnipotent that power is in you you can
[1:58:58] speak a world in its existence and go
[1:59:00] live on it Hallelujah there you are
[1:59:03] that's what the power is in the church
[1:59:04] now but it's controlled by a
[1:59:07] law and the law is not keeping a bunch
[1:59:10] of Commandments it's a law of
[1:59:13] faith and Jesus said all things are
[1:59:15] possible to them that believe and if you
[1:59:17] can believe it whatever listen to this
[1:59:20] carefully whatever God will lead your
[1:59:23] soul to believe that is
[1:59:27] yours amen every place The Souls of your
[1:59:30] foot can set upon by faith God gives it
[1:59:33] to you it's yours you possess it if you
[1:59:35] can find the key to this law of faith
[1:59:39] that opens it to you so you see the if
[1:59:43] you're son or daughter of God that never
[1:59:46] leaves it's within you all the time but
[1:59:48] your faith gets away from you but it's
[1:59:50] still there
[1:59:52] so the power the power that raised
[1:59:55] Lazarus up is still here
[1:59:59] today amen the power that took took men
[2:00:03] a young man that was there had a chain
[2:00:07] around his neck and and was on all fours
[2:00:09] and was not in his right mind and and
[2:00:12] did tricks you know for for money in
[2:00:14] Africa and and there when when brother
[2:00:17] brandham prayed for him saw him by
[2:00:20] Vision picked him up by the chur p and
[2:00:22] as he did every bone in his body
[2:00:26] cracked as they all went back into
[2:00:29] place mou form
[2:00:34] bones is somebody with me amen that was
[2:00:38] the power of God Amen if you don't
[2:00:41] believe that how are you going to
[2:00:43] believe that you that one day gray hair
[2:00:45] is going to come back the right color
[2:00:47] wrinkles will fall off your face old age
[2:00:50] you'll become young again if you can't
[2:00:53] believe that you can't believe
[2:00:55] this are you with me but that power is
[2:00:59] still
[2:01:01] here that power didn't leave because
[2:01:04] brother Bram left the angel of God
[2:01:07] didn't leave because brother brandham
[2:01:08] left amen the Holy Ghost didn't leave
[2:01:11] because brother brandham left amen we
[2:01:14] are here and the word that says greater
[2:01:18] is he that is in you than he that is in
[2:01:20] the world is right right now resident in
[2:01:23] The Bride of Jesus
[2:01:25] Christ hallelujah it's enough power to
[2:01:30] make a new world now are you going to
[2:01:33] make a new world no because why the law
[2:01:37] of God keeps us from making a new
[2:01:43] world now but the power is
[2:01:47] there now again Israel couldn't say I
[2:01:52] tell you what we're in The Possession
[2:01:54] mood glory to God anything we ask for
[2:01:58] we're going to get glory to God
[2:02:00] hallelujah we're more than conquerors I
[2:02:03] tell you what Esau you got some pretty
[2:02:04] land there we're going to take it and
[2:02:05] God said no that ain't
[2:02:08] yours I didn't give you
[2:02:11] that well glory to God I tell you we're
[2:02:14] more than conquerors and amen we got a
[2:02:16] pillar of fire over us and a prophet why
[2:02:18] don't we just take Egypt over and live
[2:02:20] right here well Israel Egypt no that's
[2:02:23] not your Promised
[2:02:26] Land The power was there to bring Mighty
[2:02:31] Egypt to its
[2:02:33] knees but the law the word was not given
[2:02:37] to possess the land of
[2:02:40] Egypt now Jesus said it I do only what I
[2:02:46] see of my
[2:02:47] father what he leads me what he permits
[2:02:50] me to do and he says I'm not here to do
[2:02:54] my own
[2:02:56] will but to do the will of him that sent
[2:03:00] me so now you know again this is where
[2:03:05] at the tomb of Lazarus John 11:37 John
[2:03:09] 11:37 some of them said could not this
[2:03:13] man which had Open the Eyes of the blind
[2:03:16] have caused that even this man should
[2:03:19] not have
[2:03:20] died the power was
[2:03:23] there but not the will of God to do it
[2:03:27] the will of God was for him to die be in
[2:03:31] the grave four days and to show God's
[2:03:33] power by
[2:03:36] Resurrection come on Amen and then Jesus
[2:03:40] said I go to wake
[2:03:42] him you see but he could not do it until
[2:03:46] it's
[2:03:48] time amen now watch watch this for a
[2:03:51] moment because we cannot deliver all
[2:03:55] nature until it's
[2:04:00] time even Jesus could not stop all death
[2:04:03] and dying here upon the
[2:04:05] Earth if he could have he should
[2:04:08] have but the plan and purpose of God had
[2:04:10] not been
[2:04:12] fulfilled right P have called a halt
[2:04:15] them to it all and none of us would have
[2:04:19] been
[2:04:20] born and we had to be born this way to
[2:04:22] be
[2:04:24] redeemed come on exactly so so the plan
[2:04:28] and purpose of God had not been
[2:04:30] fulfilled we we cannot curse the Harlot
[2:04:36] system and and them vanish into
[2:04:41] Oblivion they have a purpose to
[2:04:44] fulfill so you know that's why in the
[2:04:46] Bible there are
[2:04:48] plagues that are stirred up yeah
[2:04:52] and vessels are they're called vials
[2:04:54] seven vials have you ever read them in
[2:04:56] the in the Bible in the Book of
[2:04:57] Revelation seven vials and they're bows
[2:05:00] they're they're held up
[2:05:02] judgments and they're poured out in the
[2:05:04] tribulation period why was these thored
[2:05:07] up in them vials and and these bows all
[2:05:11] these years because down Through the
[2:05:14] Ages God heard every time that that
[2:05:19] whole system was cursed and so saints
[2:05:22] were
[2:05:23] dying and judgment was pulled down upon
[2:05:27] them amen but he could not wipe it out
[2:05:30] then it is spoken to be a part of the
[2:05:33] end
[2:05:34] time it's got a part to fulfill somebody
[2:05:37] with me so God put it in
[2:05:41] vials and held it up to be poured out in
[2:05:45] the
[2:05:46] tribulation amen amen now so again there
[2:05:51] there are things that it must be working
[2:05:54] toward the law of God and of course one
[2:05:57] of the laws of God is
[2:06:00] faith faith is a revelation of the will
[2:06:03] of God now but the power is here it just
[2:06:06] to be harest brother Bram would say the
[2:06:09] power of the resurrecting Christ this
[2:06:12] morning is right here in the building to
[2:06:13] save every sinner to fill with the Holy
[2:06:17] Ghost and to heal every sickness that is
[2:06:20] in the world if you just know the right
[2:06:24] wire that leads to it
[2:06:27] amen
[2:06:29] Franklin when he got that kite string
[2:06:32] and it was wet through that water wet
[2:06:36] string it flowed down there and he felt
[2:06:39] it and he says I got it I got
[2:06:43] it he didn't know what he
[2:06:45] had and he didn't know how to use what
[2:06:47] he had he just knew he had it and that's
[2:06:51] what way many Christians are today they
[2:06:53] get saved oh yeah amen Jesus forgives
[2:06:56] your sins you say I got it but you don't
[2:06:58] know what you got and that's as far as
[2:07:01] Franklin took it you see but what was
[2:07:03] God doing he was with Franklin he about
[2:07:05] to reveal the world electricity and he
[2:07:08] said you know that's the way they get
[2:07:11] you know they they're blessing they they
[2:07:15] they believe we got it you know
[2:07:17] Salvation is here the power is here but
[2:07:20] now they don't know how to harness it
[2:07:22] how to use it how to make it
[2:07:25] work now one thing about it is that
[2:07:31] requires to make it work is the right
[2:07:33] atmosphere that's right amen even them
[2:07:37] in the upper room they got in one mind
[2:07:40] and one Accord what does that tell you
[2:07:42] to get the Holy Ghost for the power to
[2:07:45] come for the power to flow that had to
[2:07:49] get in one mind and one Accord
[2:07:52] now they still disagreed about who who
[2:07:55] whether Rome should rule or this should
[2:07:57] Rule and or whether the sades are right
[2:07:59] or the or whatever they were Jews they
[2:08:01] were
[2:08:03] human amen that was not one mind and one
[2:08:06] Accord what they were one mind and one
[2:08:08] Accord was God made a
[2:08:12] promise amen he said we were to receive
[2:08:14] power he told us to wait here in the
[2:08:17] upper room until it come and it's coming
[2:08:20] and we're all agreeing it's coming we're
[2:08:23] all in agreement he's going to pour it
[2:08:25] out and they got to blessing God before
[2:08:29] it even came and while they were
[2:08:32] blessing God the power
[2:08:34] came and I'll tell you what when the
[2:08:37] atmosphere gets right in the
[2:08:39] church amen when people start believing
[2:08:42] my God can do anything my God is here
[2:08:46] with his power but he's more than here
[2:08:48] with his power we have access to that
[2:08:51] power power we have access to the throne
[2:08:53] of grace and we begin to praise God
[2:08:56] before we even see anything
[2:09:00] happen Hallelujah the atmosphere get
[2:09:06] right Faith begins to rise as the word
[2:09:09] is
[2:09:09] preached amen and a man like Jason tiger
[2:09:12] a slave to a cigarette walks out
[2:09:16] free Hallelujah and you can walk out
[2:09:20] free may not be cigarettes it may be a
[2:09:23] habit it may be sickness it may be sin
[2:09:26] it may be a vice it doesn't matter what
[2:09:28] it is there is nothing too big for this
[2:09:31] God and when we get in the atmosphere of
[2:09:34] believing then all things are possible
[2:09:37] when we
[2:09:40] believe so when faith is
[2:09:43] preached amen then the atmosphere gets
[2:09:47] right so you
[2:09:49] say wellow brother Tim they were there
[2:09:51] in that upper room and bless God I mean
[2:09:53] they were blessing him and but the Holy
[2:09:55] Ghost has already come and it can't fall
[2:09:58] like that anymore you just can't have a
[2:10:02] an experience like that today because it
[2:10:04] already came you see and once it came
[2:10:06] well then you don't do it that way no
[2:10:09] more cuz it's already
[2:10:12] come well let me help your theology
[2:10:16] out just a little bit
[2:10:22] let's go let's remember right after
[2:10:27] Pentecost there's a mighty Miracle takes
[2:10:29] place there's a crippled man at the gate
[2:10:31] called
[2:10:32] beautiful and he gets
[2:10:35] healed so I'm going to take you down to
[2:10:37] the scripture let's just see now this is
[2:10:39] after the upper room experience let's
[2:10:40] see if it can happen again acts
[2:10:44] 4:18 and
[2:10:45] they scribes Pharisees called them
[2:10:49] commanded them not to speak at all or
[2:10:51] teach in the name of Jesus that's right
[2:10:53] but when Peter and John answered and
[2:10:56] said unto them whether it be right in
[2:10:58] the site of God to hearken to you
[2:11:01] whether it be right to in the sight of
[2:11:03] God to hearken unto you more than God
[2:11:05] you judge that that's right verse 21
[2:11:09] they said they but so when they had
[2:11:11] further threatened him they let him go
[2:11:14] and finding nothing how they might
[2:11:16] punish them because of the people
[2:11:19] because all men glorified God for that
[2:11:21] which was
[2:11:22] done verse 23 and being let go they went
[2:11:26] to their own company and reported all
[2:11:29] that the chief priests and Elders had
[2:11:30] said to
[2:11:32] them watch now and when they heard that
[2:11:36] they lifted up their voice to God
[2:11:39] with one Accord here we get it back
[2:11:42] again the atmosphere got right and said
[2:11:45] Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven
[2:11:50] and Earth and to see and all that is in
[2:11:53] them and verse 29 and Lord behold their
[2:11:57] threatenings and Grant to thy servants
[2:12:00] that with all boldness they may speak
[2:12:02] Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand
[2:12:05] to heal and that signs and wonders may
[2:12:07] be done by the name of the holy Child
[2:12:10] Jesus and when they had prayed the place
[2:12:14] was shaken where they were assembled
[2:12:17] together and they were all filled with
[2:12:20] the Holy Ghost and they spake the word
[2:12:22] of God with
[2:12:24] [Applause]
[2:12:26] boldness Hallelujah listen when they got
[2:12:29] in one Accord
[2:12:30] again it happened again and if we get in
[2:12:34] the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost believe
[2:12:37] in all things is possible and begin to
[2:12:40] praise
[2:12:41] God Hallelujah in what not yes he can do
[2:12:45] it yes it's for me yes it's the hour yes
[2:12:49] Lord yes
[2:12:51] and when you get in people together in
[2:12:54] one mind and one Accord and the
[2:12:56] atmosphere gets
[2:12:59] right things
[2:13:02] happen when we
[2:13:04] believe they we're filled with the Holy
[2:13:07] Ghost listen to The Prophet oh couldn't
[2:13:11] we get in an atmosphere here that ever
[2:13:13] crippled ever blind every sick person
[2:13:16] everything always went Accord believing
[2:13:19] and all the sick I seen it last week in
[2:13:21] Wood
[2:13:23] River he said boy there wasn't a person
[2:13:25] left they just piled up the crutches the
[2:13:27] wheelchairs the Cs I was standing at the
[2:13:29] platform preaching like this and they
[2:13:31] began to rise up and throw them to the
[2:13:33] corners the atmosphere got
[2:13:36] right Hallelujah that was not with a
[2:13:39] hand laid on
[2:13:40] them that was not with a gift of
[2:13:43] discernment that was not of anything
[2:13:46] just preaching the word and the
[2:13:48] atmosphere got right and when they the
[2:13:51] atmosphere got right they threw away
[2:13:53] their
[2:13:54] crutches Hallelujah they threw away
[2:13:56] their cigarettes they threw away their
[2:13:58] dop they throw away everything come on
[2:14:00] Amen they walked right into the
[2:14:05] promise and he says oh God send an
[2:14:07] atmosphere that'll make it of one Accord
[2:14:09] let the power of God search down through
[2:14:12] the atmosphere gets right it'll open
[2:14:14] every
[2:14:15] clog the law of God will
[2:14:19] move now that's true true right now
[2:14:22] we're in need of gifts of healing
[2:14:24] workings of Miracles
[2:14:25] prophecy but one day the atmosphere that
[2:14:29] we're feeling this morning will get
[2:14:33] right and there will come a charge
[2:14:36] through our mortal bodies and the Holy
[2:14:38] Spirit will take the church in such
[2:14:40] control of divine love until the sick
[2:14:42] will be healed the blind will see and
[2:14:43] the lame will walk without hands being
[2:14:45] laid on them and we'll be changed in a
[2:14:48] moment a twinkl of an eye
[2:14:52] and friends that's when all gifts will
[2:14:54] be laid on the
[2:14:56] shelves when we change our bodies we
[2:15:00] won't need them no
[2:15:01] more we won't need prophecy we won't
[2:15:04] need Gifts of healings or workings of
[2:15:06] miracles in our new
[2:15:08] bodies but as long
[2:15:10] as as long as we're here we need
[2:15:16] them
[2:15:17] amen so brother brandham said in the
[2:15:20] message speak to this mountain now you
[2:15:22] know he saw now that scripture greater
[2:15:25] than these become take even more meaning
[2:15:28] because up to this time he uses the that
[2:15:32] you know verely verely I say unto you
[2:15:34] the works that I do shall he do also and
[2:15:36] greater than these shall he do because I
[2:15:38] grow to my father and he would say well
[2:15:39] it's greater because there's more he's
[2:15:42] now in a
[2:15:44] multi a multimember body and so there's
[2:15:48] more and it can happen around the world
[2:15:50] all simp simultaneously his body in
[2:15:52] Africa his body here body everywhere and
[2:15:55] God
[2:15:56] working and God enlarged
[2:16:00] that
[2:16:01] because after the squirrels were
[2:16:05] created where he saw and and I don't
[2:16:08] have time to go into all of that but you
[2:16:10] know where he just spoke and there was a
[2:16:12] squirrel
[2:16:13] appeared just by the because as he was
[2:16:17] contemplating these scriptures and God
[2:16:20] wanted to show us the power of this
[2:16:24] word that he watched in it as he said
[2:16:27] you know let there come a young squirrel
[2:16:30] and sit on that Sycamore limb and there
[2:16:32] it was let there come one and those
[2:16:35] briers right over there and there was
[2:16:37] another let there come another and run
[2:16:39] out on this Leaf instead right there
[2:16:41] there was
[2:16:43] another right amen the power of creation
[2:16:47] and after he saw that power of creation
[2:16:51] that was working this side of the
[2:16:55] atonement where that whatever you
[2:16:58] say shall be done you say to this
[2:17:03] mountain and here he is told to say it
[2:17:06] and he said it and creation was done by
[2:17:11] the words of a prophet of God by a man
[2:17:14] of God a Son of God can I say it that
[2:17:18] way and brother brandham comes along and
[2:17:20] he said
[2:17:21] now Greater
[2:17:23] Works because when Jesus did Works he
[2:17:27] took bread and multiplied it and made
[2:17:30] more bread he took fishes and made more
[2:17:33] fishes off of that fish but this was
[2:17:37] created out of nothing it was Greater
[2:17:46] Works now then he comes and he says I
[2:17:50] believe that the Church of the Living
[2:17:52] God is moving into a
[2:17:55] spear now that's going to shake the
[2:17:57] whole world the first time it's been
[2:18:00] since the days of Jesus of Nazareth into
[2:18:02] a human being ask anything you will and
[2:18:05] it shall be given to you anything you
[2:18:06] desire don't you see the words of Jesus
[2:18:08] Christ being fulfilled and it's going to
[2:18:11] come to pass s pretty soon I'm I'm
[2:18:13] looking for it to happen in this meeting
[2:18:15] I'm wanting it to happen now that that
[2:18:17] anointing will strike the whole Church
[2:18:19] of the Living God and she'll rise to her
[2:18:21] feet like a mighty marching Army the
[2:18:24] sick will be healed by word the blind
[2:18:27] will see the death will hear the dead
[2:18:30] will be raised up and the power of God
[2:18:32] will shake the world with the Church of
[2:18:35] the Living God we're in the process of
[2:18:37] it now and I believe it's coming to pass
[2:18:39] I believe it will be just exactly that
[2:18:41] way I believe it's going to strike the
[2:18:43] Church of God soon and it's going to
[2:18:45] start a Revival that'll shake the world
[2:18:51] well what does that mean to you
[2:18:53] somebody's going to access the
[2:18:56] power
[2:18:58] amen amen I mean we got the power but
[2:19:03] our atmosphere gets twisted up some
[2:19:07] believing some doubting some questioning
[2:19:09] some accepting it we can ever get in one
[2:19:12] mind in one Accord it can happen it did
[2:19:15] it before it'll do it again we got a
[2:19:19] people that are taught right
[2:19:22] amen things will start happening because
[2:19:24] we'll create an
[2:19:26] atmosphere while in this place people
[2:19:29] are delivered in this people place
[2:19:31] people are saved in this place people
[2:19:34] are
[2:19:35] healed when we come together things
[2:19:38] happen and you come start coming with an
[2:19:41] expectancy that's right amen now again
[2:19:46] Thomas Edison wouldn't give up on it and
[2:19:49] brother bradam said himself he says you
[2:19:52] know I I I I'm doing everything I'm
[2:19:56] doing everything to find those wires I
[2:19:59] want to bring this down I'm trying to
[2:20:01] find a place to stop he said there's
[2:20:04] enough power in the
[2:20:08] room that to heal every sick person open
[2:20:12] every blinded eye unstop every dep ear
[2:20:15] make every lame man leap like a heart
[2:20:18] save every sinner Sanctified and filled
[2:20:21] with the Holy Ghost every believer he's
[2:20:23] here just as real as can be if you could
[2:20:26] just find the wire that brings that
[2:20:29] current to
[2:20:31] you again he says there's a power of the
[2:20:34] resurrected Christ to save every sinner
[2:20:37] filled with the Holy
[2:20:39] Ghost and and to heal every sickness
[2:20:42] that's in the world if you'll know the
[2:20:45] right wire that leads to
[2:20:47] it and he said it's love and faith
[2:20:51] that is the right
[2:20:56] wire now brother brand said I found the
[2:21:01] wires now electricity you know it kind
[2:21:04] of goes in in like a a circle you know
[2:21:07] it comes from here and then it goes back
[2:21:11] there it comes down into the appliance
[2:21:14] it runs back you have a a negative and a
[2:21:17] positive and so it runs down one line
[2:21:19] and back the other
[2:21:21] so it's a cycle that goes through so you
[2:21:24] have to have both you have to have two
[2:21:27] wires for it to complete the cycle some
[2:21:30] with me brother brandom is telling us
[2:21:32] there are two wires first of all you
[2:21:36] receive from God the love of God flows
[2:21:40] down into the human heart amen and
[2:21:43] causes him to believe and going back to
[2:21:46] God is
[2:21:49] Faith to believe every promise that he
[2:21:51] made that when a man or woman loves God
[2:21:56] right then they know that this God will
[2:22:00] not lie he will keep his word and so
[2:22:04] Faith turns back to God completing the
[2:22:07] cycle and brings healing to the
[2:22:12] church so he says I have found the two
[2:22:15] wires the conduit to make every promise
[2:22:18] of God come to pass and in the 20 years
[2:22:21] of research of the Bible and talking
[2:22:23] with the angel of the Lord and the many
[2:22:25] things I find there two things it's love
[2:22:27] and faith if you love God just purely
[2:22:31] unadulterated love you've got to have
[2:22:34] faith in him it'll accompany Faith every
[2:22:37] time so that the love of God can come
[2:22:39] from the nature of God into your heart
[2:22:43] from the
[2:22:44] source he first loved you if it'll come
[2:22:48] to you his love
[2:22:51] and you in turn believe back in
[2:22:56] him then Deliverance starts taking
[2:23:00] place you see brother brandham said in
[2:23:04] these 20 years if you love I found it he
[2:23:07] said if you love God with this purely
[2:23:09] unadulterated word you have our love you
[2:23:11] have got you have faith in him it'll
[2:23:14] company Faith every time when love and
[2:23:16] faith gets married you ask what you want
[2:23:19] to and you can have
[2:23:21] that's right and he said perfect faith
[2:23:25] in perfect Faith he said love and faith
[2:23:27] goes together they're kin folks they
[2:23:30] love love produces faith and when Satan
[2:23:34] tempts us we are to resist him with
[2:23:37] perfect faith in a perfect word like
[2:23:39] Jesus did the word of God is perfect and
[2:23:42] we have we're to have perfect faith in
[2:23:43] this perfect word and resist
[2:23:46] Satan watch these words when you know
[2:23:50] that that your heavenly father cannot
[2:23:52] tell you any
[2:23:57] lie he's God and he can lie and then you
[2:24:02] believe him with all your heart and you
[2:24:04] believe that what you ask for you ask
[2:24:06] for it for not with a selfish motive but
[2:24:09] you have the right motive behind it
[2:24:11] there to ask it for the glory of God and
[2:24:13] believe without a shouted doubt that
[2:24:15] your father would not lie to you
[2:24:17] something's going to take place once you
[2:24:20] get all the cuckle birds of hindrance
[2:24:22] out of the way and just look right
[2:24:24] straight there to Calvary and believe
[2:24:25] with all your
[2:24:27] heart so you see you see every one of
[2:24:30] you that he said that has got a soul
[2:24:33] when you go to believe it's that channel
[2:24:36] of faith and that's when the Holy Spirit
[2:24:38] will move in we don't take emotion now
[2:24:40] it takes faith and love Lord I love
[2:24:45] you so if you want to be healed or
[2:24:48] delivered
[2:24:50] get the love right
[2:24:59] first that's why I told you brother
[2:25:01] Jason forget about everything else do
[2:25:04] one thing fall in love with
[2:25:10] Jesus Oh you could talk about oh my
[2:25:12] scars and they hurt me and they did this
[2:25:14] and I tell you I've been wounded and I
[2:25:16] you can talk about all that just forget
[2:25:18] all of that do one thing get in love
[2:25:21] with
[2:25:27] Jesus any person that ever falls in love
[2:25:29] with
[2:25:32] Jesus there's a faith going to start
[2:25:35] coming back out of you toward him to
[2:25:37] start believing for
[2:25:41] deliverance knowing this that he he says
[2:25:45] when you go to believe and it's in that
[2:25:47] channel of faith and if you get with one
[2:25:50] Accord that's when the Holy Spirit will
[2:25:51] move in now what is one Accord it's one
[2:25:54] Accord with his
[2:25:57] word come
[2:25:59] on we we talk about oh we're we're going
[2:26:02] to all agree together no we're going to
[2:26:04] be one Accord with his
[2:26:08] word amen the power is here and he wants
[2:26:12] to do it he wants to heal every sick
[2:26:15] person he wants to deliver every lost
[2:26:18] person
[2:26:20] and when you begin to do that and it
[2:26:23] takes faith and love and you say Lord I
[2:26:26] love you and you can't lie because
[2:26:28] you're
[2:26:29] God I love you and love settles the
[2:26:32] whole thing when you love your wife with
[2:26:34] all your heart with all your soul you
[2:26:36] just love her there ain't nobody else in
[2:26:38] town could make you to believe she
[2:26:39] wasn't a good woman that's right same
[2:26:41] old tattletales will come to you you
[2:26:44] your husband ain't true when you really
[2:26:46] love him you got confidence in him see
[2:26:47] love covers it over that's right and
[2:26:49] when you love
[2:26:51] God all the fears just scatter
[2:26:54] everywhere and you just say God you're
[2:26:56] right I love you and I'm Healed and I'll
[2:26:58] just go on and take it that's what then
[2:27:00] everything can happen spontaneously if
[2:27:03] you just believe
[2:27:05] it but when you start doubting your
[2:27:07] lover well um but but they this old
[2:27:12] tattletale over here says no you don't
[2:27:15] do that anymore you say it's of
[2:27:17] yesterday or it's not for us today are
[2:27:20] we we're we're too deep in the message
[2:27:22] now to believe anymore you know we we
[2:27:25] got too much great understanding and
[2:27:27] we're higher than that we don't need
[2:27:29] anything from God when you go like that
[2:27:32] you'll never get anything but when you
[2:27:34] go to looking and you begin to see his
[2:27:37] word if it worked once it'll work again
[2:27:41] if it healed once it'll heal again if it
[2:27:44] delivered once it'll deliver again if it
[2:27:47] delivered one man from cigarettes it'll
[2:27:49] deliver another man
[2:27:50] even deliver come on somebody am
[2:27:53] whatever God's word
[2:27:57] said because you love him you believe it
[2:28:00] and you just say Lord I'm Healed you
[2:28:04] said it I just love you enough to
[2:28:07] believe I got it and I'm going to start
[2:28:10] acting like it come on now so brother
[2:28:13] Brandon said the only wi I know is love
[2:28:16] and faith the father can't lie and I
[2:28:18] love him and I faith in
[2:28:20] him so can't we love him and have faith
[2:28:23] in
[2:28:24] him our confidence our faith
[2:28:27] proves our love back to
[2:28:30] him
[2:28:33] now we
[2:28:35] know that electricity
[2:28:39] works so like I said you go in plug your
[2:28:43] iron go to iron the close before you
[2:28:46] come to church iron don't come on you
[2:28:49] don't just
[2:28:50] say there's no
[2:28:54] electricity now we do have a lot of
[2:28:56] Amish believers
[2:28:58] menites who agree it's there but we're
[2:29:01] not to have
[2:29:05] it and they want to stay with their
[2:29:07] horse and buggy and their
[2:29:10] lanterns and live in a primitive way and
[2:29:14] pretend they're oldtime Christians well
[2:29:16] if they was they would have the power
[2:29:17] like they did on the day of Pentecost
[2:29:23] so but when we have it then we real and
[2:29:27] we realize hey it ain't working then we
[2:29:30] go to say what's the
[2:29:32] matter you know we what what is plugged
[2:29:35] up says some Theology and I I want to
[2:29:38] get in this I'm going to take a whole
[2:29:40] sermon on the things that hinders it the
[2:29:43] things that will cause it to to not flow
[2:29:46] things that will keep you from crossing
[2:29:48] over you know if we but if you're really
[2:29:51] grounded in Christ and rooted in him
[2:29:53] with faith in God and you know you got
[2:29:56] those two wires that are coming you know
[2:29:58] it's going to pack the light of the
[2:30:00] Gospel so like I said you know would you
[2:30:03] would you stand out here and say cuz
[2:30:05] it's dark and you're screaming and
[2:30:06] trying to you know said well it don't
[2:30:09] work anymore there's no such thing as
[2:30:11] electricity no you go to work we know
[2:30:16] scientifically it's all been proven that
[2:30:20] electricity
[2:30:22] works you'd be stupid not to think
[2:30:26] it and scientifically if we want to say
[2:30:29] it that way spiritually we know it's
[2:30:32] here how could sister Atlanta be sitting
[2:30:34] here today after being given a notice of
[2:30:36] death with for stage fourth hot hodskins
[2:30:39] L
[2:30:41] lymphoma how oh you only God can do that
[2:30:44] come on you know that only the power of
[2:30:47] God I mean go from a full-blown

[2:34:33] a receiver it's a phone it's got an
[2:34:38] invisible current signal coming from
[2:34:41] somewhere Unseen World taking that in
[2:34:45] another world and transferring it to
[2:34:47] this world do I see this image and then
[2:34:50] my image sent back to that world states
[2:34:53] away miles away amen what what is it we
[2:34:57] we are living as a supernatural
[2:35:02] people that is not even natural anymore
[2:35:05] we have tapped into Realms of the Unseen
[2:35:10] realm amen until we are doing things
[2:35:13] that we we would be it would be out of
[2:35:16] people's mind they would think oh my
[2:35:19] we're gods or something you know 150
[2:35:23] years ago to where we are now we're
[2:35:26] doing things that was thought
[2:35:29] impossible but because there were men
[2:35:31] that would not give
[2:35:33] up there were men who would build on an
[2:35:37] idea amen that they would go until we're
[2:35:40] here and we've Advanced are you with me
[2:35:43] let me tell you friends if that is all
[2:35:45] true then the angels of God are
[2:35:48] here if it's not some way way somewhere
[2:35:51] else come on there's even another
[2:35:54] dimension that is turning faster than
[2:35:56] this one amen where the dead in Christ
[2:36:00] are and it's just as real as where we
[2:36:03] are amen and we we have we in this
[2:36:07] generation we have heard
[2:36:09] voices we have seen images we've had
[2:36:13] proof that that realm
[2:36:16] exists are you with me brother Brandon
[2:36:19] was say the angel of God is here I
[2:36:22] didn't see the angel of God but I knew
[2:36:24] he was there because he was doing things
[2:36:26] that man couldn't do he was Discerning
[2:36:30] hearts and calling out names and telling
[2:36:32] addresses of things a man cannot do I
[2:36:36] knew there was another
[2:36:39] realm because the receiver brought it
[2:36:43] visible it made me know it was there I
[2:36:46] think that electricity is invisible but
[2:36:49] I can PL something in and make it
[2:36:51] visible I know it's real it
[2:36:54] works and we have been given
[2:36:58] proof of that
[2:37:01] realm Hallelujah one day theop needs to
[2:37:04] be more real than even television or
[2:37:06] whatever they'll be right here we'll
[2:37:09] connect with them and be changed right
[2:37:11] now God is present in this
[2:37:15] room first his word said so
[2:37:20] first his word said so where two or more
[2:37:22] Gather in my name I'll be there so Jesus
[2:37:26] is here because his word said number one
[2:37:28] the word said it number two I've already
[2:37:31] felt it every once in a while I get a
[2:37:33] charge from
[2:37:34] it am man I get a there Comes A jolt and
[2:37:38] I know just like Franklin knew
[2:37:41] electricity was in the heaven he got a
[2:37:43] jol every once in a while I get a joke
[2:37:46] amen the anointing comes down the spirit
[2:37:48] begins to move
[2:37:50] things begin to flow that I don't even
[2:37:52] think about they're just coming out of
[2:37:54] my mouth why why is it because the
[2:37:57] unction of the Holy Ghost the power it's
[2:38:01] a world that we cannot see but angels of
[2:38:04] God are with us everywhere amen they're
[2:38:08] they're with us
[2:38:09] everywhere now men have built on the
[2:38:14] discoveries of
[2:38:17] Franklin Edison didn't think it's a
[2:38:20] discredit to Franklin to put electricity
[2:38:22] to work he built on
[2:38:25] his
[2:38:27] Discovery right amen other men didn't
[2:38:30] say well but that was only for Edison
[2:38:35] and for his time it's not time anymore
[2:38:39] for us to have electricity for us you
[2:38:42] see light bulbs was only for the
[2:38:45] initiation of of of the thought and the
[2:38:48] concept of electric electricity but it's
[2:38:50] not for us
[2:38:52] today we wouldn't do that would we no
[2:38:55] sir invention after invention was built
[2:38:57] upon his until today we have a entirely
[2:39:01] different world from what they lived in
[2:39:04] so somebody not only you know made a
[2:39:08] light bulb but had a string power to
[2:39:10] light up a
[2:39:12] city it went from a one little place one
[2:39:15] little bulb to lighten up an entire city
[2:39:18] amen and somebody figured it
[2:39:21] out way back in
[2:39:24] 1870 those of you Old-Timers with me
[2:39:27] been here for years and years you
[2:39:29] remember meeting in the old the old
[2:39:31] white church that we had there on White
[2:39:34] Oak Road then we'd build another one but
[2:39:37] anyway back then we had this old church
[2:39:39] had no electricity in
[2:39:42] it you know when it was originally built
[2:39:45] it had absolutely no
[2:39:47] electricity it was built in the
[2:39:50] 1870s it was not till
[2:39:54] 1940s that electricity came into the
[2:39:57] rural
[2:39:58] Louisiana you know what they did in for
[2:40:01] that church I want you to listen to
[2:40:03] their vision for
[2:40:05] electricity they held up they put up
[2:40:08] six light
[2:40:10] bulbs and one
[2:40:12] plugin one
[2:40:16] receptacle that was the all all that
[2:40:20] they knew to do with that
[2:40:26] power and when we arrived in
[2:40:30] 1972 that was just not enough for
[2:40:35] us we wanted more than one
[2:40:39] receptacle we wanted more than six light
[2:40:43] bulbs is somebody with me amen we want
[2:40:47] him running water
[2:40:49] we wanted flushing
[2:40:52] toilets you know all of this is provided
[2:40:54] by electricity we wanted air
[2:40:57] conditioners we wanted we wanted heat
[2:41:01] you know we were we were had an old old
[2:41:04] Barrel um uh 50-gallon drums set on the
[2:41:08] side with on a stand my Dad and brothers
[2:41:10] made a pipe out the door and you know
[2:41:14] burn wood in
[2:41:15] it and that
[2:41:17] was you know that was a Primitive
[2:41:19] Baptist building and we were
[2:41:22] primitive
[2:41:25] our it was no
[2:41:27] Nursery there was no nothing but an
[2:41:30] outdoor toilet that we
[2:41:33] made hole in the
[2:41:35] ground build a seat over the top of it
[2:41:38] close it in for privacy boy sides and
[2:41:40] girl
[2:41:42] side hole out the up top you know
[2:41:47] for for the
[2:41:52] ventilation yeah for other things
[2:41:56] too you know little Brian Middleton was
[2:41:58] our one of our first babies born and
[2:42:01] dedicated there after gai
[2:42:04] died and it was always something you
[2:42:06] know with our open Windows our open
[2:42:08] doors I preached and it was like an
[2:42:11] outdoor meeting the big doors open on
[2:42:14] each side they every window open no
[2:42:17] screens you know oh yeah so you actually
[2:42:22] ate a lot of bugs when you
[2:42:24] preached no no amplifier no nothing no
[2:42:31] PA here you are no Nursery sisa goes out
[2:42:36] with misbehaving Brian Wags him outside
[2:42:39] picks a switch off the off the off the
[2:42:42] tree and that window for ventilation
[2:42:45] next time becomes a Escape Route for all
[2:42:47] the leaves that's right we had
[2:42:50] entertainment at our
[2:42:52] church but you know when we we got there
[2:42:55] you know we we decided we wanted more
[2:43:00] than what we had we knew there was more
[2:43:02] available and more use for this
[2:43:07] power amen so we wanted elect we wanted
[2:43:10] we wanted 220 we want to be able to run
[2:43:12] a air conditioner we wanted we wanted
[2:43:15] heat in the building we wanted all all
[2:43:18] kinds of light and things and and PA
[2:43:21] equipment and things like that we wanted
[2:43:23] we wanted it all we had a greater vision
[2:43:26] and we built on that primitive situation
[2:43:29] I'm trying to make a point here but we
[2:43:31] do it
[2:43:33] backwards we say old brother Brandon
[2:43:35] found the wires to healing but we better
[2:43:38] not Venture into his field we better not
[2:43:41] use what he had you know that was for
[2:43:42] another season we we have the word now
[2:43:45] and I tell you what instead of the word
[2:43:48] many people got dead theology that won't
[2:43:50] work remember the words that brother
[2:43:52] Brandon preached
[2:43:54] worked it had power with
[2:43:57] it amen I would say that brother Brandon
[2:43:59] would say build on what I
[2:44:02] brought amen there should be more
[2:44:05] healing more
[2:44:07] Deliverance more Angelic visitation more
[2:44:10] power of God not
[2:44:12] less well we got the full word now then
[2:44:15] with it should come to full power
[2:44:20] it's like when I went to
[2:44:21] Uganda I went to Uganda and I went to
[2:44:26] well we preached way out in the country
[2:44:27] in The Boondocks for sure but I went to
[2:44:30] what was a beautiful Resort it was once
[2:44:32] a beautiful resort with beautiful oak
[2:44:35] trees or trees around it I'm not sure
[2:44:37] what all they were the varieties some of
[2:44:40] them had flowers and bl blossoms kind of
[2:44:42] like a mimosa tree but they be larger
[2:44:45] than that there was a park around
[2:44:47] it and and this it had a shell of a
[2:44:51] vision the of a building I mean the
[2:44:53] infrastructure was from way back in the
[2:44:56] day when the English ruled the
[2:45:00] country it had phones in every room oh
[2:45:05] it's
[2:45:06] modern but it would only call the
[2:45:11] office it would
[2:45:14] buz the office but it wouldn't call out
[2:45:17] of the hotel
[2:45:21] when we had to when we got a message
[2:45:24] with somebody driving miles over the
[2:45:26] mountain from Kenya coming across to
[2:45:28] tell us that somebody had died in our
[2:45:30] church then brother hilderbrandt and
[2:45:33] another brother drove like six hours
[2:45:36] down to another city to get to a phone
[2:45:40] booth that could call
[2:45:46] America and here we were in this
[2:45:49] beautiful Resort what once was a
[2:45:51] beautiful Resort and here I call I want
[2:45:56] to flush the toilet and I have to get a
[2:45:59] bucket to flush the toilet and I want a
[2:46:03] bath and they bring it in a Jerry jug
[2:46:06] the water for me to pour in my
[2:46:09] bathtub why why because you see they
[2:46:14] they had allowed things to deteriorate
[2:46:20] instead of going forward and having
[2:46:23] running water flushing toilet oh it was
[2:46:26] all there the plumbing was there the
[2:46:29] toilets was there the water pipes was
[2:46:32] there but you see they didn't have
[2:46:34] electricity no more to the pump and
[2:46:36] somebody had robbed the
[2:46:39] pump and now the thing has got all the
[2:46:44] structure and it looks like a nice
[2:46:47] resort but everything is
[2:46:51] broken what am I trying to say when
[2:46:54] brother Brenham left us amen if I can do
[2:46:58] it in the type of that we had a place
[2:47:00] that
[2:47:01] worked amen there was flesh and toilets
[2:47:04] there was lights there was bath water
[2:47:07] there was showers there was everything
[2:47:09] it worked it was
[2:47:11] beautiful but men have got along and
[2:47:13] some have stolen the
[2:47:16] liines some have robbed it out and
[2:47:18] blocked it up with theology until many
[2:47:21] times it don't
[2:47:23] work but I'm here to tell you friends
[2:47:26] amen God didn't intend for it to be that
[2:47:29] way and us to go
[2:47:31] backward Hallelujah God intends us to go
[2:47:34] forward if it worked once it'll work
[2:47:37] again if you healed once he'll heal
[2:47:40] again if you delivered one then he'll
[2:47:42] delivered now if be saved oh Hallelujah
[2:47:45] it be filled once with the Holy Ghost
[2:47:48] then he'll fill him with the Holy Ghost
[2:47:56] now like the Church of the Church of
[2:47:59] Sardis thou Hast a name that you live
[2:48:02] but you're
[2:48:05] dead listen we have found salvation that
[2:48:08] will save us from sin take the violence
[2:48:11] drunken prostitute and make him a child
[2:48:13] of God do you know that's being
[2:48:15] lost I had a brother called me this week
[2:48:18] and he said brother him I'm dealing with
[2:48:20] a brother that he's got some issues in
[2:48:23] his life he went to a message preacher
[2:48:25] that you know sat down with him and he
[2:48:27] took a book of psychology and he said
[2:48:30] there he's reading this book of
[2:48:31] psychology to him Page by Page and
[2:48:34] trying to pin his problems on his mom
[2:48:36] and his dad and other people and
[2:48:37] bringing all kinds of division and hurt
[2:48:40] in the family and said what should I do
[2:48:42] I said tell him to be born
[2:48:44] again I think what we got is backsliding
[2:48:47] preachers who are going out they don't
[2:48:49] know psychology they've never been to
[2:48:52] school and learned psychology would you
[2:48:54] let me as I said would you let me take a
[2:48:58] and me read up on your liver problem and
[2:49:02] me read up on it and do surgery on you
[2:49:04] in the
[2:49:05] morning no if I read a book on liver
[2:49:08] problems and how to do surgery and what
[2:49:11] to fix it would you trust
[2:49:14] me would you want me to be your doctor
[2:49:17] no you wouldn't want me me to be your
[2:49:19] doctor I might have book learning book
[2:49:22] knowledge I might have read about it but
[2:49:24] I don't know a thing about how to make
[2:49:25] it
[2:49:27] happen come on now I'm trying to get a
[2:49:29] point to you amen you take a man he
[2:49:33] wants to stand there and give you a book
[2:49:34] of psychology he didn't go to school for
[2:49:37] that he didn't learn anything about that
[2:49:39] he read a book or two about it he's as
[2:49:41] dumb as a box of
[2:49:43] rocks amen don't you let it mess with
[2:49:45] your mind don't you let message
[2:49:48] preachers mess with your mind with some
[2:49:50] psychology when there is a God who will
[2:49:54] work in the spirit realm and will heal
[2:49:57] you of your problem and deliver you from
[2:49:59] your
[2:50:02] sin Hallelujah I'm talking about the
[2:50:05] power of God under salvation I'm talking
[2:50:07] about a gospel that a
[2:50:10] work I don't know anything about a liver
[2:50:14] problem but I know things about a heart
[2:50:16] problem and I got a solution for your
[2:50:19] heart problem it's a sin problem and if
[2:50:22] I can get you to turn to God God will
[2:50:24] heal that heart and set you on fire for
[2:50:27] God and set your affections on things
[2:50:31] above
[2:50:33] Hallelujah but you got to get those
[2:50:35] wires moving in the right direction
[2:50:38] connected to God and God is love and let
[2:50:41] his love flow down in your heart and
[2:50:43] then as you love him you believe his
[2:50:45] word and it acts back toward him and it
[2:50:48] works
[2:50:49] [Applause]
[2:50:51] and it beats out he of say yesterday
[2:50:53] today is whatever I'm the Lord God that
[2:50:55] heals you of all th diseases amen I am
[2:50:58] he that was and will come amen I am that
