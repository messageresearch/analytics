Description:
Bro. Tim Pruitt ministers on "The People of the Book, Part 120 (The Lord is a Man of War)" on Sunday, May 16th, 2021 at Evening Light Tabernacle. For information, service archives, and more, please visit the church website at www.eveninglight.net

We welcome you to visit us during any of our services. We believe in taking the Scriptures for what they say and presenting Jesus Christ—not only in our teachings and in our services—but , most importantly, in our lives. We believe that all Christians must have a new birth whereby their nature is changed into the very image of Christ Himself. We are living in the last space of time allotted to the Gentile age before Christ’s return. Hence, the name, Evening Light Tabernacle, for we truly are at the evening time. However, the Scriptures contain the promise that at the evening time, there shall be light

Lo invitamos a visitarnos durante cualquiera de nuestros servicios. Creemos en tomar las Escrituras por lo que dicen y presentar a Jesucristo, no solo en nuestras enseñanzas y en nuestros servicios, sino, lo más importante, en nuestras vidas. Creemos que todos los cristianos deben tener un nuevo nacimiento mediante el cual su naturaleza se transforma en la imagen misma de Cristo mismo. Estamos viviendo en el último espacio de tiempo asignado a la era de los gentiles antes del regreso de Cristo. De ahí el nombre, Evening Light Tabernacle, porque realmente estamos a la hora de la tarde. Sin embargo, las Escrituras contienen la promesa de que al anochecer habrá luz

15 as we look into the word amen it's good to have each one that is assembled with us and then i understand that the the mobley family is here from around beaumont area visiting today and we see we see the lowry's here today we welcome you and brother brother and sister stanky you made it back sandra that's good see you in service today is wonderful to be in the house of the lord together all of you that's assembled in the wonderful name of the lord jesus i hope you've come to lift that name high today amen to give him the praise that is due his name and that not just in church that we do that but every day of our lives we surrender ourselves to him to serve him exodus chapter 15 verse 1 then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spake saying i was singing to the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath the throne into the sea the lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my god and i will prepare him a habitation my father is god and i will exalt him the lord is a man of war the lord is his name amen god bless you can be seated that's what we're going to be speaking on this morning is the lord is a man of war and that word lord there in the in the original in the hebrew is actually jehovah jehovah is a man of war and jehovah is his name and then the very name jehovah is implied to all might and all power and so necessarily the strength to prevail in battle and in psalms 24 it says who is the king of glory the lord is strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle and then isaiah 42 and 13 said the lord goes forth like a mighty one and he stirs up zeal like a warrior he shouts yes he roars and triumphs over his enemies so god is showing himself as a man of war and he did this in moses day and the book of revelation before the book closes before that he completes the revelation that he gives to john he shows that he is still the man of war in revelation 19 and 11 and i saw heaven open and behold the white horse and him that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he that judge and make war so he made war then he makes war now and in the final scene before the millennium we just read about here he comes as a god who makes war exodus 14 14 israel was instructed the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace this scene it opens with the children of israel who were entrapped at the red sea and and their god is reassuring them that he will personally fight for them that they are not in this alone that they are not going through this by themselves israel was not a nation of warriors they had never been trained to fight israel was a bunch of slaves that had just been uh just been set free from their bondage and and of course this this scene opens with the children of israel entrapped and at the red sea and god is telling them you know i'm going to do the fighting for you and and in exodus 23 23 he had told him i will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thy adversaries for my angels shall go before thee and bring thee in and what a comfort that ought to be to people today who have received a message that was brought to us by an angel amen that the angel of the covenant has gone up before us to bring us in that we have not had to walk in a in a in a path of of uh of of confusion but we have been able to walk in the very leadership of god and directed by the holy ghost to the very hour that we're in isn't it comforting to know that as the bible said that he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye now in moses day he showed himself as one who fights his people's battles and later in the generation after moses he was still showing that he was fighting for his people and i want to just assure you today that god is still a man of war he is still one who goes to war on the behalf of his children if he was ever an intercessor he's still an intercessor if he was ever a healer he's still a healer if he was ever delivered he still is a god of deliverance in joshua 23 and 9 even after moses had will pass off the scene um joshua could recount that the lord has driven out great and powerful nations before you and to this day no one can stand against you and one of you can put a thousand to flight because the lord your god fights for you just as he promised he would what a comfort what a word that this is especially in the hour that we're living in and and we know that even at the very day of the rapture we are in an hour of entrapment because the bible said that that we that we should pray that we would escape the things that are coming upon the earth so we know that we're surrounded that in the last day that all hell breaks loose against the bride of christ and and so therefore because of that we are entrapped we really can't perpetuate the ages the ages are over we cannot go back you know that is that is now behind us we can't go around it it is it is something we have to face and yet we can't face it so therefore the thing that we have to do is realize that there is a way out of this that we are been commanded to lift up our head when we see these things come to pass to lift up our head for our redemption draweth nigh amen so we're here in the hour where where our only way up is out of here amen our only escape the only way that we can give make it out of this the mess that we're in today that we find ourselves in the world in the world condition in society and the society's condition the only way out of this is is a rapture and we're here at a rapture hour now here the the five kings and the amorites had come against israel and you remember in the days of joshua that that uh as it came to pass as a as they were as they were fighting against those kings that the lord himself cast down great stones from heaven upon them upon aziac and and they died and there were still more that died with hailstones in whom the children of israel slew with the sword it shows again that god was fighting for israel it was at a time that joshua would command the sun to stand still and and if the bible would say of that day that there had never been one like it before or after it that the lord hearkened to the voice of a man and and for the lord fought for israel this is what it has been all down to history god has always fought our battles we're the children of the great most high god and he is here in this last day to fight our battles we can see that as he discerned the hearts as he made demons to flee as demons would tremble in his presence and begin to call on one another even as the prophet would discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and would tell of diseases and those diseases and sicknesses would begin to scream to one another and said come help me to get this one to um disbelief and they would try to band together but every time they were defeated because again the lord is mighty in battle amen now at the red sea where we find that he said the lord will fight for you and you will hold your peace only put your trust in god without grudging or doubting this is what it means hold your peace just just put your trust in god without grudging without doubting now it was here at the red sea that israel expressed their doubts and their fears and their unbelief you know it was here that they were complaining that they were here in the in the entrapment they were in the enemy coming behind them the mountains on the side the red sea in front of them and how could they ever get through and they were they began to scream and cry out and say because there were no grades in egypt has thou taken us to die in in the wilderness is it is it not this word that we told you in egypt sayeth let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it been better for us to serve the egyptian than us to die in the wilderness can you imagine here they were willing to trade their freedom amen to remain and be slaves down in egypt than to face what they were facing at that time and they were now expressing their doubts and their fears isn't that exactly what we do as humans i mean we get tested instead of trusting god we complain am i we we talk about uh we talk about our symptoms we talk about our problems we bemoan the fact that god hasn't answered and that we're still waiting on god and it seemed like he's a million miles away and my prayers are going up and they're empty or they're they're not even reaching the ceiling or whatever our thoughts are and that you know and we forget who we are in those moments we forget we are the sons of god and we forget that we're in a battle amen look at the unbelief that these people exhibited and and even when they got down to the border of the promised land down at cades barnea they're still the same thing as the same old vicious cycle god showed himself god god proven himself real god coming along and delivering them over and over and over again and yet they turn and they complain and they murmur and they doubt and by one moment they're on the mountaintop and they're shouting the victory in the next moment they're down in the valley and they're complaining about where they're at and i want you to know wherever you are right now you're not there alone there is a god that is concerned about you and your situation no matter how dire the situation is no matter nobody else has ever had it this bad or this situation has never been before or there's never been an age like this age and there's never been a problem like this problem but i want you to know god has shown himself god in every situation every age every time every problem he's never left his people fighting alone this is a god who pledges himself to his promise and i want you to remember as we look here in deuteronomy chapter 1 as moses recounts where they were at cadence barnea i want you to remember brother branham would bring a pentecost and say eurocades barnea he would bring and say the world is at cades barnea and i want to tell you we are right now at a time of crossing over don't make the cicadas barnea make this a time of going into the promise deuteronomy chapter 1 19 so we departed horeb and went through all the great and terrible wilderness which you saw on your way to the mountains of the amorites as the lord our god hath commanded then we came to kadesh barnea and i said to you you have come to the mountains of the amorites which the lord our god is giving us now notice this god is very clear through his prophet i am giving you this this is your mountain these are your promises amen this is your fruitful lamb and i'm giving it to you and i want you to know god has given you every great and special promise in his word he's given you healing he's giving you deliverance he gives the holy ghost he gives the power of god amen he gives a revelation of the word he will no good thing will he withhold from them who walk uprightly and he says the lord is giving this to you it's yours now look he says the lord your god has set the land before you go up and possess it and as the lord god of your father has spoken to you do not fear or be discouraged so he cautions them before the whole thing don't fear whatever you do god's given to you but your here's the instructions don't fear and don't be discouraged not on where you are today but neither one has a place in the bride of christ she is not a people of fear god has not given you the spirit of fear but a butt of love and a sound mind that sound mind is a disciplined mind a mind that has been trained to take down strongholds to pull down unbelief knowing that the mind is a battleground come on and every one of you will have your mind battles and every one of you will be the enemy will come like a dark evil spirit and haunt at you hey man as long as you're human and as long as you're in this flesh it did jesus amen the spirit walked her i didn't take jesus present here lucifer himself and and challenge his his sonship if thou be the son of god and the devil will come along and challenge your sonship if you were really a child of god this wouldn't happen if you were really a son of god this wouldn't take place you wouldn't have this battle you wouldn't have that problem [Music] now so you say he instructs do not fear how many how many people today are dealing with anxiety are anxious worried fearful troubled my the the medicine cabinets are full a people on anxiety pills worried about what's going to happen got to have something to calm their nerves there's trouble on every hand and you were told if it to conquer a promise of god to take a hold of one of god's promises you must not fear so of course the devil comes along and that's his weapon his fear he wants to come there you know in a hideous spirit come along hunt you hover over you do you know what's he doing trying to hold you in slavery trying to keep you from prop from the promise of god amen now so he says do not fear or be discouraged now here in israel came to the edge of the promised land and we can say this you know right be that we are right here before the rapture and and we're here and we we know our land lays just ahead amen oh my it's a wonderful land that lays right ahead hey man there's a new body laying ahead there's every every wonderful thing that sublime as brother branham would say can't match it no word can describe it it's it's totally uh indescribable you you can't can't even draw word pictures to be able to say what it's going to be like and we're right there on the border of it and now let's go back here for a moment and see these people that were right on the border and let's hear what these men had to say because it was though they were not sure that what god said was really right in exodus 3 and 8 i want to remind you what god had already told them exodus 3 and 8 i have come down to deliver them out of the hands of the egyptians and to bring them out of that land into a good land and a large into a land that is flowing with milk and honey now god has already told him i have come down to deliver i want you to know this is where the pillar of fire comes to a prophet of god it parallels the rapture day that we are in where again a pillar of fire comes to a prophet of god amen if parallels the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout there is a message and that message is a message of deliverance come on amen now you know so he says i am come down to deliver them and i am going to bring them to a land that is flowing with milk and honey and you know these men can't grasp what god has said about them they just can't believe that a bunch of slaves would inherit such a land that somebody with as many complexes as i got as many problems as i have could possibly possess that you don't know what i've been through you don't know the problems i've been through you don't know the problems in my marriage you don't know the problems of my children you don't know the problems of my past or my ancestry of what men and women did back there what somebody did to me you don't know but god knew all of that [Applause] he knew they had been slaves he knew they had been mistreated he said i saw your affliction but i've come down to deliver you i haven't come to leave you in your affliction i have come to deliver you from your afflictions i'm going to be the lord to heal you of all your diseases i'm going to be everything a god could possibly be to you i've come to deliver i've come to bring you into a rapture and that's what the message is about it was about bringing divine healing to the people about restoring faith this is why the angel came if you can get the people to believe you and man if you can get faith up to a level i'll heal i mean i can't heal where there is doubt and unbelief i can do no mighty miracles for people who won't believe me so i come and i'm sending a gift to elevate your faith to give you where you can believe because you've been wandering around a long time in unbelief down in egypt's bondage but i've come down to bring you to a place of faith again word that you will believe now remember this is what he said when the son of man cometh will i find church members now when i find faith i'm looking for faith i'm looking for somebody that believed me now that's why the angel came that's why it comes to profit that's why it comes to moses he has to get the people to believe him and yes is more than delivering more than just deliverance from us from sickness but it's delivering us from unbelief amen if god can't bring you to a place where you can believe for divine healing then how is he going to get you to believe for rapture amen if my you know if i got a sickness in my body and and you know and there's a situation there if i can't believe for divine healing that god can is a healer then how can i believe that god's going to rapture me are you with me amen now that's that that's not the to the individual now if you don't have faith for this sickness and you die of it well you just you you couldn't go in the rapture that's not what he said he is saying if the church if i can't get my church to even believe for divine healing how am i going to get them to believe for a rapture why healing will only heal that one part if i got a bad heart to get a get a a better heart or get it renewed or get the problem fixed but still an aged heart right amen but that's divine healing you know and and it lasts as long as my faith lasts but notice the rapture is is a is a healing from the top of the head the soul of the feet it's the change of the color of the hair it's getting rid of the glasses and every artificial thing hey man well you know somebody told me the other day said i brother tim they they just put i just got a artificial knee and i said well you know you can't take that in the rapture plan on leaving it here now so but i believe which is sin you know we we can see it was there in egypt but it's got to be conquered in our day in order to have a rapture you know and it's a good land let me just say again he said it's a good land it's a fertile land it's a fertile land where plants prosper and bloom in abundance so much that bees that make their honey from it it's sweetness and where cows and the goats you know the milk's camels give them milk from the grass that is nourished by this rich soil it's a good land it flows with milk and honey the pastures are lush man there it's a good land can we say it today it's a good land where there is healing and miracles in the holy ghost it's a good land where we prosper in his abundance and tired of its goodness and man it's a good land where we can raise children up to serve the lord amen where our young people can be filled with the holy ghost amen it's a good land where there are sanctified homes and good marriages it's a good laugh i'm talking about the promised land of this world is a good land hallelujah now so he says in verse 22 he talks about every one of you came near to me and said let us send men before us let us search out the land for us and bring back word to us by the way we should go and and of the cities into which we would come and and i can't help but wonder so why do we need men to go and give a report when god has chosen the land for you and said it's a good land why does trust god why question the word why why somebody send somebody over there to to find out if it's really true and moses you know he said you know it sounded sensible to him said the plan pleased me well so i took 12 year men one man from each tribe they departed went to the mountain came to the valley of escort and spied it out and they took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us and they brought that word to us saying there's a good land which the lord our god has given you nevertheless you would not go up but you rebelled against the command of the lord your god and you complained in your tents and said because the lord hates us can you imagine how these words stung the almighty as it slaps him in his face i mean here his great love and his compassion has been moved for the people and they responded said you brought us here because you hate us you brought us out of the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us i'm going to just tell you god didn't call us out of denominations for us to die somewhere amen god did not call us out and send an angel come on send the prophet the seventh messenger the seventh angel sent a message to us to abandon us in the wilderness to just let us die here it is because he hates us because he left us he loved us so much he would leave us out there he wouldn't leave us in sin bondage i'm going to bring you out i'm going to bring you to a place where milk and honey flows the honey is sweet and the milk is nourishing i mean there's there's plenty of it for the families there nobody goes hungry amen everybody is filled to the room to the brown ever need and supplied i'm a god who wants to survive all your needs where where can we go up our brethren have discouraged our hearts saying the people are greater and taller than we and the cities are great and fortified up to heaven moreover we have seen the sons of anakin there now listen here again they the problem becomes exaggerated in their sight there was no wall that was fortified all the way up to heaven neither did they look like grasshoppers in their sights they they felt like grasshoppers in their own sight it's because of how they viewed their own self is that right and god comes along in this day to send a message to you to change turn your heart where you view every promise of god to be true and real for you and they said we can't take it and that evil report discouraged their hearts it it demoralized them you see it takes faith to fight because no one can fight without faith are you with me now you might think if i have faith then i won't have to fight and that's the mistake people make that well if i have faith i wouldn't have to fight no the faith is given to you to fight with amen faith is the strength to hold the sword amen the power to weld the weapon the sword is the word but the word is useless no matter how sharp it is no matter if it's known to defeat the devil anywhere any place anytime the sword is useless in the scabbard the sword is useless as decoration the sword is only good it is taken in the hand of faith and pressed to the heart of the enemy that's only time it cuts that's the only time it'll break through so you might think oh well if we had faith brother tim we wouldn't have a battle no we have faith that's why we fight fighters can't fight without faith well god gave us the land why ain't i got it because you've got to fight for it but i gave it to you that's all you need to know i've given it to you that's all you need to know for any promise that you're looking for today is god gave it to me it's mine and he gave me a weapon that is able to defeat the devil anywhere any place anytime come on and that's the word of god is that right and i made sure your word is sharp there never been aids that the world has been so sharpened and honed amen all the rest of the ages has been taken off of it is that right amen the things that dulled the sword in other ages trinity doctrines ideas of man creeds of man that would dull the effect of the word has all been dripped away amen god has made sure that it's sharp the word of god to be sharp and he would show us how sharp it was he said it could divide between soul and spirit it can go right down into the very most secret parts of man and expose the sin thereof now you know he gave laws concerning warfare now the reason i'm talking about this because i'm preaching on the lord is a man of war but if he's a man of war his people are a people of war so he's going to fight the battle but he's not going to fight it in the man of galilee jesus is not going to come down and fight your battle not in the nail scarred body the only way he's going to come as as the holy spirit to come use your body to face your goliaths no preacher can do it nobody else can do it it's your battle you've got your own battle to win there's somebody with me amen you've got your old enemy to conquer you got your own goliath oh yeah your demons are unique you praise them enough nobody's got devils like i got nobody fights battles like i fight nobody's got problems like i got so yeah yours are unique to you but you got them i got them everybody's got them and you got to fight them say i have depression brother tim i ask why why aren't you fighting it you see you can't win a battle without fighting and faith is not a decoration faith is there for you to fight with it gives you it's the courage that you need to hold on to the promise there's laws concerning warfare but deuteronomy 2 and 1 and when thou going start to battle against thine enemies and you see horses and chariots and the people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee which brought you up out of the land of egypt notice here now your enemies they got horses and they got chariots israel had no horses they didn't have chariots in fact to the matter is god told them even not to have them even when joshua would win this battle he said i want you to kill every one of them and hamstring every horse what was it he did not want them depending on human abilities he wanted them to know that he was the one that was the force in the battle amen amen now they've got horses and they got chariots that's what they're relying on but he says but the lord thy god is with thee so they got horses they got church but we got god amen like isaiah said for these egyptians are mere humans not god their horses are puny flesh not mighty spirits and when the lord raises his fist against them those who help them will stumble and those being helped will fall and they will all fall down and die together so this is this is isaiah's prophecy when he was telling them you're fighting humans now we are fighting spirits but i want you to know there has never been a spirit that has ever overcome the name of jesus christ and it shall be when you come nigh unto the battle that the priest now watch the priest the priest was called one it was one that was appointed to address the troops to give them encourage but and they he is called the anointed for war and that's what every preacher has got to be amen every preacher of the gospel is going to be a man anointed for all we're going to battle it out we're going to rally the truths we're going to say god is on our side we're gonna say we're more than able to take the lamb we're gonna say our weapon is the word and it's a it's up to meeting any enemy anytime anyplace anywhere the word of god is supreme that's the job of the preacher for he said when you approach the people speak to the people and and so say to them hero israel you approach this day against battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not do not tremble need to be terrified because of them for the lord your god goes with you to fight for you against your enemy to give you the victory this is instruction to every ministry i remember the jailer to rally the troops said when you approach the battle you say brother tim i get prayed for and next week i have an awful battle of course what do you think you challenged the enemy you told me he doesn't belong on your property i mean you upset his apple cart and man if you mess up his play day hey man you you you've caused the enemy to rise up well i'll just let sleeping dogs lie well leave with live with your demons if you want to that's not the bride of christ the bride of christ says ain't nothing staying on my property this is god's land he gave to me and this is an invader amen now so then again the officers are to address the army saying has any man built a new home and not dedicated let him return home or he may die in battle and another dedicated hesitant man planted a vineyard now look what he's doing he's going through there and he says i want the officers are saying now look now is there anybody here that planted a vineyard and you hadn't ate of it is there anybody here that you know has built a house and and hadn't yet lived in it let him return home lest he die in battle and another man enjoys fruit he's what's he doing he's sending people home people home who who isn't who isn't ready to win whose mind is more on something else well if i die and there's somebody else to eat mine from my vineyard you know if i died somebody else would live in my house amen the the officer is saying is there any man verse 6 or verse 8 is there any man that is fearful or afraid or faint-hearted he's saying go home we don't need you what if we what if we did that kind of preaching in the church if you don't want to go in a rapture and you're more worried about your 401k stay home if you're more worried about politics and all that's going on in the world and how to fix it here go home stay here vote for me i'm for me i'm gonna win this battle for me i'm gonna pursue my enemy for me i'm gonna contact the bible tells you that he's told him they said let him return home so the hearts of his brother will not melt like his own because fear and discouragement is contagious you know that you sit down with somebody a little while and they're they're fearful and all of a sudden you get children they're they're you know they're discouraged and you woke up like oh my goodness fear and discouragement are contagious i want to say if you got anything discouraging to say shut up i don't want to hear it whatsoever is not a faith is of sin come on it's time to look in the promise of god don't talk fear talk faith imagine you know listen get your stinking heads out of cnn and all the liberal stations where they're promoting all this fear and all this trouble and all the liberal media and all the other stuff and changing your mind and pulling you down and if you can't go to school and not and and tune out you know that the the the teachers that will come along they ain't know god and they ain't real and you know and challenge your beliefs and you know you know there's nothing to it and nothing to religion that's as far as they know oh man you know it's like a man was sitting there one day listening to an atheist talk brother branham tells this story he said he's sitting to an eye point this this atheist talk oh there's no god i can prove and this natalie you know and he was just laying out his case and a little boy that didn't look like he had much sense for sitting over eating on an apple and listened to him finally he looked at him and he said hey hey hey sir said uh is this apple i'm eating is it sweet or sour he said i know boy you're the one eating it he said that's what i thought i mean they don't know there's a god because they ain't never had an experience but i never god i know i've gotten healed i know a god that's real i know a god that delivers i see my god in action i seem to raise men up from the dead things of sin and turn their lives together again and make us pay now i see my god in action you don't know you never taste it but all taste and seed for the lord is good you better have the holy ghost sitting on your ear filtering what's coming through because without the holy ghost it'll absolutely twist your mind all around well i got television for the news what news a bunch of filthiness that'll change your mind make you perverted make you think things that totally against the word of god make you make you listen when you hear the prophet's voice it's archaic and and something of oh the dark ages somewhere don't talk fear talk faith now what is satan's weapon against you doubt unbelief discouragement discouragement is the loss of confidence you're discouraged this morning because you lost confidence you really lost confidence that god's able or it's a loss of enthusiasm which brother branham said himself in 1965 easter seal you must never lose your enthusiasm so discouragement is loss of confidence or enthusiasm depression is feelings of severe despondency or rejection so you know you get depressed nobody cares for me nobody loves me nobody's ever been through what i've been through nobody's got time for me nobody cares that's a lie not only does god's people care maybe they can't live with you and be with you 24 7 every minute of the day keeping you propped up that's what you've got the holy ghost for come on you want a pastor to be your holy ghost always there to lift you up and always there in any moment you know you need to you need not a pastor you need the spirit of god a man will be your comforter in the dark times but the you know there again the depression is feelings are of severe despondency or rejection and there's so many people feel so rejected oh you know nobody nobody understands me nobody i you know i'm different i'm i'm a little peculiar i well what you're saying is you're unique well all of us are i'm unique you're unique every one of us we're not cookie cutters everybody isn't in the same mold is that right amen so you know they're there again you you have depression as a feeling of rejection nobody cares god cares he cared so much that he become a man that his brother philip sang this morning on the cross he died for me when he died he was doing that for me god so loved me that he gave his only begotten son i can't even speak for the world i just know what he did for me yet he says god's loved the world so what is satan's weapon against is to try to get you to disbelieve or have no faith in your weapon that will disarm you listen if he can get you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has you disarmed he disarmed you when when he gets you to disbelieve that that weapon when you lay that down when in that moment when your faith turns to jello and you put down your sword when you quit saying it's thus saith the lord it's thus saith the lord this is what god said and he never fails jesus never fails jesus never fails when you when you quit when you start laying it down remember when you stop for just a moment and begin to listen to your adversary as i've said a lot of people come to me and say brother tim the devil's been talking to me well that ought to stop it right there you need not tell me no more if you realize the devil's talking to you then consider the source please [Music] the devil's been talking to me okay so the devil has he the devil talks to me too it's the devil what do you think devils do devil's torment devils don't come and prop me up and help me along and make me jolly and happy what devils don't do that devil's torment devils come along and and question my faith they question my belief their question believe in who i am is the son of god they question the word devils come along and put every other thought above the word of god that's what devils do that's devil's work but your work is in my name you shall cast out devil hallelujah you're gonna have to listen to him shut him up then he says i said to you do not be terrified or afraid of them this is what moses said don't be afraid don't be terrified the lord who goes with you he will fight for you according to all he did for you in egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness you saw now he comes and brings the testimonies you saw how the lord your god carried you as this man carries his son and all the way you went until you came to this place you saw it you saw you saw you didn't make this way along you didn't get here by yourself you look back over life's journey and you realize i couldn't have made it by myself it was him that carried me in the tough times i remember years and years ago and of course now it's become a plaque and now it's on everybody's walls but many many years ago in the early 70s it came out a little story about a man who looked back on life's journey remember footprints he looked back on life's journey and he saw the two two sets of footprints in the sand then he comes in some of the roughest and the most hardest times of his life and there was only one set and the man's looking back and he said lord why is it why is it in all of the times when it was easy you were right there walking with me how come when things were going good and the paycheck was coming in the kitties were well and there was no struggles at home and there were no problems in the church and well why is it you know that you walked with me but when trouble came in those dark times there's only one set of footprints how come you left me he said child you don't understand the reason you're seeing one set of footprints because during those times i carried you when you couldn't make another step when you couldn't put another foot in front of you i can't pick you up and i carried you right through he's carrying you this morning when you can't make it on your own he's there carrying you thank you isaiah 63 and 8 says for he said surely they're my people oh i love it when god says that's my people that's my son that's what happened when you got the holy ghost it was god said this is my son i'm pleased to dwell in him surely they are my people children that will not lie in other words children ought to be true to me so he was their savior and all their affliction he was afflicted think of that you don't go through a thing that he hasn't hurt with it too and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and his pity he redeemed them and he bear them and carried them all the days of old so here was isaiah is saying this but you can just name a scripture name a time through the scripture that he wasn't there carrying his church he carried him in the dark ages he carried him in luther's age he was there carrying them in methodist age come on he was there in the pentecostals on azusa street he was darren william branham's ministry he's right here today amen i'm right there with you and and i carried him all the days of old then he says there yet for all of that you didn't you did not believe the lord your god who went in the way before you just search out a place for you to pinch your tents and to show you the way you should go in the fire by day in the cloud by night i led you by a pillar of fire you didn't get here on your lawn you just didn't wonder here you didn't wonder aimlessly in the wilderness i i picked out the camps for you and i brought the church through luther and i brought him to wesley and i brought him through azusa i brought him to the message of the and i'm here to take you all the way to the rapture and the lord heard the sound of your words and he was angry and he took an oath saying surely not one of these men of these evil generations shall see the good land which i swore to give to your fathers except caleb the son of jafani and he shall see it unto him and his children i'm giving the land on which they walk because he holy followed the lord moreover your little ones and your children who you say will be victims today that who today have no knowledge of good and evil they shall go in there and to them i will give it and they will possess it but for you go wander in the wilderness god reaches a point until he says i'm through with your rebellion amen oh he would look over and say oh faithless and perverse generation god wants a people that believes him so what a sad ending for people who started out so jubilant with a high hand but were were kept out of the promised land because of their unbelief you see they received the word but they didn't mix it with faith you see they wanted a god that was a god of war but they themselves didn't want to yield their bodies to be the one he fought through they were willing to for god to mow down their enemy but they didn't want to wield the sword they wanted to have a slave mentality let somebody else do your fighting now god's going to do your fighting but he's going to fight through you so you're going to be in the heat of the battle so you don't do you don't don't expect to be on a picnic while god does it expect yourself to be in the midst of the battle and god fighting through you are you with me this is why he said in first timothy 6 12 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life where to also you're called you see this is this is what you have to be to be tenacious you lay hold on a promise you don't let go of it if god said i can be healed and i can be healed you say i'm 80 years old it doesn't matter everybody said well i'm 90. that don't matter so i'm 100 it don't matter or god's a healer regardless of whether you're young or whether you're old whether you're middle aged whatever he's a healer and his promises are just as real for you as anybody else [Applause] god is willing to show up in you the moment he can get you to believe him let's go back to time where god let him out these israelites were slaves down in egypt but then when israel realized who their god was that he was a man of war then his people was supposed to also become a people of war too long they had lived a defeated people they had lived in slavery for many of them they still had a defeated mentality wanting somebody else to care for them that lived with their demons they were whipped by them every day sound familiar they looked at themselves as downtrodden people who would always be this way forgotten people yes they remembered a god of history to abraham isaac and jacob but it seemed that the gods of egypt were more powerful and they were caught in this situation seemed like forever but god had given a promise amen and he had to do something now to turn their hearts back to faith does that sound familiar don't you know why elijah the prophet was sin on this day to get people to believe it again now moses when he looked on him he looked on him with different eyes he actually disdained being this the son of pharaoh's daughter and he esteemed greater the the the reproaches of of israel than the treasures of egypt so he looked at them with a different eye he he saw them as a people who god was gonna free who were to be liberated who had never reached their potentials who all they had ever known was how to be a mud daughter and to build something for satan's kingdom remember moses looked at him with different eyes he saw them as god saw them when god looked up on him he said these are my people they are not my daughters they don't belong to pharaoh they are not slaves they are my children and i have come down to deliver them the problem is too many people look at themselves still as slaves servants to failures always defeated unable to win a loser well brother tim i don't even know why i'm here tonight i don't know why you can come up in this prayer line i don't even know why i'm asking for prayer i tell you i've been up here so many times why are you coming up stay in your seat you just couldn't go back another failure you come down believing you're a failure believing that you know it ain't going to happen this sound i'll try again no don't even try it sit there in your cotton picking seat until you finally realize my god is real my god is a healer my god is fine over his enemy my god will prevail my god will overcome my god has never failed any place anywhere anytime and i'm coming down to meet my god you got to quit looking at yourself as a slave i am not a slave to this thing in my life i'm not a slave to this affliction i don't have to live with this monkey on my back i'm a people who has promised deliverance amen you can't look at yourself as slaves and servants to failures always defeated unable to win a loser you know david realized he was a winner because god was on his side and man he realized that you know in in comparison to the weaponry of the enemy that you know his his weapon was a slingshot and the enemies with a big sword and a spear and a seer you know like a weaver's beam and and helmet and all the protection and the big shield and all of the the ornaments of warfare and he he had fought battle after battle after battle and he knew how to handle himself and david's never thought nothing but a lion and a bear nothing but a lion and a bear that's what we look at we look and we see the enemy but then we judge things as well all of that may be true but you come to me in the name of a philistine but i come to you in the name of the lord god of israel and i am anointed to bring you down hallelujah do you know you have been anointed for the throne to him that overcometh will i grab to sit with me in my throat even as i overcame i had to fight i fought for my throne you fight for yours but david said this day i'm going to feed your carcass to the birds this day i'm going to take your head off and he didn't even have a sword he said i'll use the devil's sword isn't it about time we turn the thing that the devil has been using us against him tell him what a defeated being that he is that he ain't chosen that he ain't called that nobody loves him [Applause] ain't it about time that you look back at your adversary and tell him what he's been telling you you was a failure from the beginning you were predicted to be a failure at the end i have been called to be an overcomer industry i shall rise above every difficulty i have not been called to lose i have been born to win i didn't travel in this age to be defeated i came [Applause] hallelujah david said for by thee by my god i've run through a troop and by my god i've leaped over a wall [Music] i've went over insurmountable things by my god i've run through the troop of death by my god i've done all this by my god because my god my lord is the lord a man of war now god brings israel to the red sea they must learn they must learn something very important that you must take note of today first corinthians 10 13 says god is faithful we can preach a whole sermon on that god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which are able but with will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to to bear it so so let me tell you he is our escape so you're not trapped after all he's your escape now deuteronomy 33 would say there is no god like the no one like the the god of jesus now that word is god's name for israel meaning the upright one so he says there's no god like the god of the upright ones so many times we know we've got to pray the prayer of faith we know the effects of fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much so we go to pray and we get reminded of our past now god doesn't do that the devil does that he that's he's the adversary so this is the weapons of his warfare he comes right down you know and he reminds you of your past he reminds you of your failures he remember how many times you tried and failed and so you know then then he reminds you it tells you you are unrighteous now let's talk about this for a moment because when our sins are plunged in the blood of jesus then we are the upright ones not because we've done everything right but because he even the score he crossed out the values his blood atoned for our loss come on somebody amen dude this is what it is you know we are the upright one so therefore any of us can pray the effects of fervent prayer of a righteous one because you know because our righteousness is not in our own efforts our righteousness is on what god did for us there's no god like the god of jesus who rides across the heavens to help you on the clouds in his majesty the eternal god is your refuge and under needs are the everlasting arms he will drive out your enemies before you say and destroy them wait he's going to drive him out and he tells you to destroy him so israel will live in safety and jacob will dwell secure in the land of grain a new wine where heavens drop dew blessed are you israel who is like you a people saved it by the lord he is your shield and helper and your glorious sword your enemies will cower before you and you will tread on their heights these are the things that god said about israel and in the book of exodus where we've been reading the bible said it came to pass in the morning watch that's just before the dawn now here they're surrounded here the enemies behind them but now just before the morning watch just just before the dawn in the morning watch just before the dawn let me tell you it's just before the dawn little children can you hear me amen we are here the bible said we'll need a way of escape that we should pray always to escape the things coming on the earth that escape is a rapture amen it was impossible to get to a red sea it's impossible for you to pick yourself up by the bootstraps and get out of here you know it's going to take a supernatural god to get you out of the mess you're in today come on somebody but i want you to understand where we're at it's morning it's morning let me tell you it's just before the dawn it's the prophet said shalom amen it's the greatest darkness ever but it's the time when the lord capital l ord turns his eye upon the enemy so i want you to see this exodus 14 24 it came to pass in the morning watts the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and the cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians now watch these words as we talk about it because god now waits until the last person is across the red sea now there was several million of them to go across but the last one had to finally make it over come on the last one had to get on the other side the last one i hope you're hearing what we're saying now god waits until the last person is safely through the red sea now watch don't get offended here don't shut me down here but the red sea represents pentecost in the types i'm not talking about azusa street amen but i'm talking about the book of acts church i'm talking about the day of pentecost i'm talking about the original experience and god has to let the last person get the baptism of the holy ghost oh church come on you're one to see the lord come oh we want to see him come hold at the rapture the trouble the trouble get the last one in [Applause] amen don't give up on altar calls don't give up on holy ghost meeting don't give up on the power of god to save the lost don't come on don't quit believing for your children don't be satisfied to leave one of them out there everybody's gotta come through the red sea get up through pentecost get about the experience with god get them filled with the holy ghost because we can't go [Music] the enemies come on somebody all the enemies can't be destroyed and are safely on the other side till the last one comes in well there's no more intercessor that's the devil's lie there's no more mediator that's the devil's lie come on church amen this is what he was doing he was mediating on their behalf he began to look down at the sea with angry eyes he looked at pharaoh and all his army was angry hallelujah why do you think this message was accompanied by a pillar of fire come on somebody why do you think that night after night he showed himself over and over again why do you think god looked through diseases through a pillar of fire that's a devil that's a demon and that demon's gotta go if i can get him to believe in leaving a moment hallelujah because he looked at him with angry eyes and george about to turn his eyes on america god's about to turn his eyes on on the under liberal condition god is about to turn his eyes on the devil [Music] and look through the pillar of fire [Music] now if you're looking through cnn you don't see what i'm talking about if you're looking through the liberal agenda today or even the conservative agenda god's about to get the last one through the last person is about to step on the other side then the angry eyes of god will fasten upon lucifer now when i say pentecost i don't want anybody to misunderstand me i am not talking about azusa street this is not a repeat of pentecost for the return the azusa street movement represented that again in that they spoke with tongues and we are not simply repeating gifts and besides all of that let's just get some clarification here that azusa street was misnamed pentecost it was not pentecost brother branham goes to great lengths to explain that in the church age book over and again and even in his sermons azusa street was not the original grain it was not what god planted in the beginning returning back to its mature form again it was only a stage of the plant it was a shock and not the grain but i want you to understand again that the red sea here and i'm going to lay belabor this point for a few minutes and like i said don't misunderstand don't get sidetracked and don't get in the wrong direction and if you're listening to me out there across the land i am not advocating going back to azusa street and the confusion and the unbelief and the darkness and the things and and the evil spirits that got in the whole movie we're not even talking about we're talking about a book of acts church but i do want to remind you the job of malachi 4 was to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers and that's what we're talking about we're talking about malachi 4 was to turn our hearts back to that faith now azusa street as i said with misnamed pentecost it was not i want you to understand what pentecost is it was what we saw in the book of acts and it's what god is bringing about in this last day with his end time message this is the jubilee this is the seven sevens this is the end of the church ages in this day the day of pentecost fully comes pentecost means 50 and there were seven sabbaths from the passover called the feast of weeks and these seven sabbath represented seven church ages and when you reach the end of the last age then the day of pentecost or the 50th comes and we are in the jubilee of all jubilees now just quickly let's talk talk about the feast for a moment so we can understand because brother branham talks about this red sea that we that we have been preaching about that we've said everyone must get through he said it's pentecost and he said passover or this is the way the the feasts are passover is the feast of salvation in both testaments the blood the lamb delivers from slavery uh the jew from from egypt and the christian from sin so both of them are delivered from slavery and it's no common coincidence that jesus was sacrificed on the on passover at passover time and then egypt the jew marches house with the blood of the lamb and today every christian must mark his house or his body the house of his spirit with the blood of jesus christ everyone must have the token the blood the holy ghost now the next day after the passover becomes a feast of unleavened bread and the leviticus 23 6 it puts the second feast on the next night on the 15th day of the second month is a feast of unleavened bread to the lord seven days you must eat unleavened bread again god laid these things out in the natural we can look at them as a spiritual israel and see ourselves in the types because once again this type 7 church agent because seven days we are commanded to eat bread without leaven unleavened bread in the new testament of course is the body of our lord he's described as the bread of life he was born in bethlehem which in hebrews means a house of bread and that the church is to feast on him amen the word of life until he comes right now and it's to all be unleavened as brother branham said seven days what does that templify the complete seven church ages seven days and the whole church age from beginning to end has only to live only on the word of god of that age so notice again the seven days of unleavened bread in itself is a type of seven church ages where we are to eat on the living unleavened bread of the body word of the son of man each one getting their portion or their peace broken off for their day now then of course comes sunday morning following the unleavened bread remember morning cometh and on that on that sunday morning the day after the sabbath uh following the unleavened bread it it begins the first fruits and it's the feast of acknowledging the fertility of the land that god gave the israelites and they were to bring the early crops of the spring planting and wave a sheep before the lord you remember this in the bible and of course this celebrates to us the resurrection of the lord on first fruits which which incur when which incurred exactly the same time that the high priest was waving the first fruits on that sunday morning out of the dead came the first fruits of the resurrection hallelujah and he didn't come along but all the old testament saints rose with him is that right and appeared undemeaning or was waived or shown before them that the land is good and the word is fertile and it comes to pass just like he said amen hallelujah now from the day after that sabbath they start counting seven days ours our 50 days our seven sabbaths seven sabbath would be seven times seven forty nine the next day the jubilee the 50th day is called the day of pentecost and when the seventh sabbath um since when when the seventh sabbath since passover are the feasts of weeks it began has been completed now so we know then by all of this if i just stop briefly and explain the first four fruits reveals that jesus was crucified on passover he was buried on on unleavened bread he was raised on the first fruits and 50 days later he sends the holy spirit to us on pentecost now i want to say that even that was a type because it was prefiguring again what god would do in a gentile church so we had to pass over 2 000 years ago but now we have marked seven weeks and now we come back to pentecost or to the jubilee again are you with me now you know so we are now at the end of the seventh church age which brings us to the end of the feast of weeks and the beginning of the jubilee it's the time where the jubilee trumpet sounds it's a time where where that um that it becomes what is called the day of pentecost when it fully comes because these weeks have been rolling up church ages now rolling up and grinding down until it finally comes to where it's all complete the 50 days are complete the cycle is complete the church ages are complete and we're living in the end of the last church age there are no more so we're right here at the pentecost of all pentecost now did you know what the did you know that during pentecost that the jews read the book of ruth every pentecost this is what they read the book of ruth now what is it it's where the man of war becomes the intercessor the go-between the kinsmen redeemer and to do that christ has to put on the garments of warfare now his garments of warfare he will take on human flesh to become the warrior god where he literally fights human battles just like you fight human battles so that there's nothing you go through that your general hadn't went through there is nothing that you've got to conquer that your general hasn't conquered for you already he showed you it can be done and i'm going to lead you now into battle are you with me now so it's the man of war becomes the intercessor to go between the kinsmen redeemer and so christ puts on the garments of war let's look at him in isaiah 59 he saw that there was no man he was amazed that there was no one to intercede isaiah 59 16. so his own arm brought salvation and his own righteousness sustained him and he put on righteousness like a breastplate and the helmet of salvation on his head and he put on garments of vengeance oh my vision now as kinsmen he is not just kinsmen redeemer but he's also kinder adventure amen so he does purchasing work at calvary amen come on redeeming the book claiming work and by opening the seven seals so we're in the days of his claim and work but he's about to bring forth his avenging work hallelujah there's going to be a tribulation for those that trouble you the devil is in trouble his kingdom is coming down did you hear what i'm saying give me a little more sound up here brother jim amen so he will prepay listen what he's gonna he's gonna repay according to their deeds fury to his enemies oh wait a minute amen retribution to his suppose recompense to the islands so that they that fear the name of the lord where the sun sets and his glory where it rises for he will come like a raging flood driven by the breath of the lord oh my this is how he's coming with a flood against his enemy they lay when the enemy comes in then like a flood the spear of the lord lifts up a standard against him hallelujah now this is him the redeemer will come to zion so the redeemer comes to the bride to further his redemption work is not that he ceases redemption he is completing redemption he did his purchasing work at calvary now he does claim and work and he first claims the book hallelujah that was sealed with seven seals that no one could look upon until he came because he was the only one worthy to be able to do it and he claims the book because it's the book of our inheritance and when he claims it he is claiming it for you he is claiming it for me come on somebody now and then and he claims the people for his namesake the names that are written in the book so as kinsmen he is not only kinsmen redeemer to purchase back what we lost but he also does the claiming work in order that he might be the avenger of blood because he's going to pay back everything that the devil's done i'm telling you friends you're not the one in trouble in this age the pillar of fire amen he's looking through that pillar of fire with angry eyes at the adversary look what you've done since even oh man look what you've done i'm coming to pay retribution look what you've done in the dark ages i've come to pay back everybody look what you've done to my children right here in this last age amen i've come to take up their cause i have come down to deliver i'm coming with a shout with a message and that message says let my people go hallelujah that's what he said to sickness diseases affliction sin folks doctrine every day let my people go you can't seal the book no more you can't hold the promise back how far you can't keep the pride away from the word no more not no more not the bar it's over it's over and claiming my inheritance i'm claiming those who i redeemed and my work of claimant will be so complete i'll rise and raised him up and calls him i read it and martin and luther and wesley and william branham and everyone in the dead impacts arrived because he claimed hallelujah hallelujah no wonder isaiah would look and see him coming now it's a child that's coming a son is going to be born a child is going to be given but his name is called wonderful and counselor the mighty god el gabor the the warrior god this is what he's going to be he's going to be god as a warrior and he's going to sit right down into human bodies imagine amen to get in that human body and then through that redemption he can get in your redeemed human body [Applause] to continue the war [Music] against sin against doubt against unbelief against sickness somebody help me preach now he's the god of war now when moses said the lord is a man he wasn't a man yet but again this was prophesying of the incarnation of christ for yet he was not really a man although he was prophesied a seed would come since genesis he would be a man amen he would come as a man but yet he's not a mere man but he's a man of war come on somebody or a warrior he's one that is experienced in war amen he's fought with many powerful enemies satan and his principalities and his powers the world the great men of it the antichrist a warrior that's well-vested in all the odds of war he's abundantly qualified to be the man of war he has achieved wisdom and strength and courage and thoroughly dress for it he's been preparing for this battle hallelujah amen and he's dressed for it he's got on the helmet of salvation the garment of vengeance amen a coca-ceo he's got a passion about it he's got a passion about his pride he's got a passion about her deliverance he got a zeal he would say the seal for my house has eaten me up [Applause] and he's going for concrete and the concrete he's a victorious one he's conquered sin satan the world and he'll subdue others and he makes his people more than conquerors said i'm a conqueror but you're going to be more than one and he is the captain of the lord's army or the host he is the leader and commander of his people he is the general of the armies in heaven and earth and he's a prince and king at the head of them he's all of it his alpha and omega beginning to the end that's a redeemer and he came to dwell in us at pentecost so like i said at pentecost the story of ruth is read new story is one of a gentile woman an outcast a rejected race a reject that comes into the promised land at barley harvest and becomes married to the owner of the field and winds up owning the field are you with me now amen now in order to get ruth he has to redeem naomi so he comes to the juice in order to get a gentile bride and in the last day he restored israel back to her natural land while he's restoring ruth in her promised land somebody with me amen so the first pentecost now let's go back here the first pentecost was 50 days after they left egypt at mount sinai and mount sinai now that was the first official pentecost brother branham calls the red sea he types it as pentecost but you know again literally the real pentecost comes the seven weeks after that they come to mount sinai to the mount of god and at the mount of god there on mount sinai god gives them the covenant of the law the second pentecost is where god gave his word on the day of pentecost the pouring out of his spirit upon all flesh and gave them and and there he espoused to himself a bride now remember at mount sinai he made a covenant with israel and espoused himself to israel we know the story of israel and her betrayal and her sins and how god said i've divorced thee and so on like that but now you come to the second pentecost where god gives his word on the day of pentecost and espouses to himself a bride what did paul say you know i feel less as a serpent because eve so will the satan do the same thing to you and he said for i have espoused you i've engaged you to a husband amen now so we are espoused to him to be his bride at pentecost listen every person that's why you have to have your pentecost because it's there that you realize that on you has always been that wedding band a predestinated unmerited grace and god opens your eyes to knowing you have always been his that you didn't come his at the altar you always were his and he slipped a ring of unmerited grace on your finger before the foundation of the world and he called you to be his own amen so if you want to be united to christ get pentecost that's why this is a pentecost because it's the invincible union of the bride it is where a marriage takes place now of course the first visits mount sinai given the law the second in the upper room the given of the spirit where god took the law and didn't write it in stone but wrought and wrote it in tables of the heart the third now we come to the third see it realms and threes right first mount sinai second day of pentecost third this last day where god finishes the pouring out of his spirit and he takes a people in a rapture now the conclusion of the weeks of unleavened bread the seven church ages it's here that god concludes his waving as in this waving it is a waving of two loaves and it was it's it's two loaves here that that has been infused with the life now in in in other types 11 is a type of sin but in this type this 11 is not sin this 11 it could even be called change you know where you know what what happens when when god puts his life into you it rises up right it rises up swells out amen but then you know the the god allows through the trials and punch you back down and you rise up again and he punches you back down and you rise up again amen what's he getting what's he doing now he has got his life in you god then puts it in the fire and he firmly completely puts him exactly that way unchangeable the breath never falls again come on somebody now god god does this now and these two loaves are waved before the people the complete covenant of law and grace jew and gentile and he begins to elevate his pride until she raptures this is the day where a bride is elevated she's being waved now this is he's already started this elevation by showing signs wonders miracles by taking the seals off the book of the inheritance as he gives to ruth the gentile bride the full inheritance somebody said full inheritance now this is now becomes the jubilee of all jubilee or the pentecost of all pentecost now this fulfills the 50th year in the bible where the lands that were lost due to indebtedness returns back to its original owners this fulfills the 50th year where slaves throw down their shovels and lay down their hoes and go free and this is a jubilee where all who have been in the bondage of mortality crippled and in chains of mortal weaknesses thrown down their shovels lay down their hoes mortal life being over and step from time bodies into immortality oh free hallelujah free and lost do you realize we're right on the edge i'm hearing the trumpet sound i'm hearing the sound of the bridegroom the voice is in the bride and i'm hearing that there is where right now one step away from stepping into a new body stepping right into come on united without theophany hallelujah i thought about that today and looked at my little wife there sitting on the couches she was watching me study and and waiting for me as i was preparing and i looked over there and i said i can see auburn hair coming back on you i can see wrinkles coming off your face i can see you dancing yourself i can see brother we're about to step over hallelujah i'm about to step over are you about to step over do you realize how close we are the lesson penis [Music] disparage you don't let the naysayers and the jedi site and the website discourage you don't listen to the gossip of unbelief hallelujah we know where we're at we're at the red sea where god looks through the pillar of fire even as he has done in our day [Applause] one day his eyes are going to turn toward the mortality of my body now in our day we saw diseases exposed and trembled when he looked through the pillar of fire we saw sin exposed false doctrines exposed you think that's something when he looks down to the bill of fire upon death and the shackles of age oh my oh brother gary when he looks one day down at your age where aids is working in your body which is incipient death amen and death gets scared amen and wrinkles follow up your face and mind hallelujah will you look at your little bride you took back years ago and miles seemed more perfect then than now than she was then amen why because we're in the day of pentecost we're in the day of stepping over into eternity the day of pentecost where is the time of marriage where the seals are taken off of the inheritance and the names are called of the redeemed do you hear what i'm saying amen if you're elevated you have been caught up out of laodicea's lukewarmness in the glories of the throne where the book is open and you see yourself there as the people of the book revelation 5 and 9 i want you to turn with me we're trying to get this down to close we're going to let you out by two o'clock on my part and that's never a promise amen revelation 5 9 and they sung the new song moses sang one hello at the red sea moses sang a new song pentecost is where you sing a new song come on amen and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou slain and has redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and we ain't slaves no more [Music] because thou has made us into our god kings and priests and we shall reign hallelujah not in heaven on the earth we will reign right here because we are kings and priests and we have a dominion look what the lord has done remember the red sea the song of moses that was pentecost brother branham told us that in exodus 15 6 thy right hand o lord has become glorious in power thy right hand oh lord hath that's in pieces the enemy amen but look over here here's another pentecost at the finishing of the seven ages well watch now verse 11 of revelation 5 and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them oh they were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is a lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing amen and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such are in the sea and all of them heard i say it blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever brother they were having a jubilee they were having a pentecost and i tell you what if the opening of the seal doesn't bring you to a pentecost you went to a theology but you didn't see the book open because when the book is opened by the lamb and you see your name there hallelujah then you know the promise is yours and then enough devils in hell gonna keep you from it hallelujah pentecost was the second harvest the wheat harvest and we're here at the final harvest the first harvest was barley and the old testament ended with the coming of the old the messiah and the resurrection of the dead now seven seven weeks later seven church ages later comes pentecost and it's harvest time and the new testament ends with the coming of the messiah and the resurrection of the dead in christ amen so the last church will be a pentecostal church don't hang up on me let me quote your prophet he said the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 an action is the true church that jesus claims as his own all else is false christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts well you said but that was then but what a what if the vine ever puts up with another branch brother tim well puts it forth another branch here's what he said if the vine never puts forth another branch of itself that branch will be exactly like the branch itself it will be the same kind of branch that brought forth on the day of pentecost it will speak in tongues and prophesy and have the power and the signs and the resurrected christ jesus christ in it amen may you get it you take that up with the prophet of god that's what he said the church would be like amen and he said dust what was the what the church was at pentecost is the standard that's the pattern there is no other pattern so i don't know what you're patting your church is after amen but the real church will be patterned and right after a book of acts a new testament church a people of the new covenant a people who knows their god or people who have been to the upper room of people that have been filled with the holy ghost or people who knows that power who lays hands on the set and they shall recover that in his name they cast out devils they speak with new tongues and even if they drink any deadly thing it won't hurt them the true church will always try to be like the original at pentecost what are we trying to be like today the frozen chosen what are we trying to be like a morgue what are we trying to be like today come on church the true church will always try to be like the original of pentecost the true church today will try to approximate the early first one the messengers to the churches having the same spirit of god in them will try to approximate the apostle paul the promise i'm just i'm just reading some of these one right after another these are all from the church age book the promise of power with the apostles were endued at pentecost is to you jews and to you your children jews and to all there are far off gentiles amen and as many as the lord our god shall call both jew and gentiles and until he stops calling the pentecostal message and power will not cease amen so it's pentecost where a church of all nations comprised of two loaves jew and gentile is waves before the people god elevates that church now what the church had at pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure worthy god she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders gifts of the spirit and if the church is the true church it'll have the same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at pentecost by experience oh we don't need experience well by experience it will be a pentecostal church and there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecies and healings and god will be in the midst of her and god will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has hallelujah amen in this last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day she'll listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ what's wrong with our fundamentals they have no power for they stop short of pentecost the church is no longer the mouth of peace of god it's his own mouthpiece so god is turning on her and he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear from god as at pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as it was in the first age but what about the true seed it will happen just as we said the people of god are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age ever will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the lord and it's here when the last one like the last israelite passed through the red sea when the last member of the bride has had their pentecost you can't go in the rapture without having your own pentecost amen when the last member comes in then the rapture will go is that right amen now let's let's just come to our close now exodus 14 24 it came to pass in the morning watch the lord looked to the host of the egyptians to the pillar of fire and the cloud now listen trouble always comes sickness comes on every hand but when when it does the angel of god goes out between you the bible would describe the pillar of fire went and stood between israel and the egyptians so they did not come near each other all night so now when sickness when trouble comes before you the pillar of fire goes to stand between you challenging you to take god at his word amen now that's what he does he gets there to make a way but standing between you and trouble even brother branham told his death he said to every believer born again child of god when death comes stealing at your door prematurely the angel of god stands between you and the sickness now if you want to run right on to it that's your business but you don't have to he's standing between you and death he was the go between them he's the go-between now he was the mediator then he is the mediator now he was the lamb then he is the lamb now amen let me just tell you in case you're thinking he's no more lamb and he's already turned lying listen let me tell you even in the even in the in the in the ages ahead when he's with his people he's the lamb when he's with him on 144 000 the lamb is with his people the lamb amen the bible said that they have to face the wrath of the lamb the lamb is still there interceding on behalf of the remnants and somebody with me the lamb is that but you say he's a lion oh yeah my husband he's a liar man when the enemy comes that man he's ferocious he roars and then he's got cheese he bites amen he tramples down he destroys the man the king is a lion but when i look at him i don't ever see him as a lion i see him as my lamb he's the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world he's melchizedek both king and priest intercessor then intercessor now in fact i want to show you the position of the lamb revelation five and six and i beheld i looked when you get elevated by revelation into this place you look and i beheld and i lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as had been slain i want you to notice as he takes the book he is stood he stands to claim his inheritance he's been sitting as mediator and his blood's still atones listen his purchasing work is not ineffective because he's not on the cross anymore he's still doing the purchasing work somebody help me yes he purchased you at calvary by his bud but he actually did that before the world began but in time you met him in an altar and there you found out he purchased your salvation amen now but watch now he stands and he stands there as a lamb and he takes the book as a lamb amen oh i want you to get this because he's a lamb he's our intercessor he is our mediator as a lamb he's our go-between as a lamb he is there as a redeemer as a lamb he is a kinsman is somebody with me now watch this this parallels daniel chapter 12 because in the bible says at that time michael come on somebody michael his name is archangel whose name means who is like jehovah an angel who is like jehovah my goodness he was there in the pillar of fire he was there down to the ages and he was always like jehovah and we saw him in a pillar of fire and it was the same jesus that was on that met paul on the road to damascus one like jehovah come on somebody and then that time shall michael stand up and i looked and i saw a lamb now look at the parallel michael standing the archangel and now the lamb standing what's now the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people oh and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation until that same time but in that time of trouble at that time shall thy people be delivered everyone whose name is found in the book that was sealed with seven seals and you couldn't look at it until it was open until a lamb stood and when michael stands up it is a time of deliverance don't you realize what the rapture is it's a deliverance don't you realize what the resurrection is is a deliverance do you realize everything that god's done in this age has delivered i have come down for deliverance when the lamb stands up it's pentecost again hey man it's like the red sea where god stands up and looks to the pillar of fire it's like the day of pentecost when god comes down and looks to that pillar of fire and gives each one a lick of his own life and you're free you're not a slave anymore can i preach this for a moment men let me let's just look and see what happened in pentecost and i want you to equate it to where we are now with an open book with our names revealed with heaven come on and if you're you say brother but i'm in the earth no if you are a believer you are in heavenly places in christ jesus is that right if you're there you see a lamb that's taken the book has opened the seals and it's made you rejoice come on you're not some dead dragon hope so anymore you're somebody that's got victory because you see your name in the book and the book has been opened and every promise is now mine let's look for a moment let's look down here men men 120 of them in the upper room who were a lifetime of slavery they were now free from the bondage of sin peter that denier who exalted his cursed flesh over jesus christ and denied the lord three times and chose his own self over his lord now so his ego and his pride all conquered and dead and drowned in the red sea at pentecost that enemy that had troubled peter all his life and gave him that o ego and that pride and then turned into be a denier when the time when the trouble come and that thing that made him like that in the time of trouble now was gone and at pentecost that enemy was dead and peter jumps up on the bus and he said this is that which the prophet joel spoke up for in the last days god will pour out his spirit upon all flesh and he just poured it out on me my ego is gone my pride is gone my ambition is gone my cowardness is gone and now i got the keys to the kingdom at pentecost and man thomas the doubter wasn't a doubter anymore amen at the red sea pharaoh looked on as as his mighty army drowned his captains his chair tears his best cherries the wheels come on and it pentecost men saw lust that enslaved him drowned in the sea amen men saw slave addictions to drug and alcohol drowned in the sea of god's great forgetfulness now there was a new stimulant as new wine had been poured into new bottles come on church on the day of pentecost god had a 120 new wineskins hallelujah that had just been made new and they were sitting there with their bottled necks up waiting for the outpouring amen waiting for the outpouring and here it came when this holy spirit fell from heaven and began to feel little bottles 120 of them with the holy ghost hallelujah that new wine began to work on the inside of them and bubble up on the inside of them and they bounced out on the street come on somebody they were drunk in the spirit they were intoxicated with a new wine amen what revival they were having you see that's god's order amen because when the pentacles come it brings a revival and if the message of the hour don't bring you a revival you're in the wrong message you're hearing the wrong voice it should cause a revival and an enthusiasm and get rid of your discouragement hallelujah and what happened when they bubbled out there they went right down the street just a bubbling over and they found a crippled man there at the on the side that the gate called beautiful and they said we don't have silver and gold but we got something there's something there's a light pulsating in us hey man just reach here and we're gonna give you what we got amen and when it happened that man went down screaming and shouting and glorifying god why he was having his own pentecost now he had his own liberation he was set free at the red sea satan saw his army with his powers of the horse and the riders thrown into the sea his best horses well-bred champions tangled in their harness tied to a chariot like an anchor drowned in the midst of the red sea at this pentecost we see white red black pale horses and his riders drowned exposed uncovered powerless it has no hold on you it's rider is death and it's dead in the sea a man laodicea where this lukewarmness has no power its forms has no power its creeds have no power its dumbness have no power no more does it have power over no more can they champion over us man made theology has no more power you pastors out there you say to me brother tim why is it our people are not advancing why is it their heads are stuck in movies why is it there's no faith among people why is it people won't come to church anymore why is it they ain't fervent known fire why is it that the sick aren't healed and young people are denied their pentecost brother tim we got the word we got the full word it's the word brother tim that's not the word let me just say it again that's not the word that's a cold dead theology and man your spiritual thermometer of your church is about 40 degrees below zero that's not the word the word has life the word has power amen if the book unsealed does not bring you to a pentecost where sin is dead and the flesh is denied it's still in as powerless and worthless as a as a denominational creed out there hey man you know better you've been just as well to stay in a denomination somewhere it shows you're not a part of the elevating of the chief of the harvest grain and you're certainly not a part of the waving because when he elevates you he lifts you up where all your sin is dead your tempers are gone your pride is gone your sins are gone the lust demons are dealt with no more do you have to pull them out of pornography don't even have to have a keeper on their own on their tablets or on their computers they got a keeper in their soul and man they can never go around they can never rise up above they can never kick out because once it seals it seals you to the day of redemption they don't want to be free from it they are happy amen they're part of the bride age aren't you glad to be a part of that ace part of the waving stand together as the musicians come now for the bright age for resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message anybody want to hear what the message is about this isn't it is the rising of the sun for the bride ate how many believes we're in the bright h for the bright age for out of our resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there that's the message the message is is the word is here in its full power and it's being waved over to people amen by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because i live you speaking to his wife shall live also what a resurrection that was 2 000 years ago when he was way before the people in the resurrection and what a resurrection this is when we're resurrected out of cold dark denominationalism back to the word again he was waved to them the word which he was and waved to them on the day of pentecost the word is made manifest and as i say is to be waved again in the last days don't tell me your anti-word things don't come and repeat the dogmas of the formal denominationalism of a christ yesterday and not today don't come along and say well we got the perfect word now and so now those like prophesying and in tongues and all that is all done away with because we got the perfect word that's not what he's saying he says that which is perfect has come and when that which is perfect has come then just having part of it is done away longer do we just have part of justification or sanctification or gifts but when we got the word we got out of it amen don't tell me you're childish that those things are thought childish because we're now so mature the message that came to us was waved over us it spoke in tongues it prophesied it healed the sick it made the cripples walk it opened the eyes of the blind it's a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back in its full power and has been waved over the people by the same wonders signs and wonders he did back there and that the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy ghost right among us and has given us life life michael has stood up the lamb has stood up he stands now and looks too angry eyes through the pill of fire he's turning on your enemy now he's turning on that enemy of mortality he's about to change you he's staying he's looking right down upon the dead in christ with angry eyes where death has laid him down in the grave year after year of year but there comes a time he looks then through the pillar of fire and all the way back from this age back to paul the last that went down will be the first each age will call its brethren and as each one calls its brethren as the voice of god ripples through the bride calling the resurrection the dead in christ shall rise we're living in the greatest hour that there's ever been because our god is a man of war he's looking at your enemy today he's got zeal that he's cut himself with he's got righteousness on his breast he's got a cloak of vengeance he's dressed to chase your adversary and i will be an adversary against your adversary and i will be of enemy to your enemy and one of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god will fight for you and you're not here fighting alone anymore little children for i am here in the midst of you in the pillar of fire and i'm here infusing faith into the hearts of people and send a message to turn your heart back from unbelief to believing again and i've seen my name in the book and when michael stood up all those whose names were in the book rises he calls for those names father you men of war this morning you actually became a man not a second person not a third person but the person not some minor god under god the lord god almighty the jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new it was god just changing his mask same god all the time that's the word that's been waved over us and our lord is a man of war lord i pray your people today get rid of discouragement it's a spirit get rid of the apathy the lukewarmness is a spirit the way to rid of the doldrums and the depression it's a spirit they just stop and see it's a spirit it's a spirit it's a spirit trying to tell them the word ain't for them promise isn't for them is the spirit our battle is not with flesh and blood but it's against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in heavenly places the higher we move in god the more we're opposed but it's the day when michael stands up you've stood you tore the seals off the book sent them down to the seventh angel on earth we're part of those who saw our names in the book of redemption i pray lord your people just take heart today as they realize we're on your side it's your battle and
