[17:24] be a blessing to the people there so you
[17:28] know what it is when others come here

[17:32] amen so we in turn you know want to be
[17:35] able to be a blessing there Genesis
[17:37] chapter 18 verse 9. and uh praying that
[17:41] God will bless you in a very special way
[17:44] today as we look into his word and look
[17:47] for his anointing upon it a man that God
[17:50] will speak to you in a very personal way
[17:54] today
[17:55] Genesis 18 verse 9 and they said unto
[17:57] him where is Sarah thy wife and he said
[18:00] behold in the tent and he will he said I
[18:03] will certainly return unto thee
[18:05] according to the time of life and Sarah
[18:07] thy wife shall have a son and Sarah
[18:09] heard it in the tent door which was
[18:11] behind him now Abraham and Sarah were
[18:14] well old and well-stricken in AIDS and
[18:17] it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[18:19] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[18:21] within herself
[18:22] saying after I am waxed old and shall I
[18:27] have pleasure my Lord being old also and
[18:32] the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did
[18:36] Sarah laugh saying shall I of assured he
[18:39] bear a child which I'm old is there
[18:43] anything too hard for the Lord
[18:46] at the time appointed I will return unto
[18:49] thee according to the time of life and
[18:51] Sarah shall have a son and then Sarah
[18:56] denied saying I laugh not for she was
[18:59] afraid and he said nay but thou did US
[19:02] life God bless you can be seated
[19:06] today I want to speak on changing our
[19:09] heart
[19:11] our mouth and our confession
[19:15] I touched a nerve last time I ministered
[19:17] I preached on Sarah what's your tongue
[19:20] you see God's word must be believed
[19:24] and like the old woman Sarah sitting in
[19:26] her unbelief scoffing at the promise her
[19:29] heart had to be changed from doubting to
[19:31] believing
[19:33] and it took the manifestation of God in
[19:36] the form of a man to discern her heart
[19:39] and turn it from the unbelief
[19:43] and that it held her it's so great and
[19:45] unbelief that in fact it was years of
[19:48] accumulated unbelief
[19:50] that that she when she would hear it
[19:53] from God himself she would actually
[19:55] scoff or laugh in the face of an
[19:58] all-knowing God and then try to cover it
[20:01] up by lying
[20:03] we went through it last week of the
[20:05] quotes for brother Branham said God
[20:06] would should have killed her right there
[20:08] but he said he couldn't do it because
[20:09] she's part of Abraham
[20:11] and he said the same with us the grace
[20:13] of God holds us even in our moments of
[20:17] unbelief and are doubting and confusion
[20:20] and and we had you to listen to the
[20:23] sermon speak to this mountain in San
[20:25] Jose where brother Branham you know went
[20:28] over the the third pull of his ministry
[20:31] and God was trying to show him the truth
[20:34] of Mark 11 23 and and the speaking of
[20:38] the word and and he you know I stumbled
[20:41] over that and disbelieved it and said
[20:43] well it wasn't even in the atonement and
[20:45] and so on because of unbelief that he
[20:49] had to even struggle and to believe that
[20:51] that scripture could be for us
[20:54] and then God trying to show it to him
[20:57] and steal in all of those moments of
[21:00] bumbling and stumbling and questioning
[21:02] and doubting and disbelieving and
[21:05] whatever else but God's grace overrode
[21:09] all of that
[21:11] amen and still honored the words of a
[21:14] man that was that spoke things into
[21:17] creation
[21:19] and and so it gives us a lot of Hope for
[21:23] ourselves when we realize that we how
[21:26] weak we are as human beings
[21:29] and how often that we doubt and Ponder
[21:32] and question and you know second guess
[21:35] and and uh uh doubt the promises of God
[21:39] and you know and so I'm like Sarah you
[21:44] know
[21:45] the old the woman the old woman the
[21:47] church she's not been Barren for 2 000
[21:50] years and she's been waiting on the
[21:53] promised son
[21:54] and for Jesus to return and and um she
[21:59] receives a visitation to turn her heart
[22:02] from acute years of accumulated doubts
[22:07] of misinterpreted Theology and unbelief
[22:11] back to the faith of when she was a
[22:15] young girl a young church so that she in
[22:19] her heart must return to being the bride
[22:22] that she was at Pentecost
[22:25] and remember you know I I can think of
[22:28] her you know remember what it was like
[22:31] to skip like a young girl to Sport with
[22:34] your husband uh remember what it was
[22:36] like to laugh and rejoice Sarah You're
[22:39] gonna laugh again
[22:41] you don't remember what it was to be
[22:43] beautiful and desirable and you're going
[22:46] to be so desirable that Jesus is coming
[22:48] back for you
[22:49] amen and so she is that little faith
[22:53] woman yes she's been a doubter but and
[22:56] it looks like God would have given up on
[22:59] her a long time ago but he can't because
[23:02] she is a part of Christ
[23:05] and what he had in his mind of her
[23:08] before the foundation of the world and
[23:10] she's going to be everything God said
[23:12] she would be
[23:13] and I want just to read what the prophet
[23:18] said and share what he could see with
[23:21] prophetic eyes and and these are a
[23:24] paraphrase of his word but this is taken
[23:26] from God of this evil age and he says a
[23:29] bride to church the word a people called
[23:31] out from here there for his name's sake
[23:34] will Unite with the body of Christ and
[23:37] the kingdom of the Antichrist will be
[23:39] taken and destroyed and Christ shall
[23:41] take the throne and set upon the throne
[23:43] of his father David and Reign upon the
[23:46] Earth for a thousand years and then
[23:48] present the church to God without
[23:50] spotter blemish sometimes I wonder how
[23:53] in the world is he going to do it with
[23:56] as many blemishes and spots and troubles
[23:59] and you know misunderstandings and
[24:02] doubtings and confusions and Men rising
[24:04] up with their own ideas and everything
[24:06] else and yet God said I'm going to do it
[24:09] amen that's what gives me a lot of
[24:12] Courage this morning for myself and for
[24:14] you too
[24:15] amen and he says I'll picture the bride
[24:18] of Christ now now the humble little
[24:20] bride of Christ is simply believes the
[24:23] word whoever she is the bride is made up
[24:26] of individuals and I hope and trust
[24:29] there's many sitting present missing he
[24:31] listening in and I hope that myself and
[24:34] every one of you all are part of that
[24:36] bride and and all that's been ordained
[24:38] to that will be that because it's their
[24:40] nature they see they recognize the word
[24:43] can only recognize the word now as he
[24:47] describes her he says her beautiful long
[24:49] or long hair Nazarite vowel shows his
[24:54] vow to God her beautiful gown of his
[24:57] promised word for the age that she's
[25:00] living in wrapped around her vindicating
[25:02] her with himself of Hebrews 13 and 8
[25:07] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[25:09] and forever
[25:10] and as she is part of the word groom
[25:13] true to him in every point
[25:17] the bride of Christ has vowed to Christ
[25:19] and he is the word a woman should not
[25:22] even wink at another man she should make
[25:24] no signs no emotions at all toward him
[25:27] for he is she is absolutely a bride to
[25:32] one bridegroom you listen to only one
[25:34] voice my sheep know my voice a stranger
[25:38] they will not follow and what is the
[25:41] voice any man's voice is his word and
[25:45] this is it the Bible not one word to be
[25:48] added to it or taken from it just stay
[25:51] right with that voice a stranger they
[25:54] will not follow a denomination as a she
[25:58] is a part of the groom true to him and
[26:00] every Point waiting for the wedding
[26:03] uniting in the sky at the wedding supper
[26:06] she's been given and revealed to her the
[26:09] seven seal Mysteries of the Bible and
[26:11] she sees the Folly of the deceiver so
[26:14] very close to the truth that almost
[26:16] deceived the elected see the real true
[26:21] Christian has Revelation or faith in his
[26:25] word she makes no claim of knowledge and
[26:29] they say well I've been got a doctor's
[26:31] degree makes no claim I believe his word
[26:34] doesn't claim to be educated doesn't
[26:36] belong to any denomination or any party
[26:39] or any sect she belongs to Christ she's
[26:43] his wife not the wife of a denomination
[26:46] but in obedience and this is what I want
[26:49] you to hear that little faith woman
[26:52] that lives by faith the bride believes
[26:57] the word she is obedience and waiting in
[27:02] love for the promise of the age to be
[27:05] confirmed she's watching for it she's a
[27:08] part of that word and she's watching for
[27:11] her life to manifest that word
[27:14] amen can you imagine here God speaking
[27:17] of you is brother Branham envisioned the
[27:20] bride that little faith woman
[27:23] now you may not feel like a little faith
[27:26] woman or a Little Faith Church is you
[27:29] know or whatever but we are the Bride of
[27:31] Jesus Christ and we and we have been
[27:34] called a little faith woman
[27:37] and the body said which is the word is
[27:40] waiting for the life which is the spirit
[27:42] to confirm it or make it alive that's
[27:45] what she's waiting for there's no other
[27:47] life for working her she came to come to
[27:50] life any other way yet she feels it out
[27:52] there and she knows it's going to happen
[27:54] then here it happens and then she wakes
[27:56] up and God says Let There Be and she
[27:59] come forth like the first one come forth
[28:01] so you see God is still creating the
[28:04] bride
[28:05] in His image
[28:07] and the word of the Angel put Sarah in
[28:12] position of a princess
[28:15] a stately dignified Lady of high rank
[28:20] but for too long she can only see
[28:23] herself as a failure
[28:25] as having gone too far
[28:28] too far gone or too old or unable
[28:32] undesirable
[28:34] why she couldn't even be desired even if
[28:37] as a wife to a hundred-year-old man you
[28:41] know she just wasn't desirable anymore
[28:44] and certainly two unable to fulfill the
[28:47] prophecy
[28:48] you see you see in her mind she was too
[28:52] weak
[28:53] she was too faithless to to even believe
[28:57] Hope was gone
[28:59] Not only was her body dead her faith was
[29:02] dead how do I know her faith was dead
[29:05] because faith without works is dead and
[29:08] she had no Works she had no belief you
[29:11] know she saw herself as one thing but
[29:14] God saw her as another
[29:16] that's what I want you to see about
[29:18] yourself today you may see yourself as
[29:21] one thing
[29:22] but I want you to understand the way God
[29:25] sees you you may see yourself as weak
[29:28] and unable and I don't have the ability
[29:32] to be an overcomer but God says you are
[29:36] Mighty in faith you're that little faith
[29:39] woman you're a people of a Rapture you
[29:43] are people of an end time
[29:45] word that has been manifested in the
[29:49] flesh today you see she would see
[29:51] herself as one thing but God was seeing
[29:55] her as another
[29:56] oh if today we can just see ourselves if
[29:59] as God sees us amen God didn't see a
[30:03] woman too old he didn't see a woman too
[30:06] feeble he didn't see a woman too unable
[30:09] he didn't see her too weak or too much
[30:12] doubt too much unbelief even though when
[30:16] he heard her unbelief and his Senator
[30:19] unbelief and called it out he said but
[30:22] that's not who you are
[30:24] you are not a doubter amen you are a
[30:28] Believer and the visitation of the angel
[30:31] came to turn her heart to believing
[30:35] again
[30:38] that's what this message has come to do
[30:42] amen it comes to Eternal hearts to
[30:45] believe in and the word calls us things
[30:49] that we don't even recognize
[30:52] about ourselves
[30:54] that we that couldn't possibly be me
[30:58] and the word says we are but now that
[31:00] couldn't possibly be me
[31:02] and there in a heart we just Ponder him
[31:05] Wonder scoff question
[31:09] maybe we don't even say it out loud but
[31:12] we have difficulty like Gideon back
[31:15] there hiding hiding there you know is uh
[31:20] and threshing a crop and and hiding away
[31:23] from fear of being seen and being stolen
[31:27] what he had and and robbed by the
[31:30] midianites and and and here hiding away
[31:33] and he he gets a visitation from an
[31:37] angel that says the Lord is with thee
[31:40] thou Mighty Man of Valor
[31:44] amen I imagine Gideon looked around to
[31:47] see who he was talking about because
[31:49] this couldn't surely be me he didn't
[31:52] feel like a mighty man of Valor he was
[31:55] over here scared and hiding and their
[31:58] threshing is weak but he was a mighty
[32:02] man of ours you see God was calling out
[32:04] the potential that was in him
[32:07] and that's the thing that I want you to
[32:09] know the message maybe you don't lie
[32:12] enough to it maybe you don't mess her up
[32:14] but God isn't talking about what you are
[32:17] now God is calling out the potential
[32:21] that it lays within that predestinated
[32:24] seed
[32:28] things that you can't even see
[32:31] things that you don't even recognize
[32:33] about yourself and yet the word of God
[32:36] said this is what you are
[32:40] brother Branham could not recognize
[32:42] himself as one who could speak to a
[32:44] mountain who could create a squirrel
[32:47] with words but God is true with showing
[32:51] him the potential
[32:52] that lays in the power of His word
[32:57] in spite of your unbelief
[33:02] listen God's going to have a Rapture
[33:04] he's going to have a bride in spite of
[33:07] yourself
[33:09] amen
[33:11] where is Sarah thy wife
[33:13] where's your wife where's the princess
[33:17] that's what he called her princess
[33:21] Sarah says I don't feel like no princess
[33:24] she laughs within herself
[33:26] too long you know she was identified as
[33:29] that barren woman
[33:31] that fruitless woman that woman it was
[33:35] never to be achiever the other that one
[33:38] that could only do it in a surrogate way
[33:40] the one who was always of failure and
[33:43] she laughs within her heart you know and
[33:45] within herself or within her heart
[33:48] but I want you to understand Sarah this
[33:51] 2000 year old bride you see your heart
[33:54] needed to be turned
[33:57] this is why he said in Malachi 4 5
[33:59] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[34:02] before the coming of the Great and the
[34:05] Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[34:08] turn what
[34:10] the heart
[34:12] amen that that inside part where you're
[34:15] scorning within yourself where you're
[34:17] laughing within yourself where you're
[34:19] questioning within yourself where you
[34:21] you know things you wouldn't even speak
[34:23] out loud but you're wondering
[34:25] you're questioning
[34:27] possibly could I do it would I can I
[34:30] ever measure up can I ever be a part can
[34:32] I really ever but he comes to turn your
[34:35] heart
[34:37] what
[34:38] to the fathers of the fathers to the
[34:41] children the heart of the children to
[34:42] their fathers lest I come and smite the
[34:46] Earth with a curse
[34:49] I want you to turn with me to Isaiah 55
[34:53] and verse 7 and let's learn something
[34:57] about our own self
[34:59] let's learn something about our thoughts
[35:02] and God's thoughts
[35:04] our our ideas and yet how Eternal God's
[35:09] word is you see the heart has to be
[35:12] turned back to the original faith that
[35:15] was once delivered to the Saints
[35:17] but it's not just the word is the
[35:19] theology but it's the word in power
[35:22] Isaiah 55 and 7 says let the wicked
[35:26] forsake his way you know to be a
[35:28] Christian you've got to forsake your way
[35:31] and the unrighteous man his thoughts and
[35:35] to become a Christian you got to quit
[35:37] thinking your old thoughts you got to
[35:40] have what's called in the Bible a
[35:42] renewing of your mind
[35:44] a change of your mindset
[35:47] and so he said and let him return unto
[35:50] the Lord and He will have mercy upon him
[35:53] and to our God and he will abundantly
[35:56] pardon you see the moment you forsake
[35:59] your way
[36:00] the moment you forsake your thoughts and
[36:04] you turn to the Lord that's when he will
[36:07] have mercy upon you and he and he will
[36:11] abundantly pardon the unbelief that you
[36:14] have held in your heart
[36:18] hallelujah amen when does that come when
[36:21] you start forsaking your way when they
[36:24] forget when it becomes where you forsake
[36:27] your own thoughts
[36:30] I'm unable
[36:32] God could never use me
[36:35] who am I Lord
[36:36] I'm too little
[36:38] I'm too insignificant
[36:41] I really ain't that important
[36:43] listen God says my thoughts
[36:47] are not your thoughts
[36:50] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[36:54] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[36:57] the earth so are my ways higher than
[37:00] your ways and my thoughts are are higher
[37:04] than your thoughts so God says my
[37:07] thoughts is Way Beyond this is why he
[37:10] said that he is able to do exceedingly
[37:13] abundantly above that which you are able
[37:17] to seek or ask you can't ask of God
[37:21] something big enough something hard
[37:23] enough something difficult enough come
[37:27] on this God there's nothing too hard for
[37:30] him
[37:31] amen and your problem isn't too
[37:34] insignificant
[37:39] brother Branham said God would raise up
[37:42] under the third pull a little
[37:45] insignificant minnow fish
[37:48] little nothing
[37:50] and show he has resurrection and life
[37:53] that God cares about little things
[37:59] I want you to know God cares about your
[38:01] little things
[38:06] Force the rain coming down in the snow
[38:09] from the heaven and returning not
[38:11] thither but water at the Earth and make
[38:13] it that come down and Bud bring forth
[38:15] and Bud that it may bring give seed to
[38:18] the sower and bread to the eater so
[38:21] shall my word be that goeth forth out of

[39:16] presence of the Lord instead of thorns

[39:21] usable instead of a briar another Thorn
[39:25] it shall be come up for a myrtle tree
[39:27] and it shall beads of the Lord for a
[39:29] name for an everlasting sign that shall
[39:33] not be cut off
[39:36] so the word will not return to God empty
[39:39] it shall accomplish what he sent it to

[39:44] in the moments of great calamity
[39:47] in the moment where the world is nervous
[39:51] in the moment where governments and

[42:12] word of God is a living power in you
[42:16] amen the word became a living power
[42:19] within Sarah
[42:20] arresting her thoughts changing her
[42:23] attitude
[42:24] amen enlarging her faith
[42:27] and finally changing her body
[42:31] come on Church you know that she was 90.
[42:34] she couldn't help that baby
[42:37] God had to change the body he had to
[42:40] bring her back to where she was can I
[42:43] say it this way the bright she wasn't
[42:45] Pentecost
[42:47] he had to read now her again he had to
[42:50] restore her
[42:52] and he had to fix the problem that
[42:54] caused her to stray to begin with
[42:56] to be barren
[42:58] when the angel came
[43:00] Sarah was faithless
[43:03] hopeless bitter angry old
[43:08] set in her ways
[43:11] but he turned her heart
[43:13] and she began to see herself
[43:16] as God saw her
[43:18] God said I don't see this old woman I
[43:21] see a young woman
[43:22] I don't see I don't see somebody that's
[43:25] feeble and and got a problem and hunts
[43:28] back and old and I Tremor in her voice
[43:33] I see a young woman
[43:35] I see one capable of bringing forth a
[43:38] child of chasing a baby
[43:41] of washing diapers
[43:43] amen of getting up during the night and
[43:45] tending to a little one yeah come on I
[43:48] see her I see her something different
[43:50] than it is and and he had to turn her
[43:53] heart where she could begin to see
[43:55] herself as God saw her
[43:57] she was a princess
[43:59] that's what God called her he made her
[44:02] name princess
[44:03] chosen come on
[44:05] elect
[44:07] desirable no longer a forsaken woman but
[44:11] a sought after woman
[44:13] not even just by her husband even but a
[44:16] young king would look upon her and she
[44:18] was so beautiful a beauty that had to
[44:21] come first on the inside
[44:26] trying to get something to you it had to
[44:28] first turn her heart
[44:31] and her heart become beautiful
[44:34] and her thoughts and become beautiful
[44:36] and then our words become beautiful
[44:41] Hallelujah and then her whole body began
[44:44] to become beautiful
[44:47] I'm trying to tell you something friends
[44:49] when your heart gets turned and began
[44:52] then to speak from the heart
[44:55] from the from the heart the mouth begins
[44:58] to speak
[45:00] amen and you begin to speak amen I am
[45:03] what he says I am I can do all things to
[45:07] Christ I am more than an overcomer I am
[45:10] I'm not a defeated person I am a
[45:14] conqueror I am an overcomer
[45:17] amen but it has to come first on the
[45:20] inside you see Sarah had a change in her
[45:24] heart first
[45:27] before the change of her body
[45:29] she started believing she was a princess
[45:33] amen not one by a substitution through a
[45:37] child of Hagar but that she was indeed
[45:40] absolutely indeed the Queen Mother of
[45:44] the abrahamic race
[45:46] brother when she began to think
[45:48] different she started walking with her
[45:51] shoulders back
[45:54] amen her head held up high
[45:57] and and God had called her a princess
[46:00] well if God calls me a princess
[46:04] I'm gonna act like a princess
[46:06] if God calls me bride I'm going to act
[46:09] like bride if God says I'm his son or
[46:12] his daughter I'm going to act like a son
[46:14] or daughter I'm going to behave like he
[46:17] called me
[46:18] amen God had called her a princess and
[46:21] that nagging feeling of I'll never be
[46:24] good enough
[46:25] I'm too weak
[46:27] my faith isn't that strong
[46:29] I'll never have enough
[46:32] I can never please God enough
[46:34] it's too much God expects too much of me
[46:39] you know it's that spirit of fear that
[46:41] that wants to sneak up on you and
[46:44] overwhelm you
[46:46] and keep you trying to pry its Wicked
[46:49] fingers off of your neck you know it's
[46:51] that spirit of fear that wants to choke
[46:54] you down
[46:55] and hold you back
[47:01] God wants you to know you're loved
[47:05] you're cared about he says in Isaiah 43
[47:08] and 4 you are precious in my eyes and
[47:12] you are honored and I love you
[47:15] isn't that wonderful you are precious in
[47:18] my eyes
[47:19] you are honored
[47:21] and I love you God wants you to know I
[47:24] love you
[47:25] amen God the psalm says God is within
[47:30] her and she shall not fall
[47:33] Jesus said in John 15 9 he said the
[47:36] father as a father has loved me so have
[47:39] I loved you abide in my love
[47:43] this is what God wants for you to know
[47:46] that you're loved
[47:48] that he cares about you as he would say
[47:51] cast all your cares on me because I care
[47:54] for you
[47:55] but in spite of that you feel doubtful
[47:58] how can he love me
[48:01] I've never done anything worthy of being
[48:03] loved
[48:05] but this is what the god the Bible says
[48:07] says you are worthy in fact the matter
[48:10] is he says you're somebody I'll fight
[48:13] for
[48:14] he said the Lord will fight for you and
[48:17] you only need to be still
[48:19] amen you don't have to do a thing but
[48:21] just trust in me
[48:23] amen that's all you have to do just stay
[48:25] be still amen and trust in me and I'm
[48:29] going to fight for you can you imagine
[48:31] God fighting on your behalf
[48:35] that you're worse you're worth fighting
[48:38] over
[48:41] come on now if Michael would fight over
[48:44] the dead body of Moses
[48:48] amen that don't you know God's gonna
[48:50] fight over the body of his bride
[48:54] Hallelujah don't you know he's fighting
[48:56] for you this morning
[49:00] as God says you're worth fighting for he
[49:04] says are not five sparrows sold for two
[49:07] copper coins and not one of them is
[49:09] forgotten before God he said I want you
[49:12] to know they out there said there's two
[49:15] of them that are that are sold for just
[49:18] you know
[49:19] five sparrows sold for two copper coins
[49:22] they're almost worthless
[49:24] but he says none of them are forgotten
[49:27] by God
[49:28] amen I'm the god of the insignificant
[49:32] I'm the god of even those that people
[49:34] don't think anything of
[49:36] and he said but he said about you now
[49:39] now wait a minute you
[49:42] you're very hairs of your head are
[49:45] numbered
[49:46] that's how close I know you
[49:50] that's how intimate I am with you amen
[49:53] that I that the very hairs of your head
[49:56] are numbered so don't fear no more
[50:00] he said you're more value than sparrows
[50:05] they're so insignificant man will sell
[50:08] them for nothing
[50:09] for pennies but for you oh my amount
[50:14] you're you're not insignificant you are
[50:17] worthy you are mine you are sought after
[50:21] you are cared about you are loved you
[50:25] are wanted you are desirable you are
[50:28] needed
[50:31] [Music]
[50:32] Hallelujah
[50:35] it's the God who goes before you it's
[50:38] the Lord who goes before you he will be
[50:40] with you he will never leave you or
[50:43] forsake you do not fear or be dismayed
[50:46] listen to these words that's Deuteronomy
[50:49] 31 and 8 but nevertheless these words
[50:52] are saying you you know you know that
[50:56] you are valuable
[50:58] that you're admirable that you're
[51:01] precious that you're worthwhile
[51:04] it's so hard sometimes to see ourselves
[51:06] in that light
[51:08] are you are you just you're so afraid
[51:11] that you just don't measure up somehow
[51:14] dude you know you have difficulty
[51:17] understanding how could I be valuable
[51:21] in God's eyes
[51:23] you see
[51:24] with Sarah there had to be something
[51:27] else rural or hard oh sitting in this
[51:30] tent if you hear Brother Branham talk
[51:32] about it
[51:33] um I think it's in the messages anything
[51:35] too hard for the Lord he tells about the
[51:37] mood that Sarah was in
[51:40] yeah you know and and the house he was
[51:42] thinking you know how left out she was
[51:45] and how Lot's wife got this and how'd
[51:48] this happen you know looking out at
[51:49] others and she was feeling this feelings
[51:52] of of uh being overlooked being uncared
[51:57] for
[51:57] God that just passed over her yeah
[52:01] Abraham had this son and and you know he
[52:03] had to Hagar as a as a surrogate mother
[52:07] and yet you know you know in years to
[52:09] come Sarah's not going to be the mother
[52:11] of the race Hagar is
[52:16] right now we're just given lift service
[52:18] Sarah's mother she's the wife she's the
[52:22] woman but Hagar is the real mother
[52:28] and all of this unbelief was ruling her
[52:31] heart
[52:33] but you see they had to come and turn
[52:35] into the heart where the peace of God
[52:38] began to rule her heart
[52:40] no longer did negative thoughts rule her
[52:42] heart
[52:44] as brother Brandon said you can never
[52:46] get anything from God with a negative
[52:48] thought
[52:49] he that cometh to God must believe that
[52:51] he is and that he's a rewarder of them
[52:54] that diligently seek him keep thinking
[52:56] that if there be any praise if there be
[52:58] any virtue think on these things
[53:01] you see the the word of the son of man
[53:06] God includes of a man God and human does
[53:10] his word began to rule her heart
[53:14] this is what we got to do as message
[53:16] Believers start letting the word rule
[53:20] our hearts not what's set on CNN or Fox
[53:23] News or in your bank account or what in
[53:26] the economy or the inflation all of that
[53:29] rule in your heart but let the peace of
[53:32] God rule your heart into which you're
[53:36] called in one body and be thankful
[53:39] as he sounds in Colossians 3 16 let the
[53:43] word of God dwell in you richly
[53:46] in all wisdom teaching and admonishing
[53:50] one another in Psalms and hymns and
[53:54] spiritual songs singing with Grace in
[53:57] your heart let you know the verse before
[53:59] it said let the peace of God rule
[54:02] then we'll let the word dwell in you
[54:04] richly how in the world is the peace of
[54:08] God going to rule when your mind is full
[54:10] of all the negativity that's in the

[1:02:57] upon your enemy what's going to happen
[1:02:59] to cancer
[1:03:02] what's going to happen to trouble come
[1:03:04] on what's going to happen to the devil
[1:03:07] you're going to see your desire upon
[1:03:09] your enemy amen your heart is fixed now
[1:03:13] brother Branham tells us in the
[1:03:15] pergamian church age he gives us a few
[1:03:17] Keys here and he says Jesus knew that
[1:03:22] there was going to be a terrible Drift
[1:03:23] from the word in the pergamian age as it
[1:03:26] was 200 years off of the past from the
[1:03:28] Patmos Vision he knew the drift would
[1:03:31] cause him to go in the Dark Ages he knew
[1:03:33] that the way that man originally got
[1:03:35] away from God was my first leaving the
[1:03:38] word now here here's the source of any
[1:03:40] problem you'll have leaving the word
[1:03:46] come on
[1:03:48] leaving the word if you leave that word
[1:03:50] you've left God so it's backsliding
[1:03:54] thus he is presenting himself to the
[1:03:57] church at Perkins indeed to all the
[1:04:00] churches of all ages that's us
[1:04:03] I am the word what's now if you want
[1:04:05] deity in your midst
[1:04:09] then welcome and receive the word
[1:04:12] hello don't let anything or anyone get
[1:04:16] between you and that word this is which
[1:04:18] I'm giving you the word is a revelation
[1:04:20] of myself I am the word remember that
[1:04:25] well brother Tim glory to God we have
[1:04:28] received the message and man we have
[1:04:30] welcomed the word the seals and
[1:04:31] Mysteries the Rebellion Revelation and
[1:04:33] how to dress and and God sent a prophet
[1:04:36] Hallelujah well what about his word
[1:04:37] about healing
[1:04:42] amen what about his word about healing
[1:04:45] I'm asking
[1:04:46] the Bible said in Deuteronomy 7 15 and
[1:04:50] the Lord will take away from you all
[1:04:52] sickness and will afflict you with none
[1:04:56] of the terrible diseases of Egypt which
[1:04:58] you have known
[1:05:00] so you see he's going to take away all
[1:05:03] sickness
[1:05:04] are you with me now amen if you're sick
[1:05:08] welcome that word
[1:05:11] amen welcome that word if you because
[1:05:14] what that brings deity
[1:05:17] in on the scene when you welcome and
[1:05:21] receive the word
[1:05:23] the Lord will take away all your
[1:05:25] sickness and will afflict you with none
[1:05:28] of the terrible diseases of Egypt which
[1:05:30] you've known now let me just say this
[1:05:34] no sickness is from God
[1:05:42] the Bible said he takes away sickness
[1:05:46] not that he brings sickness
[1:05:50] he promised that he would not afflict us
[1:05:53] with any of the terrible diseases of
[1:05:56] Egypt
[1:05:58] all sicknesses of the devil
[1:06:01] God did not bring it but he will take it
[1:06:04] away
[1:06:05] amen it's a foreign life it's a demonic
[1:06:08] life
[1:06:09] amen but we have the right to cast it
[1:06:12] out
[1:06:14] but the only way you'll ever cast it out
[1:06:16] is you've got to First believe the word
[1:06:21] oh brother Timmy brother Joe we just lay
[1:06:23] handsome and give me a private work it's
[1:06:25] not that's a secondary
[1:06:28] a prophet Vision or a prophet word even
[1:06:30] if Brother Brad and brother Brandon said
[1:06:32] the Visions I don't have them the thing
[1:06:34] is a secondary way of God speaking
[1:06:37] even in preaching like I'm preaching
[1:06:40] this morning is a secondary way of God
[1:06:42] speaking but he said God's first way of
[1:06:45] speaking is his Bible the word of God
[1:06:51] this is as fast
[1:06:54] and it can't go different I don't care
[1:06:56] what a prophet said or anybody else said
[1:06:58] if an angel comes from Heaven says any
[1:07:00] other thing he's accursed
[1:07:04] yes if you want God to come on to sing
[1:07:06] welcome the word
[1:07:08] receive it quit thinking well I'm sick
[1:07:13] God what did I do this time
[1:07:17] how did I fail you
[1:07:20] what did I do
[1:07:23] why are we always blaming our
[1:07:25] relationship with God
[1:07:27] like he's just watching now for you to
[1:07:29] slip up somewhere so he can get you
[1:07:36] all his eyes on us brother Tim he's
[1:07:39] looking out
[1:07:41] he's trying to find an excuse to punish
[1:07:44] us
[1:07:45] send us to help balance this forever
[1:07:51] why are we blaming our relationship with
[1:07:53] God
[1:07:55] every time that something has I I'm sick
[1:07:59] though I must have failed God you're
[1:08:00] sick I'm going to tell you why you're
[1:08:03] sick because you're human
[1:08:06] and your body was perverted from
[1:08:08] perfection
[1:08:10] when God originally made man he couldn't
[1:08:12] get sick
[1:08:13] God didn't listen to all sicknesses of
[1:08:16] the devil
[1:08:18] amen and because your body was perverted
[1:08:21] from Perfection it's now open to the
[1:08:23] tormenting Spirit of the devil
[1:08:26] so Satan's Army brings diseases that's
[1:08:29] what he is he's a destroyer Satan the
[1:08:33] kingdom of Satan is sickness death
[1:08:35] sorrow frustration worry all on Satan
[1:08:38] God is life Faith peace Joy amen and
[1:08:42] those are the two forces coming together
[1:08:44] right now and they're battling right now
[1:08:48] not just in this building but right in
[1:08:50] your mind
[1:08:52] amen because that's where the greatest
[1:08:54] battle has ever fought
[1:08:56] amen and the only way that you're going
[1:08:58] to win the Battle Is by changing your
[1:09:00] mind to start believing what God's word
[1:09:03] said
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:05] amen or Heather either you're given
[1:09:09] weapons to the devil to destroy you
[1:09:13] they battle right here day by day
[1:09:16] every day Satan
[1:09:18] his brother Branham said following you
[1:09:21] along that great big kingly Priestly
[1:09:23] Goliath trying to scare the liver out of
[1:09:26] you
[1:09:27] well I'll tell you what don't look on
[1:09:29] the internet to see about your problem
[1:09:30] you'll get your liver and your gizzard
[1:09:32] and everything else cared out of you
[1:09:37] amen look in the Bible to see about your
[1:09:40] situation
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:44] amen you you know be fortified with the
[1:09:48] gospel with the word of truths around
[1:09:51] your loin amen a Hellman of Salvation a
[1:09:54] shield of Faith a sword weaving in your
[1:09:57] hand and say Satan I'm coming to meet
[1:09:59] you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:10] so brother Brandon says I wonder if
[1:10:12] we're sufficiently impressed with the
[1:10:15] word in our midst I wonder God's trying
[1:10:18] to show us the power in it for he even
[1:10:20] brings the word he shows us the power it
[1:10:22] healed the blind
[1:10:24] the deaf the dumb cripples walk
[1:10:27] those as hideously in in crippled shape
[1:10:32] you know turned and made human again
[1:10:37] it did
[1:10:38] buns crack everything else spines that
[1:10:41] were Twisted come together God's showing
[1:10:44] us for even brings the message he's
[1:10:46] first showing us the power of it
[1:10:49] then before the third pull in the
[1:10:51] opening of The Seven Seals which is the
[1:10:53] revealing of the word which was the
[1:10:55] third phase he shows you the power of it
[1:10:58] amen what will it do it'll create it'll
[1:11:01] resurrects it'll save
[1:11:03] it'll heal it'll change atmospheres
[1:11:07] Hallelujah
[1:11:09] amen it'll qualm the storms in your life
[1:11:13] now brother Branham tells us to fulfill
[1:11:16] his word he must keep his word
[1:11:19] I've often wondered
[1:11:21] when they would see his word manifested
[1:11:24] what would they do about it and say oh
[1:11:25] well some says it's to telepathy others
[1:11:29] said it's a wild imagination
[1:11:31] pretty good imagination
[1:11:33] they called out names and afflictions
[1:11:36] and
[1:11:37] troubles and
[1:11:39] what the doctor said that's pretty good
[1:11:40] imagination
[1:11:42] amen telepathy that's pretty good mind
[1:11:45] reading
[1:11:50] examine it by the word God's word
[1:11:52] promised it all heavens and earth shall
[1:11:54] pass away but my word shall never fail
[1:11:56] open that door of faith when Jesus was
[1:11:59] on the earth he knew that that scripture
[1:12:02] pertained to him would said if you
[1:12:04] destroy this body I'll raise it up again
[1:12:07] in three days the prophet said I'll not
[1:12:10] suffer my Holy One to see corruption
[1:12:12] neither will I leave his soul in hell he
[1:12:16] knew that scripture pertained to him and
[1:12:19] he was for he was the Messiah and he
[1:12:21] knew it his unfailing faith put him in
[1:12:25] position to know that he was the perfect
[1:12:27] born son of God
[1:12:30] if your faith will put you in position
[1:12:32] to know that every Divine promise of
[1:12:35] God's Bible is for you just just as sure
[1:12:38] as it pertained to him every promise
[1:12:41] pertains to you oh this ought to change
[1:12:44] your attitude about the written word
[1:12:47] amen you're healing your salvation your
[1:12:49] freedom from sin your selfishness and
[1:12:52] your your indifference your little
[1:12:54] turtle shell you want to pull yourself
[1:12:55] into Christ come in to be Lord and ruler
[1:12:58] to set you free from those things but we
[1:13:02] won't do it and he said the reason why
[1:13:04] is because
[1:13:05] people are fulfilling the scripture
[1:13:08] of being lukewarm cold and formal
[1:13:13] I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed
[1:13:17] with the word in our midst
[1:13:19] we received a message from an angel
[1:13:22] do we believe what it said
[1:13:28] let me give you a thought here he says
[1:13:30] how do we pray
[1:13:31] we pray in Jesus name don't we every
[1:13:34] prayer is in his name or there isn't any
[1:13:37] answer
[1:13:38] yet in first John 5 14 we're told this
[1:13:41] is a confidence we have in him that if
[1:13:42] we ask anything according to his will he
[1:13:44] heareth us
[1:13:47] you know the first thing you got to do
[1:13:49] is decide whether it's God's will or not
[1:13:54] well I don't know if it's God's will to
[1:13:56] heal me well then you better figure it
[1:13:58] out
[1:14:01] the Bible said it is
[1:14:04] God showed his will in Jesus he healed
[1:14:06] the sick everywhere he went he was he
[1:14:09] was the Divine will of God made manifest
[1:14:11] his attitude toward the sick is the same
[1:14:13] today as it was then
[1:14:15] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:14:17] and forever somebody help me preach
[1:14:20] so the first thing you got to do is that
[1:14:21] God's will to heal me yes it's God's
[1:14:23] will to heal me he said it over and over
[1:14:26] and over and over and over and over and
[1:14:27] over and over and again in this word
[1:14:31] so this is a confidence
[1:14:34] that we have in him that if we ask
[1:14:37] anything according to his will he Hearth
[1:14:40] his we know that he hears us whatsoever
[1:14:42] we ask we know that we have the
[1:14:45] petitions we desire to him
[1:14:47] so now we ask
[1:14:48] what is the will of God
[1:14:51] there's only one way to know his will
[1:14:54] and that's by the word of God
[1:14:57] so what's the word of God about healing
[1:14:59] what's the word about he gifts what's
[1:15:02] the word about miracles what is the word
[1:15:05] of God about your your needs what is the
[1:15:08] word of God about you
[1:15:12] are you just happen sense
[1:15:14] did you just accidentally come are you
[1:15:16] just a second thought
[1:15:19] you were in his thinking before the
[1:15:21] foundation of the world you're chosen
[1:15:25] you've been called you've been placed in
[1:15:27] this age not to be a failure
[1:15:31] come on Sarah
[1:15:33] you viewed yourself as a failure way too
[1:15:35] long
[1:15:36] quit looking at yourself as I can't and
[1:15:40] begin to realize God placed me here
[1:15:42] because he knew I could
[1:15:49] lamentation 3 37 who is he that saith
[1:15:52] and he come to pass when the Lord
[1:15:53] commanded not therefore there it is if
[1:15:56] it isn't in the words you can't have it
[1:15:58] we can't ask unless it's in the word and
[1:16:01] we can't petition or ask unless it's in
[1:16:03] his name there it is again Jesus the
[1:16:06] name is the word the will you can't
[1:16:08] separate God in his word they are one so
[1:16:10] I can have healing because it's in the
[1:16:13] word
[1:16:14] I can have peace
[1:16:17] because it's in the word
[1:16:21] amen John 14 27 peace I leave with you
[1:16:25] my peace I've given to you not as the
[1:16:28] world giveth I give I to you let not
[1:16:31] your heart be troubled
[1:16:33] neither Let It Be Afraid
[1:16:36] now here's what God is saying now listen
[1:16:38] if you are capable of becoming this he
[1:16:41] could never say it
[1:16:42] but the very fact that he said it makes
[1:16:45] you capable of coming this
[1:16:47] Amen Let not your heart be troubled
[1:16:51] neither Let It Be Afraid
[1:16:57] so then he brings it right down to the
[1:16:58] word he left behind on pretty page so
[1:17:01] here you go take your Bible open it up
[1:17:03] here's the word of God he's left behind
[1:17:05] on printed page
[1:17:07] it is a part of him
[1:17:09] when you accept it by faith into a
[1:17:12] Spirit-filled life
[1:17:13] he said his word was life
[1:17:17] that's exactly what he is he says I'm
[1:17:20] the way the truth and the life
[1:17:22] he says in Romans If any man have
[1:17:24] multiple Spirit of Christ he's none of
[1:17:26] his therefore he is Spirit he is life
[1:17:28] that's exactly what the word is that's
[1:17:31] exactly what Jesus is he is the word so
[1:17:35] when a spirit born I mean Spirit born
[1:17:39] spear-filled man in faith takes that
[1:17:42] word into his heart and places it upon
[1:17:45] his lips while that is the same as deity
[1:17:48] speaking Every Mountain has to go
[1:17:51] Satan cannot stand before that man
[1:17:56] Hallelujah taken the word of printed
[1:18:00] Pages believing it in the heart placing
[1:18:03] upon your lips every Mountain has to go
[1:18:06] Satan cannot stand before it is written
[1:18:11] it is written it is written it is
[1:18:14] written
[1:18:22] if the church way back in the third age
[1:18:24] it only held on to the Revelation see
[1:18:27] that's what the devil's trying to do to
[1:18:29] us get us to let go of the revelation of
[1:18:32] the Living Word in our midst Living Word
[1:18:35] not dead word not a Creed not just a
[1:18:38] message with no life in it
[1:18:41] a word with power
[1:18:44] the power of God would have never faded
[1:18:46] as it did in those dark cases and right
[1:18:48] today how many is ready for this right
[1:18:51] today when the church returns to the
[1:18:54] word in faith we can say without a doubt
[1:18:57] that the glory of God and the Wonder
[1:18:59] sacks of God will be in her midst again
[1:19:04] Hallelujah let me announce it loud and
[1:19:07] clear when she returns in faith that
[1:19:10] little faith woman
[1:19:12] this one that one here there that bride
[1:19:15] this one here there whoever you are
[1:19:17] individuals when you return in faith
[1:19:21] Hallelujah the glory of God in this
[1:19:24] wonderful acts of God will be in amidst
[1:19:27] again
[1:19:32] she will
[1:19:35] because she is that little fake woman
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:42] and she must understand and know her
[1:19:46] position
[1:19:47] as Princess
[1:19:53] David knew his position
[1:19:57] he had been anointed

[1:20:39] the Living God
[1:20:41] if he dares to resist that name
[1:20:45] if he steps out in boldness
[1:20:48] walking out to try to defeat this bride
[1:20:52] his head will come off
[1:20:58] not us to feed it
[1:21:00] we have been anointed to sit on the
[1:21:02] throne
[1:21:04] David knew his position
[1:21:08] every morning

[1:22:41] it in my sling of prayer
[1:22:44] hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to put

[1:23:24] Hallelujah David was a dancing before he
[1:23:28] ever met Goliath he was dancing out to
[1:23:31] battle he had a song in his heart he had
[1:23:34] to replace it I am who he said I am I am
[1:23:41] I am the king
[1:23:50] where is that Goliath where is that
[1:23:53] country eating you up where is those
[1:23:55] cataracts where is that crippled are
[1:23:57] where is that problem where is that
[1:24:00] devil
[1:24:08] the devil said well you might as well

[1:24:12] doctor said this and that listen the
[1:24:15] Christ that made you stop drinking
[1:24:17] that's made you stop smoking and lying
[1:24:20] and stealing that saved your life from a
[1:24:22] life of drunkenness from sin and from a
[1:24:24] devil's grave if that God could do that
[1:24:27] for you
[1:24:29] Hallelujah he will save you from your
[1:24:31] cancer your TP your old age Problem
[1:24:35] whatever it is
[1:24:39] I have been laughed after saying it but
[1:24:41] I'm gonna say it again you do not have
[1:24:43] to die sick
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:48] you can die healthy and well and change
[1:24:51] dimensions
[1:24:54] Hallelujah
[1:24:56] amen I'll tell you what church don't you
[1:24:59] give up on me
[1:25:01] don't you just discount me don't you say
[1:25:04] well he's just too old and and yeah just
[1:25:08] a little bit too feeble you know to
[1:25:09] carry the load no I ain't
[1:25:11] [Applause]
[1:25:15] in the world
[1:25:17] Hallelujah I'm here to the end
[1:25:28] Hallelujah but you've got to position
[1:25:31] yourself in the Word of Promise
[1:25:34] the promise of the word
[1:25:36] so the restoration promise
[1:25:39] is a a promise
[1:25:42] of a word of returning to the word in
[1:25:44] faith
[1:25:46] and then no doubt without a doubt the
[1:25:49] glory and wonderful acts of God will be
[1:25:52] in her head so the word is not simply
[1:25:56] theology we have turned this message
[1:25:58] into theology
[1:26:01] into Creeds
[1:26:03] dogmas anytime you hear Brother Branham
[1:26:06] called Creeds and dogmas that's what men
[1:26:08] have turned the message into
[1:26:13] you know it's just a statement of faith
[1:26:16] this is what we believe
[1:26:18] but there's no power to it
[1:26:21] and by the way God hates a powerless
[1:26:24] religion
[1:26:26] and God the only thing that will please
[1:26:28] him is when people believe him
[1:26:32] amen I know this bride is going to
[1:26:35] please him
[1:26:36] amen listen listen Jesus Jesus did more
[1:26:41] than just teaching you see to teach only
[1:26:44] is is just denominationalism we just
[1:26:46] turned this into lectures you know and
[1:26:49] and God you know don't have no power in
[1:26:52] it so we got to incorporate from the
[1:26:54] denominations there's psychology to fix
[1:26:57] our problems and you know but I want you
[1:26:59] to remember
[1:27:00] I always keep this in mind that the
[1:27:03] difference between two doctrines true
[1:27:05] Doctrine and Pharisee Doctrine is a true
[1:27:10] doctrine of Jesus is not in word only
[1:27:14] but it is that the word in action or the
[1:27:17] word in power
[1:27:19] you see Matthew 7 29 said the people
[1:27:22] were astonished at his Doctrine because
[1:27:25] he taught it whereas one have an
[1:27:27] authority you see there was an authority
[1:27:30] when he preached the word
[1:27:32] there again when in Mark 1 27 they were
[1:27:36] all amazed in so much the question among
[1:27:38] themselves saying what thing is this
[1:27:41] what new doctrine is this for with
[1:27:44] authority commandeth he even the evil
[1:27:48] unclean spirits and they do obey him
[1:27:51] true Doctrine gives power over unclean
[1:27:55] spirits that's why I know men are not
[1:27:58] preaching true Doctrine
[1:28:00] when they have to go to psychology to
[1:28:04] find Deliverance for their people
[1:28:08] I know they're not preaching the truths
[1:28:11] oh well they're quoting the quotes the
[1:28:12] devil does too
[1:28:14] but it's a word without power
[1:28:16] it's a word without life
[1:28:19] now so you see true Doctrine gives you
[1:28:22] authority over the devil I'll say well
[1:28:23] brother Tim we've got great revelation
[1:28:25] we we actually know more than anybody
[1:28:27] else watch you we leave the
[1:28:29] denominations and the dust praise God
[1:28:31] you know but it's the revelation of God
[1:28:34] that will give you authority over the
[1:28:37] devil
[1:28:38] so true Revelation gives you authority
[1:28:42] over the devil and now we are seated
[1:28:45] with him with power and authority over
[1:28:47] every devil oh he said if you can only
[1:28:50] believe what God has given and if you're
[1:28:53] seated there you will use it for your
[1:28:55] ordained to do what you are to do
[1:28:58] now Jesus of course would read himself
[1:29:02] right into the scripture
[1:29:05] hello
[1:29:07] I'm trying to get you to crack your
[1:29:09] Bible open
[1:29:10] dust it off Jesus read himself right
[1:29:14] into the scripture he relied upon
[1:29:18] knowing he was the word
[1:29:20] you see he had faith in God who made him
[1:29:23] the word this bridey is a word bride she
[1:29:27] has faith in God who said you are the
[1:29:30] word
[1:29:31] amen you are the word of restoration you
[1:29:34] are the word of power
[1:29:35] you're the Word of Deliverance
[1:29:38] amen and you see they that gave him
[1:29:42] Faith because he understood his position
[1:29:45] you see princes has a position
[1:29:50] pride has a position
[1:29:53] come on
[1:29:54] you have a position because of the
[1:29:58] relationship son or daughter has a
[1:30:01] position
[1:30:05] amen so he knew what he said he knew who
[1:30:09] he was because the scripture said he was
[1:30:12] at
[1:30:13] and and hear every scripture tied in see
[1:30:17] it wasn't just one scripture but all the
[1:30:19] scripture tying in over and over and
[1:30:21] again and he knew exactly what the
[1:30:24] scripture said that it would be in fact
[1:30:26] the matter is he said search the
[1:30:28] scriptures in them you think you have
[1:30:31] eternal life but they are testifying of
[1:30:34] me
[1:30:37] amen listen there again this is what you
[1:30:41] must do yourself the bride must be able
[1:30:43] to say the same thing search the
[1:30:46] scripture for they testify of who I am
[1:30:50] amen God said he would have a bride in
[1:30:53] this day and if he then then of course
[1:30:55] he said if he did that with that he
[1:30:57] relied upon what God made him if he did
[1:31:01] that that can't we rely on what God made
[1:31:04] us as Believers these signs shall follow
[1:31:08] them that believe he had faith in what
[1:31:11] he was
[1:31:12] and if you're a Believer you have faith
[1:31:15] in what you are you are a believer
[1:31:22] have faith in yourself as a believer
[1:31:25] not a doubter
[1:31:27] not weak
[1:31:28] Come on talk in the devil's language
[1:31:31] I'm weak I don't have very much faith my
[1:31:34] faith isn't very strong
[1:31:38] don't let your heart condemn you let
[1:31:41] your heart be turned
[1:31:44] you see you're letting your heart be
[1:31:46] condemned
[1:31:47] let not your heart be troubled believe
[1:31:51] D look what he's saying of course if
[1:31:54] you're doing things wrong repent
[1:31:57] Amen Let Him remove Sims as far as the
[1:32:00] East is from the West because otherwise
[1:32:03] you can't have confidence that he hears
[1:32:05] you
[1:32:06] amen so you if there's something you did
[1:32:08] wrong well repent
[1:32:10] well I search and assertion of search
[1:32:12] and I quit I couldn't find that quit
[1:32:14] searching then and it's except
[1:32:16] forgiveness
[1:32:24] but when your heart couldn't can't don't
[1:32:26] condemn you and you know you're a
[1:32:27] Believer there's nothing between you and
[1:32:29] God you can ask what you will and know
[1:32:31] it'll be given because this the word
[1:32:34] that's been has given to you just like
[1:32:36] it was those disciples because it's the
[1:32:39] words it's given to you just like it was
[1:32:41] to those disciples could you could you
[1:32:43] accept that that this Bible this word is
[1:32:46] given to me just like it was to Peter
[1:32:50] James and John
[1:32:52] just like it was to Rahab or Elizabeth
[1:32:56] or whoever in the Bible
[1:33:01] come on the word is given to you just
[1:33:03] like it was to those now the only thing
[1:33:05] you have to do then is have faith in
[1:33:08] what you are
[1:33:10] have faith in what the word says you are
[1:33:14] amen because whatever the word said
[1:33:16] about me that's what I am though I don't
[1:33:18] see it yet that's what I am
[1:33:21] and Jesus had faith in the word that
[1:33:24] said what he was is written of me and he
[1:33:27] said didn't David in the Psalms and the
[1:33:29] prophet and all them speak of him said
[1:33:31] I'm the bread of life that come down
[1:33:33] from God out of Heaven I am the Tree of
[1:33:36] Life from the Garden of Eden I am all of
[1:33:39] these things I am that I am
[1:33:42] now so you see
[1:33:45] a Believer he said is the faith of God
[1:33:47] that moves in you
[1:33:49] so because you are a Believer the faith
[1:33:52] of God is moving in you it's an action
[1:33:55] first Peter 3 and 12 sister Genie sent
[1:33:58] me this this week and it blessed my
[1:34:00] heart for the eyes of the Lord are all
[1:34:03] are over the righteous
[1:34:05] and his ears are open unto their prayers
[1:34:11] that ought to make everyone of you shout
[1:34:13] the eyes of the Lord are over the
[1:34:16] righteous and his ears are open unto
[1:34:20] their prayers
[1:34:21] God listens when you talk
[1:34:25] even Sarah when you just kind of set it
[1:34:28] in your heart and it was scoring it God
[1:34:30] listen
[1:34:31] it hurt
[1:34:33] amen but when you say things that
[1:34:35] pleases him
[1:34:36] when you're agreeing with the word
[1:34:39] come on now amen his ears are open oh
[1:34:43] you got my attention
[1:34:45] you saying what I said
[1:34:47] amen you're in agreement with me your
[1:34:50] heart is in turn hey man it's been
[1:34:53] turned and it's in tune
[1:34:55] amen
[1:34:57] listen we're not to turn this message
[1:34:59] into a powerless religion
[1:35:01] you see it's the word of God and the
[1:35:03] word of God is quick or Alive the word
[1:35:06] of God is living and Powerful it is
[1:35:09] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:35:11] the Bible said in second Timothy 3 16
[1:35:13] and just let me quote it like this for
[1:35:16] all scripture is breathed out by God
[1:35:20] foreign
[1:35:22] how did I speak
[1:35:24] I breathed out words
[1:35:29] amen come on the word scripture had to
[1:35:32] come from God first
[1:35:34] and he breathed it out
[1:35:36] and spoke it and is profitable for
[1:35:40] teaching if I reproof for correction for
[1:35:43] training and righteousness that the man
[1:35:45] of God may be complete and equipped
[1:35:48] forever good work so again God gave you
[1:35:52] breathe God breathed words
[1:35:55] that have power in them Amen to equip
[1:35:59] you forever good work
[1:36:02] amen it's a living power and it's
[1:36:05] interject energy
[1:36:08] energetic and active listen brother
[1:36:11] Branham talked about it he said I read
[1:36:13] the Bible and here's his attitude toward
[1:36:16] it he said I read the Bible and I get up
[1:36:19] and run around the chair and scream to
[1:36:22] the top of my voice and cried a little
[1:36:25] bit and sat down and read a little more
[1:36:27] and get up and run around again don't
[1:36:30] sound like to me he's listening to the
[1:36:31] news
[1:36:35] don't sound like me he was listening to
[1:36:37] CNN
[1:36:38] he said I read the Bible and I get up
[1:36:41] and run around the chair
[1:36:44] scream to the top of my voice cry a
[1:36:48] little bit sit down read a little more
[1:36:50] and get up and run again around again
[1:36:53] he's I guess it's a mate or somebody
[1:36:54] come by they would think they had a
[1:36:56] maniac shut up in that room

[1:38:49] amen it's written Satan Jesus told Satan
[1:38:52] it is written
[1:38:54] and that mentally by every word and then
[1:38:58] of course Satan comes around tries to
[1:39:01] get him to doubt his experience isn't
[1:39:03] that the way it is
[1:39:04] you know no matter how great an
[1:39:06] experience you can have you can be
[1:39:08] baptized by a prophet
[1:39:10] a forerunner wrote of in the scripture
[1:39:13] and here he's standing there and and he
[1:39:17] sees the dove come down
[1:39:19] and the boy in heaven opened and a voice
[1:39:22] speak out
[1:39:23] this is my beloved Son this is the son I
[1:39:27] love I'm coming to dwell in him
[1:39:31] Hallelujah and he baptized he's baptized
[1:39:35] in John's as he's going to ask Behold
[1:39:37] the Lamb of God to take away the sin of
[1:39:40] the world
[1:39:41] well brother that's a pretty good
[1:39:43] experience ain't it
[1:39:45] amen wouldn't you like to have that
[1:39:47] experience at your baptism
[1:39:49] amen Jesus Sarah had that experience
[1:39:53] walks out with that great experience
[1:39:57] and doubts it
[1:40:01] you say he doubted it words are coming
[1:40:04] to him now
[1:40:06] you see he doesn't it's it defines that
[1:40:10] other person that is there that's not
[1:40:12] him
[1:40:15] but if you were just there you wouldn't
[1:40:17] see the devil
[1:40:22] and here he's having thoughts
[1:40:25] if
[1:40:27] you are really
[1:40:29] what
[1:40:30] haven't said you were
[1:40:33] then prove it
[1:40:37] you're hungry
[1:40:39] make these stones into bread
[1:40:43] come on
[1:40:44] what was it Satan was right there do you
[1:40:47] know the Bible said God led him into the
[1:40:49] wilderness
[1:40:50] other scriptures said you know it's
[1:40:52] found in
[1:40:54] Matthew 4 4 and Luke 4 4. so then so
[1:40:58] here here again what what do you find in
[1:41:00] the scripture there is saying that Jesus
[1:41:03] one of them says he was led of the
[1:41:05] spirit the other said he was driven of
[1:41:07] the spirit
[1:41:08] he was led and he was driven
[1:41:11] to go faith and adversary
[1:41:15] not a record devil
[1:41:18] but Satan himself
[1:41:21] nothing some little devil that might be
[1:41:23] assigned to you but the Devil Himself
[1:41:26] comes along and said now if you're the
[1:41:28] Son of God play trying to get him to
[1:41:31] doubt his experience you see that's the
[1:41:34] devil's job know who that is I'm
[1:41:37] doubting my experience no you're not the
[1:41:39] devil is putting doubts in your mind of
[1:41:42] your experience
[1:41:45] recognize who's speaking it ain't God
[1:41:50] never takes away what he gives you he's
[1:41:53] not an Indian giver
[1:41:55] somebody help me preach amen if God gave
[1:41:59] you the Holy Ghost I wish I had that
[1:42:01] experience listen every time
[1:42:05] listen to me real close every time that
[1:42:08] a person is born again
[1:42:10] the same thing happens Heaven opens the
[1:42:14] devil ascended and it's God saying when
[1:42:16] he gives you the Holy Ghost is God
[1:42:19] saying this is the son I love and I'm
[1:42:22] pleased to dwell in you
[1:42:25] otherwise he ain't coming to dwell
[1:42:28] but every person is ever born again has
[1:42:30] had that Jesus experience on the River
[1:42:33] Jordan come on amen what was it the
[1:42:36] heavens open the dove descended
[1:42:41] come on the voice says
[1:42:45] what is his voices the voices of his
[1:42:47] word this is my beloved Son and I'm
[1:42:51] happy I'm pleased to come live in him
[1:42:53] I'm giving him the Holy Ghost
[1:42:56] if you got the Holy Ghost that's what he
[1:42:58] said about you now that God said I love
[1:43:02] you the devil says he don't who are you
[1:43:04] going to believe
[1:43:05] [Applause]
[1:43:12] so you see
[1:43:15] faith
[1:43:16] you know sometimes
[1:43:18] when we look at the Bible
[1:43:21] we look at it as a book oh it's just
[1:43:23] hard to understand
[1:43:25] but God's word becomes very simple
[1:43:27] when we regard every word is true and
[1:43:30] then we act accordingly
[1:43:34] it's staggered truths of power and
[1:43:37] authority granted to the church then
[1:43:39] becomes a living reality
[1:43:42] faith is simply believing that God will
[1:43:45] do what he said he would do
[1:43:51] I said well I don't have much Faith well
[1:43:54] wait a minute what is Faith it's
[1:43:57] believing
[1:43:58] that God is able
[1:44:03] come on
[1:44:04] God didn't say to Sarah Sarah now you
[1:44:07] know
[1:44:08] you're 90 years old and you know you're
[1:44:11] strong enough you can do this girl
[1:44:13] and you can change
[1:44:15] and you can become Young
[1:44:17] and you can marry this child and you you
[1:44:20] can do this you got this God didn't say
[1:44:22] this God said I got this
[1:44:26] he didn't say is this too hard for you
[1:44:28] Sarah he knew it was too hard for Sarah
[1:44:31] God knows it's too hard for you
[1:44:34] it's too hard for you to live a
[1:44:36] Christian Life it's too hard for you to
[1:44:38] make a Rapture it's too hard for it come
[1:44:40] on it's too hard for you you can't heal
[1:44:43] yourself you can't save yourself but
[1:44:46] there's nothing too hard for the Lord
[1:44:48] change your mind your focus of who we're
[1:44:52] talking about
[1:44:53] [Applause]
[1:44:55] faith is believed in God will do
[1:44:59] what he said in his word he will do
[1:45:02] and Sarah receives strength when she
[1:45:06] judged him faithful
[1:45:10] she believed what God would say would do
[1:45:13] what he said she still didn't know how
[1:45:17] it still seemed unreasonable
[1:45:20] the circumstances were still there
[1:45:23] her hands still wrinkled
[1:45:25] her stoop seal in her shoulder but her
[1:45:29] heart began to believe
[1:45:32] and and this is what Abraham did Abraham
[1:45:34] simply believed that God would do what
[1:45:36] he said he would do
[1:45:38] and and God imputed it for righteousness
[1:45:40] and and the Book of Romans would say
[1:45:44] that David you know described the
[1:45:46] blessedness of a man whom God imputes
[1:45:50] righteousness without works
[1:45:54] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[1:45:56] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[1:45:59] you see he would not impute sin to sell
[1:46:04] no matter how much I believe she had he
[1:46:07] would not impute sin to her instead he
[1:46:11] imputed Grace to her
[1:46:14] you know
[1:46:16] listen
[1:46:17] you're going to receive the promise the
[1:46:19] son of promise
[1:46:21] Jesus is coming back for you in this
[1:46:23] evil day
[1:46:24] in spite of the fact that you've laughed
[1:46:27] in your heart
[1:46:28] and said it's not possible for the whole
[1:46:30] unbelieving church like me to be one
[1:46:33] that Jesus brings
[1:46:35] that brings Jesus back to the Earth
[1:46:38] you see don't don't say I'm unworthy I'm
[1:46:41] not righteous enough I haven't done
[1:46:44] anything to deserve it but be happy
[1:46:47] that your iniquities are forgiven and
[1:46:51] your sins are covered
[1:46:53] be happy and rejoice because the Lord
[1:46:56] will not impute sin
[1:46:59] to you amen not not that you're not like
[1:47:03] brother Branham bumbling and frustrated
[1:47:05] and questioning and wondering and what
[1:47:07] and God God sets all of that aside
[1:47:11] and uses a man's voice to speak a word
[1:47:14] of creation
[1:47:15] what's now he said of you you are
[1:47:18] without spot or blemish
[1:47:21] or any such thing
[1:47:24] amen you are my sinless bride you're
[1:47:27] perfect in my eyes
[1:47:28] you've got to start viewing yourself as
[1:47:31] God views you
[1:47:33] you know years ago brother biscos told a
[1:47:35] story of a Tin Cow bride is actually
[1:47:38] wasn't his if he heard it from somewhere
[1:47:41] else it's actually all over the Internet
[1:47:43] you can go and research it and whatever
[1:47:47] but that was this young girl that was
[1:47:49] rather homely maybe not the most
[1:47:52] desirable one
[1:47:54] and she she kind of you know felt that
[1:47:57] way about herself and was shy and you
[1:48:00] know backward and and and didn't real
[1:48:03] felt real insignificant and nobody
[1:48:07] and
[1:48:08] and so the story goes on that there was
[1:48:12] a man that saw her and loved her
[1:48:16] and he said
[1:48:18] you know you know they he he usually for
[1:48:23] a bride that Dowry would be maybe one or
[1:48:26] two cows
[1:48:27] depending on her value you know maybe
[1:48:29] someone that was maybe not that pretty
[1:48:32] not that wanted and wasn't didn't feel
[1:48:35] that valuable they didn't feel was maybe
[1:48:38] others didn't think she was that
[1:48:39] valuable that he just gives one one cow
[1:48:44] or two cows he's more she's real pretty
[1:48:46] and you know really nice and ever form

[1:49:18] this girl
[1:49:20] I really want her yeah what do you get
[1:49:23] for her ten cows it was an unheard of
[1:49:27] price

[1:49:32] ever given ten cows for for a bride like
[1:49:35] that and this girl 10 cows he got
[1:49:39] cheated didn't he
[1:49:41] and the story goes on that he gave the
[1:49:44] Dowry and gave the ten cows and the girl

[1:58:46] language you've been talking
[1:58:49] listen
[1:58:50] the Bible tells you the wisdom of the
[1:58:52] wise and that Satan will be brought to
[1:58:55] naught
[1:58:57] what's the symbol
[1:58:59] for naught for nothing
[1:59:01] zero
[1:59:04] he will be brought to zero
[1:59:09] oh everything he said about you is going
[1:59:10] to be brought to you
[1:59:13] all the threats he's had against she's
[1:59:15] going to be brought to nothing all your
[1:59:17] inferiority complex it comes from a
[1:59:19] devil maybe your daddy tried to put it
[1:59:21] on your mother your this or that
[1:59:23] somebody else said this it's gonna be
[1:59:25] nothing
[1:59:28] come on
[1:59:30] you need to tell the devil
[1:59:33] devil you're
[1:59:36] nothing
[1:59:37] and look down when you say it
[1:59:39] because he's under your feet
[1:59:43] Hallelujah he's going to be brought
[1:59:45] tonight
[1:59:50] and all the while God is singing about
[1:59:53] you
[1:59:54] rejoicing over you thinking oh my
[1:59:58] God did you hear what she did the other
[2:00:00] day do you hear what my brothers do did
[2:00:02] you hear the other day when when my
[2:00:04] bride got got faced with the cancer they
[2:00:07] got they cast him out did you hear that
[2:00:09] goodness what I said they would do there
[2:00:12] I mean they even have their sons in my
[2:00:14] image they're just like me they're
[2:00:16] starting to believe and actually believe
[2:00:18] the more I can bless them because I can
[2:00:21] release blessings when they believe
[2:00:23] Hallelujah the quitting is fear because
[2:00:25] fear has no value
[2:00:27] fear is not of God fear hath torment
[2:00:30] fear is of the devil I never put fear on
[2:00:33] you I did not come to bring you fear and
[2:00:36] failure I came to bring you loud and
[2:00:38] courage and ability
[2:00:44] My bride is mighty in faith
[2:00:47] convinced my power
[2:00:50] thou fulfill my promises I'm convinced
[2:00:54] I'm convinced her faith
[2:00:57] will become rapturing faith
[2:01:00] when and I'm convinced of that this
[2:01:02] morning
[2:01:03] are you convinced I'm convinced
[2:01:07] when I lay my hands on the sick they
[2:01:10] shall recover
[2:01:11] not because of the magic of the Mystic
[2:01:14] power of my hands but because he said I
[2:01:16] would do this
[2:01:17] when I command evil spirits to leave to
[2:01:20] leave they will leave not because I'm a
[2:01:23] holy man and have a perfect record but
[2:01:25] because my righteousness of him and he
[2:01:28] said to me and my name you will cast out
[2:01:30] Devils of all kinds shapes varieties
[2:01:34] porn Devils lost Devils fear Devils
[2:01:38] doubting Devils demons of sickness of
[2:01:41] all kinds when I speak they have to go
[2:01:45] this is the faith of those that are
[2:01:47] truly born again
[2:01:48] that that fact it places Faith within
[2:01:53] the The Riches of the simplest child
[2:01:56] when we conclude that the written word
[2:01:58] that anything and everything that God
[2:02:00] said in his Bible is God's revealed
[2:02:02] wheel to us
[2:02:05] amen for everything that he longs to do
[2:02:07] for us then we treasure that word we
[2:02:09] stand on it and expect God to make it
[2:02:12] good without wavering or doubting or
[2:02:13] worrying
[2:02:15] we take her position as a bride of
[2:02:18] Christ
[2:02:19] amen
[2:02:20] now
[2:02:21] so as we go into this for a moment and
[2:02:25] I'm
[2:02:25] trying to bring it down
[2:02:28] you know where that I can finish this
[2:02:31] and I'm only halfway through
[2:02:34] and so it is a bad dilemma
[2:02:40] but I want you to get it
[2:02:42] you see Satan
[2:02:46] will do everything he can
[2:02:49] to cause you to doubt
[2:02:52] Jeremiah 32 17 says oh Lord God behold
[2:02:56] thou mayest heavens and the Earth by thy
[2:02:58] great power and stretched out the arm
[2:03:00] and there is nothing too hard for thee
[2:03:04] surely if he made the heavens and the
[2:03:06] Earth
[2:03:07] then he can handle your puny little
[2:03:11] insignificant problem
[2:03:14] but of course Satan loves us some New
[2:03:16] Year tactics he wants to use smear
[2:03:18] tactics on this church
[2:03:20] and he will smear even the name of
[2:03:22] Pentecost until you don't want to be
[2:03:23] identified with it
[2:03:25] to keep you beat down so that you won't
[2:03:27] use your Faith Hill he'll make a mockery
[2:03:29] of gifts speaking in tongues until it
[2:03:32] becomes considered baby talk
[2:03:34] something only the mature that the
[2:03:37] material would never do
[2:03:39] and this of course removes from you the
[2:03:41] power the intercession of the Holy
[2:03:43] Spirit through our lips
[2:03:45] you see the devil knows that Mark 16 an
[2:03:49] action is the word in action
[2:03:51] amen and he he don't care how much word
[2:03:54] word you have as long as it never goes
[2:03:57] into action
[2:03:58] as long as your sword is just a pretty
[2:04:00] ornaments on your side he he has nothing
[2:04:05] to fear
[2:04:06] and that's why Satan hates altar calls
[2:04:09] and Holy Ghost experience that's why
[2:04:12] Satan despises prayer lines he knows
[2:04:15] when you put the word into action he's
[2:04:18] going to be cast out
[2:04:20] oh but this is a word Revival yet but
[2:04:22] it's not a dead form of or theology
[2:04:25] Revival you can't revive that it's a
[2:04:27] dead and rotten this is a word Revival
[2:04:30] of the faith what's delivered to the
[2:04:32] Saints
[2:04:33] so it's a word in action not the word
[2:04:36] for decoration
[2:04:38] you see and so we have not been called
[2:04:41] to fear but we have we have been called
[2:04:43] to trust the more I trust him the more I
[2:04:46] love him and I show my love to him
[2:04:49] by my trust
[2:04:51] now I want to get something to you
[2:04:55] we should not fear God
[2:04:57] we should reverence God
[2:05:00] we should not be afraid of him
[2:05:03] as a boy
[2:05:06] just honestly
[2:05:08] I was afraid of my daddy
[2:05:11] when he came home from work
[2:05:13] we scattered
[2:05:16] I long for his approval but I've found
[2:05:19] none
[2:05:21] he was a good man he did many great
[2:05:23] things for me
[2:05:24] but I could never measure up
[2:05:27] I could never meet
[2:05:29] his approval
[2:05:31] but you know what I did with that I
[2:05:34] broke the cycle
[2:05:37] I want my children to know they are my
[2:05:39] joy
[2:05:41] that I'm proud of them
[2:05:43] my girls their Daddy's Girls
[2:05:46] you know when I got married I I wondered
[2:05:49] what I my home be like my
[2:05:53] the home that I grew up in I had
[2:05:56] Christian parents
[2:05:58] you know I I I love my mother but I was
[2:06:01] afraid of my dad
[2:06:03] and and you know I never had
[2:06:06] relationship with him and I thought God
[2:06:09] I don't want
[2:06:10] I don't want my wife I want her to have
[2:06:13] a relationship I want her to help me
[2:06:14] loved but I I don't I don't want them to
[2:06:17] love her more I want them to love me as
[2:06:20] much as they do her I I want to be loved
[2:06:23] and I want them to know I love them that
[2:06:27] I care about them that I'm proud of them
[2:06:29] that they're my joy
[2:06:31] you know so my my daughters their
[2:06:35] Daddy's Girls
[2:06:36] I've let them known throughout the years
[2:06:39] you know and and just more than just
[2:06:42] words but in actions and deeds you're my
[2:06:45] pride you're my joy my son is my pride
[2:06:50] you see he's uh he's the apple of my eye
[2:06:53] as my girls are they don't have to guess
[2:06:56] about it
[2:06:58] they don't have to wonder
[2:07:00] I tell them that I show them that I let
[2:07:04] them know they are loved a man who can't
[2:07:07] tell his sons and daughters that they
[2:07:10] are loved is not a father
[2:07:12] he is a sperm Donovan
[2:07:14] he not you know
[2:07:16] you see like I said he's not a father
[2:07:19] let me say it again he's a sperm donor
[2:07:22] he's never been a father a father is
[2:07:25] nurturing a father tells his children I
[2:07:30] love you
[2:07:31] he's not too prideful he's not too shy
[2:07:34] he's not too backwards he's not too bit
[2:07:38] he's not too warped that he can't
[2:07:41] release love
[2:07:44] you see you see he shows them he
[2:07:49] expresses him maybe you had a father
[2:07:51] that that abandons him maybe he had a
[2:07:54] father that didn't care about you that
[2:07:56] never never could say I love you never
[2:07:58] never had you know never praised you
[2:08:01] never spoke well of you maybe you have
[2:08:05] that kind of relationship and whatever
[2:08:07] but you don't have to keep that
[2:08:11] today you can start today and break the
[2:08:14] cycle
[2:08:17] be a real man a real man can love
[2:08:22] it's not a to man a man can love a
[2:08:26] man can care a man can have compassion
[2:08:29] a man can nurture he's a father
[2:08:33] and the reason I know I can do that
[2:08:35] because my heavenly father does that
[2:08:38] and this goes on down to my
[2:08:40] grandchildren my grandson they're my
[2:08:43] sons my granddaughters are my daughters
[2:08:46] and I'll tell you Papa's proud they make
[2:08:50] me proud and I am proud to be their papa
[2:08:56] amen come on now I want you to I want
[2:08:59] you to understand I don't want them
[2:09:01] afraid of me I want them to trust me I
[2:09:05] want them to love me
[2:09:07] and God is the same kind he does not
[2:09:11] want his children afraid of him he wants
[2:09:14] them to know they have his support
[2:09:17] [Applause]
[2:09:19] they have his love that they are the
[2:09:22] apple of his eye that they are his Joy
[2:09:26] that he would leave all of Heaven just
[2:09:29] for you he would come from Glory this
[2:09:32] morning just for you he would come speak
[2:09:35] the word just for you that you are
[2:09:38] imparted in his eyes you cannot be
[2:09:40] forgotten you cannot be forsaken you
[2:09:43] cannot be neglected
[2:09:47] your request cannot be turned down what
[2:09:51] you say to him is valuable he listens
[2:09:54] every time you cry
[2:10:05] I'll be away next Sunday
[2:10:08] I would have probably preached long
[2:10:09] anyway
[2:10:11] but I'm going to take a little bit from
[2:10:13] next Sunday
[2:10:15] whoever preaches here can cut it a
[2:10:17] little short
[2:10:24] I'm going to steal some of their time
[2:10:30] but I would borrow from next Sunday even
[2:10:32] if I was going to be here
[2:10:36] Paul would sum it up
[2:10:38] in Romans 7
[2:10:40] about the struggle
[2:10:43] of our flesh
[2:10:45] you see in the Old Testament
[2:10:48] under the law there was only one birth
[2:10:51] and man was birthed in the Sin
[2:10:53] and there was no new birth that would
[2:10:55] birth you into righteousness
[2:10:57] so righteousness under the law of his
[2:10:59] works
[2:11:01] you could not be born into righteousness
[2:11:05] but in the New Testament that's not so
[2:11:07] we have a new birth
[2:11:09] and now that birth says replaces Us in
[2:11:12] relationship with God we are actually
[2:11:15] his offspring
[2:11:19] I pray that Revelation Dawns on your
[2:11:22] heart I am his offspring
[2:11:26] I'm his DNA
[2:11:27] I mean it's genetics I'm his kind I
[2:11:31] cannot help but come into His image
[2:11:36] Paul summed it up in Romans 7 the
[2:11:38] struggle between our flesh
[2:11:41] this born of our first birth and showed
[2:11:44] us how through Christ that we have broke
[2:11:46] through we broke free of sins bondage
[2:11:50] and now we experience
[2:11:52] that glorious Liberty of freedom from
[2:11:55] the Yoke of sin
[2:11:57] now under the law we
[2:12:00] we differed nothing from a servant we
[2:12:02] were servants but under grace
[2:12:05] we are not treated as servants we are
[2:12:09] treated as Sons
[2:12:12] as Offspring now remember if you're a
[2:12:15] lady remember you're still sons of God
[2:12:17] just like I'm bride of Christ because of
[2:12:19] being in the church so you're we're all
[2:12:22] sons of God male and female sons of God
[2:12:26] just like as I said I'm bride of Christ
[2:12:29] not physically but because I'm in the
[2:12:31] church and the church is the bride
[2:12:33] because God would use one man to
[2:12:37] symbolize his work as the groom he would
[2:12:40] use a multitudes of people to symbolize
[2:12:43] his work as a bride as a people it's
[2:12:46] called a church
[2:12:47] so under the law we were servants but
[2:12:49] under grace we are treated as Sons
[2:12:52] under the law was blessings and cursings
[2:12:57] bless if we obeyed cursed if we didn't
[2:13:03] and we didn't have the power to
[2:13:05] completely obey
[2:13:07] you see this made us wretched men
[2:13:10] but when Jesus came and provided a way
[2:13:14] out of servanthood into the Glorious
[2:13:16] Liberty of Jesus Christ
[2:13:19] it it left it left us to ourselves as
[2:13:24] almost like two people
[2:13:27] that our flesh is aligned with the law
[2:13:29] of sin but now our renewed mind is fixed
[2:13:33] on submitted to God's righteous truth
[2:13:37] so we are the inside has been born again
[2:13:41] yet the outside still needs a change or
[2:13:44] its own New Birth
[2:13:46] so we will be born again into a new body
[2:13:50] that would never smoke never drank never
[2:13:52] had evil thought it's a match to our
[2:13:56] soul
[2:13:57] now
[2:13:59] so the Bible tells us and I'm not even
[2:14:02] going to refer to the scripture because
[2:14:04] I well I'll refer to it it'll be Romans
[2:14:07] 8 but I don't want you putting it on the
[2:14:10] screen I want you just to listen
[2:14:14] because I'm going to paraphrase it
[2:14:16] because he brings it down and he says
[2:14:19] now the case is closed
[2:14:23] there remains no accusing voice of
[2:14:26] accusation against those who are joined
[2:14:29] in life Union with Christ Jesus
[2:14:33] so there's no accusing voice of
[2:14:35] condemnation that comes to God under the
[2:14:38] law there was always condemnation
[2:14:41] you can never measure up try as hard as
[2:14:44] you could you could not keep it
[2:14:45] perfectly
[2:14:47] and there was only one birth under there
[2:14:49] but under the birth of the New Testament
[2:14:51] we are born again and when we're born
[2:14:54] again we are born of a righteous line
[2:14:58] and we are righteous because of of our
[2:15:01] birth
[2:15:02] he has made us righteous the Bible's
[2:15:04] actually said he became our sins
[2:15:08] that we could become his righteousness
[2:15:12] so you look over at your neighbor right
[2:15:14] now and just say I am the righteousness
[2:15:16] of God
[2:15:19] therefore you can pray the effectual
[2:15:21] fervent prayer of the righteous man
[2:15:25] it back
[2:15:27] because you are the righteousness of God
[2:15:29] not because you did everything right
[2:15:33] but because of your New Birth by faith
[2:15:36] he has imputed righteousness
[2:15:39] to you
[2:15:41] that in spite of your weaknesses he is
[2:15:44] making up Sarah for your weaknesses to
[2:15:47] make you strong
[2:15:48] so the law uh the law of the spirit of
[2:15:52] life has liberated us from the law of
[2:15:56] sin and death
[2:15:58] and for God achieved what the law was
[2:16:01] unable to accomplish because the law was
[2:16:03] limited by weakness of human nature yet
[2:16:06] God sent his son in human form to
[2:16:09] identify with human nature and human
[2:16:12] weakness where he was tempted in all
[2:16:14] points like we are
[2:16:16] clothed with Humanity he gave his body
[2:16:18] to be a sin offering so that God could
[2:16:21] once and all condemn the guilt and the
[2:16:24] power of sin so God condemned the guilt
[2:16:28] and the power of sin at Calvary
[2:16:32] and he bore the price for your
[2:16:36] Redemption the punishment that you
[2:16:39] deserve was upon him
[2:16:44] so already
[2:16:46] he cannot punish you
[2:16:48] he took your punishment he cannot send
[2:16:51] you the hell he went to hell for you
[2:16:54] somebody with me so every righteous
[2:16:58] requirement of the law is now fulfilled
[2:17:00] in Christ
[2:17:02] living his life in us and we are free to
[2:17:05] live not according to our flesh but by
[2:17:07] the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost
[2:17:10] and now Christ lives his life in you
[2:17:14] and even though your body may be dead
[2:17:17] because of the effects of sin his
[2:17:19] life-given Spirit imparts Light to you
[2:17:22] because you are accepted by God look at
[2:17:27] your neighbor and said I have been
[2:17:28] accepted by God
[2:17:30] that's what the Holy Ghost did when he
[2:17:33] came it was his word I have accepted you
[2:17:37] and you did not receive the spirit of
[2:17:40] God
[2:17:45] ever being good enough
[2:17:48] and never being able
[2:17:50] but you received the spirit of full
[2:17:52] acceptance
[2:17:54] and folded you into the family of God
[2:17:57] and you will never feel orphaned
[2:18:01] as he rises up within us our Spirits
[2:18:04] join with him with words of tender words
[2:18:07] saying beloved father
[2:18:09] [Music]
[2:18:11] the spirit itself Bears witness with our
[2:18:13] spirit that we are the children of God
[2:18:17] God owns us as his own
[2:18:21] and we're children then we are Heirs of
[2:18:24] God and join us with Christ listen to
[2:18:28] brother Branham and I'm closing real
[2:18:30] close now so I'm convinced that every
[2:18:33] detail of Our Lives is completely
[2:18:35] continually woven together to fit into
[2:18:38] God's perfect plan of bringing good into
[2:18:40] our lives for we're lovers who have been
[2:18:43] called to fulfill his design purpose
[2:18:45] what's now and brother Brandon said how
[2:18:48] much faith can you use the trouble of it
[2:18:50] is I found that with with the
[2:18:53] fundamentalists and independent
[2:18:55] positionally they know where they are or
[2:18:57] who they are or what they are but the
[2:18:59] next is Pentecostals they have faith and
[2:19:02] and
[2:19:03] yet they don't know who they are he said
[2:19:05] it's like a man that's got a lot of
[2:19:07] money in the bank but he can't write a
[2:19:09] check and others God he can write it
[2:19:10] check but they ain't got no money in the
[2:19:12] bank if I could ever get them two
[2:19:13] together right
[2:19:15] in other words if I could get a person
[2:19:17] to realize his position in Christ
[2:19:21] that he's not rejected he's not orphaned
[2:19:24] he's not on his own he God's not out to
[2:19:27] give me
[2:19:28] he's a loving father
[2:19:31] he loves us he knows how to show his
[2:19:33] love somebody help me now then if I
[2:19:36] could get them to precisely know who
[2:19:39] they are
[2:19:40] and then have the faith
[2:19:44] that the Pentecostals have and bring
[2:19:47] them together
[2:19:48] faith in their position somebody with me
[2:19:52] Faith in what God Said I am faith in my
[2:19:55] forgiveness faith in his Mercy faith in
[2:19:59] his healing
[2:20:00] if I could ever get them together he
[2:20:03] said this nation would see a shaking
[2:20:05] like it never before signs and wonders
[2:20:07] would appear everywhere if you could get
[2:20:09] Pentecostal faith and fundamental people
[2:20:12] together so this message it's designed
[2:20:16] is to get take fundamental truths and
[2:20:19] doctrines but then we neglect faith
[2:20:22] because people go one way or the other
[2:20:25] so brother random said Satan will try to
[2:20:27] make it all mechanics and no Dynamics
[2:20:29] are all Dynamics and no mechanics
[2:20:32] if I can get the two together
[2:20:35] somebody knowing their position
[2:20:37] the Pentecostals receive the baptism of
[2:20:39] the Holy Ghost that makes them part
[2:20:41] fellowship with in relationship with God
[2:20:43] that's born again and the son and
[2:20:45] daughter of God tell them out the Bible
[2:20:46] and they believe it the thing of it is
[2:20:48] they forget who they are
[2:20:51] they think well I don't know oh brother
[2:20:53] you that's born again your sons and
[2:20:55] daughters of God co-equal With Jesus
[2:20:58] Christ in his present that's what makes
[2:21:00] the Devils angry is Let the Church of
[2:21:03] God realize who they are oh you great
[2:21:07] Living Church of living God you have
[2:21:10] claimed to have kissed the blessings off
[2:21:12] the realm of the Cross sometimes I
[2:21:14] wonder God would ever take you his
[2:21:17] gospel and Shake you to a place to
[2:21:19] realize who you are and the rights that
[2:21:22] you have been given
[2:21:25] Hallelujah so we are heirs with him
[2:21:29] notice here he says for he knew all
[2:21:33] about us
[2:21:34] before we were born
[2:21:37] and he destined us from the beginning to
[2:21:39] share the likeness of Jesus Christ this
[2:21:41] is what you're going to be
[2:21:43] I don't care where you're at this
[2:21:45] morning this is what you're going to be
[2:21:47] you're going to be like Jesus
[2:21:50] but I have this right you're going to
[2:21:52] you're going to be like him
[2:21:55] amen listen this means that he's the
[2:21:58] oldest amongst the vast family of
[2:22:00] brothers and sisters who come become
[2:22:02] just like him having determined our
[2:22:05] destiny ahead of time he called us to
[2:22:08] himself he transferred his perfect
[2:22:11] righteousness to everyone he called and
[2:22:14] those who possessed his perfect
[2:22:16] righteousness he glorified with his son
[2:22:20] watch now once you catch this
[2:22:25] so he
[2:22:27] co-glorified you he made you co-equal
[2:22:30] with Jesus Christ
[2:22:33] he made you to be sin or he made him to
[2:22:36] be sin for us who knew no sin so that
[2:22:39] you could become his righteousness so
[2:22:41] how can he cast us away
[2:22:43] how can he refuse this audience how can
[2:22:46] he refuse our request he is a good good
[2:22:49] father
[2:22:51] asking you shall receive
[2:22:53] shall be opened every persistent person
[2:22:57] will get what he asked for every
[2:22:58] persistent Seeker would discover what he
[2:23:01] needs everyone who knocks persistently
[2:23:03] will will find the door open
[2:23:06] amen he says look I know I know I'm a
[2:23:10] father let me ask you this this is the
[2:23:13] words of Jesus
[2:23:15] can I get you with me just one few more
[2:23:17] minutes just a few let me ask you this
[2:23:19] do you know of any father this is the
[2:23:22] words of Jesus do you know of any father
[2:23:24] that would give his son a snake a
[2:23:28] serpent on a plate when he asked for
[2:23:29] fish
[2:23:33] of course not
[2:23:35] do you know of any father that would
[2:23:37] give his son a scorpion when he asked
[2:23:39] for an egg
[2:23:41] I'm hungry Daddy
[2:23:43] give him a scorpion
[2:23:47] I'm hungry Daddy
[2:23:49] give him a snake
[2:23:53] he says if imperfect parents
[2:23:56] know how to lovingly take care of their
[2:23:58] children
[2:23:59] and give them what they need how much
[2:24:02] more will the perfect Heavenly Father
[2:24:05] give the holy spirit's fullness when his
[2:24:08] children ask him
[2:24:11] amen
[2:24:13] so he says the Lord will give Grace and
[2:24:16] Glory
[2:24:17] and and no good thing well he withhold
[2:24:19] from them that walk uprightly and the
[2:24:22] only ones who cannot walk uprightly are
[2:24:24] sons of the blood is cleansed now let's
[2:24:27] go back to Roman star so what does all
[2:24:30] this mean
[2:24:31] if God has determined to stand with us
[2:24:35] tell me then who could ever stand
[2:24:38] against us
[2:24:40] if God has proved This Love To Us by
[2:24:42] giving up his greatest treasure the gift
[2:24:45] of his son and freely offered him as a
[2:24:48] sacrifice for us all amen he certainly
[2:24:51] won't withhold anything else that he has
[2:24:53] to give
[2:24:54] if he gave Christ come on
[2:24:57] if he gave himself wouldn't he give you
[2:24:59] healing
[2:25:00] would he give you finances when he
[2:25:04] supplied her needs come on if God proved
[2:25:07] if my given is greater his love won't he
[2:25:09] give you freely all things
[2:25:11] who would dare who would dare accuse
[2:25:15] Those whom God has chosen and loved to
[2:25:17] be his God is himself as a judge who has
[2:25:21] issued the final verdict not guilty
[2:25:26] Hallelujah this is a Justice the judge's
[2:25:30] final version verdict not guilty
[2:25:34] Satan they're not guilty
[2:25:37] if they didn't disrespect they're not
[2:25:40] guilty but I saw not guilty
[2:25:43] [Applause]
[2:25:44] [Music]
[2:25:45] charges against them have been laid on
[2:25:48] me I have paid the debt as they are free
[2:25:51] to go
[2:25:55] then
[2:25:59] if God will not accept the devil's
[2:26:02] accusation then who is left to condemn
[2:26:05] us certainly not Jesus
[2:26:07] amen he gave his life for us and even
[2:26:10] more than that he conquered death and
[2:26:12] has not risen exalted and thrown at
[2:26:15] God's right hand so how could he
[2:26:16] possibly be because different since he
[2:26:19] is continually praying for our victory
[2:26:22] [Applause]
[2:26:24] he is what continually praying for our
[2:26:28] victory
[2:26:29] continually pray you're going to
[2:26:31] overcome
[2:26:32] how can I fail when Jesus is praying for
[2:26:35] me
[2:26:36] is like
[2:26:38] interceding sitting at the right hand of
[2:26:41] God
[2:26:43] praying continually
[2:26:45] they're gonna win they're going to win
[2:26:48] they 'll win they're gonna win
[2:26:54] Hallelujah
[2:26:56] Hallelujah Moses with his hands lifted
[2:27:00] high was the sign it's all well the
[2:27:03] battle's going good we are winning he
[2:27:06] got Wings men come along and propped it
[2:27:09] up but Jesus went to Calvary and had his
[2:27:12] hands nailed to the cross
[2:27:14] amen hallelujah it's a sign to us
[2:27:18] you are winning you're not losing you're
[2:27:23] winning you're gonna overcome this
[2:27:25] you're coming through this you will not
[2:27:28] be defeated
[2:27:35] who then could ever separate us from the
[2:27:39] Endless Love Of Christ
[2:27:41] absolutely no one nothing in the
[2:27:45] universe has the power to diminish his
[2:27:48] love toward us troubles Treasures
[2:27:51] problems are unable to come between us
[2:27:54] and Heaven's love what about
[2:27:55] persecutions and the deprivations and
[2:27:58] dangers and death threats oh no they're
[2:28:01] no longer they they are all important to
[2:28:05] hinder omnipotent love even as though
[2:28:08] it's written for all day long we Face
[2:28:11] threats to yourself for your sake of God
[2:28:14] we're considered to be nothing more than
[2:28:16] sweet sheep to the slaughter yet in the
[2:28:18] midst of all these things we try up over
[2:28:22] them all
[2:28:23] but God has made us to be more than
[2:28:25] conquerors come on let the musicians
[2:28:27] come amen me and made us be more than
[2:28:30] conquerors say it with me more than
[2:28:33] conquerors and is demonstrated aloud is
[2:28:37] our glorious victory over everything
[2:28:39] else so now I live in confidence that
[2:28:42] there is nothing in the universe with
[2:28:45] the power that separate us from God's
[2:28:47] love I'm convinced his love will triumph
[2:28:50] over death more for life's Trouble Over
[2:28:52] evil Fallen Angels over sin over
[2:28:55] sickness over dark rulers in the heavens
[2:28:58] there is nothing present or future
[2:29:00] circumstances that can weaken his love
[2:29:03] and his attitude toward me there is no
[2:29:05] power above us or beneath us no power
[2:29:08] can be found in the universe that can
[2:29:11] distance us from God's passionate love
[2:29:14] which is lavished on us
[2:29:17] by our father
[2:29:19] the Lord Jesus Christ the anointed one
[2:29:24] Hallelujah
[2:29:25] lavished on you
[2:29:27] lavished on you there's no reason to
[2:29:31] fear

[2:29:36] standing complete the virtuous
[2:29:39] sinless

[2:29:51] craftsmanship his masterpiece

[2:29:59] he knew exactly
[2:30:01] the potentials that he would bring out
[2:30:03] of you
[2:30:06] when other looked at it and said that
[2:30:08] Joe he's a worthless boy
[2:30:12] he described his self the other day in
[2:30:14] lawyers I'm not going to use
[2:30:18] but there was a sinner lost
[2:30:22] people say no chance
[2:30:25] no hope
[2:30:29] but God had him in his mind
[2:30:32] before the world began
