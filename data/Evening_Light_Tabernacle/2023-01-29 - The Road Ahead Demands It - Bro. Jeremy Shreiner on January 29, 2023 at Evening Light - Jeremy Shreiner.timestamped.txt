[11:57] amen
[12:02] is that a true song for you hey man well
[12:05] he wasn't kidding when he said be ready
[12:07] I was expecting 30 minutes service and
[12:09] that's we're here now so hey man let's
[12:12] just bow our hearts for a few moments
[12:14] and we'll begin to change the order of
[12:16] the service amen
[12:18] do you believe once again and I'm not
[12:20] just trying to ask this question out of
[12:21] tradition but do you believe once again
[12:23] that God can meet your need tonight
[12:25] now I know that he's met needs this
[12:27] morning felt his presence he touched my
[12:29] heart and I know that he's touched yours
[12:32] but perhaps there's another thing that
[12:33] we can get tonight something else that
[12:35] we can draw from from the well tonight I
[12:38] mean that's why we're here right I don't
[12:40] think that this is just something to
[12:42] pass the time to get to the communion
[12:43] but there's something else that God has
[12:45] for me so I want to just lift my hand
[12:48] personally say Lord I want to be I want
[12:50] to be an antenna I want to receive your
[12:53] word in my heart amen Heavenly fathers
[12:56] would come before you Lord we just know
[12:58] this evening Lord that you have
[13:00] something else for those that are here
[13:03] father I know this is not normal for
[13:05] their their schedule and time and by
[13:08] natural things Lord maybe we're we're
[13:10] some are already in bed or maybe
[13:12] someone's just whatever they're doing so
[13:14] we have now stopped time completely from
[13:17] our normal life and we find ourselves
[13:20] back in this place in their in your
[13:22] presence so Lord I believe that you have
[13:25] something for them Lord I want to step
[13:27] out of the way and ask that you would
[13:29] just deal directly to every heart
[13:31] and God that it would go in and it would
[13:33] be a change father and Lord if there'd
[13:36] be something again I I think it's
[13:37] something that should be said every time
[13:39] someone needs the baptism of the Holy
[13:41] Spirit may they find that Lord a
[13:43] refreshing Lord whatever it may be let
[13:45] us be open for that tonight we ask that
[13:48] you would just move in a special way
[13:50] once again we get we just give you
[13:52] praise honor and glory for it in Jesus

[18:45] what's your vision of what God can do
[18:47] for you
[18:48] the devil can't stop that if you're
[18:50] carnal tonight and say well I've got
[18:52] this problem I've got that problem and
[18:53] you're thinking well it's but let me
[18:55] just tell you that's called life the
[18:56] devil cannot stop what God's already
[18:58] doing amen I'll never forget the day uh
[19:01] I had brother Ron Spencer here a few
[19:03] years back at our church and the first
[19:05] night of service that we were having in
[19:06] our anniversary meetings and it was my
[19:09] first time I believe it was to actually
[19:10] invite a minister so it's kind of the
[19:12] burdens on me and you know I I guess I'm
[19:15] just different I was a pastor that was
[19:17] scared to death I was just like his
[19:18] brother Ron Spencer and what's going on
[19:21] you know this power of God is going to
[19:23] move and then all of a sudden we had
[19:24] this big blow up in the church something
[19:26] happened and somebody got mad and
[19:28] somebody walked on I know y'all never
[19:30] have that so just you know nobody ever
[19:32] gets angry and I'm just sitting there
[19:34] and I just it's all over my face and
[19:36] we're sitting in the office there and
[19:37] brother Ron's sitting there and he just
[19:38] looks at me and says don't you worry
[19:40] buddy
[19:41] he said the devil didn't start this
[19:44] train and this train ain't stopping
[19:48] [Applause]
[19:53] amen well
[19:56] I know you've been standing so there's a
[19:58] reason for you standing but you'll be
[19:59] sitting shortly turn your bibles if you
[20:01] wouldn't mind with me to the Book of
[20:02] Joshua chapter 24. this is the thought
[20:05] that the Lord laid upon my heart uh
[20:07] actually a couple years ago and then
[20:10] just recently again just brought it back
[20:12] to my attention and I haven't been able
[20:14] to get away from it this week so we
[20:17] trust that it would be something for a
[20:19] few moments
[20:20] I've been given 20 minutes so I need
[20:23] brother Derek to time me brother Derek
[20:25] Paris I've been told you your 20 minutes
[20:27] is what I need so
[20:30] but I trust that tonight uh what we what
[20:33] we feel in our hearts will
[20:35] get to the need of the situation now
[20:39] this is very common Joshua 24 14. so we
[20:42] read this together it says now therefore
[20:44] fear the lord and serve him in sincerity
[20:47] and in truth
[20:48] and put away the gods which your fathers
[20:51] served on the other side of the flood
[20:53] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[20:58] and if it seemed evil unto you to serve
[21:00] the Lord choose you this day whom you
[21:01] will serve
[21:03] whether the gods which your father
[21:04] served that were on the other side of
[21:06] the flood or the gods of the amorites
[21:08] and whose land you dwell
[21:10] but listen this is more than just a
[21:13] picture on a wall
[21:15] but as for me and my house
[21:17] we will serve the Lord
[21:20] now I'm just going to quickly read
[21:21] Psalms 121 1-2
[21:24] it says I will lift mine eyes unto the
[21:26] hills
[21:28] from wince cometh my help
[21:30] My Help Cometh From The Lord which made
[21:34] Heaven and Earth I mean God bless you
[21:37] can be seated
[21:40] as we as we dive into this quickly and
[21:43] we and we understand the time we want to
[21:45] be honorable of that the road demands
[21:48] that you're on this this evening the
[21:50] road that you are on demands a decision
[21:53] it demands a decision now what you heard
[21:57] this morning from brother Tim that
[21:58] wasn't brother Tim bringing forth oh
[22:01] something to you that he's demanding a
[22:03] decision from you if brother Aaron or
[22:05] brother Joe or brother Timothy was
[22:07] ministering uh brother Branham could be
[22:09] ministering and they are not making you
[22:11] or demanding a decision from you but God
[22:14] every single time we listen to a tape
[22:17] every single time we come to the house
[22:18] of God and we hear the words uh
[22:21] ministered from this Pulpit or wherever
[22:22] you go you are brought forth to a
[22:25] question a chance or a Crossroads now we
[22:28] understand many times of life that we
[22:30] all come to specific Crossroads and a
[22:33] lot of times we look at Crossroads
[22:34] decisions of whether it's going to be my
[22:36] career decision or marriage decision or
[22:38] whatever it may be and a lot of times we
[22:40] tend to focus too much on those types of
[22:43] things instead of the the most important
[22:46] Eternal decision but I want us to
[22:48] understand tonight as our as our thought
[22:50] is entitled the road ahead demands it
[22:54] the road ahead demands a decision we
[22:59] must have a personal experience that
[23:03] solidifies our purpose now I I I'm just
[23:06] going to be honest with you tonight okay
[23:10] you ever just been stopped in the middle
[23:11] of your job
[23:13] that's perfect see it's got to be right
[23:18] thank you brother the road ahead demands
[23:20] and I love it so I was sitting there
[23:22] this morning and a lot of the things
[23:23] that God had been dealing with me
[23:25] brother Tim was was just line for line
[23:27] speaking I was like God how in the world
[23:30] what are you trying to do and if I could
[23:32] speak to my church this one tonight and
[23:34] tell them that it's not just us speaking
[23:38] to you that you have a decision but
[23:39] every Church you go to Every individual
[23:42] every young person we have to make a
[23:45] decision Matthew 16 13-16 you you know
[23:48] the scripture here but let's just read
[23:50] it together when Jesus came into the
[23:52] coast of assessori Philippi he asked his
[23:54] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[23:57] the son of man am
[23:59] and they said some say that thou art
[24:01] John the Baptist some Elias and others
[24:04] jeremius or one of the prophets
[24:06] and he said unto them but whom say ye
[24:09] that I am
[24:10] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[24:12] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[24:15] now let's just stop for a minute and
[24:16] understand that the first question that
[24:18] Jesus asked had no value
[24:21] it's a pretty non-life-threatening
[24:24] question
[24:25] it invoked No Authority
[24:27] no authority over your life nothing
[24:31] whom do men say that I am
[24:35] when Jesus asked the question so if I
[24:37] want to go to ask brother Joe brother
[24:38] Joe what what does Timothy say about
[24:41] servant lord well brother Joel this is
[24:44] it you all know how his answer would be
[24:46] right you can just see brother Joe
[24:47] answer if I went to Brother Aaron I said
[24:49] well what does brother Tim believe he
[24:51] could tell me brother Tim believes this
[24:52] and this it has no pressure it is no
[24:55] there's no heart in it there's no
[24:57] Authority in it it's do you uh you know
[25:00] what does your church believe well my
[25:02] church believes this well my pastor
[25:03] believes this Whoa We Believe God sent a
[25:05] prophet and we put everything off on
[25:07] what the prophet said or he put
[25:08] everything on off what brother Tim says
[25:10] and we put everything on off but Jesus
[25:12] didn't stop with that type of question
[25:14] he says there if if this question is how
[25:17] it ended there was no need to respond
[25:19] with a you're with your heart there's no
[25:22] need to respond with your actions to
[25:24] commit yourself I wonder if that's what
[25:26] religion has become
[25:28] because we're all looking up everyone
[25:29] else and not ourself if Jesus would have
[25:33] stopped there maybe that wouldn't have
[25:34] been important of scripture but I want
[25:37] you to know that the road ahead Demands
[25:39] a decision
[25:40] what you're about to go through Peter
[25:42] what you're about to face you need to
[25:44] know who I am
[25:45] you see so it's so as long as the
[25:48] question of the identity of Jesus is
[25:51] discussed at the level of intellect
[25:55] or at the level of academics
[25:58] there is no claim on your heart
[26:01] you see that's why I don't like to get
[26:03] into baits on Facebook
[26:05] I don't want to get I don't even want to
[26:06] get in a debate at McDonald's
[26:09] because it becomes an intellectual
[26:11] debate of my opinion of the word or how
[26:14] I think it should be but I wanted to
[26:16] come from my heart I want it to be a
[26:18] heartfelt thing you see there was no
[26:20] claim on the heart in the first question
[26:22] there was no claim on the life because
[26:24] men say that you're this way well
[26:26] brother Tim believes this well brother
[26:27] Ron believes this well brother Jeremy
[26:29] believes this but what do you believe
[26:31] tonight because what you're going to go
[26:33] through if you don't make a decision in
[26:36] your life you are not going to make it
[26:39] the road ahead demands a heartfelt
[26:42] decision
[26:43] the one who formed us together in our
[26:46] mother's wombs will not be satisfied
[26:48] with a place in the conversation of
[26:51] critics
[26:54] he wants to be more than a debate
[26:57] he wants to be more than him come on do
[26:59] you message theology he wants to be more
[27:01] than this is my interpretation of the
[27:04] word he doesn't want to be just a part
[27:06] of academics but he wants to be a part
[27:09] of your heart
[27:10] he's not going to be satisfied he will
[27:12] always lay claim in your heart so if I
[27:15] ask you the question what does this
[27:17] person believe it makes no personal
[27:19] pressure on you
[27:22] that's why Jesus didn't end there
[27:24] said but who do you say that I am
[27:27] and now the question is thrown to you
[27:30] who do you say that I am well you're a
[27:32] God of Miracles and we begin to think of
[27:34] everybody else's Miracles oh you're a
[27:36] God that can open the blinded eyes but
[27:38] we we look at everybody else but what is
[27:41] God to you tonight because you've got to
[27:43] know who he is because what you're about
[27:46] to go through you need to have a
[27:48] personal experience Moses you cannot
[27:50] make you cannot go to Egypt with what
[27:53] you had before you've got to have a
[27:55] backside of the desert experience you
[27:58] need to have a come to Jesus moments
[28:02] because what you're about to go through
[28:04] oh brother Jeremy I've already been
[28:05] through it I've already had these trials
[28:07] I've already had these tests
[28:08] everything's already fallen apart the
[28:10] car ain't going to start I've had this
[28:11] cancer I've had this disease I've had
[28:13] that disease but what you're about to go
[28:15] through you need to know who Jesus is
[28:18] I'm afraid if we're not careful it's
[28:20] becoming more it's becoming more of a
[28:22] religious thing
[28:23] and Jesus said I don't want to know what
[28:25] you say everyone else says I don't want
[28:27] you to tell me what your church believes
[28:28] I want to know what you believe
[28:31] see but if I ask you what you believe
[28:34] now it's on your heart now the
[28:36] pressure's on you see John 13 34 says a
[28:39] new commandment I give unto you that you
[28:41] love one another as I have loved you
[28:43] that you also love one another by this
[28:46] shall part man no
[28:49] amen are y'all with me
[28:52] all men know that ye are my disciples if
[28:55] you loved one with one another this is
[28:57] intriguing because it says all men this
[28:59] is not an undercover relationship this
[29:02] is not well you know I can't go to
[29:04] Walmart today because someone might look
[29:05] at me and they might they might not like
[29:07] the way I dress uh you know my Facebook
[29:09] is has nothing to do with with Christ or
[29:12] uh you know it's all good when
[29:13] everybody's here together and we all
[29:15] look the same and act the same but when
[29:17] you get separated and you're on your own
[29:20] who do you say that Jesus is you see
[29:23] it's not up to just the ministry to
[29:25] encourage somebody to keep pressing on
[29:27] because you never know when you're at
[29:28] Walmart and somebody's in need of a
[29:31] touch of God will you be one that is
[29:33] recognizing that Jesus has called to use
[29:36] you the road ahead demands a decision
[29:39] tonight
[29:42] communion is more than just an ordinance
[29:46] it Demands a decision
[29:48] baptism is more than an ordinance but it
[29:51] Demands a decision a life changing
[29:53] decision something that is more than
[29:56] just a uh the just water on skin or
[30:00] something more than drinking of the wine
[30:02] something more than eating of the bread
[30:04] but it's a life-changing decision
[30:09] this is a central question one that
[30:10] Jesus posed many times and in many ways
[30:14] many times in many ways how many times
[30:17] did people come you even look at the
[30:19] Rich Young Ruler I believe good Master
[30:21] what must I do
[30:22] to be saved Minister this here recently
[30:26] A lot of times our our relationship with
[30:29] Christ has to do with we tied into the
[30:32] natural way of life because we in our
[30:35] Humanity we are doers
[30:38] we have needs
[30:39] we go to jobs to meet the needs
[30:44] right we we uh we go to birthdays we go
[30:48] to uh get-togethers we have Fellowship
[30:50] we support our family we are doers we go
[30:54] to the church we say uh what can I do to
[30:56] help it becomes something that we do we
[30:58] fulfill a need but Jesus was wanting to
[31:01] look for more than just doers now follow
[31:04] me I know the Bible speaks of doers but
[31:06] he's looking for somebody more than is
[31:08] just doing it because there's a natural
[31:09] need let's see if your marriage is based
[31:12] upon not to be burned
[31:15] your marriage is not right
[31:18] come on you know the scripture and if
[31:20] you you know rather than burn might as
[31:22] well get married
[31:24] come on if you hello folks you all know
[31:27] the scripture I have just given you a
[31:30] Bible study tonight
[31:32] find it but let's just be honest if
[31:34] that's all our relationship is that's
[31:37] not relationship that's a based on need
[31:39] and it doesn't work and if that's the
[31:42] way church has become well I'm going to
[31:44] be a church because I don't want to burn
[31:45] that's not relationship Jesus is looking
[31:48] not for just doers but people that have
[31:51] a heart and a hunger and a desire and a
[31:54] thirst God I want more than just to take
[31:56] communion tonight but this is the bread
[31:59] this is the wine this is my desire
[32:03] the road ahead demands at church
[32:05] you've got to look at it's more than
[32:07] just religion
[32:08] you see Saul answering the question
[32:10] became Paul the self-proclaimed slave of
[32:13] Christ Stephen answering the question of
[32:16] who Jesus was by being filled with the
[32:18] Holy Spirit and preached the most
[32:20] passionate sermon in history before
[32:22] being stoned to death while pleading the
[32:25] Forgiveness of his murders you tell me
[32:28] somebody that knew the road ahead and it
[32:31] did not just come by a theological
[32:33] sermon or an academic sermon or a mental
[32:36] sermon but it came by a sermon that was
[32:39] preached with heart and desire that it
[32:41] doesn't matter what anyone says to me it
[32:43] doesn't matter what anyone says against
[32:45] me I will pray for them while he was
[32:48] being stoned he was praying for them
[32:53] the road requires a decision young
[32:55] people the road requires decision
[32:57] parents
[32:59] the decision is eternal and one that
[33:02] will make
[33:03] and some have made already
[33:06] I know that some don't believe in final
[33:08] calls
[33:09] but I do
[33:12] so just bear with me for a minute I'm
[33:13] sorry brother Tim but that's I believe
[33:15] in it you say why do you believe in that
[33:16] because I've been a part of them
[33:19] you say why'd you say you're sorry
[33:20] brother Tim because I don't know I just
[33:22] felt like saying that brother Tim have
[33:24] you ever seen it before God calling
[33:26] people for one last time
[33:29] you see we in our Humanity we don't like
[33:31] finality
[33:33] finality is hard to understand we always
[33:35] feel like there's a chance
[33:37] we feel this time there's a chance I got
[33:39] no no no problem with that understanding
[33:42] because we don't want to give up right
[33:44] but we have a hard time with finality
[33:46] but I want you to understand that there
[33:47] is a line
[33:50] I don't want to come close to that line
[33:53] but I've seen him growing up in the
[33:54] church I I've been a part of a church of
[33:57] my grandfather as we were raised up we
[33:59] were raised up on the baptism of the
[34:02] Holy Ghost we were raised upon the gifts
[34:04] being active in the church but being
[34:06] filled with the Holy Spirit letting the
[34:08] word be opened in your life and you have
[34:10] to make a decision because just saying
[34:12] God sent a prophet was not enough for
[34:14] you you had to believe that God sent a
[34:16] prophet absolutely but you needed to do
[34:18] what the prophet said he said be born
[34:20] again what did he do he was pointing us
[34:22] back to the word of God so there were
[34:24] many times that I would see God as a
[34:26] young person as a child dealing with
[34:28] people in the church and dealing I grew
[34:31] up with with with friends of mine that
[34:33] we stayed the night together we were
[34:34] friends we we uh we we were always there
[34:37] with one another and they heard the same
[34:39] sermon that I heard they were under the
[34:41] same anointing preaching that I heard
[34:43] they heard the same tongues they were
[34:45] part of the same shouting they were part
[34:47] of the same revealed word of God and
[34:49] some are so far away from God today have
[34:52] cursed God
[34:53] say so what does that do to you that
[34:55] makes me humble
[34:57] how in the world
[35:01] could I be in the position I'm in today
[35:03] you see I fought pornography
[35:06] I fought suicide I fought all of these
[35:09] things but until I got the baptism of
[35:12] the Holy Ghost I kept fighting them
[35:15] until you get the baptism of the Holy
[35:17] Ghost you're always going to keep
[35:18] fighting and you're always going to keep
[35:20] trying and the more you try the more
[35:22] tired you're going to get and the more
[35:23] you try the more the more sleep you're
[35:25] going to lose at night you want to know
[35:27] a real peace the real peace is complete
[35:30] surrender to God to be honest with one
[35:32] another that we're all in this battle
[35:34] together and that we're not here to do
[35:36] it alone and God wants you to surrender
[35:38] to completely to him because the road
[35:40] you are on
[35:42] demands it
[35:45] well brother Jeremy it can't get any
[35:47] worse don't say it
[35:51] I got to get back to this
[35:53] this is not a question asked by your
[35:55] typical everyday rabbi
[35:58] even the question itself makes a
[36:00] statement there is something much more
[36:02] important about me than what they say
[36:06] yeah oh my there is something much more
[36:09] important wrapped up in my identity than
[36:12] most people realize
[36:13] you see it's more than just coming to
[36:15] church and looking apart and acting
[36:17] apart I want more than this to shout I
[36:19] want the god of the shout I want more
[36:22] than just a uh just to run around a
[36:24] church I want the god of that
[36:27] okay I got to testify
[36:29] so I'm sitting over there
[36:31] you know and I know my church is going
[36:32] on and I've been talking with brother
[36:33] J.R who ministered for me this morning
[36:35] speaking of our burdens this morning he
[36:37] was in tears and just God just been
[36:40] dealing and
[36:41] so I've been been on my heart today
[36:44] so I'm sitting over there and also I
[36:45] started getting some text from from
[36:47] people in the church and
[36:49] God began to move and he exploded in the
[36:52] church
[36:53] and and I got a text from my mom she
[36:55] said your son your oldest son he shouted
[36:58] and ran around the church and was
[37:00] praising God now some of you might be oh
[37:02] what's the big deal
[37:03] but let me just tell you something about
[37:05] my son my oldest he's like me we don't
[37:07] want to be in front of people we don't
[37:09] want to do anything in front of people
[37:10] and it's got to be God
[37:14] for it to happen
[37:16] I'm going to go back a little bit
[37:17] further I'm going to talk about just I
[37:20] want to talk about this
[37:21] here last year
[37:23] as a pastor God has used me at times and
[37:26] it's it's it's maybe to some it's easy
[37:29] but to me it's not that when I know God
[37:31] is calling somebody
[37:34] and I know that it's a serious call
[37:37] it could be a decision that they that
[37:39] they're fixing to have to make it could
[37:40] be it could be their final call
[37:42] sometimes I don't know but I know that
[37:44] it's a very serious need and most of the
[37:46] time that I've seen it happen most of
[37:48] the time if they did not make the right
[37:49] decision they were out of church within
[37:51] a certain amount of time
[37:53] and that's not so much just calling
[37:55] their name it's just God calling I've
[37:58] got nothing wrong with that that's
[37:59] happened in our church before
[38:01] so one of the services I was that I was
[38:03] in and the power of God was moving
[38:05] through the place and many people were
[38:08] were surrendering to God but there was
[38:10] this there was this catch
[38:13] somebody wasn't breaking through
[38:16] and and at first you know as ministers
[38:18] we we we wait on the Lord Lord how far
[38:20] do you want me to go because we can't
[38:22] push it into action
[38:24] we heard that this morning we can't do
[38:27] it
[38:28] so we have to wait on the Lord Lord what
[38:30] do you want us to do
[38:31] and I was praying and we were singing
[38:33] and I just I had everyone bow their
[38:36] heads and and I just said you know who
[38:39] you are
[38:40] God is calling you to be honest he's
[38:44] calling you to lift your hand and to say
[38:46] that I know I need the baptism of the
[38:48] Holy Ghost I know I need a change and no
[38:50] hands went up
[38:52] brother Aaron you've probably been in a
[38:53] situation before my heart was just
[38:55] tearing inside because they're my people
[38:58] they're my sheep and I want them to be
[39:00] free
[39:02] and so I said God and my heart said God
[39:04] would you reveal it to me
[39:06] and when God revealed it to me
[39:09] he said it's your son
[39:13] all right what am I going to do now
[39:15] because now in my heart I know that my
[39:18] oldest boy has to make a decision and
[39:21] that me as a daddy
[39:23] has to keep going
[39:25] I can't stop now and I know that if my
[39:27] son doesn't make the decision that this
[39:29] could be the greatest decision of his
[39:30] life that if he doesn't surrender to God
[39:32] this could be the moment where he walks
[39:34] out
[39:36] and I began to beg God brother Tim and
[39:38] my heart I said God give him one more
[39:39] chance
[39:40] I had everyone bow their heads I said
[39:42] Lord I give them one more chance but I
[39:43] know I've got to do this because this is
[39:45] my calling Daddy has to step aside now
[39:49] I said now you know who you are
[39:52] and nobody opened your eyes
[39:54] but the one person that God is calling
[39:57] and I'm looking right at my son the one
[39:59] person that God is calling I want you to
[40:01] open your eyes and look right at me and
[40:03] he opened his eyes and looked right at
[40:05] him as soon as he seen me in his eyes he
[40:07] melted
[40:09] immediately and I said now
[40:12] you have gone this far now you can't
[40:15] this is not an undercover decision
[40:17] I said now everybody lift your hands and
[40:19] or lift your eyes and I said now you
[40:22] know who you are you have to make a
[40:24] conscious decision I want God more than
[40:25] what anyone else in this church thinks
[40:27] and at that moment my son lifted up his
[40:29] hands and he just began to cry out to
[40:31] God
[40:32] oh I'm gonna tell you this as a pastor
[40:35] yes that's great but as a daddy that
[40:36] meant everything to me and I'll never
[40:38] forget it brother Tim I go over there to
[40:40] lay my hands on my son to pray for him
[40:42] and as I went to lay my hands on him the
[40:44] spirit moved for me to brother J.R and
[40:47] brother J.R took over the prayer and God
[40:49] allowed me to take it in as a father I
[40:52] took it in as a father and I prayed for
[40:54] him as a daddy and then as soon as he
[40:56] was done God moved the spirit back upon
[40:58] me and others begin to give their life
[41:00] to God I want to tell you that that
[41:01] moment was a decision for him because
[41:04] what he was about to go through he
[41:06] needed to know who Jesus was more than
[41:08] what daddy said more than what mama said
[41:10] more than what the prophet said he
[41:13] needed to know who he was for himself
[41:16] Hallelujah
[41:21] and I grew up hearing my grandpa say
[41:23] this and uh maybe brother Branham said
[41:25] it but I always heard my grandpa say
[41:26] that I believe it was this statement is
[41:28] that there's no God has no grandchildren
[41:31] you say what do you mean by that that
[41:33] means my grandpa didn't give me any
[41:34] special favors
[41:35] he pulled me from the drums when I did
[41:37] things that I shouldn't do
[41:39] he told me you got to get right I can't
[41:40] have that Spirit on my platform
[41:43] you need to be sold out to God you need
[41:45] to live right you see I didn't do this
[41:48] because I wanted to do it we don't do
[41:49] this because we want to do it if you do
[41:51] it because you want to do it you're
[41:52] going to fall away there's got to be a
[41:54] pull inside of you there's got to be a
[41:57] deed calling to the Deep to know that
[41:59] there's a deep out there to respond I
[42:01] want to know more than just a dead
[42:03] letter I want it to be alive in me
[42:05] because what I'm about to go through I
[42:07] need to know who Jesus is
[42:09] I need to know him personally
[42:12] I need to know him more personally than
[42:14] I do my own wife
[42:16] I need to know him more personally than
[42:18] I do my own husband as you would say I
[42:21] need to know him more personally that
[42:22] because you never know when your spouse
[42:24] will be taken from you you'll never know
[42:26] when your spouse will walk away but do
[42:28] you know who Jesus is
[42:32] Hallelujah
[42:33] who do you say he is tonight
[42:35] do you know him as the way Jesus said
[42:37] I'm the way the truth of life and no man
[42:39] cometh unto the father but by me it
[42:42] cannot be well this is what the pastor
[42:44] believes what if what's going to happen
[42:46] when the pastor dies
[42:48] what are you going to say then well it's
[42:50] what the prophet said well he died what
[42:52] are you going to do now
[42:54] I know I know the spirit to move on but
[42:56] I'm trying to tell you I'm trying to
[42:57] bring this out all right
[42:58] speaking of ananias
[43:01] of Paul or speaking to ananias of Paul
[43:03] in Acts 9 15. it says but the Lord said
[43:06] unto him go that way for he is a chosen
[43:08] vessel unto me
[43:10] to Bear my name before the Gentiles and
[43:12] Kings and the children of Israel
[43:15] for I will show him how great things he
[43:19] is going to do for the kingdom
[43:21] no what does it say here
[43:23] I will show him how great things he must
[43:27] suffer
[43:30] also
[43:31] so you're in the message
[43:35] so are do you really want to be a part
[43:37] of this scripture
[43:40] because Paul what you're about to go
[43:42] through the decisions you're going to
[43:44] have to make you're going to have to
[43:45] have an experience Paul
[43:48] Moses you're going to have to have an
[43:49] experience before you go to Egypt for
[43:51] what you're about to face Peter you're
[43:53] going to have to just have come to more
[43:55] of a position than just saying I know
[43:57] who you are you're going to have to get
[43:59] me inside of you
[44:01] you're gonna have to have an upper room
[44:03] oh I just wish they would stop preaching
[44:05] on the Holy Ghost oh I just been every
[44:08] day that every time they preach us on
[44:09] the Holy Ghost and I'm just getting
[44:10] weary of it we'll get it
[44:13] get the Holy Ghost I'm going to tell you
[44:15] what it's the greatest thing that'll
[44:17] ever happen to you because you're gonna
[44:19] finally stop fighting
[44:21] [Applause]
[44:24] you might not understand that statement
[44:25] yet but when you get the Holy Ghost
[44:27] it'll be a revelation to you
[44:30] because the road ahead Demands a
[44:33] decision the life the trials ahead
[44:35] demand a decision the sicknesses that
[44:37] you're going to go through and there's
[44:39] testimonies here tonight that are
[44:40] sitting before me who have went through
[44:42] some strong battles
[44:44] you've seen death you've seen hearted a
[44:47] heartache you've seen disease you've
[44:49] seen horrible things you've had people
[44:51] curse your name you've had you've seen
[44:54] people curse this message but you're
[44:56] still here why are you still here it's
[44:59] not because of one sermon that was
[45:01] preached it's not because of how good
[45:02] you did it's because you let go and let
[45:05] God
[45:09] brother Branham says he says I say 500
[45:12] years from tonight he said this little
[45:14] group that's sitting here will be
[45:15] somewhere
[45:19] that's right and wherever wherever we
[45:22] are then will will be where we'll have
[45:25] to spend
[45:27] eternity
[45:28] and tonight it may be a decision time
[45:32] and the last time that some of us will
[45:34] have to make our decision
[45:40] but brother Jeremy there's always a
[45:41] chance
[45:42] I don't want to take away hope tonight
[45:45] can you allow me to just preach for a
[45:47] minute
[45:48] I believe that as long as there's breath
[45:50] in anyone's body
[45:52] There's Hope right
[45:55] we've seen prodigals come in my the
[45:58] testimonies are great and wonderful
[46:00] but we've got to get we've got to I
[46:02] believe that Satan to some has put this
[46:05] this a blanket over people or there's
[46:09] always a chance
[46:10] I can go out and do these things and
[46:12] come back
[46:13] but I want you to understand that that's
[46:15] not always the case
[46:18] the Bible is not filled with thousands
[46:21] and thousands of prodigals
[46:24] it's not filled with thousands and
[46:27] thousands of people coming back it's
[46:29] filled with people that came to church
[46:33] and said what must I do to be saved came
[46:35] to an altar pray for me I want to be
[46:38] right
[46:38] but walked out sorrowful because it was
[46:41] too much of a task
[46:43] to let go
[46:47] and we're coming to the end of all time
[46:49] do you not know the season that we're in
[46:52] I know you do because you're well taught
[46:54] here
[46:55] the end of the Gentile dispensation we
[46:58] are at the time of the open book we're
[47:00] at the time of the the revealed word of
[47:02] God it's it's it's beyond restoration if
[47:05] you would allow me to say that it's been
[47:07] restored and now revealed
[47:10] and what does the bible tell us we come
[47:12] to a point that anyone that is filthy
[47:14] let him be filthy still
[47:17] somewhere along the way somewhere the
[47:20] door shuts
[47:24] can I ask you a question did Noah close
[47:26] the door
[47:28] who closed the door
[47:30] well brother Tim he's just preaching too
[47:33] hard brother Aaron he's just too hard I
[47:34] could go down the line of all you
[47:35] wonderful ministers but I must for sake
[47:37] of time oh they're just too hard
[47:40] this teared up
[47:43] they're not the one that shuts the door
[47:46] but some of you don't understand the
[47:48] squeeze
[47:49] that's in the heart of a Preacher
[47:53] the feeling the burden that God gives a
[47:55] Ministry that that I'm thankful that it
[47:59] doesn't always that's not always there
[48:02] because you want to do everything you
[48:04] can to get the attention of the people
[48:07] to let them know that you do not know
[48:11] well I can live the rest of my life
[48:13] listen I'm not talking about natural
[48:15] deaths I'm talking about spiritual too
[48:21] the road that you're about to go through
[48:23] Demands a decision you're going to go
[48:25] home you're going to go back to your
[48:27] jobs
[48:28] what decision did you make today
[48:32] well I made the right decision we'll see
[48:34] what happens
[48:35] it's got to be more than flesh
[48:38] each age had its Choice can you say man
[48:42] well if I if I read the Bible correctly
[48:44] we're we're past all those first six
[48:47] right right so that means that their
[48:49] decision is already done made the sevens
[48:52] right how long how much longer do we
[48:54] have
[48:55] how much longer do you have to make a
[48:57] decision each age had a decision and
[49:00] there's consequences that go with each
[49:02] decision
[49:03] and you have to make a decision in your
[49:05] life and what is that decision it's not
[49:08] about decision you know what
[49:09] consequences are
[49:10] you buy the wrong thing what's the
[49:12] consequence it didn't work
[49:14] so what do you do take it back get your
[49:16] money back that's not how church works
[49:22] something doesn't come out the way we
[49:23] want it we take it back give it to
[49:26] Goodwill whatever it may be
[49:28] no big deal no sweat off our back
[49:30] but what about the Eternal decision that
[49:32] you made on a Wednesday night of when we
[49:34] didn't think it really mattered because
[49:36] it was only a Wednesday night it was the
[49:37] same minister
[49:38] it's a Sunday morning it was the same
[49:40] Minister we've heard the same word he's
[49:42] going to preach about the coming of the
[49:43] Lord he's going to preach about the
[49:44] bride he's going to preach about the
[49:45] Holy Ghost what's the big deal
[49:47] those words that are coming out of his
[49:48] mouth are the words of life that's God
[49:52] demanding a decision from you
[49:54] well I know brother Tim or you know I
[49:57] could say probably all of your family
[49:58] but I don't know he's my family he's my
[50:01] friend doesn't matter
[50:03] brother Tim when it comes or any
[50:05] Minister it's not about how we feel
[50:08] about you it's about God and when the
[50:11] word is being brought forth It's not
[50:13] brother Tim demanding you a decision
[50:15] it's the word that's demanding a
[50:18] decision oh but we don't need that
[50:20] anymore because we have so much message
[50:23] under our belt
[50:25] we have so much knowledge that nobody
[50:27] can now preach my thoughts
[50:31] nobody can now preach my dedication
[50:34] I am more dedicated I am more I have
[50:38] more knowledge nobody can outdo it even
[50:40] you brother Tim can I
[50:43] know you're gonna have to really study
[50:44] hard
[50:46] to outwit me
[50:49] you know there's a group of people that
[50:51] left under sacrificial blood
[50:57] and they're all dead
[51:02] well we're Israel Glory Hallelujah we've
[51:05] seen the the waters part
[51:09] we've seen all of these wonderful
[51:10] Miracles we're out of Egypt and they are
[51:13] all dead
[51:16] only two made it across
[51:19] see I think that as
[51:22] I'm not trying to discourage you tonight
[51:24] but we're leading up to this portion of
[51:27] communion I think that it should be
[51:28] serious
[51:30] as it demands a decision tonight
[51:34] the road demands an elect to catch a
[51:37] difference
[51:39] this hour demands a body an elect few to
[51:43] not just look at the book oh that's a
[51:45] good book
[51:46] but we have to take the book
[51:48] and then it's we have to eat the book
[51:51] and it when you eat this word just allow
[51:54] me to go this Direction please when you
[51:55] eat this word it's going to do something
[51:56] to you it's going to affect your life
[52:00] if you come up here and you say you
[52:02] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:04] and there's no change in your life you
[52:06] didn't eat the book
[52:08] there's too many anointing Junkies
[52:13] but I'm not here to just be have an
[52:15] anointing
[52:16] I want to eat the book and it's going to
[52:19] change me it's going to cut away things
[52:21] in my life it's going to be circumcision
[52:23] oh brother Tim preach circumcision oh
[52:27] brother Tim Timothy preached
[52:28] circumcision preach the word of God why
[52:31] because my soul depends on it
[52:34] it depends on it what is the evidence of
[52:37] the Holy Ghost it's not how high as we
[52:38] heard this morning you can jump
[52:41] what did Brother Branham say it was he
[52:43] said as if you
[52:45] it's receiving the word of Truth for the
[52:48] day in which you live
[52:51] see Jesus never did he said Jesus never
[52:54] did stress the importance of works as he
[52:56] did the word
[52:58] he knew that if people got the word the
[53:00] word
[53:01] The Works would follow
[53:04] you see if I stopped there then I could
[53:06] have ended it with like most people do
[53:08] well I guess that means we don't have to
[53:09] have works I guess that means we don't
[53:11] have to have a shout and service we
[53:12] don't have to get emotional
[53:15] well okay moving on
[53:19] now Jesus knew there was going to be a
[53:21] terrible drift away from the word
[53:23] in the pergament church age
[53:25] and which was at yet 200 years off the
[53:28] patman's vision he knew the drift would
[53:30] cause them to go into the Dark Ages he
[53:32] knew that the way men originally got
[53:35] away from God was by first leaving the
[53:39] word
[53:40] if you leave the word church you've left
[53:43] God
[53:44] I'm going to skip down to this
[53:46] man this this this this just blessed my
[53:49] heart I wonder if we are sufficiently
[53:52] impressed with the word in our midst
[53:58] what do you mean what do you mean by
[53:59] brother what do you mean by that brother
[54:01] Jeremy I wonder if we are impressed with
[54:04] the word of God that is being preached
[54:06] if you say oh I I am impressed then why
[54:08] are we looking for other things why are
[54:10] we trying to feel it with other things
[54:12] of the world why are we trying to fill
[54:13] it with our ideas
[54:17] it becomes idolatry
[54:20] to put our ideas over the things of God
[54:23] and even the chosen uh tribes of Israel
[54:26] too were blotted out because of idolatry
[54:30] leaders of idolatry I I can't remember
[54:33] the tribe right now but one of the
[54:34] tribes brother Joe even made it to their
[54:37] Promised Land
[54:39] but because they were surrounded by the
[54:41] enemy they lost faith in the word and
[54:44] left their promise and made their City
[54:46] somewhere else
[54:48] how many of us have made it to the
[54:51] promised land I'm going to remind you
[54:53] that you are going to be surrounded
[54:56] the enemy doesn't want you to have it
[54:58] why do you think you're fighting so hard
[55:00] why do you think that addiction is
[55:02] fighting you so hard why do you think
[55:04] the world is pulling at you so hard
[55:06] because you're at the moment of
[55:07] breakthrough
[55:09] there's nothing like a pastor knowing
[55:12] when someone's at the moment of
[55:13] breakthrough but they let their past
[55:15] hold them back they don't know that that
[55:18] decision that moment Demands a decision
[55:23] are you sufficiently impressed with the
[55:25] word
[55:26] oh little bride tonight
[55:29] do you know the power that you have
[55:32] in your hand
[55:34] well what do you mean what power
[55:37] what a time it is to actually be able to
[55:39] overcome
[55:42] to not let the root of bitterness rule
[55:44] our life
[55:46] that bitterness is a big thing in
[55:47] churches
[55:49] it's a big thing in families
[55:51] bitterness and we all have a right to
[55:53] have it
[55:55] we all have a right brother Joe to have
[55:57] bitterness
[55:58] because some somebody done me wrong
[55:59] somewhere along the way
[56:01] and yet Jesus said father forgive him
[56:04] for they know not what they're doing
[56:06] Stephen preached with the greatest
[56:07] sermon in his life as he was dying by
[56:10] the Stones of his haters
[56:13] and yet bitterness rules
[56:15] our life
[56:18] here's a great quote I like from Smith
[56:20] Wigglesworth and we're coming to a close
[56:21] for this portion is that it is an insult
[56:24] to ask God for power
[56:27] after you receive the baptism of the
[56:29] Holy Ghost
[56:31] I'm going to say it again it's an insult
[56:33] to ask God for power after you've
[56:36] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:38] why because you have power
[56:40] you just have to act
[56:43] the power of God was placed in you
[56:45] healing was already placed in you you
[56:47] remember the man that went to Brother
[56:48] Brandon and he said oh this brother
[56:50] couldn't do anything for me this brother
[56:51] couldn't do anything for me so I came to
[56:53] you he said you've done it all wrong
[56:56] you've come to the wrong place I can't
[56:58] do anything for you you've got to find
[57:00] Christ
[57:02] you say well if brother Brennan was here
[57:04] he'd make it all right no go to Christ
[57:06] well if brother Tim would have shook in
[57:08] my hand no go to Christ
[57:11] find Christ
[57:13] because the road demands us to act
[57:17] choose you today was it was it brought
[57:19] forth who do you say that he is can you
[57:22] take up your cross and follow him can
[57:24] you forsake all
[57:26] because behold I stand at the door and
[57:28] knock
[57:30] and if any man hear my voice
[57:33] how many actually are hearing his voice
[57:35] without opening the door I'm not talking
[57:37] about you but it's a sad thing that's
[57:38] out there you ever just been in a crowd
[57:40] of people
[57:42] and nobody
[57:44] that you could see around you believe
[57:46] the message or knew of it
[57:48] you ever just been surrounded by it
[57:51] I'll tell you one of the biggest places
[57:53] to be surrounded by it is at least for
[57:54] me where I'm always surrounded by crowds
[57:56] is at the at the parks in Florida in
[57:58] fact I found myself there here last year
[58:00] and standing there in this line of
[58:02] people and I said oh God
[58:04] does anybody here
[58:07] where are they standing where are they
[58:08] where are they at
[58:10] what did it do it makes us humble
[58:14] how could God choose someone like me
[58:16] listen I don't deserve to be behind this
[58:18] Pulpit I have done things in my life
[58:20] that I'm ashamed of who hasn't
[58:23] I've spit in his face who hasn't
[58:26] but it's by the grace of God that he
[58:28] called us and he and he placed in front
[58:31] of me a decision I had to stand at the
[58:34] altar one day and I had to come to a
[58:36] place in my life where I didn't care I
[58:38] didn't care to me what my fellow friends
[58:40] thought it didn't care to me what anyone
[58:42] said I want to just surrender to God I
[58:44] didn't care how embarrassing it was I
[58:47] was willing to do what I had to do again
[58:50] some people don't believe in it but this
[58:51] is one of the things that I was going
[58:52] through and I remember one of the
[58:54] services that I was a part of and we
[58:56] were singing the song bloodbot Church
[58:57] man that's a powerful song and I'll
[59:00] never forget it I was like 12 13 years
[59:01] old and we were actually doing a church
[59:03] March
[59:04] and I had never broke free never broke
[59:07] loose I was too ashamed I was nervous I
[59:10] was always caring about what other
[59:11] people thought and I will never forget
[59:13] that that moment when God Came Upon me
[59:16] and in my heart he said you run
[59:20] how many ever felt that before you run
[59:23] well but but what will people say and
[59:26] she's singing the song bloodbot Church
[59:28] hey I was a part of the March man
[59:30] that's good enough I got out of my pew
[59:33] I was marching around the church with
[59:34] everybody I was with the crowd
[59:38] it's easy to do when everyone else is
[59:40] but when God tells you to do something
[59:42] that no one else is doing
[59:44] are you all in
[59:47] uh-huh
[59:49] and all of a sudden it left brother Tim
[59:51] it left me and it was like my life was
[59:53] over
[59:55] I felt like I had I was on my road to
[59:58] hell you say over not running around the
[1:00:00] church you're an idiot I'm telling you
[1:00:02] how I felt
[1:00:05] I felt like I had crossed the line and
[1:00:07] that song was going and it didn't mean
[1:00:09] anything to me anymore the only thing it
[1:00:12] was I said God bring the desire back to
[1:00:15] me bring the desire ask me one more time
[1:00:18] lord and I promise you because I just
[1:00:20] didn't want to do it now I wanted the
[1:00:22] same feeling I wanted the same pool
[1:00:25] how many remembers that when you said
[1:00:26] God bring the pull back
[1:00:28] I'm tired of just going to church I'm
[1:00:31] tired of just singing the same old songs
[1:00:33] bring the same pool back I begged God
[1:00:35] God bring it back bring the pull back
[1:00:37] and I'll never forget it oh and we are
[1:00:41] and right at that moment the pool came
[1:00:42] and I was gone boy I thought I was
[1:00:46] flying
[1:00:48] I literally did there there was no one
[1:00:50] around me
[1:00:51] that's the way I felt I was in the
[1:00:54] presence of God
[1:00:56] oh brother Jeremy you'd never had battle
[1:00:58] since then buddy I had him worse
[1:01:01] Satan fought he he did everything he
[1:01:03] could but one one blessing leads to
[1:01:07] another blessing
[1:01:08] one prayer leads to another prayer
[1:01:11] one one desire leads to another desire I
[1:01:13] want more of God but I asked them to put
[1:01:16] this up here tonight
[1:01:18] sister Jessica get ready I asked him to
[1:01:20] put this up tonight for one reason I'm
[1:01:21] going to ask you a question and I want

[1:25:24] amen God bless you
[1:25:27] we're going to go into the communion
[1:25:29] service
[1:25:31] as we just look to the Lord tonight
[1:25:36] and I just wanted to say
[1:25:42] God set for the children of Israel
[1:25:45] a time of Passover
[1:25:48] it would be a very very serious hour in
[1:25:52] time where death was coming through the
[1:25:53] land
[1:25:56] and they were leaving the land of Egypt
[1:25:59] going to the promised land
[1:26:02] and he said I want you to make
[1:26:04] the bread of haste
[1:26:07] that means I if you're not going to have
[1:26:09] time for 11 to be put into bread and
[1:26:12] raise the bread
[1:26:14] you're going to eat at unleavened
[1:26:16] [Music]
[1:26:18] because it's a bread of haste
[1:26:20] you're not going to mix anything in it
[1:26:23] it's going to be just a pure bread
[1:26:26] itself
[1:26:29] and it become a type of sin that you
[1:26:33] know you don't you can't mix anything
[1:26:36] with the true wheat of God
[1:26:40] and raise it up make it more platform
[1:26:42] make religion more easy no
[1:26:46] you can't do that
[1:26:49] God must start with the Passover and eat
[1:26:52] we tell them now I want you to do this
[1:26:54] yearly I want you to take a lamb without
[1:26:56] blemish
[1:26:58] and I want you to offer it it's got to
[1:27:00] be kept up so many days and examine
[1:27:03] seated as a perfect lamb
[1:27:07] and then if that lamb is accepted then
[1:27:10] you are accepted
[1:27:12] and this is what I want for you is I
[1:27:15] want to have this time of Passover will
[1:27:17] you remember when the death angel passed
[1:27:20] over your homes because remember you
[1:27:24] should have died too
[1:27:26] you were just as bad and wicked a people
[1:27:29] as each have ever thought about being
[1:27:32] and you should have been under judgment
[1:27:34] as well but the lamb took your judgment
[1:27:38] and this so there had to be a death and
[1:27:40] a dying in every home and so the lamb
[1:27:43] died in the place
[1:27:45] of the firstborn of the children of
[1:27:48] Israel
[1:27:50] you know I don't believe that Passover
[1:27:53] is just something that we should do it
[1:27:55] should have been done just once a year
[1:27:57] but I I think that in all reality God
[1:27:59] wants us to live and Passover
[1:28:02] where that leaven is out of our lives
[1:28:05] and we are eating the lamb and we are
[1:28:07] fellowshipping with Christ and we are
[1:28:09] walking with him
[1:28:12] now when it comes down to the New
[1:28:14] Testament
[1:28:15] they were they were weekly breaking the
[1:28:19] bread together and and um you know then
[1:28:22] and they because the original communion
[1:28:25] was a Passover service and and the you
[1:28:29] know some had plenty and some were poor
[1:28:32] and you know so Paul said you know I
[1:28:35] I've got to set this in order we can't
[1:28:37] be having a fellowship meal every Every
[1:28:40] Time We Gather like this
[1:28:42] but I tell you I received of the Lord
[1:28:45] what I'm to do
[1:28:47] and so he reminded us that the Lord
[1:28:50] Jesus tonight that he was betrayed that
[1:28:52] he took bread and he break it and when
[1:28:55] he had given thanks he said take eat
[1:28:57] this is my body
[1:28:59] which is broken for you and that do this
[1:29:01] in remembrance of me I want you to
[1:29:04] remember me that my body was broken for
[1:29:08] you
[1:29:09] and after the same manner then he took
[1:29:11] the cup
[1:29:12] and when he had slept he said this cup
[1:29:14] is the New Testament in my blood this
[1:29:16] New Year's office you drink it and
[1:29:18] remembered to me I want you to remember
[1:29:21] my blood was shed for you
[1:29:25] and then he then he went on to say
[1:29:28] um that as often as you eat and you
[1:29:31] drink eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:29:33] you show the Lord's death till he comes
[1:29:36] you you you are are showing of his death
[1:29:40] and that he died in your place
[1:29:43] that he that you have accepted him and
[1:29:46] his pardon and and his blood has been
[1:29:49] applied to your life
[1:29:51] and so symbolically today we're coming
[1:29:55] down where we're coming and taking of
[1:29:58] one loaf
[1:30:00] and it has been broken into many pieces
[1:30:04] because God's body today of course is
[1:30:07] no longer the man of Calvary but it's
[1:30:10] his body that's upon the Earth and we
[1:30:12] are a multi-membered body
[1:30:14] so when you take of that bread you
[1:30:16] remember you look at it and you remember
[1:30:18] I am a part of the body of Christ
[1:30:23] it matters how that I behave it matters
[1:30:26] how that I represent the rest of the
[1:30:29] body
[1:30:30] and my behavior and my actions when I'm
[1:30:32] away from others I want to remember I
[1:30:36] got to discern we are not playing Church
[1:30:40] but I'm Discerning the Lord's body now
[1:30:43] Paul would say many are sick and weakly
[1:30:45] among you because they did not discern
[1:30:48] that this was not playing church this is
[1:30:51] not just a common assembly but this is
[1:30:54] that we that this was the Lord's body
[1:30:57] and we discerned that we were a part of
[1:31:00] it and our Behavior demanded the respect
[1:31:05] that is shown to be in this part of his
[1:31:08] body
[1:31:09] again we would take of the fruit of the
[1:31:11] vine the life of the grapes squeezed out
[1:31:14] there and the the the and then the
[1:31:18] fermentation the spirit within it and
[1:31:22] then it would come as the wine to drink
[1:31:25] of the cup and that cup was to represent
[1:31:28] the life of God that was poured out
[1:31:31] which is the Holy Spirit
[1:31:34] and you are to be reminded that as you
[1:31:37] drink it and it burns down on the inside
[1:31:39] of you that the holy spirit is a burning
[1:31:43] fire
[1:31:44] and that there as we just take a just
[1:31:48] that portion of it in the natural but in
[1:31:51] the spiritual
[1:31:52] the Bible said you know made it clear
[1:31:54] we're not to be drunk on the line but to
[1:31:57] be filled with the spirit which means
[1:32:00] that we are to be so even though we
[1:32:03] don't get drunk on the wine or we don't
[1:32:05] over indulge on the wine but we start to
[1:32:08] overindulge in the spirit be filled with
[1:32:12] the spirit
[1:32:13] so again we are to remember we are the
[1:32:17] body of Christ we're part of the loaf
[1:32:19] each one of us had us apart there
[1:32:22] without you we're not complete
[1:32:26] and so together we make up the loaf
[1:32:29] and then
[1:32:30] we take of his life within us
[1:32:34] and so he he told us that we must
[1:32:36] realize that we're not playing church
[1:32:40] this is
[1:32:41] where we come to take the the bread the
[1:32:46] unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth
[1:32:49] so wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:32:52] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:32:54] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:32:56] and the blood of the Lord
[1:32:58] but then he said let a man examine
[1:33:00] himself
[1:33:03] and then so let him eat of that bread
[1:33:05] and drink of that cup
[1:33:07] for heated that eateth and drinketh
[1:33:09] unworthily eateth and drink a damnation
[1:33:11] himself not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:33:14] and he said this is why some are dead
[1:33:16] some are sleeping he said this is why
[1:33:19] many are sick and weekly because if we
[1:33:22] would have judged ourselves we would not
[1:33:24] come under the Judgment of God
[1:33:27] so you see as a very serious moment
[1:33:29] because he said when we're judged we're
[1:33:31] chasing of the Lord that we should not
[1:33:34] be condemned with the world this is a
[1:33:36] wonderful thing
[1:33:37] because even in the chastening
[1:33:40] where that when he judges us for what we
[1:33:44] do and he chases and he corrects us it
[1:33:47] identifies us as his sons and his
[1:33:50] daughters amen we are chastened of the
[1:33:53] Lord because we're not going to be
[1:33:56] condemned with the world
[1:33:59] amen so we thank the Lord for this Grace
[1:34:01] Upon Our Lives and
[1:34:04] I'll tell you what in this moment I'm
[1:34:06] just going to have you be seated
[1:34:13] we're going to prepare the communion
[1:34:14] tables so the brothers that will be
[1:34:16] helping me to if they will come down
[1:34:19] and I'm going to just explain something
[1:34:21] to you though those of you that has not
[1:34:23] been here in a communion footwashing
[1:34:26] service
[1:34:27] so that you'll know what we are how we
[1:34:30] are going to conduct a service
[1:34:32] here tonight and I pray that you know
[1:34:35] for one thing that you you will excuse
[1:34:38] those who will be on the platform
[1:34:40] musicians and their families if they
[1:34:42] come up ahead and and move ahead first
[1:34:46] but the deacons will be us from you row
[1:34:49] by row and then we have two places for
[1:34:52] foot wash and the men will be on this
[1:34:54] side where we have it set up in the
[1:34:56] hallway over here the women on this side
[1:34:58] we ask that you will be respectful of
[1:35:00] that the women here the men here
[1:35:03] if you're elderly or otherwise unable to
[1:35:05] get on your knees to wash feet just
[1:35:07] return to your seat be in prayer while
[1:35:09] we return to conclude the service but
[1:35:12] what will happen is that the deacons
[1:35:15] will Usher you down
[1:35:17] um the rose and you'll go out this door
[1:35:20] men to the right women to the left those
[1:35:23] who are not going to be washing feet
[1:35:25] they will just go back to their seat and
[1:35:27] be in prayer until we conclude the
[1:35:29] service
[1:35:30] and some of our young children are young
[1:35:33] enough are old enough rather to remain
[1:35:35] in the sanctuary while the parents go
[1:35:37] out and I want to encourage you fathers
[1:35:40] to to take a youngster with you if you
[1:35:43] can for so your mother the mothers won't
[1:35:45] have to deal with so many but whatever
[1:35:46] be reverent be just respectful only
[1:35:50] praying no visiting or talking only when
[1:35:53] necessary this is a very this is all a
[1:35:56] part of a very important service
[1:35:59] now we know
[1:36:00] that Jesus comes down to the the
[1:36:04] Passover and after the Passover after
[1:36:07] the supper and the communion where he
[1:36:10] passes the bread and the wine
[1:36:12] then he he
[1:36:14] girds itself with a towel and takes a
[1:36:17] basin and pours water into it and he
[1:36:21] goes to wash the different disciples
[1:36:24] feet
[1:36:25] and as he does he comes to Peter and
[1:36:29] Peter says but you'll not wash my feet
[1:36:32] and and he said Peter if I don't wash
[1:36:36] your feet you have no part with me
[1:36:39] and he and of course Peter being all the
[1:36:42] way kind of presumptuous like he always
[1:36:43] was you know he said well then Lord you
[1:36:46] know I I then do my head my hands and my
[1:36:49] feet just you know just watched me all
[1:36:50] over and he said no he said he that has
[1:36:53] been washed he that's been bathed and
[1:36:56] those days he had bath houses
[1:36:58] and they they would take their bath and
[1:37:02] ceremonial baths and so on the uniform
[1:37:04] services like this but when they walked
[1:37:07] the path
[1:37:09] to get to the upper room where they were
[1:37:12] going that was secured for the Passover
[1:37:14] there they would have to walk down the
[1:37:17] trail of where the animals and people
[1:37:20] men had walked and all kinds of things
[1:37:22] and they picked up the dirt along the
[1:37:25] road
[1:37:26] and this is a thing that happens with us
[1:37:29] as a Christian
[1:37:30] when we have been lost he has lost us
[1:37:34] our minds are hands we've washed us made
[1:37:39] us clean but you know when we walk in
[1:37:41] the path of life
[1:37:43] when we go out into the world and we
[1:37:45] walk into the path where others have
[1:37:47] gone you know we pick up contamination
[1:37:51] along the way
[1:37:53] we remember
[1:37:54] that this is the part with foot washing
[1:37:59] foot washing is to remember that we as
[1:38:02] saints of God are to encourage one
[1:38:04] another
[1:38:05] washing the dirt from one another's feet
[1:38:09] and encouraging them helping them along
[1:38:13] the path of life in life's journey
[1:38:16] you've been washed the Holy Spirit has
[1:38:19] filled you but we come for this service
[1:38:22] tonight in a foot washing and it's again
[1:38:27] ceremonial it's an ordinance that we are
[1:38:30] to fulfill water baptism is one of them
[1:38:33] communion is another what and then the
[1:38:36] foot washing is the other and it is to
[1:38:39] remind us
[1:38:41] why we are here
[1:38:43] that we are not here to be served
[1:38:48] but we are here to serve
[1:38:51] it is to remind us
[1:38:54] that nobody is big
[1:38:56] and nobody's little Among Us
[1:38:59] we're all one part of this body
[1:39:02] and we wash one another's feet
[1:39:05] that true Christianity comes with
[1:39:08] humility
[1:39:09] with surrenders of our life to serve God
[1:39:13] now I want you to Bow your heads with me
[1:39:20] father
[1:39:22] as we come before your throne of grace
[1:39:24] today

[1:39:30] things that are written in your word and
[1:39:33] we've heard a marvelous message and our
[1:39:35] hearts was moved and Lord I want to
[1:39:37] thank you for each heart
[1:39:39] that you moved upon
[1:39:42] and I believe Lord that there's been
[1:39:44] some very Eternal things that have
[1:39:46] happened even in this service today
[1:39:50] Lord I believe that even in this moment
[1:39:52] that we've purged our hearts
[1:39:55] we've looked at even the parasites that
[1:39:58] we want to hang on or
[1:40:00] some kind of fungi that has to be cut
[1:40:03] out by the Holy Spirit
[1:40:05] Lord there's something that we can't
[1:40:06] take in the Rapture something that
[1:40:09] that we that would keep us Earth bound
[1:40:12] and Lord today you have by the holy
[1:40:15] spirit so graciously
[1:40:17] circumcised and cleansed and cut away
[1:40:21] the flesh as it were and Lord made us
[1:40:24] presentable unto you

[1:40:30] bread and the wine
