[22:31] and we've asked for prayer before for
[22:33] sister Rebecca Paige over in Phoenix and
[22:39] and just
[22:40] when we asked for prayer for her we'd
[22:43] ask that the Lord would touch her heart
[22:44] and change her life as well and we're
[22:46] already seeing that work being done
[22:49] thankful for that and thank you for
[22:52] such a wonderful wonderful God and we
[22:55] believe that he can continue to draw her
[22:57] closer to him and change her body and
[22:59] change your life and I mean that's what
[23:01] we all want tonight is just to be drawn
[23:03] closer to the bosom of Christ

[24:17] sin before any sickness he was the lamb
[24:20] slain
[24:21] so he's already provided what we have
[24:23] need of tonight none of this catches him
[24:25] unaware
[24:26] But Not only was he aware but he has
[24:29] provided and we believe that tonight so

[24:35] humbly come before you and enter into
[24:37] your presence tonight Lord with

[43:24] may think father
[43:25] God I can backtrack my life and surely
[43:28] Lord
[43:29] I have a reason
[43:32] have a joy in my heart there's a shadow
[43:34] of the King on the inside
[43:36] God I was heading one way
[43:38] but now I'm headed completely different
[43:40] direction Lord many here tonight
[43:42] Lord they were heading a different road
[43:44] but father you came by and you stepped
[43:46] on the scene father you turned their
[43:49] hearts and their lives around and Lord
[43:50] we can sing it tonight mighty mighty you
[43:53] are
[43:54] holy you are unworthy you are o God
[43:58] oh and that's what we want to do we
[44:00] never want to be caught on the sidelines
[44:02] not worshiping our Lord
[44:04] but father may you find our worship
[44:06] pleasing and our Our Praise may it be a
[44:09] a sweet smelling Savor in our nostrils
[44:11] tonight oh God
[44:13] Lord as we commit this service now to
[44:15] you we ask the Lord you'll anoint
[44:17] the lips of the speaker in the ears of
[44:19] the hearer father those on the stream
[44:21] and those present God may we just
[44:23] cultivate an atmosphere of worship
[44:24] tonight and just allow the Holy Spirit
[44:27] as we already fill him him here tonight
[44:31] Lord just to have your way father
[44:34] we give you of ourselves Lord our time
[44:36] our gifts our talents
[44:38] father we ask that you speak to us
[44:40] tonight
[44:41] we ask it in Jesus name amen if you have
[44:44] your Bibles tonight we're going to look
[44:45] in Leviticus
[44:49] look here in Leviticus and we're going
[44:51] to Leviticus 23 and we'll start at verse
[44:53] 1.
[44:56] just going to read the first three
[44:57] scriptures or the three three scriptures
[44:59] here then we'll have you be seated
[45:01] and said the Lord's
[45:04] spake unto Moses saying
[45:07] speaking to the children of Israel and
[45:09] say unto them concerning the Feast of
[45:11] the Lord which you shall Proclaim to be
[45:13] holy convocations even these are my
[45:17] Feasts six days shall work be done but
[45:20] on the seventh day is the Sabbath of
[45:22] rest a holy convocation you shall do no
[45:26] work therein it is the day of Sabbath of
[45:29] the Lord and all your dwellings God
[45:32] bless you you can have your seats this
[45:33] evening
[45:34] and I want to take just for a topic
[45:36] tonight
[45:38] Feast of freedom
[45:40] you said well brother I don't find that
[45:42] in the Bible you're exactly right but
[45:44] that's okay
[45:45] Feast of Freedom this word Feast here
[45:48] that we picked up on and
[45:50] uh the second verse here actually means
[45:54] a properly and an appointment is a fixed
[45:57] time an appointed time or season
[46:01] specifically a festival
[46:04] so I want you to clue in here
[46:07] so this is a feast of freedom and the
[46:09] word Festival is a day or a period of
[46:13] Celebration typically a religious
[46:16] commemoration
[46:19] a lot of times people want to put things
[46:21] over us as Christians and and we're
[46:23] afraid to worship freedom to let go free
[46:26] to allow the spirit to move even here
[46:29] locally there's some times that we come
[46:31] and some of us and I'm not here to
[46:33] criticize tonight but you bring a wet
[46:35] blanket with you to the house of God and
[46:37] you need to take the wet blanket dried
[46:38] out and then come and fan the fires so
[46:41] we find here though that when we look
[46:43] through Leviticus 23 we find that there
[46:46] are seven feasts that are mentioned
[46:48] there is the Feast of Passover which is
[46:50] the Haggadah which is actually the Feast
[46:53] of freedom
[46:54] that's where we get the the title
[46:57] tonight is the Feast of Freedom see the
[46:59] Passover is a Jewish feast or a Jewish
[47:02] Festival or a Jewish celebration of
[47:05] their freedoms it was celebrated about
[47:07] the same time as Easter and it lasts
[47:10] typically seven to eight days and during
[47:12] the Passover Jews around the world they
[47:15] remembered their freedom from slavery in
[47:18] Egypt notice they're not in Egypt
[47:21] anymore but they recall the time that
[47:24] they were once slaves and if there was
[47:26] ever a people that should be able to
[47:28] recall a time that you were once saved
[47:30] but now you're no longer a slave and
[47:33] what does it do it causes a festivity it
[47:36] causes a celebration a celebration of
[47:39] worship a celebration of Praise
[47:41] acceleration of adoration you're not
[47:43] concerned about the critics you're not
[47:45] concerned about the Pharaohs you're not
[47:47] concerned about the murmurs or the
[47:49] complainers why because you are no
[47:51] longer in Egypt but we are free
[47:55] and so this is the committation that we
[47:58] are no longer held by man-made ideas
[48:00] we're no longer held by sin's changed
[48:03] but we have been made free by the blood
[48:05] of Jesus Christ
[48:07] it is a feast of freedom
[48:10] a celebration of freedom
[48:12] a celebration of your liberties
[48:16] think about brother Philip nine years
[48:18] he's been a born-again believer
[48:24] nine years some of you a lot longer but
[48:26] don't you ever forget that day
[48:29] don't you ever forget that day when he
[48:32] came
[48:32] and so sweetly wiped all your sins away
[48:36] and don't forget that day when you
[48:39] strove and you tried it and you come
[48:41] through justification and you come
[48:43] through the process of a sanctification
[48:45] but one day of that day that important
[48:48] day he came down to filled your life
[48:51] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[48:53] want to talk about a celebration you
[48:55] want to talk about you can't hold
[48:57] yourself you don't have the power within
[48:59] your own Humanity to keep yourself but
[49:01] he sent you down the Holy Ghost for one
[49:04] purpose is to keep you
[49:08] notice we find that there's a feast of
[49:10] unleavened bread there's a feast of the
[49:12] first fruits in the Feast of Weeks and
[49:14] the Feast of trumpets and the Feast of
[49:16] atonement and the feasts of boost or the
[49:18] Feast of Tabernacles seven Feasts
[49:21] God thought so much about these that he
[49:24] caused a celebration
[49:28] yeah now some of you how many of you
[49:29] been watching The Chosen series
[49:32] raise your hands up good and high
[49:34] you know the Jews know how to have a
[49:36] celebration
[49:38] they're not afraid of what others are
[49:40] thinking you'll see them dancing around
[49:42] in a circle or you see them you know we
[49:45] hear about the Sabbat and we hear about
[49:46] this and the Sabbath and all these other
[49:48] things the Shabbat and all this and yet
[49:51] they experience they're not worried
[49:52] about the criticizers they're not
[49:54] worried about those that murmur and
[49:56] complain why because they are bound to
[49:58] the law and there was a set law there
[50:00] that on this certain time at this
[50:03] certain day at this certain hour you are
[50:05] to do a feast you ought to remember that
[50:07] you're no longer in Egypt Penny Lord you
[50:09] were the held there 400 years but you're
[50:12] not there today let me tell you you got
[50:14] to remember too church that you're no
[50:16] longer in sin those things that the
[50:18] devil's trying to hold over you he's
[50:19] trying to put the memory of you
[50:21] yesterday until you're today but all you
[50:23] got to do is remember that God had made
[50:25] a way and you need to begin to celebrate
[50:27] what God has done for you come to the
[50:29] house of God with the exuberation I'm
[50:32] here to worship I'm no longer in Chains
[50:34] I'm no longer in fact but I have been
[50:37] made free by the blessings of almighty
[50:39] God
[50:42] see the major theme of these feasts is
[50:45] gratitude
[50:48] see an ungrateful heart
[50:51] is an unfeeling heart
[50:54] an ungrateful heart is an unloving heart
[50:59] an ungrateful heart is an unbelieving
[51:02] heart
[51:04] an ungrateful heart
[51:06] is a disobedient heart
[51:09] and they had these set Feasts and it was
[51:13] to be grateful
[51:15] and I'm no longer in bondage
[51:17] to be grateful for what God has done and
[51:21] what God will do
[51:23] if he was God for you yesterday he's got
[51:26] for you today and he'll be God for you
[51:28] tomorrow don't worry about what you're
[51:30] facing don't worry about because you
[51:32] don't have the answers God will provide
[51:34] the answer at the right season at the
[51:37] right time just celebrate with God
[51:39] celebrate what he's done for you trust
[51:41] in the Lord lean not to your own
[51:43] understanding but in all thy ways trust
[51:46] him he will lead you he will guide you
[51:49] he will protect you he will heal you he
[51:51] will deliver you and he will fill you
[51:53] with the Holy Ghost and give you a
[51:55] reason to shout
[51:57] a reason to celebrate
[52:01] you know brother Brandon would tell us
[52:03] that the believer the Christians should
[52:04] be the happiest people on the Earth
[52:10] so we're gonna put a sign on the door we
[52:13] ain't really gonna do that I'm just
[52:14] telling you
[52:15] smile when you come in
[52:17] smile when you worship
[52:19] smile when you're seated
[52:22] say Amen it's okay
[52:26] but we find an ungrateful heart is a
[52:28] heart that can't feel
[52:30] an ungrateful heart gets covered up with
[52:33] bitterness and grudges and complexes and
[52:35] doubts and all these other different
[52:37] things an ungrateful heart
[52:39] because if you're not grateful to God
[52:41] for what he's done for you in your life
[52:42] and you're afraid to testify what he's
[52:44] done
[52:45] oh my
[52:47] God I don't have no clowns but
[52:48] testifying where I was at and where God
[52:50] has done for me nor do these brothers up
[52:52] here and not an ordered some of you but
[52:54] was he an ungrateful heart is a heart
[52:56] that'll get smutted up
[52:58] because it doesn't remember where they
[53:00] were
[53:01] and doesn't remember the life that they
[53:03] once lived it doesn't remember that they
[53:05] needed a savior
[53:08] but notice now we're going to look here
[53:09] just for a little bit we're going to
[53:10] delve off into Leviticus just for a
[53:12] little bit you know I'm not a teacher so
[53:14] don't worry
[53:15] Leviticus 23 and verse 4 and these are
[53:17] the feast festivals I want you to get so
[53:20] when we think about facing the sound we
[53:22] think about a seven-course meal don't we
[53:23] like dinner on the grounds man there's
[53:25] all kind of food
[53:27] we ain't talking about that kind of
[53:28] feast though that is prepared with them
[53:30] but it's a celebration so I want you to
[53:33] think in your mind as I'm preaching this
[53:34] this evening rather when we bring the
[53:37] word Feast out think of a festivity
[53:39] think of a celebration some of you are
[53:41] holding on for Chronicles let me tell
[53:43] you I begin to celebrate right now I
[53:45] have to get to worship right now I begin
[53:47] to think in God right now why it may not
[53:49] appear that they're there but you got a
[53:51] promise laying in the word that day and
[53:53] their offspring shall be there I begin
[53:56] to celebrate brother Aaron I begin to
[53:59] praise God I begin to call the fatigue
[54:01] of the feast and give a fatty calf and
[54:03] invite those that come and worship with
[54:05] you and praise God with you
[54:09] notice now these are the feasts of the
[54:11] Lord even holy convocations which you
[54:13] shall Proclaim in their seasons in the
[54:16] 14th day of the first month and even is
[54:18] the Lord's Passover the Feast of Freedom
[54:22] it starts
[54:24] it starts with freedom
[54:26] it all starts with freedom notice now
[54:29] and on the 15th day of the same month is
[54:33] the Feast of unleavened bread
[54:36] unto the Lord seven days you must eat
[54:39] unleavened bread notice now brother
[54:41] Brandon would pick up and he was on
[54:43] God's only provided place of worship he
[54:46] would tell us seven days eat 11 breads
[54:48] no leaven shall be found amongst the
[54:51] bride no word added nothing no nothing
[54:54] remember one word caused every death
[54:57] that's in the Earth every illegitimate
[55:00] child was born because of Eve the first
[55:02] church the bride now the first Adam
[55:05] she doubted God's word and accepted a
[55:07] denominational or an intellectual or a
[55:10] school of exceptions of it because it
[55:12] was reasoned out so we find now through
[55:14] seven Church ages there was no mixing of
[55:17] man's idea in the word
[55:19] so we're to eat unleavened bread not
[55:21] man's idea but the God's holy word keep
[55:25] it pure keep it clean keep it away from
[55:28] man's touching it and the Ambassador
[55:30] dies in it but we got to keep the word
[55:32] holy and he said for seven days seven
[55:35] Church ages and that's why we're here in
[55:38] the final age with the pure word with
[55:40] the pure message and we're rejoicing in
[55:42] a pure Liberty where it Christ has made
[55:44] us free
[55:47] we dropped down the Leviticus 23 and
[55:49] verse 9.
[55:51] and the Lord speaking to Moses saying
[55:53] Speak unto the children of Israel and
[55:55] say unto them notice not if
[55:59] but when
[56:01] you be coming to the land which I give
[56:03] unto you and ye shall reap the Harvest
[56:05] thereof
[56:07] then you shall bring a Sheaf and this is
[56:09] a heap or a measure
[56:12] are the first fruits of your Harvest
[56:14] unto the priest and he shall wave the
[56:16] Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for
[56:19] you on the moral after the Sabbath the
[56:21] priest shall wave it notice the Sheaf
[56:24] could not be presented until they got
[56:26] into the land
[56:29] see some of us and we're not we're not
[56:32] going to criticize your jump on your
[56:34] shelf
[56:36] because that's what we believe for we're
[56:37] going to believe for your jump and your
[56:39] Shadow and your real experience but he's
[56:40] noticed here they could not present the
[56:43] sheep or the wave offering until they
[56:46] came into the land until they planted
[56:48] the seed of the crop and then they took
[56:50] the first fruits of it and they took it
[56:52] to the priest and he would wave it over
[56:54] the congregation see God established his
[56:57] Feast he established it with the
[57:00] memorial uh that they have come out of
[57:02] Egypt and this is just the first fruits
[57:04] of what God is going to do for them in
[57:06] the land
[57:08] but it all starts taking place around
[57:11] they had to leave
[57:13] come on somebody some of you need to
[57:16] leave some of those dead pots that
[57:18] you're in some of you stuck in
[57:19] depression some of you stuck in grudges
[57:21] and bitterness and all these other
[57:23] things some of you are stuck there some
[57:24] of you need to get up and pack out and
[57:27] leave the Egypt that you're in and
[57:28] realize God has called you to be free
[57:31] some of you men need to lead that
[57:33] pornography site and realize you have
[57:36] been made free tonight
[57:39] leave it behind you're being called out
[57:42] in the freeze of the first fruits was a
[57:44] memorial that you no longer in Egypt you
[57:47] have been caught and this is the first
[57:49] fruits of the land and what did God do
[57:51] on the day of Pentecost God poured down
[57:53] the Holy Ghost as the first fruits that
[57:56] there was going to be more coming this
[57:58] is only the beginning but I've got more
[58:00] for you and it's going to be a harvest
[58:02] at the end of the road
[58:07] see God established this feast
[58:10] he wanted to be a time of Celebration
[58:13] he didn't expect him to come dragging in
[58:16] well my goodness
[58:18] his church today no they were excited
[58:23] they're in a new land
[58:24] they're in a promising
[58:26] oh my there's untapped resources in this
[58:30] land
[58:31] notice they come out of Egypt they come
[58:35] out of the hardships they come out from
[58:37] under the rule of the taskmasters they
[58:39] come into a land that God had promised
[58:41] and the wave sheep brother bran will
[58:43] tell us the way she is the Holy Ghost
[58:46] it's the Holy Ghost it is the first
[58:49] fruits
[58:51] oh my church God thought so much of it
[58:54] Daddy he established a time of
[58:57] celebration around it
[58:59] and people don't want us to get excited
[59:01] when we get the Holy Ghost
[59:03] oh my they want you to be all starchy

[1:00:55] hauled me down to the Paddy Wagon
[1:00:57] brother Jackson to the padded wagon and
[1:00:59] they beat me and they kicked me and and
[1:01:01] they punched me and they chunked me in
[1:01:03] that little Paddy Wagon with one other
[1:01:05] guy it was dark and I was drunk and I
[1:01:07] was scared to death
[1:01:09] so they take me to the New Orleans
[1:01:11] Police Department brother Tim
[1:01:12] I was like oh Lord

[1:01:36] and so there was another college guy
[1:01:38] behind he was right there next to me he

[1:01:45] back I'll watch your back he said deal
[1:01:48] well his back got cleared a lot sooner
[1:01:50] than mine he got out of there
[1:01:52] and I was like oh now I'm here by myself
[1:01:54] and my friends they went back to Baton
[1:01:56] Rouge and left me there and I'm like no
[1:01:59] you ain't leaving me here
[1:02:01] see that's what I'm trying to tell you
[1:02:02] tonight they left me in an unforsaken
[1:02:05] place an ungodly place and even though I
[1:02:08] was in a drunken stupor I realized I
[1:02:10] don't ever want to come back to this I
[1:02:13] don't ever want to come to this place
[1:02:14] ever again there's all sorts of life and
[1:02:17] what am I telling you that for because
[1:02:18] if you've ever been in bondage then
[1:02:20] you've ever been released from it you'll
[1:02:22] know daggone good and well that you
[1:02:24] don't want to go back to that you don't
[1:02:26] want to go back to that life you don't
[1:02:28] want to go back to that place and
[1:02:29] because God had broke the chain off of
[1:02:32] it and now you are free
[1:02:34] every day I never been to jail again
[1:02:38] it cured me
[1:02:42] not too long after that like I say
[1:02:43] praise the Lord
[1:02:46] I didn't know but he wanted me to go to
[1:02:47] jail so I could tell you that testimony
[1:02:49] and service tonight
[1:02:52] God has a sense of humor
[1:02:54] really that ain't why he did it but
[1:02:56] nevertheless
[1:02:57] so now we go down
[1:03:00] Feast of Weeks Leviticus 23 and verse 15
[1:03:03] and you shall count unto you from the
[1:03:06] morrow after the Sabbath from the day
[1:03:07] that you have brought the sheep of the
[1:03:09] wave offering seven sabbaths shall be
[1:03:12] complete even unto the morrow after the
[1:03:14] seventh Sabbath
[1:03:16] shout your number 50 days and you shall
[1:03:19] offer a new meat offering unto the Lord
[1:03:21] so the first fruits
[1:03:23] was poured out on the church seventh
[1:03:26] Sabbath ago or seven Church ages ago see
[1:03:30] that was the first fruits declaring that
[1:03:32] there's coming a harvest
[1:03:34] there's coming a time that there'll be
[1:03:35] more that comes to maturity and see
[1:03:37] we're not in the day of the first fruits
[1:03:40] we're in the day of the Pentecostal
[1:03:42] feast
[1:03:43] see the Feast of Weeks is also called
[1:03:45] The Feast of Pentecost because it was 50
[1:03:48] days after the Sabbath it was 50 days
[1:03:51] after the Passover excuse me so we're
[1:03:53] not living in a time where God is first
[1:03:56] now pouring out the Holy Ghost but we're
[1:03:58] living in a day when God is coming to
[1:04:01] harvest the bride God is coming to draw
[1:04:04] out a bride it's the time we're living
[1:04:06] in a time of Freedom if there are
[1:04:08] anybody on the place of the earth that
[1:04:11] should be free and declare their freedom
[1:04:12] should be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:14] tonight we should be the most happiest
[1:04:16] people that there is in all the land
[1:04:19] but brother Joe you don't know what I'm
[1:04:21] going through I know I don't know what
[1:04:23] you're going through and I know that
[1:04:24] it's heavy and I know that it's real but
[1:04:27] I also know you're not where you used to
[1:04:29] be I know that you're not in sin anymore
[1:04:31] you're not in denominational change
[1:04:33] anymore God has released you so no
[1:04:35] matter where you are God is in control
[1:04:37] God is leading you God is guiding you
[1:04:40] and you're free so you might as well
[1:04:42] worship you can't change tomorrow to
[1:04:45] worship God tonight
[1:04:46] [Applause]
[1:04:50] notice that we find here in Deuteronomy

[1:08:00] to look here and the Bible will tell us
[1:08:03] the Bible the prophet of God will tell
[1:08:05] us let me go back in the Feast of the
[1:08:06] trumpets he said now the Jews have been
[1:08:09] blinded waiting all this time while the
[1:08:12] Pentecostal first fruits have been
[1:08:13] poured out upon the church
[1:08:16] see and we come down through the
[1:08:17] martyr's age down through the reformer's
[1:08:19] age and now the calling out age three
[1:08:21] sections Same Spirit like father son the
[1:08:24] Holy Ghost same one but seven Church
[1:08:26] ages is being seven sabbaths exactly
[1:08:29] seven and he says now when he's revealed
[1:08:32] himself as a Son of God he's been
[1:08:34] revealing it to the church and the
[1:08:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost down through
[1:08:38] the ages in the Pentecostal agency just
[1:08:40] keep getting more and more justification
[1:08:43] under Luther sanctification under Wesley
[1:08:45] and the baptism on the Holy Ghost but we
[1:08:47] find under the Sixth Seal when The Sixth
[1:08:50] Seal opened there was persecution struck
[1:08:52] the Jews and it struck them in a literal
[1:08:54] sense but it strikes Us in an
[1:08:56] ecclesiastical manner anybody can say

[1:10:52] focused on Christ
[1:10:54] notice she's been criticized she's been
[1:10:56] made fun of she's been chastised by many
[1:10:59] for standing for the full word of God
[1:11:03] not just that intellectual understanding
[1:11:07] but the full word she's been called
[1:11:10] fanatic I know none of you are fanatical
[1:11:13] she's been called Holy Roller
[1:11:16] she's been labeled Pentecostal with a
[1:11:19] derogatory implementation
[1:11:22] no matter the attack though she's not
[1:11:25] turning back
[1:11:27] this means
[1:11:31] for there and did such a great job last
[1:11:33] week preaching on Total War
[1:11:35] bring your attack we ain't turning back
[1:11:37] we're staying with this word we're
[1:11:40] staying with this message we're not
[1:11:43] going to go off on man's idea we're not
[1:11:45] going off on some fairy tale Doctrine we
[1:11:47] are staying right here on thus saith the
[1:11:50] Lord well there's a jump in the Bible
[1:11:52] we're going to jump where there's a
[1:11:54] shout in the word and the shadow of the
[1:11:55] king is in the camp and we got something
[1:11:57] to shout about we're gonna throw our
[1:11:58] hands up and we're going to shout when
[1:12:00] you cross through the Red Sea and you
[1:12:02] realize you're no longer in sin you can
[1:12:04] grab your tambourine Mary and you can
[1:12:06] have yourself a tambourine dance a
[1:12:09] jubilee dance a red sequel Hallelujah
[1:12:12] you can cross the Red Sea again and
[1:12:14] realize all your tax Master each and
[1:12:16] every one that has ever lied to you that
[1:12:19] ever deceived you that ever tried to
[1:12:20] distribute your your joy away they're
[1:12:22] dead in the sea
[1:12:25] and you are free
[1:12:28] don't let somebody quieten your praise
[1:12:34] see the attack on the church today is no
[1:12:37] different than it was when they left
[1:12:38] Egypt you notice they had some of their
[1:12:40] own Kindred complaining and murmuring
[1:12:43] Moses you brought us out here Moses we
[1:12:45] don't have enough to eat Moses we don't
[1:12:47] have nothing to dream Moses Moses Moses
[1:12:50] brother Tim how would you feel if
[1:12:51] everybody in here came to you each and
[1:12:53] every day
[1:12:54] my God
[1:12:55] that'd be awful you may resign
[1:13:02] Moses was stuck
[1:13:05] he was God's leader to bring him out
[1:13:09] and now they want to complain Moses you
[1:13:11] take too much on yourself Moses Moses
[1:13:13] Moses and that's what we find today
[1:13:16] some of those would rather go back and
[1:13:18] live in bondage than live in Freedom
[1:13:22] then suffer a few hardships along the
[1:13:24] way before they got to the promised land
[1:13:28] and some look being a Christian is not a
[1:13:30] flowery bed of ease church we know we've
[1:13:33] all had our struggles and we're all
[1:13:35] going to face more struggles but the end
[1:13:37] goal is what we're pointed to
[1:13:40] and just as sure as God brought a bride
[1:13:42] out of Egypt and took her into a
[1:13:44] promised land and those that came out
[1:13:46] they wasn't hindered by the critics they
[1:13:48] wasn't hindered by all those and spoke
[1:13:49] evil and how she worshiped and how she
[1:13:52] danced there's going to be a bride
[1:13:54] called out of this hour out of this
[1:13:56] generation out of this age that she
[1:13:59] ain't looking at what the critics say
[1:14:00] they can get on YouTube they can get on
[1:14:02] whatever whatever social media they want
[1:14:04] to get on they can blast this church
[1:14:06] they can criticize us for being too loud
[1:14:08] they can criticize us for being too
[1:14:10] emotional they can criticize us for
[1:14:12] being too free but I'm telling you you
[1:14:14] can never be free enough and you might
[1:14:16] as well start enjoying it I don't care
[1:14:18] what the critics say I'll dance for the
[1:14:20] Lord if he wants me to I'll shout amen
[1:14:23] because why I know that I'm not in
[1:14:25] bondage anymore I know that I've been
[1:14:27] set free and the shackles of sin have
[1:14:30] been stripped off my life
[1:14:38] my brother Joe
[1:14:43] dude I really gotta act that way
[1:14:47] do we really got to do that
[1:14:50] we all have no new we don't all have to
[1:14:52] do that because we're not all alike
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:56] some of us are more enthusiastic than
[1:14:58] others
[1:15:00] some of us let's just be honest some of
[1:15:03] us are more free than others
[1:15:06] if you can ever get this thing right
[1:15:08] here free
[1:15:10] then these get free these get free that
[1:15:13] gets free oh
[1:15:16] but you got to release this thing from
[1:15:18] the prison that you put it here
[1:15:20] the prison of your doubts the prison
[1:15:22] what other is going to think about you
[1:15:23] the prison of oh you got your fears you
[1:15:25] got oh you did this so you can't worship
[1:15:27] no the Bible would tell us or the
[1:15:29] prophet God will tell us that we fall
[1:15:31] every day all that comes short of the
[1:15:33] glory of God but we don't just rest on
[1:15:35] this this thing here has got to be free
[1:15:37] and Paul said I Die daily he died to
[1:15:40] this thinking he died to his Humanity he
[1:15:42] died to his thoughts he died to his
[1:15:44] upbringing he died to his inner Lake he
[1:15:46] died so that he can be free and church
[1:15:48] we gotta die so that we can be free
[1:15:51] to yourself die to your own ideas die to
[1:15:54] your complexes tonight that's all those
[1:15:56] things so you can experience the Feast
[1:15:59] of freedom
[1:16:03] there's a feast you don't want to miss
[1:16:06] oh my
[1:16:07] notice
[1:16:09] Mary Magdalene she came to a a feast
[1:16:14] and there was Jesus sitting there with
[1:16:15] dirty feet
[1:16:17] and a Pharisees oh they were just
[1:16:19] complaining murmuring look at her
[1:16:22] what's he gonna do is he going to
[1:16:24] condemn her did he jerk his foot back no
[1:16:27] he didn't
[1:16:29] some of you need to come on up to the
[1:16:31] feet
[1:16:32] start washing
[1:16:33] he won't jerk his feet back
[1:16:36] he enjoys it
[1:16:38] notice what the prophet of God will tell
[1:16:40] us no Jesus don't do things that way no
[1:16:42] no he never pulled his foot back oh he
[1:16:45] sat right still and watched her
[1:16:48] she was doing for him what they've ought
[1:16:52] to done
[1:16:53] now here's a warning to the critics
[1:16:56] and you be careful calling somebody a
[1:17:00] Holy Roller who's doing what you ought
[1:17:02] to have done
[1:17:05] don't you think you're just a little
[1:17:07] better than they are now
[1:17:09] so he's saying don't you be guilty
[1:17:13] of calling somebody a Holy Roller
[1:17:15] criticizing the youth because they get a
[1:17:18] little excitable and they run and they
[1:17:20] dance and they shout when they're moving
[1:17:21] other Spirit goes and sometimes it's in
[1:17:23] the flesh I did not walk up here in my
[1:17:26] spirit I walked out here in my flesh
[1:17:29] so you got to get in the flesh before
[1:17:31] the spirit can come
[1:17:33] so sometimes some of y'all need to get
[1:17:34] in the flesh loosen up those old joints
[1:17:37] a little bit
[1:17:38] so the spirit can come and start
[1:17:40] offering up a god of sacrifice of praise
[1:17:43] he ain't gonna pull his foot back he's
[1:17:45] waiting he's desire to be worshiped he's
[1:17:48] designed your sacrifice of praise she
[1:17:51] knew what others were thinking about her
[1:17:52] but she ignored the critics she ignored
[1:17:55] the Pharisees she ignored everything but
[1:17:57] see the prophet of God say if these big
[1:17:59] starches won't worship God God will pull
[1:18:02] out of you poor people he will get
[1:18:04] somebody to do it he will call Sinners
[1:18:06] and harlots from the streets somebody is
[1:18:09] going to worship God I'm going to tell
[1:18:10] you God will call a backslider back
[1:18:12] tonight he'll call the prodigals back
[1:18:14] tonight he'll call Sinners off the
[1:18:16] street tonight he'll call the waiver
[1:18:18] tonight he'll come the heart and say
[1:18:19] somebody is going to worship God they
[1:18:22] ain't gonna worship because oh I grew up
[1:18:24] in a message church or I grew up in a
[1:18:25] Christian home no they're worshiping
[1:18:27] because they are free
[1:18:29] they were once held by sin they were
[1:18:32] headed to a devil's hell and a sinner's
[1:18:34] grave but almighty God came by and broke
[1:18:37] the Chase and it cleared the dead and
[1:18:40] now they are free
[1:18:46] he said I've seen jumping spells I've
[1:18:49] seen your spells
[1:18:50] but there was nobody hurt
[1:18:54] mountains rung out sun went down
[1:18:58] everything took place
[1:19:00] but there was nobody hurt
[1:19:03] well my goodness
[1:19:05] if ain't nobody getting hurt let's just
[1:19:06] jump in
[1:19:09] we got nothing to worry about right
[1:19:12] notice now I've seen meetings where the
[1:19:14] power of God was revealed to the people
[1:19:16] that they were free from the world the
[1:19:18] things of the world and the joy of the
[1:19:20] Lord filled the congregation they stood
[1:19:23] and they screamed and they cried and
[1:19:25] they shouted to the top of their voice
[1:19:26] for the glory of God I never did see
[1:19:30] anything disorderly
[1:19:33] they was always right in order and hence
[1:19:37] the reason because they had recognized
[1:19:40] that their name that had been written on
[1:19:43] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:19:45] foundation of the world
[1:19:47] I'm afraid to reason some of us ain't
[1:19:49] got no joy we ain't looking over finding
[1:19:51] our name
[1:19:53] come on Church brother Tim's been
[1:19:55] preaching we are the people of the open
[1:19:56] book for hunting Services if you ain't
[1:19:59] looked over and saw your name it's your
[1:20:01] own fault
[1:20:02] John said when I saw my name when that
[1:20:05] book became open he looked over and saw
[1:20:07] his name he said everything in heaven
[1:20:10] everything below everything in this oh
[1:20:12] Hallelujah everything heard I John
[1:20:15] worshiping what because John realized
[1:20:18] that Santa scene was paid he was going
[1:20:20] to hell but he was going to heaven he
[1:20:23] knew he had passed from Death unto life
[1:20:25] and now he was free
[1:20:30] he was not going to be with the
[1:20:32] condemned he was not going to be
[1:20:34] punished for his evil Deeds
[1:20:36] let me tell you that's worth shouting
[1:20:38] about
[1:20:40] that's worth having a feast a
[1:20:42] celebration
[1:20:45] and see John notice I want you to notice
[1:20:47] this I don't know if you've ever noticed
[1:20:48] it maybe you have or not but notice
[1:20:50] where John was
[1:20:52] notice John's
[1:20:54] congregation let me say his audience
[1:20:58] when John got a little liberated
[1:21:01] them joints got loose tongue got loose
[1:21:04] he got filled with simulation because he
[1:21:07] saw his name there
[1:21:09] he saw that the sin that has been
[1:21:10] cleared notice John was so happy
[1:21:15] he didn't just sit quietly
[1:21:19] how some of them want us to do
[1:21:21] we got the revealed word we just need to
[1:21:23] be reverent
[1:21:25] John was sitting or may I say standing
[1:21:29] in the presence of the one who sat on
[1:21:31] the throne
[1:21:33] okay John was also in the presence of a
[1:21:36] strong angel
[1:21:37] John was in the presence of four beasts
[1:21:40] and in the midst of the Four and Twenty
[1:21:42] elders and John was in the presence of a
[1:21:45] lamb who had been slain before the
[1:21:47] foundation of the world if John could
[1:21:49] sit in front of such an audience's act
[1:21:51] and shout and praise God and rejoice
[1:21:54] because now he is free what about even
[1:21:56] tonight Tabernacle what about the bride
[1:21:59] worldwide let me tell you what an
[1:22:01] audience to worship under the Lamb of
[1:22:04] God the one who paid the price the one
[1:22:06] who cleared your debt and said now you
[1:22:08] are free you're no longer held in Chains

[1:23:11] how am I
[1:23:13] and this Vibe refuses to be shamed into
[1:23:18] thinking that her excitement and her
[1:23:21] emotion that comes from the Holy Ghost
[1:23:22] is wrong
[1:23:27] well God don't do those things anymore
[1:23:29] too late

[1:23:39] he works here
[1:23:41] oh we this bride refuses to back up she
[1:23:44] refuses to back down she refuses to be
[1:23:47] she's going to stand with the Lord she's
[1:23:49] going to stand on her stance that he is
[1:23:51] the same yesterday today and forever in
[1:23:54] the same size the same Wonders that he
[1:23:56] did yesterday he's the same God today
[1:23:58] she refuses to back down on preaching
[1:24:01] the full word of God with signs and
[1:24:03] wonders of Miracles following
[1:24:05] she refuses to be in her compromise
[1:24:08] let me just say it like this
[1:24:10] she will preach the message
[1:24:13] she will manifest the fruits of the
[1:24:14] spirit
[1:24:16] she will continue to have prayer lives
[1:24:18] so people can get delivered
[1:24:21] she will continue to have altar calls so
[1:24:23] some sinner can weep their way to
[1:24:25] Calvary they can come to Christ and know
[1:24:27] him and be freed
[1:24:29] from the dead of sin she will worship
[1:24:32] God in the way that they want to call
[1:24:34] heresy she's not worried about it notice
[1:24:37] now she will not be back in bondage
[1:24:40] again
[1:24:41] never again she has received a token do
[1:24:45] you know that slogan never again
[1:24:46] originated a long time ago
[1:24:49] in the it is a poem called Never Again
[1:24:51] shall not fall
[1:24:54] slogan the Jews had never again derived
[1:24:58] from appointment 1927 called Masada see
[1:25:01] the poem is about the siege of Assad and
[1:25:03] which group of Jewish Rebels they held
[1:25:05] out against the Roman armies
[1:25:07] according to the legend and they
[1:25:09] committed mass suicide rather than be
[1:25:12] captured but the slogan re-emerged again
[1:25:15] in the 1940s
[1:25:17] see 1941 to 1945 Nazi German as allies
[1:25:21] murdered about 6 million Jews
[1:25:25] see they tried to implement their final
[1:25:27] solution to the Jewish question
[1:25:30] and the first use of this phrase never
[1:25:32] again in the context of the Holocaust
[1:25:35] was in April 1945 when the newly
[1:25:38] liberated survivors of the back of now
[1:25:40] concentration camp displayed it in
[1:25:43] various languages and handmade signs
[1:25:46] notice six million Jews died at the hand
[1:25:49] of an evil Nazi regime all because of
[1:25:52] their ethnicity because of their
[1:25:54] religious origin their holes were
[1:25:56] stripped away from them all their
[1:25:57] possessions were confiscated and sold
[1:25:59] their guns were taken away or they were
[1:26:01] deceiving and turning over their guns so
[1:26:03] that they didn't have a way to protect
[1:26:05] theirselves their businesses were shut
[1:26:06] down they were forbidden the work they
[1:26:08] were not allowed in education they were
[1:26:10] treated as sub-human creatures they were
[1:26:12] loaded on trains like livestock with 150
[1:26:16] inner cart that should only hold 50 and
[1:26:18] they were shipped across the country
[1:26:20] without food without water without
[1:26:22] proper facilities not even a bucket they
[1:26:24] were sent to ghettos and they lived like
[1:26:26] animals fighting for every scrap of food
[1:26:28] that they could find some men women
[1:26:30] children old young were sent to
[1:26:32] concentration camps to death camps where
[1:26:35] the sooner they arrived they were killed
[1:26:37] immediately some were sent to labor
[1:26:38] camps where they were starved and yet
[1:26:40] forced to work until they died of
[1:26:42] physical exhausted all this was done
[1:26:44] against her will they were lied to they
[1:26:47] were deceived they were murdered they
[1:26:49] were forced by an evil satanic
[1:26:51] denominate a demonomic anointing and
[1:26:53] when those survivors of that
[1:26:55] consultation count were free they vowed
[1:26:57] never again never again will we set
[1:27:01] aside and let our freedoms be stripped
[1:27:03] away from us never again will we have
[1:27:05] slowed down our arms and not have a way
[1:27:07] to fight Never Again Church
[1:27:10] never again well we set us out allow our
[1:27:13] fellow countrymen and die to handle
[1:27:15] their oppressors without putting up a
[1:27:17] fight
[1:27:18] never again will be be put in bondage
[1:27:23] and let me say this tonight Church never
[1:27:25] again will the Church of the Living God
[1:27:27] be denied any promise in the Bible never
[1:27:31] again when she said and stand aside and
[1:27:34] the dead allow the devil to ramrod her
[1:27:36] and strip her her freedom and of her
[1:27:38] rights her rights to the full word of
[1:27:40] God her rights to every promise in the
[1:27:42] Bible her rights to a supernatural
[1:27:44] experience her rights to the baptism of
[1:27:46] the Holy Ghost never again will she set
[1:27:48] aside and watch your own people be
[1:27:50] destroyed by sin by The Vices of the
[1:27:52] enemy while men refuse to preach the
[1:27:54] Bible men refused to preach the gospel
[1:27:56] they refused to have prayer lines they
[1:27:58] refuse to have altar costs never again
[1:28:00] will she sit lifeless and dead and just
[1:28:03] go to some concentration camp without
[1:28:04] putting up a fight we will fight

[1:28:27] total war we ain't come to mess around

[1:28:32] attack

[1:28:37] going to fight for our children we're
[1:28:38] going to fight for healing we're going
[1:28:40] to fight for deliverance we're going to
[1:28:41] fight for Joy we're going to fight for
[1:28:43] peace we're going to fight for the Holy
[1:28:45] Ghost we're going to fight to these old
[1:28:46] bodies of our have been changed and
[1:28:48] we're sitting at the wedding supper of
[1:28:50] the land we will fight Church why
[1:28:54] because we have been made free
[1:29:00] can I go just a little longer
[1:29:04] acts 1 and verse 3. to whom also he
[1:29:07] showed himself alive
[1:29:09] after his Passion by many infallible
[1:29:11] proofs
[1:29:12] being seen in them forty days and
[1:29:13] speaking
[1:29:18] of the things pertaining to the kingdom
[1:29:20] of God and being a symbol together with
[1:29:22] them commanded them that they should not
[1:29:25] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[1:29:27] promise of the father if we saith he you
[1:29:30] have heard of me for John truly baptized
[1:29:32] with water but you shall be baptized
[1:29:35] with the Holy Ghost not many days hence
[1:29:38] now if you go a few scriptures up
[1:29:40] and we realize that Jesus had been with
[1:29:42] him 40 days and he says now I'm leaving
[1:29:45] but I want you to go and Terry in the
[1:29:47] city of Jerusalem until you've been
[1:29:49] endued with power from on high and we
[1:29:51] find in Jude in verse Jude 1 and verse 3
[1:29:54] says now when I gave all diligence to
[1:29:57] right unto you of the common salvation
[1:30:00] it was need for me for me to write unto
[1:30:03] you and to exhort you that you should
[1:30:05] earnestly contend for the faith which
[1:30:08] was once delivered unto the Saints
[1:30:11] notice now let me just show what the
[1:30:13] prophet said Jude was exalting the
[1:30:16] people that they should earnestly
[1:30:18] contend for the faith that was once
[1:30:19] delivered to the Saints and if that was
[1:30:22] being about 30 years after Pentecost
[1:30:26] such a short time and he's encouraged
[1:30:29] him get back to Pentecost come back to
[1:30:31] that same faith and notice they had
[1:30:34] fallen away from the faith in such a in
[1:30:36] such a so much time and he goes now what
[1:30:39] have we done in these 1900 years of all
[1:30:42] kinds of denominations and discrepancies
[1:30:44] and things that slipped into the church
[1:30:45] and caused these things
[1:30:48] so prophet of God will tell us and feast
[1:30:49] on the trumpets he said there will come
[1:30:51] a messenger in the last days will guide
[1:30:54] the people back to the first fruit back
[1:30:56] to the original Faith granted Lord that
[1:30:59] the great messenger Among Us now the
[1:31:01] great Christ the Holy Spirit made Vivid
[1:31:03] made understanding opening the word and
[1:31:06] revealing it to us may he guide them
[1:31:08] back to the original Pentecostal Faith
[1:31:10] like Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[1:31:13] see the original faith is the same faith
[1:31:16] that Judah is telling us to contend for
[1:31:18] he's telling you get back to that Faith
[1:31:20] notice we're not getting back to Azusa
[1:31:23] Pentecost that's not the faith we're
[1:31:25] being exhorted to get back to but we're
[1:31:27] exhorted to get back to the original
[1:31:28] Pentecostal faith and you can't have the
[1:31:31] original Pentecostal Faith with having
[1:31:33] the original Pentecostal experience
[1:31:35] which is the first fruits you got to
[1:31:37] have the Holy Ghost what is the
[1:31:39] Pentecostal experience it's to
[1:31:40] experience of freedom
[1:31:44] you've experienced freedom
[1:31:47] and he's accepted your worship he's
[1:31:51] accepted your life and he has sealed you
[1:31:54] until the day of your Redemption
[1:31:56] so we find that when they went to the
[1:31:58] upper room some how many of you ever
[1:31:59] thought about those that are in the
[1:32:00] upper man they were some Supernatural
[1:32:02] people you ever think about that
[1:32:05] man they must have been something else
[1:32:06] Peter James John Mary all these
[1:32:10] different ones man people that we just
[1:32:11] we put them up here we think man they
[1:32:13] had no problems but they went in the
[1:32:15] upper room just like you and I
[1:32:17] they were men and women just like you
[1:32:19] and I noticed they were not perfect
[1:32:23] news flash neither are you and I
[1:32:26] they had their own set of failures their
[1:32:27] own set of struggles they wrestle with
[1:32:29] certain things they were fighting the
[1:32:31] greatest battle that was ever fought
[1:32:33] just like you and I
[1:32:36] they went in some of them were afraid of
[1:32:38] the Romans some of them were afraid of
[1:32:39] religious leaders they were in bondage
[1:32:41] to the Romans I'm afraid that the
[1:32:43] slightest infraction they'd be put to
[1:32:45] death or they were afraid of the Romans
[1:32:47] or the Jews because or the the Pharisees
[1:32:49] and the Sadducees in the law of Moses
[1:32:51] because they were afraid if they one
[1:32:53] slide infraction they'd be stoned or
[1:32:54] that'd be this or they'd be that but
[1:32:56] notice when Jesus said go into the upper
[1:32:58] room or the city there and being due
[1:33:00] with power from on high they waited and
[1:33:03] they waited and they waited they didn't
[1:33:04] get hurt because he didn't show up they
[1:33:06] didn't get mad because he didn't show up
[1:33:08] they didn't get disgruntled because he
[1:33:09] didn't show up they came in there with
[1:33:11] all their failures they came in there
[1:33:12] with all their baggage they came in
[1:33:14] there with all their hurts they came in
[1:33:15] there with all their grudges they came
[1:33:17] in there with all their bitters but they
[1:33:18] waited until the 50th day until the day
[1:33:21] of Pentacles fully came and when the day
[1:33:24] of Pentecost fully came what did he do
[1:33:26] that came a sound like a rushing Mighty
[1:33:28] Wind and they come out stumbling out
[1:33:30] looked like they had been drunk
[1:33:34] they come out so drunk on the spirit of
[1:33:38] God see the photos of Pentecost came
[1:33:40] there came such a sound such a mighty
[1:33:42] winds tongues of fire the people come
[1:33:45] stumbling out of the upper room no
[1:33:47] longer in bondage
[1:33:49] no longer worried about the Romans no
[1:33:52] longer worried about the Pharisees the
[1:33:54] Sadducees or who see or who didn't see
[1:33:56] they wasn't worried about it they got
[1:33:59] drunk on the spirit and didn't care what
[1:34:01] others thought they didn't care what
[1:34:03] others did they didn't care you know
[1:34:05] what it'll do us a good good to do up
[1:34:07] some good if we just get drunk every

[1:39:33] and what they did they knew on a certain
[1:39:35] day that they were going to be declared
[1:39:37] free and so the strongest of them
[1:39:39] brother Aaron climbed to the top of the
[1:39:41] mountain

[1:40:08] about to be declared free and the
[1:40:10] strongest of them will come to the top
[1:40:12] of the mountain and they waited all
[1:40:15] night long they waited with anticipation
[1:40:17] they waited with the excitement they
[1:40:19] waited because they knew when that light
[1:40:21] broke down Eastern Sky there they knew
[1:40:23] that they were declared free and all of
[1:40:25] a sudden the sun asks you in Rose early
[1:40:28] in the morning I'm going to tell you and
[1:40:30] they begin to shout down we're free
[1:40:32] oh we're free we're free until they got

[1:40:37] and all the little kids all of them were
[1:40:39] free church I'm going to tell you God
[1:40:41] sent a prophet in this day and he
[1:40:42] climbed up to the mountain and it began
[1:40:44] to call to scream back at you you're
[1:40:47] free and the teachers took that message
[1:40:49] and they said you're free and the
[1:40:51] bankers took that message and they said
[1:40:53] you're free and the pastors took that
[1:40:55] message and they said you're free what

[1:41:19] I could go on I got so much here but we
[1:41:22] got to be mindful
[1:41:27] I was looking at this
[1:41:38] I was looking at this
[1:41:39] and it came to my attention I was
[1:41:42] praying this isn't works his face
[1:41:44] expressed brother bear said I dreamed
[1:41:46] that I seen a man a young fellow in
[1:41:48] shackles
[1:41:50] and he was trying to get out
[1:41:52] and I said somebody told me sis those
[1:41:55] are horrible people
[1:41:57] don't have nothing to do with them
[1:42:00] and I've seen this young fella getting
[1:42:02] out of his shackles so I just let him
[1:42:04] alone I want you to pay attention to how
[1:42:07] he words all this and I thought and I
[1:42:09] said I'll just see what he does
[1:42:12] and so or he says so when he got out he
[1:42:15] was a nice fella
[1:42:18] and he goes and I've seen others
[1:42:21] trying to get out
[1:42:23] see they were held
[1:42:25] they were held in bondage against their
[1:42:27] will
[1:42:28] they didn't know any better
[1:42:30] but they had been chained
[1:42:33] they've been Shackled In
[1:42:35] but yet this young fella wanted to get
[1:42:38] out of his shackles and they got out of
[1:42:40] his shackles
[1:42:42] I could think of few people right now
[1:42:45] Let's cross this country right now that
[1:42:46] are getting out of shackles brother Tim
[1:42:49] and you find out they're really good
[1:42:51] people
[1:42:53] really good people and I hope you're
[1:42:55] listening tonight
[1:42:57] then he says I've seen others trying to
[1:42:59] get out
[1:43:00] he goes if someone pulled me away
[1:43:03] and I looked and it was a lady standing
[1:43:05] over here when I was a little boy and I
[1:43:07] used to haul groceries for at the from
[1:43:09] the grocery store to the to the peoples
[1:43:11] and she said brother Branham Deliver Us
[1:43:14] from this
[1:43:15] this was a house of hell
[1:43:18] and said you've been misunderstood and
[1:43:21] you're and you've misunderstood these
[1:43:23] people
[1:43:24] these are fine people and he goes and I
[1:43:27] looked over like a great big seller big
[1:43:29] walls down beneath the great big cave
[1:43:32] and great iron bars eight to ten inches
[1:43:34] thick let me read that again notice the
[1:43:38] bondage
[1:43:40] it's next to impossible to escape
[1:43:45] great big seller big walls down beneath
[1:43:49] the great big cave and great iron bars
[1:43:52] eight to ten inches thick people out of
[1:43:55] their minds Twisted arms and legs
[1:43:57] beating their heads like that and she
[1:44:00] was crying saying deliver the people
[1:44:02] brother branna
[1:44:04] and said help us we're in trouble notice
[1:44:08] now and he said she herself I know her
[1:44:10] she I believe
[1:44:12] she belongs I believe to the Church of
[1:44:14] Christ or the Christian church
[1:44:17] so what did the Church of Christ believe
[1:44:19] no emotion
[1:44:21] no excitement
[1:44:23] days of Miracles has passed
[1:44:25] be very reverent in church
[1:44:27] can't do this can't do that can't do
[1:44:29] this can't do that held in bondage
[1:44:33] held in bondage but people
[1:44:36] are wanting to be free
[1:44:39] people don't want to be held into that
[1:44:42] situation where they can't express the
[1:44:44] Liberties wherein crisis made them free
[1:44:46] you can't do this and he said they're
[1:44:48] going out of their minds Twisted arms
[1:44:51] and twisted legs beating their heads
[1:44:54] wanting something different
[1:44:56] wanting to be free
[1:45:03] he goes and I looked and they were
[1:45:04] beating their head like that way out or
[1:45:06] like that out of their mind he goes and
[1:45:09] then I seen the lights flicker around in
[1:45:11] there
[1:45:12] oh and I looked up and there stood the
[1:45:14] Lord Jesus with the lights of the
[1:45:16] rainbow around him and he was looking
[1:45:17] right straight at me delivered those
[1:45:20] people and he went away
[1:45:22] and I thought well how could I deliver
[1:45:23] and I haven't got to strength enough of
[1:45:25] my arms to break those bars so I said
[1:45:27] House of Hell give way to the name of
[1:45:30] Jesus
[1:45:32] and all the cracking and popping and the
[1:45:34] Rocks rolling and the bars are falling
[1:45:36] and the people screaming delivered and
[1:45:39] screaming at the top of their voice and
[1:45:41] was all
[1:45:45] see what we've witnessed in our day
[1:45:47] church is some flickers of light
[1:45:51] filters of light the Holy Ghost once
[1:45:53] again vindicating himself the same
[1:45:55] yesterday today and forever the light of
[1:45:59] Truth is flickering in the ministry of
[1:46:00] God called men
[1:46:02] and the same Lord Jesus is compelling
[1:46:05] the ministry today deliver the
[1:46:09] deliver the
[1:46:10] deliver
[1:46:12] the people and I'm so thankful tonight
[1:46:14] that there is Anointed men on the field
[1:46:17] who remain faithful to the word of God
[1:46:19] and to this message and they preach
[1:46:22] Freedom they preach Deliverance they
[1:46:24] preach the infallible word of God men
[1:46:27] who are not injecting their own ideas or
[1:46:29] own beliefs but they're staying with
[1:46:31] what the prophet said they're
[1:46:32] proclaiming in the face of the prison
[1:46:34] bars they're proclaiming in the face of
[1:46:36] man's ideas and man's interpretation of
[1:46:38] the word in the face of false doctors in
[1:46:41] the face of the false anointed ones that
[1:46:43] we have returned to Pentecost
[1:46:46] and we are determined to be free
[1:46:50] and I say House of Hell give way
[1:46:53] give way to the name of Jesus the name
[1:46:57] that's greater than all names and at the
[1:46:59] very mention of that name every Spirit
[1:47:02] has to Bow home to musicians to come
[1:47:06] see it's a feast of Freedom what does it
[1:47:08] do what does the Feast of Freedom do for
[1:47:10] a man it reminds him
[1:47:12] that you're not an angel
[1:47:16] it's a memorial
[1:47:18] is established in the word that you are
[1:47:22] free
[1:47:24] it liberates him from error it breaks to
[1:47:27] hold that false teaching and incorrect
[1:47:30] teaching has on them it frees him to
[1:47:32] worship
[1:47:34] it frees him to rejoice
[1:47:37] it frees him to shout and give a
[1:47:40] response to the word
[1:47:42] it gives him a dance it gives him
[1:47:44] victory over all his enemies
