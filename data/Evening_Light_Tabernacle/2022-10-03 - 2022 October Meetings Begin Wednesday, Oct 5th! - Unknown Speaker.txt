TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he said I'll tell you what I'll take I'll take your spirit because that was a I believe it was a spear amen it was a tribal ceremony spear that all the tribes in the area knew belonged to that King so he said I'll take that and the prophet of God explains it he said what is what his thoughts was is it seemed like he could have greater things but he knew that that would be life to him see see I'm paraphrasing but that would be life to him in other words if he had that spear whenever he come toward a tribe and they started running at him all he had to do was hold up that Spear and they would have to back away all you had to do was hold it up and they would recognize he's got the king's message he's representing somebody greater than him and you hear me and today God has put a message in our hands amen that here we are amen is Satan's Eden and the devil's like a roaring line he ain't lost none of his power he's as powerful as he ever was but God has put something in your hand he's put something in your hand that Satan has to power every time he hears the name of Jesus Christ in Daniel chapter 10 when the Bible tells us that the Prince of Persia had blocked and he tried to stop the angel from getting and Daniel had prayed for 21 days and the Angel's word says I am come for thy words he's coming for the words of Tim Pruitt he's coming for the words of Ron Spitzer he's coming for the word of the body of Jesus Christ it is not a time to set back it's a time to speak speak to that mountain speak to that situation speak to that circumstance come for thy words hear us maybe some people just here for the first time getting among this kind of worship and power and they're saying I wonder what all this is I'll tell you what this is this is that your whole life wondered what that is this is that you like that when it's in the Bible but how do you like this I love it brother what is it it's the it's the Revival of the Bride people say it's coming for years but here it is don't miss it don't miss your opportunity don't miss the greatest days of your life [Applause] [Music] find it very interesting that she's writing that song same time I'm getting this message I think God's speaking to us if if he could have he would have stopped us
