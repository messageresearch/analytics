what he's doing how many believes that when he died he died for you amen well that's what he wants to be known today is is a personal God Amen God bless you brother Matthew welcome home amen good to see you today and each one of you that are here assembled with us I hope nobody feels to be a visitor but that you just feel a part of us some of them already coming in for the wedding next weekend so we got um sister Sandy here God bless you and and uh my just a great time that we'll have together I know as we see um one of our one of our family members here just United in holy matrimony amen and it's not in your maybe physical family our church family if you turn with me to Ephesians chapter 6 we want to read from verse 10 this morning Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 these subjects are very dear to my heart so I want you to keep in mind that we've been speaking on being Mountain movers so you know taking it from Zachariah said who art thou oh great Mountain Thou shalt become a plane and The Headstone shall be brought forth with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it how many believes in the favor of God his grace that is so great on our lives Ephesians 61 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers and against the rulers of the darkness of this World against spiritual wickedness in high places now this this is actually actually in the King James will use this word high in the place of heavenly which it uses in Ephesians chapter 1 we will read that a little later in the sermon so it's actually saying that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in Heavenly places that's very interesting we want to look at this today as we as we focus in on the word now verse 13 says for you to take the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore if you'll look with me to Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one we'll just back up a couple of chapters as Paul deals with the Ephesian church and and it says and you hath he Quicken which is resurrected every every person who is Born Again of the spirit of God or spiritually resurrected or You're Made Alive who were dead that's your condition as being a sinner being in Lost in sin you were dead in sins and trespasses and wherein in time pass you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we had our conversation that word is um is used by the King James but it's um it's it really means conduct the way we had our conduct in times past of the lust of in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of wrath even as others God bless you you can be seated may he bless his word this morning we're going to be speaking today on on adopted Sons conquerors of the air now we we've seen in the scripture here that the Apostle Paul describes Satan first as a prince with power because he has authentic power in the world and then we we also know that in in 1 John 5:19 that John tells us we know we are from God and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one or the whole world Li in wickedness or in the power of the wicked one or the evil one so this is a condition that the world is in today and of course those that are redeemed have been redeemed and bought by God and purchased by his blood and brought out of the power of darkness and they are children of the light now if we notice of Satan um many times we we think of him as we see him in nature we see him stir up the the atmospheres above and he will cause winds and tornadoes and horrible storms now you know your insurance companies and others will to tell you that's an act of God but it's not an act of God it is an act of the devil and he stirs up the storms the winds um of Nature and he will even attack your own human nature and he will disturb our human nature and bring storms in our lives and and uh storms in our families and disturb our human nature and of course this will be by every kind of satanic attack which would be maybe up on our health or maybe uh in our mind whether there be spirits of insanity or which are spirits of Darkness but um not only that but but as the whole world lays in the power of the evil one we know that he owns the kingdoms of the world and even among nations he will stir up chaos and strife and he causes great suffering all over the world and uh and of course A lot of times people will will wonder um why does God allow the devil to do this well God made everything perfect he made everything where there was no sin there was no sorrow there was no never to be a grave on the earth it was it was to be Heaven on the earth and he gave Dominion of the earth to his son Adam and placed him in the garden and he was to he was to spread his domain from sea to Sea where the whole Earth would be covered with the glory of the Lord as the psalmist David said so this is always God's plan and ultimately that is God's plan he will again rule the Earth and not only just for the millennial reign of a thousand years but also he will make all things new he will he will make a new heavens and a new Earth where there will only dwell righteousness and there will there of course in that new Heavens new Earth there will never be a grave um to be turned over in that sod there will never be sickness there won't be hospitals the scientific Realms that we know today where man is trying to um do what he can to help um other mankind that well all of that will not be needed because it will be perfect peace perfect Joy perfect love permeating and an atmosphere of godliness all over the Earth even so much that the lion will lay down by the lamb and nothing will hurt or destroy as he says in all of my Holy Mountain but you see uh Satan right now owns the kingdoms of the world and and I'll just show you in Luke 4:4 that the devil took Jesus up a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and and the devil said unto him all this power I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered to me and to whomsoever I will give it so if you notice here um that he offers Jesus the kingdoms of the world because he owns the kingdoms of this world right now the Earth is not under God 's kingship but it's it's under the prince of the power of the air and how did he get this because he says as if you'll keep my scripture up a minute because he says all this power I will give thee and the glory of them because that is g delivered unto me so if you notice here um it's delivered to him because because man was given this power over the air over the atmosphere he he was he was to bring Heaven down upon the Earth and on the Earth would only be righteousness and peace and joy but when he sold himself out to sin and and became subservient to the devil then Satan took lordship over the the heart of man that's why it's important for salvation for you to re to reject the lordship of Satan and receive the lordship of Christ you see that he is your lord he because he is king of saints but right now he's not king of the world but he is coming as Revelation 19 shows him coming as the word of God and as he rides out the heaven symbolically on white horses and the Saints with him and he is king of kings and Lord of lords and and the armies of Heaven follow him and they're coming to take the world back over again so all of this is shown in the scripture and so it's only for a time that Satan has this rule over the Earth he as we have said is a temporary being he's not Eternal he he has an expiration date also everything that he brings whether it's sickness or whether it's sorrow or trouble or even death itself it all has an expiration date now so if we think of this Satan is the prince of the power of the air Jesus would acknowledge Him being the prince of this world and he said that it was now his time for the power of Darkness to rain and we're still in the time where the power of Darkness Reigns over the world in which we live that's why the evil is there that's why the the sickness the sin is there is because the power of the Prince of Darkness Reigns and he controls the air the atmospheres all around and he brings hate and envy and strife and and all the other awful works of the Flesh and he and he manifests himself and and Exhibits that as he takes himself over human beings to live in and work in that will do his bidding and and so the Bible says that he is the ruler or the uh the prin of the power of the air the NIV says it this way the rulers of the kingdoms of the air so his ugly Spirit controls the atmospheres of this Earth and he will even try to to rule the atmosphere of your flesh and even he'll even try to rule the atmosphere of the church he'll come right into a meeting to try to control the atmosphere to bring it under his power to keep it subdued to keep the worship of the true God to from entering in and the praise to be received up into the presence of God he will do everything he can to ward off the blessings of God to keep prayers from being answered to keep your faith in in a a low and and and and held down by unbelief because he knows as as long as your faith is bound by some unbelief by a spirit of Darkness then then you are powerless and he is able then to do whatever he wants to and he can run rampid over the children of God no matter how powerful the word is no matter how great it is no matter how Deliverance is in the word of God it is a sword but it has to be held by the hand of faith and if he can talk you out of of your faith of your using your weapon Amen to keep you from using the word of God against him you see then he can control the atmosphere of the church he can control the atmosphere of your life he can control the atmosphere of your family of your home of the of the world that we live in now from this position he will torment our bodies and bring accusations against us you see is a Tormentor that's what devil means he's a Tormentor Satan Satan has the power to bring sickness amen you see as as as Jesus said about a woman that was released from her prison House of Affliction being bound and crippled and and he says he said should not this daughter of this woman being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan is bound he 18 years be loose from this Bond on the Sabbath day because they were too worried about you know their their religious ceremony than they were about a someone who was bound for 18 years being delivered amen sometimes I wonder if we get too worried about our Theology and you know getting everything right and and the ever eye dotted and every tea crossed exactly perfectly we get too concerned even about church orders amen against all of these is too concerned about all these things until we forget our real purpose is to find that those that are bound those that are afflicted those that are tormented to find their Deliverance In The House of the Living God Amen this is what God has raised up a church for amen is to take dominion over Satan's kingdom to clear the air between The Sinner and God where that God can come down and flow in their lives and live his life through them instead of satanic Powers controlling them now as we think of this we also see Paul would talk about it being a thorn and we remember when man fell he talked about his sickness or whatever it was a messenger Satan that buffeted me you know and and he said so there was given me a thorn in the flesh I he he was he was permitted lest I be exalted lest that I become hearty in myself he says then then he said it was permitted down permission was given for a messenger of Satan to buff at me and it become a thorn in his flesh now I want you to understand this is exactly where that when man fell not only did the world fall not but all the kingdoms of the world fell all of the animal kingdom fell everything went into chaos Heaven became elusive Eden became lifted and and and become a mysterious place out of the reach of man and now man is living on the earth without heaven without the power of God without his faith being active without the the ability to control the World by the word of God so now all of this was happening in the world because man fell now I want you to understand the Bible said now to to him now your body you will bear the soil the Earth will bear thorns and thistles and remember yes of course nature itself rebelled against him where he earned his bread by the sweat of the brow now not operating in Dominion that he once operate but now now he he has got Thorns growing in his own body sickness comes and attacks him disease comes in and no matter who we are today we are subject to that because these flesh are mortal they are no longer Immortal when Adam was made he was made an immortal man but he gave up his immortality D to come under the Dominion of Satan and when death entered in hear the power of death had came into his had power over him and the Bible said in Hebrews 2:14 he said his children are partakers of the flesh and blood so he likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil so you see Satan has the power of death how did he bring that power how was he given that power he was given that power when man becomes subservient to him when man surrendered the kingdom to him now so he is the prince of the power of the air meaning the atmosphere the air refers to the invisible but the it's a supernatural realm that is upon and above the Earth where Satan and his demons move and exist now it is this position this place that Adam ruled this Kingdom this was man's Dominion amen this is I I want you to know man was made to have control over dominion over the fish of the sea the foul of the air he was have dominion over the Earth he was able to bring Heaven's atmosphere down upon the earth and the love of God permeate everything and if you don't know what the love of God is it is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost would reign supreme and there animals did not kill each other men did not hate or fight there was no death no sorrow no fear no worry it was all perfect love remember that's God's basic nature he God is love and where God Reigns love Reigns now here he was brought Heaven's atmosphere of peace love joy into Eden and now when he becomes subservient to Satan and now Satan is the prince yeah he brings chaos sin destruction evil and the whole world is in a fallen condition and all of us come into this world needing a new birth cuz we were all born wrong so we would have to be born again now even now our battle your battle this morning is for dominion over atmospheres you your battle this morning is a is a battle over the air a battle over atmospheres now it is our position it is our Throne meaning our domain as sons of of God in the heavens position us with Christ it is there that Satan attacks our faith with within the the the atmosphere to change the the atmosphere of Faith to one of Doubt knowing I requ request and our petitions can only be received by God when we believe remember if thou can't believe all things are possible amen but nothing is possible with doubt that's doubt removes us from our sunship position and we lose our Authority and I I want you to understand this this this is war amen This Is War this is where we're at we're in a battle for atmospheres amen and as adopted Sons we are to be we are to be conquerors of the atmosphere conquerors of the air now so 2 Corinthians 10:3 says though we walk in the flesh we do not war according to the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not of flesh but have divine power to destroy stronghold they are Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds so you see they're not carnal But Mighty through God or they're they're they're not of the flesh but have divine power to pull down strongholds you know now Satan does this with arguments with reasoning with Wars against our mind doing everything to change our atmosphere from one of Faith to doubt to fear to failure and I I want you to know as a son or daughter of God you're not to be a people controlled by fear amen perfect love that's the Holy Ghost will cast out fear fear has torment so fear is of the devil that's right amen so God has not given us a a mind of fear but a disciplined mind a mind that is controlled by the Holy Spirit to believe what God's word said about us now Satan's tireless goal in the life of every Christian is to prevent disrupt cut off relationship with God this is what he does even this morning I don't care how great a Christian you are Satan is trying to disrupt your relationship with God he's trying to cut it off if he can do it by getting some doubt by bringing some accusation by allow by you allowing some fear to control you instead of Faith he will cut off your relationship with God and he prows the Bible said Peter said it around like a roaring line and he's looking for someone to to devour that's right so he's looking all the time and his only real power oh Believers is to throw sins and transgress transgresses transgressions in our faces that's his only real power it just just remind you of your failures remind you of your Humanity remind you of your faults remind you of of of where you didn't overcome or where you're still lacking some where because if he can get you to look at your lack instead of God's provision he has you defeated amen but if you will look away to Jesus this morning you will see yourself in the light of God's glory as a redeemed child of God a son of the Living God bur by the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed by his blood you see Satan knows if the people get the true revelation of that True Blood wash church and what she is and how she how she isn't right standing before God and I want you to understand it isn't because you've always done everything right that's amen it ain't because you never made a mistake you you he has he has plenty things that are real he don't even have to make it up he don't even have to lie against you though he will he will lie against you but he don't have to even make it up you've done enough wrong Amen to die a million deaths in hell every one of us have fallen short not one of us not one of us would be with without the blood of Christ could be perfect and without blemish amen but listen we stand before God Amen why they overcame him Revelation 12 says they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb this is our overcoming power amen is the blood nothing can stand before that blood no sin can stand before that blood no habit no devil no demon power can stand before the blood of Jesus so she stands before God when she can get that revelation of that she's Blood Washed and she stands perfect before God Amen and By and By by confessing his word by testifying what he said by staying true to his word and she can do the Greater Works it is then she'll be an invincible army they can get the true revelation of of of the two spirits that are within the framework of the Christian Church each trying to bring its atmosphere you see both spirit Spirits are at work here God trying to bring the atmosphere of love and faith amen of consolation a purity of righteousness and here the devil is over here trying to bring confusion and chaos and doubt and unbelief and a sense of unworthiness I I just want to tell you right now forget your unworthiness you are you can never be worthy but I want you to know because of the great price that Jesus Paid where he traded his righteousness for your sins then because of his righteousness you are can walk in white and you are worthy Hallelujah this is where he said in the Book of Revelation they walk before me and white and they are worthy well I'm not worthy to receive healing no not on your old flesh but as a as a born again son of daughter of God Amen it is your right it is your inheritance it is your privilege it is your sunship your access to father now but Satan is the accuser but we have to withstand him because it's only when we withstand him as sons of God that we that we that Satan will be powerless before us now as the accuser he comes over and over again and he will accuse to the day of the Rapture amen but thankfully the sacrifice of Christ has effectively dealt with the problem it's the blood of Jesus the blood of the Lamb that redeemed people setting them free from the slavery to sin and of Satan's control yet he attacks our faith our faith is our confidence our trust in the blood pointing out our lack our failures and reasoning against our faith attempting to turn hope into hopelessness for you to give up and to quit now Satan knows when the air is cleared between us us and God when nothing is between no doubting no wavering but steadfast believing then that's where mountains move that's where Red Seas open that's where sickness is healed that's where miracles happen amen when the air gets cleared between you and God nothing between no doubting no fear no unbelief amen but just where the Holy Spirit can Ascend and descend upon you where the spirit of God can come and anoint his word and make it real amen that's where Red Seas will open that's where mountains will move that's where every sickness has to bow to the name of Jesus that's where miracles happen now Paul brings a message to the mature Church of the Ephesians these were the adopted sons who he was placing firmly in their inheritance now I want you to get the thought now for a moment not adopted like adopting somebody else's kids as your own but no it goes this word adoption Paul is using is one on the old Roman custom of taking even your own son when he came to age and placing him putting the ring on his finger putting the putting the robe of Honor upon him giving him a name and authority over over the whole Kingdom and this is exactly what God is doing in this last day he is placing Sons putting a ring on their finger putting the Holy Ghost around them the robe of his righteousness is somebody with me amen dressing them honoring them naming them Hallelujah put him there making sure everybody knows this is my son whatever he says that's I back it up amen whatever he binds is bound whatever he looses is loosed amen Place Sons people who know their God and do exploits now let's go to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 we'll read from verse three if you will we're going to just search the scripture and let's just look at him where he places the Believers now of course Ephesians 1:1 says he speaks to the Saints which are in Ephesus so he is addressing Saints so in verse three he said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all not some all spiritual blessings where where do our blessings lie in Heavenly places according as he is chosen Us in him when down at the altar when we join the church when when we found out we we were sons of God and we born again no before the foundation of the world and one thing about this God when he chose you he cannot unchoose you hallelujah amen you were his before the world began you never ever originally belong to the devil I'm glad for that amen you might have been controlled here for a while while you was here in sin but you never truly belonged to the devil you were God's before the world began he chose you in Christ before the foundational world and what did he choose you to be fearful afraid unbelieving doubting sick helpless depraved lost confused no he chose you to be holy you wasn't holy but he chose you to be holy and I tell you if God has chose you for Holiness you're going to be everything he said amen if he chose you for Holiness and to be without what blame oh brother Tim the devil told me didn't say before the devil so and so said didn't say about your friends before him and he's the only one that counts you were chosen to be holy and Without Blame where before him in love oh my this looks like the air is cleared amen nothing between my God and my my my savior amen nothing between us the air is cleared I'm blameless before him I'm holy before him amen because he chose me Tri be that having predestinated us to the placing the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will so he pray destinated us to this this calling right here here's this the good pleasure his good pleasure his good pleasure he places you to be holy Without Blame before him in love to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us EX accepted in the Beloved Hallelujah Christ is saying right here you are accepted amen he throws a welcome M at amen he he he puts puts it out he he bids you welcome or as a king he holds the scepter out come on into my presence you have been accepted in the Beloved and I chose you to be holy that's right I chose you without to be without blame Hallelujah I'm going to have a bride of people without a spot without a rle without a blemish without any such thing they're going to be in my image they're going to be in my likeness I chose them to be this I have predestinated this is their Destiny I have predetermined their Destiny to be all of this that I said because of my love so well I'm not all that yet brother Tim just realize where your destiny is he chose this Destiny for now our predestination places us as The Offspring dust the HS of God and join HS with Jesus Christ in order that we might have all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places and and all spiritual blessings we are chosen predestinated adopted lavished with Grace redeemed sealed forgiven amen not only that but perfect cuz he said without I blame where in his sight Hallelujah every one of you that have accepted the blood of Jesus been cleansed by the blood that's how you stand this morning that's perfect in his sight well one day brother J we're all going to be perfect we're not even talking about your flesh amen your your flesh your flesh we war against it every day bring it into subjection but remember the essence of the message that is given in this last day is truly another Ephesians to place us as sons and hirs of all things and by the word we have received by the handing us the unsealed book it places us as sons and we are commissioned in to act to speak to rule instead upon the Earth until he comes amen the Bible said he had made us under our Gods Kings and Priests you cannot be a king without having a domain and if you're a priest you have the right of intercession that whatever you ask his name he will do it now Paul prays in Ephesians chapter 1 17 he prays that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and the Revelation and the knowledge of him now you're talking about here the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him listen this is changing atmospheres given you not the spirit of Brokenness of Sorrow depression come on but the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him changing your atmosphere the eyes of your understanding being enlightened amen this is what God's trying to do even get a message to you today you are to be rulers of the atmosphere of your life amen realize here I'm in right standing with God here's what the blood has done for me look the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints so you see this this is what the first age messenger Paul and the last Messenger to Leo deia both want you to know they want you to know you're rich inheritance they want you to know the hope of your calling your identity in Christ what he have made you amen now under the law we could only be servants we were slaves amen even though potentially we were Sons we were slaves we were we were slaves to sin we were slaves even under the law but under grace we are born Sons Acts 17:28 says for in him we live and move for we are also his offspring so we are The Offspring of God now so here the the Glorious riches that there are to God as his sons that that you're valuable God wants to you to know you are valuable that you are worthy amen that and that the power that God wants you to know the power that is at work at work in you amen notice not just any power not just a little bit of power but definitely not your human power and ability that's all limited but in verse 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believes according to the working of his mighty power what's his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places now Christ did this as a man come on he put aside his godship to come and be a man to walk as a man to suffer as a man to suffer like we suffer to to be tempted like we're tempted somebody help me preach this is exactly the way God came in Christ right he laid aside his robes left the left all the heaven to come down to earth oh think of it his work is to intercede until all men are exalted to Heavenly places to positions of sunship you know and I want you to get it now this this place don't don't think of oh somewhere outer space or some way past the moon some way past the Stars don't think of it like that think of it like this that he set us in a position Heavenly position as a son as a daughter of God here upon the Earth in the position of sunship this is this is what he came to do exalt you to Heavenly places to position of authority far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in the world to come and it put all things where under his feet under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all so if you put all things under his feet and his body is a church he has placed all things under your Dominion hallelujah amen oh yes oh yeah that cloud that's been over you this week that depression that's been bothering you amen those spirits of the enemy that just says end it all those those spirits that says you you're you're not a child of God you don't belong to God you putting fear in your life because of some little infraction or some little problem or whatever let me tell you clear the air amen if there if there's something between you and God this morning clear the air say oh God I don't want nothing between me and you amen today I'm taking Dominion dominion over everything of the flesh over all sin over the spirit of Darkness I'm taking Dominion as a son who you love as a child you gave your life for the Bible tells us in in Romans 8:16 the spirit that's the Holy Spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God he's witnessing to you over and over and over again you're a child of God you're a child of God you're a child of God if I'm a Child of God then everything he has is for me healing is for me Deliverance is for me salvation is for me it's for my children it's for my family amen come on Amen watch it Bears witness we are the children of God and if we're children here it is if we're Sons we're daughters if we're children then HS hes of God and join AES with Christ is so that if we suffer with him we may also be glorified together now let me just quote to you from a sermon of um God perfect in his church the Pentecostals that receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that makes them a part fellowship and relationship with God that's born again and a son and daughter of God tell them out of the Bible and they'll believe it there's our sunship at work tell them something out of the Bible they'll believe it hey amen and the thing of it is though they forget who they are they think well I I don't know well brother you this morning again are Sons and Daughters of God co-equal With Jesus Christ in his presence oh my that's what makes the devil angry is Let the Church of God realize who they are my my my you're the you're the great Church of the Living God and you claim to kiss the blessings off the rim of the cup he said I wonder wonder if God could ever take the gospel and Shake you to a place do you realize who you are and the rights you have the god-given Privileges amen Satan doesn't have a right of nothing that's he is only a bluff let me say it again Satan has no right of nothing he is only a bluff that's right he was stripped of everything he had at Calvary when Jesus has taken the sinner's place and died at Calvary and Satan has no legal right over nothing anymore but everything lays in the hands of the church the believer Satan's lost he's nothing but a bluff oh brother Timmy he's a prince listen he his power over atmosphere is only through accusations on he has no real power over any child of God he has no legal rights No More Everything lays in the hands of the church he is nothing but a bluff amen I hope you're made of stuff that won't Bluff I hope you're made of something this morning say says listen I'm not going to take the devil's lies anymore I and we come on come on look look here in this mirror is this a mirror amen the Bible said that to hold up the word of God is a mirror whereby your chains by gazing up on it you are changed from glory to glory you ever look in the mirror and wish you could change it some of you put hair on your head some of you take the wrinkles off off you just hold up that mirror but that ain't the way this works you look in this mirror and you gaze upon it until you are changed till you match what's in the mirror come on he changes you from glory to glory oh if I could get you to look and gaze upon Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was on him and with his stripes we were healed amen if I can get you to Gaze on the word of God and don't look anywhere else don't hear a voice look this way or that way keep your eyes on Jesus when you get your eyes on how old you are or how sick you are how long you've been sick or how much problems you had and you get your eyes on that get your eyes suffer Jesus that's when you will drowned that's when you will fall but if you'll scream out oh God I perish he'll take you by the hand and make you walk on your Waters hallelujah amen Satan is nothing but a bluff now Paul said we wrestle not against flesh and blood so our fight isn't in the physical it's spiritual it's against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers of this present Darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in high places Heavenly places so you know it was like in the days of job God would say to Satan where you been he said from going up go to and fro in the earth walking up and down on it now remember the Earth was not created for the Devil the Earth was created for us it was for our pleasure it was for us to live on you say well one day we're going to go away to heaven and we won't need this Earth anymore no that ain't scripture Heaven is only a temporary place that we go to until the last one is redeemed and then we come back on the earth is that right for the great Millennial Reign then we're caught up onto the Breath of Heaven for a bit while the Earth is purged and will will will come do not rule and reign with Christ a thousand years but there will be no end that's right to the rule of God on the earth with God and his bride will rule upon this Earth but right now the battle is over your Earth and his only weapon is to reason against God to accuse God and accuse you listen this accuser he's bold he'll stand right in the face of God and call him a liar he'll stand right there in the face of God and and say yeah job and accuse job and say hey he only serves God for a reason because you put a hedge around him but I tell you let me let me touch him let me touch his possessions he'll deny you then he comes again and and he said well you know a man to do anything for his skin let me touch his flesh you see there again he comes to accuse he accuse God of of lying he he accuse God of of even being deceitful he will accuse God even before God's children he said to Eve he said you want you know God really is lying to you about this deal you if you eat of this you he you know he'll you'll be like him and he accused God of lying about the whole thing you see Satan is an accuser and he's there to not just accuse God but to accuse you and his only weapon is to reason against God to accuse his word of not coming to pass amen and to accuse you of your failures therefore you're unworthy to receive this now Satan is there to resist us and every time we rise to a position of sunship he's there to oppose us to try to keep our petition from the Throne of God listen we know when the church go goes up according to Revelation 12 when the bride of Christ goes up in the great Rapture ahead that Satan is cast out why all his accusing will be done right now we have an intercessor that is still on the throne and Satan can stand there and accuse because he's the attorney on the other side he's the opponent of Christ and he's standing there you know the opponent is standing there saying but wait Adam fell Adam did this yes I conquered him I got his wife to believe a lie and you said she would be damned by it and these are his children and they're all damned they're under my control they're under my dominion and Jesus says but they were mine before you got them that I chose them before the foundation of the world they were mine back then I have diverse claim on them and not only that my blood was shed for them and I paid a debt I didn't ow cuz they owed a debt they couldn't pay amen and I paid their debt and their sin that is paid the debt for their unbelief is paid oh Hallelujah if we can just get it friend for a moment the accuser is standing there but the mediator is standing there the kinsman redeemer standing there with the blood that can take the vious sinner's heart and change the atmosphere of it Hallelujah make them a new in Christ Satan is says they're guilty Jesus says but they're not amen now as he said in future home both the heavens and the earth now is contaminated with Devils that accuse us before God Jesus is there to intercede for us while the accuser keeps pointing the fingers saying they did this they did this they did death but the blood still covers he came to redeem that elected that he foresaw oh my and that's why it's so filthy today because the heavens and the Earth is contaminated with Devils that accuse us before God let me tell you what this means Paul was saying we are not wrestling against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness that every time you try to rise up as a Son of God he's there to knock you down This Means War that means we are in a battle that means there is war going on in every life and heart this morning amen and let me tell you even that is even for the Salvation of the Soul we are here doing battle amen with the wickedness of this world with the darkness of this world that wants to take a hold of The Souls of men and women and take them captive and make keep them in bondage amen and we're at War we're at Battle we're here amen the spirit of the Lord is upon me the Bible said he has anointed me to preach the gospel Amen to preach the gospel to the poor to bind up the Brokenhearted those that have been wounded and hurt hurt and destroyed by Satan's tactics Amen to bind them up Amen to bind up the wounded Hallelujah to heal the brokenhearted I don't care how brokenhearted that you are this morning how down in the dumps you've been over the situation that you have been he is here this morning to B up the Brokenhearted to open up the bounds of the prisoners them that are bound open up the prison doors and let those that are captive by sin to be delivered by the power and the grace of God we're talking about the power of God in work sir in Acts 26:17 he would he would call Paul said delivered thee from the people from the Gentiles whom thou now send thee to open their eyes here's the commission of every gospel preacher to open their eyes and to turn them from from Darkness to light Hallelujah and from the power of Satan un God oh I know you know I know you know movies will want to make it you know highly one want to make it some kind of exorcism and whatever else I'll tell you how to get rid of the devil of in your life give your heart to Christ let him be the ruler of your life amen that Satan's had lordship over it long enough amen it's time for the Holy Spirit to take lordship over your life to be the king of your heart that's what real salvation is it is the the throning of Satan from the life of a sinner and changing them and and opening up an atmosphere between them and God where the Holy Spirit can Ascend and descend upon them notice to open their eyes to turn them from Darkness to light from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in me notice to receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified this is true salvation it turns us from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan to to God look in Colossians 1:12 giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saint and light who had delivered us from the power of Darkness amen now he didn't just deliver you from the power of Darkness but he done something else he translated us into the kingdom of his dear son Hallelujah you already have if you're a Believer this morning you've already had a translation you were delivered from the power of darkness and removed from there under the Dominion of hell and darkness and now he have translated you into the kingdom of his son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins so you see here again this is what we have in his kingdom Redemption to his blood and forgiveness of sin so he actually bought us cuz we were sold by our first parents into sin and Jesus came to buy us to pay Redemption price to shed his blood in order to redeem you from sin Hallelujah so that you would have forgiveness of sins being right standing between you and God now so this this realm called the air is the atmosphere above it can you you're your your life there's even an atmosphere of your life and it's even this this Kingdom that Satan has can be synonymous with the world that Satan is ruling his Prince of this world and the whole world is Satan under Satan's domain this is why if you love the world or the things of the world the love of the father is not in you so it's a vital importance that you keep the atmosphere of your mind and your heart right that is that comes an opening of the way where the Holy Spirit can come and and and abide within you notice you as we remember now Adam once operated from this realm but he lost it because of the fall but Jesus came to clear the air the atmosphere between God and man I want you to remember even where he died he did not die on the earth and he didn't die in the heavens he died on the cross between Heaven and Earth amen Jesus said I'm going to make a way amen I'm going to make a way I'm going to be the path I am the way the truth the life I'm making a path right back to God right into his presence again where that heaven can flow right down into your heart and the kingdom of God can be in you Hallelujah I'm talking about kingdom airs this morning amen listen Jesus came to clear the air between God and man amen in his death he first he goes to hell when Jesus died he took every sin that there ever was with him amen the Bible said he became sin for us he knew no sin but it became sin and he took every sin with him to Hell come on amen he paid the price completely that's right amen and he did what while he was there he he did did what he actually transferred all sin back on the head of the devil that's why you who are redeemed will never answer to God for your sins because through the blood of Jesus and the bleach of that blood it has changed every chemistry of it and is it went back in the time and it went Falls all the way back on the head of the accuser himself and one day Satan will be will perish in hell for every [Applause] sin Hallelujah now man was held by death and but Jesus went to those who were in paradise and he emptied paradise and they resurrected with him and ascended with him brother when he did they went into his presence that's the Rapture of the Old Testament the Bible said in Matthew chapter 28 that many of the Saints which slept arose and appeared unto many with Jesus at his resurrection now this is very important because he not only died buried went to hell paid for our sins raised up them and resurrected with them but he also ascended now this Ascend Ascension is one of the greatest days now I I I realize we put a lot of emphasis on Calvary and and on the cross and what Jesus did for that but if Jesus just rose up just to live a normal life it would have been nothing he came from Heaven God left heaven to come to Earth as a man to defeat sin in the flesh to conquer the devil and him that had the power of of of death to conquer him right and he rose up but his work wasn't through he has now to clear a channel between God and man again now ever since that day in Eden that sin was committed all of heaven was shut off from mankind Satan the prince of the power of the air remember it says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lord Lucifer and you see you see Heaven that became blocked off from man the the the realm of perfection the realm of love the the realm of uh the Beauty and the Holiness of God becomes black off and and we become under the power of the Prince of Darkness and the light that man lived in of the glories of God now were covered with the power of Darkness and nobody could could could penetrate that because of that power just above us that the heaven means the atmosphere above and all these Powers were shut off from mankind because of sin and so you see every kind of thing as as a every Spirit now the atmosphere between man and God becomes darkened and demon powers now controlling the world controlling the Earth animals that once lived in Harmony and peace now begin to kill each other man even even begins to murder each other and we have the first murder in Cain all of this begins to happen chaos BEC Darkness covers the earth and and and that access between God and man was broken and the atmosphere was clouded with every kind of demon power amen and because the you see the here all these powers that accused now won't let God and man Fellowship anymore it become that Fellowship became broken and Eden sin done it and the domain of the earth became Satan it belonged to the devil but there that day when Jesus ascended I want you to get this he came as the anointed high priest Hallelujah Christ with his own blood as a high priest Anointed with the power of God raised from the dead and broke through the domain of Satan hallelujah oh brother he had already come down from the heavens of heavens and come to the lowest of the earth and but now he's received into heaven and God said him there Upon A Pinnacle that he has to look down to see Heaven no wonder he's a mighty conqueror as he stands there in that domain forever and ever as he as he as as Isaiah said For unto us a son is born unto us a child is given his name Shall be Called counselor principes and mighty God that word mighty God means warrior God God would take on human battles God would come down and walk on the earth in the man Christ Jesus amen and be tempted with everything that man can be tempted by and overcome it Prevail against it then take the penalty of sin himself go to hell with your sins raise up on the third day with the Saints amen and now he was going he's going to ascend back in the glory and there there's all these principalities and these Powers but he's going to make a way amen he going to make a way between God and man between God and his sons he's going to make a path through the domains of Satan where he's the prince of the power of the air listen remember this it was there in the days of of Daniel remember where that the angel was trying to get to him to answer a prayer for four what was it 40 days or or whatever it was how many days was it yeah so there he was he was there wrestling with the angels He said the Prince of Darkness the Prince of Persia he opposed me to hold me back and he said I wouldn't I wouldn't ever got through if it hadn't been for Michael the one who is like Jehovah the Covenant Angel to come to my Aid to intercede on your behalf but now Daniel the answer is here you see he broke through the domain of Satan that was keeping the prayer from being answered now Jesus comes he comes through there to the Earth what's he going to do he's going to overcome this sin in the flesh he's going to take sin to Hell he's going to raise up Triumph don't you know do do you know when he raised up Triumph he raised up over every heart trouble come on he raised up listen he let me tell you when he when he died he paid for every heart condition every stroke condition amen he paid for every sin condition every Cancer every disease he paid for it all and he rose up and when he rose up amen there was no sign of weakness he W Rose up in health strength power what did he do at Calvary he defeated your sickness he defeated your sin he defeated cancer cancer has already been defeated we do not have to defeat it it is defeated it is a bluff and when we take dominion over it has to go amen so Jesus when he raised up and he ascended that day he broke through the veil of sin because all of these veils of Darkness was there he tore apart with the with the high priest's blood of his own body and he he went through the veil of sickness through the veil of worry through the veil of fear he tore every one of them down and he ascended on high there and and God gave him a name that was above all names that at the name of Jesus every knee has to Bow every Cancer every sin every habit every devil has to bow in the name of Jesus he ripped the veil of sin and two the veil of sickness into he broke every Power he scattered every devil hallelujah how do I know that let me tell you you know it was um it was Jacob who had a vision of this one night he saw Heavens open and a ladder Between Heaven and Earth and he saw that with with that opening Between Heaven and Earth that Angels could Ascend and descend right amen now let me tell you that was only speaking of Jesus Christ who would be the latter or the way back into heaven amen and Jesus amen Made A Way and made a ladder to back to heaven to the presence of God and he opened up a way and he made it where he sent his holy spirit right back down on that ladder and 120 got filled with the atmosphere of heaven and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterings amen the veil was ran into this was foretold and shattered when God when man could no longer go into bre God's presence God became a man that's amen and it was God now ascending God and man now a lad has been made for the Holy Spirit to descend to you and for you to ascend to God come on there is a way been made Jesus is that way hallelujah amen a Channel of the Holy Ghost in This dark world is laying open for every every one whosoever will that will be baptized in this great channel of his Blessing and receive the Redemption blessing that Jesus died for now I want you to remember the way has been made now remembering this the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise will bring it to pass now then if that's so then the reverse is true the wrong mental attitude toward any Divine promise will keep it from happening so you see how important atmosphere is Satan's a prince of the power of the there he he keeps off he Wars off the blessings from God and as you try to ascend now listen he cannot keep you from ascending but he can talk you out of it he cannot knock you off the ladder come on but he can he can try to keep you from ascending and if he keeps you from ascending remember where are you ascending to the throne is that right Amen to your throne where there there is a man there his name is Christ Jesus who intercedes between God and man oh somebody help me preach amen listen listen church this is important he you come boldly before the throne of grace not timidly Not Afraid not with worry but boldly before the throne of grace this is your approach to God you cannot approach in fear you cannot approach with worry you Cann not approach listening to the accusation of the devil the only way you can approach is boldly with boldness I've taken what you said God you paid for my sins on the cross amen I'm a blood wash blood vought son or daughter of the Living God I have a right to come in the presence I'm knocking on your door this morning I'm coming to a man who understands a man who the man Christ Jesus who went through what I go through who is the intercessor for me and I'm coming to him and say Jesus Jesus it is through you I come into God's presence I cannot come my own way I cannot come without the blood I can only come through the blood of Jesus the way you have made now so Satan but he'll get into the wind he'll get into the waves he'll cause storms and that's the way it is with Believers sometimes they let down their bars to unbelief and Satan comes in in a whirlwind and he causes fusses and stews and arguments and everything else the devil getting among the people gets among the air he whirls it up causes death getting among the water whirls it up God created but they permitted the devil come in and I'm just telling you the Mind battles you're going through I'm going to call it what it is those sinful thoughts where you complain of where God has you in life amen this is why you must fight to maintain a clear atmosphere between you and God listen you know that even as a gardener if you go out and plant a seed it won't do any good until the right atmosphere you can plant whatever you want to at the wrong season cuz the atmosphere isn't right amen are you with me the atmosphere isn't right but if you get it at the right temperature for that seed amen if it gets in the right place in the right atmosphere amen life's going to germinate there's life in it is going to burst forth amen and let me tell you church if we can get in the right atmosphere Even in our church what do you think was happening in the upper room they begin to praise God and bless him because they were looking toward a Divine promise carry you in Jerusalem until you're endued with power of on high after they quitted their arguments and quit their elections and quit their their man things and begin to focus on God and begin to bless God they get in one mind and one Accord and when they did Heaven begin to move amen and that channel that Jesus had made between God and man here comes flowing down the Holy Spirit and 120 was filled with the Holy Ghost amen that atmosphere spilled right out into the streets amen not only did they hear him glorifying God in other languages but also that that a man crippled from his mother's womb was healed and and and walked and leaped and praised God why because the atmosphere of the church the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost as Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I'll bring you into Heavens atmosphere in this place of divine love in this place of the Holy Ghost cripples walk demons flee Spirits have to move hallelujah amen when you get a seed of the word of God in the right atmosphere every Divine promise of God will produce exactly what he said it would produce it's the atmosphere the Great Divine Healing movement that went through back in the 40s and 50s was all on account of atmosphere the world was charged because of the coming of an Angel and a message from God with a gift of Divine Healing sent I want you to understand that great atmosphere of of faith of believing all things were possible amen but you know he can't heal you unless your atmosphere is right for healing if healing is the earnest of the resurrection and we can't have the chains of body unless the atmosphere is right what in the world is wrong with with us I mean we're listening to the accusations of the devil every time that the spirit of God begin to break loose and people begin to worship God because of the atmosphere don't you know it's in that kind of atmosphere that miracles happen don't you know is that kind of atmosphere the Saints will come here and we will be changed don't you know that the atmosphere has to be charged with the glory of God and the air clear between us and him because we are going to meet him in the air that's the meeting place you got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it atmosphere is a very Supernatural thing all all in the upper room with one Accord suddenly they came from heaven heaven came down and filled man and their atmosphere was of Heaven you let a little handful of people like sitting here today get in a perfect atmosphere you can watch what takes place amen all kinds of things will happen cripples will walk blind will see de will hear dumb will speak without even a prayer or anything amen because Divine love will just permeate the building and the spirit of God will move listen listen this is how it was done this is exactly way it was done in the Divine Healing meetings of of the of the years past which is one of the last revivals this world will see a world wide sweeping Revival but people lost enthusiasm they lost the joy of it they you know begin to be and fight and and whatever listen God ain't interested in all your theology and all your all you're fussing about it he wants one thing the air cleared between you and him because it's there the blessings can flow the power can be moved oh I'm not saying you're not a Christian just not revived in that spirit that great atmosphere that does something but that's what it does to take a real Revival is the atmosphere you ever notice you ever notice we can it can happen we can have a a series of meetings we can have visitant speakers people come in with expect expecting the the blessings of God and you're excited and you you believe God's going to do something and the atmosphere happens and you'll see a Break Forth of the Holy Spirit that's right you know it doesn't happen it doesn't just happen have to be a special meeting it could be a meeting like this this morning where your expectancy Rises to a level my God is here Among Us My God's the same yesterday today and forever I am a blood wash Blood Bought son or daughter of God I have a need God's going to move Hallelujah you ought to expect God to move on your behalf this morning to break every fed to break every chain to bless God until the atmosphere gets right amen takes that right atmosphere for children to be born in the Kingdom remember where we are in this day in this hour I think of brother brandham let me tell a couple of stories talk about Satan being the prince of the power of the air we all know about the conf speaking to the storm commanding it to go back that's the power that lays in Believers amen we we all aware of that but you know what what about it when he was in Germany there they had this big canopy that they had built kind of rickety a homemade thing to try to hold the sun off of the people and whatever it was an outdoor meeting and there were several thousand that had gathered and there was come some witch doctors that they began to do their chance cut feathers and do I don't know what all kinds of things that they were doing there until they called a storm and that storm was about to rip away the the whole canopy off the people and cause chaos and destruction and brother Bram stood there in the pull fit for a moment he says you know almighty God you sent me to this country and I I've been ministered to by an Angel of God who gifted me and sent me here and here they have come with this opposing Spirit here to bring and they brought up this storm now in the name of Jesus Christ you storm you go back and he said that storm went bang bang Bo and then just died down and went away and those men walked out of the meeting just all down depleted because Satan Was Defeated amen now listen if God can do that with the atmosphere he can do that with your atmosphere no matter how Disturbed it's been no matter how tormented how Afflicted he can do the same thing for every sinner for every believer he can change the atmosphere in your life from doubting to Faith to believing Hallelujah this is our responsibility as children of God we need to pick up that power ful weapon of the Holy Spirit and take Dominion this morning clear the air there's something been there powers of Darkness this sinful World let me tell you this word of God this holy spirit will break every stronghold every doubt all unbelief by the righteousness and the resurrection power of Jesus Christ amen let's SP our heads together let the musicians come right now I want you to realize friends Satan is stripped of every privilege he had robbed him of everything he had took it away from him and gave the power to the church the Dominion that he took away from sons of God has been handed back to you an open book has been given showing the complete possession of the complete inheritance none of it's closed it's all open oh don't let some accuser of the Brethren come in and say ah days of Miracles are passed or God don't do that no more this ain't in the Bible it is in the Bible he wants every word to be true to you I don't know I don't know what it is maybe there's been things between you and there something there that's been holding back the blessings of God a promise to be fulfilled a prayer to be answered maybe you're on the verge of just giving up you're just on the verge of quitting why don't you just quit sin and quit unbelief quit your doubting on you you quit the the pity party the feeling sorry things ain't working way though I want them to be put your hands in the hand of God and say Lord you can transform my life this morning you can change me in your presence you can clear the air between me and you where the Holy Spirit can flow freely angels can descend upon me the spirit of God can move I want you in my life I want you in my heart I want you in my being maybe there's a backslider today you've been away from God you never really surrendered your heart to God and you want to to God to day to clear the air in your life there's things between you atmosphere just ain't been right you remember when Heaven opened to you when you realize you was a child of God and sins you used to do had no more power over you you remember how used to be when you had that Fellowship that friendship and the spirit of God moved down on you you were so blessed in his presence Revelations came Spirit moved he spoke to you he wants to do that again today maybe the accuser been standing there accusing maybe accusing God of not keeping his word of not fulfilling his promise may be accused and saying ah there's no sense in having that atmosphere where the spirit of God moves freely you're all right the way you are why don't you just invite God to come this morning so Lord I need an intercessor the angels of God been trying to get to me kind of descend upon the ladder that you made the way you made and you want to bring healing to me you want to bring Deliverance in my life I want that Deliverance today why don't you invite him invite him to where you are right now you were sometimes Darkness the Bible says but now you're light in the Lord don't you let him work in your life today why don't you let him remove that darkness that Sin from you let him speak to you in a special way what about you maybe as a Christian you just kind of had that lukewarmness a tepid attitude the atmosphere just not been cold or hot just kind of lukewarm that that kind that makes God sick you can't speak for him when you're lukewarm he wants to move in your life today where there's a fervent desire again to please God a passion to know his word the surrenderance of your heart to him why don't you ask him today why don't you ask him Lord clear the air Prince of the power of this world is putting all kinds of thoughts in there I'm battling every kind of thing I'm too sick I'm too old I'm too this I'm too weak I've had this problem too long I've got this habit they said this about me the accuser said that don't you let it go and let hear what God said he has made you accepted in the Beloved in Christ your sins are forgiven you're washed by his blood you're his child there's just nothing between you and your savior oh that's that's where his blessed face then can be seen would you ask him to do it today ask him right now now invite him into your life say Lord I want that atmosphere right I want that atmosphere in the church right I just hadn't been where I ought to be I'm having this little wakeup call Lord in this moment in this time where you're nudging me you're waking me up say draw nearer to me come on up the ladder come on up the ladder take him another step higher come on you're an Enoch you're not to be Earthbound you're to walk with me you're walking with your fears you're walking listening to unbelief leave all that behind oh if you could see him in that other dimension I think of a again brother brandham seeing him in other dimension said he looked like a deformed creature almost like Ali oop in the funny papers he was accusing me you have no power with God you ain't got nothing listen if he'll come and accuse a prophet of God he'll come and accuse you you can't see It'll mention what's Whispering it but it isn't God God is saying your mind you're forgiven you're a son you have an inheritance you said brother Tim I I hadn't lived like a Christian I hadn't been a Christian why don't you just ask him today I want the atmosphere right in my life Lord I want it changed somebody wants prayer this morning just make your way up right now we'll pray with you Jesus knows every situation Jesus knows every problem my Jesus knows just
