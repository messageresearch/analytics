[45:05] house of God tonight
[45:07] amen if you'll open your Bibles with me
[45:09] to the Book of Luke we'll get directly
[45:10] into the word Luke the 19th Chapter
[45:14] and the first verse we're going to read
[45:16] down through the 10th verse
[45:19] last night I was just uh
[45:22] the way the Lord works just just drawn
[45:24] to this to the scripture reading and as
[45:26] I began to read it just some things
[45:27] began to come out of it that I really
[45:30] enjoyed and spoke to my heart and
[45:33] I was telling the guys in the back I
[45:34] said you probably hadn't heard about
[45:36] Zacchaeus since Sunday school so let's
[45:38] review
[45:40] Luke 19 and 1.
[45:43] it says in Jesus
[45:45] entered and passed through Jericho
[45:48] and behold there was a man named
[45:50] Zacchaeus which was the chief among the
[45:52] publicans and he was rich
[45:55] and he sought to see Jesus who he was
[45:58] and could not for the Press because he
[46:02] was little of stature
[46:04] and he ran before and climbed up into a
[46:06] sycamore tree to see him and he was to
[46:09] pass that way
[46:11] and when Jesus came to the place he
[46:13] looked up and saw him and said unto him
[46:15] Zacchaeus make haste and come down for
[46:18] today I must abide at thy house
[46:21] and he made haste and came down and
[46:23] received him joyfully and when they saw
[46:26] it they all murmured saying that he was
[46:28] gone to be guest with a man that is a
[46:30] sinner
[46:31] and Zacchaeus stood and said unto the
[46:33] Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I
[46:36] give to the poor and I have taken and if
[46:39] I have taken anything from any man by
[46:41] false accusation I restore him fourfold
[46:44] and Jesus said unto him this day is
[46:47] salvation come to this house for so for
[46:51] so much as he is also a son of Abraham
[46:53] for the son of man has come to seek and
[46:56] to save that which was lost amen you may
[47:00] have your seats tonight
[47:02] I'm so grateful that he came to seek and
[47:04] to save that which was lost because I
[47:07] was right there in that number
[47:09] and then I'm grateful tonight that he
[47:11] came to seek and and to save and
[47:15] what a wonderful statement he makes
[47:17] there in verse 9. this day is salvation
[47:20] come to this house
[47:24] I'm thankful that he's still seeking and
[47:26] he's still searching and he's still
[47:28] bringing salvation to the house of those
[47:30] that will welcome him and there's so
[47:32] many wonderful things here in this
[47:34] scripture reading and so many lessons
[47:36] actually that we can learn from
[47:37] Zacchaeus and this may be a little bit
[47:39] like a lesson there was just some things
[47:41] in there that I really enjoyed and what
[47:43] we find is that like with all men and
[47:46] all women Zacchaeus faces obstacles and
[47:49] hindrances in his quest to see Jesus
[47:52] and we're going to speak about those
[47:54] obstacles and things tonight and if I
[47:56] was to give this a title I would call it
[47:57] just beyond the Press
[48:00] just beyond the press and
[48:03] life is a constant struggle and in life
[48:05] we have constant battles and
[48:08] it seems like battle one battle they
[48:11] lead you directly into your next battle
[48:13] and then that battle leads you directly
[48:15] into your next battle and it seems like
[48:17] just when things are beginning to settle
[48:19] down and you feel like you've got to
[48:20] hold on things and and you've got a time
[48:23] to breathe for just a minute you better
[48:25] look out because it's in that moment
[48:27] when the next battle is coming and the
[48:29] next wave is coming and the next blow is
[48:31] coming and and I'm sure that's how the
[48:33] disciples must have felt that night as
[48:34] they rode up one wave and down the next
[48:37] wave just sure that this would be the
[48:39] last one and this one's going to tip the
[48:41] boat but we made it over that wave and
[48:43] you think you have a minute to breathe
[48:44] and here comes the next wave and it's
[48:46] just it's just one thing after another
[48:48] and they'd make it through one just for
[48:50] the next wave to slam and swamp their
[48:52] boat but see in that situation that
[48:54] night they had a they had a captain with
[48:56] them that was in the boat
[48:59] and this Captain was more than a normal
[49:01] man but this Captain knew the sea
[49:03] because he had created the sea he was
[49:05] the creator and he was the master of the
[49:07] sea and therefore he was the master of
[49:09] the situation that they currently was
[49:11] facing and because of that they had
[49:13] nothing to fear and today unlike those
[49:16] on the sea of life with no Captain and
[49:18] unlike those that think their ship is
[49:20] Unsinkable or unlike those that have
[49:23] believed what they have built is is good
[49:25] enough to see them through unlike those
[49:27] that have no hope tonight on the sea of
[49:29] life we have a captain and this Captain
[49:31] is the creator he is the almighty he is
[49:34] the master of the wind and therefore he
[49:36] is the master of your situation and
[49:39] because of that no matter the battle it
[49:41] may be one battle after another after
[49:42] another but because of who our captain
[49:44] is it will be one Victory after another
[49:46] Victory after another Victory after
[49:49] another Victory wave after wave and war
[49:52] after War there will be Victory upon
[49:54] Victory Time After Time After Time
[49:56] because our captain is in the vote
[49:59] tonight I'd like to remind you that
[50:01] Jesus is in the boat with us no matter
[50:03] what we're facing and no matter where
[50:05] we're standing I would like to remind
[50:06] you tonight we win I would like to
[50:09] remind you again that regardless of
[50:11] where you're at and what situation
[50:12] you're facing tonight you are a winner I
[50:14] think we should take a moment tonight
[50:16] and remind the devil who the winners are
[50:18] that's us tonight and I would also like
[50:20] to remind him who the loser is and
[50:23] that's him tonight I think it's
[50:24] important that we all find our place so
[50:26] tonight winners take your place and
[50:29] loser take your place and we are here to
[50:31] stand and remind you that we serve a
[50:34] mighty Captain he is the master of the
[50:36] sea he is the master of circumstance and
[50:39] tonight he's in this boat so we have
[50:42] nothing to fear Hallelujah
[50:46] there are strong winds blowing No Doubt
[50:50] every negative thing is coming against
[50:52] us
[50:53] storms are rising and this bride is
[50:55] being attacked on every hand
[50:58] but I'd once again like to declare it's
[51:00] going to take a stronger wind than this
[51:02] it's going to take a stronger wind than
[51:04] this to keep me from my promises because
[51:06] tonight I am determined that no matter
[51:08] who and no matter what and no matter
[51:11] what comes between me and the Lord I'm
[51:13] gonna get to Jesus I'm going to get to
[51:15] him I'm going to pass through push
[51:17] through pull through I'm gonna fight I'm
[51:20] gonna get through the Press because just
[51:22] on the other side of the press is my
[51:24] Lord Jesus just on the other side of the
[51:27] obstacle is my Lord Jesus healing is
[51:29] there South nation is there Deliverance
[51:31] is there victory is there and it's just
[51:34] on the other side of the press I am
[51:36] determined tonight nothing's going to
[51:38] stop me from getting there nothing's
[51:40] going to stop me short but I'm gonna
[51:42] push through tonight
[51:49] this account that we're reading here in
[51:51] Luke
[51:52] what we read is the final trip
[51:55] of Jesus's life
[51:58] this is the same trip through Jericho
[52:00] where blind Bartimaeus is healed
[52:04] this is leading up to the final week of
[52:06] his life
[52:08] it's in this very chapter
[52:10] in chapter 19 if we go just a little
[52:12] further that we read of his entry into
[52:14] Jerusalem where they would shout and
[52:16] praise him with loud voices as he rides
[52:19] in on the cult
[52:20] spreading their garments out in front of
[52:22] him and
[52:23] and here he is only a few days before
[52:25] this in his entire mind brother Brandon
[52:27] would tell us has already said on
[52:28] Calvary
[52:29] the weight of your sins and my sins is
[52:32] already upon his shoulders
[52:34] and yet what I love about this is you
[52:36] know many times we look around and we
[52:37] think this is the end and so much is
[52:39] going on and so much is happening and
[52:41] he's preparing to come back he must not
[52:43] have time to think about you and me now
[52:45] here's an example right here right here
[52:47] at the end time he hasn't forgot you he
[52:49] hasn't forgot your lost loved ones he
[52:51] hasn't forgot your situation right here
[52:53] with his mindset on Calvary he comes to
[52:56] Zacchaeus and he says come on down
[52:58] because I hadn't forgot about you come
[53:00] on down because you was willing to do
[53:02] whatever it took come on down because
[53:03] today I'm going to your house I'm
[53:06] telling you tonight on a Wednesday night
[53:07] if you're willing to do whatever it
[53:09] takes in this darkness in this time if
[53:12] you'll pushed through he'll come to your
[53:13] house tonight he'll come to Europe you
[53:15] tonight he'll deal with your situation
[53:17] tonight if you're willing to do whatever
[53:19] it takes
[53:21] and it's right here at the end of his
[53:22] life his mind is set on Calvary
[53:25] and this man named Zacchaeus
[53:28] begins to desire to see this Jesus for
[53:30] himself
[53:32] now these things don't happen by
[53:34] accident
[53:35] it isn't happenstance when when someone
[53:38] begins to desire God
[53:40] always because this person said this and
[53:42] this person that I don't know what's
[53:43] going on let me tell you what's going on
[53:45] when something starts changing in a
[53:46] person's heart our God is on the Move
[53:48] God is moving in that situation and and
[53:51] brother Branham would say that that his
[53:54] wife had been praying for him
[53:57] he says she'd been a Believer on the
[53:59] Lord Jesus she'd been praying for her
[54:01] husband a businessman in the city to
[54:04] become a follower of the Lord Jesus and
[54:06] you know conviction can make you very
[54:08] restless it does that and so a good
[54:11] Praying Wife or mother can do more for
[54:14] the kingdom of God on her knees at home
[54:16] than the preacher can do on the platform
[54:20] listen don't ever let him convince you
[54:22] to stop praying don't ever let him
[54:24] convince you to give up because it don't
[54:26] seem like nothing's happening and I've
[54:27] been praying and I've been praying
[54:29] there's a reason he tries to get you to
[54:30] stop it's because he recognizes how
[54:33] powerful that prayer really is he
[54:35] recognizes the damage you can do with
[54:37] that more than the preacher can do on
[54:39] the platform if you'll stay on your
[54:40] knees for Mama stay on your knees for
[54:42] Daddy stay on your knees for that lost
[54:44] loved one don't give up right now but
[54:46] you keep praying you keep believing you
[54:49] keep standing in this time oh I'm not
[54:52] seeing anything happening right now well
[54:54] nothing has changed nothing has changed
[54:56] they're still doing this my situation
[54:58] just like that don't let that be your
[55:00] testimony but you testify of the
[55:02] finished work oh yes he's coming home oh
[55:04] yes daddy saved oh yes I'm Healed you
[55:07] say I don't want to lie I don't want to
[55:09] tell a lie how can the word of God Be
[55:11] Alive the word of God says you're healed
[55:14] the word of God says the promise is
[55:16] theirs the word of God says the
[55:18] prodigals are coming home it can't be a
[55:20] lie if it's in the word just testify of
[55:23] the word
[55:27] things are changing things are happening
[55:30] people are coming home the prodigals are
[55:33] returning Deliverance is mine salvation
[55:35] is mine
[55:36] [Applause]
[55:38] just Testify the word it can't be a lie
[55:44] [Applause]
[55:46] we got to get our eyes
[55:48] off the press
[55:51] get your eyes off of the situation
[55:54] get your eyes off of the current
[55:56] condition
[55:57] because these are the things that are
[55:58] put there to hinder you
[56:00] these are the things that are put there
[56:01] to stop you
[56:03] the Press
[56:05] is the hindrances and the hardships and
[56:07] the battles that try to keep you from
[56:10] coming to your full inheritance
[56:12] they try to keep you from your encounter
[56:15] they try to keep you from your moment in
[56:18] the presence of God
[56:19] but it's just beyond the Press
[56:22] it's just beyond the Press just beyond
[56:25] those lies just beyond those fears
[56:27] that's where Jesus is
[56:30] that's where he's standing there with
[56:31] his hands held out saying come on push
[56:34] through push through you can do it
[56:36] there's your deliverance there's your
[56:38] salvation there's the answer to your
[56:40] prayers
[56:41] but you have to be willing
[56:43] to go beyond the Press
[56:46] verse 1 says and Jesus entered and
[56:48] passed through Jericho
[56:50] and behold there was a man named
[56:52] Zacchaeus which was the chief among the
[56:55] publicans and he was rich
[56:57] and almost always publicans and sinners
[57:00] are put together in the same sentence
[57:03] so he was the chiefess of sinners
[57:07] anybody can be saved the God I serve is
[57:10] so full of mercy and Grace you say well
[57:12] how do you know anybody can be saved who
[57:14] you going to point to
[57:16] right here
[57:18] right here I was the chiefess of sinners
[57:22] and it says that
[57:24] he was a Publican or a tax collector and
[57:28] not just any old tax collector but he
[57:30] was Chief in other words he was the boss
[57:33] of the tax collectors
[57:36] and Jericho was known for the trade and
[57:38] the selling selling of Balsam
[57:41] even the word bomb when it speaks about
[57:43] the bomb of Gilead it would be come back
[57:45] to this plant
[57:46] and it was known throughout the ancient
[57:48] world for its medicinal use and its rare
[57:50] perfumes and it was the most economic
[57:53] economically significant plant of all
[57:57] ancient times
[57:59] so what are you trying to tell me he was
[58:01] rich rich Empire and and he would take a
[58:04] prophet take money off the top already
[58:07] above and beyond the taxes in order to
[58:09] gain wealth from the hardship of his own
[58:12] people
[58:15] Luke 19 and 3 says and he sought to see
[58:19] Jesus who he was
[58:20] and could not
[58:22] for the Press
[58:24] in other words there was hindrances
[58:26] there
[58:27] there was something keeping him from
[58:29] seeing Jesus and it says because he was
[58:32] of little
[58:33] stature
[58:35] now
[58:36] I'm not going to go so far as to say he
[58:38] was a
[58:39] that's not politically correct I don't
[58:41] think I don't know what the proper word
[58:42] is but my point is this
[58:45] if it was significant enough to be
[58:48] recorded in Scripture
[58:50] this wasn't just a short person
[58:53] you understand what I'm saying there was
[58:55] a lot of people in the Bible that was
[58:57] five six that was just regular
[58:59] that was regular very normal
[59:03] this was
[59:05] small
[59:07] he had a lot
[59:11] he had for real little man syndrome
[59:15] for real for real
[59:17] but it was enough that it was recorded
[59:19] in the scripture
[59:20] and he had lots of things that tried to
[59:22] hinder him that day his stature being
[59:24] one of them but his position being
[59:26] another who he was in the community and
[59:29] and he was so proud of what he had done
[59:31] overcoming all this and and fighting
[59:34] through the fact that he was different
[59:35] from whereabouts to accomplish all that
[59:37] he had accomplished and now am I going
[59:39] to be willing to give those things up to
[59:41] be Associated as a Holy Roller to be
[59:44] associated with one that believed in the
[59:45] moving of the spirit or associated with
[59:48] this miracle worker associated with
[59:50] these things am I willing to do that
[59:51] there were so many things hindering him
[59:53] in his life things that he had battled
[59:56] against and Ward against complexes that
[59:58] he had built up over time
[1:00:00] you know sometimes
[1:00:02] we throw off on the word complex it's
[1:00:04] like oh well they just have complexes
[1:00:05] because that may not be your battle
[1:00:08] that may not be a real thing in your
[1:00:11] heart mind battles may not be the issue
[1:00:13] you deal with that may not be what
[1:00:15] hinders you but to those in the battle
[1:00:17] it is extremely real to those that is
[1:00:20] their battle it is just as big a deal
[1:00:22] and as difficult to trial as whatever
[1:00:23] your battle is that you're facing in
[1:00:26] life
[1:00:27] and he's having to fight these things
[1:00:29] and he's having to fight these struggles
[1:00:30] and he can't see because of the press
[1:00:32] and and like I said what his battle was
[1:00:34] may not have been your battle in other
[1:00:36] words I wouldn't have had a problem
[1:00:37] seeing that day
[1:00:41] I would have been okay
[1:00:43] the tall guy standing there didn't have
[1:00:45] a problem seeing Jesus
[1:00:46] the the tall guy the Press didn't hinder
[1:00:50] him
[1:00:51] that wasn't an issue to him it wasn't an
[1:00:53] issue at all for him to see Jesus it
[1:00:55] wasn't his battle but to Zacchaeus
[1:00:57] because of the press he couldn't see
[1:01:00] Jesus but I'd like to point out that's
[1:01:02] not the whole thing that's not the issue
[1:01:04] we go home to verse four and I'd like to
[1:01:06] show you that the Press didn't stop him
[1:01:08] from seeing Jesus the hindrances didn't
[1:01:11] stop him the battles didn't stop him the
[1:01:13] complexes didn't stop him all those
[1:01:15] things around him didn't stop it says he
[1:01:17] ran before apparently it's okay to run
[1:01:19] if you're trying to get to Jesus he ran
[1:01:22] before and he climbed up a tree oh
[1:01:25] that's a little bit fanatical it's not
[1:01:27] fanatical when you're just trying to see
[1:01:29] Jesus he just wanted to get to Jesus I
[1:01:32] gotta knowing for myself it's the
[1:01:34] closing of time it's the closing of the
[1:01:36] Jewish dispensation he's on his way to
[1:01:39] Calvary I must see Jesus
[1:01:42] and he runs before and he climbs into a
[1:01:44] sycamore tree to see him for he was to
[1:01:47] pass that way
[1:01:50] I'm so thankful tonight that there's
[1:01:51] something on the inside of us that don't
[1:01:53] allow circumstances to make us quit when
[1:01:57] others would quit when others would fall
[1:01:59] away when symptoms are out of control
[1:02:01] and people are saying it's no use it's
[1:02:03] no hope but on the inside of a Believer
[1:02:05] something Rises up and says I'm Gonna
[1:02:08] See Jesus I'm gonna find a way to him
[1:02:10] I'm going to make it there no matter
[1:02:12] what I have to do I'm not going to quit
[1:02:14] I'm not going to back up oh what a
[1:02:17] blessed desire that is to see Jesus what
[1:02:20] a blessed enjoy it is no matter what it
[1:02:22] is no matter where you're at tonight
[1:02:23] don't ever let that desire to seek Jesus
[1:02:26] and to be in his presence don't ever let
[1:02:28] that desire be quenched don't ever let
[1:02:30] that desire to be put out for more of
[1:02:32] him for a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:34] for an outpouring of his spirit I say
[1:02:37] tonight I need to see Jesus tonight I
[1:02:40] need more of God whatever it takes I
[1:02:42] must see Jesus
[1:02:45] Hallelujah
[1:02:46] oh there was others there that was tall
[1:02:48] and could seem just fine and yet didn't
[1:02:50] have a desire to
[1:02:59] all right oh and sometimes the complexes
[1:03:01] get to us well I don't measure up
[1:03:04] I'm just not enough what do I have to
[1:03:06] offer
[1:03:06] I fall short I don't have gifts
[1:03:09] oh people might say something about me
[1:03:11] that's all just part of the press
[1:03:14] that's all just part of the press listen
[1:03:17] there's many many saws out there
[1:03:20] that are Head and Shoulders above the
[1:03:21] wrist

[1:03:25] apart and they act apart but they won't
[1:03:28] go down in the valley
[1:03:29] oh they looked apart and they're tall
[1:03:31] and they can and they can see everything

[1:03:37] giant they're so they're tall they got
[1:03:39] it all together they they seem to have
[1:03:41] everything they seem to have a happy
[1:03:42] home and they seem to have a good job

[1:05:03] be stopped
[1:05:04] and they'll get to Jesus
[1:05:07] brother Brown says that the Holy Spirit
[1:05:09] if Jesus Christ proves that he's here
[1:05:11] Among Us
[1:05:12] then press till you get to him
[1:05:15] like the little woman with the blood
[1:05:16] issue and all the different things that
[1:05:18] take in place and all the adversaries in
[1:05:21] her way she just pressed right on
[1:05:23] through till she touched him if this
[1:05:25] church tonight would do the same thing
[1:05:28] would press through every scale of
[1:05:30] unbelief would lock swords with the
[1:05:32] devil and his unbelief and press through
[1:05:34] to know that you're a child of God and
[1:05:37] an heir to these things in Jesus Christ
[1:05:38] standing present to show you that he's
[1:05:41] with you to keep his word oh be
[1:05:43] perseverant don't you let nothing stand
[1:05:46] in your way he says I'm just wondering
[1:05:48] if Faith really anchors could anything
[1:05:50] stand in your way
[1:05:53] oh come on let Faith anchor tonight I
[1:05:56] know I'm Healed I know I'm saved I know
[1:05:58] I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I know
[1:06:00] the Rapture is for me the body changes
[1:06:02] mine my children are mine let those
[1:06:05] things anchor and then do whatever it
[1:06:07] takes to get to them push through run
[1:06:09] over run through but whatever you do
[1:06:11] don't let yourself be stopped
[1:06:16] he says oh it's true
[1:06:17] she had many hindrances
[1:06:19] but her faith didn't have any hindrance
[1:06:22] you might have some he says I have
[1:06:24] plenty of them a lot of hindrances but
[1:06:27] about your faith that's the thing if you
[1:06:30] can't be persistent
[1:06:32] he says if you can't be persistent if
[1:06:34] you're going to let everything hinder
[1:06:36] you he says now physically you might
[1:06:38] feel bad physically you might not feel
[1:06:40] well and otherwise you might not feel
[1:06:42] like going to church you might not feel
[1:06:45] like doing anything but your faith don't
[1:06:47] have no hindrance it moves right on
[1:06:50] anyhow
[1:07:00] I believe I'm speaking to a group of
[1:07:02] people who's willing and ready to move
[1:07:03] right on anyhow
[1:07:05] that you're willing to lay your pride
[1:07:07] aside
[1:07:08] that church that you're willing to lay
[1:07:10] your fear aside that you're willing to
[1:07:12] fight through the Press tonight
[1:07:14] and when you do that I'll make you a
[1:07:15] promise he will meet your need
[1:07:18] when you're willing to fight through and
[1:07:20] press through but listen tonight he
[1:07:22] wants the people willing to fight not a
[1:07:24] people that are turned back because oh
[1:07:25] there's a press oh there's something in
[1:07:27] the way oh this isn't going exactly how
[1:07:29] I thought it would go now that's the
[1:07:30] time that a Believer shows its true
[1:07:32] colors that's the time that a Believer
[1:07:34] buckles down and puts on the armor and
[1:07:36] presses in harder than ever before and
[1:07:38] says I'm going to get to Jesus tonight
[1:07:39] I'm a believer I'm a Son of God I have
[1:07:42] benefits and I'm going to go take hold
[1:07:44] of those tonight
[1:07:49] many times we've prayed and we've prayed
[1:07:51] and prayed and nothing's happened
[1:07:53] you've called for your family
[1:07:55] and it seems Jesus just went further
[1:07:58] fear Whispers just give up
[1:08:01] doubt says I told you it wouldn't work
[1:08:03] but something deep down on the inside
[1:08:06] says even now Lord
[1:08:09] even now Lord Jesus I'll tell you
[1:08:12] tonight just stay with that right there
[1:08:14] even now stay right with that even now
[1:08:16] your flesh says stop your symptoms says
[1:08:19] stop but your faith says even now your
[1:08:21] faith says forward your faith says
[1:08:23] onward your faith says upward even now
[1:08:26] Lord I'm going to keep going forward
[1:08:27] even now I'm going to keep climbing
[1:08:29] because I'm going to get to Jesus I got
[1:08:31] to get to Jesus he's the resource he's
[1:08:33] the one I have need of I will have life
[1:08:38] brother Branham says but this one thing
[1:08:40] remember this morning
[1:08:42] seek life
[1:08:43] he says pursue after it thirst for it
[1:08:47] just keep reaching for it this doesn't
[1:08:49] sound like something you just try and
[1:08:51] give up on he says pursue for it thirst
[1:08:53] for it reach for it just keep reaching
[1:08:56] for it don't let nothing stand in your
[1:08:58] way seek for it what's he saying seek
[1:09:02] for life
[1:09:03] seek for a living God not some dead
[1:09:05] Creed not some formal church not just
[1:09:08] some teachings but he's saying seek life
[1:09:10] with all of your heart
[1:09:12] we talk about different presses and
[1:09:14] hindrances a lot of them come against us
[1:09:16] as individuals a lot of them come
[1:09:18] against the bride collectively
[1:09:21] there's a real press right now trying to
[1:09:23] squeeze the life out of the bride of
[1:09:25] Christ
[1:09:26] trying to formalize churches and and
[1:09:28] trying to just squeeze the life down
[1:09:30] trying to keep life from springing forth
[1:09:32] brother Brown said seek life pursue life
[1:09:35] reach for life keep reaching for life
[1:09:38] but it's trying to keep people from from
[1:09:40] from life coming forth trying to keep
[1:09:42] them from getting to Jesus trying to
[1:09:45] keep them from trying to keep Jesus from
[1:09:48] being born
[1:09:49] trying to keep him from being born in
[1:09:51] the heart of those that are seeking him
[1:09:53] so what they're trying to do is they're
[1:09:54] trying to stop birth
[1:09:59] brother Brown says what are they afraid
[1:10:01] of
[1:10:01] he says the new birth
[1:10:03] that's the reason we got grandchildren
[1:10:06] in the church they're afraid of New
[1:10:08] Birth afraid of the Holy Ghost afraid of
[1:10:12] the power of God so what you run into
[1:10:15] and this may sound harsh but what
[1:10:17] they're doing is they're running
[1:10:18] spiritual abortion clinics
[1:10:24] trying to keep life from coming forth
[1:10:27] spiritual abortion clinic they set up a
[1:10:29] press where they take the altar calls
[1:10:30] out of the church they twist quotes
[1:10:32] around they remove worship and spirit
[1:10:35] and Truth they kill the atmosphere that
[1:10:37] allows the birth to take place
[1:10:40] so I ask you this what life is it that
[1:10:42] we're supposed to bring forth
[1:10:44] what life is it that we're supposed to
[1:10:46] manifest who is it it's the Life of
[1:10:49] Christ
[1:10:53] and they're aborting the very Life of
[1:10:55] Christ before it can come forth in
[1:10:57] people's life
[1:10:58] Christ is attacked in the womb
[1:11:01] the anointing is attacked
[1:11:03] it kills it before it can be manifested
[1:11:06] it kills it before that life can come
[1:11:07] out of you
[1:11:10] that's dark brother and it is dark but
[1:11:13] let me shine a little light here that
[1:11:15] life will never never be stopped they
[1:11:19] can't stop it but it's still shining
[1:11:21] forth I'll stand here and scream it and
[1:11:24] once again Square my shoulders back and
[1:11:26] say Fight For Life Fight For Life fight
[1:11:29] for the Holy Ghost fight for the
[1:11:31] movement of the spirit fight for the new
[1:11:33] birth we gotta get to Jesus we gotta
[1:11:36] fight for it tonight or you can't keep
[1:11:38] an eagle caged up forever
[1:11:40] you can't keep them there you keep
[1:11:43] putting out life and killing life and
[1:11:45] finally there's a thirst on the inside
[1:11:47] of them that see Gene you can't keep it
[1:11:49] Dead Forever oh but they're going to
[1:11:51] come out of that they're going to push
[1:11:53] through they're going to get to the
[1:11:55] other side of the press where life is
[1:12:00] they can't help but look to the
[1:12:01] supernatural
[1:12:04] brother Brown says if a man is born of
[1:12:06] the spirit of God he believes in the
[1:12:08] Supernatural
[1:12:09] he can't help it because he's a Son of
[1:12:12] God and that's the reason tonight we got
[1:12:15] so many cold old cold formal indifferent
[1:12:18] God forsaken backslidden churches
[1:12:20] because men and women are not born of
[1:12:22] the spirit of God
[1:12:24] they have no taste of God they don't
[1:12:26] know nothing about God and all they know
[1:12:29] is theology
[1:12:33] and that's the reason you can't get them
[1:12:35] to believe a thing that's exactly right
[1:12:41] many of you here tonight
[1:12:43] wanting more freedom
[1:12:46] Desiring another outpouring believing
[1:12:48] for for more and wanting a greater
[1:12:50] experience or wanting a refilling of the
[1:12:52] Holy Spirit
[1:12:53] and I'm telling you that it's here for
[1:12:55] you
[1:12:56] I'm telling you that that is Flowing
[1:12:58] that there's a Wellspring of and you can
[1:13:00] have whatever you desire to have and
[1:13:02] it's just beyond the Press
[1:13:04] there's a part in this you have to play
[1:13:11] Zacchaeus could have stood there behind
[1:13:13] that the whole time and his desire could
[1:13:15] have been to see Jesus
[1:13:17] an honest desire and stand there going I
[1:13:19] want to see him I want to see him I want
[1:13:21] to see him but if he stood right there
[1:13:23] saying I want to see him he would have
[1:13:25] never seen him there was something he
[1:13:28] had to do there was a step he had to
[1:13:29] take he had to step out of his Pew he
[1:13:32] had to step out of his comfort zone he
[1:13:34] had to step on pass I just want to see
[1:13:36] him and he had to get to the place of
[1:13:38] I'm gonna do whatever I have to do I'm
[1:13:40] gonna go wherever I have to go but
[1:13:43] whatever it takes I will see Jesus
[1:13:47] I'm gonna get to him I'm gonna do my
[1:13:49] part to see Jesus tonight
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:13:54] you have to be willing to push through
[1:13:56] your nature
[1:13:59] foreign
[1:14:00] sometimes I do I honestly get to get
[1:14:03] tickled at people that say well you know
[1:14:05] that's just not my nature to do those
[1:14:07] things
[1:14:09] and then sister Alana is not here
[1:14:11] tonight she's sick so I can use her it
[1:14:13] won't embarrass her
[1:14:14] and I'm thinking do you even know Sister
[1:14:16] Atlanta
[1:14:17] if you're thinking that the people that
[1:14:19] do the things they do is because that's
[1:14:21] how their nature is
[1:14:24] because she just loves to be in front of
[1:14:26] everybody really loud
[1:14:32] do you even know the people you go to
[1:14:33] church with
[1:14:36] I'm just saying I mean I know some of us
[1:14:38] are more comfortable in front of people
[1:14:39] than others
[1:14:40] but sometimes the spirit make you do
[1:14:42] things I don't care how comfortable you
[1:14:44] are around people it ain't your nature
[1:14:46] to do it
[1:14:48] they pushed past their nature
[1:14:51] they said Lord I'm willing to worship
[1:14:53] you however you're asking me to worship
[1:14:56] you no matter how foolish I look to
[1:14:59] other people how silly they think if it
[1:15:01] pleases you Lord if it's what it takes
[1:15:03] to get to you Lord that's what I'm gonna
[1:15:05] do that's how I'm Gonna Worship that's
[1:15:07] how I'm gonna act you know I've never
[1:15:09] one time interpreted tongues
[1:15:12] but every time tones come forth I bow my
[1:15:14] head and I say Lord
[1:15:16] I'm willing
[1:15:18] I'll do it if you choose
[1:15:22] are you patting yourself on the back
[1:15:23] nope I'm just telling you in those
[1:15:25] moments that would be very difficult to
[1:15:27] do
[1:15:29] but are we willing to do whatever it
[1:15:32] takes for the spirit to have his way
[1:15:34] are we willing to do whatever it takes
[1:15:36] because Zacchaeus Was and because of
[1:15:39] that he said I'm coming to your house
[1:15:41] today
[1:15:42] and I think that's what we all do as I
[1:15:44] know there's a visitation from the Lord
[1:15:46] so we have to push through our nature
[1:15:48] push past our pride
[1:15:51] push past our fears and just let God
[1:15:53] move
[1:15:55] because you're amongst believers
[1:15:59] people who love to see God manifested
[1:16:04] people who love to see his presence
[1:16:06] poured out just push that thought aside
[1:16:08] of what will people think the people
[1:16:10] will rejoice with you the people will
[1:16:13] Shout with you the people will be set
[1:16:15] free just like all the Israelites on the
[1:16:17] hill when David killed the Giant and he
[1:16:19] did something that they all wanted to do
[1:16:21] themselves and you know what it allowed
[1:16:23] them to do it allowed them to come into
[1:16:25] the valley it allowed them to get some
[1:16:27] Freedom it allowed them to have some
[1:16:28] courage you say people are going to talk
[1:16:30] about me that's right we sure are you
[1:16:32] see him kill that giant you see him take
[1:16:34] down that Philistine it gave me courage
[1:16:36] it allowed me to do it it gave me
[1:16:38] strength oh we're going to talk about it
[1:16:40] we're gonna celebrate it we're gonna say
[1:16:42] how wonderful how Mighty Is Our God how
[1:16:45] great are his ex boys how might he is
[1:16:48] his name
[1:16:49] oh yes
[1:16:52] okay
[1:16:54] willing to push past
[1:16:57] Mark two and one a few examples in the
[1:17:00] scriptures that you're all familiar with
[1:17:02] and again he entered into Capernaum
[1:17:05] and after some days and it was noise
[1:17:07] that he was in the house
[1:17:12] and straightway many were gathered
[1:17:14] together
[1:17:15] in so much that there was no room to
[1:17:17] receive them no not so much as about the
[1:17:20] door
[1:17:22] and he preached the word unto them and
[1:17:25] they came unto him bringing one sick of
[1:17:27] the palsy which was born of four
[1:17:31] and when they could not come nigh unto
[1:17:33] him for the Press
[1:17:36] they uncovered the roof where he was and
[1:17:39] when they had broken it up they let down
[1:17:42] the bed wherein the sick of the palsy
[1:17:45] lay and when Jesus saw their faith he
[1:17:48] said unto the sick of the palsy son thy
[1:17:51] sins be forgiven thee
[1:17:54] there was so much in their way that they
[1:17:58] could have easily said this isn't your
[1:18:00] day buddy
[1:18:01] hey I promise there'll be another
[1:18:03] service he ain't going nowhere
[1:18:05] Sunday's coming then after that
[1:18:07] Wednesday's coming there'll be another
[1:18:08] opportunity for us to get you into his
[1:18:11] presence but today you had a bad day
[1:18:12] today a lot of things at work didn't go
[1:18:15] the way you wanted them to so you can
[1:18:16] just skip out on your blessing tonight
[1:18:18] today you got a report you didn't like
[1:18:20] to hear so you can just skip out on your
[1:18:22] blessing tonight there was so much in
[1:18:24] their way that could have turned them
[1:18:25] around and let them go home going that
[1:18:27] was just a pretty good service but they
[1:18:29] came determined that they were going to
[1:18:31] get to Jesus no matter what it took no
[1:18:33] matter how they went through no matter
[1:18:34] what door window or roof they had to go
[1:18:37] through they were going to get their
[1:18:39] friend to Jesus there was so much in
[1:18:42] their way and it seems like there's so
[1:18:43] much in our way sometimes as the Church
[1:18:46] of the Living God the bride of Christ so
[1:18:48] many things rising up so many hindrances
[1:18:50] so many things trying to stop us from
[1:18:52] taking a Rapture stopping us from coming
[1:18:54] to our full potential as the Bride of
[1:18:55] Jesus Christ but sometimes I think we
[1:18:58] ought to just tear the roof off the
[1:19:00] place sometimes I think we ought to get
[1:19:02] a little bit unconventional sometimes
[1:19:03] and say I don't matter what takes place
[1:19:06] tonight I'm getting to Jesus if we got
[1:19:08] to tear the roof off the place whatever
[1:19:10] it takes I'm gonna get in the presence
[1:19:13] of almighty God tonight and I'd like to
[1:19:16] warn people out there that are trying to
[1:19:18] keep people outside they're trying to
[1:19:20] keep them from getting in the presence
[1:19:22] of God they're trying to keep them from
[1:19:23] getting through the door trying to keep
[1:19:25] them from getting to the baptism of the
[1:19:27] Holy Ghost you better be careful because
[1:19:29] one of these days they're gonna tear the
[1:19:32] roof off the place and you're going to
[1:19:34] be left with it and they're gonna leave
[1:19:36] shouting and singing and dancing and
[1:19:39] healed and delivered and free and you're
[1:19:41] gonna be left with a hole in the roof I
[1:19:44] say just let them in let them get to
[1:19:47] Jesus let them get to their savior to
[1:19:51] the live spring
[1:19:53] they just want to get to Jesus
[1:20:04] I just want to get to Jesus tonight
[1:20:12] Hallelujah
[1:20:16] there was a great press
[1:20:19] but just beyond the Press was the
[1:20:21] healing
[1:20:22] just beyond the Press was there
[1:20:24] Deliverance
[1:20:25] because just beyond your press is Jesus
[1:20:30] prophet of God says
[1:20:33] if the Holy Spirit
[1:20:35] if Jesus Christ
[1:20:39] proves that he's here Among Us
[1:20:41] then press till you get to him
[1:20:44] foreign
[1:20:45] 21.
[1:20:49] that's a story you're all so familiar
[1:20:51] with
[1:20:54] people willing to fight willing to press
[1:20:57] it says that when Jesus was passed over
[1:20:58] again by ship
[1:21:00] unto the other side much people gathered
[1:21:02] unto him
[1:21:03] and he was nine to the Sea
[1:21:06] and behold there cometh one of the
[1:21:07] rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name
[1:21:10] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[1:21:11] and besought him greatly saying my
[1:21:14] little daughter lies at the point of
[1:21:15] death
[1:21:16] I pray that he come and lay thy hands on
[1:21:19] her that she may be healed and she shall
[1:21:21] live and Jesus went with him and much
[1:21:24] people followed him and thronged him
[1:21:26] now from this point on we're going to be
[1:21:27] talking about the certain woman in this
[1:21:29] story but let it not be forgotten
[1:21:32] that Jairus himself had gone beyond the
[1:21:34] Press
[1:21:35] he was a ruler of the synagogue he had
[1:21:37] everything to lose
[1:21:38] but because he was willing to do so his
[1:21:40] daughter lived
[1:21:42] sometimes we gotta be willing to make a
[1:21:44] move that our kids will live
[1:21:47] we got to be willing to do things that
[1:21:49] our children will survive they're laying
[1:21:51] at the point of death he's a deacon in a
[1:21:54] church he's the ruler of a synagogue
[1:21:56] he's a preacher somewhere he said I
[1:21:59] don't care I give all that up I got to
[1:22:01] get to Jesus Jesus I'm willing to go
[1:22:03] beyond I'm willing to do whatever I just
[1:22:05] want my kid to live I say tonight let
[1:22:07] our children live let our children live
[1:22:09] Lord Jesus come to my house my children
[1:22:12] are going to live and because he made
[1:22:14] the sacrifice his daughter lived and it
[1:22:17] says in verse 25 and a certain woman
[1:22:19] which had a blood issue 12 years and had
[1:22:22] suffered many things and many Physicians
[1:22:23] had spent all that she had it was
[1:22:25] nothing better but rather grew worse
[1:22:27] when she had heard of Jesus came in the
[1:22:30] press behind and touched His Garment for
[1:22:34] she said if I may but touch his clothes
[1:22:36] I shall be whole and straightway the
[1:22:39] Fountain of her blood was dried up and
[1:22:40] she felt in her body that she was healed
[1:22:42] of that plague and Jesus immediately
[1:22:45] knowing in himself that virtue had gone
[1:22:47] out of him turned him about in the press
[1:22:49] and said who touched my clothes
[1:22:53] it's another example of one who
[1:22:58] who had plenty of excuses
[1:23:00] and reasons why this ain't my time
[1:23:03] reasons why and fears and worries that
[1:23:05] could have stopped her and hindered her
[1:23:08] everyone that she had ever known had
[1:23:10] failed her or abandoned her
[1:23:13] everyone had turned their backs on her
[1:23:15] everyone told her to wait everyone said
[1:23:18] this is for another day everyone says
[1:23:20] she don't have to be so fanatical to get
[1:23:22] this touch
[1:23:24] but she was so desperate it reminds me
[1:23:26] so much of that little woman brother Tim
[1:23:29] there in Mexico with the dead baby
[1:23:31] she didn't care what they said about
[1:23:33] church order
[1:23:36] I want my kid to live
[1:23:38] she said she was going through their
[1:23:39] legs climbing over their shoulders
[1:23:41] basically walking on people's shoulders
[1:23:42] said there was no stopping her so they
[1:23:44] had dozens of Busters down there and
[1:23:46] they couldn't stop her I'm telling you
[1:23:47] when you get desperate enough there
[1:23:48] ain't no amount of church order or
[1:23:50] Baptist theology gonna stop you from
[1:23:51] getting to Jesus when you realize I
[1:23:53] gotta have it this is life and death I
[1:23:56] got to get to Jesus tonight oh I know I
[1:23:58] believe don't he but I need a touch I
[1:24:00] need to be at the Wellspring I need to
[1:24:02] be in his presence you will do whatever
[1:24:04] it takes to get there just trying to get
[1:24:07] to Jesus
[1:24:08] oh she got the attitude you just try and
[1:24:11] stop me from getting to that altar let
[1:24:14] me tell you what if we could get to the
[1:24:15] place if you just try to stop me one
[1:24:17] time you just try to stop my dance you
[1:24:19] just try to stop my shout you just try
[1:24:21] to stop me from getting the Holy Ghost
[1:24:23] you just try to shut down my worship and
[1:24:26] shut down my kids you'll have a war on
[1:24:28] your hands like this never had before
[1:24:30] because we ain't backing up backing down
[1:24:32] going back we're here we're right here
[1:24:35] at the feet of Jesus and here I plan to
[1:24:38] stay
[1:24:39] I will stay in his presence I will have
[1:24:41] his presence my children will have it
[1:24:43] this church will have it
[1:24:45] just try and stop us one time
[1:24:52] and that was her attitude
[1:24:54] you just try to stop me
[1:24:56] but I'm going to press through tonight
[1:24:58] I'm going to Touch the Hem of His
[1:24:59] Garment
[1:25:01] a determination to get what you need
[1:25:04] we'll always bring the results you need
[1:25:10] he says in Christ
[1:25:12] is our Variety Store
[1:25:15] by one Spirit we are all baptized into
[1:25:17] one big Variety Store
[1:25:20] I love it
[1:25:23] he says amen anything you have need of
[1:25:25] he will supply if I need healing I'll
[1:25:28] take it if I need Joy I'll take it if I
[1:25:32] need Victory I'll take it it's all
[1:25:35] hanging around and God's big Variety
[1:25:37] Store and I am possessing and you have
[1:25:40] possession of everything in that Variety
[1:25:43] Store when you're baptized with the Holy
[1:25:45] Ghost Amen brother you talk about Elbow
[1:25:47] Room
[1:25:48] let's take over he says
[1:25:51] we need healing there it is sitting
[1:25:54] there for you just reach over and get it
[1:25:56] you might have to kick over a few things
[1:25:58] here to get it push through a few things
[1:26:00] to get it but go ahead and take it you
[1:26:03] might have to get a ladder and reach up
[1:26:05] for it but God's got a ladder there if
[1:26:09] you're interested in getting it
[1:26:11] I'm telling you tonight if you're
[1:26:12] interested in getting it it's here in
[1:26:14] the store tonight if you're interested
[1:26:16] it's here you may have to kick over a
[1:26:18] few things that's the word of the
[1:26:19] Prophet you may have to climb a ladder
[1:26:21] you may have to go up a sycamore tree to
[1:26:23] get it but it's in the building if you
[1:26:25] desire it you can have it if you're
[1:26:27] willing to do whatever it takes to go
[1:26:29] beyond the Press it's waiting there for
[1:26:32] you tonight
[1:26:37] and that brings me to this question
[1:26:40] how desperate are you to see Jesus
[1:26:45] how desperate are we
[1:26:49] the problem with humanity is we usually
[1:26:51] only get desperate in Desperate Times
[1:26:55] instead of living a life of desperation
[1:26:58] desperate for more
[1:27:00] desperate for a touch
[1:27:02] desperate for our children even when it
[1:27:04] seems like they're doing good
[1:27:06] foreign
[1:27:08] we got to stay desperate
[1:27:10] stay on his hands
[1:27:12] I find this very interesting
[1:27:14] I'll throw this out there this is my
[1:27:16] take
[1:27:18] by the team if this is just stupid you
[1:27:20] can stand up and correct it when I'm
[1:27:21] done
[1:27:22] I don't mind I I Lay My Pride down I
[1:27:24] promise
[1:27:27] but look in Luke the eighth chapter
[1:27:30] this is just interesting as we're
[1:27:31] talking about being desperate and
[1:27:33] willing to go through the Press
[1:27:34] Luke 8 19.
[1:27:39] you know sometimes we think we can get
[1:27:41] to Jesus Because of Who We Are
[1:27:44] or who our daddy is or mama is or what
[1:27:46] church we go to
[1:27:48] you'll get to him the same way everybody
[1:27:49] else got to him
[1:27:51] since then came to him his mother
[1:27:54] and his brethren
[1:27:56] and could not come at him
[1:27:59] for the Press
[1:28:02] it's interesting we've seen that a bunch
[1:28:03] of times already
[1:28:05] and every time when people were
[1:28:06] desperate enough they got to him
[1:28:10] next verse says
[1:28:12] and it was told him
[1:28:15] by certain which said thy mother and thy
[1:28:18] Brethren stand without
[1:28:20] Desiring to see thee
[1:28:23] listen to his response
[1:28:25] and he answered and said unto them my
[1:28:28] mother and my brethren are these which
[1:28:31] hear the word of God
[1:28:33] and do it
[1:28:36] unwilling to Humble themselves down to
[1:28:39] press through
[1:28:41] he had no time for them
[1:28:45] in the same ways Zacchaeus could have
[1:28:47] stood there wanting to see him and never
[1:28:50] would if he wasn't willing to do
[1:28:52] whatever it took but his mother and
[1:28:55] brother stand there going hey you go
[1:28:56] tell Jesus you know it's kind of crowded
[1:28:58] and I'd rather speak to him out here
[1:29:01] and he says
[1:29:03] these are my mother
[1:29:05] these are these are my brothers
[1:29:07] because they were willing to get in the
[1:29:08] building
[1:29:10] I'd like to ask him why they wouldn't
[1:29:11] have to service 30 minutes early instead
[1:29:13] of showing up so late they had to press
[1:29:14] through the crowd anyway I'm just saying
[1:29:18] foreign
[1:29:20] like that
[1:29:23] get him
[1:29:25] I don't care who you are you shouldn't
[1:29:27] be so late you got to have somebody find
[1:29:28] Jesse
[1:29:32] moving on what's wrong
[1:29:39] Zacchaeus was willing to climb a tree
[1:29:42] some was willing to tear a roof off the
[1:29:44] place
[1:29:45] she was willing to push through the
[1:29:47] crowd even though she was considered an
[1:29:48] unclean woman
[1:29:50] every one of them got their need met
[1:29:54] Luke 19 and 5.
[1:29:57] where I kind of come back to this story
[1:29:58] there's other a few more things in here
[1:30:00] I really like about this story it says
[1:30:02] and when Jesus came to the place
[1:30:03] he looked up and saw him
[1:30:06] and said unto him Zacchaeus
[1:30:08] that Messianic sign right there on
[1:30:11] display
[1:30:12] he knows who you are and let me tell you
[1:30:15] something he already knew where his
[1:30:16] lived he could have told him his address
[1:30:19] Zacchaeus make haste and come down for
[1:30:21] today I must abide at thy house
[1:30:24] and we might get into this a minute
[1:30:26] later but I love how verse 6 says and he
[1:30:28] made haste and came down and received
[1:30:30] him joyfully
[1:30:32] your response to Jesus has as much to do
[1:30:35] with the outcome of the story as Jesus
[1:30:37] coming by you in the first place
[1:30:42] I love here that says Jesus
[1:30:45] called him by name
[1:30:47] he said Zacchaeus
[1:30:49] you know this would be the last named
[1:30:51] individual before Jesus goes to
[1:30:52] Jerusalem
[1:30:54] it's the last one that's recorded no no
[1:30:56] surely there's a lot of people that
[1:30:57] accepted Jesus that aren't recorded I
[1:31:00] get that but this is the last one
[1:31:01] recorded before he goes to Jerusalem and
[1:31:04] he calls him by name
[1:31:08] and it Thrills my heart when I look at
[1:31:10] this that he knows his chosen by name
[1:31:14] because he's already written it down in
[1:31:15] his book a long time ago he ain't
[1:31:19] meeting Zacchaeus for the first time he
[1:31:21] ain't saying zacchaeus's name for the
[1:31:22] first time this ain't a chance encounter
[1:31:24] this name had been written in the Lamb's
[1:31:27] Book of Life and in that moment
[1:31:28] Zacchaeus may have asked like Nathaniel
[1:31:30] did and said once knoweth thou me and he
[1:31:33] could have said before you climb the
[1:31:35] sycamore tree
[1:31:36] I knew you
[1:31:38] I knew you before you climbed the
[1:31:40] sycamore tree before you ever climbed up
[1:31:42] there I knew you I'm the one that placed
[1:31:45] the desire in your heart to come and see
[1:31:48] me this way I don't get it twisted old
[1:31:50] Zacchaeus Was really seeking God no
[1:31:52] that's not how this worked how come he
[1:31:54] woke up that morning with the desire how
[1:31:56] come he woke up that day and said I
[1:31:58] gotta get to Jesus that was Jesus
[1:32:00] calling him before he ever stepped in
[1:32:03] his presence that was me that put that
[1:32:05] desire in your heart as I kiss before
[1:32:07] you climb the sycamore tree I knew you
[1:32:09] oh come on church tonight quit worrying
[1:32:12] am I going to make it is my name there
[1:32:14] the desire in your heart you didn't put
[1:32:16] it there yourself he put the desire
[1:32:18] there he's calling you you're not here
[1:32:22] tonight looking for him he drew you here
[1:32:25] he called you to this truth he called
[1:32:27] you to this message it's him drawing you
[1:32:33] and he knows your name
[1:32:35] he knew you and he claimed you
[1:32:40] I love this
[1:32:43] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[1:32:45] thee o Jacob and he that formed the O
[1:32:47] Israel fear not
[1:32:49] for I have redeemed Thee I have called
[1:32:52] thee by name Thou Art mine
[1:32:58] somebody needs to hear this tonight
[1:33:01] somebody needs to hear this tonight
[1:33:03] but before you ever sinned
[1:33:07] before you ever walked out on God
[1:33:09] before you ever did the first thing
[1:33:11] wrong before you ever told your first
[1:33:14] lie I said your first curse word smote
[1:33:16] your first cigarette looked at
[1:33:18] pornography for the first time whatever
[1:33:20] you want to add to the list of sins they
[1:33:22] can be many before any of that happened
[1:33:24] you were his he said I formed Thee I
[1:33:28] name thee I've called thee by name you
[1:33:32] are mine and I tell you tonight Satan
[1:33:35] has no legal right to claim you because
[1:33:38] his claim predates Satan's claim he
[1:33:41] claimed you before the foundation of the
[1:33:43] world so his claim legally stands up in
[1:33:46] the court of law he said I have called
[1:33:49] thee by name
[1:33:51] Hallelujah you know Satan tries to put a
[1:33:54] claim on you he tries to and that's
[1:33:57] what's so wonderful about realizing that
[1:33:59] you're a sea Gene of God that's what's
[1:34:01] so wonderful about realizing that you
[1:34:03] are God's thoughts expressed that you
[1:34:05] are an attribute of God because when you
[1:34:07] realize that
[1:34:09] oh hang with me for a second then you
[1:34:11] realize that your name was written
[1:34:13] before the foundation of the world
[1:34:14] brother Derek and what that means is
[1:34:16] it's got a Time step on it there's a
[1:34:19] time stamp and that time stamp does away
[1:34:22] with the claim of the enemy a timestamp
[1:34:25] can actually be used in court as
[1:34:27] evidence and it proves when transactions
[1:34:30] took place
[1:34:34] now the enemy comes and says well I see
[1:34:36] here in Oglesby he gave his heart fully
[1:34:38] to you in the year 2013.
[1:34:40] he says but I can look here in my book
[1:34:43] and I know that in 1990 1991 when he was
[1:34:47] just a kid I had him all wrapped up tied
[1:34:50] up doing sinful things so so God you got
[1:34:54] him in 2013 but I had him as far back as
[1:34:56] 1990. so my claim predates your claim by
[1:35:01] 23 years and he's mine because I claimed
[1:35:05] him first I say let's go to the records
[1:35:07] and we look over in the records and it
[1:35:09] says according to the time stamp there
[1:35:12] was a transaction made there was a lamb
[1:35:15] slang but for the foundation of the
[1:35:18] world I never sinned in the first place
[1:35:21] the transaction took place back then my
[1:35:25] name was written back then I am his I
[1:35:28] belong to him and he is mine oh when did
[1:35:32] you know me Lord before the foundation
[1:35:35] of the world I knew you I formed you
[1:35:38] I've called you by name
[1:35:43] Hallelujah
[1:35:44] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:35:47] oh thank God for the time stamp
[1:35:50] Hallelujah
[1:35:58] the enemy's claim
[1:36:00] is fraudulent
[1:36:05] I love how all these things are
[1:36:06] happening in Jericho
[1:36:09] yeah I'm a big
[1:36:10] bring this down to a close
[1:36:13] foreign
[1:36:16] because you have the healing of
[1:36:18] Bartimaeus
[1:36:19] you have the saving of Zacchaeus
[1:36:22] and all these things
[1:36:24] and if you'll recall
[1:36:26] and we could go into a lot of detail
[1:36:27] about this but we won't
[1:36:29] we dealt with it in a service before
[1:36:30] Jericho
[1:36:32] was a cursed City
[1:36:35] it was a cursed place
[1:36:37] Joshua 6 26 a portion of that says in
[1:36:39] Joshua adjured them at that time saying
[1:36:42] cursed be the man before the Lord that
[1:36:44] riseth up and buildeth this city
[1:36:47] Jericho
[1:36:49] it's interesting to look at it that way
[1:36:51] that Jesus is in Jericho
[1:36:53] redeeming
[1:36:55] and Jericho being under a curse all the
[1:36:58] flesh there under a curse and yet you
[1:36:59] can take that right back to All Flesh
[1:37:01] being under a curse
[1:37:03] the curse of sin The Curse Of Death
[1:37:05] because of the Fall
[1:37:07] we know that humanity is under a curse
[1:37:09] families have Cycles or people will call
[1:37:12] them family curses
[1:37:14] but when Jesus came to a cursed City
[1:37:17] those that lived under the curse were
[1:37:19] set free
[1:37:23] they might have been living under a
[1:37:24] curse but you don't understand my family
[1:37:26] history and you don't understand this
[1:37:27] curse that's following my family you
[1:37:28] don't understand this curse when Jesus
[1:37:30] comes those that live under a curse are
[1:37:33] set free well you don't understand my
[1:37:34] mama did this this and this and I'm
[1:37:36] afraid that's going to follow me when
[1:37:37] Jesus comes those that have lived under
[1:37:39] a curse are set free so what I'm saying
[1:37:44] is he walked through a curse how about
[1:37:45] you let him walk through your family
[1:37:47] history one time let him walk through
[1:37:49] your cursed flesh one time let him come
[1:37:51] down there and see what he'll redeem in
[1:37:53] your life and in your family in your
[1:37:54] home because when Jesus walks through
[1:37:56] the cursed place
[1:37:58] those that live under the curse are
[1:38:00] redeemed and they're set free and and
[1:38:03] here he is
[1:38:04] Jesus is doing the impossible
[1:38:07] and we're going to go into that in just
[1:38:09] a second
[1:38:10] in an impossible place
[1:38:12] but he was doing it for people who were
[1:38:14] willing to go beyond the Press
[1:38:16] willing to press through willing to
[1:38:18] fight willing to cry out willing to lay
[1:38:20] it all down
[1:38:21] and as we said earlier your response to
[1:38:23] Jesus has as much to do with the outcome
[1:38:25] of the story as him coming by your way
[1:38:28] look he the Rich Young Ruler had an
[1:38:30] encounter with Jesus just as intimate if
[1:38:33] not more so than Zacchaeus
[1:38:36] what good did it do him
[1:38:40] I'll get personal and this isn't towards
[1:38:43] anyone but think within yourself
[1:38:45] you've had opportunity after opportunity
[1:38:47] at encounters with Jesus in this place
[1:38:51] much less in your personal private time
[1:38:53] I'm talking about just in here
[1:38:55] and I asked you to ask yourself
[1:38:57] what good did it do
[1:39:00] did I take advantage of the encounter
[1:39:04] that I respond the way I was supposed to
[1:39:08] respond to get all I needed out of that
[1:39:11] encounter
[1:39:13] your response to Jesus determines the
[1:39:16] outcome of your story
[1:39:20] it says and he made haste and came down
[1:39:22] and received him joyfully
[1:39:24] notice the joy that he's expressing with
[1:39:27] this opportunity to be with Jesus versus
[1:39:30] the sadness which the Rich Young Ruler
[1:39:33] had just one chapter before and that's
[1:39:36] what's incredible about these two
[1:39:37] stories and we're fixing to bring a
[1:39:38] little parallels we bring these down the
[1:39:40] Rich Young Ruler is in Luke 18.
[1:39:43] and he left with sadness because of his
[1:39:46] opportunity
[1:39:48] whereas this man
[1:39:49] who I done told y'all
[1:39:51] is rich rich
[1:39:54] leaves with joy and I want you to watch
[1:39:56] as we go through the rest of this Jesus
[1:39:57] never has to tell him what to do with
[1:40:00] his Goods
[1:40:01] what to do with his what he needs to
[1:40:03] give up what he needs to do and it takes
[1:40:05] us back to this the Rich Young Ruler
[1:40:07] already knew what he was supposed to do
[1:40:09] he was hoping to get a different answer
[1:40:12] but Jesus didn't even have to tell this
[1:40:14] man because any man wanting to get right
[1:40:16] with God knew exactly what he needed to
[1:40:18] do the same way within your heart and in
[1:40:20] your situations you know what you need
[1:40:23] to do to get where you need to be with
[1:40:25] God
[1:40:27] foreign
[1:40:28] seven and when they saw it they all
[1:40:31] murmured saying that he was gone to be
[1:40:33] guessed with the man that is a sinner I
[1:40:35] don't have time to spend anything here
[1:40:36] but if we get to the place that we have
[1:40:38] issue with Christ coming and touching a
[1:40:39] sinner we need to shut the doors down
[1:40:41] and go home
[1:40:42] something ain't right
[1:40:45] when we lose our mission for the lost
[1:40:47] and for calling out for lost souls and
[1:40:49] wanting to see people weep their way to
[1:40:51] Calvary if it's been that long that we
[1:40:53] forgot what we're here to do you know
[1:40:55] the the following scripture tells us
[1:40:56] that he came to seek and say that which
[1:40:58] was lost that was the whole reason he
[1:40:59] was there and if we're him and him
[1:41:01] expressed again hello
[1:41:04] seek and save that which was lost moving
[1:41:07] on to verse 8.
[1:41:08] it says and Zacchaeus stood notice now
[1:41:11] unprompted
[1:41:14] and said unto the Lord now what he's
[1:41:16] telling is from this point forward this
[1:41:17] is going to be my behavior
[1:41:21] behold Lord the half of my goods I give
[1:41:25] to the poor now you might think well now
[1:41:28] that's not fair he told the Rich Young
[1:41:29] Ruler he had to sell everything
[1:41:32] how's he getting away with only selling
[1:41:34] half of it because he's rich rich
[1:41:35] remember so now he's just going to be
[1:41:36] rich
[1:41:40] how's that fair there's more to this
[1:41:42] story
[1:41:45] I'm going to give to the poor and if I
[1:41:47] have taken anything from any man by
[1:41:52] false accusation his entire Fortune
[1:41:55] falls under this sentence right here
[1:41:58] he kept back half from the poor to pay
[1:42:01] his debts
[1:42:03] he said I will restore that person for
[1:42:08] fold
[1:42:10] every person that I took one dollar from
[1:42:13] I'm gonna give them four dollars
[1:42:15] and you could actually find him he's
[1:42:16] going back to the Book of Exodus I
[1:42:18] believe 22 where where the law stated
[1:42:20] that if you robbed a man of a sheep or
[1:42:22] killed a man of a sheep or something
[1:42:24] like that you had to repay that man for
[1:42:26] sheep
[1:42:28] and so he's saying I'm going to repay
[1:42:29] four or four I love his repentance Jesus
[1:42:32] doesn't have to it doesn't even say sell
[1:42:33] what you got restore your debts your
[1:42:35] money's the problem Zacchaeus says I'm
[1:42:38] going to take care of this right now
[1:42:40] he says I'm gonna pay all these people
[1:42:42] but look that's a lot of people because
[1:42:43] everything he had he'd robbed from
[1:42:45] people
[1:42:46] he says I'm gonna restore fourfold
[1:42:49] that's why he didn't give it all to the
[1:42:51] poor verse 9 says after this statement
[1:42:53] and Jesus said unto him this day is
[1:42:57] salvation come to this house for so for
[1:43:00] so much as he is a son of Abraham
[1:43:02] for the son of man has come to seek and
[1:43:05] to save that which was lost it's so
[1:43:09] powerful to me that in the closing
[1:43:10] moments of time
[1:43:13] the closing moments here of the Jewish
[1:43:15] dispensation because that's when this
[1:43:17] has taken place in the final days and
[1:43:19] moments of his life
[1:43:21] he's saving
[1:43:23] he's reaching out one more opportunity
[1:43:25] great don't tell me Mercy's over don't
[1:43:28] tell me Grace is over this example right
[1:43:30] here tells me that it's not over don't
[1:43:32] give up on your sons and daughters here
[1:43:34] right here right here the chiefest of
[1:43:36] Sinners and he's reaching out at the
[1:43:38] last moment not only saving but he's
[1:43:41] saving those and listen to me that were
[1:43:44] impossible to save
[1:43:47] why are you say why are you saying that
[1:43:49] so strongly because some of you believe
[1:43:51] your child
[1:43:52] is impossible to save you may not admit
[1:43:56] that but you look at their situation
[1:43:57] sometimes you don't even pray for them
[1:43:58] because you feel like what's going on
[1:44:00] and you speak negativity and in your
[1:44:03] heart you feel like it's impossible I
[1:44:05] tell you that it was impossible for
[1:44:07] Zacchaeus
[1:44:10] let's find out how
[1:44:12] Luke 18 18.
[1:44:15] going back to the Rich Young Ruler and a
[1:44:17] certain ruler asked him saying good
[1:44:18] master
[1:44:19] what shall I do to inherit internal life
[1:44:21] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[1:44:24] me good none is good to save one that is
[1:44:26] God
[1:44:27] I'm going to skip down to verse 23. it
[1:44:29] says and when he heard this he was very
[1:44:31] sorrowful because Jesus told him to sell
[1:44:33] everything
[1:44:33] for he was very rich and when Jesus saw
[1:44:36] that he was very sorrowful he said how
[1:44:39] hardly shall they that have riches enter
[1:44:42] into the kingdom of God
[1:44:44] for it is easier for a camel to go
[1:44:46] through a needle's eye than for a rich
[1:44:49] man to enter into the kingdom of God now
[1:44:52] we can get into what this means what
[1:44:54] that means but I'll tell you that
[1:44:56] whatever you think it means it meant
[1:44:58] impossible
[1:45:00] because here's what the disciples said
[1:45:01] and they that heard it said who then can
[1:45:04] be saved
[1:45:07] they said then no one can be saved so we
[1:45:12] can take whatever we think it means but
[1:45:13] to me it's I'm just going to take it for
[1:45:15] what it says
[1:45:16] a rich man going into heaven harder to
[1:45:19] enter into than a camel through the eye
[1:45:21] of a needle so Zacchaeus who was rich
[1:45:23] rich
[1:45:25] was impossible impossible
[1:45:29] but the next verse says and he said the
[1:45:32] things which are impossible with men are
[1:45:37] possible with God he speaks
[1:45:39] impossibility and then he says but look
[1:45:42] what happens brother Joe when you take
[1:45:43] an impossible equation and add Jesus
[1:45:46] into that equation impossible suddenly
[1:45:49] equals possible he says hey this is
[1:45:52] impossible now next chapter watch me do
[1:45:55] it oh it's impossible to be healed watch
[1:45:58] me do it it's impossible for my son
[1:46:00] watch me do it it's impossible for my
[1:46:03] daughter watch me do it it's just beyond
[1:46:07] the Press it's just beyond the Press if
[1:46:10] you're willing to keep pushing keep
[1:46:12] going Jesus is there salvation is there
[1:46:16] oh it's impossible what's me do the
[1:46:21] impossible
[1:46:23] Hallelujah he's an impossible God do an
[1:46:27] impossible things
[1:46:28] Hallelujah you can stay on your feet
[1:46:31] with me musicians you can come
[1:46:36] oh you think it's too late for your
[1:46:38] child
[1:46:39] impossible in a cursed City he says
[1:46:43] watch me save Zacchaeus
[1:46:46] this day I'm coming to your house oh is
[1:46:50] there somebody says Lord I need to see
[1:46:52] you tonight come to my house I'll do
[1:46:55] whatever it takes I'll push through and
[1:46:57] do whatever whatever I have to do
[1:47:03] Church there's always going to be
[1:47:04] hindrances
[1:47:07] and there's always going to be those
[1:47:08] that turn around because of it
[1:47:11] but there's always going to be those
[1:47:12] willing to say
[1:47:14] I'm going to see Jesus
[1:47:17] I'm going to get to Jesus
[1:47:20] no matter what it takes
[1:47:22] I'm pushing past every hindrance spirit
[1:47:25] I'm not going to be hindered in my walk
[1:47:27] I'm not going to have hindrance Spirits
[1:47:29] in my home

[1:47:32] Worship

[1:47:37] he's here tonight if you're willing to
[1:47:39] do whatever it takes
[1:47:41] if you're willing to push through and
[1:47:42] say I'm not going to be stopped
[1:47:44] brother Brown says you pick up the sword
[1:47:46] see now of course you've got a hindrance
[1:47:50] you've got something that's going to
[1:47:51] duel against you
[1:47:53] that devil that disease that affliction
[1:47:56] but when you strike the tip of sword
[1:47:59] with that devil Yonder and say it's thus
[1:48:01] saith the Lord he revealed it to me I'm
[1:48:04] Healed oh my your faith don't have any
[1:48:08] hindrances then
[1:48:10] I believe I'm looking at a people that
[1:48:12] faith has been restored
[1:48:13] Faith turn back to where all things are
[1:48:16] possible
[1:48:17] they turn back to where we say Lord have
[1:48:19] your way
[1:48:20] have your way in my life have your way
[1:48:22] in my home have your way in this church
[1:48:24] and Lord if there's any part of me not
[1:48:26] surrendered Lord Lord I want to give it
[1:48:28] to you tonight
[1:48:30] Lord I'm willing to do whatever it takes
[1:48:31] to get into your presence

[1:48:39] this I've done that are you willing to
[1:48:40] do a little more are you willing to go a
[1:48:42] little further are you a little delay a
[1:48:44] little bit more of yourself down tonight

[1:48:54] that burden
[1:48:55] somebody's going to push through more
[1:48:57] than anybody else
[1:49:02] Jesus is just beyond the Press
[1:49:05] I don't doubt that your road is hard I
[1:49:06] don't doubt you've got a lot of
[1:49:07] hindrances but let me reiterate a
[1:49:10] promise that I said to you earlier

[1:49:17] he will meet your need
[1:49:21] he will meet you every time he never
[1:49:23] failed the only ones that I saw him turn
[1:49:25] away tonight were those that wasn't
[1:49:27] willing to push through
[1:49:29] those that said Jesus come meet me on my
[1:49:31] terms

[1:49:49] maybe you've been backslidden
[1:49:53] maybe you hadn't been where you need to
[1:49:54] be
[1:49:59] y'all got time for a little story
[1:50:02] it's only takes a second
[1:50:05] backsliders
[1:50:07] we need you
[1:50:10] we need you
[1:50:13] we need you to come back and take your
[1:50:14] place and
[1:50:16] hold the line with us
[1:50:20] we got a big battles coming ahead the
[1:50:23] last final battles we need every man we
[1:50:24] can get on the line
[1:50:26] sword in hand musket
[1:50:30] in 1863 right before the Battle of
[1:50:32] Gettysburg there was a man by the name
[1:50:33] of Joshua Chamberlain who was in charge
[1:50:35] of the 20th Maine and
[1:50:37] he didn't know Gettysburg was fixing to
[1:50:39] happen it was a couple days before the
[1:50:40] battle and he was delivered 120
[1:50:42] deserters
[1:50:44] I actually wrote it down one time as I
[1:50:45] was just writing some things about him
[1:50:47] and I wrote down 120.
[1:50:49] that saved the nation
[1:50:52] they were deserters they had quit on the
[1:50:54] army
[1:50:55] they had walked away they had turned
[1:50:57] their backs they were no longer fighting
[1:50:58] they were good men but they felt like we
[1:51:00] fought long enough we've been wounded
[1:51:02] enough we've lost enough comrades what's
[1:51:03] this war all about is it ever going to
[1:51:05] end and they just said we're not
[1:51:06] fighting no more
[1:51:07] we're not fighting no more
[1:51:10] and now I agreed not to fight anymore
[1:51:11] and so they were taken as mutineers
[1:51:13] traitors and their
[1:51:15] because the armies were amassed and they
[1:51:16] didn't have time to prosecute on those
[1:51:18] kind of things and they brought them to
[1:51:19] Joshua Chamberlain they said we need you
[1:51:20] to guard these men because they're main
[1:51:22] men
[1:51:23] and we give you full Authority if they
[1:51:25] try to leave to shoot them dead on the
[1:51:27] spot
[1:51:29] so he comes and he talks to him and he
[1:51:31] says
[1:51:32] I've been given authority to shoot you
[1:51:35] that y'all are main man you know I'd
[1:51:37] never do that
[1:51:39] message Believers can we have that
[1:51:41] attitude tonight
[1:51:42] sometimes the mutineers we want to throw
[1:51:45] stuff and shoot those are believers
[1:51:48] I ain't gonna shoot at them
[1:51:50] I need them back
[1:51:53] he talks to him he says
[1:51:56] I tell you what he says you're more than
[1:51:58] welcome not to fight and you'll have a
[1:51:59] fair trial when this is all over
[1:52:02] I don't wanna
[1:52:03] there's a trial when this is all over
[1:52:04] like that
[1:52:05] he says if I tell you what
[1:52:08] if you're willing to pick that musket up
[1:52:10] again I'll give it back to you
[1:52:13] he says I feel like there's some big
[1:52:14] battles in the days ahead
[1:52:18] and I feel like that if you'd be willing
[1:52:19] to stand up right now and take up arms
[1:52:21] with us again
[1:52:22] all will be forgiven
[1:52:27] oh you're backsliding all your wondering
[1:52:29] all your falling down he says oh that'll
[1:52:31] be forgiven
[1:52:33] 114 out of the 120 took him up on the
[1:52:36] spot
[1:52:37] because they could follow a man like
[1:52:38] that
[1:52:41] and then three days later at the Battle
[1:52:42] a little round top the other six
[1:52:44] redeemed themselves too
[1:52:46] and that was the turning point of the
[1:52:48] whole War as the the union line began to
[1:52:50] break and they began to break and they
[1:52:53] would have
[1:52:55] in the entire War have been lost
[1:52:57] if it wouldn't have been for the extra
[1:52:59] strength of 120 backsliders that came
[1:53:01] back
[1:53:02] and picked up arms again because
[1:53:04] somebody just said come on back no hard
[1:53:07] feelings
[1:53:08] Jesus saying come on back we got some
[1:53:10] big battles up ahead I don't know what's
[1:53:12] coming around the curb but there's some
[1:53:13] big ones coming the final one's coming
[1:53:15] the battle to win all battles
[1:53:18] and this may not even be for those in
[1:53:19] this church if you're if you're not back
[1:53:21] to the net God bless you I'm glad
[1:53:23] but whoever's hearing this I'm saying we
[1:53:25] need you
[1:53:26] we want you
[1:53:28] come on back I was forgiven you ain't
[1:53:31] got to worry about me anyway it's him
[1:53:32] and he's saying all's forgiven just pick
[1:53:34] your sword up one more time get back
[1:53:36] into battle one more time hold the line
[1:53:38] with us one more time because the final
[1:53:39] attack's coming and I want to remind him
