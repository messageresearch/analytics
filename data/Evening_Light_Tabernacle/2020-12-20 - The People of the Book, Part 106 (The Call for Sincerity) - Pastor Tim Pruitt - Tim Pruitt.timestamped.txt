[20:22] a lot to talk to the lord about i know
[20:24] if we ask for hands today
[20:26] it'd be hands lifted up all over this
[20:28] building but you know in the middle of
[20:30] prayer in the middle of needs
[20:32] there's always something to thank god
[20:34] for
[20:35] amen i know the devil always wants to
[20:37] point at our sicknesses or our problems
[20:39] and
[20:40] you know and make it a negative thing
[20:41] it's not a negative thing it's only an
[20:43] opportunity
[20:44] for god to operate for god to come on
[20:47] the scene and we
[20:48] saw that very wonderfully and it done in
[20:50] our church
[20:51] many times but today we want to remind
[20:54] the church and remind the people of god
[20:58] of god's unfailing promises and this
[21:01] healing power
[21:02] amen sister atlanta said she just had
[21:04] her
[21:06] first pet scan in a year and a half i've
[21:09] been doing labs before that the scan was
[21:11] perfect
[21:12] my blood work was perfect doctor says
[21:15] i'm doing wonderful
[21:18] [Music]
[21:20] yesterday was three years exactly since
[21:23] i found out i had lymphoma
[21:26] what a mighty god we serve well my if
[21:29] god can do that for cancer and none of
[21:31] these we read was
[21:32] anything too hard for him amen and i
[21:35] like to remind the devil of that there's
[21:37] nothing too hard for our god
[21:39] amen i might as brother joe if he'd come
[21:41] and take these knees before the lord
[21:44] let's pray together remembering these
[21:46] needs this morning
[21:59] you believe that this morning all things
[22:03] are possible
[22:04] all things are possible for them that
[22:07] believe
[22:08] if you can believe that sister atlanta
[22:10] believed sister
[22:12] karen believed as we as a church that
[22:14] believed
[22:15] nothing will stand before the believer's
[22:17] prayer
[22:18] not even cancer so let's turn our
[22:21] attention away from fears and anxieties
[22:24] and worries and stress
[22:25] and let's believe this morning let's
[22:26] bind together this morning for the needs
[22:28] that were mentioned
[22:29] because god already has the answer in
[22:32] place
[22:33] he's just looking for somebody to take
[22:34] him at his word and believe
[22:36] so father we just come before your
[22:38] throne this morning
[22:39] and lord and we bow our heads in
[22:41] appreciation and respect
[22:43] because lord we're able to approach the
[22:45] throne of mercy
[22:46] and you would tell us in your word
[22:48] father that that we as a people can find
[22:50] hope we can find help in our time of
[22:53] need and we're we approach your throne
[22:55] this morning to give our adoration and
[22:57] our praise
[22:58] in order in our our our songs of
[23:00] deliverance to you this morning father
[23:02] we just want to rejoice in the goodness
[23:04] of god and though there may be a long
[23:06] list of prayer
[23:07] as brother timothy said father we have
[23:10] so much to be thankful for
[23:11] lord think about the body of christ that
[23:13] is assembled right here this morning
[23:15] lord there's churches around the nation
[23:17] around the world who are not able to
[23:19] assemble themselves together
[23:21] lord there's other churches that may be
[23:23] assembling but they don't quite have the
[23:25] faith to believe
[23:26] and yet lord we're a church that i
[23:28] believe we're a church that takes god at
[23:30] his word this morning
[23:31] and for every request that was mentioned
[23:34] brother gary god is
[23:35] he underwent a sixth bypass lord we're
[23:38] asking this morning
[23:39] that you just bring a speedy recovery
[23:42] and a great touch in his body
[23:43] and lord we thank you for brother dennis
[23:45] and sister diane as they
[23:47] overcome the cobra 19 and we continue to
[23:49] pray for

[23:52] sister mary as maria as they continue to
[23:55] to recuperate from this and brother
[23:57] stephen fraser lord and the
[23:59] the hollis and brother jason watkins in
[24:01] his church
[24:02] so many needs god but you're a great god
[24:04] this morning and we're just gonna
[24:06] believe this morning lord
[24:07] for the supernatural we're gonna believe
[24:10] god you're gonna do something at the
[24:11] evening time
[24:12] that you've done many times before and
[24:14] our eyes become open and we can see who
[24:16] jesus
[24:17] is what jesus does and what he wants to
[24:19] do today
[24:20] so we're asking father for every need
[24:22] that was mentioned this morning
[24:24] may your holy spirit drop down even now
[24:27] father and begin to move begin to touch
[24:29] begin to administer healing and
[24:31] deliverance god may you just come on the
[24:33] scene today
[24:35] come on the scene today in a mighty way
[24:37] god we're under expectation
[24:39] for the movement of the spirit lord
[24:41] we're here today assemble together
[24:44] to see christ to see the power of god
[24:47] in display not just the mechanics of the
[24:50] word
[24:51] but the dynamics married to the
[24:53] mechanics and see the supernatural
[24:56] perform what it says it will perform
[24:58] lord you told your prophet if you can
[25:00] get the people to believe
[25:02] nothing would stand before their prayer
[25:05] and lord i just want to say this morning
[25:07] not even cancer not even high blood
[25:09] pressure
[25:10] not even c diff not even uh whatever
[25:13] heart
[25:14] troubles or whatever it may be this
[25:15] morning nothing will stand before the
[25:18] believer's prayer
[25:19] and we believe this morning father that
[25:22] whatever things we
[25:23] ask in your name you said we can have it
[25:27] so lord according to your word and our
[25:29] faith this morning
[25:30] may you just meet every need every hand
[25:33] that was lifted may you meet every
[25:35] heart's cry this morning

[59:08] at it and
[59:09] and a little brother and his family
[59:12] uh from down in south africa they're
[59:14] taking heart today because they see
[59:17] young people that are living for god

[59:25] and we got so much to be thankful for
[59:29] you know sometimes you may look out
[59:31] there and you may see
[59:32] one or two or somebody struggling along

[59:38] young people that are
[59:39] solid that love god and wants to do
[59:43] right
[59:44] and are progressing in the grace of god
[59:47] amen so god bless you it's so good to be
[59:50] together this morning let's turn back to
[59:52] john 14 and verse 12.
[59:54] i want to read from there this morning
[59:57] and
[59:58] as we're looking there i want to just
[1:00:00] remind you
[1:00:01] that that this is the message of the
[1:00:04] church
[1:00:05] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:00:08] and forever
[1:00:09] performing the same works doing the same
[1:00:12] things that jesus
[1:00:13] did and that's the message of the church
[1:00:16] if the church isn't teaching that
[1:00:19] it's teaching some false theology but
[1:00:22] that's what jesus commanded them to
[1:00:24] preach
[1:00:26] so here we're going right here to this
[1:00:28] john 14
[1:00:29] 12. as the prophet said this is what we
[1:00:32] were commanded to preach
[1:00:35] and he says verily verily i say unto you
[1:00:38] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:00:41] do shall he do
[1:00:42] also and greater works than thee shall
[1:00:44] he
[1:00:45] do because i go to my father
[1:00:48] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[1:00:51] that will i do
[1:00:52] that the father may be glorified in the
[1:00:55] sun
[1:00:56] if you ask anything in my name i
[1:00:59] will do it what a wonderful word's a
[1:01:02] promise
[1:01:03] amen now you know to be able to ask in
[1:01:06] his name that's not just a
[1:01:07] talisman or a good world good luck charm
[1:01:10] or a good luck
[1:01:11] words in order to use the name of jesus
[1:01:15] you got to be born into his family amen
[1:01:19] so if we ask anything in
[1:01:22] my father's name that he in my name i
[1:01:26] will do it this is what he made the
[1:01:28] promise for
[1:01:29] now then of course we want to
[1:01:32] um look also in the mark 11
[1:01:36] 21 and peter
[1:01:39] calling to remembrance speaking of the
[1:01:42] of the victory
[1:01:43] master behold the victory which thou
[1:01:45] curse us
[1:01:46] is withered away in jesus answer and
[1:01:48] said unto them have faith in god
[1:01:51] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[1:01:54] shall say to this mountain
[1:01:56] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:01:58] the sea
[1:01:59] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:02:02] shall believe that those things which he
[1:02:04] saith shall come to pass
[1:02:06] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:02:08] therefore i say unto you
[1:02:09] what things soever you desire when you
[1:02:12] pray believe that you receive them
[1:02:15] and you shall have them amen god bless
[1:02:18] his word god bless you as you're seated
[1:02:21] i'm going to be speaking today on the
[1:02:23] call
[1:02:25] for sincerity and you know we have
[1:02:29] read some very powerful words in the
[1:02:31] scripture
[1:02:32] very challenging words in the scripture
[1:02:35] and they are words that we learn that
[1:02:39] and that is our message that we must be
[1:02:42] projecting and portraying to the world
[1:02:45] that
[1:02:45] we are living in and then we we also
[1:02:49] know that the works of christ
[1:02:51] are to be magnified as he said
[1:02:55] that greater than these shall you do for
[1:02:58] i go to my father
[1:03:00] and so they they are magnified by the
[1:03:03] power
[1:03:04] of creation the voice of a redeemed son
[1:03:08] standing under the blood of jesus christ
[1:03:12] knowing his position led by the holy
[1:03:15] ghost the father
[1:03:17] given him the words to say
[1:03:20] now you know under the blood of bulls
[1:03:22] and goats
[1:03:23] we we see moses striking the dust and
[1:03:26] calling for lice
[1:03:28] and he took that dust made lice out of
[1:03:30] it
[1:03:31] and jesus took fish and he pulled
[1:03:34] more fish to make more fish and bread to
[1:03:37] make
[1:03:38] more bread but he challenges our faith
[1:03:42] in this end time to believe the greater
[1:03:45] works
[1:03:46] amen a man of creating things out of
[1:03:50] nothing because this is what god has
[1:03:52] done
[1:03:53] in our generation just you know he
[1:03:56] showed us the display of his power to
[1:03:59] challenge our faith to believe
[1:04:02] because um we're the generation now
[1:04:06] that will see the dead in christ to rise
[1:04:10] amen where that we we will call
[1:04:13] and they will come forth even as
[1:04:16] the voice of the son of man will be
[1:04:18] resounded
[1:04:20] through his body upon the earth the
[1:04:22] bride of christ
[1:04:24] and so we know then that these works
[1:04:27] that i
[1:04:28] do shall you do also and even greater
[1:04:30] than this
[1:04:31] shall you do it'll be magnified
[1:04:35] so again it's a magnification
[1:04:39] of um of what what he even done when he
[1:04:43] was here on the earth is the greater
[1:04:45] magnification of what the old testament
[1:04:48] prophets did
[1:04:49] so and we must know that creative
[1:04:52] work belongs in the church of jesus
[1:04:56] christ
[1:04:57] and that awesome to know that creative
[1:04:59] work
[1:05:00] belongs in the church of jesus christ
[1:05:03] now i'm going to just share with you
[1:05:05] a description of the holy ghost field
[1:05:08] son or daughter of god and that is just
[1:05:11] chock full of the holy ghost walking in
[1:05:14] harmony with the will of god now
[1:05:16] you know just uh just a touch of god is
[1:05:20] omnipotent
[1:05:21] amen there's no weak spots or heavy
[1:05:23] little big heavy spots in god the very
[1:05:25] smallest
[1:05:26] touch of god is omnipotent
[1:05:29] and when you have jesus on the inside of
[1:05:31] you
[1:05:32] then then that is omnipotent power
[1:05:36] it's a resource that is not far away in
[1:05:39] the heavens but
[1:05:40] right here within you and
[1:05:43] we must learn as believers to operate
[1:05:47] because we are a two-part being we are
[1:05:50] first born a human being second we are
[1:05:52] second
[1:05:53] born sons and daughters of god and so
[1:05:56] it takes a it's it must be now in our
[1:05:59] converted
[1:06:01] state that we're in that we
[1:06:04] we stay in contact with the holy spirit
[1:06:08] that's on the inside of us
[1:06:10] to be led by the holy ghost
[1:06:14] and this is what god will have in this
[1:06:16] end time is men and
[1:06:18] women led by the spirit directed by the
[1:06:22] holy ghost
[1:06:23] so here's a description of a holy ghost
[1:06:25] field son or daughter of god and this
[1:06:27] is from god hiding himself in simplicity
[1:06:30] he said the blood
[1:06:31] of jesus so thoroughly cleanses
[1:06:35] that there's no more nothing
[1:06:38] amen that the complete word of god
[1:06:42] rests within them that the very
[1:06:46] command of their own voice is creative
[1:06:49] power
[1:06:50] because in them is the holy ghost
[1:06:53] and this holy ghost is a creator he
[1:06:56] makes things
[1:06:57] comes to pass because he speaks the word
[1:07:00] and the
[1:07:01] word spoken becomes god in action
[1:07:05] now this don't happen at the whim of our
[1:07:08] human spirit
[1:07:09] but this happens only by the impulse
[1:07:13] of the holy ghost but a man to think of
[1:07:16] it
[1:07:16] a man under the blood of jesus christ so
[1:07:19] filled with the spirit and can yield to
[1:07:21] that spirit
[1:07:22] until god can use their voice
[1:07:26] to move mountains so he yielded until
[1:07:30] god actually takes a hold of the
[1:07:33] vocal cords of a man and speaks through
[1:07:36] him
[1:07:36] now this is what we this is what we saw
[1:07:39] in fact of the matter when i was just a
[1:07:41] young boy
[1:07:42] in brother branham's meeting and seeing
[1:07:44] the hearts discerned and
[1:07:46] people's names called and who they were
[1:07:48] and where they were from and what their
[1:07:50] situation was i knew that was not a man
[1:07:52] with that knowledge
[1:07:54] i knew that was that was that was
[1:07:57] god a great power that was revealing
[1:08:01] those things
[1:08:02] that it wasn't this was beyond human
[1:08:05] capabilities but god was actually
[1:08:08] using the vocal cords of a man
[1:08:11] to be able to discern the thoughts and
[1:08:14] the inches of heart accurately
[1:08:16] time not just once but time after time
[1:08:19] after time without any error at all amen
[1:08:24] now of course as i said this does not
[1:08:27] happen at the whim of our human spirit
[1:08:31] it has to
[1:08:32] happen by the impulse of the holy ghost
[1:08:35] i i'd like to see some you know us live
[1:08:38] in a higher realm where we are
[1:08:40] we are acting under the impulse
[1:08:44] of the holy ghost not so much by human
[1:08:47] nature or human desire or
[1:08:49] human compassion even but where the holy
[1:08:52] spirit is directing the words that we
[1:08:55] are speaking
[1:08:57] now that's what i'm talking about an end
[1:08:58] time people now brother bradham told us
[1:09:01] as soon as he can get his church in
[1:09:03] speaking conditions
[1:09:05] to a place where he can flow through and
[1:09:08] love and persuade
[1:09:10] and fellowship then there are coming
[1:09:12] eden
[1:09:13] amen he'll take his church back to where
[1:09:16] it left him
[1:09:17] back to an eden where it fell the eden
[1:09:20] is where it made its first star to fall
[1:09:22] and that's where to be taken
[1:09:23] right back with a clean slate of
[1:09:26] redemption
[1:09:28] and this is where we're at we're we're
[1:09:30] right on the very edge
[1:09:34] of going from mortal to immortality
[1:09:37] it's a wonderful hour that we're living
[1:09:39] in and sometimes
[1:09:41] i think we don't fully grasp because
[1:09:44] satan has so designed his age to be so
[1:09:48] full of of every kind of nonsense and
[1:09:51] things of of the of um this
[1:09:54] life and we're we're over burdened the
[1:09:57] bible
[1:09:58] said that that we would be our hearts
[1:10:00] would be overcharged
[1:10:02] with sophiety and drunkenness so
[1:10:05] drunk on this world and its ways until
[1:10:09] we're out of touch with god that's what
[1:10:11] its design
[1:10:12] is i think of it you know even as this
[1:10:16] thing has come through
[1:10:17] of this coveted 19 and hitting our
[1:10:20] nation not just our nation but
[1:10:22] nations around the world are suffering
[1:10:24] today and
[1:10:25] churches have not been able to meet some
[1:10:27] of them not been able to meet since this
[1:10:29] thing began
[1:10:30] we're very blessed people today amen
[1:10:33] we're very blessed people that we can
[1:10:35] meet the way we are
[1:10:37] amen but but many of them are forbidden
[1:10:40] by law to do so
[1:10:42] and they're they're not able to meet as
[1:10:44] we are meeting this morning
[1:10:46] but satan has so designed that as i as i
[1:10:49] passed by the little
[1:10:51] um little baptist church on the corner
[1:10:54] today again was
[1:10:55] running a little bit late so it was even
[1:10:57] closer to what their
[1:10:58] scheduled service time not one car in
[1:11:01] their parking lot
[1:11:02] nobody's assembled together for months
[1:11:06] and you know this is satan's design
[1:11:11] and you can see it's destroying the
[1:11:13] faith
[1:11:14] of many and and many are becoming very
[1:11:17] cold even even the secular
[1:11:21] christians that were church goers and
[1:11:23] people of righteousness are
[1:11:25] are becoming very very cold and distant
[1:11:29] toward god and the things of god because
[1:11:32] they have been unable to worship
[1:11:35] together
[1:11:36] you know and and yet we were told to
[1:11:39] worship
[1:11:40] together even so much the more as we see
[1:11:43] that day approaching
[1:11:45] but satan of course says he's about to
[1:11:48] as he
[1:11:49] is he is about to enter in completely
[1:11:52] and fully into this
[1:11:54] dimension as the bride leaves remember
[1:11:56] we're the ones holding him off
[1:11:58] the righteousness of god's people is
[1:12:00] holding him back
[1:12:02] but then he who letteth will let until
[1:12:04] he be taken out of the way and
[1:12:06] then the the man of sin will be revealed
[1:12:09] the son of perdition
[1:12:10] so we're living right here on the the
[1:12:14] very custo
[1:12:15] of eden can you imagine ready to go from
[1:12:18] mortal to immortality ready to
[1:12:22] go to to meet right here on the earth to
[1:12:25] meet right here on the earth
[1:12:27] the dead in christ amen not only of our
[1:12:31] age but over other age before
[1:12:34] and that meets with the old testament
[1:12:36] states there in the great
[1:12:37] marriage supper of the lamb so you see
[1:12:41] you know this is where we are at in time
[1:12:44] and
[1:12:44] and the bible tells us in romans 8 he
[1:12:47] says
[1:12:48] all creation is groaning
[1:12:51] with travail and they're looking for
[1:12:54] the revealing or the apocalyptic
[1:12:57] the manifestations of the sons of god
[1:13:00] where sons of god will be revealed and
[1:13:03] listen to brother branham in the message
[1:13:05] adoption he said
[1:13:06] go back to genesis to the original what
[1:13:09] it is
[1:13:10] what is it and now the world and nature
[1:13:12] is grown and crying
[1:13:14] and everything's a move in what for the
[1:13:16] manifestations of the sons of god
[1:13:19] when true sons born sons
[1:13:22] field sons speak and their words are
[1:13:25] bound
[1:13:26] and i believe we're right on the border
[1:13:28] of it now
[1:13:30] yes say to this mountain let it be so
[1:13:33] and brother i desire
[1:13:34] such and so and so a certain thing to be
[1:13:37] done i'm a believer in christ
[1:13:38] i give it to you in the name of the lord
[1:13:40] jesus christ
[1:13:41] amen there's a manifestation oh brother
[1:13:44] my crops are burning up out younger i
[1:13:47] haven't had any rain
[1:13:48] i'll i'll send you rain in the name of
[1:13:51] the
[1:13:52] lord god bless your crop oh waiting
[1:13:55] groaning all nature waiting for the
[1:13:58] manifestation
[1:14:00] of the sons of god
[1:14:03] right here here we are standing
[1:14:07] and in the last age as i have been
[1:14:10] saying
[1:14:10] you know god has showed us we are on the
[1:14:13] brink
[1:14:14] of eternity we're standing right on the
[1:14:18] edge of it
[1:14:20] now you know and let me just tell you
[1:14:23] even as 2 000 years ago heaven was
[1:14:26] moving
[1:14:28] as angels were descending and voices
[1:14:32] from that other realm was coming
[1:14:35] are you with me and messages from the
[1:14:38] other realm was coming into this
[1:14:40] dimension
[1:14:41] and that was at his first coming and now
[1:14:43] we're here at his second coming
[1:14:46] and there again the supernatural
[1:14:49] must be on display amen we're
[1:14:53] angels are descending and where messages
[1:14:56] are coming
[1:14:57] and it's happened in our age
[1:15:00] amen now you know in time-tested faith
[1:15:03] brother branham said we know
[1:15:04] that man could not move a mountain just
[1:15:07] by speaking to it
[1:15:09] that the only thing that could do that
[1:15:11] would be
[1:15:12] deity so then if the mountain is before
[1:15:15] us an
[1:15:15] objective is right and our motive is
[1:15:17] right then it isn't not speaking anymore
[1:15:20] it's deed is speaking then it has to
[1:15:22] move and he said i believe the
[1:15:25] church is on the brink
[1:15:28] of one of the greatest outporns that's
[1:15:31] ever had in this age
[1:15:33] i believe it i can't say the lord has
[1:15:35] told me anybody there's just something
[1:15:36] inside of me just catching
[1:15:38] a hold of something that i haven't seen
[1:15:40] all my life till just now
[1:15:42] and how glorious it is to know that just
[1:15:44] before the coming of the lord
[1:15:46] that these things are happening
[1:15:49] again just before that he
[1:15:52] will be taken home to be with the lord
[1:15:55] he says i'm only building
[1:15:58] the hour is close at hand you're going
[1:16:00] to see something happen
[1:16:03] when something is going to take place
[1:16:06] and all this background here has been
[1:16:09] only laying a foundation
[1:16:10] for a short quick message that has
[1:16:13] shaped the whole
[1:16:14] nations what a promise that is
[1:16:18] amen we're in the age of adopted sons
[1:16:21] the sons that
[1:16:22] have been able to see their names in the
[1:16:24] book of redemption
[1:16:26] and understanding their position
[1:16:30] uh you know you say well brother tim
[1:16:32] what is
[1:16:33] what is it my position say you're a
[1:16:36] preacher
[1:16:37] you you know you're a pastor you're uh
[1:16:40] you know
[1:16:41] brother timothy is a song leader and a
[1:16:42] preacher and brother joe's a preacher
[1:16:44] and
[1:16:45] brother aaron's a preacher and sister
[1:16:47] jessica she's
[1:16:48] a great singer and and brother philip
[1:16:51] and sister mandy and all of the others
[1:16:53] they're great singers
[1:16:54] what is my position those are not
[1:16:56] positions those are gifts
[1:17:01] and amen what is my position your
[1:17:04] position is one of sonship
[1:17:10] amen by your new birth you have been
[1:17:12] placed in the body of christ
[1:17:15] and you are a son or daughter of god
[1:17:19] amen and so that is your position it's
[1:17:22] the position of
[1:17:23] sonship you are the offspring of god
[1:17:27] amen you you were born human and mortal
[1:17:30] by your first
[1:17:30] birth for whatever is born of flesh is
[1:17:33] flesh
[1:17:35] but then whatever is born of the holy
[1:17:37] spirit is spirit
[1:17:39] amen whatever is born of god is god
[1:17:42] oh my god is positioning sons
[1:17:46] in this day giving them power and
[1:17:48] authority
[1:17:50] because of his blood
[1:17:55] now and hear him he would say it this
[1:17:58] way
[1:17:58] now jesus had proven to god that he'd
[1:18:01] been the right kind of son
[1:18:03] and god took him up on the top of the
[1:18:05] mountain of transfiguration and
[1:18:07] brought witnesses out there and heavenly
[1:18:09] witnesses and earthly witnesses and he
[1:18:12] clothed him in
[1:18:13] immortality and when they looked up they
[1:18:15] said his garments shine
[1:18:17] like the sun and supernatural something
[1:18:20] was taking place
[1:18:21] and his garment glistening like the sun
[1:18:24] in the middle of the day as white as
[1:18:26] they could be and
[1:18:27] god placed on him that robe of
[1:18:30] immortality
[1:18:31] showing that he had received him and
[1:18:34] that's the same thing that god will do
[1:18:36] to his sons here on the earth someday
[1:18:39] he will call you a side church if you
[1:18:42] only obey him and stand on his word
[1:18:46] and believe it he will place into the
[1:18:48] church
[1:18:49] before the coming of jesus christ
[1:18:52] he'll place into the church all the
[1:18:54] powers
[1:18:55] that christ had in him will be in the
[1:18:58] church
[1:18:59] and all that god was he poured into
[1:19:01] jesus
[1:19:02] and all that jesus was he pours into the
[1:19:05] church
[1:19:06] god wanting his work done he sent it
[1:19:09] into his son
[1:19:10] the son is wanting his work done and he
[1:19:13] sent it to the church at that day you'll
[1:19:15] know that i'm in the father
[1:19:16] and the father in me and i knew
[1:19:19] and you and me at that day because the
[1:19:22] same power
[1:19:24] of god was in jehovah god rested in
[1:19:27] jesus christ
[1:19:28] and the same power that rested in jesus
[1:19:31] christ
[1:19:32] rest in place sons in the body of christ
[1:19:39] hallelujah now these
[1:19:42] these are i'm i'm sharing these things
[1:19:44] because i'm
[1:19:45] challenging your faith
[1:19:50] brother branham talked about the
[1:19:51] squirrels that were spoken to existence
[1:19:55] and he said god asked me to do that he
[1:19:58] told me to do that he challenged me to
[1:20:01] do it he said it was
[1:20:02] my own faith that brought squirrels into
[1:20:06] existence
[1:20:08] things that god challenged me to ask for
[1:20:12] i wonder if we can be challenged in this
[1:20:14] day
[1:20:16] to ask for a resurrection to ask for the
[1:20:20] change of the body
[1:20:22] amen come on we're divine healing is
[1:20:24] just a minor and we look at the
[1:20:26] at the real thing that god wants to
[1:20:28] bring in this day and age again and here
[1:20:32] you hear the placing of the sun take him
[1:20:34] out to a certain place have a ceremony
[1:20:36] before angels positionally place him
[1:20:38] what he is in the body of christ then
[1:20:40] that person has the authority
[1:20:42] let me say this if you kept me a fanatic
[1:20:45] from this night on
[1:20:46] that the very same thing i'm speaking up
[1:20:48] will be done
[1:20:49] there will be a power put into the
[1:20:51] church and now coming in
[1:20:53] that the holy spirit was so anoint to
[1:20:55] people till they'll speak the word
[1:20:57] and it'll create itself right there we
[1:21:00] haven't seen
[1:21:01] powers likes coming into the church now
[1:21:03] i know it for a fact
[1:21:06] because he saw it demonstrated say to
[1:21:08] this mountain be moved don't doubt in
[1:21:10] your heart but believe what you said
[1:21:12] shall come to pass you can have what you
[1:21:14] said the placing of the church in
[1:21:16] position
[1:21:17] where the fullness of the power of the
[1:21:18] holy ghost comes in the church
[1:21:21] and he says them critics mouse will be
[1:21:23] shut
[1:21:25] it'll be a short time jesus came right
[1:21:27] off the mountains and went straight to
[1:21:28] calvary notice
[1:21:29] it won't last long but it'll be there
[1:21:35] you know sometimes we just need to stop
[1:21:37] and see
[1:21:38] stop and and take note of what we are to
[1:21:41] expect
[1:21:43] set our expectations high
[1:21:46] israel in the church he said i believe
[1:21:49] we're on the borderline
[1:21:51] tonight i was wondering about all my
[1:21:52] meetings and things and i
[1:21:54] had to cancel them out i truly believe
[1:21:56] before the church can have the rapture
[1:21:59] it's got to have rapture and faith we
[1:22:01] can't have faith for divine healing let
[1:22:03] alone rapture in faith
[1:22:04] got to have a faith that'll change and
[1:22:07] quicken this
[1:22:08] body and be taken away i believe there's
[1:22:10] a church
[1:22:11] on its road tonight a power of the
[1:22:14] living god that man will speak the word
[1:22:16] here and there
[1:22:17] and it'll flash like lightning and a
[1:22:19] church is coming out
[1:22:20] not a a not a psychologist not somebody
[1:22:24] that's put on
[1:22:25] make believe but a real genuine anointed
[1:22:28] holy ghost
[1:22:29] called out church amen
[1:22:33] well hallelujah whatever age before the
[1:22:36] word demonstrated
[1:22:38] itself it was like a sword it went out
[1:22:40] in the cut
[1:22:42] you know like a flaming cutting sword
[1:22:44] you saw him today
[1:22:46] was it um was it jehovah's shama it was
[1:22:49] flashed up there
[1:22:50] where the lord of hosts means the lord
[1:22:52] of armies
[1:22:55] amen god's got an army and he's the lord
[1:22:58] over that army
[1:23:00] and he equipped us with a word to defeat
[1:23:02] the enemy with
[1:23:06] you listen church we've only done minor
[1:23:08] stuff yet
[1:23:13] you think of that we've only seen minor
[1:23:16] things yet
[1:23:17] and so what's promised in the word he
[1:23:20] said like a surgeon's
[1:23:22] knife he said that that word cut out
[1:23:24] diseases it
[1:23:25] set the captives free and everywhere the
[1:23:27] early believers went they went preaching
[1:23:29] the
[1:23:29] gospel the word and god confirmed that
[1:23:32] word was signs following
[1:23:34] the sick were healed the devils were
[1:23:35] cast out they spoke in new tongues that
[1:23:38] was the word in action
[1:23:40] and the word is never failed in the
[1:23:43] mouths of believing christians
[1:23:45] and what about now brother tim what
[1:23:48] about this last age and in this last age
[1:23:50] it is here stronger and greater in the
[1:23:53] true word bride
[1:23:56] oh little flop you little minority hold
[1:23:58] on to the word
[1:23:59] so fill your mouth and heart with it and
[1:24:02] someday
[1:24:03] god will give you the kingdom again
[1:24:06] you know he he would say these things
[1:24:08] and these are just little snippets that
[1:24:10] i'm bringing out
[1:24:11] so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man
[1:24:14] in faith takes the word into his heart
[1:24:18] and then places it upon his lips what is
[1:24:21] the
[1:24:22] same as deity speaking every mountain
[1:24:25] has to go
[1:24:26] satan cannot stand before that man
[1:24:31] again in the last day last age that will
[1:24:35] be a group rise up
[1:24:36] the true bride of the last day and she
[1:24:39] will listen to the spirit
[1:24:41] in that day of gross darkness the light
[1:24:44] will return by the pure word
[1:24:46] and we will return to the power of
[1:24:47] pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus
[1:24:50] christ
[1:24:52] well church we we've come through a long
[1:24:55] journey
[1:24:57] i've been talking about it from some
[1:24:58] time where the church
[1:25:00] left him at pentecost and we've come and
[1:25:04] we've made some great advancements it's
[1:25:06] like
[1:25:07] science has made advancements and you
[1:25:10] know
[1:25:11] so the church has advanced you know
[1:25:14] we come through luther and wesley and
[1:25:16] the azusa street
[1:25:18] movement and luther walked in one light
[1:25:21] and
[1:25:21] wesley walked in another light and the
[1:25:24] azusa movement pentecost walked in
[1:25:26] another
[1:25:27] but we're walking on higher today and if
[1:25:30] and brother branham stopped there and he
[1:25:32] says now
[1:25:33] if it goes another generation
[1:25:36] it will go beyond us
[1:25:41] now that was 1959 so he said if it goes
[1:25:44] another generation it'll even go beyond
[1:25:46] us
[1:25:48] and he said now the age we're living in
[1:25:50] is beyond pentecost
[1:25:52] speaking of azusa movement but it's
[1:25:55] all coming forth of the holy spirit to
[1:25:58] the great
[1:25:58] churches being filled up and choke full
[1:26:01] hallelujah
[1:26:02] of the great powers of almighty god
[1:26:04] until it's got to a place
[1:26:06] until the very works that jesus has has
[1:26:09] done has been manifest right here in the
[1:26:12] church now
[1:26:13] we're close friends again
[1:26:17] he says you know
[1:26:20] satan has been coming in it's been
[1:26:22] getting darker and
[1:26:23] more evil but he says
[1:26:26] when we need it god raised the standard
[1:26:31] amen what is it he's pouring in his
[1:26:34] spirit now get the picture church
[1:26:37] it's an outpouring it's a refilling
[1:26:40] hey man it's a it's a it's a given out
[1:26:43] of the holy spirit he said i'll pour out
[1:26:45] my spirit upon all flesh
[1:26:48] he's been doing it too you know
[1:26:50] throughout the ages
[1:26:52] and and he's been pouring it was a jib
[1:26:54] poured out with luther and a greater dip
[1:26:56] with wesley and a greater dip
[1:26:57] with you in the azusa street but we're
[1:26:59] in the day where he
[1:27:01] empties it out
[1:27:06] amen now it's
[1:27:09] god it's god manifests himself
[1:27:13] in a people and he says he said that
[1:27:16] he's pouring in his spirit and those
[1:27:18] resting out in the grave are under the
[1:27:20] altar of god as the scripture said are
[1:27:22] crying
[1:27:23] how long lord how long how much longer
[1:27:26] let me stop there just for a moment
[1:27:28] and i want to remind you when brother
[1:27:30] branham went beyond the curtain of time
[1:27:33] that he heard the voices coming in first
[1:27:37] keep pressing the battle
[1:27:41] you don't know what lays at the end of
[1:27:43] the road
[1:27:46] you don't see the joys that are ahead
[1:27:49] keep pressing the battle keep pressing
[1:27:51] on
[1:27:54] now and he said they're there
[1:27:58] in fact to the matter is they were
[1:28:00] anxious
[1:28:02] to come back they would say to him you
[1:28:04] know when he said
[1:28:05] they said we're going to go back one day
[1:28:07] and we're going to take on our bodies
[1:28:09] again
[1:28:10] and we we will we we don't eat or sleep
[1:28:13] now
[1:28:14] but we'll eat then and he said well take
[1:28:17] up our bodies
[1:28:18] and they they were longing for that time
[1:28:25] i want you to understand they were under
[1:28:27] anticipation
[1:28:29] there was a longing in them there was
[1:28:32] something that was calling them for the
[1:28:36] completion of redemption
[1:28:39] you said brother tim they're fully
[1:28:41] redeemed no they're not they have they
[1:28:42] have been redeemed by the blood
[1:28:44] they are there in theophany bodies i'm
[1:28:46] talking about the dead saints
[1:28:48] they are there in theophany bodies but
[1:28:50] they are waiting on their bodies to be
[1:28:52] redeemed
[1:28:54] amen for them to be changed in a mortal
[1:28:56] and a twinkling of an eye
[1:28:58] and they are longing for that
[1:29:03] now so he's pressing his spirit and
[1:29:06] those
[1:29:06] resting out you under the grave under
[1:29:08] the altar of god or christ how long lord
[1:29:11] how long how much longer what brother if
[1:29:14] that's where they're crying
[1:29:16] and they're at ease and peace come on
[1:29:20] yet what about how we ought to be this
[1:29:22] morning it ought to be screaming out in
[1:29:24] us amen how much longer lord
[1:29:29] amen how long how much longer you see
[1:29:32] there ought to be a real
[1:29:34] sincerity and a dedication looking
[1:29:36] toward the promise
[1:29:39] amen he says god is waiting on me and
[1:29:42] you
[1:29:43] oh now we come right down to it they're
[1:29:46] waiting on us
[1:29:48] the church is waiting on me and you
[1:29:50] adoption time when god can pour
[1:29:52] out into us his fullness his power
[1:29:56] his resurrection that when the church
[1:29:58] and christ become
[1:30:00] so close together until christ becomes
[1:30:02] visible among us
[1:30:04] and raises the dead and we go in the
[1:30:06] rapture
[1:30:08] amen now so everyone that we've seen
[1:30:12] every move of god before has been a
[1:30:14] deeper breath of god
[1:30:17] it's been a more a greater breath
[1:30:20] of the spirit as he breathed you know
[1:30:23] remember
[1:30:24] jesus would breathe on his disciples
[1:30:26] before pentecost and
[1:30:28] he would say receive ye the holy ghost
[1:30:30] he'd breathe upon the breath of god
[1:30:33] this breath becomes a mighty rushing
[1:30:35] wind on the day of pentecost
[1:30:38] is that right and it filled them where
[1:30:40] they were sitting
[1:30:42] now we're also been promised you know
[1:30:45] again the return
[1:30:46] back the faith of the children turned
[1:30:50] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:30:52] are you with me and the holy spirit has
[1:30:54] been moving and there's been a breath
[1:30:57] it was the breath of god upon luther and
[1:31:00] a little better and greater blow
[1:31:02] up on wesley and a deeper blow up on
[1:31:05] azusa street
[1:31:06] but now he says the breath and the
[1:31:08] spirit has become the same
[1:31:11] and she's uniting together and bringing
[1:31:14] forth that same blow of the holy ghost
[1:31:16] like he did back there
[1:31:18] is manifesting the same works that he
[1:31:20] did back there
[1:31:21] is being manifested right today the same
[1:31:23] thing what
[1:31:24] jesus said verily verily i say to you
[1:31:27] the son can do nothing
[1:31:28] except he sees the father do it first
[1:31:30] what the father does he shows the son
[1:31:32] the father dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:31:35] works
[1:31:37] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:31:40] you
[1:31:41] ask what you will because you're asking
[1:31:44] his word

[1:33:02] sitting in a
[1:33:03] three million dollar building without a

[1:33:26] shall
[1:33:26] have them i want to you to remember that
[1:33:29] this
[1:33:30] church this building this this place
[1:33:32] right here
[1:33:33] was was it happened on an account of
[1:33:36] brother gary stanky
[1:33:37] was there in the hospital room dying
[1:33:41] three weeks without nourishment or food
[1:33:43] unable to digest
[1:33:45] anything and was in dying until demons
[1:33:48] were coming into the room
[1:33:50] howling and threatening him and we
[1:33:52] walked in there that day
[1:33:55] and i pulled up a chair right by him
[1:33:57] because i said
[1:33:58] gary stanky is a saint of god and the
[1:34:01] devil has no business tormenting him if
[1:34:03] god's taken him that's fine
[1:34:06] and then he's past 70. you know god's
[1:34:08] taking him that's okay you know
[1:34:10] blessed uh and the side of the lord the
[1:34:12] death of his saints
[1:34:14] man we don't see him go but i mean if
[1:34:16] he's going he's the saint of god but i'm
[1:34:18] not going to let devils torment him
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:22] amen i'm not going to allow that to
[1:34:24] happen and i walked in there that day
[1:34:26] there
[1:34:27] pulled up a chair by him and you know
[1:34:30] he has his testimony was he said my
[1:34:33] faith was like an
[1:34:34] anchor and it was like dragging the
[1:34:36] bottom it was bumping here and bumping
[1:34:39] there and just couldn't get a hold
[1:34:42] but there in a moment's time
[1:34:46] as he come down to the jets of sincerity
[1:34:52] and when you know he's always been a
[1:34:54] sincere man i would say
[1:34:56] very sincere dedicated christian long
[1:34:59] time
[1:34:59] christian but one of the finest of the
[1:35:02] finest
[1:35:03] you'll not find a better man to watch in
[1:35:05] shoe leather than gary stanky
[1:35:08] christian all the way to the heart
[1:35:10] through the soul
[1:35:12] and there are a man that you know loves
[1:35:15] the lord and loves god
[1:35:17] a wonderful man but he reached a
[1:35:20] level of sincerity that he had never
[1:35:23] tapped into and in that moment there is
[1:35:27] he shared with me his heart
[1:35:29] the holy spirit came down and healed him
[1:35:32] and by that evening or at least by early
[1:35:35] the next day
[1:35:36] he was eating jello and back on the way
[1:35:39] to recovery
[1:35:41] amen why was it because it was
[1:35:44] it was that depth of sincerity and i'm
[1:35:47] i'm reminding you church
[1:35:49] this is our foundation here and
[1:35:52] when a man reaches a depth of sincerity
[1:36:01] things that was on his heart then was to
[1:36:02] have a place
[1:36:04] that we could meet more that people from
[1:36:06] who traveled
[1:36:07] in could could rest and be and we have
[1:36:10] all of that the whole facilities and
[1:36:12] even more because god's a shady eye
[1:36:17] he's more than enough
[1:36:21] he was able to do exceeding above
[1:36:24] whatsoever we could think or even ask
[1:36:28] i'll be honest with you i mean i was
[1:36:29] willing to do with with gravel parking
[1:36:32] lots
[1:36:33] i was willing to do anything well you
[1:36:35] know without any frills or whistles just
[1:36:37] to get in without debt
[1:36:39] i didn't want any debt i didn't want to
[1:36:41] enslave you or put you in bondage
[1:36:45] amen although somebody you know wrote me
[1:36:47] a nasty email and told me i was pharaoh
[1:36:50] and putting all the
[1:36:51] men and the women in bondage and so on
[1:36:53] like that and
[1:36:54] whatever else but god shut their mouth
[1:36:56] and gave you the building anyway
[1:36:57] debt free
[1:37:02] anyway but you see what was it it was we
[1:37:06] we have seen the manifestations we have
[1:37:09] seen what
[1:37:10] god will do
[1:37:13] and we see that where we're at we are
[1:37:16] built on that
[1:37:17] very principle of sincerity
[1:37:20] reaching a depth of sincerity
[1:37:28] as i said you know he he asked for those
[1:37:31] things
[1:37:32] that were that it was shared as hard as
[1:37:34] some things that was needed for the
[1:37:36] church and where we were located we
[1:37:37] couldn't provide it we had
[1:37:39] we were out of space everything and god
[1:37:41] just took
[1:37:42] and put it in our hands had this
[1:37:45] property right here
[1:37:46] put it in our hands we offered a lower
[1:37:49] price for this place and the man said i
[1:37:51] got greater i'll offer
[1:37:52] but this is what i want my father's land
[1:37:54] to go to i feel good about this i'm
[1:37:56] giving you the
[1:37:57] the piece of property and god provided
[1:38:00] it for us amen he gave it with some
[1:38:03] money but
[1:38:03] anyway it was given anyway
[1:38:08] we won the contract and look what god
[1:38:11] has done
[1:38:12] look what he has provided
[1:38:15] are you with me amen but you see again
[1:38:18] you know if you abide in me and my words
[1:38:21] in you
[1:38:22] ask what you will because you're asking
[1:38:24] his word
[1:38:25] and his word is life speak it
[1:38:29] if god said it you're sure he said it
[1:38:32] and the holy spirit spares witness that
[1:38:34] the word is right
[1:38:35] then there you are brother speak it
[1:38:37] there is say to this mountain
[1:38:39] be moved don't doubt in your hearts but
[1:38:42] believe that that which you have said
[1:38:45] and it's going to come to pass it's not
[1:38:47] you that speaketh but the father that
[1:38:48] dwelleth in you
[1:38:49] he doeth the talking it's not you
[1:38:51] talking to that mountain
[1:38:53] it's the father that's in you speaking
[1:38:55] to that mountain
[1:38:57] it has to move and all heavens and earth
[1:39:00] will pass away
[1:39:01] but he said my my word shall not pass
[1:39:04] away
[1:39:04] it's certainly it cannot pass away again
[1:39:08] as he would say you know what is the
[1:39:11] holy ghost
[1:39:12] it's god in you what's it for
[1:39:15] to continue his work among his people
[1:39:18] to bring the church together i want to
[1:39:21] get it to you
[1:39:22] if you receive the holy ghost it's not
[1:39:25] just for you
[1:39:26] to sit down occupy pew and be a good
[1:39:28] church member
[1:39:30] amen but it's that god can continue
[1:39:33] his work among his people
[1:39:38] that's the purpose of god giving you the
[1:39:40] holy spirit in your life
[1:39:42] amen that he might bring the church to a
[1:39:45] place in this day
[1:39:46] far beyond lutheran methodist and jesus
[1:39:49] street pentecost
[1:39:50] into a place to adoption and a raptured
[1:39:54] grace that when this part of the church
[1:39:58] when the spirit moves into this church
[1:40:01] here
[1:40:02] are you with me when the spirit moves in
[1:40:05] this church here
[1:40:08] are you ready to avoid to move
[1:40:12] amen for the outpouring of the holy
[1:40:14] spirit for him to finish his work to
[1:40:17] pour it out
[1:40:19] when it moves in this church here it'll
[1:40:21] just raise
[1:40:23] and it'll bring forth all that's
[1:40:25] redeemed that's touched that spirit
[1:40:28] those lutheran who stood in the light
[1:40:30] that they had in justification
[1:40:32] those methodists that fell on the floor
[1:40:34] and they threw water in their face from
[1:40:35] the spirit
[1:40:36] striking them through sanctification
[1:40:38] those pentecostals who walked up and
[1:40:41] down the streets and they called them
[1:40:42] tongues demons and jabbers
[1:40:44] and goose language and all that they'll
[1:40:46] stand in the righteousness and the sight
[1:40:48] of god at that day just
[1:40:50] as certain as this bible is here if you
[1:40:52] believe me to be
[1:40:53] a servant you call me as prophet i don't
[1:40:55] call myself that but you
[1:40:57] but you listen i'm telling you in the
[1:40:59] name of the lord that those that are in
[1:41:01] christ will god bring with him that is
[1:41:03] coming
[1:41:04] at the resurrection and only those that
[1:41:06] are in christ
[1:41:13] we all remember the story of hattie
[1:41:16] wright
[1:41:18] a poor woman a widow
[1:41:21] raising two sons her husband killed in a
[1:41:24] tractor accident rolled over on him
[1:41:27] she's a widow woman trying to make a
[1:41:29] living
[1:41:30] sons you know being raised by a single
[1:41:34] mom
[1:41:35] getting rebellious in a rebellious age
[1:41:39] she had a heart and a concern for them
[1:41:43] i'll tell you what when you see your
[1:41:45] children go through things
[1:41:47] that ought to be the greatest desire
[1:41:55] amen she didn't think of a million
[1:41:57] dollars handed to her
[1:41:59] she didn't think of edith walking some
[1:42:01] temporary healing
[1:42:02] her sister who was having infantile
[1:42:05] paralysis or something like that
[1:42:07] some kind of horrible disease there it
[1:42:09] didn't she didn't think of asking for
[1:42:11] that
[1:42:13] none of that was on her mind she had one
[1:42:15] thing she was focused on
[1:42:19] and i'll tell you when we when we see
[1:42:21] our our children our young people
[1:42:23] when we see even older ones floundering
[1:42:28] it'll be the number one thing on our
[1:42:30] heart
[1:42:31] god somehow get a hold of their lives
[1:42:34] don't let them stray out there
[1:42:36] into sin and those that have bring them
[1:42:39] back in lord
[1:42:40] somehow by your grace and she was
[1:42:44] listening there
[1:42:45] as they sat around the table she was
[1:42:48] listening
[1:42:50] to brother branham talk and tell about
[1:42:52] the squirrels being created he said i
[1:42:54] just said
[1:42:55] impossible places there in that briar
[1:42:57] patch they're in the sycamore tree
[1:42:59] they're over over the impossible places
[1:43:01] where they don't go
[1:43:04] and he said there there was and i shot
[1:43:06] them
[1:43:07] we brought them home we skinned them and
[1:43:09] ate them
[1:43:13] and he said that little woman listened
[1:43:14] there she responded
[1:43:18] god's listening for your response
[1:43:22] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:43:24] brother branham
[1:43:26] and when she did that response move
[1:43:29] god on her behalf
[1:43:34] think of that and brother branham was
[1:43:37] told right then
[1:43:38] sister hattie you've said the right
[1:43:40] thing see he said you got to watch what
[1:43:42] you say
[1:43:44] and she said the right things it was
[1:43:47] what in other words she was in unity
[1:43:50] with the harmony of god
[1:43:52] with the heart of god and when she did
[1:43:55] she asked for a mountain to be removed
[1:43:59] which was her two sons rebellious
[1:44:01] teenagers
[1:44:03] and the holy spirit struck that room
[1:44:05] there as he said i'll give you your son
[1:44:07] in the name of jesus christ and they
[1:44:09] fell down repenting
[1:44:11] right there gave their hearts to god
[1:44:14] amen amen
[1:44:18] see jesus said
[1:44:21] say to this mountain i'm just showing
[1:44:24] you
[1:44:25] your mountain may not be
[1:44:28] a huge debt your mountain may not be a
[1:44:31] literal mountain
[1:44:34] your mountain may be
[1:44:38] the terrible mess you made in your
[1:44:39] family
[1:44:42] some people have built big mountains
[1:44:48] your mountain can be many many things
[1:44:53] but your mountain has got to hear you
[1:44:56] respond
[1:44:57] to the word in faith
[1:45:00] amen and and say the greatest desire i
[1:45:03] have
[1:45:05] and i wonder if you were given that
[1:45:07] opportunity what would be your greatest
[1:45:09] desire
[1:45:11] i wonder if you're in the depths of
[1:45:13] sincerity where that you could ask
[1:45:15] what god wants said
[1:45:20] instead of just human desire
[1:45:23] i'm purposely speaking very methodically
[1:45:27] and straight jesus said say to this
[1:45:31] mountain
[1:45:32] we know what took place as brother
[1:45:35] branham thought on that scripture he
[1:45:37] said that had to be before the atonement
[1:45:38] he said because
[1:45:40] you know that that couldn't be done now
[1:45:42] you know and
[1:45:43] god began to speak to him he said no it
[1:45:44] was in the atonement
[1:45:48] and then he began to challenge his faith
[1:45:50] to speak for what he needed
[1:45:55] and he said that's the ministry we're
[1:45:57] entering
[1:45:58] into well i don't know that we've exited
[1:46:01] out of it
[1:46:04] we're way up the road now soon to come
[1:46:07] in the lord jesus and we've got to have
[1:46:08] rapture and faith in a church
[1:46:10] that can be changed in a moment in a
[1:46:12] twinkling of an eye to go out
[1:46:13] and or will not go but don't worry it'll
[1:46:17] be there
[1:46:19] amen listen again
[1:46:22] let me read that again i want you to
[1:46:23] grab your faith to grab this right now
[1:46:26] he said we've got to have raptured
[1:46:29] faith in the church that can be changed
[1:46:32] in a moment or a twinkling of an eye to
[1:46:34] go out or we'll not go
[1:46:37] but don't worry it'll be there
[1:46:42] amen it'll be there but when the power
[1:46:45] of this church
[1:46:46] rises it'll bring its brethren and the
[1:46:48] power that church
[1:46:49] rises it will bring its brethren and
[1:46:51] then the power of that church
[1:46:53] will bring the other brethren and then
[1:46:55] there will be a general resurrection
[1:46:57] and we're looking forward to it do you
[1:46:58] hear what he's saying
[1:47:00] when the power rises in the church
[1:47:04] the dead in christ is going to
[1:47:07] and rise those of the of this lashing
[1:47:09] see the first
[1:47:11] shall be last and the last shall be
[1:47:13] first
[1:47:14] so the last ones that went down will be
[1:47:16] the first ones
[1:47:19] who will be resurrected
[1:47:25] amen oh my that's that means you you're
[1:47:28] you're blessed people you're not gonna
[1:47:29] have to wait and see a bunch of people
[1:47:31] you never ever knew
[1:47:33] never seen before start appearing among
[1:47:35] you claiming to be
[1:47:37] peter or paul or james or john you're
[1:47:39] going to see your loved ones
[1:47:41] appear right before you
[1:47:46] and you will recognize them and when you
[1:47:50] see them you're going to be
[1:47:51] feel a change sweep over you and you're
[1:47:55] going to be changed in a moral
[1:47:56] a twinkling of an eye as we say there
[1:47:59] ain't no grave
[1:48:02] gonna hold this body down
[1:48:05] am i because this is rapture hour this
[1:48:08] is resurrection hour
[1:48:13] you see this continues unto the voice of
[1:48:17] god
[1:48:18] becomes so strong in the bride of christ
[1:48:20] that she actually gives
[1:48:21] voice to the resurrection amen
[1:48:25] already time is blending with eternity
[1:48:29] we're already seeing things has happened
[1:48:32] with the opening of the seal seven
[1:48:33] angels comes out of that dimensions
[1:48:36] right into this dimension and reveals
[1:48:39] things
[1:48:40] that was previously unknown to the
[1:48:44] church
[1:48:48] there are things and i want you to get
[1:48:52] this
[1:48:53] because as you as you study the the
[1:48:56] message
[1:48:59] you're going to come you have to come to
[1:49:00] realize that brother branham was a tire
[1:49:02] of loose ends
[1:49:06] you're going to have to understand that
[1:49:07] he took strands from
[1:49:09] from from this truth from this one and
[1:49:12] strands from this
[1:49:13] of this truth from that one and strands
[1:49:15] of that of a truth from another
[1:49:17] and tied it into one message
[1:49:21] the critics would want to say well he
[1:49:23] was a plagiarist you know
[1:49:24] he he borrowed from this and that one
[1:49:27] the other
[1:49:28] and and i i don't know the preacher
[1:49:31] alive that ain't a
[1:49:32] plagiarist if i hear something good i'm
[1:49:35] going to borrow it and i'm going to use
[1:49:36] it for myself
[1:49:40] i figure if it's god's word it belongs
[1:49:41] to god and i'm his child too so i'll
[1:49:43] just use it
[1:49:46] amen but you know i you know it no
[1:49:48] longer stumbles me
[1:49:50] it does not stumble me at all to to have
[1:49:53] a prophet who is a man
[1:49:57] he wasn't god he wasn't infallible
[1:50:01] and every word wasn't thus saith the
[1:50:02] lord
[1:50:04] he was he was a man he could speak thus
[1:50:07] saith the lord but he also spoke
[1:50:09] a lot of things he said this is william
[1:50:10] branham i'm presuming here
[1:50:15] i i give him the i give him the
[1:50:19] it doesn't bother me for a prophet of
[1:50:21] god to be to be able to
[1:50:22] embellish to be able to sometimes
[1:50:26] exaggerate
[1:50:27] sometimes speaking off the cuff not have
[1:50:29] perfect recall
[1:50:33] i think we ought to be grown up enough
[1:50:37] to understand he was a human being he
[1:50:39] wasn't god
[1:50:41] you know when we're young in our infancy
[1:50:44] you know
[1:50:44] we we have we we make it a personality
[1:50:48] cult so our hero can do nothing wrong
[1:50:50] that's why these people can overlook all
[1:50:53] these football players you know with
[1:50:55] with their with uh 10 women hanging off
[1:50:57] of their hands and
[1:50:59] and children by all kinds and dope and
[1:51:02] alcohol and
[1:51:03] shoddy life because they're blinded
[1:51:09] amen so they they they they can't they
[1:51:12] can't see
[1:51:13] what their hero was is really like
[1:51:16] and when you have hero worship and
[1:51:17] that's what it is
[1:51:19] with the personality called you know you
[1:51:21] have hero worship well then
[1:51:23] you know nothing can it all has to be
[1:51:26] god you know
[1:51:26] you know you make a god out of him but
[1:51:29] we must realize it wasn't
[1:51:31] he was not a god he was a man and as a
[1:51:35] man
[1:51:35] he could conjecture he could have
[1:51:37] opinions he could have beliefs
[1:51:39] he could have thoughts he could express
[1:51:41] those things
[1:51:46] but now as we're speaking of it as we
[1:51:50] as we come down here to to this we
[1:51:53] we realize that that we're
[1:51:56] here on the very edge of eternity we're
[1:51:59] about to
[1:52:00] blend from time to eternity and as i
[1:52:03] said seven angels coming from those
[1:52:06] other dimensions
[1:52:07] and there night after night revealed the
[1:52:10] seven
[1:52:11] seals where that the silence has been
[1:52:14] broken
[1:52:16] and that we're no longer in the days of
[1:52:18] silence anymore
[1:52:20] but now god has spoke out and shown us
[1:52:23] where we are in time and this is what
[1:52:27] i'm trying to convey upon you is because
[1:52:29] of where we are in time
[1:52:31] that we're about to split from time into
[1:52:34] eternity
[1:52:36] now in how can i overcome brother
[1:52:38] brandon said we see this age we're
[1:52:40] living in it's one of the grandest
[1:52:42] of all ages of all ages this laodicean
[1:52:45] church age
[1:52:46] the grandest of all church ages because
[1:52:49] it's the ending of time
[1:52:52] and the blending of eternity
[1:52:57] time and eternity are blending
[1:53:00] together
[1:53:04] some of y'all will remember in the early
[1:53:06] ministries of brother branham
[1:53:10] he tells about this one of the first
[1:53:13] times in 1950 but it would happen in the
[1:53:15] 40s
[1:53:17] he was having a meeting over here in
[1:53:18] camden arkansas
[1:53:21] and of course you know in that time it
[1:53:23] was a
[1:53:24] a difficult time in our nation and here
[1:53:26] in the south
[1:53:28] were that the black people were were um
[1:53:31] kept separated and treated as subhuman
[1:53:35] it was so wrong
[1:53:38] and and and you know
[1:53:42] and you know they're there again you
[1:53:45] know they
[1:53:46] couldn't even sometimes worship together
[1:53:48] in the same building and so on
[1:53:49] especially here in the south
[1:53:52] and brother branham was being taken out
[1:53:56] of the meeting and as he was
[1:53:58] he let's see set up on a little knoll
[1:54:00] there's a there's an old
[1:54:02] colored man with us with his hat in his
[1:54:05] hand
[1:54:06] and and he's kind of running it around
[1:54:09] his fingers like this and he was saying
[1:54:11] oh mercy mercy have mercy upon me
[1:54:14] i'm a blind man have mercy on me
[1:54:18] and the the man that was with brother
[1:54:21] branham was pushing him trying to get
[1:54:22] him out of the crowd and back to his car
[1:54:24] and he said
[1:54:25] i want to go over there i feel the pull
[1:54:28] of the holy spirit to go there and they
[1:54:30] said you can't go there you'll cause a
[1:54:32] race riot and
[1:54:33] you're leaving all these white people
[1:54:34] going to that black man you can't do
[1:54:36] that
[1:54:37] he said but the spirit of god is telling
[1:54:38] me to do it and i don't care anything
[1:54:41] about your laws i want to
[1:54:42] obey the spirit of god
[1:54:50] as he he they said but you can't go over
[1:54:53] there he said but the lord is telling me
[1:54:55] to go there
[1:54:56] so they made a way and he got over there
[1:55:00] and as he approached the man's wife said
[1:55:03] now honey honey settle down the parsons
[1:55:05] coming to you
[1:55:07] and and said and so he got up close and
[1:55:10] he reached out and as a blind man would
[1:55:12] would feel of his face
[1:55:14] so while you're a young man said is this
[1:55:16] you parson branham
[1:55:19] and he took his little quivering hands
[1:55:20] and put it over his face like that
[1:55:24] and he said can you listen my story just
[1:55:26] for a minute
[1:55:28] and he says yeah go right ahead
[1:55:31] tell me your story and he said parson
[1:55:34] branham said my old mammy had
[1:55:36] had legend like you got
[1:55:39] her never told me a lie in all her life
[1:55:41] and she's been dead for now 10 years
[1:55:44] and i've been blind for about eight
[1:55:46] years and last night
[1:55:48] i've never heard of you in my life
[1:55:52] and last night about eight o'clock i
[1:55:54] live 150 miles from here
[1:55:57] my old mammy stood right there by my
[1:56:00] side of my bed and she said honey child
[1:56:03] you go down to camden arkansas
[1:56:06] and you ask for somebody by the name of
[1:56:08] parson branham and you'll get your site
[1:56:14] he said i reached over and i put my
[1:56:16] hands on the old uh
[1:56:18] on his old dark wrinkled face and i just
[1:56:20] began to pray and said lord jesus i
[1:56:22] don't understand this but i asked for
[1:56:24] sight in his
[1:56:25] in your name and as he moved his hands
[1:56:28] down he said god would judge me at
[1:56:30] judgment bar but as i moved my hands
[1:56:33] down tears began to run
[1:56:34] down that old man's cheek and he looked
[1:56:37] over his wife and said honey i can see
[1:56:40] and she began to scream can you see
[1:56:42] honey he said it shows
[1:56:43] that there's a red car sitting right
[1:56:45] there and there stands parson branham
[1:56:47] and himself screaming like that
[1:56:49] he was perfectly well
[1:56:56] we're living in an age of the blending
[1:57:00] of dimensions
[1:57:06] we all remember the great experience of
[1:57:09] brother branham going beyond the curtain
[1:57:10] of time i've already mentioned that
[1:57:12] hearing the voices from the other side
[1:57:14] say
[1:57:15] press the battle you're just starting to
[1:57:17] keep pressing the battle
[1:57:20] in other words don't give up now
[1:57:24] this is the heaven's message that was
[1:57:26] resounding back
[1:57:28] to a prophet messenger that's they're
[1:57:30] saying on the other side
[1:57:32] and i think it's that message to you
[1:57:33] this morning keep pressing the battle
[1:57:38] amen you know you just don't know you
[1:57:40] can't imagine the joys
[1:57:42] that lay at the end of the road

[1:57:51] don't
[1:57:52] listen what are you going to trade your
[1:57:54] confidence for
[1:57:55] you can't trade it for nothing the world

[1:58:00] that they have
[1:58:03] you think the vaccine is gonna end your
[1:58:06] anxieties
[1:58:07] it won't do it there's only one vaccine
[1:58:09] that will
[1:58:10] end your anxiety and that's the baptism
[1:58:13] of the holy ghost
[1:58:14] the toxin from heaven
[1:58:20] if i don't quit i mean my goodness it's
[1:58:23] a it's an
[1:58:24] hour to press him harder than you ever
[1:58:27] pressed him
[1:58:34] is urging a song he said brother tim
[1:58:37] that ain't even scriptural well
[1:58:38] what do you what he say that in in in in
[1:58:41] hebrews chapter 12. won't you put that
[1:58:43] up for me adriana
[1:58:44] uh hebrews chapter 12 verse 1.
[1:58:48] amen what does he say after he sees
[1:58:51] all these heroes of faith and he names
[1:58:55] bayrack and and ruth and
[1:58:58] and and rahab and he names david
[1:59:02] and abraham and noah and anna can all of
[1:59:05] these and he says
[1:59:06] wherefore sin we are compassed about
[1:59:10] with a great cloud of witnesses let us
[1:59:15] lay your side ever wait and the sin
[1:59:18] which does so easily beside us
[1:59:21] and let us run
[1:59:25] let's see a people with a passion let's
[1:59:27] see a people with a drive
[1:59:30] a drive to finish this and we'll see it
[1:59:32] come to conclusion
[1:59:40] a people of sincerity
[1:59:44] of dedication
[1:59:52] he says seemed like it here could hear
[1:59:56] somebody singing a song
[1:59:58] i'm so homesick and blue and i want to
[2:00:00] see jesus
[2:00:02] and i think that ought to be the song of
[2:00:04] our heart this morning
[2:00:07] if they're saying they want to come back
[2:00:09] here
[2:00:11] then we should be saying we want to meet
[2:00:13] them there
[2:00:18] and he says the song
[2:00:22] said kept saying you know would you just
[2:00:26] let me get a glimpse beyond the curtain
[2:00:27] of time said would you just
[2:00:29] like to see on that curtain said it
[2:00:33] helped me so much and he said just a
[2:00:36] moment
[2:00:37] one breath
[2:00:40] i come to a little place that was
[2:00:42] slanted
[2:00:44] i looked back and i saw my body laying
[2:00:46] on the bed
[2:00:49] and i said this is a strange thing and
[2:00:52] as he moved
[2:00:53] up he stepped out into onto a big grassy
[2:00:56] field
[2:00:57] looked like bluegrass is a panoramic and
[2:01:00] a huge view
[2:01:01] a wide open field and as he did
[2:01:05] here come young women and young men
[2:01:08] robed in white running to him
[2:01:13] throwing their arms around him and said
[2:01:15] brother we knew you were coming
[2:01:17] we're so glad
[2:01:27] a month ago back in november
[2:01:30] my daughter bethany had been asking the
[2:01:32] lord for just reassurance you know
[2:01:35] during these troubled times you would
[2:01:36] just want to make a call in an election
[2:01:38] sure
[2:01:39] hey man and now within a couple of weeks
[2:01:42] of
[2:01:43] specifically praying about that she had
[2:01:45] a dream and she was sitting she's
[2:01:47] visiting with me and her brother timothy
[2:01:50] here and
[2:01:51] we were sitting there in their living
[2:01:52] room
[2:01:55] and all of a sudden she began this just
[2:01:57] a dream she
[2:01:58] began to receive texts and photos on her
[2:02:01] phone
[2:02:01] and it was from it was from sister butts
[2:02:05] we don't know mamashe is a great sainted
[2:02:07] woman
[2:02:10] there's two godly people jerome and
[2:02:15] jerome lovett butts and his wife louise
[2:02:19] she's a great sainted woman she passed
[2:02:22] away some years ago now
[2:02:25] but there she was in heaven and she was
[2:02:27] sending her back
[2:02:29] messages and these messages says
[2:02:32] i cannot wait to be with you again
[2:02:38] you're going to have such a wonderful
[2:02:41] time
[2:02:44] you've already been seen here in heaven
[2:02:51] and then she began to see photos of her
[2:02:54] future
[2:02:55] and there the photos was someone was on
[2:02:58] a couch sitting cheek to cheek
[2:03:01] oh you said brother tim that can't be
[2:03:03] realistic hey when brother branham would
[2:03:05] be
[2:03:05] there he saw a mars chair something
[2:03:08] similar to what he was had on the earth
[2:03:12] amen you know heaven heaven
[2:03:15] you know is is it has things in heaven
[2:03:18] that is
[2:03:19] has earthly simmer and similarities
[2:03:23] and and so then another photo was of
[2:03:26] them
[2:03:27] in a gorgeous field hand in hand with
[2:03:30] long flowing hair and dresses she began
[2:03:33] viewing these messages and crying along
[2:03:36] with me and her brother and
[2:03:37] just praying that that day would come
[2:03:39] quickly and it was rejoicing began to
[2:03:41] talk about how beautiful and
[2:03:43] how wonderful heaven must be
[2:03:47] just a few nights ago brother ron
[2:03:50] spencer he had an amsterdam
[2:03:54] visit uh thursday night
[2:03:58] and he said my father's mother which has
[2:04:00] been his grandmother visited me about
[2:04:01] 1am
[2:04:03] she was young had long black hair
[2:04:06] she was standing very beautifully with a
[2:04:08] beautiful smile
[2:04:10] and and she was a powerful woman
[2:04:12] extremely gifted but
[2:04:13] here she's already gone on but she's
[2:04:15] standing there
[2:04:17] and she said the other time that this
[2:04:18] happened with her
[2:04:20] she was in the room 12 years ago when i
[2:04:22] woke up and you were there brother tim
[2:04:24] and brother branham
[2:04:25] and and this happened you know the day
[2:04:27] he woke up
[2:04:28] from nearly a month in the hospital from
[2:04:30] burns all over his bodies
[2:04:32] and god honored the prayers of believers
[2:04:35] and raised him up from death you
[2:04:38] remember i was sent over there with a
[2:04:39] divine commission
[2:04:41] the lord sent me there and i walked into
[2:04:43] the hospital room
[2:04:45] laid my hands upon brother ron he was
[2:04:48] there they were going to
[2:04:49] harvest his organs with just in hours
[2:04:52] he's in a dying condition he was an
[2:04:54] organ donor so they were
[2:04:56] they were about to to harvest his his
[2:04:59] organs he was pronounced brain dead
[2:05:01] that he wouldn't make it this would have
[2:05:03] to be in what three weeks in the
[2:05:05] hospital
[2:05:06] and there i walk into the room there and
[2:05:08] we pray
[2:05:09] with him and the lord jesus comes down
[2:05:13] in a great way and brings a deliverance
[2:05:16] and raised him up to preach the gospel
[2:05:18] again
[2:05:21] amen but as he was coming to that day he
[2:05:24] was between two dimensions
[2:05:27] he could look over here and he could see
[2:05:29] he could see some of those that had went
[2:05:31] on
[2:05:31] it was brother branham that was his
[2:05:33] grandmother there was other and then he
[2:05:34] could see me
[2:05:38] and i looked at him and i said brother
[2:05:41] ron this is not what you think
[2:05:43] this is not your death
[2:05:48] i haven't come to anoint you for death
[2:05:51] i have come to anoint you for life
[2:05:55] and you're coming up out of that bed in
[2:05:57] the name of jesus christ
[2:06:01] in just a few days he's released to go
[2:06:03] home
[2:06:11] dimensions are blending
[2:06:17] the other night lydia had a dream
[2:06:20] in this dream she dreamed she was
[2:06:23] dreaming
[2:06:24] i don't know this is a little different
[2:06:27] but she dreamed that she was telling me
[2:06:29] about a dream that she'd had
[2:06:31] and in her dream she received like a
[2:06:34] phone call from heaven
[2:06:36] and it was brother branham brother
[2:06:38] branham called her and said
[2:06:40] go be sure to check on your dad
[2:06:43] he said that your dad to he said your
[2:06:46] dad
[2:06:46] is needed and when i when i
[2:06:50] told her the dream i said back to her
[2:06:54] yes do remember to pray for me
[2:06:57] and that's all i'm asking i'm asking
[2:06:59] that you become a real sincere
[2:07:01] church that you pray for me that to do
[2:07:04] the work that i
[2:07:05] needed to do amen i believe that god's
[2:07:09] got a purpose
[2:07:10] i remember back in 2017
[2:07:14] you know i i i dreamed it was may the
[2:07:16] 11th
[2:07:18] i dreamed that you know that it was so
[2:07:20] it was so much like a dream it was
[2:07:22] i i it was hard to tell whether i was
[2:07:24] dreaming or if it was real
[2:07:26] but i'll just say it was a dream and i
[2:07:28] saw a beautiful young woman
[2:07:31] come into a room and remember a vision
[2:07:34] and a dream is the same thing it's your
[2:07:36] you are somewhere some someplace
[2:07:38] somewhere
[2:07:40] and then this in this i saw this
[2:07:42] beautiful woman
[2:07:44] she had kind of a darker complexion
[2:07:48] like just really beautiful i i
[2:07:51] noticed how clear her skin was
[2:07:55] as she walked in she was dressed in
[2:07:57] white
[2:07:59] and and she she
[2:08:02] she was kind of come in and she come in
[2:08:06] my view
[2:08:06] she was looking at me and i was looking
[2:08:09] at her trying to figure out who she was
[2:08:13] and as i did as i did i
[2:08:17] looked at her and i i
[2:08:21] was kind of thinking and i
[2:08:24] i looked around to try to see somebody
[2:08:26] that that i knew to talk to and i i saw
[2:08:29] brother ron spencer standing there and
[2:08:31] i said brother ron you see that young
[2:08:35] lady coming in
[2:08:36] right there she looks remarkably
[2:08:40] like my mother
[2:08:43] and he said yes she does
[2:08:46] you're right and
[2:08:50] you know she went over to a place and
[2:08:52] she she sat down
[2:08:54] just away from me and
[2:08:57] as i watched her i could
[2:09:00] i it was like that i could put in my
[2:09:03] mind
[2:09:04] her her old face at 92 years old or so
[2:09:09] and put it right there and mix those two
[2:09:13] faces together and
[2:09:14] pull it back because i've never seen my
[2:09:17] mother young
[2:09:22] and it was done as though
[2:09:25] you know i could recognize her and and
[2:09:28] she
[2:09:29] at that moment spoke to me and said yes
[2:09:31] to him
[2:09:32] it is me
[2:09:36] and you know you know my mother my
[2:09:38] mother was
[2:09:39] whether it was a great woman she was a
[2:09:42] in many ways a spiritual woman
[2:09:44] she loved the lord she was a dedicated
[2:09:46] christian
[2:09:48] but you know she was also
[2:09:52] had her own mind about things and she
[2:09:54] thought her son
[2:09:55] ought to just do what she said
[2:09:58] and so you know i would never let her
[2:10:00] direct the church and
[2:10:02] and and give a give um let her opinions
[2:10:05] be over what the message said
[2:10:07] because she had her she was opinionated
[2:10:11] and she gave me a lot of trouble she
[2:10:12] said in the meeting some of you noticed
[2:10:15] she was sitting i mean she didn't like a
[2:10:16] song she just hold her plug her ears
[2:10:18] like that
[2:10:20] very disrespectful you know
[2:10:23] she she would um there was there was
[2:10:27] just a lot of things that would
[2:10:28] would go on that i've never told about
[2:10:31] it's not even necessary to tell
[2:10:34] but as she come in she and she sat there
[2:10:36] i looked and i said
[2:10:38] she said to me yes tim it's me and i've
[2:10:41] just come to say
[2:10:44] that you are greatly loved over here
[2:10:49] and i want you to know i'm sorry for all
[2:10:52] the trouble i caused you
[2:10:59] now why am i telling all of these things
[2:11:02] because this whole thought calls for
[2:11:05] greater sincerity
[2:11:06] amen insincerity is a wholeheartedness
[2:11:11] it's an honesty sincerity is a mixed of
[2:11:15] seriousness
[2:11:16] and honesty so you see if you're sincere
[2:11:20] you're serious if you're sincere
[2:11:24] you're honest amen you know to be
[2:11:27] genuine you know to we're not asking
[2:11:30] with sincerity
[2:11:32] many times because we don't really
[2:11:34] believe
[2:11:36] remember it's only whatever god can lead
[2:11:38] your soul to believe that's
[2:11:40] yours so you know sometimes we're
[2:11:45] not really stopping and realizing and
[2:11:48] recognizing what the blood
[2:11:50] has made us he has made us
[2:11:54] kings to reign on the earth do we
[2:11:56] genuinely believe that
[2:12:00] amen we must believe from the heart
[2:12:04] you see jesus addressed the hypocrisy of
[2:12:07] his age
[2:12:08] and he said well did isaiah prophesy of
[2:12:10] you hypocrites
[2:12:12] as it's written this people honors me
[2:12:14] with their lips
[2:12:15] but their heart is far from me
[2:12:18] so one way you know they're saying one
[2:12:21] thing with their lips
[2:12:23] from their human spirit but in their
[2:12:24] heart
[2:12:26] it's not where their lips are
[2:12:30] this is why he would say many times he
[2:12:33] said when you
[2:12:34] ask you receive not because you ask
[2:12:36] amiss
[2:12:38] because you're asking something from
[2:12:41] from your head from your spirit round
[2:12:43] for your mouth
[2:12:44] then you're in your heart you don't
[2:12:46] really believe it
[2:12:51] now we must believe what the blood has
[2:12:54] done for us
[2:12:56] as i've been saying that is that's what
[2:12:58] the opening of the book to transfer the
[2:13:01] title just
[2:13:02] for sons of god it makes us kings with a
[2:13:05] domain
[2:13:07] and that domain is the word of god and
[2:13:09] the priests
[2:13:10] to intercede forever promise
[2:13:14] to appropriate that promise so as a
[2:13:17] priest we appropriate
[2:13:18] the promise and as a king we rule over
[2:13:21] situations
[2:13:23] and brother branham would tell us what
[2:13:25] the blood did to position
[2:13:27] us as sons and again there again we're
[2:13:30] not
[2:13:31] and he tells us why that it's not
[2:13:33] working it's because
[2:13:34] we're not approaching it with sincerity
[2:13:39] with real honesty with the real
[2:13:42] seriousness
[2:13:45] god hiding himself in simplicity i've
[2:13:47] asked you to listen to that
[2:13:49] god taking a humble sinner and cleansing
[2:13:51] him by the blood
[2:13:53] and dropping that confessed sin in the
[2:13:55] clorox bleach
[2:13:56] of the blood of the son of god putting
[2:13:59] his own life into that man
[2:14:01] by the baptism of the holy ghost do you
[2:14:03] believe that
[2:14:05] the very life of god is in you
[2:14:08] by the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[2:14:12] then
[2:14:12] we have the genuine baptism of the
[2:14:14] holiest what's
[2:14:16] wrong with us when the tribe when elijah
[2:14:20] dropped the road for elisha
[2:14:22] he got a double portion of it and jesus
[2:14:24] said the works that i do so you do also
[2:14:26] and greater than this so you do for i go
[2:14:28] to my father what's wrong
[2:14:30] church now you call this belgium
[2:14:34] of visions and things like that get off
[2:14:36] my back brother get down the cross get
[2:14:38] to the gospel
[2:14:40] well we don't have to impersonate why do
[2:14:41] you want to take an impersonation
[2:14:43] why should you take some false
[2:14:45] conception of it when the skies are full
[2:14:48] of genuine pentecostal power that makes
[2:14:51] a man or a woman a son or daughter of
[2:14:53] god
[2:14:54] and that takes him back into the
[2:14:56] presence of god there you are
[2:14:57] god revealing himself in humility
[2:15:03] what did he do he humbled himself to
[2:15:05] death on good friday afternoon that it
[2:15:07] might rise
[2:15:08] on sunday easter sunday amen send back
[2:15:11] the holy spirit upon the church
[2:15:12] with a double portion on it that we
[2:15:15] might do the same things that he did
[2:15:18] and then he promised these signs to
[2:15:20] follow them that believe
[2:15:22] how far we get away from him by our own
[2:15:24] traditions
[2:15:26] there you are god hiding himself
[2:15:28] simplicity revealing himself in the
[2:15:30] empower that's the way god does it
[2:15:32] that's god's program of doing it
[2:15:35] yes sir that he might bring many sons
[2:15:38] across
[2:15:39] this chasm the blood
[2:15:42] has permanently are you with me
[2:15:45] permanently and judas with inborn power
[2:15:50] so then what's the matter with the
[2:15:52] church today
[2:15:54] you know mountain moving power is in the
[2:15:57] atonement
[2:15:59] jesus died so we could have it so why
[2:16:02] aren't we stepping up in
[2:16:03] faith where is the church that is rising
[2:16:06] to the occasion
[2:16:08] who has the sincerity the dedication
[2:16:12] the faith that says he will not fail us
[2:16:15] [Music]
[2:16:17] amen now brother branham is asking the
[2:16:20] question
[2:16:20] what's the matter with the church today
[2:16:23] there's something wrong
[2:16:24] my opinion we're not coming with that
[2:16:27] sincerity
[2:16:29] to the right thing
[2:16:33] if god could do that by the blood of
[2:16:34] bulls and goats and
[2:16:37] and that only covered sin and made a
[2:16:39] perpetuation for the sinner but sin is
[2:16:41] still there only covered over
[2:16:43] what could he do to the blood of his son
[2:16:46] that emits sin and god is not
[2:16:50] manufactured but created a blood
[2:16:53] that takes away all sin
[2:16:58] i know i know we live in a day of
[2:17:00] scientific you know where
[2:17:01] you know people poopoo the whole gospel
[2:17:04] and they
[2:17:05] they say well you know i've grown up now
[2:17:08] you know when i was a child sure
[2:17:10] i i believe that um they went through
[2:17:12] the red sea you know
[2:17:14] and and a fish swallowed jonah but i
[2:17:16] don't believe that now i'm growing up
[2:17:19] i know we are living in a day where the
[2:17:23] faith of many
[2:17:24] has been overthrowed is somebody
[2:17:28] with me amen that is being taught in our
[2:17:30] schools
[2:17:32] and you know pounded into our young
[2:17:34] people
[2:17:36] you've got a tremendous amount of
[2:17:39] unbelief to overcome
[2:17:42] and sadly the answer isn't to hide you
[2:17:44] away
[2:17:45] in some clustered cave somewhere
[2:17:49] amen but because you know you must
[2:17:52] overcome
[2:17:53] in this evil age there's still got to be
[2:17:56] believers who write in the face of
[2:17:59] science says
[2:18:01] god's word is true amen we
[2:18:04] know that it works and my way we are the
[2:18:08] greatest
[2:18:08] testimony you know people want to come
[2:18:10] and discredit
[2:18:12] the message of the hour let me just tell
[2:18:14] you we we
[2:18:15] are the greatest testimony of this
[2:18:18] message
[2:18:20] that it works it changed us
[2:18:24] we were sometimes darkness but now we
[2:18:26] are light in the lord
[2:18:28] and we are one of the greatest witnesses
[2:18:31] of the truth of this
[2:18:36] message
[2:18:39] you know it was a careful following
[2:18:41] sincere
[2:18:42] following of elisha as he followed
[2:18:45] elijah
[2:18:46] that brought about being given a double
[2:18:48] portion
[2:18:50] it was that same carefulness and
[2:18:53] sincerity that allowed joshua
[2:18:55] to have good success because he would
[2:18:57] not turn right
[2:18:59] or to the left
[2:19:02] but he had that dogged that dog
[2:19:05] sincerity and dedication to
[2:19:07] follow the word amen as he was told only
[2:19:10] be thou strong and
[2:19:12] very courageous that you may observe to
[2:19:15] do according to all my word
[2:19:18] and somebody's going to fulfill the word
[2:19:20] for this age
[2:19:21] amen you may observe to do all that is
[2:19:24] written therein
[2:19:26] if it writes that he's the lord to
[2:19:28] healeth all diseases we're going to
[2:19:29] preach that
[2:19:32] amen if it writes that there's a holy
[2:19:34] ghost that is safe from sin
[2:19:36] and change of nature we're going to
[2:19:38] preach that
[2:19:39] and we'll see the results of that
[2:19:43] are you with me amen but it's that same
[2:19:46] sincerity and holy boldness that we need
[2:19:49] to bring about
[2:19:50] that promised double portion
[2:19:54] brother branham would say god hates a
[2:19:56] powerless religion
[2:19:59] it's got to have power in it it's got to
[2:20:02] have sincerity and sincerity brings
[2:20:05] power
[2:20:06] sincerity brings real worship not forms
[2:20:08] but genuine
[2:20:09] power worship to know you pass from
[2:20:11] death to life
[2:20:13] god wants to perform his word by his
[2:20:15] power and when the church denies his
[2:20:17] power
[2:20:18] how can he perform and vindicate his
[2:20:20] word when the church explains it away
[2:20:22] and says it's for some other day
[2:20:24] and something how can god who wants to
[2:20:26] fulfill his word perform his word
[2:20:28] among the people that people denies he
[2:20:29] does it yet they go through all
[2:20:31] the rituals that's right
[2:20:35] you see it's sincerity that is needed
[2:20:38] amen
[2:20:39] go with me for a moment mark 16 verse 17
[2:20:42] and these signs shall follow them that
[2:20:44] believe
[2:20:47] how many believes that now those things
[2:20:49] are among believers
[2:20:51] not that every believer does all of
[2:20:53] those but they are among believers
[2:20:55] they're going to be in the church
[2:20:57] and these signs shall follow them that
[2:20:58] believe in my name
[2:21:00] they shall they cast out devils
[2:21:04] they shall speak with new tongues they
[2:21:07] shall take up serpents
[2:21:12] now we're not going to break out the
[2:21:15] snakes now
[2:21:19] i don't have a surprise for you
[2:21:23] hey man i think it's more than i'm i
[2:21:25] think it's more than handling
[2:21:27] literal snakes when moses picked up the
[2:21:30] serpent
[2:21:31] it was showing dominion over the cobra
[2:21:34] and the cobra was the god of israel and
[2:21:36] it's
[2:21:36] his or the god of egypt and his king
[2:21:39] priesthood
[2:21:40] and to egypt the sacred serpent
[2:21:43] represents supreme power and wisdom
[2:21:46] and when moses there his he cast his
[2:21:49] rot down and become a serpent
[2:21:51] impersonators come with janice and
[2:21:52] jamborees
[2:21:53] and there swallows them up and
[2:21:56] he preached that servant up by the trail
[2:21:59] he was taken up
[2:22:00] serpent what he was doing was showing
[2:22:02] supreme power
[2:22:04] over satan's kingdom from the king all
[2:22:07] the way
[2:22:08] down to the peasant in the field
[2:22:11] amen so therefore he was showing this
[2:22:13] very
[2:22:14] supreme power and he said i give you
[2:22:17] power listen luke 10 19 i give you power
[2:22:21] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[2:22:24] over all the power
[2:22:26] of the enemy now he explains what he is
[2:22:28] it's the power of the enemy
[2:22:30] and he says and nothing oh somebody get
[2:22:33] with me now
[2:22:34] and nothing shall my enemies
[2:22:38] hurt you
[2:22:39] [Music]
[2:22:44] all the evil in the world including
[2:22:47] death sickness demonic oppression
[2:22:49] is the work of satan and demons
[2:22:52] snakes and scorpions and he says
[2:22:56] you're going to take them up
[2:22:59] in other words you're going to render
[2:23:00] them powerless
[2:23:03] you're going to bring them nut to
[2:23:04] nothing when moses
[2:23:06] serpent took and swallowed at the other
[2:23:09] the others was no more
[2:23:11] and i'll tell you amen there is a people
[2:23:14] that is called in this day and hour
[2:23:16] to destroy and pull down satan's kingdom
[2:23:19] they are serpent bruisers
[2:23:23] that have been prophesied from the book
[2:23:25] of genesis to come
[2:23:26] thy seeds that bruise the head of the
[2:23:28] serpent
[2:23:29] and i believe right here in this church
[2:23:32] this morning
[2:23:33] are serpent bruisers and devil defeaters
[2:23:36] and overcomers who are empowered by god
[2:23:42] to defeat the enemy anywhere any place
[2:23:44] anytime
[2:23:46] because they extend the world over
[2:23:48] everything
[2:23:49] [Applause]
[2:23:51] and they're not afraid to speak it
[2:23:58] demons can bluster and rage in order to
[2:24:02] terrify
[2:24:02] people amen there's so doubt and there's
[2:24:05] so fear
[2:24:07] but i want you to know the very least in
[2:24:09] the kingdom of god is able to trample on
[2:24:12] them
[2:24:15] he's nothing but a bluff
[2:24:20] brother branham would have a vision of
[2:24:22] this end time and he would see in there
[2:24:24] something he said i always wanted to see
[2:24:27] and that was the serpent bound
[2:24:31] he said he was there and then the vision
[2:24:34] remember these are prophecies said i was
[2:24:38] lifted up and setting on a narrow
[2:24:40] highway
[2:24:42] and i said i know this is a vision the
[2:24:45] lord got us here
[2:24:46] but it seemed like everybody's afraid
[2:24:50] i said what are they all afraid of
[2:24:53] and the voice came and said there is a
[2:24:55] great danger in these days
[2:24:57] there's a great hideous things that's
[2:24:59] death when it strikes you
[2:25:02] and i'll tell you church we're there
[2:25:08] we're here where revelation 9 shows
[2:25:12] that a an angel falls from heaven
[2:25:16] and he he is given a key to the
[2:25:19] bottomless pit
[2:25:21] and he's given permission to bring all
[2:25:23] of the
[2:25:24] all of the vermin and the evil out of
[2:25:27] that pit
[2:25:29] and it comes up like a smoke and it's a
[2:25:31] blinding delusion it gets into every
[2:25:33] crack and crevice of humanity
[2:25:39] everybody gets affected by it just like
[2:25:42] smoke it blinds the eyes it causes you
[2:25:44] to tear up
[2:25:45] it causes you to you know to not be able
[2:25:48] to breathe it begins to choke you down
[2:25:50] that smoke
[2:25:50] that smoke out of the bottomless pit
[2:25:55] from which all kinds of evil is about to
[2:25:58] ascend out into this age in this time
[2:26:01] and we see it you know you would have to
[2:26:04] be blind deaf and damn not to see it
[2:26:07] you can see the evil is in the land
[2:26:09] there's no hope nowhere
[2:26:11] except the coming of the lord jesus
[2:26:16] are you with me about the end of
[2:26:18] revelation 9 they all become
[2:26:20] worshipers of idols and worshipers of of
[2:26:23] gods of all kinds
[2:26:25] and have you ever seen where the where
[2:26:27] god
[2:26:28] has been pushed away and every false
[2:26:31] idol put in his place
[2:26:35] some madonna some cover girl
[2:26:38] some bald star
[2:26:43] why do you want to be like a ball star
[2:26:47] spit with your tobacco
[2:26:51] you're not too tough of a guy you're
[2:26:53] addicted
[2:26:57] football too many christians
[2:27:01] know all their names and how much they
[2:27:03] raced and how far they went and how many
[2:27:05] touchdowns they made
[2:27:08] i wonder if you can become that serious
[2:27:10] about the word of god
[2:27:16] i wonder if we're not getting too caught
[2:27:18] up about the news that we forget the
[2:27:20] good news
[2:27:25] i wonder if we're too concerned about
[2:27:27] the election and who's really going to
[2:27:29] win this election is all a toss up and
[2:27:31] what's going to happen and we're in
[2:27:33] eternal
[2:27:33] and we forget about the real election
[2:27:39] and that real election is to put christ
[2:27:41] there
[2:27:42] that's the king of our lives
[2:27:44] [Applause]
[2:27:48] everybody was afraid
[2:27:53] if you don't think fear is real you
[2:27:54] ought to have seen what happened when
[2:27:55] coveted
[2:27:57] you just look around just stop and think
[2:27:59] everybody got afraid
[2:28:04] everybody's trembling in their boots
[2:28:10] economy shut down around the world
[2:28:14] oh yeah there's been people die from it
[2:28:17] right
[2:28:19] as people got sick went to hospital from
[2:28:24] it
[2:28:26] but i faced it and i found it nothing to
[2:28:29] fear
[2:28:37] my wife faced it haven't had three
[2:28:40] billion brain bleeds in the past there
[2:28:43] she faced it it lasted for six hours
[2:28:52] i believe christians can take dominion
[2:28:54] over those states
[2:28:58] your yours may last two weeks it doesn't
[2:29:00] matter but you're taking dominion over
[2:29:01] it
[2:29:03] amen don't matter how long the battle
[2:29:05] goes you know but you just take dominion
[2:29:08] and that's what believers do they take
[2:29:10] dominion
[2:29:12] amen now and so brother branham said
[2:29:15] i must see this thing that's causing
[2:29:17] this great danger and he saw it like
[2:29:19] a big mamba snake and he was crashing
[2:29:22] through the
[2:29:23] see the weeds a big monster snake and
[2:29:26] here he comes
[2:29:27] it's a great serpent it's sin it's
[2:29:29] unbelief
[2:29:31] it's a great danger in this day and it's
[2:29:34] prophesied that
[2:29:35] death will ride amen that's the fourth
[2:29:39] seal
[2:29:40] the last rider that goes forth the
[2:29:42] divorce seal is a pale horse
[2:29:44] and he that sits on him his name is
[2:29:46] death and hell follows him
[2:29:49] is that right listen friends things
[2:29:51] don't ain't gonna get any better death
[2:29:53] is on its way
[2:29:54] just as soon as this bride leaves and we
[2:29:57] can already feel the blow
[2:29:59] of the nostrils of that horse as he
[2:30:01] changes from
[2:30:02] from the black to the pale and as he
[2:30:04] moves into the pale and becomes
[2:30:06] he that sat on him is death and hell
[2:30:09] follows him and that's what's going to
[2:30:10] follow
[2:30:11] when the bride leaves her hell will
[2:30:13] break loose
[2:30:19] and they ain't got no back seat for it
[2:30:21] either
[2:30:24] except for the jews there's 144
[2:30:28] 000 of them receive the seal of god in
[2:30:29] their forehead and death can't touch
[2:30:32] them
[2:30:35] this has to do with end-time prophecy
[2:30:37] we're going to land where
[2:30:39] where all the promises lay but there's
[2:30:41] something we have to face we have
[2:30:43] we're going to have to face something
[2:30:44] called death
[2:30:47] but he told him you've been given the
[2:30:49] power to bind him the worst or any
[2:30:52] you see it's the last plague the last
[2:30:54] horse rider
[2:30:56] we've been warned by the eagle i'm not
[2:30:59] pulling things
[2:31:00] out of the air this isn't bible prophecy
[2:31:02] in revelation
[2:31:03] there are four living creatures the lion
[2:31:05] the ox the man and the eagle
[2:31:07] these those are anointings of the holy
[2:31:09] spirit and the last anointing
[2:31:11] amen to give you power over
[2:31:15] the pale horse that is riding and that
[2:31:18] is the eagle anointing
[2:31:19] that identifies for the first time who
[2:31:22] the writer is
[2:31:23] so that you know who the evil one is you
[2:31:26] know where the antichrist spirit is
[2:31:28] coming from
[2:31:30] you know the truth and that truth has
[2:31:32] liberated you
[2:31:35] are you with me and you have yet been
[2:31:37] given power to bind him
[2:31:39] the worst or in it
[2:31:44] here we are seeing the bottomless pit
[2:31:47] open
[2:31:50] and the kind of evil spirit that's
[2:31:53] bringing its death
[2:31:55] everywhere amen
[2:31:59] people are dying everywhere from
[2:32:01] inhaling the deep
[2:32:03] dark black smoke as it goes into every
[2:32:07] crevice and crack of humanity
[2:32:09] and the mind of satan has come in this
[2:32:11] society in such a way that no
[2:32:13] age has ever faced
[2:32:17] even they know it on the political side
[2:32:20] you know your colleges are set in full
[2:32:22] of
[2:32:22] every kind of liberal
[2:32:27] pushing things down trying to destroy
[2:32:29] the faith
[2:32:31] wrecking even the constitution of our
[2:32:34] united states of america
[2:32:36] and they've got in and wormed their way
[2:32:38] in everywhere
[2:32:40] until you can't even have trust anymore
[2:32:42] in your elections
[2:32:50] i'm telling you our hope isn't getting
[2:32:53] mr trump in
[2:32:55] our hope is getting out of here
[2:32:56] [Music]
[2:33:02] brother branham said he looked at this
[2:33:04] snake as it came
[2:33:06] toward him and he said he looked angry
[2:33:08] at me
[2:33:10] i i told you that's the way i hope he
[2:33:11] looks at me
[2:33:13] he licked his tongue and he'd come and
[2:33:15] he would run right up
[2:33:17] and as he'd get closer and closer to him
[2:33:19] he'd get slower and slower
[2:33:21] and just quiver and stop because it was
[2:33:23] something
[2:33:24] that would hold him off
[2:33:29] that's what it's got to be for you amen
[2:33:32] an inoculation of the holy ghost
[2:33:35] amen that he gets closer and closer amen
[2:33:38] the closer he gets to you the slower he
[2:33:40] comes
[2:33:42] until he stops because if something
[2:33:45] won't let him bite you
[2:33:47] i mean turn around and try another side
[2:33:49] and you try another side
[2:33:51] and we're watching the devil come from
[2:33:52] every angle
[2:33:54] [Music]
[2:33:57] you get back and get a start swish
[2:34:01] that's go slower and slower to stop
[2:34:05] and shake move back couldn't strike me
[2:34:12] he said i looked and i saw another
[2:34:16] man there and he said that man he took
[2:34:19] after
[2:34:19] my friend and he was jumping at him and
[2:34:22] the man was just jumping this way
[2:34:24] jumping that way and up in the air and
[2:34:26] over him and things striking at him city
[2:34:28] tried it strikes him if it hits
[2:34:29] him in sense of death
[2:34:31] no wonder everybody's so afraid
[2:34:34] i said god have mercy on my brother
[2:34:38] that serving strikes me to kill him and
[2:34:40] the serpent turned to me again when i
[2:34:42] said that
[2:34:43] and a voice from above said you've been
[2:34:46] given power to bind him
[2:34:47] the worst or any
[2:34:52] you see it was the serpent that bit eve
[2:34:54] at the beginning
[2:34:56] she didn't stay with the word she moved
[2:34:58] from behind the word and the serpent bit
[2:35:00] mankind
[2:35:02] amen was a servant of death that jesus
[2:35:04] defeated at calvary
[2:35:06] amen as the first the first of the god
[2:35:10] race he defeated satan
[2:35:12] but there are more than sons that has to
[2:35:15] face that same serpent and overcoming
[2:35:17] because jesus said
[2:35:19] you will overcome even as i overcame
[2:35:25] so you see he's already led the way down
[2:35:27] through
[2:35:28] to the church that it can be done
[2:35:32] that even as jesus had to go to
[2:35:34] gethsemane
[2:35:36] and the man jesus you can't say he
[2:35:39] wasn't dedicated
[2:35:41] you couldn't say he wasn't sincere
[2:35:44] you couldn't say jesus wasn't
[2:35:46] consecrated
[2:35:47] but it had to come down to a struggle
[2:35:50] between wills
[2:35:55] until jesus could say not
[2:35:58] my will
[2:36:02] in other words it had to come a deep
[2:36:04] honesty
[2:36:07] even deeper expressed by jesus than it
[2:36:10] ever
[2:36:11] expressed and he did this in gethsemane
[2:36:15] we would say but not my will
[2:36:22] he would ask even ask for his will if it
[2:36:25] be thy will
[2:36:26] amen let this cup pass don't let me have
[2:36:29] to drink this
[2:36:31] but then he would come back and he would
[2:36:33] say
[2:36:34] but nevertheless not my will
[2:36:39] but thing be done
[2:36:46] the voice said to brother branham you've
[2:36:47] been given the power to bind him the
[2:36:49] worst or any
[2:36:51] and he says there's one thing you must
[2:36:53] do
[2:36:55] you must be more sincere
[2:37:00] you must be more sincere i said well god
[2:37:04] forgive me of my insincerity and let me
[2:37:07] have sincerity
[2:37:10] and when i raised my hands him again
[2:37:13] there was something that came on me
[2:37:14] just lifted me up something like my
[2:37:17] whole body was
[2:37:18] charged with something
[2:37:22] hallelujah when when he prayed there and
[2:37:24] said lord forgive me
[2:37:26] of my insincerity and made me more
[2:37:28] sincere
[2:37:30] you know i think about the man who came
[2:37:32] to jesus
[2:37:33] i think he's a lot like us when he when
[2:37:36] he came first to the disciples and
[2:37:38] wanted his
[2:37:39] his son cured of an epileptic spirit
[2:37:43] it was a deaf and dumb spirit the bible
[2:37:45] said but anyway he would throw him into
[2:37:46] the fire
[2:37:48] he would have fits the devil would take
[2:37:51] him over
[2:37:52] he brought him to his disciples and
[2:37:54] there was prayer made over him
[2:37:55] they did everything they knew to do and
[2:37:57] it wouldn't move
[2:38:03] there that day when jesus came they met
[2:38:07] a life
[2:38:10] and this was a life of prayer it was a
[2:38:13] life of sincerity
[2:38:16] it was a life that when a crisis rose
[2:38:18] there was
[2:38:19] power to bind the enemy and cast him out
[2:38:23] that's what i'm talking about a church
[2:38:24] that lives there in that place
[2:38:26] where that they have that sincerity
[2:38:28] about them
[2:38:30] that when the crisis arises
[2:38:33] there's faith that rises to the occasion
[2:38:39] and in this case
[2:38:43] jesus said
[2:38:46] how long will i suffer you oh you have
[2:38:49] little faith why why did you doubt
[2:38:53] see he had given him but they hadn't had
[2:38:56] the holy ghost yet to anchor them
[2:38:59] and stabilize them in that power
[2:39:06] he said bring him to me and the man
[2:39:09] said these notable words
[2:39:12] he says
[2:39:15] if thou can do anything now look at the
[2:39:18] question
[2:39:20] you can see the doubt if thou can do
[2:39:22] anything
[2:39:24] heal my son it's my son
[2:39:27] if you can do anything and jesus said if
[2:39:30] i can do anything
[2:39:33] he said all things are possible
[2:39:36] when you believe
[2:39:40] it isn't a lack on god's part it's a
[2:39:43] lack on man's part
[2:39:46] and this is where that man said in
[2:39:47] notable words
[2:39:49] lord i believe
[2:39:52] help me up my unbelief
[2:39:56] and that's where the church is right now
[2:39:58] lord i believe i'm doing everything i
[2:40:00] can to believe
[2:40:02] but i need some help i need a child to
[2:40:04] come over me hey man
[2:40:06] it comes by when we realize i need that
[2:40:09] sincerity in my life i need a greater
[2:40:11] dedication
[2:40:12] i need a greater consecration i need a
[2:40:14] more sanctified
[2:40:16] dedicated walk lord help me
[2:40:21] forgive me of my insincerity
[2:40:26] it'll be at that moment like gary stinky
[2:40:29] the anchor grabs hold
[2:40:33] it quit bouncing along on the bottom
[2:40:36] the anchor will grab something
[2:40:40] and stabilize your faith
[2:40:45] when he said i did that my whole body
[2:40:48] was
[2:40:49] charged with something
[2:40:54] we need that charge
[2:40:58] we talked about the power we talked
[2:41:00] about right right beyond the
[2:41:02] brink of it but look what it requires it
[2:41:04] requires a greater sincerity
[2:41:07] listen you know as he submitted himself
[2:41:10] to the word
[2:41:11] you know even brother branham here in
[2:41:13] this case when he said you know be
[2:41:15] be more sincere you're going to have to
[2:41:17] be more sincere you could say well
[2:41:18] look you know i was eight days and
[2:41:20] nights in the prayer line
[2:41:22] i've been as sincere as i know how to be
[2:41:24] but he
[2:41:25] realized that there had to be a greater
[2:41:28] depth of sincerity than what he'd ever
[2:41:30] reached
[2:41:33] and he admitted he just said lord
[2:41:36] forgive me of my insincerity
[2:41:38] and help me to be more sincere and a
[2:41:41] charge came over him
[2:41:46] he didn't throw his arms up to god and
[2:41:48] say i've been sincere what do you think
[2:41:51] ah brother i drive two hours to church
[2:41:53] on sunday
[2:41:54] every week for church i'm even here on
[2:41:56] wednesdays and
[2:41:58] you know i drive and you know i have to
[2:42:00] listen to
[2:42:01] we we we're in church for three hours
[2:42:03] what do you mean we ain't sincere
[2:42:09] brother branham made no objections
[2:42:14] he didn't disagree with god and say
[2:42:17] no i've been sincere uh-huh he just
[2:42:20] admitted the word was right
[2:42:22] and said forgive me and let me be more
[2:42:25] sincere
[2:42:27] and when he submitted himself the word
[2:42:29] of charge came home he said it was a
[2:42:31] great
[2:42:31] something that just came over me and
[2:42:33] lifted me up and see my
[2:42:35] my whole body was charged with something
[2:42:39] and in the message paradox he said i
[2:42:42] looked at the serpent
[2:42:43] he started toward me and said satan in
[2:42:45] the name of jesus christ i
[2:42:47] bind you and he said a blue smoke flew
[2:42:50] out of him and curled up made
[2:42:52] like an s sign like an n sign and he
[2:42:55] said it means buying this one
[2:42:57] or anything beneath him it was in other
[2:43:00] words when you do this
[2:43:01] it continues you bind this one every
[2:43:05] power under it false
[2:43:08] well i'm telling you church we've got to
[2:43:10] be the people
[2:43:11] that bind even death itself
[2:43:15] what we are changed in a moment and a
[2:43:17] twinkling of an
[2:43:18] eye that what it does it binds
[2:43:20] everything beneath
[2:43:22] and even the dead from seven ages rise
[2:43:31] this is where we're at but to do this
[2:43:36] it requires more sincerity
[2:43:43] then of course you know he took
[2:43:47] i don't know i'm running a little
[2:43:48] overtime we got a program this evening
[2:43:52] but that's okay i got a program right
[2:43:54] now
[2:43:59] some things i want to want to bring to
[2:44:01] you just for a few minutes
[2:44:04] he said he said lord forgive me
[2:44:08] he took his bible said that this ain't
[2:44:10] right forgive me but just show me
[2:44:12] something in the bible and
[2:44:14] took his bible and let it fall open said
[2:44:17] in this time of emergency like that
[2:44:20] before your spirit leaves me
[2:44:24] he says let me see and he took and
[2:44:27] opened up to first corinthians
[2:44:28] fifth chapter eighth verse when you come
[2:44:31] to the feast
[2:44:34] don't come with the old leaven of malice
[2:44:37] and so forth but come with the
[2:44:38] unleavened
[2:44:40] bread of sincerity and truth
[2:44:44] and brother branham told us again he
[2:44:46] says
[2:44:47] he said in there i was not sincere
[2:44:50] enough actually
[2:44:51] to come i wanted to come down to purge
[2:44:53] myself
[2:44:55] he said to have a purgatory now
[2:44:59] he said purgatory is not something after
[2:45:01] you die your purge he said right now
[2:45:03] you've heard your souls
[2:45:04] before god and he said i wanted that
[2:45:06] which has kept me
[2:45:08] from being sincere it purged out of my
[2:45:12] life
[2:45:14] and that ought to be the desire of ours
[2:45:16] today we hear a prophet saying
[2:45:18] to do this you're going to have to be
[2:45:21] more sincere
[2:45:23] then lord then purge the insincerity out
[2:45:26] of us
[2:45:27] and make us more sincere let me take you
[2:45:30] to first corinthians
[2:45:31] um five and verse one it is reported
[2:45:35] commonly that there is fornication among
[2:45:37] you
[2:45:38] and such fornication has not so much as
[2:45:41] named amongst the gentiles that one
[2:45:42] should have his father's wife now this
[2:45:44] was
[2:45:45] the deplorable condition sin
[2:45:48] was happening openly in the church
[2:45:52] and there was a member of the church
[2:45:54] that it actually
[2:45:56] did things that the gentiles wouldn't
[2:45:59] even do
[2:46:01] you know jewish had jewish people had a
[2:46:03] law and a
[2:46:04] a higher order of holiness like you're
[2:46:08] supposed to have amen but the gentiles
[2:46:11] they
[2:46:11] you know they would do a lot of things
[2:46:14] that
[2:46:15] that should that the jews would never do
[2:46:18] immoral acts
[2:46:19] but he said this is such is not named
[2:46:21] among the gentiles
[2:46:23] that one should have his father's wife
[2:46:25] now this man had taken
[2:46:27] his father's wife and look at the
[2:46:30] condition
[2:46:30] and he said you're puffed up
[2:46:34] and you have not mourned that he that
[2:46:38] has done this thing might be taken away
[2:46:42] from you look at verse six
[2:46:46] your glory and is not good you're puffed
[2:46:48] up
[2:46:49] you're saying we're the bride we're the
[2:46:51] elect we're the people of god
[2:46:53] and you're letting sin sit right there
[2:46:56] and go right on be a member right in the
[2:46:58] church
[2:47:01] and he says your glory is not good no
[2:47:04] you're not that a little 11
[2:47:05] 11 at the whole lump purge out there for
[2:47:09] the old 11
[2:47:10] that you may be a new lump as you are
[2:47:13] unleavened
[2:47:14] for even christ our passover is
[2:47:16] sacrificed
[2:47:17] for us therefore let us keep the feasts
[2:47:20] not with old
[2:47:21] leaven neither the leaven of malice in
[2:47:24] wickedness but
[2:47:25] with the unleavened bread of sincerity
[2:47:30] and truth you know
[2:47:34] let me just tell you let me talk
[2:47:36] personal for a minute
[2:47:38] as a pastor as a shepherd it's hard
[2:47:41] sometimes to know what to do
[2:47:45] sometimes although you know a person is
[2:47:48] a tear
[2:47:50] you can't pluck them up without plucking
[2:47:52] others up
[2:47:53] and you have to let them grow together
[2:47:56] but even then there comes a time
[2:47:58] where the terror must be separated from
[2:48:00] the wheat
[2:48:03] and taking his father's wife this man in
[2:48:06] the book of corinthians
[2:48:07] was living in sin and he refused to
[2:48:10] repent
[2:48:13] and paul rebuked the church saying they
[2:48:15] had not mourned
[2:48:17] you're not crying about it that's right
[2:48:20] you're not you're over here glory and
[2:48:23] you know
[2:48:24] what we got so many members and we're so
[2:48:26] we've got
[2:48:27] this and we've got this influence and we
[2:48:30] got this gift and
[2:48:31] we have this tongue or we have this you
[2:48:33] know how the corinthian church was
[2:48:36] and they were boasting and proud and yet
[2:48:39] they were letting
[2:48:40] sin how go on in their midst
[2:48:43] and was not mourning about it
[2:48:48] and he instructed them he said to purge
[2:48:51] out the old
[2:48:52] leaven you know sometimes a church just
[2:48:55] needs purging
[2:48:58] you don't like to see it happen but
[2:48:59] sometimes it just needs purging
[2:49:01] it needs a cleansing from those who
[2:49:05] want membership to the society of a
[2:49:07] church
[2:49:08] but refuse to repent
[2:49:11] so you purge out the old leaven that you
[2:49:13] might be a new lump
[2:49:16] in other words the church is in danger
[2:49:18] becoming as described in the book of
[2:49:20] revelation
[2:49:21] a cage of ever unclean and hateful bird
[2:49:27] people sitting there with all kinds of
[2:49:29] ugly spirits and
[2:49:31] hard feelings and malice
[2:49:35] amen
[2:49:38] well some of your families you can't
[2:49:40] even have thanksgiving or christmas
[2:49:42] together
[2:49:45] shame on you you should be mourning
[2:49:52] amen come on purge out the old levin
[2:49:55] that you might be a new lump
[2:49:57] you see now listen every church has got
[2:50:00] people who are at different levels in
[2:50:03] their walk with god
[2:50:06] some are justified and they've never
[2:50:09] been sanctified
[2:50:10] in other words they've repented of their
[2:50:11] sins but they've still got old worldly
[2:50:13] habits still on them
[2:50:15] you know and some are sanctified that
[2:50:18] means they've been cleansed from the
[2:50:19] morally habits
[2:50:22] and they hadn't been filled with the
[2:50:24] holy ghost
[2:50:27] now this latter is the most dangerous
[2:50:30] the most dangerous because the external
[2:50:33] evidence of holiness
[2:50:35] is applied without being filled with the
[2:50:39] spirit
[2:50:42] and these can even become deacons and
[2:50:43] trustees and
[2:50:45] preachers and they had their lack of the
[2:50:48] holy ghost behind the
[2:50:50] facade of manufactured holiness
[2:50:55] we have young people that struggle with
[2:50:57] sin cutting their hair
[2:51:00] other elements of the worldliness
[2:51:04] some of you will drive miles to make
[2:51:06] sure they're in a ball game
[2:51:11] when the soul is much more important
[2:51:14] but you're not serious
[2:51:18] you see we we have you know it you see
[2:51:21] we have young people
[2:51:24] as i said who struggle with sin cutting
[2:51:26] the hair elements of worldliness
[2:51:28] it's not it's not intended
[2:51:32] to push them out of the church that's
[2:51:35] not what we want
[2:51:36] but to rather these in the womb to
[2:51:38] develop and become
[2:51:40] fully matured and birthed by the breath
[2:51:43] of god
[2:51:44] so we will always have those among us
[2:51:47] who are babes in christ
[2:51:50] but for people to sit on the pews for
[2:51:53] years
[2:51:54] in blatant unbelief and contagious sins
[2:51:58] that encourages others and leads others
[2:52:01] to a
[2:52:02] rebellion and this has to be purged from
[2:52:06] the church
[2:52:07] the days of ananias sapphira are here
[2:52:10] and may the holy spirit bring back
[2:52:12] painful but necessary separation from
[2:52:15] the church
[2:52:15] of the leaven
[2:52:21] now you're puffed up
[2:52:25] you have not mourned that he that's done
[2:52:27] this deed might be taken away from you
[2:52:29] now notice what happened in the end this
[2:52:32] man was reconciled back to the church
[2:52:35] so the intent was never to push him out
[2:52:38] but to get him to repentance
[2:52:43] you see there ought to be mourning in
[2:52:45] the church when we see sin
[2:52:48] amen not gods have been in the church
[2:52:50] but mourning in the church
[2:52:53] amen and i'm just going to say some
[2:52:55] things here don't take all the medicine
[2:52:56] on the shelf
[2:52:57] that i might dish out this morning but
[2:52:59] if there's something there that the lord
[2:53:01] preached your heart about
[2:53:02] make a change
[2:53:06] amen you know there ought to be mourning
[2:53:08] in our church when we
[2:53:10] when we see our young people struggling
[2:53:12] with sin
[2:53:15] amen there ought to be mourning we ought
[2:53:17] to be mourning we're not puffed up oh
[2:53:19] we're the bride we're the mighty we got
[2:53:21] the power
[2:53:22] we you know but we when we see our
[2:53:24] married couple struggling in their
[2:53:26] marriage
[2:53:27] arguing and fussing with them with one
[2:53:30] another
[2:53:30] and the home and not in harmony it ought
[2:53:33] to cause a mourning
[2:53:35] in the church
[2:53:39] when we see little sisters in our church
[2:53:41] struggling with with
[2:53:42] makeup and cutting hair and short and
[2:53:44] tight dresses it ought to cause the
[2:53:46] whole church
[2:53:46] to mourn
[2:53:53] when we see preachers committing
[2:53:54] adultery and falling into sin
[2:53:57] it ought to cause us to mourn morning
[2:54:12] when you see people longtime believers
[2:54:15] struggling to make it to church
[2:54:23] i don't take this to the extreme
[2:54:27] because i don't mean it to the extreme
[2:54:30] but people
[2:54:31] see long time believers struggling to
[2:54:32] make it to church
[2:54:34] and would rather go off camping and
[2:54:36] fishing and hunting or cruising
[2:54:38] and the evidence of lukewarm laodice oh
[2:54:41] to see in spirit taking charge of their
[2:54:43] lives
[2:54:46] it ought to cause the church to mourn
[2:54:54] morning when we know this when we see
[2:54:57] men are not being fathers taking jobs
[2:54:59] away from church
[2:55:01] not setting a godly example being a
[2:55:03] leader in their families
[2:55:04] it ought to cause the church to mourn
[2:55:08] amen when we see more emphasis put it on
[2:55:11] material things rather than spiritual
[2:55:13] things
[2:55:14] it ought to cause the church to mourn
[2:55:19] you say shut up on that preacher well
[2:55:21] listen paul said this to
[2:55:22] him in titus 2 and 6 young men likewise
[2:55:26] exhort
[2:55:26] to be serious or sober minded be
[2:55:30] serious about the things of god and then
[2:55:32] in all things showing ourselves a
[2:55:34] pattern of good works
[2:55:36] in doctrine showing uncorruptness
[2:55:38] gravity
[2:55:39] sincerity mourning
[2:55:43] it ought to cause us to mourn when we
[2:55:45] see the sick not healed as god promised
[2:55:49] amen morning it ought to cause
[2:55:52] it ought to cause crying in the church
[2:55:55] when we see the move of the spirit
[2:55:57] stifled
[2:56:02] brother branham said in what house would
[2:56:04] you build me he said
[2:56:06] he said i know each one of you if you
[2:56:08] feel like i do i'm so
[2:56:09] hungry to see the spirit of god moving
[2:56:13] i wonder if there's anybody here like
[2:56:14] that so
[2:56:16] hungry to see the spirit of god moving i
[2:56:18] just can't hardly stand it
[2:56:20] some experience i've had up the mountain
[2:56:22] just to feel that once again
[2:56:24] that's something that when i was first
[2:56:26] saved was so
[2:56:27] glorious to my heart and we can come to
[2:56:30] a place where we can sit and see it
[2:56:31] among us
[2:56:32] that we're drying we sit in the desert i
[2:56:35] get them on my brother and they talk
[2:56:36] with me i talk with them
[2:56:38] always a little way of watching feeling
[2:56:40] out with the spirit and see the
[2:56:42] condition of that brother
[2:56:43] see what's wrong and i began to feel us
[2:56:46] all
[2:56:47] reclining getting away from the spirit
[2:56:52] it's become too natural a thing to us
[2:56:55] we must worship in the spirit with the
[2:56:57] spirit of god not only our
[2:56:59] message uh should be the flame of the
[2:57:02] hour it should be the flame of our
[2:57:04] hearts
[2:57:05] see it's got to be in our heart or we
[2:57:07] can't rightly present it to the people
[2:57:09] the spirit has to pack the message
[2:57:11] itself
[2:57:13] amen you so so again he said
[2:57:16] keep the message honorable live the
[2:57:18] right kind of life don't let no smut
[2:57:20] come upon it we're living through
[2:57:22] late night we're too late in the hour
[2:57:24] let's live it clean
[2:57:26] my life your life all our lives needs to
[2:57:28] be picked up before god
[2:57:32] you've got he said our young people
[2:57:35] ride from place to place and show this
[2:57:36] show drifting further and further away
[2:57:38] from god
[2:57:39] now that's the truth i see it my
[2:57:40] children i see it myself getting a place
[2:57:42] where
[2:57:43] you've got to assemble ourselves
[2:57:45] together to worship god the bible says
[2:57:47] when we see this day approaching that's
[2:57:49] so much more
[2:57:50] come together if only two people hear
[2:57:53] you be one of them
[2:57:55] and when we if we come together then we
[2:57:57] just be something about it
[2:57:58] jesus said where two or three are
[2:58:00] gathered in my name there i am
[2:58:03] in the midst but we can't be puffed up
[2:58:08] say well we're just the bride of christ
[2:58:11] i'm telling you friends you might look
[2:58:14] at one and i said well we're more
[2:58:16] we're more dedicated than the methodist
[2:58:18] people over there we're more
[2:58:20] dedicated than baptist people over there
[2:58:22] and we're more dedic
[2:58:26] is that enough
[2:58:30] i'm asking you is that enough unless
[2:58:33] your righteousness exceeds that of the
[2:58:35] scribes and the pharisees
[2:58:40] it requires more seriousness
[2:58:44] a more dedication and agonizing with god
[2:58:48] to fulfill his word
[2:58:50] that's what i'm asking you you know
[2:58:53] lydia was instructed there in that dream
[2:58:56] pray for your dad he's got a work to do
[2:58:59] pray for him
[2:59:01] heaven coming down giving a word to her
[2:59:05] pray for him but i i'm just wondering
[2:59:08] are we really agonizing with god to
[2:59:10] fulfill this word
[2:59:12] to that we might finish this course that
[2:59:15] we might
[2:59:16] run this race with perseverance
[2:59:20] am i putting everything we got into it
[2:59:24] oh i know you can turn and look and
[2:59:26] point fingers and that one needs this
[2:59:27] and this
[2:59:28] needs that but what about you brother
[2:59:30] what about you sister
[2:59:32] it's not my brother it's not my sister
[2:59:34] it's not my neighbor but it's me oh lord
[2:59:36] i'm the one standing in need of prayer
[2:59:41] that vision of that binding of that
[2:59:43] great servant death god brother
[2:59:45] told brother branham god requires a
[2:59:48] greater sincerity
[2:59:52] and that's what god's required now
[2:59:56] there's a call for sincerity
[3:00:00] there's a call for reconsecration
[3:00:05] there's a job to be done
[3:00:08] there's a race to be run
[3:00:14] and to do it it requires
[3:00:20] a greater depth of honesty of sincerity
[3:00:24] a genuineness of wholeheartedness
[3:00:29] putting your whole heart into it
[3:00:37] it's what people don't have chaffed at
[3:00:39] me about our musicians
[3:00:42] i've told them over and again i preach
[3:00:45] with my whole heart
[3:00:46] you put your whole heart into your
[3:00:48] singing into your music
[3:00:51] put your whole heart into it every
[3:00:53] service we should be putting our whole
[3:00:55] heart into it
[3:00:56] everything that we got answering the
[3:00:59] call for sincerity if god is requiring
[3:01:02] it
[3:01:02] we ought to say yes lord and i have to
[3:01:04] say lord i i haven't been sincere enough
[3:01:09] and you have to look at your own self
[3:01:11] and admit it
[3:01:14] admitting it is half the battle
[3:01:17] you know brother branham had people
[3:01:19] coming in a prayer line one time and
[3:01:22] he said they would come in and they
[3:01:24] would actually be healed
[3:01:25] read the bible they're blind
[3:01:28] read the bible words out of the bible
[3:01:32] and so on
[3:01:33] and walk off the platform and lose their
[3:01:35] healing
[3:01:38] and he said the holy spirit woke him up
[3:01:40] early one morning
[3:01:41] and pulled him aside and he's and he's
[3:01:44] as he
[3:01:45] as he stood there at the window looking
[3:01:47] over the city
[3:01:48] and he says there must be a sincere
[3:01:52] confession
[3:01:54] tell these people to confess their
[3:01:56] unbelief
[3:01:58] their sins before they come in that
[3:02:01] prayer line
[3:02:03] otherwise they won't keep their healing
[3:02:12] you see what it requires sincere
[3:02:16] confession
[3:02:18] we're not playing games it's a serious
[3:02:21] hour the death angel's in the land
[3:02:24] and there should be mourning in this
[3:02:28] church
[3:02:39] let the musicians come
[3:02:42] you see this is a time of full
[3:02:44] restoration full redemption
[3:02:47] not just redemption
[3:02:50] foolish virgins are redeemed people
[3:02:52] they're in the book of redemption
[3:02:54] they're saved they're redeemed before
[3:02:55] the bride
[3:02:56] takes a rapture this side the
[3:02:57] tribulation but they missed the rapture
[3:03:02] foolish enough to have made a profession
[3:03:05] look here
[3:03:05] they got a lamp they're pretending
[3:03:09] but they have no oil with their lamps
[3:03:12] their virgins have made great steps
[3:03:14] but they ain't went far enough
[3:03:21] they have a profession of faith but no
[3:03:22] possession
[3:03:24] of the oil that's required to keep the
[3:03:27] lamb burning
[3:03:30] if your lamp keeps going out
[3:03:35] and has to be re-lit all the time
[3:03:40] it's not the fault of the fire
[3:03:44] it's the fault there's no oil
[3:03:47] in the lab
[3:03:57] god's calling for a new dedication a
[3:03:59] great consecration
[3:04:01] are you ready to make that consecration
[3:04:08] are you ready to surrender everything
[3:04:11] you come into gethsemane well you can
[3:04:14] quit saying not my will
[3:04:18] but i want the will of god done i am
[3:04:21] called
[3:04:22] for purpose in this end time now let me
[3:04:25] find that purpose
[3:04:26] and my purpose isn't to enrich myself
[3:04:31] it isn't to gain great glory to win
[3:04:35] great trophies
[3:04:36] to have great things to have big houses
[3:04:39] and lands our to our
[3:04:42] our goal
[3:04:45] is to be standing there
[3:04:50] all of a sudden young people
[3:04:53] start walking in this room
[3:04:58] tapping you on the shoulder
[3:05:01] and saying it's owned
[3:05:05] i've come from that other dimension to
[3:05:07] tell you
[3:05:09] that you're no longer needed here but
[3:05:12] you're needed for this change
[3:05:20] let's put our heads together father thou
[3:05:23] knowest lord every heart never desire
[3:05:25] and every soul
[3:05:29] you know what the longing is you know
[3:05:31] what you spoke to them about
[3:05:34] as i told them don't take every pill in
[3:05:36] the
[3:05:37] on the shelf just take what's needed
[3:05:41] but the holy spirit just saying to all
[3:05:43] of us
[3:05:44] is going to require a greater sincerity
[3:05:51] may it do it today lord may we
[3:05:54] get forgiven of our
[3:05:58] sin in sincerity forgive me lord
[3:06:04] lord there's not a message that i don't
[3:06:06] put my heart into not hours and hours
[3:06:08] and hours and
[3:06:09] praying and praying to the night and
[3:06:11] even tonight i'm praying through the
[3:06:13] night
[3:06:14] couldn't go to sleep till we hours of
[3:06:16] the morning
[3:06:18] but yet lord i know you're
[3:06:21] calling for a greater faith
[3:06:24] a greater dedication a greater
[3:06:27] consecration
[3:06:28] a greater sincerity you want me to be
[3:06:31] more honest
[3:06:34] you want me to be surrendered
[3:06:38] i pray that you'll do it father
[3:06:42] forgive me of my insincerity like the
[3:06:45] man said
[3:06:47] forgive me of mine belief
[3:06:50] help me help me lord
[3:06:54] i struggle this humanity struggles
[3:06:59] help me lord the five senses seem
[3:07:03] to be so much realer sometimes than the
[3:07:06] supernatural help me
[3:07:08] to be in touch with the supernatural
[3:07:12] jesus prayed earnestly
[3:07:15] the reason for his earnest prayers was
[3:07:17] to stay in contact and fellowship with
[3:07:20] the spirit that was in him
[3:07:22] lord the holy spirit is in me let me
[3:07:25] stay

[3:27:53] amen we're here today
[3:27:56] we're going to be baptizing some young
[3:27:58] people
[3:27:59] in the name of the lord jesus because we
[3:28:02] don't believe in
[3:28:03] infant baptism where that we baptize
[3:28:05] them before they
[3:28:06] have any sense of right and wrong but
[3:28:08] these children have been taught what's
[3:28:10] right and what's wrong and they've made
[3:28:12] their mind that they want to serve the
[3:28:14] lord
[3:28:15] they come from a wonderful heritage
[3:28:17] brother john and
[3:28:18] sister rebecca pruitt love the lord and
[3:28:22] serve the lord trying to raise their
[3:28:23] children
[3:28:24] right but these children on their own
[3:28:26] have wanted to be
[3:28:27] baptized taken on the name of the lord
[3:28:30] jesus
[3:28:32] and they are sincere about it
[3:28:35] and they are giving their hearts to the
[3:28:37] lord
[3:28:38] and so today we're just going to
[3:28:42] follow the lord in water baptism now a
[3:28:44] lot of times
[3:28:45] young children like this will be
[3:28:47] baptized at a later date again
[3:28:49] and maybe when they come a little older
[3:28:51] and they realize a little more
[3:28:53] as they make a re-consecration that's
[3:28:55] all right but we
[3:28:56] as soon as they um are of age or that
[3:29:00] they
[3:29:01] make up their mind in their heart they
[3:29:02] want to serve the lord and
[3:29:04] and whatever we follow the
[3:29:08] we get them to follow the lord in
[3:29:09] obedience to water baptism
[3:29:12] john paul is here john paul pruitt
[3:29:15] and john paul the lord jesus
[3:29:18] sent brother tim to the world to preach
[3:29:20] the gospel
[3:29:22] and he commanded us everywhere that we
[3:29:25] go
[3:29:26] to baptize those that believe on the
[3:29:28] lord
[3:29:29] in the name of the father and of the son
[3:29:32] and the holy ghost now
[3:29:34] in obedience to that divine command

[3:29:40] of the lord jesus christ

[3:30:00] coming here
[3:30:01] she wants to obey the lord in water
[3:30:03] baptism too
[3:30:05] and you know as i've said many times you
[3:30:08] know

[3:30:11] started serving him when i was five
[3:30:13] years old
[3:30:14] and he went to the altar gave my heart
[3:30:17] to the lord

[3:30:25] fulfill a divine commission haven the
[3:30:28] lord
[3:30:29] jesus sent me to preach the gospel
[3:30:32] and he ordained me to do so and he told
[3:30:35] me
[3:30:36] in his word that when those believed
[3:30:39] on the lord that i was to baptize them
[3:30:42] in the name not titles but the name
[3:30:46] of the lord jesus christ so it's the
[3:30:50] in that name that we come so knowing
[3:30:52] that he commissioned me
