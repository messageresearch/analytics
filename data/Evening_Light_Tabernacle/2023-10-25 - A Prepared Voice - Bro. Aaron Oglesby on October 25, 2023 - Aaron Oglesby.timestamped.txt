[40:26] very familiar scripture to us we'll read
[40:28] verse 5 and 6 then we'll also turn over
[40:30] and read Revelations
[40:34] 107-11 so we're going to read here
[40:36] Malachi 45 and 6 says behold I will send
[40:40] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[40:42] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[40:44] Lord and he shall turn the heart of the
[40:46] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[40:49] the children to their fathers lest I
[40:51] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[40:55] and also in Revelation vation
[40:57] 10:7 we'll read down through verse 11 it
[41:00] says but in the days of the voice of the
[41:02] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[41:04] sound the mystery of God should be
[41:07] finished as he had declared to his
[41:08] servants the prophets and the voice
[41:11] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[41:12] again and said go and take the little
[41:14] book which is open in the hand of the
[41:16] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[41:18] upon the Earth and I went unto the angel
[41:20] and said unto him give me the little
[41:22] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[41:25] it up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[41:27] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[41:29] honey and I took the little book out of
[41:31] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[41:33] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[41:35] soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[41:37] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[41:41] prophesy again before many peoples and
[41:44] Nations and tongues and Kings amen I
[41:47] just pray the Lord will add His
[41:48] blessings to the word as you have your
[41:50] seats
[41:52] tonight I'd like to speak to you for a
[41:54] little while tonight on on the thought
[41:55] of prep prepared voice a prepared voice
[41:59] and we spoke a little bit last time that
[42:01] we did speak here on preparations and
[42:03] how that God is a god of preparations
[42:05] and he's got all things prepared for you
[42:08] and everything that we even go through
[42:09] often times are preparations for things
[42:11] that are coming and what what we find is
[42:14] is that God is never unprepared for
[42:16] anything nothing catches him off guard
[42:19] nothing the devil does catches him by
[42:21] surprise nothing that's happening in the
[42:23] world right now has caught God off
[42:26] uh all the craziness going on all over
[42:29] the world the war going on in in the in
[42:31] Israel and the different things in
[42:32] politics uh this does not catch God
[42:35] unaware it's not something that he
[42:37] didn't know was coming but he is always
[42:40] prepared and in that he always has what
[42:43] you need ready for you before you need
[42:46] it he already has it so when trials and
[42:49] things in our daily life do Come and
[42:51] catch us off guard because sometimes the
[42:53] trials do catch us unaware they do catch
[42:56] C us off guard and when those things
[42:57] happen it doesn't shock him or worri him
[43:01] he just gives you what he already had
[43:03] prepared for you to get you through the
[43:05] trial or get you through what this thing
[43:07] is that you're facing and and many times
[43:09] he's already given to you what you
[43:11] needed he's already given you the
[43:14] resources to fight your way through
[43:16] before the trial even comes your way
[43:19] many times battles we have gone through
[43:21] have prepared us for battles that are up
[43:24] ahead sermons and Serv that we listen to
[43:27] often times prepare us times in prayer
[43:30] have prepared us and when the enemy
[43:32] comes in what we can do is we can go
[43:33] back and draw strength from what he has
[43:36] already given us because he's constantly
[43:38] preparing us or or or what happens is
[43:41] sometimes we come and and and come face
[43:43] to face with the Goliath in our life and
[43:45] when we come to that place we can look
[43:47] back to the lion and we can look back to
[43:49] the bear and we can draw from that and
[43:51] we can recognize that those things as
[43:53] awful as they were have prepared me me
[43:56] for this moment I'm not standing here in
[43:59] doubt I'm not standing here in fear but
[44:01] what I know is the same God that
[44:03] delivered the line the same God that
[44:05] delivered the bear is the same God
[44:07] that's going to deliver me out of this
[44:09] situation and give me victory for what
[44:11] I'm facing here tonight so your trials
[44:13] don't don't go without purpose and I
[44:15] know many times we don't want to go
[44:17] through them and I don't want to go
[44:18] through them but I know that tonight I
[44:20] am battle tested I know that this bride
[44:22] is Battle tested and the enemy has come
[44:25] Time After Time after time and yet we're
[44:27] still standing and so I know that
[44:29] whatever we Face tomorrow in the next
[44:31] day the same God that brought us through
[44:33] that is going to take us through that
[44:35] all the way till he brings us to a
[44:37] Rapture amen he is the
[44:41] provider God always provides what we
[44:43] need even in situations that catch us
[44:46] off guard but as it relates and this is
[44:49] really what I want to get to because in
[44:51] our daily life yes things catch us off
[44:53] guard but as it relates to the age that
[44:56] we live in and as it relates to the end
[44:59] time and the coming of the Lord and all
[45:01] that is coming upon the Earth God has
[45:04] made sure that none of it has caught us
[45:06] unaware none of it has snuck up on us
[45:09] none of this is happening and we're
[45:10] going what's going on I can't believe
[45:13] this he has made sure that we were
[45:15] prepared and aware for what was coming
[45:18] upon the Earth he made sure that we knew
[45:20] the hour we were living in he made sure
[45:22] that we knew the day we were living in
[45:25] he made sure that we would know exactly
[45:27] what to expect in this day we know
[45:30] what's coming upon the Earth listen if
[45:31] you're looking around and all this is
[45:33] shocking you you haven't been reading
[45:34] the message or the Bible or listening at
[45:36] all this shouldn't shock us as a matter
[45:39] of fact although these things are awful
[45:41] it should make us look at it and rejoice
[45:42] and recognize we're at the end this is
[45:45] what we've been told was coming all
[45:47] along and we can rejoice in knowing that
[45:50] why how did that happen he sent a
[45:52] message in this day so that you would be
[45:54] prepared he sent a message that none of
[45:56] this would catch you off guard and in
[45:59] that he provided exactly what you would
[46:01] need to be able to stand in the evil day
[46:05] I thank God that because of that message
[46:07] in these times of chaos I have peace
[46:09] tonight in the in in times of
[46:11] uncertainty we are certain that our God
[46:13] is living we are certain that this word
[46:15] is true in times of confusion we don't
[46:18] have to wonder we have a solid rock we
[46:21] can stand on tonight because he has sent
[46:23] a message in this day to prepare us for
[46:26] all that is coming and not only to
[46:28] prepare us but to give us the ability to
[46:30] stand to give us the ability to stand
[46:33] and and and Proclaim that there is a
[46:35] living God and an ability to stand and
[46:37] prepare us all the way till he raptures
[46:39] our bodies
[46:41] amen not only that because often times
[46:44] we look to the Rapture because that is
[46:46] the ultimate goal but he gives us all we
[46:49] need to fulfill what he expects us to
[46:52] fulfill while we wait because it's not
[46:55] one of those things that the message
[46:56] just comes and we receive it we go well
[46:58] thank God now I'm going kick back sit
[47:00] back and do nothing until the Rapture
[47:02] comes that's that's not how this works
[47:04] there are things that he wants us to
[47:06] fulfill the the word has declared that
[47:09] the move is on for the bride now that
[47:12] move even though it wasn't just a move
[47:14] away from
[47:16] denominations although that was a huge
[47:18] part of it come out of her my people
[47:19] that you not be partakers of her sin
[47:21] that was a huge part of the move but the
[47:23] move was also a move to battle it was a
[47:26] move to conquer it was a move to go out
[47:28] to war when David heard the rustle in
[47:30] the mberry bushes it told him that the
[47:32] Lord had gone before him and it was time
[47:35] to go to battle so what is this move
[47:37] we're talking about we're to go take all
[47:40] of our promises we're to go take all the
[47:42] devil has stole from us we're to take
[47:44] back our joy take back our peace take
[47:47] back our freedom take back our Liberty
[47:49] those are things that we are to FF while
[47:51] we wait we are to be conquering every
[47:54] devil taking every promise the land
[47:56] desirs from one border to the other
[47:58] border I'm not just going to sit here
[48:00] and wait on the Rapture but we're called
[48:02] to take it all while we're here there's
[48:05] purpose in the waiting it's not just
[48:08] kicked back doing all doing nothing but
[48:10] it's a move to battle a move to conquer
[48:12] a move to
[48:13] overcome it's a it's a a move to take
[48:16] all that the word promises
[48:19] us with us sayith the Lord we don't have
[48:23] to fear demons with us sayith the Lord
[48:26] we don't have to to fear Satan's Eden
[48:29] with thus sayeth the Lord we don't have
[48:30] to fear any sickness but we can stand
[48:33] firm tonight knowing that with thus
[48:35] sayeth the Lord whatever's been spoken
[48:37] is going to take place and there's been
[48:39] a vision spoken over this bride that
[48:41] says when others went down we went up
[48:43] that's thus sayeth the Lord I'm telling
[48:45] you I'm resting in that tonight I'm
[48:47] focused on that tonight I'm not focused
[48:49] on All Around Me although you don't deny
[48:51] those things those things are a reality
[48:54] but my focus is there's another reality
[48:56] in my life there is a living God and
[48:59] he's called a bride out and he's not
[49:00] going to leave her here fighting alone
[49:02] but while we're here he's gone before us
[49:05] and when our time is up and we've
[49:06] conquered what we're called to conquer
[49:08] he's taken us out of here
[49:13] hallelujah we are to be a voice crying
[49:17] out in the closing moments of time that
[49:20] there is a living God we are to be a
[49:22] voice crying out for Holiness and for
[49:25] righteousness
[49:26] we are to be a voice to the final age
[49:29] and to a Dying World that there is a
[49:31] reality to God and not only that but
[49:34] there is a way prepared that you can
[49:36] escape what's coming on this Earth You
[49:38] are to be a voice that's crying out that
[49:41] to the people you run into to the people
[49:43] you work with to the people you rub
[49:45] shoulders with and it may not be ever
[49:47] through your mouth but there should be a
[49:49] life live that shows there's a living
[49:51] God there's something different about
[49:53] that person that person is is totally
[49:55] different different from everybody else
[49:56] what is it that makes them different
[49:59] what is it there should be a life crying
[50:00] out there's a reality to God because
[50:04] it's a voice a voice that comes out of
[50:07] your
[50:10] life
[50:14] Hallelujah me look move down
[50:18] here he made sure that we weren't caught
[50:20] unaware and he made
[50:22] sure that we were prepared and he comes
[50:25] and he
[50:26] and one thing I love about the way our
[50:28] Lord operates is he comes and he says
[50:31] that he requires faith and he asks the
[50:34] question when I come will I find faith
[50:36] and then he comes right behind that and
[50:38] provides the very faith that he's
[50:39] looking for and it's the way that he
[50:41] operates he he he he he required a lamb
[50:44] and he provided the lamb he required a
[50:46] life and so he gave his life he required
[50:49] faith and so he comes and he provides
[50:51] that faith brother brandham says the end
[50:53] time message is to get get the bride
[50:56] ready and prepared for the Rapture what
[51:00] can it do according to Malachi 4 is to
[51:02] bring them back to the faith that was
[51:04] once delivered to the Saints bring them
[51:07] back to the faith of the fathers to the
[51:09] Pentecostal part in the restoration time
[51:12] I will restore sayeth the Lord that's a
[51:14] real event that's end time evangelism
[51:19] amen God always prepares us by equipping
[51:24] us with exactly what it is we have need
[51:27] of he always prepares us by equipping us
[51:30] with exactly what we have need of and
[51:33] and as evil as it is in the world
[51:35] today as bad as it is the things going
[51:38] on in the world today as Believers we
[51:40] can look at those things through the
[51:42] word of God and we can say that this is
[51:44] a wonderful time to be
[51:47] alive now if you just look at what you
[51:50] see going on there not very much
[51:51] wonderful happening but when you view it
[51:54] Through The Eyes of the word when you
[51:55] view it Through The Eyes of Prophecy
[51:57] then you can say it's a wonderful time
[51:59] to be alive not not wonderful in the
[52:01] sense that what you see is wonderful but
[52:04] wonderful because the word has prepared
[52:06] us for all these things and we can use
[52:09] these things to know exactly where we're
[52:11] standing it's wonderful to know that
[52:13] we're right here at the blending of Time
[52:15] and Eternity it's wonderful to know that
[52:18] we're right here at the coming back of
[52:19] the Lord Jesus Christ it's wonderful to
[52:22] know that very soon we're going to get a
[52:24] body change in a moment in a twinkling
[52:26] eye it is a wonderful time to be living
[52:29] in it's wonderful because we know that
[52:32] the coming of the Lord is at hand and
[52:34] that our Redemption draweth nigh listen
[52:38] what you're seeing on the streets and
[52:39] what you're seeing in the in the
[52:41] entertainment world and what you're
[52:42] seeing in the LGB agenda and and the
[52:46] evil coming from every side what we see
[52:48] going on in Israel all of these things
[52:50] are signs of the
[52:52] times every one of these things are as
[52:55] we would say the handwriting on the
[52:57] wall church it's going home time church
[53:01] it's time to to make sure your lamps are
[53:03] trimmed and bright it's to time to check
[53:05] up it's time to make sure there's oil in
[53:07] the lamp it's not time to play church
[53:09] this is the going home of the Bride this
[53:12] is the coming of the Lord this is the
[53:14] rapture we are in it we are in the midst
[53:17] of it wake up and look around and
[53:18] recognize where you're
[53:22] standing it is a wonderful time
[53:25] handwritings on the wall and I want to
[53:27] encourage you tonight not to allow all
[53:29] these things to become heavy upon
[53:31] you it's not something that's to weigh
[53:34] you down oh my goodness look what's
[53:35] going on here and can you believe this
[53:36] and can you believe that yes I can
[53:38] believe it it was foretold we've been
[53:41] believing it for years why is it
[53:42] shocking you now we've been saying it
[53:44] was coming for years why is it shocking
[53:46] us now Jesus said men's heart failing
[53:49] for fear don't let that be you your
[53:52] heart shouldn't be failing for fear in
[53:54] that moment he says lift up your heads
[53:58] look up to the sky your Redemption
[54:01] draweth nigh it's time to celebrate
[54:04] evening like Tabernacle and recognize
[54:06] the realities of where we're at it's
[54:09] going home
[54:16] time even if you're a casual student of
[54:19] the scripture even a casual student of
[54:22] the message what we should see what we
[54:24] see should cause our heart to Rejoice
[54:27] because it's
[54:29] fulfillment it's fulfillment of what's
[54:31] been laying there all long it's
[54:32] fulfillment of what we've been told and
[54:34] of what has been spoken and fulfillment
[54:36] is the greatest
[54:38] Vindication think about it fulfillment
[54:40] is the greatest Vindication so what this
[54:42] does is give me greater Faith than I've
[54:45] ever had before he said this and it's
[54:48] fulfilled he said this and it's
[54:49] fulfilled he said this and it's
[54:51] fulfilled if that part's true then so is
[54:54] the rest of it the rest of is true the
[54:56] body change is true the Rapture is true
[54:59] the marriage supper of the Lamb is true
[55:01] eternity is true it's all true it's
[55:04] being fulfilled right in front of your
[55:06] face it shouldn't fear bring fear in
[55:08] your heart but it should make your heart
[55:10] Rejoice it's all true it's all happening
[55:14] everything I've held dear everything I
[55:15] believed is happening right before my
[55:17] very
[55:19] eyes
[55:20] Hallelujah if that part's true then it's
[55:23] all true we're about about to go home we
[55:27] are about to go home we've come to the
[55:31] place where it's either true or it
[55:35] isn't it's either a reality or it
[55:38] isn't and yet it doesn't scare me to
[55:40] make a statement like that because I
[55:42] look at one thing after another being
[55:44] fulfilled I can't imagine falling away
[55:46] right
[55:47] now I can't imagine looking around right
[55:50] now and going no brother Bram wasn't the
[55:53] prophet e each and every day more is
[55:56] fulfilled each and every day I I'm
[55:59] reminded and my faith is lifted up that
[56:01] yes this is the true Prophet yes this
[56:03] message is the truth yes this message
[56:05] foretold this yes this message came to
[56:08] prepare my heart to turn my heart that I
[56:11] would be ready when these things came
[56:12] upon the Earth and I would not be called
[56:16] unawares when these things come to pass
[56:19] I like how the scripture says then look
[56:21] up and lift up your heads
[56:25] for your Redemption draweth
[56:27] nigh I didn't break down the Greek words
[56:30] or get into it but just as I read it I
[56:32] noticed that there was a distinction
[56:34] there says then look up and lift up your
[56:38] heads which indicated there was a people
[56:40] for a Time who had their heads hanging
[56:42] down who had their heads down wondering
[56:44] is it ever going to come to pass or is
[56:46] this really the truth and they were
[56:48] wondering and they were doubting and
[56:49] maybe they were those people that said
[56:51] Lord I believe but help my unbelief and
[56:53] sometimes your head gets down you get
[56:55] beat down life comes at us fast
[56:57] sometimes things catch us unaware but he
[57:00] don't want this to catch you unaware so
[57:02] he says go ahead lift your head up go
[57:04] ahead quit looking at the ground quit
[57:06] looking over here and over here lift
[57:08] your head up and look up your Redemption
[57:11] draweth nigh lift your head up you're
[57:14] not going to be left holding the bag
[57:16] lift your head up there's a truth to the
[57:17] Rapture lift your head up your children
[57:19] are coming home lift your head up our
[57:22] God will not leave us forsaken
[57:25] lift your head up your Redemption
[57:27] draweth
[57:28] [Applause]
[57:32] nigh he's made sure that we are properly
[57:36] equipped to stand and to be the final
[57:39] voice to the final
[57:40] age although this is the darkest hour
[57:43] and the age most full of doubt the age
[57:46] full of the most
[57:48] unbelief even though we stack all that
[57:50] up and say that we above all other ages
[57:53] are without excuse
[57:56] even though there may be more stacked
[57:57] against us in many ways we are without
[57:59] excuse because you have been given more
[58:01] than any other
[58:02] age there has been more light shown to
[58:05] you than in any other age we're not
[58:08] having to go around and PR at truth and
[58:10] and PR at Mysteries and wonder and and
[58:13] maybe and and could this be you're not
[58:16] having to go out and fight battles with
[58:18] partial
[58:20] truth think of the courage that took to
[58:22] stand there with small of
[58:25] truth but in this day the whole arsenal
[58:28] has opened up to you every weapon you
[58:31] have need of everything you have need of
[58:33] every mystery revealed the seals torn
[58:35] open it's all right there for you it's
[58:38] all been opened up and we've had more
[58:40] revealed to us than any other age and so
[58:43] therefore we are better equipped than
[58:45] any other
[58:47] age better equipped to stand in the
[58:50] darkness than any other age because we
[58:52] have a light that shines forth
[58:55] now that being said God has equipped
[58:57] every age for the challenge that they
[58:59] would
[59:00] face there was no age left standing
[59:02] fighting
[59:03] alone there was anointing that came for
[59:06] every age and none of those ages had had
[59:10] to face had to face that age without the
[59:12] anointing for their day and we're going
[59:15] to go into that for just a minute just
[59:16] to show how God never leaves us fighting
[59:19] alone he never leaves you there just
[59:22] hoping you'll be okay but he provides
[59:24] exactly what you're going to have need
[59:25] of to make it through wherever you're at
[59:27] tonight he's provided what you're going
[59:29] to need to make it through listen you're
[59:30] not going
[59:31] under you're not going down you're not
[59:35] going to lose everything he's already
[59:37] provided he's already provided to make
[59:40] sure listen you're not going to go down
[59:42] with that sickness he's already provided
[59:43] the healing you're not going to lose
[59:45] your children he's already provided
[59:47] salvation we're not going to lose in
[59:49] this day he's already went to prepare us
[59:50] a place it's already there and he's
[59:52] going to make sure that we get there as
[59:54] well well he had so much confidence and
[59:57] I know I said this last time but it
[59:58] strikes my heart so much confidence that
[1:00:00] you were going to be there that he went
[1:00:02] ahead and went to prepare a place for
[1:00:03] you to come to he didn't do that
[1:00:05] thinking nobody's going to show up he
[1:00:07] said I know they're coming I know
[1:00:09] they're going to make it I'm going to
[1:00:10] make sure they make it I'm so sure of it
[1:00:13] I'm going to go hang the gates I'm going
[1:00:14] to pave the streets I'm going to get
[1:00:16] everything ready I know they're coming
[1:00:19] and he's already prepared it for
[1:00:21] [Applause]
[1:00:23] you
[1:00:25] but the anointings that we've know of
[1:00:27] down Through the Ages the four living
[1:00:29] creatures the lion the ox the man and
[1:00:31] the
[1:00:32] eagle as the Antichrist Spirit would go
[1:00:35] out in each
[1:00:37] age God would release an anointing to
[1:00:41] combat what the Antichrist Spirit was
[1:00:45] doing it it's it's actually as I read it
[1:00:48] a a direct interpretation or fulfillment
[1:00:51] of what the scripture means when it says
[1:00:52] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:00:55] I will raise up a standard against it
[1:00:57] when the enemy released this God
[1:00:59] released this when the Antichrist would
[1:01:02] come and ride this way God would release
[1:01:03] this to combat it
[1:01:05] so it was each anointing was prepared
[1:01:08] exactly for the time that it was needed
[1:01:11] it was what they needed in that time
[1:01:13] even if we can't understand it
[1:01:17] today as the White Horse rode out in in
[1:01:20] the early ages brother Brandon would
[1:01:22] tell us it was a Teaching Ministry and
[1:01:24] the Antichrist went out in a Teaching
[1:01:26] Ministry and so God sent out the
[1:01:29] lion and the lion which was the word and
[1:01:33] he sends out the the true word he sends
[1:01:35] out arenius and he sends out polycarp
[1:01:37] and others and he sends out his own
[1:01:40] teaching the teaching of the true word
[1:01:42] to withstand the false teaching and to
[1:01:44] ensure that the True Vine would have
[1:01:47] exactly what they needed that they would
[1:01:49] have the true word to stand on so he
[1:01:51] sends that out to to ensure that the
[1:01:53] elect would not be
[1:01:55] deceived millions in that teaching of
[1:01:58] the Antichrist were swept away and and
[1:02:00] the church fell
[1:02:02] away by the teachings of this Antichrist
[1:02:05] Spirit by the white horse rider but the
[1:02:07] line of the tribe of Judah the true word
[1:02:10] was released to ensure that the True
[1:02:13] Vine would be there that the True Vine
[1:02:16] would not fall away so that early church
[1:02:18] go back and read the church age book the
[1:02:20] early church had healings and they had
[1:02:22] Miracles and visions and had power
[1:02:25] because the Living Word in the form of
[1:02:28] the line was there to combat the
[1:02:30] falsehoods of the Antichrist Spirit to
[1:02:33] combat the formalism to combat the
[1:02:36] nickan ism to combat those things that
[1:02:38] was sweeping all these people away God
[1:02:40] said I will not allow my elect to be
[1:02:42] deceived I will not allow the True Vine
[1:02:44] to be deceived so I'm sending my word
[1:02:47] I'm sending the lion down there to stand
[1:02:49] on their
[1:02:51] behalf it's a prepared standard it's
[1:02:55] what he's got ready a prepared anointing
[1:02:57] that God releases to give the people
[1:02:59] overcoming power in their day listen he
[1:03:02] doesn't expect you to stand
[1:03:04] alone what he expects you to do is take
[1:03:07] what he gives you and use it to stand
[1:03:10] and overcome the enemy in your day he's
[1:03:13] not expecting you just to pull yourself
[1:03:15] up by the bootstraps but he says no I've
[1:03:17] sent a message in this day I send an
[1:03:19] anointing in this day I don't expect you
[1:03:21] to do it alone but I expect you to pick
[1:03:23] up what I gave you and go to war with it
[1:03:26] pick up what I've given you and use it
[1:03:28] to stand use it to fight use it to
[1:03:31] overcome it will be victorious because
[1:03:33] it's the anointing he's released in this
[1:03:35] day for you to
[1:03:37] use so then the Antichrist sends out the
[1:03:40] red horse rider in the Dark
[1:03:42] Ages which we know takes peace from off
[1:03:44] the Earth and God releases the ox
[1:03:49] anointing under this anointing they gave
[1:03:51] their lives by the Millions
[1:03:54] they gave their lives for Christ they
[1:03:56] gave it freely gallantly Untold bravery
[1:04:01] how because they were under an
[1:04:03] anointing that was the anointing for
[1:04:06] that age and brother brandham tells us
[1:04:08] in the fifth seal that we can only work
[1:04:11] by the spirit that God releases into the
[1:04:14] age that we are living
[1:04:16] in he says you can only work under the
[1:04:19] spirit that God releases into the age
[1:04:22] that you're living in so the truth Vine
[1:04:25] will respond to the anointing of the age
[1:04:28] and they won't fight against the
[1:04:31] anointing of the age notice it's the job
[1:04:33] of the false Vine to fight against the
[1:04:35] anointing that's been released by God
[1:04:38] that is there to protect the elect but
[1:04:40] the elect will receive that anointing
[1:04:42] and move with that anointing and work
[1:04:44] under that anointing to accomplish all
[1:04:46] that God has called them to accomplish
[1:04:48] in that day they work with it listen
[1:04:51] that's why we preach what we preach
[1:04:53] that's why we preach how we preach
[1:04:55] that's why we preach the Supernatural
[1:04:57] That's why we preach the gifts and
[1:04:59] that's why we that's why we preach the
[1:05:00] Miracles and that's why we preach the
[1:05:02] restored word because all of that was
[1:05:04] released to us in this day for a purpose
[1:05:07] I'm not going to fight against it I'm
[1:05:09] going to move with it and say Lord You
[1:05:11] released it you restored it you opened
[1:05:13] it I must need it to withand in this
[1:05:16] evil day I must need it to withand the
[1:05:18] pale horse rider I must need it so I'm
[1:05:21] going to move with
[1:05:23] it
[1:05:26] amen it was released to us in this day
[1:05:30] to prepare us to be the final voice to
[1:05:33] the final age and we must respond to it
[1:05:36] and work with it and move under
[1:05:40] it brother Bram says what did they do
[1:05:44] they willingly walked up there and died
[1:05:47] they didn't but care because the spirit
[1:05:50] of the church in that day was sacrifice
[1:05:53] labor and and they walked up just as
[1:05:55] freely as they could walk Anointed with
[1:05:57] the true spirit of God of that age and
[1:06:01] died like Heroes a sacrifice thousands
[1:06:05] times thousands 68 million of them on
[1:06:08] the
[1:06:10] record and then the black horse goes out
[1:06:14] and God uses the wisdom of man to combat
[1:06:16] it or the wisdom of God working through
[1:06:19] men men anointed to use their
[1:06:21] intelligence to combat the Antichrist
[1:06:24] this was the age of the Reformation with
[1:06:27] men like Luther and Wesley and many
[1:06:29] others and God gave man the spirit of
[1:06:31] wisdom that they were able to
[1:06:34] recognize and withstand the lies of the
[1:06:37] Catholic
[1:06:38] Church men like Luther begin to see that
[1:06:40] things wasn't right and that the just
[1:06:42] should live by faith men like Wesley
[1:06:45] recognized that the blood of Christ
[1:06:46] would sanctify life and that you didn't
[1:06:48] have to pay penants and and do all these
[1:06:51] different things that they began to
[1:06:52] recognize that and God began to reveal
[1:06:54] it to them and God used those men to to
[1:06:57] fight against the corruption in the
[1:06:59] church and bring the church back to God
[1:07:01] once again and when I say church I mean
[1:07:03] the True Vine the
[1:07:05] elect and then finally the Antichrist
[1:07:08] gets on his Pale Horse and goes on his
[1:07:10] death
[1:07:11] ride that's the age we live in it's pale
[1:07:14] it's grayish there's nothing right
[1:07:17] there's nothing wrong live how you want
[1:07:21] do what you think's okay there's death
[1:07:23] in the World death in the church do
[1:07:26] exactly what you want to do and I'll
[1:07:28] tell you what that produces the
[1:07:29] scripture even tells us it produces it
[1:07:31] if you live that way it produces
[1:07:34] hell because right behind this horse
[1:07:37] rider Hell Followed because everywhere
[1:07:39] he went that's exactly what he produced
[1:07:41] and that's exactly where that type of
[1:07:42] thinking will lead you is Straight to
[1:07:44] Hell listen there are standards there
[1:07:47] are things that matter the word matters
[1:07:49] one of the biggest tricks the devil ever
[1:07:51] played on people was that little things
[1:07:53] don't matter matter oh why you making a
[1:07:56] big deal about it listen if it's in the
[1:07:57] word if it was ever a big deal it's
[1:07:59] still a big deal just because things
[1:08:01] have become socially acceptable all of a
[1:08:03] sudden doesn't mean that it's acceptable
[1:08:05] to
[1:08:06] God listen so much so there's a there
[1:08:08] there's a quote that always really
[1:08:09] Pricks my heart and makes me do a lot of
[1:08:11] repenting because brother brandham said
[1:08:13] that if you have an ALT in your heart
[1:08:15] towards someone an ALT that's like a I'm
[1:08:18] not sure the exact definition but maybe
[1:08:19] a
[1:08:20] grudge he says you are in danger of
[1:08:23] Hellfire
[1:08:24] so don't tell me something's not a big
[1:08:26] deal if it puts me in danger of Hell
[1:08:29] Fire it's a big deal and I understand
[1:08:31] that as human beings we can't all walk
[1:08:33] in absolute perfection but under the
[1:08:35] blood of Jesus you can and the way you
[1:08:37] do it is by recognizing if his word says
[1:08:39] it it's a big deal if God cares I should
[1:08:42] care and I'm going to walk according to
[1:08:45] the ordinances of his word under the
[1:08:47] power of the Holy Ghost as perfect as I
[1:08:50] can because God cares because things are
[1:08:55] a big
[1:08:56] deal and the pale horse rider Goes Forth
[1:08:59] and hail's following it but God didn't
[1:09:02] leave us here
[1:09:03] unprepared he didn't leave us here
[1:09:05] without something to combat but in that
[1:09:07] moment he releases the eagle anointing
[1:09:10] in this day he releases a message into
[1:09:13] this day and listen it's no longer us
[1:09:15] pointing back and saying oh look isn't
[1:09:17] it amazing how they overcame under the
[1:09:19] ox anointing isn't it amazing how they
[1:09:21] overcame under the lion under the man
[1:09:24] this is no longer a historical thing
[1:09:26] this is you taking the anointing that's
[1:09:28] been given in your day and doing what
[1:09:30] they did and that's withstanding the
[1:09:32] Antichrist spirit it's your time to
[1:09:35] stand it's your time to write your
[1:09:37] chapter in the book it's your time to
[1:09:39] take what God's given you and stand up
[1:09:41] and fight and say I will not Bend I Will
[1:09:43] Not Bow I will not back up it's the most
[1:09:45] evil age but God has given me an
[1:09:48] anointing God has prepared me with a
[1:09:50] message to stand in this final day it's
[1:09:54] our turn to stand it's our turn to run
[1:09:58] it's our turn to operate under the
[1:09:59] anointing of our age and under the
[1:10:01] message of our day and withstand all the
[1:10:05] evil that has been released by The Pale
[1:10:06] Horse Rider to withstand this Godless
[1:10:09] age to stand like the Hebrew children I
[1:10:12] understand it's hotter than it's ever
[1:10:13] been before but I ain't bowing I
[1:10:16] understand it's worse than it's ever
[1:10:17] been before but I ain't bowing I
[1:10:19] understand that things have been
[1:10:20] released and there's demons everywhere
[1:10:22] and they're beating on a door but I am
[1:10:25] not bowing and he's not expecting you to
[1:10:27] do it on his own he's just looking for
[1:10:29] somebody to square their shoulders back
[1:10:30] and he'll pour that anointing out upon
[1:10:32] you and give you strength and give you
[1:10:34] courage and give you ability to stand in
[1:10:37] the evil day and when you've done all to
[1:10:39] stand stand therefore how am I going to
[1:10:42] stand when I've done all to stand he
[1:10:44] gives me the strength the eagle
[1:10:46] anointing is poured out in this day to
[1:10:48] give you strength to
[1:10:52] stand
[1:10:54] he didn't bring us here
[1:10:58] unprepared in every age he equipped them
[1:11:00] with the power they
[1:11:02] needed for what they were going to face
[1:11:05] and for what he wanted accomplished and
[1:11:08] in this age he wanted it all
[1:11:10] accomplished he wants it all wrapped up
[1:11:13] he wants it culminated with the
[1:11:15] resurrection he wants it wrapped up with
[1:11:17] the body change and with the Rapture and
[1:11:20] under the eagle anointing the anointing
[1:11:22] that could go higher than any of the
[1:11:24] other anointings and see more than any
[1:11:27] of the others could see he comes and he
[1:11:29] breaks the seals off the book he
[1:11:31] restores Bible truth and he finishes the
[1:11:33] Mysteries and he gives us everything
[1:11:35] that we would have need of to prepare us
[1:11:38] to stand to prepare us to fight to
[1:11:40] prepare us to win to prepare us to
[1:11:43] Rapture brother bam says and then at the
[1:11:46] last power he brings down the eagle to
[1:11:49] restore the children back to the
[1:11:51] original Faith again of their fathers
[1:11:53] the eagle Agee then you notice there is
[1:11:56] no more beast that's all of it that's
[1:11:58] the end now if you would now take
[1:12:00] Revelation 10 1-7 he said I've been
[1:12:03] referring to it he says remember in the
[1:12:06] last messenger age see what was to
[1:12:08] happen all of the mysteries of God would
[1:12:11] be revealed the eagle
[1:12:14] amen the eagle age where we operate not
[1:12:19] as looking through a glass Darkly but
[1:12:21] where it's all open to us
[1:12:24] Jericho has fallen the land is yours
[1:12:26] you're in a new land now go take it Go
[1:12:29] and possess what's been made available
[1:12:30] to you it's the most evil of all ages
[1:12:35] Satan's released everything he has into
[1:12:37] this age as we said there's demons from
[1:12:39] the river Euphrates here The Pale Horse
[1:12:41] has done his work the world is in chaos
[1:12:44] we're on the verge of World War I the
[1:12:47] world is turning on Israel America is
[1:12:50] turning on
[1:12:51] Israel every day I I see more videos of
[1:12:54] pro Palestinian riots in the streets of
[1:12:56] the United States of
[1:12:58] America we're standing here on the very
[1:13:01] Brink we're at the very end oh does that
[1:13:04] make you nervous nope I'm not even
[1:13:06] hardly seeing that anymore CU I'm so
[1:13:08] focused up because the word says when
[1:13:10] you see these things come to pass look
[1:13:12] up your Redemption draweth nigh it's
[1:13:15] time church and we're not pointing to
[1:13:17] the Future I'm not even saying it's very
[1:13:19] soon I'm saying it's now I'm saying it's

[1:13:37] this and now you must stand and be the
[1:13:39] voice stand and declare that there is a
[1:13:42] living God that that that there is truth
[1:13:44] that there is a new
[1:13:46] birth there must be a people on the
[1:13:48] Earth at this time giving voice to truth
[1:13:52] there's so many other voices
[1:13:56] someone has to be giving voice to
[1:13:59] Truth Listen we can't go silently into
[1:14:02] the
[1:14:03] night it's not our job just to blend in
[1:14:07] you can't blend in and I ain't telling
[1:14:09] you you got to go stand on every street
[1:14:10] corner and preach but your life better
[1:14:12] be preaching loud and
[1:14:13] clear you better be preaching loud and
[1:14:16] clear the realities of a living God the
[1:14:19] miraculous God the supernatural God
[1:14:22] because he's done his
[1:14:24] part he has done his part in making the
[1:14:27] preparations he provided and prepared a
[1:14:30] message he PR uh prepared and provided
[1:14:33] an anointing but what are you going to
[1:14:36] do with
[1:14:37] it what are you going to do with
[1:14:40] it so many times we don't we don't step
[1:14:43] into it fully because we're so bogged
[1:14:45] down by our own
[1:14:46] ideas so bogged down on how we think it
[1:14:49] should be when there's a Vindicated word
[1:14:51] telling us exactly how it is
[1:14:53] quit getting caught up in the little
[1:14:55] side things quit getting caught up and
[1:14:57] bogged down and step into the anointing
[1:15:00] that's been sent for this day throw
[1:15:02] aside your ideas tonight and use what
[1:15:05] God has prepared for you to
[1:15:07] use you got to you got to put on the
[1:15:11] message it's like it's like a coat or an
[1:15:13] outfit you got to put it on you got to
[1:15:15] wrap yourself in it and let it begin to
[1:15:18] change your life let the Holy Ghost take
[1:15:21] over your life because it's the only
[1:15:23] thing that will bring you victory in
[1:15:24] this day it's the only thing that will
[1:15:26] defeat the Devil in this
[1:15:29] day it's
[1:15:31] tested it's tried we saw it in this
[1:15:34] generation and yes I'll point back for a
[1:15:36] minute we saw it in brother brandom's
[1:15:38] day night after night after night defeat
[1:15:41] the devil and he told us that the word
[1:15:43] will defeat the Satan any place anywhere
[1:15:45] any time Bring It Forward we've seen it
[1:15:48] right here Time After Time After Time
[1:15:51] the message and the word of God is time
[1:15:53] I'm
[1:15:54] tested so I'm kind of like David when
[1:15:56] Saul came to when you come to me with an
[1:15:58] idea well I think this what about that
[1:15:59] I'm kind of like David I'm like you know
[1:16:02] that might be okay for
[1:16:03] you that might work for you but I'm the
[1:16:06] one fing to step down here into this
[1:16:08] Valley I think I'll go with what God
[1:16:10] provided for me I think I'll go with
[1:16:12] what I know Works what I know is God's
[1:16:14] with this slingshot I don't know about
[1:16:16] your sword I don't know about your armor
[1:16:19] but when I went into battle with this I
[1:16:21] came out Victorious and then I went in
[1:16:22] again in and I came out Victorious so
[1:16:25] tonight I'm going in with the same
[1:16:27] weapon it works it works it works it
[1:16:30] works every single time it works I'm
[1:16:33] going to stick with what I know with
[1:16:35] what God has given me to fight
[1:16:38] with I'm going to use what I know God is
[1:16:41] in and I know God is in his word I know
[1:16:44] God is in this
[1:16:46] message I'm going to operate under the
[1:16:48] anointing that God has brought in this
[1:16:50] day to make sure I make it amen
[1:16:55] there's many people out there that
[1:16:57] believe there's many that believe in
[1:17:00] Deliverance there's many that believe in
[1:17:02] the power of the Lord Jesus and even
[1:17:03] believe for a
[1:17:06] Rapture but they're going out to conquer
[1:17:08] and they're going out to do battle with
[1:17:10] what they think and they go out to fight
[1:17:13] with their
[1:17:14] ideas or else they or else they go out
[1:17:17] with the ideas of their family or how
[1:17:18] daddy thought or how Mama
[1:17:21] thought and all of us
[1:17:24] have a paradigm that we see life through
[1:17:27] the way we see things all of us and a
[1:17:30] lot of it is determined by the house you
[1:17:32] were brought up in that's not unique to
[1:17:35] you we all do but we all have to throw
[1:17:38] those things aside and forget it as
[1:17:41] though it were dung and say Lord what
[1:17:42] does the word say what did the prophet
[1:17:45] say what does the Holy Scripture say I
[1:17:47] have to lay those things aside and throw
[1:17:49] them down and use what God has prepared
[1:17:52] use what's been tested use a word that's
[1:17:54] been Vindicated Time After Time use the
[1:17:58] anointing that God sent to make sure
[1:18:00] you'd be victorious listen in that day
[1:18:03] it seemed as though of all the people
[1:18:05] there Saul more than any of them was the
[1:18:09] one that looked as if he should go out
[1:18:11] and fight Goliath looked as if he was
[1:18:14] the one that could be
[1:18:16] victorious but it was David who was
[1:18:18] operating under a fresh
[1:18:20] anointing think about it it was David
[1:18:23] with the experience of fighting enemies
[1:18:26] that seem bigger and stronger David had
[1:18:29] the
[1:18:32] experience one thing when this message
[1:18:34] came and turned our hearts back to the
[1:18:36] faith it pointed us back to the truth of
[1:18:38] the new
[1:18:39] birth to the truth of the genuine
[1:18:42] Pentecostal experience this message told
[1:18:45] us over and over and over again you must
[1:18:48] be born again you must have the token
[1:18:50] you must have the new birth because
[1:18:53] without that you're no more than a Saul
[1:18:55] who is well trained and yet cannot face
[1:18:57] the Giants in the
[1:18:59] land that's right that's all you are no
[1:19:02] I'm not saying you can't be more than
[1:19:03] that that's all I was before the Holy
[1:19:05] Ghost came I was a Saul I couldn't face
[1:19:08] my Giants I might could quote quotes I
[1:19:10] might could quote scriptures listen you
[1:19:12] may come and you may dress the part
[1:19:14] nobody looked better than Saul matter of
[1:19:17] fact his army was well dressed they were
[1:19:19] well trained they had long hair they had
[1:19:21] long skirts they did things right they
[1:19:23] didn't curse they had prayer
[1:19:26] time but when Goliath showed up they had
[1:19:28] no power they had no Authority they
[1:19:32] wouldn't go into the valley and face
[1:19:33] their giant but there came one who had
[1:19:35] an
[1:19:36] experience there came one who knew that
[1:19:38] his God was a living God because he had
[1:19:40] had Deliverance after deliverance and he
[1:19:42] had met God for himself and he was
[1:19:44] willing and able to go into the valley
[1:19:47] he was willing and able to go down into
[1:19:49] that because without that like I said
[1:19:51] you're no you're no more than a Saul and
[1:19:53] when you're in that condition you cannot
[1:19:55] fulfill being bone of his bone you
[1:19:58] cannot fulfill the the the the the being
[1:20:01] the final voice to the final age brother
[1:20:03] brandham says if there was one man in
[1:20:05] the whole nation of Israel that would
[1:20:07] have been equipped physically to fight
[1:20:08] the giant it was Saul said he was Head
[1:20:11] and Shoulders above his entire Army he
[1:20:14] was well Tred he knowed all the
[1:20:16] maneuvering how to handle the spear
[1:20:18] let's put it in terms like this he knew
[1:20:19] all the quotes he knew all the
[1:20:21] scriptures he could quot circles around
[1:20:23] you he knew all the Maneuvers how to
[1:20:26] handle the spear how to hold his shield
[1:20:28] how to knock a lick off not only that
[1:20:30] but he was the trainer of
[1:20:33] men
[1:20:35] Minister he stood up and told others how
[1:20:37] to do
[1:20:38] it the largest man in the nation the
[1:20:41] best trained man in the nation but one
[1:20:43] of the biggest cowards in the nation and
[1:20:45] that's the way it is today it doesn't
[1:20:47] take the educated and the trained but he
[1:20:50] had never put God to a test
[1:20:53] test he says but one day from way back
[1:20:56] on the back side of the desert come a
[1:20:57] little Ruddy looking drawed up not Jesse
[1:21:00] son David a little sheep skinned coat on
[1:21:03] him was packing a slingshot in his hand
[1:21:06] that giant made his brag at the wrong
[1:21:08] time David looked over and said do you
[1:21:10] mean to tell me that you'll let that
[1:21:12] uncircumcised Philistine stand up there
[1:21:14] and defy the armies of the Living God
[1:21:16] could you imagine the littlest man on
[1:21:19] the ground taking up his challenge the
[1:21:21] biggest man in the trained man and the
[1:21:23] more equipped man to fight the man was a
[1:21:25] coward brother now listen I read this
[1:21:28] quote for this line it doesn't lay in
[1:21:31] training it lays in
[1:21:36] experience it doesn't lay in your
[1:21:38] training it doesn't lay in your head
[1:21:40] knowledge it lays in
[1:21:43] experience Moses had
[1:21:45] training and all the training he had he
[1:21:48] killed one Egyptian and had to run away
[1:21:50] from what God had called him to do
[1:21:53] he had to run away from what he was
[1:21:54] called to do but just five minutes in
[1:21:56] the presence of The Burning Bush was
[1:21:58] greater than 40 years of training down
[1:22:00] in Egypt and as long as you're relying
[1:22:02] on what you know or who mama is or who
[1:22:04] daddy is and and this and that and the
[1:22:06] other you're going to end up running
[1:22:07] from the commission that God has called
[1:22:10] you to complete but the minute you get
[1:22:12] in his presence and allow his presence
[1:22:14] to get in you it changes everything
[1:22:16] that's when you can fulfill what you're
[1:22:18] called to do that's when you can be the
[1:22:20] final voice that's when you can overcome
[1:22:22] every devil that's when you can take a
[1:22:24] Rapture when you meet God for yourself
[1:22:27] and it's no longer training but it's an
[1:22:29] experience that you've had for
[1:22:33] yourself only then was Moses able to
[1:22:35] fulfill the commission that God had
[1:22:37] called him to
[1:22:42] fulfill it's not about your head
[1:22:46] knowledge you can try all you want to I
[1:22:50] know I speak from experience I wanted to
[1:22:52] do right I wanted to be good I tried all
[1:22:55] I want to and ended up running away
[1:22:57] whipped every single
[1:22:59] time I don't mind saying it I know who I
[1:23:02] was and I know what a failure I was but
[1:23:04] I know what happened when I met him and
[1:23:06] allowed him to take control of my life
[1:23:08] it's not about how much you know you're
[1:23:11] going to end up defeated every time
[1:23:12] until you have that experience you're
[1:23:14] going to end up hiding in your tent just
[1:23:16] like sa Saul did it's not about your
[1:23:19] manufactured
[1:23:21] holiness it's okay you don't have to get
[1:23:23] quiet it's not about that it it's not
[1:23:26] it's not about your spiritual ideas and
[1:23:28] and how spiritual you can be and how you
[1:23:30] can turn every daily event into some
[1:23:32] kind of spiritual riddle that ain't what
[1:23:34] this is about is have you met God do you
[1:23:37] know him have you been born again and if
[1:23:40] you have you can stand in this day you
[1:23:43] can overcome you're going to make it
[1:23:46] that settles it oh it's so complicated
[1:23:48] no do you know God do you have the new
[1:23:51] birth have you met him for for yourself
[1:23:53] have you had your backside of the desert
[1:23:55] experience it's a simple question
[1:23:57] because you must be born again that's
[1:24:00] what it's all
[1:24:02] about that's what you have to have has
[1:24:06] his life come into your
[1:24:09] life have you taken what he has prepared
[1:24:11] for us and prepared yourself with
[1:24:17] it because we have a job to do we have
[1:24:21] to finish the race we have to be the
[1:24:23] final voice and as I've said over and
[1:24:26] over you have been equipped to be the
[1:24:28] final voice you have been equipped to
[1:24:30] stand in this day he has very
[1:24:33] specifically sent a word for this day so
[1:24:35] that you would be prepared and equipped
[1:24:37] listen I I I know that the word is the
[1:24:40] word is the word
[1:24:42] sometimes this can be confusing to some
[1:24:44] people but just just briefly the word
[1:24:47] that Luther brought is still the word
[1:24:49] today it's still 100% sent the truth the
[1:24:54] just shall live by faith we still must
[1:24:57] have
[1:24:58] justification it's still the word the
[1:25:01] word that Wesley brought is still the
[1:25:03] word today we still believe in
[1:25:07] sanctification but as the light moves on
[1:25:09] it reveals more so when we say something
[1:25:12] like the message of that day doesn't
[1:25:14] work today it's not that we throw away
[1:25:17] what was revealed in those days is that
[1:25:19] it can no longer stand alone
[1:25:23] it can no longer stand alone there has
[1:25:25] been more revealed and the light has
[1:25:26] Shone greater and now you must have that
[1:25:30] you must have Luther's message plus
[1:25:33] Wesley's message plus the restoration
[1:25:37] plus the unfolding of the word you must
[1:25:39] have all of that plus that's what we
[1:25:41] mean by a message for this day the
[1:25:43] message of this day didn't tear that
[1:25:45] down it built upon that it tied up all
[1:25:48] the Loose Ends and God restored it all
[1:25:50] in one glorious message message to
[1:25:52] prepare you to stand and he sent it
[1:25:55] under an eagle
[1:25:57] anointing brother Bram says the pilgrim
[1:26:00] fathers were very thankful for their new
[1:26:02] found way of life being separated from
[1:26:04] the old English denominations and Creed
[1:26:06] they could marry to the new anointed
[1:26:09] word for their
[1:26:10] age that's right the new anointed word
[1:26:14] of their age for their day so we can be
[1:26:18] thankful as pilgrims like Abraham
[1:26:20] separated ourselves from the things of
[1:26:22] the world all of our Associates Abraham
[1:26:24] was a pilgrim God has separated us from
[1:26:26] all the dead religions I'm speaking
[1:26:28] across the Nations now all the dead
[1:26:30] Creeds and to what separated us and
[1:26:33] opened to us a new land a new message
[1:26:37] for this
[1:26:39] day so it's about God preparing and
[1:26:42] equipping you for what you're going to
[1:26:43] face very specifically he doesn't leave
[1:26:46] us fighting alone but he's opened up the
[1:26:48] word specifically for this day so that
[1:26:51] you would be equ equipped to be the
[1:26:53] final voice in this day but in order for
[1:26:56] us to do that there's something we have
[1:26:58] to
[1:27:00] do because Revelation 19:7 says let us
[1:27:03] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:27:04] him for the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:27:06] come and his wife hath made herself
[1:27:10] ready he provided the
[1:27:14] clothing he provided the
[1:27:16] material he said here it is but you got
[1:27:20] to put it on amen you got to willingly
[1:27:24] put it on and If It Don't Fit it ain't a
[1:27:27] material problem it's a you problem you
[1:27:29] got some trimming to do in your
[1:27:32] life he's done everything he's provided
[1:27:36] he's prepared but now the responsibility
[1:27:38] lies with you you have to take the
[1:27:41] message and let it change your life it's
[1:27:43] you seeking God it's you seeking more
[1:27:46] it's you applying the token it's you
[1:27:48] feeding on the word and then you become
[1:27:50] a prepared voice from our opening
[1:27:52] scripture as we begin to come down there
[1:27:54] was a taking of the little
[1:27:56] book then there's a feeding on the
[1:27:59] little
[1:28:00] book and then there is a life that
[1:28:03] begins to prophesy out and speak again
[1:28:06] you take the book and you eat the book
[1:28:08] listen this has to be
[1:28:11] consumed you could put 47 of these in
[1:28:13] every room in your house and it would do
[1:28:15] you no good if it's never opened if it's
[1:28:18] never read if it's never read with an
[1:28:21] attitude of Lord let this change me see
[1:28:24] this that's the problem is many people
[1:28:26] skip the eat it up part they want to
[1:28:28] take the book I accept the message then
[1:28:30] they want to start spewing out all their
[1:28:32] ideas yeah and they skip the eat part
[1:28:36] they skip the part and that's a crucial
[1:28:37] for the part is the eating of the book
[1:28:40] because that allows you to speak what he
[1:28:42] wants spoken when you eat the book it
[1:28:45] allows you to speak that it's what
[1:28:47] prepares you to speak without eating the
[1:28:49] book you have no right to speak it's
[1:28:52] what gives you something to say
[1:28:54] preachers we have to eat the book lay
[1:28:57] members we have to eat the book everyone
[1:29:00] in between we have to eat the book we've
[1:29:02] got way too much speaking and not enough
[1:29:06] eating we've got to eat the book it's
[1:29:09] what's in the book that prepares you to
[1:29:12] speak and how does it do that it
[1:29:14] prepares us by stripping away all of our
[1:29:17] ideas stripping away all the ideas of
[1:29:19] men that have gone on before us and
[1:29:21] return turning us to the
[1:29:23] original yes yes to the original at
[1:29:26] Pentecost but also to the original and
[1:29:28] unchanging thoughts of God oh this
[1:29:31] message took us back before man ever
[1:29:33] existed this message took us back to the
[1:29:36] back parts of God's mind before man
[1:29:38] before Eden before the fall into the
[1:29:40] mind of God and you know what it showed
[1:29:42] when we got there
[1:29:44] you it said you were there a perfect
[1:29:47] thought oh my I'm so un no no no no you
[1:29:50] were in the thoughts of God and God
[1:29:52] doesn't have imperfect
[1:29:54] thoughts it took us all the way back
[1:29:57] there and found you there so it took us
[1:30:00] back before man ever had a
[1:30:02] thought listen there's been many great
[1:30:05] men down Through the Ages with a lot of
[1:30:07] thoughts well-studied
[1:30:10] men well-intentioned
[1:30:12] men who studied and probed and looked
[1:30:15] and had thoughts and expressed those
[1:30:17] thoughts and many times those thoughts
[1:30:19] became Doctrine and accepted ideas and
[1:30:21] they got passed down and they got
[1:30:22] ingrained into church
[1:30:24] theology but this message took us back
[1:30:26] before those thoughts and stripped us of
[1:30:29] all that thinking and it returned us to
[1:30:32] his thinking let this mind be in you he
[1:30:37] sent this message so we wouldn't have to
[1:30:39] rely on our thoughts thank you
[1:30:43] Lord I don't say that towards your
[1:30:45] thoughts I say that towards my thoughts
[1:30:47] I thank God I don't have to rely on my
[1:30:50] thoughts amen
[1:30:52] because sometimes I'm up down inside out
[1:30:54] turned around listen we don't stand up
[1:30:57] here and act like we don't struggle just
[1:30:59] like you do greatest battle ever fought
[1:31:01] is in the mind that goes for all of us
[1:31:05] I'm glad I'm not having to rely on this
[1:31:07] but he took us back before the thoughts
[1:31:09] of man and he said here's the truth
[1:31:11] here's what you can rely on here's what
[1:31:13] you can stand on in this day here's
[1:31:15] what's going to bring you overcoming and
[1:31:17] he sent this message and it made it to
[1:31:19] where you could face death he made it to
[1:31:21] where you could face hell and he made it
[1:31:22] to where you can stand toet to Toe with
[1:31:24] the enemy in this day and know I have
[1:31:27] thus sayith the Lord I can stand with
[1:31:30] thus saith the Lord this bride is
[1:31:33] equipped evening light Tabernacle and
[1:31:35] prepared and when she eats the book it
[1:31:38] shows her saying exactly what the spirit
[1:31:40] is saying over in revelation 22 when you
[1:31:43] eat the book you begin to speak exactly
[1:31:45] what the spirit speaks and what do they
[1:31:48] say they say come come all that are
[1:31:51] thirsty come and drink of the Water of
[1:31:53] Life freely it says come listen I'm
[1:31:55] going to tell you right now that this
[1:31:57] message is not a message of
[1:32:02] judgment Noah's message wasn't a message
[1:32:05] of
[1:32:06] judgment the the angels that went to
[1:32:09] Sodom and said this place is about to
[1:32:11] burn that wasn't judgment that was Mercy
[1:32:15] Mercy warns of judgment and that's all
[1:32:19] that's happening this message warns yes
[1:32:20] it's judgment but this is a message that
[1:32:22] comes forth saying Grace Grace Grace and
[1:32:25] if you're the final voice to the final
[1:32:28] age you'll be saying grace come drink
[1:32:30] get in the ark come drink it's not too
[1:32:33] late but I've had three chances four
[1:32:34] chances five chances come for number six
[1:32:37] come for number seven come for number
[1:32:39] eight the final voice says come on back
[1:32:44] come drink of the Water of Life
[1:32:47] freely that's the final voice to the
[1:32:50] final age
[1:32:54] it's a message of Grace brother Bram
[1:32:56] says I believe that we are now living in
[1:32:57] the last day I believe that this is the
[1:33:00] last message this message of Grace that
[1:33:03] God has given to his
[1:33:06] church if your voice doesn't match
[1:33:09] that then where do you find yourself
[1:33:11] where do you find yourself in the
[1:33:14] scripture well you got to come the way I
[1:33:17] think well you got to come the way our
[1:33:19] church the spirit and the bride just
[1:33:21] said say come and drink freely that
[1:33:24] means free of my ideas free of your
[1:33:27] ideas free of any Rome's ideas and you
[1:33:30] got to pay for it it's free come and
[1:33:33] drink
[1:33:34] freely I believe with all my heart that
[1:33:36] there's a bride on the earth who is
[1:33:39] prepare a prepared voice that is
[1:33:42] speaking only what the spirit speaks
[1:33:45] manifesting Jesus to a Dying World doing
[1:33:48] the works that Jesus did standing for
[1:33:50] truth standing for holiness
[1:33:52] listen he wasn't to get all the way down
[1:33:53] to the end and not have a voice that's
[1:33:57] he wasn't going to get all the way here
[1:33:58] and be silent he wasn't get all the way
[1:34:01] down here and let all these voices of
[1:34:03] deception and lies and evil just run
[1:34:05] rampant without somebody standing that
[1:34:07] he could put his hand on and say Here's
[1:34:09] my voice here's my people here's ones
[1:34:12] that I've Anointed with the eagle
[1:34:13] anointing to stand in the last day I'm
[1:34:15] proud to be identified with them these
[1:34:17] are my people and tonight I say there is
[1:34:20] a voice there is a bride and she has
[1:34:23] thus saith the Lord there's many other
[1:34:26] voices in the land but there's only one
[1:34:28] voice that has thus sayith the Lord what
[1:34:32] is our standard what do we speak we
[1:34:34] speak what his word says

[1:34:45] a way prepared and today he has prepared

[1:35:31] they will throng her streets with joy
[1:35:33] yes it is the last call the spirit will
[1:35:36] not speak in another age the ages are
[1:35:40] over we stand here at that crossing over
[1:35:43] time we stand here at that moment and he
[1:35:46] says I must have a voice I must have one
[1:35:48] who will stand and declare let Satan's
[1:35:50] Eden rage let all hell break loose in
[1:35:53] this Earth but I'm going to stand and
[1:35:55] declare there is a living God there is a
[1:35:57] mighty God there is a God who saves

[1:36:40] are still standards the word of God is
[1:36:42] true and he's coming back for a people
[1:36:44] who sigh and cry for the Abominations
[1:36:47] done in the city he still marks those
[1:36:50] that cry out against what he cried out
[1:36:52] against and stands for what he stands

[1:37:26] horse rider prepare you because those
[1:37:28] things prepare you to
[1:37:29] stay but this message prepares you to
[1:37:33] leave this message prepares you to go

[1:37:55] let's press the battle like never before
[1:37:58] let's press the battle hey look I know
[1:37:59] many of us are tired many of you are
[1:38:01] struggling many of you been on this way
[1:38:02] a long long time we're one day closer
[1:38:04] today than we were
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:08] yesterday you know what was said this
[1:38:11] week just a powerful thought to
[1:38:13] me you know Sharon Rose she ain't
[1:38:17] standing by that gate no more waiting on
[1:38:18] Billy
[1:38:20] Paul
[1:38:22] you know think about it if she was
[1:38:23] standing there
[1:38:27] 1937 and she said I'm
[1:38:30] waiting I don't even know how many years
[1:38:32] that's been it's been a
[1:38:34] lot 80 something years 90 88 years but
[1:38:38] if she was going to stand there and wait
[1:38:40] then to
[1:38:41] her she was just waiting a
[1:38:44] moment there is a sense of time there
[1:38:47] because you see the souls under the
[1:38:48] altar say how
[1:38:50] long and she even uses the term I'm I'm
[1:38:53] waiting so there's a sense of time
[1:38:55] there's also a sense of
[1:38:56] timelessness because she was there a
[1:38:58] while waiting on Billy
[1:39:01] Paul that
[1:39:04] means the city's
[1:39:06] ready everything's ready and he says
[1:39:09] they're breathlessly
[1:39:12] awaiting think about that's how you hold
[1:39:15] your breath maybe just before the bride
[1:39:17] walks down the aisle you know when
[1:39:19] you're sitting in here 20 minutes before
[1:39:21] before the wedding you're not
[1:39:21] breathlessly
[1:39:23] waiting the breathlessly waiting starts
[1:39:25] when the music hits the doors begin to
[1:39:28] open and you
[1:39:30] go and you look that's where we're
[1:39:35] at the gates are starting to open and
[1:39:38] they're starting to look to see who's
[1:39:39] going to walk through that
[1:39:43] door they're going to see
[1:39:46] me they're going to see you because he
[1:39:49] said I've gone to prepare place and I'm
[1:39:52] going to send a prepared anointing and a
[1:39:55] prepared message to make sure you're
[1:39:58] there he's determined you're not going
[1:40:01] to miss
[1:40:02] it he chose you I can't unchoose you
[1:40:05] nobody can and just like he had to
[1:40:08] provide the faith and he had to provide
[1:40:09] the lamb and he had to provide the life
[1:40:11] if he chose you he's got to make sure
[1:40:12] you get there cuz he can't go back on
[1:40:16] it gates are starting to
[1:40:19] open and their breath L
[1:40:22] looking I say here we
[1:40:24] go here we
[1:40:29] come another breath another day another
[1:40:34] week church I don't care how long it
[1:40:37] is it doesn't matter to her 88 years was
[1:40:43] a I just know that I've been
[1:40:46] prepared by a glorious message that
[1:40:48] turned my heart and anointing that came
[1:40:52] and he said this is what I'm releasing
[1:40:54] to make sure they can
[1:40:56] stand and when it looks oh how prepared
[1:40:59] is it I'll tell you how prepared it is I
[1:41:03] don't even have it I'm going to look it
[1:41:04] up
