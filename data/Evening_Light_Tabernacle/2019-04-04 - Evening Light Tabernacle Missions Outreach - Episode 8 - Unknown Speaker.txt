========================================

hi everybody great to join again with you today and we are the ministry team evening like Tabernacle and we have our church here in Minden Louisiana we're happy that you have joined with us today and we hope you'll let your friends know that we're online and and speaking today and we're going to be talking about how the church fell away from its original condition there that as they received on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost and and the Upper Room what a wonderful experience that was but then how that falling away is not simply a an endtime event is been happening now for many many years and this is why a restoration is so needed and promised I'd like to start with a scripture today where Paul said in second Thessalonians two and three let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there be a fallen away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God I think we noted last time that Paul said that they would receive a another Jesus another gospel in another spirit so this would not be Satan in the church saying I am Satan and people worshipping as Satan but rather he would be masquerading as Jesus presenting himself as the the one who actually crucem was crucified gave his life and and many of the concepts of Jesus will be priests but it would be perverted enough that it would be a perverted gospel because that's what Satan likes to do Satan has always always been in religious deception from the very beginning and his ambition throughout the ages has always been to be worshipped like it says that I say a14 I will exalt myself above all that is called God I will be like the Most High I I and that was his desire before the Garden of Eden and there was a war in heaven with Michael the Archangel and that has that ambition has never left just like the scripture that you're reading that his desire was to be worshipped and so from the beginning of time we see Cain and Abel and Cain is not an atheist Cain is religious right and they come out of the same household they're worshiping the same God and but but Cain refuses to worship God's provided way which was blood right and then we see that there's an Ishmaelite in Isaac both from the line of Abraham mmm but one is of God one is a persecutor of the like just like Cain was a persecutor right there's a nice all and a Jacob and Jake now in that case Esau looks like the better guy because he loves his daddy he's bringing him meat but the difference was Jacobs heart was set on the birthright right I will have murder I've got to have the birthright and Esau despised it and that's why the Bible refers to it is that God hated Esau because he despised the birthright of mine but they come out of the same household all the way down through the ages there were two trees in the garden right there was Judas and Jesus and this is striking because Judas is out of the same tribe he's in the inner circle of Jesus and he's the treasurer of the church MA and he has a manifested Ministry of the supernatural casting out of devils and and he comes right out but when he comes to Pentecost he shows his colors so it just shows it's kind of been twins all along down along their mouths winds all the way through yeah the right and the wrong the the this sort of good seed in the soul of bad seed and so on all the way down so you know as Paul said it that there would come a falling away first he calling the man of sin the son of perdition which speaks like Judas he's a betrayer he opposes and exalts himself I think these are key words exalts himself above all that is called God so he puts himself up above everything and then our that is worshipped and that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God so actually then what Paul says is that Satan would actually take over the church and be worshipped right within the framework of the Christian children and none of it called God by surprise no no he knew this is gonna happen and that's why Paul can say grievious wolves are gonna come that's what he knew this is gonna and they and then he says right there and second Thessalonians 2 and 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work yeah he already you would spiritual discernment could see that other spirit the other twin working there in the framework of the church of course it comes to head in the end time right you know were these things that happen in seed form becomes manifested in the harvest time and in them in a multiplied way and so you know yes but the iniquity mystery of iniquity already was working in the early church it said Paul said that in the last days they would be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god trucebreakers false accusers despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness there you go but denying the power which would be the life of the vine that we spoke of in the last session denying the power their from such turn away the the deception that Satan brought was a lot like 'if he started out in religious conversation hath God said yeah and so he just twisted the word slightly right to bring 6,000 years of human misery upon the human race so let me let me pose this question here for first the second Thessalonians 2 and 4 because it's in your Bible it's in your Bible it's in your Bible and it's in every denominational Bible that believes it please in Christ but he's sitting in a temple of God so what does that mean it they're reading the same scripture that we're reading are their eyes blinded to what this scripture is truly saying because our eyes have been enlightened we can see who it is it clearly tells us so why I mean he's sitting in the temple of God showing himself that He is God he's sitting in a church he's convincing them he's God's in them that he is God that this is the true Jesus and it's not the Jesus of the Bible it's the Jesus of people's own making and if you were if you look at you know for example one church they will have a Jesus and the Jesus that they met you know I like to think of it this way in the beginning God made man now man wants to make go right exactly and so he wants a God that He desires he's gonna make him the way he wants him and so you know certain theologians made a God that this God has to mind his mother so you pray to the Virgin Mary and who to prays to his her son and her son prays to his father and you know you the the the the son has to do what his mama tells him to do that is a God that has been crafted by theologians yet it is being preached in the temple of God portrayed as Jesus but it's not Jesus at all then there's another God for example um this God doesn't care how you're baptized or if you're baptized if you're immersed are if you're sprinkled you know it doesn't really matter to this God so you know every denomination makes their own God and it's not a God of the Bible but it's one of their own makin and they cracked him by their certain favorite scriptures rather than taking the whole Word of God and presenting the gospel of Jesus Christ now that's what I think so that's how we got 41,000 that's how we got holding 1,000 and there again it's not someone standing there with horns and a pitchfork there's a Satan disguised as an angel of light it's deception you know in Jesus as a scripture I just wanna interject here just it says Jesus talked about the light of the body and talking about darkness he said but take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness so I mean it's showing right there that he's light showing himself to be like Satan is showing himself reliably yet he's darkness all the time uh-huh if we're not careful would be deceived thinking it's light is God looks like God you know got a it's a church I mean it's not that it's ministers or right or his angels or ministers of life right yes yes but it's darkness there's no ass yeah well that first church jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that first church lived by the word that's right and this is what Satan is trying to get out of the grips of the church by by devaluing the word by substituting man's ideas for God and Jesus said it you by your traditions make the Word of God of a matter of fact right because the word the gospel will have an effect upon people right yeah upon souls and so Satan knows just a little leaven will contaminate the whole Satan knows that he can just slightly twist into men's programs and then we're powerless we're sitting powerless so that tells me that Satan is a great preacher yes I mean he's a great teacher with a warning is always if he comes preaching something different a lot of times it puts the warning on preachers it says that in 2nd Corinthians 11 for for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus so this is someone with the ministry yeah it is increasing or not another Jesus now this is what Paul saying we've over and over again said that the book of Acts church is our pattern and Paul just comes right out and said it he preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached anything different at all or if you receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which you just spoke of one that's crafted by man which ye have not accepted you might well bear with him so a lot of times that we were not to be looking outside the church walls for the deception no it's inside the church a lot of people think you know this the Beast is gonna be some great machine or whatever the the Antichrist is a spirit and it is and it works within the framework of the church bringing the deception if we go back to what you said a lot of go brother Craig you know Paul said it himself about about and referred back to Eve he said I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I might present you as a chaste virgin to Christ so here here was his desire to to have one that was a chaste virgin but he said I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the complicity that's in Christ so as you said he come saying yea hath God said he didn't come he didn't come sayin you know you know I'm the devil or I'm the Serpent and I'm out here to deceive you he come with yea hath God said and he comes bringing a part of the word but not all of the word and with this he brings a deception and Christ his own God and so he made it God to Eve like all surely God wouldn't do that so automatically he began to start crafting God into something that and may God into something different than what His Word said and answer what the Bible tells us to earnestly earnestly fervently contend for the faith that was once delivered yes so that original truth things you can from it so you can rightly divide the spirit and discern the spirit and know which is truth and which is not and just broke that thirty is about thirty years after the founding of the church so we're just thirty years later and he's having to say you got to contend for the faith which was once delivered in other words what people are believing what people are preaching is not what was delivered disaster but consultants chainsaws already something that's happening and exactly yeah just a short years and you're saying this is the falling away is the beginning this was the beginning of the falling away of the first church yeah exactly well once step away from the words is step away from Christ actly right and so you know there's one step and so is is it's just like shooting a target you know you're you you've got to be lined up and to be able to hit that target and and what people have done today is they want to move the target rather than you know line line up with the word of God yes it's hard to this door but they want to move the target in order to compensate for their beliefs we know the serpent changed one word with that's all what is one word yeah so in your analogy he wasn't off by a lot now you know dude writing this they may have not been Alton false doctrine but one step away he's saying you know he's looking at going we can't do that looking at the scripture what Paul is written saying that there's anything different yeah don't don't hear that and he's looking at it and that's 30 years after the founding of the church where are we at two thousand years later if it was all this much there the further it goes the further it goes the further away from the truth it's gotten that that's really good and and it's actually astounding to think of it in that way that a step away from the word is a step away from God because we cannot worship God apart from the work Jesus said we must worship in spirit and in truth right so to be anti word is to be Antichrist exactly exactly like the only way to worship God in spirit and in truth is to worship Him by the word like the first church like Jesus taught us so without the word you find yourself in the congregation that we were speaking of earlier with Satan showing himself as God that's where you're worshiping I think without the power the Holy Spirit in our lives that can help us see the word and discern the word that's where we find ourselves right that's why the baptism of the Holy Ghost is so essential it's the air belt oh yeah I mean it's the life of Christ Russ the life of the vine in the branch right and I think that's that's what's missing in a lot of churches otherwise we would all be a part of the same body man right yeah I mean you know the the power is gone the freedom of the Holy Spirit is gone the the you know even even that which would bring our morals and convictions and whatever is being lost in the society that we're living in yet we call ourself a Christian nation yeah yeah have a form of godliness oh yeah a point before we have a conversation or a conversion which saying Lord Lord profession yeah but you lack the power which leads to so many statements of oh whoa we're all sinners or we all send a little bit denying the pie the Holy Spirit to live in overcoming life's a victorious life and and yes we all were sinners but there was there has to be that change to where that we're no longer you know out practicing sin exactly but but yet holiness and godliness and purity is being lived through our lovely men and and so this is this is really a cop out today you know oh well we're just all sinners you know well yeah I lie yeah I mean I I cuss yeah I mean well I drink a little yeah we fornicate or you shack up or whatever the condition of the world is but we're all sinners well you know I want to tell the the people that there is a gospel yes that will change your life right and will change you from a life of sin to make you an overcomer and have a victorious life in this slide over the millennium right now that you can live a victorious life as he said even to the last age to him that overcometh as he says to every age to him that over somebody's gonna overcome today somebody's gonna be victorious and somebody is gonna stand for truth amen immediately and god bless you as we lie down this session will look a little deeper into this and see how the early church lost his first love thank you for joining the ministry team at evening light tabernacle for more information on what you have heard today please
