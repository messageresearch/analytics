[52:17] let's turn to luke chapter 17.
[52:20] we're going to read from the 28th verse
[52:22] this morning and
[52:24] then we'll read over in the book of john
[52:26] chapter 1 verse 1 but right now luke 17
[52:30] 28. likewise also as it was in the days
[52:35] of lot
[52:36] they did eat they drank they bought they
[52:38] sold they planted they built it
[52:40] but the same day that lot went out of
[52:42] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[52:44] heaven and destroyed them all
[52:47] even thus shall it be in the day
[52:50] when the son of man
[52:52] is revealed
[52:54] notice this is revealing of the son of
[52:57] man the son of man is the word amen
[53:01] so it'll be it'll be as it was in the
[53:04] days of the revealing of the son of man
[53:07] when we'll also have sodom conditions
[53:10] again
[53:10] upon the earth and also
[53:12] a destruction upon the earth
[53:15] and we know that we're already now
[53:18] well into the sixth vision
[53:21] and knowing that the seventh lays right
[53:23] ahead
[53:24] total annihilation of the world that we
[53:27] know of for them to burn off for the
[53:29] millennial reign
[53:31] these are not guesswork these are not
[53:33] fiction
[53:34] this is prophecy of the last days and we
[53:37] are here amen everything lays in place
[53:42] never has man been able to do this
[53:45] destroy the world in just
[53:48] minutes
[53:49] burn it over with fire in just minutes
[53:52] we're here in a very special time
[53:56] amen john chapter 1 verse 1
[53:59] in the beginning was the word and the
[54:02] word was with god and the word was god
[54:05] so in the beginning was the logos and
[54:08] the logos was with god and the logos was
[54:11] god
[54:12] the same was in the beginning with god
[54:15] all things were made by him
[54:17] and without him was not anything made
[54:20] that was made in him was life
[54:23] and the life was the light of men
[54:26] and
[54:27] the light shineth in darkness and the
[54:30] darkness comprehendeth it not
[54:33] there was a man sent from god whose name
[54:35] was john
[54:37] the same came for witness to bear
[54:39] witness
[54:40] of the light that all men through him
[54:43] might believe he was not that light but
[54:46] he was sent to bear witness
[54:48] of that light
[54:50] that was the true light which lighteth
[54:53] every man that cometh into the world
[54:55] he was in the world and the world was
[54:57] made by him
[54:59] and the world knew him not
[55:01] he came to his own and his own received
[55:05] him not
[55:06] but as many as received him
[55:09] to them gave he power to become the sons
[55:12] of god
[55:13] even to them that believe on his name
[55:16] which were born not of blood nor the
[55:18] will of the flesh
[55:20] nor the will of man but of god and the
[55:23] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[55:26] and we beheld his glory the glory as the
[55:30] only begotten of the father full of
[55:32] grace
[55:33] and truth
[55:35] amen god bless you can be seated
[55:38] we're going to read one more verse from
[55:39] the scripture
[55:41] this will come from genesis chapter 18
[55:44] and verse 22
[55:46] and the men
[55:48] turned their faces from themts and went
[55:51] towards sodom
[55:53] but abraham stood yet before the lord
[55:57] and abraham's day the phenomena was
[55:59] being done
[56:01] the pillar of fire the light the logos
[56:04] came down in abraham's day and as we
[56:08] have said he touched the soil
[56:10] and gathered the necessary elements to
[56:12] make a body for himself
[56:15] and for two angels and he stepped into
[56:17] them
[56:18] in genesis 18 and verse 17 the lord said
[56:21] shall i hide from abraham
[56:24] that thing which i
[56:26] do
[56:27] noted now he is
[56:29] going here to reveal
[56:32] to abraham the secret
[56:34] um in this in this coming he will reveal
[56:37] the secret of
[56:39] of sarah and her change of her body
[56:43] um and they're concerning the
[56:45] long-awaited son for sarah that was
[56:47] isaac for us it's the second coming of
[56:49] jesus
[56:51] and the change of the body the secret of
[56:53] redemption
[56:55] so what was he doing he was breaking the
[56:57] silence
[56:59] to sarah of her part in the promise
[57:03] he was removing the seals off of his
[57:06] plan of redemption
[57:08] showing her that she was not forgotten
[57:12] i'm glad to declare to you today we have
[57:15] not been forgotten
[57:17] amen that god is present in this
[57:20] generation in a very special and
[57:23] peculiar way
[57:25] man to reveal himself to a group of
[57:27] people in the end time
[57:30] man
[57:30] from whom he will call out a people for
[57:33] his namesake it's actually the finishing
[57:37] of his calling out because he's had a
[57:39] calling out in every generation down
[57:41] through every church age
[57:43] but i i want to just say you know as we
[57:46] look at this scene
[57:48] in particular it is interesting while
[57:51] two went down to sodom
[57:53] and they would bring a message to sodom
[57:56] investigate sodom looking for
[57:59] righteousness and could only find just
[58:02] um you know
[58:04] a few that would actually
[58:07] um receive
[58:09] that were righteous and would receive
[58:10] the angel's message and and i want you
[58:13] to remember
[58:14] lot was in such a backslidden condition
[58:18] that um
[58:19] his
[58:20] his message that he
[58:23] heard of the angels when he went to his
[58:25] sons and laws he was mocked by them
[58:29] and it really behooves us when we live
[58:32] that we live a life before others
[58:35] i mean that when we talk about what god
[58:38] is doing in our generation they take us
[58:40] seriously
[58:42] because god is doing some
[58:44] very
[58:45] phenomenal and as we have said some
[58:47] extreme things in this generation
[58:51] now of course as we said and was pointed
[58:55] out that elohim did not go down to sodom
[58:58] but he stayed there with abraham's group
[59:02] and i want to just declare to you today
[59:05] that that presence of that angel is
[59:08] still manifest himself today through the
[59:12] bride's body
[59:13] anointing men to preach the gospel
[59:17] amen they are the angel's voice
[59:20] listen to me carefully they are the
[59:22] angel's voice to speak the mysteries
[59:25] that have been revealed by the angel and
[59:27] to bring faith to sarah
[59:30] the bride of christ that by supernatural
[59:33] means by the pouring out of the holy
[59:36] ghost that a people now is being
[59:38] prepared for the coming of the lord
[59:42] now as we're talking about this angel i
[59:44] i want to speak about him for a little
[59:46] bit because scripturally who is this
[59:49] angel
[59:50] you know in as um we often declare in
[59:54] our generation that there has been you
[59:58] know even photographed the pillar of
[1:00:00] fire
[1:00:02] and um and so in that great photograph
[1:00:05] of the pillar of fire which would be
[1:00:08] examined by a question of men who who
[1:00:12] examine question documents and they
[1:00:14] would have to declare
[1:00:16] that the light struck the lens that that
[1:00:19] was this would be the only supernatural
[1:00:21] being that was ever photographed
[1:00:24] and and the thing about it is you and i
[1:00:27] could you know dismiss this easily if
[1:00:30] that was all of the vindication but
[1:00:34] service act of service after service the
[1:00:37] angel lord would appear in the services
[1:00:40] and he would appear not always in a
[1:00:43] visual means but we knew he was there
[1:00:45] because he would tell things that no man
[1:00:48] could know
[1:00:49] that only god could know
[1:00:52] amen so it would be again that
[1:00:56] we we would declare to this generation
[1:00:59] the the very um that the angel of god
[1:01:03] was here and he was again leading the
[1:01:06] people
[1:01:07] like he did in the days of the exodus
[1:01:11] that again that we are in a time in a
[1:01:14] day where the pillar of fire is once
[1:01:17] more leading the church
[1:01:20] are you with me so we want to talk about
[1:01:22] scripturally who is this angel now in
[1:01:25] the first exodus he is a light he's a
[1:01:28] fire in a bush that doesn't burn
[1:01:32] now i want you to remember that god is
[1:01:35] light this is one thing that he is first
[1:01:37] john 1 5 this is the message
[1:01:41] that we have heard from of him and
[1:01:43] declare to you that god is light
[1:01:47] and in him there is no darkness at all
[1:01:49] so we come back again to the original
[1:01:53] message once more
[1:01:55] that god is light
[1:01:58] amen that when he shines a light up on a
[1:02:01] subject when he light shines light upon
[1:02:03] a human being he can tell who they were
[1:02:06] where they came from what their disease
[1:02:09] was whether what what kind of doctor it
[1:02:12] was or to describe
[1:02:14] everything right down to the very minute
[1:02:17] details
[1:02:18] are you with me amen but he also is one
[1:02:22] who knows the word of god and he is his
[1:02:26] own interpreter
[1:02:29] now so god is light and in him there is
[1:02:32] no darkness at all
[1:02:34] so we'll we have come back to the
[1:02:36] message that we have heard from the
[1:02:38] beginning
[1:02:40] amen the same light that paul would meet
[1:02:43] on the on the road to damascus
[1:02:45] the same light that would lead to
[1:02:48] children of israel that same life is
[1:02:51] here with us today
[1:02:54] amen leading the church in this end time
[1:02:58] amen so god is light and in him is no
[1:03:02] darkness
[1:03:03] now again in exodus 40 and verse 38 it
[1:03:06] would also be shown as the cloud of the
[1:03:09] lord was upon the tabernacle by day and
[1:03:13] and the fire was on it by night in the
[1:03:16] sight of all the house of israel
[1:03:18] throughout all of their journey so we
[1:03:20] see again the cloud of the lord is is a
[1:03:24] is one description and the other
[1:03:26] description it is also described as a
[1:03:28] fire a cloud
[1:03:30] and a fire a cloud and a fire
[1:03:33] now these are were in the sight of the
[1:03:37] house of israel
[1:03:39] so god brought it into view to let them
[1:03:41] know
[1:03:42] um i'm the one that is leading you to
[1:03:45] this promised land and i'm the one that
[1:03:48] has given this to you listen god wants
[1:03:50] you to be assured to know that he's the
[1:03:53] one in charge
[1:03:54] he is the one that's leading this bride
[1:03:57] this is his message
[1:03:59] because he is light
[1:04:02] and it is only right that he would come
[1:04:04] again and show himself as a light
[1:04:07] as he would show himself in the burning
[1:04:09] bush
[1:04:13] in exodus chapter 3 and verse 1
[1:04:16] now moses kept the flock of jethro his
[1:04:18] father-in-law the priest of media
[1:04:21] and he led the flock to the backside of
[1:04:24] the desert and came to the mountain of
[1:04:26] god even to horeb and the angel of the
[1:04:29] lord appeared to him in a flame of fire
[1:04:32] out of the midst of the bush and looked
[1:04:34] and behold the bush burned with fire
[1:04:37] and the bush was not consumed and moses
[1:04:40] said i will now turn aside and see this
[1:04:43] great sight why the bush is not burnt
[1:04:45] and when the lord saw that he turned
[1:04:47] aside to see god called him out of the
[1:04:50] midst of the bush notice who it is it
[1:04:52] was an angel
[1:04:54] but it was god
[1:04:57] the lord god called him out of the midst
[1:05:01] of the bush
[1:05:02] so it was god coming down as the angel
[1:05:05] of the covenant the angel or the
[1:05:08] messenger of his own word
[1:05:11] i want you to get it this is a god who
[1:05:14] is very very concerned about his word he
[1:05:17] said none of it will return to me boy
[1:05:20] it's going to accomplish what i said it
[1:05:22] to do
[1:05:23] and you can rest assure in this evening
[1:05:25] time if god gave a word if the holy
[1:05:28] spirit is right there with it to perform
[1:05:31] that word and to bring that word to pass
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:37] and when and so he said and and he
[1:05:40] called out of the bush moses moses and
[1:05:42] he said here am i
[1:05:44] and
[1:05:45] moses and and
[1:05:47] and he said draw nothing not hitler put
[1:05:50] off thy shoes throughout thy feet for
[1:05:52] the place whereon thou standeth
[1:05:55] stand in his holy ground moreover he
[1:05:58] said i am the god of thy father notice
[1:06:02] this is what he wants to remind you
[1:06:05] when when he comes to reveal himself
[1:06:07] he's going to place himself as the god
[1:06:11] of thy fathers
[1:06:13] he wants you to know he is the god of
[1:06:15] pentecost
[1:06:18] he is the god of the book of acts
[1:06:21] he is the god of the gospels
[1:06:23] he is the god of the old testament
[1:06:26] amen he is that god
[1:06:29] that is that present god to come and he
[1:06:32] said i'm the god of thy father the god
[1:06:34] of abraham the god of isaac and the god
[1:06:37] of jacob and moses hid his face for he
[1:06:40] was afraid to look upon god
[1:06:46] and then
[1:06:48] he tells him his purpose
[1:06:50] i have come to investigate
[1:06:53] i'm going to bring judgment on the
[1:06:55] nation
[1:06:58] the last plague is going to be death
[1:07:01] now remember this whole thing is a
[1:07:03] prophecy
[1:07:05] because the last plague that strikes is
[1:07:08] death
[1:07:09] notice he says i've seen this i've
[1:07:12] surely seen the affliction of my people
[1:07:15] which are in egypt
[1:07:17] and i want you to understand
[1:07:19] whatever you're going through
[1:07:21] god's already seen it
[1:07:25] he said i've seen the affliction
[1:07:27] i've seen what the enemy has done to you
[1:07:30] i see what has happened what's now and
[1:07:33] and i've heard their cry every prayer
[1:07:37] every crowd of god
[1:07:39] i've heard it amen and uh by the reason
[1:07:43] of their tasks my skirts for i know
[1:07:44] they're sorrows
[1:07:46] amen but i don't just know their sorrows
[1:07:49] but in this generation i'm going to do
[1:07:51] something about it
[1:07:53] it is now time is now the hour
[1:07:56] for a deliverance it's the time of the
[1:07:59] exodus
[1:08:01] am i when god comes down like this
[1:08:04] amen it is coming down for deliverance
[1:08:08] and he says i've seen your afflictions
[1:08:11] i know how long the church is languished
[1:08:15] i know how old sarah is
[1:08:18] i know how long the promise has been
[1:08:22] but i am here to bring that promise to
[1:08:24] pass
[1:08:26] i'm going to see it to the finish
[1:08:29] i'll perform what i sent it to do
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:34] and i am come down to deliver them
[1:08:37] out of the hand of the egyptians
[1:08:39] and oh i love this i
[1:08:41] am come down
[1:08:44] first thessalonians 4 says the lord
[1:08:46] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:08:49] shout
[1:08:51] amen that's a message
[1:08:53] and this would be the first phase
[1:08:56] come on the first phase
[1:08:58] the very first phase of the exodus there
[1:09:01] was god coming down with a message go
[1:09:04] tell pharaoh let my people go
[1:09:08] and go tell my people i've got a land
[1:09:10] prepared for them i'm not leaving them
[1:09:13] in this egypt but i'm bringing them out
[1:09:15] of their bondage
[1:09:19] i have come down
[1:09:22] and i'm going to send a prophet
[1:09:24] with a message

[1:09:39] minute

[1:10:17] fathers to the children and the hearts
[1:10:19] of the children to their fathers lest i
[1:10:21] come and smite the earth with a curse
[1:10:24] so lest i wipe it all off i'm going to
[1:10:27] send elijah
[1:10:29] but i'm sending elijah but i want you to
[1:10:31] thank moses
[1:10:34] are you with me
[1:10:35] notice it speaks that moses and elijah
[1:10:38] here think of moses
[1:10:40] but i'm saying elijah
[1:10:44] because it's another exodus
[1:10:46] it's another given of the word before
[1:10:49] going into the promised land
[1:10:51] being raptured
[1:10:53] are you with me so i want you to think
[1:10:56] i'm going to do something in the last
[1:10:58] day before the coming of the great and
[1:10:59] dreadful day of the lord and i want you
[1:11:01] to think moses but it's going to be
[1:11:03] elijah i sin
[1:11:05] but you see it's a parallel because what
[1:11:08] i did in moses day is what i'm going to
[1:11:11] do in this day what did the angel tell
[1:11:13] brother branham i'm going to give you
[1:11:14] two signs as i gave moses
[1:11:18] amen what was it it was signs of of
[1:11:21] power over the enemy
[1:11:25] is that right the rod with moses was a
[1:11:27] sign of power over the serpent
[1:11:31] come on
[1:11:33] and the and again the sign that god
[1:11:35] would give in this day would be power
[1:11:38] over the devil
[1:11:40] he would show his healing his
[1:11:41] deliverance he would dust his hand in
[1:11:44] there and
[1:11:45] and his bosom and he'd come out leprous
[1:11:48] which is a type of sin and he would
[1:11:50] stress it back in and it would come back
[1:11:52] out clean
[1:11:54] amen what was it god was demonstrating
[1:11:57] his power
[1:12:00] given a sign to them that moses was sin
[1:12:03] of god
[1:12:05] now of course there would be jettison
[1:12:07] jamborees that would come along and and
[1:12:09] seemingly um uh dispute that moses was
[1:12:13] sent from god that perhaps he was just
[1:12:15] like any other soothsayer
[1:12:19] you know meeting an angel was about like
[1:12:21] um joseph smith and the mormons
[1:12:26] are you with me
[1:12:27] impersonate us
[1:12:30] and man they go there to impersonate but
[1:12:33] i i want you just to see this real
[1:12:36] clearly but it's a time of deliverance
[1:12:38] where god has come down for the purpose
[1:12:41] of deliverance and bring them into a
[1:12:43] land
[1:12:45] that is flowing with milk and honey unto
[1:12:48] the place of the canaanites and the
[1:12:50] hittites and the amorites and the
[1:12:52] parasites and the and the hybrites and
[1:12:54] the jebusites so he says i'm going to
[1:12:57] dispossess them
[1:12:59] but i'm going to bring you into that
[1:13:01] land
[1:13:03] amen therefore i behold the cry the
[1:13:07] children of israel is coming to me and
[1:13:09] i've seen the oppression this is verse
[1:13:11] nine uh i've seen the oppression aware
[1:13:14] with the the egyptians oppressed them
[1:13:16] come now therefore and i will send thee
[1:13:19] unto pharaoh that i might bring forth my
[1:13:22] people the children of israel out of
[1:13:24] egypt
[1:13:25] so god does something very special
[1:13:28] he sends an angel and a pillar of fire
[1:13:32] and he brings a message
[1:13:33] and then he sends a prophet with a
[1:13:36] message
[1:13:37] to bring them under the token
[1:13:40] so that once under the blood come on
[1:13:42] they can leave egypt
[1:13:45] and go into the promised land
[1:13:47] notice again exodus 23 20 he said behold
[1:13:51] i send an angel before thee to keep thee
[1:13:54] in the way and to bring thee into the
[1:13:57] place
[1:13:58] which i have prepared now there is an
[1:14:00] angel that goes with us
[1:14:04] to keep us in the way
[1:14:06] to keep us from straying
[1:14:09] to keep us from getting confused
[1:14:12] pulled aside make just another
[1:14:15] denominational wandering down in egypt
[1:14:18] but i've got an angel that's going to go
[1:14:21] with you i'm not going to leave you
[1:14:23] but i'm taking you in there
[1:14:25] amen i'm just going to tell you even
[1:14:27] when moses cannot go any further i'm
[1:14:30] still going to take you in that lamb
[1:14:34] now
[1:14:36] so
[1:14:37] this is exodus 33 verse 12
[1:14:40] and moses is asking the question who is
[1:14:43] going to lead us
[1:14:45] who is it's going to lead us from from
[1:14:47] here
[1:14:48] and he said moses said unto to the lord
[1:14:52] see thou sayest unto me bring up this
[1:14:54] people
[1:14:55] and thou has not let me know whom thou
[1:14:58] will sin with me
[1:15:00] yet thou has said i know thee by name
[1:15:03] and thou has also found
[1:15:05] grace
[1:15:07] in my sight
[1:15:09] isn't it wonderful to know
[1:15:11] he knows us by name
[1:15:14] and he and we have found grace in his
[1:15:17] sight
[1:15:19] but if moses said i want to know
[1:15:21] who is it that's going with us
[1:15:24] amen verse 13. now therefore i pray that
[1:15:27] if i find grace in thy sight show me now
[1:15:29] that way
[1:15:31] that i may know thee that i might find
[1:15:33] grace in thy sight in other words if
[1:15:35] you're pleased with me teach me your
[1:15:37] ways i may know you
[1:15:39] so if you can see this this is a time
[1:15:42] where the the lord the angel of god will
[1:15:45] be teaching his way
[1:15:48] now remember jesus is that way
[1:15:51] so again it's going to bring a church
[1:15:53] back to the original gospel of jesus
[1:15:57] christ that has been contaminated by
[1:16:01] denominationalism down through the ages
[1:16:03] watered down confused and convoluted but
[1:16:07] this god said i'm going to teach you
[1:16:10] your my way because you have found grace
[1:16:13] in my sight and i consider that this
[1:16:16] nation is thy people
[1:16:20] hallelujah i want you to understand
[1:16:22] you're not only people of the book
[1:16:24] you're people of the angel of the book
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:31] and he says my presence
[1:16:33] shall go with thee
[1:16:35] and i will give thee rest
[1:16:37] and he said if thy presence go not with
[1:16:40] me
[1:16:41] carry us not up from hence
[1:16:45] and then moses so he said your president
[1:16:47] don't go with us don't send us up from
[1:16:48] here
[1:16:50] amen if you're not going to see this
[1:16:52] through
[1:16:53] and man if you're just going to abandon
[1:16:55] the project
[1:16:56] if you're just going to show us a couple
[1:16:58] of signs and get our hopes built up that
[1:17:01] we're in the end time and his rapture
[1:17:03] age and yet we see all this sodom around
[1:17:06] us and we see even in this case the
[1:17:08] egyptians have been on their trail and
[1:17:11] going to try to captivate them again you
[1:17:14] know if you're not going with us
[1:17:17] am i don't play with our heart
[1:17:21] amen but assure us assure us that you're
[1:17:24] going with us
[1:17:26] uh serious you're gonna complete this
[1:17:28] task
[1:17:29] assurance you're taking us in a rapture
[1:17:32] that you're not leaving us here
[1:17:35] that you're not abandoning your project
[1:17:38] i want you to understand this is not a
[1:17:41] prophet's project this is not a man's
[1:17:44] project this was god's project
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:52] he says
[1:17:53] for wherein shall it be known
[1:17:56] that i and thy people have found grace
[1:17:58] in our sight
[1:18:00] is not this favor shown
[1:18:03] by you being with us
[1:18:09] we can talk about grace all we want to
[1:18:13] we you know and a lot of songs are being
[1:18:15] song about grace and
[1:18:18] you know grace that amazing grace that
[1:18:20] is so amazing and and songs written
[1:18:23] over and over and over about this
[1:18:25] amazing grace and of course people feel
[1:18:27] like this grace is just a something of
[1:18:30] favor that blankets out all our wrongs
[1:18:33] and all our you know all our iniquities
[1:18:36] in other words all the things we just
[1:18:38] continue living on our sins but the
[1:18:40] grace of god makes up for us
[1:18:43] but i want you to see this real clearly
[1:18:46] it's not that at all
[1:18:48] but the gracious
[1:18:50] is that you are with us
[1:18:53] the grace shown is you give us power
[1:18:56] over sin
[1:18:58] the grace is you heal our sick among us
[1:19:01] the grace is you're in the church you're
[1:19:04] working in the body
[1:19:07] that's the grace
[1:19:12] is it not
[1:19:13] that though who is with us so we should
[1:19:15] be separated in other words a church
[1:19:18] that's what a church is means called out
[1:19:20] that we be a church separated and i am
[1:19:23] not people from all the people that are
[1:19:26] upon the face of the earth
[1:19:27] because what else
[1:19:29] tell me what else distinguishes us
[1:19:33] from all the other people on the face of
[1:19:35] the earth
[1:19:37] except
[1:19:39] his presence
[1:19:42] listen if we lose his presence
[1:19:45] we've lost everything
[1:19:52] when a church
[1:19:55] abandons god god turns him over to
[1:19:58] abandonment
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:00] and this is what he has done look
[1:20:02] what has happened to the sodomite
[1:20:04] churches today god has turned them over
[1:20:06] to their own lust
[1:20:08] woe to demand that god turns over
[1:20:12] amen
[1:20:13] but what else will distinguish us
[1:20:16] from all the other people on the face
[1:20:17] the earth and the lord said to moses i
[1:20:20] will do this thing because thou has
[1:20:21] spoken for thou hast found grace in my
[1:20:24] sight
[1:20:25] because i'm pleased with you in other
[1:20:27] words and i know that my name and he
[1:20:29] said i beseech thee
[1:20:31] show me thy glory and he said i will
[1:20:33] make all thy my goodness pass before
[1:20:36] thee and i will proclaim the name of the
[1:20:38] lord before thee and will be gracious to
[1:20:40] whom i will be gracious and will show
[1:20:42] mercy on whom i will shall mercy and he
[1:20:45] said thou cannot see my face for no man
[1:20:48] shall see me and live
[1:20:50] and the lord said behold there is a
[1:20:52] place by me
[1:20:54] and thou shalt stand upon a rock
[1:20:58] now notice what he's doing a place near
[1:21:01] me that i'm going to bring you into
[1:21:04] and in this place you're going to see
[1:21:07] things that others have never been privy
[1:21:09] to see
[1:21:11] it shall come to pass what my glory
[1:21:13] passes by i will put you in a cleft of
[1:21:16] the rock and will cover thee with my
[1:21:18] hand
[1:21:19] while i pass and i will take away my
[1:21:21] hand and i shall see my back parts but
[1:21:24] my face shall not be seen therefore well
[1:21:27] i will remove my hands and you'll see my
[1:21:29] back but my face must not be seen watch
[1:21:31] these words now
[1:21:33] but look how different it is in our age
[1:21:36] since the blood of jesus christ
[1:21:40] amen when i'm just covered with his hand
[1:21:42] we've been covered by his blood
[1:21:45] and he shows us the sevenfold glory of
[1:21:48] his person
[1:21:49] he shows us his
[1:21:51] complete countenance come on the bible
[1:21:53] says in revelation 10 his countenance or
[1:21:56] his face is as it was the sun
[1:21:59] shining in his glory
[1:22:02] that god would actually reveal a people
[1:22:06] his countenance
[1:22:10] now moses would see god in theopenic
[1:22:13] form
[1:22:14] but when we continue into the next
[1:22:16] chapter 34
[1:22:18] he comes and is revealed in word form
[1:22:23] notice he would first be revealed in
[1:22:26] theophanic
[1:22:27] angelic form
[1:22:29] and now he will be revealed in
[1:22:31] word form
[1:22:33] now i want you to catch this
[1:22:35] because god is doing more than just
[1:22:38] reveal himself in an angel to a prophet
[1:22:41] but he's now revealing himself through
[1:22:44] the word
[1:22:45] to a prophet
[1:22:46] and thus to a people
[1:22:48] so look in in verse 1 and the lord said
[1:22:51] unto moses hear thee two tables of stone
[1:22:54] like in the verse and i will write upon
[1:22:56] these tables of words that were in the
[1:22:57] first tables which thou break us
[1:23:00] and be ready in the morning and come up
[1:23:02] in the morning unto mount sinai and
[1:23:05] present thyself to me in the top of the
[1:23:07] mount
[1:23:08] and no man shall come up with thee
[1:23:10] neither shall any man be seen throughout
[1:23:12] all the mount neither let the flocks and
[1:23:14] the herds feed before the mount
[1:23:18] and he hewed two tables of stone
[1:23:21] like the first and moses rose up early
[1:23:23] in the morning went into the mount sinai
[1:23:26] as the lord commanded him and he took
[1:23:28] his in his hand the two tables of stone
[1:23:31] and the lord descended in the cloud and
[1:23:34] stood with him there and proclaimed the
[1:23:37] name of the lord
[1:23:39] and and the lord passed by and
[1:23:41] proclaimed
[1:23:42] the lord the lord god
[1:23:45] merciful and gracious long-suffered and
[1:23:49] abundant in truth and he passed in front
[1:23:52] of moses there as he's proclaiming now
[1:23:55] and keeping mercy from for thousands and
[1:23:58] forgiven iniquity and the transgression
[1:24:01] and sin that shall by no means clear the
[1:24:04] guilty vision the iniquity of the
[1:24:06] fathers upon the children and upon the
[1:24:09] children's children under third and
[1:24:10] fourth generation and from there god in
[1:24:14] this appearing would begin to take and
[1:24:17] write his word
[1:24:20] in tables of stone
[1:24:24] now notice
[1:24:26] the same thing happens in the end time
[1:24:29] because god takes his finger
[1:24:32] and writes it in your nature
[1:24:36] because he's going to have a people who
[1:24:38] learn the book
[1:24:41] amen that it's written in their lives
[1:24:43] it's written in their hearts
[1:24:46] notice now who is this angel of the lord
[1:24:48] you see this angel of the lord stands
[1:24:50] out in distinct preeminence in the whole
[1:24:54] old testament there was definitely a
[1:24:56] theophanic mediator
[1:24:58] unique and distinct
[1:25:00] he introduced himself as deity
[1:25:04] he called from heaven on two occasions
[1:25:07] once he stopped abraham from sacrificing
[1:25:10] isaac and again he promised him
[1:25:12] countless descendants like we sung about
[1:25:16] he he was the spokesman
[1:25:18] of the three men who came
[1:25:20] to uh to abraham
[1:25:23] to announce the impending doom of sodom
[1:25:26] and to foretell
[1:25:27] the coming of the promised son
[1:25:30] it was the angel lord that abraham would
[1:25:33] detain in his supplication
[1:25:35] for sodom and and for his nephew lot you
[1:25:39] know he was signing and crying and
[1:25:42] asking god for salvation remember that
[1:25:45] that was the abraham group
[1:25:47] and god was looking for two things he
[1:25:50] was looking for faith
[1:25:52] and finding none he gave it
[1:25:54] amen he asked will i find faith on the
[1:25:57] earth and find him to that there
[1:25:59] wouldn't be any faith on the earth come
[1:26:01] on somebody he sends a prophet and
[1:26:03] elijah to turn the heart back to faith
[1:26:07] is that right but he also is a sealant
[1:26:09] angel and he's looking for those who is
[1:26:12] signing crying for the abomination done
[1:26:14] in the city and here again abraham is
[1:26:17] signed and crying not for god to destroy
[1:26:20] sodom but for god to save the lost
[1:26:24] you see that is the real heart of any
[1:26:26] believer
[1:26:28] god somehow saved them
[1:26:30] in this case he was he he was he was
[1:26:33] asking for a hundred asking for fifty he
[1:26:36] was asking for ten he was getting down
[1:26:38] to whatever he wanted at least my my my
[1:26:42] nephew saint
[1:26:45] joey straight away still save my my
[1:26:48] kindred lord amen there ought to be
[1:26:51] something that is crying out in the
[1:26:52] hearts of believers this morning lord we
[1:26:55] see sodom we see the fire about to fall
[1:26:58] we see the judgment coming on the earth
[1:27:00] but lord oh god if you can find 10
[1:27:03] righteous
[1:27:05] amen but whatever
[1:27:07] save my loss
[1:27:08] love one lord whatever you have to do if
[1:27:10] they got to go through tribulation
[1:27:11] whatever they got to do
[1:27:13] save them anyhow
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:18] as i said one of the main purposes of a
[1:27:21] church
[1:27:22] is to cast out devils
[1:27:25] amen
[1:27:27] and that's what saving the lost is is
[1:27:29] casting satan
[1:27:31] amen
[1:27:32] i'm fully expected
[1:27:35] sister misty was talking to me last
[1:27:36] night about wanting to be delivered from
[1:27:39] cigarettes i'm fully expecting a full
[1:27:42] deliverance today
[1:27:49] because that's one job of the church
[1:27:52] cashing out
[1:27:56] she'd quit him on her own if she could
[1:27:58] but let me tell you that wouldn't save
[1:28:00] her
[1:28:02] it's going to take god to save her
[1:28:05] and he's here to say
[1:28:08] did you hear what i said
[1:28:09] i have come down to deliver
[1:28:12] i am present for that purpose
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:17] now the angel lord would accompany
[1:28:19] eliezer on his mission
[1:28:21] to get a wife for isaac
[1:28:25] he would appear to jacob in a foreign
[1:28:27] land and identify himself as the god of
[1:28:30] bethel and instructed him to go back
[1:28:32] home and later on the way home he would
[1:28:35] wrestle with the angel and said i have
[1:28:38] met god face to face
[1:28:43] it was the angel lord who appeared to
[1:28:45] moses in the burning bush
[1:28:47] and identified him as the god of your
[1:28:49] father the god of abraham the god of
[1:28:51] isaac and the god of jacob
[1:28:54] it would be the same angel that would
[1:28:56] later guide and guard the children of
[1:28:59] israel in their exodus from egypt
[1:29:02] it was aged the lord who would talk with
[1:29:04] moses in the wilderness and deliver the
[1:29:07] ten commandments to him on mount sinai
[1:29:10] that we were just reading about
[1:29:13] it would be the angel lord that would
[1:29:15] also block balaam
[1:29:18] who on his road to curse israel and
[1:29:20] refuse to let him bring curses on his
[1:29:23] people
[1:29:25] i want you to know god's got your back
[1:29:30] amen even when the enemy looks on the
[1:29:32] backside and said there's reason to
[1:29:34] curse them
[1:29:35] they got plenty of faults amen god's
[1:29:39] looking through the blood and he ain't
[1:29:41] seeing your faults he's seeing a promise
[1:29:44] these are my people
[1:29:48] and i forbid any false prophet to curse
[1:29:51] them they can't use my name to curse
[1:29:54] they're my people
[1:29:55] [Applause]
[1:29:59] hallelujah
[1:30:01] now it would be the angel lord identify
[1:30:04] himself to joshua as the commander of
[1:30:08] the army of the lord
[1:30:10] and judges
[1:30:12] would show us clearly that the angel
[1:30:14] lord is god in his self-manifestation
[1:30:17] you know in the early time period of the
[1:30:20] judges when the israelites were
[1:30:22] forsaking god the angel lord appeared at
[1:30:25] bocam
[1:30:26] and
[1:30:27] he identified himself as the one who
[1:30:29] brought them out of egypt i'm going to
[1:30:31] read it from the living bible judges two
[1:30:33] and one the angel lord appeared at bocam
[1:30:36] coming from gilgal and announced to the
[1:30:38] people of israel i brought you out of
[1:30:40] egypt
[1:30:42] into this land i promised your ancestors
[1:30:45] and i said i would never break my
[1:30:47] covenant with you
[1:30:49] notice this the angel says i
[1:30:52] brought you out
[1:30:55] it says i brought you to this land
[1:30:59] and i said i would never break my
[1:31:01] covenant
[1:31:03] so if you see that the angel of the lord
[1:31:05] here was god in his self-manifestation
[1:31:10] and he was declared to them that he was
[1:31:13] more than just a messenger though he was
[1:31:16] the messenger because he was a messenger
[1:31:18] of his own covenant
[1:31:23] amen he's a messenger of his own work
[1:31:27] so in that form he's an angel
[1:31:30] but he's god
[1:31:31] as a messenger
[1:31:34] now i want you to understand just
[1:31:36] exactly what the pillar of fire is is
[1:31:38] not just an angel it's god
[1:31:41] as a
[1:31:42] messenger it's the logos itself
[1:31:47] coming down to bring a message
[1:31:50] to people saying i have not forgotten my
[1:31:53] promise
[1:31:55] i've seen the afflictions
[1:31:58] i've seen what's going i've been waiting
[1:32:00] for this day
[1:32:02] and i am come down for a purpose
[1:32:05] and i'll tell you what he's not going to
[1:32:07] leave until he takes a bride from here
[1:32:12] are you with me
[1:32:13] amen so again the angel lord would
[1:32:15] appear to get him and would commission
[1:32:18] him from military leadership
[1:32:20] and when
[1:32:22] gideon offered him food he said place it
[1:32:24] on a rock and the angel touched it with
[1:32:26] his staff and and a fire consumed it and
[1:32:29] the angel vanished let's read about it
[1:32:31] judges 6 11 there came an angel
[1:32:34] of the lord and sat under an oak which
[1:32:37] was in ophra which pertained to joaste
[1:32:40] avezaite and his son gideon thresh wheat
[1:32:44] by the wine press to hide it from the
[1:32:46] midianites and the angel of the lord
[1:32:48] appeared to him and he said unto him the
[1:32:51] lord is with thee the mighty man of
[1:32:55] valor
[1:32:56] now i want you to notice gideon is over
[1:32:58] here he's hiding away from all of the
[1:33:01] oppression
[1:33:02] and he's got his wheat there that he's
[1:33:05] hid in a in a secret place that he's
[1:33:08] hiding it
[1:33:09] come on
[1:33:10] amen but god says i don't see you as a
[1:33:13] coward
[1:33:15] i see you as a mighty man of valor
[1:33:19] i'm not talking about what you want and
[1:33:22] i'm not even talking about
[1:33:24] what you are i'm talking about what i'm
[1:33:27] fixing to make you
[1:33:30] did you hear that church
[1:33:32] amen you may be looking at your own
[1:33:34] weaknesses
[1:33:36] amen and how little you are
[1:33:38] and how afraid that you can be sometimes
[1:33:41] but god says i see you you are a man of
[1:33:44] valor he's not looking at your past he's
[1:33:47] not even looking at your presence he's
[1:33:50] looking at your future
[1:33:54] hallelujah of people he could say like
[1:33:56] abraham abraham staggered not at the
[1:33:59] promise of god through unbelief
[1:34:02] but was strong in the faith
[1:34:07] hallelujah
[1:34:09] salvation is of the lord that means he
[1:34:11] can make you anything he wants that
[1:34:15] amen
[1:34:17] and gideon said oh my lord
[1:34:19] he said
[1:34:21] if the lord be with us why is all this
[1:34:23] but following us um you know and where
[1:34:26] are be all his miracles which our
[1:34:28] fathers told us of
[1:34:30] saying did not the lord bring us up out
[1:34:32] of egypt but now the lord has forsaken
[1:34:35] us and delivered us into the hands of
[1:34:37] the midianites
[1:34:39] and the lord said unto him go in this
[1:34:41] thy might and thou shalt save israel
[1:34:44] from the hand of the midianites now
[1:34:47] brother branham would say this
[1:34:49] and if god be with us were the miracles
[1:34:52] he said gideon was a scriptural man when
[1:34:55] the angel lord said notice it wasn't the
[1:34:57] angel of the lord here it was in the
[1:35:00] lord capital l-o-r-d
[1:35:02] it was not an angel it was god it was a
[1:35:06] theophany in a man in the form of a man
[1:35:10] light appeared to abraham back in the
[1:35:12] wilderness it looked like a man and
[1:35:14] therefore being a messenger he was the
[1:35:17] angel of the lord so notice what he said
[1:35:19] it was here he was and that's the
[1:35:21] authentic presence
[1:35:24] notice this and and he says he appeared
[1:35:27] to him and when he he was a messenger
[1:35:31] and being a messenger he was the angel
[1:35:34] of the lord so you can see now god
[1:35:36] becomes the angel of the lord in that in
[1:35:39] that office can we call it as the
[1:35:42] messenger of his own cabinet
[1:35:46] i i want you to remember remember in
[1:35:48] revelation 10 well who comes down in the
[1:35:51] last days
[1:35:52] and i saw another mighty angel
[1:35:56] and there was a there was a rainbow over
[1:35:58] his head he was that's a covenant there
[1:36:01] he was a covenant angel
[1:36:03] and he's coming and he declares he
[1:36:05] swears to an end-time people
[1:36:09] that the delay is over
[1:36:12] the time to hold things back
[1:36:15] to keep that keep it all a mystery is
[1:36:17] now finished with
[1:36:24] i'm telling you we are living in some
[1:36:25] tremendous hours
[1:36:30] look here he would appear to manoa and
[1:36:32] his wife promised him a son samson who
[1:36:35] would deliver his people looking judges
[1:36:38] 13 19 manoa took a kid
[1:36:40] with a meat offering
[1:36:42] and
[1:36:43] offered it upon a rock unto the lord and
[1:36:45] the angel did wondrously in manoa and
[1:36:47] his wife looked on for it came to pass
[1:36:50] when the flame went up toward heaven
[1:36:53] from off the altar that the angel lord
[1:36:56] ascended
[1:36:58] in the flame of the altar
[1:37:01] notice here the angel ascends right up
[1:37:05] into the fire
[1:37:07] and
[1:37:07] vanishes out of their sight
[1:37:11] now he's bringing a message
[1:37:14] and he's bringing the messages that i am
[1:37:16] bringing forth a church
[1:37:19] a samson
[1:37:21] somebody help me
[1:37:22] he will have seven locks
[1:37:25] seven church ages
[1:37:28] come on
[1:37:29] amen and this will represent his power
[1:37:31] with god because christ is there in all
[1:37:34] seven ages
[1:37:36] and i made a covenant with him
[1:37:39] and he's going to defeat the enemy
[1:37:42] amen you know the story he becomes
[1:37:45] blinded
[1:37:46] captivated
[1:37:48] and blinded but is that the end of it
[1:37:52] no come on what happens god does what
[1:37:55] restores his strength
[1:37:57] restores the covenant
[1:37:59] restores his glory somebody help me
[1:38:01] preach a man and brings a greater
[1:38:04] deliverance than everyone's down through
[1:38:05] the ages
[1:38:07] you see we are living in the fulfillment
[1:38:10] of prophecy
[1:38:11] where the angel of god comes to announce
[1:38:16] i'm calling a people for my namesake
[1:38:21] now he would appear to david at the
[1:38:22] threshing floor of ornin where he
[1:38:25] stopped to destroy the angel and
[1:38:27] afterwards commanded the prophet god to
[1:38:29] order david to build an altar on that
[1:38:32] rock
[1:38:33] this is a place the very place then that
[1:38:35] david would buy to build the temple
[1:38:39] you know that in ezekiel
[1:38:41] the angel lord receives a report from
[1:38:44] the angels that patrolled and
[1:38:46] investigated the earth and then asked
[1:38:48] god to have mercy upon jerusalem i'm
[1:38:51] trying to show you this this angel is is
[1:38:55] a mediator
[1:38:57] he is always looking out on the behalf
[1:39:00] of god's children
[1:39:02] whatever age that it's been
[1:39:04] and if he was that then and he's the
[1:39:06] same yesterday today and forever he's
[1:39:08] still the mediator come on mediating the
[1:39:12] covenant providing healing delivering
[1:39:15] salvation rapture everything comes out
[1:39:18] of that covenant
[1:39:21] that he mediates on your path
[1:39:24] now who was this angel lord
[1:39:27] he was he is the
[1:39:29] pre-incarnate logos
[1:39:32] in other words the logos
[1:39:34] before it became incarnate
[1:39:36] in jesus
[1:39:40] now he is the district
[1:39:43] personal self manifestation of god
[1:39:46] the incarnate logos
[1:39:48] the word
[1:39:50] made flesh
[1:39:52] notice we read when it come to jesus
[1:39:55] and his beginning he doesn't take it to
[1:39:58] the earthly beginning john takes him now
[1:40:01] as that eagle takes him there to that to
[1:40:04] to his true
[1:40:06] beginning in the beginning
[1:40:08] was the word
[1:40:12] amen so the word was there before there
[1:40:14] was a beginning
[1:40:16] he was the logos
[1:40:18] amen it would be the very first visible
[1:40:22] sign of god as god would condescend
[1:40:25] start condescending toward flesh
[1:40:28] he would come into a form that he could
[1:40:31] be seen
[1:40:32] and this would be the logos
[1:40:35] amen a sacred fire now
[1:40:38] that would that the spirit would dwell
[1:40:40] in
[1:40:42] now
[1:40:43] that the theophanic presence
[1:40:45] could come and and manifest himself in
[1:40:48] what's now he is
[1:40:51] he is john declared he is the creator
[1:40:55] for he said by him by the logos was all
[1:40:58] things created
[1:41:01] then that the that logos became flesh
[1:41:04] and dwelt among us
[1:41:06] amen now this is angel is the angel of
[1:41:10] the covenant none other than the lord
[1:41:12] jesus christ

[1:41:23] chapter 4 and verse 12
[1:41:26] he says for the word
[1:41:29] are the logos
[1:41:31] the logos of god is alive
[1:41:36] you know there's one thing that the word
[1:41:38] is going to do it's going to present the
[1:41:40] resurrected christ
[1:41:42] not
[1:41:44] somebody help me preach now not the
[1:41:46] crucified christ
[1:41:48] but the resurrected christ
[1:41:50] yes he was crucified amen but we must
[1:41:53] see him as a resurrected christ the
[1:41:56] living god
[1:41:57] [Applause]
[1:42:00] hallelujah
[1:42:02] amen there are many that are presented
[1:42:04] him as the crucified christ
[1:42:07] but friends unless he rose from the dead
[1:42:10] and shared that life and birth birthmore
[1:42:13] sons we're all men most
[1:42:16] most helpless
[1:42:19] and most miserable
[1:42:21] for the logos is alive
[1:42:25] amen it is powerful
[1:42:28] it is sharper
[1:42:30] than any two ancient sword it pierces
[1:42:33] even to the dividing asunder of soul and
[1:42:36] spirit
[1:42:38] and of the joints in the moral
[1:42:40] and as a designer of the thoughts
[1:42:43] and entrance of the heart
[1:42:46] this is the logos
[1:42:50] he discerns
[1:42:52] the heart
[1:42:54] he can
[1:42:55] divide between soul and spirit
[1:42:58] amen
[1:43:00] how often did
[1:43:01] i that we've seen brother branham said
[1:43:04] you know i said there's
[1:43:06] something about you
[1:43:08] that says welcome
[1:43:09] the angel lord
[1:43:11] there's a welcoming spirit to him
[1:43:18] that's something true with every
[1:43:20] christian
[1:43:22] every child of god

[1:43:52] god
[1:43:57] this is a god that

[1:44:06] come on
[1:44:07] he he there deals with you on the basis
[1:44:10] of a new birth
[1:44:11] you must be born again
[1:44:14] amen and he divides the center between
[1:44:17] soul and spirit and the joints in the
[1:44:19] moral and as a deserter of the thoughts
[1:44:23] and the intents
[1:44:25] of the heart
[1:44:28] you know just
[1:44:29] recently
[1:44:31] i just

[1:44:55] the um
[1:44:57] the deep calling to the deep for the
[1:44:59] first time
[1:45:00] because um you know we
[1:45:03] it was in some archives and and and we
[1:45:07] didn't know about it and somebody found
[1:45:09] it and
[1:45:10] made arrangements to purchase it
[1:45:12] and we were able to rejoice in that
[1:45:16] and and you know it just brought back
[1:45:19] even what i had seen in my childhood is
[1:45:22] as i knew the angel of god was there in
[1:45:25] the building
[1:45:27] because no man could know the things
[1:45:29] that was discerned
[1:45:31] except the angel of god was present
[1:45:35] i had to be somebody greater than a man
[1:45:38] i'm trying to get something to you we we
[1:45:40] got a word that is ministered by the
[1:45:43] angel of the lord the messenger of the
[1:45:45] covenant jesus christ himself
[1:45:49] i want to get it to you this morning as
[1:45:51] we as i speak on the elohim the revealer
[1:45:54] of mystery truths
[1:45:56] that this is where we're at
[1:45:58] amen that god did not trust it to a man
[1:46:02] he did not he came himself with the
[1:46:04] message
[1:46:07] i want you to get it from from my heart
[1:46:09] to yours today that elohim is a revealer
[1:46:13] of mystery truths that what we believe
[1:46:16] is not just a man made made up something
[1:46:19] it's a message from almighty god
[1:46:22] [Applause]
[1:46:23] god himself so innocent in this
[1:46:25] generation
[1:46:27] that he would not let us go on in the
[1:46:29] era of the past
[1:46:31] but he would send a message to turn your
[1:46:33] heart back to faith again
[1:46:36] not just believing for miracles but
[1:46:38] believe in the original faith the
[1:46:40] original word the original truth
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:46] that we're not just following cunningly
[1:46:48] devised fables
[1:46:55] 1970
[1:46:59] one or two i sat there for my
[1:47:02] first time to watch this film and
[1:47:04] recently you can get on youtube and
[1:47:06] watch it and i would recommend you go
[1:47:09] back through it again
[1:47:10] but they went through it and
[1:47:12] and and colored it made it in color
[1:47:15] and and it's very very nice very well
[1:47:17] done
[1:47:18] but i sat there
[1:47:20] and i just wept as i knew
[1:47:23] the angel of god
[1:47:25] was present
[1:47:27] i didn't see an angel
[1:47:29] though some did
[1:47:33] though some did
[1:47:34] in fact when you go and watch it and we
[1:47:36] won't play it this morning but in the
[1:47:38] last part of deep call of the deep when
[1:47:40] they when that man is called up for you
[1:47:43] know wanting i want an old-fashioned
[1:47:45] pentecostal revival to break out in his
[1:47:47] area and that's why he was standing he
[1:47:49] wasn't sick but but you know later some
[1:47:52] of the believers from brother ron's
[1:47:54] church
[1:47:55] and brother ron spencer he lived in that
[1:47:57] area he he would meet this man and he
[1:48:00] said i saw that angel
[1:48:04] and he said not only that but we have
[1:48:06] that revival
[1:48:08] he said we had about a two three week
[1:48:10] revival where he just was a tremendous
[1:48:13] pouring out of the spirit of god
[1:48:16] i don't know how you feel this morning
[1:48:17] but i don't want a temporary revival
[1:48:21] alone
[1:48:22] come on amen we want a revival and we
[1:48:25] should be in a revival that lasted a
[1:48:27] rapture
[1:48:28] that gives you a passion gives you a lot
[1:48:31] for truth
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:33] amen but then we were watching you know
[1:48:35] again as the hearts was disarmed and you
[1:48:37] knew the angel of god was dead
[1:48:46] as we'll listen to it just for a moment
[1:48:48] what do you think that knows your life
[1:48:50] was it jesus christ you accept it to be
[1:48:53] that
[1:48:54] you know that was something supernatural
[1:48:57] is here and if you believe it to be the
[1:48:59] lord jesus
[1:49:00] as i preached it out of the word and you
[1:49:02] believe it to be the lord jesus
[1:49:04] what was it it was the lord jesus not
[1:49:07] in the body of the lord
[1:49:10] but in the same form he was before he
[1:49:14] became flesh
[1:49:17] back to the logos
[1:49:20] back to the pillow fight
[1:49:23] amen
[1:49:24] so let's just let's just go back into
[1:49:27] that just a moment

[1:56:23] that was just my voice
[1:56:25] was those ever what it was it's
[1:56:27] something i i remember seeing a young
[1:56:29] person or something was it this way it

[1:56:33] said now you believe that god did it you
[1:56:35] believe god
[1:56:36] i'm sure

[1:56:40] moment i see something else a young
[1:56:43] woman seems to be standing near you it's
[1:56:47] a it's a daughter
[1:56:49] and
[1:56:50] yes she was just fixing to go on a trip
[1:56:52] somewhere you were going to see her and
[1:56:54] she's from indiana
[1:56:56] richmond indiana that's where she lives
[1:56:58] and she her husband is a minister and
[1:57:02] she has wrote you a letter something
[1:57:04] telling you not to come because i was
[1:57:06] coming here is that right you're healed
[1:57:09] [Music]
[1:57:20] now what do you think that was
[1:57:22] that knew your life
[1:57:25] was it jesus christ
[1:57:27] are you willing to accept that
[1:57:29] amen then you know that something
[1:57:31] supernatural then has accompanied this
[1:57:34] message
[1:57:36] amen if you believe that the lord be the
[1:57:38] lord jesus as he he says as i preached
[1:57:40] out of the word you believe it to be the
[1:57:42] lord jesus how many believes that
[1:57:44] amen look now it was the word the logos
[1:57:49] who discerns the thoughts and the
[1:57:51] intents of the heart the same thing
[1:57:54] that would happen as elohim would stand
[1:57:56] before sarah and sarah's in the in the
[1:57:59] tent behind him
[1:58:01] and he would tell him to say where you
[1:58:03] sarah thy wife and he would call her by
[1:58:05] the name
[1:58:06] that had been named by given by the
[1:58:09] angel of the lord
[1:58:11] and then here he would stand there and
[1:58:13] and now
[1:58:15] tell that she would have a son and then
[1:58:17] discern her heart
[1:58:19] and let her know you know that i know
[1:58:22] what you're thinking
[1:58:25] i discerned the thoughts in an intense
[1:58:27] heart she was she laughed within herself
[1:58:30] saying me an old woman gonna have a
[1:58:32] child
[1:58:33] you know and and and so on and this
[1:58:35] would be the same thing that would
[1:58:37] happen when it became flesh in jesus
[1:58:40] christ is that right he would call um he
[1:58:43] would call and speak
[1:58:45] to to peter and tell him his name and he
[1:58:48] would also speak out to nathanael and
[1:58:51] tell him he was an israelite in whom
[1:58:54] where there was no guile and and he said
[1:58:56] when philip called you under the tree i
[1:58:58] saw you
[1:59:00] is that right and this made that man
[1:59:03] that that hebrew say
[1:59:05] thou art the king of israel
[1:59:07] thou art god
[1:59:10] because he recognized only god could
[1:59:12] know the thoughts and intents of the
[1:59:14] heart
[1:59:15] is that right
[1:59:16] amen so you know when we're looking at
[1:59:19] this we're not talking about somebody
[1:59:22] out in the audience has got a backache
[1:59:24] we're not talking about some generalized
[1:59:27] something or or hit and miss we're not
[1:59:30] talking about a one-time event
[1:59:33] this would happen thousands of times
[1:59:37] service active service showing us over
[1:59:40] and over again that jesus christ is
[1:59:43] alive
[1:59:45] and that he's present
[1:59:47] and that he's accept a message
[1:59:51] come on church he's sending a message
[1:59:55] for an end-time people
[1:59:57] and it would be right down specific down
[2:00:00] to the to to the nitty-gritty there's a
[2:00:03] dark spirit of death hanging around you
[2:00:06] now you know that's one number two in
[2:00:08] the form of a cancer on the breast you
[2:00:11] know they're there again that's actually
[2:00:13] three you know because it tells on the
[2:00:16] breast and then it tells it's a cancer
[2:00:19] and then then again the description of
[2:00:21] the doctor you were examined by someone
[2:00:24] strong you have a rupture in the bowels
[2:00:27] also
[2:00:28] and you're out stomach trouble as well
[2:00:32] and then you have a severe heart trouble
[2:00:34] that causes you fainting and then it
[2:00:37] goes back into her life and he says i
[2:00:39] saw you i see you sitting on the side
[2:00:42] the bed and you fell over sideways and
[2:00:45] you but you were you nearly passed out
[2:00:47] you were looking toward the window
[2:00:49] and then it carries it right on your
[2:00:51] name is eva
[2:00:53] york
[2:00:54] you live in this city which is
[2:00:56] washington dc
[2:00:58] yeah and then gave that the street
[2:01:00] number 613 6th street and then told her
[2:01:04] you're going home to be well
[2:01:06] i'll tell you that was not humanly
[2:01:08] possible
[2:01:12] the biggest charlatan in the world could
[2:01:14] not guess that many times and be acting
[2:01:19] are you with me amen then not only that
[2:01:21] but go out into the audience
[2:01:24] and pick him out and say you've got a
[2:01:26] rupture there don't you sir you're just
[2:01:28] praying
[2:01:31] let him call me
[2:01:33] a man the next one comes up you're from

[2:01:38] capital also it's richmond virginia you
[2:01:41] have a cancer it's inside your mouth on
[2:01:44] the jaw

[2:01:57] you've been a great believer
[2:01:59] you prayed for this hour
[2:02:01] and you said in your prayer
[2:02:05] isn't it comforting that god knows your
[2:02:07] prayer
[2:02:09] that none of your prayers
[2:02:11] are going down to the ground
[2:02:15] amen you think they're unheard god's
[2:02:18] letting you know i i'm with you

[2:02:29] years you've suffered
[2:02:32] but but you know you've been a believer

[2:05:35] 15 16 years old when i first saw that
[2:05:38] film the first time
[2:05:42] i remember the impact
[2:05:44] again
[2:05:46] i relived those moments
[2:05:49] oh
[2:05:50] but if we could only be like
[2:05:52] the little two-year-old girl of a pastor
[2:05:54] friend of mine
[2:05:57] they were watching the first release
[2:06:00] of the deep color to the deep
[2:06:03] the little baby had a ruptured navel i i
[2:06:06] don't know how big it was but it looked
[2:06:07] like it was at least an inch and a half
[2:06:09] sticking out
[2:06:11] it was big
[2:06:13] and she was about two years old and her
[2:06:15] mother many times would sit and hold
[2:06:17] that navel in while she held a child in
[2:06:20] her lap
[2:06:22] and
[2:06:23] and just to say
[2:06:24] say it lightly it was ugly it was
[2:06:26] unsightly
[2:06:29] but they watched that film and after
[2:06:31] church that night when the family went
[2:06:32] into their home
[2:06:34] the mother was carrying the child and
[2:06:37] she had a you know two years old a very
[2:06:39] limited vocabulary and she was
[2:06:42] hardly talking or barely talking
[2:06:45] and she as they passed by the hoffman's
[2:06:47] head of christ
[2:06:49] the picture that was in their home
[2:06:52] and she
[2:06:53] she pointed up to the hoffman's head of
[2:06:56] christ's picture
[2:06:57] and she says look look that man
[2:07:01] and and and then she picked up her dress
[2:07:04] exposing her her her navel and said she
[2:07:08] and her navel was completely healed
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:20] amen now who did that child see
[2:07:25] something that looks similar to that
[2:07:26] huffman's head oh christ right there
[2:07:30] she saw some look that man and pulls up
[2:07:33] her dress and and shows her belly and
[2:07:36] shows her navel is completely well
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:44] amen i want to tell you the angel of the
[2:07:46] lord continues to watch over that
[2:07:49] message
[2:07:50] that was five years after the prophet
[2:07:52] had left and he was showing he was still
[2:07:55] here
[2:07:56] and he still cares
[2:08:00] and just like he healed ruptures and on
[2:08:02] that film he was healing raptured right
[2:08:05] there in that meeting and then a little
[2:08:07] child who saw him
[2:08:10] received a touch from the almighty
[2:08:12] [Applause]
[2:08:14] hallelujah what was god doing again
[2:08:16] showing us i haven't left this pride i
[2:08:19] haven't left my people i might have

[2:08:24] but i'm still here and i'm still the
[2:08:27] healer and i'm still the deliverer and
[2:08:29] i'm still the savior
[2:08:34] i'll say that none of this word none of
[2:08:37] this message will fall to the ground

[2:09:11] is gonna fall to the ground
[2:09:13] i'm a god of details
[2:09:20] if god does that how much more
[2:09:22] confidence
[2:09:24] can we be in knowing he's going to have
[2:09:26] rapture in his last days
[2:09:34] now he said this angel of god
[2:09:36] sent from jesus christ to testify to the
[2:09:39] church that the last days are here it
[2:09:41] doesn't heal anybody it just brings your
[2:09:43] faith up to that place see healing was
[2:09:46] down at calvary
[2:09:49] amount
[2:09:51] it was done at calvary yes he still
[2:09:53] heals but his own what he did at calvary
[2:09:57] again he said this message would go
[2:09:59] around the world and it would start a
[2:10:00] revival that'll sweep around the world
[2:10:03] and it'll be just before the coming of
[2:10:05] christ the second time and i just say it
[2:10:07] started a revival
[2:10:09] and i want to say i am that revival
[2:10:13] [Applause]
[2:10:14] hallelujah i'm preaching now 51 years
[2:10:17] and i ain't burned down yet and i'm not
[2:10:20] going to burn down amen i cannot burn
[2:10:23] down and i'm sorry
[2:10:25] knock down
[2:10:34] starting one in me
[2:10:36] it gave me a passion
[2:10:38] gave me a desire
[2:10:41] it gave me a word
[2:10:43] now the purpose of the coming angel was
[2:10:45] to make god personal to us
[2:10:48] to make us aware of a supernatural
[2:10:50] gospel
[2:10:53] and
[2:10:54] the message of the end time
[2:10:57] you see it's make us aware of the
[2:10:59] message of the end time because its
[2:11:01] mysteries can only be revealed by god
[2:11:05] through a prophet
[2:11:08] so that we can declare that bible days
[2:11:11] are here again
[2:11:14] understand the same angel that stood
[2:11:17] before abraham is here
[2:11:23] brother branham would say i just watched
[2:11:25] for his sign how many knows jesus
[2:11:28] today is a bill of fire that followed
[2:11:30] the children of israel i came from god
[2:11:32] i'd go to god
[2:11:35] this is his words we'll get in the
[2:11:36] scripture in a few minutes i came from
[2:11:38] god i go to god
[2:11:42] amen is that what he said when paul met
[2:11:44] him on the road to damascus what was he
[2:11:46] he was the great light the pillar of
[2:11:48] fire
[2:11:49] he is the same one today this ho the
[2:11:52] holy spirit of god the body of jesus
[2:11:54] sits at the right hand of god on his
[2:11:57] throne in heaven but his spirit is
[2:11:59] here on the earth completing and
[2:12:02] finishing
[2:12:03] his
[2:12:04] work and that same spirit that lived in
[2:12:07] the body of jesus was the same spirit
[2:12:10] that was in that angel that come to
[2:12:12] sodom and gomorrah do you believe that
[2:12:15] the same one that followed the children
[2:12:17] of israel the same god
[2:12:21] amen
[2:12:23] my you're you're people who can say more
[2:12:25] than any other people
[2:12:27] you're following the god of moses
[2:12:31] you're following the god of abraham
[2:12:34] you're following the god of jacob
[2:12:39] he would demonstrate his power to heal
[2:12:41] the sick to cast out devils showing the
[2:12:44] same attitude that he had to heal the
[2:12:46] sick because he couldn't if he can't
[2:12:49] heal the sick how can he change the body
[2:12:54] and i hear brother branham say may the
[2:12:56] angel that has sent forth thy servant
[2:12:58] stand by me tonight meet these diseases
[2:13:01] till every demon spirit will scream
[2:13:05] may the power be predominant for driving
[2:13:08] out every every sick person that is in
[2:13:12] this building out of these afflicted
[2:13:14] people who sit in here in these chairs
[2:13:17] bound shaken stroke paralyzed palsy
[2:13:21] whatever it is cancer ridden
[2:13:25] is there anything too hard for the lord
[2:13:28] amen this is a god who specializes in
[2:13:31] things not impossible
[2:13:33] and i say don't give up on your promise
[2:13:36] i don't care how afflicted your children
[2:13:39] are i don't care how afflicted this
[2:13:41] situation is how evil it is and what the
[2:13:44] enemy has done and how you have been
[2:13:46] beaten don't give up on the promise he
[2:13:49] is here to fulfill that promise
[2:13:58] let me encourage you to prepare yourself
[2:14:00] for the angel's visitation
[2:14:08] because he's looking for faith
[2:14:11] he's looking for somebody that believed
[2:14:12] him
[2:14:15] amen
[2:14:16] he's looking to see that you signed
[2:14:18] crime for the abominations
[2:14:20] the sin makes you sick
[2:14:23] and he's marking an elect
[2:14:25] for rapture
[2:14:28] he's looking for sincerity and a love
[2:14:30] for truth
[2:14:31] and a passion for it
[2:14:38] brother branham talks about this
[2:14:41] and the unchangeable word of god he said
[2:14:44] these wars you take young kids out just
[2:14:46] the cream of the crop
[2:14:47] they don't know no better
[2:14:50] knowing discipline army discipline stick
[2:14:52] your head up over the hill and let
[2:14:54] someone shoot it off die like a hero
[2:14:57] they gladly do it
[2:14:59] run up there on one shot down on another
[2:15:01] and shot down another shot down
[2:15:04] and the nation forgets them
[2:15:07] unless they're family
[2:15:09] come back to this here and whatever they
[2:15:11] come back to you see many of the
[2:15:13] soldiers now see he's talking about
[2:15:16] men and and and people that are in
[2:15:20] the nation's army and they just blindly
[2:15:23] followed the discipline
[2:15:26] but he said a man seldom will you ever
[2:15:29] find one that'll lay down his life for
[2:15:31] the cause of christ he won't even crawl
[2:15:33] out of his shade tree to go to church he
[2:15:36] won't get out from behind television
[2:15:37] long enough to attend wednesday night
[2:15:39] prayer meeting
[2:15:41] hey man it's a shame disgrace that's the
[2:15:43] reason angels don't visit the churches
[2:15:46] that's the reason angels don't visit
[2:15:48] homes we got to get down to deep
[2:15:50] sincerity of this thing the angels of
[2:15:53] god are here on earth tonight just the
[2:15:55] same as they've always been the holy
[2:15:57] ghost have been here ever since the
[2:15:59] resurrection of jesus christ and are
[2:16:01] coming forth of pentecost he's appeared
[2:16:03] down to all the ages getting the remnant
[2:16:05] of people together the rest of it is
[2:16:08] cannon fodder
[2:16:09] and i'll just tell you now it's a fodder
[2:16:12] that'll mix with smoke out of the
[2:16:14] torment yes sir it'll take a born-again
[2:16:17] experience washed in the blood of the
[2:16:19] lamb sanctified filled with the holy
[2:16:21] ghost or they'll never make that rapture
[2:16:26] are you with me
[2:16:27] amen but i tell you what let's be a
[2:16:30] people
[2:16:32] who gets ready amount for the appearing
[2:16:35] of the angel
[2:16:36] what we can say like paul did he
[2:16:38] appeared to me also
[2:16:40] he appeared to peter he appeared to
[2:16:42] james he appeared to john he appeared to
[2:16:44] mary he appeared to this and then that
[2:16:46] one but he's appeared to be awesome
[2:16:48] [Applause]
[2:16:54] now most time in brother bradley's
[2:16:56] meetings
[2:16:57] i i would say
[2:16:59] he didn't always see the man he saw the
[2:17:01] light the pillar of fire
[2:17:04] and he says the presence of the
[2:17:06] supernatural which is the lord jesus
[2:17:09] christ his angel stands near you see is
[2:17:12] the angel of his presence where he comes
[2:17:14] and his presence is manifested and now
[2:17:18] he said
[2:17:19] his angel stands near that that's the
[2:17:21] pillar of fire but now when i see the
[2:17:23] man
[2:17:23] it isn't the lord jesus it's a great big
[2:17:26] talmud great tall man way bigger than
[2:17:28] what christ i seen in the vision christ
[2:17:30] was a very small person but this is a
[2:17:32] big man and a smooth face
[2:17:39] now
[2:17:41] notice
[2:17:42] there's a difference between the pillar
[2:17:44] of fire
[2:17:45] and that's
[2:17:46] that angel that olive complexion angel
[2:17:50] that he saw step out of that fire
[2:17:54] but that pillar of fire he said is none
[2:17:57] other
[2:18:00] than the lord jesus christ
[2:18:05] i want you to understand who we have
[2:18:07] been visited
[2:18:08] by who it is that is among us
[2:18:12] this elohim
[2:18:14] that stayed with abraham
[2:18:16] that provided an anointing
[2:18:19] that we are anointed by
[2:18:24] now
[2:18:26] so he so as he said christ is here the
[2:18:29] holy spirit the angel of god i'm merely
[2:18:33] just a mouthpiece for him
[2:18:35] and moses is just a mouthpiece for me
[2:18:37] jesus was a mouthpiece for god and he
[2:18:40] died to redeem us sinner that the
[2:18:41] program of god might be carried on down
[2:18:44] to the age through the church and
[2:18:45] ministers that are consecrated to god
[2:18:48] become channels where god can speak
[2:18:51] through preach the gospel heal the sick
[2:18:54] and show signs and wonders
[2:18:57] hallelujah so there again god has a
[2:18:59] voice even in the pulpit
[2:19:02] that is anointed by the angel
[2:19:05] to bring a word
[2:19:08] hallelujah that god can speak through
[2:19:10] that channel and preach the gospel and
[2:19:12] kill the sick and show signs and wonders
[2:19:16] i know because i better know anybody
[2:19:18] that angel
[2:19:21] hallelujah but not only am i anointed by
[2:19:23] that angel but you also have been undone
[2:19:26] by that angel
[2:19:28] hallelujah amen
[2:19:31] for christ is here among his church
[2:19:34] he would say
[2:19:36] with reverend's sincere heart i believe
[2:19:38] that's the same angel of god that led to
[2:19:41] israel out of egypt on the promised land
[2:19:44] to the promised land and the natural is
[2:19:46] leading to us us today to the promised
[2:19:48] land in the spiritual
[2:19:51] for in my father's house
[2:19:53] are many mansions
[2:19:55] and i'll go
[2:19:56] and prepare a place for you
[2:19:59] and i believe the angel lord is leading
[2:20:01] the church
[2:20:02] today
[2:20:06] did anybody hear that
[2:20:08] do you believe what the prophet believed
[2:20:10] i believe the angel of the lord
[2:20:13] is leading the church today and it's the
[2:20:16] same holy spirit
[2:20:18] and anyone knows the angel of the
[2:20:20] covenant was christ
[2:20:22] it is now and it's not just to me
[2:20:25] friend i might be counted in with you
[2:20:28] but that angel doesn't
[2:20:31] that angel just doesn't to me it's to
[2:20:33] all of you
[2:20:36] and he's here right now he's in the
[2:20:38] building i felt it right now and i know
[2:20:40] that the angel the same angel that i'm
[2:20:42] speaking of here isn't five feet from me
[2:20:44] now i'll meet you at the judgment bar
[2:20:47] until this night is called to order see
[2:20:50] if i haven't told you the truth he is
[2:20:52] right in here now
[2:20:56] you said brother tim that's wonderful
[2:20:58] that's the way it was when brother
[2:20:59] branham was here but he said now
[2:21:01] remember this
[2:21:03] when i'm gone
[2:21:05] jesus will still be here
[2:21:09] when i'm not at your church christ will
[2:21:11] still be there just to say
[2:21:15] how many believes that word this morning
[2:21:18] amen oh my the angels
[2:21:21] are sent forth from his presence
[2:21:24] ministered spirits sent forth from the
[2:21:26] presence of god do you understand
[2:21:28] brother god never takes his spirit from
[2:21:31] the earth
[2:21:34] he takes his mind but never his spirit
[2:21:37] god taken elijah but the spirit of
[2:21:39] elijah came on elisha
[2:21:42] and then several hundred years later it
[2:21:44] came on the john the baptist the same
[2:21:46] spirit made him act the same way and
[2:21:48] then we prophesied it's here again in
[2:21:50] the last days god takes his man but his
[2:21:53] spirit remains
[2:21:57] he taken his son
[2:22:00] but his spirit stayed on earth the holy
[2:22:03] spirit he sent it back to earth to live
[2:22:06] among mankind
[2:22:08] so the age of the lord the pillar of
[2:22:10] fire is still here
[2:22:13] sometimes you know it can be seen
[2:22:16] visible
[2:22:18] sometimes it can be manifested in the
[2:22:20] form of a man
[2:22:23] but he's still here
[2:22:25] and when my brother branham left here
[2:22:27] elohim did not leave
[2:22:29] [Applause]
[2:22:30] that anointing still anoints a bride
[2:22:33] even till today
[2:22:35] come on
[2:22:36] listen what happened what changed when
[2:22:38] roberts left
[2:22:40] no nothing really changed
[2:22:42] you see preachers were under the same
[2:22:44] under that anointing continued fleecing
[2:22:47] the people with promises of prosperity
[2:22:50] and exchange for enriching them
[2:22:53] come on
[2:22:54] under that anointing they still continue
[2:22:56] to preach faith without no change in
[2:22:58] life
[2:23:00] amen what changed with graham's
[2:23:03] departure
[2:23:05] that anointing continues
[2:23:08] amen through ministers preaching easy
[2:23:10] believism
[2:23:12] and persuading people they're saved
[2:23:14] while still living a life of sin
[2:23:18] you see oral roberts and billy graham
[2:23:21] was not the angel they were anointed by
[2:23:23] the angels
[2:23:25] and so are we anointed by elohim
[2:23:31] that anointing that you've seen there
[2:23:33] that knows the thoughts and endings of
[2:23:35] heart is still anointing a people in
[2:23:38] this last day you are under an anointing
[2:23:48] now it wasn't just paul
[2:23:50] the church age messenger that saw angels
[2:23:53] you think it's limited just to the
[2:23:55] messengers
[2:23:57] you know
[2:23:58] brother ron
[2:23:59] was spencer and i was in a meeting up
[2:24:01] with brother jason jackson's
[2:24:03] god did some phenomenal things
[2:24:06] one was a man who had
[2:24:08] cancer throughout his body
[2:24:10] and he went to his church and he said
[2:24:12] listen the bible said anoint with oil
[2:24:14] and pray the prayer of faith and god
[2:24:16] will raise him up was will you pray for
[2:24:18] the sick no we don't do that here
[2:24:22] man dying with cancer
[2:24:26] and he appears at one of the brothers
[2:24:27] body shops up there that he restores
[2:24:31] automobiles that have been wrecked
[2:24:34] and and he he comes there and he said
[2:24:37] you know i'm dying with with cancer the
[2:24:40] doctor has given me a i'm four stage
[2:24:42] cancer
[2:24:44] and said uh they

[2:25:05] the side of the building or way on the
[2:25:08] side as as he as he called him out and
[2:25:11] and he prayed with him
[2:25:13] and there the holy spirit just came down
[2:25:16] in a miraculous way and the report is
[2:25:18] that it's come back to us as the man is
[2:25:21] totally free from cancer
[2:25:24] [Music]
[2:25:32] but because mother ron had seen some
[2:25:34] visions it was a sister came up and she
[2:25:36] said um you know only brother branham

[2:38:36] flesh and dwelt among us
[2:38:39] and because he would come forth from the
[2:38:42] father he would be called the son
[2:38:47] and as the son of god
[2:38:49] he would manifest himself on earth
[2:38:53] and he would come looking
[2:38:55] for his own
[2:38:57] now he said i came to my own
[2:39:00] come to the church
[2:39:02] but they received me not

[2:39:08] for as many as receive me
[2:39:11] they have the authority to become the
[2:39:13] sons of god
[2:39:15] and they're not born of the will of man
[2:39:17] or the will of the flesh
[2:39:19] but of god
[2:39:24] because they're offsprings
[2:39:26] of this pillar of fire
[2:39:31] the bible said in him was life
[2:39:35] and this life was the light of men
[2:39:39] the aramaic said in him was lives
[2:39:43] plural
[2:39:46] because you were in him
[2:39:50] that's why when you were born again
[2:39:54] a portion of that same logos the pillar
[2:39:57] of fire came into your life
[2:39:59] [Music]
[2:40:01] making you a son or daughter
[2:40:04] of the logos
[2:40:07] no wonder you believe the word
[2:40:10] because
[2:40:12] you are that word
[2:40:13] [Music]

[2:40:19] message
[2:40:20] i am the message
[2:40:25] i can't deny it
[2:40:28] because
[2:40:29] he can't
[2:40:30] deny
[2:40:32] himself
[2:40:34] [Music]
[2:40:39] and since he can't deny himself
[2:40:42] he can't deny you
[2:40:54] and when i take a rapture into satan's
[2:40:56] eden
[2:40:58] and i lift my spirit
[2:41:01] because you're born of it
[2:41:03] you're lifted with me

[2:42:22] that god had of you before the world
[2:42:24] began
[2:42:26] it'll match

[2:43:06] seed of god
