[37:56] prayers amen been real down in the
[37:59] valley a little bit but amen we're
[38:01] coming out of it asking the Lord for
[38:04] strength tonight amen Psalms chapter 23
[38:07] and verse one says the Lord is my
[38:09] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[38:13] to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth
[38:16] me to beside the Still Waters he
[38:19] restoreth my soul he leadth me in the
[38:21] paths of righteousness for his name's
[38:24] sake yay though I walk through the
[38:26] valley of The Shadow death I will fear
[38:29] no evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[38:32] thy staff they comfort me thou preparest
[38:36] a table before me in the presence of my
[38:39] enemy thou anointest my head with oil my
[38:42] cup run over surely goodness and mercy
[38:47] shall follow me all the days of my life
[38:49] and I will dwell in the house of the
[38:52] Lord forever amen God bless you you can
[38:54] be
[38:56] seated you want to speak something else
[38:58] tonight but I spoke this at the Ohio or
[39:02] the Oklahoma Youth Camp and so things
[39:04] begin to kind of whirl over me this
[39:07] afternoon about this subject so I'd like
[39:10] to speak to you on choosing Faith over
[39:13] fear amen choosing Faith over fear I I
[39:16] believe we do have a choice many choices
[39:19] in life that we make amen and and we
[39:21] have a choice to believe or not believe
[39:23] we have a choice to trust or not trust
[39:26] and you know uh this is the choice that
[39:29] David made in this scripture he said I'm
[39:32] walking through the valley of the shadow
[39:34] of death but I will fear no evil amen
[39:37] even though I'm in the Valley of this
[39:39] shadow of death and there's all kind of
[39:41] things around me and my enemies all
[39:43] around me I choose to still trust you
[39:47] amen I TR choose to not fear the evil
[39:50] that's around us and you know we've been
[39:52] on faith for a little bit and we know in
[39:54] Hebrews chapter 11 and the Amplified is
[39:57] says now Faith is the Assurance or the
[39:59] title deed or the confirmation of things
[40:02] hoped for that are that are divinely
[40:05] guaranteed it is the evidence of Things
[40:07] Not Seen it's the conviction of their
[40:11] reality in other words whether you see
[40:13] them or that you don't see them it does
[40:15] not matter there's still a reality that
[40:17] Faith grabs a hold of and Faith
[40:20] comprehends this fact what cannot be
[40:22] experienced by the physical sense for by
[40:26] this kind of faith
[40:27] the men of old gain Divine approval amen
[40:31] by faith that is that inherit trust or
[40:33] enduring enduring confidence in the
[40:37] power and wisdom and goodness of God we
[40:40] understand that the worlds the universes
[40:42] were framed and created they were formed
[40:45] they were put in order they were
[40:47] equipped for the intended purpose by the
[40:49] word of God so that which is seen was
[40:53] not made was not made out of things
[40:55] which are visible now we could go on and
[40:58] we maybe will one as we get into all
[41:00] these things but every Hebrew every hero
[41:03] of Faith amen they they were chose they
[41:06] were they were Heroes of Faith because
[41:07] they chose Faith over fear they chose to
[41:11] believe no matter what they saw no
[41:13] matter what they felt no matter what
[41:15] their circumstances were amen they chose
[41:18] faith and now we understand that faith
[41:20] will will will either paralyze your fear
[41:24] or your fear will paralyze your faith
[41:27] Amen in Hebrews chapter 11 as we would
[41:29] go down by faith Abraham by faith Sarah
[41:32] by faith Enoch by faith amen it wasn't
[41:35] by fear it was by faith amen because in
[41:38] spite of what they saw or in spite of
[41:41] what they felt they still believed amen
[41:43] and I I believe we we're we're that kind
[41:45] of people tonight I believe if these
[41:47] chapters would continue to be written
[41:50] there'd be others by faith this one and
[41:52] by faith that one and amen by faith we
[41:55] overcome amen because faith find sources
[41:58] that nothing else can see faith can find
[42:01] something that your eyes cannot declare
[42:03] tonight it it'll find something that you
[42:06] may may not be able to explain it you
[42:08] may not be able to tell it what it what
[42:09] how it's going to be but you believe it
[42:12] anyhow cuz why Faith tells you that
[42:15] faith is something that's revealed to
[42:17] you it may not be yet but it's revealed
[42:19] to you and you believe it as if it were
[42:21] so already amen faith is a revelation of
[42:25] the will of God brother R said the
[42:27] trouble is the church is scared oh I'm
[42:30] afraid of this don't be afraid you said
[42:33] well oh if I can just if I can just it
[42:36] isn't you it's
[42:38] him amen it isn't you it's him well I'm
[42:41] not worthy of healing being healed sure
[42:44] you're not worthy I'm not worthy nobody
[42:46] is but he is worthy it isn't our
[42:49] worthiness it's his goodness to us he
[42:52] said in the old Covenant he said if a
[42:54] little old mule was born and and you
[42:56] know was and a pasture born in a pasture
[42:59] and born with some flopped ears and
[43:00] knocked knees and and just a horrible
[43:02] looking mule crossy and his tail
[43:04] sticking up and you know just horrible
[43:06] looking if he'd look around his M say
[43:08] you know what soon as the Master of the
[43:10] House comes out he's going to knock me
[43:12] in the head I'm not even worthy of the
[43:14] food I eat I I'm no good but if his
[43:16] Mammy would just be would just instruct
[43:19] him for a minute she said now wait a
[43:20] minute son just wait a minute I'm going
[43:22] to tell you something maybe you don't
[43:23] know I I I want to tell you you know I
[43:26] know you I you don't know who you are
[43:28] see you're born under a Birthright and
[43:31] when the Master of the House said I
[43:32] don't care what you look like but when
[43:34] he comes out and this new mule is Born
[43:36] the thing he has to do is get a lamb
[43:38] without blemish and take that perfect
[43:41] lamb and he his life for your life he
[43:44] said then when that little mule would
[43:45] hear that he can forget what he looks
[43:48] like he can forget about all the
[43:50] imperfections and all of that he can
[43:52] just kick his heels up and have a big
[43:54] time he said that's the way it is with
[43:56] us we're imperfect we're no good we're
[43:59] born in sin we were shaped in iniquity
[44:01] we come in this world speaking Lies We
[44:04] were no good to begin with but to begin
[44:07] with God didn't look at
[44:10] you hallelujah amen to begin with God
[44:13] didn't look at you he looks at the
[44:16] sacrifice he looks at the Lamb of God he
[44:19] doesn't see me he doesn't see you and
[44:22] why he sees Christ Jesus died for me he
[44:25] said if you if you can find some fault
[44:27] with Jesus then your healing might not
[44:29] be yours but if you don't find no fault
[44:32] with him it's perfect amen God called
[44:35] you by his grace not what you was but if
[44:38] God what God W is the scripture said he
[44:41] was the lamb slain from the foundation
[44:43] of the world that was God's word when

[45:00] foresaw by his for knowledge how he
[45:03] redeemed the world out of the sin and
[45:05] Corruption he slayed Christ before the
[45:08] foundation of the world and he spoke the
[45:11] word 4,000 years before it was ever
[45:13] manifested and the Book of Revelation
[45:15] said when the Antichrist come upon the
[45:17] Earth he will deceive all the Earth
[45:19] whose name were written in the Lambs
[45:21] except for those whose name were written

[48:29] this going to do you if it's just
[48:31] written in a book but God wants you to
[48:33] put it in into action God wants you to
[48:35] make it something that's Liv not
[48:37] something that just read about not
[48:39] something just talked about not just
[48:41] something of 500 years ago or 50 years
[48:43] ago or 2,000 years ago or 5,000 years
[48:47] ago he wants something that lives today
[48:50] even now in this moment that you'll put
[48:53] faith into action and when Satan rise up
[48:56] you'll call him
[48:57] liar when Satan Rises up you say it

[49:03] a daughter of God I'm an heir to this
[49:06] take your hands off of God's
[49:11] Property but people get
[49:13] afraid and fear tries to come in this is
[49:17] where the uh the disciples were and we
[49:19] can read about it in Mark chapter 4 and
[49:21] verse
[49:23] 35 had to bear with me a little bit
[49:27] the same day when the evening was come
[49:29] he said to them let's pass over to the
[49:31] other
[49:32] side amen there there's peace in that
[49:35] right
[49:36] there we just take him at his
[49:42] word you know if they would have just
[49:44] said okay got in the boat and went they
[49:46] wouldn't have worried about the
[49:48] waves cuz he said let's go to the other
[49:51] side amen you know God God God does it
[49:55] that way he does it that way on purpose
[49:56] because he wants you to know he wants to
[49:58] see what you're going to react when you
[50:00] get in the
[50:01] waves when you get in the desert you get
[50:04] in you see that's what he told the
[50:05] children of Israel I've used it many
[50:07] times he said I'm going to take you out
[50:08] of a land but I'm going to take you into
[50:10] a land but he didn't tell them about
[50:12] everything in between why he did it on
[50:14] purpose one one he wasn't worried about
[50:17] everything in between he already had it
[50:18] taken care of but he wanted to see their
[50:21] reaction and how they would react to
[50:24] what he was doing and and God that's why
[50:26] God allows things to come upon us
[50:28] sicknesses and situations of life or
[50:31] things that we didn't see coming there's
[50:32] a lot of things maybe this morning that
[50:34] hit you you didn't see coming but God
[50:37] saw it coming before it ever got there
[50:40] nothing surprises our God we ought to
[50:42] know that by now nothing surprises him
[50:44] he knows every morning that's going to
[50:46] break he knows every day that's going to
[50:48] take he knows what's going to go on in
[50:50] the day every 24 hours of it he's not
[50:53] caught on by surprise he's not caught by
[50:56] maybe maybe this you know he's not
[50:57] sitting there maybe this will happen
[50:59] maybe this won't he already knows all
[51:01] about it but it allows us to get up and
[51:03] go through our day not knowing what
[51:06] we're going to face that day not knowing
[51:08] if we're going to get sick not knowing
[51:09] if we're going to face turmoil not
[51:11] knowing if we're going to face tragedies
[51:13] not knowing anything about these things
[51:15] but knowing he is there and he's able to
[51:18] help me no matter what I'm going through
[51:21] amen God wants to see what your reaction
[51:23] is going to be amen when you go through
[51:25] something that's a why he allows us to
[51:28] go through the things we go through now
[51:30] we don't always go all go through the
[51:32] same things now God knows what each one
[51:34] of us can
[51:36] take he knows I can take things some of
[51:38] y'all can't take some of y'all can take
[51:40] things I can't
[51:42] take and he promised he wouldn't put
[51:44] more on us than what we can
[51:48] bear amen I'm thankful for that
[51:51] scripture right there but let us pass
[51:54] over unto the other side now brother
[51:57] brandham brother Tims went through this
[51:59] before about the revivals and and and
[52:02] and different types brother brandham
[52:04] would use uh uh those that went off
[52:06] without Jesus and those that went with
[52:08] Jesus in their ship I personally believe
[52:10] we we got Jesus in the ship I don't
[52:13] believe we went off without him I I
[52:15] believe he's here with us and this is
[52:17] where we're coming from and he's laying
[52:19] there asleep and he's in between
[52:21] revivals and he's laying there resting
[52:23] and and but there arose a great storm of
[52:26] wind and waves beat the ship now that it
[52:29] was so that it was now full now you you
[52:32] you know that he knew this was going to
[52:34] happen when he said let's go to the
[52:36] other
[52:38] side do we believe that I I believe that
[52:41] I believe he knew but he's there resting
[52:43] and he's wanting to see what their
[52:45] reaction is going to be how they're
[52:48] going to react and how what they're
[52:50] going to do about it and and here they
[52:53] he's asleep and they wake him up Master
[52:56] don't you care that we perish and he
[52:57] rose and rebuked the wind and said unto
[53:00] the sea peace be still and the wind
[53:03] ceased and there was a great calm and he
[53:05] said to them why are you so fearful how
[53:09] is it that you have no faith you should
[53:11] have believed what I
[53:15] said you should have believed that I
[53:17] knew that this is going to take place
[53:19] and I would have the answer for
[53:24] it well the doctor says there ain't no
[53:26] hope and boy when that comes that's when
[53:29] fear steps
[53:30] in or there you know it's an incurable
[53:34] disease I love how brother Tim said it
[53:36] before there's not no such a thing as an
[53:38] incurable
[53:42] disease
[53:44] amen he said he said doctor says well
[53:47] there's no hope or it's paralysis or
[53:49] it's some leukemia or something like
[53:51] that fear begins to set in but it
[53:55] shouldn't
[53:58] did you hear that the the prophet of God
[54:00] said it shouldn't who is this that made
[54:03] the
[54:05] promise what are we living for why are
[54:08] we the Church of the Living God why are
[54:11] we filled with the Holy
[54:13] Ghost why is all why why to remember in
[54:17] times of trouble he's still
[54:22] here amen he stabilizes things he's the
[54:26] yesterday today and forever he's with us
[54:29] just the same he might be resting for a
[54:31] few moments between meetings but he's
[54:34] still here just the
[54:36] same he never left us he promised he
[54:39] would not he said but when trouble sets
[54:41] in and Faith of him being instead of
[54:44] having faith of him being with us fear
[54:46] sets in and when fear sets in then we
[54:49] really got trouble
[54:52] then just because it's trouble don't
[54:55] mean that you're in trouble into you
[54:56] start fearing the
[54:58] trouble then you got
[55:01] trouble he said you know people are
[55:03] scared to death of the world going to
[55:06] Pieces they ought to be some of them
[55:09] ought to be we're right there at the
[55:11] time this world going to go to Pieces
[55:13] it's prophesied in the Bible it's all
[55:15] written right here it's going to burn
[55:16] with
[55:17] fire but I'm not scared of the world
[55:20] going to Pieces there's going to be a
[55:22] thousand year Millennium
[55:24] Reign God won de feat is on purpose the
[55:28] one thing I pray Lord am I right when
[55:30] you come he said that's the only worry I
[55:34] have amen how have I pleased you Lord
[55:37] see don't fear What men's doing fear God
[55:41] Don't Fear him that can destroy the body
[55:43] but he that can destroy both body and
[55:46] soul in
[55:48] Hell In other words fear the lord not
[55:51] the devil that's right the devil can
[55:53] only do something to you temporary but
[55:55] God is the judge of
[56:00] all but fear tries to set
[56:05] in fear
[56:08] Comes Trouble
[56:12] Comes worry is always there but don't
[56:15] forget who's in your
[56:19] boat the Master's in the boat and he's
[56:23] the master of the wind listen it's more
[56:25] than a song We
[56:27] sing I know the master of the
[56:30] wind what's a beautiful song but it's
[56:33] more than a
[56:34] song Amen it's all wonderful to know the
[56:37] master of the wind to the wind comes and
[56:40] then you get all worried about how's how
[56:41] am I going to overcome all this stuff
[56:43] don't forget he's still the master your
[56:46] circumstances has not changed who he
[56:49] is your problems and situations around
[56:52] you does not change who God is amen
[56:55] should should should anything really
[56:57] bother us nothing should worry us we are
[57:01] his we are his if if if it ain't well
[57:04] we're false accusers we've been
[57:06] testified something ain't so but I
[57:08] believe it I believe that now we are
[57:11] sons of God not we will be right now we
[57:14] are we're seated together in Heavenly
[57:16] places in Christ
[57:19] Jesus you've been seeing it up on the
[57:21] screen I've mentioned it before about
[57:23] that dorky little sheep Walking With
[57:25] Jesus and that line that wolf over there
[57:27] growling and carrying
[57:30] on Amen I was just reading about uh uh

[57:45] Christian and he he hears about these
[57:47] two lines that was in the path and
[57:50] everybody was so afraid and so worried
[57:52] about these two lines and the closer

[57:56] cuz he's hearing the Roar and he's
[57:58] hearing the more getting more intense

[58:02] a roar of a lion as far as sit in fear I
[58:04] mean it shuts the whole jungle up we
[58:06] heard about you know that right and so
[58:08] he hears these
[58:10] Roars but as he gets closer he realized
[58:13] these lines are
[58:15] chained and the only thing that can
[58:18] actually get to him is the
[58:20] roar Hallelujah ain't that the way it is
[58:23] sometimes you realize when you were so
[58:26] worried about things and so worried
[58:27] about things if you'll just realize that
[58:30] line is
[58:31] Chained he can only go so far he can

[58:52] sick does not change who I am I'm a son
[58:55] of God if I'm down in the valley the

[59:05] we got
[59:06] Authority amen I don't may I may not
[59:08] have one bit of power but I got
[59:10] Authority amen just like that policeman

[59:29] stand out there and hold his hand up and
[59:30] Blow That Whistle watch The Brak slides
[59:33] he hasn't got one ounce of power but

[59:42] be to read your name and box car car
[59:44] siiz letters I have any education at all

[1:00:08] he that knows
[1:00:10] Jesus knows what's been given to him and
[1:00:13] where he
[1:00:15] stands amen they should have known by
[1:00:17] watching what this man did the Messiah
[1:00:20] he knew all things he knew this trouble
[1:00:22] was
[1:00:23] coming he knew the boat was about to get
[1:00:25] rocked
[1:00:26] rocked so did he also know your boat was
[1:00:29] about is about to get
[1:00:34] rocked my brother Timothy I I wish I
[1:00:37] could just have me a just a nice cool
[1:00:40] breeze on the ocean you know yeah that'd
[1:00:42] be
[1:00:44] nice but that ain't the fairy tale we're
[1:00:46] living in this ain't no fairy tale this
[1:00:49] is
[1:00:51] real a lot of
[1:00:54] battles listen you're either you're
[1:00:57] either in a trial or you just got out of
[1:00:59] a trial and you're about to go into
[1:01:01] another
[1:01:03] trial brother but trials doesn't change
[1:01:06] who you
[1:01:08] are it doesn't change who God
[1:01:15] is man I wish I had the strength to
[1:01:18] preach he knew knows all things he knows
[1:01:20] his
[1:01:23] trouble they should have known that he
[1:01:25] understood that the storm was
[1:01:28] coming and he knew it was going to
[1:01:30] happen and was only coming to test their
[1:01:38] faith he said maybe the Revival is led
[1:01:41] up to see what we'll do about it maybe
[1:01:42] sickness is struck struck you to see
[1:01:44] what you'll do about
[1:01:47] it nothing just happens without God
[1:01:50] knowing about it he knows it he knew the
[1:01:54] end he knows the end from the beginning
[1:01:56] and all these things happen because it's
[1:01:58] a test of
[1:02:02] faith how are we going to get there by
[1:02:05] all these others had to go by Faith by
[1:02:07] Faith by Faith by
[1:02:09] faith we're not going to get there just
[1:02:12] by Grace it's going to be by
[1:02:16] faith there's going to be somebody that
[1:02:18] nobody else believes they still believe
[1:02:22] when nobody else still stands they're
[1:02:23] still standing when everybody else pulls
[1:02:26] away they're still
[1:02:28] there why by
[1:02:32] faith that's what he said how the world
[1:02:35] would be said in Luke chap 21 verse 25
[1:02:38] said there would be signs and the sun
[1:02:39] and the moon and the stars and upon the
[1:02:41] Earth the stress of nations with
[1:02:44] perplexities and seas and the waves
[1:02:46] roaring man if this world ain't roaring
[1:02:49] right now I don't know what roaring
[1:02:52] is it's roaring every day a right up
[1:02:55] about
[1:02:56] nuclear
[1:02:57] destruction every
[1:03:01] day I I mean I I know there was a Cuban
[1:03:05] Missile Crisis and there was this that
[1:03:06] and there's always been trouble but
[1:03:08] we're get there's a time of trouble
[1:03:10] coming has never been seen
[1:03:13] before this world is getting ready to
[1:03:16] fall off into the
[1:03:19] tribulation so it's not going to get
[1:03:21] better it's going to get
[1:03:23] worse so we see many 's hearts are
[1:03:26] failing them for
[1:03:29] fear and for looking after those things
[1:03:32] which are coming on the earth for the
[1:03:35] powers of Heaven shall be shaken then
[1:03:37] shall they see the son of man coming in
[1:03:39] a cloud with power and great glory and
[1:03:41] when these things begin to come to pass
[1:03:44] then look up and lift up your heads for
[1:03:46] your Redemption draw it
[1:03:50] nigh amen when we see all these shakings
[1:03:53] going on these roarings going on it
[1:03:55] ought to do nothing but up make us look
[1:03:57] up because any day now the dead in
[1:04:00] Christ is going to
[1:04:02] rise any day now we're going to go home
[1:04:05] to be with Jesus any day now we're going
[1:04:07] to leave this old stinking rotten world
[1:04:10] and go to a place we've never dreamed of
[1:04:13] before eyes can't imagine our hearts
[1:04:16] can't even think good enough Amen to
[1:04:18] imagine the glory that is going to be
[1:04:20] revealed in
[1:04:24] US
[1:04:26] so don't
[1:04:28] fear quote fear is of the
[1:04:33] devil Everything Jesus would say fear
[1:04:37] not fear not constantly fear not fear
[1:04:41] not an angel when an angel would come
[1:04:43] what was a salutation fear not be Not
[1:04:48] Afraid see God doesn't want you to fear
[1:04:52] he wants you to
[1:04:54] believe every one of you believe amen
[1:04:57] one Accord everyone you know I got I
[1:04:59] just done a quick study on on on just
[1:05:01] the times mentioned in fear and there
[1:05:03] and of course there's a different
[1:05:04] translation so there's if you find other
[1:05:06] translations maybe mention more but just
[1:05:08] the uh the
[1:05:10] KJV excuse me you can see fear not is
[1:05:13] mentioned 63
[1:05:15] times Be not Afraid is 26 time be
[1:05:18] careful for nothing one time I will not
[1:05:20] fear three times Whom Shall I Fear one
[1:05:23] time I shall not be afraid two times be
[1:05:26] not dismayed four times be of good
[1:05:28] courage 16 times be strong 32 times so
[1:05:33] God over and over and over and over
[1:05:35] reiterating so there's plenty of
[1:05:37] strength together when you are fearful
[1:05:40] there's plenty somewhere you can go to
[1:05:42] that when you are afraid you can go to
[1:05:45] the word of God and say God I'm I'm
[1:05:47] fearing a little bit go to the
[1:05:54] word
[1:05:58] I read these to the young people
[1:06:02] because men's hearts are failing for
[1:06:05] fear they got fears phobias listed from
[1:06:09] A to
[1:06:11] Z so for them to be listed they actually
[1:06:14] have to be diagnosed fears medically
[1:06:16] diagnosed so then of course I got to
[1:06:20] clicking on them good Lord every one of
[1:06:22] them's got their own way to overcome
[1:06:24] them and and then most of us by either
[1:06:27] by therapist or or psychology or or or
[1:06:31] or medicine I don't want none of
[1:06:34] that there's one way to overcome A to
[1:06:41] Z so I I'll just read them to you
[1:06:44] because I I like to call these fears out

[1:07:23] pansy you got to be to be afraid of a
[1:07:25] flower

[1:10:15] to do to
[1:10:16] people they can't do normal activities
[1:10:20] without being
[1:10:21] afraid and if you're not careful he'll
[1:10:24] put you in a little box and you'll be
[1:10:26] afraid to be in your

[1:10:37] failing for

[1:11:22] the last one listed is fear of vacuum
[1:11:24] cleaning
[1:11:31] ERS but the devil wants us to get so
[1:11:35] consumed in fear why so you won't
[1:11:40] believe cuz fear actually hinders belief
[1:11:43] it's actually
[1:11:45] unbelief it actually is unbelief in what
[1:11:48] God can do for your situation and you
[1:11:51] begin to worry and you begin to fret you
[1:11:53] begin to build Bridges and before you
[1:11:55] know know you got nervous problems and a
[1:11:57] nervous stomach and you can't sleep at
[1:11:58] night why because of
[1:12:04] fear so if you're going to get over fear

[1:12:18] is we was in uh
[1:12:20] Paris sister Katie I believe she's
[1:12:23] gotten Deliverance of it
[1:12:26] but she uh as a young girl and brother
[1:12:29] brandham you know it's a very very
[1:12:31] serious thing because brother brandham
[1:12:33] actually in in in the in discernment
[1:12:35] seen this had this woman that was all
[1:12:37] nervous and tore up he said what you
[1:12:38] problem is you got scared as a little
[1:12:40] girl by a
[1:12:42] dog and fear struck
[1:12:46] her generally When people's got real
[1:12:48] issues like that real phobia is because
[1:12:50] somewhere back there back there
[1:12:52] somewhere something happened
[1:12:56] and Katie had that as a little girl with
[1:12:58] a with a rat one time and scared her to
[1:13:01] death and I ain't going to go in that
[1:13:02] store but we was we was in Paris and
[1:13:04] with our family and we went to the
[1:13:06] Eiffel tire and we went up and top and
[1:13:08] come down and and me and sister Ruth and
[1:13:10] the sister that was guid us come down
[1:13:11] the elevator the kids want to stop at
[1:13:13] the little gift store and so they did so
[1:13:15] we're sitting there and by the we' got
[1:13:17] there last minute one of the last ones
[1:13:19] to be a to go up and it closed and so
[1:13:21] we're coming down after closing and we
[1:13:23] get down to the bottom and they before
[1:13:24] they've been p PES of people everywhere
[1:13:26] and we get down the bottom there's
[1:13:27] nobody but a few guards and so we just
[1:13:29] sit on the bench waiting for the kids
[1:13:31] next thing I
[1:13:33] hear what is that I got to look and
[1:13:36] there's rats running all over this place
[1:13:40] I probably counted 10 at least just
[1:13:42] running out there Gathering the food
[1:13:43] that had been dropped and things and I
[1:13:45] ain't talking about no little rats I'm
[1:13:46] talking about some good siiz
[1:13:48] ones and I thought oh boy if Katie sees
[1:13:51] these this is not going to be good cuzz
[1:13:54] we're a long ways from there BNB and and
[1:13:56] I thought man I don't know and all a
[1:13:58] sudden I hear some holler and I look up
[1:13:59] and the kids are running down the stairs
[1:14:01] you know and here they come and they get
[1:14:03] down the bottom I hear this Blood
[1:14:04] curling
[1:14:06] scream rat done ran across front of
[1:14:08] Katie listen I had to pray her the rest
[1:14:11] of the way
[1:14:12] home with my arm around to praying for
[1:14:15] her to get her to back to the Airbnb and
[1:14:18] I trying to tell her Katie that you are
[1:14:21] bigger than that
[1:14:23] rat that rat won't hurt you that rattle
[1:14:25] run from you you you need to realize who
[1:14:28] you really are and I I I got to thinking
[1:14:30] about that when I was telling that story
[1:14:32] up there in Oklahoma you know the devil
[1:14:34] is the biggest rat I know
[1:14:36] of and he'll run across our path and
[1:14:38] we'll scream and Carry On and we got to
[1:14:41] pray our way through listen you got to
[1:14:43] realize who you really are you're not
[1:14:46] some beating down nobody you're a child
[1:14:49] of God that was chosen to be perfect
[1:14:51] before the foundation of the world and
[1:14:53] the devil wants to run in front of of
[1:14:55] you that's just a perfect time to stomp
[1:14:57] him to put your foot over him and say
[1:15:00] devil I'm not going to cow down to you
[1:15:02] no more I'm a Child of God I can rise up
[1:15:05] above these
[1:15:12] things quit shrieking back in
[1:15:15] fear and realize who you are yeah just
[1:15:18] like that man brother Bram talks about
[1:15:20] when that devil started going boo and he
[1:15:22] started jumping back every time you jump
[1:15:24] back you get smaller your faith gets
[1:15:26] smaller everything about you get you
[1:15:29] just get all withered up inside of
[1:15:31] yourself you can't fight but he said all
[1:15:33] of at once he came back to something and
[1:15:35] he hit the word of God and he grabbed a
[1:15:38] hold of it and something went over him
[1:15:40] and he hollered boo back and when he did
[1:15:44] the devil got smaller and he got
[1:15:47] bigger it's time some of you start using
[1:15:50] faith on the word of God over your fear
[1:15:53] that's right cuz I'm here to tell you
[1:15:56] there's a whole lot more we listen to a
[1:15:58] whole lot of fears but there's a whole
[1:16:00] lot more faith than there is
[1:16:03] fear there's a whole lot more peace than
[1:16:06] there is
[1:16:07] anxiety there's a whole lot more joy
[1:16:09] than there is
[1:16:16] depression Deuteronomy 3 Verse 18 said I
[1:16:19] commanded you at that time say the Lord
[1:16:21] your God have given you this land to
[1:16:24] possess it
[1:16:25] and you shall pass over armed before
[1:16:27] your brethren the children of Israel all
[1:16:29] that are meat for war but your wives and
[1:16:32] your little ones your cattle and for I
[1:16:34] know that you have much cattle shall
[1:16:35] abide in your cities which I've given
[1:16:37] you unto the Lord has given you rest
[1:16:38] unto your brethren as well as unto you
[1:16:40] and the and until they also possess the
[1:16:43] land which the Lord your God has given
[1:16:45] them Beyond Jordan then you shall return
[1:16:47] every man into his possession which I've
[1:16:49] given you and I commanded Joshua at that
[1:16:52] time saying thine eyes have seen all all
[1:16:55] that the Lord your God has done to these
[1:16:57] two kings so shall the Lord do to all
[1:17:00] the kingdoms whether thou passest ye
[1:17:03] shall not fear them for the Lord your
[1:17:05] God shall fight for
[1:17:08] you hallelujah what is he telling him
[1:17:11] I've done it for against two of them and
[1:17:13] the rest of them is going to be the same
[1:17:16] way Hallelujah if he's given you one
[1:17:19] Victory he can give you another Victory
[1:17:21] if he's giving you victory over things
[1:17:23] of sin and graphy well surely he can
[1:17:26] give you victory over that Hellbound
[1:17:29] Spirit called
[1:17:33] fear the Lord will fight for you second
[1:17:37] and de Deuteronomy 31:6 be strong and of
[1:17:40] good courage do not fear nor be afraid
[1:17:43] of them for the Lord your God he is the
[1:17:45] one that goes with you he will not leave
[1:17:48] you or forsake
[1:17:50] you Psalms 34:4 said I sought the Lord
[1:17:54] and he heard me and he delivered me from
[1:17:57] all my
[1:17:59] fears choosing Faith over fear is a
[1:18:03] decision you must make it's seeking the
[1:18:06] Lord knowing he hears and trusting him
[1:18:09] knowing he will
[1:18:12] deliver sometimes we forget he
[1:18:16] helps we forget he's the deliverer we're
[1:18:21] in the middle of our deal trying to
[1:18:22] wrestle it all out trying to save
[1:18:24] ourselves
[1:18:25] and all along God is waiting and ready
[1:18:27] to hear our
[1:18:30] cry Psalms 56 and verse three says
[1:18:33] whenever I am afraid I will trust in
[1:18:39] you choosing faith is just choosing to
[1:18:42] trust God no matter
[1:18:47] what it's not that everything will be
[1:18:50] perfect and everything's going to be a
[1:18:51] bed of roses and everything's going to
[1:18:53] work out just great
[1:18:55] but in the moment of fear we should know
[1:18:58] by now where to turn
[1:19:00] to it's not to Google it's not to a
[1:19:03] three-step process or book or even a
[1:19:06] good friend it's turned to Jesus yes
[1:19:10] sir it's knowing that when we're
[1:19:13] afraid to turn to
[1:19:16] Jesus because he's the one who can
[1:19:19] calm our anxious
[1:19:21] Hearts we read in Psalm chapter 23 vers
[1:19:24] verse four yeay though I walk through
[1:19:26] the valley of the shadow of death I'll
[1:19:28] fear no evil for you are with me your
[1:19:31] rod and your staff they comfort me
[1:19:33] sometimes we Face the hardest the
[1:19:35] darkest the scariest of all trials it
[1:19:38] might look like sudden tragedy or maybe
[1:19:41] a diagnosis we we wasn't expecting or
[1:19:43] some family crisis we didn't see coming
[1:19:45] but even in the darkest of times God is
[1:19:48] still able to guard you and to carry you
[1:19:51] through amen when you feel like God is
[1:19:54] absent like he doesn't want seem to care
[1:19:56] we can rest in the faith and the rest in
[1:19:59] faith in the truth of the word that even
[1:20:01] then even in the dark even in the shadow
[1:20:05] of death God is
[1:20:10] there he's
[1:20:12] near ready for you to reach out and grab
[1:20:15] his
[1:20:16] hand he's not so far you can't reach
[1:20:19] there he's not so far from you I may
[1:20:21] seem that way but that doesn't mean
[1:20:23] that's so
[1:20:27] he's as close as your faith will declare
[1:20:33] him Isaiah 41 and verse 10 says fear not
[1:20:37] for I am with you be not dismayed for I
[1:20:41] am your God I will strengthen you yes I
[1:20:44] will help
[1:20:45] you I will uphold you with my righteous
[1:20:49] right
[1:20:51] hand God's hand is a beautiful thing in
[1:20:54] Scripture because it it's speaking of
[1:20:57] strength so when we talk about you know
[1:20:59] having faith in God and God's hand in
[1:21:01] each
[1:21:04] situation there's an instruction the
[1:21:06] scripture is talking about that and
[1:21:07] there's an instruction given when you
[1:21:09] see his hand don't fear it's easy to say
[1:21:13] but many times difficult to to live fear
[1:21:15] not but over and over God's word says
[1:21:18] fear not the question we might have is
[1:21:21] how do we fear not when everything
[1:21:23] around us
[1:21:25] is calling for questions and calling for
[1:21:28] fear the answers is found in focus in
[1:21:31] our hearts not on what we see but upon
[1:21:35] the God on the word of God and his
[1:21:38] promises that there is more for us than
[1:21:42] there is against
[1:21:44] us God is with us God gives strength God
[1:21:47] gives help god holds us God hand is not
[1:21:51] clench close sin if we're going to
[1:21:53] survive
[1:21:57] his hand is stretched out and is
[1:21:59] actually picking you up and holding you
[1:22:02] up and making sure you're going to make
[1:22:06] it he's not standing back I'm I'm not
[1:22:09] going nope I ain't helping this time
[1:22:10] nope nope nope no his hand is there
[1:22:12] under you and it's guiding you why he
[1:22:15] wants to make sure you're going to make
[1:22:16] it that's right cuz he knows if his hand
[1:22:19] wasn't there you wouldn't make it but
[1:22:22] he'll hold you in the middle of of your
[1:22:24] storm in the middle of your trial in the
[1:22:27] middle of your struggle that hand is
[1:22:29] there propping you
[1:22:32] up Isaiah 41:13 says for I the Lord your
[1:22:35] God will hold your right hand say unto
[1:22:38] you fear not I will help
[1:22:41] you just like a child needs help by a
[1:22:45] hand across the
[1:22:47] street God reaches down his hand to help
[1:22:50] us cross the most difficult Paths of Our
[1:22:53] Lives
[1:22:56] not only
[1:23:03] that did you hear what the see what the
[1:23:05] scripture says for I the Lord thy God
[1:23:08] will hold thy right hand he said give me
[1:23:10] your hand and while you're Crossing that
[1:23:13] road he's saying fear
[1:23:17] not I'm helping
[1:23:19] you you're going to make
[1:23:22] it you're going to make it to this
[1:23:25] Valley you're going to make it through
[1:23:27] this
[1:23:28] struggle you're going to make it through
[1:23:30] this difficulty cuz I got
[1:23:34] you he isn't silent his lips ain't
[1:23:38] closed never given advice never never
[1:23:41] giving you wisdom never but he gives a
[1:23:43] command fear
[1:23:47] not then that fear not is followed by
[1:23:50] one of the most beautiful
[1:23:52] promises I will help
[1:23:57] you I mean we know what it's like when
[1:24:00] somebody says I'll help
[1:24:02] you struggling getting something done
[1:24:05] some trying to make ends meet sub
[1:24:08] whatever I'll help you but what is it
[1:24:10] when God
[1:24:12] says I'll help
[1:24:15] you I got you I got this I'll take care
[1:24:19] of
[1:24:22] it Zephaniah 3 and verse 17 says the
[1:24:25] Lord your God is in your midst and he's
[1:24:28] a Victorious
[1:24:30] Warrior he will exalt over you with joy
[1:24:33] he will be he will be quiet in his love
[1:24:35] he will rejoice over you with shouts of
[1:24:37] Joy Psalms 91:1 says he who dwells in
[1:24:40] the shelter of the most high shall rest
[1:24:42] in the shadow of the Almighty I will say
[1:24:44] of the Lord he's my refuge and my
[1:24:46] Fortress my God in whom I trust he will
[1:24:49] cover you with his feathers under his
[1:24:52] wings you will find Refuge his
[1:24:54] faithfulness will be your Shield you
[1:24:57] will not fear the terror by night nor
[1:24:59] the air that flies by day nor the
[1:25:00] pestilence that stalks in the darkness
[1:25:02] or the plague that destroys at midday a
[1:25:04] thousand may fall by your side and
[1:25:06] 10,000 by your right hand but it will
[1:25:08] not come near you for he has commanded
[1:25:11] his angels concerning
[1:25:15] you to guard you in all your ways
[1:25:18] because he loves me sayeth the Lord I
[1:25:20] will rescue him I will protect him for

[1:25:27] him and I'll be with him in trouble and
[1:25:29] I will deliver him and honor
