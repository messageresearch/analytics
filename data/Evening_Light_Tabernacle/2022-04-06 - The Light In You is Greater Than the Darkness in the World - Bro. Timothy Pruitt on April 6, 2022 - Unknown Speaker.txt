lord even this evening facing tornadoes again i had them this morning when you assess your protection around your people lord god we just ask that you would move lord and your bride all over the world father just the miraculous out break out lord in our midst lord to show you're still the same yesterday today and forever lord we commit our hearts to you we commit our lives to you we thank you for this time together in jesus name amen amen let's turn to zechariah 14 and verse 6. amen it's always good to be in the house of the lord amen we're coming up very quickly just a week away from leaving to go down to prepare for the youth camp that'll be starting on thursday so just keep that in your prayers it's kind of a almost a reboot for us because there's a lot of things that are different but we're looking forward to a wonderful time in the lord and uh yeah that wins next wednesday night there will not be service here nor the following sunday so it'll be down there at the youth camp in dry creek in louisiana amen zechariah 14 and verse 6 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but that's but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not a day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light amen we'll let you be seated amen i'd like to speak to you on the light that is in you is greater than the darkness that's in the world amen how many believes that today amen as we've been speaking about light we know that light is always greater than darkness darkness is never greater than light it don't i mean darkness can come together it can try to put out light but if you could just strike a match or even the weakest light it'll draw it'll push back the darkness but i thought it was very wonderful and this is scripture that we're very familiar here with this church because of our our church being named even in light tabernacle uh it was done for a purpose because i believe that we are to be a light in the community that we're in and and you know uh but it the scripture as it says it it shall be light it shall be light this is not a maybe or a might be or a hope fully will be or maybe it'll work out or possibly but it is a confirmation it's an assurity it's a promise it shall be light that no matter how dark it may get no matter how dreary it may be no matter how how whatever may happen he said it was going to be that that kind of day it'd be a day of darkness should be a day of dreariness a day that many people could not see a day that many would grope in darkness someday that you know they would there would be a lot of problems upon the earth and situations but it shall be light this is actually the same the same words and the same things as let there be light amen that god would speak it and now today we witness the promise being fulfilled although when he spoke it it may have laid for millions of years thousands of years may it happen in just a moment i don't know but that word no matter how long it took as far as time because god he didn't care about time he's not a time being but as far as the way we compute know however however long that it took it did not matter what mattered is there's a sun today there's stars today there's a word that's been fulfilled and you know just as the promise and this this is also a promise that our seed that is laying in darkness there's going to be a light to bring it forth amen that we won't remain in darkness because you know the seed goes into the ground and and it lays there in dark times and dark places amen and it takes the sun to pull it and so it's speaking of a light that's going to pull you out of darkness it's going to pull you out of the things that you're laying in just as the promises of deliverance of a savior laid in scripture and seem you know they would never come to life the word had laid dormant for thousands of years seemed like but all of a sudden the light shone upon it and it came forth and he came forth as a from a virgin amen and a virgin born body and he he came to live he came to defeat satan he he came to die but he also came to rise again so that his power could be transferred not just in one body but in many bodies that not only he could have the light but he would also share the light because he wanted more than one candle he wanted one more than one light bulb he wanted more than one beam of light he wanted many rays of light he wanted god moving in every facet of every part of the world amen he couldn't do that in one body so what did he do he went down and he went he died he went to hell he rose again so that his life could be transferred to other bodies so those bodies could go into that light can be transferred into 120 that was there on in the day of pentecost and they could go to this site over here and they could go over there they could go to this country and the gospel would begin to spread and the light will begin to shine in all the corners of the earth and that's why he could say i will have a bride without spot without wrinkle i'll have a people out of every kindred out of every tongue out of every nation out of every people amen because he knew that that light was going to go forth and no matter what country it came to no matter what government it can't come on somebody no matter what problems arose you could put the red curtains you could put the communist curtain you can put the bamboo curtain you can put the iron curtain you can put whatever curtain you want to put up god's word god's light was going to go through it it was going to get to that seed that laid there upon the earth amen so that seed can come forth see he came to redeem he came to bring life to these predestinated seas that god had seen before the foundation of the world and he wrote their names in the book of life i'm thankful that i've already been seen of all my name's already been written down and and so he knew he had seeds laying in this great darkness that we're living in he knew in the darkest times in the darkest places and the darkest corners of the earth there would be a seed there and somehow light was going to have to get there for that seed to come forth so light would have to go into a body of flesh and be carried and be moved into places on ships or in airplanes through books however it went light was being transferred so it could go to every seed that is laying there because every seed that's written on the lamb's book of life will come up there shall be light in the evening time amen so every seed no matter how dark it may seem no matter how many obstacles there are no matter how terrible the government is no matter how hard they try to push it down and keep it down that seed if it's laying inside of there whether it be in russia north korea south korea japan and the furthest parts of the earth that light is going to find that sea because that seed must come forth amen so the devil can try everything he wants to he can try to put every kind of sin on it he can try to cover it up he can try to put it in the worst muck he can make it so deep and so dark and so impossible but when that light begins to shine it's calling forth the life of that seed and that seed will come up so he came but brother was saying like this he said he came not only to be the blessing he came to share the blessing hallelujah he came not only to be the light he came to share the light he not only come amen to be the blessing he came to share the blessing with every predestinated seed how many predestinated seeds we got here tonight amen so he came to share his blessing with you he said now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live so it had to be on the earth and be germatized no matter how long it's kept in darkness no matter how bad it seems when the s-o-n begins to shine on it it'll come up he came to share it with us he came to share his life with us he came to share his light with us amen whatever was in that life every blessing that was in that life he came to share it with us that's why we can declare he's a healer tonight because he came to share i'm a healer amen hey he came to share his power he came to share his healing he came to share his deliverance he came to share it all he didn't keep it in one body in one light bulb and one source but no he put it in many bodies hallelujah he came to share it amen and the sun has rose upon our life amen declaring the good news amen in the world it may not be nothing but bad news but tonight turn your eyes away from all of that we have some good news tonight hallelujah you come to the right place you come not to get bad news you came to get good news now there's going to be some bad news it's bad news for the devil but there's good news for you tonight god has come to share his blessings with you god has come to share his life with you that you could also be the light you know the gospel is the good news amen the very word gospel means good news is that what you came for tonight did you come for some good news good you come from to the right place a man died for you that means you don't have to die that's good news amen amen he said never was there any news like this news who made the promise has now also confirmed the promise and he's now alive forevermore and he has the keys to death hell and it's in his hands man that's some good news tonight death in hell does not even have their own keys in other words death don't have a key to hold you no more hell don't have a key to hold you no more amen he tried to hold you try to put every kind of sin on your life everything upon you and try to pour it on top of you and keep you down but hell lost his king it lost his ability to hold you it can't no longer lock the door on a predestinated sea it can no longer lock the door amen he said he's alive forevermore therefore all gloom is shook away hello somebody did you come through me tonight all gloom is shook away maybe you're gloomy because you're looking at the wrong thing look to the s-o-n tonight amen all gloom is shook away there's no gloom to be seen anymore for the sun is up amen there was no well he will come or he may come he's already come and the gospel is declared the light is up the light is shining the sun is up amen if the sun is up that means we're free if he's a if he's risen from the dead how many believes he's risen from the dead then every power that he claimed to have is now in force every promise that he has is now in force he could claim to be somebody but unless that happened he could be just like no other just some other man but that i i mean just we could be no more than mohammedans or something like that that's waiting for him to rise up and go get on a horse we ain't waiting for him to rise up he's already rose up we're waiting for him to come in power he's already in power we're waiting for him to heal he's already healing we're waiting for him to deliver and he's already doing that amen the sun is up the gospel is declaring he is here the light is dawning upon there shall be light there is darkness but there shall be light there is trouble but there shall be light there is sickness but there shall be light there is sin but there shall be light there is problems there there shall be light amen amen the very message of the gospel is proven to a people that he has risen go tell my disciples he would say go tell my disciples i'm risen from the dead and i'll meet with him he said oh how and brother brother brother branham he said oh how in this last days there shall be light again across the earth he's going to prove again i am risen i am the living christ take this message to my disciples i'm risen from the dead the gospel the good news so that is the gospel we're not serving a dead creed or a dead dogma or some light from 50 years ago or a hundred years ago we are serving a living god right now that's able to be touched by the feelings of our infirmities amen that's where god wants you to put him at is right now not tomorrow not yesterday not another problem or another situation but this moment and this time i need him right now and if i need him he's here for me he's here to touch me he's in a minister to me he's here to lift me up it's the good news light is shining hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever we are his beneficiaries are to prove his life now our bill if we are his beneficiaries we're to prove his life is now in us or his light is now in us this life there was never a life lived like it he was the son of god he died but he rose again and this morning we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring the same good news he's risen he's alive he's living we are not serving a dead god fort has written the gospel amen he said let me back up he said how can we do it by word only he said for it's written the gospel came not by word only but through power and manifestation of the holy spirit to prove he's alive listen he had the word he said he said i if you if you uh if you destroy this temple in three days i'll raise it up but that was word only until he rose up you understand what i'm saying amen there had to be a manifestation of what he said amen listen we're looking for more than just word only he'll have a bride without spot without wrinkle all those who that don't sleep they'll be changed that's that's word only but we're looking for the manifestation of that amen for the fulfillment of that you can have the word you can have the word you can have the word but we also got to have the manifestation or the fulfillment of the word or other words it's just a bulb there but the light has to come on amen amen the gospel came not by word only but through the power of the of the holy ghost he said because i live ye live also and i live in you therefore if i live in you the works that i do shall ye do also what a message is there anybody here on a wednesday night all right oh what a message no wonder he said we had a dark world of theology and creeds and dominance but in the evening time there shall be light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time hallelujah it shall be light in the evening time so god is not surprised by the climate that we're living in and the situations that we're facing and the political unrest and all the things that's been going on for the last couple of years god's not about you might be surprised but god's not surprised by it he knew it would be there but he said there shall be light so the devil can how the devil can blow he can say i'm going to blow it in with my my chinny chin chin i'm going to do everything i can to put out the bride's life he'll never put it out he can't put it out because there's a word that said that resists him that stands between you and the devil there shall be light why don't you look at that devil tonight and say devil you can't put me out because i'm my light is not coming from you the power that's on the inside of me is coming from a greater source hallelujah and you can howl you can blow you can do whatever you want to there shall be light the very essence of the message that was sent he's risen from the dead this is the message in this hour he's risen from the dead but don't miss it it's not 2 000 years ago it's now the light is up again the light is shining again the word and its power and its fullness is working in human flesh again come on somebody we don't want to put it 2 000 years ago or even 50 years ago we want him right now he's up again he's moving in a pride he's healing the sick he's saving the laws he's raising the dead he's healing cancer he's rebuking darkness he's calming the seas he's moving just like he did 2 000 years ago he has to to be the same light amen brother brown would say it like this he said but i'm afraid too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a theory or we're getting them to a church but we must get them to christ they must be connected to the source to be able to light up he's the only one that can light up their lives that can put that light in them like you did on the day of pentecost 120 lights were dispersed pillar of fire over every one of them lights entered into human bodies amen to push back darkness and they have to be the same way today and he said if the blood of a man was a certain type and he took the blood from another man and changed the blood of another he would absolutely be that same type of blood he said if your spirit that's in you is wrecking dead and you're anointed with the life that was in christ amen it's the same spirit that raised him up from the dead will also quicken your body and if it quickens your body that same life those same powers those same beneficiaries that he had here on earth from god when he redeemed you now you have them this is shouting stuff right here okay you have them not somebody coming listen we're not living in luther's day and there's somebody still coming we are them we are there we are it shall be light we are the light that's in the moment pushing back the devil's darkness and we're going to push it back so hard until we break into that eternal day there's not another them coming you are them the gospel light of the resurrection the confirmation of the word how do we know he was cry he was the christ because he proved what he talked about how do i know the message of the hour god proves what he promises and what he talks about he proves it that's the identification we are the beneficiaries of the resurrection he proves what he talks about amen what he promised to do in christ he proved it on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of moses he proved it what he promised to do in the days of enoch he proved it in the days of the apostles he proved it why would your day be any different why would it be any different than you get here and he can't prove it no more he's proved it every time he'll prove it in your time he's proved it every moment he'll prove it in your moment in your moment of trial and your moment of temptation and your moment of sickness he'll prove i am god on easter morning not only did this light raise but his event his beneficiaries raised with him we were in christ at the crucifixion we were in him on the resurrection we are his beneficiaries quickened after being dead in darkness the darkened world of unbelief and churches and nominations so forth had drawn us out and there's but there was something in his calling oh we want god we're hungry with thurston so we joined this one we joined that we joined this we're looking what was you doing he was looking for light he was looking for life and all of a sudden while you were groping in darkness the great resurrection came to you in the manifestation of the promised word of god like he was manifested the manifested promise of god i will not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer for my holy one to see corruption he manifested just like he manifested in you he said i'll not leave them in that earth i'm not leaving them in that darkness i'm not leaving them in that situation i'm not leaving them in that sin i'll not leave them in that problem i'm not leaving in those drugs i'm not leaving them in their dirty habits i'm not leave them in that pornography i'll not leave them there but i've got a sun a power that's greater than the darkness and i'm gonna pull them out hallelujah and you're walking along and all of a sudden you feel a pull and it starts turning you and it starts pulling you and it's pulling you another way hallelujah and let me tell you something this light is not getting dimmer it's getting stronger and stronger and stronger i want you to understand what i'm saying the light that's pulling up on the sea life on the inside of you it's pulling you to a harvest understand the light level to see it's getting dimmer and dimmer but the light upon the sea is getting stronger and stronger and stronger hallelujah is pulling you out of the ground it's pulling you through all the stages it pulled you through justification and sanctification and it pulled you into the baptism of the holy ghost but this light is getting stronger and it's about to pull a group of people off the face of this earth into another dimension into another world it shall be light [Applause] i'm not leaving them we're once groping in darkness and wandering around wondering if they should wash feet on a certain day or keep a certain set of rules or do a certain thing but there was a glorious resurrection that defied every man-made thing that man had ever done every man made reason there had never been a time to that time a man could lay his life down and pick it up again he defied the scientific proof they had by raising again and when they saw that jesus christ when they say when they say jesus christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever or his power isn't the same or his gospel isn't the same when the bible says it's the same amen god defied every denomination every creed and he moved forth with his holy spirit as he promised and he's proved to us once again he is alive the light is still shining and we are benefactors of that resurrection quickened after being dead in the world and sins and trespasses has quickened us together in him in christ jesus his spirit brings his same life again on the earth if the spirit of god that raised up christ that body that anointed body the spirit of god anointed that body in such a way that the seed fell on the earth he wouldn't just let him rest there he quickened him and raised him up that same spirit by the same works by the same power by the same signs being you it'll also raise you up hallelujah hallelujah we ain't got to worry about death there's a power greater than death well i lost my loved one to the grave well there's a power greater than that grave there's a power that's going to make graves in the gardens it's going to open them up and they're going to come forth as little as out of the darkness amen into a new body again amen hallelujah amen you know as we know he was a he was a wave sheath that was way before the people don't got time to get into all of that but he's a wave sheath you've been taught that he was brought up before the people amen waved as the first one to come to maturity and it was weighed but why do they wave that yeah amen there's more to come to be continued to continue i'm not the only one that's going to shine devil you ain't the only one you got to deal with hallelujah i'm not the only one that's going to cast you out i'm not the only one that's going to walk over you i'm not the only one that's going to cast you into the fire i'm not the only one that's going to cast you into the sea i'm not the only one there's more lights coming just like this large it has the same power the same benefits the same glory the same honor it'll shine so bright it'll rebuke cancer and it'll leave it'll shine so bright it'll rebuke sin and it'll have to go it'll shine so bright sickness will have to fall off cigarettes will fall off drunkenness come on somebody [Applause] hallelujah we know it was waved on not not on the sabbath but on the seventh day but on the first day

are his seeds that the first of the seeds of those who slept waved up on the first day of the week on the sunday s-o-n he raised up waved goodbye and ascended upon high in the presence of god oh my boy i'm about to have myself a running fit because i'm getting ready for my waving goodbye part amen when we ascend and we move out of here and we move into the air to go to meet him and all of our

but he ain't the only one there's more coming he was the first one up but there's a caring prayer that's got to come up and there's there's the loved ones all down to the ages that's going to come up he was one but he ain't the only one hallelujah and we're all going to join together and have a goodbye ceremony while this world tumbles over into complete utter darkness because the light is no longer there first corn of god's weed had been raised from the dead god's first corn of wheat by god's quickening power god had quickened his life raised him up from the dead he was the first fruits of those that slept that's why they had to waive that sheaf for is the first one to come to maturity it was waived as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing and saying the rest of them will come there shall be light so he took that scripture and he just waves it there shall be light and he weighs it right in the face of the devil i said it right here devil right there in zechariah go look it up for yourself there shall be light and ain't nothing you can do about it you can huff and you can blow but i want you to know this house is built more than wood and straw and bricks this house has been built by the power of the holy ghost and you come against it once and lost you come again you're going to lose every time today because he's the first son of god to come to full maturity he was plucked up from the earth and waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he'd been tight many times many times with the bible but now he's the first he was waved on the day of pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a wave in mighty rushing wind he was waved over the people the pentecostal people that was up there at pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and it'll be waved again in the evening time it shall be light because as waved as the first one to come the seed went into the ground and the seed goes through all the process of the seed the blade the sugar all the way up to being seed again there shall be light so there's going to be another harvest just like he was another people just like he is christ was the first one to raise up of all the prophets although tight many places he was the first fruits of those that slept and the bride coming to christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days a waving of the sheaf we've seen it we saw him amen the son of man waved before the people he's here again doing the same sign same wonder same everything same light just listen again brother branham talking about the light there in houston and all the things that took place and how the he you know didn't wouldn't want to argue and brother bosworth being a real soldier just said hey i can't take this somebody got to say something he said well you just don't argue i don't argue he walks up there with one at one question and the man couldn't answer his one question one question he starts fussing and i you didn't even answer me one question brandon was sitting up in the back and his wife his brother just said hey you stay here so i'm not going nowhere but he said all of a sudden he felt that presence began to whirl he said go up there and he goes up there and he begins to talk begins to speak say a few things but bosworth made i believe was made a good point about it you know you're you call yourself a uh you know you you you preach the gospel to save soul do you call yourself a divine savior well neither does brother branham call himself a divine healer but the man wasn't there for the truth he was there only to argue he wasn't there for light he was there for darkness brother branham comes up the man begins to take pictures and things and all of a sudden a light shone they took that picture went back and all the pictures of that man i believe he had him brother bosworth's face of his finger in his face shaking it i think about five or six pictures none of them none of them came up every one of them turned out blank there was only one picture that came out and that was that light hanging over that man's head listen the picture is not about the man the picture's about the light but it's very important that that light seem fit to have his picture with that man and here he is and i thought god how many pictures the devil's trying to take of us and he tried to take him and if us in this situation us in that situation us in this situation all of a sudden a light comes down changes us and he took a picture and he goes back to his laboratory he's like oh i got proof what he what i got proof of who he is i got proof of all kinds of stuff i got proof he smoked i got proof he drank i got proof he went out with women i got proof i got proof i got where's my proof where's my proof none of them's come out no i'm showing none of them's there there's nothing but this light there's nothing but a picture of lives hallelujah you ain't got to worry about what the devil's got proof on you god's got an answer for his proof it's called the blood of jesus it'll turn every picture dark it'll turn it all away he'll never find it it's all been erased but there will be a picture a light that is shining upon you and saying son you don't belong there daughter you don't belong there come up hither get out of that darkness get out of that situation and come to the light it's a very important picture to me waving to the chief he waved over the time over the people and he said for the first time they'll come forth for the bright age for uh for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back in its full power not quarter power half power three quarter power full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because i live ye live also speaking to his wife because i live ye live also what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is hallelujah to be quaking from the dead to me being alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was way back on the day of pentecost and the word was made manifest in bodies brother branham would go into the dynamics and the mechanics it's a good study go study it he always preached got to have the mechanics but you got to have the dynamics matter of fact he would say even this message says we have we have kind of set down on the mechanics and not enough on the dynamics he said it takes both it takes the spark it takes the movement of the spirit it takes it all it takes the word work and it takes every bit of it amen for the power to be there you can have a positive and not have the negative and you ain't got no light you can have a negative and not no positive you don't have any light you have to have both of them working together amen so if you find a church that believes only the new testament don't believe the old you don't have any light if you find one vice versa you don't have any light it takes both of them working together because the jehovah of the old is the jesus of the new amen amen so it takes everything working to bring forth life and to bring forth light not just light but light in full power it'll make the car go down the road the dynamics of the holy ghost moving on the people amen he would go into other places it said i've been seeing churches churches bride bride churches bride brought but there's got to come one there's got to come a real bride that there must be one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics that makes the church live to move in the power of his resurrection until we come that place until we come to that moment what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give it a facelift for or simonize or wax job when there's no dynamics in it when there's no moving no spark no no lighting of the candle nothing taking place what's the use in it what he proved what easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was also the dynamics he made that body that dynamic power the holy ghost made that body of jesus cold stiff and dead in the grave shake the life and rise again and roll away the stone and say i am he that was dead but i'm alive forevermore all nature had said that star said moon said it but now the whole world has to recognize he's alive again he's not only the mechanics god's word he's also the dynamics he's also the power moving in the church power of his father he said the bride amen he said be in the he be in the groom the bride has come got to come forth it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all revelations of any other has spoken of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride hello somebody if it has some revelation different than what the groom has it isn't the bride it might be foolish virgin it might be lost but it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh she's born of his bone she's life of his life she's power of his power she is him and as a man and woman or one a man a woman taken from his side she was taking taking the spirit of the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him put together makes both mechanics and dynamics until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics the spirit of god that moved him to do things like he did if he hit on all 16 cylinders so will the bride if he healed the sick so will a bride if we're lost we're saved in his ministry so will the lost be saved in the bride's ministry if the blind were healed and the lame would walk so will it happen in the bride if it ain't it's another body let's go on down really quick first john 4 first one beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye that the spirit you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is god come in the flesh power manifestations things that happen moved spirit of god moving come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you've heard that it should come and even now already it is is it in the world ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world hallelujah so this light that's in you is greater than the darkness that's in the world hallelujah we've we saw it to be so amen sister sister ruth that that darkness of cancer that light that's on the inside of you is greater than that darkness of cancer we've already seen it in sister atlanta we've already seen in multiple other ones that light is greater that red light is more powerful do we have believers here that light is more powerful we've seen that light brother brandon will say now he's here he said do you not see that light hanging right over there and it would begin to discern the hearts and tell them well you got this sickness or that sickness and that light will show itself to be greater that light what was that light there for it was trying to draw that faith he was trying to make a connection and if it didn't make a connection the light moved on the light is looking for faith it has to have a connection there has to be light to light there has to be light to light that is what your faith is your faith is not darkness your faith is light and when that pulsation of light begins to go off it all of a sudden there's a receiving station on the inside and you realize hey i'm not here by myself there's another presence here and faith begins to rise you know what this is a wednesday night but i felt the presence of god move by and tonight's my night tonight's tonight i'm going to receive something for god what happens pulsation starts taking off hallelujah amen the doctors may only give certain percentages on things for you to survive are you to do that but what the doctor doesn't put into that equation is the light you put the light into that equation that light is greater than anything the doctor says it's greater than anything the devil says is greater than anything that you're dealing with in your body the god of this world is not as great as the god of our heaven which is in you how many's got the holy ghost which is in you no more than darkness can stand against light that devil cannot stand against that god darkness cannot stand in the presence of light i don't care how dark it is light will put it out it can't stand but if you take as much darkness as you want to you can take as many of them as you want to many cells of darkness as you want to i don't care how dark it is the one that's in you is light and it's not just a little fizzle here to fizzle there it's a great eternal light it don't ever dim it's a constant burn it's a constant thing you don't ever have to worry about are the batteries going to run out am i going to get almost there and then the power's gone is the bride gonna almost make it there and then it's just gonna you ever ever use a flashlight you're just shining in the darkness and you're enjoying the light all of a sudden they're gonna start please come on and you take the batteries out and flip them upside down put them back in try you ain't gonna worry about that with this light this light will be even in you and with you with you and even in you to the end he don't have no fine print he don't have no clauses let me tell you what kind of causes he says i'm the lord god that heals all my diseases i'm the lord god that he that all of your iniquities and all of your diseases that's his kind of clause amen he said i don't care how dark it is light will put it out you can take as much darkness you want to try to stand against light one time see what happens the one that's in you is light and the one that's in the world is darkness so the light has proved it has overcome the darkness and the man that's in christ knows that he has overcome the things of this world it has no more ties to you you are free you're walking in the light as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ has cleansed us from all sin and we have fellowship one with another there you are he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world now if you look back and you look back that away you're condemned you're still in the world but if you're living above that he that's in you is greater than he that's in the darkness i've said this before i ain't scared of the dark i'm scared of the things in the dark but in this situation if he's in you you ain't got to be scared of the darkness nor what's in the dark hallelujah because he's above the darkness of the muddy waters he's above the darkness of sickness he's above the darkness of sin and situations he's above the darkness of trials and so he's oh i feel like a shouting christian what what what was in there by god at the beginning it pressed its way through overcome talking about the lily now it overcome it overcome the shell it overcome the mud it overcome the waters it overcome everything it was an overcomer and it reflected the beauty and glory of almighty god that's the way every believer does it overcomes a shell it what's the shell you're human flesh amen that wants to hold you back with your anxieties and your complexes it'll overcome all of that it overcomes the mud that the devil try to pile on you it overcomes the stormy waters and light is pulling it out of that darkness he says the way ever believers would do this way no it did lot did that's the way moses did joseph joshua did daniel did chad write me shaq and i bet no go did john the baptist did zacharias elizabeth simon anna simeon peter james john martin luther wesley pentecostal fathers paul william branham it's proved it over and over it proved over and over the light is greater than the darkness in the darkest what they call the the medieval times or the the what's the name i'm looking for the dark times dark ages there we are dark ages where they would actually take little babies rip them out of their mom and dash them against the stone that light was greater you're looking at me like an ox looking at a new gate it was greater they could stand it the light that was given them that ox anointing that fell on them that light for their age was greater it proved it it was powerful it was so powerful that they could stand there and look at those atrocities and would not deny they could see the fire coming up on the as they went up the logs and things had put against them and and they would not and they could phillips start burning their legs and it would not it'd come on up into their bodies and they would not he would consume their whole body and they would not deny that's how powerful that light shone in that dark age under the ox anointing amen it went all the way through the ages don't you know that the light is the way it we're back again to what it was in the beginning that the light that is shining now is powerful enough if it held them through what they went through it'll surely hold you through what you're going through somebody said this other day is a joke but listen you think you're going you're having a bad day and leo to sick oh go read the fox's book of martyrs and you see them men and women that stood the challenges of the darkness of their age why because of a great light it was greater than the darkness and do you think he's going to allow you to get to this age as darkest age spiritually so dark that the light ain't going to be great enough the lighting will be big enough that it can't take a teenager and lift them up out of the darkness area and make them shine before others he'll do it every time the devil's a howl the devil's a blow the devils are trying to stomp it out put it out well bye and i tell you what they got something over there at that camp in oklahoma by easter i'm gonna have them out but they're still shining well let's get a few more devils let's bring them on we got one week left and they're still shining because you don't realize this ain't a temporary light and this ain't a light that he can do anything with this ain't a light he can stop this ain't a fire he can put out this is a fire that's been come off the coals of the altar that's fell upon a body and it lit them amen with eternal life and eternal life there ain't nothing the devil can do about it we can have 10 more easters and they'll still be shining we can have 20 more years and they'll still be shining why it's a light that won't go out [Applause] there's a light that's greater than the darkness jesus showed what power that was in him when he come up out of that water and went up to be tempted of the devil he showed you what that light can do 40 days he was tempted come against him three times and every time he stood it was showing that light is greater than the darkness that light is greater than satan's options i kind of let that one sink a little bit that light is greater than satan's options that light is greater than satan's excuses that light is greater than satan's his wants and his will for your life that light is greater let me finish with this if i can find it brown talks about i got to go down a ways but we'll come to this point kind of run out of voice to preach he said he said lucifer we heard about that we heard about lucifer on sunday so the devil of this world that stood there against jesus the world belonged to him it always has been why art thou fallen a loose for the sun in the morning see this world belonged to him that's when he was kicked out of heaven he ca come back to it he was the one who said to christ these kingdoms are mine i do with them as i will they belong to him he is the one that's in the world john had told the disciples you heard the antichrist was come it's already working the children of disobedience but the little children you're not of this world you're of god and greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world that's christ in you he that created the heavens and earth made manifest in the person jesus christ god in christ reconciling the world to himself let's say let's say you say the son of god that through brother branham all right let's find out if he was eternal greater was he that was in joshua that was in the sun greater was he that was in moses that was in egypt greater was he that was in daniel that was in persia greater was he that was in shadrach meshach and the great bed negro that had control of the fire greater was he that was in david that was in goliath greater than was he that was in that and jesus that was in the storms and the problems and the situation greater was he that was an elijah it was in the brassy skies greater this he amen that is in you he said then what about healing the sick greater is he that is in you that's in sickness hello somebody greater is he that's in you then that's in sickness greater is the healer greater is the creator than the devil that's trying to interrupt the program of your life [Music] hallelujah greater is he that's in you that he that's in the world greater is he that's an elijah greater than he that is in isaiah than the time was or any of the prophets greater it was he that was in job that when the skin worms and death and grave but by vision he saw the coming of the lord he said though amen though god slayed me yet i'll trust him though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i'll see god die my redeemer liveth why something greater was on the inside of him greater was he there was a noah that was in the judgments of the waters hallelujah he's greater than any problem he's greater than any situation and greater than he that is in us that's in the world that's christ he's conquered every enemy when he was on earth he conquered sin he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave and now he lives in us as the conqueror therefore he's still conquering sickness he's still conquering hell he's still conquering death he's still conquering the grave come to us and set us free and greater is he that's in you that he that's in the world [Applause] whoa hallelujah oh my amen why would we stand back like a coward why don't we just sit on the sidelines let's follow the captain let's follow him let's go with him take that what he gives you in fight sickness sin fight unbelievable way take that what he gives you and tell the devil you're a liar amen christ said he has overcome the world and greater is he that's in you that he that's in the world greater is the power of christ in you than the sickness that you have in your body tonight greater is the power of christ then that little bit said and sin that you can't overcome let's take the holy spirit and fight the devil down hallelujah and walk out of here victorious as heroes of the cross how many can say that tonight greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world maybe you've got sickness you need to tell that sickness i got somebody greater maybe you got sin i got somebody greater maybe you got high blood pressure i got somebody greater maybe he walked in here all gloomy and all upset i got somebody greater [Applause] he's greater than any situation he's get greater than any problem he's greater than anything you could ever go through the light that is in you is greater than the darkness that's in the world the sun is up there shall be light he still is the same yesterday today the light's still shining devil do like brother wayne would tell you tell the devil i'm still here let's wave our lights amen let's wave it to a dark world there is a light greater than that darkness you're in he healed the sick he destroyed sin and he came to you that he might dwell in you a light to a dark world aspirins i'm sorry hallelujah greater is he that's in you than that wheelchair greater is he that's in you than that stretcher greater is he that's in you than that cancer greater is he that's in you than that affliction greater is he that's in you than anything the devil could ever put on you greater is he is in you the light is shining the light is moving he's conquered every enemy your enemies are conquered your enemy might have been breathing down your neck this week you need to turn and look at him and say you're conquered my god conquered you he broke the back of satan he's greater hallelujah let god arise and his enemies be scattered let the

than he that's in that discouragement greater is he that's in us and he that would try to snuff our lives out greater see you're greater lord and we're thankful for that lord tonight we can lift up a god not just a god of history not just a god of 2000 years ago or 60 years ago or 100 years ago or any time ago but a god that's today living in the people light shining and dark at times and places
