[50:55] life I don't want to be the same
[50:58] and when we when we come to a meeting
[51:00] like this we all should come with you
[51:02] know to to find out where our weak spots
[51:06] are and how little we are and you know
[51:09] why so we can put our trust in a god
[51:11] who's strong and who's more than able so

[55:20] piece we see scripture after scripture
[55:23] prophecy after prophecy being fulfilled
[55:27] before your our
[55:31] eyes and the prophet
[55:33] says as Israel was blinded so that the
[55:37] Gentiles could come in now the Gentiles
[55:40] are blinded so the bride can be taken
[55:43] out and Israel can receive the Feast of
[55:47] the

[1:08:56] John 1 a familiar
[1:09:01] scripture verse
[1:09:08] one in the beginning was the word and
[1:09:11] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:09:14] God the same was in the beginning with
[1:09:16] God all things were made by him and
[1:09:19] without him was not anything made that
[1:09:22] was made in him was life and the life
[1:09:26] was the light of men and the light
[1:09:29] shined in darkness and the Darkness
[1:09:32] comprehend it not now comprehend in the
[1:09:36] Lexicon it says to lay hold of or to
[1:09:40] take possession or
[1:09:42] overtaking another translation says the
[1:09:45] darkness has not overcome it so we live
[1:09:49] in a dark age but it will not overcome
[1:09:52] because he is the light
[1:09:56] and when when you are in the light there
[1:09:59] is no
[1:10:00] Darkness so let's be in Christ Jesus in
[1:10:03] Heavenly places amen where all things
[1:10:06] are possible no matter what the darkness
[1:10:08] may say you know that you know that you
[1:10:11] know that he is the light personally to
[1:10:15] you
[1:10:16] Hallelujah another scripture in 1 John
[1:10:23] 5 verse one
[1:10:34] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the

[1:12:58] partakers not
[1:13:01] Spectators the Lord told us to be
[1:13:03] partakers of his divine nature it's not
[1:13:07] a I want to be a
[1:13:09] partaker I want to play my role I want
[1:13:12] to pull on the word I want to receive my

[1:13:19] amen for a title I'd like to take my

[1:13:25] in the open
[1:13:27] book so I want to make it very
[1:13:30] personal I said my victory
[1:13:34] dance in the open book because it's not
[1:13:37] a group Affair it's not oh this this
[1:13:41] church or that church it's an individual
[1:13:44] Affair you and God and you need to have
[1:13:49] all your victory dance in the open
[1:13:54] book is that
[1:13:56] okay so we see amen we read that God is
[1:14:01] light so what is light let's go in there
[1:14:05] for a moment light is the absence of
[1:14:08] Darkness light is the essence of
[1:14:15] life without the Sun's light we would
[1:14:18] have no plants no food no vegetables
[1:14:21] nothing no existence so everything our
[1:14:25] planet depends on the sun rising every
[1:14:28] day producing its energy filled
[1:14:33] raay that's the natural come on Saints
[1:14:37] now what about the spiritual their
[1:14:40] energy filled raise here this morning
[1:14:44] from the light of the s o n shining on
[1:14:47] the predestinated
[1:14:50] seed
[1:14:52] Hallelujah charge me once again Lord
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:14:59] the prophet says what is light the
[1:15:02] Vindicated spoken word of God outside of
[1:15:06] that there is no
[1:15:07] light Hallelujah so outside of the word
[1:15:11] of God the revealed word of God there is
[1:15:13] no
[1:15:15] light we see in Genesis 2 where he said
[1:15:20] I am and the prophet says J Ju B Yahweh
[1:15:26] Jehovah what did it mean I am the all
[1:15:29] existent one who has created something
[1:15:32] of myself to be a son of mine or a
[1:15:36] temporary amateur little one of
[1:15:40] mine building up
[1:15:42] now he says Glory why Jehovah means that
[1:15:47] he gave man to be an amature
[1:15:52] God my
[1:15:55] he is Father God and he made a man an
[1:15:57] amature God so he isn't self-existing
[1:16:00] anymore he exists with his
[1:16:05] family I I told you we are
[1:16:08] family I'm glad you accept me and your
[1:16:12] family but one thing is my father
[1:16:14] accepted
[1:16:17] me amen and then he says amen he exists
[1:16:21] with his family el el Elohim amen
[1:16:24] Jehovah meaning the one who exists with
[1:16:26] his family so then the prophet he says
[1:16:30] he was God the
[1:16:32] logos I know you're well taught you
[1:16:35] heard it before I'm not going to preach
[1:16:37] anything
[1:16:39] new I have no Doctrine to the I I keep
[1:16:42] saying it I have one doctrine that is
[1:16:44] Jesus Christ and he is the one I'm
[1:16:47] preaching
[1:16:49] about amen so he says the logos the word
[1:16:53] that went out of God in begin it began
[1:16:55] to brood upon the Earth it brought forth
[1:16:57] marine life amen when the spirit of God
[1:17:00] the logos the word which God said let
[1:17:03] there be and they win the logos which is
[1:17:06] the word of God and the word of God the
[1:17:09] whole word of God the whole Bible for
[1:17:12] every age so don't think the word of God
[1:17:15] is out of
[1:17:16] cater is
[1:17:19] outdated that's Satan trying to put in
[1:17:22] your mind that you need something new
[1:17:25] you don't need anything you God has
[1:17:27] given us an open book amen and are we
[1:17:31] going to get to that that's why you can
[1:17:33] have a victory dance because Victory in
[1:17:36] Jesus my Savior
[1:17:40] forever
[1:17:43] forever
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:48] forever Satan tries to put some time on
[1:17:52] it but he's still the same this morning
[1:17:54] morning for you if you have a need and
[1:17:57] if you don't have a need believe me you
[1:17:59] need to come to the
[1:18:02] altar so we will pray for you because we
[1:18:05] have a need of more of God he said there
[1:18:08] is so many untapped resources come on
[1:18:11] Church the time is right now that we go
[1:18:15] and plunge ourself in Jesus and get
[1:18:18] these untapped
[1:18:20] resources these rays of the s o n on the
[1:18:24] seed of God God hallelujah amen the
[1:18:28] whole word of God for every age amen
[1:18:31] hallelujah thank God for the
[1:18:34] word now I love what the prophet says he
[1:18:37] says now that same logos are you with me
[1:18:41] has a part he has got a
[1:18:44] bride a word bride that's right he has
[1:18:48] got a bride and the same logos this word
[1:18:52] cannot be tampered with is rooing over
[1:18:55] the church today trying to bring back
[1:18:59] the word to what to its full
[1:19:05] manifestation to its full
[1:19:09] manifestation think of it Saint he needs
[1:19:14] us for his full
[1:19:17] manifestation the prophet even says it
[1:19:19] different without you I'm including
[1:19:23] myself he he isn't complete think of it
[1:19:27] Saints Satan tries to tell you your
[1:19:30] little nobody Satan tries to put all
[1:19:32] these demons on you depression suicide
[1:19:36] all these
[1:19:38] things and here God tells you I've
[1:19:41] chosen you I want to manifest my word
[1:19:44] through you and without you I'm not
[1:19:49] complete talking about a victory
[1:19:52] dance amen amen it's good the preacher
[1:19:55] says it but what about
[1:19:57] you let's be
[1:19:59] partakers amen every one of us has a
[1:20:01] role to
[1:20:04] play we'll get to that so in God there
[1:20:07] were attributes an attribute is a
[1:20:10] thought amen and he spoke it it and it
[1:20:12] was a word and the Word was made
[1:20:13] manifest and it was the word made
[1:20:15] manifest it's God becoming
[1:20:20] material God becoming material look to
[1:20:24] your neighbor
[1:20:25] that's God becoming material that's what
[1:20:28] God wants to do now there's Darkness
[1:20:30] covering the whole Earth but upon you in
[1:20:33] you his glory shall be seen shall be
[1:20:38] manifested Hallelujah talking about
[1:20:41] perilous time yes but for the bride it's
[1:20:44] a glorious time amen because there's a
[1:20:47] Time and Eternity that is blending
[1:20:50] together the prophet says we're bumping
[1:20:52] in the angels and one song Glad morning
[1:20:56] when all will be over when the last seed
[1:20:59] comes
[1:21:00] in I'm going to take a
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:05] Rapture anybody wants to come with
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:10] me preach with me hallelujah amen so
[1:21:15] Darkness will not overtake it will not
[1:21:18] take possession over God's light that's
[1:21:21] why Satan is against the word of God is
[1:21:24] against
[1:21:26] Revelation but I love Revelation not a
[1:21:29] revelation that a man can give you that
[1:21:32] a group can give you but God gives you a
[1:21:35] personal
[1:21:38] experience a personal
[1:21:41] experience where you know for yourself
[1:21:45] not what mama says not what daddy says
[1:21:48] what you
[1:21:50] say hallelujah amen we know that Eve she
[1:21:54] fell from Satan's scheme against the
[1:21:56] word of God you know what by
[1:21:59] reasoning yeah that's why I asked you
[1:22:03] can we be all in one Accord lay aside
[1:22:07] everything every reasoning everything
[1:22:09] that is going on in your life oh I don't
[1:22:12] know if Brother David I don't know if
[1:22:14] God can still answer he can still save
[1:22:16] me if he can still do for something for
[1:22:18] me let me tell you you're in the right
[1:22:20] place at the right moment if you can
[1:22:22] just lay aside every birth burden
[1:22:25] everything contrary to the word of God
[1:22:28] and just keep Jesus on your mind you
[1:22:31] will see something you will see
[1:22:34] something where the headlines they will
[1:22:36] be jealous
[1:22:39] right why because we know amen when you
[1:22:43] have a personal experience you know that
[1:22:46] God is still alive and that Darkness
[1:22:49] will not
[1:22:50] comprehend that's right it won't
[1:22:52] overtake you maybe in distress oh but
[1:22:55] not abandoned maybe going through a
[1:22:58] trial but not
[1:23:00] forgotten come on
[1:23:03] Saints it's not just a nice story it's a
[1:23:08] reality Hallelujah you know when the
[1:23:10] word of God is being preached and the
[1:23:13] spirit of God is moving amen and demons
[1:23:16] are cast out brother Tim he Timothy he
[1:23:19] mentioned something last night we're
[1:23:21] just talking about hunting so oh yeah we
[1:23:24] going to go
[1:23:26] hunting
[1:23:29] tomorrow come on we going to go demon
[1:23:35] hunting because that's the time amen
[1:23:39] where Mark 16 is still applied the
[1:23:42] scripture that is the most debated is it
[1:23:44] still applicable oh yes it is still
[1:23:46] applicable in the name of Jesus demons
[1:23:49] has to flee when we were in maish's
[1:23:52] Island brother Joe and myself while was
[1:23:54] preaching the word the presence of the
[1:23:56] go of the Lord swept over the building
[1:23:59] there was such a presence of God there
[1:24:01] were families that were in the in the
[1:24:04] message in church that hated each other
[1:24:08] think about it brother Tim spoke every
[1:24:11] little thing every little
[1:24:15] thing here's my cup Lord so there was
[1:24:19] hatred but in the presence of the Lord
[1:24:21] you know what happened they ran to each
[1:24:24] other
[1:24:25] forgive me forgive me because they knew
[1:24:28] that they needed
[1:24:30] Jesus and that's what is going on here
[1:24:32] this
[1:24:33] morning yes that's what is going on we
[1:24:36] need
[1:24:37] Jesus more than yesterday yesterday was
[1:24:41] wonderful but I need more of him this
[1:24:45] morning and that applies from the
[1:24:47] youngest that's why I love the quote
[1:24:49] brother brandham said every man every
[1:24:51] woman every boy and girl
[1:24:54] yes I need
[1:24:57] Jesus
[1:24:59] Hallelujah so Eve she listens to the
[1:25:04] reasoning
[1:25:05] my She Fell From Grace by listening to
[1:25:09] Satan's lie after God had fortified her
[1:25:13] behind his
[1:25:15] word if she would have stayed behind the
[1:25:18] word the
[1:25:20] word she would have never
[1:25:23] fell think think of it that's
[1:25:26] right sometimes we fall do you know why
[1:25:29] it
[1:25:30] is because we're not behind the
[1:25:33] word brother Tim can preach and
[1:25:37] sometimes yes it's the word of God is a
[1:25:40] two-edged sword sometimes oh yes it's
[1:25:43] good for
[1:25:44] correction we never get many amens on
[1:25:49] that yeah we don't like that but that
[1:25:52] applies to us too
[1:25:55] don't think it's just what we preach
[1:25:57] that's what applies to us too but the
[1:25:59] word Inc is always in season we don't
[1:26:04] want a lecture we want an anointed
[1:26:08] [Applause]
[1:26:09] preaching but when the word corrects us
[1:26:12] we should be the fastest ones to say
[1:26:14] here am I but Satan tries to battle and
[1:26:17] say no no no no here he here he goes
[1:26:22] again cast down reason
[1:26:25] everything every
[1:26:27] stronghold that goes against the word of
[1:26:30] God because it's for you good if God is
[1:26:34] correcting
[1:26:36] you my well you just said well or those
[1:26:40] who said amen that you wanted to go in
[1:26:41] the
[1:26:42] Rapture amen and to go in the Rapture
[1:26:45] you need the token applied without the
[1:26:49] Holy Ghost there is no
[1:26:52] Rapture so that's why I need I want
[1:26:55] every church every service sorry every
[1:26:58] moment to get another
[1:27:03] portion oh yes so when you get out of
[1:27:06] the word that's when you start
[1:27:09] reasoning let's
[1:27:11] continue Satan Prophet says he quoted
[1:27:15] the
[1:27:17] word he didn't say that he quoted the
[1:27:21] word I hope my French or Belgian accent
[1:27:23] that you understands it he quoted the
[1:27:27] word he said quote it Cote it Cote
[1:27:32] it c o a t e d you got it he didn't
[1:27:38] quoted
[1:27:41] it he says it was like putting icing on
[1:27:45] a cake oh it looks so good yes but it
[1:27:48] comes from hell
[1:27:55] all this nonsense we hear against the
[1:27:58] word of God comes from
[1:28:03] Hellen that's right that's what they try
[1:28:06] to do that today they try to whitewash
[1:28:09] it says the prophet you know what
[1:28:11] whitewash means is to alter in a way
[1:28:15] that forces or caters the
[1:28:18] people they become
[1:28:20] catered I can I'm okay with something
[1:28:23] not
[1:28:24] pure word no you're not okay you're on a
[1:28:28] slippery
[1:28:29] [Applause]
[1:28:30] Road and people you know the religious
[1:28:33] Spirits are oh they're so strong yeah be
[1:28:37] oh Hallelujah all is well really go
[1:28:41] ahead you need Jesus more than yesterday
[1:28:45] that's right and as long as long as you
[1:28:47] oh I'm okay I'm okay no I hope I don't I
[1:28:50] don't offend you but it's the truth so
[1:28:53] many people think oh I'm going all as
[1:28:57] well you have to lay aside
[1:29:00] everything every little brother Brown
[1:29:03] calls it ISM every little thing that is
[1:29:06] against the
[1:29:08] word because I need
[1:29:11] Jesus amen it got to be everything it
[1:29:14] got to be Everything Jesus Christ the
[1:29:17] same yesterday today and forever that's
[1:29:20] why oh that's one of my favorite quotes
[1:29:22] and I'm sure I'm going to get a big amen
[1:29:24] here he says now remember Christ in the
[1:29:27] true church is what a continuation of
[1:29:31] the book of Acts so there's not an end
[1:29:34] date at the continuation of the book of
[1:29:37] Acts we just read that he wants to
[1:29:40] manifest his work through us so there is
[1:29:44] going on all over the world the spirit
[1:29:47] is
[1:29:49] moving come on church amen there's a
[1:29:52] continuation of the book of that we can
[1:29:54] say we had wonderful meetings last week
[1:29:57] yes that's right glory be to God but
[1:30:00] this is another opportunity to receive
[1:30:02] more from
[1:30:04] God and if you lose that desire that
[1:30:07] thirst you know when you're in a desert
[1:30:10] when you're in a desert you don't feel
[1:30:13] like
[1:30:14] drinking you don't feel like drinking
[1:30:16] but they tell you you have to drink
[1:30:18] because you will become dried up and
[1:30:21] that's what we have people are in church
[1:30:24] sitting like dried
[1:30:26] sticks amen you know how the prophet
[1:30:29] says like a dying
[1:30:35] caloo I'm just quoting the
[1:30:38] prophet

[1:30:56] who was not worthy the woman who had oh
[1:30:59] of of ill
[1:31:00] Fame amen but she went to the
[1:31:06] well and some of us have come here we

[1:31:24] hearing
[1:31:25] me she had an appointment a conference
[1:31:28] with
[1:31:31] God and you know what Jesus
[1:31:36] said the ones that the father is looking
[1:31:39] for I'm
[1:31:41] paraphrasing are those that worship Him
[1:31:44] in spirit and in
[1:31:46] truth those so the father is seeking
[1:31:50] those that are willing to worship him in
[1:31:53] in spirit and in truth now let me tell
[1:31:56] you the truth is being spoken behind
[1:31:59] this
[1:32:00] pulpit and when you receive the word not
[1:32:03] in your mind but in your soul something
[1:32:06] will stir something will happen and you
[1:32:09] will answer amen you can be a dying Cal

[1:32:39] his divine
[1:32:42] nature hallelujah amen there the amen
[1:32:46] Christ and the true church is a
[1:32:47] continuation of the book of Acts amen
[1:32:49] and we know that the Book of Revelation
[1:32:51] shows how that the Antichrist Christ
[1:32:54] Spirit would come into the church and
[1:32:57] defile
[1:32:58] it how making it
[1:33:06] lukewarm any lukewarm amongst us come to
[1:33:10] the
[1:33:13] front hey I have
[1:33:15] Liberty I'm at my home Church brother
[1:33:18] Tim
[1:33:24] making it lukewarm formal and
[1:33:28] Powerless powerless but it ain't over

[1:43:15] John Wesley sanctification pancost
[1:43:17] restoration of the gifts amen the Holy
[1:43:19] Ghost baptism of Holy Ghost what was the
[1:43:21] fourth the word
[1:43:23] the
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:25] word amen in the last days Malachi 4
[1:43:29] Elijah is to come with every
[1:43:32] word the word of the Lord came to the
[1:43:35] prophet in the evening lights is to come
[1:43:36] forth to restore and bring back what he
[1:43:40] says to turn the hearts of the
[1:43:45] children
[1:43:47] Hallelujah back to the faith of the
[1:43:50] fathers he says the fourth light woo
[1:43:53] Hallelujah the fort was the word itself
[1:43:57] the word made
[1:44:00] flesh come on now fruits of the proof of
[1:44:04] the
[1:44:06] Resurrection so now with the full
[1:44:11] restoration of the word comes the full
[1:44:15] restoration of the
[1:44:18] power right yes
[1:44:21] sir if that can drop deep in your
[1:44:26] soul Satan will be
[1:44:28] powerless before
[1:44:31] you before each and
[1:44:33] everyone that's right because if it
[1:44:35] drops in your soul it's not a head
[1:44:37] knowledge it's a reality you know that
[1:44:40] you know well no matter what Satan may
[1:44:43] tell you can show you scientific proof
[1:44:46] you know that the word of God will never
[1:44:48] fail
[1:44:53] amen he says what was that F that fourth
[1:45:01] light to shine the light on the
[1:45:07] word that's why I keep on saying we are
[1:45:09] a privileged
[1:45:11] people so many people are scratching
[1:45:14] their head they read the same Bible as
[1:45:16] we do and they don't have the Revelation
[1:45:20] the light on the word
[1:45:23] like we have
[1:45:24] it that's why brother brandham he says
[1:45:29] amen you know when he talks about the
[1:45:31] dream amen and he says amen we were all
[1:45:34] standing there together I'm just quoting
[1:45:36] it listening to you interpret the
[1:45:38] Mysteries writing on those stones on the
[1:45:40] mountain and he says then you picked up
[1:45:43] something like from the
[1:45:44] air you know that story something like a
[1:45:48] wrecking bar or a
[1:45:50] crowbar are you with me something like
[1:45:53] that A Wrecking Bar real sharp and said
[1:45:56] how you done it I don't know and you
[1:45:59] struck the top of that mountain and
[1:46:01] ripped it around and lifted the cap of
[1:46:03] it and it was in the shape of a pyramid
[1:46:05] and you ripped the top of it and beneath
[1:46:08] that was white stone white granite and
[1:46:11] you said the Sun the light has never
[1:46:14] shined on this before look on
[1:46:20] this look on this
[1:46:23] the open book he said that just before
[1:46:26] the opening of the
[1:46:27] seals does that mean that what he says
[1:46:30] before the seals you throw it away no by
[1:46:32] no
[1:46:33] means but that's what the third PLL is
[1:46:36] about the revealing of the word of God
[1:46:39] the light on the word so that us can be
[1:46:42] restored to the faith of the
[1:46:46] fathers
[1:46:48] hallelujah amen amen amen isn't that
[1:46:51] wonderful that's why you should never
[1:46:53] let the message become
[1:46:57] common you're not hearing
[1:46:59] me and when I told you in the beginning
[1:47:02] that you are a blessed people to have
[1:47:05] the ministry that you have that's not to
[1:47:08] lift up my friends
[1:47:10] no but you see what's going on in the
[1:47:13] world Satan tries to discredit the word
[1:47:16] of God by all mean whatever he can he
[1:47:18] will try to do it but solid preachers
[1:47:22] that's stand for the truth oh yes you
[1:47:26] can give glory to God Amen because it's
[1:47:28] a gift from God and it's God's blessing
[1:47:32] to
[1:47:33] you oh yeah it's God's blessing to
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:40] you so he says amen who is this amen the
[1:47:45] spirit that was on our lord Jesus is
[1:47:46] coming to unite himself with his church
[1:47:49] he's spreading forth his great Holy
[1:47:51] Light to redeem and bring us into
[1:47:54] Fellowship the Church of the Living God
[1:47:56] for the Rapture that is near at
[1:47:59] hand amen then he says turn on the light
[1:48:02] don't refuse the light of the Gospel of
[1:48:05] Jesus Christ which brings the warming
[1:48:07] rays of the Holy Ghost upon you it makes
[1:48:10] you a new creation in Jesus
[1:48:18] Christ that's the way God does it today
[1:48:21] he sends his words for for this hour and
[1:48:24] the Holy Spirit comes and makes that
[1:48:26] word
[1:48:29] live but if you have a rebellious
[1:48:33] Spirit how do you want the word of God
[1:48:36] to manifest in your life right oh not me
[1:48:40] Brother David
[1:48:43] really are
[1:48:45] you sensitive to the voice of
[1:48:48] God where you don't want to miss
[1:48:50] anything that God wants to tell you
[1:48:53] right
[1:48:55] yeah it's not
[1:48:57] always in the big loud
[1:49:00] voice it's in the still Small Voice
[1:49:03] although it can be screamed from behind
[1:49:05] the pulpit but God
[1:49:07] is knocking that's right but if there's
[1:49:11] a rebellious spirit amen the word can
[1:49:14] have no effect unless you
[1:49:19] you come to Christ that's right
[1:49:23] run to
[1:49:24] Christ and while he still saves while he
[1:49:28] still fills while he still delivers
[1:49:31] while he still heals take every
[1:49:33] opportunity you can and give it all to
[1:49:38] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[1:49:42] amen and the Holy Spirit comes and make
[1:49:44] the word live amen but light shine
[1:49:47] because it's the word of God being
[1:49:48] Vindicated that his word is true and
[1:49:53] there's nothing fictitious about
[1:49:58] that you know you have to get out
[1:50:02] of this mess
[1:50:05] age to get into the
[1:50:10] message
[1:50:11] amen because you're in such a mess
[1:50:15] because you left the word of God but
[1:50:18] I've got good
[1:50:19] news he's still alive he's still the
[1:50:23] same this morning but are you willing to
[1:50:25] lay everything aside and run through
[1:50:29] Christ get into the message and it will
[1:50:33] take you out of your mess
[1:50:36] age are you with
[1:50:40] me when Jesus asked
[1:50:43] Peter who do you say not what everybody
[1:50:47] else says what do you
[1:50:51] say who do you say say that I
[1:50:54] am do you know that cuz we know the
[1:50:57] scripture the Gates of Hell will not
[1:50:59] Prevail against us do you know that when
[1:51:02] Jesus asked that it was in the area of
[1:51:05] of
[1:51:05] cesaria that was filled with
[1:51:09] immorality comparable like
[1:51:11] now there was a cave and on on the side
[1:51:14] of Mount Heron there was a cave that was
[1:51:17] consecrated to all kind of immorality
[1:51:24] debauchery evil evil
[1:51:28] things and that before you enter that
[1:51:31] gate the sorry that cave that's where
[1:51:33] they call the Gate of
[1:51:36] Hell so now here Jesus asked Peter
[1:51:40] before this these Gates of Hell then we
[1:51:44] can bring it now to our time we live
[1:51:48] it's hell on Earth
[1:51:52] but if all power of Satan don't forget
[1:51:56] that the power of God has been restored
[1:51:59] for God's people so he asked in front of
[1:52:02] the gate who do you say that I
[1:52:06] am not what brother Tim says no what
[1:52:09] brother Timothy brother Aaron brother
[1:52:11] Joe Brother David or whoever says what
[1:52:13] do you say who do you say that I
[1:52:17] [Applause]

[1:52:22] the Gates of Hell immorality so we live

[2:10:15] dancing where are you going brother
[2:10:17] David nailing some demons
[2:10:21] dancing of God's people as a reaction to
[2:10:26] the goodness of God in their
[2:10:31] life that's why people can sit as dry
[2:10:36] sticks because they don't experience the
[2:10:38] goodness of God in their
[2:10:41] Liv but let me tell you this woman at
[2:10:44] the well and only if you drink of this
[2:10:48] water you will never thirst again
[2:10:52] that's right from a sinner she became a

[2:10:58] going she testified I'm not say I'm not
[2:11:01] saying
[2:11:04] that I'm going to straighten that run
[2:11:06] right out no women
[2:11:10] preachers but women brothers who
[2:11:15] testify she came at that well as a
[2:11:18] sinner thinking she wasn't Worthy but
[2:11:21] she met Jesus and when
[2:11:25] testifying the Messiah is here
[2:11:29] now there were religious people and they
[2:11:32] were blinded just like today people are
[2:11:36] blinded but thank God there is a bride
[2:11:39] preparing that sees a light of God Amen
[2:11:44] that sees the open book and goes to the
[2:11:47] Angel takes the open book and eat the
[2:11:51] book to become the book to become the
[2:11:56] word

[2:12:01] Exodus 15 when they went through the Red
[2:12:04] Sea Miriam she sang the song of
[2:12:09] Deliverance you want to talk about
[2:12:16] Deliverance before we see also in the
[2:12:20] Bible just quote that one before that
[2:12:23] David danced with all his
[2:12:26] might when the Ark of the Covenant came
[2:12:29] back the Psalm 30 says Thou Hast turned
[2:12:32] for me my mour into dancing thou Hast
[2:12:35] put off my sackcloth and GED me with
[2:12:38] gladness to the end that my glory may
[2:12:40] sing praise to thee and not be
[2:12:45] silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks
[2:12:49] unto thee forever
[2:12:52] how many can say I will give thanks to
[2:12:55] my Lord forever in the good times I will
[2:12:59] praise him in the bad times I will do
[2:13:02] the
[2:13:05] same so
[2:13:08] dancing is a natural
[2:13:16] expression even brother Bram says even
[2:13:20] the type of music
[2:13:22] put it next to a baby and you see how he
[2:13:24] will react so it's a natural
[2:13:27] thing okay just building up here and
[2:13:31] when you're filled with the fullness of
[2:13:33] God oh something has to express
[2:13:36] itself amen oh John 8:36 says he who the
[2:13:41] sun sets free is
[2:13:44] free
[2:13:47] indeed let me quote you
[2:13:50] that I know I'm not an English teacher

[2:14:06] space deed okay let me talk to you a
[2:14:09] little while about the deed is that okay
[2:14:12] yeah so what is the book of redemption
[2:14:14] the title deed the exra abstract title D
[2:14:18] it means it search all the way back to
[2:14:21] its
[2:14:22] beginning come on
[2:14:25] now you become a Son of God it's
[2:14:28] Redemption means all legal possession to
[2:14:32] all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my
[2:14:36] brother blam claps his hands together
[2:14:38] once oh sorry once but I'm going to clap
[2:14:40] oh yes he's worthy of my
[2:14:43] praise amen now listen I'm talking to
[2:14:45] you now what ought that to do to a born
[2:14:49] again Christian
[2:14:52] amen let's
[2:14:55] continue he says what did he do by for
[2:14:57] knowledge he forsaw us knowing that he
[2:14:59] was a savior the self self-existent one
[2:15:02] by full knowledge he looked down and he
[2:15:04] saw everyone that could accept it and
[2:15:07] then by doing so he said to say that the
[2:15:09] only way I can do it is I will become
[2:15:12] down myself made flesh and take the sin
[2:15:15] of man upon him and die for him that I
[2:15:20] might be the one that's
[2:15:24] worshiped God deserves all the
[2:15:30] glory even when you don't feel like it
[2:15:33] he is still watching over you and he
[2:15:36] deserves all the
[2:15:38] [Music]
[2:15:44] glory so in plain language the bre the
[2:15:47] true bright was in the mind of God
[2:15:49] eternally amen
[2:15:52] I'm talking about your photo album
[2:15:56] huh we did not become seed by rebirth we
[2:16:00] were seed and therefore were reborn for
[2:16:02] only the elect can be
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:05] reborn God put your name on the land's
[2:16:08] book of life before the world was even
[2:16:13] formed you want to talk about a victory
[2:16:17] dance some people think I'm born and hey
[2:16:20] and now I I have this poor life no no no
[2:16:23] the best thing God could do as we
[2:16:26] bypassed our theophany he says he Place
[2:16:29] us here to be tested and
[2:16:33] tempted why because God wants to show
[2:16:37] forth his glory through
[2:16:40] you and if you only can believe and
[2:16:43] confess his word you will see Miracles
[2:16:46] you will see Giants fall you will walk
[2:16:49] on water you will see the glory of God
[2:16:52] revealed manifested through
[2:16:55] you
[2:16:57] hallelujah amen amen that's why when
[2:17:00] John listen now when John he says
[2:17:03] talking about a happy time when the
[2:17:04] seals broke amen he must have looked and
[2:17:07] seen his name look past the curtain of
[2:17:11] time that's why the word is being
[2:17:13] preached to you this
[2:17:15] morning so you can by faith
[2:17:19] receive your true
[2:17:21] identity and see who you are because
[2:17:25] that's Satan wants you to believe that
[2:17:27] you're
[2:17:28] powerless but when the true church the
[2:17:31] bride oh believes and takes the open
[2:17:35] book Satan is powerless against
[2:17:39] her how many are part of that her oh
[2:17:43] yeah let it be me Let It Be Me Lord amen
[2:17:46] now amen when we eat the book we become
[2:17:49] the book and Jeremiah 15 says thy words
[2:17:52] were found and I did eat them and the
[2:17:54] word Thy Word was unto me the joy and
[2:17:58] rejoicing of my heart for I am called by
[2:18:01] thy name oh Lord God of

[2:18:21] deed belongs to
[2:18:25] you that's why you can really have a
[2:18:28] victory dance because when that becomes
[2:18:31] a reality you know that Satan is under
[2:18:35] your foot
[2:18:38] right hallelujah amen so we see that
[2:18:42] Miriam she sang amen we see that Exodus

[2:19:21] give him thanks for his goodness give
[2:19:23] him thanks for his grace when you start
[2:19:27] looking into the word of God and you see
[2:19:29] the promises laying there before you

[2:20:34] nostrils woo what a mighty God we serve
[2:20:39] the blast of thy nostrils the waters
[2:20:41] were gathered together the flood stood
[2:20:43] upright as a heap and the depths were
[2:20:45] congealed in the heart of the
[2:20:48] sea that's why
[2:20:51] the wind of Pentecost still blows this
[2:20:58] morning amen
[2:21:01] amen the wind of Pentecost the same
[2:21:04] blast of the
[2:21:07] nostrils think about it he didn't
[2:21:12] even just out of the
[2:21:15] nostrils
[2:21:18] my going somewhere
[2:21:21] oh yeah Satan has to be under your
[2:21:25] foot because the moment you believe it's
[2:21:28] not what you can do it's what God has
[2:21:30] already done for you amen amen I will
[2:21:34] overtake I will divide the SPO my L
[2:21:36] shall be satisi satisfied upon them amen
[2:21:39] and I will draw my sword my hand shall
[2:21:42] destroy them verse 10 thou this blow
[2:21:44] with thy wind the sea covered them they
[2:21:46] sank as lad the mighty Waters wow this

[2:21:59] the gods who is like thee glorious in
[2:22:00] Holiness fearful and praise doing
[2:22:02] wonders verse 13 thou in thy mercy has

[2:22:08] strength unto thy holy
[2:22:10] habitation the Lord shall reign in verse
[2:22:13] 18 forever and
[2:22:19] ever talking about a song of Praise
[2:22:23] talking about a shout of
[2:22:26] Victory Exodus 15 talks about the song
[2:22:29] of
[2:22:30] Moses and we see also in Revelation 15
[2:22:34] they sang the song of Moses and the song
[2:22:35] of the
[2:22:38] Lamb so there is something

[2:22:48] cords no no I can sing as as bad as it
[2:22:52] could be but it when it is with a pure

[2:23:02] your voice is not good enough oh yes God
[2:23:05] Gave You vocal cords to praise
[2:23:08] him and even if you can play an
[2:23:10] instrument God gave you two
[2:23:12] hands amen that's why I praise him
[2:23:15] because he's worthy of all my praise
[2:23:18] amen let's go on for a little while amen

[2:23:25] says how beautiful that types our church

[2:40:51] time but at the end it shall speak and

[2:41:22] brother Bram says we maybe if the
[2:41:24] musicians can come we can stand to our
[2:41:26] feet I'm winding
[2:41:32] up brother Brown finds himself in a
[2:41:35] meeting and they're singing there's
[2:41:37] going to be a meeting in the
[2:41:40] air and he says I never believed in them
[2:41:43] people that danced you know the quote
[2:41:46] mhm I never did believe in them people
[2:41:49] dancing the way they did and there was a
[2:41:52] little lady came to play the
[2:42:02] piano maybe if you can play there is
[2:42:05] power in the name of Jesus softly
[2:42:10] please he
[2:42:12] says lady came to play the piano I was
[2:42:16] very much a Critic of it
[2:42:19] and this little blond-headed girl jumped
[2:42:21] out of there on the floor and began to
[2:42:23] dance in the
[2:42:24] spirits and me sitting in the seat of
[2:42:27] the
[2:42:28] scornful that's where many people are
[2:42:31] brother God bless you for preaching the
[2:42:35] [Music]
[2:42:41] word and I had been telling my church
[2:42:44] till they was all wondering what I was
[2:42:46] going to do about it think of it
[2:42:50] what is brother Tim going to do all
[2:42:53] [Music]
[2:43:00] focusing they're making look to the
[2:43:02] words what he's saying they're making a
[2:43:05] Tavern out of my church those are no
[2:43:08] little
[2:43:10] words and the first thing you know I
[2:43:12] said wait a minute I wonder if the lady
[2:43:15] has got any scripture for that and I
[2:43:18] begin to think about the scripture where
[2:43:21] was dancing
[2:43:23] ordained

[2:43:31] that Satan in your
[2:43:36] teeth God has a holy dance for his
[2:43:41] people and it was ordained by God
[2:43:45] himself where was dancing ever ordained
[2:43:48] that the first place in the Bible that's
[2:43:50] right he says what made them dance I
[2:43:54] seen the children of Israel when they
[2:43:56] crossed the Red Sea mirion look back and
[2:43:57] see all the task master drown when you
[2:44:00] see your demons under your feet when you
[2:44:04] see your change falling back oh yes
