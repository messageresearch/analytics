[59:48] there's a people that are believing on
[59:50] the report of the Lord. Father, I invite

[1:00:07] that would begin to walk and talk with
[1:00:09] him along the way. Father, I pray God as

[1:00:57] this Memorial Day weekend and certainly
[1:01:00] thankful to be living in a country where
[1:01:01] men would fight and die for us and we
[1:01:04] want to always respect that. We also
[1:01:06] want to honor those that have fought for
[1:01:08] this message and have given their lives
[1:01:11] to it. And certainly do appreciate our
[1:01:13] brother Tim and all that he has meant to
[1:01:16] us throughout the years. And I don't I
[1:01:18] don't just say these things because it's
[1:01:20] the right thing to do or the nice thing
[1:01:21] to do because they're at a man's pulpit,
[1:01:23] but I say it from my heart. I appreciate
[1:01:25] your pastor, brother Tim Puit, and with
[1:01:26] all that is within me. And you know, I I
[1:01:29] found a friend in him. He's he's not
[1:01:31] just my dad's friend, but he's mine. And
[1:01:33] he was when I was young and and uh I
[1:01:36] don't even know if I was even preaching
[1:01:37] yet, but he was never too busy for me.
[1:01:39] And he always he always took time to
[1:01:42] speak to me and tell talk to me about
[1:01:43] the message. And he's been a great
[1:01:45] influence on my life and all this all
[1:01:48] the all the deep questions and all the
[1:01:50] questions that was on the surface. He
[1:01:51] always had time for me, brother Derek.
[1:01:52] And I I appreciate that so much and
[1:01:55] appreciate the ministry. So I say that
[1:01:57] just don't miss how great a pastor that

[1:02:03] It's it's so good to be here. I bring
[1:02:04] greetings from our church family there
[1:02:06] at Full Gospel Lighthouse and and uh
[1:02:09] they they they certainly love you and
[1:02:11] appreciate you. They don't they don't
[1:02:13] miss a service that happens here and uh
[1:02:15] they sometimes catch up with it before I
[1:02:17] get to and uh they they love they love
[1:02:19] this church with all that is within
[1:02:21] them. And I sure appreciate brother
[1:02:23] Timothy and all that he means to me.
[1:02:24] I've spent the last three weeks with
[1:02:25] him. I don't know whether that's a good
[1:02:27] thing or not, but I sure have enjoyed
[1:02:30] myself and he's been a real friend to
[1:02:32] me. Come and minister to uh to us there
[1:02:34] at Full Gospel Lighthouse and then with
[1:02:36] us there in Kentucky. And my the Lord
[1:02:38] certainly used him in a special way.
[1:02:40] Amen. How many has a need that you'd
[1:02:42] like to just make known to the Lord
[1:02:44] today while the preaching of the word is
[1:02:46] going forth? I I pray that God will
[1:02:48] minister to you today. If you have your
[1:02:49] Bibles, we'd like to look in the book of
[1:02:51] Genesis, chapter 3.
[1:02:54] Book of Genesis chapter 3 and verse
[1:03:01] 13. Then also to Matthew chapter 13
[1:03:05] verse 24.
[1:03:24] I sure did appreciate that crawfish boy
[1:03:26] yesterday, too. Uh, Brother
[1:03:29] Jackson, thank you,
[1:03:32] buddy. We love you,
[1:03:34] buddy. I'll be nice. I'm at the pull
[1:03:37] pit.
[1:03:38] So, Amen. God bless you. Amen. Genesis
[1:03:43] chapter 3 and verse 13. And the Lord God
[1:03:46] said unto the woman, "What is this that
[1:03:48] thou hast done?" And the woman said,
[1:03:51] "The serpent beg me, and I did eat." And
[1:03:54] the Lord God said unto the serpent,
[1:03:56] "Because thou hast done this, thou art
[1:03:58] cursed above all cattle, and above every
[1:04:01] beast of the field. Upon thy belly shalt
[1:04:04] thou go, and dust thou shalt eat all the
[1:04:06] days of the life. And I will put enmity
[1:04:10] between thee and the woman, and between
[1:04:13] thy seed and her seed, and it shall
[1:04:16] bruise thy
[1:04:17] head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
[1:04:20] Matthew chapter 13, verse
[1:04:23] 24. While you're turning there, I just
[1:04:25] like to read a portion of quotation
[1:04:28] brother Brandon makes in the message,
[1:04:30] proving his
[1:04:31] word. He said, "You understand that, did
[1:04:34] you see the earth cursed? The whole
[1:04:37] earth is cursed because of Adam's sin.
[1:04:40] But when this little seed, now the woman
[1:04:43] doesn't have a seed. She has a field
[1:04:46] that the seed lays in, not a
[1:04:49] seed. Cuz there's not no germ. You see,
[1:04:53] a germ has to a seed has to have a life
[1:04:55] in it. If it isn't, it's just material.
[1:04:58] The life isn't there. So the seed is in
[1:05:00] the man. That's the reason of the
[1:05:03] serpent's seed had to be in the woman.
[1:05:05] because it wasn't the seed of God. We
[1:05:08] know that. Matthew
[1:05:11] 13:4, another parable put he forth unto
[1:05:14] them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is
[1:05:16] like unto a man which sowed good seed in
[1:05:18] his field. But while men slept, he his
[1:05:21] enemy came and sowed tears amongst the
[1:05:24] wheat and went his way. But when the
[1:05:26] blade was sprung up and brought forth
[1:05:29] brought forth the fruit, then appeared
[1:05:31] the tears also." So the servants of the
[1:05:34] householder came and said unto him, Sir,
[1:05:37] didest not thou sow good seed in thy
[1:05:40] field, from whence then hath it tears?
[1:05:43] And he said unto him, An enemy hath done
[1:05:45] this. The servant said unto him, Wilt
[1:05:47] thou then that we go and gather them up?
[1:05:50] But he said, Nay, lest while we gather
[1:05:52] up the tears, ye root up also the wheat
[1:05:55] with him. Let both grow together until
[1:05:58] the harvest. And in the time of harvest,
[1:06:00] I will say to the reapers, gather ye
[1:06:03] together first the tears and bind them
[1:06:05] in bundles and burn them, but gather the
[1:06:08] wheat into my barn. Let's jump down
[1:06:10] there to verse
[1:06:11] 36. Then Jesus sent the multitude away
[1:06:14] and went into the house. And his
[1:06:16] disciples came unto him, saying, Declare
[1:06:18] unto us the parable of the tears of the
[1:06:21] field. Today I'd like to just take a
[1:06:24] little thought on the field under
[1:06:27] attack. declare unto us the parable of
[1:06:30] the tears of the field. May God bless
[1:06:33] his word. You may be seated today in the
[1:06:35] presence of the Lord. Verse 37 says that
[1:06:38] he answered and said unto them, he that
[1:06:40] sweth the good seed is the son of man.
[1:06:43] The field is the world. The good seed
[1:06:47] are the children of the kingdom, but the
[1:06:49] tears are the children of the wicked
[1:06:50] one. The enemy that sowed them is the
[1:06:53] devil. The harvest is the end of the
[1:06:55] world, and the reapers are the angels.
[1:06:57] As therefore the tears are gathered
[1:07:00] together and burned in the fire, so
[1:07:02] shall it be in the end of this world.
[1:07:04] Son the Son of man shall send forth his
[1:07:06] angels, and they shall gather out of his
[1:07:08] kingdom all things that offend, and them
[1:07:10] which do iniquity, and shall cast them
[1:07:12] into the furnace of fire. There shall be
[1:07:14] wailing and nashing of teeth. Then shall
[1:07:17] the righteous shine forth as a son in
[1:07:20] the kingdom of their father. Who hath
[1:07:22] ears to hear, let him hear. Amen. We
[1:07:26] realize that we are in a very special
[1:07:28] season of life. We realize as the bride
[1:07:30] of Jesus Christ that we are standing in
[1:07:32] one of the most pivotal moments uh as
[1:07:35] the as the living body of Jesus Christ
[1:07:37] that where we recognize that that true
[1:07:40] believers are here to manifest the word
[1:07:43] of the hour and we realize that that
[1:07:45] it's no that it's no it's no uh it's
[1:07:48] nothing to us nothing new to us but we
[1:07:50] realize that we are right here in the
[1:07:52] midst of harvest time and the prophet
[1:07:54] would teach us in modern events made
[1:07:56] clear by pro prophecy he said this is
[1:07:58] not the day of Pentecost cost. He said,
[1:08:00] "But the Pentecostal age is passed." He
[1:08:02] said, "But Pentecost is gone." He said,
[1:08:04] "But this is harvest time." And we
[1:08:06] realize that the hour that we're living
[1:08:08] in, it is a time and a season where
[1:08:10] where God has gathering and we see that
[1:08:13] it is the same life that was in that was
[1:08:16] in the seed in the beginning. We see it
[1:08:18] as it's come back again. Brother
[1:08:20] Brandham would teach us in the church
[1:08:21] age book that the tears are maturing
[1:08:24] very fast. He said, "But if the tears
[1:08:26] are maturing very fast," he said, "then
[1:08:28] the wheat has got to be maturing." He
[1:08:30] said, "The reason why the that the tears
[1:08:32] are maturing in that in such a grass and
[1:08:35] it's such a vast way," he said, "It's
[1:08:36] because of false or or because of of of
[1:08:40] teachers or corrupt teachers that have
[1:08:42] turned the people from the word." He
[1:08:44] said, "But if the wheat also is
[1:08:46] maturing," he said, "then God has sent
[1:08:48] her a prophet messenger with a
[1:08:50] vindicated ministry that he might be
[1:08:53] accepted by the elect." And he went on
[1:08:55] to say that she will mature in the word
[1:08:58] until becoming a word bride. The mighty
[1:09:01] works will be found in her that are
[1:09:03] always attended upon the pure word of
[1:09:06] faith. I don't know about you, but I
[1:09:08] sure appreciate the message of the hour.
[1:09:10] Don't you? I sure appreciate a prophet
[1:09:13] coming by our way and ministering
[1:09:14] ministering these things and God not
[1:09:16] leaving us here in the midst of this
[1:09:18] chaos of Leonosa. But God has given us a
[1:09:21] message that has made us recognize who
[1:09:23] we are and what we are in this in this
[1:09:26] age and in this moment of time that the
[1:09:28] message of the hour has given us a
[1:09:31] liberty to believe that all things are
[1:09:33] possible. But it also points out to us
[1:09:35] that there is a real enemy that is
[1:09:37] wanting to destroy anything that looks
[1:09:39] close to the word of God or anything
[1:09:41] that that is close to it or anything
[1:09:43] that that moves or however the word of
[1:09:45] God comes and whatever form that the
[1:09:47] word of God is. Satan is going to attack
[1:09:50] that word. He is going to attack that
[1:09:52] word. It doesn't matter. It doesn't
[1:09:54] matter if it's in a little bitty child.
[1:09:56] He will attack that word. If it's in a
[1:09:58] if it's in a manger, he will attack that
[1:10:00] word. If it's in a if it's in a if it's
[1:10:02] in an animal, it'll attack that word.
[1:10:04] You watch when God comes, Satan always
[1:10:07] comes and he tries to attack the word.
[1:10:10] Now Jesus said in John 10 and 10 that
[1:10:13] the thief cometh not but for to steal
[1:10:15] and to kill and destroy. Now that word
[1:10:18] it the thief in in the in the Greek it
[1:10:21] it means an embezzler. It is the name
[1:10:24] that is transferred to false teachers
[1:10:27] who do not care to instruct men but
[1:10:29] abuse their confidence for their own
[1:10:31] gain. The thief cometh, the embezzler
[1:10:34] cometh to steal and to kill and destroy.
[1:10:37] But Jesus said, "But I am come to give
[1:10:40] you life that they might have it and
[1:10:43] more abundantly." Jesus didn't come to
[1:10:45] take anything away from you. Jesus come
[1:10:47] to give you life. Jesus didn't come to
[1:10:50] steal away from you, but he come to give
[1:10:51] you peace. He come to restore everything
[1:10:54] that the enemy has tried to come in and
[1:10:57] attack and take away from you. And we
[1:10:59] realize that the word of God has always
[1:11:01] been under attack. Is that right? We
[1:11:04] realize that Satan absolutely loves to
[1:11:07] attack the word of God. So he shows up.
[1:11:10] He shows up to attack the word made
[1:11:13] flesh in this hour. Now the prophet said
[1:11:15] in the contest, he said, "Now what is
[1:11:17] it?" He said, "It's actually a power.
[1:11:20] God is God and Satan is Satan. He said,
[1:11:22] "If you don't believe in a devil," he
[1:11:24] said, "When I first got started," he
[1:11:26] said, "I run long, head long into him
[1:11:28] every day." He said, "Don't tell me
[1:11:30] there's no devil because I know better.
[1:11:32] I have to fight with him every day. So,
[1:11:34] I know there is a devil." And he said,
[1:11:37] "You must be trained. You must meet him
[1:11:40] not with a tr not trained in fi
[1:11:42] psychology, not trained in education,
[1:11:44] but trained by the Holy Spirit. God's
[1:11:47] power in his word to make manifest know
[1:11:50] your enemy. And that's the thing today
[1:11:52] is that we've got to be built upon thus
[1:11:55] sayaith the Lord. We cannot build our
[1:11:57] churches on education. We cannot build
[1:11:59] our our churches on intellectualism, but
[1:12:02] we simply got to build our churches on
[1:12:04] thus sayaith the Lord. And I'm so
[1:12:06] thankful to realize that we're not
[1:12:08] preaching to you something that we don't
[1:12:09] know, but we have a prophet messenger
[1:12:12] that has been thoroughly vindicated that
[1:12:14] has taken us through the scripture, has
[1:12:16] literally opened up the word so we have
[1:12:18] a great understanding what this word
[1:12:21] means.
[1:12:23] Now, you're not going to be absent from
[1:12:24] attacks in your own Christian walk. You
[1:12:26] might be walking with the Lord, but you
[1:12:28] are going to be attacked. Whether in
[1:12:30] body, whether in spirit, or whether in
[1:12:32] your soul, the enemy is going to attack
[1:12:34] you. He is a good adversary and he will
[1:12:37] not give up. Even though you might whip
[1:12:40] him from this from this day until the
[1:12:42] next day until the next day, but he
[1:12:44] keeps coming back. But I say if you're
[1:12:46] coming back, Satan, we you're not coming
[1:12:48] back here to be a victor, but you're
[1:12:50] coming back here to be defeated.
[1:12:53] You can't think just because you have a
[1:12:55] certain name that you're going to be
[1:12:57] without attacks. You can't believe that
[1:12:59] you're just in a certain church that
[1:13:01] you're going to be without attacks. If
[1:13:03] you are under the message of the hour,
[1:13:06] you are going to withstand the attack of
[1:13:08] the enemy. He doesn't care where you
[1:13:10] came from. He doesn't matter what
[1:13:12] culture you came from. The enemy is
[1:13:14] going to attack you. He doesn't care if
[1:13:17] you're a preacher, he's going to attack
[1:13:19] you. He doesn't care if you're a mama,
[1:13:21] he's going to attack you. He even
[1:13:23] attacked our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:13:25] brother Brandham would say he came to
[1:13:26] him in three wild attacks. And I'll just
[1:13:29] be real honest. It's it's very it's very
[1:13:32] amusing sometimes how the enemy likes to
[1:13:35] attack God's children. And you think, my
[1:13:38] where why where is this coming from? And
[1:13:40] how is these things how is these things
[1:13:42] even coming? But you realize that the
[1:13:44] enemy even attacked our Lord Jesus
[1:13:47] Christ. Brother Brandham said he
[1:13:49] attacked him and three wild attacks
[1:13:51] there in Matthew chapter 4. He came
[1:13:53] there on that mount of temptation and he
[1:13:55] attacked him. He attacked his spirit. He
[1:13:58] attacked his flesh and he tried to show
[1:14:00] him that he would have the kingdoms of
[1:14:02] God. But notice what what we realize
[1:14:05] what Satan was trying to do when he
[1:14:07] showed him the kingdoms of the world. He
[1:14:09] was trying to show him a kingdom without
[1:14:11] a Calvary. You see, because you have got
[1:14:14] to go just like Jesus had to go. You got
[1:14:17] to bear a cross. You got to have a
[1:14:19] death. You got to be born again. You've
[1:14:21] got to die out to yourself. You got to
[1:14:24] come to a spot that even though you know
[1:14:26] you're a son of God, even though you're
[1:14:28] predestinated, even though you know that
[1:14:30] God ordained you and predestinated you
[1:14:32] for a great course, you've got to die.
[1:14:36] And Satan will try to offer you the
[1:14:38] kingdoms of this world. But you realize
[1:14:40] this, you can have religion without
[1:14:43] Calvary. You can have religion without a
[1:14:45] new birth. But you got to have a new
[1:14:47] birth to have true religion.
[1:14:51] He said, "Now you watch." He said,
[1:14:53] "Satan doesn't just attack you once." He
[1:14:55] said, "But he will attack you with a
[1:14:57] disease, then he'll come back there and
[1:14:59] he'll attack you and tell you that the
[1:15:00] days of miracles is
[1:15:04] passed." He'll come back there and tell
[1:15:06] you that the days of miracles are
[1:15:07] passed. You didn't get healed. There's
[1:15:09] nothing to it. He said he attacked Jesus
[1:15:11] three times in wild attacks.
[1:15:15] Now, you're not going to stop Satan from
[1:15:17] attacking you.
[1:15:19] You're not going to stop Satan from
[1:15:20] attacking you, but you have been given
[1:15:22] the greatest weapon that has ever been
[1:15:24] placed in the hand of mankind. Is that
[1:15:26] right? You realize that the Bible said
[1:15:29] unto us, "Submit yourselves therefore to
[1:15:31] God. Resist the devil and he will flee
[1:15:34] from you." I love what the prophet said.
[1:15:36] He said, "He won't walk away from you,
[1:15:37] but he'll flee away from you." We
[1:15:40] realize that this enemy that we are
[1:15:42] fighting that the prophet came in there
[1:15:44] and he taught us in the greatest battle
[1:15:46] ever fought. He came in there and told
[1:15:48] us that that is where the battle begins
[1:15:50] at that we realize that the mind is the
[1:15:53] arena where Satan is going to contend
[1:15:55] with our thoughts. He's there and Satan
[1:15:58] is coming and he's going to try to
[1:16:00] instill negativity. He's going to
[1:16:02] instill unbelief. He's going to come in
[1:16:04] there, but God is going to come in there
[1:16:07] and God is going to place his word. So,
[1:16:09] Satan is going to throw out complexes,
[1:16:11] but God is going to put in his word. So,
[1:16:13] Satan will put in anxiety, but God will
[1:16:16] put in peace. So, Satan will put in
[1:16:18] diseases, but God will put in healing.
[1:16:20] Satan will put in corruption, but God
[1:16:22] will bring about a restoration. The word
[1:16:25] of God has never failed in the mouth of
[1:16:27] every son and daughter of God. It never
[1:16:30] failed then and it will not fail now.
[1:16:32] So, Satan might be a great swer, but
[1:16:34] almighty God is the greatest swer that
[1:16:37] there ever has been and ever will be.
[1:16:40] You might sow disbelief. But God is
[1:16:43] going to sow faith. You might sow
[1:16:45] discord, but God is going to sow a a
[1:16:48] reproduction of the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:51] Satan will come in and throw in
[1:16:53] complexes. Are you worthy enough? This
[1:16:56] brother doesn't like me. This sister
[1:16:57] doesn't care for me. The enemy comes in
[1:17:00] and you watch the attack. The attack in
[1:17:03] Matthew chapter 13. I want you to
[1:17:06] realize this that Satan has been
[1:17:08] studying this field.
[1:17:11] He's been watching this field as it has
[1:17:13] grown throughout the ages. He's watched
[1:17:16] that field. Many of times the attacks
[1:17:18] that you go through seem so personal.
[1:17:22] They seem so real. They seem like like
[1:17:25] God that God or or or God has allowed
[1:17:28] this for a certain reason or that
[1:17:30] Satan's got a personal vendetta with
[1:17:31] you. I want to say this that the attack
[1:17:35] against you realize this is not just
[1:17:38] against you but it is against the owner
[1:17:40] of the field.
[1:17:43] If you can catch that in Matthew chapter
[1:17:45] 13 you can see that Satan does not have
[1:17:48] enough power to stop what God has
[1:17:50] already sold because the enemy didn't
[1:17:52] just come in to try to to rob you and
[1:17:56] try to stop the seed. He tried to
[1:17:58] destroy the owner's reputation.
[1:18:00] But I say this that God's seed that he
[1:18:02] deposited is greater than any tear. It's
[1:18:05] greater than any complex. It's greater
[1:18:07] than anything that you ever came out of.
[1:18:09] And only the word of God gives you the
[1:18:11] ability to conquer that enemy. And Satan
[1:18:15] is right there and he's watching the
[1:18:16] field. He's standing so close and he's
[1:18:19] trying to stop that spoken word. That's
[1:18:21] what he's after. We realize that Paul
[1:18:24] said, "But though we or an angel from
[1:18:26] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:18:28] than that which we have preached unto
[1:18:30] you, let him be accured." So when you
[1:18:33] start taking away from the word and you
[1:18:35] start bringing in ideologies and start
[1:18:38] bringing in different ideas that you
[1:18:40] begin to break down the word and you
[1:18:42] bring in a hybrid religion, but there is
[1:18:44] nothing as strong as the supreme
[1:18:47] authority of the original spoken word.
[1:18:49] And Satan realizes that he that he can
[1:18:52] go in there and he might afflict the
[1:18:54] field, but he'll never stop that word.
[1:18:57] He might afflict this field, but he can
[1:19:00] never stop this word. There is nothing
[1:19:02] as strong as the powerful as the power
[1:19:05] of this word. So Satan comes in there to
[1:19:08] hinder the field, the womb, the vessel.
[1:19:12] Now, brother man said in future home he
[1:19:14] said now the woman he said because God
[1:19:17] picked up he he picks up Genesis 3. He
[1:19:20] said because they they they did this
[1:19:22] I'll put enmity between your seed and
[1:19:25] the serpent seed. Is that right? And the
[1:19:27] woman doesn't have any seed. He said did
[1:19:29] you ever think of that? He said she has
[1:19:32] a field not a seed. You see the serpent
[1:19:35] had already placed his seed there. Then
[1:19:38] if the woman doesn't have a seed, she's
[1:19:40] got to remain to have a seed. So the
[1:19:43] woman does not produce a seed, she
[1:19:46] simply just receives it. She puts
[1:19:48] herself in line of receiving that seed
[1:19:51] through the bidding ground of the word
[1:19:53] of God. I love what the prophet said. He
[1:19:55] said he bred this one to that one to
[1:19:58] this one to that one until he got
[1:20:00] exactly what it wanted. He said that's
[1:20:02] how he comes down. You see, he bred this
[1:20:05] one to that one. You don't understand
[1:20:06] how you got here. I heard the brothers
[1:20:09] talking about how this family member
[1:20:10] came and how this family member came and
[1:20:13] all of a sudden God's got evening like
[1:20:14] tabernacle. He's got it completely
[1:20:16] together. What was it? It was God
[1:20:18] bringing out exactly from perfection to
[1:20:21] perfection, from glory to glory. He said
[1:20:24] that's the way that the church goes. You
[1:20:27] see, because God was building a field.
[1:20:32] Yeah. Now in Joseph meeting his
[1:20:34] brethren, the prophet said, "Now notice
[1:20:37] as soon as God seen that seed of the
[1:20:39] woman, how they had been misconstrued
[1:20:41] there." He said, "And righteousness had
[1:20:44] been perverted." And God gave a promise
[1:20:47] that through that woman would come a
[1:20:48] blessed seed. You get it? He said,
[1:20:50] "There would be a seed." And just as
[1:20:53] soon as Satan heard that, who was
[1:20:55] standing present? Notice as soon as he
[1:20:59] said it, Satan was standing present. As
[1:21:02] soon as he heard it, he took in to
[1:21:05] destroy that seed. And he tried to do it
[1:21:08] in Joseph. He tried to do it all through
[1:21:10] the ages. And he's still against that
[1:21:14] blessed seed. You see, what he what is
[1:21:16] the prophet saying is that Satan is
[1:21:19] trying to stop that royal seed from
[1:21:21] coming. He's trying to stop the son of
[1:21:23] man from ministering to the bride of
[1:21:26] Jesus Christ. He is still against that
[1:21:29] blessed seed. He was standing right
[1:21:31] there and he heard this prophecy. And as
[1:21:34] soon as he heard it, as soon as he heard
[1:21:37] it, he tried to go in there and
[1:21:40] misconstrue it and stop that blessed
[1:21:42] seed. I say that same devil's still
[1:21:45] after you. I say he's after our young
[1:21:47] people. I say he's after our ministries.
[1:21:50] There's never been a time throughout the
[1:21:52] ages that Satan has attacked the
[1:21:55] ministry of the son of man like this
[1:21:57] hour. The ministry is under the greatest
[1:22:00] attack. The layman are under the
[1:22:01] greatest attack. Why? Because Satan
[1:22:04] realizes that there is a seed, there is
[1:22:06] a predestinated seed, the spoken word of
[1:22:09] God that he cannot stop. And if he could
[1:22:12] stop message preachers from preaching,
[1:22:15] if he could stop message preachers from
[1:22:17] preaching hands, laying hands on the
[1:22:19] sick, then he might get it stopped. If
[1:22:21] he could stop them from preaching a
[1:22:22] truth, then he might get it stopped. But
[1:22:25] as long as I'm alive,
[1:22:29] as long as I'm alive, as long as there
[1:22:32] is a weapon, as long as God has ordained
[1:22:34] us, then we are called to preach the
[1:22:37] message. Yeah. Brother Brandon was asked
[1:22:39] a question and question and answers on
[1:22:41] his heels. He said, "Would the bride of
[1:22:43] Christ," he said, "Would the bride of
[1:22:45] Christ have a ministry before the
[1:22:47] rapture?"
[1:22:50] Sure. That's what's going on right now.
[1:22:53] That's what's going on right now. The
[1:22:55] bride of Christ, he said it is the
[1:22:57] message of the hour, the bride of
[1:23:00] Christ. That's what's going on right
[1:23:02] now. You see why Satan is trying to stop
[1:23:05] you to stop this field from getting to
[1:23:07] this spoken word is because that's
[1:23:09] what's going on right now. He's trying
[1:23:12] to stop the field.
[1:23:16] She consists of apostles, prophets,
[1:23:18] teachers, evangels, and pastors. That's
[1:23:20] the bride of Christ. We realize that the
[1:23:23] hour that you and I are living in that
[1:23:25] we're living in the lapover. That there
[1:23:28] we re recognize from the Philadelphia to
[1:23:30] the Lelay Oyssey church age that it was
[1:23:32] a lapover that the prophet taught us.
[1:23:35] That there in the scriptures in
[1:23:36] Revelations 3 and 8 that I know thy
[1:23:39] works. Behold, I've set before thee an
[1:23:42] open door. We realize that the hour that
[1:23:44] you and I are living in is the greatest
[1:23:46] hour because there has been given the
[1:23:49] ability to the bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:23:52] every minister of this age. An open
[1:23:55] door, a revelation to give strength, a
[1:23:58] revelation. It has given us an
[1:24:00] illumination to know there's been no
[1:24:02] other time like this time in this open
[1:24:04] door revelation to preach the name of
[1:24:06] Jesus Christ. That not only is our is he
[1:24:09] our savior, but he is our lord. He's not
[1:24:12] only alpha, but he is omega. It was not
[1:24:15] in any other time, but in this time that
[1:24:18] we recognize that he's both Lord and
[1:24:21] Christ. But you watch the enemy come in
[1:24:24] there and try to tear down the power of
[1:24:27] that name. But the prophet said once and
[1:24:30] for all the revelation of the godhead
[1:24:32] his is back. The true church can build
[1:24:35] in strength again after all this time.
[1:24:38] She finally knows who her Lord is. Once
[1:24:41] again, we're baptizing in that name of
[1:24:44] Jesus Christ just as they did at
[1:24:46] Pentecost.
[1:24:48] I don't know about these brothers, but I
[1:24:49] count it such an honor to be standing
[1:24:51] right here in this hour to recognize
[1:24:53] that you and I that these brothers have
[1:24:56] been given an ability, an opportunity to
[1:24:58] minister an open revelation. We don't
[1:25:01] have a closed book. We don't have a
[1:25:03] closed revelation, but we know who our
[1:25:05] Lord is. We know where our power comes
[1:25:07] from. We know where our ability comes
[1:25:09] from. You see, just like Moses in that
[1:25:12] day with that rod in his hand, if the
[1:25:14] Egyptians could ever get that out of his
[1:25:16] hand, the Egyptians would have whipped
[1:25:18] him. And if they if Satan can ever get
[1:25:21] the name of Jesus Christ out of the
[1:25:23] mouth of the believing church, then
[1:25:25] he'll stop the church. But I say, you
[1:25:28] showed up too late.
[1:25:30] We've already got a revelation. And the
[1:25:33] secret things belong unto the Lord. But
[1:25:35] the things which are
[1:25:37] revealed belong unto us. Satan didn't
[1:25:41] realize what he was doing.
[1:25:43] He didn't realize what he was doing. But
[1:25:45] there has been given a church an
[1:25:48] ability, a power to withstand the attack
[1:25:51] of the enemy. What are you saying,
[1:25:53] brother Andrew? I'm saying this that if
[1:25:55] you preach the message of Jesus Christ,
[1:25:58] if you preach the open door, if you
[1:26:00] preach this revelation, the gates of
[1:26:02] hell will be against you.
[1:26:04] They will be against you. They will be
[1:26:07] against you. But they'll never shut that
[1:26:09] door. They'll never shut that open door.
[1:26:12] They'll never shut the revelation of who
[1:26:14] Jesus Christ is off to the church of the
[1:26:16] living God. Because we realize that of
[1:26:19] whatever we have need of is already in
[1:26:21] him. It's already in him. He declares
[1:26:25] and he reveals himself in a seven
[1:26:27] compound name in Jehovah that we realize
[1:26:30] that the prophet said his attitude
[1:26:33] towards the people from Eden was wrapped
[1:26:35] up in them seven redemptive names. Is
[1:26:38] that right? He is Jehovah Gyra, the Lord
[1:26:41] that provides. He is Jehovah Rafa, the
[1:26:43] Lord that heals. He is Jehovah Ni, the
[1:26:46] Lord our banner. He is Jehovah Shalom,
[1:26:49] the Lord our peace. He is Jehovah Rah,
[1:26:52] the Lord my shepherd. He is Jehovah
[1:26:54] Tiskanu, the Lord my righteousness. He
[1:26:56] is Jehovah Sam. The Lord is present. He
[1:27:00] is Jehovah Shama. And he ain't backing
[1:27:02] away. He's right here. He's the same
[1:27:04] yesterday, today, and forever. If you
[1:27:06] need healing, I say let the attacks
[1:27:09] come, but God is our healer. Let the
[1:27:12] attacks of sickness come, but God is our
[1:27:14] healer. Let troubles come. Let defeats
[1:27:17] come, but God is our victory.
[1:27:21] Satan, you done messed up because there
[1:27:23] is a people that have caught the
[1:27:25] revelation of the son of man. She knows
[1:27:27] what's been given to her. She knows what
[1:27:28] she's called for. She's not backing off.
[1:27:31] She's not giving up. She's not turning
[1:27:33] around, but she's standing right here on
[1:27:36] the revelation of who Jesus Christ is.
[1:27:39] So, Satan, attack all you want to. We
[1:27:41] got a message to take us all the way
[1:27:44] through.
[1:27:48] What are you saying? I'm saying that
[1:27:49] Satan will attack you, but God will
[1:27:51] defend you.
[1:27:53] I'm saying that Satan may accuse you,
[1:27:54] but Jesus will be your advocate. I'm
[1:27:57] saying Satan might try to destroy you,
[1:27:59] but God will build you up. Satan might
[1:28:01] wound you, but God will heal you. I say
[1:28:03] every demon that might be attacking the
[1:28:05] church of the living God has got to bow
[1:28:07] to the name of the most high God. I say
[1:28:10] oppression's got to bow. Depression's
[1:28:12] got to bow. Darkness has got to bow.
[1:28:14] Satan has to bow. Cancer has to bow.
[1:28:17] Sugar diabetes has to bow. Autism has to
[1:28:20] bow. Varicose veins have to bow. Trump
[1:28:23] has to bow. Biden has to bow. Putin has
[1:28:27] to bow. And Satan himself has to bow to
[1:28:31] the name of Jesus Christ. You're not
[1:28:33] getting this name. You're not getting it
[1:28:36] out of our mouth. You're not getting out
[1:28:38] of a praise. You're not getting it out
[1:28:40] of a worship. The name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:43] has the ability to set you free.
[1:28:46] Hallelujah.
[1:28:49] Hallelujah.
[1:28:51] You watch in ancient ancient times that
[1:28:54] the enemy would come in. And when you
[1:28:57] start watching in the Roman and Assyrian
[1:29:00] age, you begin to watch that they would
[1:29:02] come in there and they would go in there
[1:29:04] to attack that field after they had come
[1:29:07] in there and conquered. And the reason
[1:29:09] why they did that, they would take they
[1:29:11] would go in and attack this field. And
[1:29:14] they would after they had won their
[1:29:15] victory, they would go in and cast salt
[1:29:18] on the ground, the fields. They would do
[1:29:21] that simply to keep the ground from ever
[1:29:26] regaining its strength to produce a
[1:29:29] crop.
[1:29:32] Hallelujah. They were attacking the
[1:29:34] fields with
[1:29:39] salt. You got a brother that was like
[1:29:43] that and his name was
[1:29:46] Shamgar. Hallelujah. The enemy came in
[1:29:49] there. Where did he come in? He didn't
[1:29:50] come in any other time. The enemy knows
[1:29:52] when to come in. The enemy knows when to
[1:29:55] whip you, try to come in there and whip
[1:29:56] you. The enemy knows that when you're at
[1:29:58] your weakest, he knows that when you're
[1:29:59] in that the greatest of times of
[1:30:01] victories. You notice where the bride of
[1:30:03] Jesus Christ is. She is in one of the
[1:30:06] greatest cycles of victories that she's
[1:30:08] ever been. But you watch where Satan is
[1:30:09] attacking her at. He is attacking her
[1:30:12] upon her strength. Come on, somebody. He
[1:30:15] is attacking her on her strength. And
[1:30:17] Shandar had went through the cycles of
[1:30:20] the enemy coming in there of cycles of
[1:30:22] revival and death. He'd watched the
[1:30:24] enemy come in there, the Philistines,
[1:30:26] come in there and take away his harvest
[1:30:27] and take away his joy. He watched his
[1:30:30] children suffering and they was
[1:30:32] suffering oppression and suffering with
[1:30:34] dirty dirty things on the internet. He
[1:30:36] was suffering with all kinds of things.
[1:30:38] But Shamgar had come to a position in
[1:30:41] his life that he recognized that these
[1:30:43] attacks was against his en from his
[1:30:45] enemy. But all of a sudden one day he
[1:30:49] come to a moment that one day he
[1:30:51] recognized that he was a son of Abraham
[1:30:54] that he was under the same commission
[1:30:56] that he was under the same covenant. And
[1:30:58] that Shamgar began to recognize he had
[1:31:00] the ability that what God had deposited
[1:31:03] on the inside of his field had been
[1:31:05] given him the ability to conquer every
[1:31:07] felistine because the scripture said if
[1:31:10] want to put a flight a th00and to 10,000
[1:31:13] and the enemy showed up with 600. It was
[1:31:16] not enough to stop Shamgar. Where did he
[1:31:19] come to him in the middle of harvest
[1:31:21] time? Where is the enemy attacking you
[1:31:23] at? Come on, somebody. He ain't
[1:31:26] attacking you on your reading your
[1:31:27] Bible. He's not attacking you out there
[1:31:29] going and socializing with the world. He
[1:31:31] attacked you on the message
[1:31:34] because he knows that if he can ever get
[1:31:36] this message out of your mind, out of
[1:31:38] your soul, then he's got you whipped.
[1:31:42] Glory to God.
[1:31:44] You're not going to be able to stand
[1:31:46] withstand this enemy, just your own DNA.
[1:31:50] But it's going to take a special gene to
[1:31:53] whip this enemy.
[1:31:56] I was born in a great family. I was born
[1:31:59] in a powerful family and I I recognize
[1:32:02] them as powerful. Great lineage in the
[1:32:05] message. But that didn't save me.
[1:32:09] Just because my granddaddies and my
[1:32:11] granddaddies were sp were were Spencers
[1:32:13] and Frasers that preached the message of
[1:32:14] the hour, that didn't give me the
[1:32:16] ability to withstand the attack of the
[1:32:18] enemy. My natural DNA does not give me
[1:32:21] the ability. But what God deposited
[1:32:24] before the foundation of the world has
[1:32:26] given me ability to withstand every
[1:32:28] attack, every influence of hell. And I
[1:32:31] say this that Satan will never have
[1:32:33] enough to stop the gene seed of God.
[1:32:35] Amen.
[1:32:37] You see what what God has deposited that
[1:32:40] heavenly gene seed, it'll conquer your
[1:32:43] mortality and it'll ush you right in to
[1:32:46] eternal life. You watch what brother
[1:32:48] Brandham when brother Brandham comes in
[1:32:49] the last five services of his ministry.
[1:32:53] He comes in there and he is heavily
[1:32:54] laboring on these thoughts of lacing in
[1:32:58] into the field the gene seed of God.
[1:33:00] that the gene seed of God is has the
[1:33:03] ability to create sons and daughters of
[1:33:05] God. What was it? Malachi 4's mouth was
[1:33:08] getting ready to be stopped. But here he
[1:33:11] was sewing a seed into this field that
[1:33:14] it could reap a harvest for the son of
[1:33:16] man. You see this Malachi 4 seed, it'll
[1:33:19] it'll produce a Revelations 10 8-11
[1:33:22] people. a people that will receive the
[1:33:24] word of the hour and not just give them
[1:33:28] a word but give them power.
[1:33:34] What Paul say? This gospel came unto me
[1:33:36] not only in word only but in power. Now
[1:33:40] notice what the prophet said in spoken
[1:33:41] word is the original seed. He said the
[1:33:43] power of the believing church. Christ
[1:33:45] has got all power on earth. He said do
[1:33:48] you believe that? And the congregation
[1:33:50] said, "Now, what if he's in you?" Now,
[1:33:54] here's a question. What if is what if
[1:33:56] he's in you? Has Christ got all power?
[1:34:02] Has Christ got all power? Matthew 28:18
[1:34:06] says, "He is a seed word in his body. He
[1:34:10] is in us becomes a seed word in us. All
[1:34:13] that God was, he poured into Christ. And
[1:34:16] all that Christ was, he poured into the
[1:34:18] church. So every ability that the son
[1:34:22] have, then the bride has. If there was
[1:34:25] healing in the son, then there's healing
[1:34:27] in the bride.
[1:34:29] If there was casting out of devils in
[1:34:32] the sun, then it's in the bride. Is that
[1:34:33] right? So Satan was there in the
[1:34:37] beginning in Genesis 1 when God said,
[1:34:40] "Let there be light." Satan is standing
[1:34:43] there real close and he's watching God
[1:34:46] in his power. We realize that through
[1:34:49] the word of faith that these the
[1:34:52] universe the earth was fully manifested
[1:34:55] by the word of God. Things that were
[1:34:58] visible were made by the
[1:35:01] invisible. And Satan is right
[1:35:05] there and he's watching this transpire.
[1:35:09] Brother Brandham would say that if
[1:35:11] before God was
[1:35:13] God, he had to create angels to be God,
[1:35:16] to be an object of
[1:35:18] worship. So God creates Lucifer, all of
[1:35:22] his angels, all the thousands and
[1:35:25] millions of angels. And there he is in
[1:35:28] his creation. Brother Brandon would
[1:35:30] title
[1:35:32] Lucifer as the co-equal in heaven, that
[1:35:35] he had all the abilities except to
[1:35:38] create, but his ability is simply to
[1:35:41] pervert what God has already spoken. So
[1:35:45] Lucifer is standing there and he's
[1:35:48] watching this power. He's watching God
[1:35:50] as he takes and he begins to speak a
[1:35:53] word. It comes from his mind and then he
[1:35:56] sends it out there and he rolls it out
[1:35:58] across his fingertips. Brother man said
[1:36:00] he sent it out there maybe a hundred
[1:36:02] million years and it just stopped it in
[1:36:04] the right spot. He held it right there
[1:36:07] and Lucifer is watching. Lucifer is
[1:36:11] seeing this now. The prophet said in the
[1:36:14] earnest earnestly contending for the
[1:36:16] faith he said notice how from the
[1:36:18] beginning Satan has been so close. He
[1:36:21] said, 'A lot of people say today, "Oh,
[1:36:22] brother Brandham, do you think that
[1:36:24] communism is awful?" He said, 'Yes, it's
[1:36:26] awful, but that's not the Antichrist.
[1:36:28] No, sir. Jesus said that the Antichrist
[1:36:30] would be so close like the real that it
[1:36:33] would deceive the very elect if it was
[1:36:35] possible. He said it's religious people.
[1:36:37] He said that's where it comes in. So,
[1:36:39] Satan is this close. He's this close. If
[1:36:43] this is the true, thus sayaith the Lord,
[1:36:45] then Satan is real close. He's watching
[1:36:48] this. You can imagine as William
[1:36:50] Brandham is up there in sportsman hollow
[1:36:53] and he's fighting off he's fighting off
[1:36:55] these ideas. He's he's standing there
[1:36:56] and he's woring is this in the scripture
[1:36:59] is what we read about is what we read
[1:37:02] about in Mark 11 is it under the
[1:37:05] atonement? And he stands there and all
[1:37:07] of a sudden these things are sovereignly
[1:37:09] given him and the voice speaks to him.
[1:37:11] You know the story. He said, "What are
[1:37:13] you hunting?" He said, "Squirrels, how
[1:37:14] many would you like?" He tells him
[1:37:16] three. You've got to recognize that that
[1:37:19] same Lucifer was standing right there
[1:37:22] and he watched this son of man. He
[1:37:24] watched this man as he's standing there
[1:37:27] all of a sudden he speaks. He speaks and
[1:37:30] there's a squirrel and there's a
[1:37:32] squirrel and there's a squirrel. He's
[1:37:35] got to recognize that that same power
[1:37:37] that he saw all the way in the beginning
[1:37:40] is now standing right there in human
[1:37:43] flesh. The word was made flesh and
[1:37:46] dwelts amongst us. And Satan is this
[1:37:48] close. He's watching it.
[1:37:52] But I'll say this, he didn't just leave
[1:37:54] it there.
[1:37:56] He didn't just leave it there. There
[1:37:58] were some people that was fellowshipping
[1:38:00] around some squirrels and they were
[1:38:02] sitting there talking about it and there
[1:38:03] was a little bitty woman of faith said,
[1:38:05] "How can these things be, brother
[1:38:08] Random?" And he started telling her how
[1:38:10] it could be. He started speaking these
[1:38:12] things exactly how they happened. And
[1:38:14] that little woman of faith said, "That's
[1:38:16] nothing but the truth."
[1:38:19] I say Satan was standing real close when
[1:38:22] he watched a little bitty wash woman
[1:38:24] that didn't have a no value to her name.
[1:38:26] Didn't have a penny to her name, but she
[1:38:29] took a hold of the spoken word.
[1:38:33] I say Satan didn't have enough to stop
[1:38:35] her from speaking thus sayith the Lord.
[1:38:37] That's nothing but the truth. And I say
[1:38:39] Satan ain't got enough to stop you. I
[1:38:42] say he ain't got enough for our young
[1:38:43] people. He ain't got enough for our
[1:38:45] ladies. He ain't got enough for our
[1:38:46] brothers.
[1:38:48] I say he ain't got enough for you mamas
[1:38:50] that are still praying for your prodals.
[1:38:54] I say he ain't got enough to stop our
[1:38:56] daddies from calling that order back to
[1:38:58] their home and believing the message
[1:39:00] again. He does not have enough. All
[1:39:02] you've got to do is get in harmony.
[1:39:05] Hallelujah. like little had he got in
[1:39:07] harmony with thus sayaith the Lord and
[1:39:09] she'd said that's nothing but a truth
[1:39:12] give her whatever she wants to what
[1:39:14] would happen in this place if God said
[1:39:16] give her what she wants to what would
[1:39:19] you ask for what would you call down
[1:39:21] from heaven I say the same power that
[1:39:24] was in heaven is now on earth in a bride
[1:39:27] body and Satan cannot attack enough to
[1:39:32] stop you from believing
[1:39:36] It ain't going to be some man that does
[1:39:38] it. It's going to be your faith in the
[1:39:40] son of God that you believe that he's
[1:39:42] still able. He's still more powerful.
[1:39:49] And Satan is relentless in his
[1:39:53] mission of tempting and lying and
[1:39:56] cheating and twisting. And he's always
[1:39:58] trying to hinder that that power of that
[1:40:01] spoken word.
[1:40:04] I love this prophet said, "Has the Lord
[1:40:07] spoken only in Moses?" God never
[1:40:10] changes. His power is just the same as
[1:40:13] it was before the creation of time. God
[1:40:17] made and spoke in the beginning was the
[1:40:19] word and the word was with God. And the
[1:40:22] word was God. That's in the beginning
[1:40:24] the word. This word was made flesh and
[1:40:27] dwelt amongst us. The word returned in
[1:40:31] the spirit again and living amongst men
[1:40:33] tonight. Just the same living God
[1:40:36] throughout the ages. And his word
[1:40:38] tonight is just as effective in the
[1:40:41] heart of a believer as it was when it
[1:40:43] was spoken in the beginning. His word in
[1:40:47] the believer is as powerful as it was
[1:40:50] when it was spoken in the beginning. It
[1:40:51] never varies from it course. It'll move
[1:40:54] on. It's a constant relay chain. And
[1:40:56] Satan has craved after that power ever
[1:40:59] since it was spoken there at the Garden
[1:41:01] of Eden. Wherever that spoken word is,
[1:41:04] God is standing right there to manifest
[1:41:07] his power. But Satan is standing right
[1:41:09] there, too. He's standing there to try
[1:41:11] to capture that word before it gets to
[1:41:13] your heart so that you'll believe it.
[1:41:15] And he's going to try to interpret it
[1:41:17] just like he interpreted to Eve.
[1:41:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But God don't
[1:41:25] need no interpreter. His word, he simply
[1:41:29] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:41:31] pass. If he said that you would be there
[1:41:35] and your offspring with them, you don't
[1:41:37] need no devil to interpret that. If God
[1:41:40] said by his stripes you are healed, you
[1:41:42] don't need some devil to interpret that
[1:41:44] to you. You don't need to tell some You
[1:41:46] don't need some devil to tell you that
[1:41:48] you ain't healed. You don't need some
[1:41:50] devil to tell you that you ain't good
[1:41:52] enough. God is the interpreter of his
[1:41:54] word and he interprets it by bringing it
[1:41:57] to pass. Yeah, you may have been no
[1:41:59] good. Yeah, you may have had a bad mama.
[1:42:02] Yeah, you may have had a bad diet. But
[1:42:04] God interprets his word by bringing it
[1:42:07] to pass. And this hour in this
[1:42:09] generation, you've been given an
[1:42:11] abstract title deed. Your mama may have
[1:42:14] been a drunk. Your daddy may have been
[1:42:16] alcoholic. Your mama being been a
[1:42:18] prostitute. But God rich in mercy.
[1:42:22] gave you an abstract title deed that
[1:42:24] everything that was against you has been
[1:42:27] struck off.
[1:42:29] I say you're justified as if you never
[1:42:31] done it in the first place. You can
[1:42:33] attack my past, but it's over. You can
[1:42:36] attack my mind, but it's over. You can
[1:42:38] attack my spirit, but it's over. You can
[1:42:41] attack my soul, but I'm already
[1:42:44] sealed. You can try to stop the message,
[1:42:46] but it's already been sold.
[1:42:49] I've got a word from heaven and I'm not
[1:42:51] backing off of it.
[1:42:55] Attack what you want to, but God is my
[1:42:57] defender.
[1:43:03] One man said he always had a
[1:43:06] man. God always had a man that he could
[1:43:08] trust. He said it's been a relay
[1:43:11] chain. has been a relay chain from Adam
[1:43:14] to Noah to Noah to Abraham to Moses to
[1:43:17] the prophets to Jesus to the apostles
[1:43:19] and now to the end time bride under a
[1:43:22] final message running with everything
[1:43:25] within them. And Satan's been watching
[1:43:28] that. He's been watching that relay.
[1:43:30] He's been watching that transfer of
[1:43:33] fire because he realized if he can stop
[1:43:36] you from getting to a birth,
[1:43:41] Wow. You see where Satan comes in and
[1:43:44] attacks so hard against a new birth?
[1:43:49] I'll be honest. You watch Satan, I'll
[1:43:52] tell you this message didn't come in
[1:43:53] here to reform you. This message came
[1:43:55] here to transform you.
[1:43:58] You're not going to stay the same way
[1:43:59] when you come under the the come under
[1:44:01] the opaces of the Holy Ghost. But this
[1:44:04] message is going to change you. It's
[1:44:06] going to birth you. And what is he
[1:44:07] trying to do? He's trying to stop that
[1:44:09] personal that personal experience with
[1:44:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You watch
[1:44:14] under the Old Testament the attacks on
[1:44:16] the field of Abraham. He come in there
[1:44:18] and he attacked him through famine. He
[1:44:21] come in there and attacked him and
[1:44:23] Pharaoh was interested in his wife. He
[1:44:25] attacked him with strife between his
[1:44:26] herdsman and Lot's herdsman. What the
[1:44:29] enemy's goal was was to distract Abraham
[1:44:32] to defide and derail the blessing. But
[1:44:35] God was rich in mercy. Moses and the
[1:44:38] children of Israel in the Exodus, you
[1:44:41] see that Moses was leading that
[1:44:42] Israelites through the wilderness and
[1:44:45] the people were constantly attacked
[1:44:47] through murmuring and complaining and
[1:44:48] rebellion of Kora and to believe the
[1:44:51] sign and idolatries of of the of
[1:44:55] Hallelujah of golden calves. What was
[1:44:57] the enemy's goal? to sew in disobedience
[1:45:00] and to sew in distrust in what the
[1:45:02] prophet had already said to prevent them
[1:45:05] from reaching the promised land. But
[1:45:07] there was a Joshua and a Caleb that no
[1:45:10] matter what you said about the message,
[1:45:12] no matter how you criticize the message,
[1:45:15] they were still going in because there
[1:45:17] was something on the inside of them,
[1:45:18] Brother Weaton, that but they were going
[1:45:20] in. They could talk about the move of
[1:45:22] the Holy Ghost, but they were still
[1:45:24] going on. They could talk about laying
[1:45:26] on hands of the sick and they were still
[1:45:27] going in. They could talk about
[1:45:29] deliverances were no longer to the
[1:45:30] church, but they were still going in.
[1:45:33] There was nothing going to stop them
[1:45:34] because Joshua was under commission to
[1:45:37] divide the inheritance.
[1:45:40] He didn't have to preach a new message.
[1:45:42] He simply had to say what the prophet
[1:45:45] said.
[1:45:46] I'm so thankful that I ain't got to
[1:45:48] recreate the wheel, but just preach what
[1:45:50] William Brandon preached. And there's
[1:45:52] power behind it. Amen.
[1:45:56] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:45:59] What are you saying, brother Angel? I'm
[1:46:01] saying this. Satan showed up too late.
[1:46:07] He showed up too late. Brother Sammy
[1:46:09] showed up too late. He tried to stop
[1:46:11] you, but God God rich in mercy. He tried
[1:46:15] to hinderage you, but God rich in mercy.
[1:46:17] Satan tried to afflict you, but God rich
[1:46:20] in mercy. Because God knows what he's
[1:46:22] deposited. And what he's deposited has
[1:46:25] the ability to transform itself into
[1:46:28] what God said it would be.
[1:46:33] That God is obligated to take care of
[1:46:36] that seed.
[1:46:39] You believe that? He's obligated to take
[1:46:42] care of that seed. He swed a message
[1:46:45] seed, then he's going to take care of
[1:46:47] it.
[1:46:50] Don't get upset because the way your
[1:46:51] field
[1:46:55] looks. Don't get upset because of the
[1:46:57] circumstances that have caused your
[1:46:59] field to be
[1:47:02] dry. God knows what he's depositing.
[1:47:06] Parents, don't you get upset because the
[1:47:09] way the field looks in your young
[1:47:10] people. God knows what he's depositing.
[1:47:13] You just keep applying that token. You
[1:47:15] keep holding on. Don't you worry. God
[1:47:17] knows where good ground's at. And I'll
[1:47:19] tell you, God's the kind of sewer that
[1:47:21] he knows how to sew it on good ground.
[1:47:23] He knows exactly where to throw it.
[1:47:25] There might be some men that cast here
[1:47:27] and there, but God is the kind of sewer
[1:47:29] that he ain't just aimlessly throwing
[1:47:31] out it. He ain't just aim throwing out
[1:47:34] predestinated seed and hoping they land
[1:47:35] here and hoping they land there. He
[1:47:37] knows exactly where he deposited them.
[1:47:39] We did not become seed by the rebirth.
[1:47:42] We were seed, therefore, we could be
[1:47:44] reborn. Don't you get upset about the
[1:47:46] field. God knows what he deposited. And
[1:47:49] God is obligated to take care of what he
[1:47:52] deposited. Brother Man said, "If you
[1:47:54] want cucumbers, plant cucumbers." He
[1:47:57] said, "But if you want a church, build
[1:47:59] on the church, then sew the word." I
[1:48:02] say, "Let's build our churches on thus
[1:48:04] sayaith the Lord." Satan might be scared
[1:48:07] of the seed, but God knows what's there.
[1:48:12] You see that seed, it carries with it a
[1:48:15] power,
[1:48:18] a future
[1:48:22] power. I've always thought this not a
[1:48:25] very good I'm not a very good farmer. I
[1:48:28] was born in family of farmers. Does not
[1:48:30] make me a farmer. You want to watch
[1:48:32] something die, just watch me go out
[1:48:34] there and build a garden. One, I don't
[1:48:37] have good ground.
[1:48:40] If you want to if you want some rocks,
[1:48:42] come to Augusta County,
[1:48:45] Virginia. Well, you want to watch
[1:48:47] something die, you come up here on our
[1:48:49] ground. Cuz ain't no good ground up
[1:48:52] there. Well, you want to watch something
[1:48:55] live, come under this message.
[1:48:59] Ain't nothing but good ground under this
[1:49:01] message.
[1:49:02] And Satan realizes that that seed
[1:49:04] carries a future power with it. So, he's
[1:49:07] watching that seed. He realizes that you
[1:49:11] you know that when a seed is first sewn,
[1:49:13] you don't fully see the manifestation of
[1:49:14] what it truly is. And Satan looks at it
[1:49:17] and well, it don't really look very
[1:49:19] dangerous at all. It's it's small. It's
[1:49:21] weak. It's vulnerable. They're young.
[1:49:22] They they're going through the trials of
[1:49:24] their life. They're they don't really
[1:49:26] they don't know which way they're going.
[1:49:27] They haven't found their way yet, but
[1:49:29] they're they're still coming acts I'm
[1:49:30] not really worried about. But what he
[1:49:33] doesn't realize is on the inside of that
[1:49:34] seed is a future power to destroy
[1:49:38] Satan's kingdom.
[1:49:40] He realizes, hallelujah, inside of you,
[1:49:43] if I want you, if you can recognize one
[1:49:45] thing from this message, that on the
[1:49:47] inside of you is the ability to cast
[1:49:49] down every stronghold of Satan. You
[1:49:52] might look weak. You might feel
[1:49:54] vulnerable. You might be going through
[1:49:55] the trial of your life, but God knows
[1:49:57] what he's deposited.
[1:50:00] and you will destroy Satan's kingdom.
[1:50:04] Satan knows that if he lets that seed
[1:50:07] mature that it will defeat him and
[1:50:10] destroy him. So if he recognizes the
[1:50:13] power that's there, he's going to try to
[1:50:15] kill it. You know, I always wondered I I
[1:50:18] I wasn't always a message believer. I
[1:50:20] grew up in a message home. I'm so
[1:50:22] thankful for my dad, but I wasn't always
[1:50:24] a message believer. I grew up underneath
[1:50:26] of it. I heard it all my life. But until
[1:50:29] I was changed, until I was birthed, and
[1:50:32] I always when I read the Bible, I always
[1:50:36] wondered, I always wondered till I come
[1:50:40] to this message, why did Satan attack
[1:50:43] certain ones more than he did
[1:50:47] others? And then I come to the message
[1:50:50] and then I found out the reason is
[1:50:53] because there's a value behind that
[1:50:54] person.
[1:50:56] You look at the life of Job, I love this
[1:51:00] that Job in the message Job Brandon
[1:51:02] said, "One day Satan come up there
[1:51:04] before God and said before the before
[1:51:07] the sons of God and said, "Have you
[1:51:09] considered my servant Job a just man,
[1:51:12] perfect, none like him in the earth?" He
[1:51:14] said, "Oh, sure." He said, "You're
[1:51:15] giving him everything he wants. You got
[1:51:17] him all hedged up and everything." Said,
[1:51:19] "No wonder." Said, "Sure, he can serve
[1:51:21] you. making plenty of money, getting
[1:51:23] plenty of cattle, got everything in
[1:51:25] life. Sure, anybody can serve you like
[1:51:28] that. He said, "But if you'll let me
[1:51:30] have him, I'll make him curse you to
[1:51:33] your
[1:51:34] face." I love what Brother Brandham
[1:51:36] said. Here's a prophet. And he captures
[1:51:40] the mind of God. God said, "I don't
[1:51:42] believe it."
[1:51:45] Man, I'll tell you what, God's got
[1:51:47] confidence in his seed.
[1:51:49] I always wondered why Satan attacks
[1:51:51] certain ones more than others. And then
[1:51:54] I come to the message and I seen that
[1:51:56] God has got confidence in that brother
[1:51:59] that he could send him through the trial
[1:52:01] of his life and he won't bow. He could
[1:52:05] send Daniel to a lion's den and he won't
[1:52:07] bow. He can send the three Uber children
[1:52:09] to a fiery furnace but they won't bow.
[1:52:12] He can send you in the midst of Leosa.
[1:52:15] Your brother might leave you. Your
[1:52:16] family might leave you. But you will not
[1:52:19] bow.
[1:52:22] Anybody can serve you like that, but let
[1:52:24] me touch his life. He said, you can do
[1:52:27] everything to him, but don't touch his
[1:52:29] life.
[1:52:31] God said, I got confidence in you,
[1:52:32] little bride. I'm going to send you
[1:52:34] through the worst of ages, through the
[1:52:36] trials of your life, and you're still
[1:52:38] going to come out standing.
[1:52:40] Satan may attack you. He may tempt you.
[1:52:43] He might try to defeat you, but you're
[1:52:45] still going to stand.
[1:52:48] I love the scriptures. David said in
[1:52:51] Psalms 18 86 and 17, "Show me a token
[1:52:57] for good that they which hate me may see
[1:53:00] it and be ashamed because thou hast hope
[1:53:04] in me and comforted me. Show me a token
[1:53:09] for
[1:53:10] good that they which hate me may see
[1:53:13] it because the Lord capital L O R D has
[1:53:18] hope in me. That word in the Hebrew
[1:53:22] means to
[1:53:24] surround. It means to
[1:53:27] protect. It means to
[1:53:31] secure. Just like God had Job heads
[1:53:34] up. Show me a token for good that
[1:53:39] Elohim has got me
[1:53:42] surrounded. has got me
[1:53:44] surrounded. So if you are who God says
[1:53:48] you are, then the enemy will come in in
[1:53:52] mind battles and fleshly battles. He
[1:53:55] will come in in spiritual battles and
[1:53:58] he's going to try to break down that
[1:54:00] stronghold. He's going to try to take
[1:54:02] away your defense. He's going to try to
[1:54:04] take away your strength. You notice
[1:54:07] where Satan comes in. He attacks you.
[1:54:09] And I found this when I was studying out
[1:54:11] this thought in in in the 1800s in the
[1:54:15] Texan and American West. There was
[1:54:17] ranchers that had fought over land and
[1:54:19] they was going through there and they
[1:54:20] was making their way west and there was
[1:54:22] these cattlemen that was driving up
[1:54:23] these cattle from Mexico and they was
[1:54:25] working their way up and they wanted
[1:54:27] that open range out there in the west so
[1:54:30] that they could go in there and they
[1:54:31] could drive their cattle all the way to
[1:54:33] Canada and they could get a pretty price
[1:54:34] for them. And those cattlemen come up
[1:54:36] there. And as those as those men come in
[1:54:39] there and they claim their territories,
[1:54:41] those men came in there and they started
[1:54:42] putting fences putting fences around
[1:54:45] their around their boundaries and their
[1:54:47] territories. And there was actually a a
[1:54:49] Texas fence cutting war that transplay
[1:54:53] transpired in 1880s where these
[1:54:55] cattlemen would come in there and they
[1:54:57] was driving their land. They was driving
[1:54:59] their cattle through these land and they
[1:55:01] come up against these fences and in them
[1:55:03] fences was these brothers. was their
[1:55:05] harvest in there. There was their
[1:55:07] message in there and there these
[1:55:08] cattlemen came in there and they started
[1:55:11] cutting the line. They started cutting
[1:55:13] the line and they drove their cattle
[1:55:15] through there. What were they doing?
[1:55:16] They were trampling over the harvest in
[1:55:19] that field because if they could get
[1:55:21] them if they could stop the harvest,
[1:55:23] they could drive them off of that field.
[1:55:25] They could drive them off of that
[1:55:28] field. That's what Satan is trying to do
[1:55:30] to you. He is trying to destroy your
[1:55:32] spiritual boundaries. If he can cut your
[1:55:35] line of defense to the message, if he
[1:55:37] can cut off your prayer life, if he can
[1:55:39] cut off your worship, if he can cut off
[1:55:42] thus sayaith the Lord, he can stop you
[1:55:44] from building on this land.
[1:55:47] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:55:49] I love this message. The message said
[1:55:52] that Christ has now taken himself a
[1:55:54] bride to be pregnant with his own seed
[1:55:56] word in her womb, spirit womb in her
[1:55:58] mind, and she won't mix it with any
[1:56:01] denominational trust with it. She is
[1:56:03] virgin to him. So God is going to
[1:56:06] restore the church. So this church is
[1:56:09] pregnantated with his seed that you
[1:56:12] might go through attacks. You might go
[1:56:14] through wars. But the prophet said, "You
[1:56:17] remember that old pine tree? When that
[1:56:19] first that fire hits her and it burns
[1:56:21] down, she shakes off a seed. Though that
[1:56:23] seed will bring forth a new one." So God
[1:56:27] has a purpose in the attack.
[1:56:32] He has a purpose in the attack. He has a
[1:56:35] purpose what you're going through.
[1:56:36] Because if you don't go through the
[1:56:38] fire,
[1:56:40] then you'll never release that seed and
[1:56:42] it'll never produce a new crop. But this
[1:56:45] church, I can hear a prophet say that I
[1:56:48] will restore, sayeth the Lord. But there
[1:56:52] is a church that has been spiritually
[1:56:54] birthed into the kingdom of God.
[1:57:01] I love what the prophet said. He said,
[1:57:03] "You watch Mary's womb." Mary's womb,
[1:57:07] the physical mind. She was virgin womb.
[1:57:09] Why? She believed God's word. And but
[1:57:12] first, before her mind, before the act
[1:57:14] could ever take place in her literal
[1:57:15] womb, the act had to take place in here.
[1:57:18] First to let the spirit come in and do
[1:57:21] the rest of the work. He said, "See,
[1:57:24] before the actual spiritual birth can
[1:57:26] take place, the word has to find itself
[1:57:28] through your mind. Believe it. He that
[1:57:30] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:57:32] that sent me hath eternal life." So the
[1:57:36] church is pregnantated with a word of
[1:57:39] power. And Satan is battling against
[1:57:42] that seed and trying to hinder that
[1:57:45] field. He tried to stop it in Job, but
[1:57:47] he didn't have enough power. He tried to
[1:57:50] stop it in Daniel, but it didn't have
[1:57:51] enough power. He tried to crucify Jesus,
[1:57:54] but it didn't have enough power. And God
[1:57:57] has sown his seed. And now this bride
[1:58:00] has been pregnantated with thus sayaith
[1:58:02] the Lord. And I say this that Satan is
[1:58:06] trying to stop everything that he can
[1:58:08] from that seed from getting sown. But
[1:58:10] the prophet said in the invisible union,
[1:58:12] he said, "You see that church, she's
[1:58:15] pregnantated with something because
[1:58:16] she's always bringing forth members all
[1:58:18] the time. She don't want none of them
[1:58:20] screaming, hollering, blabbering Acts
[1:58:22] 238 miserable creatures that she thinks
[1:58:24] that they are. It would certainly
[1:58:26] embarrass her. It would ruin her and her
[1:58:28] educated, ethical, scientific society
[1:58:31] that she belonged to there. They would
[1:58:33] throw her out at the next church
[1:58:35] council. She can't have it. She don't
[1:58:38] want none of them pregnant with the
[1:58:39] word. But that's the only kind that the
[1:58:42] word can bring forth. The word kind will
[1:58:46] be produce a word bride. She don't want
[1:58:49] any of that kind. She don't want none of
[1:58:51] them screaming, hollering, but that's
[1:58:53] the only kind the word can produce. She
[1:58:55] don't want none of them that shout, but
[1:58:57] that's the only kind that the word can
[1:58:59] produce. She don't want none of them
[1:59:01] that can lay hands on the sick, but
[1:59:03] that's the only kind that the word can
[1:59:05] produce. She don't want none of them
[1:59:07] that can cast out devils in the name of
[1:59:09] Jesus Christ. That's the only kind that
[1:59:12] the word can produce. She don't want any
[1:59:14] of them that'll take up serpents and
[1:59:16] tread over top of them. But that's the
[1:59:18] only kind that the word can bring forth.
[1:59:22] She don't want none of them screaming,
[1:59:23] hollering, blabbering. Acts 2:38,
[1:59:25] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[1:59:27] are.
[1:59:29] Well, we shouldn't have no shouting in
[1:59:30] the church.
[1:59:35] Well, you know, I I had a lovely family
[1:59:38] that was in the message and they
[1:59:39] believed this message with all her
[1:59:41] heart. My grandmother, my grandmother
[1:59:44] Tinie, she she was a message believer.
[1:59:47] She was kind of the she was a kind of
[1:59:49] believer, Brother Brad, she took
[1:59:51] everything the prophet said and she
[1:59:53] started writing out checks where she
[1:59:55] said the where the prophet said that
[1:59:56] they that a believer that takes the
[1:59:58] word, they have checkbook and authority.
[2:00:00] After she passed away, we started going
[2:00:02] through her Bible and we started finding
[2:00:04] all them checks that she wrote out.
[2:00:06] There was some believers. She wrote them
[2:00:08] out, some for me, wrote some out for my
[2:00:09] family, wrote some out for me when I was
[2:00:11] in the worst of my trials. She was a
[2:00:13] message believer. And she went to a
[2:00:15] so-called message church one time. I
[2:00:17] forgive me. I'm going to preach this
[2:00:18] morning. She went to a so-called message
[2:00:20] church and all of a sudden the spirit of
[2:00:22] God got to moving in a service much like
[2:00:25] this. I tell you where where the word of
[2:00:27] God is, it'll find a real believer.
[2:00:31] And all of a sudden, she the preacher
[2:00:32] got to preaching and all of a sudden she
[2:00:34] got so under the anointing of the Holy
[2:00:36] Ghost, she stood up and started
[2:00:37] shouting, started running all over the
[2:00:39] building. And the deacons of that
[2:00:41] message church came and grabbed her by
[2:00:43] the shoulder and took her down, set her
[2:00:45] down back in her
[2:00:47] seat. She said, "What's that for?" He
[2:00:49] said, "We don't do that in this
[2:00:54] church." Wow.
[2:00:59] Well, thank God we ain't in that church
[2:01:00] this morning.
[2:01:03] And it wasn't my church. I highly
[2:01:06] disbelieve that it was this church. I
[2:01:07] know it
[2:01:11] wasn't. Lord have
[2:01:13] mercy. What'd you get me
[2:01:15] into? I know it wasn't this church. And
[2:01:18] I've shouted in this church before. I've
[2:01:21] danced in this church before. I know
[2:01:23] that this ain't kind of that kind of
[2:01:25] church that want to kick out them Acts
[2:01:26] 238 blabbering, screaming, hollering at
[2:01:29] lay miserable creatures that she thinks
[2:01:30] they are. But there was some people
[2:01:32] around the ranks of the message that
[2:01:34] didn't like that. And they said, "Well,
[2:01:36] give me some scripture about Jesus
[2:01:38] shouting." Well, I can tell you where
[2:01:40] Jesus shouted. He said, "I shout." He
[2:01:42] shouted when he seen that their names
[2:01:45] was written on the lamb's book of life.
[2:01:47] That Satan will never get to him. Yeah.
[2:01:50] Well, they said Jesus didn't shout. I
[2:01:52] beg to differ. But every single person
[2:01:55] that Jesus Christ ever touched, had a
[2:01:59] shout, had a belief, had an
[2:02:02] understanding who they
[2:02:06] were. Hallelujah. They may have attacked
[2:02:09] the seed. They may have tried to attack
[2:02:11] our worship. They may have tried to
[2:02:12] attack our praise. But God said, "I am
[2:02:15] going to restore back to her everything.
[2:02:19] I'm going to restore my truth back to
[2:02:21] her to know that she's in a right. She's
[2:02:24] got a right to worship me. She's got a
[2:02:26] right to praise me. She's got a right to
[2:02:28] dance. She's got a right to speak the
[2:02:30] word.
[2:02:32] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:02:35] Well, yeah. It should We shouldn't have
[2:02:37] We shouldn't have no standing up in
[2:02:38] church. We ought to be quiet as a church
[2:02:40] mouse.
[2:02:42] Well, you going to attack that? I'll
[2:02:43] attack you. That's right. I'm not
[2:02:46] attacking nobody. I'm just attacking the
[2:02:47] spirit. Well, we shouldn't have these
[2:02:50] young people ought to stay seated and
[2:02:51] hear the word of God. But do you know
[2:02:53] that in the book of Nehemiah, the Bible
[2:02:54] said in Nehemiah 8 and5 that when the
[2:02:57] book was open, they stood up.
[2:03:00] So, you got every right to stand up. You
[2:03:02] got every right to worship. You got
[2:03:04] every right to praise. Well, they tried
[2:03:06] to attack us and say we shouldn't have
[2:03:08] dancing in the church no more. Well, I
[2:03:09] say this. If we can go out there in the
[2:03:11] world and our young people can go out
[2:03:12] there in the world and they could dance
[2:03:14] and they could scream at a ball game,
[2:03:15] then they ought to have some rights to
[2:03:17] be able to worship God in the house of
[2:03:20] the
[2:03:21] Lord. They might attack, but God will
[2:03:25] defend. They might say that we shouldn't
[2:03:27] preach.
[2:03:32] What am I saying in this sermon?
[2:03:36] The field's under attack.
[2:03:39] and it's trying to stop what God
[2:03:41] ordained it to
[2:03:45] produce. I
[2:03:47] was I was in my study a while
[2:03:52] back and I was I was down praying for a
[2:03:58] service and I was I was down and the
[2:04:00] spirit of the Lord began to deal with me
[2:04:02] and spoke to me to go to listen to the
[2:04:04] interview of Sister
[2:04:06] Bruce. I've listened to it and you
[2:04:08] haven't if you haven't listened to it in
[2:04:10] a while, I believe it'll bless you. I
[2:04:12] listen to
[2:04:13] it. Especially when I was a young
[2:04:15] person, I wouldn't say I listen to a
[2:04:16] tape. It's only 12 minutes
[2:04:19] long. Dad, I listen to a tape
[2:04:26] today. I was down praying and the Lord
[2:04:28] just started speaking to me. Don't
[2:04:30] listen to that. So, I begin to listen to
[2:04:33] it and it's sometimes it's hard it's
[2:04:35] hard to hear it. If you go and read and
[2:04:37] listen to it, the same you you catch the
[2:04:38] anointing of it. And there, Sister Bruce
[2:04:41] is is is talking with brother Brandham.
[2:04:43] And if you ever been to Brandon
[2:04:44] Tabernacle, you you can recognize that
[2:04:46] the pull pit was here. And just right
[2:04:48] down right down this way. And over there
[2:04:51] is where Brother Brandham's office was.
[2:04:53] So, Brother Brandham's office is
[2:04:54] standing there, and he he has the
[2:04:55] ability to look out and see the pull
[2:04:57] pit. There he's having this interview
[2:04:59] with Sister Bruce. And Sister Bruce is
[2:05:01] just laboring on these thoughts. She
[2:05:02] said, "I want an
[2:05:04] experience that I've been sealed in by
[2:05:07] the Holy
[2:05:08] Ghost." And brother Maram talks to her
[2:05:10] and said, "You're a real born again
[2:05:14] believer." He said, "But Satan is
[2:05:16] present to mark you, to make you believe
[2:05:19] that you're
[2:05:21] not." He said, "God doesn't see you. He
[2:05:25] sees his son." She said, "But brother
[2:05:27] Brandham, I make so many mistakes." He
[2:05:30] said, "But that's why Christ had to die
[2:05:32] for you." He said, "Your mistakes are
[2:05:35] not lauded to you. He is your
[2:05:40] propitiation. He is your sin offering.
[2:05:43] Christ took your mistakes." She said,
[2:05:46] "But I got no experience to put my foot
[2:05:50] on, brother
[2:05:51] Brandham." He said, "You see," he said,
[2:05:54] "in your human nature." He said, "You
[2:05:56] was born in sin. You were shaped in
[2:05:58] iniquity." He said, "But you notice your
[2:06:01] nature changed." He said, "Your nature
[2:06:04] changed once." He said, "Christ changed
[2:06:07] that." She said, "Yes,
[2:06:11] sir." Now, watch a prophet. He said,
[2:06:14] "I've watched you under
[2:06:16] vision. Now, a prophet
[2:06:19] speaking. I
[2:06:21] know you're a Christian.
[2:06:25] There's not a thing wrong in your
[2:06:31] experience. And how Satan attacks our
[2:06:33] young
[2:06:34] people and says, "You've never had
[2:06:37] nothing to put your foot
[2:06:39] on." Well, it was just emotion. It was
[2:06:43] just the excitement of the building that
[2:06:45] you were in. They had the music playing
[2:06:47] just right. They had the they had the
[2:06:50] microphones and everything set and you
[2:06:52] just got under the emotion of what the
[2:06:55] building was building up to and Satan
[2:06:58] comes in and attacks you and try to take
[2:07:00] away everything that God gave to you.
[2:07:03] And before long you start believing that
[2:07:05] you've never had an
[2:07:09] experience and you got all these
[2:07:11] mistakes. I've got nothing to put my
[2:07:13] foot on.
[2:07:15] I'm sitting here and I'm listening I'm
[2:07:16] listening to this and the spirit of God
[2:07:19] says listen
[2:07:21] closely and I'll be honest as I told you
[2:07:24] I listened to it a few
[2:07:25] times and I thought how can I be such an
[2:07:29] idiot to miss
[2:07:31] it I'm sorry if I called myself idiot
[2:07:33] and that finish
[2:07:35] you know some people already
[2:07:39] thinking but I felt
[2:07:43] back like I just listen in vain
[2:07:46] sometimes and then I heard it. Listen
[2:07:50] closely while all this is going on. I
[2:07:53] never had an experience to put my foot
[2:07:54] on. I I've made so many mistakes. I I
[2:07:57] don't I don't know. I don't know. And a
[2:07:58] prophet said, "I've watched you under
[2:08:00] vision. You're a real Christian." And
[2:08:03] then I heard it. The congregation is
[2:08:06] back there on the backside singing,
[2:08:08] "There's power. There's power. There's
[2:08:11] wonder working power in the
[2:08:14] blood of the lamb. There is power,
[2:08:18] power, wonder working power in the
[2:08:22] precious blood of the
[2:08:24] lamb. You might have made mistakes. You
[2:08:27] might have never had a spot where you
[2:08:29] think you could put your foot on, but
[2:08:30] the blood, the blood, the blood.
[2:08:36] Satan might try to rob you of your
[2:08:38] mental faculties, but the blood, he
[2:08:41] might to tell you that you're not good
[2:08:42] enough, but the blood, he might try to
[2:08:45] rob you and try to steal from you, but
[2:08:48] the blood, the blood has the power, has
[2:08:52] the ability to withstand. You were in
[2:08:56] God's mind before Satan could ever get
[2:08:59] to you.
[2:09:01] Satan got to Eve before Adam could get
[2:09:03] to her. But before Satan could get to
[2:09:06] you, but before Satan could get to you,
[2:09:10] God deposited a predestinated seed. Eve
[2:09:14] fail. But a prophet said that you're
[2:09:17] predestinated not to
[2:09:20] fall. That mean you've got to accept
[2:09:23] what you was raised for. You were raised
[2:09:25] for victory. You were raised to defeat
[2:09:28] the devil. You were raised to cast him
[2:09:30] out. You were
[2:09:31] raised. You know you've got an
[2:09:34] experience. You know you got the Holy
[2:09:36] Ghost. Push that devil back. Push him
[2:09:40] back. How do I fight him, brother
[2:09:41] Andrew? With the message.
[2:09:45] You've been given an open door
[2:09:46] revelation. Fight him back. Push him
[2:09:49] back. You got mind battles.
[2:09:53] Push him back. You mamas and daddies are
[2:09:55] fighting. Whether your children are ever
[2:09:57] going to come to it, fight that devil
[2:09:59] back. Push him back in the corner.
[2:10:03] My family will believe. My family will
[2:10:06] be in a restoration. My family will have
[2:10:08] the Holy Ghost. My family will believe
[2:10:10] this message. My family will have
[2:10:12] victory. My family is going in rapture.
[2:10:15] Sometime in your life, you've got to
[2:10:17] confess what this message
[2:10:20] said. And the message says you're
[2:10:23] justified. This message says you're
[2:10:25] sanctified. This message says you got
[2:10:27] the Holy
[2:10:34] Ghost. Church of the living God here and
[2:10:37] on tape. Do you know where you stand? Do
[2:10:41] you know that you were called of God?
[2:10:43] That the Holy Ghost reigns in your heart
[2:10:45] and every word of God is real to you?
[2:10:47] Oh, brother, how is Satan going to stand
[2:10:50] against that? How is he going to stop
[2:10:52] that from going? How is he going to keep
[2:10:54] them signs from following it? Why you
[2:10:56] could throw them into jail? Hey, if you
[2:10:58] could, I don't care what you do to them.
[2:11:00] They done tried it. They rotted in
[2:11:02] jails. They was fed to lines. They was
[2:11:05] saw us under. They were jerked to
[2:11:07] pieces. You could can't you can't kill
[2:11:09] it out. Ride a church that's
[2:11:11] predestinated. Those who he forneew like
[2:11:13] he did Jesus, he has called. And those
[2:11:15] who he's called, he is justified. And
[2:11:18] those who he's justified, he's already
[2:11:20] glorified and predestinated. And now in
[2:11:22] the last days with every seed sowed,
[2:11:25] everything in order, the world's in its
[2:11:27] order, the time is shaped up, the church
[2:11:30] is in its order, the seed, the evening
[2:11:32] lights, the signs like he said, as it
[2:11:34] was in the days of Sodom. An angel of
[2:11:36] God, the Holy Spirit coming down,
[2:11:38] moving, performing the signs like he did
[2:11:40] in Malachi
[2:11:41] 4. Promised he would send in the last
[2:11:44] days. what he promised. And we see all
[2:11:48] of that right there. Where?
[2:11:50] Where? Congregation says, "Amen." Amen.
[2:11:54] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I'm not just
[2:11:59] saying that. The prophet said it.
[2:12:00] Congregation said it. Do you love him?
[2:12:02] Amen. Sure. Right here in the last days,
[2:12:06] I predestinated a church that knows
[2:12:08] where they're standing. Sew with a seed,
[2:12:11] the Holy Spirit in the church.
[2:12:14] Satan, be careful.
[2:12:21] Why did he attack
[2:12:23] Abraham? Because he knew and watched
[2:12:26] Abraham's life. That pillar of fire had
[2:12:29] been circling around Abraham and making
[2:12:32] its way down there to his tent when it
[2:12:35] wasn't going down there to Lot. And
[2:12:37] Satan's been watching that lot.
[2:12:39] And he knew if he could ever stop
[2:12:41] Abraham and his righteous life. If he
[2:12:43] could stop that, if he could ever get a
[2:12:46] hold of him, you watch, he never
[2:12:47] attacked Lot's wife of
[2:12:49] barrenness because he knew there was
[2:12:52] something different about Abraham. But
[2:12:54] the day, Hallelujah. The day that that
[2:12:57] me that pillar fire, that Melzdc
[2:12:58] priesthood showed up to Abraham's tent.
[2:13:03] Hallelujah. What did it do? It gave
[2:13:05] Abraham a revelation to know that this
[2:13:07] is a time Then we're not waiting no
[2:13:10] longer. We're not holding back no
[2:13:12] longer. He began to tell Sarah, "Now's
[2:13:14] the time. Now's the time." Let me say,
[2:13:16] "The field might have been attacked for
[2:13:18] over 75 years, but the seed has been
[2:13:21] sown. And now we recognize that our
[2:13:24] bodies are in position to take a step.
[2:13:27] Christ was the first fruits of them that
[2:13:29] raised from the dead. And now we
[2:13:31] recognize that a seed has been put in
[2:13:34] position and a bride is in her
[2:13:35] authority. She knows who she is. Satan,
[2:13:38] be careful. We recognize that a Melazedc
[2:13:41] priesthood has stood in this generation
[2:13:44] and been waved over this congregation.
[2:13:47] What was it? Satan tried to stop the
[2:13:49] field.
[2:13:52] But when when that one brought that
[2:13:54] sheath before before the priest, he took
[2:13:57] it and he waved it before the high
[2:13:59] priest, it was a sign that this was the
[2:14:02] first one up.
[2:14:05] But there was more in the field.
[2:14:10] There was more in the field. They might
[2:14:12] have been going through attacks, but the
[2:14:14] sun was up. They may have been th going
[2:14:18] through to turmoil, but the sun was up.
[2:14:24] Satan, you can attack all you want to.
[2:14:29] You can try to hinder all you want to.
[2:14:33] Keep waving
[2:14:34] it. Keep holding on. There's one already
[2:14:38] up. What happened in this generation?
[2:14:41] There was one that was raised to
[2:14:43] believe. There was one. The son of man
[2:14:46] ministry was waved over this
[2:14:47] congregation in this generation to show
[2:14:50] there's more that's coming. Come on,
[2:14:52] somebody. We're not here to be more
[2:14:53] William Brandoms. We're not here to be
[2:14:56] like William Brandom. We're here to be
[2:14:58] like Christ. And that's what was waved
[2:15:01] in this generation. Yeah, it was Christ
[2:15:04] that was waved over top of the church to
[2:15:06] show that there was one that raised up,
[2:15:09] but there's more coming. I say we got
[2:15:12] more signs coming. We got more victories
[2:15:15] coming. We got more defeats to the devil
[2:15:17] coming.
[2:15:20] I say we got more prodals coming. I say
[2:15:23] we got more children coming. I say we
[2:15:26] got a rapture coming. I say we got a
[2:15:28] body change coming.
[2:15:32] The sun is up. It is the rising of the
[2:15:38] sun. What was it? Jacob got his change
[2:15:42] at the rising of the sun. When he was
[2:15:44] wrestling with the angel, it was at the
[2:15:47] rising of the sun. What was it on Easter
[2:15:50] morning? It was at the rising of the
[2:15:52] sun. Sister Laura, it was at the rising
[2:15:54] of the sun that we recognize there's one
[2:15:57] that's up before us. What was it,
[2:15:59] Joshua? begin to sound the alarm. It's
[2:16:02] time to take over Jericho at the rising
[2:16:05] of the sun.
[2:16:10] The
[2:16:11] sun is up.
[2:16:16] Whose
[2:16:17] report will you believe?
[2:16:22] Tamar, Rahab,
[2:16:26] Ruth, who you going to believe? Cuz I
[2:16:30] can tell you your past doesn't look very
[2:16:34] promising. Come on. Come on, Rahab. You
[2:16:38] know good and well. You know good and
[2:16:39] well your past says you're not going
[2:16:42] in. But there's somebody that has the
[2:16:44] ability to change the look of the field.
[2:16:49] Come on, music players. Come on. Come
[2:16:52] on, Ruth. You know, you look I was that
[2:16:55] was an announcement. We have music
[2:16:56] players
[2:16:59] coming. Come on, Ruth. You know, you
[2:17:02] know what your field looks right like
[2:17:03] right now. It looks like a moabitis, but
[2:17:06] you just hang on a little bit longer.
[2:17:08] Just hang on just a little bit longer
[2:17:10] cuz there's a Boaz that's going to
[2:17:12] change the field.
[2:17:14] Come on now. You know that you're
[2:17:16] getting ready to go from somebody that's
[2:17:18] just picking up handfuls on purpose to
[2:17:20] one that is second in command.
[2:17:23] Come on, Tamar. You might have to play
[2:17:26] the part of the harlot
[2:17:28] to get this seed, but God that is rich
[2:17:31] in mercy
[2:17:33] has given you a token to know that the
[2:17:36] field has been changed.
[2:17:38] I might look the same, but I'm not the
[2:17:41] same Andrew Spencer. Brother Aaron might
[2:17:44] look the same, but he's not the same
[2:17:46] Aragos will be. Brother Timothy might
[2:17:48] look the same, but he's not the same
[2:17:49] Timothy. Brother Derek might look the
[2:17:52] same, but he's not the same Derek.
[2:17:54] Brother David might look the same, but
[2:17:56] it's not the same David. Brother Limuel
[2:17:58] might look the same, but it's not the
[2:18:00] same line. Why?
[2:18:05] Somebody believed the report of the
[2:18:08] Lord.
[2:18:10] And I happen to believe.
[2:18:16] I don't care what the devil says. I
[2:18:19] believe God's report.
[2:18:21] I don't care what you're going to go
[2:18:23] through, believe God's report. No matter
[2:18:26] what Satan does against you, believe.
[2:18:30] [Applause]
[2:18:32] Is there anybody here that wants to say,
[2:18:35] "I believe the report of the Lord."
[2:18:42] You got to believe it. You got to accept
[2:18:44] it. Some of you might sit there and need
[2:18:47] a baptism of the Holy Ghost. You know
[2:18:49] you can get it right there where you're
[2:18:51] sitting at. You know that brother's got
[2:18:53] the power to lay his hands on you. That
[2:18:56] sister's got her hands that can lay her
[2:18:58] hands on you. She has the same ability
[2:19:01] by the pillar of fire that transfers
[2:19:03] between believers. They have the power
[2:19:05] to lay hands on the sick and they shall
[2:19:07] recover.
[2:19:09] I say anybody that here desires prayer
[2:19:11] this morning, want you raise your
[2:19:16] hand. Anybody here needing a fresh a
[2:19:20] refreshing of the Holy Ghost?
[2:19:24] My hands up,
[2:19:26] too. Anybody here need
[2:19:33] healing? I believe his
[2:19:36] report, but
[2:19:42] before something happens, you got to
[2:19:45] change your language.
[2:19:48] They was a bunch of cowards up there,
[2:19:50] but God changed their language on the
[2:19:52] day of Pentecost.
[2:19:54] They was cowards and they were scared.
[2:19:56] But God give them the boldness of the
[2:19:57] line of the tribe of Judah. And in your
[2:20:00] faith, you got to say, "I believe the
[2:20:02] report of the Lord." No matter
[2:20:05] circumstances I see, no matter the
[2:20:07] troubles I face, I believe the report of
[2:20:10] the Lord. Do you believe you have the
[2:20:13] Holy Ghost? Now lay your hands over on
[2:20:16] your
[2:20:16] brother. Lay your hands over on your
[2:20:20] sister. Father in the name of the Lord
[2:20:22] Jesus Christ. The name above all
[2:20:26] names. That name is the name of all the
[2:20:30] family of heaven and earth. Where all
[2:20:32] power in heaven is earth is named by the
[2:20:35] name of Jesus Christ. There is no other
[2:20:37] name where men should be saved but by
[2:20:40] the name of Jesus Christ. We recognize,
[2:20:43] Father, that in this place, the mighty
[2:20:45] angel has swed up today to prove his
[2:20:48] authority and power still exist in a
[2:20:50] bride body. I pray, Father, as these
[2:20:53] brothers and these sisters have their
[2:20:54] hands laid on one another, that there
[2:20:56] would be an uncction of the Holy Ghost
[2:20:58] flood through this building, flood
[2:21:00] through this life, flood through their
[2:21:02] bodies, and that there would be a
[2:21:04] testimony that would rise out of the
[2:21:05] mouth. I believe what God has said. I
[2:21:08] believe what God has done. I believe
[2:21:10] what God is doing right now. I accept my
[2:21:13] healing. I accept the refreshing of the
[2:21:15] Holy Ghost. I accept the furtherance of
[2:21:17] the kingdom of God. I accept healing in
[2:21:20] my shoulder. I accept a fresh anointing.
[2:21:22] I accept what you said about me, Lord
[2:21:24] Jesus. So, Father, as we step into our
[2:21:27] position as sons and daughters of
[2:21:29] Almighty God, we will stand forth and
[2:21:32] believe the report of the Lord. No
[2:21:35] matter the attack of the enemy, you have
[2:21:38] destined our field to be winners.
[2:21:40] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:21:42] pray that you'd give us an outpouring of
[2:21:44] the Holy Spirit. Father, we come here
[2:21:46] seeking, we come here seeking a
[2:21:48] refreshing, a
[2:21:50] renewing, a closer walk with you, Lord
[2:21:53] Jesus. Lord, we won't hold back our
[2:21:55] tongues from speaking out that your name
[2:21:57] is worthy. We won't hold back our praise
[2:21:59] from speaking out that you are great.
[2:22:02] So, Father, may you come down in the
[2:22:04] name of Jesus Christ and give liberty
[2:22:07] into this body. Give liberty into the
[2:22:10] body of Christ. Give liberty for her
[2:22:12] healing. Give liberty in the name of
[2:22:15] Jesus Christ.
[2:22:18] Somebody give the Lord
[2:22:20] praise. Somebody turn and give thanks to
[2:22:22] the Almighty God.
[2:22:24] [Applause]
[2:22:27] [Music]
