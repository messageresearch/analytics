a little while but we're back again by god's grace and and you're here this morning so that makes it wonderful and especially with the lord being present with us like he promised us he would be amen so it's a joy to serve the lord together amen we have the walls family here this morning we want to welcome and glad to have you here with us he was uh i believe with us in israel uh when we were in israel a couple of years ago what was it a few years back and you know we had a wonderful time together we got to do something very special during that time because the mount sinai was closed off and we didn't get to go there so they kind of did a little surprise uh for us and they took us to a place called shiloh and that is where that um you know where hannah went and prayed at shiloh and and god promised her a son and that was samuel and she gave him unto the lord god gave her a prophet and it was just a very moving time for us because we had a lot of things that was on our hearts as i looked across the rising of the sun and and saw the great um coming across the sea of galilee just a few days before that before we went to shiloh and and thought about it you know at the rising of the sun and going down at the west his name is to be praised and he goes on you know how that he will what he will do for his people and he'll make um the the barren woman to rejoice and to be a mother of children and things like that was just laid there right there in that promise it just made it so so alive in us as i i looked over there i couldn't help but think that same son was was had risen there many times during jesus life and ministry in that same sea of galilee right there it would raise over over that same sea and i was looking upon the scenes at um where jesus walked and the apostles walked and the prophets walked and and you know bible bible days and the bible times and went down to shiloh and and um as we began to reflect on where we were as i said it first took us by surprise because we didn't know we were gonna go there and it was just kind of thrown in at the last minute and um you know we had some the ones on our hearts my daughter bethany wanted a baby another child and she had suffered four miscarriages and um you know so she was on her heart there was a candace tushner who had not had a child and you know been married how many years nine years and and now of course this was several years ago so probably about seven six or seven years and they have not had children and and you know then of course my daughter esther um who uh we were also and still believe in the lord to give her a child amen and and of course while i was while i was moved on i just began to pray for these uh different needs and i walked out of uh out of the the little theater there that they had kind of showing the story of shiloh and whatever and it opened up into the ruins there and we walked down among the ruins and walked back up and and they asked me to pray and there i prayed for the barren women and i called by name these different ones that had a need there and a desire that was on their lives and then i went from there and began to pray for barren souls where that those that didn't know the lord and had never experienced him and and or maybe we're prodicals away from god for there to be a birth that would take place in them and then i prayed again and and prayed for the barren church that we've been looking for jesus to come back and and you know for that church to bring forth life in this day and hour and see you know it was a very moving time in fact the guide he was a jewish man he would wipe his eyes and said wow my didn't expect so much emotion at this place but it was more than just emotion it was the the presence of the lord and god has answered prayer and given us a a wonderful uh day today where we can have this time of of rejoicing amen because um we are here to dedicate little abigail uh elise tushner that the lord has blessed the testner family with you know it was at our our meetings at brother ronwood would be preaching the sermon take it back and you'd walk right along down there and come by andrew and and point to him said it's coming and and of course now he's here amen and that's just the grace of almighty god and god answering our prayers and so we are thankful to the lord for these things that he has done and it's given us great cause of joy that's what abigail means is cause of joy and our father's joy is he a joy oh my yes sir and then elise meaning god's promise so we thank the lord for that and and i want to ask them if they will come down bring the baby at this time and we'll just sing that song bring them in and i'm gonna do something a little different just as soon as you get through play and

but lord it's going to take more than that for us to be an inspired speaker the lord is going to take your anointing to anoint us it is anointing that breaks the yoke of sin and unbelief off of us i pray lord you'll bless us in a special way today anointed service lord each one that has gathered the visitors that are in our midst lord may none walk out of here feeling a stranger but feel like that they have been in the presence of god and his holy angels in the company of saints i ask lord you'll bless us now in a special way and never need supply we ask in jesus name amen god bless you if you turn with me to genesis chapter 17 and verse one i want to just refresh your thoughts this morning on this scripture and then we'll read from verse down to verse 3 and then over to verse 21 and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant betwixt me and thee and multiply thee exceededly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying and then verse 21 but my covenant will i'll establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham amen god bless you you can be seated this morning i'm as before we start our service i wanted to make an announcement um our brother george winters is not here and i hoped he would be but he's out of town on the job and for personal reasons brother george has stepped down from the office of deacon today i want to just express our thankfulness for his many years of service to our church and serving together with us he's been a great friend he's been a buddy a brother and he and his wife sister trish are wonderful children of god and they are great have a great family and we want to express our appreciation for their given to the lord for these many years and the many sacrifices they have made and they are you know wonderful giving people and we've enjoyed their hospitality many times as a church group and a church body and i want to just say we really appreciate their years of service to the lord and and so we're thankful to them they're they're what they are the kind of people that makes evening like tabernacle a great church amen so we want to say we appreciate them and their ministry and their service to the lord and to us for these many years as you know brother timothy and i have just returned from canada where we went to minister to the family of brother harold hildebrandt and his church the end time message tabernacle he had just turned 80 years old and and they had a celebration uh of for birthday celebration for him on the first of april i was asked to come to that and was unable to go because my grandson luke was getting married and that same weekend so i wasn't able to go and be with them during that time so you know he had suffered from parkinson's disease for the last 15 years and i actually had not ministered in the church for over five years brother harold was a great pioneer of the message he had traveled and done extensive work in africa some of those trips i would make with him you know he would preach conventions through out the united states and travel to many different foreign lands too many to name he's really did a great pioneer work and he leaves uh behind his wife's sister leanne their two children melody and joel and his married daughters sister wendy and sister debbie and their husbands and grandchildren great grandchildren and a wonderful church and brother ed hammermeister there has been the associate minister for a good number of years and is uh trying to pick up and go forward now as as things as as uh as our brother has departed and left the the church there while i was there i also saw brother minnow friesen um he's a pastor in saskatoon in saskatchewan canada he was one of the original group of singers called the believers how many remembers the believers the group called the believers way back yonder many many years ago and um you know see he was a part of that group he pastors a church um there in saskatoon and he uh he too is uh turning 80 and his plans of stepping down from being pastor there just led the church to a building project of a new church and then derek brother harold's memorial service brother ivan carr came from new brunswick some of you might remember um one time during our labor day meetings many years ago that he surprised us with a visit and spoke to us in one of those services and um he he was there in the meeting with um his son-in-law brother carmen mills and he brother carmen and his wife was with us in israel as well and brother ivan is a spry 92 year old and he still preaches regularly at his church i understand twice a week and you know immediately after i seen him and and how spry and bright he was i aspired to be like him and so you know right after seeing him there and we had a time of talking together and and um and he went home and his wife of 70 years just suddenly passed away and they buried her last sunday and then you know brother timothy and i went through the mountains over bamf and jasper into the rockies and had a wonderful week together and we drove into beretta's columbia where brother biskell and his church were celebrating a great milestone of 50 years from the bibleway house to the log church to their present location and i believe it's been 169 times over the last 50 years that brother biscuit has went overseas taken the message he hazard his life behind the iron curtain risk risk his own safety and and um and skirted prison terms and getting arrested in china preaching conventions um everywhere literally around the world and and with a great burden to take the message some of you will remember him many years ago back in the uh late 60s and and early 70s uh on wwl of the um of the bible believers broadcast and him playing a clip of brother branham on there and and uh ending it you know yesterday today and forever jesus is the same and uh you know it's just um uh he's done a a great great work and um the lord has used him in a mighty mighty way and i was privileged to go and minister to them during this special time and to be a part of this celebration and uh brother biskell and i spent some private very private times together and shared some special moments he's now 87 will be 88 this year in october he's been a gallant soldier of the cross a great general in the service of the lord and uh i i just wanted to just show you just a couple of little pictures real quick of uh some of the some of the scenes there the ministry that was there we had brother david mayer um that is standing there by brother biscuit he's from france and switzerland and hosts the meetings in switzerland that i have went to and different others that went brother timothy has ministered there as well not in the conventions but in france and where he pastors a church and brother david would open the first service and then of course um there would be brother ron spencer was there he would preach saturday night and we would have a prayer line and then there would be brother timothy who would minister also i tell you did a tremendous job it was such a such a tremendous message as i listened to him i said well you know he's not leaving us nothing to preach he's going to climb access meeting and it was a real blessing how many how many has heard all of those services let me just see your hands well a good number of you or a few of you have and and so you know um so we uh we also uh you see there of course brother biscuit standing between brother ron brother uh david mayer and over to the the far right his brother tom ray his son michael ray and and uh my we saw such a great growth in the ministry of brother michael ray and and moving forward and just saw a wonderful atmosphere of the holy ghost that was just poured out it was just a tremendous time um some would say it was the best services they'd ever been in their life and that's saying a lot we've been in a lot but of course it's the freshest on our mind as well so you know but anyway it was a tremendous time that we had together and you know i think about the service our brother biscuit has made and and uh he's now not been able to minister in the last couple of years and uh you know he had open heart surgery and and um uh he had coveted and different setbacks and things like that but i thought you know a man who has hazarded his life for the gospel of christ and been a great general a leader and i thought about brother hildebrand and him passing on brother meno sitting down brother um brother ivan carr and and whatever i thought you know here we are perhaps at the changing of the guard you know we're at a junction time and yet you know we must go forward we must carry this message forward it ought to be to the zeal of every heart to burn in our hearts you know and i know what it is to spend weeks away from home i hadn't went away 169 different trips like brother biscuit and let me just say about that while i'm there he didn't go there to build a kingdom he didn't go there to pass out his tapes he didn't go there to to promote his ministry he gave them the the voice of the seventh angel and and put libraries of tapes and books in their hands and and and supported translations and they're still doing that with bible believers still doing a great work and you know so again you know 169 times that's almost unfathomable of how many times to travel across and leave your family leave your home weeks away and missing birthdays and anniversaries and and uh you know the church sacrificing him to go and and on and on and on there's just a lot of giving that has went on and i i kind of know what it is to spend weeks away from home i've been there several times to new zealand preaching conventions of fiji islands and preaching in underground churches in china many minister in different places with meetings there and going many times preaching in and conventions in germany and holland switzerland norway down in france and serbia on down into poland into the interior mexico and south america or south africa men in uganda kenya tanzania nigeria cameroon trinidad and conventions in the u.s and canada numerous trips across into ontario and saskatchewan and new brunswick and newfoundland and yukon and and british columbia many places united states and then some people wonder where are the missionaries in our church well i'll just tell you you know you can look around seeing behind me as brother timothy as a young preacher went down to south america to guyana going over down into and floating down the amazon river endangering his life you know there and and um uh coming coming into many many hazards sleeping out on the ground and in churches on benches and and preaching in still churches where um the churches are built on stilts because the water coming up in under them people coming into church in the canoes and different ways and then going into um china and to japan and south africa and poland czech republic and romania and switzerland and brother joe here going into trinidad and africa and returning home just now from the newfoundland and uh now he and brother aaron going full time in them into the ministry and you ask where are the missionaries in this church i want to just know we are part of a great voice amen you know it's not one person that has done it but give me another one another picture as we just show but you know here's brother and sister biscuit now they're they're celebrating at 68 years of marriage and what a what a tribute they have been to the bride of christ and and honorable people that has carried the word of god and and carried it with dignity and bringing forth not their own ideas but the the revelation brought by the messenger are you with me amen and these men have have carried the message sister ruth going with him many times and there's brother ron who is still going in fact i've had to say to him you know this this year because he's got one meeting planned after another meeting after another meeting after another meeting i just talked to him yesterday and said how are you going to keep doing this you know you're you're expending your energy and your time he's putting everything into it and yet with four stage cancer and it's because that he's a voice in this end time and he's part of the prophecy of what god is doing in this last day amen and then brother biscuit sitting there as you see um you know and then myself here we we're just uh we're just all small pebbles on the beach you know god gave the word but great was the company of those who published it and i want you to remember as a church body that you are part of a voice i think as i i i believe it was five or six new sermons of brother branham's that we just translated got paid for translation into japanese and and so this month we got that many more on the hub and we're pushing close to over 200 where there wasn't any there on the uh in the the messages in japanese but but but because it god orchestrated a moment and brother timothy and brother craig and then danny domindo and these brothers would meet with these translators right at the 11th hour lighted right as they were leaving for the airport and meet with these this man and his wife and the message become real to them and she because she is a she's a professional translator into the japanese language and now we've got messages there for the japanese people to hear we're still doing mission work japan is closed right now visitors can't get in but the message still gets in and and and they hear the sermons that we preach right here at this pulpit and and getting the sermons we're translating of the prophet of god and and and and so you know again we're still working even though that things are changing and and as it changes there just becomes more of a burden on our own shoulders and a greater responsibility to carry this message that has been committed to us in this day and so i as that i wanted to read a scripture this morning there as we look at us being a great voice i'm going to entitle this abraham's voice and i'm going to look at revelation chapter 19 and verse 1 where we will read from for another scripture reading and then i have one from colossians and we'll just see how the lord will lead us as to how far we get into this today after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord our god for true and righteous are his judgment he had judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the four and twenty elders and four beasts fell down and worshiped god that sat on the throne saying amen hallelujah and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as a voice of many waters and as a voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the final inning is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said these are the true saiyans of god then i'd like you to turn with me to colossians chapter 1 and we'll read from verse 12 for this scripture reading given thanks to unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saint and light who delivered us who have delivered us from the power of darkness how many have been delivered from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son you know how that happens amen the kingdom of god is not meat and drink his righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost so our kingdom the kingdom of god comes by the holy ghost and he says and in whom we have redemption to his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the in image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or power all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence and for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell so now as we are looking at this i wanted to look at verse 18 one more time where he says that in all things he might have preeminence now god had a threefold purpose and a threefold plan of what he would do to bring about um the transition of us from this life of sin back to eden again and that is the longing in our heart like i sang that song we're longing for jesus to come back listen all our efforts everything that we've done you know all amounts to really nothing unless jesus comes back we're looking for the coming of the lord jesus and and so his purpose when he came 2 000 years ago was to first reveal himself in christ god so loved fatherhood that he wanted a family and so he created a man but when man sinned that we know rather than discarding the human race he became one of us to save us and to redeem us so he would come to reveal himself in christ and of course he had been revealing himself down to the ages he would actually reveal himself and adam and and and abel when abel would bring a lamb that was a re revelation of christ when when enoch would walk by faith and and be translated that was a revelation of christ when when um when noah would build an ark and and save his household that was a revelation of christ it was christ the mystery of god that was being hid in those men and women down to the ages and down through time until that when we look at the bible we can now look back and we can see that jesus is the principal theme of the entire bible and that if you read the bible and you don't see christ in every verse of it that you should go back and read it again because you have missed it you see you you missed the the real context of what god was doing that it was more than a story but there was a voice that was being spoken and it was the voice of god and it was his omnipotence and his power that was being shown and and as they're seen in revelation 19 all of all of them thundering out the lord god omnipotent reigneth and then for time it was a thunder it was a noise and we didn't know what it meant there were no stories in the bible but we have more than stories to us today and because why god has revealed to us the context not just not just reading the history and the bible but we see more than just a story in the bible we see what that god was doing something and he was reflecting something and he was foreshadowing and speaking out of their lives in such a way that um that now those words that will be spoken them would one day be manifested in christ you see it was more than just a story of an old man given the ultimate sacrifice of a child and and this child 16 years old isaac the promised son oh what a test of faith it was more than that it was more than just a story of how nice it was that abraham believed god and would even believe he would raise him up from the dead but you know it was more than that he was actually foreshadowing he was a voice that was speaking out and he was prophesied of the coming messiah and he was telling that oh he would one day god would bring his son upon that very same hill and there he would offer his son come on church amen and because here god would provide a sacrifice he would show himself jehovah jirei and he would show himself in his omnipotence by creating a ram by abraham's words because abraham's words became life and they spoke out of him god will provide a sacrifice and a lamb a ram is found there tangled there in the they're waiting to be the sacrifice because a man became god's voice now as we think of that you know when you look now and we see now what was in abraham we see it's more than that that rhyme was more there was more than a a round that was spoke but god would speak a son into existence the word would become flesh and that word then would be provided for a sacrifice now we look and we can see it was a voice it was the voice of god that was speaking out through abraham's life now looking at that when we go back and we look at christ we can see him now from all the way from genesis to revelation we can see him from the beginning in the beginning god created the heavens the earth how did he do that by the word who was the word that was christ before he became jesus before he took on flesh somebody help me amen so from the very beginning it was god created the heavens and the earth all the way that to the amen in revelation it is every word testifying of jesus christ now god as the groom was fully revealed in christ insomuch that the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in him in other words the fullness of all the scriptures you see jesus would say search the scriptures then he would say to the denominational people of that day the pharisees he said in them you think you have eternal life but they are testifying they're everyone pointing to me they're all testifying of who i am whether you're reading in the beginning god whether you're reading about noah whether you're reading about uh elijah no matter whether you're reading whatever you're reading about it's all justifying to me jesus said amen i i i am the interpretation now we see the bigger picture than that of abraham amen we see we see more than just a man called out of the chaldeans and he he's a nice man and god calls him and he raises them up a family and they become the jewish people and oh that's a great story of the jewish race and we got a bible out of that and so now we're we're we all believe the bible it's more than that but god was speaking in that day in that hour now as we're looking at this remember he would say to those pharisees you think you have eternal life in there but they're testifying to me everyone are speaking and pointing to me you see the scriptures bear witness and bear record of me and i'm bearing records of them so therefore if i don't do the works that is promised i would do then don't believe me am i but if i do the works if i if i show the omnipotence if i show you the omnipotence that was shown when abraham spoke a lamb if i show you the omnipotence amen when when he believed god and a baby was formed in a 90 year old woman that took omnipotent power amen are you with me amen so there again he said if you don't believe me believe the omnipotence believe the works believe it when you see the blind eye open when you see the crippled walk when you see the depth here when you see the word proclaim believe it because i am what they were manifesting now all encapsulated in one body called jesus the word testify me you see that was christ and abraham it was christ and moses it was christ and the prophets it was the hidden power that was in samson come on it's more than a story of a of a little shrimp there that you know that somehow another could tear down walls and rip apart lions and and could carry the heavy gates and do the great things that he did or killed thousands of philistines and more than that there was a hidden power and who was that omnipotence that was in him you see he was given voice to the christ that was coming now whether it was in the psalms of david or the wisdom of solomon in other words he was the fullness of the law and the prophets all in one body he said before abraham was i am think of that before abraham was i am i was there that was me there before he came i was there amen and while he was there i was there it was me it was me and the burning bush with moses it was me there calling him out calling abraham out of chaldea it was me there teaching him how to sacrifice it was me there standing else else shadia the almighty amen that could change sarah and an old woman and make her young again and able to bear a child somebody help me preach now now you see jesus proved he was the word he was the word in abraham he was the word in moses he was the word in the prophets and on easter morning when he arose triumphant he showed he was not on the mechanics but the dynamics of it amen he didn't just have a claim but the power was there to prove that he was this he was the resurrection life and then he showed his omnipotence he raised from the dead he clamped over death hell in the grave are you with me amen you see that dynamic power was the power that translated enoch it was the power that destroyed noah's world amen it was a dynamic power that got a hold of david's sling and took a measly stone and turned it into a bullet that was a speed of a thousand miles per second and hit a giant right between the eyes amen that was christ it was the dynamics and it made the body of jesus christ that was cold and stiff and dead in the tomb shake the life again and rise and rolling away the stone you see he not only he not only was the mechanics of god's word but he was the dynamics to prove it are you with me now but you see if we just leave it in christ we we are just we are missing a great part of it because god has a body on the earth his body called jesus is in the heavens and one day he will come in the place expanded to redeem us and we'll meet him in the air is that right but right now he has a body on the earth and i want you to know this bright body is a body that is the fullness of the godhead all the scriptures encapsulated in a people called the bride it's not working in just one person are you with me amen it's not just with one man you see jesus said i gotta go away if i don't go the comforter can't come and if the comforter can't come well you know i can only go to this place and go to that place and touch this one and touch that one and open that blind eye but if i come again i'm going to come in another form amen i'm not going to return yet in my physical body i'm going away i'll do my intercession work but i'm going to have a body on earth and that body will be a people that body will be a pride and he didn't just feel one with the spirit of jesus on the day of pentecost he filled 120 with the spirit of jesus i'm talking about the same dynamic power that was in jesus christ came in 120 and after that uh 3 000 more and then more and then more and then more unto you today and you and you and you that same omnipotent power at work that same holy ghost not a different spirit the same holy spirit amen now so therefore our challenge anymore is not just go back and see christ in every and every part of the scripture but to see the bride in every part [Music] you see because you know the groom coming is yet in the future he came 2000 years ago he won't come to the earth until after the after or just before the millennium after the the wedding supper he won't come to earth we meet him in the air so the only way he's going to be here physically is in a corporal body called the bride and he's the same in every detail except that corporal body you see it doesn't look like jesus and don't have the stature of jesus amen it's a different kind of a man amen but it's the same jesus in bright form hallelujah amen do you realize people are talking about the revealing of the son of man and certainly the son of man was revealed the word was made known by the prophet of malachi 4 but do you realize you for the last 56 years since the prophet have been gone have been revealing the son of man the word the same word is being revealed where in bright form [Music] this is where brother branham would say god god in in the heavens god in christ and now god in his people now so to how the preeminence and the people notice now here what i'm seeing what i'm seeing in this scripture like this where he's saying this where where um where this voice is coming out and it's saying hallelujah look at verse 6 of chapter 19. and then there's a voice of mighty thunderings and the voice of many waters and brother branham would tell us that voice the voice of god is not one voice come on amen the voice of god is one of many waters it's one voice but of many waters and those waters are multitude stickness and and and people are you with me that makes you a voice i i want you to understand the world may not understand the voice because to them is only a thunder it's only a noise they think oh that peculiar bunch of people those fanatical butts that get up and shout and rejoice in the word and the truth and that sings the song the zion will dance out in the aisle those people you know that's just a noise and it's just a noise to them amen come on when jesus was going to calvary didn't he go down and he thundered from the heaven amen somehow i heard a thunder the other said an angel spoke and jesus knew what it said come on church there ought to be a people today that is realizing what the word is said about it it's not just a noise it's not just a clap of thunder i mean the world may hear it and they say that just noise to me that don't make any sense i don't understand them women with their long hair and their dresses i don't understand those men and their clean look i don't understand why they're the way they are but they're a voice [Applause] and some only hear it as a thunder and when when many well even the jewish people when they when they read the scripture about abraham they don't see christ in there they don't see a type and a shadow they don't see a projection or a prophecy oh they see that's our father abraham and they take it literally but we can look at and see it was speaking prophetically so to them is still a thunder it's still a noise and it will still be a noise and just a thunder until their prophets come and then it will be a voice and they'll see the messiah and oh that's the one david talked about that was the wisdom of solomon that was there in abel's land that was the one down through you will see it just like you see it today hallelujah and then they will see we are the elected jews the 144 thousand amen they're our counterpart right now that's what's been revealed to you by this message it broke the thunder off the scripture it opened up the voice of god to you where it's not just a noise a nice stunning you know a nice something to put you to sleep at night when you go through that it's god speaking abraham's got a voice and that voice is now being lived out in a people a people whose meeting their shady eye just like he did because this is type in the holy ghost and this is typing where a believer comes and and he nurses from the breast about said i and receives the strength are you with me amen so again all the scripture as a noise of great thundering go back to put verse six up again heard the voice of a great multitude and the voice of many waters and the voice of mighty thunderings and they're all saying one thing the lord god omnipotent reigneth to reign he has to have preeminence the lord god is praying preeminent he has found the people amen abraham could say i didn't fully reflect him you can look at your life and you can see parts where you didn't reflect him but oh when you come to the new covenant to the next new testament and you cross through the blood of the cross i mean you hear a whole different story amen the voice of abraham's mistakes and his failures are all gone and the only voice you hear is abraham he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but he was strong into faith it doesn't show him laughing it doesn't show him wondering it doesn't show him going down to egypt it doesn't show him well you know in his failures it don't show him lying it shows him what victorious because that was the only voice god was going to receive that's my voice and god credited him for speaking his voice i heard the great voice of a great multitude the voice of many waters the voice of mighty thunderings enoch's voices in there i was the seventh from adam i walked with god but you know there was some years i didn't i didn't walk with him you know that's the history but when it's written in the book of hebrews it's not mentioned it doesn't mention the the years that he didn't walk with god amen the 65 years the bible said he walked he he he lived for for um 365 years i think of that a day a day of the years or a year's day is 365 he walked with god a year's worth he walked with god 365 years or he lived for 365 years but he 65 of it he didn't walk with god he walked with god 300 years you see no matter who we are we have our past we have our mistakes great men we've shown great men here on the on the the projector here today great man among us but they've made their mistakes i've made my mistakes you make your mistakes amen but when it all covered it didn't say i remember his mistake and that that those years that he didn't walk with god i see by faith enoch was translated that he would not see death hallelujah amen why because because he walked with god and was not it never talks about the years he didn't walk with god he talked about only the years he walked with god because that was god's voice now i hear it as a voice of mighty thunderings there's many things in the bible that are still just thunders to many people it's a book that is full of mysteries it's still a sealed book it's closed and they don't go and read it and it's close with the jews their eyes are blinded it's a closed book they hear the noise of it but they don't see the purpose they don't hear the voice you see but i want you to get it that in every one of these it was where god reigned when god reigned in abraham's life when he gave the word preeminence over his thoughts over his body weakness over the deadness of sarah's womb he had to give the word preeminence now you know a lot of times people listen to christ the mystery of god revealed and they think oh you know when the church oh god it gives him preeminence let me just say to you every person who's ever been filled with the holy ghost to get it you had to give the word preeminence he had to be first everything else you know it's a marriage contract and everybody else is out of the picture no other lovers no other person nobody between you and me everyone with the baptism of the holy ghost you got it when you gave him preeminence when you said lord take over the leadership i can't lead no more when you said lord i can't handle this habit i've tried to give it up over and over but you come you come and take it oh i give you preeminence i put it in your hands amen so again you see in all of it that he might have the preeminence you see jesus is the principal theme of the bible but now you become the principal theme of the bible you see christ is the mystery of god revealed how many believes that let me ask you again so that everybody's participating from the front to the back you know how many believes that that that christ is the mystery of god reveal raise your hands you believe that amen now then let's go a little further but i don't leave it there because the bride is the mystery of christ revealed amen you are the mystery hallelujah you are the mystery you see these mysteries brother damn this mystery of this mystery that mystery this you are the mystery those aren't the mystery you're the mystery the mystery was god had foreign god was calling the church god was pulling the people out for his namesake what is the mystery about the bible way house why would they have to leave the denominations and their homes there and everything else and start a little place in a little uh a little house and little meetings there in the bible way how how come it would happen with us in little home meetings and then and an old run-down church with broken window panes how come it would be is because there was something in our hearts just like the jews that said we've been in the holocaust but we'll never do that again we'll never be in a place where our children are are cremated and are old or are killed and and are well or made slaves will never be and that again will never stand for to be annihilated again we want a homeland and there was something in the hearts of men and women that were saying you know we had homes in baptist or methodist or presbyterian or pentecostal for years and years my daddy was there my granddaddy my great-granddaddy he was a charter member and on and on and on we were there and we we thought this was our home it wasn't our home all of a sudden it's turned into holocaust it's turned air into places where where souls of men and women were withered and died where the young people look at the churches today they're literally holocaust where are there young people every one of them will cry to you we don't have no young people our young people are going why is it because they have turned them into death camps amen the cremate them and burn them with fire and they die die die die the spirit has been gone for years years years but why was there a bible way house why was there an evening like tabernacle why did we go into a dimly lit place why did we leave our homes out there and go there because we wanted a homeland where the bible is preached we wanted a homeland where our souls could be fed why young people could have an experience with god and be changed we wanted something that was real and we do whatever it would take hallelujah and just as jews are right now being gathered out of ukraine and taken back and having their aaliyah in israel let me tell you right now there's a bride around the world and there's a star going on there's a spiritual war that's been taking place and because of the war what is it it's uprooting people i want a homeland i've got to get to safety i got to get to christ i must find jesus [Applause] that's why your prodigals are coming home because there's a stir in the hearts god calling the last ones back hallelujah hallelujah said god as the groom would fully reveal himself in christ and now he would reveal himself in bride's form so his desire and his plan was to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in his people you see god wanted a people he could live in that he could go to church in this tabernacle isn't to dwell in place of living god this building you're the tabernacle of the living god amen and jesus brought you to church this morning you didn't even bring yourself jesus brought you to church hallelujah because it's his custom it's the custom of jesus to go to the house of god and worship [Music] is that right and it rose up within you you might have said i'm tired i'm weary i'm this i'm that you know brother tim will be back he'll preach a long time i don't know if i can take it off and something rolls up in here i gotta go and you're here hallelujah amen amen and what is it it's that jesus worshiping god out of you because he's going to have preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in his people having first to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people now brother branham's telling us exactly what god's doing i am bringing the fullness of the godhead bodily now into a people so all the word of the entire bible is going to be heaped up into a bright people this is why she's a word bride because she's the word of of uh of the seed in genesis she's the word of the of the of abel she is the word of noah she is the word of enoch she is the word of abraham she is the word of all peter james john paul you name it mary magdalene come on amen that was speaking of you hallelujah when mary would would kneel down there and there and was being going to be beaten with stones caught in the act of adultery are you with me amen and he would look and he says he said the one who has who is without sin you cast the first stone are you with me amen and here was a woman now she would have seven devils cast out of her do you know you're that woman all the demon of the seven ages had tried to possess you with every bit of that come on church with every bit of the false doctrines antichrist teachings immorality and sin amen heaped up into a people a man and the one who could have judged us and was the judge did not judge us but said neither do i condemn you go and disbelieve no more hallelujah you're that woman you are that woman you are that ruth you are that come on church you are that people you are that esther expressed in jesus christ who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church supremacists all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was was poured into the church the believers amen and if he as he says in rising unto the son and he be in the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him do you realize for a moment you know he's not complete without you he cannot abandon the project he cannot come in this day and send a messenger heal the sick open the eyes of the blind make the deaf to hear raise the dead perform miracles and then turn around bring a message and then give up i'm through i i can't do it she's him i'll tell you what she's so much him that he already paid redemption price for you your slave debt has already been cancelled you're not a slave anymore you're no slave to sin you're no slave to denominational dogma you're no slave to the world come on you don't have to listen to jubilee trump it has sounded and you don't have to hoe anymore i would say to you today break up that hole you don't have to go back to it oh you said well i've wrestled with this whole so you know there's some pornography spirit break it into pieces amen say i'm not going back i won't go back it is not me that's not who i am i will not give voice to that i'll give voice to the word of god i'll give voice like abraham did to the right things to righteousness are you with me amen he said the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any other spoke of the bride so the bride can only be the fulfilling of all the other revelations that spoke of her just like jesus could only be to be the messiah to be the christ to be the word he would have to be the word that was in abraham he would have to be the words of the prophets he would have to be the words of the law he would have to be the words of the psalms he would have to be the wisdom of solomon i'm bringing it on down amen and it for to be the bride you can only be the fulfilling of all and any revelations that spoke of the bride hallelujah why he showed a seed was coming in the beginning that was a serpent bruiser and you think you're going to leave out of here defeated no sir you are that serpent bruiser you are that devil defeater you are the one called for the sake amen that there is no weapon that is formed against you that can prosper hallelujah that he has declared that whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven all heaven is standing behind you your sons and daughters of the most high god and you are the fulfilling of all the revelations of any others that spoke of the bride the groom spoke of you coming the works that i do shall you do also sure that included brother branham but not all that includes you you're to do the works of christ amen she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she's him it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride amen go back and read your bible again it's prophesying of you it was the voice you are the interpretation it was the thunder you are the revelation as a woman and a man or one the woman taken from his side she had a spirit of feminist spirit from him the flesh was from his side was both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him the flesh of him put together and made the mechanics and the dynamics so this great voice the voice of abraham is crying out hallelujah for the lord god omnipotence reigneth he's revealed himself as almighty god when he comes to you in the baptism of the holy ghost that's what he's showing to you he is almighty god he is god over every situation he is lord over all he is lord over every sin he is lord over every habit it he's lord over every disease ever affliction he is lord now you see in all of the cases it was where they gave him preeminence that he reigned and when he reigned he reigned in omnipotence that's the way the holy ghost comes into you to reign in omnipotence in all power i am the almighty god you're going to take into you the life of all mighty god now this is of course particularly true in jesus christ where the fullness of god was made was made known because in christ the secret of the mystery of god the power of god in moses david or elijah was made known and manifested he was the christ the anointed man that was anointed with the fullness of the godhead bodily where moses partly had him and where that david had him and but in christ jesus he was manifested in the fullness deity standing on the earth god in his fullness to die for the sins of the people that he might bring to his church a sanctified life that he might have preeminence and fullness in his church to manifest every promise in these days that he promised for the last days so you see a people giving christ preeminence as i said he was the lord reigning in power through david when he reigned through samson when he reigned through sarah when he reigned to rebecca through ruth amen it's the holy spirit they're empowering it's the holy spirit living this is it's speaking out of these lives but in today you are the voice thousands of years ago abraham was the voice but now you are the voice you remember john standing there and he would say i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness now john was not the one crying in the wilderness you said brother them he was preaching in the wilderness he was not the one crying in the wilderness the one crying in the wilderness was jehovah god he was looking for a people somebody help me preach amen and he was the one that was crying out and john was his voice he said i'm the voice of this one crime do you know what we had in this day the lord descended from heaven with a shout what was that it was the shout let me tell you brother branham was not the shout he was the voice amen that carried that word he spoke what god said amen he was the voice of the one crying and he wasn't let me tell you this way he was in the wilderness he was not out there in denominations he was out there away from from any sect of man an idea man come on church and then he left all of that behind and he became the voice of that one crying in the wilderness a man of making a pathway for my god hallelujah now john did it 2000 years ago but brother branham told us his purpose and my mission is to forerun the coming word which is christ he said my job is to forerun amen the bride of jesus christ because christ is coming in this generation he is here today but he's not in the meeting in the air he's not in the man called jesus he's here in a bright body so the lord reigned in power through david samson sarah to rebecca to ruth when i was there this this prophecy just struck me it was a prophecy of danny henry that and i spoke on this in cloverdale where the holy spirit fell upon a young baptist boy who didn't know a word of french he'd never spoken in other tongues and the holy spirit is fell upon him it was february the 11th 1961 and and brother brother brother branham you know tells about and gives the word of prophecy and we'll get to it in a moment and i i just sometimes you know you look at something like this and we view it as just history well that happened in 1961 that was that was a wonderful moment a wonderful time why can't it happen now hello if christ is still the same why can't it happen now amen i just want to say it can amen it can i i just i'm just going to read you a couple that were given personally to me here the other day brother adam would share what was given personally him let me give something personal to me as brother buzz bose he would write me he said just so you know your faith inspires thousands of believers around the world including us you've done so much damage to the kingdom of darkness through your ministry you're one of god's generals of our time that that the devil is so obsessed at trying to pull down to whatever way he thinks he can poor devil he can't we are the unstoppable bride and as he as he speaks this he begins to prophesy your sacrifice toward my sheep is what has moved me here you are yielding yourself like never before to face what you have never faced but i am the lord that keeps my promises i fail not i am the lord a series of victories is going to be it's meant to be for my name's glory only be thou of good cheer to not to not are the words of the wicked one no one can stand against me i speak and my words are light for i have done this saith the spirit of the lord amen again in july 2 20 and 21 he said through your ministry i'm raising a generation of young people you think about you young people you've been prophesied about a generation of young people that will stand with my word without fear or favor of man i believe we're raising that kind of crop of young people here today young men and young women that will not give boys to the world they will not give voice to hollywood they'll not give voice to the trendy ways of the world they will not get come somebody with me they will not give voice to a feminine spirit and sodom and gomorrah they're going to give voice to the word what's a person do when he puts on his clothes you know of uh of lsu his he has given voice that i am a fan of lsu i am a supporter of that team you realize your clothes and the way you dress and the way you conduct yourself is a voice and there are millions out there giving voice what do you think this purple hair and this pink stuff is coming out and weird looks and nose rings and tattoos they are giving voice amen what do you think what do you think is happening there with the with these these people cutting themselves to giving voice to a spirit [Music] but i believe there's a be young people in this day that's going to give a voice to god they've got to they are a voice to the word of god they're a testimony of jesus christ hallelujah they are the interpretation they are the young they are the prophecy or shall i say they are the interpretation of the hebrew children who would not bend who would not bow who would not burn amen they are they they are the interpretation of daniel amen who would who would not bend or bow in his time in the kingdom amen they are the men and the women down to the ages and it's now speaking out of their life men and women that omnipotence is showing through power over sin power over darkness power over the world this prophecy goes on he says i'm raised in a generations of young people that will stand with my word without fear or favor of man this is true and thou already know this very thing because i've even told you of it this is the hour to call a bride without spot a generation that will see all the promises of my holy writ somebody ought to said amen you have carried out this mission i've laid in your hand and the sacrifice all for this i the lord will therefore not forsake thee i will make myself manifest and continue to do so speak and fear not for i am your defense and strength and i will make it good saith the lord hallelujah amen to me that's just as real as it was when danny henry spoke amen there at youth camp their brother andrew spencer turned to me there and spoke a word of prophecy over me saying i've seen you sitting at your computer i've seen you in your tears i've seen you in every moment i have blessed you when others mocked you i blessed you when others criticized you but i have blessed you to build my body by the word hallelujah amen what would he say to brother branham and i want you to realize it's more to brother branham when god gave a word to brother branham he was giving it to you because thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way thou has walked to thine own choosing thou has for to protect the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee this in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass their tremendous victory in the love divine i'm telling you this morning there is a tremendous victory in the love divine in the holy ghost hallelujah and we will have that victory because we chose the right path because we went the harder way because we chose the narrow path we could be compromising preachers we could be denominational men hanging up like a puppet on a string but god called us for a purpose and for a reason hallelujah and it's a harder way it's a harder path and it is never easy to have to call right right and wrong wrong amen it's never easy it's the narrow path it's the harder way amen but thou has walked to thine on jesus you see you have to choose you young people you have to choose you know cain had to choose to do the will of god and he refused to do it the choice was set before him don't you know if you do right you'll be accepted if you come the way your brother did of the lamb and repentance you'll be accepted too but he refused to do it he knew the perfect will of god and refused to do it and god will bring the very perfect will of god of how you're to live how you to conduct yourself the kind of believer that you are to be and you can look right at that and fail to do it now but you have to choose but i was chosen before the foundational world yeah that's predestination but god knew what choice she would make amen now he didn't predestinate you on the choice on what choice you would make he predestinated you in christ so it's in christ where we are predestinated in christ jesus right amen so we have been predestinated to adoption that's the holy ghost we have been predestinated to receive of the spirit amen but you have to choose there's still something you've got to do you see moses had to choose the right path he had to give voice will i keep giving voice to pharaoh and pharaoh's daughter and the kingdom of egypt well i i'm a young prince i've been given voice i dress like a prince i look like a prince i conduct myself as a prince i am representing the kingdom of egypt but one day he realized that voice did not fit the inner seed that was in him come on there's many of you you've tried this on and you tried that and you tried to fit in here and you tried to fit in there but it didn't fit and one day you made a choice and you made jesus your choice and you gave him preeminence and that's when that dividend started working in you cigarettes fell off and dope and pornography and sin and that drunkenness and everything began to fall off why you gave him preeminence you let him reign you made him your king now moses had his foot on the throne he could enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and let me say sin has pleasures it's fun you know you look at him the marlborough man out on a horse having fun lariat cigarette cowboy hat he's having his fun he's a man you don't see him sucking it through this right here trying to give up on that in cursing the very saying because sin only has a season of pleasure let me tell you the pleasure we have received there's no season on it there's no end to it it only gets better hallelujah i found this pleasure when i was a young boy i'm here now 67 years old and i still have this place and i say it's sweeter it's better i see the effects i see it in my children i see it my family i see it in my church i see it on people i influence it's sweet but i had to choose it i had to choose it baptist school teacher pulled me aside and said look son you got you got a gift in your life go back to school get all the education you can you'll be the next billy graham that was the greatest man that she knew of she saw that potential she thought going to school would bring it out it would cultivate it make me it would make me what i would be but i had to choose a different path i could have chose to go that way i could have chose to to go and join a denomination have the biggest church come on we got men in this message that have got more talents more abilities than any you know that that men that are are are have thousands of people that are following them what is that biggest church in houston what's that guy's name say it again joel osteen ah he doesn't hold a spread of the talent that lays in the ministry of this message but they chose a harder path a narrow way a harder path amen they didn't they didn't go with it with the denominational system and that was you you you didn't choose that you didn't choose the world you you know you could be you could be the daryl you could be the deacon in the first baptist church the first one of texacana the biggest one that god or wherever he is you could be the deacon here brother david you could be you could be a great brother jill you could have sold your gift and then went out and made multiple of multiple thousands upon thousand dollars turn down how many opportunities but you chose a harder path a narrow way amen you walked in your own shoes and you had to decide god would let you go he'll let you go in the permissive will and remember you chose you chose to walk with him that's the way it is when you you're here this morning but because you chose to be here i mean brother johnny when you and sister with the wreath had come into our our our convention hall there in london and you heard the message preached hey man that truth got a hold of your life it's not been an easy path you didn't you didn't go the way of your relatives and your friends and and your your culture or whatever it every bit you had to choose a harder way the narrow path you chose that but as he repeated back to brother branham you chose it you didn't go the way of denomination but it is my way you have chosen my way hallelujah you chose my will you gave my will preeminence [Applause] thou has picked let me reassure you brother johnny sister aretha you have picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way hallelujah you chose to leave the hutterites you left the family behind you walked out with clothes on your back others of your family did the same thing sister cathy hey man it was a hard way it wasn't easy to leave mom and dad and sisters and brothers and family and things that was in your comfort zone don't get up mad at me when i try to get you out of your comfort zone that's what the word does it it breaks up the fallow ground it gets you to get to get you uncomfortable and to move out of your comfort zone will you make a choice you can choose i'm going to serve god i'm going to love him i'm going to give him my all thou has predict the correct and precise decision and it is my way and because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee look at the portion of heaven that awaited abraham now not something that is marked off in the heavens up there but the portion of heaven was the word that was given to him what did he get a new his wife renewed in health a promised son his own health renewed come on look at what he got he saw the resurrection before it ever took place he saw the redeemer jehovah jireh he saw the provided lamb hallelujah amen what was that a portion of heaven but what does god have for you what did god give brother branham because he didn't go with denomination god gave him a greater ministry than a divine healing ministry he gave him the ministry there to be the one to hear the voice of god to open up the seven seals where the lamb opened the seals and sent sent the revelation down to his angel on earth somebody helped me preach what was that a huge portion of heaven amen the entire book opened i'm trying to give something to you because of your decision that you sold out the world to follow the message a huge portion of the word is yours hallelujah if there is healing and there is miracles and there is translation faith and there is a resurrection and that word is everything and because of this momentous decision huge person of heaven awaits you and this choice in itself will be will give and make the time the tremendous victory in the holy ghost how many wants a greater victory in the holy ghost this bride is promising all the scriptures all the word keeping up in this generation amen let the musicians come hallelujah hallelujah a huge portion of heaven heaven came down in your come down in your family heaven has come down in the church heaven it's all yours it's all yours you made the right choice you made the right decision you gave him preeminence when you could have done other things now to receive your healing you're going to have to give the word preeminence over what the doctor says anybody else you're going to have to give the word premiums to receive the holy ghost you've got to give the word preeminence over everything else whatever it is and the deliverance in your life you've got to give him you got to say the lord omnipotent reign the lord omnipotent i want you to think of this as we come to close this morning brother timothy finds something to sing and when we worship the lord look at this verse 7 and chapter 19 let us be glad and rejoice can't you rejoice this morning amen and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come you see that can't happen without the woman giving him preeminence he must be the head his headship must be accepted for the marriage of the lamb has come and she's prepared herself she's made herself ready and he said unto me blessed are happy or they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb you know every one of you that's received that have been called to the married supper of the lamb and then he said these are the true saiyans of god now of course i believe what he said is true sayings but i'm talking about the shadow versus the fulfillment the negative versus the positive oh my thought just for money so the shadow don't show it all my shadow my hand will not show its fingerprints i have to hold it just right in the light or it won't show all my fingers the shadow don't always project what's coming perfectly neither did abraham neither did any of them down to the ages but i just want to say this those that are called to the marriage supper you see those were the saiyans of god but right here is the true saiyans [Music] do you understand what i mean not a negative not a shadow but the positive the true versus the shadow because we're no longer typing another age to come we're the fulfillment of it hallelujah and now the true word what god had in his mind for a bride the true word of god is now manifested in bright form just like it was the true word manifested in groom form [Music] you're the true saiyans the true word why you chose the harder way like abraham you had to give the word preeminence oh oh that ishmael might live before you he had to give that preeminence this is my will bless his smell yeah you just you know that's just good enough he had to give that word preeminence sarah had to give the word preeminence you have to give the word preeminence that's what he wants in your life [Music] we ought to worship him this morning let's sing it to him everybody [Music]
