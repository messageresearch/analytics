Lord you lift our Spirits Lord up into the Realms lord of the supernatural Lord where all things are possible we pray father we just love you with all of our hearts we give you this service in Jesus name amen amen you turn to Psalms chapter 23 Hebrews chapter 1 will be referring to that as well but just like to say thank you for your prayers amen been real down in the valley a little bit but amen we're coming out of it asking the Lord for strength tonight amen Psalms chapter 23 and verse one says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me to beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of The Shadow death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemy thou anointest my head with oil my cup run over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen God bless you you can be seated you want to speak something else tonight but I spoke this at the Ohio or the Oklahoma Youth Camp and so things begin to kind of whirl over me this afternoon about this subject so I'd like to speak to you on choosing Faith over fear amen choosing Faith over fear I I believe we do have a choice many choices in life that we make amen and and we have a choice to believe or not believe we have a choice to trust or not trust and you know uh this is the choice that David made in this scripture he said I'm walking through the valley of the shadow of death but I will fear no evil amen even though I'm in the Valley of this shadow of death and there's all kind of things around me and my enemies all around me I choose to still trust you amen I TR choose to not fear the evil that's around us and you know we've been on faith for a little bit and we know in Hebrews chapter 11 and the Amplified is says now Faith is the Assurance or the title deed or the confirmation of things hoped for that are that are divinely guaranteed it is the evidence of Things Not Seen it's the conviction of their reality in other words whether you see them or that you don't see them it does not matter there's still a reality that Faith grabs a hold of and Faith comprehends this fact what cannot be experienced by the physical sense for by this kind of faith the men of old gain Divine approval amen by faith that is that inherit trust or enduring enduring confidence in the power and wisdom and goodness of God we understand that the worlds the universes were framed and created they were formed they were put in order they were equipped for the intended purpose by the word of God so that which is seen was not made was not made out of things which are visible now we could go on and we maybe will one as we get into all these things but every Hebrew every hero of Faith amen they they were chose they were they were Heroes of Faith because they chose Faith over fear they chose to believe no matter what they saw no matter what they felt no matter what their circumstances were amen they chose faith and now we understand that faith will will will either paralyze your fear or your fear will paralyze your faith Amen in Hebrews chapter 11 as we would go down by faith Abraham by faith Sarah by faith Enoch by faith amen it wasn't by fear it was by faith amen because in spite of what they saw or in spite of what they felt they still believed amen and I I believe we we're we're that kind of people tonight I believe if these chapters would continue to be written there'd be others by faith this one and by faith that one and amen by faith we overcome amen because faith find sources that nothing else can see faith can find something that your eyes cannot declare tonight it it'll find something that you may may not be able to explain it you may not be able to tell it what it what how it's going to be but you believe it anyhow cuz why Faith tells you that faith is something that's revealed to you it may not be yet but it's revealed to you and you believe it as if it were so already amen faith is a revelation of the will of God brother R said the trouble is the church is scared oh I'm afraid of this don't be afraid you said well oh if I can just if I can just it isn't you it's him amen it isn't you it's him well I'm not worthy of healing being healed sure you're not worthy I'm not worthy nobody is but he is worthy it isn't our worthiness it's his goodness to us he said in the old Covenant he said if a little old mule was born and and you know was and a pasture born in a pasture and born with some flopped ears and knocked knees and and just a horrible looking mule crossy and his tail sticking up and you know just horrible looking if he'd look around his M say you know what soon as the Master of the House comes out he's going to knock me in the head I'm not even worthy of the food I eat I I'm no good but if his Mammy would just be would just instruct him for a minute she said now wait a minute son just wait a minute I'm going to tell you something maybe you don't know I I I want to tell you you know I know you I you don't know who you are see you're born under a Birthright and when the Master of the House said I don't care what you look like but when he comes out and this new mule is Born the thing he has to do is get a lamb without blemish and take that perfect lamb and he his life for your life he said then when that little mule would hear that he can forget what he looks like he can forget about all the imperfections and all of that he can just kick his heels up and have a big time he said that's the way it is with us we're imperfect we're no good we're born in sin we were shaped in iniquity we come in this world speaking Lies We were no good to begin with but to begin with God didn't look at you hallelujah amen to begin with God didn't look at you he looks at the sacrifice he looks at the Lamb of God he doesn't see me he doesn't see you and why he sees Christ Jesus died for me he said if you if you can find some fault with Jesus then your healing might not be yours but if you don't find no fault with him it's perfect amen God called you by his grace not what you was but if God what God W is the scripture said he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world that was God's word when God speaks it's as good as finished right now he say so how do you go to Stamp Out the baptism of the Holy Spirit how you going to Stamp Out the gifts how are you going to stamp all that out of the church you can't can't do it God spoke it it's going to be and when God foresaw by his for knowledge how he redeemed the world out of the sin and Corruption he slayed Christ before the foundation of the world and he spoke the word 4,000 years before it was ever manifested and the Book of Revelation said when the Antichrist come upon the Earth he will deceive all the Earth whose name were written in the Lambs except for those whose name were written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen from when the last Revival no from the foundation of the world God by for knowledge he knew you and he called you in Christ Jesus and he put is your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so what are you scared about are you afraid to take his word for anything tonight amen Don't Be Afraid call the thing right I am an heir to his I know I don't deserve it but I'm an heir anyhow why because I've been made an heir by the blood of Jesus Christ amen what is it that Heir I'm what if you're an heir what are you an air to I'm an heir to Salvation I'm an heir to the Holy Spirit I'm an air to everything that Jesus Paid for nothing I had to do I just fell air to it amen therefore I'm Healed why you healed because I'm an heir to it not because I deserve it I'm an heir to it my disease is gone why is your disease gone because I'm an heir to it amen my my Affliction is gone why cuz I I'm an heir to it he said oh perfect assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foraste of Glory Divine I'm an heir of Salvation purchased of God born of his spirit and washed of his blood that is our story what's your story that's my story I wasn't worthy but he made me worthy I wasn't I wasn't a perfect but he made me perfect I wasn't his but he made me his and he called me and he bought me he made me an air to everything that he has amen he said see a Abraham was just an ordinary man he wasn't nothing uh nothing special but God called him God put a call in his life God saw something in him and he called him and God seen the same thing in every born again man and woman here amen and Abraham wasn't afraid to put his to work his faith to work are you afraid the same faith that gave Abraham he gives you freely if he'll use it if he'll use it amen you say well I have a gun it'll shoot It's a good-looking gun it'll hang it hangs up on the wall oh sure you got a gun great what does it do it hangs on the wall he said that's Faith people say oh I'm a Christian I believe God can but what do you do about it put it to work turn it loose do something with it get out and hunt the devil up amen get out and hunt the devil up what he says you're still hurting you say well you're a liar put a beat on him get the scope dialed in don't be afraid to pull the trigger cuz it'll go off sure as anything hallelujah amen you know we've had our guns for for a long time you know the people in the South or the people in the US for that matter is proud of our guns but what good is a gun if it ain't going to do nothing but lay on the Shelf somewhere and what good is this going to do you if it's just written in a book but God wants you to put it in into action God wants you to make it something that's Liv not something that just read about not something just talked about not just something of 500 years ago or 50 years ago or 2,000 years ago or 5,000 years ago he wants something that lives today even now in this moment that you'll put faith into action and when Satan rise up you'll call him liar when Satan Rises up you say it ain't so devil I am a child of God I am a daughter of God I'm an heir to this take your hands off of God's Property but people get afraid and fear tries to come in this is where the uh the disciples were and we can read about it in Mark chapter 4 and verse 35 had to bear with me a little bit the same day when the evening was come he said to them let's pass over to the other side amen there there's peace in that right there we just take him at his word you know if they would have just said okay got in the boat and went they wouldn't have worried about the waves cuz he said let's go to the other side amen you know God God God does it that way he does it that way on purpose because he wants you to know he wants to see what you're going to react when you get in the waves when you get in the desert you get in you see that's what he told the children of Israel I've used it many times he said I'm going to take you out of a land but I'm going to take you into a land but he didn't tell them about everything in between why he did it on purpose one one he wasn't worried about everything in between he already had it taken care of but he wanted to see their reaction and how they would react to what he was doing and and God that's why God allows things to come upon us sicknesses and situations of life or things that we didn't see coming there's a lot of things maybe this morning that hit you you didn't see coming but God saw it coming before it ever got there nothing surprises our God we ought to know that by now nothing surprises him he knows every morning that's going to break he knows every day that's going to take he knows what's going to go on in the day every 24 hours of it he's not caught on by surprise he's not caught by maybe maybe this you know he's not sitting there maybe this will happen maybe this won't he already knows all about it but it allows us to get up and go through our day not knowing what we're going to face that day not knowing if we're going to get sick not knowing if we're going to face turmoil not knowing if we're going to face tragedies not knowing anything about these things but knowing he is there and he's able to help me no matter what I'm going through amen God wants to see what your reaction is going to be amen when you go through something that's a why he allows us to go through the things we go through now we don't always go all go through the same things now God knows what each one of us can take he knows I can take things some of y'all can't take some of y'all can take things I can't take and he promised he wouldn't put more on us than what we can bear amen I'm thankful for that scripture right there but let us pass over unto the other side now brother brandham brother Tims went through this before about the revivals and and and and different types brother brandham would use uh uh those that went off without Jesus and those that went with Jesus in their ship I personally believe we we got Jesus in the ship I don't believe we went off without him I I believe he's here with us and this is where we're coming from and he's laying there asleep and he's in between revivals and he's laying there resting and and but there arose a great storm of wind and waves beat the ship now that it was so that it was now full now you you you know that he knew this was going to happen when he said let's go to the other side do we believe that I I believe that I believe he knew but he's there resting and he's wanting to see what their reaction is going to be how they're going to react and how what they're going to do about it and and here they he's asleep and they wake him up Master don't you care that we perish and he rose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said to them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith you should have believed what I said you should have believed that I knew that this is going to take place and I would have the answer for it well the doctor says there ain't no hope and boy when that comes that's when fear steps in or there you know it's an incurable disease I love how brother Tim said it before there's not no such a thing as an incurable disease amen he said he said doctor says well there's no hope or it's paralysis or it's some leukemia or something like that fear begins to set in but it shouldn't did you hear that the the prophet of God said it shouldn't who is this that made the promise what are we living for why are we the Church of the Living God why are we filled with the Holy Ghost why is all why why to remember in times of trouble he's still here amen he stabilizes things he's the yesterday today and forever he's with us just the same he might be resting for a few moments between meetings but he's still here just the same he never left us he promised he would not he said but when trouble sets in and Faith of him being instead of having faith of him being with us fear sets in and when fear sets in then we really got trouble then just because it's trouble don't mean that you're in trouble into you start fearing the trouble then you got trouble he said you know people are scared to death of the world going to Pieces they ought to be some of them ought to be we're right there at the time this world going to go to Pieces it's prophesied in the Bible it's all written right here it's going to burn with fire but I'm not scared of the world going to Pieces there's going to be a thousand year Millennium Reign God won de feat is on purpose the one thing I pray Lord am I right when you come he said that's the only worry I have amen how have I pleased you Lord see don't fear What men's doing fear God Don't Fear him that can destroy the body but he that can destroy both body and soul in Hell In other words fear the lord not the devil that's right the devil can only do something to you temporary but God is the judge of all but fear tries to set in fear Comes Trouble Comes worry is always there but don't forget who's in your boat the Master's in the boat and he's the master of the wind listen it's more than a song We sing I know the master of the wind what's a beautiful song but it's more than a song Amen it's all wonderful to know the master of the wind to the wind comes and then you get all worried about how's how am I going to overcome all this stuff don't forget he's still the master your circumstances has not changed who he is your problems and situations around you does not change who God is amen should should should anything really bother us nothing should worry us we are his we are his if if if it ain't well we're false accusers we've been testified something ain't so but I believe it I believe that now we are sons of God not we will be right now we are we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you've been seeing it up on the screen I've mentioned it before about that dorky little sheep Walking With Jesus and that line that wolf over there growling and carrying on Amen I was just reading about uh uh oh my Pilgrim's Progress and the man who wrote what was his name lost it bunan John bunan and here he is he write writes about Christian and he he hears about these two lines that was in the path and everybody was so afraid and so worried about these two lines and the closer he's getting the more fear is's getting cuz he's hearing the Roar and he's hearing the more getting more intense listen really there's nothing worse than a roar of a lion as far as sit in fear I mean it shuts the whole jungle up we heard about you know that right and so he hears these Roars but as he gets closer he realized these lines are chained and the only thing that can actually get to him is the roar Hallelujah ain't that the way it is sometimes you realize when you were so worried about things and so worried about things if you'll just realize that line is Chained he can only go so far he can only do so much the only thing that can get to you is the roar we are sons of God not we will be listen I'm a Son of God if I'm sick does not change who I am I'm a son of God if I'm down in the valley the shadow of death does not change who I am you say well you're a son but you don't have any power we may not have power but we got Authority amen I don't may I may not have one bit of power but I got Authority amen just like that policeman out there and men that he may not have power to physically stop an engine going down the road or or a car or reach out there with his hand and stop it but he's got authority to stop it amen he turns on those lights I guarante you brakes will start to squeak amen you let him stand out there and hold his hand up and Blow That Whistle watch The Brak slides he hasn't got one ounce of power but he's got Authority and so is a man or woman that's been anointed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you might not be to read your name and box car car siiz letters I have any education at all but you got Authority and that Authority can look at that devil in the eye and say stop and Satan's wheels are begin to slide and and come to a halt in my name they shall cast out Devils he may not have a DD or a PhD but he that knows Jesus knows what's been given to him and where he stands amen they should have known by watching what this man did the Messiah he knew all things he knew this trouble was coming he knew the boat was about to get rocked rocked so did he also know your boat was about is about to get rocked my brother Timothy I I wish I could just have me a just a nice cool breeze on the ocean you know yeah that'd be nice but that ain't the fairy tale we're living in this ain't no fairy tale this is real a lot of battles listen you're either you're either in a trial or you just got out of a trial and you're about to go into another trial brother but trials doesn't change who you are it doesn't change who God is man I wish I had the strength to preach he knew knows all things he knows his trouble they should have known that he understood that the storm was coming and he knew it was going to happen and was only coming to test their faith he said maybe the Revival is led up to see what we'll do about it maybe sickness is struck struck you to see what you'll do about it nothing just happens without God knowing about it he knows it he knew the end he knows the end from the beginning and all these things happen because it's a test of faith how are we going to get there by all these others had to go by Faith by Faith by Faith by faith we're not going to get there just by Grace it's going to be by faith there's going to be somebody that nobody else believes they still believe when nobody else still stands they're still standing when everybody else pulls away they're still there why by faith that's what he said how the world would be said in Luke chap 21 verse 25 said there would be signs and the sun and the moon and the stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations with perplexities and seas and the waves roaring man if this world ain't roaring right now I don't know what roaring is it's roaring every day a right up about nuclear destruction every day I I mean I I know there was a Cuban Missile Crisis and there was this that and there's always been trouble but we're get there's a time of trouble coming has never been seen before this world is getting ready to fall off into the tribulation so it's not going to get better it's going to get worse so we see many 's hearts are failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draw it nigh amen when we see all these shakings going on these roarings going on it ought to do nothing but up make us look up because any day now the dead in Christ is going to rise any day now we're going to go home to be with Jesus any day now we're going to leave this old stinking rotten world and go to a place we've never dreamed of before eyes can't imagine our hearts can't even think good enough Amen to imagine the glory that is going to be revealed in US so don't fear quote fear is of the devil Everything Jesus would say fear not fear not constantly fear not fear not an angel when an angel would come what was a salutation fear not be Not Afraid see God doesn't want you to fear he wants you to believe every one of you believe amen one Accord everyone you know I got I just done a quick study on on on just the times mentioned in fear and there and of course there's a different translation so there's if you find other translations maybe mention more but just the uh the KJV excuse me you can see fear not is mentioned 63 times Be not Afraid is 26 time be careful for nothing one time I will not fear three times Whom Shall I Fear one time I shall not be afraid two times be not dismayed four times be of good courage 16 times be strong 32 times so God over and over and over and over reiterating so there's plenty of strength together when you are fearful there's plenty somewhere you can go to that when you are afraid you can go to the word of God and say God I'm I'm fearing a little bit go to the word I read these to the young people because men's hearts are failing for fear they got fears phobias listed from A to Z so for them to be listed they actually have to be diagnosed fears medically diagnosed so then of course I got to clicking on them good Lord every one of them's got their own way to overcome them and and then most of us by either by therapist or or psychology or or or or medicine I don't want none of that there's one way to overcome A to Z so I I'll just read them to you because I I like to call these fears out fear bathing some boy need to deal with that one fear of darkness fear of heights fear of flying fear fear of pain fear of Open Spaces fear of needles fear of riding in a car fear of men fear of air how in the world you going to live being afraid of air fear of choking fear of anger fear of flowers I asked the young people up there in Oklahoma I said what kind of pansy you got to be to be afraid of a flower can you imagine getting up and saying

of kissing fear of Love fear of fear do you see what the devil is trying to do to people they can't do normal activities without being afraid and if you're not careful he'll put you in a little box and you'll be afraid to be in your box I mean Jesus said their hearts are failing for fear we we're living in a time now that heart trouble is one of the leading Killers I'm only to half maybe halfway through Fe fear of feet fear of The Color Purple fear of ferns fear of fire fear of Halloween Fear of school fear of being stared at fear of the Moon fear of social evaluation fear of speed fear of Technology fear of the ocean fear of hair fear of thunder fear of needles and injections man that one's a bunch fear of holes fear of germs fear of witches fear of strangers fear of animals and the last one listed is fear of vacuum cleaning ERS but the devil wants us to get so consumed in fear why so you won't believe cuz fear actually hinders belief it's actually unbelief it actually is unbelief in what God can do for your situation and you begin to worry and you begin to fret you begin to build Bridges and before you know know you got nervous problems and a nervous stomach and you can't sleep at night why because of fear so if you're going to get over fear where you going to go to to the word of God I use this in Oklahoma so I don't know where she's at Katie forgive me there she is we was in uh Paris sister Katie I believe she's gotten Deliverance of it but she uh as a young girl and brother brandham you know it's a very very serious thing because brother brandham actually in in in the in discernment seen this had this woman that was all nervous and tore up he said what you problem is you got scared as a little girl by a dog and fear struck her generally When people's got real issues like that real phobia is because somewhere back there back there somewhere something happened and Katie had that as a little girl with a with a rat one time and scared her to death and I ain't going to go in that store but we was we was in Paris and with our family and we went to the Eiffel tire and we went up and top and come down and and me and sister Ruth and the sister that was guid us come down the elevator the kids want to stop at the little gift store and so they did so we're sitting there and by the we' got there last minute one of the last ones to be a to go up and it closed and so we're coming down after closing and we get down to the bottom and they before they've been p PES of people everywhere and we get down the bottom there's nobody but a few guards and so we just sit on the bench waiting for the kids next thing I hear what is that I got to look and there's rats running all over this place I probably counted 10 at least just running out there Gathering the food that had been dropped and things and I ain't talking about no little rats I'm talking about some good siiz ones and I thought oh boy if Katie sees these this is not going to be good cuzz we're a long ways from there BNB and and I thought man I don't know and all a sudden I hear some holler and I look up and the kids are running down the stairs you know and here they come and they get down the bottom I hear this Blood curling scream rat done ran across front of Katie listen I had to pray her the rest of the way home with my arm around to praying for her to get her to back to the Airbnb and I trying to tell her Katie that you are bigger than that rat that rat won't hurt you that rattle run from you you you need to realize who you really are and I I I got to thinking about that when I was telling that story up there in Oklahoma you know the devil is the biggest rat I know of and he'll run across our path and we'll scream and Carry On and we got to pray our way through listen you got to realize who you really are you're not some beating down nobody you're a child of God that was chosen to be perfect before the foundation of the world and the devil wants to run in front of of you that's just a perfect time to stomp him to put your foot over him and say devil I'm not going to cow down to you no more I'm a Child of God I can rise up above these things quit shrieking back in fear and realize who you are yeah just like that man brother Bram talks about when that devil started going boo and he started jumping back every time you jump back you get smaller your faith gets smaller everything about you get you just get all withered up inside of yourself you can't fight but he said all of at once he came back to something and he hit the word of God and he grabbed a hold of it and something went over him and he hollered boo back and when he did the devil got smaller and he got bigger it's time some of you start using faith on the word of God over your fear that's right cuz I'm here to tell you there's a whole lot more we listen to a whole lot of fears but there's a whole lot more faith than there is fear there's a whole lot more peace than there is anxiety there's a whole lot more joy than there is depression Deuteronomy 3 Verse 18 said I commanded you at that time say the Lord your God have given you this land to possess it and you shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel all that are meat for war but your wives and your little ones your cattle and for I know that you have much cattle shall abide in your cities which I've given you unto the Lord has given you rest unto your brethren as well as unto you and the and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God has given them Beyond Jordan then you shall return every man into his possession which I've given you and I commanded Joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings so shall the Lord do to all the kingdoms whether thou passest ye shall not fear them for the Lord your God shall fight for you hallelujah what is he telling him I've done it for against two of them and the rest of them is going to be the same way Hallelujah if he's given you one Victory he can give you another Victory if he's giving you victory over things of sin and graphy well surely he can give you victory over that Hellbound Spirit called fear the Lord will fight for you second and de Deuteronomy 31:6 be strong and of good courage do not fear nor be afraid of them for the Lord your God he is the one that goes with you he will not leave you or forsake you Psalms 34:4 said I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears choosing Faith over fear is a decision you must make it's seeking the Lord knowing he hears and trusting him knowing he will deliver sometimes we forget he helps we forget he's the deliverer we're in the middle of our deal trying to wrestle it all out trying to save ourselves and all along God is waiting and ready to hear our cry Psalms 56 and verse three says whenever I am afraid I will trust in you choosing faith is just choosing to trust God no matter what it's not that everything will be perfect and everything's going to be a bed of roses and everything's going to work out just great but in the moment of fear we should know by now where to turn to it's not to Google it's not to a three-step process or book or even a good friend it's turned to Jesus yes sir it's knowing that when we're afraid to turn to Jesus because he's the one who can calm our anxious Hearts we read in Psalm chapter 23 vers verse four yeay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for you are with me your rod and your staff they comfort me sometimes we Face the hardest the darkest the scariest of all trials it might look like sudden tragedy or maybe a diagnosis we we wasn't expecting or some family crisis we didn't see coming but even in the darkest of times God is still able to guard you and to carry you through amen when you feel like God is absent like he doesn't want seem to care we can rest in the faith and the rest in faith in the truth of the word that even then even in the dark even in the shadow of death God is there he's near ready for you to reach out and grab his hand he's not so far you can't reach there he's not so far from you I may seem that way but that doesn't mean that's so he's as close as your faith will declare him Isaiah 41 and verse 10 says fear not for I am with you be not dismayed for I am your God I will strengthen you yes I will help you I will uphold you with my righteous right hand God's hand is a beautiful thing in Scripture because it it's speaking of strength so when we talk about you know having faith in God and God's hand in each situation there's an instruction the scripture is talking about that and there's an instruction given when you see his hand don't fear it's easy to say but many times difficult to to live fear not but over and over God's word says fear not the question we might have is how do we fear not when everything around us is calling for questions and calling for fear the answers is found in focus in our hearts not on what we see but upon the God on the word of God and his promises that there is more for us than there is against us God is with us God gives strength God gives help god holds us God hand is not clench close sin if we're going to survive his hand is stretched out and is actually picking you up and holding you up and making sure you're going to make it he's not standing back I'm I'm not going nope I ain't helping this time nope nope nope no his hand is there under you and it's guiding you why he wants to make sure you're going to make it that's right cuz he knows if his hand wasn't there you wouldn't make it but he'll hold you in the middle of of your storm in the middle of your trial in the middle of your struggle that hand is there propping you up Isaiah 41:13 says for I the Lord your God will hold your right hand say unto you fear not I will help you just like a child needs help by a hand across the street God reaches down his hand to help us cross the most difficult Paths of Our Lives not only that did you hear what the see what the scripture says for I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand he said give me your hand and while you're Crossing that road he's saying fear not I'm helping you you're going to make it you're going to make it to this Valley you're going to make it through this struggle you're going to make it through this difficulty cuz I got you he isn't silent his lips ain't closed never given advice never never giving you wisdom never but he gives a command fear not then that fear not is followed by one of the most beautiful promises I will help you I mean we know what it's like when somebody says I'll help you struggling getting something done some trying to make ends meet sub whatever I'll help you but what is it when God says I'll help you I got you I got this I'll take care of it Zephaniah 3 and verse 17 says the Lord your God is in your midst and he's a Victorious Warrior he will exalt over you with joy he will be he will be quiet in his love he will rejoice over you with shouts of Joy Psalms 91:1 says he who dwells in the shelter of the most high shall rest in the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he's my refuge and my Fortress my God in whom I trust he will cover you with his feathers under his wings you will find Refuge his faithfulness will be your Shield you will not fear the terror by night nor the air that flies by day nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness or the plague that destroys at midday a thousand may fall by your side and 10,000 by your right hand but it will not come near you for he has commanded his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways because he loves me sayeth the Lord I will rescue him I will protect him for he acknowledges my name he will call upon me and I will answer him and I'll be with him in trouble and I will deliver him and honor him we can think about St Paul on the Shipwreck what was he told he was told by the angel everything was going to be well so he just took him at his word he was told he was going to go to Rome so he just took him out his word gets there Building A Fire getting Gathering a bit of wood to try to get warm and the snake bites him he don't get all fearful and Afraid he'd done been told where he was going hello somebody and so what did he do he just shook him off in the fire that's what that's the faith we need that's the faith we got to have amen we've been told where we're going we're going in a rapture so the snake may try to bite us along the way just shake him off in the fire say devil you ain't got no hold on my life you ain't got no say over what I am or who I what I do I'm not even worried about you or your Venom take yourself and go back to hell where you came from that's how a Believer shakes the devil off in the fire go back to hell where you came from mus positions can come say sister by the grace of God he can

had a right to fear sickness you had a right to fear Satan and his tactics but that time for fear is over for we have received a prophet that didn't restore us to the fear of the fathers but it
