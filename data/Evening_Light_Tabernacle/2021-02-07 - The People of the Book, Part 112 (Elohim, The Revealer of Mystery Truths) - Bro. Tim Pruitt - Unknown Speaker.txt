it up lord open our understanding let us know lord the hope of our calling and what you called us for in this day let us see lord the word that has been revealed in this hour lord as you have as you have opened the book for us so we can see every good and precious promise and to us their yes and their amen and we accept him lord in jesus name amen amen god bless you let's turn to luke chapter 17. we're going to read from the 28th verse this morning and then we'll read over in the book of john chapter 1 verse 1 but right now luke 17 28. likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed notice this is revealing of the son of man the son of man is the word amen so it'll be it'll be as it was in the days of the revealing of the son of man when we'll also have sodom conditions again upon the earth and also a destruction upon the earth and we know that we're already now well into the sixth vision and knowing that the seventh lays right ahead total annihilation of the world that we know of for them to burn off for the millennial reign these are not guesswork these are not fiction this is prophecy of the last days and we are here amen everything lays in place never has man been able to do this destroy the world in just minutes burn it over with fire in just minutes we're here in a very special time amen john chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with god and the logos was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen god bless you can be seated we're going to read one more verse from the scripture this will come from genesis chapter 18 and verse 22 and the men turned their faces from themts and went towards sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord and abraham's day the phenomena was being done the pillar of fire the light the logos came down in abraham's day and as we have said he touched the soil and gathered the necessary elements to make a body for himself and for two angels and he stepped into them in genesis 18 and verse 17 the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do noted now he is going here to reveal to abraham the secret um in this in this coming he will reveal the secret of of sarah and her change of her body um and they're concerning the long-awaited son for sarah that was isaac for us it's the second coming of jesus and the change of the body the secret of redemption so what was he doing he was breaking the silence to sarah of her part in the promise he was removing the seals off of his plan of redemption showing her that she was not forgotten i'm glad to declare to you today we have not been forgotten amen that god is present in this generation in a very special and peculiar way man to reveal himself to a group of people in the end time man from whom he will call out a people for his namesake it's actually the finishing of his calling out because he's had a calling out in every generation down through every church age but i i want to just say you know as we look at this scene in particular it is interesting while two went down to sodom and they would bring a message to sodom investigate sodom looking for righteousness and could only find just um you know a few that would actually um receive that were righteous and would receive the angel's message and and i want you to remember lot was in such a backslidden condition that um his his message that he heard of the angels when he went to his sons and laws he was mocked by them and it really behooves us when we live that we live a life before others i mean that when we talk about what god is doing in our generation they take us seriously because god is doing some very phenomenal and as we have said some extreme things in this generation now of course as we said and was pointed out that elohim did not go down to sodom but he stayed there with abraham's group and i want to just declare to you today that that presence of that angel is still manifest himself today through the bride's body anointing men to preach the gospel amen they are the angel's voice listen to me carefully they are the angel's voice to speak the mysteries that have been revealed by the angel and to bring faith to sarah the bride of christ that by supernatural means by the pouring out of the holy ghost that a people now is being prepared for the coming of the lord now as we're talking about this angel i i want to speak about him for a little bit because scripturally who is this angel you know in as um we often declare in our generation that there has been you know even photographed the pillar of fire and um and so in that great photograph of the pillar of fire which would be examined by a question of men who who examine question documents and they would have to declare that the light struck the lens that that was this would be the only supernatural being that was ever photographed and and the thing about it is you and i could you know dismiss this easily if that was all of the vindication but service act of service after service the angel lord would appear in the services and he would appear not always in a visual means but we knew he was there because he would tell things that no man could know that only god could know amen so it would be again that we we would declare to this generation the the very um that the angel of god was here and he was again leading the people like he did in the days of the exodus that again that we are in a time in a day where the pillar of fire is once more leading the church are you with me so we want to talk about scripturally who is this angel now in the first exodus he is a light he's a fire in a bush that doesn't burn now i want you to remember that god is light this is one thing that he is first john 1 5 this is the message that we have heard from of him and declare to you that god is light and in him there is no darkness at all so we come back again to the original message once more that god is light amen that when he shines a light up on a subject when he light shines light upon a human being he can tell who they were where they came from what their disease was whether what what kind of doctor it was or to describe everything right down to the very minute details are you with me amen but he also is one who knows the word of god and he is his own interpreter now so god is light and in him there is no darkness at all so we'll we have come back to the message that we have heard from the beginning amen the same light that paul would meet on the on the road to damascus the same light that would lead to children of israel that same life is here with us today amen leading the church in this end time amen so god is light and in him is no darkness now again in exodus 40 and verse 38 it would also be shown as the cloud of the lord was upon the tabernacle by day and and the fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of israel throughout all of their journey so we see again the cloud of the lord is is a is one description and the other description it is also described as a fire a cloud and a fire a cloud and a fire now these are were in the sight of the house of israel so god brought it into view to let them know um i'm the one that is leading you to this promised land and i'm the one that has given this to you listen god wants you to be assured to know that he's the one in charge he is the one that's leading this bride this is his message because he is light and it is only right that he would come again and show himself as a light as he would show himself in the burning bush in exodus chapter 3 and verse 1 now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of media and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called him out of the midst of the bush notice who it is it was an angel but it was god the lord god called him out of the midst of the bush so it was god coming down as the angel of the covenant the angel or the messenger of his own word i want you to get it this is a god who is very very concerned about his word he said none of it will return to me boy it's going to accomplish what i said it to do and you can rest assure in this evening time if god gave a word if the holy spirit is right there with it to perform that word and to bring that word to pass amen and when and so he said and and he called out of the bush moses moses and he said here am i and moses and and and he said draw nothing not hitler put off thy shoes throughout thy feet for the place whereon thou standeth stand in his holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father notice this is what he wants to remind you when when he comes to reveal himself he's going to place himself as the god of thy fathers he wants you to know he is the god of pentecost he is the god of the book of acts he is the god of the gospels he is the god of the old testament amen he is that god that is that present god to come and he said i'm the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and then he tells him his purpose i have come to investigate i'm going to bring judgment on the nation the last plague is going to be death now remember this whole thing is a prophecy because the last plague that strikes is death notice he says i've seen this i've surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i want you to understand whatever you're going through god's already seen it he said i've seen the affliction i've seen what the enemy has done to you i see what has happened what's now and and i've heard their cry every prayer every crowd of god i've heard it amen and uh by the reason of their tasks my skirts for i know they're sorrows amen but i don't just know their sorrows but in this generation i'm going to do something about it it is now time is now the hour for a deliverance it's the time of the exodus am i when god comes down like this amen it is coming down for deliverance and he says i've seen your afflictions i know how long the church is languished i know how old sarah is i know how long the promise has been but i am here to bring that promise to pass i'm going to see it to the finish i'll perform what i sent it to do amen and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and oh i love this i am come down first thessalonians 4 says the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout amen that's a message and this would be the first phase come on the first phase the very first phase of the exodus there was god coming down with a message go tell pharaoh let my people go and go tell my people i've got a land prepared for them i'm not leaving them in this egypt but i'm bringing them out of their bondage i have come down and i'm going to send a prophet with a message did you ever think about malachi 4 i'd like to just look at it just for a minute let's go to malachi 4. we usually go five and six but let's go malachi 4 and let's go about verse let's try about verse 4. put that up there for me please malachi 4. yeah remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded him in horeb for all of israel with the statues and judgment next behold i send unto you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so lest i wipe it all off i'm going to send elijah but i'm sending elijah but i want you to thank moses are you with me notice it speaks that moses and elijah here think of moses but i'm saying elijah because it's another exodus it's another given of the word before going into the promised land being raptured are you with me so i want you to think i'm going to do something in the last day before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and i want you to think moses but it's going to be elijah i sin but you see it's a parallel because what i did in moses day is what i'm going to do in this day what did the angel tell brother branham i'm going to give you two signs as i gave moses amen what was it it was signs of of power over the enemy is that right the rod with moses was a sign of power over the serpent come on and the and again the sign that god would give in this day would be power over the devil he would show his healing his deliverance he would dust his hand in there and and his bosom and he'd come out leprous which is a type of sin and he would stress it back in and it would come back out clean amen what was it god was demonstrating his power given a sign to them that moses was sin of god now of course there would be jettison jamborees that would come along and and seemingly um uh dispute that moses was sent from god that perhaps he was just like any other soothsayer you know meeting an angel was about like um joseph smith and the mormons are you with me impersonate us and man they go there to impersonate but i i want you just to see this real clearly but it's a time of deliverance where god has come down for the purpose of deliverance and bring them into a land that is flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the and the hybrites and the jebusites so he says i'm going to dispossess them but i'm going to bring you into that land amen therefore i behold the cry the children of israel is coming to me and i've seen the oppression this is verse nine uh i've seen the oppression aware with the the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that i might bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt so god does something very special he sends an angel and a pillar of fire and he brings a message and then he sends a prophet with a message to bring them under the token so that once under the blood come on they can leave egypt and go into the promised land notice again exodus 23 20 he said behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared now there is an angel that goes with us to keep us in the way to keep us from straying to keep us from getting confused pulled aside make just another denominational wandering down in egypt but i've got an angel that's going to go with you i'm not going to leave you but i'm taking you in there amen i'm just going to tell you even when moses cannot go any further i'm still going to take you in that lamb now so this is exodus 33 verse 12 and moses is asking the question who is going to lead us who is it's going to lead us from from here and he said moses said unto to the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou has not let me know whom thou will sin with me yet thou has said i know thee by name and thou has also found grace in my sight isn't it wonderful to know he knows us by name and he and we have found grace in his sight but if moses said i want to know who is it that's going with us amen verse 13. now therefore i pray that if i find grace in thy sight show me now that way that i may know thee that i might find grace in thy sight in other words if you're pleased with me teach me your ways i may know you so if you can see this this is a time where the the lord the angel of god will be teaching his way now remember jesus is that way so again it's going to bring a church back to the original gospel of jesus christ that has been contaminated by denominationalism down through the ages watered down confused and convoluted but this god said i'm going to teach you your my way because you have found grace in my sight and i consider that this nation is thy people hallelujah i want you to understand you're not only people of the book you're people of the angel of the book [Music] and he says my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest and he said if thy presence go not with me carry us not up from hence and then moses so he said your president don't go with us don't send us up from here amen if you're not going to see this through and man if you're just going to abandon the project if you're just going to show us a couple of signs and get our hopes built up that we're in the end time and his rapture age and yet we see all this sodom around us and we see even in this case the egyptians have been on their trail and going to try to captivate them again you know if you're not going with us am i don't play with our heart amen but assure us assure us that you're going with us uh serious you're gonna complete this task assurance you're taking us in a rapture that you're not leaving us here that you're not abandoning your project i want you to understand this is not a prophet's project this is not a man's project this was god's project [Applause] amen he says for wherein shall it be known that i and thy people have found grace in our sight is not this favor shown by you being with us we can talk about grace all we want to we you know and a lot of songs are being song about grace and you know grace that amazing grace that is so amazing and and songs written over and over and over about this amazing grace and of course people feel like this grace is just a something of favor that blankets out all our wrongs and all our you know all our iniquities in other words all the things we just continue living on our sins but the grace of god makes up for us but i want you to see this real clearly it's not that at all but the gracious is that you are with us the grace shown is you give us power over sin the grace is you heal our sick among us the grace is you're in the church you're working in the body that's the grace is it not that though who is with us so we should be separated in other words a church that's what a church is means called out that we be a church separated and i am not people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth because what else tell me what else distinguishes us from all the other people on the face of the earth except his presence listen if we lose his presence we've lost everything when a church abandons god god turns him over to abandonment [Music] and this is what he has done look what has happened to the sodomite churches today god has turned them over to their own lust woe to demand that god turns over amen but what else will distinguish us from all the other people on the face the earth and the lord said to moses i will do this thing because thou has spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight because i'm pleased with you in other words and i know that my name and he said i beseech thee show me thy glory and he said i will make all thy my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy on whom i will shall mercy and he said thou cannot see my face for no man shall see me and live and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock now notice what he's doing a place near me that i'm going to bring you into and in this place you're going to see things that others have never been privy to see it shall come to pass what my glory passes by i will put you in a cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass and i will take away my hand and i shall see my back parts but my face shall not be seen therefore well i will remove my hands and you'll see my back but my face must not be seen watch these words now but look how different it is in our age since the blood of jesus christ amen when i'm just covered with his hand we've been covered by his blood and he shows us the sevenfold glory of his person he shows us his complete countenance come on the bible says in revelation 10 his countenance or his face is as it was the sun shining in his glory that god would actually reveal a people his countenance now moses would see god in theopenic form but when we continue into the next chapter 34 he comes and is revealed in word form notice he would first be revealed in theophanic angelic form and now he will be revealed in word form now i want you to catch this because god is doing more than just reveal himself in an angel to a prophet but he's now revealing himself through the word to a prophet and thus to a people so look in in verse 1 and the lord said unto moses hear thee two tables of stone like in the verse and i will write upon these tables of words that were in the first tables which thou break us and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself to me in the top of the mount and no man shall come up with thee neither shall any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks and the herds feed before the mount and he hewed two tables of stone like the first and moses rose up early in the morning went into the mount sinai as the lord commanded him and he took his in his hand the two tables of stone and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord and and the lord passed by and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious long-suffered and abundant in truth and he passed in front of moses there as he's proclaiming now and keeping mercy from for thousands and forgiven iniquity and the transgression and sin that shall by no means clear the guilty vision the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children under third and fourth generation and from there god in this appearing would begin to take and write his word in tables of stone now notice the same thing happens in the end time because god takes his finger and writes it in your nature because he's going to have a people who learn the book amen that it's written in their lives it's written in their hearts notice now who is this angel of the lord you see this angel of the lord stands out in distinct preeminence in the whole old testament there was definitely a theophanic mediator unique and distinct he introduced himself as deity he called from heaven on two occasions once he stopped abraham from sacrificing isaac and again he promised him countless descendants like we sung about he he was the spokesman of the three men who came to uh to abraham to announce the impending doom of sodom and to foretell the coming of the promised son it was the angel lord that abraham would detain in his supplication for sodom and and for his nephew lot you know he was signing and crying and asking god for salvation remember that that was the abraham group and god was looking for two things he was looking for faith and finding none he gave it amen he asked will i find faith on the earth and find him to that there wouldn't be any faith on the earth come on somebody he sends a prophet and elijah to turn the heart back to faith is that right but he also is a sealant angel and he's looking for those who is signing crying for the abomination done in the city and here again abraham is signed and crying not for god to destroy sodom but for god to save the lost you see that is the real heart of any believer god somehow saved them in this case he was he he was he was asking for a hundred asking for fifty he was asking for ten he was getting down to whatever he wanted at least my my my nephew saint joey straight away still save my my kindred lord amen there ought to be something that is crying out in the hearts of believers this morning lord we see sodom we see the fire about to fall we see the judgment coming on the earth but lord oh god if you can find 10 righteous amen but whatever save my loss love one lord whatever you have to do if they got to go through tribulation whatever they got to do save them anyhow [Music] as i said one of the main purposes of a church is to cast out devils amen and that's what saving the lost is is casting satan amen i'm fully expected sister misty was talking to me last night about wanting to be delivered from cigarettes i'm fully expecting a full deliverance today because that's one job of the church cashing out she'd quit him on her own if she could but let me tell you that wouldn't save her it's going to take god to save her and he's here to say did you hear what i said i have come down to deliver i am present for that purpose [Music] now the angel lord would accompany eliezer on his mission to get a wife for isaac he would appear to jacob in a foreign land and identify himself as the god of bethel and instructed him to go back home and later on the way home he would wrestle with the angel and said i have met god face to face it was the angel lord who appeared to moses in the burning bush and identified him as the god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob it would be the same angel that would later guide and guard the children of israel in their exodus from egypt it was aged the lord who would talk with moses in the wilderness and deliver the ten commandments to him on mount sinai that we were just reading about it would be the angel lord that would also block balaam who on his road to curse israel and refuse to let him bring curses on his people i want you to know god's got your back amen even when the enemy looks on the backside and said there's reason to curse them they got plenty of faults amen god's looking through the blood and he ain't seeing your faults he's seeing a promise these are my people and i forbid any false prophet to curse them they can't use my name to curse they're my people [Applause] hallelujah now it would be the angel lord identify himself to joshua as the commander of the army of the lord and judges would show us clearly that the angel lord is god in his self-manifestation you know in the early time period of the judges when the israelites were forsaking god the angel lord appeared at bocam and he identified himself as the one who brought them out of egypt i'm going to read it from the living bible judges two and one the angel lord appeared at bocam coming from gilgal and announced to the people of israel i brought you out of egypt into this land i promised your ancestors and i said i would never break my covenant with you notice this the angel says i brought you out it says i brought you to this land and i said i would never break my covenant so if you see that the angel of the lord here was god in his self-manifestation and he was declared to them that he was more than just a messenger though he was the messenger because he was a messenger of his own covenant amen he's a messenger of his own work so in that form he's an angel but he's god as a messenger now i want you to understand just exactly what the pillar of fire is is not just an angel it's god as a messenger it's the logos itself coming down to bring a message to people saying i have not forgotten my promise i've seen the afflictions i've seen what's going i've been waiting for this day and i am come down for a purpose and i'll tell you what he's not going to leave until he takes a bride from here are you with me amen so again the angel lord would appear to get him and would commission him from military leadership and when gideon offered him food he said place it on a rock and the angel touched it with his staff and and a fire consumed it and the angel vanished let's read about it judges 6 11 there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which was in ophra which pertained to joaste avezaite and his son gideon thresh wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the lord appeared to him and he said unto him the lord is with thee the mighty man of valor now i want you to notice gideon is over here he's hiding away from all of the oppression and he's got his wheat there that he's hid in a in a secret place that he's hiding it come on amen but god says i don't see you as a coward i see you as a mighty man of valor i'm not talking about what you want and i'm not even talking about what you are i'm talking about what i'm fixing to make you did you hear that church amen you may be looking at your own weaknesses amen and how little you are and how afraid that you can be sometimes but god says i see you you are a man of valor he's not looking at your past he's not even looking at your presence he's looking at your future hallelujah of people he could say like abraham abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in the faith hallelujah salvation is of the lord that means he can make you anything he wants that amen and gideon said oh my lord he said if the lord be with us why is all this but following us um you know and where are be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up out of egypt but now the lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the lord said unto him go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites now brother branham would say this and if god be with us were the miracles he said gideon was a scriptural man when the angel lord said notice it wasn't the angel of the lord here it was in the lord capital l-o-r-d it was not an angel it was god it was a theophany in a man in the form of a man light appeared to abraham back in the wilderness it looked like a man and therefore being a messenger he was the angel of the lord so notice what he said it was here he was and that's the authentic presence notice this and and he says he appeared to him and when he he was a messenger and being a messenger he was the angel of the lord so you can see now god becomes the angel of the lord in that in that office can we call it as the messenger of his own cabinet i i want you to remember remember in revelation 10 well who comes down in the last days and i saw another mighty angel and there was a there was a rainbow over his head he was that's a covenant there he was a covenant angel and he's coming and he declares he swears to an end-time people that the delay is over the time to hold things back to keep that keep it all a mystery is now finished with i'm telling you we are living in some tremendous hours look here he would appear to manoa and his wife promised him a son samson who would deliver his people looking judges 13 19 manoa took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel did wondrously in manoa and his wife looked on for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar that the angel lord ascended in the flame of the altar notice here the angel ascends right up into the fire and vanishes out of their sight now he's bringing a message and he's bringing the messages that i am bringing forth a church a samson somebody help me he will have seven locks seven church ages come on amen and this will represent his power with god because christ is there in all seven ages and i made a covenant with him and he's going to defeat the enemy amen you know the story he becomes blinded captivated and blinded but is that the end of it no come on what happens god does what restores his strength restores the covenant restores his glory somebody help me preach a man and brings a greater deliverance than everyone's down through the ages you see we are living in the fulfillment of prophecy where the angel of god comes to announce i'm calling a people for my namesake now he would appear to david at the threshing floor of ornin where he stopped to destroy the angel and afterwards commanded the prophet god to order david to build an altar on that rock this is a place the very place then that david would buy to build the temple you know that in ezekiel the angel lord receives a report from the angels that patrolled and investigated the earth and then asked god to have mercy upon jerusalem i'm trying to show you this this angel is is a mediator he is always looking out on the behalf of god's children whatever age that it's been and if he was that then and he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still the mediator come on mediating the covenant providing healing delivering salvation rapture everything comes out of that covenant that he mediates on your path now who was this angel lord he was he is the pre-incarnate logos in other words the logos before it became incarnate in jesus now he is the district personal self manifestation of god the incarnate logos the word made flesh notice we read when it come to jesus and his beginning he doesn't take it to the earthly beginning john takes him now as that eagle takes him there to that to to his true beginning in the beginning was the word amen so the word was there before there was a beginning he was the logos amen it would be the very first visible sign of god as god would condescend start condescending toward flesh he would come into a form that he could be seen and this would be the logos amen a sacred fire now that would that the spirit would dwell in now that the theophanic presence could come and and manifest himself in what's now he is he is john declared he is the creator for he said by him by the logos was all things created then that the that logos became flesh and dwelt among us amen now this is angel is the angel of the covenant none other than the lord jesus christ somebody with me now none other than the lord jesus christ the angel of the covenant now if you'll go with me to hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12 he says for the word are the logos the logos of god is alive you know there's one thing that the word is going to do it's going to present the resurrected christ not somebody help me preach now not the crucified christ but the resurrected christ yes he was crucified amen but we must see him as a resurrected christ the living god [Applause] hallelujah amen there are many that are presented him as the crucified christ but friends unless he rose from the dead and shared that life and birth birthmore sons we're all men most most helpless and most miserable for the logos is alive amen it is powerful it is sharper than any two ancient sword it pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints in the moral and as a designer of the thoughts and entrance of the heart this is the logos he discerns the heart he can divide between soul and spirit amen how often did i that we've seen brother branham said you know i said there's something about you that says welcome the angel lord there's a welcoming spirit to him that's something true with every christian every child of god you have a welcoming spirit for the angel of god to come to there's a kindred a kinfolk man are you with me amen and so we could look down as we read the other day you know i betty dowdery i wanna look down now into your soul like a doctor would look into the body i'll look right down in your soul has everything been right with you and god this is a god that doesn't judge from appearance he didn't judge from church attendance come on he he there deals with you on the basis of a new birth you must be born again amen and he divides the center between soul and spirit and the joints in the moral and as a deserter of the thoughts and the intents of the heart you know just recently i just rejoiced as i i would um and and matthew get close to the lights there please because i may want you to dim them but i i just want you to to to go back it was about 1970 or 1971 something like that we'll see the this the um the deep calling to the deep for the first time because um you know we it was in some archives and and and we didn't know about it and somebody found it and made arrangements to purchase it and we were able to rejoice in that and and you know it just brought back even what i had seen in my childhood is as i knew the angel of god was there in the building because no man could know the things that was discerned except the angel of god was present i had to be somebody greater than a man i'm trying to get something to you we we got a word that is ministered by the angel of the lord the messenger of the covenant jesus christ himself i want to get it to you this morning as we as i speak on the elohim the revealer of mystery truths that this is where we're at amen that god did not trust it to a man he did not he came himself with the message i want you to get it from from my heart to yours today that elohim is a revealer of mystery truths that what we believe is not just a man made made up something it's a message from almighty god [Applause] god himself so innocent in this generation that he would not let us go on in the era of the past but he would send a message to turn your heart back to faith again not just believing for miracles but believe in the original faith the original word the original truth [Music] that we're not just following cunningly devised fables 1970 one or two i sat there for my first time to watch this film and recently you can get on youtube and watch it and i would recommend you go back through it again but they went through it and and and colored it made it in color and and it's very very nice very well done but i sat there and i just wept as i knew the angel of god was present i didn't see an angel though some did though some did in fact when you go and watch it and we won't play it this morning but in the last part of deep call of the deep when they when that man is called up for you know wanting i want an old-fashioned pentecostal revival to break out in his area and that's why he was standing he wasn't sick but but you know later some of the believers from brother ron's church and brother ron spencer he lived in that area he he would meet this man and he said i saw that angel and he said not only that but we have that revival he said we had about a two three week revival where he just was a tremendous pouring out of the spirit of god i don't know how you feel this morning but i don't want a temporary revival alone come on amen we want a revival and we should be in a revival that lasted a rapture that gives you a passion gives you a lot for truth [Music] amen but then we were watching you know again as the hearts was disarmed and you knew the angel of god was dead as we'll listen to it just for a moment what do you think that knows your life was it jesus christ you accept it to be that you know that was something supernatural is here and if you believe it to be the lord jesus as i preached it out of the word and you believe it to be the lord jesus what was it it was the lord jesus not in the body of the lord but in the same form he was before he became flesh back to the logos back to the pillow fight amen so let's just let's just go back into that just a moment and let's just let's just review some of that in in our in our ministry today um we got we should have that ready right all right now near sister of course that won't hurt you now that's that's just his presence that you're conscious of and i'd an audience i'm i i'm your brother i this is not psychology i felt that come into the audience it isn't it's almighty god it's not psychology no it is now don't do that just think of being the lord jesus be in one accord now sister i just want to speak with you just a moment we're strangers i suppose but jesus christ knows the both of us this is our first time meeting on earth but he knows you and he's fed you all your life and he knows me and if i your brother and by his grace by a divine gift that i had nothing to do with the coming i was born a little baby the first thing i can remember was a vision now i want you to look this way just a moment of course you're sick and you're suffering with the condition it's a it's a dark spirit around it's death and it's in a form of cancer and the cancer is located on the breast and your senior examined by someone's strong and it's a you got a ruptured condition and the rupture is in the bowels and you have a stomach trouble also a severe heart trouble it caused you pain here a few days ago you're setting sideways on the side of a bed and nearly passed out looking towards your window are those things the truth yes that was true all truth or whatever it was of course it's gone from me but what do you think that was that knows your life was it jesus christ you accept it to be that thank you you're willing you know that something supernatural is here and if you believe it to be the lord jesus as i have preached it out of the word and you believe it to be the lord jesus yes yes i know there's a dark spirit hanging at you yet it's something very serious say i see you your name is uh eva and your last name is york and you live in this city and your house number is 613 6th street is that right you're going home to be well [Music] i just have faith don't doubt the scripture has said go ye and sin no more unless a worse thing come upon you sin is unbelief sin is not drinking smoking gambling that's attributes of sin you do that because you believe not jesus said go in sin or disbelieve no more or worse things will come upon you have faith in god bleeding with all your heart [Music] i see the light following that woman yet it's just that that's her just left it's hanging by a colored person there yes the lady there with that gallbladder and rupture you believe the lord jesus make you well lady sitting there that white thing around your neck if you believe it with all your heart you may raise up and claim your healing and be made well in the name of the lord jesus god bless you have faith in god does thou believe [Music] [Music] you have a rupture don't you sir sitting out there isn't that right you were sitting there praying lord have that man speak to me is that right if that's right raise up your hand stand up on your feet your faith has healed you brother go home jesus christ makes you well the same lord jesus you don't need to be up here you need to have faith just believe god with all your heart and you shall have what you ask for jesus christ will grant it to you if you will only believe but you must have faith you must believe him with all your heart and god will bring it to pass the patient excuse me sir you believe with all your heart you do now you're just a bit excited because of the presence of his being standing here and um i believe you're from out of town you come from a capital to richmond virginia you have a cancer it's in your inside of your mouth on your jaw is that right you want to go home and be well accept jesus as your healer and in the name of jesus christ may it leave the man go away from him amen god bless you sir go believing having faith what are you saying i know now that seeing you you're becoming a young looking person much younger than what you are in my presence you are suffering with some sort of a headache and it's uh it's come many years ago about 25 years ago your headache started and it's been bothering you ever since you have been a great believer and you have uh you have prayed for this hour of standing here now you have said in prayer to god that if you could only get to me that the if i would pray that your headaches would see those things true everything that is true now you heard what said that that wasn't me that was just my voice was those ever what it was it's something i i remember seeing a young person or something was it this way it was said there that just the way it was said now you believe that god did it you believe god i'm sure you're sure that god is here just a moment i see something else a young woman seems to be standing near you it's a it's a daughter and yes she was just fixing to go on a trip somewhere you were going to see her and she's from indiana richmond indiana that's where she lives and she her husband is a minister and she has wrote you a letter something telling you not to come because i was coming here is that right you're healed [Music] now what do you think that was that knew your life was it jesus christ are you willing to accept that amen then you know that something supernatural then has accompanied this message amen if you believe that the lord be the lord jesus as he he says as i preached out of the word you believe it to be the lord jesus how many believes that amen look now it was the word the logos who discerns the thoughts and the intents of the heart the same thing that would happen as elohim would stand before sarah and sarah's in the in the tent behind him and he would tell him to say where you sarah thy wife and he would call her by the name that had been named by given by the angel of the lord and then here he would stand there and and now tell that she would have a son and then discern her heart and let her know you know that i know what you're thinking i discerned the thoughts in an intense heart she was she laughed within herself saying me an old woman gonna have a child you know and and and so on and this would be the same thing that would happen when it became flesh in jesus christ is that right he would call um he would call and speak to to peter and tell him his name and he would also speak out to nathanael and tell him he was an israelite in whom where there was no guile and and he said when philip called you under the tree i saw you is that right and this made that man that that hebrew say thou art the king of israel thou art god because he recognized only god could know the thoughts and intents of the heart is that right amen so you know when we're looking at this we're not talking about somebody out in the audience has got a backache we're not talking about some generalized something or or hit and miss we're not talking about a one-time event this would happen thousands of times service active service showing us over and over again that jesus christ is alive and that he's present and that he's accept a message come on church he's sending a message for an end-time people and it would be right down specific down to the to to the nitty-gritty there's a dark spirit of death hanging around you now you know that's one number two in the form of a cancer on the breast you know they're there again that's actually three you know because it tells on the breast and then it tells it's a cancer and then then again the description of the doctor you were examined by someone strong you have a rupture in the bowels also and you're out stomach trouble as well and then you have a severe heart trouble that causes you fainting and then it goes back into her life and he says i saw you i see you sitting on the side the bed and you fell over sideways and you but you were you nearly passed out you were looking toward the window and then it carries it right on your name is eva york you live in this city which is washington dc yeah and then gave that the street number 613 6th street and then told her you're going home to be well i'll tell you that was not humanly possible the biggest charlatan in the world could not guess that many times and be acting are you with me amen then not only that but go out into the audience and pick him out and say you've got a rupture there don't you sir you're just praying let him call me a man the next one comes up you're from richmond uh you're it's a capital you're from a capital also it's richmond virginia you have a cancer it's inside your mouth on the jaw then the last example and that wasn't all of them but then there's another 10 right there you have headaches they have been 25 years ago they started you've been a great believer you prayed for this hour and you said in your prayer isn't it comforting that god knows your prayer that none of your prayers are going down to the ground amen you think they're unheard god's letting you know i i'm with you but i'm also hearing you i see the oppression i see what the enemy's done to you 25 years you've suffered but but you know you've been a believer it ain't because you hadn't been a believer many are the afflictions of the righteous but i've come down for deliverance it's an hour a time of deliverance i mean you might have been like congressman up your 66 years in a wheelchair but now you're an old man but it's time for your delivery amen this is an hour this is a time of deliverance you might have waited a long time you might have fasted you might have prayed you might have been a great believer you might have been holding on a long time i say he knows i know your sorrow i've seen what the egyptians have done but i have come down to deliver there's a young woman standing near you she's your daughter how would you know that she's from richmond indiana her name her husband is a minister you were fixing to go on a trip she wrote you a letter then he tells you the contents of the letter amen don't come that brother branham's coming to here to washington dc stay here amen are you listening amen now that's that's over ten things one right after another that the angel is revealing amen never miss never got it wrong never a guess always the holy spirit amen it's that logos and being it's the word it can't be inaccurate being it's god it can't fail i i'm just going to tell you you got a problem with this message you've got a problem with the angel [Applause] because it was the angel that gave this message you want to talk you think you're talking about william branham let me tell you something you're talking against the angel and i want to just declare to you the angel is still here i want to tell you again it's the lord jesus christ and he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you amen come on that's it that's his promise thou be the same yesterday today and forever i'll be the present god right there wherever you need it i'm there for you amen i know your heart i know what you've been praying i know the thoughts i know the intent i know what you've been desired and i'm here to fulfill that desire and bring you into deliverance [Applause] as i said i sat there i must have been 15 16 years old when i first saw that film the first time i remember the impact again i relived those moments oh but if we could only be like the little two-year-old girl of a pastor friend of mine they were watching the first release of the deep color to the deep the little baby had a ruptured navel i i don't know how big it was but it looked like it was at least an inch and a half sticking out it was big and she was about two years old and her mother many times would sit and hold that navel in while she held a child in her lap and and just to say say it lightly it was ugly it was unsightly but they watched that film and after church that night when the family went into their home the mother was carrying the child and she had a you know two years old a very limited vocabulary and she was hardly talking or barely talking and she as they passed by the hoffman's head of christ the picture that was in their home and she she pointed up to the hoffman's head of christ's picture and she says look look that man and and and then she picked up her dress exposing her her her navel and said she and her navel was completely healed [Music] amen now who did that child see something that looks similar to that huffman's head oh christ right there she saw some look that man and pulls up her dress and and shows her belly and shows her navel is completely well [Music] amen i want to tell you the angel of the lord continues to watch over that message that was five years after the prophet had left and he was showing he was still here and he still cares and just like he healed ruptures and on that film he was healing raptured right there in that meeting and then a little child who saw him received a touch from the almighty [Applause] hallelujah what was god doing again showing us i haven't left this pride i haven't left my people i might have called my my servant my messenger home but i'm still here and i'm still the healer and i'm still the deliverer and i'm still the savior i'll say that none of this word none of this message will fall to the ground just the other day we saw it worked out he said i saw her in high color hot royal color and we saw it happen the other day right in front of our faces not yellow not green not pink not blue royal purple was god showing us not one word is gonna fall to the ground i'm a god of details if god does that how much more confidence can we be in knowing he's going to have rapture in his last days now he said this angel of god sent from jesus christ to testify to the church that the last days are here it doesn't heal anybody it just brings your faith up to that place see healing was down at calvary amount it was done at calvary yes he still heals but his own what he did at calvary again he said this message would go around the world and it would start a revival that'll sweep around the world and it'll be just before the coming of christ the second time and i just say it started a revival and i want to say i am that revival [Applause] hallelujah i'm preaching now 51 years and i ain't burned down yet and i'm not going to burn down amen i cannot burn down and i'm sorry knock down starting one in me it gave me a passion gave me a desire it gave me a word now the purpose of the coming angel was to make god personal to us to make us aware of a supernatural gospel and the message of the end time you see it's make us aware of the message of the end time because its mysteries can only be revealed by god through a prophet so that we can declare that bible days are here again understand the same angel that stood before abraham is here brother branham would say i just watched for his sign how many knows jesus today is a bill of fire that followed the children of israel i came from god i'd go to god this is his words we'll get in the scripture in a few minutes i came from god i go to god amen is that what he said when paul met him on the road to damascus what was he he was the great light the pillar of fire he is the same one today this ho the holy spirit of god the body of jesus sits at the right hand of god on his throne in heaven but his spirit is here on the earth completing and finishing his work and that same spirit that lived in the body of jesus was the same spirit that was in that angel that come to sodom and gomorrah do you believe that the same one that followed the children of israel the same god amen my you're you're people who can say more than any other people you're following the god of moses you're following the god of abraham you're following the god of jacob he would demonstrate his power to heal the sick to cast out devils showing the same attitude that he had to heal the sick because he couldn't if he can't heal the sick how can he change the body and i hear brother branham say may the angel that has sent forth thy servant stand by me tonight meet these diseases till every demon spirit will scream may the power be predominant for driving out every every sick person that is in this building out of these afflicted people who sit in here in these chairs bound shaken stroke paralyzed palsy whatever it is cancer ridden is there anything too hard for the lord amen this is a god who specializes in things not impossible and i say don't give up on your promise i don't care how afflicted your children are i don't care how afflicted this situation is how evil it is and what the enemy has done and how you have been beaten don't give up on the promise he is here to fulfill that promise let me encourage you to prepare yourself for the angel's visitation because he's looking for faith he's looking for somebody that believed him amen he's looking to see that you signed crime for the abominations the sin makes you sick and he's marking an elect for rapture he's looking for sincerity and a love for truth and a passion for it brother branham talks about this and the unchangeable word of god he said these wars you take young kids out just the cream of the crop they don't know no better knowing discipline army discipline stick your head up over the hill and let someone shoot it off die like a hero they gladly do it run up there on one shot down on another and shot down another shot down and the nation forgets them unless they're family come back to this here and whatever they come back to you see many of the soldiers now see he's talking about men and and and people that are in the nation's army and they just blindly followed the discipline but he said a man seldom will you ever find one that'll lay down his life for the cause of christ he won't even crawl out of his shade tree to go to church he won't get out from behind television long enough to attend wednesday night prayer meeting hey man it's a shame disgrace that's the reason angels don't visit the churches that's the reason angels don't visit homes we got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing the angels of god are here on earth tonight just the same as they've always been the holy ghost have been here ever since the resurrection of jesus christ and are coming forth of pentecost he's appeared down to all the ages getting the remnant of people together the rest of it is cannon fodder and i'll just tell you now it's a fodder that'll mix with smoke out of the torment yes sir it'll take a born-again experience washed in the blood of the lamb sanctified filled with the holy ghost or they'll never make that rapture are you with me amen but i tell you what let's be a people who gets ready amount for the appearing of the angel what we can say like paul did he appeared to me also he appeared to peter he appeared to james he appeared to john he appeared to mary he appeared to this and then that one but he's appeared to be awesome [Applause] now most time in brother bradley's meetings i i would say he didn't always see the man he saw the light the pillar of fire and he says the presence of the supernatural which is the lord jesus christ his angel stands near you see is the angel of his presence where he comes and his presence is manifested and now he said his angel stands near that that's the pillar of fire but now when i see the man it isn't the lord jesus it's a great big talmud great tall man way bigger than what christ i seen in the vision christ was a very small person but this is a big man and a smooth face now notice there's a difference between the pillar of fire and that's that angel that olive complexion angel that he saw step out of that fire but that pillar of fire he said is none other than the lord jesus christ i want you to understand who we have been visited by who it is that is among us this elohim that stayed with abraham that provided an anointing that we are anointed by now so he so as he said christ is here the holy spirit the angel of god i'm merely just a mouthpiece for him and moses is just a mouthpiece for me jesus was a mouthpiece for god and he died to redeem us sinner that the program of god might be carried on down to the age through the church and ministers that are consecrated to god become channels where god can speak through preach the gospel heal the sick and show signs and wonders hallelujah so there again god has a voice even in the pulpit that is anointed by the angel to bring a word hallelujah that god can speak through that channel and preach the gospel and kill the sick and show signs and wonders i know because i better know anybody that angel hallelujah but not only am i anointed by that angel but you also have been undone by that angel hallelujah amen for christ is here among his church he would say with reverend's sincere heart i believe that's the same angel of god that led to israel out of egypt on the promised land to the promised land and the natural is leading to us us today to the promised land in the spiritual for in my father's house are many mansions and i'll go and prepare a place for you and i believe the angel lord is leading the church today did anybody hear that do you believe what the prophet believed i believe the angel of the lord is leading the church today and it's the same holy spirit and anyone knows the angel of the covenant was christ it is now and it's not just to me friend i might be counted in with you but that angel doesn't that angel just doesn't to me it's to all of you and he's here right now he's in the building i felt it right now and i know that the angel the same angel that i'm speaking of here isn't five feet from me now i'll meet you at the judgment bar until this night is called to order see if i haven't told you the truth he is right in here now you said brother tim that's wonderful that's the way it was when brother branham was here but he said now remember this when i'm gone jesus will still be here when i'm not at your church christ will still be there just to say how many believes that word this morning amen oh my the angels are sent forth from his presence ministered spirits sent forth from the presence of god do you understand brother god never takes his spirit from the earth he takes his mind but never his spirit god taken elijah but the spirit of elijah came on elisha and then several hundred years later it came on the john the baptist the same spirit made him act the same way and then we prophesied it's here again in the last days god takes his man but his spirit remains he taken his son but his spirit stayed on earth the holy spirit he sent it back to earth to live among mankind so the age of the lord the pillar of fire is still here sometimes you know it can be seen visible sometimes it can be manifested in the form of a man but he's still here and when my brother branham left here elohim did not leave [Applause] that anointing still anoints a bride even till today come on listen what happened what changed when roberts left no nothing really changed you see preachers were under the same under that anointing continued fleecing the people with promises of prosperity and exchange for enriching them come on under that anointing they still continue to preach faith without no change in life amen what changed with graham's departure that anointing continues amen through ministers preaching easy believism and persuading people they're saved while still living a life of sin you see oral roberts and billy graham was not the angel they were anointed by the angels and so are we anointed by elohim that anointing that you've seen there that knows the thoughts and endings of heart is still anointing a people in this last day you are under an anointing now it wasn't just paul the church age messenger that saw angels you think it's limited just to the messengers you know brother ron was spencer and i was in a meeting up with brother jason jackson's god did some phenomenal things one was a man who had cancer throughout his body and he went to his church and he said listen the bible said anoint with oil and pray the prayer of faith and god will raise him up was will you pray for the sick no we don't do that here man dying with cancer and he appears at one of the brothers body shops up there that he restores automobiles that have been wrecked and and he he comes there and he said you know i'm dying with with cancer the doctor has given me a i'm four stage cancer and said uh they you know they can't help me and i went to my pastor and said well you prayed for me and said no we don't do that here and he said well come to my church we do that brother ron and i was preaching the meeting that night there was a little prayer line that's that that started on the side of the building or way on the side as as he as he called him out and and he prayed with him and there the holy spirit just came down in a miraculous way and the report is that it's come back to us as the man is totally free from cancer [Music] but because mother ron had seen some visions it was a sister came up and she said um you know only brother branham could see visions you you can't see visions that ain't right can you imagine the unbelief that has now come back among children of the message i wonder if their children are not grandchildren are you is somebody with me but let me tell you it wasn't just paul the messenger that that saw angels zechariah mary joseph in a dream am i marrying marta at the two i mean there was peter paul and there was peter there in prison locked between a quadrant of soldiers are you with me i'm bound to soldiers and in the middle of the night a light shines in the room and an angel steps out of that light and smites him on the side says get up from there hey man you don't have to be bound anymore get up shake those chains and come follow me out of this prison i tell you that same angel is here today to do everyone that is there in prison whether it is sin prison where is sickness prison i don't care how long you have been bound the angel of god's minding you on the side and saying get it from there shake off those chains and then it's the hour of freedom it's the hour of deliverance hallelujah paul there on a ship the angel of god appeared to him said don't take that don't take that trip they wouldn't listen paul's taken out of the circumstances he can't control and he's there and now rough waters come but the angel hadn't forgot he had said come on somebody you're going to preach the gospel in rome you're going to make it doesn't matter what it is you're going to make it god said that about a bride going in a rapture somebody help me preach amen there's somebody going to make it amen stay with the ship stay with the gospel don't get off the boat said okay brethren the angels of the lord the angel of the lord appeared to me and said we are there's not going to be one of us lost i'm with you some of them made like you know was going to try to get get away and they put out some lifeboats and we're going and he said if you don't stay with the ship you're going to be lost i'm going to save you don't stay with this message it's the message of the angel you're going to be lost i don't care what the storms are amen but there there you you know there he was cast onto an island and there again he gets out and he gathers up and looks trying to find a little wood there to warm himself and build a little fire and a viper bites him but does he panic does he go into hysterical mood come on what's he do he just shakes it off in the fire said the lord said i would preach it wrong and then this serpent ain't going to kill me amen i'm telling you the death of the serpent is right here there's a people who are going in a rapture they'll seek all of the devil in the fire every kindred's in the fire but they're going to make it through hallelujah [Applause] because there have a message attended by an angel i'm not going to get into some things that i intended to this morning time won't allow me so let me just go this direction for a moment it was moses he met the angel in a pillar of fire say well he was in a bush he was in a fire in the bush moses had all this instructions all his life of how he was to deliver israel your proper child and mom and dad prayed this prayer and we we had this feeling about you and we saw you our proper child and and and you you know no doubt the angels of god had watched over you when we put you in the nile no doubt it happened when when that little tar like uh basket there there were that you were a lady and was floating down the the the river oh and marry him watching it and seeing it coming to a whirlpool but there must have been an angel sitting on top of your basket because he just guided it right out of the whirlpool and man another come up and you're going to see the crocodiles coming up and smelling for this little this little boy this little hebrew child you could just about smell him in there the the the the alligator the crocodile could almost but all of a sudden it backs away that's if an angel had smoked him on the nose and said get back boy this is mine not yours i have been commissioned to watch over him you know the devil would have tried to destroy you he would have destroyed you if he could he pulled you down into every kind of sin and every kind of darkness that there is in the world but he ain't got enough did you see did you hear what i said he ain't got enough this god has guided you and let you have brought you right down to this very age this very time this very moment he looked over your birth he saw your parents he knew who you were he ordained you to be here right here in this hour and he's watched over you because god watches over his word to see that not one word will fall to the ground [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah this is a god who's seeing the plan right down to the end and after he's 80 years old he still hasn't forgot and he didn't say you ran so i can't choose you you you messed up and so i can't choose you he said but i'm going to chew i chose you and i can't change my mind about you i said you would be there and there ain't enough devils in hell going to stop it you ain't got enough to stop it no no [Applause] would prevail against the gates of hell so the gates of hell be against you can't stop this pride she's the unstoppable bride of jesus christ why because she's attended by an angel moses would walk out of the presence of that pillar of fire with a rod in his hand and go take over the biggest nation in the world [Applause] amen with a whole army with millions with one of the richest nations in the world and bring them to their knees hallelujah this man this little weak man this man who said i can't even talk he made all kinds of excuses but in the presence of that angel his life changed forever and here he walks out into the presence of that mighty angel is somebody with me he was under the presence of a mighty angel under that anointing [Applause] and under that anointing he would strike the river turn it into blood under that anointing he would plague the devil until the devil was begging them to lead amen or you can go you can go i'll let you go so far but moses said i don't believe in so far religion amen we're going to go all the way we're going to ever promise [Applause] amen why he was under the influence of an angel you say brother tim that's fine that was moses that was thousands of years ago what about us revelation 10 1 hallelujah what did he say and he said what and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven and he's clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was on his head and his face were as it was a sun and his feet is pillars of fire and i'm telling you we're under the anointing of that angel [Music] watch out devil there's a bride rising up look out satan you tried to stop it everybody but you can't stop it man we tried to quit but we can't quit there ain't no queen in us we met an angel and we're under the influence of that mighty angel hallelujah oh he said well just leave your kids leave them behind leave you the women and the children behind no no no no you didn't understand we are all going our children are going our spouses are going i love what you're calling we're not leaving behind why we're under the anointing of the 98 though i say what a message what a message it sets us apart from every denomination it's a message given by an angel not some gold plates with some in funky uh you know interpretation of these these plates but the very word of god is vindicated and made manifest [Music] [Applause] you want to know how to conduct yourself ask the angel if you want to know how what the way is ask the angel you women won't know how to wear your hair ask the angel you wanna how i know how to dress in this age of sodom ask the angel he agrees with this bible from genesis to revelation amen let the musicians come hallelujah you're under the influence you're under the influence you're under the influence you're intoxicated you've been charged you've been sent you've been elected you've been called you've been placed [Music] and the pillar of fire would become flesh and dwelt among us and because he would come forth from the father he would be called the son and as the son of god he would manifest himself on earth and he would come looking for his own now he said i came to my own come to the church but they received me not but somebody's going to receive me for as many as receive me they have the authority to become the sons of god and they're not born of the will of man or the will of the flesh but of god because they're offsprings of this pillar of fire the bible said in him was life and this life was the light of men the aramaic said in him was lives plural because you were in him that's why when you were born again a portion of that same logos the pillar of fire came into your life [Music] making you a son or daughter of the logos no wonder you believe the word because you are that word [Music] brother tim why don't you just deny the message i am the message i can't deny it because he can't deny himself [Music] and since he can't deny himself he can't deny you and when i take a rapture into satan's eden and i lift my spirit because you're born of it you're lifted with me and we're not leaving one behind we're going into the promised land look for his appearing look for him to appear to you don't get so busy with everything else that you can't see him in his appearing he's here to bring you home you'll no longer roam lost out there in the darkness he prepared a place for you he's got a theophany just like that angel walked out of that light one day your theophany's gonna walk out that light and you'll see yourself face to face the real you god's image of you in one moment's time he'll perfect everything in this body everything that don't match the image that god had of you before the world began it'll match and you'll change from mortal to immortality he's bringing the people back home you're the people of the book the people of the promise if you're lost in your wayward and you're away from him he's here to bring you back home you never had nothing but trouble till you come look the woman at the well the devil thought he had done everything he could you know i wonder if he didn't suspect his whole time could this really be a seed of god could she really so you know what he covered her over with every kind of sin she had five husbands now she's living with one it's not her husband she's got religious sins he got all confused about who god is more to worship and how to worship who was that woman you were that woman and he came looking for you come on now amen and the seventh the seventh man found you we're not talking about brother branham now we're talking about the angel that was bringing a message he found you he came looking for you and nothing the devil had ever done to you was too hard for him to wipe away in one moment's time in the presence of the angel of the covenant may flesh in jesus christ it was all gone all the past that's how he works so what must i do take a move toward god you move toward god he'll move towards you i'll bring you back home i will bring you back home bring you back home on my children yesterday this is for you you will no [Music] sinner this is for
