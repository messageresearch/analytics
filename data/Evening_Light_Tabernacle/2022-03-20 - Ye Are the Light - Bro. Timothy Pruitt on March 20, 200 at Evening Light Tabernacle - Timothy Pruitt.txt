we love you and we ask that you would just come and you would speak lord and you would touch and you would minister we thank you for these things in jesus name amen amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen uh we just want to say we thank you and appreciate you for understanding it's been a while since we've had to shut down the mezzanine uh but we've got so many out this morning and uh meetings and we understand there's a wonderful presence of god that's been moving and touching lives and we're thankful for that amen brother tim there in phoenix and brother ron peterson's and and lord's been just really moving there and then that youth meeting there in pawnee oklahoma we sure appreciate brother wendell and his burden for the young people and amen and have it's not easy to do something like that and as we know we're we're coming you know i was talking to brother tim today as we're trying to make adjustments and things we're having to do for our youth camp it almost seems like we're starting all over again because it's been several years since we've been able to have it but amen so bear with us in that that it's going to take a little bit to get the axles greased up again and the motor all changed out and all that good stuff and and so uh but we're looking for a wonderful time in the lord lord willing brother ron brother andrew spencer will be there and brother by the donny reagan as well so looking for a good time you can turn your bibles to matthew chapter 5. i also want to say we had a wonderful day yesterday we've we've had this week to work through all the mud and and the rain that hit us on monday and tuesday and and uh we had three men that showed up from pennsylvania right now they're backslid amish maybe one day they'll be saved amish amen but they showed up and they put this building together and it's a very lovely place and and in the coming weeks we'll be getting the rest of the concrete done and dressing up and hopefully be able to dedicate it pretty soon and so we appreciate the brothers that was able to come yesterday and clean up around here and help us with all the mud and things and the dirt dauber nests and the bird nests and things that was on the building though ugly stains that brother but aaron was speaking about you know life as it tries to take back over and and so uh we was able to get a lot done yesterday and we appreciate every effort and everyone that was able to come amen matthew chapter 5 and verse 14 it says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house so let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen we let you be seated today i've been on this subject or thought of light and i'd like to continue on it this morning on ye are the light ye are the light you know we we're witnessing each passing generation and really as we get further along in this it seems like every passing day is progressively getting darker you know with each generation it seems to be 10 times worse than it was the previous generation as we see sin begin to very rapidly as it were a snowball as it gathers amen as it rolls down a hill it goes faster and faster but it also gathers more and more and we can see that sin is more than it's ever been it's we see the the realms of sodom and gomorrah as it's coming into this very openly and very expressed uh to work you know we got a man that wants to act like a woman amen swimming against women and and acting like he's done something uh you know and you just see even more and more senseless murders and and things that are taking place men and and people of in this age getting more and more violent and why has all this happen is because they refuse to turn to the light and you when you refuse to turn to light you go into outer darkness and then we see this nation has gotten dark very rapidly amen since rejecting the light of the word and and you know brother branham would talk about it in shalom you know he says those who will not turn to light there's only one thing that will happen you're going to go darker and darker as the years go on now this is in 64. so here we are um almost uh 60 years later and we can definitely say day by day it has gotten darker and darker year by year has gotten darker and darker he said but to those who will turn to the light you will get brighter and brighter amen and it's very it's a it's very obvious what takes place because the darker it is the brighter light shines and so and but not just that but the light will begin to grow and grow and become brighter and brighter until that perfect day that we're looking for amen his appearing where all darkness will fade away now i don't know about you but i'm looking forward to that day that there'll be no more darkness there'll be no more sin there and you can go into all kinds of things of in that nature there'll be no more worries no more fears no more sickness no more sorrow no more partying no more darkness at all fade away and he said that's the reason i can say even right now as i'm looking brother brandon was looking at the oncoming darkness that it would begin to be it would look so dark to him that even he is a prophet would say i just don't see how it can last past 1977 because he couldn't see past the darkness that was there and and here we are now uh uh what is that 30 years almost 30 years past that or 40 years past that 77 amen it's and here we are living in the time the past what he could even see as a prophet amen so it's very dark and but he said looking at the darkness looking at that he said i can that's why i can say to the church of the living god shalom because we are his lights and jesus said ye are the light of the world now there was a message there was a shout there was a calling out of darkness amen not just to stand in the light but to become the light amen to become connected to the source as we spoke about the last time on the source of life amen this is where you would see we can read many scriptures about this in ephesians chapter 5 and verse 8 amen he says ye are worth sometimes darkness but now ye our light in the lord walk as children of light so we were one at a time in a dark place many of us could look back and we could say yes i was in a dark place i lived in a dark place i come from a dark place but thank god i'm no longer in that dark place but light has dawned upon me in my life and now i'm walking not as a child of darkness but as a child of light and the light of god is growing and moving in my life colossians 1 and verse 12 says giving thanks unto the father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who has delivered us from the power of darkness amen has translated us unto the kingdom of his dear son so amen we were in darkness and we were living in darkness but he delivered us from the power that held us in darkness and not only delivers from the power that held us in darkness he put a power in us amen to give us light amen to in a dark world and so we can also see in first peter 2 and verse 9 he says ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous life which in times past you were not a people but are now the people of god in times in other words in times past you were not the people of god amen i called people but now you are the people of god which had once not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy amen it's a wonderful thing to know amen we're a people that has obtained mercy that in a time that that people are rejecting mercy they're turning away truth they're turning away light and they're moving on towards darkness there's a people that has obtained mercy they've accepted the mercy of almighty god and they're not moving towards darkness but they're moving towards life they're not moving towards hell but they're moving towards eternal life amen there's a people here that's not going to go down in the darkness of laodicea and it's going to get so dark i mean one day the light last light is going to go out and it's going to be complete utter darkness but there's a people there's the lights being gathered and they're being moved from this realm to another place amen we can see here amen we know there's seven dimensions we're living in this middle portion brother brandon will describe it there's three above us and there's three beneath us and he said in this he said i want to give you a little picture there's a stream of life that we're living in it's a dark stream he talks about it being very dark he said but in this little channel there dwells mortal beings and he said and there's a lot of darkness there's a mass of folly and a mass he called it would call it deity and devils and blackness and strengths but every once in a while you'll see a light every once in a while you see a light he said but see all of that darkness and all that streaks and gaity and carrying on devil's getting people he said oh they might dress fine they might be highly cultured as they can be polished scholars but still the devil he said but there in that darkness this little born-again believer sitting in there there's little lights here and there he would say he said you know another place he'd say jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever don't let anybody ever tell you anything else he raised from the dead he lives tonight supremely and wherever two or three are gathered together i'll be in their midst amen we ought to say praise the lord this morning amen i'll be in their midst no matter how small the church is i'll be there he can't lie he will not lie he never lied before and he never will lie he said but on this street that we're living in where mortals live mortals are influenced from an outside world he said i would should understand by the grace of god he said i deal with spirits he said i know what i'm speaking of he said when we look through this dark mass of gaiety amen a folly of partying and you know but darkness every once in a while you'll see a little light burning hallelujah amen you'll see a little light burning amen just like the it's on your table lights today like lights on your table lights burning he said that's christians and darkness giving light hallelujah and it can get as dark as it wants to but it'll never put out the light the only time this light is going to go out is when this light is moved from this mass of darkness into eternal light [Applause] hallelujah amen so every devil in hell can gather its forces it can gather everything it wants they can gather all the sin it wants together he can gather all the doubt it wants together he can gather all the fear he wants together it'll never put out that little light that's shining yonder and shining the under and shouting yonder it can blow against it he can howl against it he can push against it but it'll never put out the light the only way this light is going out is getting taken out by the presence of almighty god and he would say up above us is the holy spirit amen there's the realms of holy spirit there's the rams of the angels and then there's god himself and he said below amen there's devils and and and there's there's a place where jesus went and ministered to the souls that were lost in prison he said then there's devils and then there's hell so there's three above us and there's three above us he would call it the trinity of heaven and the trinity of hell he said so the darkness is being influenced from somewhere there's a connection that has taken place in this realm of life that we're living in that darkness that's here is being connected being connected from somewhere he said when the debt when the spirits of evil are showed out upon people they're being influenced from somewhere there is a connection that is there give me a little bit more there is a connection that is there amen that they're they're they're pulling from this something it's feeding that desire something is pushing that desire something is pushing listen people are not becoming what they're becoming because they want to become what they want to become people are becoming what they're becoming because there's an influence that is influencing their lives there's a connection that has taken place and they're being drawn they're drawing from a source amen homosexuals are drawing from afar as far from a source they're they're not you know they say well i just want to be what i want to be they're being what demons want them to be [Applause] amen you know nobody can be what they want to be you're influenced from one way or another you're connected from one place or another amen you know people you got this idea well i'm going to be what i want to be no you'll never be what you want to be amen he said there's darkness he said a sinner influenced by a spirit because he has a spirit but at the wrong influence there's a wrong influence the wrong that gives influence and a right that gives influence and those who are dominated with blackness and separation and things of that nature are dominated from the underworld of devils but the first thing you know he said you're going another place a whole conglomeration of blackness and darkness but there's these little lights flashing off and burning he said that's a christian born again light you are a light that's set on a hill do you notice where he puts you on a hill he wants the whole world to see you amen a candle that's set in a room that gives light to all the room that's what a christian is among darkness you're supposed you're supposed to shine when it's dark if you're not shining and people don't know a difference that means you ain't got much light if you're fitting in with the world and they don't think they don't notice that you're a christian and they don't they don't notice anything different about you that means you don't have much light you're blending in with what's around you you're becoming what's around you and pretty soon you won't be able to tell is that this one or who is that what is that i see nothing but darkness but when there's a light burning on the inside of you it don't take much to realize there's something different about you amen they're not like all these other people amen i want i believe that even the light tabernacle ought to be a church that there's something different about that church they ain't like all the other churches they don't they don't do like they don't worship like all the other churches amen there's something about them that's different what is it there is an influence same as there's a spirit from the underworld that's influencing people and you see it on their bodies you see it on their actions you see it in their thoughts you see it in murders and rapes and every kind of thing they're being influenced from another world but so is this light this light is also connected to another world and it's pushing the energy or the life down into that light why don't i act like that i can't help it because i'm connected to a source i'm connected to a body hallelujah the wicked or the unbeliever is influenced from beneath from hell there's evil powers it goes again to about about the trinity of hell and all the things that are there and then it goes into the influence of the upper world amen he said the christians are also influenced by spirit too the holy spirit so there must be a connection that takes place to have this light there has to be a connection to a source or you'll never have light as we've been talking about it these light bulbs are worthless if they're not connected to a source that helps produce the light i mean they're nothing but something a piece of plastic or a little piece of whatever that makes it up amen it's lifeless it has no no no heating ability it has nothing unless it's connected to a source a source of strength a and brother brandon would talk about being the candle in the lighting of the candle and he says you cannot receive the baptism of the holy ghost without having experience when it happens he said well you say well i believe every respect of the word well then the word is laying there waiting for the holy spirit to light it or to make it work but it takes the lighting of the candle here's the candle with the wick in it and with all the tallow everything around it and the wick looking just as pretty but until the fire comes upon it it'll never shine no matter how perfect the candle is no matter how pretty the candle is or how beautiful the candle is it's got to be lit to burn i mean that's that's pretty simple but when you believe and you're made up of the instructions of what the holy spirit is and things love joy peace lord suffering the fruits of the spirit it'll bear out but until that holy spirit with a fiery experience comes down and lights that candle then you hadn't received the holy ghost well i believe the word well have you had the experience coming down and lighting your candle you didn't go out there on that building out there we just put up it's a beautiful building looks lovely i mean everything looks so pretty and everything and there's wires hanging down from it you can grab them wires right now and you can touch them to your tone if you trust me they've never been connected up to the source yet they look like wires they act like wires in the sense of of having the copper and the coating and the white and the black and the neutral and the ground and the hot wire and the yellow covering and they got it all but there's no life inside of it but there's going to come a day that if you walk up there and put it to your tongue you're going to feel something there's going to be something that takes place or you can put it to your hands wherever there's going to be a life inside that wow amen and it'll do something it'll it'll illuminate a fan it'll illuminate amen a light it'll it'll bring something to life but until it's connected to the sword it's nothing but dead works we work to put it up we work to put it there and we've done this and we've done that but until it's connected to a source it'll never turn a fan it'll never make a light burn it'll never make nothing work and that's the same thing with the word of god you can put it all there you can put it all together you can have it down pat you can quote it backwards upwards upside down every kind of way but until you are connected to the source it'll never work but when it's connected to the source it'll work every time it'll heal the sin it'll save the laws it'll turn the backslider back to repentance it'll destroy the works of the devil it'll can't say to now [Applause] has to be a connection a match it has to touch the wick you can light the match you can have a match burning but it will never make that candle burn until you touch it has to be a touch a connection made amen we can see in acts chapter 2 and verse 1. so when the day of pentecost was fully calm they were with all one accord all one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire see the lord wanted more than to just lead you by fire i mean he has a pillow fire it's still here amen is still witnesses it's still being witnessed but he didn't want the pi the fire on the outside of it he wanted to put it on the inside of you amen that same tongue that same pillar of fire and it set upon each of them so there was a connection that was made amen and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and we have the same opportunity to be connected to the same source amen well well let me read it to you padma's vision how threatening it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resource of that main bowl because they had their whip with their wicks dipped into it each church aged messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the holy ghost his wick his life has been immersed in christ though that wick he is through that wick is drawing the very life of christ and that life is giving light to the church what kind of light is he given the very same light that lit the first lamp and right on down to every age and the last day messenger the same life the same light is manifested by life as hid with christ and god you say well that's wonderful every messenger hallelujah not only do we speak thus of the messengers but every true believer is dramatically depicted here too they are all drawing from the same source well i wish i was back in this i wish i was back in the days of paul i wish i was back in the days of one of the messengers i wish i was 60 years ago and i could have that you can have the same source we have the ability to dip our lives in the same source and when the first life was dipped into this source and those 120 begin to fill that surge of power how many has ever hurt felt the surge of just electrical power how many has ever been shot well it looks like almost 100 percent of us if you hadn't you ought to try it it'll light your life squeal holler scream carry on like a madman thing about that you're trying to get loose from it amen because they say it don't it don't exactly feel good but i guarantee you you know there's some there's some life there and i guarantee you haven't experienced you've had that experience you don't ever have to question it again you don't have to have to look at it and say well was it there well did it really happen no i know it was happy it happened i was there when it happened i felt the church through my body i felt it illuminate me i was there and you wonder why we get a little emotional you wonder why we scream and shout we get to run it around you grab a hold of this wire one time for yourself then you'll know why [Applause] you grab it for yourself and then you'll understand why somebody gets so overwhelmed they can't hold it no more and they begin to shout the praises of almighty god why it ain't some 120 vote they got to hold up they got a hold of the throne of almighty god and the source of life is pulsating their body you grab a hold of it and then you'll know why we shout you'll know why we run you'll know why there's something on well i just ain't emotional great let's find out how many says that all right ain't nobody gonna raise their hand right now if i get somebody to raise your hand that says i ain't emotional okay let's grab something some metal let's stick it in one of them plugs right over there let's see if you if you're not emotional that means you're dead you know where you belong in a morgue maybe in a seven six foot grave pushing up daisies because apparently you're dead or apparently there's something wrong with your body that has no receptors amen you know there's actually people there's actually i was talking about this yesterday there's actually a um a disease that goes that actually can attack your body to where you can't feel electricity why don't the devil know how to do stuff you can't feel it you can't it doesn't do anything there's been people that they hooked them up to prods and things and they just sit there and act like ain't nothing happening and if you got hooked up to it you'd be shouting you'd be carrying on because there's a receptor inside of you said hey there's something happening there that ain't supposed to happen now we're talking about physically amen but what's also in the physical realm is also in the spiritual realm there's also a spiritual disease apparently that gets on people's souls and lives until the presence of god can fall and their receptors are so tore up by that spirit that they cannot react because they don't know what's even happening hey man i heard a story of a man that they could stand there and i don't know if you've ever tried it it hurts i mean how many mechanics are people that wants to be a mechanic or thought about being a mechanic let's change your mind grab a hold of a spark plug spark plug wire and pull it off of there and just see if let me see if there's a little spark pull that engine and you got a hold of that metal on the end handle that dude it'll light you up it'll make you jump it'll make you shout it'll make you scream might run around that mower or whatever you're working on it cause what man it hurt but i've heard a man that was able to hold a car running and pull a spark plug off and hold it to their hand and not even feel it and another person walk up and say how you doing he reached over there and touched him on the nose and a blue flame leave his finger and hit him right on the nose and he felt it jumped back and screamed and said what do you think you're doing his receptors wasn't messed up come on somebody amen i don't want about say god electrify my life whatever's gotta be if you got to go in there and you got to change the whole makeup of me whatever you got to do i want to know when the presence of god is falling i want to know when the power of god is moving in his people i want to be able to respond to it every true believer is dramatically depicted here they are all drawing from the same source because they all have to be dipped in the same bowl and they're dead to themselves and their lives are hidden christ and god they're sealed in by the holy ghost ephesians 4 grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby whereby you're sealed into the day of redemption now no man can pluck them out of his hand their lives cannot be tampered with take that devil no man can pluck them out of his hand their lives cannot be tampered with the visible life is burning and shining and giving life and manifestations of the holy ghost and the inner invisible life is hidden in guard and fed by the lord's word satan cannot touch them oh praise the lord satan cannot touch them not even death can touch them for death has lost his stay and the grave has lost his victory thanks be to god we have the victory in christ jesus our lord but there has to be a connection there has to be a source there has to be something to draw from every person in this line of life if we get i'm trying to get the picture as a line and it's a the river of life every person in that body or in that body of water we could say it like that it's connected to something every person look at your neighbor and say every person everyone everyone 7 billion right now upon the earth is connected to a source that's right up above us is heaven and heavenly things all the way up to god down below is darkness it's regions of the lost demons and hell and everyone in this life is connected to one or the other and your eternal destination rests on where you're connected to now there is proof in this life already and now in this church that there were some here sitting there many of us all of us because we was all born in sin shape let me get that right all of us were born shaped born and sin shaped and iniquity so we came into this life channel connected from below but there was a power that broke the connection and once that broke that connection is broke i want you to understand something it don't ever have to be connected again now it can be connected again and it has been connected again but it don't have to be connected again but there's another power that wants to connect to you and to push life into your body life into your soul life into your thoughts life into your work life into your everyday life i mean light pushing out john chapter 15 and verse 5 says i am the vine ye are the branches now let me look this is very this is all very simple this morning but we read that we just skim over it as far as i know in my limited education maybe there's somebody with a higher education here but unless that branch has been cut off it's connected to the vine so the life of that that vine is flowing through the branch now brother brown would talk about the the the citrus tree that he saw with all the different fruits on it and there you can actually take other lives of the same kind of family and graft them in he and he talks about these these churches being grafted in and but they're not of the original life he said but when that vine gives out another branch it's going to bring forth of the original life amen because it can't help it if it's a peach it's going to bear for the peach if it's an orange it's going to bear forth an orange if it's a tomato it's going to bear forth a tomato it's going to bring forth whatever is in the roots amen and this is exactly what's taking place in this life you see where you very quickly you can find out what people are because of who they're connected to and what they're connected to i heard something very good today that all of us could use a little checkup he's on the christian radios listen to some christian music on the way in man come on there with a little with a little uh bible uh charge i guess or whatever just a very quick charge and he says you know he said in the time that we're living in satan and i'm just paraphrasing satan has programmed us to look down he gave us something to look at i'm guilty of it every one of us is guilty of our phones he said but a christian is not programmed to look down a christian is programmed to look up amen and he said what is it because in looking down you start looking at all the anything he take talks about and it's true there's a lot of good things there but we're not careful we get connected to the wrong things and before we know it we spend hours and hours on the wrong things when our eyes ought to be looking up for our redemptions drawing nigh amen he said i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing amen this goes for any minister goes for any church goes for any people without him you're nothing goes forever father goes forever mother goes for every child goes for every person that's trying to make yourself something without him you're nothing [Applause] he says oh i'm going to be this and i'm going to be there without christ you are nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branches we heard wednesday night god does not like fruitless trees and it's withered and the man gathered and cast them into the fire and they are burned but if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you now i want you to understand as we're taught here it's not so how many tapes i'm listening to how many i got to buy it in them i got to buy it in the mail we're not in reference reformation and all that and i ain't spent 12 hours a day in prayer that's not no it's the holy ghost living on the inside of you it'll direct you in a prayer life it'll direct you and take life it'll direct you into bible life it'll direct you in all those things that is abiding and when you have the holy ghost inside of you then you can ask what you will and it'll be given and placed there and jehovah jireh he said jesus will come to this platform and these people will produce the same kind of life and do the same things that he did here on earth we accept him for your needs will you raise your hands to him say i'll accept him for my needs lord bless you he said brother branham aren't you afraid to make that kind of statement no sir he promised it and it's his promise and he will bring it to pass no matter anything contrary to it i say it anything contrary to that i say it's a lie god said so that settles it god is the same jesus is the same the works are the same his life is the same he acts the same he acts in you as if he would when he was here on earth if you're connected to the vine and what he did say ye are the vine i i am the vine ye are the branches and then you also see the other tree bringing forth fruit there was two trees in the garden right tree of life and the tree of good and evil so you also see when it puts out another branch it's of the same life we you know we focus on the tree of life and that's our that's our message but don't forget there's a tree of good and evil as well amen and when it puts out it's still the same life that's why you can see people that would stand there and curse him and mock him and make fun of him and 2000 years again and doing it all over again why it's of the same branch of the same vine it's of the same life it's coming from underneath amen he talks about the tree of life he said the roots of that tree goes all the way up through all those realms and wraps around the throne of god it has a source it has a strength it has a light and it feeds the body it's fed him now for two thousand years and it hasn't run out of strength we can rejoice we got strength for the journey as we heard sunday ago he's our shady eye he hasn't run out of strength he hasn't run out of peace and joy and happiness and healing and deliverance and he has it and he never will but we see those vines running through scripture twins of every revival i mean goodness you can go through all of them the branch is energized by the life of the vine therefore jesus has no lips tonight on earth but mine and yours he has no eyes but mine and yours now if this is for the tree of life it's also true for the tree of good and evil the devil has no lips but who gives it to him he has no voice but who gives it to him he has no life no abilities but who yields their body as his temple that's why you see all the piercings that's going on and people changing themselves and i mean people going through crazy amounts of surgery to look like cats and dogs and then we've got to change our whole school system as we talked about here a while back of of a woman that stood up and said look i quit so when i when a when a teacher gets gets fired or put on on leave because she wouldn't me meow back to a child that re identified themselves as a cat said i'm done this world is crazy and if you don't think it's crazy that means you're crazy with it cause people ain't crazy unless they different from you as long as they act like you they ain't crazy they might be but you don't know that because you right there with them and you acting like them just like them and you're doing everything just like they do and you look at them say man that's a fine guy that is awesome and somebody over here is looking at both of you saying you're a bunch of crazy idiots nuts the world don't think they're crazy apparently they think the sanity to believe in the things they believe in and they got all kinds of them to believe the same thing if you think the world and the majority has a sane mind you've lost your mind you're in the same boat with them amen and if you think this world is okay if you think this world is just fine there's something wrong with you you're connected to the same source that the world is connected to and this world is going to burn [Applause] that's not my words that's thus saith the lord read it right here you say well it ain't come to pass well look how many prophecies has come to pass what makes you think that one ain't the devil has eyes on this earth he has voices on this earth he has spirits that overtake people to the point that they can speak out of them come in a prayer line be there lay your hands on them and hear them it's real you want to go around life and think they ain't nothing real they ain't no god well i can tell you one thing there's a devil amen if there's a devil there has to be a god he has no hands but mine and yours he energizes us and brings forth his life as he brings it through us whether it's by preaching the gospel by lips or seeing the vision by eye whether whatever it is laying hands on the sick is christ working through the branches of his church every office literally electrified by his presence hallelujah amen we're seeing the world being lit up by the sodom and gomorrah spirit and their lives are electrified by hell there's also a body here on this earth the body of jesus christ as been literally electrified by his presence [Applause] it's electrified how can i be lit up like that brother timothy it's very easy plug in it's very easy just plug it in man i'm looking for something i don't see nothing here yeah i better not go digging around in there then you're gonna have whatever kind of your sister can have every kind of advice appliance in your house and it can look just as pretty sitting on your cabinet or in your closet and you can bring it out and put it on your cabinet and you can push every button on it and sometimes you're like what is wrong with this machine this thing's stupid i just bought it ain't working no you ain't plugged it in yet i've did it before man you wiggle every knob on there and you try to what's wrong with you come on this thing's supposed to work i've used it many times what's wrong with it there's a plug on the back of it and apparently it's for a reason and apparently if you don't plug it in it's just going to sit there like a dead person like a dog like a knot on a log and just sit there and oh and i'll see what's wrong with a lot of people well i'm not emotional that means you're dead and if your religion is dead you need to bury it and get you a new one that's the prophet of god amen so in other words you need to grab a hold of your life and the lifeline and say god where's my socket at where's my place at i want to be plugged in to the presence of almighty car i want to be plugged into the healing flow i want to be plugged into joy and speakable and full of glory i want to be plugged in to the presence of almighty god [Applause] literally electrified by his presence i am the vine here the branches the vine does not bear fruit the vine only energizes the branch the branch bears fruit oh brother branham was here he was a branch he was not the vine i know some people want to make him the vine but he wasn't the vine the vine is jesus christ let's get that straight real quick the vine is jesus christ brother branham was a branch that sprung out amen as it would the branches of that that candlestick as they come out in that seventh church eight and lit up growing from the same source he is a branch so are ye branches so are ye lights so are you the presence of god can come and illuminate you as it did that branch why because you're connected to the same source the same power that illuminated william branham's life it's the same power in the church of the living god that's why we have the power over blood pressure and over cancer and over every demon of hell it has been given to us not by that branch but by the vine it's energized there's energy taking place if it's a pumpkin it'll bear pumpkin if it's a watermelon it'll bring forth the watermelon if it's a grape it'll bring forth a grape if the church is in christ it'll bear christ like spirits oh oh when you see those spirits in a church that wants to divide and conquer and wants to separate families that's not a christ-like church no no cry it'll have christ-like works it'll have christ-like faith if it's properly connected a good healthy vine not cut off hanging down with it away but a real healthy branch connected to a vine will bring forth fruit i don't say this to be embarrassing to anybody but one of the greatest trials in the building of this whole church was these lovely speakers up here sound is like air conditioning you know it can't make everybody happy and brothers do an amazing job up there and i wouldn't want their job i had it i didn't like it and i don't want it because once the it's cut you don't have to be connected no more except some people some people ain't going to let them be disconnected but we had issues as many of you know with these speakers we hung them where both said hang them we did what both said do and they sounded terrible you could come in here and you could sit over there and be a wonderful one service the next service couldn't hear a thing go over here same thing over here be too loud over there be not loud enough and we're just having a fit then poor brothers i don't know how they ain't gray-headed today i got those strands right up in there just because of that and we're wondering what in the world we're trying everything we tried to put extra speakers try to do everything we could do we tried to we tried to buy whatever we had to buy whatever we had to do to make it make it work finally we got a hold of somebody against brother mike working through the people we bought it through got a hold of bows they sent their main engineer who had designed these things he came into this building and he began to walk up and down that aisle right there he turned on a certain kind of noise some kind of noise they listened to to hear all the frequencies and he walked up that aisle he walked back down and he walked back up and he turned back around he said i bet every dollar i got is right wired wrong wired wrong well you may wired wrong well we didn't know this bose is a little different it's got it's got i don't remember exactly now but it's not like a normal speakers normal would be positive negative positive negative bose did something like positive negative negative positive and so two of the wires were wired backwards in every every main every speaker everything and it was causing all the issues we had you know what it took it took an engineer who had engineered it and he come in with a little screwdriver in 10 minutes and he fixed it right it was all perfect and he said set it back to manufacturer settings we set it back in this whole room filled with music and it was so wonderful and it's so pleasant and it was so great and i was like wow it's amazing what the man who designed it can do he knows it inside and out he put every speaker he lined it all up he these speakers are called room that match speakers they're they got certain horns i don't i'm not i'm not educating all that but i understand it's got certain horns that point certain directions to have amen a perfect sound in every part of the building and we have we've been blessed by those things and and it but it wasn't working but the engineer that designed it came and he said i know what's wrong and i know how to fix it and he took the screwdriver and he changed over those wires and he said now set it back to what i had it in the beginning and in the beginning it'll produce it now hallelujah amen churches have come down through 2 000 years and they wired it wrong and they put this over here they didn't read the manual they didn't read what the bible said but the presence of god came in this age and it said this thing's supposed to make a certain sound it's supposed to sound a certain way hallelujah angels bring down the tool chairs bring down and come here and send it back to factory settings set it back to what it was in the beginning because it'll sound the same as it did in the beginning because it came from the same branch from the same vine hallelujah maybe this morning your your voice and your life is not sounding out you got high spots you got low spots you got no spots there is a word there is an engineer that can come in this building in just a few minutes turn a few screws hallelujah and change you back to what they were in the beginning hallelujah maybe you got some down moments right now he can turn a few screws don't take him long don't take him long he designed the thing in the beginning i think brother brother henry greene said something like this he said god started his church in the beginning like he wanted it and now he wants his church like he started brother brandon would say over and over he said when if that vine ever puts forth another branch it'll have the same life it'll have the same power it'll have the same everything it'll be the same light it'll be moving it'll be pulsating it'll be energizing there'll be something taking place in that church amen it won't be a church of dead works and dead letter and sitting like a dead stump on the law or dad's bumping the law it won't be sitting like that there'll be something pulsating on the inside it'll be a lie amen be like that spring the brother brandon would walk to he said are you bubbling because i'm here are you bubbling because a deer drink from you are you bubbling because the birds come down and they say he said if that spring could ever speak out it said i'm bubbling not because you're here not because of the deer not because of the birds i'm bubbling because there's something underneath me that's pushing out amen maybe you're on the stream this morning you wonder what's wrong with that church what's going on there what's happening there i can tell you what's up we've been connected to the same source that peter was connected to therefore we can walk to the same gate and lay me and be walking there and sit there and say in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk and they throw down the cigarettes and they throw down the drinking and they walk away from it why it's the same source is somebody with me this morning ye are the lights christ is in his church it'll bear christ like spirits christ like worst works christ like faith so how do we get it to where now we don't need what they had back then well then you're not an original bra a branch you've been grafted in you're just like the church of christ you can call yourself a message i'll call you message of christ that'll help you feel better church of christ you can call yourself whatever you want to call yourself but if you ain't got that original life flowing through you you've been grafted in well we don't need pentecostal things we we got the fullness of the word and there's nothing but a bunch of dead letter i don't know who you might think we are you want to put us off as a bunch of emotionalists but we ain't rejecters of the word we didn't reject the word and just take a motion we accepted the word of god and we're rejoicing in the word of god i'm not rejoicing because i got a tingling i'm not rejoicing because i gotta feel good time i'm rejoicing because i saw my name on the book i'm rejoicing because the word's been opened to me in my day and then in that opening of the word it revealed so many things but you know one of the most important things they revealed in there i'm written there you're written there amen could you imagine if you got called up tomorrow amen to go before judge and you didn't really know what it's about and he opened up this letter and he began to say aaron always be you have a certain certain person died and it left you 10 million dollars it left you 10 000 acres it left you a great home and left you all kind of thing my goodness you'd be getting wow this is amazing this is great i'll take it it's mine it's got my name on it i got identification that's my name that's who i am i am that person i receive it right now whoa this is what's happening this day an open book has come down hallelujah it said i don't have you just a fine hole that'll revolve the rod and the mild rod i got your home that'll never ride i got you a place that'll never decay i got you a place you don't ever have to leave again whoa amen an earthly judge would give you a place one day you'll die what day you'll have to leave what day all the money will be gone but in the reason of this life [Applause] [Music] timothy pruitt has a new body doing it hallelujah hey man let me read some more he's got a house he wants to carry he's got a mansion that won't die won't run away boats will never get it weeds will never grow over no more they'll be all dealt with and done away how about you hell and dare do you see your name their parents do you see your name do you see your name this morning why did the light go why did the light come in this generation so it could shine on a book my name is there i am that's me i got the identification that's who i am let's rejoice in the lord this morning hallelujah that's who i am ye are the lights literally electrified by his presence i'm not done yet but let's just praise him for a moment hallelujah hey if you see your name there this morning i believe there ought to be a little rejoice in there [Applause] a vine connected to a branch a branch connected to the vine and jesus said when that happens the works that i do shall you do also because you know why it's the same life so it can't do different works or it's not the same life that's right yes sometimes that's just too simple to go people go well we got something different now we got this we got that and their lives are dead there's nothing coming from them no no from the fruits of the spirit no true brotherly kindness people can say they got brotherly kindness and treat you like a devil ain't true brother kindness that's an evil spirit you took given by a creed or a dogma passed down by a man it's not connected to the original vine the works that i do shall ye do also even greater works brother brown dealt with that how could it be greater than what he did it ain't greater it's now not just one body this is not just one little vine coming up it's branched out and it's branched out over in russia ukraine europe it's branched out all the way down in the dark places of africa where they ain't no if you wonder how in the world i you know i was down in south america and i i got the privilege one of my first what was my first actually mission trip preaching trip when i went before that with my dad but this first time i went to minister in 2003 i thought i'd go back never been back to that place flew an hour in this little puddle jumper held together what looked like bailing wire and duct tape it ain't always woo you get to see the world well sometimes you're like am i going to make it and i'm thinking well paul made it on a ship that was trying to you know seize mercy and i'll never forget went down there about the same time i called home and my papal butts was being taken to the hospital with heart issues mind battles oh yeah there was no phones to call home down in there for a whole week i didn't know if he'd be alive when i came out the devil tried to tell me all kinds of things i didn't know if i'd be alive i mean it's it was serious and i'd get in that boat we'd go eight hours up this river that was our highway was a river up to this little village they didn't even know where it's coming i think i've told this but and i'm thinking about it like how in the world did the message get up here this was no internet there wasn't no clicking on the website how in the world because we're not just eight hours now of a river there's no telling how far we are back to the mouth where it comes from the ocean because this river was connected to the ocean because it would go up and down with the tide and i don't know how far up in there we was but we was a ways and we took this boat eight hours and i'm i'm on my way i'm thinking how brother basil as he's talking began to describe he was out fishing he was a commercial fisherman out there in the ocean and some pirates got after him he thought he said man i thought this is going to be a bad day i'm about to lose everything he said i saw the mouth of this river and i ran up in it and hid up in here he said while i was up in here i began to go into the little village while i was hiding from them pirates i walked into the little village off the river and i began to spread the gospel and that's how the message got in here the dumb devil trying to ruin somebody's day you didn't do nothing but spread the fire [Applause] sometimes you need to realize some days your days ain't being ruined sometimes your days are being made thank you lord that was real good we'll get we always think man biting against the fight don't forget who's leading you we get so sidetracked by all the nonsense around us we forget who's the li the light in front of us i mean think of the children of israel they thought we're about to have a bad day been following this light and he led us right to a red sea and now the pharaoh's coming behind us there's mountains over here how are we going to get out their day was about to be made because the first time in history was i see you about to be open and walk across on dry land could you imagine the stories they was able to tell their children for generations after generations of what they witnessed and felt because of a bad day so this message gets up in there because of pirates we're on our way up in there and they didn't this this group of indians they didn't know we was coming we couldn't get we couldn't get to them we felt to go so we get out we pull off the mouth of this uh little river and pull into a creek and out of the bushes steps this white haired indian they just don't know how old he is they don't keep up with time they don't keep up with miles they don't keep up with nothing but food he steps out and he's got a couple guys with him and there he got something like a ain't a spear but it's something like a big rod and he's shouting shouting and i'm what in the world going on look over brother basil and he got tears coming down his eyes he looked over at me and brother danny and brother jackie benton he said this is the chief i believe there's a chief or one of the elders in that tribe he said last night an angel came to him in a dream he said go to the mouth of the creek i've got three white men bringing fire [Applause] that'll put some confidence in you god knows where i'm at he knows how many is there is of us he didn't say two he didn't say one he said three one two three he's talking about me [Applause] i don't know here we are no wonder paul had the confidence when they're grabbing that wood and that snake bit him and he just looked at that thing you said you dumb devil shook him off in the fire and killed him oh my god what we could do with that this morning as satan thinks he's going to try to defeat you and try to tear you down his bite is only an opportunity for his death hallelujah his attack on you is an opportunity for god to rise up in the light of god's word totally destroyed your enemy [Applause] christ in his church energizing bringing the same thing same things he did when he was on earth he's did it in all ages gone by so how come we think he's gonna do it different here he's in his church doing the same thing oh oh i see what it is it says it's too bad we've drawn lines and barriers and got different little sensations and isms instead of taking what god said to be the truth now we know why people think he's going to do it different but to make light up in these light bulbs that we're looking at this morning it takes two pieces of material it takes a a a neutral and a hot wire it takes it takes it to to bring a little bit i'll call it a dynamo and actually make it to make a and i don't know all the signs that brother i'd probably get brother james mitchell up here and he could tell us all about it but you only on a motor electric motor it has to take both forces to make it turn right it takes it to make it move like a dynamo dynamo that'll make that thing do to make it like make it light and he said when you get those two pieces of material to work together it'll make faith it'll make power it'll make healing when the believer and god gets to turning together so it sounds like to me you're not allowed if you want to work in this kind of capacity you're not allowed just to sit dead as a hammer it takes both of you you and god turning together amen turning together and that when that happens it generates the power of his resurrection when a believer takes his word in their heart it begins to generate her it begins to bring forth faith and it because he promised it everything is in line and the only thing you have to do to get electricity there is push the button that's all you have to do when the scripture is to be fulfilled press the button don't be afraid it will produce what it said it would but sometimes theology and church doctrines and everything clog up the faith line it becomes a break and a connection clogs up lines to you've been taught that those saints can't be and oh that oh now i know why people been taught it can't be that way so we're finding out it's not god that said it is man that said it man's decreed that to be thus and there we take man's ideas versus god's word it's pretty simple clogged up the lies till you've been taught but those things can't be and it puts a blockage there he said could you imagine this building here being energized tonight for light by by the electricity electricity is an unseen force when it was harnessed and brought on you know when benjamin franklin i believe it was i got a historian here he might could help me but i believe benjamin wants the thought is that benjamin franklin sent something up in the air and i guess lightning struck it was that him that did that it's a story sounds good send it up in there and had something tied on this line and like electric electro a lightning bolt hit it and he said i got it i got it but he didn't know what he had he had something but he didn't know what he had but along came edison and put it to work and today we can send a wireless telegram right from here anywhere in the world by wireless telegram it's an unseen force moving through space that no man can catch it now we're way beyond all of that right but so i but only machinery can catch you because it's too fast for the eye yet there's a force that there's telegrams coming right through here now i mean we could hook up a tv we can hook up a radio we can hook up all kinds of things there's there's unseen forces coming through this building even brother adam will talk about it he said there's unseen force of the holy ghost even that's moving through this building he said there's a sending station but there has to be a receiving station and the receiving station has to be wired correctly to be able to receive from the sending station that thing up there you ain't wired to receive anything like that but if you wired it correctly it would put pictures on there if you wired it correctly sometimes they have issues with it what is the problem something that got disconnected that something doesn't cause a problem something's wrong in the computer there's a disconnection or a blockade somewhere and once you get that connected it'll send it again but then it'll also receive it again and this is where he's at he said see it once handed in the right capacity amen to receive he said how much more could the power of the holy ghost once passed through a human heart by faith what could it do he talked about a man a mental guy that supposedly they can take by their mental capabilities could break glass look at it stare at it do whatever and break glass i don't know how they do it but he said that's he said that's a perverted thing he said imagine if they can do it by a perverted thing what a real thing will do see god has not promised us electricity only just might have to set them free but look what the holy spirit has promised to the believers today then when we look back and see that god put electricity here for a certain thing and science is moving in there and tapping into it but we as christians if we're not careful we become too clogged where we can't see it we can't feel it we don't know nothing about it the doctor said i can't well he said again well he said as long as you're thinking that he said but if you'll think god's thoughts he said but as long as you think that you're going to go into well i'm going to just die doctor said i'm going to die he said all regard best regards to the doctor that's the best of his knowledge he said you're going to die that's human speaking i believe the same thing but by the word i can't believe it amen because he promised it whatsoever i asked the father in his name it would be granted if god could just send that clear little channel and run that energy to that place then something's going to happen the whole body is set together to operate and life begins to move just as sure as it takes every member of my body to operate and give me life so does it take every member of the body of christ to operate together to get it right and some are put as teachers apostles prophets gifts of healing miracles speakers of tongues inter interpretations so forth all these things are for one great mystic body of jesus christ moving on earth today lights my goodness he says the body is correctly wired up when that heavenly father turns that master switch on something's going to move oh so either it ain't came time for the switch to be turned on or that he hits the switch and something's been disconnected somewhere because if he hits the switch and it's properly connected it's going to move it's going to hum it's going to happen it's going to take place there's nothing going to stop it amen he said now see what happens if it's properly taught and every fiber of your body lost in christ and his word he said now if you got theology if you got some doctrine you got some superstition you got some of them believe you got something that stops them somewhere then that energy can never pull through you but when you got to a place where you're perfectly wired and the master electrician is located by the ceiling of the holy spirit the only thing there is is to turn the switch on [Music] i love this next statement and he said when you turn that switch on there will be a light show [Applause] i don't know about you but i like a good light show it's something about a light show i like watching it whether it's uh lasers or whether it's a fireworks whatever it is i enjoy a light show amen and i enjoy there's nothing more i enjoy than a person who's been so dark and dead and sin and they've been dead for years after years after a year but everything's being wired sometimes you don't know what's going on but he's wiring it up he's changing all the tied up knots and he's taking an untying and he's putting this wire here where it belongs that wire there where it belongs this over here justification where it belongs sanctification where it belongs and all of a sudden it comes time to hit the switch i enjoy those times amen a pastor you know sometimes can preach and preach and preach and never see a light show he's something he's the ox of the team he can preach and he can plant he can sow and he can hang he can he can till he can do all kinds of things and he never sees the harvest some too many times you don't see the harvest under his ministry but he'll bring a person in and that man will begin to preach a certain thing and something all of a sudden strikes that heart and a switch comes on and a light show takes off and light begins to dawn in a dark place [Applause] hallelujah that's why it's important for pastors and everything you can do it all by yourself amen we need the whole body we need the evangelists we need them all we need them to come because you never know who god will use to flip a switch and don't ever get weary in him and well doing because he's behind the scenes all the time wiring up the building [Applause] he said i ain't seen them in my child i ain't seen it in my husband i just keep praying god's working on the wire keep praying god's untying all the knots he's putting the red one where it belongs the black one where it belongs the white one where it belongs could you imagine what this building would do it would burn down to slap to the ground if this place wasn't wired right and you try to even throw every breaker and do some all kind of damage amen but it took somebody with the right knowledge to take the the right lines and run them to the right place hook them to the right things to the right's crews and tie it all in and now it works i mean this building's amazing you walk into a bill into a place in the and the lights come on now just in case some of y'all's wondering that doesn't mean you got some special blessing that means somebody wired it up that way you know we had heard a man one time went to an airport for the first time and he never seen uh water that automatically ran when you put your hands under he had never seen where you went over there to the place and also in the air or you got up and it automatically flushed or you walked away and automatically he ain't seen none of that you know what he thought man i just become real i must be real spiritual i put my hands there the water just comes on no somebody did that this building was wired for lights to come on it's a wonderful thing because we don't have to go around trying to make sure all these lights are out because they automatically go back out at certain times it was done that way and you don't know sometimes just what god's doing in your family you don't know just what how he's wiring it all up and he's working in the background there's so much in here in these walls you don't even see working but it's still working we see the fruition of it see the manifestation of it amen if it wasn't working we'd be sitting in the dark but it's working you don't see it all it's all behind sheetrock and painting rocking car carpet even underneath this building there's stuff working god's always working amen he's going to make your child's light shine you just make sure you be there and ready to see the flip the switch flipped on because there's going to be a light show i remember the testimony of sister kathy's nephew i was there right after his his experience with god if i understand right here's a boy that was out gone deep and i understand he walked into his bedroom and the presence of god met him there and his little fl his lit his uh his switch got flipped i love how i love how the chosen picked up on that all those fish swimming in one direction dark but all of a sudden they illuminate when they turn and go the other way this is exactly what happens in a christian's life amen if you're dark this morning you're swimming with all the other darkness you're going right along to the same place they're going but there is a man who can turn on the light he knows exactly how to wire your light you say brother timothy you don't understand all this went on in my life and all the things that i've done and all the mistakes and all my my dad did to me my mom did to me and this one over here did that and that would god knows how to make all uncross all of that and he knows how to take that wire yep it's in the wrong place i'm putting it right here where it belongs this one's on the wrong place i'm putting right here where it belongs this one's over here in the wrong place i put it right there where it belongs i was a brother derek coffee shop the other day sister rebecca said hey our sealer quit our car they got a nice little machine you just run them bags through and it seals them so you can coffee can come this is a shameless plug your coffee can be just sealed and delivered to you fresh good it went out you know why because somebody thought it was a good idea to put an emergency stop switch in that thing and that emergency swap stop switch had apparently malfunctioned and caused the whole thing to go off brother derek is over there like well i gotta do this i'm just gonna go order me another one sorry brother derek i'm just telling like it happened i'm gonna order me another one so we i mean sister ruth was there and we started looking for a fuse and see if finally since the roof found with this you know this thing was made in china so it's it's a it's a it's a different situation nothing's in english so you can't find those nothing that you can even understand so i'm just trying to follow wires where's this she finds the fuse the fuse is good we test it it's all good plug it back like this and that i said i looked at that emergency stop thing i said you know what somebody thought that was a good idea but now it's malfunctioning shut it off permanently you know a lot of people want some emergency stop switching the service and they'll wire them right in [Laughter] oh boy a lot of preachers are wired right in people get a little bit too fanatical no we can't have that that's emotion no somebody's getting sealed that's right boy this is good i didn't know this is gonna happen pretty soon i got up there and i looked at that wire and i said i'm gonna cut that thing i'm gonna bypass it we don't need it know how ain't nothing but bags being sealed big deal ain't gonna kill you amen if your finger runs through it it'll just be sealed and so i grabbed the wire cutters and i cut that wire and i hooked them together real quick we plugged her in and that thing come on i said yep that's what the problem was it's that dumb emergency switch right there and so we took something we made that permanent you know what we did we took that emergency switch it looks like it looks like it's there but you could hit it all you want to it ain't going to work you can knock it on it you can do everything you want to do it you can pop it up and down you say hey please please it ain't gonna work let me warn you come to this service you might think you've got emergency stop switch it ain't gonna work amen it's been bypassed by the word of god it's been taken away and we're running and energized by the presence of almighty god hallelujah i'm here to tell you there is an electrician in this building that are one wire every stoppage in your life he'll unwire every blockade in your life and he'll plug it up and it'll begin the world all things are possible it'll begin the world healing is my deliverance is mine i ain't that man no more i ain't that woman no more i am his and the devil's over there hitting the stop switch whoa he's over here to stop twist stop them stop them too late it's been bypassed too late it's been done away with it don't work no more hallelujah how many here this morning can say my stop switch has been unwired it's been destroyed and i'm going on with jesus let's stand our feet this morning there will be a light show [Applause] quit trying to stop the presence of god
