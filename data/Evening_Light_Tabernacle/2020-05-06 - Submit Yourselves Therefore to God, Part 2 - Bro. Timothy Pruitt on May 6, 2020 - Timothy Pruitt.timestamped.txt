[13:18] place where they can receive the
[13:20] promises that are theirs Lord where they
[13:22] can receive the healing that's theirs
[13:24] where they can receive the Holy Spirit
[13:26] that's promised the Lord nor those

[14:30] know and Lord you're the only one that
[14:32] could possibly comfort it in a time like
[14:34] this

[14:36] that family Lord Lord may they feel you
[14:39] draw near to them tonight Lord Jesus and
[14:41] keep them and hold them through this
[14:42] time Nord each and every other need that
[14:45] was read Lord you know it and you

[14:49] look to the word tonight Lord we expect
[14:52] it to come forth and power we expect it
[14:54] to come forth and demonstration no we
[14:57] expect it to hit the mark tonight Lord
[14:59] Jesus because this is a predestinated
[15:01] moment we may not be gathered under this
[15:03] roof tonight as a congregation but each
[15:05] one that's tuned in God you knew they
[15:08] would be listening and you knew what we
[15:09] had need of and we're just expecting the
[15:11] bread of life to be broken to us today
[15:13] Lord and for to meet each and every
[15:15] situation we're facing Lord that's the
[15:18] wonderful thing about this word is it
[15:20] never fails to come and address what we
[15:23] have need of though we're expecting

[27:14] [Music]
[27:33] more time I use my car
[27:39] [Music]
[27:53] this
[27:57] so
[28:05] [Music]
[28:20] and man
[28:26] or Jesus has truly our desire Lord you
[28:31] to feel every fiber of our being for you
[28:34] to have control of our lives of the
[28:36] situation's things that we can handle
[28:39] Lord pressures that are pawn his father
[28:42] Lord we just want to commit it to you
[28:45] and to give it to you father Lord would
[28:48] know you're able to handle it we know
[28:50] you know the answers Lord everything
[28:52] order were so thankful father for the
[28:55] report Lord a brother on and what you're
[28:58] doing in his body in his life he's just
[29:02] so thankful Lord you're still the healer
[29:04] you're still the deliverer Lord you
[29:07] still move in impossible situations well
[29:10] god thank your father that's not you
[29:13] bless us this evening Lord you'd speak
[29:15] to our hearts you touch us Lord erectus
[29:18] or do you know those that are listening
[29:20] the hearts cry father even across the
[29:23] land Lord across the waters places we
[29:27] can't get to and we can't go to right
[29:29] now but Lord is not necessary that we go
[29:33] where we be there with our physical
[29:35] presence because know Lord we know
[29:37] there's angels they can go in places
[29:39] that men forbid Lord and jail houses
[29:43] bars and gates angels just go right into
[29:47] where they're at Lord and minister and
[29:50] moving among among them Lord as you did
[29:53] Peter and Paul and Silas Lord I know
[29:56] there's those are suffering father in
[29:58] places Lord that we can't get to but
[30:01] Lord we know the angels of God can come
[30:02] to the
[30:03] tonight and minister to them Lord and
[30:06] lift them up Lord and Lord and drive
[30:08] away the old spooky spirits and little
[30:11] things that are haunting them and Lord
[30:13] and put a joy in their heart we pray we
[30:16] commit this to you Lord in this service
[30:18] in your hands in Jesus name Amen amen
[30:23] let's turn to James chapter 4 a man just
[30:27] want to pick up on the thought again of
[30:31] submit yourselves therefore to God
[30:33] submit yourself therefore to God says
[30:37] here in James chapter 4 and verse 7
[30:39] submit yourselves therefore to God
[30:42] resist the devil and he will flee from
[30:45] you
[30:46] amen will let you be seated this evening
[30:50] also on a read from Romans 6 and verse
[30:54] 14 says for sin shall not have dominion
[30:58] over you for you are not under the law
[31:01] but under grace what then shall we sin
[31:05] because we're not under the law but
[31:06] under grace god forbid I notice his
[31:10] verse no you're not that to whom ye
[31:13] yield yourselves servants to obey his
[31:16] servants ye are to whom ye obey whether
[31:18] of sin unto death or of obedience unto
[31:23] righteousness now we know also the Lord
[31:26] Jesus would say that no man could serve
[31:28] two masters so you're either going to
[31:31] yield yourself to one or to the other
[31:33] and we know when you get down to the
[31:35] bare bones of the whole thing that we're
[31:37] dealing with the day there's two powers
[31:39] there's God and there's Satan and and
[31:43] you know we could look at Satan and
[31:44] Satan has very very many faces and very
[31:47] many a very a lot of spirits and things
[31:49] he attacks in different ways some that
[31:52] he can use against you that don't
[31:54] necessarily work against me and and he
[31:57] tries to find out what works according
[31:59] to our human nature and how that we are
[32:01] built and so he tries to come in those
[32:04] areas but we know as we as he said no
[32:07] man could serve two masters so Paul is
[32:09] speaking here and he said whom ye yield
[32:11] yourselves servants to obey his servants
[32:14] ye are to whom you
[32:16] babe whether it's sin unto death or
[32:18] obedience unto righteousness but God be
[32:21] thanked think that you are the servitor
[32:24] we that you were the servants of sin but
[32:27] you have obeyed from the heart that form
[32:29] of doctrine which delivers delivered
[32:31] unto you being then made free from sin
[32:34] you became the servants of righteousness
[32:36] so I'd like to also look at mainly three
[32:39] words tonight yield or a submit yield
[32:43] and commit you know what will we yield
[32:46] to what what are you be yielding
[32:48] ourselves to or what or they are in
[32:51] other words what are we permitting our
[32:53] granting rulership over us is it fear or
[32:57] regrets or past or our failures of the
[33:00] past or past hurts or pain inflicted by
[33:04] others or are we yielding to the
[33:06] complexes and the hurt and this calls
[33:09] from the pain or you know what you say
[33:12] well I can handle it you may handle it
[33:14] for a little bit but sooner or later
[33:15] your your your extent of your strength
[33:18] will run out you said well I can carry
[33:21] it well you can carry that for a little
[33:23] bit but sooner or later the strength
[33:25] that you have on your own you'll wear
[33:26] out and and you'll find yourself crash
[33:29] somewhere or are we here where we yield
[33:32] ourselves to God and allow him that with
[33:35] the unlimited strength you're the
[33:38] unlimited stamina or the unlimited
[33:40] abilities allow him to take our burdens
[33:44] and our pains away from us and and to
[33:46] deal with them you know as long as we
[33:48] think that we can do it we can't do it
[33:52] but as long as the way when we can get
[33:55] to a place where we know we can't do it
[33:58] and yield ourselves to God then he can
[34:02] do it he meant I'm thankful when I can
[34:05] get I love that when I'm able to get to
[34:06] that place you know we all come to
[34:08] places in our lives we come to as it
[34:10] said the metaphor or whatever said to
[34:12] the end of our road or end of our rope
[34:14] and we get to the place where we don't
[34:16] know where to go or how to go or how to
[34:18] handle something or our you know when we
[34:21] just kind of finally get to that pull
[34:23] spot to where we take our hands off the
[34:25] wheeler we take our hands off of it
[34:27] that's when
[34:28] I can move on your behalf that's what
[34:31] then if it's us trying to do it will
[34:34] fail we'll come to the end of our
[34:35] strength we'll come to the end of our
[34:37] stamina will come to end of our
[34:39] abilities will come to the end but God
[34:42] never comes to the end of his strength
[34:44] he never has an end to his abilities he
[34:47] never has a straight into his stamina
[34:49] amen he still can carry you through he
[34:52] still can move he still can move in
[34:54] obstacles amen he still can do all of
[34:57] those things it's the only thing God
[34:59] cannot do and that's fail hallelujah he
[35:03] can do anything else but fail we can
[35:05] fail governments can fail people can
[35:07] fail daddies mamas can fail children's
[35:10] can fail remember one thing God cannot
[35:12] do it's failed
[35:14] Amen there's one thing he can do that's
[35:16] fail he can do anything else but fail
[35:18] and so as long as we're trying in
[35:21] ourselves and we're depending upon our
[35:23] own abilities will do nothing amen but
[35:27] when we get to the place that would know
[35:29] we're nothing then God can use us God
[35:33] can use this amen the important thing
[35:35] now this is an important thing to master
[35:36] and here in our lifetime and sometimes
[35:39] it takes a lifetime to master amen but
[35:41] some it says that you know brother Brad
[35:43] was safe to speak of I kiss you he
[35:45] said especially us you young preachers
[35:48] or but he said even lay members alike
[35:50] there's one thing we've got to master if
[35:53] we expect to fulfill God's desire in our
[35:56] life and I I think that's where it comes
[35:58] down to is the war between our desire
[36:01] and God's desire he said but if we come
[36:04] down and we expect to fulfill God's
[36:06] desire in our life we have to master the
[36:11] thought of human ability well it's my
[36:14] abilities I'm gonna be the best I'm
[36:16] gonna do the best huh I'm going to get
[36:19] this driving this I got to do this I got
[36:20] to do but it comes to the point that we
[36:23] have to master the thought of human
[36:25] ability that human ability no matter if
[36:28] you're the best basketball player the
[36:30] best athlete or are the bestest or best
[36:33] that you have a limit to your ability
[36:36] you have the I have a limit to what you
[36:38] can do or what you can achieve or what
[36:41] you can accomplish but we serve a God as
[36:44] we said has no limits there's no
[36:46] limitations on him so he can take you
[36:49] places further and greater than you can
[36:52] ever take yourself he can provide for
[36:54] you more and greater than what you could
[36:57] ever provide for yourself he can do more
[36:59] for you than what you can do for
[37:01] yourself amen so if you ever get to the
[37:04] spot that we think we can do it or our
[37:06] own intelligence or own abilities we got
[37:09] to master that in such a way to where we
[37:11] can lay that aside and so God can use
[37:14] this right then it takes a complete
[37:17] surrender amen that's a hard thing to do
[37:21] is surrender self and and to surrender
[37:23] to the thought of I can or I will or you
[37:26] know and then even the age that we're
[37:28] living living living in is very much
[37:30] geared on on human abilities and the and
[37:33] they're lifting up or the exalting of
[37:35] human abilities you know never has there
[37:38] been an age to where there's been an
[37:39] exulting of of the human ability to you
[37:42] know to shoot a basketball to throw a
[37:43] thing or or to kill an animal or to do
[37:45] this or do that it's always I got the
[37:47] best I've done the best I've done this
[37:49] and now we got all the platforms to put
[37:51] out all the eye things you know and so
[37:53] but it but this is completely opposite
[37:56] to what God wants God wants a body of
[37:59] people that he can use that would yield
[38:01] themselves and yield their mind yield
[38:03] their spirits use their bodies whatever
[38:05] and so some pletely surrender to where
[38:09] it's not God not you doing it but it's
[38:11] God doing it inside of you see we cannot
[38:14] use one ability we got to make a
[38:16] complete surrender and to come to God
[38:18] you got to surrender him both body so
[38:21] our body soul and spirit everything that
[38:25] you are has to be surrendered to God in
[38:28] order that he can work his will in you
[38:30] and in me it's hard it's a hard thing
[38:34] this human nature was I I got this and I
[38:36] got that or you know we got these hurt
[38:39] so we got these pains and and we want to
[38:41] hold it because we're in holding that we
[38:42] think we're holding something we're not
[38:44] letting them out of their faults or out
[38:46] of their failures in
[38:47] and out of what somebody did to us but
[38:49] truly and holding all of that you're the
[38:52] one that's truly the prisoner you're
[38:54] held by those things and the best thing
[38:55] to do is let them go a man and so but
[38:58] all of this and in our mind and our
[39:00] spirit and our body I mean every part
[39:03] must be surrendered to God
[39:05] some people can give they're fed their
[39:07] bodies and some people can give their
[39:08] minds and some people but God wants it
[39:11] all amen
[39:12] I love the sermon brother Brett brother
[39:13] Donnie preach we listened to it a few
[39:15] weeks ago on the danger of Unser endured
[39:18] heart amen Samson could surrender his
[39:20] body I mean this one could surrender
[39:22] this but God wants everything and I want
[39:27] him to have everything of my life I want
[39:30] him to have every facet because I know
[39:31] that he'll take me further than I can
[39:34] take myself he can lift me higher than I
[39:36] could lift myself
[39:37] he can move me in places that I can't
[39:40] get and I can't go God can do things
[39:42] beyond the human abilities of the human
[39:45] understanding but what a human can
[39:47] manufacture God can go so far beyond all
[39:50] of that hallelujah but see we see we're
[39:54] always wanting to put our part into it
[39:57] you know how that will I did this or I
[40:00] did that something that we know you know
[40:03] that that's what we want you know well I
[40:05] just know it should be done this way but
[40:08] as long as you're doing it that way it's
[40:10] going to come out wrong Oh God will
[40:14] never use that effort maybe with the
[40:16] help of Lord he says we're going to show
[40:18] you
[40:18] amen how God cannot use your abilities
[40:23] but he can use your availability
[40:27] hallelujah amen we want to give it we
[40:30] don't but God want as I said well it's
[40:33] everything he but if you can give him
[40:36] your abilities then and also give him
[40:39] your availability and you can let him
[40:42] use it then God can do something with it
[40:44] but you know he said there's so much put
[40:47] upon the experiences of a seminary or
[40:50] some education or upon a relationship or
[40:53] a fellowship are we rest upon somebody
[40:55] else or are we rest upon men
[40:58] with abilities and he said the Bible
[41:00] says how can you have faith when you're
[41:02] preferring one another so when we're
[41:04] expecting saying this guy he's a great
[41:06] person or that's not a great person I'll
[41:08] lean on them that displeases God we must
[41:11] lean on God and God alone this is why
[41:16] you see people that fall away when a
[41:18] minister falls away or or they get they
[41:20] get all delusion and then turned upside
[41:22] down because some great Minister fell
[41:25] off the side of the earth and walked
[41:26] away from the Word of God he meant what
[41:29] was it their eyes or their abilities was
[41:31] on the wrong person and they was drawing
[41:33] strength from the wrong person God is a
[41:36] jealous God he wants you for himself aim
[41:38] in your mind for himself your body for
[41:41] himself your soul for himself your heart
[41:44] for himself he wants everything of us
[41:46] amen and so when our minds are for our
[41:49] eyes our heart is upon a man and his
[41:51] abilities or his ministry or his ability
[41:54] to sing or this sat in the other when
[41:56] they fall off somewhere or they hurt us
[41:59] in some way then we become disillusioned
[42:01] but listen God is trying to tell you get
[42:04] your eyes off the man he may have done
[42:07] you wrong he may have done wrong and he
[42:09] probably did do wrong well dirty human
[42:11] being that he is but listen that's not
[42:13] what we look at we look at what God did
[42:16] for us and what God is doing for us and
[42:20] how God is moving in our hearts and our
[42:22] life how God has changing me man is not
[42:25] doing this God is doing this hallelujah
[42:30] hey man so people should start trusting
[42:33] you know they put their trust in the
[42:35] ability of a man and then that manner do
[42:38] something to abuse that trust and man
[42:41] I'll do something to hurt that a man and
[42:44] then they'll go through years of pain
[42:46] and suffering because that trust was
[42:48] what they thought was a godly man what
[42:50] they thought was a good man what they
[42:52] thought was a righteous man and he does
[42:54] something amen and it causes an issue he
[42:57] said what is it we must yield ourselves
[43:00] not to man but to God because God is not
[43:04] going to break your trust
[43:06] God is not going to do something to
[43:08] wound you to hurt you know I wrote a
[43:10] letter here the other day as I sent a
[43:13] pen to somebody as a gift and was made
[43:16] this one it's just to come on my heart
[43:18] and they've been wounded by a facet of
[43:22] the message at the nomination of the
[43:24] messages I said I guess I could say it
[43:25] and they've been really wounded by
[43:27] people and I knew their wounds that they
[43:29] had cuz I've dealt with many of them has
[43:31] had these same words when they sing
[43:33] stuff and and I just wrote in my letter
[43:35] to them I said you know listen what we
[43:38] go through many times in the hurts that
[43:40] we face and the things that we face in
[43:42] our lives many times and I you know and
[43:44] you know it's not it's not what God did
[43:47] to us
[43:48] it's what man did to us he meant man I
[43:51] do you wrong
[43:52] a metahuman my man is nothing but a
[43:56] brute beast without the Holy Ghost he
[43:59] will do you wrong hey man now man with
[44:01] the Holy Ghost he won't do your own if
[44:03] he does he'll repent for it if he sees
[44:06] he made a mistake he'll come to you and
[44:07] say hey I'm sorry about that I shouldn't
[44:09] have done that but these others that you
[44:12] know they go right on and they make
[44:13] excuses for why they do things and how
[44:15] they operated how what to what they did
[44:17] and some of them committing sins and
[44:20] things in their lives and making excuses
[44:22] for it and living with it and hurting
[44:24] people but listen you can't look at that
[44:27] you got to turn back to God
[44:29] you got to yield yourself to God and say
[44:31] God I can't look at this stuff because
[44:34] when I look at it I get down I get
[44:36] depressed like I get it I'll get away
[44:37] from but I want to turn my eyes back to
[44:40] what you did for me and what you did for
[44:43] me is not betray me what you did for me
[44:45] has not hurt me what you did for me is
[44:48] you gave your life for me hallelujah but
[44:52] when we get our eyes upon a seemingly
[44:54] great person oh I can lean upon them
[44:57] that displeases God we must lead upon
[45:00] God and God alone we must trust the
[45:03] ability we must not trust the ability of
[45:07] ourselves or any man hello we must
[45:12] completely yield to God no ability I
[45:16] don't care whose it is he said who will
[45:18] ever
[45:19] be usable in the sight of God God has to
[45:22] get all of our abilities out of the way
[45:24] before he can achieve his purpose if
[45:27] he's got something for us to do and as
[45:29] long as we feel we're doing a pretty
[45:31] good job of it we'll never be used of
[45:34] God you know I have truly found that
[45:40] some of the sermons that touch the
[45:41] people is emotion when I walked out the
[45:43] back door and I said that was a terrible
[45:45] job that was horrible I don't even know
[45:50] if I want to preach anymore and you get
[45:52] all these kind of feelings going through
[45:53] and you realize this one was touched
[45:55] that one was dealt with that heart was
[45:56] dealt with and he was young right yes
[45:58] right God it wasn't me anyhow
[46:01] hey man it never has anything to do with
[46:03] me I don't want it to ever have the end
[46:06] to him true called God God called man
[46:08] never wants it to have anything to do
[46:10] with it all he can do is yield this is
[46:13] where the prophet of God would save
[46:15] himself and the guilt that God would use
[46:16] it's such a great magnitude in this hour
[46:19] he said the only thing I have to do with
[46:21] this is yield I yield to him and he
[46:25] speaks I yield to him and he does since
[46:28] it is him that doeth the work hallelujah
[46:31] and any Christian Amen that ought to be
[46:34] our hearts cry all I have to do with
[46:36] this as I yield and God does it for me
[46:39] he moves through me he says have you got
[46:41] something for us to do as long as we
[46:43] feel we're doing a good job of it we'll
[46:46] never be used of God you said whether
[46:48] you're making off a broad statement
[46:49] brother Brennan
[46:50] he said that is a broad one but look
[46:52] around and find out if it's not right or
[46:54] not look around today all the great
[46:55] achievement we think we've done where's
[46:57] Christian in the United States look at
[46:59] all of our churches denomination
[47:01] evangelist healing campaigns everything
[47:03] else worse than it ever was in the
[47:05] beginning it's worse off today than it
[47:07] ever was because we tried to do it in
[47:10] human abilities amen they gathered
[47:14] together they make long prayers they go
[47:16] out and how the other day says so many a
[47:18] hundred and fifty thousand or something
[47:20] gathered together
[47:21] both Protestant and Catholic saying some
[47:23] prayers praying some prayers making some
[47:25] prayer so forth they might as well not
[47:27] gathered it's nothing worth nothing in
[47:30] the sight of God he said well if I get
[47:32] critical forgive me but you got along
[47:34] you got to drive the thing down what
[47:37] good did it do nothing it'll never be
[47:40] until every person that professes to be
[47:43] a Christian will forget his own ability
[47:46] and yield himself to God then God can
[47:51] achieve his purpose by sending a man was
[47:55] not a revival but brother what he needs
[47:57] to do is first send the killing Oh
[48:00] hallelujah
[48:01] then we can revive we have to die before
[48:05] we can be born again amen he needs to
[48:09] can we need that he needs a killing of
[48:10] ourselves the tabernacle needs a killing
[48:13] and me with it
[48:15] pillow those there was a prophet of God
[48:18] and me with it all of us we need a
[48:21] killing so he can revive in a new life a
[48:25] new hold a new hope a new experience we
[48:27] need first a day a good day of mourning
[48:32] mercy we need a place of yielding to the
[48:36] spirit instead of so much dependent on
[48:39] schooling or upon our programs and our
[48:42] campaigns and all that we have we rely
[48:45] upon corporation so much with different
[48:48] minister to cooperate we allow this he
[48:50] said if we can get so many we won't do
[48:52] it we don't get so many we won't do it
[48:54] we won't go to cities without that we
[48:56] got this great big machine all this
[48:58] stuff happening we got to get out of the
[49:01] way from that that human ability we got
[49:04] to get to the place where you see we've
[49:07] now surrender our souls we surrender our
[49:10] lives even to the housewife to the
[49:12] farmer to the mechanic whoever it is so
[49:15] completely surrender to God and know
[49:18] that we are nothing then let God start
[49:28] from there
[49:29] and then he starts moving and working
[49:33] and that includes all of us every one of
[49:38] us he says that's the thing we've got to
[49:41] do mercy is he said history proves God
[49:47] always chooses the nobodies to become
[49:52] his somebodies hallelujah a song that
[49:58] they just come out with a I really like
[50:00] it says I'm just a nobody trying to tell
[50:03] everybody all about somebody
[50:06] he's the somebody hallelujah
[50:11] he's the somebody but we get into and we
[50:13] get into such a struggle how how can I
[50:16] make this work how can I do this and we
[50:17] got our minds running a million miles an
[50:20] hour's sometimes we can't even sleep at
[50:22] night because we're trying to figure it
[50:23] all out and things are going in their
[50:25] minds they're running yield give it to
[50:29] God he'd put it very simply like this
[50:33] and how can I overcome he said it's just
[50:35] like putting a little baby's arm in a
[50:38] sleeve hole he's just up and down you
[50:43] ever seen a baby trying to get there or
[50:44] you know even open up one two years old
[50:48] trying to get your head sometimes her
[50:49] head comes out the armhole or this that
[50:51] the other and he says he trying to put
[50:53] it up down over everything and you can't
[50:56] do it you just say well put your coat on
[50:58] honey he can't do it little arms up down
[51:01] around it takes your steady hand he said
[51:07] oh how glad I am I can just yield my
[51:10] hand to the Father and say Lord Jesus I
[51:15] can't get it in there you helped me put
[51:19] the coat on I quit trying and just let
[51:24] him do it
[51:26] he said if a little baby keeps trying oh
[51:29] I can do it I can do it I can do it you
[51:30] know my one of my two little kids would
[51:32] be like that no I can do you know they
[51:34] get a little age old and they want to
[51:35] try to do it for themselves
[51:36] like I said sooner or later they finally
[51:38] come out of the room and lot times your
[51:40] heads out the harm pockets and their
[51:42] clothes are all kind of different ways
[51:43] and sooner or later they do figure it
[51:45] out but
[51:45] you know the stages that they go through
[51:47] and then you go through that I can do it
[51:49] I can do it
[51:50] and gods saying just let me have it I
[51:53] can do I can haven't let me have it I
[51:56] can do it let me have it he says he says
[52:00] he's just there and he can't do it and
[52:03] he said neither can i and neither can
[52:05] you
[52:06] but if you'll just hold still and let
[52:09] him do it just yield to him here Lord
[52:13] Here I am just let be nothing meet me
[52:17] nothing I yield you put my hand in the
[52:21] right place and let me tell you if
[52:25] you'll give your hand to him every time

[52:30] place glory gonna try to put your hand
[52:33] out of a head hole or out of the other

[52:38] exactly where your hands supposed to be
[52:40] and your hands supposed to be and your
[52:43] feet goes he knows all about you he
[52:45] knows all about your life and he said if
[52:48] you'll just say Lord you put my hand in
[52:50] the right place that's the victory
[52:53] that's the overcoming the thing you have
[52:57] to overcome is yourself your idea your
[53:01] thing and surrender yourself to him and
[53:04] he overcome for you he knows the way
[53:09] whoa I know a man who knows the way
[53:13] through the wilderness he knows the way

[53:28] just let God do it what am I supposed to
[53:37] do with all this pain give it to God

[56:55] and the other around you your future is
[56:58] limited but if your eyesight can be
[57:00] changed from eyes of flesh and to eyes
[57:02] of faith and you begin to look beyond
[57:05] all the things that's going on around us
[57:07] and and the chaos around us and the
[57:10] problems all around us and the
[57:11] situations all around us and they ain't
[57:14] all of us in the whole world if that we
[57:16] could do anything about it if we wanted
[57:18] to and we do want to and ain't nothing
[57:20] we can do about it but my eyes are not
[57:24] going to continue to look right here
[57:26] around me but God I want my eyes to look
[57:31] into my future and then we start looking
[57:35] into that future this around here
[57:38] changes your focus changing your worries
[57:41] changing the things around you change
[57:43] because you're not living for just right
[57:45] now you can realize I got a greater
[57:47] future hallelujah and you forget all the
[57:52] past and you keep walking and living for
[57:56] the future and glory and the presence of
[57:58] God now there is a perfect way and
[58:01] there's a permissive way and even
[58:03] brother Brent I'm talking about that in
[58:04] this situation here he says I feel that
[58:07] if God here on the platform can show me
[58:10] things that's being in my rooms and so
[58:12] forth he's able to tell me just where he
[58:14] wants me and what he wants me to do but
[58:16] I feel as long as I've got it all hooked
[58:18] up and
[58:19] or a feel like when he won't put he
[58:22] won't put his hands on it as long as I'm
[58:24] doing it he said that's the way it is
[58:27] anything as long as you're doing it it's
[58:30] if someone talks about you or you talk
[58:32] back about them god can't fight your
[58:34] battles you're fighting yourself let
[58:40] loose and let him do it just commit it
[58:45] to him and so if he's doing it that's
[58:48] the perfect way but when we get our
[58:53] hands on it if we ain't careful we're
[58:55] gonna get in the permissive way because
[58:58] it's our way and our best side what we
[59:00] see fit but God has a perfect way and he
[59:04] said let loose and let him do it and
[59:06] just committed to him he says the
[59:09] greatest weapon I know use prayer and I
[59:11] write four or five other things but this
[59:13] is one of them the greatest weapon that
[59:15] I know of a Christian has today is
[59:18] committed to God Wow how many times do
[59:25] we use that greatest weapon or do we use
[59:29] our own abilities he said because when
[59:32] you can't do nothing about it and you
[59:34] commit it to him God to take care of it
[59:39] keep your faith there I can't do nothing
[59:42] about my child she's all out or he's out
[59:45] this is out and I can't do nothing about
[59:47] it I'm a human ability and humanly
[59:49] speaking there's nothing I can do I'm
[59:51] giving it to you God and God will do
[59:55] something about it
[59:57] commit it to God and we'll go through a
[59:59] few of these on committal now believe it
[1:00:01] step on it step out on it claim God's
[1:00:04] promises just committed to God commit
[1:00:07] that waste to the Lord he will bring it
[1:00:09] to pass whatever you want but as long as
[1:00:11] you're holding it and you're saying it's
[1:00:14] mine and I swear now I can see it now
[1:00:17] I'll see if I'm any better now I'll see
[1:00:19] if I can make this work
[1:00:21] see it won't work you committed to him
[1:00:23] and forget about the rest of it and go
[1:00:25] testify on other things you don't even
[1:00:28] see and believe it
[1:00:30] and not what you see it's what you
[1:00:32] believe it's not what you feel he never
[1:00:35] said to you feel it he said do you
[1:00:37] believe it that's how you saved by faith
[1:00:39] that's how you're healed is by faith
[1:00:42] believe it faith is the substance of
[1:00:44] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:00:46] you don't see taste feel smell or hear
[1:00:49] you just believe it and commit it and
[1:00:52] act upon it as if I tell you anything
[1:00:57] and Christ doesn't say that it's so then
[1:01:00] don't believe it
[1:01:01] if I tell you something that he's done
[1:01:02] and he testifies that he that he's done
[1:01:05] it then you believe him is that fair
[1:01:06] enough I'd say any man now the gift
[1:01:08] doesn't heal no one is here that the
[1:01:12] gift doesn't heal no one the gift is not
[1:01:15] for healing no more than a gospel
[1:01:17] preacher is sent for saving he can't
[1:01:20] save anyone
[1:01:21] he can preach under the power to bring
[1:01:25] people to a knowledge of the word of God
[1:01:27] and comforted to their confession and
[1:01:30] God does a saving that's the same thing
[1:01:33] this is he's got a sign he's preaching
[1:01:35] under the power of the breeze conviction
[1:01:37] to human heart they come to the altar by
[1:01:39] faith they accept Jesus and get saved
[1:01:42] and then the results come is that right
[1:01:44] but when we make a committal to God and
[1:01:47] committed to him and believe him then
[1:01:50] the results will come healings the same
[1:01:56] way demonology he talks about committing
[1:02:02] again he said you committed to God he
[1:02:06] spoken his word in my name that shall
[1:02:07] cast out devils nothing shall harm me by
[1:02:10] no means then we're wrapped in the
[1:02:14] bundle of life what other life of God
[1:02:16] ever believer it's just like when you
[1:02:18] receive the Holy Ghost God gives you a
[1:02:20] bankbook and at the bottom of every
[1:02:23] check is got Jesus name signed on him
[1:02:25] just whatever he got need up fill out
[1:02:27] the check send it in he'll make it good
[1:02:30] do you believe that how many believes
[1:02:32] that the pot the deposit was put in the
[1:02:34] bank at Calvary he was wounded for our
[1:02:37] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:02:38] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:02:40] was upon him
[1:02:41] and
[1:02:42] the stripes were healed any of those
[1:02:44] redemptive blessings that belongs to
[1:02:46] every believer if you're scared to fill
[1:02:48] the checkout well it won't do you no
[1:02:49] good but if you'll fill it out and then
[1:02:52] tear it off and put it in your pocket
[1:02:54] it'll never do it no good but tear it
[1:02:57] off and give it to him committed to him
[1:03:01] and watch him take care of it he uses
[1:03:07] this this terminology he said I used to
[1:03:11] have to shift for myself but since I
[1:03:13] found him to be in my fight be my father
[1:03:16] why he does it for me I found out this
[1:03:21] in my 21 years of experience of
[1:03:23] preaching the gospel any job that's too
[1:03:26] big for my Lord to attack what's the use
[1:03:28] of me trying it well he found that out
[1:03:34] in his experiences I feel like it
[1:03:36] probably goes good for me too because
[1:03:40] he'd come up against some pretty big
[1:03:41] stuff you know at one time he came up as
[1:03:45] a of a table float member that started
[1:03:47] the table in the air they wished doctors
[1:03:49] had lifted up and he come and used all
[1:03:51] kind of names on it and he said you know
[1:03:54] the name of the most higher this setting
[1:03:57] the other name of this church something
[1:03:58] different they don't remember all them
[1:04:00] right off the off the bat but trying out
[1:04:01] different names that table never moved
[1:04:03] but he said but I command you in the
[1:04:06] name of the Lord Jesus Christ to come
[1:04:08] down he said it came down so hard like
[1:04:10] too broke off all four legs he said
[1:04:14] that's the power in the name of Jesus
[1:04:15] Christ amen if he would show us there's
[1:04:18] power in the name of Jesus Christ to
[1:04:20] bring a table back to the ground and
[1:04:22] he's and his word enough and concerned
[1:04:24] enough to back up his name when it's
[1:04:26] called upon to bring a table down to the
[1:04:28] ground don't you think that he's still
[1:04:30] concerned enough to call and he's called
[1:04:32] upon in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:33] Christ to bring your cancer down to
[1:04:36] bring your sugar diabetes down and bring
[1:04:38] your blood pressure down to bring
[1:04:39] whatever demon that's oppressing you to
[1:04:41] bring him crashing to the ground that's
[1:04:43] what he's he is committed enough to his
[1:04:45] name
[1:04:46] that he would bring a table down I know
[1:04:49] he's just as committed to his name when
[1:04:51] you call upon the name of the Lord
[1:04:53] Jesus and fever has to leave it and sin
[1:04:56] has to go and depression and fears and
[1:04:59] anxieties at the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:01] has to fall prostrate and come submit to
[1:05:07] the name of Jesus Christ he said when he
[1:05:11] he said when I come something too big
[1:05:14] he said I find anything too big for my
[1:05:17] Lord to attack what's the use of me
[1:05:19] trying it I just give it to him
[1:05:22] committed to him he promised to take
[1:05:25] care of me everyone here tonight he
[1:05:29] promised to take care of you everyone on
[1:05:32] the stream tonight he promised to take
[1:05:34] care of you you said well I ain't got
[1:05:36] nobody to take care of me I'm by myself
[1:05:38] no you're not he promised to take care
[1:05:41] of you and I can tell you one thing
[1:05:43] he'll take care of you better than any
[1:05:45] daddy better than any mama better than
[1:05:47] anybody that around you any kin folks in
[1:05:49] the church he'll take care of you better
[1:05:51] than any brother any friends this God
[1:05:54] has never for suck one of his loved ones
[1:05:56] one of his children a man if a bird came
[1:05:59] fall to the ground and God don't know
[1:06:01] about it God knows when that demons
[1:06:03] attacking you God knows when you're
[1:06:05] going through that thing and at the name
[1:06:06] of Jesus Christ it has to fall when
[1:06:14] opposition comes I committed to him
[1:06:18] because he said he would do it for me
[1:06:20] and if he can't do it I know there's no
[1:06:24] need in me trying it but the problem is
[1:06:28] a lot of us say well I I got this you
[1:06:31] know special in the hour that we're
[1:06:32] living in young people especially put on
[1:06:34] that facade of I'm cool you know I got
[1:06:37] this there's nothing wrong with me you
[1:06:38] asking much nothing I got it you know
[1:06:40] they try to be cool because they afraid
[1:06:41] they show these hurts or these pains it
[1:06:44] would it would make them less cool or
[1:06:45] less strong or less something but listen
[1:06:47] on the inside they're all tore up and
[1:06:50] hamburger meat it out seemed like just
[1:06:52] tore up and went through a grinder and
[1:06:53] spirits were attacking them on means
[1:06:55] anything just be honest and say God I
[1:06:58] ain't got this I don't have it I can't
[1:07:02] handle it I'm giving it to you gotta
[1:07:06] take care of it
[1:07:09] he said that so that feel if I know
[1:07:12] he'll take care of because he said he
[1:07:14] would I know there's no need in me
[1:07:16] trying it so we'd might as well he said
[1:07:18] there's no need in us trying to so he
[1:07:20] might as well to live peaceably and go
[1:07:23] on he will bring it all out right I
[1:07:27] don't to put some step on us as we leave
[1:07:29] tonight we turn off the stream the night
[1:07:31] head I that do we ought to just see them
[1:07:33] you know what I'm just gonna live
[1:07:35] peaceably he's gonna bring it out all
[1:07:37] right he's going to take care of it
[1:07:40] there's no need of getting all fretted
[1:07:42] and stood up about it the Lord knew I
[1:07:47] needed that because these goofy real
[1:07:49] does restrictions they're puttin on us
[1:07:51] about this church I'm excited starting
[1:07:53] to get against my red-blooded American
[1:07:55] male syndrome hey man you know somewhere

[1:08:03] lifted all restrictions

[1:08:18] God sees what's going on and they gonna
[1:08:21] get by with none of it he's just going
[1:08:28] to make it all right I love him for that
[1:08:32] hallelujah I love him for that he says
[1:08:34] you know the doctor may say you can't
[1:08:36] get well but what does God say God said
[1:08:42] I could you know it really God's Word is
[1:08:46] not dependent upon what percentage the
[1:08:48] doctor gives you to live
[1:08:50] it ain't dependent upon if it's a bad
[1:08:53] case of cancer a good case of cancer bad
[1:08:55] huh high blood pressure sugar by
[1:08:57] whatever whatever kind of disease what
[1:08:59] His Word is not dependent upon what the
[1:09:01] doctor's diagnosis is His Word says you
[1:09:05] can therefore I can I will I do believe
[1:09:10] his word said I can so I can His Word
[1:09:14] said I do because I'll do his word said
[1:09:18] I beloved to believe so I believe Amen
[1:09:21] this word that's what we're singing is
[1:09:22] not some man's words some man's decree
[1:09:25] it is God's Word and God said I could if
[1:09:30] you're sick tonight God's Word says he
[1:09:33] can't be healed and he will heal you
[1:09:35] according to his word he's a well I'm
[1:09:44] still sick as I was last night that
[1:09:48] don't make a bit of difference just
[1:09:51] makes you stronger belief be more of a
[1:09:56] miracle tomorrow night if it for me to
[1:09:58] get it said that's what when that's he
[1:10:02] said when you say amen to that he said
[1:10:04] that's Abraham's seed don't stagger at
[1:10:08] the promises of God the doctor did all
[1:10:16] he could do and that's all he can do but
[1:10:20] God hasn't done oh he can do that's
[1:10:26] shouting ground right there and I want
[1:10:29] you to understand when the devil has
[1:10:31] done all he can do that's all he can do
[1:10:34] he has limitations he has limited power
[1:10:37] as we said if he had enough he would
[1:10:39] bring it up but he ain't got enough amen
[1:10:42] but God's got enough and when he moves
[1:10:45] he moves amen when he moves upon that
[1:10:49] cancer that cancers gotta flee when he
[1:10:51] moves when I had blood pressure and he
[1:10:53] moves on those things around and the
[1:10:55] things around this on your body or
[1:10:57] whatever's going on in your mind and
[1:10:59] your spirit when God moves God moves and
[1:11:01] it will flee because God has yet done
[1:11:05] all he can do he still has more
[1:11:08] our it's unlimited mercy he says here
[1:11:26] let me go back any job that's too big
[1:11:33] for God
[1:11:34] I can't tackle I just commit it to him
[1:11:37] and go on he says many times person will
[1:11:42] accept him as their healing that go out
[1:11:44] and aurochs shame to confessing you
[1:11:47] should never be ashamed to confess you
[1:11:50] should never be ashamed of him he said
[1:11:52] my people will never be ashamed you
[1:11:56] should never be ashamed no matter what
[1:11:57] takes place you should be right up in
[1:11:59] front to stand on your testimony for God
[1:12:02] can only save you and heal you as you
[1:12:05] testify you can only hear you as you
[1:12:07] testify he's sitting at the right hand
[1:12:09] of the Father to make intercession upon
[1:12:11] your confession is it isn't how loud you
[1:12:14] cry how hard you beat the altar how many
[1:12:16] good deeds you do it's your faith that
[1:12:18] saves you if you're confessing with your
[1:12:20] lips and coming from your heart he goes
[1:12:22] to work as a high priest sitting on the
[1:12:24] right hand of the Father to make
[1:12:25] intercession upon your confessions
[1:12:27] Hebrews 3:1 he cannot do one thing for
[1:12:30] you until you first believe it accept it
[1:12:33] confess it to be so and the people today
[1:12:36] they go and said well I felt better last
[1:12:38] night but today I'm so bad I just can't
[1:12:40] understand it that's exactly when you
[1:12:42] lose your confession and you drop it and
[1:12:44] no matter who you are how saintly how
[1:12:46] godly if you're a minister clergymen if
[1:12:49] you're a deacon whoever you are it's
[1:12:50] been a Christian for 50 years if you go
[1:12:52] out here tomorrow and lose faith that
[1:12:53] you're Christians start telling people
[1:12:55] you're not a Christian anymore
[1:12:56] you'll backslide he said one only by
[1:12:59] your confession can you be saved that's
[1:13:01] the most powerful weapon that God put in
[1:13:03] the hand of man is committal and accept
[1:13:06] what God has done and it'll do it every
[1:13:10] time
[1:13:13] believe it and stay with it
[1:13:19] hallelujah
[1:13:20] so much here we going down
[1:13:32] hold on me her memory dismisses here too
[1:13:34] good to pass up I got to go back didn't
[1:13:40] get it highlighted to catch my attention
[1:13:42] but I just caught some things here
[1:13:44] he says talking about cancer and how it
[1:13:48] starts developing and sales starts
[1:13:49] growing sometimes you'll hardly know
[1:13:51] it's there and it's moving on sucking
[1:13:53] the blood the doctor he said what if the
[1:13:55] doctor can't get it he said I made
[1:13:58] myself clear
[1:13:59] that I respect doctors in hospitals and
[1:14:03] pray constantly for them what we were
[1:14:05] what would we do without them but I'm
[1:14:07] trying to tell you what the disease is
[1:14:09] he told by there's something behind this
[1:14:11] disease and we I mean brother Brendan
[1:14:13] was one of one that came in and said
[1:14:16] it's not just cancer as the spirit he
[1:14:19] identified it what it was behind it a
[1:14:21] demon and he says God seemed today
[1:14:25] coming that people would walk in
[1:14:28] unbelief like this mercy hisses in 57
[1:14:33] where we had today and with this love he
[1:14:35] let us happen with his love he let us
[1:14:38] have doctors in hospital sure he did
[1:14:41] that's his love gift to you so for you
[1:14:45] that don't believe in doctors there you
[1:14:47] go but the very first thing you should
[1:14:49] have his faith in God that's the first
[1:14:51] thing
[1:14:51] amen so therefore what a doctor will say
[1:14:54] shouldn't shake what your faith says and
[1:14:56] if faith says he heals you if God
[1:14:58] pronounces you to go there ain't enough
[1:15:00] medicine the world to keep you here it's
[1:15:01] all in God's hands don't by leaving the
[1:15:03] world but notice he said this cancer is
[1:15:06] grow and he's sucking your blood and the
[1:15:07] first thing you know you start getting
[1:15:09] weaker and the doctor says I can do no
[1:15:11] more about it you go to God and that's
[1:15:14] God to heal you you make compromises
[1:15:16] that you'll do and when you're doing you
[1:15:18] fill in your heart the prayer of faith
[1:15:19] shall save the sick God said that as the
[1:15:22] prayer of faith is prayed then you feel
[1:15:24] assured now watch right close now ninety
[1:15:27] percent yes 99 out of 100 was hope
[1:15:30] instead of faith he's in the first
[1:15:32] little symptom rise you'll doubt it and
[1:15:37] he goes to show it wasn't god-given
[1:15:39] faith god-given faith won't take no for
[1:15:42] an answer
[1:15:44] Oh hallelujah that's why I said knock
[1:15:48] and keep on knockin seek and keep on
[1:15:50] seeking god-given faith won't take no
[1:15:54] for an answer no matter what is
[1:15:56] happening hallelujah
[1:15:59] you came Bluff at the devil you can
[1:16:01] Bluff him but you got to have the goods
[1:16:03] to prove it he recognized his faith hey
[1:16:06] man don't matter that when you came
[1:16:08] Bluff him you got to have the goods to
[1:16:09] reprove it he recognized faith he has to
[1:16:12] but it's the only weapon we have in our
[1:16:14] hands now what produces faith is prayer
[1:16:17] prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:16:20] suppose say a person comes with a growth
[1:16:22] the growth is prayed for and the shirts
[1:16:25] of the Holy Ghost says it's finished the
[1:16:28] patient goes out and the first thing you
[1:16:30] know they feel better what happens
[1:16:32] anybody knows anybody never hunted a big
[1:16:35] game or a body high starts decaying goes
[1:16:37] through that amen the human body
[1:16:39] shrinking and these sales begin to
[1:16:41] shrink and die first day is shrinking
[1:16:44] the second day is shrinking the Thursday
[1:16:46] third day it begins to swell because
[1:16:48] it's contaminated and it begins to fall
[1:16:50] away he said that's the reason people
[1:16:52] are all stunted about Jesus being in the
[1:16:55] grave three days and nights it was
[1:16:57] within three days and nights because
[1:16:58] David said I'll not leave my soul in
[1:17:01] Hell neither wife suffer my whole One to
[1:17:03] see corruption upon that solemn promise
[1:17:05] jesus said you destroy this temple I'll
[1:17:08] raise it up in three days he knew that
[1:17:10] no sale could corrupt that not one cell
[1:17:13] could grew up with some time within the
[1:17:15] 72 hour time frame God would raise him
[1:17:18] up for the profit it said so so you see
[1:17:20] when they cells begin to break and it
[1:17:22] begins to come the next day they come
[1:17:24] back testify and all I can see better a
[1:17:26] cataract I can see better tumors go I
[1:17:29] can feel better
[1:17:30] well what happened starts getting worse
[1:17:32] worse all of us said oh well praise God
[1:17:35] I guess I lost my healing I'm so sick I
[1:17:37] can't stand up I lost my healing he said
[1:17:40] all you poor excuse that's the best sign
[1:17:44] in the world
[1:17:45] you've got your healing what is it the
[1:17:49] death growth in you is breaking up as a
[1:17:52] heartbeat it pulls the blood and it
[1:17:54] purifies the body and the third day
[1:17:56] usually have sickness and fever that
[1:17:59] dead growth is laying on you rotten and
[1:18:01] away he said what is it healing is in
[1:18:03] the body don't give up keep confessing
[1:18:08] he's my healer hallelujah but it goes on
[1:18:11] down he says see a many if
[1:18:14] sickness is a blessing become bi people
[1:18:16] told my sickness is the curse of God
[1:18:19] upon you in this setting the other he
[1:18:20] said if sickness is a blessing and Jesus
[1:18:23] came to heal the sick everywhere then he
[1:18:25] defeated his healing and purpose in
[1:18:27] coming which would you say would be a
[1:18:29] blessing if a loving God or a father who
[1:18:32] give life or promised you a long life on
[1:18:34] the earth and you'd obey Him you come
[1:18:36] and strike you down with a devil and let
[1:18:38] him lay there on you and eat you up with
[1:18:40] a bed and cancer TP oh this is God this
[1:18:43] is God's love to me or would you rather
[1:18:45] say the devil struck me down and a
[1:18:48] loving God just come to heal me
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:52] hallelujah the loving God has come to
[1:18:54] heal me and give me life again
[1:18:56] Jesus never did tell his disciples never
[1:18:59] preach that anywhere or ask the
[1:19:01] disciples to go tell people they must
[1:19:03] stay pinned down with sickness to obey
[1:19:05] Him come on now you don't have to stay
[1:19:09] pinned down with that devil hallelujah
[1:19:14] somebody's been pinned down with
[1:19:15] bitterness or pinned down with this or
[1:19:17] pinned down with unforgettable and to be
[1:19:19] pinned down with some unforgiving spirit
[1:19:21] it's time to you rebelled against that
[1:19:23] thing it's I'm a God cold son and I'm
[1:19:26] not going to bow to you but I'm gonna
[1:19:28] submit myself to Jesus Christ people get
[1:19:33] pinned down by depression and pinned
[1:19:35] down by every kind of spirit and he'll
[1:19:37] listen there's a power to cast that
[1:19:40] thing out there's a power in the name of
[1:19:43] Jesus Christ that every demon will leave
[1:19:45] trembling how do you he didn't teach
[1:19:51] them he didn't go around teaching or
[1:19:53] have him preached they had to stay
[1:19:55] pinned down with sickness to obey him he
[1:19:58] sent them to liberate them sickness
[1:20:01] hallelujah to liberate them from
[1:20:03] sickness and to preach to those that are
[1:20:06] in captivity and those are in bondage he
[1:20:09] come to bring deliver
[1:20:13] he's got to be either the author of life
[1:20:16] or the author of death if you put
[1:20:20] sickness on God and say God is making
[1:20:22] you sick to die then you got to make him
[1:20:24] the author of death when death and life
[1:20:27] can associate together mercy he goes on
[1:20:36] many places we're bringing us down he
[1:20:42] said if we commit everything anything to
[1:20:44] God and believe it like our children or
[1:20:47] whatever more let's believe that God
[1:20:51] will answer that prayer the day before I
[1:20:56] left to go away the phone constantly the
[1:20:58] ring and mothers with their children
[1:20:59] saying I pray for the pray for them pray
[1:21:01] for them I said just commit them to God
[1:21:05] that's all you have to do don't put your
[1:21:10] hands on it anymore
[1:21:11] let God have it if you're going to do
[1:21:15] something about it then God will stand
[1:21:17] back and let you go ahead until you're
[1:21:20] finally finished but when you commit it
[1:21:23] to God and let him have it he will do it
[1:21:27] you just believe him just stand back
[1:21:30] don't work just believe oh ma there's so
[1:21:34] many wonderful things here I know I
[1:21:36] can't get to a mall there's last one as
[1:21:40] we bring this musicians could come
[1:21:43] committing submitting committing and
[1:21:48] yielding to God see I think of our
[1:21:53] sister sitting here to help trouble on
[1:21:56] that crunch how much power that God can
[1:21:59] give you to move up with strength and
[1:22:02] faith to lay that crunch down and walk
[1:22:05] away without it he's I sing that little
[1:22:09] Georgie Carter with her little limp
[1:22:10] looking much bigger than a broomstick
[1:22:12] been laying there nine years and eight
[1:22:15] months couldn't move they'd put a draw
[1:22:20] sheet under couldn't even get good put a
[1:22:22] bad pan under
[1:22:24] but when the power of God struck that
[1:22:26] girl out of that she'd come run
[1:22:30] down to that organ and play Jesus keep
[1:22:33] me near the cross and she's living today

[1:23:35] of God
