because he paid the ultimate sacrifice let's just go to him in prayer before we turn to the lord this evening father well that's the anthem of our heart tonight as we're going all the way and we know father there may be times the enemy tries to block the blessing from us and keep us from being what you've called us to be but lord that song just resonates in our soul tonight we're going all the way lord father i remember a time where they do a line in the sand at the alamo and god it was a line of declaration you cross that line if you're going to stay in the fight with me and father we've drawn that line in the sand tonight we're crossing over lord and we're making a declaration father we're not backing up god we're not bending we're not bowed we're not breaking but father we're just drawing the line and we're determined we're going to go all the way father we just asked that you'd come and speak to us this evening lord you'll take the lips of clay father and you speak through them lord you'll take the ears of clay father and you'll hear through them and receive lord we just yield ourselves to you right now in this very moment father [Music] god i just i surrender my gift to you lord that you can use it for the blessing of your people god we just give it to you this service father communion service time of fellowship god we just ask that you just have complete control and preeminence now but we ask it in jesus name amen if you have your bibles tonight we're going to look here in the book of ruth and i want to speak to you on a thought tonight on communion acquired through redemption communion acquired through redemption we look here in ruth verse 1 or chapter 1 and verse one we'll read down through verse six and i'm going to kind of i've read this book of ruth probably several times four to five times this week alone and just gonna be pulling a lot out of it today with the help of the lord but we know that this is communion service i don't want to hold you too long because we have uh another aspect of the service this evening but it says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judea judah went to sojourn in a country of moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife was naomi the name of his two sons with maelon and chileon ephrathites of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and continued there and elimalex naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of moab and the name of one was orpah and the name of the other was ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years and maelon and chilion died also both of them and the women was left or the woman was left and her two sons and her husband then arose then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people and giving them bread you can have your seats this evening so like i said we want to speak to you this evening on communion acquire through redemption this word communion was going to take it from a different angle and not so much as we take our communion the lord's supper tonight but a different look at it but the word communion here means the sharing or the exchanging of intimate thoughts and feelings the sharing or exchanging of intimate thoughts and feelings and the word intimate means private and personal so i want you to think about communion as the sharing of private and personal thoughts and feelings and the word acquired here means to get as one's own to obtain gained by the result of an effort or an experience and augustine would say that the word communion comes from two words one being calm which means with and together and the other being eunice which is oneness in union so we can see that communion can mean with oneness or a together union otherwise it solidifies solidarity it means that we become one and by this relationship we're sharing intimate thoughts and we're sharing intimate feelings and the prophet of god would tell us that many will proclaim the book of root to be just a love story but he said it's more than a love story it's a prophet not only is it a prophet but it's a history and it's a love story and it's it's not only a love story or a history or a prophet it's god himself because in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god he said now but he goes that ought to sell it brethren god on print jehovah printed on a book he says now this book of ruth was one of the most outstanding books that they have accepted why it's because it's just he goes why if it's just a love story why would the writers or the ancient sages accept the book as inspire he says because there's a hidden revelation in it so in the book of ruth we want to understand that it's more than a love story but there is a hidden revelation in it and it's hidden he says it's a hidden revelation he goes you catch the real meaning and it'll bring you real close to god so you catch the real meaning of the book of ruth and we find the prophet of god will tell us he says now we find in the book of ruth we hear about the kinsmen redeemer and we know that to redeem us to bring back anything that was lost he says but in the law of redemption and israel there had to be a kinsmen to redeem a property of somebody that had been lost and there was requirement for the kinsmen redeemer the requirements meant he had to be ken or he had to be close ken he said he couldn't be a way off kinsmen and he also had to be financially able and he must make a public testimony so we think about naomi and we think about her family and the name naomi means pleasant in elimelech his name means worship so we found when they were in bethlehem judah they had pleasant worship but we find there came a famine in the land and the prophet of god would tell us the first mistake a jew ever makes is when he leaves the land see god gave them that land when abraham was given the land god told them not to leave the land and he made a mistake when he went down to guerrer he got into trouble he says a jew is never to leave palestine he says that's his lotted place and it was a it was a mistake that elimelech made when his family left the land of bethlehem to go down and search for bread and we find as they left the promised land their days got darker and darker and darker until he died and not only him but his sons died and now there's three graves in the land of moab three graves because they were in search for something that was not there they left where it was at and we find that naomi who means pleasant no longer was she considered pleasant now her laughter and her hope had left and now she becomes sad but this ef this effect or this incident with the losing of her husband and the losing of her children what this does it begin to put a drive in her life to get back to the land where she was born to get back to the land where she had her early childhood to get back to the place where she was early married where they when she drank of the well of bethlehem and where life was a blessing and he didn't have all the hardships he didn't have all the difficulties he didn't have all the loneliness and brother madam would tell us and juan had to be shepherds he said bethlehem means the house of god's bread so we find here her husband leaves the house of god's bread in search for bread but only to find disaster and destruction and brother branham would tell us or the bible would tell us in john 6 35 jesus said unto them i am the bread of life so when we think of bread we immediately think of life we think of the substance to sustain life and when you find if you've done any reading or any kind of historical search of what happened to the jews there in the world in the 1940s underneath the persecution of the the germans there they longed for bread they long just a little morsel of bread helped sustain them and it was black bread hard bread but i say that to say that bread was the essence of life and today bread is our essence of life but we're not longing for what we had back there just about an hour ago but we're longing for the spiritual bread and jesus would come until he goes i am that bread that comes down out of god from out of heaven that if you hunger and you partake of this bread you'll never hunger and thirst again he goes i am the bread of life your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness but they are dead and verse 51 he says i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh so as we partake of the communion tonight we're partaking in symbolic his life him giving us life transferring our dead sins and allowing us to come into life now he said bethlehem was a place of the bread of the nation it was the bread of all the house of israel that come from there he was the bread of life that come down from heaven the spiritual man has to come from bethlehem the bread line the place where bread laid see but they left the promised land and no matter how bad it was to sojourn over in another land brought trouble now young people the prophet of god will tell you if any christian ever gets off on those grounds well i'll just i'll go down tonight with the boys to the pool hall and it'll do no harm i'll just take a little drink you take that little drink and doesn't think it's going to cause you any harm but you're out of the promised land you're off the grounds that god entitled you to be on and you may think you can stay there elimelech only intended to stay until the famine was over but his family was there for 10 years 10 long trying grueling years she was left there without a husband she was left there without children because of a mistake that her husband made because he didn't think that it was gonna hurt but we found what did it do it caused death it caused destruction he says you're only setting a course for trouble oh the little rest of the girl smoke i'll just try one he goes you're off your grounds don't do that stay in the homeland oh well everybody over here they'll call me old folky they'll call me old-fashioned he says stay there anyhow that's your place stay in christ so let me encourage you young people as we heard last night pretending to give all we heard a marvelous message last night no longer should we pretend to give off stay where god has ordained you to blossom stay where he's ordained you to be blessed stay where he's ordained you to grow and that you could be a blessing in the promised land you don't have to go out into the world we got everything that we have need of right here under this roof under this ministry under this message we don't need to go searching for happiness happiness is right here we don't need to go searching for joy we have joy unspeakable and full of glory we don't need to go to the doctrine and i'm all about going to the doctor but we got healing right here everything we have need of is right here in the homeland of the word where there's life we finally in ruth one and verse six she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people and giving them bread she began to hear rumors of what was taking place down in that church she began to hear rumors what was going on there was life in that church there was life back in the homeland there's life again and she begins to hear this and notice and when she heard that there was life down there something began to pull upon her heart no i didn't the desire to stay in moab it waned it left pretty quick because now she realized it's not been easy in moab and your life won't be easy outside the promised land of this word oh you may have good days but you'll have a lot more bad days and good days there begin to be a pull a better be a drive to bring her back to the homeland and it's something when it's something to me how when your life is in a struggle but yet god places a desire he places something so deep inside of you and it's the desire to live it's a desire to seek out life it will drive some people to endure extremely difficult situations the desire to live the desire and why are you here tonight because there's there is a desire in your heart to live there's a desire in your heart tonight to to move forward and we find here moab notice she was in moab and the prophet of god will tell us moab represented the nicolaitans it was carnal christianity many of them fine speakers doctors of philosophy and great men we heard about it this morning men that use psychology he says you can't deny that but they have a form of godliness but they deny the power they deny the life that's in bethlehem they think they can do it with all their psychology all their intellectual understanding you know brother tim made that statement this morning about these great men and their great intellectual understanding i begin to look at my life and be saying thank god you're not intelligent that's one time that you just can't thank god for because you're not you're not using or you're not you're not depending on your own human ability when you step behind this desk because you have no enticing words you have no intellectual things to give to people but what you're depending on is the anointing you're depending on the life that was in bethlehem because i've partaken of that bread and now that bread comes inside of us as a believer and what does it do it begins to produce life that's why you're here you're in search for life tonight and god has brought you here because god is having his desire within his own heart to have communion and fellowship with his creation we find people today they hear that there's bread in bethlehem oh there's bread at this church there's bread at that church there's life they're willing to leave the dead lifeless lands that they've been dwelling in because there's a desire to live when they hear that there's freedom of worship freedom to praise the living god that there's life not only for the older generation but also for the young generation i was speaking to a baptist minister or not a minister but a baptist gentleman the other day last week sometime and i did a job for him and we were he was just telling he goes to the first baptist church there in sibley he said it used to be 150 people in that church i said well we got about 60 young people from the age of 13 and up and he says oh my he goes we used to have that but it dried up land's dried up oh church how blessed are we the lands aren't drying up no there's reports of different ones wanting to move here but why because they hear that there's life being given and even like tabernacle now we don't owe it to ourselves as men know but god is pouring out his life god is the one that visits our services that's why we can have convention style meetings on a wednesday night or per adventure on a saturday night in a youth service when the after call is given every seat become empty and every young person was at the altar why because god is once again visiting his people by giving them bread by giving them life oh but he's not only giving life for this life but he's giving you for the life thereafter he's giving you eternal life they're willing to leave the land of moab and relocate to where life is being served why are you here some of you why are you here you heard now you've come and you've tasted it you've tasted you've experienced service after service the giver of life comes by and he's handing out exactly what you have need of sister landed he handed you life since the mirah he handed you life drew he handed you life over and over and over and over and over he's been handing servant up breath life substance for your existence now we find here people are willing to move to where the lord has once again visited his people by giving them spiritual food in due season we're not depending brother tim on dr dobson or any of these other great if you want to call it that great denominational preachers who uses psychology and look intellectual understanding but no god has once again visited his ministry god has once again visited those who seek him daily who are behind the closed doors behind the veil and they get into a relationship and they have communion with god and that word communion means to be able to speak back and forth with and that's what he desires tonight more than you just coming up and for taking another bread another wine he wants to have that back and forth relationship where he can bring you into a state of communion maybe tonight you're far off but you don't have to remain there you don't have to pretend anymore as we heard last night no you can go all the way tonight you don't have to just stop and turn around and go back no you can keep going forward and god's going to give you a land god's gonna bless you once you arrive in that homeland you've got a promise of the holy ghost you've got a promise of healing deliverance whatever it is there it is it's in the land as we heard this morning everything that we have need of in this journey is already in you even the rapture i tell you we should be the most excited people the most happy people and they want you to shut up they want you to not be emotional when they realize on the inside of me who i was in once in darkness but now i've been made light-wise because i've entered in into a land that's serving up bread and serving up life i got a reason to shout you got a reason to rejoice tonight because you're no longer in moab church you're on your way to bethlehem and there's life there brother tim could easily easily brother timothy brother aaron myself we could easily stop preaching that way we're preaching if we're only going to be dictated at what men say about the ministry well did you hear what they'd done down there in bethlehem how they acted man i heard how one girl she just ran around the church if we're worried about what man thinks of as sure but i'm not in fellowship or communion with man i'm in communion with him and that's not my word that i want to bring to you it's his word and that's what the ministry is for is to bring his word to the people notice in ruth 1 verse 8 and naomi said unto her two daughters well let's go down to verse 11 excuse me naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have a husband and if i should say i have hope if i should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons would you tarry for them until they were grown would you stay for them for having husbands nay my daughters for it grieve with me much for your sake that the hand of the lord is going against or out against me in verse 14. and they lifted up their voice and they wept again and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but ruth clave unto her now brother madam would tell us in the message kinsmen redeemer he said now oprah is a type of the lukewarm church that once started a type of the church that won't go all the way otherwise the pretender oh they looked apart you know they they have their hair long but they know maybe they trim the ends a little bit here and a little bit there they don't do the makeup when they're at church but they do it other places you know they looked apart but when it comes to really going all the way when it comes to really surrendering all when it really comes to serving god and getting where life is being served up i i just don't know it's a strange land i'm not sure what's down there you know all i can go by is hear say and notice what the prophet of god would say says she kissed her mother-in-law and returned back again he says that's the type of the lukewarm believer who will believe jesus to be christ and then turn around and go back into the thing that they come out of and you wonder why so many have left the ranks of the message because they wasn't there wasn't a root there was an opera they started out but when the road got tough when they didn't know what was down that was that they were headed toward you find they turned around and they gave up and they went right back to the thing they come out of the first thing that the ladies do is whack off their hair put on their makeup put on their pants they come they go right back to the thing that they come out of see otherwise oprah was a type of the believer that pretends to give all only to return back they want the title of being a christian but not go all the way to do what's necessary to be born again she turned back to our gods many times we returned back to the gods of our beginning maybe we got eyes of lust after the wrong thing we'll turn back to lusting again maybe we're we got idols and drinking and idols of smoking and idols of lion idols are stealing all those kind of idols and then profess to be baptized and then turn again what a sad thing he says you remember it never spoke her name no more she was excommunicated because of her decision she turned her back to go back to the things that she come out of but ruth oh i pray there's a ruth here tonight but root the type of the believer now when she comes out the person of the world he comes in amongst the christian believers women that used to smoke drink play cards at societies and so forth all kinds of fancy stuff like some kind of frizzled up bird but now she changed she made a decision to go with god and the brother baby say when i accepted christ i was turned out by my own home when i accepted christ my boyfriends and girlfriends everybody throw me down i went with a bunch of old people that had the holy ghost and believed in god serving him the girls that was down there in church were different than the ones that i used to be going with they looked different they acted different they were strange and i was scared of them but they were different people he said ruth had to make her decision and you got to make your decision you got to make your decision tonight you'll never walk out these doors this morning without some kind of decision you'll not leave this room today either being a better man or woman or worse man or woman to reject it listen young person especially you that's on the fence to reject it you'll be worse he said it's harder the next time for you to get in or you'll go out better he said it come to a showdown in her life and it comes to a showdown in everybody's life and when we think about communion the act of communion that we're going to partake of tonight communion service is always a real strict one he said because it brings us to a showdown so when you come to the table tonight to partake it's a showdown you're making your decision known when you partake of the body and you partake of the wine and you partake of the bread and what you're saying is i've given i've yielded my life i've made my decision i'm going all the way i'm not living a halfway hypocritical pretending life but no i've made my declaration i've become a root i'm gonna make my stand tonight and i'm partaking of that life because the bible also says that if you eat it and drink it unworthily then you eat it and drink damnation to your own self so we got to examine our lives but god brings us to the communion as a reminder of redemption it wasn't that they left the land of egypt that he's saying do this and remember to me he's saying do this and remember to me ma this bread represents my body he broke it and he handed it out to his disciples showing that he is the same today breaking of himself and handing it to each and every one of you and says do this in remembrance of me partake of it in remembrance this is my cup my cup my blood i've yielded i poured it out i emptied my life out so that you can be a partaker do this in remembrance of me and remember to what in remembrance that i played the part of the kinsmen redeemer and i did it to bring you into communion i did it to bring you into fellowship i did it to more than just have a conversation with you but that we can share intimate thoughts intimate feelings now notice fruit in verse 16 and ruth said entreat me not to leave or to return from following after thee for wither thou goest i will go whether thou lie just our laws thy people shall be my people and thy god will be my god for thou dost i will die where thou will be buried that the lord do so to me and more if i ought but death part thee and me notice the heart of a true believer where you go i'm going i'm going all the way where you lodge i'm lodging your people they may be strange but they'll be my people your god i don't know him right now but he'll be my god where you die i promise i'll die there with you they'll bury me beside you and this is a desire that we each have to have tonight because it can't be based on somebody else's religion but that god that was hers had to become roots god she had to know god for herself and you've got to know god for yourself and where she goes you go and where he is you are and if it's in the church if it's out of the church wherever you go you don't take a vacation from god wherever god is that's where we want to be wherever the holy spirit is pouring being poured out that's where we want to be where the life of the word is being delivered that's where we want to be your god will be my god if it makes me run that's okay i'll run with you god if it makes me shout i'll shout amen lord because what i want i want to be found faithful to the house of god ruth said i'll go where you go your people will be my people your god will be my god where you live i'll live will you die i'll die where you're buried i'll be buried that's the real decision lord i'll take you as my savior if the bible says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ that i'll do if the bible says i must receive the holy ghost that i'll do if the bible tells me that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that i will believe he goes i'll take the bible and god for what he's wrote and what he is no matter what anybody else says see she made her decision she either had to go back or go forward and you're coming tonight to the communion you're either going to go back or you're going to go forward and the only one can make that decision is you as much as i would brother tim timothy brother aaron any of us ministers mom and dad as much as we would want to make the decision for our children we can't you have to make your own decision i will say tonight needs to be the time that you say wherever you go i'll go whatever you do i'll do if it means leaving the world i'm leaving the world if it means being filled with the holy ghost i want to be filled with the holy ghost if it means believing for the supernatural i want to believe tonight if it means believing against all odds against impossibilities i want to believe that god still does impossible math see she made her decision she was converted and he said you got to make your decision and you got to take your choice you won't go back to the things of the world or you want to he goes or you want to go on with god you got to make your decision back to the world or go on with god you want to act like the world the rest of them then kiss christ could buy and go back but if you want to take the way with the lord's despised you hold on to god's unchanging hand regardless of what the rest of the world had to say hold right there notice she made a clean cut decision and that's what brother aaron i believe he was trying to get to you young people last night you got to make a clean cut decision you got to quit playing quit pretending quit having one foot in and one foot out now make a clean cut decision i remember the night that i made my clean cut decision and i've not been the same i will tell you god will not disappoint you young person if you make that clean cut decision i'm going all the way where you go i'll go see they came notice they they began to come back naomi and ruth came just at the barley season barley season was the bread season the season where fresh bread was being served up and the church in the last days had been through throughout 2 000 years of pagan teaching and things and has come in the barley season notice the harvest time that's where we are church we've done been through six church ages now we're at the end of the seventh church age we're at the time of the harvest we're not in the planting stage we're at the harvest stage you don't have many more days left we don't have many more days left but what we do find was there being fresh bread is being served up in bethlehem and that's what's happening even in like tabernacle fresh bread is being served up and for some of you it makes you shout some of you it makes you dance in the spirit you get a bite of that bread with a little bit of honey and butter on it oh my you don't know how you'll act i like some tomato gravy and biscuits i wonder maybe maybe they got some of that down there in that land but it's fresh bread no matter what kind of bread you make out of it it's fresh bread because you may not like wheat bread you may not like biscuit but it doesn't matter it's fresh bread and it makes it to your liking all you got to do is go down there and say lord i want a bite i want a service of some fresh manna tonight lord i need something from you tonight and it may make you run it may make you shout it may make you speak in tongue it may make you prophesy but it doesn't matter what it makes you it's being poured out and even like tamara god has visited his people one more time he's come on the scene at the harvest season to tell you a young person and to tell you mom and dad i'm here i'm still god and i got it in control tonight and i'm pouring out fresh manna all you got to do is get into the land and partake of it fresh bread is being served up and you think you hear about mistake ruth two and verse two and root the more body is sent unto them let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him whose sight i shall find grace and she went and she came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap or she happened to light on the part of the field that belonged to boaz who was the kindred of elimelech and behold boaz came from bethlehem and he said unto the reapers the lord be with you and they answered him the lord blessed thee then said boaz unto the servant that was said over the reapers whose damsel is this i want you to see the parallel church it's got to be more than a story there's a hidden revelation that's tied into this book of ruth and the servant was set over the reapers and he answered and he said it is the moabitess damsel that came back when they owe me out of the country of moab and she said i pray you let me glean and after and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and had continued even from the morning until now and she tarried little in the house then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens notice boaz first spoke to ruth she didn't approach him but he approached her she would not dare approach him here she was an alien from a strange land and him being the lord of the harvest but yet he takes a break from speaking to his servants to the reapers and he addresses her see he interrupts his conversation with the foreman to speak to poor uh poor stranger gleaning in his field and notice he invites her to glean in his field the entire harvest brother braham says now boaz found her out in the field and he said who are you and she said my name is ruth oh the moabite that came to sojourn with us yes he goes i've heard of you you don't go into another field i like that come on church you don't got to go church hopping and field hopping tonight you don't have to do that to life no you can rest in the field that you landed in let me just tell you it wasn't by mistake that that roof landed in the field of boat she was led by the spirit of god it was a predestinated moment and god has predestinated you to be here you're not just in any field but you're in the field of the lord of the harvest he brought you here why because he's got something special for you he's got a greater desire what does he want to do he wants to bring you into a state of communion he wants to bring you into a relationship with him he goes i heard of you you don't go into another field i like that don't start mission trotting i do some of you some good especially when you get hurt in church and you want to go jump to the next church thank god there ain't an ain't another field close by you laugh you'd be there only to come back because you realize god led you to this field god's got something for you in this field notice stay right here in my field stay with my notice he said he loved her when his eyes saw the moabite the gentile the alien someone from another country noticed boaz was never married and he was an older gentleman but when his eyes saw that moabite out there gleaning in his field something struck his heart oh let me tell you you know what it was it was love at first sight and when our heavenly father saw you down there gleaning in the field realize you were there and you were gleaning for life you were hunger for life out of that denomination but god led you from that and he brought you to the field of the message for what to give you life you couldn't stay there brother l and what does he tell you don't go glean in another field you don't have to leave this word to go out there to the word of psychology or the word of badness or the word of denomination you can stay right here in the field he loved her stay with me don't go running around from place to place stay here oh i love that he says now while she was gleaning in the field directed by the holy ghost to go into the field to glean then up come boaz boaz was the representative of christ for he was the lord of the harvest he was over all the harvest and notice as soon as he looked out in the field and saw that gentile girl he fell in love with her come on young boys you know what it is when your eyes fall upon the beauty of that girl and your heart starts to beat out of your chest you know hey don't play dumb brothel you better say yeah felicia will get you but you know what it's like man his heart started racing oh my something he looked at it none of the other girls struck him the way she struck him down through the ages this one struck him at harvest season this is the one notice brother brown says when a man loves a woman and he marries her because she's just pretty he goes there'll be an end to that and don't you brother say amen that is not the appropriate time no sir not unless you want to have a bad communion he says but when a man finds a woman that he loves now here you go brother hale this is for you that he loves he don't know why but he loves her all right i got an amen in the back can i get another he says that's an eternal mate in glory see death nor nothing else can ever separate them because why they are from eternity they stepped into space of time and were returned back into eternity attorney has dropped down into the body called time then it goes right back into eternity again it cannot perish he said a woman that's beautiful that beauty will fade just as sure but did you know that that well-formed little figure that god had given that girl may be rotten by this time next sunday that tall dark handsome man may be nothing but just a pile of rubbish by next sunday that all perishes but that on the inside god love lives for eternity and notice he didn't know why he loved her but when he saw her out there gleaning in the field he loved her oh i hope you can see that god doesn't know maybe he didn't know why he fell in love with you but he did and maybe you question lord are you sure i'm just a gentile i'm just a moabite i'm just this i'm just that i measure up i got faults i got wings but he loves you he loves you and the lord of the harvest fell in love with her her being an alien he's oh what a picture he says don't leave this field he fell in love with her he said brother why don't you keep saying that because i'm trying to get to somebody he fell in love with you and if he ever fell in love with you he never falls out of love with you if he ever falls in love with you he never falls out of love with you he said don't leave the field stay put don't be tossed about on every win the doctrine stay in the word he fell in love with her and he commanded her not to leave the field but stay right there and glean fastly see ruth a beautiful woman went out into the field a boy asked to glean with all the other peasants she'd been a type of the gentile bride he said she went out behind the harvesters to pick up a few straws but when his eyes cast upon her he fell in love with her christ with his church and he says whose damsel is this notice she found grace in his sight in you tonight with all your all of that because we all have it he loves you anyway he loves you anyway all your indifference all your quirks all your little yeah we all have it but he loves you anyway and the brother of them says now that's what the church does today while the lord of the harvest is going by he ain't looking for big big buildings big steeples well-trained choirs he's looking for an individual men and women who are dedicated and made a clear-cut decision for christ consecrated himself to his service god i believe it every word when your word says anything i say right there that's your word i believe in every word that's what he's looking for the lord of the harvest that's what he wants to do is give the holy spirit to those who are hungering and thirsting for life see god led you to this church god led you to the message of the hour because the bible says sons of god are led by the spirit and god's sovereign plan is working to your good and you may be an alien you may be in a strange land but you're and you may be gleaning in a stranger's field but god has bigger plans for you you're not going to always be a beggar you're not going to always be a gleaner and a few short sunsets you're going to be the one who owns the field he led you here he led you here for the purpose of communion because he wants to express his great desire for you he wants to express deeper feelings than just a conversation in the field god has a purpose but that purpose can only be fulfilled through the act of redemption and we'll get into that as we go just a few more minutes i know we we have communion here but i want to just try to get to this point so he led you here for a purpose and we are here today believing the message gleaning in the lord's field because we have been predestinated god doesn't make mistakes you're not here by mistake do you think you just happened to be at evening like tabernacle on a sunday no god led you here because god's got something in the field for you he's got greater plans no matter what you face no matter how difficult life becomes there's something inside of you driving you to stay in the field stay in the field stay in the field otherwise some of you had already left stay in the field no matter what i go through stay in the field no matter what i've done god what did he do he deposited a seed on the inside that sea gene of life and that that seed is hungering for life and it's got to get where life is being poured out that's why you couldn't stay in your denominational system brother hale that's why the enticements of the world couldn't hold some of you young boys some of you grown-ups tonight because there was something that you didn't know what was there but god placed it there before the foundation of the world and when when you begin to hear about man there's something happening there's something god there's there's there's a better life than the life that i'm living there's a there's really a life down there and you begin to hunger after it see the seed of god begins to long for communion with its maker and it drives you and it guides you into the field of boaz because god has got something greater for you we know that the bible tells us that all things work together brother andy all the hardships they're working together all the bruises and bumps along live's highway they're working together to get you to the right field because there's something happening in that field notice she found grace in his sight the lord of the harvest the man who owned the field took notice of her all these other damsels out there gleaning but he only took notice of one he's seen your labors he's watched you glean and he asked you don't go into another harvest or another field stay right here stay in my field notice what he does when you when you get in his field route 2 and verse 15. and when he was risen up to or when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the she's and reproach her not to glean among the she's this was a privilege because no person should glean till the shees were all bound and a shot crawl set up otherwise he was telling his disciples or his ministers let her glean with those best ears of corn flour glean where it's heaped up because the word chief means heaped up let her glean where the best corn is let her let her glean where there's been a reaction and there's something falling and it's falling and multiple so where she doesn't have to work so hard to get it notice what he says now he says and let fall off so some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not and i love what the what brother adam says now he says now here she is gleaning for life and he goes i want you reapers you angels in other words that's what that's what they are i want you angels new reapers every once in a while drop a handful on purpose don't let it be so tiresome for her you know church shouldn't be so tiresome for your church because what is he doing he's coming by dropping him for his own purpose he says every once in a while drop a hand full on purpose he goes let her hear a good message let it let a good power of the holy spirit cover over every once in a while and let her know that i'm still here do something out of healing amongst her some kind of sign or wonder that she'll know that i'm still in her midst oh that's what he's done and even like tabernacle he's combined he's dropped hand bulls on purpose here he comes and he he dropped you a handful saying i'm el shaddai the seed of the promise is mocked i'm el shaddai i'm filling every fiber i'm out shady eye and we find here he's he's circumcised without hands he's dropping handfuls and handfuls on purpose and we hear messages like the light who can't contend being led to victory the light the promise keeper he never left me pretending to give all god does impossible what is he doing he comes service after service and he drops you a handful and he drops you a handful and he drops you a handful and he drops you a handful because he don't want him to be so tired he wants you to enjoy coming to the field you enjoy reaping and cleaning because well he's got something for you he's got an attraction to your church he's dropping him why is other people coming because they heard about the handful they heard about the handfuls there's healing there's deliverance there's holy ghost there's prayer lines there's altar calls there's a movement though the spirit there's tongues there's interpretation what is it a handful after a handful after a handful he's dropping it this was more than just sympathy for the poor no he had took notice he was doing something special something out of character but it was in character for him because now he's in love oh my my my my if you can see this revelation why has he come service after service because he's in love he's in love you know what we can fall out of love but he doesn't he's in love and the bible says when you're not faithful he remains faithful he's faithful because he loves you he's going to show up every service and he's going to drop you a handful on purpose now you ruth you gotta glean you you gotta go pick it up you gotta beat the chef out of it you gotta do your part and what notice what she did when she took and she gleaned she took it back to her mother-in-law and when her mother-in-law saw where she'd been or saw all this because she should have never gleaned that much she said my daughter where whose field did you glean in and she said the man that i gleaned today his name is boaz that changed the entire picture for now because naomi knew that was a near kinsman oh what am i telling you church you didn't just happen to light in this field god led you to this field because this is the field that is owned by our kinsmen redeemer jesus christ became sin oh he was no sin but he became sin so that he could play the part of the kinsmen redeemer to preach oh hallelujah i'm sorry church but i'm excited to bring you into a place of communion where god can pour out his heart god can pour out his life god can pour out his healing god can pour out his love that's why he brought you here he brought you to this field for a purpose where if you glean to feel the bow ass notice what our mother-in-law says now daughter the harvest is over and boaz is going to be down at the threshing floor and when you get down there i want you to go down there i want you first i want you to i want you to make yourself ready wash thyself how do you do it by the washing of the water of the word wash yourself allow yourself to be cleansed allow yourself all those indifferences and just wash yourself all the complexes wash yourself for all the grudges all those little things right there they're trying to drive malice and strife and divide homes and divide this church wash yourself for that notice and anoint them oh yeah let the holy ghost come on and anoint you anointing she says and put on the raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until until he shall have done eating and drinking and noticing she went down onto the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bathed and when boaz was had eaten and drunk and his heart was married he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came past midnight and the man was afraid that we're being startled and he turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thy handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid for thou art are near kinsmen see she laid at boaz's feet not his head she was not to lord over boaz but she was humbling herself to his feet and brother brandon would say like this he says she laid at the feet of boaz and when he woke up he seen the confidence oh he goes my one of these days he will see the confidence that his church has got in him that's why we're here because we have confidence in him we have confidence in this ministry we have confidence in this message that's why you're here because now we're no longer at the field now we're at his feet he had taken his own robe the holy spirit and he spread it over her and we find here now brother brown tells us she said mark the place where he lies and when he lie down to sleep rest he goes you go lie down at his feet not his head for he is worthy and you're unworthy but take the blanket that he has covered and pull it over you you see oh my gosh i know that made think i'm a fanatic but see it just suits me that way mark where he lay at calvary where he laid down in the tomb of gethsemane mark and crawl up to his feet and lie down there and die yourself there you are cover yourself over with his skirt and we find that this word or this phrase spread thy skirt over me is a symbolical action denoting protection otherwise she was coming before boaz and saying i want to become under your protection you're are near kinsmen you're the only one that has a responsibility and the obligation of bringing us under your protection otherwise she was saying to spread over her the token of or to spread over her his skirt was to say i want you to take me in marriage now some of you young boys you'd probably like that girl coming up to you right now say i want you to marry me you'll be like fool praise the lord that's easy but see in that time what she was doing she was forcing his hand to play the role of kinsmen redeemer now he knew that she was that she and naomi were near kinsmen but he also knew that there was a near ken and he couldn't go through the activity of doing that unless the near the nearer kinsmen proceeded first but now when naomi approached him or ruth approached him and she said spread thy skirt over me otherwise take me unto thy marriage what she is asking of him is i want you to play the part of the kinsmen redeemer because you're the near kinsman and the bible would tell us or the brother man will tell us she took the blank of the holy spirit and when she died out to herself she marked the place where he died and where he died laid it down to rest and she laid down her and took the blanket that was over him and poured it over her and the man woke up and he says who's there because i'm ruth the more bite the handmaid and he raised up and he goes i perceive now that you're a virtuous woman he took notice of her and she was making him aware of the relationship that he had with naomi her mother-in-law that he was near ken and he had the responsibility and he she told him by redeeming naomi you get me by redeeming naomi you get my love you get my devotion you get my affection you get my time you get my praise you get my worship and so we find boaz and we look here in ruth 3 and verse 11. he says now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requires verse 12 and now it is true that i am thy near kinsmen howbeit there is a near kin or a kinsmen nearer than i tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that he will perform thee if he will perform thee the part of the kingdom and well let him do the kinsmen part but he will not do the part of the kinsmen to thee then i will do the part of the kinsmen to thee as the lord liveth lie down until the morning notice the bid that she made was only between him and her she didn't make it a public spectacle she didn't make it a public show and she left before the morning before anybody knew of the request that was made and we find here the hebrew word for widow signifies one that is dumb and boaz he didn't bid her to go and talk to the kinsmen the nearer kinsmen for herself he says i'll go for you so the hebrew word here for widow means dumb boaz therefore would open up his mouth for the dumb he would speak on her behalf and i'm so glad so glad that he speaks on our behalf see instead of touching her he blessed her as a father he encouraged her as a friend he promised her as a kinsmen he rewarded her as a patron and he sends her away laden with hopes and gifts and no less chase more happy than she came god doesn't leave you the same he makes it much better for his church so he goes and we look here in ruth fours we bring this down to a close and boaz went to the gate and he sat down there and behold the kinsmen of whom boaz spake came unto him who he said he said such a one turn aside and sit down and he turned aside and he sat down and he took ten men of the elders of the city and they said sit down here and they sat down and he said unto the kinsmen naomi that has come again out of the country of moab selleth the parcel of land which was our brother elimolex and i thought to advertise these saying by before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thou will redeem it redeem it but if thou will not redeem it then tell me and i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and i and after thee and he said i will redeem it then said boaz what day thou buys the field of the hand of naomi thou must also by ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance now brother batman tells us in the message to kinsmen redeemer he said now there was a nearer kinsman to you and that's the devil but he said now the first you belong to him because why you're his property you were born in sin shaped and iniquity to come to the world speaking lives but he could not redeem it he could not so christ come was made man to take away sins to redeem us do you see it and the other man couldn't do it the devil couldn't die for sins because he was a very perverter that made sin so he could not he'd marred his own inheritance the other fellow and satan would mar his because he is a devil he cannot become another devil to take away the devil the first devil he cannot become sin because he was already sin but christ being sinless became a sinner he could redeem us hallelujah we are redeemed we are redeemed that means to be brought back and we are redeemed see satan's whole plan from the beginning was to destroy god's creation and if he was going to rear up seed on behalf of elimelech on behalf of naomi and behalf of maelon then he would mar his own inheritance so he couldn't and so because he wouldn't then boasted i will do the part of the kinsmen redeemer and i want you to know that satan decided he could not redeem you but there's one that stepped out of glory and he came down and he saw you and he says i will play the part of the kinsmen redeemer this day and he plucked off his shoe and then he handed it to him he says now i will take ownership of all that belonged to naomi and by redeeming what belongs to naomi i get ruth the more bite brides he gets ruth and he becomes her husband and the prophet of god will tell us he said the reason jesus came to the jews alone he had to redeem the jew in order to get the gentile bride what did he redeem he redeemed your soul from hell he redeemed you he brought you back everything that adam lost when he put your name he put you in a pawn shop jesus christ on calvary he was our kinsmen redeemer redeems you of every curse of the devil he redeems your soul redeems your sick body redeems your weary dreary spirit he brought you happiness he brought you joy he brought you that's what the redemption brought you brought you peace long suffering goodness gentleness meekness power the holy ghost brought you divine healing all these things jesus christ brought to you because why he is our kinsmen redeemer and he did all this because he desired to have communion with you he desired to have communion and he can only redeem now he could he could only become in the state of communion with rude by redeeming naomi notice ruth 4 and verse 13. so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and he went unto her and the lord gave her conception and she bear a son i want some musicians to make their way back said he took ruth and he married her and she brought forth the son obed and obed was the father of jesse and jesse was the father of david who was the father of christ the father of the lord jesus and through that righteousness through that clear-cut decision he became our kinsmen redeemer he became kin folks to us to come down and be made like us human beings suffer hunger and thirst and he did all this so that he could have communion with you tonight that's what he longs for church as we partake of this bread and wine tonight god has a greater desire of your life than you just stepping up here tonight and putting a piece of bread in your mouth and taking a sip of wine god is looking for a daily communion with him he's done all the work he's done all the effort he paid the ultimate price and what he's looking for tonight is communion the exchange of intimate feelings the exchange of a love affair a love affair that would bring forth a child by their union and i believe that that's what he wants out of our life is that that life to come forth out of our life because there's a love affair brother braham said god poured himself into christ correct christ poured himself into the church at that day you know that i'm in the father you and me and i and you the whole thing is a plan of redemption coming down that god coming back to live in and dwell in and commune to his people as he did it at the beginning he said see he gets in his church in speaking condition gets his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then they'll come in eden he'll take his church back to where where he left it at the back in the garden of eden so he comes the holy spirit comes down and the miraculous power to transform your life picks you up and brings you inside the veil to where you have fellowship with god and you commune with him as adam did in the beginning in the garden of eden just by your heads just for a brief minute i know i'm over time we're coming to a close right now as we partake of this communion service tonight as we hand it back over to brother tim the bread represents the body that he broke on our behalf the wine represents his blood the ultimate sacrifice that he made and he did it all to play the part of the kinsmen redeemer so that he can bring us into a place of communion to life can come from each life that's here tonight i just want you to take a few minutes before we turn the service over to brother tim and just evaluate your life because if you eat and drink of this wine and this bread unworthily i'm afraid you're you're guilty of eating damnation to your own life not discerning the lord's body but do it tonight in remembrance of the price that he paid not only the price that he paid but the desire that he has to take you from the field and make you a co-owner with him god has a great desire for us church and one day he's taking us out of this field of the world and he's going to take us into another land a land where there's no sickness no sorrow and it all because he wants to have communion and that communion is acquired through redemption father we just turn this service over to you now lord thank you for your word we thank you for your presence father i just pray you'll take this chopped up message lord and may it just find a resting place in the heart of the believer lord thank you lord that you were willing to come down lord forsake your own glory and come and take on a form of sin lord to play the part of the kinsmen redeemer oh and i believe when you look down from heaven and you saw your little bride lord maybe a gentile an off-cast excommunicated but yet lord your heart begin to beat you begin to have a love lord and you commanded the ministry down through the ages lord to drop handfuls on purpose and let her glean but clean where the best ears of corn are and i can say that we here at even the like tabernacle are gleaning where the best ears are and we thank you lord that you're mindful to come by and you drop handfuls on purpose lord may you continue father to do that until our bodies are changed till our lives are changed father and we just commit this service to you now lord may you bless your people in jesus name amen i am redeemed been bought with a price jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just who i am tell [Music] jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just [Music] jesus keep me near the cross there are prayers just [Music] and in the cross in the cross below [Music] [Applause] [Music] shall [Music] she found [Music] is [Music] my glory [Music] the [Music] near the cross oh lamb of god [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the cross in the cross be my [Music] shall find near the cross i'll watch and wait for us [Music] in that cross [Music] my church [Music] he was wounded for our transgression he was wounded for our transgressions [Music] he was bruised for our iniquity surely he goes our sorrow and by his stripes we are healed sing it again now he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised our iniquity surely our sorrows [Music] we come to the communion service tonight originally communion was at the passover there was the lamb the bitter herbs the wine and the unleavened bread these would all make up the passover supper and when jesus died and rose again and ascended into glory the church would meet together on the first day of the week and originally they would share a meal together maybe much like we'd done today in similar ways they would share a meal together and it was a different ones would bring their food and the rich would have their portion and the poor would have what meager parts they could bring and paul would examine this and prayed about it he said you know he said [Music] you're shaming the poor by bringing your abundance and some are even using this success why there's actually some that got drunk at the lord's table and he's he prayed about it and he said these words i received of the lord that which also i delivered to you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take heat this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supp saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for just cause many are weak and sickly among you and many are asleep or dead for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation so paul would change this from a passover meal that they would have and they would instead just share and break the bread and the and sharing the wine because these would represent the death of our lord jesus and they were coming together and remembering remembering that he had died in their place and that on the cross that he paid for their sins and so he he took the elements of it and he said we're just going to take the bread it's unleavened it was called in the original the bread of haste there was no time to mix 11 with it and let it rise they were leaving so it reminds us that our going away is very soon we look at the unleavened bread and we see that there's nothing mixed with it no leveling which means which could represent sin something there that would put it in it that would puff it up make it rise and lebanon rep will become to known as as sin a little bit of leaven would contaminate the whole loaf so there's not to be any sin in christ and and in the body of believers which we are we are to put sin from us and then we take the wine which represents the blood of the new covenant in that blood was where that the life of the fruit of the vine which christ was that grape and he was squeezed out his life squeezed out for us that in the taking of his life and us we take his holy spirit into us this bread would represent the body of christ in this this is broken bread well his physical body was not broken not a bone was broken but this represents something that came from one loaf and his body today is not the physical body of jesus christ it is the spiritual body of jesus christ which is his church each one of you are part of that loaf each one of you make a part of that body when you take your portion today you're remembering i am a part of the body of jesus christ his life dwells within me i'm going to drink deep of the spirit of god i'm going to take that into me i'll i'll feel its burn and the life of that wine as it comes down and into my body i'll feel it as it goes down because it's a life it's more than just a squeezing of the grape but there's life in it and that life is the holy ghost that came back back on the day of pentecost which was squeezed out of christ for us so it's a time of remembering this is more than playing games and this is what paul said this is this is serious business we are typing out something if we if we break the type and we are living in sin and we're not representing christ and we break the type we're simply eating and drinking damnation to our body actually he says this is why many are sick some are sick many asleep they actually died because they didn't discern this is the lord's body this is serious business and the communion with christ is more than just taking bread and taking of the cup the communion represents a fellowship a fellowship that came by redemption that brother joe preached about this evening a fellowship that we have entered into and today let this start a new communion with the lord a renewed fellowship a new blessings from almighty god and that as you come and take the bread you can reconsecrate your life and rededicate yourself to them now you're welcome to the communion table tonight you don't have to be a member of this church to be come to the communion table you're welcome to come to the table of the lord with us [Music] the deacons will come to to usher you row by row and just as soon as you take the the the communion you go right out these doors and over here on the right we have things set up basins and towels and chairs and set up for the foot watching that's for the men and on this side for the ladies and if you're elderly or otherwise unable to get on your knees to wash feet just simply return to your seat there and be in prayer until we return to conclude the service some of our young children are old enough to remain in the sanctuary while the parents go out to foot washing it'll just help if you if some of the the older young children that are not taking foot communion and foot washing just to remain in the sanctuary if they can be reverent and but otherwise if you got several little children there maybe one of the fathers or the following the father can take a youngster to make less for the mothers to deal with here's what's important make this reverent only praying not talking to one another just talking only when absolutely necessary be reverent just like you were in the sanctuary this is a very very serious solemn time now we do foot washing because jesus at the passover he poured water into a basin took a town girded himself and he washed the disciples feet and he showed that [Music] we are to be servants to one another that is important as believers that we wash the dirt off of one another so to speak that we refresh one another that we have a care about us to each other now peter would when he was too old he said you know you know he said you'll never wash my feet no i'm not going to let you watch mine he said if i don't wash your feet you're not a part with me so well then just wash my head and my hands and everything didn't lord i i want to be totally all the way and he said no if you've been bathed you see in that day they had bath houses they took their baths at a bath house walking back to their homes to their places they had to walk through the trails you know animals was part of the transportation people rode on donkeys and horses and whatever and those sheep and goats and things made the droppings along there and their feet would pick up dust and jesus said no it's not necessary if you've been bathed is not necessary but for me just to wash your feet now let's bring the type down if you've been bathed you've been filled with the holy spirit of god you've been washed it's not necessary for you to go get re-baptized again and re-washed but hear your feet where you walk through the world or maybe you stumbled along the way or you made a mistake or you know we all do minor things wrong but it's a moment of time of consecration just to wash your feet wash your feet it's good for us to wash one another's feet not just in the ceremonial part but when you see your brother do wrong say brother you shouldn't act that way you shouldn't do that way we're christians this is not the way we behave when you see another gossip about another just stop it and say listen my ears weren't for what is not for trash and your mouth is not to speak trash we're the sons and daughters of the most high god let's have prayer for that person you see we wash the dirt off of one another we help other each other in our journey you know some things it's not easy you know you get a little something on your face you're not even aware it's there and somebody says uh you got chocolate on your face where you ate dessert today uh you got something on your mouth there oh thank you what is it something you didn't notice something that you didn't know but it was making you unpresentable this is the way we do one another foot washing is a ceremonial thing tonight but is only representing and reminding us of our service to god and to each other be a servant be encouraging be in love be kind wash the dirt off father i dedicate this bread and this wine to you today i bless it in the name of jesus christ as it is for taken up tonight i pray lord that your blessings will rest upon it lord as they take it may they remember calvary and what you mean to them i ask your blessings upon us now as we partake of this sacrament as we go to foot washing lord as we are in the service will you bless us and bless us in your presence in jesus name amen i want you to put on a little music there brother tim and what we're going to do is have the deacons come right now and those to assist me those that are on the music those up in the sound booth you're to come be some of the first that will take communion tonight so that you can return for further service just come prayerfully the

you for the wonderful meal we had today also if your child plays on the playground outside and so i'm talking to myself here if your child plays on the playground or plays outside please make sure you take a few moments to check after them and see if they have any trash that they've left pick up anything that may have been left out there keep having some trash that's been left around and makes it difficult especially after birthday parties and other gatherings outside of normal service time so if everybody could help keep it clean we'd appreciate that amen how many loves the lord amen let's go
