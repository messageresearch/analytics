[0:05] hello everyone we are the ministry team
[0:08] but evening like Tabernacle and it's
[0:11] great that you join with us again today
[0:12] and hope that you will invite your
[0:15] friends to come and join with us in this
[0:17] roundtable discussion we got some great
[0:21] things to talk about this today as we
[0:25] promised we're gonna be talking about
[0:26] the church and how it fell away and how
[0:31] Satan got into even the book of Acts
[0:33] Church and but I'd like to start off
[0:37] with a scripture here today because we
[0:40] were talking about the vine and the
[0:42] branches and and the husbandman of
[0:45] course is the caretaker of the vineyard
[0:47] and he is looking for fruit and James
[0:50] five and seven said be patient therefore
[0:53] brethren unto the coming of the Lord
[0:55] behold the husbandman waiteth for the
[0:59] precious fruit of the earth and hath
[1:02] long patience for it until he received
[1:04] the early and latter rain be patient
[1:08] also establishing hearts for the coming
[1:10] of the Lord
[1:11] draw nigh so we see that tied in with
[1:16] the husbandmen looking for fruit is the
[1:19] coming of the Lord
[1:20] and it's near coming he is going to be
[1:23] looking for fruit and he's going to look
[1:26] for the fruit the same kind of fruit
[1:28] that he had from the original vine and
[1:31] so we've had all kinds that have been
[1:33] grafted in man made the ideas and I had
[1:37] things that are grafted into
[1:39] Christianity but he's looking for his
[1:42] fruit that's right man that's right so
[1:45] what happened to that first church what
[1:49] happened where did where did the devil
[1:52] come in I believe there's a wealth of
[1:56] understanding that we can draw to see
[1:59] how he worked in that first church and
[2:01] how he would work today what was
[2:04] prophesied to come I think it would be
[2:06] very nice to to dig in there what
[2:09] happened to that first trip I think Paul
[2:10] gives us to war
[2:11] in acts 20 verse 28 he says take heed
[2:15] and that word too means be cautious so
[2:17] take heed unto yourselves and to all the
[2:20] flock over which the Holy Ghost has made
[2:21] you overseers to feed the Church most
[2:24] their charge was to feed the church
[2:25] right yeah take care of them to nurture
[2:28] them to admonish them in the in the Word
[2:30] of God which he had purchased with his
[2:32] own blood and he says for I know this
[2:34] that after my departing shall Grievous
[2:36] wolves that were Grievous I looked it up
[2:39] and the word there means mighty
[2:41] dangerous so strong that the fever flock
[2:45] the feeble flock will not be able to
[2:46] resist them so they are dangerous and
[2:49] mighty the cunning they know what
[2:50] they're doing right and so we find that
[2:52] Paul has given us the layout or the plan
[2:55] of how the Antichrist or how the that
[2:58] devil is going to come into the church
[3:00] and begin to pull the church away and he
[3:03] says the grievous woes are going to
[3:04] enter in not sparing the flock fleecing
[3:07] the sheep not feeding the Sheep oh my
[3:10] and we find that that's what they're
[3:11] doing but he also gave another warning
[3:13] he says in verse 30 also of your own
[3:15] selves shall men arise not only are they
[3:18] coming from the outside they're coming
[3:20] from within as well and their whole goal
[3:23] and the whole mission is to fleece the
[3:24] flock to destroy the flock and at the
[3:28] same time under the auspice of feeding
[3:30] i've taken care of they're obviously
[3:33] interested more in building their own
[3:35] Kingdom instead of building the king it
[3:37] says so it says the very end of that
[3:39] verse says it says to draw away
[3:41] disciples after them no I'd rather get
[3:44] this their wardrobe means to tear away
[3:45] oh wow so there their whole plan is to
[3:49] tear away tear away from what from the
[3:51] truth from the gospel that Paul
[3:53] originally planted and laid out their
[3:56] desires to tear the flock to the people
[3:58] away from the truth so he can put his
[4:01] own plan or his own desires in to have
[4:04] his church and brother Joe you said
[4:06] something interesting that men would
[4:08] arise from within and Jesus said this
[4:11] exactly as Paul was speaking of wolves
[4:13] Jesus said it exactly he said they would
[4:16] come as wolves but they would be in
[4:18] sheer clothes
[4:19] meaning it would be very inoffensive it
[4:22] would be it would it would look look
[4:24] like something good yes like
[4:26] Christianity like the church but it is
[4:28] religious oh it is religious and that's
[4:32] what people fail to see is that Satan is
[4:35] very religion religious and he wants
[4:37] worship and so the worship that belonged
[4:40] to God he wants to take to himself but
[4:43] he does it in a way of not coming along
[4:45] and say I'm Satan worship his love not
[4:47] him standing the pulpit with forked
[4:49] horns and a pitchfork that home he's got
[4:52] a suit and towel and he's saying Jesus
[4:54] Jesus yeah yeah is that Jesus of their
[4:56] own making paul says speaking perverse
[4:58] things notice what they're speaking of
[5:00] speaking perverse things and that is
[5:03] distorting the truth or posing or a plot
[5:06] against the saving purpose and plans of
[5:08] god to corrupt to turn aside from the
[5:10] correct path so there they're saying
[5:12] things but it's not what Paul says just
[5:15] a little twist it's just a little twist
[5:17] like this it sounds religious and it
[5:19] sounds good but there's four it takes
[5:21] that ear to hear what their spirit says
[5:24] amen and can rightly divide the word and
[5:26] discern what is right and what is wrong
[5:28] and I believe that God has gifted me in
[5:30] today that can discern the Spirit of
[5:32] Christ and desert the spirit of the
[5:35] Antichrist so they can know which spirit
[5:37] is correct and which spirit is not
[5:39] correct so so it's not a complete denial
[5:41] of Scripture or denial of Christ is just
[5:45] a twist like jesus said beware of the
[5:47] leaven of the Pharisees yeah and 11 is
[5:50] comes in silently it just comes in
[5:53] secretly but it permeates the whole yeah
[5:56] so so just a little twist can actually
[5:59] bring death you know what I find
[6:02] interesting in reading the book of Acts
[6:04] is just we've been talking about acts 2
[6:06] and the experience on the day of
[6:09] Pentecost but just a few chapters down
[6:12] they say that they mentioned a certain
[6:14] sect of Pharisees which believe you know
[6:18] think so why and Jesus will look at a
[6:21] Pharisee in techology you're of your
[6:23] father the devil
[6:24] mine yeah so how in the world did
[6:27] Pharisees get in there but yet still
[6:28] believe
[6:29] mm-hmm so they believe and still be
[6:32] Pharisees yeah I mean you know Kenny
[6:37] this is really amazing you know
[6:39] somebody's a believer and yet he still
[6:41] Pharisees you know if you become a
[6:43] believer you know then you would have
[6:46] believed the precepts of Christ rather
[6:48] than Pharisee ISM but you see that was
[6:51] so ingrained so they were they were
[6:53] intent on bringing that whole thing in
[6:56] and perverting the gospel of Jesus
[6:59] Christ exactly you know and changing it
[7:01] back to works instead of grace again and
[7:05] and and turn it to the precepts of man
[7:08] and traditions yeah traditions of man
[7:11] what they use scripture yeah they use
[7:14] scripture introducing trying to
[7:16] reintroduce circumcision right exactly
[7:19] and so it looked very good especially to
[7:21] Jews in that time it looked very good
[7:24] and it even caused a struggle with the
[7:27] leaders of the Church of that day even
[7:29] Paul and all of them come together over
[7:31] the matter because it looks so close but
[7:34] it was leaven yeah yeah and it goes to
[7:36] show that the Pharisees that believed
[7:39] had issues well you know when we see
[7:41] those things were not to be passive
[7:43] about it I like how Paul said we had no
[7:45] small dissension with them yes we stood
[7:51] against it praise the Lord
[7:52] exactly well you know that's acts 15 1
[7:56] is what we're referring to and they they
[7:59] said except to be circumcised after the
[8:02] manner of Moses you cannot be saved so
[8:04] salvation began to be set on precepts it
[8:08] was not even the conditions of what
[8:10] Christ gave at Calvary because of course
[8:13] you know we must be circumcised but that
[8:16] circumcision is the cutting off of
[8:18] fleshly desires yes by the Holy Ghost
[8:20] amen and so it was it was a real
[8:24] circumcision from the Imps of the inside
[8:27] and the changing of the nature but they
[8:30] they were still trying to apply the
[8:32] external rather than realize the
[8:34] internal work that had to be done to
[8:37] change the nature amen so they were
[8:39] reverting the church back or
[8:41] in Galatians chapter 2 3 it says but
[8:44] neither titus who was with me being a
[8:47] greek was compelled to be circumcised
[8:49] right that because of false brother
[8:53] unawares brought in who came in privily
[8:56] to spy out our Liberty which we have in
[9:00] Christ Jesus that they might bring us
[9:02] into bondage
[9:03] so reverting they were actually taking
[9:06] the church into bondage so what was the
[9:10] motivation what was the spirit behind it
[9:12] it was not Christ that would bring into
[9:15] bondage
[9:16] it was the Antichrist that's right and
[9:18] in first John chapter 2 verse 18 it says
[9:22] little children it is the last time and
[9:24] as you have heard that Antichrist shall
[9:27] come even now there are many Antichrist
[9:30] whereby we know that it is the last time
[9:33] hmm I think it was really striking word
[9:37] that he said it was brethren but their
[9:40] false brother false brother so there
[9:42] were people who were naming the name of
[9:43] Christ but had not been cleansed by the
[9:47] power of the Holy Ghost
[9:49] from the the ideas of man and come to
[9:54] have a spirit lead spirit-directed
[9:57] Bible doctrine that they adhered to so
[10:02] it had to be a people they believed the
[10:04] Pharisees that believed brother and
[10:06] false brother how did they get to this
[10:08] point because I mean they apparently
[10:11] sympathized with the belief they
[10:14] apparently you know saw some good some
[10:16] good in it but somehow they did not
[10:19] receive the same life that Peter and the
[10:21] ones on the day of Pentecost received
[10:23] they missed the Holy Ghost you know and
[10:27] it gets the point where Jesus you
[10:29] referred to that Jesus speaking about
[10:30] the wolves and sheep clothes and you
[10:32] read on down he says they'll come to me
[10:34] and that day saying we cast out Devils
[10:36] we've you know done many mighty works
[10:39] and he'll look at them and say depart
[10:42] from me you workers of iniquity for I
[10:44] never knew you yeah good and that new is
[10:46] not knowing there on the earth I mean
[10:48] God
[10:49] all things he knows ever flee that jumps
[10:52] ever fly that Batson's I so he knew that
[10:55] there was on the earth but that knew if
[10:57] you look at it it's actually a
[10:58] relationship is actually the life of God
[11:01] being transferred I never knew you and I
[11:05] think that's where these where this
[11:07] church started ended up they all started
[11:08] ended up accepting people and allowing
[11:11] things to happen but these people never
[11:13] became leaders they became great men you
[11:17] so to speak but they never received the
[11:19] Holy Ghost on short following shores
[11:21] know these things you Pharisees you can
[11:24] you can see it even today in a sense
[11:26] that they believed but y'all said they
[11:29] missed the Holy Ghost so it shows that
[11:31] it has to be more than just a belief
[11:33] that's when these aren't secret
[11:35] believers these are professed believers
[11:36] yeah right and yet they don't have the
[11:39] Holy Ghost they don't have the same life
[11:40] so it has to be something more they
[11:42] didn't receive the Holy Ghost when they
[11:43] believed obviously no no no they
[11:47] obviously did Paul said have you
[11:49] received the Holy Ghost since you've
[11:51] been since you gave me after you
[11:53] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[11:55] Spirit of promise
[11:56] so you're believing unto the Holy Ghost
[11:59] not that you received the Holy Ghost
[12:01] when you believe but you believe unto it
[12:04] until you receive that's right and I
[12:06] think I think these Pharisees which
[12:08] believe or a good manager and they had
[12:11] good intentions they saw the goodness of
[12:15] Christ and saw merit to many of the
[12:18] wonderful things but they missed that
[12:21] light and that's why there that they
[12:25] could not rightly divide the word of
[12:27] truth
[12:27] you see we have a mistaken idea today in
[12:30] Christianity and that is that you can
[12:33] educate someone into Christ or you can
[12:36] educate ministers into ministry and
[12:39] really it's a divine call of God that
[12:42] has to come by a Holy Ghost experience
[12:45] exactly you know Jesus said do not do
[12:48] not preach do not do anything you go and
[12:51] you
[12:51] wait in in that Upper Room into in
[12:54] Jerusalem until your endued with power
[12:57] from on high so he wouldn't send them
[12:59] out to preach or do anything until they
[13:02] first got that power amen and this is
[13:05] what was lacking in those Pharisees they
[13:07] were lacking that power we think we can
[13:09] educate people into it there was no one
[13:11] more educated than the Pharisees Oh even
[13:14] in the scripture yeah there was no the
[13:16] Apostles could never sit down and debate
[13:18] Scripture as far as knowledge wise with
[13:21] those Pharisees not but when it came
[13:23] right down to it Paul said I had to
[13:24] count everything I had learned he wasn't
[13:27] speaking of worldly things and he was
[13:29] spiritually of the face of his religious
[13:31] training yeah exactly and all the
[13:34] knowledge he had he said I had to count
[13:36] it all this dunk yeah that I might win
[13:40] Christ amen well then in first John four
[13:44] and three it tells us about the spirit
[13:47] of Antichrist where have you heard that
[13:49] should come and even now already it is
[13:53] in the world so all the way back there
[13:56] the spirit of the Antichrist was already
[14:00] in the world and people were receiving
[14:02] instead of the Spirit of God was
[14:05] receiving the spirit of the Antichrist
[14:07] yes through knowledge instead of by the
[14:10] experience of an in Perth isn't that
[14:13] amazing that they would take on a spirit
[14:17] of the Antichrist because he said he
[14:20] said this is that spirit of the
[14:23] Antichrist yes and so rather than
[14:26] receiving the spirit and life of Christ
[14:28] they were actually receiving then the
[14:31] spirit of the Antichrist which we know
[14:32] is Satan because it is a pervert of the
[14:35] gospel of Christ but back to what you
[14:38] said earlier that that Satan don't
[14:41] always come with a forked tail and claws
[14:43] and horns but he comes as an angel of
[14:46] light uh-huh and so it spoke of here in
[14:50] 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 verse 4 if he
[14:55] cometh preaching if for if he that
[14:58] cometh preacheth another Jesus
[15:01] so Paul was not speaking of some
[15:05] atheistic communist ik satanic force no
[15:09] he's speaking of something that would
[15:11] look like Jesus that would be presented
[15:14] as Jesus uh-huh he said for if he that
[15:17] cometh preacheth another Jesus whom you
[15:20] have not preached hmm whom we have not
[15:23] preached or if you receive another
[15:25] spirit which you've not received or
[15:28] another gospel which you have not
[15:30] accepted you might bel bear with him so
[15:34] so Paul is speaking now speaking of
[15:37] another Jesus that would be commonly
[15:39] accepted right another spirit another
[15:43] Jesus another gospel that's right yes
[15:46] and that's what they were receiving and
[15:48] so you know here was this gospel was not
[15:52] saying oh well there's there's no such
[15:55] thing as Jesus Christ and no he didn't
[15:58] die on the cross but they were they were
[16:00] actually bringing in and some of the
[16:02] very concepts of Christ but twisting it
[16:05] and just enough way you know that it
[16:08] become instead of the the gospel of
[16:10] Christ it become actually the gospel of
[16:13] the Antichrist my and and such a
[16:16] deceiving thing and then people in their
[16:19] experience for getting another spirit
[16:21] which was not the Jesus of the Bible but
[16:25] was the Jesus actually of their own
[16:27] making handling the Word of God
[16:30] deceitfully that's right and it's
[16:32] amazing to me how quickly it happened
[16:34] and here we are two thousand years down
[16:37] the road how much has gone on how much
[16:40] has that antichrist spirit worked
[16:42] because here we are in the first church
[16:44] talking about men that walked with Jesus
[16:47] yes
[16:48] talking about did you talk about
[16:51] leadership I mean that church had this
[16:53] just strong leadership of men that it
[16:56] came from the upper room so men like
[16:58] Paul who had met the pillar of fire you
[17:00] know they were there on the road and it
[17:02] had blinded him and yet even with those
[17:04] leaders in that atmosphere of the early
[17:06] church he was able to worm his way in
[17:08] mine he's no amateur well I think as
[17:12] each generation
[17:13] further further further away from the
[17:15] initial fire that felled you started
[17:17] seeing that decline and worse for the
[17:20] love and the power and the passion for
[17:22] Christ for the word beginning to fain
[17:24] begin to wane over time because it was
[17:26] it was a hearsay become a tradition here
[17:30] and you find that shortly after Paul
[17:33] went off the scene we're looking 300
[17:34] years later they had to have some kind
[17:36] of counsel and we'll get further into
[17:38] that later on but they had to have a
[17:39] counsel good just you know to figure out
[17:42] debates in the church because there was
[17:43] so much dissension within the early
[17:45] church because they got further and
[17:47] further and further away from the truth
[17:49] it's a very very good point then maybe
[17:51] we can pick up on that that the cycle of
[17:54] revivals if we study revivals they
[17:56] follow a pattern there's a pattern in
[17:58] the Bible just exactly what you said
[18:00] that when God brings a revival initially
[18:04] there's an illumination there is a power
[18:07] there is a an overcoming there's a
[18:10] victory there's a glory but just the
[18:13] next generation something begins to
[18:16] change well you think about the first
[18:18] church Ephesus as we recall you found it
[18:21] in Revelations that word means aimed at
[18:23] but relaxed so they were aimed at the
[18:27] truth they were caught they were set
[18:29] afire but they begin to get relaxed and
[18:31] with their maybe their knowledge from an
[18:33] axe with what they know and just wasn't
[18:36] alive with the power and the passion of
[18:37] you know they had the knowledge without
[18:41] the power of exactly without the life of
[18:43] it exactly and and so this is this is
[18:47] part of the restoration we must not only
[18:49] just receive a knowledge of the very
[18:52] power of Christ under salvation you know
[18:55] because it's the power of God exactly so
[18:59] in on next session I think it would be
[19:01] good if we could talk about more about
[19:03] this falling away and how the first
[19:06] church lost his first love and how the
[19:08] Antichrist
[19:09] you know wormed its way into that early
[19:12] church and then continued to waste
[19:15] because I think we'll find as we go
[19:17] along that the falling away isn't just
[19:20] an endtime event right but the falling
[19:23] way has been
[19:24] a long long time thank you for joining
