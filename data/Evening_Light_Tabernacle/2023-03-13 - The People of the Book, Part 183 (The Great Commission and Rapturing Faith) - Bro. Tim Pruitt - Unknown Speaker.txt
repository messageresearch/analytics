Kate Conroy is going to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ one of our young ones we are so thankful for God dealing with hearts and lives Amen to see them make a step toward Jesus this just makes a heart Glide hey man aren't you glad to have a church and body Believers and Ministry that can preach the word and see Souls saved and young people come to Christ and get a real start on the right things we heard a wonderful testimony the other day of brother uh brother Jackson Sister Laura Burns and you know what they're upbringing they're coming and the drug life the party life the things like that and to think God broke that cycle in their lives and they can bring up their children and nurture them in the way of the Lord and teach them the right way they don't have to live in the dysfunctional home they can be under the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost this is what it's about well you know I don't eat church that's for the babies hey we need the mature ones here to nurture Show Yourself mature enough to nurture the young ones coming on to produce an atmosphere of Holiness and righteousness to be guides along the way to direct people in the things of God God bless you amen let's turn to Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 10. appreciate you all this morning Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 10. I'm going to be speaking today on the Great Commission and rapturing faith we're going to look here at this verse in verse 10. and we see here the son of man is speaking why do we call him the son of man it literally means man of dust and it's where God had come and walked among men Gathering From the 16 elements made himself a body and stepped into it along with two angels and they come and visit Sarah and Abraham and it will be it will be a foreshadowing of one day where God will wrap himself in 16 elements in a virgin womb and be born a baby but in this instance it's not time for him to come that way but he comes and makes an appearing to Abraham to to write a prophecy for the last day it's more than a historical event is a prophecy that God is speaking and he wants you to understand that God will again Tabernacle human flesh in the last day and that we will see the ministry of Christ and the ministry Apostles as it's manifested in the ministry of the son of man Christ in Bride form so here we see the son of man God is manifested in human flesh appears to Sarah for a commission and he commissions her to bring forth the promised son so I want you to catch this it's a commission to bring forth the promised son Genesis 18 verse 10 and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him God bless you you can be seated I'm also going to read some words from the scripture here if you'll be turning over to Marks chapter 16. because when the son of man manifests himself in human flesh as we spoke about come in as Jesus Christ and he has walked now upon the Earth for 33 years and he is about to conclude his visit to the Earth that he has done in human flesh so here the ministry of Christ in in Jesus is now coming to its end as far as this Earthly mission and he appears to his disciples to give them the commission and so again we have again another appearance of Christ he has died buried rose again and now in his appearing he comes and appears to his disciples to give them the last words before he leaves and so he says in Mark 16 verse 14 afterwards he appeared unto the eleven as they said it made and embraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart which is what he does with Sarah saying is there anything too hard for the Lord because they believe not them which had seen him as after he had risen and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven I'm reading this so you'll know these are the last words as he gives the commission and he's and he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the words with sign following now every one of them like whether it be the Mark here or whether it be the Book of Luke or the book of Acts that we're going to write read from this morning speaks about these last words of Jesus now in um in Luke chapter 24 and 49 he will tell them behold I send the promise of my father upon you but you tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high so you know there was there's a little more to it than just go and preach but I want you to wait until you're endued with powerful High because there's going to come an outpouring of the spirit that will happen on the day of Pentecost now then go to with me to chapter acts Acts chapter 1 rather verse 3 and it talks about him raising from the dead to whom all see also he showed himself alive after his passion or after his death or suffering I have by many infallible proofs being seen within 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which he saith you have heard of me then verse 8 but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and the outermost parts of the Earth and so then we want to turn to Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 because it is here that the disciples are empowered to fulfill the Great Commission notice they can't just go out and fulfill the commission they have to be empowered same way with Sarah she just can't go and bring forth the promised son but I will return to thee according to the time of life so it would be the the overshadowing or the the power of the most high that will bring this to power so verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it's set upon each of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues or other languages as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven and when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all Deeds which speak galileans and how here we ever man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians and medes and eliomites and dwellers in Mesopotamia and Judea and Cappadocia and pontus and Asian pyria and pampaia in Egypt and in parts of Libya around about Serene and and strangers of Rome and Jews and proselytes and crets and Arabians we do hear them speak and our language or in our tongues the wonderful works of God and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying to one another what meaneth this and others mocking said these are full of new wines stop there just for a minute judgment will come upon the Jews because of mocking the come of the Holy Spirit and as they do they will be carried and captive and dispersed throughout all nations and and they will be cut off from mocking the Holy Ghost remember because they rejected that they are dispersed so it will happen with the Gentiles as a laodicean church puts Christ on the outside of the church and in doing it they will they will be there because they have mocked the Holy Spirit because they have rejected his voice notice again um Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of Judea and all that dwell in Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see vision and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into the blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved so now as we have looked at these scriptures together this morning to lay a foundation for what we are going to be speaking on of of the Great Commission and Rapture and faith we we know that of course we're at the end time and what we saw back in the prophecy of Sarah and Abraham and also in the prophecy that lays there um of what Jesus spoke to the Disciples of as as told them there was a Great Commission that the coming of the son of man Christ to Sarah was to fulfill the Great Commission that was given to Abraham which had not been done the bonds woman child did not fulfill it nor could he you see neither has all of these denominations today fulfilled the Great Commission and the promised son which comes at the end this has not come now as we are looking at this um Genesis 4 15 verse 4 I want you to look at the original commission that was given to Abraham behold the word the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine air but he that come out of thy bowels shall be thine air by the way he is speaking directly of Eliezer the eldest servant in his house and he is saying of him he will not be the heir but there's one coming out of your own bowels that will be your heir now I just want you to understand uh yes brother Branham airs with us as a part of the Bride but understand he is not the heir the air is the bride of Christ so watch what he said you know because he has said I'm going childless and the one one that's not even out of my own bowels is my Heir my servant the eldest servant and he said and he and then God brought him forth and he said abroad and said look now toward the heavens and tell the stars that thou be able to see them or number them and he said unto them so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness so this was a commission to Abraham and now was being reconfirmed to Sarah and of course now she is to finish Abraham's Commission amen and we are now to fulfill and finish the Great Commission for we for when we find the last seed somebody help me now and when we find the last seed and they too become a witness of the power of the Holy Ghost it is then Jesus the promised son will come now if you look with me to Matthew 24 verse 14 Jesus said this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached into all the world for witness and All Nations and then shall the End come stop right there brother Branham is insistent all the way to the end of his ministry that this has not been fulfilled that means it has to be fulfilled for the end to come how many wants him to come how many wants to Rapture of the church how many wants to dead in Christ to rise then what do we we find that the gospel must be preached and to all the world for a witness to All Nations and then shall the End come now last Sunday we showed how the Great Commission must be fulfilled because now the seals is open so the word has been revealed the book has been opened that which was opened to Paul Mysteries that were understood in the first days have now been revealed or uncovered rather unveiled again to take took the heaping of stones and uh off of denominationalism awful lost truth and now it has been revealed back to the church again now so again so now only now listen Wesley couldn't do it Luther couldn't do it Azusa Street couldn't do it they could not take the gospel to the world it had not been restored I'm trying to say something that means the burden lays on us amen not just in word but in power understand it's not the gospel until it comes in power signs have to follow them that believe now so brother Branham tells us in the invisible Union again this is one of the last things imparted to the church he tells brother Jack Moore I I'm going to preach a message to my followers the people who believe me I'm going to preach this to them you know pardon me you know for stepping into your pulpit and doing it but you've given me a lot of Liberty and I'm taking Liberty now to preach a sermon to my people and he said we know the modern Church in his present condition and his present state is in no condition condition to finish up the Great Commission that God gave the church for this day how many Pentecostals can say Amen to that so right we are wanting us to this that fight this afraid to face the word right down to the test they know you can tell them about it and I can't help it I can't believe that I don't care what he does in other words no matter what kind of Miracles what kind of discernment what kind of vindication I don't care what he does you see it shows what Mommy and Papa you have you might be a state president or someday you might be dissed out of the other you know that that's what's held out is the carrot you can be a great man in our organization but he said you better be a son of God then he said in closing and saying this finish up the Great Commission how could they do it we know they're dead he said God let it die in this scientific age all of it so he can open up the seven seal mystery to the undenominational bride how can a denomination accept those Seven Seals which is absolutely contrary a serpent seed and all these other things a whole false seven Mysteries is contrary to what they've been taught because it took the old school from the bible school and the Seven Seals of God when it was opened there on the mountain no let me let God know let me die right now at this Pulpit if that ain't the truth I've foretold you a year and six months before it happened and he told me go to Arizona and what would happen out there in the desert and there's men sitting here tonight was was standing right there and present when the seven angels came down and the Life Magazine packed the article of it right it's right there in their Observatory everything and they don't even know what it's about and everything even to the destruction of California coming up now and all these other things and how I told him how many days it would be and how it would be were this great big earthquake happened in Alaska that was March 27 1964. how would be the beginning of the sign of time and what would take place and just word by word what it said and it's never failed one time you've never seen it fail because and it can't fail because it's God's words and Heaven and Earth will pass away but it can't fail that's right so again in the next service he comes along and I'm going to read it too where he says it'll take Mark 16 to call a bride out for you cannot let me just emphasize some things you cannot be the bride of Christ without fulfilling the Great Commission now that's the only way Sarah can be mother of the promised seed was fulfilled the Great Commission given to Abraham and the only way we can be the Bride of Jesus Christ completed by the marriage of the Lamb is by fulfilling the Great Commission again this is I have heard and now I see and brother Brandon said everybody knows we have a promise of the church condition in the last day the church in its present condition can never fulfill the Commandments of God the Great Commission could never call the bride out which one would do it uh the Pentecostals I should say not not one none of the rest of them that's the shut that's on the wheat that come out and look just exactly like the wheat but there's no wheat to it it opens up but the grain comes out of that they organize they kill themselves that's where they died they are stalks but the wheat has to come up through that from through there and now it's beginning to form in the bride form the corn of wheat that fell into the ground to the Dark Ages it had to die so you see it's the undenominational bride who the seals have been revealed to and they are the ones to fulfill the Great Commission that's who I'm speaking to this morning the people of the book must fulfill the commission to take the land that belongs to the book every promise of God are you with me now so this commission returns her to the bride age to do this Sarah has to come become pregnant and and so must the bride is that right amen there there has to be a message that comes that starts to change within Sarah and so must it be with the bride she must actually become pregnant with the word what's now in Christ the mystery brother Brandon said remember now we are now as is bride impregnated with the spirit oh my the church bearing his children see pregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bearing forth the signs of his life evidence with Eminence evidence of the resurrection showing he's not dead but He's Alive forevermore this is eternal life and Vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him so you see the bride must be pregnant with the word and if it's a child of the word it'll be on Mark 16. Come speaking Acts 2 38 young and come on because that's the only kind the word can bring forth the child of the word must look and act like the second Adam now the coming of the message to Sarah was to fulfill the Great Commission of the promised son and it and and again you know that Great Commission returns to her it returns her to make her the bride she was when Abraham first married her that old woman I want you to think of this changed to be young again Im so much that this 90 year old was desired by a king so I want to go over that for again do you know the the Great Commission of the promised son that she was to fulfilled if this commission returned her to being the bride that she was when Abraham first married her it turned her back to her youth again come on even so the coming of the son of man is to fulfill the Great Commission so as to bring the end the gospel his kingdom must be preached to all the world for a witness to All Nations and shall the income and to do so the bride must return the Young Bride that she was at Pentecost in order to bring forth the promised son so this is the age in which the true church returns to be in the brides he was at Pentecost so of course we know then there must be of necessity be a return of dynamic power now brother Branham told us the lot of rain let's talk about it for a moment I preached about it last week but he told us the latter ring would not be what the Pentecostals were looking for to close the heavens that it rained not and plagued World governments and and so on like that is Moses and Elijah did you know Elijah stopped the rain amen you know there there he took and killed all the false prophets and you know did Miracles and signs before Moses comes along and plagues uh Pharaoh until he lets God's people go that is not the bride's Ministry remember that happens we'll repeat under the two witnesses to the hundred and forty four thousand so no we won't have what the Pentecostals are looking for but we should expect a people that is standing under the blood with the mind of Christ and speak a word of creation for the third pole and it's open in other words is based on Mark 11 22. now I want you to look at this with me Mark 11 22. Jesus said have faith in God brother Branham says to us have perfect faith that this age has required a greater faith a rapturing faith he says for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them now God made certain that we understood this scripture was to be made manifested in in the third phase or the third poll or where the word is revealed we know that third pull is the opening of the word and so God made sure that we understood that this scripture would be what it was based on so the third phase of the word coming to the bride is based on this scripture a people who takes the word and believe it so much that whatsoever think they desired they believed they receive it and they shall have it that if they say to this mountain be moved and be cast in the sea it shall be done even as they said [Music] we're talking about the Church of the last day now we're talking about the people with the faith and the commission God hiding himself in Simplicity brother Branham told us to do this in order to fulfill the scripture you have to get away from your own thoughts you have to let the mind that was in Christ be in you you have to stay there till every sin of fear every sin of Doubt is gone from your heart and if you're there and God doesn't take you and omit your sins and send you in the presence of God there's something wrong with your experience I don't care how many degrees of doctors you have how big a church you are what kind of big will you belong to or how many organizations whatever it is has nothing to do that until your sins are confessed and in the blood of Jesus Christ and you stand unadulterated a born-again son and daughter of God with a life of God in you to speak a word of creation let this mountain be moved and it'll remind you God revealing himself in humility he picks up them kind that has no education he picks up them kinds that will just believe that I think the father creator of heavens and earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent Hallelujah that will look upon him and we see we we see him smitten and stricken of God but that he was wounded for our transgressions amen that the Clorox came the day he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement upon of our peace was upon him with his Strife we were healed what did he do he humbled himself to death on Good Friday afternoon that he might rise Sunday Easter Sunday to send back the Holy Spirit upon the church with a double portion of it that we might do the same things that he did amen he and he promised these signs I'm giving him the commission again these signs will follow them that believe and how far we get away from it by our traditions there you are our traditions but I want you to understand you're no longer like Adam was with a Chasm between you and God so while we're on the other side of the chasm no it's even greater than that he did away with the chasm there's not even a remembrance of your past and your sins and you stand pure under the blood Hallelujah Hallelujah with authority to speak the word of creation this is where God has placed you the authority that he's given his church now in perfect faith brother Branham says that I want you to get the word perfect faith not just the faith but a perfect faith this this bride in this last day is required a greater faith that in other ages a rapturing faith somebody with me let's hold the thought now you know he he tells us over and again and we'll read some of it maybe this morning if I can't get the church to even believe for Divine Healing and have faith for that how am I going to get them to believe for complete body change it's going to take a greater faith and faith is based on forgiveness because I'm forgiven the blood is taking care of the past amen it's taking care of my first birth listen you cannot speak a word of creation under your first birth but as an amateur God as a son of the Living God you can stand there with Divine Authority and speak to that mountain so faith is based on forgiveness and as we said this morning trying to get to church into the place here's my goal here's what I'm trying to do get the church into the place where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door I want to just say we're here we see it he said and I want to say we see it Hallelujah we can give testimony after testimony we see it we see it we see it but he said we want to see more of it we want it to flow out that it'll be a help to us and flow out to others come on the evening light that's what we want to be we want to be a light in the evening time that it flows out to others amen that God is still God and he's still living in his people and he's still manifests in his glory and demonstrating his power you know too many are looking at it all the rain's all over it concluded with our Prophet you see he was our last sign sure it's the last sign before the bride coming it's the last time before the bride coming a prophet had to appear on the scene before Christ could come in Bride form so sure he was the last sign before the Bride Comes but you my beloved children you are than I signed Hallelujah that's who you are you are the last sign you are God's sign on display with a Great Commission these signs shall follow them that believe that but I want you to understand the latter rain does not conclude with the prophet but with the bride as he pours out a spirit because I'm going to show you it crescendos with the dynamic power that changes our bodies resurrected to dead and transports the bride into the heavenlies what in the world am I telling you I'm telling you you hadn't seen nothing yet Hallelujah the display of God that we talk about and what happened under the prophet's Ministry You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet [Applause] if I ain't healing you ain't seen nothing yet just wait till my hair turns back the right color the wrinkles go out of my face the formulas leave the body and the dead in Christ rise devil we're not through with you you haven't seen nothing yet you're about to be defeated by a woman there's a woman gonna give you a legend and defeat that itself she'll be standing on her feet Chase in a moment and a twinkling of an eye such a defeat that he'll be cast out of the heavens as we go up as we Ascend he comes down [Applause] he falls he's thrown down by bride and Power the full heavens of Adam once ruled from this bride will rule Mark 11 22. this was exactly what Adam did in the beginning the bride does this in the end time listen go back and listen brother Brandon said if you miss it come listen to this tape and he tells her the purpose of God what God was doing all down to the ages they sent a message called Christ the mystery that message was to show us the seventh seal of his coming and is coming that would be would be in Bride form before the meeting in the air let's don't do away with the meeting in the air that's the believer's hope amen but before he comes in the and we meet him in the air he's manifest in his fullness in Bride forms he will be the fullness shall I say she is the fullness of the godhead bodily every word that spoke of the Bride down to the Ageless will be manifested in her I actually have a word that was spoke of the groom will also be manifested in the bride as as as it is applied in Bride form now so you see you see um as he preached that sermon he told us that all that God was he poured into Christ and all that is in Christ is poured into church as every scripture and every type pointed to the coming of Jesus two thousand years ago but now every scripture and type points to a bride coming of Christ and that before Jesus comes there will be a bride on Earth that matches the groom coming from heaven as I explained the other day it's the marriage of the Lamb species has to marry species there has to be a lamb and lamb Ministry on the Earth to match the lamb coming from heaven now or otherwise you would have a lamb marrying a goat or a lamb Mary and a donkey or a lamb Mary and a failure of a mule he can't do it species must marry species so there has to be a lamb on Earth a bride who exactly matches the lamb that was here 2000 years ago except this one he's not he's taken them through calvary's but he's not taking them to Calgary he's taken he has taken them through Calvary all the way to a rapture now so that because every person has to have their own dying out to self but now notice here there has to be a bride on Earth that matches the groom coming from Heaven even as Adam's bride was hidden inside of him so God hid the bride in the scripture The Mystery of the Bride it was hidden in women like Sarah women like Esther women like Rebecca amen even men like Enoch amen men like Noah all the way down men like Jesus got manifested in flesh got manifested in your flesh amen well you know whatever it is you know whether it be Peter walking on the water amen sometimes the word will say come and you'll follow him and you'll get your eyes on other things and you fall but God don't leave you there remember Peter amen get your eyes back on me on Christ amen get your eyes back on Jesus look away from your storms get your eyes back on me he will pick you up and you'll walk on water twice some of you walked on water once and you failed and don't lay there and drown come on scream out Master save me I perish he reach out a hand to you and lift you up you'll walk on the water twice you see you've got to look at the scripture they are telling Jesus said since the scriptures he said to the denominationals the Pharisees in them you think you have eternal life Joel Osteen thinks he has eternal life in those scriptures but they are not testifying of them they're testifying of you now Joel can believe some of them see it manifest in his life but it was for you the blessings are for you all those blessings that he talks about is your blessings amen Ishmael was getting a lot of blessings because he was in the camp of Abraham he was born in the camp he was he was part of that movement until he mocked the blessings of a son was placed on him the love of a father was placed on him the care of the tribe was placed on him listen don't get amazed and say well they get blessed out there sure they do you know whatever their faith can believe in they can have that they cannot fade for Cadillac they can have a Cadillac so can you amen they could have faith for a new job so can you if they can have faith for blessing so can you listen it's not just for them these are for you the blessings that lays in the word whatsoever thing you desire When you pray you believe you receive them and you shall have them well they get healed in their meeting I've heard of a woman getting healed you know and and Abdul's mother got healed of breast cancer and oh you know or whatever cancer it was she was healed of it sure they get healed but it's for you it's the rain falling whether you're just or unjust whether you end the word or out of the word whether you're bride or foolish virgin it's the rain falling but it's your rain it's your anointing hallelujah it's your time to Rejoice it's not just Theirs to Rejoice over it's your time of rejoicing so has God hid Eve in Adam and brought her out of him to express what was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh God hid the bride in the word down to the ages Old and New Testament fact of the matter is he says as the groom fulfilled the Old Testament so does the bride fulfill the New Testament I got to preach a little bit I got to preach this a little bit come on Mary Magdalene out of whom has been cast Seven Devils from Seven Church ages come on Hallelujah come on woman who was caught in adultery in the very active adultery and the one who could have condemned you and sent you to hell didn't do it but wrote there on the ground expose the enemy and forgave you of your sins and said neither do I condemn you go and sin don't disbelieve anymore they are they that testify of me sets the scriptures [Applause] they didn't change the clock Hallelujah they didn't change the clock so the bride was hidden in Adam he put her to sleep he put him to sleep for God to bring her out so Christ the groom there has to be a bride come forth from him [Music] she will be a word bride it's just a manifestation of all the fulfillings of all the revelations that others spoke of the Bride you know if she does something different than from Christ the groom and his word it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone in life of his life and power of his power she is Christ but in bright form she's anointed one to this day this is why the angel had to come back and include Sarah the seed couldn't come without her as Adam and Eve were one she took the feminine Spirit from him making her or he took the feminine Spirit from him making her both mechanics and Dynamics flesh and spirit and so is the bride the restored word let me say some things here the restored word did not come to make new churches that we call message churches the restored word came to take on flesh Christ must be in Bride form that's why the Bride is a word bride she came from Christ the spoken words The Original Seed so much she be the word haven't come from him now today some see his presence as we talk about his presence in the form of son of man as he appeared to Sarah as he walked to shores of Galilee and again in this last day and some see his presence only manifested in a prophet and the word coming to him and you know the perusal movement proclaimed he's here he's here and they believe that pivotal Point had come with seven angels bringing the mysteries of God to a prophet and they can actually see and understand Revelation 10 1 that ascending of the mighty Angel Christ some of them proclaimed the coming was over right then but it wasn't the coming that only got him started amen what was that it was to shout amen listen the Bible said in Revelation 10 that he cried with a loud voice he wasn't snotting he wasn't weeping you didn't have to hand him a handkerchief he was shouting with a loud voice somebody with me parallels it parallels first Thessalonians 4 and the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout so that's part of his coming it was God's word coming to a prophet the word coming to a messenger amen and that will that message was proclaimed or shouted out oh well why not come like the denominational looking for him you know that he splits the Eastern count sky and he shouts and there's a voice of an archangel and Trump a garden we all go up in heaven why not come like they think well ask yourself why why did he have to come in word form first there was no bride to take into heaven we only had denominational women Sarah wasn't ready her faith wasn't there somebody helped me preach so why did he come in word form first because there had to be a word to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so there had to be children's heart that was turned back to Faith again like Sarah's heart had to be turned back to believing again somebody with me so first comes a message the word coming to a prophet and when he proclaimed the message seven Thunders under their voices and the voice of God came to a prophet and we heard the shout to the seventh Angel's message and it finished the mysteries of God restored what Paul had brought all the truths and predestination eternal security of the Rapture of the of the of the baptisms that Peter taught on the day of Pentecost and one God all is it was restored are you with me plus the Mysteries that had been reserved for this age of how we got to where we are today coming down to Seven Ages and how it got distorted on how that there's been the canker one Pummel worm caterpillar and Locust but it come in the form of white horse and a red and a black and a pale as the enemy went riding to conquer the church amen but in this day and hour the mystery was revealed of what the Antichrist did to show us our names are in the book and that we are the mystery of that book Hallelujah and restore to us the truths of that book [Applause] same thing he does with Israel he brings him back to their Promised Land the people of the book Return to the land of the book that's the same thing God does for us in this day the people of the book Return to the land of the book every promise so you see it had to come word first the word had to be restored so it begins with a shout a mighty message it's not just shouting that's not it it is saying something it's a message and it comes and revealed through the seventh angel amen where that what was reserved for this age could now be revealed now we can come back to being the bride we were at Pentecost and he finished the mystery of God it broke the Silence with the opening of the seventh seal it reveals the seven Mysteries those seven mysterious symbols of a writer of death whose horse changed from white to Red to Black and finally pale showed us the souls under the altar the multitude without number and the 144 thousand and the judgments under the six seal and the seventh seal broke to silence on his coming but I want you to get understand something it does not stop with the shout and that's been the mistake that many people have made they denominated on that by putting a period this is what God did and they have built denominations around the message on God's sin and a prophet and we're no better than the Pentecostals who went around Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4 and act 2 and 4 didn't go into the lamb and we went around Malachi for malachiopore Malachi poor rather than going into the lab [Applause] the revealing of the Mysteries to a prophet shouting out Vindicated truce is just the first phase of his coming the rapture we learned was it was not a moment when I event that's the body change the Rapture or is coming is a progression it starts with the prophet bringing his message calling out of people listen if if Revelation 18 didn't take place of a voice coming saying come out of her my people there would never be a virgin for Christ to marry they would all be in the Horus system but he can only bring his word through a virgin remember the prophecy is a virgin shall conceive is a prophecy and the bride has to be born just like him of the spoken word of a supernatural birth it's not another manhandling it's not another denomination it's not another thing of theology so someone must listen it has to progress from the shout to the voice of the Resurrection now this is where brother Branham tells us and it is the rising of the Sun of a bride coming of Christ because he's already come and groom form two thousand years ago we're to meet him in the air but there has to be a people prepared to meet him the marriage of the Lamb has come what if there's nobody prepared to meet him but there has to be a bride make herself ready well how are you going to make yourself ready with with how with the truths of the Bible obscured which is the clothes to dress the bride in how are you going to meet him in the garments of the filthy rides of denomination of Creeds and dogwoods and Men somebody with me amen I know some of this may be Elementary but I want to say it so Elementary that even our young people can follow it not because they're dumb because they're just now learning some of them just got to the age of maturity where they're starting to understand some of them just got the Holy Ghost where they can understand so you see someone's got to be the voice of the Resurrection what Resurrection for sure the voice that Christ is alive but the voice of Christ being alive and bride formed think of what I'm saying because even as Christ went into the grave and was there for three days so through the churches the bride was put in the tombs of a of denominationalism I just caught brother Branham and true Easter seal he said I had a Baptist tomb some of you had a presbyterian tomb or Catholic tomb or whatever but you were sealed away dead come on that's what you were in you were sealed away but in this day Christ broke the seals Hallelujah and freed the Dead and raised up a bride and now she can say I am the one that was dead but now I am alive forever more and I have the keys to death in hell I will overcome Satan's evening now so the bride not only not only is the shout promise but the voice of the resurrection showing Christ is alive the same yesterday today and forever until it crescendos our climaxes makes us Apex reaches its zenith with the dead in Christ Rising the bride must prophesy again if you just stop and look at Revelation 10 and style stop with Boy verse 7 you missed half of what the angel is doing the same angel that took the book The open book and reveals a mystery to the prophet is the same angel that comes to John who represents or types of Bride and says take the little book and eat it in other words digest what has been given and he said to me thou must prophesy again before many people and Nations and tongues and King what this gospel must be preached to our Nations I did shall the income oh yeah some of it's bitter parts of it is really sweet I just tell you keep it down I don't care if you don't like parts of what brother Branham said keep it down digest it let it burn within you until you can prophesy to the bones can they live again can the death of the Seven Angels rise will they be will they always stay in the grave will there always be dust and fragments of Bones scattered upon the Earth is that the way it's going to be forever and ever and ever and ever has been for Seven Ages will it always remain there will the church always be like Sarah Baron Baron Baron Baron hope after I hope after hope Revival after Revival only to be disappointed brother Benham citizen what was the is the Holy Ghost given for if you feel the least tug don't turn it away what is the Holy Ghost God in you what is it for to continue his work among his people to bring his church together to bring a church to a place in this day far beyond the Lutheran Methodist and Pentecostal into a place to adoption And Eruption Grace that when this part of the church when the spirit moves in this church here it'll just raise and it'll bring forth and bring forth all this read all the redeemed that's been touched by the spirit the lutherans who stood there with all the light that they had in justification those methodists that fell on the floor and they threw water in their face upon the spirit striking them through sanctification those Pentecostals that walked up and down the streets and they called them tongues demons and and jabbers and Goose language and all of that they'll stand in the righteousness in the sight of God at that dangerous as soon as the Bible stands here if you don't believe me if you believe me to be a servant you call me as Prophet I don't call myself that but you listen I'm telling you in the name of the Lord that those that are in Christ will God bring with him at his coming at the resurrection and only those that are in Christ what amen when the power in this church Rises it'll bring us brethren do you realize them they're waiting on you no wonder Paul would say there's a whole crowd of Witnesses in the grandstand and they're everyone's saying we ran our race we did it so can you so let us run it's your time to run it's your time to fulfill our scripture come on you got to come to the prophet in the water and say to him it behooves us to fulfill all scripture that's why we have to have the power of the Holy Ghost to go forth entering into the third pole the opening of the word the revealing of the Mysteries which we know now was a word coming to a prophet but God was showing the power that lays in the word untapped resources that we have not even barely skimmed the surface of and it's all based on Mark 11 22 a power that can create squirrels it's a power of creation a power that can speak lost life to lost children so power of salvation a power that can speak life to a dead fish so power of Resurrection a a power that can speak to storms a power over all nature amen a power that can speak healing to a loved one I'm talking about me to Branham with the tumor now they're in Tucson Arizona and brother bevinson Jeffersonville and there he spoke healing to his wife transcending time and distance we're a tumor vanishes 1700 miles away not even on her face but kills faith Hallelujah don't don't you see even that was Hattie right it wasn't even done on their faith those children were snickering and going on it was on her face [Applause] [Music] come on Church even brother Branham speaking squirrels into existence it was they was not the squirrel's power to come into existence it was brother brothers free to anointed to believe the impossible [Applause] and I'm talking about a bride in this last day anoint you to believe in the impossible question answers on the Holy Ghost had he write the other day she didn't ask for nothing she was just sitting there but she said the right thing see your attitude toward the Divine promises what brings it to pass that's why we want the right attitude to bring the right atmosphere because suddenly because of her right attitude then the atmosphere would be charged that's why we try to get you to come in the church in the attitude of worship from the from you to the mezzanine all the way from the front to the back amen what are we trying to do get you in the right attitude of worship to produce the right atmosphere amen where that when you have the right attitude and the right atmosphere then you say do the word it's nothing but the truth and when you agree with the word that it's your word Your Truth come on it's for you that you can believe the impossible for your situation then it'll move God on your behalf Hallelujah it'll say to you I give to you your children [Applause] Hallelujah why because of the right attitude in a writer that produces a right atmosphere Hallelujah were Souls come to the kingdom what people who were not even seeking God the spirit of God founds on them and they repent yes you don't know my kids but it's him that's so far away from God they they don't know how to even approach it what about you you happy approached life when you get in the right attitude under the right atmosphere created an atmosphere of faith the demons that have held that that no longer hold them thank you happy now ask whatever you want [Applause] whatsoever you desire [Applause] you believe it you pray you ask for it you will have it I'm not talking about the power of a Baptist word or a Pentecostal word I'm talking about the power that lays in the word that came to us by the opening of The Seven Seals you want to take that and just make it into a Creed and a Dogma into lecture just a dry teaching it's not a dry kitchen good oh let me see I got it somewhere I did but many times it's quoted ah brother Tim supreme power with Supreme deity in action is not screaming and running to aisles and jumping up and down it's not shouting precious words came out of his mouth well precious words came out of Hattie Wright's mouth too that's nothing but the truth But after those precious words came out of her mouth and brother Brandon says I give you your children he said there was a scream come out of that woman's mouth that had been heard for two city blocks Amen brother Ben and said this is what happened when a super anointing came down Hallelujah I'm talking about a super Clerk of super race with a super anointing and when it came down she screamed sometimes the anointing comes down you sit there and weep that's the anointing amen Lord that's the anointing sometimes it rises up you dance the aisles that's the anointing sometimes you scream out glory to God that's the anointing it's just deity and supreme control so anyway he tells us is honey right the other day she didn't ask for nothing she's just sitting there but she said the right thing when it pleased the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit said spoke back and said Hattie ask for anything you will whatever you got whatever you want find out whether this is real or not ask anything healing of her little crippled sister sitting there all drought up ten thousand dollars to keep her from digging in them heels there youth restored your well run down body whatever you ask you ask right now if you don't come and give it to you right now then I'm a false prophet that's something isn't it Jesus said say to this mountain you've heard what's been taking place that's the ministry we are entering into we're way up the road now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got to have Rapture and faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkle of an hour to go out or will not go but don't worry but don't worry but don't worry it'll be there come on it'll be there amen oh you see sometimes you look so can it ever happen don't worry with all the confusion and the strife and the problem can it happen it don't worry oh the shape my children's are in don't worry the problem of sickness and illness in my body don't worry come on start believing you'll never get anything by worrying oh will they make it will my children make it will I ever be healed will I ever get over this back dribble will I ever will I ever be well again will I ever will I ever will I ever don't worry start believing inspire me it's by my children it's for my body it's for the chance it's a commission you gotta have faith in this hour it requires a faith start confessing my children are saved my body is healed hey man my pockets no longer have holes in them I'm going to be blessed in the country and blessed in the city blessed coming in and bless going out amen I'm going to be blessed because God does the impossible math because God is more than evil and His blessings are going to be because I am a part of the pride in Jesus Christ through the blessings are far Hallelujah but you don't know how long I've been bearing you don't know how long my troubles been you don't know how faithless I've been I don't care how many times you found Peter reach out your hand reach back to him and say Lord save me I perish turn my heart back to believing again pressure I'll have to have another part to this but let's get this part now so he says that's the ministry we're entering into they come it's the word well sure it's the word but in that word has power because the word is a person when the word came to brother Branham did it come in a book when it was there that day he'd done looked in the books said I was about to make a huge mistake I looked in the books of what all these letters had said and I was just going to go out and say what I read in the book but about that time he a person came into the room I want you to know the word we preach is not a book it's a person it is the Holy Ghost it's the power of God under salvation I might hand you a book I might give you a seal book or church age Booker hence your Bible but that's not what I want you to receive I'm just letting you know about the author but when you receive the Holy Ghost you don't receive the book you receive the person of the book the author himself comes to live in you and live that word out of your life that you wasn't able to do to believe what you couldn't believe we're way up the road now soon to come into the Lord Jesus and we've got to have a rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling to go out or will not go but don't worry it'll be there it'll be there and when the power of this church Rises when the power of this church Rises see where it's depending on the power of this church Rises watch he says it'll bring its brethren amen do we want to see the debt in Christ's rise amen it can only come with the power of this church Rising amen and when the power of this church Rises it'll bring us Brethren and then the power of that church Rises it will bring its Brethren the power of that church will bring the other Brethren and then there'll be a general Resurrection we're looking forward to it and it all Lays within the word and faith in it rapturing faith your commissioned to fulfill this I know you might look at me like Mary and said how can this be how in the world could this be I I don't know a man and he said it won't be a man it'll be the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost that Holy thing that is born in you will be of the Holy Ghost you can look at yourself and say how can you expect me to be this I can't expect you to do it on your own but I can expect him to do it because he prophesied it would be for this last day amen now what about the bride now well she become that Mighty Army that Ezekiel Saw a people a people who prophesy speaking the word not only fulfilling Mark 16 but also Mark 11 22 for all scripture must be fulfilled turn around and look at your neighbor and say all scripture must be fulfilled so you see brother Branham Saul in the bride in a restoration of the Bright Tree he saw her as a restored Church possessing the enemy's Gates seeing her as one that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against he describes her as a bright tree that four messengers of death destroyed the palm of him the locus of caterpillar that the canker worm but with four messengers of righteousness she is being restored so he goes all the way back and he says justification brought the pulp sanctification brought the bark doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leaf Pentecostals what is Pentecostals leaves clap their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostals now some message churches don't want you to have any leaves but how can you be a restored Church Without leaves [Applause] amen I've been looking at some Barren trees because of winter amen the bark has been there the pulp has been there amen but you know why that I'm rejoicing because leaves are coming on the trees [Applause] Hallelujah I know the end of the summer is nigh I know it's a time of harvest I know it's the time of fruit life is coming in the body it is it is a Vindication to Rapture is at hand Hallelujah amen so we're not going to let someone canker worm come along or look us and eat off the joy off the tree we're going to have joy well amen we want to be able to move in The Winds of the spirit lift our hands up and worship God come on but he said the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and now Christ is again centered himself like that in the cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctuation baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming into the cap so the word has come to cap off the bride the final mystery to the church we have received the Capstone message we didn't need Coleman to come do it or leave hail to come do it the Capstone message came through Malachi 4. the Capstone word with the proof of the sign of the Resurrection the youthful bride lost at Pentecost is back again and brother Branham for ran her coming I want you to get it he's a forerunner we've seen him as that well he was going to forerun to come and work yes but the coming word was to be in Bride form God didn't send the prophet that line you with more books in the shelf of theology God sent a prophet in this day so the word could be digested and received and spoken again what comes on your lips and is an action in your life and you being the Overcomer and the one who does the works of God The Works that I do Jesus said You shall do also and even greater than these because it's going to be now in Brad form in a manifested body Christ's a mystery brother Bradham said Quicken means Made Alive his flesh which is his body and that's the word has been laying there dead for years but gradually has come to in the reformation and now she's standing on her feet oh I wish I had time to go back in Ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and show you can these bones live again prophesy how can the prophecy come only through the prophet it's the word of the Lord hear ye die Bones the word the Lord and this new skin come upon them and they stood up a mighty Army and began to March towards Zion glory to God he said that's him that's him the victory so his victory is not complete until we defeat death you see Christ and I'm quoting from the spoken word The Original Seed Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same because the body is the head and the body is together if Christ is ahead and is the word his body who is Virgin born of the word has to do the same thing that the head did so you see Christ is manifested to to destroy the works of the devil this is why he said when the gospel is priests you're going to destroy the works of the devil in my name you will cast Satan out come on Amen you'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is the word of God this is the promise of the word notice now so who is this son of man people talk about son of man son of man son of man son of man son of man got a whole doctrines built on it who is the son of man it is the word in Bride form where is the mighty angel he come down he opened up Seven Seals come on did you just go back in the heavens and that's it the message is ended it's over it's fine it's going whatever we just becoming a message church and warm with you like every denomination is done just become good church members where is the mighty angel where is the son of man today she has come to empower Sarah to Crown her with perfect faith for a perfect rapture brother Tim the message is about brother Branham about how great a man he was and how great a prophet he was and oh he was a word prophet and and then deifying him well I did the spirit had people looking for him to raise up on Easter when he died and they looked for him to resurrect and come back for return Ministry but I want to tell you God's object was never a prophet no his object couldn't be fulfilled without a prophet but his object was not a prophet no more than John the Baptist was the object in Jesus day somebody help me preach John the Baptist was not what God wanted just John the Baptist he was wanting the word to become flesh he was to introduce the son of man Christ [Music] God and dust to give his life so God could be in more dust Hallelujah do you get it now you are the Dust Come On Son of Man prophesy son of dust how could you speak a word of creation by the Christ that is in me not getting away from my own thinking and thinking like he thought when you think like a god instead of a man things are going to happen hey man come on when brother Baptist spoke with word of creation and squirrels came into existence and spoke Resurrection to a little fish or did all of these things he was not speaking like a man he was speaking like a son of God he could do that because he knew who he was in Christ and he placed the scripture Mark 11 22 for you your ministry amen God's object was never a prophet his object was to bring forth a word born bride a bride who would be born of the word the message he brought as the end times Prophet receives repeat and I'm quoting brother Branham even house the first floor Runner came from the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of God the four the second Forerunner will do the same by pointing the people to a word-born bride whoo did you hear that he would come along and as Jesus said or as John said Behold the Lamb of God he said desperate Runner would point to a word born bride a bride who would be born of the message that was brought restored now so the second Forerunner points to a word born bride she is Jesus Christ in action upon the Earth she under her messenger is the final voice to the final age as brother Bradham said the voice will be in the bride you say oh brother Brandon was the voice of God sure God used his voice to bring a message but now you are the voice of God that goes against all the deities because they only want brother Benham to be that but let me just tell you brother Brandon said told us you can hear the voice of God in the Wind said I saw him in nature he's in the church he's in the individual when a man and the spirit of God moves upon him and there's tongues in interpretation that's the voice of God when a man is preaching in the Pulpit under the inspiration that is the voice of God amen but the voice of God is also lived through you little sister that ain't always spoken either but it's manifested in a holy life in decency and impurity in righteousness come on Church it's there because you are the voice of God to defeat the Devil um so the bride is the final voice under her messenger to the final age brother Branham said the voice of God will be in her United time and science God is getting the church together for a rapture to go to the wedding for a great Union when God and man will unite for eternity when creatures of time Unite with the eternal did you hear that God is getting the church together to be a Rapture to go to the wedding for great Union when God and man will unite for eternity when creatures of time Unite with eternal life it was once done in the form of a son of man the son of man on the earth and he had to give his life to bring about a power to unite other men with the same power for the Bride of Jesus Christ so did you hear that Jesus was a creature of time United with eternal in the form of son of man and he gave his life in order that to unite other men with the same power so to be the Bride of Jesus Christ so how does it happen that sinful man could become the full expression of the word of God brother Branham tells us it's by Blood he compared it to bleach which he called Clorox and he said you women you use Clorox I said I got a tub of Clorox if I drop a drop of ink into that bucket of Clorox now try to find the color what happened to it the first thing it did it hit the Clorox that chemical was so great till it sent it all the way back you can't even see fumes of it or nothing else it's gone it'll never be no more because it's turned back to the original place where it's come from and now that's exactly what the blood Jesus Christ does to sin the blood of Jesus Christ confess your sin upon the blood of Jesus Christ it omits and puts in the sea of forgetfulness to be no more remembered against you at all not where is the church today Brethren if we're born to be sons of God the Bible Jesus and himself into your own voice and your Gods amateur Gods with control of the earth if they call them God who the were the Lord of God come to which was the prophets of word the Lord comes to the prophet and you call him God how can you condemn me when I say I'm the son of God now the blood of bulls and goats could give up power to Moses to go out there by Commission of God and stretch forth his rod and say let her come flies that happened under the blood of bulls and goats he had the word and he spoke that word when he did it it become God's thought of the words of thought expressed and so when God thought it put it into Moses mind and he spoke it it become a word and then Moses turned around and went back maybe not I'm flying the country in an hour from then maybe in a little green fly began to buzz around and a half an hour was 10 pounds per square yard what was it the creative word of God that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man God uses men God could have used the son to preach the gospel but God could have used the wind to preach the gospel but God chose men to preach the gospel and he said what's the matter with the church today there's something wrong my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity to do the right thing for that if God could do that under the blood of bulls and goats and and that only covered sin and made a perpetuation for The Sinner but the sin was still there only covered over what could he do with the blood of his son that omits sin God is Not manufactured but he created a blood that takes away all sin now come into something right here Moses commission was to plague those Egyptian Devils until they let God's people go how many can say Amen to that our commission under this Blood is to cast out devils lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen you'll make serpents powerless and the poison that Satan uses against you will be rendered power Hallelujah let me just say you serpents there's a power in this bride that will render your poison harmless [Applause] Hallelujah and I commission is to cast out devils make serpents powerless now look when the apostles were given the first Commission Jesus started out with the first commission he gave his disciples and he sent him out to go and preach the gospel go tell the good news go tell them the messiah's here after that at Pentecost they were to go and preach the gospel tell them the good news that this that the Messiah had come the Messiah had now shed his blood had remitted sin had ascended into glory and sent back the Holy Ghost and would make you a witness of his resurrection but now when the apostles followed his first commission Luke chapter 10 verse 18. and he said unto them I bailed Satan as Lightning falled from Heaven behold I give you power To Tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any mean hurt you hey this is the power of the Gospel before the blood is shed come on now after the bloody shed is it less power or more power why is it more because now you stand as a sinless Son of God covered by the blood amen able to speak a word of creation and he gives you power to tread on that serpent Hallelujah and old scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing nothing is somebody with me have you went to sleep yet you catch her hour later nothing shot by any means hurts you yes Hallelujah that's his first commission and that's what his second commission his last commission was based on same thing heal the sick cast out Devils the poison ain't gonna hurt you yeah amen listen let me tell you the poison the devil has designed against you will be rendered powerless by the blood of Jesus Christ [Applause] the poison that Satan has put against this church to try to divide it to destroy the ministry to hurt the flock and then we'll be recorded powerless I put Satan don't notice this morning you'll not stop us you'll not stop this ride you're not stop by worship you'll not stop my joy you will not stop our healing you will not stop our Salvation you will not stop anything I tell you I am here as a Son of God to tread on every devil to put Satan under my feet to be an overcomer to rise up above it [Applause] Hallelujah and that's something to Rejoice about isn't it I rejoice when the sick are healed when cancers are cast out when Devils leave our young people and old alike I rejoice when I don't have to bring in and hybridize the message with the with denomination psychology to get them to live right come on I Rejoice it's something to Rejoice I've given been given power or To Tread on serpents and scorpions and open all the power what over all the power over all the power you name it name your sickness name your problem Name the situation is there anything too hard for God Hallelujah is there anything in the power of this church it's too hard nothing Shabbat any means Army can we rejoice can we rejoice Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus said when this starts happening I see Satan like lightning fall from Heaven he's passed out wow every time you paint your position and press well every time you pass him out why like lightning he falls from heaven but I tell you what he said don't Rejoice about just your casting out Devils no I was standing in this Rejoice not that Spirits are subject to you but rather Rejoice because your name your
