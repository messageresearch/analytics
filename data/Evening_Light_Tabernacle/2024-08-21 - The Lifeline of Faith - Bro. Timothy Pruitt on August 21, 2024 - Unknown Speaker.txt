the Lord's done a wonderful work in their family and continuing to move and they have a a couple of younger sons that have been diagnosed with autism and have some chromosomal needs in their body and they said that they're just believing for a total healing of of their body and a healing from this and one of them Hunter has been suffering with seizures as well and having some today so they weren't able to have to you know be careful with him but just ask that we'd remember him and and that need and prayer the seizures but also just a complete healing touch he's believing for a healing from autism believing a healing from those needs and chromosomal deficiencies man I believe our God is greater I believe our God is higher and his name stands above every one of those things that we just read amen amen we want to continue to remember to pray for Sister Jenny Lei she had a very successful kidney transplant yesterday she needs prayer for a speedy recovery with no complications but wanted to thank the Lord for what he's already done in that situation there also we have uh praise report from Sunday I'll just go ahead and let brother Joe Adams give that but if you have a need you just want to lift to the Lord and say Lord your name stands above every one of these situations your name is above every demon of cancer every demon of autism every demon of seizures abdominal pain amen his name is above them all let's go together in prayer amen we just uh kind of an honor to be here tonight to serve the Lord with you I do have a praise report many of you know that Caroline I called her up Sunday for prayer she had a spot on her neck and she's had it there for about three or four months kind of scaly very uh kind of nasty looking spot on her neck probably about 2 Ines long very red irritated and uh and she asked me the Saturday night she says Papa if you would just pray for my neck uh you know it's just not wanting it there it's a lot of irritation well brother Andrew Glover sent me a a quote which I read to you in uh the night of that Sunday morning he sent it Sunday morning right before I walked out so I slipped it into the sermon into the uh testimony Series right there how that that young boy came up and they cursed that thing and you know he come back the next night and all the the eczema or the soris was gone well we woke up yesterday morning and also this morning in Carolina I said let me look at your neck when you look at her neck right now which was very red and very scaly and only just a little dot that's left everything else is pretty much clear so she's about 99% clear so God's already moved and if he can move on the scene for a young child in that need truly to you that came in the prayer line and you that have needs tonight he's the same God then we took it back to the scripture over and over and over and over on Sunday showing that he is the same if he's ever healed you then he's also got to be a Healer today you know if we can just have the appropriate the right amount of faith and touch God you know touch him of his gourment for whatever your need is need for your family need for your home he's the same God and so we're just going to believe tonight for these needs and also let's special pray for the tager family they dealing with two young boys who are autistic and you know they're maybe not like your kids who are very well obedient can understand things but you know they need a touch God's brought them here for a purpose I don't believe God does any none of us are here by happen stance or mistake God brought them here because there's healing in the house of God and know I believe there's healing is preached Deliverance is preached the Supernatural is preached I believe they're in the right place so let's make sure that we formulate the right attitude that that healing can take place so if you got a need tonight let's take our needs Before the Throne father what a great privilege and a great honor that we have that we can approach you Lord Lord that we have seen your sign we have seen your wonders we have seen your miraculous and your Supernatural time and time again and Lord just coming from Sunday

receiving a new kidney Lord that in and of itself is a a miracle Lord they the doctors proclaimed that they would have to be twin almost to be an exact match with just kidney was an exact match to her

we have we love you and thank you for these things in Jesus name amen amen turn to Jude chapter one amen verse three just like to say it's good to be with you again in the house of the Lord and amen we took a few moments and kind of kind of stole your pastor away for a little bit and got him up into some mountains just with some friends and things just to have a few days away and had a good time but we're always good glad to be back to the house of the Lord you know how it is you can go away and have a good time but that day getting back makes you get wore out all over again but we're glad to be here tonight and and um sure thankful um to be serving him today in the time that we're living in it's the closing moments of time we believe we see prophecies that are being fulfilled and and uh so we believe at any moment we'll see the prophecy be fulfilled of the Dead in Christ that arise and we'll be changed to go be with them amen throughout eternity what a day that'll be looking forward to that time just want to look here in Jude chapter 1 and verse three and sorry but I'm going to have to read the whole rest of the chapter here but just bear with me beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered into the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into Las seriousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own own habitation he has reserved an everlasting chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great day and even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh or set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the FL flesh despise Dominion speak evil dignities Yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses D not bring against him a ra railen accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee but they speak evil of those things which they know not but they but what they know naturally is brute beasts and those things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they've gone the way of Cain ran greedily after the heir of balam for reward and perished in the gain say and of core these are spots in your Feast of Charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds there are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit wherewith with without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots Raging Waves of the sea foaming out of the shame wondering stars to whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness forever and Enoch also the seventh from abam prophesied of these saying behold the Lord cometh with 10,000 of his Saints to execute judgment upon all to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly committed and all of their hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lust their mouth speaking great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of Advantage but beloved remember ye The Words which are spoken before the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who walk after the ungodly lust these be they who are separate them separate separate themselves sensual having not the spirit but ye beloved building up yourselves on the Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourself in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ into eternal life and if some have compassion making a difference and others Sav with fear pulling them out of the fire hateth even the garments spotted by the flesh but now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty Dominion power both now and ever amen amen God bless you you can be seated I don't know uh probably just looking at these scriptures and been pondering on them most of the day and or more than that but just especially today thinking about things may be on the scripture a minute a few Services we'll have to see but I I I'd like to uh speak to you tonight on the lifeline of Faith the lifeline of faith and you know as we read here as Jude was was speaking about two groups of people he was speaking about those who even those who started but fell away and and and the angel that were once Angels were were now reserved and changed and he spoke about Sodom and gomorra and how that you know all of their filth and things and boy if we ain't back to where that is today I don't know where we're at because we see the world that is very quickly going more and more in that direction but you know but he comes all the way down in that and he talks about those that are falling away and those who will fall away and murmur complainers all of that but then he begins to speak about another group amen that had been had heard the word of God the faith of God had been delivered to them and and and they they were they were separated they they wasn't on sensual things or fleshly things their mind was not upon the Earth but it was on the spirit of God and the things of God and and and he says he wanted us to keep oursel in the love of God and and looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and he speaks about how that we would make a difference on some having compassion others will pull out of the fire at the last moments but then he speaks directly to the Church of God he says now unto him that is able to keep you from falling he spoke about all these others that fail but he says there going to be a group of people that will not fail that will not fall amen amen that will not go down in the same places these others have went now I understand you can fall you can make mistakes and you have to get back up again but there's the but the falling he is speaking about as living in sin amen abiding in sin walking in sin amen I believe that that the word of God speaks that we can't have the Holy Ghost and do those kind of things amen but the god that comes inside of you will keep you from falling into those kind of places amen but he said we are to contend for the faith that was once delivered and this Faith amen as we'll get into it is a Lifeline of the Church of the Living God but we're so a Lifeline is something that's very important and we'll read the definition of that but if it's something that's important you know you don't fight unless there's something forth fighting about you ever heard the saying that's a hill I'm willing to die on you know there's a place I'm willing to stand there other other things you may allow to just go this way or that way and may not may not say nothing about it but there's spots in your life sometimes you have to make a stand you you have to stand there and you're willing to die on that place because you believe it's worth fighting about and and and he's what he was speaking to the Church of God he said this faith that has been delivered is worth fighting for it's worth fighting to keep it's worth fighting to hold on to amen that's what it means it means to fight to struggle to strive to to contend to fight as in a as in a war the the antonym to that is to keep peace or be at peace or reconciliation or or to tolerate something or just be quiet but amen I believe when it comes to the faith of the Church of the Living God I believe we ought to fight for that we ought to fight Amen to have that Faith that's been delivered to the saint now he says one thing brother M I'm bringing this he says one thing I'd like to mention and something that's gone out from our church he says one of the main things is Faith he says people don't have faith today like they used to have in that day he says some kind of worm or something has got in and eat off the lifeline of Faith it's eat off the lifeline of Faith they've changed it today their faith rest upon maybe a big church or a denomination or an idea or you know maybe your faith really rest upon well I believe the message listen it's more than just believing a message it's more than just an intellectual conception of the message amen I know brother brand said that amen that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is accepting every word for your age but he was not talking about an intellectual understanding or intellectual conception because if you if you if you take it by the intellect sooner or later the word's going to come against your intellect you're going to come against what you think or what you want or what your ideas is so it's not accepting it by an intellectual conception but it's a revelation of Jesus Christ on the inside of your heart that was not given to you by flesh and blood but was given to you by the spirit of the Living God Amen that's what we're looking at that is the lifeline but they've changed it you know a Lifeline is a a line such as a rope it's used for saving or preserving life it's a line along the you know out of the on the outer edge of a deck of a boat that you know like a railing that you would go against you know you can't shouldn't go no further than that it's a a line is used to keep contact with a person you know there's they use it in divers or in in astronauts they get out of a ship in in space and they have a Lifeline that is connecting them to the mother's ship or or if they're diving they'll have a Lifeline that's connected them amen because they're going into another they're living in another world and so it's dangerous to be living in that world down there without connected to the lifeline come on somebody also it's dangerous to be living in this world and not connected to the lifeline amen there's a throne of grace up there and there's a Lifeline that's been extended to everyone that can gra by faith grab a hold of it and receive the Holy Ghost you're connected to that throne and therefore you can go through hard times you can go through dangerous times you can go through problems in your life but you're connected not to your feelings not to what you think but you're connected to the lifeline and it's regarded as something that's indispensable for m maintaining protection of Life come on now it's regarded as something that's indispensable for maintaining the protection of life amen and this is what the Holy Ghost is to the church it is a Lifeline hallelujah it's the connection between the natural and the supernatural amen between you and God it is your connection he said I can't be with you always I must go away but I will come again and I will come in the form of the Holy Ghost and he'll be with you even in you to the end of the world so it is a connection it's a lifeline and that's the very Lifeline of the church is the spirit of the Living God no wonder why the devil fights against it no wonder why he tries to tell us we don't need to move in another Spirit we don't need we just need to accept the word and we just you know it just becomes an intellectual conception why because he knows he can beat you on your intellects but he cannot defeat that lifeline hallelujah amen is a Lifeline of the church it is a connection it is connecting us between us and the supernatural you know and so is it's you know so Satan is there to try to direct our faith to a day gone by or or settle in a time in the future and we lose amen because we lose the faith for today and this is what we need we need faith for today amen you know if a guy's getting out of a ship and he's he's getting out into a place that has no oxygen he don't need oxygen for tomorrow he needs oxygen for right now if a guy's diving down into the ocean and he gets down in the bottom he's not needing oxygen tomorrow he's needing it right now amen so we're not needing amen Divine Healing tomorrow or the Holy Ghost tomorrow or signs and wonders tomorrow we're not needing that tomorrow or it ain't just yesterday amen we're needing it right now amen I believe we have a God who can heal right now we have a God who can he can save right now we have a God that can fill with the Holy Ghost right now but Jude told us beloved I give all diligence to write unto you so Jude thought it was important that he wrote this and brother Brandon would bring it all the way down he says he said now this was for all the church ages but I he said I believe it is especially for us okay amen he says he said it is needful for me to write unto you I I and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith not a faith the faith not a faith the fa faith that was once delivered to the saints that was 33 years before the faith was that then when the faith was delivered see there's only one Faith one Lord One Faith one baptism we might have a faith but we want the faith earnestly contend he said that's to argue for it that's to stand up for it that's to that's to rise up and take it for yourself earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he says when were they called Saints when they were Sanctified and when the Holy Ghost came down and Sanctified they called him Saints now Jude says amen he said I want to ear I want you to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and he he says this and he says don't never let that Faith drop don't never let that Faith drop the faith of the Saints is not in Creeds it's not in denominational it's not in a church building it's not in your Association well I associate with people in the message that ain't where the faith lies amen I associate under the name of the of a message believer that's not where the faith lies but it lies he says in the presence of the Living God in the presence of the Living God they in that presence they had Faith to heal the sick come on now it's direct quote they had Faith to cast out Devils they had Faith to do Miracles all the great promises that Jesus made the first church held that it was the lifeline it was the lifeline and now we got today people saying well we don't need mirac will excuse me yeah exactly brother Joe that's what I me well you mean you don't need Miracles are you not getting sick you're in a perfect body nothing took the body change where you at yeah you're living in a little la la land somewhere what you're living in we still need Miracles well in Miracles there's healings there's deliverances there's salvations that all comes Under the Umbrella of America amen the greatest miracle in this building right now is a life that's been surrendered to almighty God and filled with the Holy Ghost that is the greatest Miracle we could ever see amen people say well if God be God where the Miracles look around he's a god of Miracles he's a god they see that can seal a soul Amen to never go back again come on somebody amen will never go back to the world never go back to the vomit the ever present the everpresent Living God is the lifeline of any church or any bunch of people we're a church and we're a bunch of people here tonight all right so the presence of God is the lifeline why no wonder the devil wants to tell you it ain't a no needing all of that you know cuz he's trying to cut the lifeline amen well he trying to make it into nothing but a bunch of intellectual conception well we got the word now we sure do got the word I agree 100% with the word but I believe if we got the word we got all that's in the word and I can see I can see music in the word I can see singing in the word I can see shouting in the word I can see dancing in the word I can see the spirits of God in the word I can see it all you say well well I got the word well if you ain't got all the word you ain't got the word you got an intellectual conception you're whistling around in the graveyard is what you're doing amen the ever presence of the Living God is here to perform and do and to act and to live with people as he did at the beginning hello somebody me and this time may not get along tonight I don't know what the ever pres of of the the ever presence of the Living God to perform and he just said it was our Lifeline now what what's it here for to perform and do and act and live with the people as he did at the beginning what was the beginning talking about and the day of Pentecost as he did at the beginning if the presence of the Living God brought up Pentecost with power with signs with wonders it brought a people so full of the glory of god Till They shouted and spoke with other tongues and went and made become Martyrs of the faith let us also earnestly contend for the faith until death shall set us free earnestly contend for it amen we need somebody said I will not compromise hallelujah amen they'll look at their they'll look at their closet they'll say won't compromise they're look at what they're listening to I will not compromise amen they're look at what they're feeding on I'm not going to compromise amen I'm not going to compromise on Creeds or prayer books or what somebody else has said hello somebody what somebody else has said there's plenty of other people that has that has a you know brother was it brother Daniel Williams talked about that he said opinions are like noses everybody's got one we all got opinions but we want God's opinion amen you know but he said because why my faith is built on nothing less than Jesus blood with righteousness All Around My Soul gives way but he's My Hope and stay for on Christ the solid rock I stand all of the grounds are sinking say no Creed but Christ no law but love no book but the Bible no Creed books the Bible has to say it the Bible has for because if the Bible does not the Bible has to not only say it but it's to say it every time the same it must say it from generation to Genesis to Revelations it must go in every little web and weave in every part of the word if it doesn't then I got the wrong interpretation amen people want to make the quote say something another what the Bible says come on something somebody if it ain't in the Bible it's not the message hello somebody amen that's what the message came to do it came to bring the revelation of Jesus Christ in this day and he's the same yesterday today and forever so if it's not here and or if it's not there it's not here but if it is the same there then it's the same here got the wrong interpretation because God can not dis dispute his own word if it doesn't say the same thing to every little fiber he said you know he's talking about his shirt he said if it's wo throughout with the same fiber it's what makes it what it is said what makes it white he must have been wearing a white shirt I'm wearing a blue one is but it's what makes it what it is it's what the church is if it's going to be a church born again without spot without wrinkle it's got to be woven with the same kind of fiber that started off on the day of Pentecost I know it hurts a lot of message theologians feelings they want well we got something different now no we got the same material he said it's the Holy Ghost he said it's same kind of fiber that has started off on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost experience burning and weaving throughout all of it hello somebody you can't add a piece of rotten good to it I want you to understand your ideas and what you think it ought to be it's rotten Goods God's not going to have that in his church he's going to weave it with Holy Ghost experiences burning and weaving it all the way there you can't add a piece of burlap sack to it it won't work it'll Mar it but some kind of little cankerworm came in and it ate that Lifeline that Faith off and they begin to stand up that church what Jud was see seeing he's like look he says here I see you falling away and I'm going to remind you what happened to others that fell this way and he reminded them of all the ones there walked out of Egypt with a high hand but sooner later they started they come out with a mental in intellectual concern deception and by the time they got through they were they wasn't they was they was all they was lost and gone and died in a desert said as he saw them as they begin to move and pretty soon they begin to say I believe in the holy church the Holy Roman Catholic Church this is where they went to because they didn't earnestly consent for what was brought there and it was lost throughout the Dark Ages but it was brought back in this day hello somebody that Holy Ghost that Pillar of Fire showed up again in this day and now it's under our it's under our time and it's under our moment to don't lose what we got what's been given to us but to earnestly contend for he said I I believe in Jesus Christ the son of God I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever and the faith and the power of his resurrection lives within me today because he lives I will live also not because of a Creed not because of a denomination but because Christ lives and I'm in Christ and I live by him and with him and I live through him and his life fibers itself through me I love that his life fibers itself through me if I if it don't then I can call I can't call myself his he just don't take my head he takes everything takes my heart he takes my movements he takes everything and he weaves himself into every part of it hello that's what the Holy Ghost wants to do he wants to weave himself into every part of your body he weaves himself into the word and the word can't say one thing one place and say something else another aren't you glad to have a word like that I'm glad no I can read in this side over here that God called me before the foundation of the world and I can read over here and he still called me he didn't get over here and it changed his mind about me hallelujah amen matter of fact it actually it actually if I can say it amen what was the Shadows became amen became reality because over in the shadows of types and shadows you can see Abraham who lied Abraham who done wrong Abraham went down and things he shouldn't have done but when it was a changing of the Covenant the cross of God the blood of that lamb when it came down you can read about Abraham in the New Testament you can't find one time where he lied you can't find one time where he went somewhere and he did something wrong but the blood covered it all Hallelujah the blood said about Abraham it said Abraham staggered not at the promises of God but was strong in the faith hallelujah amen the devil wants to tell you you're still under the blood many times when he's trying to tell you you're not worthy you're not worthy you're not worthy you know what he's telling you you're under the blood of bulls and goats but we are not under the blood of bulls and goats cuz it's not dependent upon our worthiness it's depending upon our lamb and the lamb is found worthy therefore I am found worthy and the life of that lamb can now come and weave himself through every fiber of our body and just as it gave him overcoming power come on somebody sir amen it gave him overcoming power and he was driven into the Wilderness and he withstand the devil at every one of his moves amen it'll give you the same overcoming power if you'll just let him weave himself down into your body it'll make you walk over every devil it'll make you walk over every sin you won't go back why cuz you can't go back can't say one thing one place and something else another if it overcome in him it'll overcome in you amen let's contend for that Faith somehow we got a idea of a weaker Holy Ghost in This Hour we ain't got no weaker Holy Ghost you can get the Holy Ghost and still be in pornography and still baloney you ain't let him come in your life yet come on now he weaves himself into the word the word can't say one thing and then another place somewhere else Jesus said so thank god with that he hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent because it's written that way for a purpose but it because it will be revealed unto babes that such will learn that's God's purpose in doing so now we can take our churches today and look oh well look look at the pentec Al to people look at the Baptist people look look at the Presbyterian well look at them he said look at brandom Tabernacle so just bring it on down to us look that look at even light Tabernacle all of us were guilty of not earnestly contending for that Faith he said a little fuss can come up in the Church of brandom Tabernacle he said I'm in home I can talk about you now okay and now for for a little click and one to get on one side and the other on the other side is is that contending for the faith that wants to deliver to the church does that not that that sound does that sound like Apostolic Doctrine no sir brother he said that's not earnestly contending people go out today and say well my faith don't teach Miracles and they they they teach the days of Miracles are past then you're not contending for the faith you're talking to Devil's language come on they're they they're saying it in message circles now we're not in the season of Miracles you might not be but I am I'm in the season of the greatest Miracle that's ever going to strike the face of this Earth it's called a body change and if he can change this whole body Amen to an immortal body to never die never get sick never go never have a bad thought again how much more can he heal you of your cancer can he heal you of your sickness can he Save The Lost hey I'm not going to talk the devil's language you talk it if you want to I'm not talking it sound like you got Eve's interpreter to me amen he said well brother tell me there there's a bunch of fanaticism yeah he said but oh I know there's a bunch of fanaticism but I believe there's a real genuine gift of the Holy Ghost and we earnestly contend for that believe it he said Saints speak with tongues well I don't believe in Divine Healing I don't believe in a but I don't believe in a bunch of fanaticism but we do believe there is a God we do believe there is a God Amen and he heals the sick hello you scared to let the devil hear you say Amen or something we believe in a God and he heals the sick and he saves the lost and he fills with the Holy Ghost and he brings the prodical home and he'll destroy Satan's kingdom if he's got to to knock down walls and knock down unbelief and to bring them back to the house of God cuzz there is a God well he said I've seen a lot called discernment I don't believe in sure but I know there's truly a Discerning spirit of God and the word is still the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart sometimes you know you decide you feel like you need to do something pick up a phone call and you call somebody and say hey what what you doing this week oh not too much what's going on feel like coming up really yeah I want to bring my father up there my dad get a little rest man his brother Sam Ray push the button was the reply push the button let buy the ticket well I hadn't even talked to him about it I'm just feeling something in me to do something and before we know it we're walking right in the vision of God God ordaining things God moving things and you know he got a little vacation but it was more of a preach he had to preach there last Sunday but a answers were given to needs and situation encouragement came to to to things that he didn't know nothing about what was it it was God saying hey I got a servant for that need and I can bring him all the way over from over here and bring them all the way over here and we think well we're just going up into the mountains we're just doing it and God's Got A Plan the whole [Applause] time Hallelujah he knows how to supply your needs he knows exactly listen if he could send some Raven I don't know why I'm going down this way but he can send some Ravens and he can feed Elijah and he can feed Elijah with some birds don't you know your God can supply all your needs according to his riches and Glory he knows when your heart's crying out he knows when you're going through this is the faith that we have been delivered cuz we got a god woo help me preach it tonight Lord we got a God we got a God who knows when I cry we got a God who knows when I'm troubled we got a God who knows when I'm sick we got a God who knows where my son is who knows where my daughter is he knows exactly how to move how to change how to touch how to bring things to pass we got a god [Applause] Hallelujah the word is still the discerner he said I know there's truly a Discerning spirit of God and Gifts of knowledge that calls and speaks is perfect every time and we're earnestly contending for that the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said I know there's dreams and stomach fulls of fresh meat that or something or another that can cause you to have nightmares you jump up and call it a vision but there's a real genuine vision of God that's right God promised it well that's just for the prophet well ain't what the word said word said old men shall dream dreams and young men shall see Visions amen what are you well I tell you what that was just brother Brandon that's not what the word says sure I understand he was a gift to an age I understand all of that nobody's trying to be brother brandom trying to be Jesus Christ and if you got a problem with that you need to pack up and go to the house that's what we're all about to be like Jesus to be like Jesus amen he said see Jesus Christ is a same yesterday today and forever he does stuff like that and it never fails the Bible said if there be anyone among you a spiritual or Prophet let him speak and what he says if it comes to pass then hear him if I for I'm with him if don't then don't hear him because he's a false prophet God can't lie God tells the truth all the time hello somebody well you got people that they won't even say they had a vision they say well I just believe the Lord spoke to me and he said do this and this and this and they do it and fail and they do it and it don't come to pass well that wouldn't God speaking that's right many people make God the biggest liar there is in the world but God doesn't lie amen God Don't Lie he tells the truth all the time come on somebody so if he call me his son it's the truth all the time if he call me his daughter it's the truth all the time if he called me saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost it's the truth all the time cuz he cannot lie and he will not change his mind he said Paul one night all Hope's gone devil laughing on every wave jumping up and down screaming at him every time the lightning struck he could see him seeing I sink you little Old Ship water log days in days out waves tossing about him walking around dragging a chain and preaching the gospel he says hallelujah he said we can't even let somebody talk about us unless we had to blow up like a to toad frog eating bugshot we're always carrying on about something Hallelujah anyhow then say we're earnestly contending for the faith the brandom tabern the brandom Tabernacle needs a whole lot to be straightened out first he said so does a Pentecostal Baptist that's the reason we're not getting anywhere we're not honest and sincere if we ever came face to face with that thing there that makes us unmovable that's always abounding in God that faith that was once delivered to the Saints but he said that old caterpillar come in that canker worm and eat it off days of Miracles will pass you don't have to do this you don't have to do that if God brought forth his first Branch out of that vine was a Pentecostal Branch with power Visions Revelations healings sanctification justification Holy Spirit the next Branch will be the same thing certainly will every time that vine puts forth a branch it'll be exactly like the one in the first place as I said last night talking with a bunch of Brothers you can't have a grape vine bear pumpkins you can't get a pumpkin to Bear grapes that's true whatever life is in that vine will come out in that Branch if it's directly into that lifeline and he said of Christ is that vine and the life of Christ Christ is in that person it'll be like Jesus it'll be like Jesus it'll bear the fruits of him now a Vine can be grafted in I've seen it done before you can take and you know citrus fruit and graft another citrus fruit into the side of that tree it'll be a say a a grapefruit tree but this this this branch that was grafted in was oranges it'll always bear forth oranges cuz that's the life that's inside of it but if that original tree ever puts out another Chute it's going to Bear the life that's in that tree sure there's been a lot of people grafted into the life and they they they feel it they see it they they they enjoy it for a moment but their fruits are not bearing what that life beared but if that that that life ever come that that tree ever comes out again and puts out a branch and I believe it's done it again in our day amen so we cannot say we got something different if we're still put into the same Lifeline how can we change it how can we do it amen we can't make it something different unless we change the life that's inside of there because we're pulling from the same source that Paul pulled for and pet pulled from and all the apostles pulled from and there was enough life in there they could walk up to a man at the gate called beautiful and he's begging for arms and begging to be given money say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee they couldn't have done that amen they couldn't have had that that thought and that that word before Pentecost but now they knew the source wasn't just walking beside them the source was inside of them Hallelujah and they reached down and they picked that crippled man up and his ankle bones came back and he went leaping and praising and thanking God did I remember that right leaping and praising and thanking God and today we got something different now apparently there ain't been enough people healed in your church apparently there ain't been enough healings take place apparently ain't been I ain't talking about physically crippled I'm talking about spiritually crippled if a if a physical ailment on a man could cause him to leap and pray thank and jump around and thank God how much more could a spiritual crippled you've been crippled with bitterness you've been crippled with this crippled with that and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit Come Over You Through the preaching of the word it ought to make you want to shout it ought to make you want to praise God cuz you have now experiened what it's like to be free so they had jumping and shouting in the original Church original book of Acts somehow we're supposed to have something different we come a sensible way well there ain't nothing more sensible than dying out to your rotten self I tell you what ain't sensible a 10 step program to get over pornography I tell you what is sensible just a moment in his PR it'll be all gone from you amen that's what's sensible I tell you what ain't sensible Amen to go after this herb or that herb or this doctor that I understand God uses all that but don't let that be your crutch don't let that be what you lean on what's sensible is when the doctor says you're not going to live you can look to the word and say God says I care God says I can be healed God says I I can Rise Again God said it I believe [Applause] it that's sensible if you're in the same life you can't produce anything else so if you're producing anything else you're not in the same life what's anything else it'll act like him it'll talk like him it'll Walk Like Him it'll heal like him it'll see Visions like him it'll produce everything exactly his life produced perfectly every time because it's the same life Hallelujah see you're he said he describes it like this you're just a shell a man is like a water pipe he's not the water but he's the pipe and you take the water out of him he'll just rust yeah that's back when they made you know Iron pipes and such you know we probably don't have many of them most of them are rusted now we got PVC pipes then they get a little problem coming along and they bust we want to be made out of the right material amen amen so he he he he he said but he take the water out of him he'll rust and that's what's the matter today there's two many of us rusting that once had an experience hello somebody wow I've read that about 10 times today there's too many of us that are rusting that once had an experience but somewhere the lifeline's cut off once I had an experience he said whatever you do keep the water flowing keep the lifeline cuz that's what keeps the lifeline going Hallelujah this is where you say in Ephesians Church age he said you're forgetting your first love you're doing things that you you you wouldn't have done before and you know you're you're you're picking up things and habits that you wasn't used to do keep the water flowing that's why it's important to come to the house of God to get in that presence I understand you get in the presence of God at home in your car I've had it happen many times but there's something about the word of God when it's fulfilled where two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be there's something about forsake not the assembling of yourself together even the much more as you see that day approaching what day the coming of the Lord but how many we find just this is taking them out that's taking them out that's taking them out before you know they'll be left on the other side of Jordan in the tribulation keep the water flowing even even like Tabernacle keep it where the spirit of God can move don't ever allow things to come in and cause you to just sit back and say well I'm just here you know I I it's just a Wednesday night it's just a Sunday it's I got boy I got so many troubles I got this this happened today I got and before you know you thought about everything in the world and the service is over and you rusted a little bit more keep the water flowing it's what keeps the lifeline going let's stand together I got a lot more I could go into but we'll just stop right there earnestly contend not just contend earnestly contend fight the devil quit allowing him to sneak in and take things and steal your joy and your happiness and your peace and fight him how do I fight him with the word of God I heard my wife fighting him today she was in the kitchen she's been having some issues with her hands and all of a sudden she says Satan you're an offense to me you leave me in the name of Jesus Christ amen it's time that we earnestly contend for that Faith to believe that God can come down in the middle of a kitchen and it all will be over with resist the devil it's time you start resisting the devil don't just bow over to him Bend to his every wish and Way Big Bad Wolf going to to blow your house out no my house ain't built out of straw it ain't built out of man-made ideas it's a house built as a temple of the Holy [Applause] Ghost so how all you want to blow all you want to it's going to take a stronger win resist the devil earnestly contend amen let's sing brother Mike thank you Jesus for
