great testimonies each one of you shared and what the lord has done for you you know when you know god did something for you that's a personal experience nobody can ever take it away there's no substitute for that personal experience with god amen smith wigglesworth once said he that hath an experience is not at the mercy of he that merely has an argument amen you can't out argue now nobody can talk you out of what god did for you amen you've been changed and you know it amen well it's jesus on the inside we're keen on the outside of what he changed in my life [Music] [Music] is oh what a change in my life [Music] [Music] [Applause] one more time now [Applause] it's jesus on the inside working on [Music] [Music] what a change in my life [Applause] [Music] hallelujah amen there was a prophecy that was given to me by brother buzz bosey from uganda he's also been down in ethiopia established a lot of works down there he's in the midst of right now translating the three little booklets that i written i wrote they're not about me or my ministry they're about they're about the message god sent and one of them is jesus the name above all names it covers the godhead and baptism you can ask for it at the library or there um if you're online you can actually write us and we'll point you to where you can get that and also we have the five comings of elijah that explains of how god sends the spirit of elijah five different times and how that we have experienced in our day and elijah ministry and there's one yet to come to the jewish people and then um the other was on the original sin where we spoke where we we taught about um the serpents eden and it's a bible principle that if you get that it unlocks all the scriptures in the bible so um you know if you haven't received that or you would like a copy of it we do have it in english and i think there's several different languages now that it's in probably um chinese japanese um different uh spanish different other languages that we that we haven't and so it's a it's a good outreach that's what i wrote it for it was for outreach but anyway they are printing right now ten thousand copies of each into a uh another language into uganda we already printed ten thousand of each copy in in um another language and there's several of them there and we're putting some into english and brother buzz bosey is helping me with that but in this prophecy he said through your ministry i'm raising up a generation of young people that will stand with my word without fear or favor of man this is true and thou already know this thing because i've even told you of it this is the hour for to call a bride without spot a generation that will see all the promises of my holy writ you have carried out the mission i have laid in your hands and sacrificed all for this i the lord will therefore not forsake thee i will make myself manifest and continue to do so speak and fear not for i am your defense and strength i will make it good saith the lord amen amen and i believe that don't you amen many of you even though you're now in your 40s and 50s you're part of those young people that god gave me to this ministry and and as we we have ministered to those and helped with the youth camp and now many of those are are um now deacons and pastors and ministers wives and lay members and holy ghost-filled men and women uh all over all over this nation because of those efforts and god is raising up a group of young people even now and i'm glad to see this crop of young people amen continuing on and moving on with god amen john chapter 14 verse 1 is where we're going to read from this morning you pray with me that as we minister that we'll just catch the holy spirit some of these things i had spoke about last time i ministered on i'm going to regroup some of those and bring them back thoughts and bring them back in and in a little bit more of an evangelistic way if god will help me john chapter 14 verse 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know in the way you know thomas said unto him lord we know not wither thou go us and how can we know the way and jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life and no one cometh to the father but by me if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him philip said in him lord show us the father and it satisfies or suffices us and jesus said unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou them show us the father believeth thou not that i'm in the father and the father and me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily i've seen you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also in greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name i will do that i will do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it what unfailing words of promise god bless you can be seated now we're going to be speaking on the rise of the sons of the book because i do believe that this is a day and hour where that there is a rise of sons sons that know their god and who do exploits they know their position they know their place they know their calling if you notice philip was saying show us the father i had asked you while we were um you know taking a little time off because some were sick with the with the covet and trying to find out how many were were infected and to stop the spread we we canceled a couple of services and i ask you to listen to the tape of show us the father and there's a number of them any of them would have been good but brother branham preached on this many many times and he would also call it god in his word or god and his people or um you know god in his universe um and he would take four things to show which was god in his universe then god in his word and god and his son and then god and his people and of course he would start here with with with philip's question of show us the father uh you know he was wanting them to show us god you know where where is he and yet they were looking at the father and he was but he was hidden manifested in the sun the father was standing right there in the form but they didn't recognize him because he was dwelling in the sun and people are asking today where is jesus you know there's trouble all around we got more trouble than there's ever been and we are here at the end time where all the evil of all generations it all keeps up all the sin all the evil points right down here to this last day and people are asking well where is jesus you know we we can see diseases and that they hardly know what to do with and trouble in the land and political strife and national strife and and but where is jesus and and we we want to we want to establish once again that we are in the coming of the lord this is the day of his coming if i could if i could kind of say it to you in this way it's the hour of the seventh seal where the silence is broken concerning is coming where god lets us know the day the hour that we're living in that we have reached the end of the ages and and i'm so so um we we want to just say of course that god is not here in the form of jesus the nail scarred body walking around in this congregation this morning but rather god is here but he's in his people amen in his people it this is the second phase of the rapture where and and this people are the resurrection and the life resurrection power lays in them you see because they are the first from among the dead the first after 2 000 years has come for the bride out of the tombs of religion that have been sealed away there you may have had a baptist tomb or methodist tomb or a pentecostal tomb but it was a tomb right amen and they had sealed you sealed it away but we have our people that have risen up out of the traditions of man and we have come back to the word of god again and it's a resurrection life that is on the inside of us and it raises us up from dead works and from sin and unbelief and from the dogmas of the past and into a resurrected life and we're we're people are unique people because we are not predestined to fall and to go down into the ground again as many denominations has that they would rise up only to fall back and become again cold and formal and and powerless but we have been predestinated not to fall you see this bride has been placed upon a rock and it's a solid foundation that the gates of hell cannot prevail against her destiny she has been predestined to adoption to be recognized as sons we want to understand that today because we are actually the fulfillment of joel chapter 2 where that god empties what he started pouring out on the day of pentecost and over and over we have been assured time upon time that joel 28 2 28 is the light of this last day amen i will restore saith the lord in the last days i'll pour out my spirit along with malachi 4 and luke 17 30 and john 14 12 that we read and revelation 10 all of these are the light of this end time where god is doing something very unique and very special calling a people out for his namesake this is the day that scriptures that have been held in silence for thousands of years how are now the the power of them have been released and and are now being manifested as brother branham said in the mighty god unveiled before us he said in joel 2 28 he promised in this last days there would be a ladder rain poured out upon the people in this last days i think the greek word the error is kinah which means that he emptied himself out not in the way we would say like was something was on the inside of somebody that he empty out but he poured himself out now he's referring to what paul said when he was speaking of jesus let's look here at philippians chapter 2 and verse 6 who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no repetition that word is kinah and they took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man so he changed his morphe he changed from what he was to what he is notice what he's doing he he emptied himself of his godship to take on the form of a servant to come in likeness of man so god would actually pour himself out into a human vessel hallelujah so he he never changes his nature though amen but on the day of pentecost he comes and he changed himself from being son of man to son of god now he came not with the people he came in the people the same god to carry his ministry on through in this great age he prophesied in the bible there would come a day that would neither be in day nor night but in the evening time it should be light now the sun geographically rises in the east and sets in the west it's the same sun all the time now when the sun s-o-n reveals himself in the manifestation of the promised word to israel the eastern people we've had a day of gloom we've had enough light in the reformers and so forth to make churches and denominations and just join them and come in and kiss the babies and marry the old uh marry the old himself and buried the dead i'm sure he means the young but they'll get married too and so forth and live in the church and then but in the evening time it shall be like he said in the evening time and no scripture can be broken and the same s-o-n that poured himself out keno on the day of pentecost promised to do the same thing in the evening time it's according to the promise he said get the time together and remember let's look what's happening and look what he promised and then you'll see where we're at get the thing together you can see the unveiling of this great and mighty one traditions are blind to the people again to the great things that has been prophesied remember his whole thought is the mighty god unveiled this is what jesus was trying to do to philip here unveil that god when you've seen me you've seen the father it's not me that doing the works it's not this human being but it is the father dwelling in me and he is doing the work now notice he changed and that's how they missed him he the great father amen by whom the worlds were created amen he fathered himself a body and became the son and even the disciples didn't recognize him you know it wasn't another god it was the same god condescending it was the jehovah of the old testament becoming the jesus of the new which by the way jesus is jehovah's savior that's what that name is amen it was god changing his mask coming in a different form he come from the form of god to become one of us a man for the purpose of redemption then on the day of pentecost he changed forms again now remember he went away and he said i'm going to come again and i'm going to come again in like manner surely we're going to have a great time one day where we're going to meet him in the air that's what believers believe as brother branham said no matter how old the story has been told or the story is he said it's still the truth and that's what believers believe amen that there will be a literal lord jesus that will meet in the air amen but the world won't see him when he comes that way amen but here it'll be the left will be caught up in that dimension in the air to meet him are you with me but on the day of pentecost he changed his form again he didn't come as a man again but he came and poured out by his spirit the same jesus coming not as a man but this time as the holy spirit the spirit of jesus and this time he would come not in a body he created but multiple bodies that he redeemed hallelujah amen what was that it was the coming of the lord on the day of pentecost but he came out not as a man a son of man a prophet but he comes as a god revealing himself in his people amen now in spiritual food induced season brother branham said if he appeared to us in the physical body and looked just exactly like hoffman's head of christ at 33 and blood running out of his hand and so forth nail scars all over him i wouldn't accept it no no no no when he comes himself every eye shall see him every tongue shall confess him as lightning comes from the east to the west and so shall it be see we don't believe in these cults and clans we believe god is the word so the rapture is is coming but i wanted to say to you it's more of a going away than a coming amen it is the secret rapture of the church and every eye will not see him instead we will be cut away to meet him and then after the marriage supper come back with him and take the world over for the millennium and at that time ever i will see him and every every tongue will have to confess he's lord amen but now but that does not keep him from being here amen he embodies himself taking your body and mind my body and gives you gifts gives me gifts and through these gifts he makes himself known that's the secret food no matter how much he would make himself known by me you've got to believe it you've got to have a gift of faith too to believe it amen now let me just get something very very clear because i don't want to be misunderstood this is not that a repeat of the day of pentecost the azusa movement repeated that by going back into death again amen neither is it just a return to pentecost this is a continuation of the book of acts amen where an invincible army rises where sun rises coming and coming forth to take every power that satan has away from him this is the fulfillment of every type and every shadow of pentecost it is when the day of pentecost fully comes amen now in his comings he is coming three sons names let me get past some of this just for a minute and we'll get we'll get right on into it there's things i want to say this morning but he comes in three sons named son of man son of god and son of david now of course son of david will be the millennial reign where he'll be the king over the earth his bride will reign with him son of man was aware that he came as a prophet and walked among men you remember what is men that are mindful of him are the son of man that thou that reveals thyself to him because god reveals himself to the prophet the son of man so he came as a prophet the god prophet right amen and and then of course he comes as son of man son of god and that is and we know through his earthly ministry jesus came as the son of man as the god prophet but on the day of pentecost he came as the son of god spirit amen because god is a spirit and this brought in the son of god dispensation that is reigned through the ages but here at the end of the ages were not another baptist age of presbyterian age or lutheran age or pentecostal age but now a bride age let me just say infancy is past amen he's not taking a little girl to get married to a little eight nine year old girl no he's taking a mature elect lady immaturity is past infancy is past it is adoption age it is a mature grain age it is the eagle age it is the rapture rates amen all of that is culminated into the end of this laodicean age it is the age of the son of man that is why we don't look for another upper room where 120 are gathered and the churches born this is not the birth of the church this is the coronation of the church it's when the son of man again is revealed as it was in the days of sodom and that visitation brings about a change and a long-awaited promised son amen it says in revelation 10 and i saw another mighty angel and the mighty angel of revelation 10 is the son of man dispensation and its anointing now notice that the people of this dispensation are under this anointing they are more than shouters am i more than dancers more than just a bunch of noise makers more than a bunch of emotional workup they are a prophetical class who will be the final prophecy understand what i'm talking about the last they will they are the last prophecy and the last voice hallelujah god in a bride his last voice amen his last sign amen the son of man a prophetical class of people are people who know their god are people who experience their god amen of people there who are who are absolutely a class of prophets you say brother tim where in the world would you get something like that from well listen to the revelation of jesus christ you recall i mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book the book of revelation is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then i mentioned it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing those two thoughts together you see it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real you can't pass it on intellectually rule number one amen it is going to take more than ordinary study and thinking and class teaching and educating a bunch of people come on we turn message churches into educational seminaries until people are dead it's 12 o'clock midnight and they got a knowledge but they don't know jesus now it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means this book cannot be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight what a people with a prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god hallelujah somebody's going to hear what the spirit had to say it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse by verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how how we need to hear from god and to lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know so it is not going to come it is not going to come by educating people teaching you a doctrine come on amen is going to come by the holy spirit dwelling on the inside of you that quickens the word to life on the inside now so it's more than an anuser street a azusa street anointing just upon the flesh and upon the spirit realm it's not an empty jump and a shout with no change of life it's upon the soul and it seals you to the day of redemption it's not temporary and it doesn't come and go i'm talking about the holy ghost it doesn't come and go it abides like it did upon jesus when the comforter comes it will abide with you forever and when it came on jesus it abode upon him it didn't leave him i'm talking about sons i'm talking about the rise of sons amen who are not just having an experience and going back and drooping back down in sin again no i'm talking about overcomers hallelujah i'm talking about power pack amen anointed on fire won't ever burn down hallelujah now it's on the soul and it seals you to the day of redemption yeah you can shout and jump and speak in tongues and backslide and fall away from the holy ghost but only if you're anointed in the human spirit realm that was the problem with azusa street they had to manufacture tongues and manufacture a shout and work up something and it was only temporary but what we got is not temporary amen so you can jump shout and speak in tongues and backslide and fall away if you can as brother brandon said you can have the holy ghost every day of your life and still go to hell if it's on the spirit realm amen that's exactly right amen i could just stop right there for a minute and tell an experience or i had a young you know a young mother there that that that was so possessed with an evil spirits that was upon her she'd have about five children from about five different men some of them she didn't even know who the daddy was but she was pentecostal and every time that you know she she would need another man she'd backslide and go get her another and then come back to church and speak in tongues he was all right one day she was she was in a desperate condition she had started to run off with a another guy she just started coming to my church and she see you know what was starting to run off with another guy and her young son run out caught her and said mama don't do it don't do it said you'll go to hell and they got about a block away and she got a conviction and she called me and she said brother tim you got to do something here i i gotta i gotta have help i've got the spirit upon me that once wants men and said i said well i said i can come but there's got to be somebody there i said my wife can't come right now i said i can come but who's there at the house so well my my daughter and daughter-in-law and son is are here and i said well if they'll be there when i get there i'll come so i went there to the house and i go to their house and and they were they were backslidden and away from god there's this couple was and and i'm going to deal with the young man's mother and and uh and i i i said well you know i can't deal with this with unbelief but i gotta have you in this in this room so i turned her i said take your chairs turn around face the wall while i deal with her and i began to speak to her about her sin about her wrong and all of that and and then i commanded the demon to leave her and as i did she threw up her hands and began to speak in tongues and i stood there for a minute and i watched that and i just kind of walked around watching this oh she's speaking in tongues and as i looked at her the inspiration hit me and i said satan you've hit all these years behind speaking in tongues but you've been exposed now now you come out of that woman right now in the name of jesus christ she took her hands and bowed down to me seven times to the holy spirit within me seven times and claps on the floor never to go back in the sin again it was over i remember you can dance and shout and speak in tongues and backslide and fall away only if it's just on your spirit realm but if it ever ignites that soul that seed gene of god on the inside of you there is no going back you can't go back you won't go back the desire of the world and sin is taken away but now don't take that negatively there are those who also have shouted spoken tongues which by the way is one of the signs that follows believers these signs shall follow the believers that's among believers and we have young people and old people who are getting more than a good feeling on their human spirit amen their soul is sealed and that holy ghost abides with them forever they not only had the stimulation to jump and shout but they got the life of christ to go with it amen brother branham said in the i was at third fourth seal he was said he was talking about those who you know jumped and shouted with us when the music and play and he said now that's all right too i believe in that as long as you leave the live the life amen but now you see the life of christ has to go with it that is your true absolute amen that's your thai post where that you have met jesus christ yourself now this is more than justification and forgiveness of your sins where you believe the message of the gospel a lot of people stop right there a lot of good message people have stopped right there they profess i believe i believe the message i believe the odd sin of prophet i believe jesus savior i i believe i believe i believe and they stop right there it is more than sanctification where your own life is cleansed and there there again this is a problem many people stop right there oh brother tim i don't drink no more i don't even have the desire to drink you still need the holy ghost said well it had to be the holy ghost that took it yes the holy ghost took that from you it was the cleansing power that came and cleansed you from sin but you got to be possessed with the holy ghost or you could go ten years from now and explode with the devil coming back how many times have we seen them time bombs go off well you know i want you to listen to a quote here from hidden life i noticed among our brethren many of you as coming from into you as full gospel people coming from the baptist church myself which the baptist church believes you receive the holy ghost when you believe and that's not scriptural and he said coming to you among you as full gospel people coming from the baptist church myself and accepting the doctrine of the baptism of the holy spirit being a separate work of the holy spirit did you catch that accepting the doctrine of the baptism of the holy spirit being a separate work of the holy spirit you see justification is a work of the holy spirit you could be forgiven of sins past and still smoking drinking i believed on the lord there's many many a good baptist that does that and they said well i you know i i i thought with the man one day brother tim you know i need some advice on marriage he was wanting married for his third or fourth time and he's talking to the wrong person but wait but he said you know i i i want some advice on this marriage and i i've been seeing this girl and he goes to explain and see he said now i'm not needing salvation and he's lighting one cigarette off another it's a chain smoker he had just been arrested the week before for drunk driving and he said now i'm not not needing salvation i am i know without a doubt if i would would die this minute i'd go right straight to heaven you see he something had happened to him he had made a profession of faith but he hadn't went far enough to for sanctification to come and cleanse him so he was still now smoking you know fornicating and and thinking of an adulterous marriage and all of this kind of stuff and and you know because why his nature wasn't changed he wasn't cleansed now you you see but that was but again sanctification is a work of the holy spirit and and so he says except in the doctrine the doctrine of the baptism of the holy spirit being a separate work of the holy spirit so you see the holy spirit must come in after you have repented of your sins some of us want i want to get baptized well the first thing you do is repent turn from your sins calling on the name of the lord amen it starts right there godly sorrow bring forth repentance amen will you dry out your sin the desires of sin and then be baptized in his name but don't stop at water baptism that's only an outward work of an inward confession it's he's only telling that you know you're testifying something's happened on the inside of me but friend you've got to be filled with the holy ghost it is it is the token it is it is a prerequisite for the rapture you wind up in the tribulation with a sanctified life you wind up being left behind with just a justified life you've got to be filled with the holy ghost so we believe the doctrine of the baptism of holy ghost is being a separate work of the holy spirit than just a profession of faith in the doctrines of the message we believe in the doctrine of the baptism of the holy ghost being a separate work of the holy spirit than even cleaning up and changing your manner of dress amen you know you can join the amish and conform people do it you can join the mennonites and put on the bonnet prayer bonnet and the long dress and you know get a horse and buggy you can join a message church come on amen now but to be a part of the body you got to be born in it are you with me so it's more than an anointing that comes and goes and you know it it's it's the holy ghost sealing you unto your day of redemption where god is sealed in your life and listen satan is sealed out ephesians 1 13 let's take some scripture in whom you also trusted after you heard the word of truth after you received and believed and heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom after somebody say after after that you believed what you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise so the seal comes after believing hey man you can't you can't get it until you believe you got to believe it's for you you got to believe it is for this day you got to believe it's for you personally amen he that cometh god must believe that he is and that he'll reward you if you'll diligently seek him amen but after you believe you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise acts 19 2 have you received the holy ghost since somebody say since since you believed you see the holy ghost comes after hearing the word of truth it comes after you believe but it is a definite experience that seals you in and seals satan's out let me say it clearly it makes god a father and makes you a son hallelujah remember the purpose of jesus coming was not that there would be one son but to bring many sons somebody said many sons now i just say it right now because some of you are wondering satan can he might get on your spirit realm and tempt you and make you feel so dirty but let me assure you he cannot get to your soul no trial can shake you no disappointment can shake you you are on that solid rock of revelation where christ was personally revealed to you and let me tell you at the gates of hell cannot prevail against it hallelujah no storm can blow you off of that rock no wave no water no nothing that the devil ever throws at you can blow you off of that rock you're not on sinking sand on this rock knowing me knowing me personally knowing who i am the revelation of who i am that tells you who you are this is what i'll build my church on and when you get there no devil can prevail against you now this bride is not another church who ends up in failure she cannot fall she she is unlike pentecost of 2000 years ago because that was as a seed of wheat mature grain but it would go down in the ground it would rot it would decay and it would bring up a loot or a wesley all the way down but she's unlike pentecostal 2000 years ago she instead is predestinated not to fall amen we have been predestined to hold to the word regardless of what the world has to say about it amen no matter how discouraged i get i always remember i'll have a church and she'll be without spider-wrinkle or a blemish or any such thing i don't know how god's going to do it sometimes but i know he's going to do it because he made a promise now of course we get criticism they say we're pentecostal and we are but not like they want to label us well you know i can already get it you know i i don't like those those people shouting and dancing and rejoicing and running the aisles well you know brother branham was asked about that by dr reed head and he said he said in response to that because he didn't believe that was the holy ghost doing that he said well i can stand this is your prophet i can stand a little wildfire and kicking furniture over before i could sit on an old church so cold till the spiritual thermometer goes 40 below zero i'd rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all [Applause] [Music] well i don't want nothing that would make me cry or shout or dance or speak in tongues or prophesy it don't look like church order to me well brother branham did say we ought to get out of order long enough to get saved and he tells an experience of how he was in oregon one time and there was two little catholic reporter girls that were um were there and um and they wanted to interview him and and uh and he said i caught their spirit just as soon as he come in and said i said all right now what criticism have you got up your sleeve now this girl she pulled out a cigarette and started saying well don't like that while you're in my cabin let's leave that alone so they sat there and she looked at me like she could run through me and she began to talk something so i want to ask you some questions she said he said say on she said well how come you're connected up there with this bunch of holy rollers up here are you one of them and he said i'm one of them after all one of his sermon titles is why i am a holy roller i'm one of them and she said well you mean to tell me there'd be anything godly about that i said not to you as a catholic you wouldn't believe said how do you know i'm a catholic said i know you're catholic i'll tell you what your name is see and who you are and that took her off her feet and she said well you mean to tell me that kind of people they say well live here on earth and be in heaven i wouldn't want to be in heaven with such a people as that and he said he said i said you don't have to worry very much as long as you think that way you won't be there anyhow see i said you won't have to worry about that and i stood there and looked right here in the face and a couple of brothers sitting in the building i said i'm not being irritable but i want you to know where you're standing you're going to write you want to come here and find out some stuff you would never write what i told you you'll make up your own story you go ahead and do that but i want to tell you one thing you write any scandal you want to and before you die my voice will call back in your ears if you duh if it doesn't then know i'm a false prophet and you i just want to say out here on the internet that you that sent me a warning the other day i want you to hear right now amen when you die you'll hear this prophet's voice screaming in your ears the very one you denied the very one you made fun of now go write whatever you want to and i said wrap it up put up your put up your internet accounts and all that why i'ma give us a message and why i left the message i'll tell you why you left it because you never had the holy ghost before you die you'll hear my voice screaming in your ears it'll do you no good now you go ahead and write whatever you want to she stood there a lot a little bit and said well what do you think about that idiotic bunch up there screaming and carrying on last night i said they're all christians she said christians i said sure they're christians they're christians filled with the holy ghost she said that's not no holy ghost i said well what would you call the holy ghost see what she had to say about it said i'd like to tell you something so well i wouldn't want to associate myself with a bunch like that i said well i don't think there's much danger of you ever associating yourself like that because if you're ever associated with god or any of the saints uh you would associate like that she said the bible say i said yes your blessed virgin mary you call her who is your goddess i said before god would ever let her come to heaven she had to go up onto the day of pentecost and receive the holy ghost and stagger under the power of god like a drunk woman she said that's a lie i said hold your peace and turn over the book and i said look here it's right here in the in the bible and she turned her head and said and he she wasn't reading he said you don't even have the audacity to read god's word you're disrespectful now you take your pack of cigarettes off the table there and go when you're ready but i want you to know one thing you write whatever you want to but remember the last words i say in the name of the lord you'll remember before you die she never wrote nothing that's right she just let it go she had more sense than some of these others out there but let me just tell you we are not let's understand we are not a repeat of pentecost pentecost declined and slid into the dark ages we are continuation of the book of acts and we will finish it with the coronation of the church the resurrection of the dead and the chains of our bodies let me quote the messenger they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of jesus christ of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that glorious stand i want you to know we've been seen in the vision hallelujah when the rest of the world was out dancing to the tune of rock and roll this bride was seen going up the same one that was in the beginning come again we have been seen we individually now let's get this individually we are predestined to adoption that is where the person is recognized as a son by receiving the baptism of the holy ghost you come to the altar and you get the baptism of the holy ghost you don't become a son you always were a son and because you were a son you could be reborn amen you could be quickened and non-seed there's nothing to quicken but because there is a seed in you you can't be quickened but at the altar you just find out who you are this is where he says back to you this is my beloved sin in whom i'm pleased to dwell in that's when you recognize god as your father now as the elect church we are predestinated to adoption now that's a different adoption that is the change of our body our destiny has been set and that destiny is a full grown manifested church the elect lady is the rise of sons full sons mature sons who speak in his name we are the sons of god and as sons we are not called sons because god saved the devil's children and then adopted them are you with me we have always been his by for knowledge and but now we are people born of the very blood of god how so because the holy spirit is the life of the blood therefore we are born of his blood thus we have his life we have his dna how else could he write his laws within us you see the coming of the holy spirit in in the form of the mighty angel with the open book as shown in revelation 10 it brings the people into a messianic age where that there is a messianic sons of god upon the earth what do we mean messianic sons we mean the anointed ones of god men and women who have been anointed set apart filled sons the mighty angel is here to to answer him the final work he will accomplish the work amen to oversee it he's here to oversee it it's incredibly personal to him he will not abandon the project that he started then he comes in 1946 and he begins to reveal himself to a prophet and he continues through the unfolding unfoldings unfolding unfolding come on amen and god is still unfolding himself he has not stopped he is still working in his church he's still moving in his people in fact the matter is it's not getting lesser the countdown is own amen oh my now wait don't go back to the invention of the wheel like in luther's day don't be satisfied with the horse and buggy experience and you know uh of of uh wesley's day i mean that's a pretty rough ride you know you know bouncing along you know you don't hardly get nowhere see you know sanctified one day and back down again and heck you'll get re-sanctified again over and over and over and fall down into pornography and up you come again and you got to get it out no you know get beyond that and don't be satisfied with flying around and bouncing you know like the turbulence and of the azusa street you might be flying but be you got to go beyond that be an astronaut amen get out of here you know get beyond the realms of the sense world amen into the supernatural where all things are possible amen now i don't mean let me pardon pause here i don't mean to advance beyond the seventh angel in his message i do not mean that in the message paradox he said there's going to be no more church ages this is the end of it the laodicean age was the last age and pentecost is that leo the seen age and we know that there will never be no more above pentecost that's it like a man another no creature can ever come up from this evolution coming up into higher species and man because man is the image of god who created him and there'll never be nothing higher the word wouldn't let it go any farther because he is the word and neither can the word climb above any laodicean church age so it ain't gonna go beyond this age or this messenger so well we're in the bride age as if that's a separate age amen that's right here in this laodicean age where overcomers sit with him on his throne it ain't another age where some other knucklehead comes up with his own ideas and leads a bunch of people out in the wilderness again oh no it ain't that it ain't a personality cult amen it is saying what the spirit has already said prophesying again so though we can't go beyond the messenger we should at least advance to the fullness of what he taught we're in the stage of advancement not regression where we climb only to fall back down as brother branham said and who do you say this is give me a church that's so completely anointed with god to their ever move in action their action and move is thus saith the lord walk in that shekinah glory and i'll show you a messiah an anointed one of god standing upon the earth we're talking about the rise of sun we were foreseen as coming as brother branham said in the adoption brother we're waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god who will come back and take it over again we're waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top and full sons of god will be manifested when the power of god will walk out hallelujah and take every power that satan's god away from him hallelujah that's what the holy ghost power will do in a man that's what we saw it do in our messenger it took him beyond anything that denominations could experience amen it took him so beyond his peers until christ was revealed in him as a prophet and the denominations were saying show us the father and where and their christ was manifested amen as a son of man in a prophet come on as the word came to a prophet but don't stop there and then revelation shows the same thing as first thessalonians 4 of the descendant of christ our lord is the mighty messenger of his own covenant his covenant is coming as three phases a shout a voice and the trump amen now the shout is the cry of the loud voice in revelation 10. we went through that you know it's the word coming to a prophet in order to get a bride now listen he couldn't take a denominational bride their their class in the bible is and harlots you say white so because they've taken the seeds the doctrine the man over the word of god that's whatever denomination is built upon and so it makes them adulterers it's the spirit of adultery amen a spirit of fornication taking seeds of man rather than the pure word of god and every denomination does that amen but god is calling for a virgin a bride without a spot without a wrinkle somebody help me preach amen who will be a virgin to the word who is not open to man-made creeds and dogmas amen but she will be an unpolluted virgin to the word who has one handship and that handshape is christ come on now listen listen pastors across the land you may be the head of a church but you're not head of the bride come on you may be head of the body the church but you're not head of the of the husband and and head over to women you're not head over people families your head over the church body the local body amen but every person's got to have the holy ghost the head of every man is pastor no the head of every man is christ and the head of every woman is the the man okay i know feminists don't want to hear that so you know if you're not feminist say it you know the head of the of of every man is and the head of the woman is the man now so again a pastor is not to be your holy ghost i preach against sin but i ain't coming to your house and enforcing it that's your problem that's your territory amen but i'll preach it in the church i'll preach against television but i ain't coming ripping yours out i will tell you you're not going in a rapture with one gumming that kind of filth down take this i'm in the fighting mood now again you see the head of the man is christ amen sure the head of a local body is a pastor we got that now but let me he doesn't rule over you tell you when to take vacation or what kind of house to buy or where you got to live or even where you go to church people come to me and say brother tim you know what should i do i said i don't know should i move you i don't know you're to pray over where you go to church because churches have spirits you're to pray over it you're to find out where you belong i'm not too you get a revelation you find out where god wants you amen my ministry won't feed everybody and they can be bribed and i don't feed them oh yeah my ministry won't feed everybody neither will anybody else's amen but there will be a ministry somewhere that will feed you exactly right but now listen let me again let me let's let's get back on track now and bring it back to back to center again on our thoughts you know there again his coming is in three phases of shout which is the loud voice it is the lion's roar of revelation 10 as the mysteries are revealed to the seventh angel and it is the word coming to a prophet so the first thing he has to come in word form because he's going to create a bride finding none in denomination he's going to create a bride by his own word are you with me now now so it's the word coming to a prophet and brother branham told us in spoken words original seed my mission to the earth is to forerun the coming of the word the coming word which is christ so the message is christ i don't believe the message well you don't believe christ it's just all there is to it that's what the message is christ so well i'd rather believe the bible than to believe the message they're one and the same there's no difference come on our bible is our absolute amen it's where brother branham got the message it didn't come out of the book you you want you want to say well i believe the bible no you don't you believe the baptists and their theological books you believe the pentecostals and their theological books well we're not men followers yes you are if you're a catholic you're one of the three billions that follows a man the pope amen and if you've owned one of these denominations you belong to a church full of cross dressers women who are running the church telling how everything is to be done come on led by silly women instead of the bible get a preacher in and vote him out and get him and set his salary and you know and it's reverse it's reverse nicolaitanism nicoletism with a man rule when a man rules over like a pope rules over the church and that reverses where a committee rules the church and one of them is as wrong as the other they're both led by men amen you know i went to therapy here while back and and they they won't know what i was i was well i'm a pastor well okay where'd you go where did you graduate where was what's the school of seminary did you graduate i said same one jesus did now but notice notice again my mission he said is to forerun the coming word which is christ so the word had to be the first thing to come and it was forerunned with signs and wonders to show it was the word and would come with gifts of of discernment which only the the word can discern the thoughts and the intents of heart and it never failed that's exactly the truth amen but now this word would be christ not the corporal coming but the word coming christ would come in the fullness of his word amen that's the first phase of his coming a prophet bringing a message now we thought when we received the message that was it we thought that was the summit we can't go no higher than that but god had more than god sent in a prophet he didn't want a prophet he wanted a bride sure he had to get one man in his hand sure he had to have the seventh angel which is one of the stars in the hands of jehovah sure he had to get him and train him and set him apart from others but that's not the end results that's not all what god's doing and we have colonized now bear with me but we've colonized ourselves in the camps of thunder and perusia and returned ministry until we're organized tighter than denominations and what is it is nothing but another denominational move personality cults amen even but let me tell you the word has to take on flesh it cannot remain in books and tapes he's not going to rapture books and dates he's going to rapture a people for his namesake hallelujah so the son of man would be revealed in a prophetical class of people of bride hallelujah the rise of sons who are the sons of the book they are offsprings of that word they are the creation of that word i have been born again not of corruptible seed but of the word of god that liveth and abideth forever i am born of the word i am born of this message i cannot deny the message because i in the message are one amen now that's the way it's got to be with you you got to be the revival you got to be the message come on not written not written in paper or magnetic tape no not written in books lying on yourself and pictures on your wall written in your nature that's what the holy ghost does he comes and writes the law of god in your heart now notice again brother branham would tell us over and again he said jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man elohim the strong one would come down in human flesh you get it elohim the strong one would come down in human flesh and would manifest himself by knowing the secret of heart the one he was talking to just exactly what his son did when he was here on earth dwelling in human flesh what flesh your flesh my flesh the holy spirit himself coming down in human flesh and dwelling showing signs amen again he would say in the message abraham god would represent himself again in human flesh just before the coming of the son of man what flesh your flesh my flesh god coming down from heaven god longing for fellowship god becoming one with a people again he said see what the here in the elected church is god in your flesh manifested and jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be of the coming of the son of man you see it now we pass justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost the place and the gift of the son and the church now is god manifesting himself for that sign in the message trial i challenge you to believe that jesus christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body where through the bride's body amen a prophetic class of people a people who can hear the voice of god or people who are speaking the voice of god the forerunner would point to you coming he said brother branham was a forerunner that's right he was not the product he was not the christ he was the forerunner but now let me tell you he said as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride so he was for running you're coming now that brings us to the anointed people a bride who is the anointed one the easter seal and if he was messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer the anointed one and god raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day again christ's a mystery he would this time he would come forth he would express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have preeminence in his church the anointed man now the anointed people almighty bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom hallelujah by what accepting what eve turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit amen anointed with that word and when eve what eve turned down he comes back and we accept now what did eve turn down she turned down the supernatural birth and rejected the word what word that he's the same yesterday today and forever that he'll keep his word amen let me tell you his power is the same his deity is the same the experience is the same his gifts are the same he is the same in every detail except his physical body now brother branham tells us in god of this evil age adam's bride believed every bit of the word just confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever and that's where the confusion is today they want to make this something different he's the same yesterday today and forever amen now so just as those in the upper room were charged with the holy ghost and were under his influence even so the same holy spirit has been once again released you know though it's been held back or bound by the doors of creeds and dogmas through the ages and the holy spirit couldn't work because of man-made systems she is liberated amen the holy spirit has been loosed by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ revealed where in human flesh show us the father and where's the act in sans now revelation 10 shows the supernatural descendant of the spirit first god sent in a prophet now god's sending anointed sons who have consumed the book and the book has become flesh so much until they prophesy now when this happened this brings a war because god has is raising up sons for the last day battle come on not kids mature sons amen and it brings the war brother branham said she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the bible said those two meet one another on the battleground lucifer and michael again like in the beginning so here we come micah amen the great prince stands up the seals are open the mysteries are revealed and he's leading us to what whoa you see the gates of hell is against the spiritual revelation of jesus christ being here now the same yesterday today and forever the gates of hell is not against even like tabernacle the gates of hell is not against any kind of local body or denomination the gates of hell is against the spiritual revelation here's what the devil don't want you to get that spiritual revelation of christ being here now the same yesterday today and forever you can identify the antichrist spirit it must be withstood it's that evil spirit that wants to keep christ in a tomb wants to keep him dead wants his church to be a corpse it's that spirit that says christ was and not that christ is amen or that he will be but he isn't now how many things do we put up when the squeeze comes how many times when the third pull happens this is the third pull that's what this message is it is that third pull amen and the anointing they make the anointing used to be and will be ours later but it isn't now amen we got people thinking now bear with me buckley everybody stop just a minute buckle your seatbelt because we're we're going out of space all right but you need to be latched in because we got people thinking if you take the kobit vaccine it's the mark of the beast and if you believe that i just take it from me you're spiritually ignorant and you do you know what you're saying do you have you even thought about what you're saying you're saying if that you don't you're saying you're admitting you don't have the holy ghost and you miss the rapture because you're in the tribulation where the mark is forced and if the mark is forced with this vaccine if i could roll up my sleeve i'd show you a mark i was about six years old when i got it right here on this arm it vaccinated me and a bunch of other millions of kids and some of them died from it and some of them reacted severely from i saw a kid with his arms swallowed way out like that smallpox vaccine five needles going in one time and we had to take it and it wiped out a disease don't be stupid now so you know you you that's not the mark of the beast do you because you see you say well it's being forced okay we're americans we don't like to be forced at nothing i get that well brother tim i'm not a demorat well then you're a publican sinner either way well i'm conservative that's what i am really when sean hannity puts on bruce jenner as a conservative running for governor of california and that's the conservative voice and they're all roman catholic no that's not my identity i ain't of this world you want to make this a political thing or right or wrong or right side or left let me tell you it ain't amen right now the mark of the beast is spiritual and i want to get it to reject the seal of god to reject the holy ghost i've been preaching about is to take the mark of the beast [Music] [Applause] some of you have refused the holy ghost because you don't want to receive it like mary did on the day of pentecost and i'll tell you right now to refuse it doomed you to the tribulation and to miss the rapture and you take the mark of the beast some of you've already been marked with the beast i'll tell you the mark of the beast is upon you sin is in your life pornography is in your life the addictions all kinds of things are in your life it's the marking of the beast it shows the seal of god ain't there i told you this would be rough amen every spirit that doesn't witness that christ is come in our flesh is the antichrist spirit well brother tim i'll tell you i tell you to tell you the catholics are going to take over when we already got one in the president's office we're already our supreme court is full of them and all the conservatives on the radio are all catholics and conservatives today as yesterday's liberals are worse i don't identify with them amen every spirit that doesn't witness that christ has come in our flesh is the antichrist spirit now again these little organizational moves like we've had and lee vale with the perugia the two lord you know two jehovah's all the other things that had you know coleman's thunder myriads of others even so-called mainstream groups have crucified him again and put him to an open shame and entombed him amen and put him to an open shame haven't entered him that want him dead no movement of the spirit no divine healing no rejoicing of the believer no spiritual gifts amen that killed the prince of life putting him to an open shame and i'll just tell you you've already been indicted and doomed to miss the rapture and awake to tribulation amen these false prophets are prophesying their churches right into the tribulation the third exodus brother branham said they think because our churches have become intellectual that we got the best dressed crowds the biggest organization the most smartest ministers that we have no use of the holy spirit in the way it was back there that they're full in other words action speaks louder than words that they're seminars the brain of their being they're coming together the disgustingness are more able with their own intellectual intellectual mind to set a church in order better than what the holy spirit could do they don't need it anymore it's something we don't need today it's the days that's past now isn't that right we don't need the holy spirit to heal to say we got doctors we don't need the holy spirit to speak with tongues we're all intelligent people and when you do you take right from your framework the lifeline jesus said them jews in his last days and you uh in his days he said haven't you read that the stone that was rejected as a cheap cornerstone that all the building is setting upon now you see what i mean i'm sure you catch that the reason of it is because they thought they would never have need of that spiritual boy joseph so they sold him down to egypt we don't need speakers with tongues we don't need interpreters of tongues we no longer need prophets to set us in order by the holy spirit we understand that they've adopted a man-made system to take place in the holy spirit therefore there is a people hallelujah that is elected that has their names on the lamb's book of life i mean they can't go for that they are spiritual minded and therefore they cannot go for that they can't stand it no matter if their fathers and mothers would live in whatever organizational church when a church makes or does maybe it wouldn't speak that out oh no they won't speak it out but their actions prove it here's the word and the holy spirit proves it among and when he gets them gathered together that he heals the sick and raises the dead and speaks with tongues and casts out devil so it depends on what's on the inside of a person indicted that's why he preached the message indictment he said i indict this generation these denominational churches and many of the independents well brother timothy knows we're a small group they're some of the worst us for no more sitting around with pride in our hearts and the holy spirit hadn't moved in years there's no burden for the lost they're dead and cold and dried up brother brandon says no wonder they can't believe in miracles no wonder you can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they condemn it same reason they condemned it back there is the same they reason they condemn it today there is guilty as can be because it's only under the shed blood and those who would dare some little brother who dares under humility take god at his word and walk out there confess his sins forget these dogmas and the things and stand there under the blood and believe it and they want to call him fanatic they want they want to call him it's not good word is used in the pulpit they want but you'll understand he's an oddball and today i indict this bunch of ordained ministers and their creeds in denomination they're crucified to the people the very god they claim to love and serve i indict those ministers in the name of the lord jesus upon their doctrine that claim that the days of miracles are passed you don't think they do it oh yeah they do it oh we're just not in the season for it you know you know it's going to be but it ain't now you are indicted for crucifying and keeping the warts hey i tell you if i couldn't manifest it i'd at least preach it because you're never going to manifest it until it's preached amen healing's got to be preached the holy ghost has got to be preached the power of god has got to be preached faith comes by hearing i'm hearing the word of god and it causes people to believe it's got to be preached when the church allowed herself to move from the original like adam and eve death set in there's no strength in her she becomes a monstrosity the minute the church moved from toward form and ceremony and toward priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the holy spirit and his word that very moment death entered and she started to get sick and as she got sick she changed into a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument she could produce nothing in the spirit for hopes were built on program and not on faith in his word they sowed programs so they reap programs they sowed perversion and so they reap perverted children that's the condition too many places that we don't want here amen but there is a bride in all of this there is a bride amen who has received the spirit of adoption and who recognizes themselves as the sons of god turn with me to romans 8 14 as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again [Music] this ought to be quoted in every message pulpit we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear oh if you don't do what i say you'll you'll go to hell you'll miss the rapture if you you don't obey me you're not in the church amen we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry at the father we recognize and we know we have come from god amen and that heals our father and we recognize ourselves as his sons but not only that the spirit itself the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if we are children oh hallelujah if we are children somebody get with me now if we are children that we're heirs and we're here to god and join us with christ and if be we suffer with him we might be glorified together i hear this prophet say oh brother you that are born again are sons and daughters of god co-equal with jesus christ in his presence oh my that makes the devil angry is to let the church realize who they are let me read it again if it makes the devil mad amen you that are born again sons and daughters of god are co-equal with jesus christ in his presence that's what makes the devil angry is to let the church know who they are hallelujah bride the people who are missed jesus christ bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life there is representation upon the earth now we are adopted sons not going to be we are adopted by receiving the baptism of the holy ghost sure there's an adoption word to it is the change of our body but right now individually we have received it and as adopted sons i've got a message for you get out and fight what do you mean by adopted son once again let me say it adopted satan don't mean god goes out and adopts the devil's children it means that sons who are his by predestination have received power and authority to act in their father's name as his sons and a rule and taken dominion in his kingdom hallelujah that's what the opening of the seals does it makes us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth sonship is not future it is now now we are the sons of god and as sons we have checkbook authority hallelujah oh it's war you know the first thing jesus began to do is is declare war on the devil tearing his kingdom down that's the first thing jesus did amen brother branham said in greatest battle satan's army brings diseases and god's army is commissioned to cast him out there you are every time satan throws anything into you god's army is to cast him out a lot of this fiery dart says hey if you get this fiery dart you're not a son of god throw it back at him and say i am a son of god i know in whom i have believed i had the experience i've got the experience here it goes devil back in your face amen the word of god declared me i am a son of god cast out that is the very tactic god used satan used the army of destruction to disbelieve god's word so now satan's going to come along and try to make you believe you didn't get nothing but that's when you ought to shout back i know in whom i have believed and i am persuaded he's he's able to keep that which i committed to him that soul i committed to him against that day amen cast out reasoning cast down diseases cast down sin you're above it resurrected in christ jesus setting in heavenly places with every devil under your foot amen daniel resisted the angel resisted there was war in heaven daniel persevered daniel wouldn't give up come on and i and there was war in heavens as revelation was coming to the prophet daniel give me just a little more but michael stood up on the behalf of god's people amen and remember he prevails not neither is this place found in heaven amen this is a rapture for the casting down of satan the bride goes up the last thing you're going to do before you leave here is pull the devil out of heavenly places and take that place that's your last job amen and hear the raptured saints in heaven and i heard a loud voice in heaven this is revelation 12 10. a loud voice in heaven now is come salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuse him before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood i thought this was angels no this ain't angels this is sons of god amen blood was not shed for angels blood was shed for sons of god and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by confessing what the word said and they love not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice you heavens and you that dwell in them but woe to the inhabiters of the earth for the devil has come to you he has great wrath he has three and a half years left so how do you overcome how do you win this battle by the blood life that was in christ is in you the same holy spirit the same power that's the threefold purpose of god that's the inspiration i'm talking about that's what god was in christ christ is now manifested in you taking us back to eden and yes michael has stood up he's going to defeat every devil but guess what he's going to use your body to do it amen amen he's going to use your body to do it you know when sister karen was so sick there was a somebody who's a preacher said to me we're praying for you brother tim through this trial i said thank you we need jesus i said we need jesus men that is men who know they are his corporal body and the hands he can use that's what we need we need men we need jesus jesus man that is men who know their god amen men who are know they are his corporal body and the hands that he can use hallelujah let me just share a couple little quotes with you and then we'll bring it down everybody knows how we do here we combine two services into one so you're not coming back tonight unless somebody else is preaching because i'm one and done now if the bible said in hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the truth or it's not the truth if jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he has to be the same in principle the same in power the same in compassion the same christ or he's not the same correct and if he's the same and promised the same things that he did there back there in his literal body he would do here in his corporal body of his believers these signs shall follow them that believe the words that i do so you do also for i go to the father a little while the world won't see me no more yet you will see me i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world those are the promises door to the heart if he's the same he's got to be the same in principle the same in word the same in action the only thing he isn't the same in and that's his corporal body because he's in your body queen of sheba and now if it's the same yesterday today and forever he's got to be the same in principle the same in power the same in manifestation only thing is a corporal body his body is at the right hand of god the father in the heaven sitting on the throne you believe that a high priest and his holy spirit is here which the spirit was upon christ which is god in human flesh your flesh my flesh as the blood cleanses us he preaches the gospel through the preacher prophesies through the prophet reveals the secret hearts speaks through tongues interprets tongues and everything's set in an order you believe that that's only three of many so he's in your body he's taking on your flesh he's gonna whip the devil but he's going to use your body to do it now if michael's fighting then you're fighting resisting turns is his kingdom down you overcome him by the blood life of the lamb now many people think of only the bloodshed at cro at calvary on the cross and and if we're and that's true if we're only talking about the chemistry of the blood that actual substance but no we're talking about the life the spirit that was wrapped in a blood cell god wrapped himself his life his germ within a blood cell built a body around it it was born in the virgin mary god was in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily he wasn't part of the godhead he was the fullness of the godhead in a body amen he came from god from being god to become human to fight human battles and to lead us into victory amen he became human in order to redeem us and thus have preeminence in his people and then take us back to eden now do you know that in order to fill you with the holy ghost he had to first get the preeminence hello one day god's going to get preamble it's going to take us back to eden let me tell you again to fill you with the holy ghost he had to be the main thing he had to be the preeminent one you'll never get the holy ghost when you're exalting your rock and roll tapes and your pornography and your habits over god but when you give him preeminence amen then he becomes your leader amen he would not come to live in you until he had preeminence you young people got the holy ghost the other day he got the preeminence he became number one in your life he had to have the leadership the oversight the dominion to be the greatest to be the foremost to be the chief to be the most important to be above all others he to be unmatched you became a loved slave to him you became a prisoner of the holy ghost where he is the director the leader and the guide with the holy ghost you have the maturity everything needed for the rapture hello and we're going to win don't be a complainer don't be a murmur that only expresses doubt don't let satan crown you with depression [Music] amen i you know some of you are worried about me don't worry about me i mean i'm not having a pity party don't pity me i am not defeated let me say it loud and clear i am not defeated i am not depressed and i am not having a pity party i don't feel sorry for myself amen as sister karen was leaving you know she had blow after blow and we would see god heal her and raise her up again i saw the angel of god and i didn't see a being i didn't see a presence but i knew he was there it's like the wind you don't see it but you know it's blowing through the building blowing through the leaves and here he come with her laying there with her first brain bleeding her sight is gone and she cannot see and a little crippled boy sat down at the end of the bed that had never walked crawled had never been able to do more than just stand alone at the furniture not take a step are you hearing me amen i haven't been seen in a vision yes we say we believe in visions ron spencer brother ron had seen him in the piece and walking we didn't know when it was going to happen because that happened in april and this is june was

back of her head she loses her sight it's there affects the peripheral vision you can get special glasses you remember and that day she was kind of feeling sorry for herself i was having to help her to the bathroom help bather all of these things and she's feeling sorry for herself and wondering what her life was going to be like and she started praising god thanking him for his goodness amen she didn't say and while her in grief she began to thank god for his goodness how good he had been to how great his word was and as she began to praise him her sight came back the holy spirit swept over the bed right there were a child sitting in the middle of the floor having been set there moments before by her mother jumped up out of the floor by himself and ran all over my house that was his first steps she would have another blow and then another blow and you know they would have to evacuate the blood and they would the doctor said you would have been a you would be a vegetable you will never live you'll die in five minutes or five years but you'll never be nothing and god raised her back up again gave me another precious year don't feel sorry for me god's been good to me hey man but i laid my head down on her breast as she was dying i was weeping i made her a promise i told her karen you can go ahead of me if he's calling go to him i'll let you go i'll be okay but i'm gonna stay and preach this holy ghost salvation i'll preach divine healing i'll preach the power of god i will preach it with every breath i've got in my body you can count on me i'll never give up amen let me tell you today be a fighter be a fighter don't do it from a defeated stand be a fighter amen be what one of his saints amen that's one who rides behind the word king of kings and lord of lords through the judgment war and until we meet him there in the air get on your horse the power of the word and ride and weld your sword against the enemy you got a weapon that just fit your hand amen as a third pull sword be a david be a fighter amen know you are elected and called in place amen know that any goliath that stands between you and the rapture has got to fall you want your healing how much are

name of jesus christ possessor of heaven and earth amen our kids are worth fighting for hallelujah your health is worth fighting for revival is worth fighting for amen and all heaven backs us up this is our land this is our book and we are the people of the book the sons of the book are rising because this is our title deeds he ascended on high and placed the sword in your hand and said go conquer your enemy possess the enemy's gates the gates of hell will not prevail against hallelujah amen the gates of hell must be closed gates then a man hell is on the defense and we are on the offense to
