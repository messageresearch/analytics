[56:53] should be every day
[56:55] mother should be saying amen right i got
[56:58] brother derek amen in the word
[57:00] it should be every day not to send her a
[57:02] bunch of flowers on mother's day but to
[57:04] love her and to care for her
[57:06] 365 days nights through the year he says
[57:10] your mother if you want to do something
[57:11] for her
[57:12] do it 365 days a year go to her house
[57:16] and offer prayer and and live for god
[57:18] that's that's the thing to do and bring
[57:20] up your children and when your children
[57:22] come up they will call you blessed after
[57:24] you have passed on beyond the veil
[57:25] that's the real spirit of motherhood the
[57:27] real spirit of mother's day mother's day

[57:31] 365 days a year so we are
[57:35] as the church of the living god we are

[57:59] son if you have your bibles we're going
[58:01] to look here in hebrews
[58:02] chapter 11 and verse one i want to speak
[58:04] to you this morning on god does
[58:06] impossible math

[58:13] nothing will stand before your prayer
[58:16] and
[58:18] wednesday night by the grace of god i'm

[58:21] this is kind of a two-part series but
[58:23] we're going to start here and build it
[58:24] uh it says hebrews 11 and verse 1. now
[58:26] faith is the substance of things hoped
[58:29] for
[58:30] the evidence of things not seen
[58:33] for by it the elders obtained a good
[58:35] report notice now through faith we
[58:37] understand that the worlds were framed
[58:40] by the word of god
[58:41] so that things which are seen were not
[58:44] made of things which do appear
[58:46] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[58:49] excellent sacrifice than cain
[58:51] notice now by which he obtained witness
[58:54] that he was righteousness his faith gave
[58:57] him the
[58:58] the witness that he was righteous and by
[59:00] faith enoch
[59:01] was translated that he shall not see
[59:03] death and was not found
[59:05] because god had translated him
[59:08] for before his translation he had a
[59:10] testimony that he pleased god and
[59:12] without faith it is impossible to please
[59:15] him for he that cometh to god must
[59:17] believe that he is and that he is a
[59:19] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[59:22] him by faith noah being warned of god of
[59:25] things not not seen as yet moved with
[59:28] fear and prepared an ark to the saving
[59:30] of his house notice faith saved his
[59:32] house
[59:34] by which he condemned the world and
[59:36] became heir of righteousness which is by
[59:38] faith and by faith abraham when he was
[59:40] called to go out into a place which he
[59:43] should have to receive an inheritance he
[59:44] obeyed he went out not knowing whether
[59:46] he went
[59:48] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[59:50] promise in a strange country dwelling in
[59:52] tabernacles with isaac and jacob the
[59:54] heirs with him of the same promise
[59:57] for he looked for a city which had
[59:59] foundations whose builder and maker is
[1:00:01] god through faith also sarah received
[1:00:04] strength to conceive and was delivered
[1:00:07] of a child when she was past age because
[1:00:09] she judged him faithful who had promised
[1:00:12] therefore spraying there even of one
[1:00:15] and him as good as dead so many as the
[1:00:17] stars of the sky and the multitude and
[1:00:19] as the sandwiches and by the seashore
[1:00:21] innumerable these all died in faith not
[1:00:24] having received the promise but having
[1:00:27] seen them afar off and were persuaded of
[1:00:29] them and embraced them and confessed
[1:00:32] that they were strangers
[1:00:34] and pilgrims on the earth god bless you
[1:00:36] you can have your seats this morning
[1:00:45] many times when we read the scriptures
[1:00:47] i don't know if i say many times maybe
[1:00:49] it's just me but sometimes we think when
[1:00:51] we read about the men and the women of
[1:00:53] the bible we we kind of get it in our
[1:00:55] minds that they're super human beings
[1:00:57] right
[1:00:58] like their time
[1:01:00] was it was so much easier back in that
[1:01:02] day than it is this day and somehow we
[1:01:04] feel like you know today it's much
[1:01:06] tougher but you know it's not the case
[1:01:08] they were just as human as you and i are
[1:01:10] today they had their ups they had their
[1:01:13] downs you know many of them got sick
[1:01:15] many of them woke up with backaches many
[1:01:17] of them had headaches many of them face
[1:01:19] arthritis many of them face the same
[1:01:21] things that we face today they had their
[1:01:23] ups they had their doubts they had their
[1:01:25] disappointments but we look here in
[1:01:26] hebrews 11 in the scripture reading here
[1:01:29] as we recall this is the hall of faith
[1:01:31] it doesn't mention anything about their
[1:01:32] mistakes
[1:01:34] it doesn't mean anything about their
[1:01:35] failures it doesn't mention anything
[1:01:37] about their disappointments see they
[1:01:39] like us had their shared disappointments
[1:01:41] they had their share of their failures
[1:01:43] they had their own struggles they had
[1:01:45] their own hardships but the bible said
[1:01:47] that each of them died in faith
[1:01:51] see it doesn't say that they died
[1:01:53] faithless but they died in faith it
[1:01:55] doesn't say that their trial was too
[1:01:56] much for them it doesn't say that they
[1:01:58] were overcome by their situation it said
[1:02:01] that they died believing they died
[1:02:03] trusting they died fully persuaded on
[1:02:06] the promise so much that they embraced
[1:02:09] the promise and yet the promise still
[1:02:11] laid before them
[1:02:13] and we find they were just only
[1:02:16] uh exemplifying the believer that's here
[1:02:19] today in this age and i ask you when we
[1:02:23] take our last last breath i want you to
[1:02:25] know god is not going to be looking at
[1:02:26] your failures
[1:02:28] and the house of god should have just
[1:02:30] erupted right then
[1:02:31] god's not going to be looking at your
[1:02:33] failures he's not going to be looking at
[1:02:34] the struggles that you've gone through
[1:02:36] he's not going to be looking at the
[1:02:37] times where your humanity got in the way
[1:02:41] no but when you take your last breath
[1:02:43] god is going to be looking for one thing
[1:02:44] did they have faith did they believe me
[1:02:48] did they take me at my word did they
[1:02:51] believe what i would do what i said i
[1:02:53] would do and because that's what god is
[1:02:56] looking for hillary to see he's looking
[1:02:58] for somebody that i have faith somebody
[1:03:01] that'll believe no matter what they're
[1:03:02] facing some young boy that's going to
[1:03:04] have faith in the promise of god that
[1:03:06] yeah i can overcome yeah i can receive
[1:03:09] the holy ghost yeah healing is my
[1:03:10] portion somebody's here this morning
[1:03:13] that's going to believe i know it's
[1:03:14] mother's day but what better day to give
[1:03:16] homage to the mother than believing that
[1:03:18] there's sons and daughters here right
[1:03:19] now that are believing god and knowing
[1:03:22] that nothing will stand before your
[1:03:24] prayer
[1:03:27] notice hebrews 11 and verse 1 says now
[1:03:30] faith is
[1:03:32] faith is not will be or may be but faith
[1:03:36] is the substance
[1:03:38] of things hoped for and the evidence of
[1:03:40] things not seen and the word faith here
[1:03:43] is the assurance
[1:03:46] can we get an amen on that it's the
[1:03:47] assurance
[1:03:49] that's all you need to know is faith is
[1:03:50] the assurance
[1:03:53] and the word here says that it is so
[1:03:56] faith is the assurance
[1:03:59] and faith is this substance and the word
[1:04:01] substance means foundation so it's a
[1:04:04] sure foundation
[1:04:06] it's the assurance it's the foundation
[1:04:09] and the word evidence is proof so not
[1:04:11] only do you have the assurance because
[1:04:14] it's built on a firm foundation but the
[1:04:16] believer has proof as well that
[1:04:18] whatsoever things they desire when they
[1:04:20] pray if they ask it in the name of jesus
[1:04:22] then they shall have whatsoever they
[1:04:24] desire
[1:04:26] see faith is not something that you work
[1:04:28] yourself up to
[1:04:30] a lot of times we feel like we got to
[1:04:31] get our faith worked up right we come in
[1:04:34] we want to be cheerleaded a little bit
[1:04:36] you know the right song special is the
[1:04:37] right song it's got to be fast you know
[1:04:39] or it's got to be moving and this that
[1:04:40] another but faith is something that you
[1:04:43] have problem says now faith being the
[1:04:46] substance he says and in there we find
[1:04:48] out in hebrews what faith was and what
[1:04:50] those who did it had faith he says
[1:04:53] there's many times that people have
[1:04:54] faith today and guess what tomorrow they
[1:04:57] haven't got it
[1:04:59] have you ran across anybody like that
[1:05:01] better yet have you been somebody like
[1:05:03] that
[1:05:05] there's many times that people have
[1:05:07] faith today and tomorrow they haven't
[1:05:08] got it the next day there's something
[1:05:10] and then there's something else but want
[1:05:12] but when god once anchors it and you see
[1:05:15] it there's nothing ever going to move
[1:05:18] you from it
[1:05:20] so when god anchors that into your heart
[1:05:23] like he did for sister atlanta back
[1:05:25] there some years ago when it angered in
[1:05:27] her heart there wasn't a devil in hell
[1:05:30] there wasn't a cancer that could stand
[1:05:32] there because something anchored in her
[1:05:34] heart and she saw look she didn't see
[1:05:36] the pet scan report but she saw a healer
[1:05:39] and when she went running around the
[1:05:41] church what was it god manifested
[1:05:43] himself to her because faith took a
[1:05:45] whole faith anchored in the heart of a
[1:05:48] believer and there was the devil in hell
[1:05:50] can talk her out of it
[1:05:52] and it's the same thing for us in our
[1:05:53] daily walk
[1:05:56] but obama said now we have five senses
[1:05:59] see taste meal filling uh smelling here
[1:06:02] but these five senses are only to
[1:06:03] contact the human body they're not the
[1:06:06] sixth sense he says faith is the sixth
[1:06:08] sense known to some people they want to
[1:06:10] call it mental telepathy he's but faith
[1:06:12] is the only direct and positive sense
[1:06:17] but we're human so all we think about is
[1:06:18] what we see what we smell
[1:06:21] what we hear
[1:06:22] how's it feel
[1:06:24] how's it taste
[1:06:26] and a lot of times that's all that we
[1:06:28] can comprehend because of our humanity
[1:06:30] but the problem prophet god said faith
[1:06:32] is the only
[1:06:35] more direct and more positive than what
[1:06:37] you're looking at right now
[1:06:39] it's more direct and more positive than
[1:06:42] what you're hearing right now faith is
[1:06:44] the sixth sense faith is more than sight
[1:06:47] faith is more than feeling you don't
[1:06:49] feel faith you don't taste faith you
[1:06:51] don't smell faith you don't see faith
[1:06:53] faith is a substance it's a foundation
[1:06:56] of things hoped for and the evidence
[1:06:59] it's the proof
[1:07:00] that the believer is holding true to
[1:07:02] god's word and it's the proof of things
[1:07:05] not yet seen
[1:07:09] now
[1:07:10] as we dig into this romans 12 and verse
[1:07:12] 3.
[1:07:14] sometimes we wonder well do i have faith
[1:07:17] how many have ever asked that question
[1:07:20] well the bible tells us that we all have
[1:07:22] faith
[1:07:24] so for i say through the grace given
[1:07:26] unto me to every man that is among you
[1:07:27] not to think of himself more highly than
[1:07:30] he ought to think but to think soberly
[1:07:32] accordingly or according as god had
[1:07:36] dealt to every man a measure of faith
[1:07:40] so every man woman boy girl child in
[1:07:43] this audience this morning those on the
[1:07:45] street each of you this morning you do
[1:07:48] have faith
[1:07:50] here you say brother baby says i know
[1:07:52] there's many of us that don't have faith
[1:07:54] i don't have faith to make all the
[1:07:56] promises come true to come to pass but i
[1:07:58] sure wouldn't stand in the way of
[1:07:59] somebody that did have that kind of
[1:08:01] faith as i've often said i wish i had
[1:08:03] the faith enough faith like enoch to
[1:08:06] take a little afternoon walk and go up
[1:08:08] home with him i wish i could have that
[1:08:10] kind of faith how many would like that
[1:08:12] kind of faith well you got that kind of
[1:08:14] faith
[1:08:15] he says but we believe there's coming a
[1:08:17] time when there will be an afternoon or
[1:08:19] a morning walk for some kind and
[1:08:21] there'll be a many on earth that will be
[1:08:23] caught away in the rapture at the coming
[1:08:24] of the lord i believe we're nearing that
[1:08:27] time
[1:08:29] now notice he has given every man a
[1:08:32] measure of faith so within your heart
[1:08:34] this morning you possess the faith of
[1:08:37] the rapture whether you feel like it
[1:08:39] whether you see it whether you hear it
[1:08:41] or not it doesn't matter the word of god
[1:08:43] remains true he has dealt to every man a
[1:08:46] measure of faith so i will rejoice right
[1:08:48] now no matter what i'm going through no
[1:08:50] matter my struggles no matter my
[1:08:52] situation right now i'm a possessor of
[1:08:55] the rapture right now i'm a possessor of
[1:08:58] a body change right now i got the faith
[1:09:00] that i need to overcome the trial that
[1:09:02] i'm in
[1:09:05] so he's given every man a measure of
[1:09:06] faith so there's not one of us sitting
[1:09:08] here this morning
[1:09:10] that lacks faith
[1:09:12] we all have it now some have greater
[1:09:15] faith than others
[1:09:17] others have less faith than others or
[1:09:19] than some
[1:09:20] but we all have faith now this is going
[1:09:22] to shock you for a minute but do you
[1:09:24] believe that even an atheist has faith
[1:09:29] to be a native this is what you got to
[1:09:30] believe
[1:09:32] you got to have more faith to believe
[1:09:34] as an atheist does than we do as
[1:09:36] believers
[1:09:37] because you had to believe that nothing
[1:09:39] produced everything
[1:09:43] nothing produced everything that we see
[1:09:46] that we feel that we have today in our
[1:09:49] society nothing did all this
[1:09:54] my my i'll just stay with the word of
[1:09:56] god it's a lot easier to believe it
[1:09:59] but to be an atheist you've got to
[1:10:01] believe that non-life produced life
[1:10:05] oh my imagine that one non-life produced
[1:10:08] life that randomness produced precision
[1:10:12] that chaos produced order
[1:10:15] i'm sorry i'm just going to stick with
[1:10:17] the bible
[1:10:18] so but everybody has to have faith and
[1:10:22] even the atheist those that deny god
[1:10:25] have faith in what they believe and you
[1:10:26] know what they have more faith than you
[1:10:28] and i
[1:10:30] see faith is something brother man says
[1:10:32] faith is something
[1:10:33] that you have
[1:10:35] now if i was starving the
[1:10:39] morning
[1:10:40] and you can tell by the grace of god i'm
[1:10:42] not i've not gone hungry
[1:10:45] but if i was starving this morning and a
[1:10:47] loaf of bread would save my life and the
[1:10:49] purchase of the loaf of bread is 25
[1:10:52] cents and somebody gave me 25 cents he
[1:10:56] said i can just he goes i can just be as
[1:10:58] happy as i got the 25 cents as if i had
[1:11:01] the loaf of bread
[1:11:03] because what is the 25 cent the 25 power
[1:11:06] of the loafer bread so if i was starving
[1:11:09] i was down to my last meal i knew if i
[1:11:12] didn't get something i was gonna die and
[1:11:14] brother aaron gave me 25 cents i just
[1:11:16] start dancing right then i start making
[1:11:18] my way down to the store right then it
[1:11:21] doesn't matter if they didn't open up
[1:11:22] tomorrow or the next day if i was weak i
[1:11:25] had in my hand i purchased power and i
[1:11:27] want you to know today's church you have
[1:11:29] in your hands the purchase power
[1:11:32] whatever your need is you've got the 25
[1:11:34] cents this morning it's called faith
[1:11:39] you got the purchase power right now
[1:11:42] see if you got the 20 some of our our or
[1:11:45] some of us today we have the loaf of
[1:11:47] bread
[1:11:48] sister atlanta had a loaf of bread since
[1:11:49] mariah had a loaf of bread brother david
[1:11:51] dexter loaf of bread little dru loaf of
[1:11:53] bread different ones loaf of bread but
[1:11:55] some of you many of you got 25 cents
[1:11:59] many of you got 25 cents this morning 25
[1:12:02] cents can't do much to keep you alive
[1:12:06] it'll keep you alive see as long as you
[1:12:08] got to purchase power you'll not starve
[1:12:11] as long as you got the purchase power
[1:12:13] you'll get well as long as you've got
[1:12:15] the 25 cents you'll be delivered as long
[1:12:18] as you've got the 25 cents you will
[1:12:20] overcome as long as you got the purchase
[1:12:22] power you can receive the holy ghost as
[1:12:25] long as you've got the purchase power
[1:12:26] you will go in a rapture
[1:12:31] for as long as you got the purchase
[1:12:32] power
[1:12:33] and each of you right now in your
[1:12:35] possession
[1:12:37] have
[1:12:38] or has
[1:12:39] the purchase power
[1:12:41] see faith
[1:12:43] with it we can do all things
[1:12:45] but without faith we can do nothing
[1:12:48] and with faith there's nothing
[1:12:50] impossible to them that'll believe and
[1:12:53] god has dealt every man in this building
[1:12:56] this morning to purchase power
[1:12:59] now does god equip you with exactly what
[1:13:01] you have needed so that you couldn't say
[1:13:03] well he didn't give me what i needed
[1:13:05] and you fail
[1:13:06] no he gave you what you need he knew
[1:13:09] what it was going to take to overcome
[1:13:10] laodicea so god by his mercy and his
[1:13:13] grace placed it in your heart even when
[1:13:15] you don't feel like you have the faith
[1:13:18] he's already dealt you a measure of
[1:13:19] faith and brother brown will say now
[1:13:21] notice now it's not a myth talking about
[1:13:24] faith faith is not a myth it's not an
[1:13:26] imagination it's a substance and
[1:13:29] anything that's a substance isn't a myth
[1:13:32] it's something that you actually have
[1:13:34] got a hold of it's now because there are
[1:13:36] some people that fail to get this they
[1:13:39] have hope instead of faith
[1:13:41] you find some people brother aaron can
[1:13:43] testify we come and you deal with them
[1:13:44] in a prayer line and they have hope
[1:13:47] and they have hope their confession is
[1:13:49] all wrong well i i hope got to do this
[1:13:51] or i hope god i i'm begging god please
[1:13:54] mr god do this for me and that ain't the
[1:13:56] way you come to god
[1:13:58] you come by faith not by hope he goes
[1:14:01] you hope that you will or you're you
[1:14:04] know you have some kind of imaginary
[1:14:05] faith because that you feel that you've
[1:14:07] appropriated that he goes but when
[1:14:09] actually you got a hold of faith it's a
[1:14:11] substance
[1:14:13] it's something that's real then you hold
[1:14:15] that and that is what brings it
[1:14:18] you hold that faith now now first part
[1:14:22] we got everybody here has faith right
[1:14:24] can i get a show of hands this is going
[1:14:26] to be i'm teaching this morning
[1:14:29] brother aaron's smirking
[1:14:32] so now we all realize we got faith now
[1:14:35] how do we grow our faith
[1:14:38] anybody want to know that answer
[1:14:40] some of you look like you've been sat on
[1:14:42] a log and
[1:14:43] had a bad day this morning i'm just
[1:14:45] going to look past y'all
[1:14:47] he says now i love this this is in
[1:14:49] second corinthians 10 and verse 15 not
[1:14:52] boasting of things without our measure
[1:14:55] that is of other men's labors but having
[1:14:58] hope when your faith is increased
[1:15:02] so your faith is increased that we shall
[1:15:05] be enlarged by you according to the rule
[1:15:08] of abundancy so we find then that in the
[1:15:10] scriptures we all have faith
[1:15:13] but not only do we have faith but our
[1:15:14] faith can be increased
[1:15:17] so now i'll go to the gym brother johnny
[1:15:20] i would have him stand up and take his
[1:15:21] jacket off and you'd see these big
[1:15:22] pythons of arms on demands and but you
[1:15:26] know he didn't get that he just was born
[1:15:28] with that kind of physique and that kind
[1:15:30] of muscles he worked at it and i go to
[1:15:32] the gym i got genetics working against
[1:15:34] me you know but i go to the gym every
[1:15:37] day and i'm in there for an hour about

[1:15:55] faith muscles but i'm saying faith has
[1:15:57] great big muscles and a hairy chest
[1:16:01] but you don't go there you don't get
[1:16:03] those great big faith brothers brother
[1:16:04] aaron by not going to the gym
[1:16:07] no we go to the gym and you learn what
[1:16:10] foods to eat that's going to help your
[1:16:11] muscles grow you learn what exercises to
[1:16:14] do to help your muscles reach the
[1:16:16] maximum potential you do all these
[1:16:18] things you don't do it once you do it
[1:16:20] day after day after day after day hour
[1:16:24] after hour after hour and that's the
[1:16:26] same thing that happens with your faith
[1:16:28] you want to find great big fake muscles
[1:16:30] you want your faith to be increased then
[1:16:32] you got to go to the gym of life call
[1:16:34] trials and tribulations where god will
[1:16:36] take you from one test to another test
[1:16:38] and he'll remain faithful in this test
[1:16:40] and your faith will increase to the next
[1:16:42] test on to the next test and when you
[1:16:44] face these little simple things god will
[1:16:45] bring into a great big trial and it may
[1:16:47] be for your healing of your body but yet
[1:16:49] god remains faithful and he's giving you
[1:16:52] great big faith muscles
[1:16:53] [Applause]
[1:16:55] and your faith is increasing
[1:16:58] when sister atlanta got healed sister
[1:17:00] moriah got here what did it do for our
[1:17:02] church
[1:17:03] the faith of this church elevated
[1:17:08] it elephant all of us stepped up our
[1:17:10] muscles grew
[1:17:12] we knew right then if god could do that
[1:17:14] for sister atlanta if god could do that
[1:17:16] for sister moriah if god could do that
[1:17:18] for brother david if god could do that
[1:17:20] for little drew what could god do for us
[1:17:24] oh god let our faith muscles go this
[1:17:26] morning
[1:17:30] notice now
[1:17:32] we can have faith for the healing of the
[1:17:34] body
[1:17:35] we can have faith for the direction of a
[1:17:36] job
[1:17:38] we can have faith from deliverance of
[1:17:39] atonement and spirit
[1:17:41] and god intends
[1:17:43] for our muscles our faith muscles to
[1:17:45] grow
[1:17:46] but how do they grow
[1:17:48] see god says in his word he's looking
[1:17:50] for one thing when the son of man
[1:17:52] returns he's looking for one thing
[1:17:54] he's not looking for all your accolades
[1:17:56] he's not looking for how many souls you
[1:17:58] won
[1:17:59] he's not looking for how many trips you
[1:18:00] took overseas he's not looking for how
[1:18:02] many how many times you preach the
[1:18:04] gospel he's not looking for those and
[1:18:05] he's looking for one thing shall the son
[1:18:08] of man find faith
[1:18:11] faith for your own personal struggle
[1:18:13] faith for your own personal healing will
[1:18:16] you find will he find faith will he find
[1:18:18] a young man that'll lay it all down and
[1:18:20] go and turn his his back from the things
[1:18:23] of the world and give his heart solely
[1:18:25] committed to god will he find a young
[1:18:27] woman he'll give it all up knowing that
[1:18:29] the devil would love to take her and
[1:18:31] just use her for a billboard of his own
[1:18:33] glory but god has got a hold of that
[1:18:35] heart and she's turned it all down to be
[1:18:37] a love slave to him he's looking for
[1:18:39] somebody that'll occupy faith
[1:18:44] so now
[1:18:46] he's looking for somebody god is looking
[1:18:48] for faith he's looking for a man a woman
[1:18:50] a boy a girl that'll believe
[1:18:53] god doesn't want your faith to diminish
[1:18:56] he doesn't want your faith to wither up
[1:18:58] he doesn't want you to get to a place
[1:18:59] where you you can hardly ever believe
[1:19:01] for anything he wants you to believe he
[1:19:03] wants you to trust him he wants you to
[1:19:05] obey him he wants you to have confidence
[1:19:08] in his word and not only that but in the
[1:19:12] direction that he has for your life
[1:19:15] i said it once before and i'll say it
[1:19:16] again god has jurisdiction over your
[1:19:20] life not the devil
[1:19:24] god does jurisdiction rulership
[1:19:27] leadership guidance over every one of
[1:19:30] our sometimes it looks like our life is
[1:19:32] in chaos doesn't it
[1:19:33] like every day you wake up it's like
[1:19:35] another trouble but i want you to know
[1:19:37] god is in control god has jurisdiction
[1:19:40] god knows what he's doing and god
[1:19:42] because god knew these things would that
[1:19:44] you would come through he planted inside
[1:19:46] that little heart of yours faith
[1:19:50] faith comes by hearing
[1:19:52] we find here in romans 10 and verse 17
[1:19:55] so then faith cometh by hearing
[1:19:58] and hearing by the word of god notice
[1:20:01] what you got to feed on
[1:20:03] so we have been provided in our day over
[1:20:05] 1200 sermons
[1:20:07] there's no reason no excuse for you to
[1:20:09] say i can't be fed
[1:20:11] i don't have faith or my faith is weak
[1:20:14] my faith isn't much you got 1200 sermons
[1:20:17] not only that god ordained in his
[1:20:19] scripture in the word that he's given
[1:20:21] some apostles preachers teachers
[1:20:22] evangelists and missionaries he's given
[1:20:24] a fifo ministry for what for the
[1:20:26] edifying of the church
[1:20:28] for the building up of the body see it's
[1:20:30] imperative that we are feeding on the
[1:20:33] right things it's imperative that we are
[1:20:35] hearing the right things we don't need
[1:20:37] to be you know for our faith to increase
[1:20:40] and we got to make sure that we're
[1:20:41] feeding on the things that would
[1:20:42] increase our faith and not deplete our
[1:20:44] faith
[1:20:47] you find a difficult situation you're in
[1:20:49] a battle
[1:20:50] last thing you want to do is go surround
[1:20:51] yourself with negative people
[1:20:55] right
[1:20:57] say you got cancer this morning last
[1:20:59] thing you want to do is go find a bunch
[1:21:01] of negative nancies
[1:21:03] excuse me sister nancy
[1:21:05] that's just a phrase you know i'm not
[1:21:08] oh my i better just keep on preaching
[1:21:10] she'll shut down on me and i'll be
[1:21:12] digging out of this whole rest of the
[1:21:13] service
[1:21:16] but the last thing you want to do is
[1:21:18] surround yourself with negative people
[1:21:20] and negativity
[1:21:22] see negativity breeds doubt
[1:21:25] and
[1:21:26] unbelief and you can never rise up and
[1:21:29] take the promise with a negative
[1:21:31] confession
[1:21:32] okay doubt and unbelief well not only
[1:21:35] what i'm gonna do it'll only hold the
[1:21:36] promise out here a little bit longer
[1:21:38] a little bit longer it's like a carrot
[1:21:40] on end of a stick you know how to get a
[1:21:41] donkey to move you put a carrot in the
[1:21:43] stick and you just hang in front of him
[1:21:44] he's going to go wherever that carrot
[1:21:45] moves he never gets to taste it and all
[1:21:47] he gets to do is smell it and a lot of
[1:21:49] times that's what faith or not faith
[1:21:50] that's what doubt and unbelief is to the
[1:21:52] believer he's just hanging out there to
[1:21:54] get you to go this way and this way and
[1:21:56] you're doubting this and you're doubting
[1:21:57] that when god's given you a promise but
[1:21:59] see if doubt and non-belief will ever
[1:22:01] take hold of the promise of god there's
[1:22:03] nothing that the devil can do at that
[1:22:05] point to keep it from you
[1:22:07] so you may have faith for somebody else
[1:22:10] and some of us do it's easy to believe
[1:22:12] for somebody else right
[1:22:14] man you could it's easier yeah you're
[1:22:15] exactly right man you get on the on your
[1:22:17] knees you begin to go to battle and you
[1:22:18] begin to go to pray there's not a doubt
[1:22:20] and a shadow of doubt in the world that
[1:22:22] that person is going to be delivered or
[1:22:24] set free or healed or whatever it may be
[1:22:26] but we find if you're around negativity
[1:22:28] and you're around negative people and
[1:22:30] you have this own negative connotation
[1:22:31] to your own life then what you find is
[1:22:33] doubt and unbelief will be well god can
[1:22:35] do it for them but i'm not sure if god
[1:22:38] will do it for me not that he can do it
[1:22:40] but that he will do it for me
[1:22:43] we know that he can because he's already
[1:22:45] he's already expressed it once or twice
[1:22:47] or three or four or many times before
[1:22:49] but will god do it for me see you need
[1:22:52] to surround yourself with people that
[1:22:54] will lift you up
[1:22:57] those that will encourage you those that
[1:22:59] will be praying for you when you're in a
[1:23:01] great big battle in a great big trial
[1:23:03] you don't need job's friends
[1:23:08] you don't need those oh yeah you you're
[1:23:10] a secret center buddy you done done this
[1:23:12] uh-huh you just need to go confession
[1:23:14] it's good for the soap here's my
[1:23:16] shoulder go on and confess cry boo-hoo
[1:23:17] and all that no you need to find
[1:23:19] somebody like a caleb and a joshua we're
[1:23:21] well able to take the land
[1:23:23] i know what you're going through we're
[1:23:25] well labeled god's already vindicated if
[1:23:27] he can heal cancer he can take care of
[1:23:29] your knee if he can heal alopecia he can
[1:23:31] take care of that situation if he can
[1:23:33] bring a wayward son back wake him up in
[1:23:35] the middle of the night and bring him to
[1:23:36] church in his bazaar let me tell you god
[1:23:38] can do it for your situation god can do
[1:23:40] it for your prodigal god's not stopped
[1:23:42] being god he's just looking for somebody
[1:23:44] that'll grab hold of the horns of us and
[1:23:46] believe this morning
[1:23:51] so notice now your faith is what saves
[1:23:54] you
[1:23:55] and i'm going to say something else your
[1:23:56] faith is what keeps you saved
[1:24:00] praise the lord
[1:24:01] now romans 10 and verse 14
[1:24:03] and then shall they call upon him who
[1:24:05] they have not believed and how shall
[1:24:07] they believe in him whom they have not
[1:24:09] heard and how shall they hear without a
[1:24:12] preacher
[1:24:13] so we got to have preaching as much as
[1:24:15] those that are trying to shut down the
[1:24:16] ministry we got to have preaching it's
[1:24:18] ordained of god because what does
[1:24:20] preaching do it brings the faith of the
[1:24:22] people up that they can attain to the
[1:24:25] promise of god
[1:24:27] and it also directs god's able to take
[1:24:29] that ministry and direct thoughts
[1:24:32] and direct things to certain needs and
[1:24:34] minister to your need in your own
[1:24:36] personal way and god can speak expressly
[1:24:39] to you
[1:24:41] now i'm a proponent of push and play but
[1:24:44] i do that in my car i do that in my
[1:24:45] study i do that when i'm at the gym i do
[1:24:48] that when i'm on the treadmill i push
[1:24:50] play a lot i'm feeding on the word of
[1:24:51] god but it's not a substitute for what
[1:24:54] you get right here anointed preaching
[1:24:57] coming down like a surgeon with the
[1:24:59] precision to be able to cut out
[1:25:04] allow your faith to rise up
[1:25:06] to cut out situations and circumstances
[1:25:08] and things from our lives
[1:25:10] first corinthians 1 verse 18 for the
[1:25:12] preaching of the cross is to them that
[1:25:14] perish foolishness but unto us which are
[1:25:17] saved it is the power of god
[1:25:21] for it is written i will destroy the
[1:25:23] wisdom of the wise i will bring to
[1:25:24] nothing the understanding of the prudent
[1:25:27] where is the wise where is the scribe
[1:25:29] where is the disputer of this world hath
[1:25:32] not god made the foolish the wisdom of
[1:25:35] this world for after that in the wisdom
[1:25:38] of god the world by wisdom knew not god
[1:25:41] it pleased god by the foolishness of
[1:25:44] preaching to save them that believe
[1:25:47] otherwise it's through the foolishness
[1:25:49] of preaching it saves those that has
[1:25:51] faith in what is being preached
[1:25:56] so god has ordained a prescribed method
[1:25:59] and we find that it's your faith in that
[1:26:02] prescription that saves you
[1:26:05] how shall they believe unless there be a
[1:26:07] preacher i'm not saying that we need to
[1:26:09] put our faith in a man because we don't
[1:26:10] want to put our faith in any one man but
[1:26:12] we put our faith in what that man is
[1:26:14] preaching that it is for me it is a word
[1:26:16] of god i believe it and so what good is
[1:26:19] faith you may ask brother joe i made it
[1:26:20] this far without faith no you didn't
[1:26:23] but what good is faith with faith you
[1:26:24] can be healed this morning with faith
[1:26:26] you can be delivered this morning with
[1:26:28] faith you can be set free this morning
[1:26:30] with faith you can overcome this morning
[1:26:32] with faith you can take a rapture this
[1:26:33] morning but without faith you're bound
[1:26:36] for hell
[1:26:37] or at best a tribulation
[1:26:40] so your faith is what saves you brother
[1:26:43] i'm gonna say it like this and it's your
[1:26:44] personal faith in the finished work at
[1:26:47] calvary or of christ at calvary that
[1:26:49] brings both salvation and healings
[1:26:54] he says now he was a little earlier in
[1:26:56] this same
[1:26:57] line of thought here in the message can
[1:26:59] we see jesus he says now if a man can
[1:27:01] heal you he can also save you because
[1:27:03] it's the same atonement
[1:27:05] so nor is brother branham a divine
[1:27:07] healer because if he was a divine healer
[1:27:08] then he would have to be a divine savior
[1:27:10] and there's only one divine savior which
[1:27:12] is jesus christ therefore our faith
[1:27:14] doesn't rest in a man it rests in him
[1:27:17] who made the sacrifice
[1:27:20] but our faith
[1:27:22] rests in the work of redemption our
[1:27:25] faith rests in the preaching of the
[1:27:27] gospel our faith
[1:27:29] lays in that he says now
[1:27:31] and then your personal faith in that
[1:27:34] finished work draws the remuneration
[1:27:37] remuneration from what he did at calvary
[1:27:40] so it draws from god your your faith
[1:27:42] draws dividends from god's work
[1:27:46] it brings the substance it brings the
[1:27:48] reality to you to your home to your need
[1:27:51] to your struggle to your situation your
[1:27:54] faith not somebody else's faith your
[1:27:56] faith in the promise
[1:27:58] now we look here in ephesians 2 and
[1:28:00] verse 8 am i going okay this morning
[1:28:04] this is teaching now
[1:28:09] ephesians 2 and verse 8.
[1:28:12] for by grace are you saved
[1:28:15] notice through faith
[1:28:18] so it's your faith that saves you
[1:28:21] so by grace are you saved through faith
[1:28:24] and not of your i love how god said you
[1:28:26] know what god's like i'm taking man
[1:28:27] completely out of the equation you've
[1:28:28] got nothing to do with this it's by
[1:28:31] faith are you saved or by grace or you
[1:28:33] say through faith not of yourselves it
[1:28:35] is a gift of god
[1:28:38] not of works not of the hail mary it's
[1:28:40] not how many times you attended service
[1:28:42] didn't attend service showed up for this
[1:28:44] and walked a little late across the
[1:28:45] street and packed somebody's groceries
[1:28:47] home it's not all of that it's not of
[1:28:49] works lest any man should boast about oh
[1:28:51] look what i've done for the kingdom
[1:28:53] and i'm afraid to say there's a lot of
[1:28:55] men going around bragging about what
[1:28:56] they've done for the kingdom
[1:28:58] well i did this and i did this and i did
[1:29:00] this and he's going to say depart from
[1:29:02] me i never knew you
[1:29:04] because it ain't based on what you did
[1:29:06] for the kingdom it's based on what he
[1:29:08] did for you to get you to the kingdom
[1:29:11] so it is now for we are his workmanship
[1:29:13] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:29:16] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:29:18] shall walk in them so i want to
[1:29:20] capitalize here in ephesians 2 and verse
[1:29:22] 8 for by grace are we saved and it's
[1:29:25] through faith and notice
[1:29:27] it's a gift of god
[1:29:30] you didn't have to work at it
[1:29:32] you didn't have to buy it you didn't
[1:29:34] have to purchase it it was god's love
[1:29:37] gift to you god gifted you faith
[1:29:41] to believe
[1:29:42] now notice
[1:29:45] it's what you do with that faith that's
[1:29:46] going to bring the blessing or not
[1:29:49] because you can be an atheist because
[1:29:50] he's got the same amount of faith if not
[1:29:52] more than some of us to believe in what
[1:29:54] he believes so it's based on how you
[1:29:56] direct the faith that god has given you
[1:29:59] do you believe his word do you believe
[1:30:00] his prophets do you believe the
[1:30:02] preaching do you believe the ministry do
[1:30:04] you believe what god's word says about
[1:30:06] you or are you is your belief based in
[1:30:09] what the world says
[1:30:11] and the negativity that surrounds the
[1:30:13] world and satan's on eden and now he's
[1:30:16] scripted and built up this great big
[1:30:18] thing today but we find with faith
[1:30:21] nothing shall be impossible to you
[1:30:25] with faith nothing shall be impossible
[1:30:28] to you no situation is impossible as
[1:30:30] long as you have the purchase power
[1:30:33] there's no sickness there's the loved
[1:30:34] one there's no complex that you will
[1:30:37] have that will supersede the faith and
[1:30:40] cause you not to attain the promise of
[1:30:42] god because with faith all things are
[1:30:45] possible to him that'll believe now
[1:30:48] brother braum says in at thy word lord
[1:30:50] he says now only by your confession can
[1:30:53] you be saved
[1:30:55] see that's the most powerful weapon that
[1:30:57] god put in the hand of a man is
[1:30:59] committal and a confession it'll do it
[1:31:02] every time
[1:31:04] somebody say every time
[1:31:06] so committal and confession it'll do it
[1:31:08] every time if you believe it accept it
[1:31:10] on those bases and believe it and stay
[1:31:13] with it keep confessing it when you
[1:31:15] confess he says you know a lot of people
[1:31:17] they look at the symptoms they always go
[1:31:19] around and they well i wish i could feel
[1:31:21] better and you know he goes that doesn't
[1:31:23] have one thing to do with it it's what
[1:31:25] you believe not what you feel
[1:31:28] now how many of you feel saved this
[1:31:30] morning
[1:31:32] a couple of your cherubs
[1:31:34] some of you how many you don't feel
[1:31:36] saved this morning if you ought to be
[1:31:37] more hands i woke up i didn't feel safe
[1:31:39] i went home yesterday i didn't feel safe
[1:31:41] i didn't do this and i didn't do that
[1:31:43] and a lot of times the devil just begins
[1:31:45] to to be let us be he says but it's not
[1:31:47] what you believe it's not on how you
[1:31:49] feel he says now he goes if all of you
[1:31:51] here tonight he said that that are saved
[1:31:54] and you got in your head that you're not
[1:31:56] saved and you'll go around saying well
[1:31:57] i'm not saved anymore he goes you're not
[1:32:00] saved
[1:32:01] now how simple is that
[1:32:03] you go around right now your confession
[1:32:06] is you walk out of this church bless god
[1:32:08] i can't stand brother joe's preaching
[1:32:10] i'm not saved i don't feel like i got
[1:32:12] the holy ghost he said you're not saved
[1:32:15] but if it can work that way what about
[1:32:17] the positive way
[1:32:19] what about you come out to oh bless god
[1:32:21] what a service we had i'm saved i'm
[1:32:24] filled with the holy ghost i'm healed i
[1:32:26] can believe for the promise of god ain't
[1:32:28] no devil can stand before me i know who
[1:32:30] i am and i know whose i am that's all
[1:32:33] that i care about this morning i got
[1:32:35] faith this morning i believe the words
[1:32:37] of god this morning
[1:32:41] he says there's not a christian in here
[1:32:42] no matter how
[1:32:44] solid you are in faith
[1:32:46] if right now that you something happened
[1:32:48] to get a hold of you and tell you that
[1:32:50] you're not a christian and you start out
[1:32:53] testifying well i'm not a christian no
[1:32:55] more he goes you drop right then
[1:32:58] look how immediate the effect of
[1:33:00] negativity is
[1:33:02] right then
[1:33:03] your testimony your confession drops and
[1:33:05] you're not safe he goes you're no more
[1:33:07] christian anymore
[1:33:09] as soon as you testify that you're not a
[1:33:11] christian then you drop from grace right
[1:33:14] there you're falling because why your
[1:33:16] own your own speech tells what you are
[1:33:19] your own
[1:33:20] speech tells what you are
[1:33:24] now i know there's some of us there's
[1:33:25] times we don't feel like we're saved
[1:33:27] there's times we didn't we don't feel
[1:33:28] like we're christians the devil gets in
[1:33:30] your ear and begin to whisper
[1:33:32] well you're not good enough and you did
[1:33:34] this
[1:33:35] you did that
[1:33:36] but as long as your confession is i'm
[1:33:38] saved
[1:33:39] i'm healed i'm filled with the golden
[1:33:41] holy ghost satan is defeated then satan
[1:33:44] is defeated
[1:33:45] but it's all but if you go around the
[1:33:47] comments well i'm not saying you know i
[1:33:49] tried to serve god and i went to that
[1:33:51] church and you know there's a bunch of
[1:33:52] do's and don'ts and regulations and you
[1:33:54] know they try to legislate holiness and
[1:33:56] well you know what i just it wasn't for
[1:33:58] me well it's not gonna be for you
[1:34:01] if that's your confession it's not for
[1:34:02] me well it's not for you
[1:34:04] if your confession is that you're not
[1:34:06] healed and you know i guess it ain't in
[1:34:08] god's will come on you're we're not
[1:34:10] baptist i got a great friend of mine
[1:34:12] he's a baptist pastor and he and i had a
[1:34:14] conversation about sister atlanta turkey
[1:34:15] hunting one morning about six o'clock in
[1:34:17] the morning sitting up in a little
[1:34:18] sagebrush we're sitting there talking
[1:34:20] and i was telling them about how god
[1:34:21] came down and healed sister atlanta and
[1:34:24] and delivered her cancer he goes you
[1:34:26] really believe god healed her i said
[1:34:27] absolutely god healed her
[1:34:30] he goes well how did you know i said
[1:34:32] it's in the word god's purpose and god's
[1:34:34] plan is he's the lord thy god that
[1:34:36] healeth thee it is god's will to heal
[1:34:41] well you know the baptist met the method
[1:34:44] is well if it is god's will then he will
[1:34:45] do it
[1:34:46] well you can believe that if you want to
[1:34:48] we're not baptists here this morning
[1:34:50] we're believers i'm believing for
[1:34:51] healing i'm believing for deliverance
[1:34:53] i'm believing for a rapture i'm
[1:34:54] believing for a body change i'm
[1:34:56] believing for the supernatural
[1:35:00] so if you confess this morning that the
[1:35:01] holy ghost is not for you you will never
[1:35:03] receive the holy ghost
[1:35:06] doesn't matter notice now it doesn't
[1:35:08] always have to be with your lips either
[1:35:09] it could be with your actions
[1:35:12] your actions come in
[1:35:14] with the wowzy wowzy woos
[1:35:17] head all beat down preaching's going
[1:35:19] forth you'd rather sleep than get
[1:35:21] anything from god your actions are
[1:35:23] telling you i'm not interested
[1:35:25] i'm not convinced therefore i'm not
[1:35:27] concerned you expect to get something
[1:35:28] from the service like that
[1:35:30] but if you come dragging in and you got
[1:35:32] a need and no matter what you're
[1:35:33] fighting you fight that sleepy spirit
[1:35:35] until god gets a hold of your heart
[1:35:36] because faith is resonating you want
[1:35:38] something from god you come with an
[1:35:39] expectation god will meet that
[1:35:41] expectation every time you come you beat
[1:35:44] that body into subjects and say you're
[1:35:46] gonna go to church oh boy you're gonna
[1:35:47] listen up this ain't no time to sleep
[1:35:49] all we got to do is one more hour and
[1:35:51] we'll be out of here you can make it one
[1:35:52] more hour
[1:35:56] sometimes you just got to talk dirty to
[1:35:57] yourself or mean to yourself not dirty
[1:35:59] but you got you got to be aggressive
[1:36:02] come on i know you're tired you was up
[1:36:04] to one o'clock last night and he was up
[1:36:06] again at 6 30 trying to study but i'm
[1:36:08] here

[1:36:11] what side of the fence you're on let me
[1:36:13] tell you that i may be tired this
[1:36:15] morning i may be weird this morning i
[1:36:17] may be fighting a great fight but i know
[1:36:19] i'm on the lord's side i'm here i'm
[1:36:22] giving testimony i'm letting my faith
[1:36:24] reign out i'm a son of god i'm a
[1:36:27] believer this morning and ain't no devil
[1:36:30] ain't no devil hell can't keep me from
[1:36:32] the promises
[1:36:34] glory to god this morning can't no devil
[1:36:36] keep you from the brother nothing will
[1:36:38] stand before your prayer
[1:36:42] nothing
[1:36:43] no sickness no situation no trial no
[1:36:47] devil nothing will stand before your
[1:36:49] prayer
[1:36:50] glory to god this morning
[1:36:55] oh
[1:36:56] hallelujah
[1:37:00] my brother brown says in the message
[1:37:02] except god's gift 1953.
[1:37:05] he says now
[1:37:07] healing is not something that you just
[1:37:08] say well i believe it i believe it
[1:37:12] he said no that's all right if that's
[1:37:13] the best you can do just mentally say it
[1:37:16] well i see i believe it i'll accept it
[1:37:18] he goes then if you accept and notice he
[1:37:21] says if you accept it on those bases
[1:37:24] he says say it over
[1:37:25] and over
[1:37:27] and over
[1:37:28] and over and over until you finally
[1:37:30] believe it
[1:37:33] did you hear that
[1:37:35] say it over i'm healed
[1:37:38] but you got your knees are killing you
[1:37:40] i'm healed but my leaves i'm healed by
[1:37:42] my back i'm healed say it over and over
[1:37:46] and over until you finally believe it
[1:37:49] and then when you believe it that's
[1:37:51] faith
[1:37:52] because it anchors
[1:37:53] he said don't let
[1:37:55] or don't have a negative testimony every
[1:37:57] time when you confess well i still feel
[1:38:00] bad today
[1:38:01] i guess i'll go straight back he goes
[1:38:04] you go straight back in that same rut
[1:38:05] that she was in the beginning that's not
[1:38:07] he goes there's not a man or woman in
[1:38:09] here that's been baptized with the holy
[1:38:11] ghost but you would start your
[1:38:12] confession i believe i lost the holy
[1:38:14] ghost i believe it's gone from it he
[1:38:16] goes you'll go right down you'll never
[1:38:18] he says you'll go right down right then
[1:38:22] right now that's why we got to have a
[1:38:24] positive confession
[1:38:26] you'll find people come in a prayer line
[1:38:28] or come up for prayer you hear him say i
[1:38:30] want the assurance
[1:38:32] who doesn't want the assurance
[1:38:34] but faith that he planted inside of you
[1:38:36] is what assurance
[1:38:39] that's what faith means he's given you
[1:38:41] the assurance
[1:38:43] well brother i just need the assurance
[1:38:45] well then say it over hand over hand
[1:38:47] over you want the assurance of the holy
[1:38:49] ghost the only ghost is mine the holy
[1:38:51] ghost is mine the holy ghost is mine the
[1:38:53] holy ghost is mine it's for whosoever
[1:38:55] will the holy ghost is mine it's for you
[1:38:57] for your loved ones for those as many as
[1:38:59] the lord our god shall come the holy
[1:39:01] ghost is mine you keep saying it and
[1:39:03] over and over you don't need some man to
[1:39:05] lay hands on you and tell you you got it
[1:39:07] all you got to do is believe the word
[1:39:12] it's assurance
[1:39:15] say it over and over
[1:39:17] say it over and over until you believe
[1:39:20] it
[1:39:21] until you believe it
[1:39:23] not believe that brother aaron lay it
[1:39:25] hands on you and therefore you got it
[1:39:28] you believe it
[1:39:29] it's personal to you
[1:39:31] you met god's requirements and because
[1:39:33] you met his requirements he sealed you
[1:39:36] or he's healed you or he's delivered you
[1:39:38] because you met the requirement
[1:39:41] and look wake up every day
[1:39:44] i'm healed
[1:39:46] i'm healed it may be the worst day y'all
[1:39:49] need how many of you all been watching
[1:39:50] brother ron
[1:39:51] if you hadn't you need to
[1:39:53] this man's going to the pulpit just
[1:39:55] throwing up his guts and feeling
[1:39:56] miserable sugar spiking and dropping and
[1:39:59] he's all over the place but when he
[1:40:00] stands behind that pulpit i'm going to
[1:40:02] say that's another man god using him
[1:40:04] like never before
[1:40:07] because while he ain't just confessing
[1:40:08] over and over he has been an example to
[1:40:11] multitudes out there this is how you
[1:40:13] fight the good fight of faith this is
[1:40:15] how you believe you don't believe one
[1:40:17] minute the only digress today you keep
[1:40:19] standing you keep firm on the promise of
[1:40:21] god god is my healer god is my deliverer
[1:40:24] i'm standing here as a testimony to you
[1:40:27] that god's gonna deliver god has
[1:40:29] delivered me of this cancer
[1:40:34] notice now
[1:40:37] hebrews 3 and verse 1.
[1:40:40] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[1:40:43] heavenly calling consider the apostle
[1:40:46] and high priest of our profession
[1:40:48] christ jesus that word profession means
[1:40:51] acknowledge
[1:40:52] our confession
[1:40:54] and then accept god's gift he says
[1:40:56] you'll never live above your confession
[1:41:00] some of y'all need to start confessing
[1:41:01] the right things
[1:41:04] write it on your refrigerator
[1:41:05] stick it in the mirror when you brush
[1:41:07] your teeth you got to start confessing
[1:41:09] the right things

[1:41:16] mentality
[1:41:18] your sons and daughters of god anointed
[1:41:21] elected called chosen place for this
[1:41:23] hour god didn't just give this to
[1:41:25] anybody god placed it in your hands
[1:41:28] this glorious message that we have today
[1:41:30] it's not just for anybody the probably
[1:41:32] gotta say for a special class of people
[1:41:36] look at the special class of people here
[1:41:38] this morning
[1:41:40] come on church
[1:41:41] let me tell you i didn't make you what
[1:41:43] you are brother tim didn't make you what
[1:41:45] you are brother timothy brother ron
[1:41:47] brother aaron no preacher made you what
[1:41:49] you are but god before the foundation of
[1:41:51] the world he saw fit to put your name on
[1:41:54] that special section of the book of life
[1:41:57] it's called the lamb's book of life and
[1:41:58] ain't no devil ain't no sickness ain't
[1:42:00] no torment spirit ain't no pornography
[1:42:03] take nothing a racial name off of it let
[1:42:06] me tell you can't nothing stand before
[1:42:08] the believer's prayer
[1:42:10] not cancer not sugar not disdain or that
[1:42:13] disease we're more than overcomers
[1:42:18] notice now he says you'll never
[1:42:21] live
[1:42:23] above your confession
[1:42:27] see jesus is the high priest
[1:42:30] of our confession
[1:42:32] now some of us
[1:42:34] you know it's like a tree starts growing
[1:42:36] if it ain't planted right
[1:42:38] it starts
[1:42:40] leaning now some of us we lean
[1:42:44] by genetics
[1:42:46] and i'm just preaching off the cuff we
[1:42:48] lean
[1:42:50] by family strains
[1:42:52] and we we're growing
[1:42:54] we're growing we're becoming a mature
[1:42:57] tree
[1:42:58] where we're going crooked
[1:43:00] we're leaning a little bit toward the
[1:43:01] negative side
[1:43:02] so we're facing the positive but we're
[1:43:04] leaning here
[1:43:06] just think if we could straighten
[1:43:07] ourselves up
[1:43:09] just that little bit of movement
[1:43:11] toward the promise of god
[1:43:13] that little movement to believe that no
[1:43:15] matter what you ask for you can have it
[1:43:19] so we sign he says here jesus is the
[1:43:21] high priest of our confession
[1:43:25] am i still on
[1:43:27] i didn't think i was
[1:43:29] where's the hand
[1:43:37] he says you'll never live above your
[1:43:39] confession
[1:43:40] jesus is the high priest of our
[1:43:42] confession he says now any scholar knows
[1:43:45] that the same word profession is
[1:43:47] confession
[1:43:49] see it's just translated now sitting at
[1:43:51] the right hand of the father he's there
[1:43:54] ready to make intercessions upon what
[1:43:56] upon what you confess
[1:43:58] see jesus is there at the right hand he
[1:44:01] says he can't do nothing for you until
[1:44:04] you first confess that he's done it
[1:44:09] you want something from god then let the
[1:44:11] negativity leave your vocabulary let it
[1:44:13] leave your mouth let it leave your
[1:44:14] actions let me just say i'm preaching
[1:44:16] from i'm just preaching
[1:44:18] this is real
[1:44:20] you want something from god get out of
[1:44:22] the little wowzy wowzy woods and start
[1:44:24] believing on the promise start
[1:44:25] confessing what the word says about you
[1:44:27] he says now there was a man trying to
[1:44:29] seek god every every time he say now i'm
[1:44:31] saved the devil said nope
[1:44:33] no you're not how many has ever said had

[1:45:09] what he told me that i could be and i'll
[1:45:10] believe it right now but many times then
[1:45:12] he wants to come in and sometimes he'll
[1:45:14] disguise himself as an angel of the
[1:45:16] light or he'll disguise himself as a
[1:45:18] roaring lion but you've got to stand
[1:45:20] fast on the word of god and believe what

[1:47:11] good it was a religious term we'll take
[1:47:13] it but see it's a it's a native american
[1:47:15] term when they were under attack it
[1:47:18] looked like they were going to be
[1:47:19] defeated they would drive a stake in the
[1:47:21] ground and actually tie a person by the
[1:47:23] leg to him so that they had to stay
[1:47:25] there and defend that piece of ground
[1:47:27] even if it meant death
[1:47:31] oh what we need to do today is take a
[1:47:33] stand no matter what it looks like no
[1:47:35] matter how we feel no matter what the
[1:47:36] people say no matter what we need to
[1:47:38] drive a stake in the ground this morning
[1:47:40] and say no matter what i'm going to
[1:47:41] defend this position i'm going to defend
[1:47:43] the holy ghost i'm going to defend the
[1:47:45] virtues of this man i'm going to stand
[1:47:47] here i'll tie my soul with the heaven of
[1:47:49] faith and i'm going to believe that this
[1:47:51] is my this morning i'm going to fight
[1:47:53] this devil and that devil i believe in
[1:47:55] that cancer is defeated i believe that
[1:47:57] sugar diabetes is defeated i tied myself
[1:48:00] i drove down my state i believe the word
[1:48:03] this morning
[1:48:05] oh devil you got to fight on your hands
[1:48:07] this morning because we're driving down
[1:48:08] stakes
[1:48:16] drive down that state this morning
[1:48:19] and tie your soul to it by faith
[1:48:24] oh faith
[1:48:25] it's not time to quit
[1:48:27] it's not time to give up it's not time
[1:48:29] to give in

[1:48:32] ain't time to quit drive a stake tie
[1:48:34] yourself to it draw your sword and be
[1:48:37] ready to fight
[1:48:38] even if it means death
[1:48:44] oh even
[1:48:47] so this is not
[1:48:49] whatever will be will be
[1:48:51] that's how sometimes we want to think
[1:48:53] but this is a time
[1:48:54] to drive that stake down and occupy
[1:48:57] until jesus comes
[1:48:59] see keep
[1:49:00] keep taking ground
[1:49:02] keep advancing don't back up
[1:49:05] brother made a good point so when they
[1:49:06] drove a stake down
[1:49:08] they came back if they made advancements
[1:49:10] they came back to that state they knew
[1:49:12] this is the furthest point i can't go
[1:49:13] beyond this
[1:49:15] let me tell you church you may get
[1:49:16] backed up to that state but we ain't
[1:49:18] going back behind it
[1:49:19] so whatever it is you driving down this
[1:49:21] morning you drive down with the with the
[1:49:23] mindset that i'm moving forward but if i
[1:49:25] get defeated and i get backed up i'm not
[1:49:28] going past my stake i've drove it in the
[1:49:30] ground all i can say from this time
[1:49:32] forward it's over christian soldier
[1:49:34] marching on to war i'm not backing up
[1:49:37] i'm not gonna bend i'm not gonna break
[1:49:39] i'm moving forward i'm changing the line
[1:49:41] we're advancing to the army of the
[1:49:43] living god this morning we can't be
[1:49:46] moved church oh we're held in the
[1:49:48] inexhaustible fountain of life he's
[1:49:50] holding me in his hands this morning
[1:49:52] let's press the battle like we've never
[1:49:54] pressed before
[1:49:57] drive your stake down
[1:50:00] keep confessing that you're healed
[1:50:02] keep confessing that your bride
[1:50:05] try that sake now just think for a
[1:50:06] minute
[1:50:07] how
[1:50:08] advanced would we as a bride of christ
[1:50:11] be
[1:50:13] if we gave as much attention to the
[1:50:15] promises of god as we do to the lives of
[1:50:17] the enemy
[1:50:20] where would we be
[1:50:23] if we would give much attention to the
[1:50:26] promises of god
[1:50:28] as we do to the lies
[1:50:30] as we do to how we feel
[1:50:33] i don't feel good well with this not
[1:50:37] you want something on feelings i got you
[1:50:38] a quote right here i'm glad you asked
[1:50:42] he says now you're not saved because you
[1:50:44] feel like you're saved
[1:50:46] and the house of god said amen
[1:50:49] oh i know
[1:50:50] he says i know i'm saved because i had a
[1:50:52] chill
[1:50:54] run through me and so forth he goes
[1:50:55] that's not why you're safe
[1:50:57] satan can whoop you or whip you around
[1:50:59] the stomach everywhere and he can too
[1:51:02] upon your feelings that's right but when
[1:51:04] you walk back and say thus saith the
[1:51:07] lord my faith is built on the word of
[1:51:09] god he can't whip that away
[1:51:12] notice he can whip you around the stump
[1:51:14] on your feelings he can whip you around
[1:51:16] the stump on your imaginations he can
[1:51:18] whip you around the stuff on all these
[1:51:19] ideas memory conscious affection
[1:51:22] reasoning he can whip you around and
[1:51:23] stuff on that but he can't whip you
[1:51:25] around the stuff oh thus saith the lord
[1:51:27] and i'm gonna tell you thus saith the
[1:51:29] lord this morning you are the sons and
[1:51:31] daughters of god and ain't no devil can
[1:51:33] back you from that
[1:51:36] theories may change but it doesn't
[1:51:38] change god god's the unchangeable god
[1:51:40] his word is eternally true and your
[1:51:42] faith is to rest solely on the word of
[1:51:45] god not what man says about it but what
[1:51:48] god says about it and how does god bring
[1:51:50] it to pass god brings it to pass by
[1:51:52] interpreting through manifestation
[1:51:54] that's how you know it's thus saith the
[1:51:56] lord not because i'll tell you but if
[1:51:58] the holy spirit comes behind it and
[1:52:00] amends it and bring the manifestation
[1:52:04] he says now i'm saved because the word
[1:52:06] of god tells me i'm saved satan can
[1:52:09] whoop you around anywhere on how you
[1:52:11] feel
[1:52:12] he goes but i believe it because god
[1:52:14] said so and i accept it upon the basis
[1:52:16] of his word that's how i was saved i
[1:52:19] believed it i confessed it and then it
[1:52:22] works the results
[1:52:24] i believed it
[1:52:26] then i confessed it
[1:52:28] and then it works the results are then
[1:52:30] it manifests
[1:52:32] what is being preached or what is being
[1:52:33] believed he said but the first thing i'm
[1:52:36] saying because god's word teaches that
[1:52:38] i'm saved that's how you're saved if
[1:52:40] you're saved satan can whip you on your
[1:52:42] ideas and things but he can't go around
[1:52:44] the word of god
[1:52:46] jesus said it is written and that
[1:52:48] settled it with all it is written in the
[1:52:51] scriptures
[1:52:52] some of you need to remind the devil
[1:52:53] what the word says about you
[1:52:56] he's always trying to put thoughts in
[1:52:57] your head put these lies in your head
[1:52:59] we'll spin these things in your ear
[1:53:01] you're not going to make it you're going
[1:53:02] to die you're going to die of an early
[1:53:03] age you're going to do this that and the
[1:53:04] other you know you're never going to get
[1:53:05] the holy ghost it ain't for you this
[1:53:07] message ain't for you that's all lies
[1:53:11] it's all lies
[1:53:12] see i'm not saved today because i can
[1:53:14] shout
[1:53:17] and some of you saying praise god
[1:53:20] because i don't shout
[1:53:22] if it was heading on some of you or most
[1:53:24] of all of us would be saved this morning
[1:53:28] yeah oh my is right
[1:53:31] he said when i say because we can shout
[1:53:32] i'm not saying i'm saved not because i i
[1:53:35] feel like i'm saved i'm saved because
[1:53:36] i've met god's conditions of the bible
[1:53:39] he that heareth my words and believeth
[1:53:41] or otherwise has faith on him that sent
[1:53:44] me has everlasting life and shall not
[1:53:47] come into condemnation but is passed
[1:53:49] from death unto life i believe that
[1:53:51] that's right and on them conditions i'm
[1:53:54] saved because god said so
[1:53:57] now let me just say this there's not one
[1:53:59] faith that saves you and another faith
[1:54:01] that heals you
[1:54:03] there's not one faith that heals you and
[1:54:04] another faith that delivers you there's
[1:54:06] not one faith that delivers you there is
[1:54:08] another faith for miracles
[1:54:11] there's no degrees of faith
[1:54:14] well
[1:54:16] it's all one faith
[1:54:19] one lord
[1:54:20] one baptism
[1:54:22] one
[1:54:23] your faith is anchored in the work
[1:54:27] that was done at calvary and because of
[1:54:29] that work it is finished
[1:54:31] everything you had need of in this
[1:54:33] journey is already finished
[1:54:37] now
[1:54:39] how do we apply faith brother joe as we
[1:54:42] start bringing this down to a close i
[1:54:43] didn't say i was closing
[1:54:45] i'm just kind of descending like an
[1:54:47] airplane you know you start you start
[1:54:49] slowing down
[1:54:50] we're going to slow down a minute
[1:54:54] we don't want to hit the runway at 100
[1:54:55] miles an hour
[1:54:56] don't want to crash
[1:54:58] so how do we apply faith
[1:55:01] you know in the old testament
[1:55:02] they're at the passover moses was given
[1:55:04] a commandment or given a commission or
[1:55:06] given some words and he had to tell the
[1:55:08] people i want you to go out there and
[1:55:09] get you some hyssop
[1:55:12] now hyster wants some educated flower
[1:55:15] that only the botanist know about
[1:55:17] they've done all the study and they knew
[1:55:18] every intricate detail of the hyssop no
[1:55:21] you know hyster was trampled on every
[1:55:22] day it was walked by every day you just
[1:55:24] looked up that's just histo
[1:55:26] i wish you to quit growing in my front
[1:55:28] yard i'm sick of this mess i had to mo
[1:55:30] mo mo
[1:55:31] it's kind of like bahia in louisiana
[1:55:35] but he said go get some hyssop and dip
[1:55:37] it in the blood and apply it
[1:55:40] apply it to the lentils apply to the
[1:55:41] door close
[1:55:43] and brother baby says he goes but for
[1:55:44] miracles and for healing he goes is it
[1:55:46] some different type of faith he says no
[1:55:48] it's the same faith there's only one
[1:55:50] faith in all things all things are that
[1:55:52] they're the original but how do we do it
[1:55:54] he says hyssop was always used to
[1:55:57] sprinkle the blood and faith is always
[1:55:59] used today to apply the word
[1:56:03] faith is always used to apply the word
[1:56:05] in the days of the passover moses
[1:56:07] commanded him to take up hyssop and dip
[1:56:09] it in the blood and splash it upon the
[1:56:10] doorposts and on the lentils and on the
[1:56:12] plying of the blood see his was just
[1:56:14] some common weed not that he says these
[1:56:16] great big waters of separation
[1:56:17] represents common faith the believer
[1:56:19] coming must not be some supernatural now
[1:56:21] get this this is amen for everybody not
[1:56:23] some supernatural some kind of fellow
[1:56:25] with a high education until he knows
[1:56:28] more than what webster does he doesn't
[1:56:29] have to be some great theologian he just
[1:56:31] has to use common faith
[1:56:34] hyssop
[1:56:36] pick it up anywhere
[1:56:38] i don't know why y'all should've been
[1:56:39] amen
[1:56:42] i'm not looking at a bunch of
[1:56:43] theologians out here this morning we're
[1:56:44] just common people
[1:56:46] with common faith simple oh louisiana
[1:56:49] faith to believe
[1:56:52] he says now hyssop is just a common weed
[1:56:55] i never want to be more common than i am
[1:56:57] today
[1:56:59] because god is using the common things
[1:57:00] of this world
[1:57:02] to do the supernatural with
[1:57:04] he took a common weed and he did a
[1:57:07] supernatural display
[1:57:09] when that death angel came over
[1:57:13] and he swept down and you heard the
[1:57:14] screams going up and this going up and
[1:57:16] this one down and that one down is
[1:57:18] because somebody had enough faith in
[1:57:20] something that was so common
[1:57:22] and took god at his word and applied it
[1:57:25] to their life i'm telling you god is
[1:57:26] looking for some man and woman today
[1:57:28] that would take that common old faith
[1:57:30] how'd you get here this morning nobody
[1:57:32] rode a horse
[1:57:34] no you got in the car this morning
[1:57:36] didn't you some of you got in the car
[1:57:37] and you turned the key on you didn't
[1:57:39] think about it it was just common this
[1:57:41] is just what we do
[1:57:43] and brother bob said it's that same
[1:57:45] faith that you apply to the word of god
[1:57:47] for your circumstance for your situation
[1:57:50] you don't think about it it's just
[1:57:51] common everyday faith you don't have to
[1:57:54] have some super duper faith to believe
[1:57:57] the word to get the word to work on your
[1:57:58] behalf you just got to believe just like
[1:58:00] you did this morning when you get out
[1:58:02] there and you put the key in the
[1:58:04] commission or the ignition or you just
[1:58:05] push the little button and the thing
[1:58:07] fired up and you stuck it in reverse and
[1:58:09] you backed out and you're sitting here

[1:58:13] to move god to your situation you just
[1:58:15] got to believe lord i know when i walk

[1:58:40] expectation and be prepared to watch god

[1:58:45] prepared to see god back off of his word
[1:58:47] be prepared this morning you want to see
[1:58:49] god god is here god is moving god is
[1:58:52] witnessing god has testified that he is
[1:58:54] a living god
[1:58:58] he says you don't have to have some
[1:59:00] super-duper faith
[1:59:01] some super duper something it just takes
[1:59:04] common faith in god just believe it like
[1:59:06] you would if your mother would would
[1:59:08] have said just get something for you
[1:59:10] your mother said she was going to get
[1:59:11] something for you
[1:59:13] you know how it is a little kid
[1:59:15] tell you going to disney world
[1:59:17] man
[1:59:18] you're going to hold on to disney world
[1:59:20] till you're 30 years old
[1:59:21] mama's taking me
[1:59:23] we going to disney world
[1:59:27] man 30 years old it's about time to give
[1:59:29] up
[1:59:30] no
[1:59:31] mama said it
[1:59:34] he said that's the kind of faith you've
[1:59:35] got to have toward god
[1:59:36] mama said it
[1:59:38] probably said may every sick person in
[1:59:39] divine presence this morning may you
[1:59:41] reach over just now and jerk a handful
[1:59:44] jerk you a handful of hyssop out of
[1:59:46] their own life and apply it to your life
[1:59:48] that's what you need to do
[1:59:51] you've been jerking on doubts you've
[1:59:53] been jerking on unbelief so long you
[1:59:54] don't know how to apply i'm here to tell
[1:59:56] you grab a handful of that common faith
[1:59:58] this morning allow the word of god to
[1:59:59] elevate your faith reach over and just
[2:00:01] grab it i'm applying this to my family
[2:00:03] i'm applying this to my marriage i'm
[2:00:05] applying this to my home i'm applying
[2:00:07] this to my children i'm applying it to
[2:00:08] my body i'm applying it to my job i'm
[2:00:10] applying it to my church oh bless god
[2:00:12] i'm gonna apply to this one i'm jerking
[2:00:14] a handful this morning it may be
[2:00:16] mother's day but what greater day than
[2:00:18] to grab a handful of faith and say yes
[2:00:20] we're gonna have godly minds because why
[2:00:21] this message produces godly women and
[2:00:24] godly men those that are believed us
[2:00:26] saith the lord
[2:00:30] now god will heal you
[2:00:31] on the merits of your faith
[2:00:34] and that alone
[2:00:35] that's how he heals he says don't forget
[2:00:37] this now faith is designed to see what
[2:00:39] god's will and wants there is no
[2:00:41] knowledge that can do that faith alone
[2:00:43] is designed to give the human race to
[2:00:46] find out what god's will is
[2:00:49] now he said this is where many people
[2:00:51] fail to get their healing
[2:00:52] what they're asking for because they
[2:00:54] take faith as something that it's not
[2:00:58] he says now
[2:01:00] see it's just as real as your sense of
[2:01:02] your body will declare anything it's
[2:01:04] just as real
[2:01:06] as my eye says that this is a piece of
[2:01:08] paper right here it's just as real it's
[2:01:11] just as real as you say that that is a
[2:01:13] lie it's just as real as you say i feel
[2:01:14] my coat it's just as real as you hear a
[2:01:16] baby talking in the back making noise
[2:01:19] see it's just as real as i taste
[2:01:21] something in my mouth
[2:01:22] it's that real only you can't show it to
[2:01:25] anybody
[2:01:28] you have it alone
[2:01:29] it's yours
[2:01:31] faith is the substance of things hoped
[2:01:33] for
[2:01:34] see it's not a myth it's something that
[2:01:35] you
[2:01:36] possess
[2:01:37] not an imagination it's a substance not
[2:01:40] an imagination not an emotion but
[2:01:42] something that you have it comes to you
[2:01:44] by hearing the word of god faith cometh
[2:01:46] by hearing hearing of the word and that
[2:01:48] puts it back to where your faith in is
[2:01:50] not in some individual
[2:01:53] it's not in a man it's not in an
[2:01:55] organization it's not in the group of
[2:01:57] people it's in god
[2:02:00] because god is the word and your faith
[2:02:03] is in god
[2:02:05] he says no you find people they do
[2:02:06] something and you say well i can do that
[2:02:08] too
[2:02:08] he said you find out they get wrecked up
[2:02:10] because they do it based on imagination
[2:02:12] well if god did that film got to do that
[2:02:13] for me no it's got to be a revelation
[2:02:15] it's got to be faith
[2:02:17] and we find the bible would tell us that
[2:02:19] jesus when he was here he had perfect
[2:02:21] faith
[2:02:22] perfect faith in what the word declared
[2:02:23] about him
[2:02:25] and what he was in the groom we are in
[2:02:26] the bright form so shouldn't we also
[2:02:29] exemplify perfect faith
[2:02:31] in what he had made us what his word has
[2:02:34] made us i didn't make you you didn't
[2:02:37] make you you didn't make me what we are
[2:02:38] today he made us what we are he says by
[2:02:41] his faith in his word
[2:02:44] he conquers he conquers anything both
[2:02:46] death hell the grave we know that god is
[2:02:48] god that perfect faith is god's perfect
[2:02:50] word he conquered everything that he
[2:02:52] come in contact with death could not
[2:02:54] even stand in his presence sickness
[2:02:56] could not stand in his presence flowing
[2:02:58] from him was like rivers of virtue going
[2:03:00] out constantly virtue going forth in his
[2:03:03] from his garment he said this he goes
[2:03:05] there he was walking walking in a world
[2:03:08] with perfect faith because he was the
[2:03:10] word and he says now if you abide in me
[2:03:12] through him he brought the word to you
[2:03:15] and my word abide in you then walk in
[2:03:17] the same kind of way virtues flowing
[2:03:20] from you the rivers of god the fountains
[2:03:22] blessings just flowing out of the people
[2:03:24] see what i mean and you're not bluffing
[2:03:26] it you're not imagining it you actually
[2:03:28] are taking place and you see it if
[2:03:30] you're just to imagine he says don't do
[2:03:32] any good but if it's really there it's
[2:03:34] really happened so we realize that
[2:03:36] perfect faith masters all circumstances
[2:03:41] and perfect faith in a perfect word and
[2:03:43] a perfect god there ain't a devil can
[2:03:45] stand before his people
[2:03:48] now the bible tells us we start
[2:03:50] start our descend
[2:03:52] hebrews 11 6
[2:03:55] but without faith it is impossible to
[2:03:57] please him for he that cometh to god
[2:04:00] must believe that he is and that he is a
[2:04:02] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[2:04:05] him he that cometh he that worships god
[2:04:08] must believe in an infinite eternal
[2:04:11] unoriginated a self-existent the cause
[2:04:13] of all things of whom everything depends
[2:04:16] and who by whose energy and bounty and
[2:04:18] providence all other things exist live
[2:04:20] and are supplied with the means
[2:04:22] he needs the continuous of in the
[2:04:24] existence of life we must believe that
[2:04:26] he is the all and all we can't
[2:04:28] substitute him for man we can't
[2:04:30] substitute him for our favorite preacher
[2:04:31] we can't shut this to him for our
[2:04:33] favorite doctrine we got to believe that
[2:04:35] god is and that god is a rewarder of
[2:04:38] those that diligently seek god and
[2:04:40] that's why we're here this morning and
[2:04:41] he would also tell us in the bible he
[2:04:43] says now the prayer of faith shall save
[2:04:46] the sick
[2:04:49] the prayer of faith this is in james 5
[2:04:51] and verse 15 and the prayer of faith
[2:04:53] shall save the sick and the lord shall
[2:04:56] raise him up and if he have committed
[2:04:57] sins they shall be forgiven him
[2:05:01] confess your faults one to another pray
[2:05:03] for one another that ye may be healed
[2:05:05] for the effectual fervent prayer of a
[2:05:08] righteous man availeth much
[2:05:11] that word effectual there means put into
[2:05:14] operation
[2:05:16] it means active it means mighty
[2:05:19] otherwise we can say it like this this
[2:05:21] is not some dead prayer
[2:05:23] this is not somebody just going through
[2:05:25] the motions this is a man or a woman who
[2:05:27] really believes and there put their
[2:05:29] prayer in operation and it's active and
[2:05:32] it's mighty and they're expecting to see
[2:05:34] supernatural results
[2:05:37] so that word available there means to
[2:05:40] power as shown by extraordinary deeds to
[2:05:43] have strength to overcome so the
[2:05:45] effectual fervent prayer
[2:05:48] of a righteous man avails much it means
[2:05:51] it does extraordinary deeds
[2:05:55] prayer
[2:05:56] by faith
[2:05:57] does extraordinary deeds
[2:06:00] prayer of a little sister
[2:06:02] 15 minutes later saw her prayer manifest
[2:06:05] when her brother comes staggering in on
[2:06:07] a wednesday night
[2:06:09] and he hasn't been the same since
[2:06:11] prayer
[2:06:12] an effectual
[2:06:13] fervent prayer i want my brother saved
[2:06:17] availed
[2:06:18] much
[2:06:20] and that word means to prevail in power
[2:06:23] to do extraordinary deeds power to see
[2:06:25] miracles power to see supernatural
[2:06:27] healing power to believe for lost levels
[2:06:29] power to overcome and not be overcome
[2:06:34] daniel 11 verse daniel 11 yes verse 32
[2:06:39] and such as do
[2:06:41] wickedly against the covenant shall he
[2:06:43] corrupt with flatteries
[2:06:45] but the people that know their god shall
[2:06:48] be strong
[2:06:51] and do
[2:06:53] exploits
[2:06:54] the people that know their god now this
[2:06:56] word know here as i looked this up how
[2:06:58] about how to run away
[2:07:00] i know you think well my goodness
[2:07:01] brother joe it's only four letters and
[2:07:03] it's real simple i mean no we know what
[2:07:04] no means right
[2:07:06] but the word no here means to have
[2:07:08] knowledge
[2:07:09] it's to know
[2:07:11] is to be acquainted with and it also
[2:07:13] means to be made known
[2:07:17] so the people that know their god
[2:07:20] the people that acknowledge and are
[2:07:22] acquainted with their god but not only
[2:07:24] that the people that are known by their
[2:07:27] god
[2:07:28] those people those kind of people those
[2:07:31] are the ones that's going to do exploits
[2:07:33] those that know their god so it's one
[2:07:35] thing to know god it's another thing to
[2:07:37] be known of god because when you know
[2:07:39] who you are and you know who you are you
[2:07:42] know where you're standing then you know
[2:07:43] no matter what prayer you pray ain't a
[2:07:45] devil in hell can back you up because
[2:07:47] why you know your god and not only that
[2:07:50] god knows you and god hears you and god
[2:07:53] is ready to move on your behalf i say
[2:07:56] satan you better back up old boy cause
