[33:12] amen
[33:13] amen has turned to Hebrews chapter 12.
[33:17] and verse 1.
[33:19] Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1.
[33:22] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[33:25] amen just want to remind you of the New
[33:27] Year's meetings that are coming up
[33:29] um be Friday and Saturday and Sunday
[33:31] times and things will be posted and so
[33:35] we're looking forward to that also the
[33:37] Wednesday prior to that the Wednesday
[33:39] right between Christmas and New Year's
[33:41] we will not be having that service but
[33:43] it will be moved to the Friday night so
[33:45] if you can remember that that would be
[33:48] helpful for you
[33:49] amen Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1
[33:52] we'll definitely be making more
[33:54] announcements in the coming near future
[33:57] we're foreseeing we also are compassed
[34:01] about what's so great a cloud of
[34:03] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[34:06] and the sin which does so easily beset
[34:09] us and let us run with patience the race
[34:13] that is set before us
[34:15] looking unto Jesus the author and
[34:18] finisher of our faith
[34:19] who for the joy that was set before him
[34:22] endured the cross despising the shame
[34:25] and is set down at the right hand of the
[34:29] Throne of God Amen we'll let you be
[34:31] seated
[34:33] we spoke last Wednesday on the author
[34:36] like to look tonight at the light the
[34:38] finisher because he's not just the
[34:41] starter or the beginner of us of our
[34:43] story or the beginning of our story he's
[34:46] also the end of our story and uh he's
[34:49] he's quite the finisher he knows how to
[34:52] write a good ending and I'm thankful for
[34:55] that amen the devil may have planned an
[34:57] ending for you but his doesn't matter
[34:59] what matters is what God has planned for
[35:01] you amen you know we can look at him at
[35:04] this finisher and we can see him and
[35:07] even in the beginning of time we can
[35:09] read it in the Book of Genesis of how he
[35:11] created all the different things by the
[35:13] each day day one day two but there's
[35:16] something that he he would uh chapter 2
[35:19] and verse 1 it says the heavens and the
[35:21] Earth were finished and all the hosts of
[35:24] them and then he would rest from his
[35:27] work and so God is very uh in tune with
[35:31] he's very concerned or he's very his
[35:34] mind is on the finish of things he
[35:37] doesn't leave anything halfway done you
[35:39] know we may do that as human beings a
[35:42] lot of us are real good at beginning
[35:43] things but maybe not too good at ending
[35:45] things or finishing things and and my
[35:48] you know I myself we can be guilty of
[35:50] that you get all enthused and all into
[35:52] something and and that carries you so
[35:55] far and then a lot of times you end up
[35:57] with a lot of uh unended uh or
[36:00] unfinished projects and but God is not
[36:02] that kind of person if he starts
[36:05] something he's going to finish it amen
[36:07] he's going to make sure that it comes to
[36:09] an end a man and and I like how he talks
[36:12] about us in Jeremiah 29 and verse 11. he
[36:16] said for I know the thoughts that I
[36:17] think towards you saith the Lord
[36:19] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[36:22] give you an expected in so it's not an
[36:25] end that's going to be uh catching him
[36:27] unawares or not an end that's going to
[36:30] surprise him but it's an expected in or
[36:32] a desire to end that God has determined
[36:35] for you in your life now you know we
[36:38] know as we're in this time of life that
[36:40] we are at the end we are at the B not at
[36:42] the beginning of the even at the
[36:44] beginning of the world no doubt but not
[36:46] even at the beginning of the church ages
[36:48] We Know by the prophet of the hour that
[36:51] and the Revelation that's coming this
[36:53] day that we are at the end we're at the
[36:55] closing of time and and you know uh God
[36:59] would plant a church and we know how he
[37:01] planted a seed as a man would plant a
[37:03] garden he plants a seed amen expecting
[37:06] the end to be in Harvest none of us goes
[37:09] out and exp and plants a seed expecting
[37:11] you know not to get anything out of it
[37:13] no we would plant it expecting to get in
[37:16] Harvest or to expect to get a flower or
[37:19] whatever it is that you plant amen you
[37:21] have an expectation that that's what
[37:23] it's going to come and now now only does
[37:25] God have an expectation of it he also
[37:28] knows that his word will not fail and so
[37:31] his amen if he places that word seed of
[37:34] God down there in that ground as he did
[37:36] in the first stage and it come up
[37:38] through the tassels and or or through
[37:40] the stalks under the tassels and and
[37:42] Luther and Wesley and all of that you
[37:44] know one thing about God he does not
[37:46] leave Amen in the middle of his work he
[37:49] doesn't get tired of it as I said he
[37:51] doesn't get uh uh you know worried about
[37:53] it not coming and just give up on it I
[37:56] I'm thankful he don't give up on his
[37:58] work but he's going to fulfill it he's
[38:00] going to finish it amen he's going to be
[38:03] there when the Harvest takes place and
[38:06] you know brother Madam talks about the
[38:07] age that each one lived in well you know
[38:09] he talks about Luther and Wesley said
[38:11] they were the age of reformation not the
[38:14] age of restoration amen he said neither
[38:17] was any age but this last age is the age
[38:20] of restoration it's also the age of
[38:23] complete blackout in apostasy but in
[38:26] this age of apostasy apostasy this is
[38:29] also the age of restoration it is the
[38:33] age of the finished cycle
[38:36] amen the Finish cycle when when this is
[38:39] over it is all over amen we're right at
[38:43] the end if you want to look at it as a
[38:44] race you know we are the last Runners
[38:46] amen you know you put your best at the
[38:49] last amen you put your closure at the
[38:51] last you put your finisher at the last
[38:53] you put the one to run the last as the
[38:56] batons would be passed you would put the
[38:59] one that could run and would have the
[39:00] determination that at the end when the
[39:02] horn sounds I'm going to cross that
[39:05] finish line now it's not so much
[39:07] important in this race that you cross
[39:09] first but it's important that you cross
[39:11] the finish line that's what's important
[39:13] in this race of life you know many have
[39:15] gone on before us many in the last few
[39:18] years have already crossed over and
[39:20] crossed that line but amen it's
[39:22] important that if you're going to win
[39:23] this race is to finish this race you
[39:26] know I got to looking at different races
[39:28] throughout the throughout time and many
[39:30] of them are brought up for the Olympics
[39:32] and and a lot of them are talks about
[39:34] the best last place finishes and and it
[39:38] was very interesting that that in these
[39:40] races that these men would train and
[39:42] they would beat their bodies and they
[39:44] would beat them into subjection and they
[39:46] would eat a certainly diet and they
[39:48] would do a certain way because they were
[39:49] training for a race and this race that
[39:52] they was going to win was not something
[39:53] of a great value that they was going to
[39:55] win it was going to be just a little
[39:56] metal to go around their neck but there
[39:58] was such passion in them to be able to
[40:01] get this so they would do that but in
[40:03] this race many of them would fall down
[40:04] or many of them would have issues and it
[40:06] was different races that one one lady
[40:08] who had run and she had failed and
[40:10] another one had tangled up with her and
[40:12] this one had jumped right up and could
[40:14] could have continued and maybe caught
[40:16] back up with the pack but she decided
[40:18] that it was important for this person
[40:20] that had failed amen that she would
[40:22] encourage her to get up and finish the
[40:25] race and I thought that was really good
[40:27] amen and we're in this race of life and
[40:29] it ain't so much who crosses the Finish
[40:31] Line the first in this race but it's
[40:33] important that the ones that are called
[40:35] to finish finish this race therefore if
[40:38] we see somebody that has fallen that has
[40:40] went down we all ought to encourage them
[40:42] get back up get continue on we're going
[40:45] to finish amen we're going to go to the
[40:47] end of this thing it was another one
[40:49] that is a man that was running a race
[40:51] and then he had a devastating energy
[40:53] injury of his hamstring that had snapped
[40:55] him and he but he was determined you
[40:58] know I didn't realize this until I was
[40:59] reading it but if a medical team comes
[41:01] out and begins to assess you then you're
[41:03] you're automatically disqualified so he
[41:06] pushed him away and he said no I'm going
[41:09] to finish this race and he's limping
[41:11] along and out of the stands comes his
[41:13] father and he comes down he puts his arm
[41:15] around his son and they walk across the
[41:18] Finish Line one of the most famous
[41:19] photos that there is as is of the father
[41:22] and the son and I thought about that as
[41:24] many times as we have fallen in this in
[41:26] the in life and we got damaged and we
[41:29] got hurt amen the father was interested
[41:31] in us finishing the race and he would
[41:34] come down and he would ride himself in
[41:36] our story and he would reach down and
[41:38] pick us up and we would think how did I
[41:40] make it across there how did I make it
[41:42] through there and we would look back and
[41:44] we'd see one set of footprints where the
[41:47] father wrote himself in our story and he
[41:49] picked us up and he carried us through
[41:51] and I'm so thankful to know a father
[41:53] like that amen you know there was
[41:55] another man who would he was running a
[41:57] marathon and he got way back and he got
[42:00] injured of some sort and he was
[42:01] determined and it was some hours since
[42:04] the last Runner had crossed and many I
[42:06] think it was only a few uh just about 14
[42:09] of the 40 something had quit actually
[42:11] and walked away and he was in with
[42:13] injuries and hurts but he was determined
[42:15] I'm going to cross that finish line I'm
[42:19] going to get to that finish line and it
[42:21] was hours after the last Runner it went
[42:23] and there was just a few people that was
[42:25] in that grandstand and they were
[42:26] watching and and they were cheering as
[42:28] he would come around the corner and he's
[42:30] dragging a leg or whatever he had going
[42:32] on with him but he finished the race and
[42:35] they had the reporters run down to him
[42:37] people were screaming and hollering and
[42:38] making a lot of noise at the last place
[42:41] finisher amen why because he had enough
[42:44] guts in him amen not to just start a
[42:46] race but to finish the race and they
[42:49] asked him said why why did you finish he
[42:51] said my country did not send me 5 000
[42:54] miles to just start a race they sent me
[42:57] to finish a race
[42:59] Hallelujah I like that there's something
[43:01] about a person that has that in them
[43:03] that that you know God put us in this
[43:06] age not to start the race but to finish
[43:08] the race and we are going to finish this
[43:11] we heard brother Ron preach on that they
[43:13] saw the day in our meetings let's finish
[43:15] this we are going to finish this we're
[43:18] going to finish and bring forth amen out
[43:21] of this finish will bring forth the body
[43:23] change will bring forth the dead in
[43:25] Christ and in this finish it'll also
[43:28] finish every sin it'll finish every
[43:30] sickness it'll finish every trouble ever
[43:33] trial ever heartache amen it'll finish
[43:36] all parting and crying and and all the
[43:38] things that goes on in this life that we
[43:40] deal with we are to finish this race so
[43:43] this is not the age of Beginnings this
[43:46] is the age or the finished cycle that
[43:48] we're in now when God has spoken
[43:51] anything he will perform it he will
[43:53] bring it to pass when he said I'm going
[43:55] to have a bride I don't know how he's
[43:57] going to do it how it's going to be at
[43:59] the end without spot without wrinkle but
[44:02] I can tell you it's going to be somebody
[44:05] and he's going to finish it he's going
[44:08] to finish that line that is wrote there
[44:09] in that Bible and there is going to be a
[44:12] church without spot without wrinkle
[44:14] that'll be here in this last day where
[44:16] they're going to come from how's it
[44:17] going to be I don't know how it's all
[44:19] going to take place but I know it's
[44:21] going to happen because God is
[44:23] interested in finishing every promise
[44:26] every word every line every dot every
[44:29] Tittle and none of it will go
[44:31] unfulfilled because he is a finisher you
[44:34] know the angel of God will perform his
[44:36] word you know I think that's something
[44:38] how how he came and he and he brought
[44:41] down the children of Israel and he heard
[44:42] their cries and all of that but he came
[44:44] down and he wrote himself in their story
[44:47] and he came down on a burning bush and
[44:49] he got a hold of a prophet's attention
[44:51] and it begins to speak to him and it
[44:53] begins to talk to him says go to tell
[44:55] Pharaoh let my people go now it was
[44:58] going to be a big thing it wasn't going
[44:59] to happen overnight it was going to take
[45:01] a time and the Pharaoh is going to
[45:03] harden his heart and maybe Moses didn't
[45:05] have all that figured out but God knew
[45:07] exactly what was going to take place and
[45:10] I was reading today and I thought it was
[45:12] very interesting in the middle of all
[45:13] that's going on he tells Moses he said
[45:16] now you go back in there and you tell
[45:18] Pharaoh let my people go and in the
[45:20] middle of it he starts going down
[45:22] through the genealogy and he starts
[45:24] saying the sons about Moses and they
[45:26] have Aaron and a Simeon and of Judah and
[45:29] he names them all by names I thought
[45:30] well it ain't that interesting that in
[45:32] the middle of all of this he brings out
[45:34] the genealogy what was God doing I'm
[45:37] going to finish this I've started
[45:39] something that I'm going to finish it
[45:40] and I want to let the devil know this
[45:43] one's mine this one's mine this one's
[45:45] mine this was mine this one you go tell
[45:48] Pharaoh this one's mine that one's mine
[45:50] and you're not going to have one of them
[45:52] but I'm going to take them every one of
[45:55] them out of here foreign
[45:57] ain't that amazing that in this age he
[46:00] can look at the devil and he can say
[46:02] that one's mine that was mine that was
[46:05] mine that was mine that was mine and
[46:08] there ain't nothing you can do about it
[46:10] let them go and he's going to finish it
[46:13] he's going to fulfill every promise amen
[46:17] it might be the Bride of one for one
[46:19] part of the bride's still in the bar
[46:21] room what part of the bride's still over
[46:22] here but when God speaks their name they
[46:26] are going to come forth
[46:30] Hallelujah he's going to perform the
[46:32] things that he had said amen when the
[46:35] season comes the Harvesters will be
[46:37] there to take the right fruit
[46:40] amen Isaiah 46 and verse 9 says remember
[46:43] the former things of old for I am God
[46:47] and there is none else I am God and
[46:51] there is none like me
[46:53] declaring the end from the beginning
[46:57] amen declaring the end from the
[47:00] beginning or the beginning from the end
[47:01] or the but the end from the beginning
[47:03] from the anxious times of things that
[47:06] are not yet done saying my cancels my
[47:09] counsel shall stand and I will do all my
[47:13] pleasure
[47:15] Hallelujah declaring from the ancient
[47:18] times the things that are not yet done
[47:21] but saying my counsel shall or my word
[47:25] shall stand and I will do all
[47:29] can you say all tonight I will do
[47:32] pleasure
[47:34] Hallelujah I want you to understand
[47:36] there's not one of his seeds that are
[47:38] German or to be germinated to life uh
[47:41] that was supposed to come to life amen
[47:45] that will not come to life but they will
[47:47] ever one come to life
[47:50] every one of them it doesn't matter what
[47:52] the devil tries to do and he tries to
[47:54] cover him up and he tries to keep him
[47:56] down he tries to push him down if God
[47:58] has a seed that's been predetermined
[48:01] before the foundation of the world to
[48:03] come to life to be a part of this bride
[48:06] she or he will be there
[48:10] the angel will watch over it to perform
[48:12] what he said he would do
[48:14] yes amen amen Isaiah 43 13 says from
[48:18] even from eternity I am he and there is
[48:22] none who can deliver out of my hand I
[48:26] act and who can reverse it
[48:29] hmm who can reverse it
[48:33] Jeremiah 32 and verse 27 behold I am the
[48:37] Lord the God of All Flesh is anything
[48:40] too difficult for me
[48:44] you know I was reading just a little
[48:45] thought somebody wrote down about Rachel
[48:48] in the Bible today and how Rachel had
[48:51] longed for a child and longed for a
[48:53] child and she was buried and she was
[48:55] bearing and she said it said the wrote
[48:57] there said she tried to rejoice when
[48:59] Leah would have a child and I'm trying
[49:00] to rejoice and sooner or later begin to
[49:02] come to where she said well maybe I'm
[49:04] just going to be this way maybe I'm just
[49:06] going to be this way and maybe I'll
[49:08] never have a child and maybe it'll never
[49:09] be this way amen but the scripture says
[49:12] God remembered Rachel
[49:16] wasn't Rachel remembered God God
[49:18] remembered Rachel and he remembered the
[49:21] promise that he had gave her and God was
[49:24] more than able to bring it to pass so
[49:26] therefore it doesn't matter how long the
[49:28] promises have lingered and how how long
[49:31] it seems like it's never going to come
[49:33] if God said it was going to come it'll
[49:36] be there
[49:37] there's nothing too hard for him he's
[49:40] the God who formed the foundation of the
[49:42] world and the word with the words of his
[49:45] mouth from the breath of his nostrils
[49:47] were the Stars cast forth and they hung
[49:49] in their place this God moves an angel
[49:52] stands to attention when he speaks
[49:55] creation Springs forth he is awesome he
[49:58] is powerful he is unparalleled he's
[50:01] unprecedented he has no rival he has I'm
[50:04] talking about your God tonight he has is
[50:07] not challenged he is all-powerful he is
[50:10] all-knowing therefore omnipotence and
[50:13] omniscience equals the perfect finisher
[50:18] Hallelujah so if he knows all about your
[50:21] story he knows how to get you to the end
[50:23] the expected ear he knows how to bring
[50:26] you where he wants you to be
[50:34] amen he's a finisher
[50:37] therefore he's going to finish
[50:41] he didn't come down to 2022 leaping over
[50:44] just about to break over into 23.
[50:47] and say you know what I just give up on
[50:49] this
[50:50] walk away
[50:52] he didn't leave his bride in the darkest
[50:54] time there's ever been walking alone
[50:58] but he has rode himself in her story
[51:01] and he's walking hand in hand with his
[51:03] bride he's leading her he's guiding her
[51:06] he's moving he's making a way where
[51:08] there seems to be no way he got an
[51:10] expected in for her
[51:14] amen if you're part of that bride I've
[51:16] kind of rejoiced a little bit right
[51:17] there because God knows exactly where
[51:21] the period goes in your life
[51:27] John chapter 4 and verse 34. let's let's
[51:31] just look at it Jesus saith unto them my
[51:34] meat is to do the will of him that sent
[51:37] me and to what finish his work
[51:42] so he's a finisher to finish his work
[51:45] he's do everything he took to whatever
[51:48] he had to do to finish his work
[51:51] amen it led the Finish would lead to his
[51:54] death but he would do everything it took
[51:56] to finish his work
[51:59] amen there were scriptures that had to
[52:01] be fulfilled of him laying in a tomb
[52:04] somewhere so he would do everything he
[52:06] had to do to finish the work
[52:10] Philippians 1 6 says being confident of
[52:13] this very thing that he that which has
[52:15] begun a good work in you will perform it
[52:18] or we'll finish it
[52:21] we'll bring it to pass until the day of
[52:24] Jesus Christ
[52:26] matter of fact he would ride himself in
[52:28] our story Amen in Revelation 3 and verse
[52:31] 14 these things saith thee amen
[52:35] all right
[52:38] do you know what an Eggman is
[52:40] it's the Finish
[52:43] he wrote himself in your story as the
[52:47] finisher
[52:49] Hallelujah and not just the finisher but
[52:52] a faithful finisher and not just a
[52:55] faithful finisher but a true witness at
[52:57] the beginning of the creation of God so
[53:00] he's saying look I've been here since
[53:01] the beginning and I'll be here till the
[53:04] end
[53:05] I'm not going to leave you alone I'm not
[53:08] going to leave you out there by yourself
[53:09] and you're wondering how this is all
[53:11] going to take place don't worry I got
[53:13] the pen and I got the power and I'm
[53:16] going to bring my word to pass
[53:20] he's a finisher
[53:22] Brandon will talk about he said that's a
[53:24] wonderful description of the attributes
[53:27] of our Lord Jesus our savior Lord and
[53:30] Savior Jesus Christ these words alone
[53:32] makes me want to shout
[53:35] because they bring such a spirit of
[53:37] reality in my heart just reading them
[53:40] without even waiting for a thorough
[53:41] revelation of the spirit upon me Thrills
[53:44] me Jesus has given us a description of
[53:48] himself in relation to this last age so
[53:51] if it's going to be the cycle of the
[53:53] Finish he's going to write himself not
[53:55] as the beginner
[53:57] not even as the one in the middle but
[53:59] the finisher the amen amen he has looked
[54:03] from the first century right down to the
[54:04] 20th and told us all things concerning
[54:07] these ages before he reveals the
[54:09] characteristics of the last days to us
[54:11] he gives us one final look at his own
[54:14] gracious and supreme deity that's the
[54:17] cat this is the Capstone revelation of
[54:20] himself this is the summit
[54:23] this is the F and the Apex this is the
[54:26] top
[54:27] and here it is thus saith the amen
[54:31] Jesus is the a man of God he is the so
[54:35] let it be of God Amen stands for
[54:38] finality
[54:40] oh Hallelujah so I want you to
[54:43] understand he would say you are my son
[54:45] amen
[54:48] you are my daughter amen
[54:51] amen you are an overcomer amen
[54:55] amen yeah that's that hell never was for
[54:58] you amen
[55:01] are there any finishers in here this
[55:03] morning this evening is there any amens
[55:05] here today amen hell wasn't for me amen
[55:09] it ain't just you saying amen but Jesus
[55:12] Christ is also said amen it's not your
[55:16] home
[55:17] amen but I have a home for you I have a
[55:21] prepared place for an expected end amen
[55:24] and you're going to go to a place that
[55:27] knows no more doubt knows no more
[55:29] Darkness knows no more sin there's no
[55:31] more sickness there's no more devil
[55:34] there's no more torment amen amen amen
[55:41] Hallelujah it is the song Let It Be of
[55:45] God
[55:49] it stands for approval
[55:51] it stands for prevailing promise it
[55:54] stands for unchanging promise it stands
[55:58] for the Seal of God
[56:02] hello
[56:04] the Seal of God
[56:06] we would get excited if we had the Seal
[56:10] of the queen of or I guess it's now the
[56:12] king of England
[56:13] I got a letter
[56:16] look at here look what I got
[56:19] conceal do you know you got something
[56:22] with the King seal on it tonight
[56:24] hitting a worthless piece of paper
[56:28] Amen to say Amen
[56:31] it's the finisher
[56:32] hey man he he's not going to just finish
[56:35] it by his own power and His Own Strength
[56:39] In A Man Called Jesus but he's going to
[56:42] take the finisher and put it in you
[56:45] so there'll be something in you that
[56:47] when you the race gets tough I'm going

[1:01:32] [Applause]
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:46] Hallelujah
[1:01:49] yes let's read about the finish line
[1:01:52] Isaiah 65 says verse 16 says he that
[1:01:56] blessed me blesseth himself in the Earth
[1:01:58] shall bless himself in the god of Truth
[1:02:00] and he that has the god of the amen
[1:02:04] brother will bring that out he said he
[1:02:06] that sweareth and the Earth shall swear
[1:02:08] by the god of the amen the god of truth
[1:02:10] because the former troubles are
[1:02:13] forgotten
[1:02:17] oh my God
[1:02:19] what a day that's going to be
[1:02:23] yeah I probably shouldn't ask for hands
[1:02:25] but I wonder how many woke up this
[1:02:27] morning and the first thing you thought
[1:02:28] of was your troubles
[1:02:31] that's going to be the be a day that the
[1:02:34] troubles are no longer remembered
[1:02:37] they are forgotten because they're hid
[1:02:40] from my eyes behold I create a new
[1:02:42] heavens and a new Earth and the former
[1:02:44] shall not be remembered nor come into
[1:02:46] mind but be a glider Rejoice forever in
[1:02:49] that which I created from behold I
[1:02:52] create Jerusalem I rejoice
[1:02:55] and her people a joy and I will rejoice
[1:02:59] in Jerusalem enjoy my people and the
[1:03:02] voice of weeping
[1:03:05] there won't be no more caskets laying
[1:03:08] before a Pulpit and there's weeping and
[1:03:11] crying and missing and carrying off the
[1:03:13] voice of weeping shall be no more hurt
[1:03:16] in her
[1:03:17] nor the voice of Christ and this is the
[1:03:20] New Jerusalem this is the millennium
[1:03:27] he's the god of the amen
[1:03:32] Amen brother I don't talk about he said
[1:03:34] see the Old Testament was showing you
[1:03:36] the god of the amens the god of Truth
[1:03:38] the Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the
[1:03:40] new
[1:03:41] finishers
[1:03:43] God finished every story
[1:03:47] and Jesus came to finish
[1:03:51] and then he said you know what I'm going
[1:03:53] to need some finishers in the last day
[1:03:56] and the only way I'm going to better get
[1:03:58] finishers is they're going to have to
[1:03:59] have the finisher in them
[1:04:03] because those that walked with him they
[1:04:06] wasn't willing to finish ask Peter he
[1:04:08] denied him
[1:04:10] well I walk with Jesus that walking with
[1:04:12] him wasn't enough
[1:04:13] amen so Jesus knew that just being with
[1:04:15] me ain't enough he said therefore I got
[1:04:17] to go away so I can send the comforter
[1:04:20] so I can send the power that you can
[1:04:23] finish like I have finished that you
[1:04:25] will go and do the things that I have
[1:04:27] done not even the things just that I've
[1:04:28] done but greater than this shall you do
[1:04:31] because I'm going to not just be with
[1:04:33] you I'm going to be in you and I'm going
[1:04:35] to put the finisher on the inside of you
[1:04:38] the one amen that has given me the
[1:04:40] strength to carry the cross the one
[1:04:42] that's going to give me the strength to
[1:04:44] go down into hell and to knock on hell
[1:04:46] and the pump to punch the devil in the
[1:04:48] face and to slam the door in his face
[1:04:50] and to go back to the to the region of
[1:04:52] the lost and preach to them and then go
[1:04:54] to my Saints and tell them it's time to
[1:04:56] go home and the resurrection I'm going
[1:04:58] to give you that finisher and that
[1:05:00] finisher is going to be inside of you
[1:05:02] that when you get in the race and this
[1:05:04] comes against you and that comes against
[1:05:06] you this one says something over there
[1:05:07] that said something over there the devil
[1:05:09] Bops you over her head on a Wednesday
[1:05:11] morning get you in a foul mood but all
[1:05:13] about three o'clock there's something
[1:05:15] moving around

[1:05:20] the house of God Amen what is it there's
[1:05:22] a finisher on the inside of you and it's
[1:05:25] going to finish the race
[1:05:27] if it has to Bear a cross if it has to
[1:05:30] die whatever it's going to finish
[1:05:34] [Music]
[1:05:39] he's the god of the amen
[1:05:42] and he never changes
[1:05:45] Sophie write something about you
[1:05:49] and it gives you a part to play
[1:05:52] and in this script you're giving this
[1:05:53] part son daughter

[1:06:12] title of daughter he ain't about to

[1:06:33] with me in my Throne just as I have
[1:06:35] overcome and sat with my father in his
[1:06:37] throne so he wrote you that way
[1:06:39] therefore you can't come and sit with
[1:06:41] that one didn't do it
[1:06:45] um
[1:06:46] he just writes the story
[1:06:48] and he changes the the not just not your
[1:06:51] story not who you are he just writes it
[1:06:54] around to bring you to the place where
[1:06:57] you got to be
[1:06:59] as job
[1:07:07] God wanted to ride himself in the job's
[1:07:09] story so the Devil comes by and he says
[1:07:12] and God says have you considered my
[1:07:14] servant job
[1:07:17] well yeah I've considered him but you
[1:07:19] know what this store is rigged
[1:07:23] you put a wall around him and I can't
[1:07:25] get to him he said well let me write a
[1:07:27] little something in here I'm going to
[1:07:28] take the wall down do everything but
[1:07:30] destroy his life but he will not deny me
[1:07:37] and job ends up you know all the
[1:07:39] destruction he went through and you know
[1:07:41] what he had some church members about
[1:07:43] three of them come over there and try to
[1:07:44] give him some comfort I listened to that
[1:07:45] the other day and I thought God have
[1:07:46] mercy don't send me no comforters like
[1:07:48] that
[1:07:50] don't send me nothing like that amen
[1:07:52] well you hadn't done something job it
[1:07:54] has to be some sin in your life job has
[1:07:56] to be something oh God was just writing
[1:07:58] a story and God was going to bring him
[1:08:01] to an expected end and you know the the
[1:08:03] latter of job's life was going to be
[1:08:05] greater than the farmer
[1:08:07] his end was going to be greater than his
[1:08:10] beginning
[1:08:12] come on now and yours will be the same
[1:08:14] way wait man when you say well I just
[1:08:16] began I got the Holy Ghost and yes you
[1:08:19] that's a wonderful thing we all got to
[1:08:20] have it praise God we've got to have a
[1:08:23] finisher in your life amen but that is
[1:08:25] just a deposit
[1:08:27] that's a down payment of what's going to
[1:08:31] come
[1:08:36] he's going to finish it
[1:08:38] and at the end of Joe's story
[1:08:42] was it Allahu is that his name
[1:08:45] came into the story
[1:08:47] he said job let me show you a few things
[1:08:51] get up off that ass Heap
[1:08:53] get up off that ass sheep I want you to
[1:08:56] look past where you're at I want to look
[1:08:58] past all that my ashes and that
[1:09:00] destruction around you and I want you to
[1:09:02] catch another vision
[1:09:05] and he lifted him up to a place to where
[1:09:08] he could look thousands of years later
[1:09:10] and job hey I know my redeemer living
[1:09:15] there he is that's the finisher and
[1:09:18] those skin worms destroy my body yet in
[1:09:21] my flesh I will see God
[1:09:29] he never changes what he does never
[1:09:32] change what he says it stands fast he
[1:09:34] does it and it's done forever
[1:09:38] that's quite the finisher none can take
[1:09:41] from what he says or add to what he says
[1:09:45] the devil wants to add to it well your
[1:09:47] son but
[1:09:50] you're a daughter but
[1:09:52] no no nobody can add to what he said he
[1:09:55] said Son
[1:09:56] he said daughter
[1:09:58] he said overcomer
[1:10:01] he said Satan Bruiser he said Satan
[1:10:04] Stomper
[1:10:06] and nothing can add or take away from
[1:10:08] what he says so let it be amen so let it
[1:10:10] be aren't you glad you served that kind
[1:10:12] of God
[1:10:14] I don't know about you I said it before
[1:10:16] but I'm sure glad I don't serve a god
[1:10:18] who's so fickle that one day he loves me
[1:10:20] and the next day he don't one day I'm
[1:10:22] his and one next day I'm not that ain't
[1:10:25] God if God ever loved you he's always
[1:10:27] going to love you if God ever called you
[1:10:29] you're always going to be called if you
[1:10:31] ever was a son or a daughter in his mind
[1:10:33] you're always going to be a daughter or
[1:10:35] son in his mind he's never going to take
[1:10:37] his pen and strike you out if he wrote
[1:10:39] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life God
[1:10:42] himself cannot take that away
[1:10:46] amen the devil tries he tries to erase
[1:10:48] it all the time but he ain't got nothing
[1:10:50] powerful enough to take that name off of
[1:10:53] the Lamb's Book of Life It Was Written
[1:10:55] there before the foundation of the world
[1:10:57] and what the author says stays
[1:11:00] and he's going to finish it
[1:11:02] these things saith amen I like that it
[1:11:05] means that whatever he said is final
[1:11:11] so did you get cancer it ain't what you
[1:11:13] said is final
[1:11:14] it ain't what your boss said is final it
[1:11:17] ain't what somebody else said it's fine
[1:11:18] it ain't what the devil says is final
[1:11:20] it's What God Says is finally
[1:11:23] the devil says you're sick but that's
[1:11:25] not final
[1:11:28] what's final is what God Said
[1:11:30] I'm the Lord God that heals all diseases
[1:11:33] amen the devil said you've done this
[1:11:35] you've done that but that's not final
[1:11:36] the devil says you're lost that's not
[1:11:38] final
[1:11:41] Hallelujah but God said you're an
[1:11:44] overcomer amen
[1:11:47] God said you're you're you're more than
[1:11:50] able
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:56] it means that what he started out with
[1:11:58] in Genesis he will finish in Revelations
[1:12:01] he has to for he is the amen so let it
[1:12:04] be so we can see why the devil hates the
[1:12:06] Book of Revelation or Genesis and
[1:12:08] Revelations he hates the truth he knows
[1:12:11] the truth will prevail he knows what his
[1:12:14] end will be
[1:12:17] Hallelujah he's already read the back of
[1:12:20] the book
[1:12:21] and he knows there ain't nothing he can
[1:12:23] do to change the end of his story
[1:12:27] that makes me able to run around this
[1:12:29] place because the devil wants to try to
[1:12:32] tell you he's going to last longer than
[1:12:33] you he tries to tell you he's going to
[1:12:35] overcome you he tries to tell you I'm
[1:12:37] greater than you know the back of the
[1:12:39] book says there's a pit of fire that
[1:12:41] you're going to be thrown into and
[1:12:43] there's no going to be no more to you
[1:12:45] forever amen and while you're down there
[1:12:47] burning and carrying on and screaming
[1:12:49] I'm going to be on the heels of Glory
[1:12:51] shouting the victory
[1:12:52] [Applause]
[1:12:54] the devil knows the end of his story
[1:12:57] and he knows you're into
[1:13:02] these things saith the faithful and true
[1:13:04] Witness
[1:13:07] he's faithful it's true
[1:13:10] he said
[1:13:12] is you know he said many people think
[1:13:14] make you want to view him as being
[1:13:16] impersonal
[1:13:17] but he's a very personal God
[1:13:19] as though God made us it looks like as
[1:13:21] though God made a way of salvation for
[1:13:23] lost Mankind and wave being the cross
[1:13:25] and then the death of the Cross of
[1:13:27] Christ has atone for our sins
[1:13:28] Resurrection gave us an open door to him
[1:13:31] and God just folded his arms and stood
[1:13:32] back it is if we major in believing in a
[1:13:35] great Creator who's have created lost
[1:13:37] personal interest in his creation Now
[1:13:39] say that is how too many people are apt
[1:13:42] to think but that's the wrong thinking
[1:13:44] for God is governing in the Affairs of
[1:13:47] men right now he's both Creator and
[1:13:51] sustainer
[1:13:56] Hallelujah and he's in the midst of his
[1:13:59] church he's working all things at this
[1:14:02] moment according to the purpose of his
[1:14:04] own will he's in the midst of it all
[1:14:06] he's a great Creator savior God is
[1:14:08] faithful Faithfully working amongst his
[1:14:11] own right now as a great Shepherd of the
[1:14:13] sheep his very own existence he is his
[1:14:16] very existence is for his own he loves
[1:14:19] him and cares for them His Eye Is ever
[1:14:22] upon them when the word says that your
[1:14:24] lives are hidden with Christ and God it
[1:14:26] means exactly what it says oh I'm so
[1:14:28] glad that my God abides faithful he is
[1:14:31] true to himself he won't lie he is true
[1:14:34] to his word he will back it up he's true
[1:14:36] to us he will lose not one of us but
[1:14:39] will raise us up in the last day I'm
[1:14:42] glad I can rest in that kind of
[1:14:44] faithfulness
[1:14:48] Philippians 1 6 says being confident of
[1:14:52] this very thing
[1:14:53] he that has begun a good work and you
[1:14:55] will perform it unto the day of Jesus
[1:14:58] Christ
[1:15:02] John let's look at one last thought on
[1:15:05] the finisher amen John chapter 19 and
[1:15:08] verse 30 said when Jesus therefore had
[1:15:10] received the vinegar he said it is
[1:15:13] finished
[1:15:17] it is finished and he bowed his head
[1:15:21] and gave up the ghosts but I understand
[1:15:24] when the Great Shepherd was smitten that
[1:15:27] great shape Prophet when he was smitten
[1:15:29] back there he said it is finished and
[1:15:31] that minute as soon as a Shepherd was
[1:15:34] smitten it was over
[1:15:36] sin is settled
[1:15:38] there's no more to sin they were clean
[1:15:41] the penalty was paid the Believers whose

[1:20:59] amen we're climbing to the place of
[1:21:01] Ascension
[1:21:04] why do you think that Caleb wanted the
[1:21:06] mountains

[1:21:26] inside of for Caleb something about it

[1:21:36] God's glory is going to be revealed and
[1:21:38] I want to be there we're all climbing up

[1:22:02] every sickness of every disease of every
[1:22:05] devil of every Spirit of hell
[1:22:11] Hallelujah because when we cross that
[1:22:14] Finish Line it is finished
[1:22:16] [Applause]
[1:22:21] so why would we give up when we're so
[1:22:23] close to home
[1:22:31] Mercy
[1:22:33] bring this down
[1:22:39] Paul
[1:22:40] would write about it
[1:22:43] in second Timothy 4 and verse 6 he said
[1:22:45] for I am now ready to be offered
[1:22:48] and the time of my departure is at hand
[1:22:51] but I fought a good fight
[1:22:55] I say I've said before I say it again if
[1:22:57] we're going to fight let's make it a
[1:22:58] good fight
[1:23:00] let's make sure the devil knows we fight
[1:23:05] we ain't laying over and just giving him
[1:23:07] the right of way
[1:23:09] no no we didn't come this far to just
[1:23:11] lay over and let the devil run Rob rip
[1:23:13] shot over the top of us and make fun of
[1:23:15] us no no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:23:16] no
[1:23:18] but there's an authority in the body of
[1:23:20] Christ there's a finisher there I have
[1:23:22] fought a good fight I have finished my
[1:23:24] finished my course I have kept the faith
[1:23:28] that's a good finish I've kept the faith
[1:23:30] henceforth there's laid up for me a
[1:23:32] crown of righteousness with the Lord the
[1:23:34] righteous judge should give me at that
[1:23:36] day and not me only but to all of them
[1:23:40] also that love is appearing
[1:23:44] of the other finishers
[1:23:47] will also have this crowd of
[1:23:49] righteousness
[1:23:51] First Corinthians 9 verse 24 says know
[1:23:53] you not that they which run in a race
[1:23:55] run all
[1:23:57] but one receiveth the prize so run that
[1:24:00] you may obtain
[1:24:02] that's on the Earthly race and he said
[1:24:04] every man that's striving for the master
[1:24:06] is tempered in all things in other words
[1:24:07] what they win is temporary
[1:24:11] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[1:24:14] crown but we and an incorruptible
[1:24:17] I therefore so run not as uncertainty so
[1:24:20] fight I not as one that beats the air
[1:24:22] but I keep my body and I breathe I keep
[1:24:25] under my body and I bring it into
[1:24:27] subjection less by any means when I
[1:24:29] preach the others I myself might be a
[1:24:33] Castaway
[1:24:34] started good
[1:24:36] finish
[1:24:38] there's preachers that start good
[1:24:40] but they didn't finish
[1:24:42] they're wrecks
[1:24:45] all looked like great gifts and great
[1:24:47] anointings and great powers and singers
[1:24:49] and players of music and this that and
[1:24:51] the other and then today laying along
[1:24:54] the sides of the road
[1:24:57] off on some trail somewhere
[1:25:00] and they didn't finish
[1:25:05] read the scripture again being confident
[1:25:07] of this very thing he that which begun a
[1:25:10] good work in you will perform it it will
[1:25:13] accomplish it it will finish there will
[1:25:16] be a performance made
[1:25:18] to bring to an expected end this is the
[1:25:21] meaning of it to accomplish something to
[1:25:23] perfect something to execute something
[1:25:25] to complete something
[1:25:27] oh my he's going to bring it and when we
[1:25:31] come to that moment of crossing the
[1:25:33] finish line
[1:25:34] that day
[1:25:36] you see Jesus face to face
[1:25:42] it'll be worth it all
[1:25:49] when you come to that last moment
[1:25:51] the dead in Christ rise and we go to
[1:25:54] meet him in the air
[1:25:56] all of the moments that you spent
[1:25:59] from whatever your dash was
[1:26:03] you know that's what I was thinking
[1:26:04] about the other day on tombstones 1960
[1:26:08] to 2000 and
[1:26:10] one there's a dash in between
[1:26:14] all that really matters is what happens
[1:26:16] in that Dash
[1:26:18] that little bitty spot
[1:26:22] and in that Dash can be a lot of hurts
[1:26:25] can be a lot of pressures can be a lot
[1:26:27] of persecution can be a lot of people
[1:26:30] walked away from me
[1:26:31] can be a lot of things that just stuck
[1:26:34] so deep
[1:26:37] but past that Dash
[1:26:39] whether you go by the way of the grave
[1:26:42] or whether you go into body change
[1:26:44] all of a sudden that Dash is going to
[1:26:47] seem so insignificant
[1:26:50] all that toll and all that running and
[1:26:53] all that
[1:26:54] pressuring all that torment and all
[1:26:57] those mind battles and all all the
[1:27:00] things that Satan tried to stop you and
[1:27:02] trip you along the way and you fell down
[1:27:04] you skint yourself and you got back up
[1:27:06] and you kept pushing and you fell down
[1:27:09] you got back up and you kept pushing
[1:27:11] somebody stuck their foot out and
[1:27:12] tripped you and you got back up and you
[1:27:14] kept pushing all in that Dash
[1:27:18] all of a sudden
[1:27:20] you see his face
[1:27:23] that Dash is not going to mean so much
[1:27:26] it's not going to hurt so much
[1:27:29] it's not going to make you cry so much
[1:27:32] it's not going to be worrying no more
[1:27:34] because you will be transformed
[1:27:37] in that moment to be like him
[1:27:42] not just him being in you
[1:27:44] but your whole body be transformed into
[1:27:48] the finisher
[1:27:53] all your weaknesses will be gone
[1:27:58] you had to limp all the way down the
[1:28:00] last miles
[1:28:01] crippled up in some kind of condition
[1:28:03] it'll be over with
[1:28:07] all your weaknesses will be gone
[1:28:12] you had to drag legs how to make
[1:28:13] yourself get up had to make yourself go
[1:28:15] it'd all be gone all your failures and
[1:28:18] all your frailties will all be gone
[1:28:22] all your insecurities
[1:28:25] will all be gone
[1:28:28] you'll be transformed into Perfection
[1:28:31] that day and you will totally reflect
[1:28:34] the glory of God the finisher
[1:28:42] First John 3 said beloved now are we the
[1:28:45] sons of God it does not yet appear what
[1:28:47] we shall be but we know that when he
[1:28:50] shall appear we shall be like him
[1:28:54] amen and we shall be like him for we
[1:28:57] shall see him as he is
[1:29:02] all of the dash
[1:29:05] insecurities
[1:29:07] the complexes
[1:29:09] the things that tried to hinder you in
[1:29:11] every step of the journey
[1:29:13] all of a sudden you cross that line
[1:29:18] and it's all gone
[1:29:23] and all you're looking at is the face of
[1:29:26] Jesus
[1:29:30] what's he going to say well done
[1:29:35] you finished
[1:29:38] you made it
[1:29:41] he wasn't the one who ran the fastest
[1:29:44] he wasn't the one who carried the most
[1:29:46] burdens you may not be the one who who
[1:29:49] had the most battles
[1:29:54] you might be the one who carries the
[1:29:56] most burdens
[1:29:57] you might get the most rewards of all
[1:29:59] the battles but the most important thing
[1:30:01] is you finished
[1:30:06] all of us here about the Finish
[1:30:07] Revelations 21 and 1 and I saw a new
[1:30:09] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[1:30:12] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[1:30:14] away
[1:30:16] man that makes me want to shout because
[1:30:19] I know in that first Earth there was a
[1:30:21] lot of Mind battles in that first Earth
[1:30:23] there was a lot of devils of torment and
[1:30:25] it's passed away and there was no more
[1:30:28] sea and I John saw that holy city New
[1:30:31] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:30:33] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a
[1:30:35] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[1:30:37] Heaven said behold the Tabernacle of God
[1:30:40] is with men and he will dwell with them
[1:30:42] and they shall be his people and God
[1:30:45] himself shall be with them and be their
[1:30:48] God and God shall wipe away all tears
[1:30:53] to all glory all those things that
[1:30:56] happened in that Dash it's all going to
[1:30:58] be wiped away from their eyes and
[1:31:00] there'll be no more death
[1:31:02] there'll be no more sorrow there'll be
[1:31:04] no more cry there'll be no more pain for
[1:31:07] the former thing did you hear that devil
[1:31:09] for the former things are passed away
[1:31:16] Hallelujah and he that settle the
[1:31:19] Thrones and behold I make all things new
[1:31:22] and he said unto me right for these
[1:31:24] words are true and faithful and he said
[1:31:27] unto me it is done
[1:31:31] whoa there's a finisher again it is done
[1:31:35] I am the alpha I am the Omega I am the
[1:31:39] beginning I am the end I give unto him
[1:31:42] that is thirst of The Fountains of the
[1:31:43] water life freely and he that overcometh
[1:31:46] oh do you hear the author writing your
[1:31:47] story amen he that overcometh shall
[1:31:50] inherit all things and I will be his God
[1:31:54] and he shall be my son
[1:31:59] so he wrote you at a sign at the
[1:32:01] beginning and he's writing you as a son
[1:32:03] at the end
[1:32:07] Hallelujah
[1:32:08] Hallelujah
[1:32:11] oh my but the fearful and the
[1:32:15] unbelievers and the Abominable and the
[1:32:17] murders and the whoremongers and the
[1:32:20] sorcerers and the idolaters and all
[1:32:22] liars to have their part of the language
[1:32:25] partner with fire and brimstone which is
[1:32:27] the second death

[1:33:08] farmer to ever give up
