[20:00] proud I am of you the church here at
[20:03] evening light Tabernacle now I just tell
[20:05] you how I envision our church I'm Vision

[20:13] under our branches and we are glad that
[20:16] you were able to come even for a weekend
[20:19] or some of you been through here since
[20:21] Wednesday and just to sit down and just
[20:24] rest under the coolness of the of the
[20:28] shade that the Lord has provided for us
[20:31] here and and uh I I just want to say
[20:34] that our God is more than enough
[20:37] amen he is a provider for every need
[20:40] that we could have if you look out on
[20:44] this campus and everything that we have
[20:46] had we've never taken a note on
[20:47] everything everything God gave us gave
[20:50] us everything
[20:52] debt free and we have been blessed
[20:56] abundantly
[20:57] because he's a God that does that he is
[21:00] more than enough
[21:02] and I'll tell you I challenge you just
[21:04] to believe God for your need because
[21:06] he's a god that is more than enough not
[21:10] just enough he's more than enough he
[21:13] don't just bless us he does exceeding
[21:15] abundantly above that which you're able
[21:17] to think or ask
[21:19] that's the God we serve so we're so
[21:22] thankful to the Lord for that and I want
[21:25] to say I appreciate the ministers that
[21:27] have come and we have the McGary uh
[21:30] church that has been here brother Billy
[21:32] in Bowie II and brother Matthew McGarry
[21:35] and and uh and and even brother Bowie's
[21:39] father-in-law all the way from the Congo
[21:41] so he's a pastor there and and in the
[21:44] Congo this is a very small church I mean
[21:47] this this group gives a very small group
[21:50] uh you know they they number in the
[21:53] thousands there sometimes you think oh
[21:56] on this one or two of us believes this
[21:58] message no God's got a people around the
[22:02] world
[22:03] and when the prophet of God sorry as a
[22:06] bride from every nation and the
[22:09] scripture says he's from every nation
[22:11] Kindred tongue and people
[22:14] and so therefore we have a
[22:16] responsibility as the children of God to
[22:20] um to welcome everyone from around the
[22:22] world because that's what God does Amen
[22:26] good to have the the Ministries here
[22:28] with brother Wayne Lawson from from Ohio
[22:32] to and and of course those that have
[22:34] came from the genyan why we just come
[22:37] from the East and West and wherever
[22:39] you're from we're just happy you're here
[22:41] amen and one day we won't ever have to
[22:44] part
[22:45] yeah it's always a little sadness when
[22:47] you come down to the last service of a
[22:50] meeting and and it is a little bit of oh
[22:53] my I wish we could just one one more day
[22:56] you know one more time every time you
[22:59] come into God's presence it's that way
[23:01] you just say just a little more Lord
[23:04] just a little more amen so we thank the
[23:07] Lord for his goodness today we're going
[23:10] to go to prayer for some needs we have
[23:12] our sister Danette Pruitt now this is
[23:15] really close to home this is my my
[23:17] brother's wife my brother Dan and we
[23:20] married sisters so this is my wife's
[23:23] Karen's sister and she has come down
[23:27] with uh indolent lymphoma she had a
[23:30] growth removed from her spine and it got
[23:33] down where she was not able to even walk
[23:35] and she needs to be able to walk again
[23:37] she's after surgery she's able to take a
[23:41] few steps but she really needs the Lord
[23:44] to undertake for her are and and she's
[23:47] undergoing radiation treatments starting
[23:50] tomorrow and they're going to do it five
[23:52] days in a row and break for the weekend
[23:54] five days for a room I think for about
[23:56] the next three weeks so we need prayer
[23:58] for her
[24:00] um nothing will stand before our prayers
[24:03] not even cancer
[24:05] not even cancers
[24:08] remember well brother Tim you know well
[24:11] then we don't need doctors or we don't
[24:13] now God uses doctors too
[24:16] you see I Envision it like the four
[24:19] living creatures Before the Throne
[24:22] and I think of it as God who who uses
[24:28] these anointings and of course we know
[24:31] the primary use was down to the church
[24:33] ages the lion the ox the man the eagle
[24:35] and the anointings that would come upon
[24:38] the people for the age to give them
[24:40] preparation but they were their
[24:43] anointings of Deliverance
[24:45] sometimes sometimes God gives us
[24:47] courageous Faith Like a Lion with real
[24:50] boldness and we we're with tenacity to
[24:53] hold on to a promise and take hold of
[24:55] the promise of God and other times you
[24:59] know it's the eagle anointing and it
[25:00] just snatches you right out of the out
[25:03] of your situation and the Miracle
[25:05] happens and that's God's way he does
[25:08] that amen sometimes you know the the
[25:11] face then will turn towards you and and
[25:14] it's the face of a man and God used the
[25:16] intelligence of a man
[25:18] and God will use doctors but he's the
[25:20] Healer doctors can heal but God will use
[25:24] them and set the arms he said well you
[25:27] know
[25:28] um if the arm was broke well yeah you'd
[25:31] go to a doctor and he'd set the arm but
[25:33] it would be God that would heal
[25:36] well God can do it without that we had a
[25:38] little little girl that fractured her
[25:40] arm and that was going to have to put
[25:41] rods in it and stay in there for a year
[25:44] and and after coming to the prayer line
[25:46] went back the next day no surgery needed
[25:49] totally healed you know it it's just
[25:52] that kind of God that does that
[25:59] they just put it in a cast to stabilize
[26:02] it but our God's A Healer
[26:04] so we don't look to man
[26:06] but sometimes sometimes the face will
[26:09] turn and it's the ox anointing or the
[26:12] calf anointing and it's the Beast of
[26:14] sacrifices it represents death but God
[26:18] even heals in death
[26:20] because in just one moment you can go
[26:23] from being the most sickest weakest down
[26:26] in the bed unable to move no nothing and
[26:30] they're turned back into a young person
[26:32] in just one second that's the ultimate
[26:36] healing amen so you know even in that
[26:39] that's not when people die that's not a
[26:42] denial of Faith or nothing wrong with
[26:45] our faith these all died in faith
[26:48] amen so we believe God no matter which
[26:51] way it is whether God wants to do it
[26:52] with the boldness of a lion with the
[26:54] miracle of the eagle with the
[26:56] intelligence of a man or whether it's
[26:58] even a graduation here is all God doing
[27:02] the healing so we're looking to him so
[27:04] we want to remember he said brother Tim
[27:06] what's his prayer requests mean and I
[27:09] and you know does it make a difference
[27:11] well let me just share with this with
[27:13] you last year we prayed for Wanda
[27:16] Underwood

[27:21] Brother Stephen Massengale and she was
[27:24] not fully conscious she was on a
[27:26] ventilator at at Vanderbilt and the
[27:30] prayer request said needs the Lord to
[27:32] intervene she needs to wake up

[28:20] 80. if you're 21 instead of 21 year old
[28:23] and if you have 68 to 68 year old but
[28:27] said it before you and step by step you
[28:29] walk into that vision and you begin to
[28:33] confess the promise of God to say it's
[28:35] mine and God has healed Me by his
[28:39] stripes I am healed it is my future it
[28:42] is now and today I'm taking another step
[28:44] into that body

[1:04:07] troubles and all the things that are

[1:04:51] pray amen
[1:04:53] and amen and God bless you amen if you
[1:04:57] have your Bibles today we want to look
[1:04:59] into the scripture in the book of
[1:05:01] Philippians the third chapter
[1:05:03] in the 20th verse Philippians 3 20 21
[1:05:07] and we'll also be looking at First
[1:05:09] Corinthians 15 and 51.
[1:05:12] amen what a what a tremendous message
[1:05:15] last night I don't have to ask you if
[1:05:17] you enjoyed it I know you did amen and
[1:05:19] it was a tremendous blessing to be able
[1:05:23] to be here and to fellowship and I was
[1:05:26] kind of hoping brother would just preach
[1:05:27] again today as is what my he he didn't
[1:05:30] even acknowledge me
[1:05:32] and uh
[1:05:35] amen but we appreciate him giving to us
[1:05:38] so wonderfully and of his energies in
[1:05:41] Philippians chapter 3 and verse 20.
[1:05:44] for our conversation is in heaven
[1:05:47] for once also we look for the savior
[1:05:50] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:53] who shall change our vile body so Paul
[1:05:56] is not just asking he's declaring the
[1:05:59] Lord Jesus Christ who shall change
[1:06:03] out of our body that it may be fashioned
[1:06:06] like an under his glorious body now if
[1:06:09] one someone ever asks you if that there
[1:06:13] is an actual body of Jesus Paul believed
[1:06:15] that
[1:06:16] he said that it may be fashioned like an
[1:06:19] unto his glorious body according to the
[1:06:22] work and whereby he is able to subdue
[1:06:25] all things unto himself
[1:06:28] now in First Corinthians 15 and 51
[1:06:31] we want to read here
[1:06:33] Apostle Paul
[1:06:35] he's that Apostle to the Gentile Church
[1:06:39] he brought some beautiful things to us
[1:06:42] the letter to the Corinthians is a
[1:06:43] letter of Correction of course but he
[1:06:45] put some promises in there
[1:06:47] was very powerful in First Corinthians
[1:06:50] 15 51 I'm just going to read the one
[1:06:51] verse behold I show you a mystery
[1:06:55] we shall not all sleep
[1:06:58] but we shall all
[1:07:00] be changed
[1:07:02] we ask the Lord to bless his words you
[1:07:04] couldn't be seated this morning
[1:07:06] we shall not all sleep
[1:07:09] but we shall all be changed I'd like to
[1:07:11] speak to you in just a few minutes today
[1:07:13] upon the mystery of our change
[1:07:16] upon the mystery of our change you know
[1:07:20] I believe we're living in Changing Times
[1:07:23] I don't really believe that we would
[1:07:25] have to stand here all day to declare
[1:07:27] that the seasons are changing the times
[1:07:29] are changing but I believe if you're
[1:07:31] just just living in this life just now
[1:07:34] that you see so many changes someone
[1:07:37] that who was born in the early 1900s
[1:07:39] that would still be here there's been so
[1:07:42] many changes from my parents in the from
[1:07:45] the 1940s till right now there's been so
[1:07:47] many changes on the planet there's so
[1:07:49] many things that's happening that there
[1:07:51] would just be impossible for you to deny
[1:07:53] that there is great change that has
[1:07:55] taken place and is taking place as we
[1:07:58] speak change is happening so quick but
[1:08:01] as the changes come development
[1:08:03] knowledge as the scripture said that it
[1:08:05] would come of course we know there's two
[1:08:07] great trees coming to fruit there's the
[1:08:09] tree of life and there's also the tree
[1:08:10] of knowledge into evil and it's all
[1:08:13] coming to to the to fertition at the
[1:08:15] same time now in this kind of time that
[1:08:17] we're living a prophet predicts the
[1:08:19] greatest storms that ever was given
[1:08:21] spiritually speaking would strike this
[1:08:24] age this would be the season of time
[1:08:26] when confusion would take over churches
[1:08:28] that it would become a famine to even
[1:08:31] understand what the real word of God is
[1:08:33] because so many people are saying so
[1:08:35] many things so clouds of lies and deceit
[1:08:38] and the storms of of denominational
[1:08:40] understandings and it would just be
[1:08:42] scattered so much that it would
[1:08:44] literally just become a Gloom over the
[1:08:46] Earth and people wouldn't really even
[1:08:48] know what to believe or how to believe
[1:08:50] it is a it is the tactic of the devil to
[1:08:53] cause confusion so that everybody
[1:08:55] doesn't trust anything that is said so
[1:08:58] that it breaks down the levels of trust
[1:09:00] now we realize that there's a lot of
[1:09:03] things said now I'm I'm just an old
[1:09:05] country boy and you all forgive me but I
[1:09:07] grew up raccoon hunting up there in
[1:09:08] Arkansas and we we did it with a with an
[1:09:10] old dog it was an old I had an Old Red
[1:09:12] Dog it wasn't very good actually mostly
[1:09:14] tree possum but I enjoyed going you know
[1:09:17] it was a it was always a good time to go
[1:09:19] and uh and you know 15 I couldn't hardly
[1:09:22] get anybody go with me so a lot of times
[1:09:24] I went by myself but sometimes it was
[1:09:26] better going by yourself because you
[1:09:27] didn't have to argue about Direction you
[1:09:29] know there's nothing worse than it is
[1:09:31] getting in the woods with a pile of guys
[1:09:32] and you know you're you're somewhere's
[1:09:34] way off from the pickup and you've been
[1:09:36] walking for three or four hours and a
[1:09:37] little bit of fog sales and there's no
[1:09:39] stars and we nobody carried compasses
[1:09:42] when I was a kid you know you just took
[1:09:44] off and went back to the truck but there
[1:09:46] was always those guys you know you get
[1:09:47] on the you get on flat ground it's a
[1:09:49] little different than it is in heels but
[1:09:50] there's always those guys that they are
[1:09:52] sure that the truck's that way
[1:09:55] and the truck is actually that way and
[1:09:58] that is the weirdest feeling you've ever
[1:09:59] had because you want to be nice and go
[1:10:01] with them but but but if you do you know
[1:10:04] I'm going to walk that way an hour and
[1:10:06] then I got to turn around and come right
[1:10:07] back where I'm at and so it's a little
[1:10:09] bit hard on you so so what you do is you
[1:10:12] you you know you're praying that somehow
[1:10:14] you can convince everybody this is the
[1:10:16] right direction you know and uh and you
[1:10:18] know brother Branham talks a lot about
[1:10:20] that when he talks about uh in Hurricane
[1:10:22] Mountain when he got lost chasing
[1:10:24] remember he got going around in circles
[1:10:26] but there was something about the story
[1:10:28] of Hurricane Mountain that was so
[1:10:30] powerful is that he said Remember the
[1:10:32] fog cleared enough that he got a view of
[1:10:34] Hurricane Mountain so what he needed was
[1:10:37] a view of a landmark to set a direction
[1:10:40] and once the direction was set he knew
[1:10:43] which way to walk now what we find then
[1:10:45] is that there are landmarks in the
[1:10:48] message of the hour there are quotes
[1:10:50] that stick out to the message believer
[1:10:52] and those are landmarks and we don't
[1:10:54] want to move the land and March because
[1:10:55] they're what keeps the right direction
[1:10:57] for the church for the people of God see
[1:10:59] in the season that we're living right
[1:11:01] now with all these things happening with
[1:11:03] all these troubles going on with the
[1:11:05] coved and with all the persecutions of
[1:11:07] the church and all these things it's
[1:11:09] easy for people begin to say well it
[1:11:11] looks like the church could start going
[1:11:12] through some tribulation or we've got
[1:11:14] some a great uh persecutions to happen
[1:11:17] into the church how many realizes that
[1:11:19] there's a whole movement of people that
[1:11:21] are looking for a great squeeze or a
[1:11:23] pressure to the place that the church is
[1:11:25] going to get in position if they get
[1:11:28] enough pressure put on them well I have
[1:11:30] to be honest with you you if you study
[1:11:32] very long or you're involved in a church
[1:11:34] actually the more pressure you put on
[1:11:36] people the more division comes if they
[1:11:38] don't like each other
[1:11:40] amen and you know somebody said well
[1:11:42] brother Wayne it was a I I know brother
[1:11:44] bam said some things early on but you
[1:11:46] know in 1964 mother Branham says this he
[1:11:49] said will the bride go through the
[1:11:51] persecution as the early Apostolic
[1:11:53] Church did this is a question amen will
[1:11:56] the bride go through a persecution as
[1:11:58] the early Apostolic Church did answer
[1:12:00] from a word Prophet no I just explained
[1:12:03] a few minutes ago the next thing is a
[1:12:06] rapture
[1:12:07] remember we're at the promised land
[1:12:09] we're at the border and you understand
[1:12:11] about the march of Israel now this is my
[1:12:14] thoughts ministering brother in my own
[1:12:16] way the way I feel the holy spirit is
[1:12:18] revealed to me the next thing that is to
[1:12:21] happen to the Gentile elected bride is
[1:12:23] to be caught up with the rest of the
[1:12:25] Gentile elected bride that's been down
[1:12:27] Through the Ages now the next thing so
[1:12:29] people say to me brother Wayne do you
[1:12:31] think we're going to have to go through
[1:12:32] these great trials and we're going to
[1:12:34] have a like a tribulation strike the
[1:12:36] church and there's going to be great
[1:12:37] what do you what do you think well let's
[1:12:39] ask a prophet what he thought and let
[1:12:41] that be the landmark so if it's a
[1:12:43] landmark it's the direction of the
[1:12:46] church that we're not looking for
[1:12:48] persecution we're looking for Rapture
[1:12:50] amen and it matters what you're looking
[1:12:52] for it determines on how you prepare for
[1:12:55] what you're doing if you're looking for
[1:12:57] a Rapture you want to get in the spirit
[1:12:59] of rapture if you're looking for a
[1:13:01] Rapture you want to get in the
[1:13:03] atmosphere of rapture amen now the
[1:13:05] scriptures uh declare it and I'm
[1:13:07] speaking here to a prophet he said now
[1:13:10] here in 1961 Abraham's Covenant he said
[1:13:14] now listen he says now one thing that
[1:13:17] did he did promise Abraham not one thing
[1:13:20] did he do to Abraham but what he's done
[1:13:22] to give this church except one thing
[1:13:24] that's the change of the body
[1:13:27] one thing the change of the body as it
[1:13:30] was in the days of Sodom so shall it be
[1:13:32] in the coming of the son of man we see
[1:13:34] the thing taking place right now what
[1:13:37] was the next thing the change of the
[1:13:39] body now here in the later in the quote
[1:13:42] the next thing coming of the Rapture of
[1:13:44] the church the change of the body of the
[1:13:46] sleeping of the Saints amen do you see
[1:13:49] what he's brother Ram is very
[1:13:50] specifically saying what we're looking
[1:13:52] to is the change of the body what we're
[1:13:55] looking for as a church is a change of
[1:13:58] the body amen now in north at night 1965
[1:14:01] brother bam said I don't see one thing
[1:14:03] that will hinder he said the coming of
[1:14:05] the Lord Jesus Christ outside of the
[1:14:07] Readiness of the church amen there's
[1:14:10] nothing hindering this morning outside
[1:14:13] the Readiness of the church isn't that
[1:14:15] powerful Amen to know that there is no
[1:14:18] scripture barring us from the change of
[1:14:21] our body the prophet of God said the
[1:14:23] spirit of God Has Come For the setting
[1:14:25] order of the coming of the Lord now
[1:14:27] there's a lot of things that are in
[1:14:28] order and out of order and I know that
[1:14:30] but one thing is in order this morning
[1:14:32] is the change of the body listen if
[1:14:35] you're here in the middle of this
[1:14:36] meeting and you feel like changing your
[1:14:37] body just go ahead
[1:14:40] amen if you're here in this morning and
[1:14:42] the elements in your body start
[1:14:43] transitioning on you don't hold that
[1:14:46] back just let it go and the rest of us
[1:14:48] will join in with you because it's in
[1:14:50] order that's the next thing that could
[1:14:52] happen you know it can happen before you
[1:14:55] leave this meeting this morning this is
[1:14:57] so up on us in this generation it could
[1:15:00] happen before we left the meeting today
[1:15:03] I am living in expectation of the change
[1:15:06] of my body somebody said well I tell you
[1:15:09] what this one might go before the
[1:15:11] Rapture and this one might go but you
[1:15:13] know you might never have another day in
[1:15:16] your life as a mortal being there could
[1:15:19] be something strike this meeting this
[1:15:21] morning that will change your body I
[1:15:24] believe that should be the expectation
[1:15:25] of the Church of the Living God I don't
[1:15:27] believe we're expecting Amen to go
[1:15:30] through another 100 years I don't
[1:15:31] believe we're expecting a bunch of
[1:15:33] tribulation what we're expecting is one
[1:15:36] more sweep of the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:38] Ghost to catch a fire that's Church of
[1:15:40] the Living God and to change our bodies
[1:15:43] in the moment in the twinkling of an
[1:15:45] hour that is what I am under expectation
[1:15:48] for the prophet of God said let me tell
[1:15:51] you this I can prove to you those
[1:15:53] Visions none of those Visions are wrong
[1:15:55] and were they not all fulfilled yes each
[1:15:58] one of them has been fulfilled or is in
[1:16:01] the process right now
[1:16:03] amen this day this scripture where are
[1:16:05] we at in this abrahamic age he said this
[1:16:07] has been such a great time where we're
[1:16:09] standing the great hour we're living in
[1:16:11] all the Visions have been fulfilled
[1:16:14] amen now the prophet says in the Feast
[1:16:16] of the trumpets it's a mystery that's
[1:16:18] got to be revealed now in this day by
[1:16:20] the son of man the evening message he
[1:16:22] says See it'll turn it back the last
[1:16:25] sign that was seen was the discernment
[1:16:27] before the change of the body
[1:16:30] amen here again paragraph 304 the
[1:16:33] trumpet sounds for Israel two prophets
[1:16:35] is ready to appear what is it the church
[1:16:37] must get off the scene so they can
[1:16:40] appear The Church Must Get Off the scene
[1:16:43] so they can appear do you see what he's
[1:16:45] saying the prophet over and over is same
[1:16:47] this is the time for change the only
[1:16:50] thing that's holding up the tribulation
[1:16:53] is you
[1:16:54] amen the only thing that's between you
[1:16:57] and an entire world plunged into
[1:16:59] tribulation is the church that's why we
[1:17:02] don't believe the church goes through
[1:17:04] tribulation we are the ones holding the
[1:17:07] tribulation from taking place now right
[1:17:10] now we're we're all aware of this huge
[1:17:13] thing going on with Russia
[1:17:15] I mean it's all over the newspapers it's
[1:17:18] all over the news channels it's it's
[1:17:19] everywhere because even American
[1:17:22] president just said we are closer to
[1:17:25] Armageddon right now than we were since
[1:17:28] the missile crisis in the 1960s can you
[1:17:31] imagine the 1960s when they were at the
[1:17:34] brink of the of the chains right there
[1:17:36] prophet of God actually said he met one
[1:17:39] of the generals from the Army in a in a
[1:17:41] little meeting he said the man said he
[1:17:43] had received orders to fire the missile
[1:17:45] back there in the 60s he said but
[1:17:48] something wouldn't let him fire it he
[1:17:50] said brother Graham said see and a few
[1:17:52] minutes later they called him and said
[1:17:54] see it was a blip on the screen it's a
[1:17:56] good thing you didn't fire the missile
[1:17:58] he said now why didn't the missile fire
[1:18:00] he said because there was somebody left
[1:18:02] on the earth that was a reason because
[1:18:05] somebody was left on the Earth
[1:18:07] now Church of the Living God Amen that
[1:18:10] is the 1960s God was waiting for a
[1:18:13] generation now you might not think
[1:18:15] you're worth anything you might not want
[1:18:17] you might wonder why you're here this
[1:18:19] morning but God has held back the hands
[1:18:21] of the time and tribulation because
[1:18:24] there is a bride who was coming there
[1:18:27] was a generation of Promise in this
[1:18:29] Bible one that will not hinder the
[1:18:32] changing of our body there has got to be
[1:18:34] a generation on the earth that will let
[1:18:36] this word so get alive in them and it
[1:18:40] will change not only their habits they
[1:18:42] will only change the way they think it
[1:18:44] will change their mortal bodies
[1:18:48] this Russia pushing like it is amen and
[1:18:51] I'm president saying these things I
[1:18:53] believe it right now I believe it's so
[1:18:55] close I believe it's so close right now
[1:18:57] I mean you you know even the the super
[1:19:00] wealthy of the world they're buying bomb
[1:19:02] shelters and building and building uh
[1:19:04] caves out of them amen that they could
[1:19:07] hide in they're going to Ole missile
[1:19:08] silos and they're equipping them
[1:19:10] preparing to survive a nuclear war some
[1:19:13] of them amen like Elon Musk is trying to
[1:19:15] get to Mars they're they they know they
[1:19:17] know they're trying to get a different
[1:19:18] place to live they know this is coming
[1:19:20] there is no way for it to be brother man
[1:19:23] said but you know I'm glad that we have
[1:19:25] a shelter
[1:19:27] I'm glad that we have a shelter for the
[1:19:30] name of the Lord is a mighty town that
[1:19:32] the righteous can run in he said no
[1:19:35] matter how many pounds no matter how
[1:19:37] many anything else we're going to be
[1:19:39] safe there he said so the world and the
[1:19:41] sinner is having a shelter or they've
[1:19:43] got a safety place and a shaken time but
[1:19:46] I believe if I wasn't a Christian I'd go
[1:19:49] crazy thinking of what might happen
[1:19:50] anytime I know there's a bunch of
[1:19:52] mothers sitting in here right now I know
[1:19:54] amen you're wondering what's going to
[1:19:56] happen by the way and what's going to
[1:19:57] happen how's this going to happen my
[1:19:58] family what's going to take place in my
[1:20:00] kitties brother man said if he wasn't a
[1:20:02] Christian he said I would go crazy with
[1:20:05] a house full of kids and everything I
[1:20:07] wouldn't know what to do but I'm glad
[1:20:09] that I can stand in my house and
[1:20:12] introduce them to a shelter that no bomb
[1:20:15] can ever touch or nothing else under the
[1:20:18] protecting wings of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:20] Christ not by power not by my mind but
[1:20:23] by my spirit saith the Lord that is our
[1:20:26] protection we are not protected by bomb
[1:20:28] shelters we are protected by the power
[1:20:31] of the Holy Ghost the token is the Holy
[1:20:34] Ghost case pose there is no other token
[1:20:38] it is the literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:20:40] that has sheltered the Church of the
[1:20:43] Living God I'll tell you what amen I
[1:20:45] don't believe we have to be scared of
[1:20:47] hydrogen bugs amen but I believe as long
[1:20:50] as you've got Christ in your heart the
[1:20:52] best bomb shelter I know of is made out
[1:20:55] of feathers under these Wings abide
[1:20:58] don't worry about these things if you
[1:21:00] are a Christian
[1:21:03] if you are a Christian don't you worry
[1:21:06] about these things see amenities you
[1:21:08] know what I'm you know what I'm saying
[1:21:10] if you're hunting with some people and
[1:21:11] they're all saying we got to go this way
[1:21:13] to the truck and others are saying we
[1:21:15] got to go this way to the truck we need
[1:21:17] to we need to build some bomb shelters
[1:21:19] we need to get ready for this and we
[1:21:20] need to do this and we need to do this
[1:21:22] but I thank God Amen that there is a
[1:21:25] message I thank God there's a direction
[1:21:27] for the Church of the Living God I
[1:21:29] appreciate men of God that have caught
[1:21:32] the direction of God in this age you
[1:21:34] know amen I remember years ago as a
[1:21:36] young preacher here in brother Tim
[1:21:38] preach and I remember him saying
[1:21:40] something along these lines he said you
[1:21:42] know up till 1964 in the Feast of the
[1:21:44] trumpets brother random did preach
[1:21:46] persecution but there was a corner that
[1:21:48] was turned in 1964. amen and the opening
[1:21:52] of the word became a corner that purges
[1:21:55] the church not tribulation not
[1:21:57] persecution and it's a landmark and
[1:21:59] there are other men that know these
[1:22:01] landmarks are there we're not standing
[1:22:03] here by ourselves saying this is the
[1:22:05] landmark and we already go there's other
[1:22:07] men of God and have caught these things
[1:22:09] and saved them all over the world
[1:22:10] because this is a universal Rapture this
[1:22:13] is not a Rapture just for your church
[1:22:15] it's not a Rapture just for your family
[1:22:17] but this isn't a universal change it's
[1:22:21] coming over the Church of the Living God
[1:22:22] I don't care what language you speak I
[1:22:25] don't care what color you're seeing I
[1:22:28] don't care what social class you belong
[1:22:30] to amen there's a right you're coming
[1:22:33] from the church and the power of God is
[1:22:36] going to change these bodies it's the
[1:22:38] greatest bomb shelter there is
[1:22:43] if you're a Christian don't worry about
[1:22:45] these things
[1:22:48] [Applause]
[1:22:50] the door knocks let me let me show you
[1:22:51] brother Brandon's Spirit concerning this
[1:22:53] amen I stand the door knock brother
[1:22:56] Byron said something it's very good he
[1:22:58] got how many knows he ever he preached a
[1:23:00] message called the handwriting on the
[1:23:01] wall
[1:23:02] now that's a message of judgment if you
[1:23:04] ever heard one
[1:23:05] he breaks it down like Daniel shows you
[1:23:07] we're at the judgment
[1:23:09] but in a message standing at the door or
[1:23:11] not I found the prophet's spirit in a
[1:23:13] quote
[1:23:14] he said you know it's revealed to
[1:23:16] revealed in God's word to see the hour
[1:23:18] we're living in and surely we at the end
[1:23:22] yeah he was going to preach a message
[1:23:24] called handwriting on the wall but he
[1:23:27] didn't have a second service to preach
[1:23:29] so he only had one service so he would
[1:23:32] not preach the handwriting on the wall
[1:23:34] that day he waited till another time he
[1:23:37] said because I don't want to leave the
[1:23:39] people in that condition that without
[1:23:41] bringing another message to follow it to
[1:23:44] give the hope to the church that leaves
[1:23:46] the people wondering and makes them
[1:23:48] nervous he would not speak a message of
[1:23:51] judgment without speaking a message of
[1:23:54] change the prophet of God said I spoke
[1:23:56] handwriting on the wall on Sunday
[1:23:57] morning but then on Sunday night I
[1:24:00] preached the church rapturing before the
[1:24:02] tribulation so in the morning he
[1:24:04] preached judgments and in the evening
[1:24:06] time he preached a message of change and
[1:24:09] Resurrection in Rapture I don't know
[1:24:11] about you but he didn't preach the
[1:24:13] message of judgment for me he judged
[1:24:16] this world but he preached a message of
[1:24:18] rapture and changed for the Church of
[1:24:20] the Living God and I accept the message
[1:24:23] of change
[1:24:26] yes Russia is going to destroy the
[1:24:28] Vatican yes you don't have to worry
[1:24:30] about it this America is going to be in
[1:24:32] craters yes it's going to happen but
[1:24:34] before it can take place
[1:24:37] there is going to be a bride setting in
[1:24:39] glory that's the say of the Lord
[1:24:44] before it can take place before it can
[1:24:46] take place there's a church going to set
[1:24:48] in glory a prophet used the scripture
[1:24:50] and he said he told them as it was in
[1:24:53] the days of Noah and as it was in the
[1:24:55] days of Lodge he said the day lot left
[1:24:58] Sodom fire fell here that after Noah
[1:25:01] entered the Ark rain began to fall he
[1:25:04] said I can't do nothing until you come
[1:25:07] hither and God cannot do nothing in the
[1:25:10] way of judgment until the bride is out
[1:25:12] of the way do you see the anointing on
[1:25:15] us and you'll see the headship he said
[1:25:17] get out of the way Pride now how do I
[1:25:20] get out of the way I've got to get into
[1:25:22] the word and let the word begin to
[1:25:24] transform and let the spirit of God
[1:25:26] begin to move on me the planet word of
[1:25:28] the age that will begin to change me I
[1:25:31] believe we are to comfort one another
[1:25:32] with these words
[1:25:35] he says what Paul said we should comfort
[1:25:37] one another these words you know there's
[1:25:39] times in your life that only Comforts
[1:25:42] you're going to get is the word
[1:25:44] there's no comfort in the news
[1:25:46] there's no comfort in the world
[1:25:48] but in the word of God there's a comfort
[1:25:50] laying there if you believe it
[1:25:54] now God does nothing without purpose
[1:25:57] I'm
[1:25:59] absolutely positive God does nothing
[1:26:01] without purpose
[1:26:02] so if there is a tribulation there is a
[1:26:05] purpose for tribulation and if you
[1:26:08] discover the purpose then you know
[1:26:10] what's going on at that time the purpose
[1:26:12] of God was was divided in a three-part
[1:26:14] purpose by a prophet of the age now can
[1:26:17] I say this very clearly one of those
[1:26:19] purposes was not to destroy his bride
[1:26:24] now you say well brother Wayne when this
[1:26:27] takes when this Rapture takes place he
[1:26:29] said with all the Believers families
[1:26:31] wife and children go he said they are in
[1:26:33] faith and trusting in Jesus will they go
[1:26:35] yes
[1:26:37] yes will my family go on the Rapture yes
[1:26:41] now I when I was preaching a couple
[1:26:43] years ago I was looking at this quote
[1:26:45] and there was actually a sister on the
[1:26:47] line listening to when I was preaching
[1:26:49] she wasn't even in the church and told
[1:26:51] me after the service she said I've been
[1:26:53] worried day and night about my new
[1:26:55] babies wondering what was going to
[1:26:57] happen if judgment would fall if I would
[1:26:59] go on the Rapture would I leave my
[1:27:00] children at home he spent the prophet of
[1:27:03] God's asked the question I'm sure mother
[1:27:05] asked it amen will they go with us he
[1:27:07] said yes yes that's two and will they go
[1:27:10] in the family in the yes he says yes yes
[1:27:13] yes yes yes they will go you say
[1:27:15] preacher why in the world would you
[1:27:17] bring that up because you don't have to
[1:27:18] be old to go in the rapture you don't
[1:27:21] have to be dead to go in the Rapture
[1:27:22] listen the same God that can take an old
[1:27:25] person and make him young again can take
[1:27:27] a young person and make them 20 years
[1:27:29] old it doesn't matter which way God
[1:27:32] changes the body he can change the body
[1:27:34] he can listen I'm I'm I'm nowhere I'm
[1:27:37] standing he met his sharing roles beyond
[1:27:40] the curtain of time she was a
[1:27:42] six-month-old baby and she was 18 years
[1:27:45] old in the vision so God took me young
[1:27:48] and made them 20 year old and he took me
[1:27:51] all and he made him 20 year old because
[1:27:53] that's the age of the theophany he's a
[1:27:56] 20 year old brother man said a perfect
[1:27:58] place a perfect shape and God does
[1:28:01] nothing without purpose
[1:28:03] six sealed brother man said threefold to
[1:28:06] the purpose was number one he said of
[1:28:08] course it's to purge the foolish virgin
[1:28:10] he said of course it's the purge the
[1:28:12] hundred and forty four thousand and then
[1:28:14] it's to purge the Earth but the most
[1:28:16] beautiful part of that is what's not in
[1:28:19] his purpose not one place in that
[1:28:22] scripture will you find in the Sixth
[1:28:24] Seal that the bride is in there you can
[1:28:26] break it up any way you want you can dig
[1:28:28] it from corner to corner I have went
[1:28:30] over the Sixth Seal with every which
[1:28:32] direction you can go over it the bride
[1:28:34] is not in the tribulation you can't find
[1:28:38] her in there you can't put her in there
[1:28:40] you can't imagine her in there because
[1:28:42] God said she wouldn't be in there
[1:28:46] oh
[1:28:49] so preacher what are you saying there's
[1:28:50] no reason for her to be in there God
[1:28:52] would have to have a reason to put her
[1:28:54] there but he has no reason because the
[1:28:57] tribulation is to purge them who have
[1:28:59] not been formally purged but the prophet
[1:29:01] of God said it ought to be truly settled
[1:29:03] in every believer's heart the church the
[1:29:05] tribulation period you cannot put
[1:29:07] nowhere the church and tribulation the
[1:29:10] church sure but not the bride the bride
[1:29:12] is gone she has not won sin against her
[1:29:15] at all the grace of God is covered her
[1:29:17] the bleach of every has took every sin
[1:29:20] so far away there's not even a
[1:29:22] remembrance of the sin it's a thing of
[1:29:25] Purity perfect in the presence of God he
[1:29:27] said preacher how can you teach and a
[1:29:29] church don't go through tribulation
[1:29:31] because there's no reason for her to go
[1:29:33] in the tribulation there is not one sin
[1:29:37] against her at all
[1:29:41] oh Church the prophet of God said it's
[1:29:44] been took so far away from you the
[1:29:46] church has already been judged another
[1:29:47] quote and have accepted the blood and
[1:29:50] how can God judge a man that's perfectly
[1:29:52] totally sinless
[1:29:54] I don't know what you think about
[1:29:56] yourself but this is a word Prophet he's
[1:29:58] not in the first pool here he's not in
[1:30:01] the second poll here he's in the third
[1:30:03] pool here he's not Discerning the heart
[1:30:05] of man he's not prophesied over you he's
[1:30:09] Discerning the heart of God he's looking
[1:30:11] in God's heart and he said he has not
[1:30:14] one thing against you at all
[1:30:19] said preacher what does that mean that
[1:30:20] means that somebody's sitting here right
[1:30:22] now is already absolutely sinless before
[1:30:25] the almighty God and either that's the
[1:30:27] truth or it ain't but if it is the truth
[1:30:30] then why are we living like we're
[1:30:32] underprivileged children and we're
[1:30:34] borrowing time and somehow something's
[1:30:36] going to catch up listen God don't have
[1:30:38] anything against you God ain't sitting
[1:30:41] there waiting just to smash you like a
[1:30:43] bug amen he is a god of Mercy he is a
[1:30:46] god of Grace and he is forwarding this
[1:30:49] bride from the foundations of the world
[1:30:51] that she might be holy and Without Blame
[1:30:54] before him in love he doesn't have one
[1:30:56] thing against her at all
[1:31:00] oh brother you say there ain't such a
[1:31:04] person
[1:31:05] brother man said it you say there ain't
[1:31:07] such a person he said every born-again
[1:31:10] believer
[1:31:12] every True Believer is perfectly
[1:31:15] absolutely sinless before God
[1:31:17] [Applause]
[1:31:21] will how many born-again Believers we
[1:31:23] got here
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:30] absolutely
[1:31:32] perfectly sinless before God
[1:31:36] how can you make a man a sinner
[1:31:38] when the bleach of the blood of Jesus is
[1:31:40] between him and God
[1:31:42] that would scatter sin until there be
[1:31:44] nothing left of it
[1:31:45] you said brother Wayne but I know about
[1:31:47] something happened back there in this
[1:31:48] ain't nothing left of it
[1:31:52] it's a preacher it's in my memory that's
[1:31:53] all right but it ain't God's
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:57] it matters who remembers it and God said
[1:32:00] he don't remember you might not be able
[1:32:02] to forgive but he has access to the Sea
[1:32:05] of his forgetfulness where he has took
[1:32:07] in our sins and thrown them into the sea
[1:32:10] somebody said well you ought not preach
[1:32:11] about the blood why not it's the
[1:32:13] promises of God is it not is that all
[1:32:16] we're supposed to do is beat you over
[1:32:18] the head with some kind of judgment is
[1:32:20] that all we're supposed to do is line
[1:32:21] everybody up and preach legalism every
[1:32:23] week well that might work for a foolish
[1:32:25] version but not for this bloodball bride
[1:32:28] listen you got the wrong class of people
[1:32:30] this bride has been in the blood of
[1:32:32] Jesus Christ and God is obliterated ever
[1:32:35] see him that's against that bride and
[1:32:38] because she stands there spotless before
[1:32:40] him
[1:32:42] it gives her our confidence before her
[1:32:44] God
[1:32:46] you can't make him a sinner
[1:32:48] now in the time of trouble he would hide
[1:32:50] me see you got to know who you are in
[1:32:52] the Bible
[1:32:53] I believe you need to identify who you
[1:32:55] are in scripture amen if you can see who
[1:32:57] yourself then you know what's coming
[1:32:59] amen if you can only remember and
[1:33:01] realize that there are types in
[1:33:03] scripture that's called bride types and
[1:33:05] one of the bright types was Rebecca amen
[1:33:08] everybody said well brother random
[1:33:09] wasn't nearly easy well if he wasn't you
[1:33:11] ain't Rebecca
[1:33:12] but if he was you are Rebecca and if
[1:33:15] you're Rebecca you were found in the
[1:33:17] evening light
[1:33:19] you wasn't found in the Morning Light it
[1:33:21] wasn't found in the Noonday but in the
[1:33:23] evening time elieza found Rebecca coming
[1:33:26] to the well at the time of the virgins
[1:33:28] he didn't know who he was there to
[1:33:30] choose but God had forordained it and
[1:33:33] the reason she received the message of
[1:33:35] Elisha is because the angel that sent
[1:33:38] him went with him and with 30 minutes in
[1:33:41] front of him and prepared the heart of
[1:33:43] her to receive that message before it
[1:33:46] was ever spoke to her you don't think
[1:33:48] God didn't prepare you before the
[1:33:50] foundations of the world before God ever
[1:33:52] even wrote the Bible he already knew who
[1:33:55] you were where you'd be found and what
[1:33:58] time
[1:34:00] listen I know what I'm talking about
[1:34:02] here there are people in this Bible that
[1:34:04] don't come to light to a certain moment
[1:34:05] in Scripture
[1:34:07] come on how long was Ray have the
[1:34:09] hearted out there in Jericho she was
[1:34:11] there the whole time that Moses was out
[1:34:13] there in the wilderness but she never
[1:34:15] came in light but the minute Joshua
[1:34:18] began to crush the Jordan there was a
[1:34:20] light that shined and there as she was
[1:34:23] in the promises under Joshua
[1:34:27] there's things written in this Bible you
[1:34:29] won't find till you come under evening
[1:34:31] light
[1:34:34] and in the evening light it began to
[1:34:36] reveal that was a Rebecca
[1:34:39] and Rebecca was a special woman she
[1:34:41] didn't really care about the gifts as
[1:34:43] much as she cared about making it to
[1:34:45] Isaac
[1:34:46] remember what they did with her they
[1:34:48] come amen and she was impressed with
[1:34:50] everything but really what she wanted
[1:34:52] was to go to Isaac that's really what
[1:34:55] she wanted was to to get on that Camel
[1:34:57] and go to the one that was the Lord and
[1:34:59] the owner of all the gifts
[1:35:02] come on church amen she wasn't just she
[1:35:05] wasn't just satisfied with a little gift
[1:35:07] she wanted to own the guy that give the
[1:35:09] gift
[1:35:09] [Applause]
[1:35:11] now I know there's a bunch of dirty
[1:35:13] Devils that'll take that try to make
[1:35:14] something else out of it but the point
[1:35:16] is he didn't only have a few he had them
[1:35:19] all
[1:35:20] come on church amen
[1:35:23] well we'll fight that another day but
[1:35:25] I'll say this to you amen Rebecca got up
[1:35:27] there on that Camel because she was
[1:35:29] given the opportunity to go to Isaac but
[1:35:32] she needed a ride brother
[1:35:35] come on she needed a ride how are you
[1:35:37] ever going to get there without help how
[1:35:39] are you going to get there without a
[1:35:40] ride and whatever brought Ellie easier
[1:35:43] was what was going to take her home
[1:35:46] whatever brought he must hurry right out
[1:35:48] of there and I say this I believe God
[1:35:51] sent this message I believe the Holy
[1:35:53] Ghost sent this word and if God brought
[1:35:56] the prophet on the Holy Ghost he'll take
[1:35:58] the bride out on the same Trail
[1:36:03] come on I'm riding on it I'm not riding
[1:36:05] on Theology and may have made ideas but
[1:36:08] the person of Christ has come among the
[1:36:11] church come on I think it's time to get
[1:36:13] on your horse and ride this message is
[1:36:16] supposed to make a second ride when I'm
[1:36:18] looking at it right here this morning
[1:36:20] it's happening
[1:36:22] the vision is in front of us
[1:36:27] well by the way and I can't take all
[1:36:28] this horror and you people do around
[1:36:30] here find out your type we don't go
[1:36:32] through tribulation but brother we do
[1:36:34] praise God
[1:36:37] come on we're not going to walk to our
[1:36:39] Isaac We're not gonna have to borrow a
[1:36:40] ride but we're going to praise God
[1:36:42] because Rebecca watered the cannibals of
[1:36:45] Isaac so the Church of the Living God
[1:36:48] will water the movie of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:54] say well why she's shouting so much her
[1:36:56] name is Rebecca she can't help it it's
[1:36:58] her time she can't outlive her time but
[1:37:01] thank God that if God had a type there
[1:37:04] is a greater time when the Fulfillment
[1:37:06] of it comes
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:10] so by the way and I'll tell you what man
[1:37:12] I don't know about all this well you get
[1:37:14] to watering it you'll find out
[1:37:18] brother man said that Camel represented
[1:37:21] a power
[1:37:22] and it's the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:24] that takes you to meet your Isaac and
[1:37:26] it's not some figment of my imagination
[1:37:28] there is a real Isaac
[1:37:30] come on everybody's trying to get us off
[1:37:32] of the camel we're trying to say well
[1:37:33] we've already met her Isaac I know the
[1:37:35] word has come I'm good with that I have
[1:37:37] no problem I have met the word I have
[1:37:39] met the revealed word but there is a
[1:37:41] Corporal body of Jesus Christ that is in
[1:37:44] another dimension and I am going to take
[1:37:47] the ride that God sent into the chairs
[1:37:49] to change Dimensions your bus won't get
[1:37:52] me there your airplane won't get me
[1:37:54] there your space shuttle won't get me
[1:37:57] there but the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:59] will break from one dimension to another
[1:38:02] dimension
[1:38:06] you got to know your types come on in
[1:38:09] the scripture you're a Rebecca in the
[1:38:11] scripture
[1:38:12] in the scripture you're the woman that
[1:38:15] Joseph met
[1:38:18] while he was in Egypt
[1:38:21] amen wasn't even of the Israel blood at
[1:38:24] all
[1:38:25] but while they thought he was dead
[1:38:28] while they thought that he was dead and
[1:38:31] had been done gone away but before
[1:38:33] Joseph ever before Joseph ever got
[1:38:37] captive before he was ever beaten before
[1:38:39] the blood was put on the Garment and
[1:38:41] taken to his father before any of that
[1:38:43] ever happened there was a vision
[1:38:46] that was a dream there was something
[1:38:48] that was out in front of him now watch
[1:38:50] the beauty of this because whenever they
[1:38:52] took those garments and told his father
[1:38:54] he was dead Israel believed he was dead
[1:38:59] he wasn't dead at all he was the Lord of
[1:39:03] another country
[1:39:06] he was the Lord of another people
[1:39:09] and out of that people he took his bride
[1:39:13] but brother now you say well he forgot
[1:39:16] Israel no he didn't they asked him one
[1:39:18] time said can you forget Israel he said
[1:39:20] prophet he said take a measure and stick
[1:39:22] and measure the sea amen count the Stars
[1:39:25] he said I cannot he said and neither
[1:39:27] could I ever forget Israel a mother my
[1:39:30] forget her suckling babe but I can never
[1:39:32] forget Israel and God's got Israel on
[1:39:35] his mind he's going to have Israel again
[1:39:37] but the scripture teaches us when he
[1:39:40] begin to reveal himself to his brother
[1:39:43] and he could not do that until his wife
[1:39:46] was in the palace I'll tell you what God
[1:39:49] cannot reveal himself to those Jews
[1:39:51] until this bride is sitting in the
[1:39:54] palace and to get to the Palace you need
[1:39:57] a ride
[1:39:59] you tell me how you're going to get
[1:40:00] there without the holy ghost ride but
[1:40:03] God sent a ride to take us from one
[1:40:06] dimension
[1:40:08] so brother Wayne can I get a ticket sure
[1:40:10] the token is available today
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:15] what I got to pay pay for
[1:40:22] now if the trumpet would give an
[1:40:24] uncertain sound
[1:40:26] who could prepare
[1:40:29] who can make preparations well I need to
[1:40:31] prepare I'll tell you what I'm preparing
[1:40:33] for paradox
[1:40:37] I'm preparing for Paradox that's
[1:40:39] actually what I'm doing in my little my
[1:40:41] little office sitting listening to those
[1:40:43] tapes what are you doing in there I'm
[1:40:45] preparing for something
[1:40:47] I'm not just preparing to speak to you
[1:40:49] I'm preparing to change these items
[1:40:55] now the change of this body according to
[1:40:58] Philippians 3 and 20 Paul said our
[1:41:00] conversation is in heaven which also we
[1:41:02] look for a savior the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:05] who shall change our vowel body Let It
[1:41:07] Be fashioned like an unto his golden
[1:41:08] glorious body according to the work of
[1:41:10] whereby he is able to subdue all things
[1:41:13] now of course this this word vile
[1:41:15] actually speaks of humiliation that's
[1:41:18] that's what the word means a vile body
[1:41:20] is a humiliated body it's a it's a it's
[1:41:23] a body of humiliation brother random in
[1:41:25] the junction of time said thankful Lord
[1:41:27] that someday we're going to be changed
[1:41:29] that this Old Vile body of humiliation
[1:41:32] that we live in will be changed and
[1:41:34] fashioned and made like an unto your
[1:41:36] body
[1:41:37] can you can you imagine God is promising
[1:41:40] the church
[1:41:41] that you're going to move from that body
[1:41:43] you're in to a body like God himself is
[1:41:47] dwelling in heaven
[1:41:49] except this will only be the body who
[1:41:53] has no scars
[1:41:56] this Tabernacle of humiliation amen we
[1:41:59] are veiled in these Tabernacles this is
[1:42:01] the earnest of our perfect and complete
[1:42:03] Redemption back there like it was in the
[1:42:05] Garden of Eden we have a foretaste of
[1:42:07] Glory Divine by the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:09] Ghost the refreshment coming from the
[1:42:11] presence of God to the water of the
[1:42:12] church to make it grow in Grace and when
[1:42:14] we have sick and have Redemption the
[1:42:16] blessing the attributes of Christ Divine
[1:42:19] Healing as a four sign to someday this
[1:42:22] Mortal will take on immortality
[1:42:26] someday this Mortal will take on
[1:42:30] immortality
[1:42:32] the prophet of God said like this
[1:42:34] someday we're going out of this tent
[1:42:36] someday from this Dwelling Place the
[1:42:38] Tabernacle of our humiliation we're
[1:42:40] going to be changed we're going to step
[1:42:42] over in another Land where's Purity when
[1:42:44] our feet first touches that blessed land
[1:42:46] when The Old Ship of Zion blows for
[1:42:49] landing we'll rush out and it's going to
[1:42:51] be over then sickness and cripples and
[1:42:54] afflictions and everything will be gone
[1:42:56] old age death sorrow natural things that
[1:42:59] was caused by this curse will be gone
[1:43:01] forever we'll be changed
[1:43:04] will be changed now look this is what he
[1:43:06] did for Abraham and this is what he's
[1:43:09] going to do for you I'm thankful to know
[1:43:11] that there is a change coming no matter
[1:43:14] what is happening in the world there is
[1:43:16] a change coming see we could look at our
[1:43:18] we could look at our Humanity today and
[1:43:21] we could say by this Humanity how could
[1:43:24] you think that there's going to be a
[1:43:25] change because of everything we are
[1:43:28] everything we look at everything about
[1:43:30] us is humiliation but do you know that
[1:43:34] the only man who was ever born right was
[1:43:37] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:39] and our Lord Jesus Christ actually put
[1:43:42] aside his garments in heaven and came
[1:43:45] into the Earth and took on mortal flesh
[1:43:48] and he himself put up a tent of
[1:43:52] humiliation and stepped into humiliation
[1:43:55] so he could come to the place where you
[1:43:57] are and show you that God can take you
[1:44:00] from humiliation to glorification as a
[1:44:04] Son of God look what he did our lord
[1:44:06] Jesus he came down into the degradation
[1:44:09] of humanity you wasn't actually born
[1:44:12] here Amen in the world you wasn't
[1:44:14] supposed to be like this things were not
[1:44:16] supposed to be this way at all you
[1:44:18] should have never sinned you should have
[1:44:20] never had the first struggle with trials
[1:44:22] you should have never had the first
[1:44:24] problems in your life amen if things
[1:44:26] would have been as they were in the
[1:44:28] original Adam would have brought you in
[1:44:30] the Garden of Eden and there would have
[1:44:31] been no struggles there would have been
[1:44:32] no trials there would have been no
[1:44:34] problems
[1:44:35] come on now but God rich and mercy
[1:44:38] wanted you to know he was a Healer he
[1:44:40] wanted you to know he was a savior he
[1:44:42] wanted you to know so God allowed the
[1:44:45] fall to take place but listen before
[1:44:47] there was a fall there was a redeemer
[1:44:49] before there was sin that was a that was
[1:44:52] a savior
[1:44:53] before there was sickness that was a
[1:44:56] Healer amen before it could come into
[1:44:59] this place it was already something that
[1:45:01] could get you back to where you come
[1:45:03] from now our lord Jesus came down as our
[1:45:06] representative as a human almighty God
[1:45:09] came down and took upon him the
[1:45:11] degradation now I think it's amazing
[1:45:13] when you read the scriptures and you
[1:45:15] find out that our lord Jesus himself
[1:45:17] became humiliated while he was in the
[1:45:20] Earth
[1:45:22] our lord Jesus was humiliated now I know
[1:45:25] some of you are being humiliated by your
[1:45:26] trials by your diseases by your
[1:45:29] struggles by your problems by your human
[1:45:31] body it is humiliating for a millionaire
[1:45:34] to live in a shack
[1:45:38] it's humiliating that you have been
[1:45:40] removed from that great position of
[1:45:43] heaven and have been stuck in this
[1:45:45] Tabernacle of humiliation brother man
[1:45:48] calls a pest house
[1:45:50] where all the disease are living you're
[1:45:52] humiliates back be like a millionaire
[1:45:54] living down in one of the boarding
[1:45:56] houses in Shreveport in the slums down
[1:45:58] there and he's trying to explain to
[1:46:00] everybody in there look I really don't
[1:46:02] belong here
[1:46:03] I'm really a millionaire and and they're
[1:46:06] all looking like yeah you're just
[1:46:07] another bum like we are amen it's a
[1:46:09] humiliating position to be in but he
[1:46:12] really does have a place and I know
[1:46:14] people look at us and they think well
[1:46:16] y'all's just a nuts and nobody's but you
[1:46:18] don't understand that before I was here
[1:46:20] I was in the mind of God as the Son of
[1:46:23] God and when all of this is over
[1:46:27] I've got a mansion on the hilltop
[1:46:32] no wonder the world's fighting so hard
[1:46:34] that's all they've ever got but you and
[1:46:35] I amen we've got a place to go amen our
[1:46:38] Lord came down humbled himself and came
[1:46:41] into this Earth humiliated himself and
[1:46:44] he was amen that we could be brought
[1:46:46] nigh to God you know the Bible said that
[1:46:49] he was humiliated in judgment
[1:46:51] listen friends I I don't know if you
[1:46:54] ever read these areas in the Bible but
[1:46:56] if you read up there about the
[1:46:57] crucifixion of our Lord Jesus it's the
[1:46:59] most humiliating scene in the entire
[1:47:01] Bible that the king of all the kings the
[1:47:05] greatest Majesty of all majesties never
[1:47:07] was a man like him never was a man who
[1:47:09] ever be like him he was our Lord Jesus
[1:47:12] Christ and rather than honoring him and
[1:47:14] rather than crowning him with a king and
[1:47:16] putting him upon the throne they gave
[1:47:18] him a crown of thorns and they put him
[1:47:20] upon a cross and crucified him now why
[1:47:23] did they do that for you and me
[1:47:27] now I don't know sometimes if you want
[1:47:29] to stop and think about it a minute but
[1:47:30] whatever's whatever struggles you're
[1:47:32] going through whatever humility you're
[1:47:34] in I want you to know he took our shame
[1:47:38] when they beat him and they beat him at
[1:47:41] that post and they put him under
[1:47:42] judgment do you know he had a walk of
[1:47:45] shame like you would never walk in your
[1:47:46] life
[1:47:47] he walked from that beaten post to
[1:47:50] Calvary and let me tell you something he
[1:47:52] didn't stop halfway
[1:47:54] he didn't get under the load of the
[1:47:56] struggle and the problems and all the
[1:47:58] issues that was going on and say well
[1:48:00] never mind you say well he was just the
[1:48:02] anointed Son of God but you know the
[1:48:03] prophet of God said that he separated
[1:48:05] from the spirit of God In The Garden of
[1:48:07] Gethsemane and he went to the Cross as a
[1:48:10] man I don't know if you've ever thought
[1:48:12] about it but he was a mighty conqueror
[1:48:15] brother he was more than just a
[1:48:16] conqueror he was a mighty conqueror he
[1:48:19] didn't only conquer sin and disease he
[1:48:22] conquered the flesh
[1:48:25] and he obeyed God even when it meant the
[1:48:28] crucifixion of every desire the
[1:48:31] crucifixion of every hope and every
[1:48:33] every desire and every hope you know
[1:48:35] this Bible says he was tempted in every
[1:48:37] light man a man you are he wasn't a fake
[1:48:40] man he wasn't a half man he was an angel
[1:48:43] man the Bible said he came lower than
[1:48:45] the angels and took upon him the Seed of
[1:48:48] Abraham that he might be tempted in
[1:48:51] every light manner
[1:48:54] come on you're sitting there saying well
[1:48:56] I tell you what I don't know if he could
[1:48:58] survive the age we're in listen he took
[1:49:00] every bit of the Temptation you took and
[1:49:02] he supremely ruled over it
[1:49:05] come on Amen zachday at Calvary he took
[1:49:08] every devil every sin every demon and he
[1:49:12] carried them with him in the flesh unto
[1:49:15] Calvary a place he could destroy them I
[1:49:18] tell you what if you want to destroy
[1:49:19] spirits take them to Calvary
[1:49:21] [Applause]
[1:49:24] now the prophet has not taught us a
[1:49:26] lesson didn't he he said if you want to
[1:49:28] if you want to make a difference in your
[1:49:29] life and you want a new beginning a new
[1:49:31] start he said drive a steak
[1:49:34] drive a steak amen you didn't see
[1:49:36] brother Brandon was taking God's
[1:49:37] principle when God got ready to do away
[1:49:40] with all your sin when he got ready to
[1:49:43] change the entire plan when you got
[1:49:45] ready to reverse the problems God drove
[1:49:48] a stake and put the bloody son Jesus
[1:49:52] Christ on the state and said from this
[1:49:54] day forward sin is defeated
[1:49:57] sickness is defeated from this they fall
[1:50:02] Church of the Living God Jesus Christ is
[1:50:06] our Passover Lamb
[1:50:08] we're not looking for another sacrifice
[1:50:10] we are not looking for another Blood
[1:50:12] there is one man between God and man and
[1:50:16] that is the man Christ Jesus
[1:50:18] it's a preacher what are you saying I'm
[1:50:20] saying it's the way to start over God
[1:50:22] gives you ways to start over I'm going
[1:50:24] to preach to you a minute I feel it in
[1:50:25] the room God gives you a way to start
[1:50:27] over why don't you just start over today
[1:50:30] I read in the Bible I read back there
[1:50:33] when Joshua got ready to go in the
[1:50:35] promises just like you are ready to go
[1:50:37] into the promises but between him and
[1:50:39] the promises was a Jordan
[1:50:42] is that right but it wasn't a Jordan at
[1:50:44] any time it was a Jordan that had full
[1:50:46] banks
[1:50:48] you said why did it have full banks
[1:50:49] because the latter rains had come and
[1:50:52] the latter rains had blocked him off
[1:50:54] from that land but you know what God
[1:50:56] told him Joshua it's time for you to
[1:50:59] quit delaying these things Rise Up from
[1:51:01] where you are and cross this Jordan
[1:51:04] you know what he did he told he told the
[1:51:07] ferris excuse me told the doctors he
[1:51:10] told the men of God he said put put the
[1:51:13] word upon your shoulders and take off
[1:51:15] towards that Creek
[1:51:17] you take off toward that River and when
[1:51:20] you step into it it'll open up now they
[1:51:23] didn't know what was going to happen
[1:51:24] when they got there but they were
[1:51:26] definitely knew they were packing the
[1:51:28] word that would change everything they
[1:51:30] knew they had a word that could cause
[1:51:32] anything to happen brother you know what
[1:51:34] they did when they put their foot in
[1:51:36] there the Waters of the Jordan dried up
[1:51:39] in front of them and they walked across
[1:51:42] dry Trot into the promises of God and
[1:51:45] listen I tell you this if you're ready
[1:51:47] to walk into the promises of God God
[1:51:49] will drive for Jordan he'll pull back
[1:51:52] the Red Sea God Will Make A Way when
[1:51:55] there is no way because he remains
[1:52:00] you set the Red Sea yes sir the Red Sea
[1:52:03] you know what the prophet said he said
[1:52:05] God had Moses at the Red Sea to give you
[1:52:08] an example that when there is no way God
[1:52:12] Will Make A Way and let me tell you
[1:52:14] God's Made A Way by sending the message
[1:52:17] of the hour
[1:52:22] you know what happened when they when
[1:52:23] they crossed that sea you know what they
[1:52:25] told them when they crossed that Jordan
[1:52:26] River amen God told Joshua we said go
[1:52:29] get some stones and stack them up over
[1:52:31] here
[1:52:32] you know what he did he stacked up
[1:52:33] Stones right where those priests stood
[1:52:36] that day stacked them up right there
[1:52:38] because whenever the waters began to get
[1:52:40] lower whenever the waters would be moved
[1:52:43] they would be revealed again look at
[1:52:45] this he also made a stack upon the bank
[1:52:47] at gilgal there were two stacks of
[1:52:49] stones according to scripture amen do
[1:52:51] you know that according to to history
[1:52:54] amen that that is the same place that
[1:52:57] John the Baptist baptized Jesus Christ
[1:53:00] and when they said well you belong to
[1:53:02] this and you belong to this you know
[1:53:04] what it was he said to them God is able
[1:53:06] these stones to rise children under
[1:53:08] Abraham because if God gave a promise
[1:53:11] he's somebody it's going to fulfill the
[1:53:14] promises of God I don't care how long
[1:53:16] it's been I don't care how much troubles
[1:53:19] has happened God will fulfill his word
[1:53:26] it's also prophesied that's the same
[1:53:28] place that Elijah parted the waters and
[1:53:31] walked across dry trod and when Elisha
[1:53:34] got on the other side amen he didn't
[1:53:36] amen that that great that great range
[1:53:39] that great cloak began to come out of
[1:53:41] the Rapture cycle and fell on the ground
[1:53:43] Elisha didn't run around and say oh amen
[1:53:47] Prophet said this and and the prophet
[1:53:49] said now hey that's the Garment let the
[1:53:51] prophet hey that's what the prophet wore
[1:53:53] that's that's what the prophet had he
[1:53:56] didn't do that brother you know what he
[1:53:57] did he reached out and picked it up
[1:54:01] he took off the old clothes
[1:54:05] and he put on the new
[1:54:07] Elijah's message is a message of change
[1:54:10] it's time to change your garments
[1:54:14] take off this old coat and put on a new
[1:54:17] coat
[1:54:18] he took that coat and he struck the
[1:54:21] Waters of the Jordan and he said where
[1:54:23] is the god of Elijah
[1:54:25] and Elisha picked up where Elijah left
[1:54:28] off
[1:54:31] no he wasn't a part of the first pool no
[1:54:33] he wasn't a part of the second pool but
[1:54:35] he was a part of the third by
[1:54:37] predestination
[1:54:38] [Applause]
[1:54:40] so preacher what do you say and I'm
[1:54:42] saying if you say something about the
[1:54:43] third pool these days there's a bunch of
[1:54:44] heretic preachers they'll say well if
[1:54:46] you've got a third pool where's your
[1:54:47] first pull if you've got a third pole
[1:54:49] where's your second pull well the first
[1:54:51] two pulls were ministered by an Angel in
[1:54:53] 1947.
[1:54:55] hello church and the minister and Angel
[1:54:57] is assigned the hand the gift of
[1:54:59] discernment which was a Messianic sign
[1:55:01] that was given one time to an age amen
[1:55:03] but that third poll was the opening of
[1:55:06] Seven Seals which hid our mystery of
[1:55:09] redemption before the
[1:55:12] I'm a part of that third pool by
[1:55:14] predestination the word is what's
[1:55:17] changing this Pride
[1:55:21] notify somebody there's a lot of people
[1:55:24] that's got their names on that book but
[1:55:27] you're the first people to know your
[1:55:29] name is on that book
[1:55:33] and I'll tell you something I like
[1:55:34] better than that we as a bunch of
[1:55:36] preachers get the privilege to know we
[1:55:39] are preaching to people that's going to
[1:55:41] be that
[1:55:43] there ain't nothing in the world better
[1:55:45] than to know you're going to be
[1:55:47] successful and what you're doing and I
[1:55:49] am not preaching a message of rights are
[1:55:51] in vain but there will be some that are
[1:55:54] setting here today that will be apart
[1:55:59] I feel change
[1:56:04] well brother Wayne it's just been too
[1:56:06] long now tell me God waited 40 years to
[1:56:09] put Joshua in the land but when he went
[1:56:11] over do you know what time of day it was
[1:56:12] do you know what time of year it was do
[1:56:14] you know the season it was it was the
[1:56:17] same exact season when they come out as
[1:56:20] the very day they come out of Egypt
[1:56:23] when God had the children of Israel come
[1:56:26] out of Egypt in the Passover of Exodus
[1:56:28] 12. amen God said let it be a beginning
[1:56:31] of months unto you
[1:56:33] they've been down there 400 years but
[1:56:35] when God speaks to a prophet things
[1:56:37] start over
[1:56:39] [Applause]
[1:56:40] things begin when God's word comes to a
[1:56:44] prophet and they started over look what
[1:56:46] happened amen it broke open on them
[1:56:50] A New Beginning happened
[1:56:53] amen you said preachers new beginnings
[1:56:56] of course that's what happened at the
[1:56:57] Jordan that's exactly the same season
[1:57:01] that Ruth came and Naomi into the Moab
[1:57:04] eyes it's the same season and that's the
[1:57:07] season we are living in
[1:57:10] said preacher how do we get there amen
[1:57:12] there is a lamb it's a Passover Lamb who
[1:57:15] took on our degradation
[1:57:18] took on our humiliation I don't know
[1:57:20] what pictures you're looking at but
[1:57:21] they're very nice to our Lord
[1:57:24] but in actuality he had no loincloth

[1:57:51] stripped naked on a cross
[1:57:55] beaten and riveted
[1:57:57] to shame him
[1:57:59] he said why would God allow it because
[1:58:01] you would never have to be ashamed again
[1:58:07] he took every bit of the shame upon your
[1:58:10] lives and upon the sin and upon the
[1:58:12] struggles that way when you get ready to
[1:58:15] go into Heavens amen you don't have to

[2:00:13] footworks flucky
[2:00:15] he washed the Stitch from the feet of
[2:00:18] men who was much lower than him but
[2:00:21] being God he could humble himself
[2:00:24] he could do what no man could do no man
[2:00:26] could humble himself that long but the
[2:00:29] king of all glory could take himself
[2:00:31] beneath the lowest sinners in town and
[2:00:34] washed their feet amen with a Grace and
[2:00:37] the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ to
[2:00:39] clean them up yeah

[2:00:44] you think about this God that could
[2:00:46] change he could so change lives he could
[2:00:49] so change them that when he got done
[2:00:51] with him the scripture says here he said
[2:00:54] who that can change I vile body
[2:00:58] look at this he said when you see all
[2:01:00] these problems come look up
[2:01:04] your Redemption when you see Russia
[2:01:06] threatening you'll see America bombing
[2:01:08] when you see these problems happening
[2:01:10] look up your Redemption draweth nigh
[2:01:16] why are we looking up look what the
[2:01:18] scripture said it said for our
[2:01:20] conversation is in heaven which also we
[2:01:22] look for our savior the Lord Jesus
[2:01:24] Christ who can change our vile bodies
[2:01:27] because we could look the word look
[2:01:29] actually speaks about amen it looks it's
[2:01:32] talking about people who have their
[2:01:34] conversation in heaven amen when you
[2:01:36] read the when you read the breakdown in
[2:01:37] the Greek on the word conversation there
[2:01:39] do you all know it actually speaks of a
[2:01:41] different kind of language that the
[2:01:44] people who are in Christ speak a
[2:01:46] different kind of language
[2:01:49] it's the truth you have a language of
[2:01:51] faith
[2:01:52] and it's sponsored by the word of God
[2:01:54] you were taught this in early stages of
[2:01:58] Christian Life and the longer you speak
[2:02:00] it the more developed you become and the
[2:02:02] more articulative you become and the
[2:02:04] more powerful your words become because
[2:02:06] it is the language of Faith which God
[2:02:09] has given a master's degree in this age
[2:02:11] a perfect faith we were not promised a
[2:02:14] perfect Faith decree in the Millennium
[2:02:16] but in the age of laodicea when every
[2:02:19] devil in every struggle and every
[2:02:21] darkness is upon the Earth God said I'll
[2:02:24] give you a language
[2:02:25] I'll give you a language that will
[2:02:27] change things it'll speak squirrels into
[2:02:30] existence it'll change the atmospheres
[2:02:32] it'll bring things back it'll wash the
[2:02:35] heart of a sinner it'll create an
[2:02:36] atmosphere in the church to change
[2:02:38] hearts and lives what is it it's a
[2:02:41] language that comes because we're
[2:02:43] citizens
[2:02:47] now I tell you what I I love how I love
[2:02:50] how they rendered this part right here
[2:02:51] somebody wrote it I don't even know who
[2:02:53] wrote it I thought it was powerful it
[2:02:55] said we Christians are citizens of a
[2:02:56] kingdom not of this world
[2:02:59] it actually means we're a colony of
[2:03:02] Heaven
[2:03:06] oh
[2:03:08] that we're really not a British colony
[2:03:12] we're a Heavenly colony
[2:03:14] now some of you folks here is from
[2:03:16] Africa this morning know you grew up
[2:03:17] speaking French and you're from and
[2:03:19] you're from a a totally country who was
[2:03:22] not French at all
[2:03:24] but the moment the French conquered your
[2:03:26] country
[2:03:28] the the African languages became the
[2:03:31] language of their conquerors
[2:03:33] that's why you can go to South Africa
[2:03:35] and you get to English and you go up to
[2:03:37] the Congo you get the French they still
[2:03:39] have a native language but another
[2:03:41] language has overcome and they speak it
[2:03:43] predominantly over and you go to one
[2:03:45] country it's one language one country
[2:03:47] another language it's the same continent
[2:03:49] different languages because of the
[2:03:51] conquers that live there and so is it in
[2:03:54] the Church of the Living God that's why
[2:03:56] you go to denominations and they speak a
[2:03:58] language and they speak Presbyterian and
[2:04:00] they speak Baptist and they speak
[2:04:01] Catholic but there is a bride who has a
[2:04:04] restored language of the original
[2:04:06] conquering power of my Lord Jesus Christ
[2:04:09] it's the word of faith Paul said which
[2:04:12] we preach and it is now the even inside
[2:04:15] now it's the most powerful language
[2:04:19] it will help you produce the name of
[2:04:21] Jesus Christ to say it with Clarity and
[2:04:24] power and when you speak that name
[2:04:27] of course that language has a
[2:04:29] citizenship a language the prophet of
[2:04:31] God said listen to me you should never
[2:04:33] say you're weak
[2:04:36] well my faith is not very much I'm not a
[2:04:38] very good Christian that's just what the
[2:04:40] devil wants you to say
[2:04:42] you're just talking here's language
[2:04:47] you must never say that
[2:04:51] you remember your mama used to tell you
[2:04:52] don't you say that word I'm gonna wash
[2:04:54] your mouth out
[2:04:55] [Applause]
[2:04:57] I blew Suds for years
[2:05:03] I go to say something suds
[2:05:08] hey man
[2:05:09] I had a good Mama
[2:05:11] well if you ever get the Holy Ghost it's
[2:05:13] like having Mama on the inside
[2:05:17] you start to say something that ain't
[2:05:19] right and something will come on you and
[2:05:21] say don't say that boy
[2:05:23] you start to say well I'm no good some
[2:05:25] said don't you say that don't you go out
[2:05:27] with that because I have adorned you I
[2:05:30] have washed you I have clothed you I
[2:05:32] said come and walk with me Thou Art
[2:05:35] Worthy what rights you've got to say
[2:05:37] you're not worthy he said your word
[2:05:41] if he says you're worthy

[2:05:51] I don't want to throw my wife under the
[2:05:53] bus

[2:05:56] I was walking through the house the
[2:05:57] other day and I said something real nice

[2:06:32] through Christ you can do all things you
[2:06:34] are more than a conqueror in Christ
[2:06:36] Jesus of course I can change this body
[2:06:39] of course I can put on the elements and
[2:06:42] change this body of course I can I can't
[2:06:46] do all
[2:06:53] you know I met a guy over there and with
[2:06:55] brother Matt and I were preaching uh
[2:06:57] remember that the other day we were over
[2:06:59] there and you know was that Wichita
[2:07:00] wasn't it with brother Parker that was a
[2:07:02] brother Webster there good name right
[2:07:03] Webster
[2:07:05] after the dictionary
[2:07:08] brother Webster was a quadriplegic
[2:07:12] amen and he was sitting in my services
[2:07:14] boy he was shouting us down I mean he
[2:07:16] wasn't growing that meeting got after
[2:07:18] the service and he got over where I was
[2:07:19] at he said preacher now that's my kind
[2:07:21] of preaching he said I believe in the
[2:07:22] god of Miracles and there he sits
[2:07:24] without arms or legs he said I believe
[2:07:27] in that kind of God I was preaching
[2:07:28] about one day God's going to add limbs
[2:07:30] back sitting in the middle of meeting he
[2:07:31] said that's my promise I'm believing
[2:07:33] that one
[2:07:36] he said let me tell you something
[2:07:37] preacher when I was a kid he said I got
[2:07:39] burned up in a fire and they didn't
[2:07:40] expect me to live
[2:07:42] he said they took me down the hospital
[2:07:43] he said and they didn't care for my
[2:07:45] wounds because I was a they was afraid
[2:07:48] that I would never recover he said so
[2:07:50] the infection set in they had to cut all
[2:07:52] my limbs off to keep it from killing me
[2:07:53] he said so my grandpapping them took me
[2:07:56] in because my parents didn't want me
[2:07:57] said when they took me home and they
[2:07:59] started raising me said I think he was
[2:08:01] about 10 years old he said I was out one
[2:08:03] day he said I was standing by a pond the
[2:08:04] guy was fly fishing out there he said I
[2:08:07] thought boy that was amazing prettiest
[2:08:09] thing I ever saw somebody fly fishing he
[2:08:11] said I got to tell that guy how I want
[2:08:13] to fly fish he said he told me he said
[2:08:15] you can't do this you'll never be able
[2:08:17] to fly fish he said well I went back
[2:08:19] home he said and I told my grandpa he
[2:08:21] said I was a grinder who wouldn't have
[2:08:23] it he said to me son what's wrong with
[2:08:25] you he said well he said I wanted to fly
[2:08:27] fish and I can't fly fish he said who
[2:08:29] said you can't fly fish he said well
[2:08:32] that guy down there he said son I want
[2:08:33] to show you something and they took him
[2:08:35] inside he said bro ain't he went in
[2:08:37] there and he said he found the old
[2:08:39] dictionary I thought it was good it was
[2:08:40] a Webster you know an old dictionary
[2:08:42] down there he said he pulled that
[2:08:43] dictionary up and opened to the page of
[2:08:46] the of the of the cans and where the
[2:08:48] cane should be he said but instead of
[2:08:50] the word can't he said there was just a
[2:08:52] big black blob he said it'd just been
[2:08:55] marked out right there he said do you
[2:08:57] see can't in this dictionary he said no
[2:08:59] it's not in this dictionary he said when
[2:09:02] my your grandma and me brought you home
[2:09:06] we knew you were going to be a special
[2:09:08] child so we took the dictionary out and
[2:09:12] we marked that out of the dictionary so
[2:09:14] that you would never think you can't do
[2:09:16] anything and I think it's time to take
[2:09:19] Kent out of the Church of the Living God
[2:09:21] yes we can we can change our body we can
[2:09:26] change the situations things can happen
[2:09:29] in our lives
[2:09:30] it's time to change our language you've
[2:09:33] underestimated these men of God you've
[2:09:35] underestimated this Pride yes they can
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:42] I expect fully for things to change I
[2:09:45] expect fully for life to come and change
[2:09:48] these mortal bodies because the Bible
[2:09:50] said look for it
[2:09:54] any true expectations built by the word
[2:09:57] any true expectations built by the word
[2:10:00] the prophet of God said if you can
[2:10:02] expect it to happen if it's built on
[2:10:04] something
[2:10:05] and any true expectation is built on the
[2:10:08] word all Christianity is based on faith
[2:10:11] and as much Faith as you can have as
[2:10:13] much power as you can have
[2:10:15] the only thing that limits your power is
[2:10:18] your faith and if you turn faith loose
[2:10:20] all things are possible to them that
[2:10:24] believe as you release your faith you
[2:10:26] release it you're releasing it upon the
[2:10:29] things of God do you know that Jesus
[2:10:32] taught that his word
[2:10:33] his word was a seed
[2:10:38] now these promises that are laying here
[2:10:41] in the message of expectation brother
[2:10:43] Branham begins to quote these promises
[2:10:45] and he begins to say the gospel didn't
[2:10:47] come to us in word only
[2:10:49] but in power and demonstration
[2:10:51] he says these signs shall follow them
[2:10:53] believe now just teaching the word's not
[2:10:54] going to do this you've got to have the
[2:10:56] power of the Holy Ghost behind that word
[2:10:58] to make it come to life again
[2:11:02] brother man said you say brother Branham
[2:11:05] those things were written 2 000 years
[2:11:08] ago
[2:11:10] he said listen I will never critic to
[2:11:12] know this he said the other day in Life
[2:11:14] Magazine Gardeners of Egypt got some of
[2:11:16] that wheat that was put there there in
[2:11:18] Joseph's time
[2:11:20] they took it and planted it in the
[2:11:22] ground and it growed
[2:11:25] that seed was 4
[2:11:28] 000 years old and it growed
[2:11:31] listen to me if a natural seed can grow
[2:11:34] after four thousand years what about the
[2:11:37] seed word promises that are made to this
[2:11:40] generation I know Paul promised this to
[2:11:43] the church two thousand years ago but
[2:11:45] brother there's a germ in that seed and
[2:11:48] when the Holy Ghost comes upon the seed
[2:11:50] it begins to manifest whatever is on the
[2:11:53] inside
[2:11:55] this gospel I'm going to skip a bunch
[2:11:57] here this Gospel of course is the gospel
[2:12:00] of power it's the gospel that'll
[2:12:02] quickened the church and will transform
[2:12:04] it the prophet of God said if you want
[2:12:06] something to come to pass take the word
[2:12:08] and plant it in your heart
[2:12:12] if you want to go on the Rapture if you
[2:12:15] want to be a genuine Christian place the
[2:12:16] word
[2:12:18] Ezekiel said take this scroll and eat it
[2:12:20] up
[2:12:23] then we find out that the opening of The
[2:12:26] Seven Seals are a part of your change
[2:12:31] is it amazing that the opening of the
[2:12:34] book is what John was asked to eat
[2:12:36] that he was going to be asked to devour
[2:12:39] seed that had been sealed up
[2:12:42] and have been waiting for the time of
[2:12:45] manifestation which would be the
[2:12:47] manifestation of the sons of God
[2:12:50] do you know the whole earth has been
[2:12:51] waiting for this
[2:12:54] can you imagine this that the Bible said
[2:12:56] the whole earth was waiting and groaning
[2:12:58] for the manifestation of sons
[2:13:00] when this word is restored to Sons
[2:13:04] according to the Bible the Moon and the
[2:13:08] Sun and the planets and the earth is
[2:13:10] waiting for that time
[2:13:13] do you know the sons getting a hold of
[2:13:15] the word will set everything back in
[2:13:18] order
[2:13:19] it will deliver nature
[2:13:21] it'll deliver that the lion will lay
[2:13:24] down with the lamb it'll Deliver Us from
[2:13:26] time to Eternity I'm talking about the
[2:13:29] word now
[2:13:30] it will it will do exactly what God
[2:13:33] promised now if that word will do that
[2:13:36] for nature and that word will do that
[2:13:39] amen for the planet what would the
[2:13:42] opening of the seals do for our lives
[2:13:46] now what it is is God brings to us amen
[2:13:50] a word now the right mental attitude
[2:13:52] toward that word
[2:13:54] will bring it to pass look what he said
[2:13:57] if you ought to take that scroll and eat
[2:13:58] it up that is the Original Seed now
[2:14:01] somebody said brother Wayne someday this
[2:14:03] is going to happen brother Brown said
[2:14:04] that prophet and the word would be one
[2:14:06] as the ark and the word of God and God
[2:14:09] has promised this word and how to be
[2:14:11] fulfilled and how it will come to pass
[2:14:13] he chose his bride how it would be done
[2:14:15] and it's happening right before you in
[2:14:20] the name of the Lord
[2:14:22] brother Wayne how's all this going to
[2:14:24] happen brother Bram says it's happening
[2:14:26] before you in the name of the Lord
[2:14:31] Elaine how am I going to do all these
[2:14:33] things it's happening
[2:14:35] right now
[2:14:38] turn and tell somebody it's happening
[2:14:42] now the seed cannot grow in an
[2:14:45] atmosphere of wisdom
[2:14:48] the Holy Ghost seeds of this Bible
[2:14:50] cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom
[2:14:52] not quoting Prophet directly
[2:14:55] but if you can get the atmosphere
[2:14:58] we already have the word
[2:15:01] it's not coming another prophet
[2:15:03] the message of William Branham is the
[2:15:06] message of our change
[2:15:08] the opening of The Seven Seals is the
[2:15:10] release of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:15:13] through every promise that's ever been
[2:15:14] given we already have the word
[2:15:19] God give us an atmosphere
[2:15:22] that'll make every word come to pass in
[2:15:24] its Moment In Time
[2:15:29] now he said preacher what are you
[2:15:31] talking about I'm talking about you can
[2:15:32] go through you can go for a long time
[2:15:34] and you got the word you got the word
[2:15:36] you got the word but all of a sudden
[2:15:38] atmosphere
[2:15:40] change instant almost in the twinkling
[2:15:43] of an eye
[2:15:45] thought it would never change
[2:15:47] changed
[2:15:49] you walk out of the building completely
[2:15:50] different than when you came in
[2:15:52] so by the way it can't happen it's
[2:15:54] Heather cross here sitting right back
[2:15:56] there I got this from David so I
[2:15:57] wouldn't mess it up amen Heather come to
[2:16:01] these meetings it's two years ago now
[2:16:03] right
[2:16:04] one year ago Heather came to these
[2:16:06] meetings when she came in here she had
[2:16:08] been suffering with 15 years of
[2:16:11] extremely painful arthritis
[2:16:14] all kinds of doctors in the country
[2:16:15] couldn't figure out what was going wrong
[2:16:17] but Joe Adams told her he felt led to
[2:16:21] have her come through the prayer line
[2:16:22] and upon Saturday night he motioned her
[2:16:25] up in the prayer line and when y'all
[2:16:27] started praying that was an intense and
[2:16:29] radiant heat in front and above me and
[2:16:32] Heather and I and as it was standing
[2:16:34] behind her the swelling that she had
[2:16:36] experienced for that long drive from
[2:16:38] Louisiana started going down over the
[2:16:40] next few days and she has been a hundred
[2:16:42] percent better completely healed in one
[2:16:45] moment it was a tremendous Miracle God
[2:16:49] was so gracious to give our family
[2:16:51] 15 years of meetings
[2:16:55] 15 years setting in meetings just like
[2:16:58] this and over and over and over and over
[2:17:00] thinking about that healing but in one
[2:17:02] moment
[2:17:03] under inspiration Joe Adams felt led of
[2:17:06] God and God honored his leadership and
[2:17:09] the power of God healed her and today
[2:17:12] she sets a healed woman because of the
[2:17:15] atmosphere and the word of God came
[2:17:18] together
[2:17:22] if he can change if he can change the
[2:17:25] joint
[2:17:26] he can change the whole body if it could
[2:17:29] change the liver he could change the
[2:17:31] whole body if he could add the eye he
[2:17:33] could add everything
[2:17:38] oh brother Wayne it's been too long
[2:17:40] don't you go and tell me you can't
[2:17:42] don't you tell me this can't happen it's
[2:17:45] been too long well I love this Bible
[2:17:47] because it's full of people that it
[2:17:49] looked like things were just too long
[2:17:52] 12 years 12 years I believe it was she
[2:17:55] bled wasn't it 12 years
[2:17:58] let me ask you this how many hospital
[2:18:00] bills and doctor bills does a woman
[2:18:02] pilot in 12 years what would her coffee
[2:18:05] table look like after 12 years of a
[2:18:08] blood issue and she couldn't get over
[2:18:09] amen doctor visit after doctor visit
[2:18:12] after doctor visit amen going to the
[2:18:14] sanctuary and offering lambs and asking
[2:18:16] for healing and doing everything that is
[2:18:18] possible amen 12 years but somebody said
[2:18:21] there was this Messiah on the Earth but
[2:18:24] never mind him as he's just an
[2:18:26] illegitimate man and he has no real
[2:18:28] teaching he has nobody really behind him
[2:18:30] he's just kind of a free-for-all out
[2:18:32] there we really don't know about that
[2:18:33] guy amen but she had never saw him but
[2:18:36] when she heard he was passing by her way
[2:18:39] something happened in her little heart
[2:18:42] and said he's the only hope I got
[2:18:46] and the Bible says she went out there on
[2:18:49] the street and she was so shameful
[2:18:51] brother her lifestyle being under what
[2:18:54] she was she couldn't even touch him but
[2:18:58] she said if I could just touch the heel
[2:19:01] of the Garment of this man then I would
[2:19:04] be whole and the moment she touched him
[2:19:06] look what happens he turned and said
[2:19:08] virtue has gone for me what was it 12
[2:19:11] years and in an instant she was
[2:19:14] completely whole
[2:19:16] pressure I don't know about all these
[2:19:18] things what about a man late 38 years he
[2:19:21] laid 38 years most of you ain't even 38
[2:19:24] years old a late 38 years at the pool
[2:19:27] waiting for a healing for his body but
[2:19:30] the angel wasn't coming but they knew he
[2:19:32] was coming
[2:19:34] so they just kept waiting and waiting
[2:19:36] and waiting and waiting home at one day
[2:19:43] Jesus come walking by the well
[2:19:47] and took one man out of them all
[2:19:52] he said why are you why are you lame why
[2:19:55] why ain't you been healed how long you
[2:19:57] been coming here
[2:19:59] how long you been attending these
[2:20:01] meetings I love you why ain't you healed
[2:20:03] someone there ain't no man to help me in
[2:20:04] the water oh brother I tell you he's the
[2:20:07] man that can he's a man that can help
[2:20:09] you when nobody else can help you when
[2:20:11] nobody else will help you when nobody
[2:20:13] else sees your travel when nobody else
[2:20:15] thinks anything about you there's one
[2:20:17] here that cares about you and your
[2:20:20] situation I don't care how long
[2:20:24] I think it's safe to say his friends
[2:20:26] were tired of hearing him whining
[2:20:30] I think it was states to say he had laid
[2:20:32] there so long and everybody said don't
[2:20:34] mind him I don't think he's ever going
[2:20:36] to do anything he's going to lay here
[2:20:37] the rest of his life and it's never
[2:20:39] going to come no change to him oh but
[2:20:41] brother that morning was his morning
[2:20:43] that day was his day when Jesus come
[2:20:46] walking by amen 38 years
[2:20:52] Jesus said take your bed and walk
[2:20:55] I'll tell you don't leave there another
[2:20:57] day don't lay there another hour take up
[2:21:00] your bed and walk
[2:21:01] [Applause]
[2:21:04] oh brother Wayne I'll tell you things
[2:21:06] things happen so long well let me ask
[2:21:08] you this let me ask you this how long
[2:21:10] was Georgia Carter laying on the bed
[2:21:14] nine years the little girl laid there
[2:21:18] I tell you what when I study these
[2:21:20] things sometimes they just blow me away
[2:21:21] why would God let a girl lay nine years
[2:21:24] in that kind of shape
[2:21:26] her church her church took away all hope
[2:21:30] her church even her mama was a believer
[2:21:32] in Jesus but she said God don't do them
[2:21:34] kind of things no more that's not the
[2:21:37] ace for that God don't work miracles
[2:21:38] like that you might as well just lay
[2:21:40] there and forget all about this healing
[2:21:42] power and all this Supernatural stuff
[2:21:45] that's in days gone by but the little
[2:21:48] girl got a hold of a book
[2:21:49] can I say this she smelt the water
[2:21:54] and brother she knew somewhere there was
[2:21:56] a healing for her body
[2:21:58] [Applause]
[2:21:59] God sent a prophet down there nine years
[2:22:02] now now it's a it's an amazing story and
[2:22:04] I won't go into all of it but I won't
[2:22:05] tell you this part of it when brother
[2:22:07] random got a vision it was for one and
[2:22:09] when he got that Vision he went in the
[2:22:11] room as she was and remember what he
[2:22:13] said he said Georgie quieter in the name
[2:22:15] of Jesus Christ Rise Up from that man
[2:22:17] how many knows what she was sick with
[2:22:20] she was sick with tuberculosis
[2:22:23] tuberculosis caused by a fact of her
[2:22:27] uncle raping her and putting this kind
[2:22:30] of disease in this child's body amen
[2:22:33] some emotional hurt had so become real
[2:22:36] that it had affected the way she could
[2:22:38] live and now she was full of
[2:22:39] tuberculosis and she was laying there
[2:22:42] dying but a prophet stood there with a
[2:22:45] vision of God and said today is a day of
[2:22:48] change Rise Up from your bed Georgie
[2:22:53] and you say Preacher what's so important
[2:22:55] about that how did she get out of the
[2:22:57] bed brother how'd she do it her legs had
[2:23:00] been laying there so long she had no
[2:23:01] power she had no ability to walk but the
[2:23:04] god that told her to get up was the same
[2:23:06] God that could give her power to walk
[2:23:08] and I don't care how long you've been
[2:23:11] laying in the depths of sin and
[2:23:13] struggles of your life or whose fault it
[2:23:15] is your man forget it all rise up of
[2:23:19] your being and begin to walk in the
[2:23:22] power of God
[2:23:24] foreign
[2:23:27] I'll tell you I'll tell you as a
[2:23:29] preacher I read these things differently
[2:23:30] and I'll tell you what blew my mind when
[2:23:32] I read it was tuberculosis that got her
[2:23:34] when I read that I stepped there and
[2:23:36] just labored over that a minute and I
[2:23:37] said dear God this is not very many
[2:23:40] years past William Branham has lost his
[2:23:43] own wife to tuberculosis and now he's
[2:23:47] standing there in the face of the same
[2:23:49] demon that took his wife but under a
[2:23:52] vision he knew that God is still God it
[2:23:56] doesn't matter if someone dies with a
[2:23:58] disease it mean it was their time to go
[2:24:00] it does not mean that God lost his power
[2:24:03] over the disease
[2:24:08] the sighting thing
[2:24:12] you say preacher what are you trying to
[2:24:14] get at I'm trying to get it something
[2:24:15] right here that you're able to walk
[2:24:17] I say you're able to walk today because
[2:24:19] God has given to you amen there is one
[2:24:22] here right now that can change your body
[2:24:25] there's somebody in this building can
[2:24:27] change your mind you say we've been
[2:24:28] waiting I know he's coming I know he's
[2:24:30] coming I know the Lord is coming keep
[2:24:32] looking for him I know he's coming he
[2:24:34] said well what happens if I pass before
[2:24:36] he comes it's in the Bible already
[2:24:39] amen they came to him and they said to
[2:24:42] Robert's daughter is sick will you come
[2:24:44] and pray he said yes I will come to her
[2:24:47] and he started on his way but he was
[2:24:50] late getting there because in the middle
[2:24:53] of his journey they came and said the
[2:24:55] girl already died never mind he said no
[2:24:58] I'll go wake her
[2:25:01] [Applause]
[2:25:02] somebody said what does he mean by that
[2:25:04] brother man said it meant this it meant
[2:25:06] that her name was predestinated before
[2:25:08] the foundation of the world and though
[2:25:10] she was sleeping she could never die and
[2:25:12] he didn't only say it he proved it when
[2:25:15] he went down to her house and he called
[2:25:18] her name what'd he do he dismissed the
[2:25:21] believer unbelievers he dismissed the
[2:25:23] make-believers and had a resurrection
[2:25:26] with just a little group of people and
[2:25:29] I'll tell you what this end time
[2:25:30] Resurrection is going to take place
[2:25:32] somebody said well my loved one was well
[2:25:35] ready went on this one's already went on
[2:25:37] you will lose nothing waiting on Jesus
[2:25:39] you will lose nothing waiting on Jesus
[2:25:42] when Jesus gets here every believer that
[2:25:45] has been placed into the grave he will
[2:25:48] raise them up out of the Grave he'll
[2:25:50] call their name and no great could hold
[2:25:55] I don't care if they've been there 10
[2:25:56] years 20 years 30 years I don't care how
[2:25:59] long they're there when he speaks the
[2:26:02] grades will open and they will raise
[2:26:04] from the dead
[2:26:05] [Applause]
[2:26:11] now job said it he said when he calls
[2:26:15] I will answer
[2:26:17] let me tell you this morning friends
[2:26:19] he's calling
[2:26:21] some of you are already resurrected I'm
[2:26:23] late I know other musicians come some of
[2:26:26] God's already called some of you you've
[2:26:28] already been resurrected you said
[2:26:30] already brother bam said your soul has
[2:26:32] already been changed
[2:26:34] [Applause]
[2:26:38] you've already left cigarettes you've
[2:26:41] already left tobacco you've already left
[2:26:43] the habits of the world the spirit
[2:26:45] quickening Power of Jesus Christ is
[2:26:47] already working on you
[2:26:53] the same one
[2:26:56] I hate time
[2:26:59] the same one
[2:27:02] that raised them
[2:27:05] is here to raise you
[2:27:11] whether they're sleeping in the grave
[2:27:13] or they're alive
[2:27:17] so brother Wayne what's the mystery of
[2:27:19] this
[2:27:20] brother Bram said
[2:27:21] that Abraham and Sarah received the word
[2:27:23] and their body materialized
[2:27:28] around that word
[2:27:31] he said preacher what are you say and
[2:27:33] I'm saying in John 14 and 19 it said
[2:27:34] because I live
[2:27:36] you live also
[2:27:38] what a resurrection that was
[2:27:40] what a resurrection this is see two live
[2:27:43] two lives one's for the bride groom
[2:27:46] once for the bride but in John 14 and 20
[2:27:49] it says this and at that day
[2:27:52] you will know that I am the Father the
[2:27:53] father me and I and you brother said
[2:27:55] what does that means it means God will
[2:27:56] become tangible
[2:28:00] he will take on flesh
[2:28:02] the changer is already in you
[2:28:07] the thing that'll change your bodies in
[2:28:09] you
[2:28:10] if they put me in the ground I'm coming
[2:28:12] up
[2:28:13] nobody's got to do nothing nobody's
[2:28:15] going to say anything he'll call and
[2:28:16] I'll answer
[2:28:17] [Applause]
[2:28:22] my goodness
[2:28:23] it's a change
[2:28:25] what will happen brother Brandon we said
[2:28:27] well
[2:28:28] he said there'll be just a change come
[2:28:29] over you
[2:28:31] somebody said brother Wayne
[2:28:33] I think when the saints appear that it's
[2:28:36] going to bring this quickening power
[2:28:37] upon the church and then we're all going
[2:28:38] to be changed well
[2:28:39] you could say that
[2:28:41] because brother Ram said maybe at one
[2:28:43] place he said you'll be out there
[2:28:44] hanging your clothes
[2:28:46] isn't that beautiful
[2:28:48] not any special day
[2:28:52] sister you're hanging your clothes
[2:28:55] and you look over and there stands a
[2:28:57] loved one
[2:28:59] he said then you'll be changed
[2:29:02] but don't get hung up there
[2:29:05] because there's another one that he says
[2:29:08] you'll get up maybe you'll be standing
[2:29:09] there and he said all of a sudden this
[2:29:11] change will come over you
[2:29:13] he said then you'll look around
[2:29:16] and you'll begin to see the loved ones
[2:29:18] that have went on already
[2:29:25] some of you
[2:29:27] will be changed and see them
[2:29:30] and some of you'll be seeing them and be
[2:29:32] changed
[2:29:33] what difference does it make
[2:29:36] you're going to change
[2:29:38] [Applause]
[2:29:52] brother Wayne what's going to happen
[2:29:54] we're going to be changed
[2:29:56] the living will be changed
[2:29:58] the dead will be changed
[2:30:01] he'll change us all
[2:30:06] if you're in the grave
[2:30:09] little man changed his teaching a bit
[2:30:10] and showed you the souls under the altar
[2:30:12] was speaking of the Jew and not the
[2:30:14] bride
[2:30:15] so the soul wasn't meaning theophany
[2:30:18] after the seals he taught us that it was
[2:30:20] an actually a body a tabernacle
[2:30:24] that you move into after you die
[2:30:27] right holding place
[2:30:30] but what about if we're alive
[2:30:36] he said that body
[2:30:39] come get us
[2:30:43] can you imagine
[2:30:45] right now that spirit
[2:30:47] that keeps sweeping through this room
[2:30:49] back and forth
[2:30:51] is preparing you for change
[2:30:55] okay
[2:30:56] the the feeling of that anointing when
[2:30:59] it comes that sweeping spirit
[2:31:02] same thing that changes your body
[2:31:08] the seed is already planted
[2:31:12] we're looking for the atmosphere to
[2:31:14] change
[2:31:16] I say let us have a body change in
[2:31:18] atmosphere
[2:31:20] welcome the one that changes everything
[2:31:23] can you imagine right now
[2:31:26] can you imagine this right now if you
[2:31:28] looked up
[2:31:30] brother Charlie come walking out on the
[2:31:31] platform with us
[2:31:34] don't think I'm a fool
[2:31:37] it's going to happen
[2:31:40] some of you are going to see it
[2:31:45] I really believe God will let some of
[2:31:47] the dear ones to us
[2:31:52] I believe that
[2:31:54] we may be having these fall meetings and
[2:31:55] sister Karen come
[2:31:58] I think the last time I was in a good
[2:31:59] meet my sister Karen she was running she
[2:32:01] was literally running around the place
[2:32:03] she was supposed to be uh supposed to be
[2:32:06] in a bed with stroke or something
[2:32:07] somebody sang a song
[2:32:10] she took off
[2:32:12] I seen I seen a miracle running the
[2:32:14] building
[2:32:17] I believe this
[2:32:20] I believe we could look around an 18
[2:32:22] year old sister Karen come running right
[2:32:23] through here with us
[2:32:25] so I don't believe all that running
[2:32:27] stuff let me tell you something
[2:32:29] let me tell you something
[2:32:32] you let me look in a mirror at a 21 year
[2:32:35] old man you ain't never seen a fit in
[2:32:37] your life
[2:32:40] you ain't never seen shouting you ain't
[2:32:44] never seen dancing
[2:32:49] Jimbo
[2:32:51] if you looked over right now sister
[2:32:52] can't stand over her arm around you I
[2:32:54] figure a jig would be in that order
[2:32:59] so by the way and I don't know about all
[2:33:01] that listen amen I don't know about you
[2:33:04] but when I get in heaven
[2:33:08] I'm going to have the time of my life
[2:33:11] but why wait till we get to heaven
[2:33:14] [Music]
[2:33:16] I already got a promise
[2:33:18] and if I act like this with promise
[2:33:21] What's it gonna be when it actually
[2:33:23] changes on our flesh this ain't a power
[2:33:27] dream this ain't an imagination the
[2:33:30] feeling that's in our body will develop
[2:33:32] a change how the twinkling of an eye and
[2:33:35] we'll have new bodies
[2:33:37] the dead will be raised brother I tell
[2:33:40] you you ain't ever you ain't never
[2:33:42] Spirits nothing like what we're about to
[2:33:43] experience
[2:33:46] it won't just be brother Branham it
[2:33:48] won't miss brother Tim it won't be this
[2:33:49] brother Wade and Apostle Paul it won't
[2:33:51] just be the men of God who's been
[2:33:53] through the ages
[2:33:56] come on y'all know what mother Brown
[2:33:58] said he said he'd let us get together he
[2:34:01] said and let us meet one another he said
[2:34:03] and get all of that out of the way he
[2:34:06] said because the next thing we were
[2:34:07] going to do we were going to meet the
[2:34:09] Lord Jesus Christ brother let me tell
[2:34:12] you something you can say he's just a
[2:34:14] figment you can say he's just a spirit
[2:34:17] you can say whatever you want to say but
[2:34:20] that is my Jesus and one of these days
[2:34:22] I'm going to print my hands on those
[2:34:25] male scarred feet I'm gonna put my hands
[2:34:28] upon the face that died for me I'm going
[2:34:31] to be able to touch the body
[2:34:35] brother it's a promise I'm gonna see him
[2:34:39] and I'm gonna be with him for that
[2:34:41] eternity you can call me a fool you can
[2:34:44] call me crazy but brother one of these
[2:34:46] mornings you call me gold I won't be
[2:34:48] here I won't be on the search no more
[2:34:50] I'm gonna go home with my Lord
[2:34:56] I believe it
[2:34:59] if you said by the way there's a lot
[2:35:01] more to it I agree I got a bunch more
[2:35:02] here but I don't have time to preach it
[2:35:03] today
[2:35:05] friends
