Many serious needs tonight. As brother Aaron opens the service, [music] let's just take them to the Lord in prayer together. Amen. Let's pray together. Father, how grateful [music] we are, Lord. Lord, in situations like this, Lord, with so many serious needs, Lord, [music] in a world that seems to be falling apart, Lord, Lord, where where would we go? What would we turn to? [music] What would our rock be, Lord, if it wasn't for you, Lord? I just want to say thank you tonight, Lord. Lord, that in the midst of chaos, [music] Lord, we have peace. In the midst of chaos, we have an anchor. Lord, in the middle of great needs, Lord, when when there's there's cancer and and there's Parkinson's [music] and there's loss of life and struggle all around us, Lord, we know we have a God who cares and [music] understands, who delivers and heals, Lord. Lord, we just want to say thank you tonight, Lord. You are our [music] rock, Lord. You are our strong fortress, Lord, our strong tower. And we just want to say thank you tonight, Lord, that you care and that you [music] love us, Lord. that you Lord that you sent us a message in this day to show us that you are the same yesterday, today, [music] and forever. Lord, I'm thankful tonight, Lord, that as the world is falling apart, Lord, we have a safe place, Lord. Lord, we have a true word and a place to stand, Lord, a a sure footing tonight, [music] Father. Lord, we just come tonight to lift up your name and to praise you, Lord, for you alone are worthy of praise, Lord. You alone are worthy, Lord, of of our lives, of our time, Lord, of of everything that we can give, Lord. Tonight, may we just look to [music] go deeper in love with you, Lord. Lord, may we even look past the veil of the man bringing the message tonight. [music] And Lord, and find the uncction of the Holy Spirit that's speaking to our life, speaking to our heart, Lord. [music] Lord, recognize tonight that this is an opportunity to hear from heaven, Lord. I pray we won't [music] let it pass us by, but may each one of us grab a hold of it tonight, Lord. Lord, and take this opportunity, [music] Lord, to draw closer and deeper and know you more. Lord, we just thank you for this opportunity. We thank you, Lord, for all that you've done in our lives, Lord. We thank you that despite the battles and struggles and Lord, in everything we face, we can look and say, "You've been so good to us, Lord. [music] Lord, you've kept us, Lord. You've healed us. You've delivered us. You've brought us through so many battles, Lord. Lord, we can look ahead and know there may be more battles to come, but you said you'd never leave us and never forsake us." And we can look in faith tonight, Lord, knowing, Lord, that we're [music] the victors, Lord, because of who you are. And we thank you for that. Lord, we come tonight with so many needs, Lord. So many read across this desk, Lord. I'm just asking that you'll move on each situation, Lord. The [music] different ones, whether it be, Lord, cancer or surgery, Lord, or Parkinson's, Lord, the loss of life. There's just so many things, Lord. But Lord, you have the need. You you you're the need supplying God, Lord. And before those requests were read, you knew and you cared and you answered, Lord, and you provided the the answer, Lord. I want to give you [music] thanks tonight, Lord, for the report on Michael Joiner, Lord. And Lord, the miraculous thing that [music] you've done and you've brought him off the the vent. And Lord, I'm just asking that, Lord, not only will you do a full recovery in [music] his body, but a restoration, Lord. Lord, not just to to church, that'd be great, but Lord, may you just draw him to [music] Calvary, Lord. Lord, to know you as his savior, Lord. Lord, we just come tonight. Tonight we just ask that you'll heal, Lord, every one of these needs, [music] Lord. But Lord, not only those, but there's hearts that need healing tonight. There's spirits that need mending, Lord. I'm just asking you'll move in this [music] building, Lord. Everyone that's put forth the effort to come and be a part, Lord. May you just pour [music] yourself into them tonight. Lord, anoint the minister, but Lord, anoint us to receive what's [music] ministered. We commit it all into your hands now, Lord. We thank you, Lord, for all that you're going to do in Jesus name.

Say in my father's in my [music and singing] father's house there's a place for [singing and music] me. Oh I'm a child of God. Oh yes I am. [music] [singing] Oh father's [music] house. There's a place [singing] just for me. Oh, I'm a child [music] of God. Yes, I think God I am chosen. Say I am [music and singing] chosen, not forsaken. I am who you say I am. You [music and singing] are for me, not against me. I [music] am who you say I [singing] am. &gt;&gt; I am chosen, [music] not forsaken. [singing] And I am who you say I am. You are for [music] me, not against me. I am [singing and music] who you say I am. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Who the sun [singing] sets free. You are free. [music] [singing] Oh, I'm a child. Oh yes, I am [music and singing] in my father's house. Take my heart. [music] [music] [singing] Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; How many children of God here tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. We just thank the [music] Lord for that. Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, we come to you, Lord. Just asking [music] once again that you'd come and take control, Lord, and speak, move, that you would just touch us, Lord, by your grace and mercy [music] tonight, Lord. And God, you just wash over us with your presence. And Lord, that thanksgiving can come from our hearts and our lives, Lord. So thankful for all that you've done for [music] us, who we were and where we were headed, God, but Lord, you turned us around and you picked us up. We got so much to be thankful for. We just ask, Father, you just come and just minister to us in your word. We pray in Jesus name. [music] Amen. Amen. Let's turn to First Thessalonians 5 verse 16. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Says, "Rejoice." I'm going to read the amplified version if that's okay. But rejoice always and delight in your faith. Be unceasing and persistent in prayer in every situation, no matter what the circumstances be. Be thankful and continually give thanks to God for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. Amen. We let you be seated. I actually sometimes you put things in, you don't read it all yourself when you put it in there. And just struck me as it's written here. Rejoice always and delight in your faith. I I want to I want to speak on thankful faith. Thankful faith. You know, we just come through Thanksgiving and and it's a wonderful a wonderful holiday just to stop for a moment and and to think about and reminisce and to be thankful for all that God has given us in our life. And you know, but anymore, it's almost a overlooked day. Uh definitely an overlooked holiday. Commercially, people's minds have already been geared towards Christmas and toward the commercial aspects of that. And too many are no longer even taking the day to remember what all we have to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; You know, being thankful is is actually is an expression of gratitude. But too many have become unthankful and ungrateful for all the bountiful blessings God has even given this country or even you know never even stop for a moment to think about where all these blessings come from like brother Brandham referenced many times of a hog that's under an apple tree and you know he eats apples all day long and they'll fall even from the tree and beat him on the head and he'll never look up to see where they're coming from and he said that's just the way we are many times we absolutely absolutely will. God will pour his blessings upon us and then we'll never look up to say, "Thank you, Lord. I'm so glad to be here. I'm thankful you've given me something to eat." We just go ahead and just like he owed it to us, but actually he owes us nothing. &gt;&gt; We owe everything to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We owe all that we are to him. And so, you know, actually unthankful was a word that Paul would even use speaking to Timothy about the last days. He said there'd be, you know, perilous time shall come. And he would use that word unthankful. And I I believe we're actually living in that day, the last days. And and we see people that are very unthankful. They're unthankful for things that's very common. You know, that's really really reason times things that people get in that condition because things become very common. And sometimes when something becomes common, people stop noticing its value. You know, I I I I one time preached a message on on the on the whale that David had and because I actually, it's kind of a humorous story. I was in the early years of my ministry and struggling on a Wednesday to come up with something with a to preach, you know, and and brother Aaron at that time was in school. And so he actually called me and said, "What are you doing?" He was living there down the street at my dad's place while he was going to school. And and so he said, "What are you doing?" He said, "I want to take you for lunch. Let's go." I said, "Well, I'm studying. I don't have anything. I'm trying to come. I'm cramming, you know. And he said, "Well, sometimes and study, you know, it's just good to get away from it and come back and maybe something to open." And so, actually, at that time, we had a little restaurant there in Homer. It was a Chinese restaurant. And got through eating and opened up. And it says, "No, the little cookie, you know, it says, "No one knows the worth of water until the well is dry." And I would take that and to David how that he longed for a drink from Bethlehem. And no doubt many times he would go by that day after day. But it was that day that it was no longer available that it became something that was very important to him. And people, you know, do that in their own lives. Unfortunately, many times people are not as important to us until they're gone. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I mean, our daddies, our mamas are not sometimes so important to us until they're gone. And then we won't we would be so thankful to have an opportunity to sit down with them again to talk with them to speak to them you know because things become common you know and people stop noticing his value and they know comfort and stability actually can make blessings feel normal rather than sp special. Amen. So, and then other another reason people become unthankful is they begin to compare themselves to others and to other people who are more successful or are more wealthy and seemingly more happy and and you know this creates a sense of lack which overshadows what one really has and what one one really has to be grateful for. Amen. And you know actually I just read a in studying this I read many statements on thanksgiving and thankfulness and one of them was Amen. A grateful heart or a thankful heart actually makes what you have enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in this world you know it's it's geared towards you got to have more and you got to have more and you got to have more. There's never a place where you can come to having enough. Amen. And another one is entitlement. is entitlement where believing one deserves certain benefits or a certain treatment or expecting others to meet their needs automatically reduces the appreciation when the need is met. Stress can also overwhelm you and over being overwhelmed with exhaustion or being anxious or overloaded. Gratitude becomes harder to access and problems begin to feel larger and a and and and then the positives that you have in your life and you know even negative past experiences that come from trauma or betrayal or you know hardships make people more guarded and they struggle to trust good things or trust good friendships or trust good people. Amen. And we live in a world it's hard to trust anybody anymore. You know, you should didn't think about anything about stopping and fixing a flat for somebody or stopping. Now, the first thing that goes to your mind when you see somebody with a flat that it's a setup that they're trying to rob you or something you why it's the world that we live in become people have become amen so guarded because of negative things and negative issues and and negative problems and negative situations and in turn become more unthankful for what they have. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it actually starts a lack of reflection. and it's a moving path too fast that that to just pause and appreciate what you have that's going well. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, uh and then of course, you know, there's a a strain some people have that's really haunts them is perfectionism where you're focusing on what's not good enough instead of what is good enough. And and you have such high expectations that it makes gratitude or thankfulness difficult. &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's never good enough. You know, it seems that way in in a church, you know, in church settings especially, the the temperature is never good enough. The sound's never good enough. Nothing's never good enough for some people. And and it shouldn't be that way. We ought to be thankful for what we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know. Maybe maybe you just don't travel enough. You go to enough churches, you'll realize we are we got a lot to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got a lot to be grateful for that. Amen. There's churches that don't even have AC. They don't even have heating. They don't even have padded pews to sit on. Listen, we got a lot to be thankful for. I I want to bring it back to our forefront that there is something that you have to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so and then you know if you surround yourself with influences that are are negative and constantly complaining and ungrateful it'll shape your mindset and and begin to make it to where you're less grateful and le more complaining and and and it begins to shape a lot of things. So there's a lot of reasons but I I don't really want to focus on all the ungratefulness. I want to focus on being grateful. &gt;&gt; I want to speak again on thankful faith. You know, it's a mindset where gratitude and trust work together. And it's the kind of faith that recognizes blessings even in ordinary or difficult moments. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT TRUSTS THAT GOOD can come when the outcome is not clear. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. IT RESPONDS WITH GRATITUDE. THIS tra this fa this THANKFUL FAITH. IT RESPONDS WITH GRATITUDE rather than responding with fear or worry. Thankful faith sees the gift of the moment. It sees there's a purpose in every moment. Amen. IT SEES A HOPE BEYOND WHAT IS THE NATURAL eyes can even see. Amen. Philippians 4 and verse four says, "Rejoice in the Lord always with delight or take pleasure in him." Again, I say rejoice. Let your gentle spirit, your graciousness, your unselfishness, your mercy, your tolerance, your patience be known to all people. The Lord is near. DO NOT BE anxious or worried about anything, but in everything. Somebody say everything. By prayer and petition with thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prayer and petition with thanksgiving. Continue to make your specific request known to God. So thanksgiving is not just after the request. &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving is part of the request. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? It's not just after the request. and and the request is fulfilled and and you say, "Thank you, Lord. I thank you for giving me that. I I thank you for giving me that promotion. I thank you for giving me this money. I THANK NO, IT'S THANKING HIM BEFORE YOU EVER receive a dime." &gt;&gt; IT'S THANKING HIM BEFORE YOU EVER SEE THE OUTCOME. IT'S THANKING HIM WHILE YOU'RE PRAYING. SAY, "I WANT TO THANK YOU, LORD, THAT YOU'RE FAITHFUL. I WANT TO THANK YOU, LORD, THAT YOU SEE my need and you see me where I AM AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING THAT kind of God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in turn, gratitude or thankfulness, it actually opens the door of peace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it continues there. And the peace of God. Amen. The peace that reassures the heart. That peace which transcends all understanding. So in other words, when you can't understand, you can still have peace. &gt;&gt; When you don't understand, you can still have peace. That peace which transcends all understanding stands guard over your heart and your mind in Christ Jesus. Amen. Colossians 2:6 says, "And ye therefore receive Christ Jesus the Lord. So walk ye in him rooted, builded up, established in the faith as you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving." So notice faith and thanksgiving is tied right directly together at the hill. &gt;&gt; Amen. Overflow. In other words, abounding is overflowing with thanksgiving. So faith and thanksgiving are inseparable. True faith produces gratitude and gratitude strengthens faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. And gratitude strengthens faith. It is not a gratitude or thanksgiving after a blessing or an ANSWERED PRAYER. IT'S THANKFUL WHILE praying and waiting. &gt;&gt; IT'S THANKFUL BEFORE THERE'S A SIGN OF A BLESSING. That's right. &gt;&gt; And then it's, you know, it's not only rooted AND IT'S NOT ONLY BUILT UP AND YOU'RE NOT ONLY ESTABLISHED BUT ALSO ABOUNDING OR OVERFLOWING WITH THANKSGIVING. SO THANKSGIVING IS A TRAIT OR A SIGN OF A mature believer. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Negativity is a sign of a shallow believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All they can find is something to be negative at. You're a shallow believer. Go on and get rooted a little deeper. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thanksgiving is a sign of a mature believer. The more rooted and built up, the more established &gt;&gt; and the more established, the more thankful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have myself a lovely time studying all this. The more ability YOU HAVE TO THE MORE ABILITY YOU HAVE TO TURN YOUR EYES FROM YOUR DISAPPOINTMENTS AND THE PROBLEMS, THE MORE ABILITY YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN YOUR EYES TOWARD THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You know, Colossians 3:15, it says, "Let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which you are called in one body, and be ye thankful." &gt;&gt; Period. Right. &gt;&gt; I didn't I didn't I didn't see no uh small print past thankful, you know, thankful if everything's going good and thankful if there's money in the bank and thankful if you got a lot of friends and thankful if everybody loves you and you're getting patted on the back and nobody's No, it says, "And be you thankful." &gt;&gt; So you come to church, be you thankful. &gt;&gt; I got a church to come to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got believers to be with. I GOT A GOOD PASTOR. I GOT I GOT GOOD MINISTRY. I I GOT GOOD SINGERS. I GOT GOOD MUSICIANS. I I GOT A LOT TO BE THANKFUL FOR. I I GOT PEOPLE SITTING BESIDE ME THAT'S HELPING ME CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND MIRACLES CAN TAKE PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Another saying I read was a a thankful heart is a magnet for miracles. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I love it. So it's not be you thankful if all's going good and the bills are paid and everyone loves you and nobody said a bad word to you and you know everything's great on Facebook and all this is happening. You know this is not a suggestion. &gt;&gt; That is a command. &gt;&gt; Be ye thankful. &gt;&gt; It's a command and everything give thanks. WE WE DON'T GIVE THANKS FOR EVIL but we do give thanks in the midst of evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE FAITH LOOKS AND SAYS ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR MY GOOD. A THANKFUL FAITH SAYS, "NO CIRCUMSTANCE IS EXEMPT FROM MY GOD'S ABILITY TO USE IT FOR MY GOOD." &gt;&gt; SO EVEN WHEN BLESSING SEEMS ABSENCE AND EVERYTHING'S AGAINST US, FAITH REMAINS THANKFUL. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? This is what we read in Habacook 3 and verse 17. If you can turn there. Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines and the labor of the olive shall fail, and the field shall yield no meat, and the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in THE STALLS. YET I WILL REJOICE in the Lord, &gt;&gt; and I will enjoy IN THE GOD OF MY SALVATION. THE LORD GOD IS MY STRENGTH AND HE WILL MAKE my feet like hind's feet and he WILL MAKE ME TO WALK UPON my high places. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, MY GOD'S GOING TO EXALT ME. &gt;&gt; CUZ NONE OF THIS ON THIS EARTH HAS ANYTHING. IT'S ALL TEMPORARY. &gt;&gt; IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY ETERNAL VALUE AND WHO I AM ETERNAL. IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY DWELLING PLACE. IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY TIME. IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY TROUBLE. COME ON. IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY SICKNESS. IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY PROBLEM THAT you're going through. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT HAS NO BEARING ON WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. THAT ETERNAL JES BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. &gt;&gt; So no matter if there's money, let me just read it in our language. All right. If there's money in the bank and my job's going good and nobody's about to fire me and everything's perfect and You know, we get so unthankful sometimes. God gives us a job and we find out all the faults he's got. &gt;&gt; Okay, I get on something there. &gt;&gt; You know, listen, what's the first thing you do when you buy a car? Okay, I'll just speak about me. First thing you do when you buy a car, you get buyer's remorse, right? Why did I do this? And then that turns into, man, do you hear that noise? &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? I hear all kind of problems going on. &gt;&gt; Listen to that. Do you hear that? And you get a mechanic in there. He can't hear nothing. &gt;&gt; Car don't ever make that noise when I get a mechanic in here, I tell you. And you get in back and it starts making up and what is it? And all this negativity starts building up. &gt;&gt; That's right. And it turns from being thankful that God gave me a job to where I could able to buy a car that I can be able to have a car to go get my groceries that I can have groceries so I can eat and I can have I can eat so I can have strength and I have strength. INSTEAD OF BEING THANKFUL we it turns into regret &gt;&gt; and there MEANWHILE PEOPLE WHO WOULD DREAM OF OWNING THE WORST CAR IN THE PARKING LOT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE THEIR DREAM [screaming] TO HAVE THE WORST CAR SITTING OUT THERE IN THAT PARKING LOT. &gt;&gt; I know. I I was a 17 year old boy went to Africa for the first time and drove in this car and it was the only car that would show up at a churchyard church in a churchyard full of 500 people in the church and this man as 30ome years old had finally been able to buy his first car. And it wasn't a nice car. &gt;&gt; It was a it was a great car for him and and this area, I'm sure, but it was not what we look at AS A NICE CAR. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; We become so unthankful &gt;&gt; and God gives us the abilities and God gives us things and he gives us all the things that we have around us and it becomes so common and all I go I I wish I had that car and I wished I had that house and I and it's a constant rat race &gt;&gt; instead of just being thankful for what God did give you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, let let me just bring it on down. There's a lot of people that would dream of having your seat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD LOVE TO. THEY'D LOVE TO BE SITTING RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AND WE GET TO SIT THERE ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU KIDDING ME? &gt;&gt; We get to come ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS AIN'T SOMETHING TO BE A DRUDGERY. THIS IS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR. I HAVE THE ABILITY. I HAVE THE RIGHT AS AN AMERICAN TO COME ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND GIVE THANKS TO MY GOD FOR WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME. [applause] &gt;&gt; I don't have to hide. I DON'T HAVE TO BE I DON'T HAVE TO RUN AWAY. I AIN'T GOT TO WORRY ABOUT SOMEBODY STEPPING IN. I GOT ALL THE RIGHT IN THE WORLD TO [screaming] LIFT MY HANDS AND PRAISE MY GOD. &gt;&gt; There's a lot to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what we should do when we come in in Psalm 69 and verse 30 says, "I will praise I will praise the name of the Lord with a SONG AND WILL MAGNIFY HIM WITH THANKSGIVING." &gt;&gt; INDEED. &gt;&gt; SO THANKSGIVING MAGNIFIES GOD'S GREATNESS. NOW, CAN YOU JUST for a minute take that WORD AT FACE VALUE? IT MAGNIFIES, IN OTHER WORDS, IT MAKES HIM GREATER. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And in MAKING HIM GREATER IN TURN, IT MINIMIZES YOUR PROBLEMS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT MINIMIZES YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO THANK GOD, IT MAKES GOD GREATER THAN YOUR PROBLEMS AND YOUR PROBLEMS GET SMARTER AND YOUR GOD GETS BIGGER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Psalms 100 verse1 says, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye land, serve the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord, he is God. It is he that has made us and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. My God, there's so much to be thankful for right there. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T PUT MYSELF HERE. GOD PUT ME HERE. I DIDN'T CALL MYSELF. GOD CALLED ME. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT HERE ON YOUR OWN WILL. YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE OF GOD'S WILL TO PUT YOU HERE. AND THE DEVIL HAD A WILL, BUT GOD HAD A GREATER WILL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So we enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise. &gt;&gt; Be thankful unto him and bless his name. For the Lord is good. His mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations. &gt;&gt; So thanksgiving actually opens the door into his presence. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Did we not just read that? Entering his gates with thanksgiving. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It literally lifts you out of your problems and into his presence. &gt;&gt; So, no wonder the devil wants us to be unthankful &gt;&gt; cuz all we can see is our problems and all we can see is the issues and all we can see is this and can't get nothing out of church and we we won't sing because it ain't this. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving opens the door into his presence. David does not say enter in with perfection. &gt;&gt; He don't say enter in with rituals. He don't say enter in with grace. He says enter into his courts with thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving is the key THAT OPENS THE GATE. THANKSGIVING IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT GOD IS THE GIVER OF EVERY GOOD THING. IT SHIFTS YOUR FOCUS FROM YOUR LACK TO YOUR GOD IS FAITHFUL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; A THANKFUL HEART DECLARES CONFIDENCE IN YOUR GOD BEFORE YOU EVER SEE THE FIRST RESULT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving is not a feeling. &gt;&gt; It's a choice. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; It's a choice. &gt;&gt; If it was a feeling, we wouldn't none of us ever hardly give thanks, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. Because you don't always feel thankful. &gt;&gt; Your body don't feel thankful. Right. Right. Brother Andy went over and helped Brother Andy lay a floor yesterday. My body ain't feeling thankful right now, but I'm thankful it's done. &gt;&gt; Thankful you can enjoy it. &gt;&gt; But my body ain't feeling thankful. It's hurting. Sore, right? &gt;&gt; Don't look at me like you ain't never been there. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. We But we don't always feel that way. So we don't come in here feeling thankful sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But a thankful heart or a thankful faith declares confidence in your God before you ever feel anything. &gt;&gt; It it's you know thanksgiving comes from the Hebrew word to toadah. Can anybody say that? Toadah. &gt;&gt; Toadah. &gt;&gt; That means you're thankful. Toad. That's a good word to learn. Toad. It's a confession. It's a praise. It's a thanksgiving. It's giving praise to God. It's thanksgiving. This is the meanings of it all. In songs of worship or hymns of praise. It's thanksgiving in a choir or a possession or a line or a company. It's thanks offering or sac sacrifice of thanksgiving. It's a confession. And the word is actually drawn as a hand. &gt;&gt; It's interesting. IT'S DRAWN AS A HAND. IT'S AN ACTION and lifting of hands. It's a noun meaning PRAISE OR THANKSGIVING. THE WORD DESCRIBES AN OFFERING OF THANKS OR A SACRIFICE OF THANKSGIVING. THE WORD DEPICTS WORSHIP BY THE PRES PRESENTATION OF SONGS OF THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE that extol or lift up the mighty WONDERS OF THE LORD. IT REFERS TO SHOUTS OF JUBILATION AND THANKSGIVING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SACRIFICE OF THANKSGIVING. BEING THANKFUL EVEN WHEN THE FEELINGS are not there. That's right. &gt;&gt; It means you enter in EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT. &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU AIN'T HAD THE BEST WEEK. &gt;&gt; SO THIS IF you ain't had the best week, this is the best time to praise him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You enter in EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL BURDENED DOWN. &gt;&gt; You enter in EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And you enter in thankful &gt;&gt; by thanksgiving &gt;&gt; in spite of all the devil has done to beat you down and to keep you bound and maybe try to keep you from being here tonight. I'm still going to praise him. I'm still going to thank him for all he's done. I'm still going to magnify his name. I'm still going to glorify him. I'M STILL GOING TO WORSHIP HIM. I I DON'T CARE WHAT THE DEVIL HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT. I'M GOING TO PRAISE GOD ANYHOW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT MY BODY HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT. I'M GOING TO PRAISE GOD ANYHOW, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram talks about a sacrifice. He says, "What is a spiritual sacrifice?" That's what sons and daughters do, which are kings and priests, yet not in full possession, but they're making sacrifices, offering to God spiritual sacrifice. The fruit of your lips to praise him. The fruits of our lips. You say, "Well, brother Brandham, I don't feel like praising him." That's the time to make the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Praise him. Anyhow, &gt;&gt; you understand what is happening. And if you could really see what's happening in the other world, the devil's trying to keep you from that &gt;&gt; cuz he knows if you can ever get that hand that to die up. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all just need to tell the devil to die anyhow. &gt;&gt; I'm done with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You've been on my tail all weekend, all week, and you've been beating me down. You've been putting REGRETS AND YOU'VE BEEN PUTTING fear on ME AND ANXIETY TOO. I'M GOING TO PRAISE GOD ANYHOW. I'M GOING TO WORSHIP GOD ANYHOW. I'M GOING TO ENTER IN INTO THANKSGIVING. I'M GOING TO ENTER I'M GOING TO LEAVE MY PROBLEMS AND I'M GOING TO ENTER INTO HIS PRESENCE. I'M GOING TO LEAVE MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND I'M GOING TO ENTER INTO THE PRESENCE OF ANGELS. &gt;&gt; I DON'T FEEL LIKE PRAISING. THAT IS THE TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise him anyhow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When a little confusion comes in the church, said don't run over to one side and pout. &gt;&gt; If you do, he says, "You're sure not a priest." &gt;&gt; You pray through &gt;&gt; spiritual sacrifice and fruits of your lips giving praise to his name. See what I mean? Well, you say, "Well, I I don't feel like going to church." But you're a priest. It's your duty. You got to be there. Well, I don't feel like taking part in the service. You're a priest. MAKE YOUR DUTY. MAKE A SACRIFICE. &gt;&gt; MAKE A SACRIFICE. &gt;&gt; PUT THAT OLD TIRED BODY ON AN ALTAR. &gt;&gt; PUT THOSE OLD HURT FEELINGS ON AN ALTAR. SAY, "IT AIN'T ABOUT MY FEELINGS ANYHOW. IT'S ABOUT MY GOD. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T ABOUT WHAT I LIKE ANYHOW. IT'S ABOUT WHAT PLEASES HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; People get so tore up about what they Well, I don't like this and I don't like that. Quit worrying about what YOU DON'T. IT AIN'T ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE OR you like. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T ABOUT WHAT I LIKE OR DON'T LIKE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; We We all brother brother I think brother Daniel Williams always used they said everybody's got opinions like noses. Everybody got one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We all got them. We all got preferences. Every one of us do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We got favorite instruments. We got favorite preachers. We got favorite song leaders. We got favorite deacons. We got Yeah. favorite deacons. We do. Which means we have some with ain't so favorite. Right. You got the favorite. You got some not so favorite. I'm just saying anyway. Right. You got favorite people that you like to hang around. You like So you got all these. We all got preferences. Everyone we're human. &gt;&gt; But let's don't make our preferences something as spiritual. &gt;&gt; It's not spiritual. JUST LEAVE THEM AS PREFERENCES. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LET YOUR PREFERENCES OVERRIDE WHAT'S SPIRITUAL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, DON'T LET WHAT YOUR PREFERENCES ARE WHEN YOU COME INTO CHURCH SERVICE. WELL, THEY AIN'T GOT MY FAVORITE MUSICIANS UP THERE. THEY AIN'T GOT LISTEN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT NONE OF THAT. LIFT UP YOUR HANDS ANYWAY. TO DIE. [screaming] I'M GOING TO PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Going to worship him no matter what. [crying] He said, "Notice it was for everyone that was a priest in the Old Testament. Everyone in the New Testament that becomes a Christian, born again, becomes a priest of God." &gt;&gt; So that tells me a real key right there. If you can't offer a sacrifice of praise, that tells me you're not born again. &gt;&gt; Just simple. &gt;&gt; So if you're not born again, let's get that fixed first. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then if you get born again, I bet you a lot of your preferences won't be nowhere near as important. &gt;&gt; Cuz before you born again, some of you had a preference. What beer you drank, what cigarettes you smoked, right? &gt;&gt; I'm going deep deep off here, but all this stuff that you used to do, but all of a sudden when you got born again, none of that mattered anymore, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, same thing happens with your personal preferences and things that ain't considered a sin. WHEN YOU GET BORN AGAIN, YOU REALIZE NONE OF THAT STUFF MATTERS NO MORE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We give God the sacrifice of our lips, giving praise to his name, saying, "Well," you say, "I don't feel like it." Well, do it anyhow. That's a sacrifice. I'm too tired. The devil will tell you that till you go to hell. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Direct quote, right? I won't appeal to the prophet on that one cuz nobody throwing no wigs at me. Power decision. He says it. I feel too tired. The devil will tell you that till he takes you to hell. &gt;&gt; You're to make a spiritual sacrifice. &gt;&gt; But we have Look, we have so many reasons to be thankful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's nearly probably 100 whatever 150 people in here. Every one of them is a reason to be thankful. &gt;&gt; Right. every one of them. We in spite of what's going on around you, what you went through this week, you got a lot of reasons to be thankful. &gt;&gt; First off, we have salvation through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We were rescued from sin. &gt;&gt; WE WERE RESCUED FROM ETERNAL SEPARATION AND BROUGHT NIGH UNTO HIM. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We have forgiveness of sins. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you some things you can be thankful for, right? Maybe you ain't know. You don't know what you, but I'm TELLING YOU SO. YOUR RECORD IS clear [cheering] &gt;&gt; fully. FINALLY, IT'S FINISHED. &gt;&gt; YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. [applause] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE GOD'S UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EARNED AND NEITHER CAN IT BE LOST. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. TRUE, MAN. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; DEATH IS NOT THE END. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're adopted into God's family. You're a child of God. The Holy Spirit dwells within. He's your helper. You have a comforter. You have a guide. &gt;&gt; The word of God, YOU HAVE IT. TRUTH, DIRECTION, CORRECTION, HOPE. &gt;&gt; That's a lot to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have redemption. You've been bought back and restored. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE GOD'S MERCIES NEW EVERY MORNING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every morning they're fresh as a dew on the ground. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD'S GRACE IS UNMMERITED FAVOR THAT SUSTAINS YOU. YOU HAVE A PEACE THAT PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING. YOU HAVE THE JOY OF THE LORD WHICH NEHEMIAH SAYS IS YOUR STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Strengthen. And you HAVE SO YOU HAVE STRENGTH FOR THE TRIALS. YOU HAVE HOPE IN CHRIST. YOU HAVE A PURPOSE. YOU HAVE A CALLING. WE HAVE SPIRITUAL GIFTS. WE HAVE CHRIST'S INTERCESSION FOR US. WE HAVE THE ARMOR OF GOD. WE HAVE THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT. WE HAVE GOD'S FAITHFULNESS. HE NEVER FAILS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a daily bread. These are all scriptures to back these up. Clothing and shelter. You have God's protection. Psalms 91. You have healing and health. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a lot to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; I I tell you, I when you when when you have children, you realize how how thankful you are to have a healthy child. &gt;&gt; When you see other parents that going through struggles and things with their children because of sicknesses and stuff and the grab bag of life, &gt;&gt; got a lot to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Have work income. There's a lot of people that would beg to have your job. &gt;&gt; Puts a little different perspective on it, don't it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God's guidance. You have God's presence everywhere you go. You have angelic protection. YOU HAVE GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY. EVERY DETAIL OF YOUR LIFE IS under his control. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HAVE THE BODY OF CHRIST, THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You have fellow BELIEVERS AROUND YOU FOR ENCOURAGEMENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You have spiritual leaders. You have family, &gt;&gt; godly families. &gt;&gt; Godly friendships. &gt;&gt; We have not only freedom in a in a in a in a country, you have true freedom in Christ. &gt;&gt; We have victory over our enemy. We have sanctification. We have justification. We have THE HOLY GHOST. NEW IDENTITY IN CHRIST, A CLEAN CONSCIENCE. YOU HAVE BREATH IN YOUR LUNGS. &gt;&gt; Psalms 150. Let everything THAT HAVE BREATH. PRAISE YE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You're you have creation's beauty. You have the mountains, the oceans, the stars. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everybody has preferences. Some people like the mountains. Some people like the oceans. &gt;&gt; But God made it so all of us could enjoy &gt;&gt; laughter and joy in relationships. &gt;&gt; Yes. We have music, &gt;&gt; worship, and praise. &gt;&gt; And I might be biased, but I'm going to say it. We have some of the best music in this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Biased or not. &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for them. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for the gift that a s make a sacrifice. They ain't paid to do what they do. &gt;&gt; These men up there sit up there. the ladies, they ain't paid to be up there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I don't see a line behind them wanting to sign up. &gt;&gt; So, let's be thankful for them. &gt;&gt; Instead of finding every opportunity to be aggravated at them. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister pastor coming out. I'm sorry. WE HAVE REST. WE HAVE SLEEP. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE GOD'S PROVISION IN SMALL THINGS. WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, the scripture says it's better to give than to receive. &gt;&gt; There's a wonderful truth there if YOU REALIZE. IT'S BETTER TO BE IN THE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THAN HAVE TO BE IN the position to have TO RECEIVE. &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S BETTER TO BE IN THE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO SERVE SOMEBODY THAN TO HAVE TO BE WHERE you have to be served. &gt;&gt; Trials that strengthen your faith. Said we to have they're to be joyful things. &gt;&gt; That's right. Awesome. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I don't know about that. That's what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; The promise that God works all things for our good, the blessed hope. And this blessed hope, our Lord, our Savior, our God, our Jesus is coming again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 107 and verse 20 says, "He sent his word and he healed them and delivered them from their destructions." Oh, that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men. AND LET THEM SACRIFICE THE SACRIFICES of thanksgiving AND DECLARE HIS WORKS WITH REJOICING. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, I have a direct responsibility by scripture to give testimony of what God's done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he sent his word and he healed them. So if I know somebody's been healed by the word of God, I have the direct responsibility to go out and to declare his works with rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't get mad at me. I ain't tell I ain't pumping up myself. Ain't no real preacher, no man of God pumping up. BROTHER BRANDON DIDN'T pump up himself. &gt;&gt; HE WAS TELLING THE ACTS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THE DEVIL WANTS TO PUT CLAMPS ON OUR MOUTH. DON'T YOU DARE tell that somebody think you're trying to MAKE YOURSELF SOMEBODY. I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF ANYBODY. I'M MAKING GOD WHO HE IS. I'M MAKING JESUS WHO HE IS. SOMEBODY THAT'S WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE, ALL GLORY, ALL HONOR. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Psalms 116 and verse 16. Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant. I am thy servant and the son of thy handsmade. Thou hast loosed my bonds. Has any bond anybody had that where the Lord loosed your bonds? &gt;&gt; All right. Therefore, I will offer to thee the sacrifice OF THANKSGIVING AND WILL CALL UPON the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what happened in Jonah. Jonah was found himself in the belly of a fish. We can read it in Jonah chapter 2 and verse one. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said, I cried by reason of my infliction unto the Lord and he heard me. out of the belly the out of out of the belly of hail cried I and thou heardest my voice for thou hast cast me in the deep in the midst of the sea and the floods compass me about all thy billows and thy waves pass over me and I then I said I have cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward thy holy temple the waters compass me about even to the soul the depths closed around ABOUT ME THE WEEDS were wrapped ABOUT MY HEAD I WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAINS THE EARTH where their bars were about me forever. Yet hast thou brought upon MY LIFE FROM BROUGHT UP MY LIFE of corruption. Oh Lord my God, WHEN MY SOUL FAINTTH WITHIN ME, I REMEMBER THE LORD, AND MY PRAYER CAME unto thee in thy holy temple. AND THEY THAT OBSERVE LYING BANDIES FORSAKE THEIR OWN MERCY. BUT I WILL SACRIFICE UNTO THEE WITH THE VOICE OF THANKSGIVING &gt;&gt; IN THE BELLY OF A FISH. I DON'T SEE anybody in here today in a belly of a fish. &gt;&gt; I don't see anybody coming to church today in wells vomit or fish vomit. I don't right &gt;&gt; seaweed wrapped around. What's that smell? &gt;&gt; No, you came here in a plush car heated most to most time heated seats. That's right. &gt;&gt; Powered by an engine. &gt;&gt; You didn't have to work at &gt;&gt; barely had to push your foot. &gt;&gt; Kick back listening to maybe some tunes or a message. &gt;&gt; Sit down on a padded pew. &gt;&gt; Didn't have to walk hardly more than 100 yards. Maybe. &gt;&gt; Whoopde-doo. It's the truth, church. We get so &gt;&gt; caught up in our stuff that we don't realize what we really have to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I was talking about that 17 year old boy, pregnant women walking 70 miles. 70 mi, not 70 feet, 70 miles to be in a service. not sit on that seat like you got. &gt;&gt; Maybe not even a seat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But at best just a a little slat of wood. &gt;&gt; It'll Some of us need to travel some more, I think, to some places like that. Then we'll be a lot more thankful. That that trip has never left me. &gt;&gt; And listen, I I went back just a few years ago and it ain't hardly any better. Hello. And we've been enjoying all we got for how many years? &gt;&gt; Come on. I I I'm just be be very very open and very We We We've not We ain't had just one nice church. We've had several nice churches. &gt;&gt; God's blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's abilities to put in men that would give of their sacrifice. And listen, it's God's blessings. There's people that would long to just have a little structure, a little little tin hut to worship their God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have all this. Don't let it become so common. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To where we come and it's just a ritual anymore. That's that's where where where where sacrifices became actually became a profane thing in God's nostrils. And if you look up that profane, it actually means it became so common &gt;&gt; to them that they didn't really put the effort anymore. So they they just brought whatever they could get and they just brought the the just whatever lamb they could find. They they just brought whatever. It's just maim and the halt and the stinking and the that wasn't what God required. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we'll do the same thing. &gt;&gt; Just like Israel, we might not bring a physical lamb, but we'll bring our stinking attitudes and we'll bring this and that and everything else. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Don't get nothing out of church. And we're sitting in one one of the GREATEST PLACES EVER UNDER one of the greatest ministries. I I'm just being honest. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WOULD LONG TO be where we're at in this seat. I'm not I'm not trying to say anything out of order. I'm just trying to LET YOU KNOW YOU GOT A LOT TO BE THANKFUL FOR. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13 and verse 15 says, "By him therefore let us offer offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually." &gt;&gt; Uh oh. So, in other words, it's not seasonal &gt;&gt; or optional &gt;&gt; a command. It's not It's not like I said, it's not a season of say, "Well, I'm in the season of life, so I I just don't feel it." No, that's the time to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not whether you feel it or you don't feel it, but in SPITE OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES, STANCES AND FEELINGS AND PROBLEMS, I'M GOING TO CONTINUALLY THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE. I'M going to continually thank him for his love and his FAVOR AND HIS MERCY. I'M GOING TO THANK HIM THAT HE NOT ONLY GAVE ME CHILDREN, BUT HE GAVE ME CHILDREN THAT BELIEVE HIM, that worship HIM, THAT WANT TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE. I'M NOT GOING TO JUST THANK HIM FOR JUST A CHURCH. I'M GOING TO THANK HIM THAT HE GAVE ME A GOOD CHURCH AND A GOOD PASTOR AND GOOD MINISTRY. NOT JUST GOOD MINISTRY, BUT GOOD WORSHIP AND AND GOOD SINGING AND GOOD SAINTS AND GOOD musicians &gt;&gt; and good MEN AND WOMEN SITTING BESIDE ME HELPING ME IN MY TROUBLE, HELPING ME IN MY PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Daniel found himself in a spot one time in Daniel 6 and verse 10 said he kne said he kneel on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks to his God. He was under political attack. &gt;&gt; His life was in danger. &gt;&gt; When obedience, if he obeyed, if he obedience was going to carry a cost. &gt;&gt; But before deliverance came, Daniel trusted God enough to thank him before the miracle ever took place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus took loaves and and when he when he had held them, he'd give thanks. didn't look like much. &gt;&gt; He gave thanks before the multiplic multiplication happened. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Thank you, Father, for you fed the 5,000 when we have 12 baskets left over." He gave thanks while he was holding two fish and five loaves of bread. When you give thanks for what you have, even if what you have seems so little, you must remember you serve a God who multiplies. &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 16 and verse 25, we find Paul and Silas. It was their thanksgiving that unlocked a breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you look into that, I've studied on it, preached on it before. IT'S ACTUALLY THE PASSOVER PSALMS, WHICH is Psalms 113 through 118 and 136. It's actually seven psalms designated for the Passover. I think that's wonderful because there's seven church ages. God just don't leave anything out. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the very first thing, put up, put up real quick Psalms 113. Could you I just want to set the scene again because one of my favorite stories. Here they are in pain, in chains, in darkness without knowing what God would even do. &gt;&gt; Praise ye [screaming] the Lord. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that. Oh man, we could have a praise shouting service after the sickness is gone and the answers are made and all this. NO, THIS WAS BEFORE ANY OF THAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; PRAISE YE THE LORD. PRAISE OH YOU SERVANTS OF THE LORD all the way down through 113. Amen. NEXT VERSE. PRAISE. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVER MORE. FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN UNTO THE GOING DOWN OF THE SAME. THE LORD'S NAME IS to be praised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stop there for JUST A MOMENT. THE LORD'S NAME IS TO BE PRAISED. HE didn't say when you get up in the morning and it just goes all good and everything's lovely and everything's hunkador and there's no problems and there no situation the sun goes down. Praise ye the Lord. HE SAID FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN TO THE GOING DOWN. &gt;&gt; He didn't dictate ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN BETWEEN. BUT WHAT HE DID DICTATE FROM THE RISING [screaming] OF THE SUN TO THE GOING DOWN. HIS NAME IS TO be praised. &gt;&gt; Next verse. The Lord is high above all the nations. His glory above all the heavens. Who is like unto the Lord our God who dwelleth upon high? Who humble himself to behold the things that are in heaven and are on earth. &gt;&gt; He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts the needy out of the dungill. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That he may set him with princes, even the princes of his people. He maketh THE BARREN WOMAN TO KEEP HOUSE AND TO BE A JOYFUL mother of children. Praise ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. YOU MAY BE THE POOREST OF THE POOR, BUT HE'LL TAKE WHAT YOU HAVE AND HE'LL MAKE IT WORK IN YOUR BEHALF. &gt;&gt; SO IN PAIN AND DARKNESS, THEY RESPONDED WITH PRAISE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Before there was an earthquake, before open doors happened, before broken chains came, before salvation for a household, thankful faith shakes spiritual prisons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thankful faith is praising before the answer ever comes. &gt;&gt; It's trusting God when everything is uncertain. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's expressing gratitude continually. It's seeing trials through the lenses of God's goodness. &gt;&gt; It's believing that every situation is under God's care. &gt;&gt; Thankful faith is not a feeling. It's a declaration of trust. Brother Brandon would actually preach a Thanksgiving message here in Streetport, Louisiana. I go listen to it. Invisible Union of the bride. He said, "I have a little title with a few remarks I want to make in some scriptures, Lord willing, to a Thanksgiving message, the invisible union of the bride of Christ." The invisible union of the bride of Christ. It doesn't sound like a thanksgiving message though the scriptures were are thankful for all of it. He said I'm thankful to God to be living in this time of the closing scenes of this world's history. I don't know if I ever had would had a say a say so before the foundation of the world and God would have laid out the whole program to me and said I want you to preach now. What age do you desire to go to the earth and preach? I would have chose this age. I think this is the golden age. Amen. &gt;&gt; I certainly would have loved to been there during the time of his visit to earth, but I still think I would. This right now is a greater time because it's a time that he's coming to take the people he redeemed and he's nearing the resurrection when all the redeemed will come forth. &gt;&gt; WHAT A GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY we have today to speak to a dying people. IT'S A GREAT TIME AND we are enthused about it. We know that history IS CLOSING OUT. THE WORLD'S HISTORY will soon BE OVER. THEN WE'RE GOING TO STEP INTO A NEW DAY, the great millennium. That is one believer. I believe in a millennium, a millennium reign WITH CHRIST, A THOUSAND YEARS upon the earth, a physical return of the Lord JESUS TO TAKE A PHYSICAL PEOPLE GLORIFIED BY HIS cleansing blood. Well, LET ME TELL YOU THAT RIGHT THERE ENOUGH IS TO ME A THANKSGIVING MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he don't end it right there. He goes through so many wonderful thing. I ain't got time. But he goes into how your husband you were first married to was divorced and done away with and now you've been put on the unmmerited favor of almighty grace of almighty God. Put a wedding band upon your finger. And he goes into justified as though you never done it in the first place. You're talking about a thanksgiving. He says you're thou standing completely. You never sin. It's in the sea of God's for forgetfulness. You never did it. You were accused of it from the beginning, but you were predestinated at the beginning to be a son or daughter of God. And now you're standing washed absolutely out of the existence now even of the mind of God. YOU'RE THE VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF CHRIST WASHED IN THE BLOOD of Christ, precious, virtuous, SINLESS SON OF GOD, STANDING WITH A PURE UNDULATE. APPARENTLY, they didn't hear the same message I heard. &gt;&gt; Because of my understanding of history, they wasn't very thankful for that message right there. &gt;&gt; But I'm thankful. I'm thankful that a man would stand in front of his peers and declare the gospel, &gt;&gt; the message &gt;&gt; and tell me who I am in the face of adversity, in the face of men that wasn't even agreeing with him, that was actually pulling away from him. In the face of it all, he was still I'm thankful for a man like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; mercy. &gt;&gt; We just end it with this. It's [snorts] a prayer. So wonderful. The Jehovah miracles. Heavenly Father, our hearts are so happy tonight. Oh, we just feel like we could just take off. It seems like you just raised us back the roof of this old building. We'd go home tonight knowing that the great name of the Lord Jesus, that magnificent name, that precious name, a name that is above all names, a name that even in heaven they bow to. Everything on earth will bow to it. Oh God, every devil will bow to it and recognize it. You give that name to us. &gt;&gt; Ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it. Oh Lord God, who made the promise through your son Jesus, let the name of Jesus Christ tonight, set every sick person free, set every sinner free, set every person free. May this be a free meeting right now that the Holy Ghost can come in and move and give glory and praise to God. Granted, Lord, WE ARE YOUR PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT UNDER ANY BONDAGE. We are free. THE SON HAS MADE US FREE. THEREFORE, WE'RE FREE INDEED to serve our LORD AND OUR FATHER. WE THANK YOU. YOU TALKING ABOUT A THANKSGIVING DAY FOR FREEDOM. WE GOT A REAL THANKSGIVING DAY. EVERY HOUR OF A BELIEVER IS A THANKSGIVING DAY. &gt;&gt; I WHO WAS ONCE BLIND CAN NOW SEE. I WHO WAS ONCE A SINNER AM NOW SAVED. OH GOD, HOW FREE WE ARE. HOW WE GIVE YOU THANKSGIVING. THANKSGIVING FROM MY HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD, IS NOT DEAD, BUT HE'S ALIVE AND HE'S WITH US TONIGHT. AND HE'S POURING OUT HIS HOLY GHOST UPON THE CHURCH IN THE LAST [cheering and applause] DAYS. WOO! JUST BEFORE HIS APPEARANCE AND SIGNS AND WONDERS ARE EVERYWHERE, MARVELOUS THINGS. AND THE GOD OF HEAVEN, OH HALLELUJAH, GIVING PRAISE TO THE GLORY TO GOD. HOW WE THANK YOU FOR THESE THINGS. IT'S A REAL THANKSGIVING IN OUR HEART. RECEIVE THE PRAISES of your people, Lord. &gt;&gt; RECEIVE THE PRAISES OF YOUR PEOPLE, LORD. WE LOVE YOU. WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE AND YOU ARE A reorder of those who diligently seek you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, I realize in another place he said it's their own personal faith. The minute they believed you, that's the minute you received them. &gt;&gt; Oh my, that's a lot to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Didn't have to crawl up miles of cobblestone. &gt;&gt; Just had to believe him. You said, "No man can come unto me unless my father draws him and all that comes, I will give him everlasting life and will raise him up at the last day." That's your word, Lord. We believe it and it's done. &gt;&gt; The work is finished. And we thank you. We thank you for it. We thank you for the healing of everybody, for every weary soul, for everything that's here. Those who had feeble hands hanging down. Those who have been fearful. Those who have wondered. David said, "When I was afraid and got scared, I trusted in you and I walked on." God, let us stick our head up this morning. Not cowards, but Christians who believe in Jesus Christ. May we walk with our testimony shining, made through the healing of our bodies, through the testimony of our salvation. May we win under win others to thee. Granted, Lord, all that on the altar we've laid, granted for your glory. We believe you. We wait on you. We're just bathing in your beauty. Just bathing in your promise. Feeling the glorious Holy Spirit. Wooing to us. Wooing us to thee. How we love you. How we praise you. How I worship you, Lord, myself here behind this sacred desk with my hands up to thee.

You're my strength. DAVID SAID, "I WILL PRAISE YOU BEFORE THE CONGREGATION OF SAINTS. I WILL GIVE THEE PRAISE BEFORE THE SANCTU SANCTIFIED ONES THIS MORNING. I PRAISE THEE FOR HEALING ME. I PRAISE YOU FOR MY LIFE. I PRAISE YOU FOR MY HEALTH. I PRAISE YOU FOR THE GOODNESS YOU'VE SHOWED TO ME. I PRAISE YOU FOR MY FRIENDS. I PRAISE YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

And we'll receive the very adoration of our heart expressed from our lips, Lord, that from the depths of this pure heart, we'll praise you knowing that's not what we could do. It's not our life. It's your life. It's not our salvation, it's your salvation. It's not our heaven, it's your heaven. We're not our own. We are yours.

Bless our hearts and receive us. Oh God, he says, "Send little Brandham Tabernacle and outpouring of the spirit."

Pour out the rain of Notice how much he praised him before he requested. &gt;&gt; We want to request him and get the answer and then praise him.

I'm going to glorify you."
