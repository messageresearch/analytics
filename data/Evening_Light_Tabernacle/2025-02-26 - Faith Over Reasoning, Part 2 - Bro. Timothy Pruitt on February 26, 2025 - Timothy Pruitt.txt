father we just ask you once again to come and Minister our hearts touch Our Lives Lord by your word mercy and Grace be upon us Lord this evening ask Lord you just come and touch each life father by your presence we commit this time to you everything to be said and done for your glory in Jesus name amen amen you turn to Romans chapter 8 amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord God is so good not only is he good he's good all the time amen hallelujah it's more than just a a saying or a cliche it's a it's the truth amen that no matter what you're going through matter of fact you can read in Romans 8 that all things work together for the good amen so whatever you're going through tonight or today he's he's good amen and he's mindful of our needs Romans 8 and verse 6 it says for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity or in other words at war against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be amen we let you be seated just want to continue with a thought on faith over reasoning we spoke on last Wednesday uh just looking at this thought and I I loved a lot of what the things that brother Nathan brought on Sunday Kind of along these same lines about the ridiculous because God to the carnal mind is ridiculous uh to you know the carnal mind has wared with it for thousands of years over if there even is a God and and and and argue different thoughts and philosophies and different things but amen we know it takes Faith to believe in him and to believe his word and and to believe what he said is going to come to pass and we know that reasoning is brother brandwood said it like this he said reason is what started the ball of sin rolling in the first place reasoning what reasoning against the word of God so it wasn't just taking a thought and thinking about it as we do thing you know we think about maybe what we going to wear today or we reason all of that out or we think about that's not what we're talking about but reasoning that we're talking about is this enmity or this war against God and his word and there reasoning against the word of God and when God told Adam and Eve that day you eat thereof that day you die that settled it that should have been all to it and he fortified them against the enemy because he told them his word he said if you do this this is what's going to happen so so if they would have took him at his word they would have never a mean they would have never come to the place that they they that they came to and cuz he fored fortified them with his word but Eve by listening to Satan's reason and he said you know seek cult culture and understanding and the education and advancement she stepped behind out from behind the word and started listening to what Satan had to say and she did the very thing that God said don't do and if one reasoning or listening to One Reason against the word caused all this chaos one reason against the word again won't take you back to the place they were before they fell and so because how foolish it would be for God to bring back man Amen to the same place on the same basis he sent him out from he said it's got to be because you come by the shed blood of Jesus Christ amen our denominations our Creeds our reasonings amen it's the blood it's the birth it's the what produces you in you the new creature Christ after the fashion of Christ you live because the toxin that you take shows it kills the sin of unbelief against anything but the word of God Amen amen I I I'm thankful for that toxin tonight amen the word that or the blood that can come into your life amen and kill everything that has anything against the word of God Amen that's your nature your sinful nature your flesh amen I I just want to I was going to leave this out but I I this fits in really good here I I just want to read a different translation for a moment of Romans 8 it says now there is now no condemnation to those who belong to Christ Jesus how many belong to him to tonight and because you belong to him the power of that lifegiving Spirit has freed you freed you from the power of sin that leads to death amen so it's freed you he said the law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature so God did what the law could not do he sent his own son in a body like the bodies we have and in that body God declared an end to sin's control over Us by giving his son as a sacrifice for our sins he did this so that just requirement of the law may be fully satisfied for us who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead we follow after the spirit this is Romans 8 those those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things amen those that are dominated by a sinful nature think about sinful things but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit thinks about those things which pleases the spirit so letting your sinful nature control your mind that leads to death but letting the spirit control your mind that leads you to life and peace amen for the sinful nature is always hostile or at war with God Amen it never did obey God's laws and it never will that's why those who were under who are still under the control of their sinful nature will never please God Amen will never please God God and if you and but you are not controlled by your sinful nature you're controlled by the spirit if you have the spirit of God living on the inside of you I love how it just simply puts it amen and remember that those things who do those who do not have the spirit of Christ Living in them do not belong to him at all and Christ lives live lives lives within you so even though your body will die because of sin the spirit will give you life because you've been made right with God the spirit of God who raised up Jesus from the dead lives in you and just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead he will give life to your mortal bodies by The Same Spirit living within you therefore dear brothers and sisters we have no obligation to do what your sinful nature urges you to do Hallelujah aren't you glad to not be under obligation to sinful nature no more amen we are not under obligation to do what your sinful nature urges you to do for if you live by its dictates you will die but through the power of the spirit you put the death the Deeds of your sinful nature you will live for all who are led by the spirit of God are the children of God so you have not receive the spirit that makes you fearful slaves come on now you are you have not received the spirit that makes you fearful slaves instead you receive God's spirit when he adopted you as his own children amen you received God's spirit when he adopted you as his own children now we call him Abba Father for his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we're God's children and since we are his children we are his hirs in fact together with Christ we're Heirs of God's glory but if we are sh to share his glory we will also share in his suffering amen but it's showing very clearly amen men to have Amen to not have this sinful nature controlling you and controlling your thoughts and controlling your mind there must be a death to sinful nature there must be a death to sinful man so the spirit of God can live inside of you I believe that's what we all want amen that's what we all desire amen that God's spirit makes the dictations of our life amen a man you know that's in Christ Jesus walks or desires spiritual things amen the world to the world it's a in it's carnal mind it's a spiritual things are foolishness they're crazy as we heard on Sunday they're ridiculous but to those that believe them they're everlasting life how many how many believes in Supernatural things to those that believe them they are everlasting life you know as we go along this thought of foolishness or and kind of build a little bit on what brother Nathan was even speaking about on ridiculous when God told Noah to build an ark and Noah was out there building away on this Ark and sitting out in the middle of a big dry field and it would not been one drop of rain that had fell out of Heaven never been anything out of the heavens as rain never been a cloud in the sky yet Noah out there building away on the ark could you imagine how silly that looked could you imagine why the carnal mind that to the carnal mind that man was insane he had lost his mind he had as we say fell off his Rock yeah he he he he's done went he's he's he's drank something he he's done something he's crazy that's what they call he's crazy he said brother I could hear people coming on from work and they'd hear a hammer nailing the Ray on that Ark and say you really believe in that rain story they're telling out there what do you think about that old crank over there that's nailing away on that Ark why why he's the craziest guy you ever seen out there building away on the ark and that water's going to fall from Heaven that man's crazy there's nothing up there God 's always watered it a different way down here upon the Earth there's no such a thing as rain but God told him that so he can make him a way of Escape amen he put his word there for his protection and as long as he stayed with his word he was going to live amen amen as it was in the days of Noah so it will be in the coming of the son of man this is red letter words amen so if that's going to be so there's going to be a program on Earth that will seem crazy to a lot of people that's right they're going to think you're crazy for walking a certain way or living a certain way or dressing a certain way or having a certain mindset they're going to say you're crazy you lost your mind but it was God's program then it's God's program now and he said those same people will still be just building away on the ark that Ark is now Jesus Christ he amen amen people think you're crazy for even going to church on a Wednesday night I mean you doing on Sunday I we and I to give I go to my church on Sunday why you got or some people think you crazy for driving more than 10 minutes yeah don't tell me I know they do they think you're nuts you know when God told Moses to speak to the Rock how foolish did that sound how crazy I mean not even the he told a said a rock one of the driest places there is and it was not only a dry rock it was laying in a dried desert amen we we Moses we there's no water around what do you mean speak to a rock that's the way they think they thought well this a bunch of craziness bunch of Fanatics if God's going to do something dry as places look like he would find a place that maybe had a hint of water but that ain't the way God works amen The Rock brought the waters anyway and it saved a perishing people that's right amen why because they stayed with the word sir amen and today that rock of je is Jesus Christ he has been smitten for you and you can also speak to him maybe you've been somewhere and things have not went right but you can today speak to the Rock and it'll bring forth Waters of Salvation it'll bring forth Waters of healing it'll bring forth Waters of deliver if you'll just speak to the Rock so well it sounds ridiculous but it's true it sounds crazy but it's real it's reality you know when Ahab and Jehoshaphat you know they was in need of water and they went to find the prophet you know they got in trouble Ahab ain't wanted to hear what the prophet said but he got in trouble then that's when he wants to hear what the prophet got to say a lot of people's that way you know they're okay as long as everything's okay but once it goes wrong then they want to see a preacher they want to see a church they want to see somebody Amen to give them a little Comfort but when they got to their comfort he wasn't too comfortable he was angry he was mad he he why you coming to me for anyhow why are you going to come now you you You' you've got 400 prophets down there why don't you go ask them and he said the prophet of God In Our Generation said his righteous indignation was up he's a little angry a little little tiff that morning wasn't happy wasn't in a good mood so you know he said well you going to have to we got to change the atmosphere bring me a minstral and and so he brings a minr and begins to play and he got in the spirit of God and when the spirit of God begin to move God begin to show him some things he said that's way it is you have to get into a spirit if you want to see something amen what good does it do to come to church if we're not going to get in the spirit of it if you want God to show you something tonight get in the spirit of it amen we sing the songs we Rejoice we we felt his presence so amen God ought to start showing somebody something if they'll get into the spirit of it and allow God to move through their lives the first thing you know when he got up in the spirit all of a sudden he raised his hands and he said thus sayth the Lord I want you to go dig a whole valley full of ditches what oh what valley that right out there in that desert Elisha I I came to get water amen but what happened they had enough sense to listen to what the prophet said yeah and they went and be to dig amen he said because if you dig the more the ditches that you dig will be filled by water in the morning so if they stayed with the word then they was going to get their Deliverance but if they had just reasoned about it and say well this is nuts I mean I I've heard of a lot of things but I we got all kind of wells around around here we got other but out in the desert he's lost his mind and I'm going to dig a hole that's going to be F how is it going to be fil it ain't up to me how it's going to be filled it ain't up to me how it's going to happen it ain't up to me how it's going to come to pass it's up to me to follow the word it's up to me to do exactly what he said do that's right it looks ridiculous to the carnal mind well Elisha surely if you want get some water surely you could tell us maybe a little better place to drill somewhere got a little Machinery we can come and get maybe up down close to a pump somewhere no go right out there in that desert cuz what was God trying to show them this ain't got nothing to do with you I'm the one that's going to produ you come asking me for water I'm going to produce the water all you got to do is dig a few ditches amen you don't have to produce the miracle all you got to do is prepare for it amen it ain't up to you to produce it it ain't up to you to bring it to pass it's up to you to prepare for it yes and say God said it I'm going to dig a ditch and you'll get to digging sometimes and there'll be all kinds of stuff in there to try to stop you he said he said there'd be some 10 cans down in there that'll rattle around and say days of Miracles are passed or God don't operate like that no more kinds of things reason is that try to come up he said what you need to do is get your shovel and get that tin can out and throw it out of the ditch come on somebody how many of us have had the same old tin cans we hit against service after service or time after time but tonight I got the shovel of the Holy Ghost and he's commissioned me to dig a ditch and where I dig he's going to feel it where I dig he going to come with his blessings that's right Hallelujah I'm doing what the prophet said tonight I got my shovel and I'm digging ditches I'm digging enough for healing I'm digging enough for Joy I'm digging enough for the Holy Ghost I'm digging enough for somebody to get [Applause] saved and he said after a while you're going to hit a rock down there what rock the same rock that they spoke to had been covered up by theologies had been covered up with sands of time and it seemed like it wouldn't happen no more and just a miracle we talk about or a miracle we used to see but all the problem was we got to get the the unbelief out of the way that's right come on church it's what we're going to do tonight we're going to get their unbelief out of the way and those Sands of Time those Sands that wants to blow in and say God doesn't still give babies to those who are who can't have babies God doesn't he doesn't heal those that are so sick and incurable amen we're going to dig all that out all those 10 cans we keep bumping up against and says hey you you know you prayed for this one and and they got sick and died you pray for that it doesn't matter we're digging it out cuz I know down below all that unbelief is the Rock of Ages and if I can ever get to that rock water spring out of it [Applause] he said we need to dig down enough so we can get us an old rock down there he said because they got those rocks out and they took those rocks and they went and stopped up the enemy's Wells come on now that enemy's been stopping up your well it's time you dig down enough to get something to stop up his that'll shut his mouth up he been blowing hard at you and saying all kinds of things you'll never make it you this message ain't for you it's impossible you'll never get healed you'll never have a baby you'll never get delivered you'll never have this you'll never never never never I'll tell you what I will do I'll do what the word said I want to dig until I find the Rock of Ages and I'm going to grab that rock and I bring it into your house Satan and I'm going to plug your well up this is why you got to testify and thank God for all the things he done why is it we constantly rehearse over in our mind what he did for sister l or what he did for this one or what he did for somebody in another church why do we do that cuz it's a rock it's a rock of testimony don't you dare let the devil blow sands over it lay aside every weight and sin that's so easily beset you what sin unbelief that little thing that says it can't be done that little thing that says my well my doctor says this or that doctor may be right as far as he knows but God said different if thou cast believe all things are possible throw that out of the way then give a chance for the Holy Ghost to make his way down through the building tonight no matter what you've done though your sins be like Scarlet they can be made white like snow make a way for dig the ditches dig the ditches the next morning God moved in and filled all the ditches and they each one had got water the other alien Army was pursuing run down they took rocks in their hands went over to them enemies stopped up all their Wells wasn't that a wonderful Victory not only won all the victory but stopped up the wells them old stagnated ponds they was drinking in anyhow what we need tonight is a people somebody that'll dig down deep enough get a little salvation in the the soul get a victory down in there get healed there get saved get filled with the Holy Ghost and stop the mouth of some critic that says days of Miracles are passed throw the stone of faith into it and stop That Thing Up Just prayed for another young lady with alipa you know what gave me Faith to pray for her is because God gave us a stone right sure I mean yeah I gave me I got faith to believe his word that's not what I'm saying but I mean to have that stone that testimony and to tell her hey you're not the first person with this disease that's right and God healed It Before He'll heal it again that's why we keep lifting sister Atlanta's testimony up cuz cancer is a very prevalent thing apparently in the day that we're living in amen why it's showing God did it before God to do it again again that's why we keep lifting brother Justin's testimony up amen of a prodical son that came back if God did it before God will do it again amen that's why we always lift up the it's not about Lifting me up or lifting brother Tim up we didn't do it anyhow that's right but we did prepare for it we did preach the word of faith we did preach God the same yesterday today and forever we did preach he still heals he's still saved he still brings a prodal we still preach it we will always preach it Hallelujah we prepared for it but somebody dug Hallelujah Abraham was fully persuaded that God was able to keep that which he promised if God makes a promise got to keep that promise being fully persuaded that he that he would would do what he said he was able to perform God keeps his promises no matter how ridiculous it may have looked to the carnal mind it looked all right to Abraham cuz Abraham never looked so much as what the promise was or how ridiculous it was he looked at who gave the promise that's a big key right there hey man if it's your government giving the promise hey I I ain't got no problem with you doubting it you know some politician gave you the promise I ain't got no problem with you doubting it even if a if a preacher made the promise preacher is a man he can fall he can fail right might have reason to doubt it but we ain't the one who made the promise I preach it but I ain't the one who made it I speak it but I ain't the one who said it you understand what I'm saying I ain't the one who declared it in the beginning he said it come on now I mean if y'all can't see that even the songs were lined up tonight I don't know what to tell you stop reasoning about it just go ahead and believe it God's in this service and God's going to do something amazing yes sir I believe Hallelujah he said it he said it he said it in his word he declared it was there all I am is a microphone saying it yes when he told the disciples to let down the net and take up for the drought or for the big catch they've been fishing they were fishermen they had this figured out from a long time ago it was foolish uh hello there's no fish there I got my lives scop they didn't even have Liv Scopes in that day but they they knew enough about fishing they done fished it but you just know it's kind of funny how Technologies Advance kind of along with the reasonings yeah and unbelief you know today we got what's called a Liv scope it's incredible you can actually go up to a a bush somewhere find this bush in the middle of the lake with this livescope it show you all the branches it'll show you all the little limbs coming out it'll show you the fish swimming around it and then you can drop your little bait down in there and it'll show you drop it right down on that fish's nose now you can't make that fish bite of course that fish got his own mind but if you just twitch it a little bit and if he's hungry enough he going and you'll see it grab it and then you'll feel it pull it and then you'll pull that fish up well that's quite a deal ain't it that's the way we we want our religion we want to see it we see the problem we see the issue we see the devil sitting there we see all these things and we know exactly how to go around this way or going we ain't got that ability amen we don't have that ability all we can do in this hour is depend on what he said and I don't mean to say that in some kind of light manner amen that's a lot there it ain't just all we got it's it's everything we have amen it's to depend on what he has said and if he said it he's going to bring it to pass well there's no fish there but God had put fish there for his word spoke it there what they failed to realize is when he said put down your net for the drought that was a creative Force hello can we we enough faith in the building to believe for that right now it was a creative force that spoke and they didn't realize by the time they' taken up the net before and he spoke there was fish created there and not just one fish come on somebody not just two not just 10 enough to sink their boat I love how it said Sunday he's the god of the ridiculous and me not would he just give them enough for their food or for a meal he gave them more than enough he was showing them Jehovah Gyra is standing in front of you and I have the creative word and I speak it and it comes to pass but nevertheless thankfully had somebody had enough reason or sense or mind or faith whatever whatever it was that said nevertheless at your word we're going to cast it down I mean to me looking at it it doesn't sound real faith faith building sentence God I believe you you said it I'm going to throw it down well nevertheless at Thy word see even in your doubt God has still come through if you'll just do what he said to do and you may not can fully comprehend it you may not can fully put it all the numbers together and make it all add up but if you'll just do what he said you to do God will fulfill his word sometimes God's way are so hard for the human mind to comprehend you just think that it's ridiculous faith is ridiculous to the carnal mind it's crazy to anything except God and the one who has the faith that's one of my favorite quotes it's crazy to anyone except God and to the one who has the faith then by faith we see we believe things that are with our eyes our mind does not declare just because but we believe it anyhow reasoning well it would never reason to be right so we can't reason it out study it out we can't just it'll just only muddle our minds up more hello does that not happen to anybody I don't know about maybe I just speak for myself I when I get to thinking about eternity you talking about muddling your mind up trying to get to the end of Eternity that's what our human abilities are we got you know we got the end of something it's the end of the service coming up it's the end of the month coming up it's the end of that ain't no end so this mind cannot comprehend that and if you're not careful all of a sudden you'll realize I'm doubting it trying to reason it all out and figure it all out all I know is I want to be there there you go I mean men have searched for the Fountain of Youth we've read about in the history books we we've read about great uh great men that have searched all over for the Fountain of Youth and they wanted the Fountain of Youth and still live in this world could you imagine somebody that was live that had founded somehow in in the 1600s and was still living to David because they took some mystical drink boy they said man I messed up but think about it that we're not going to be living in these bodies or in this world come on I don't know about you but I wouldn't mind 10 minutes without anxiety or just 10 minutes without fear can you imagine what it's going to be like when fear and anxiety and all of that's gone forever Hallelujah can you imagine we would not have another prayer request for somebody with cancer or somebody's son that's W away Somebody's Daughter that's went out we'll never have that again nothing but perfect love and peace Hallelujah I don't know about you but I plan on and living there I am looking forward to it even though I can't explain it I want to be there I would miss it for the world some of y'all catch that Monday or somewhere reasoning well just figure this out you look think about it we got and it just muddles everything up listen there's some things in our mind that'll never be fixed until we get over there there's some questions that'll never be answered till you get over there we want qu we want questions answered right you know we're we're in a a time of right away kind of mentality we yeah if we can't come up with it by talking to brother Joe or brother Aon and Google it we got to have answers Google it got to have knowledge Google it and it's under this mentality constant force of knowledge and thoughts and thinking and we're thinking about this and we're thinking about we think about stuff in 10 minutes most people didn't think about in 10 hours it's the way our mind and our our our our our our our world that we live in is so Advanced that people used to enjoy just sitting out on the porch for a little bit or going out and tending their cows or cabbage or whatever they was doing and that's all their mind was on their mind was not on somebody even five miles generally away from them unless they heard about some trouble or or something they definitely wasn't thinking about anything going on around the world exactly but today in five minutes of getting up and drinking your coffee you can get this news update that news update this over here and that over here and this over and we're all stirred up and worried well how is this all going to happen how is this all going to take place ah I thought I thought that woman was going to I thought Trump he's going I thought what are you worried about it for why don't you just start singing the song this world is not my home yeah I'm just passing through that's it my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue the Angels beckon me come on now but our minds are so tore up because we're thinking he says well we're we're living in a modern time he said keep that out of your mind wow that one kind of struck me today we're living in a modern time keep that out of your mind don't even take the second thought thought well how could this be how the just take him at his word that's what God says got to keep it it's not my business to figure it out because if I do I'm working then in intellectual Realms and God doesn't move in the head he moves in the heart we get so many things in our mind and we want questions answered right away and there's going to be some questions I said won't be answered till we get on the other side but there's a quote in Mother's Day that I I listen to and I look at a lot brother Brown talks about one day he said we're going to be sitting there and those tender hand of Jehovah will come by with those tender hands and he'll unravel all the knots in our mind why didn't this happen why ain't I been able to do this why ain't this went down the way I thought it would why ain't that God's Got A Plan do you trust in his plan or you're not trust in his plan the carnal mind doesn't get it but where the carnal mind lacks the spiritual mind can pick it up it can pick up the word of God it's what he said he said be not conformed to the world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind what is the renewing of your mind 1 Corinthians 2 and6 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not hello their wisdom that they thought they had everything figured out it's nothing today is what he's saying and we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which is none which none of the princes of this world knew for had they have known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory so their reasonings crucified the Lord Of Glory their wisdom and their thoughts actually brought forth the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ and so it's happening today men's reasonings towards the word and towards the things of God is actually crucifying Christ again he said but none of the princes would have knew for had they known they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard you want to think about eternity think about this eyes have not seen nor ears heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him did you tell did you see where he put that he put it in the heart of man he didn't saying the mind of man he said the heart of man he said so the things that are re already up there and look and waiting on us that eyes have not seen nor ears have heard have not even been fully understood by a spiritual Heart by the heart of man much less the mind of man but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God but now we have receive not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that we are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in the words of man's Wisdom teach us but with the Holy Ghost teach us comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are not are they foolish unto him neither can he know them because because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is Judge of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen so be transformed by the renewing of your mind let the mind of Christ take over and you can only let the mind of Christ taken over by having the spirit of Christ God is so easily though to be misunderstood by unbelievers by those who can't understand or maybe don't even want to understand many people try to understand but many don't even want to they just shut themselves up and say well there's no such a thing I don't believe in such that then then they'll never understand it but a man that's willing to understand that's willing to sit down Bible says come let us reason together now that man is on the line of learning something from the Lord but people who are always associated with God and God's power you can hardly be associated with god without being associated with his power because when you're associated with him you're acquainted to him or you're a relative of him then you have his power in you that's the reason reason that people cannot believe in miracles today because they don't have anything in them to believe with well we're not in the season of Miracles no you're in the season of not believing you're in the season of doubts you're in the season of not being filled with the Holy Ghost that's what he said you're in the season of not being filled with the Holy Ghost cuz you can only know him by a spiritual understanding ing you can hardly be Associated I love that without with god without being associated with his power that's the reason people cannot believe in miracles because they don't have anything to believe with they haven't got something here to believe with and when the spirit of God is in a man he'll say Amen to every word of God and every miracle of God hello but as my mother used to say you can't get blood from a turnup because there's no blood in it that's the same way you can't get belief of unbeliever that's just what he is he's an unbeliever is what he said a man came to us I don't believe in Divine Healing no matter what you say certainly is not for you right I could try I could show you every case that's ever been done and you still wouldn't believe how many miracles did they did Jesus do and they still wouldn't believe him what what calls them their unbelief reasoning well I mean you know hey you know if this this was this can't be God God wouldn't come in a a form of a man he's holy he's righteous he's he wouldn't come we know where he was born I mean he was born in a did you hear he was born in a cattle stall there's no way God would come that way these people are lost their minds they're crazy if God would have come he would have rolled out the carpet and red carpet purple carpet some kind of carpet and come right down into Caiaphas High Temple and said here I am that ain't the way God come and he was misunderstood he was missed because God why man was looking at him with his own intellectual understanding when when when when Nicodemus come to him he tried he he was trying to understand but then Jesus said a man must be born again what did he go to to his intellectual understanding well I mean you mean he's got to go back in his mother's womb and go through all that again this don't make sense intellectual understanding trying to make it all add up trying to make it all just figure it all out get all the ones together and all the twos together and all the threes together you know I'm I I'm just going to put this out I'm sorry if somebody here is like that but I have a hard time with people that's got to have all those things all dotted and put together and everything's got to be perfect I see smes happening already God bless you takes all kinds to make the world go around got to have it all figured out what they call it ad HD or something OCD lld DS or something phds got to have it all just perfect there's Deliverance for that too they got to have it all just right they got to have it all you know if one little picture is off a little bit just drives them crazy I know there's I don't even know why I'm on this line but there's some of y'all that look at this platform and all you see is what's wrong with it instead of what's being right with it that's what I'm trying to say Amen people get so in their minds about and that's where Satan gets them all muddled up he wants to point out all the negativ ity and all the wrong and all this and this is out of order and that's this that the other and he gets them all mled up and the meanwhile Jesus is walking through the room oh man that's right and they get all tore up cuz he didn't come like he thought he was going to come and he didn't do what he thought they thought he said he was going to do he was going to Deliver Us from the Romans that's what he said he was going to do and meanwhile that ain't why he came he came to deliver him from the power of sin and death it was a greater death than the Romans could ever give them [Applause] and if it was a greater death that he delivered him from it was a greater [Applause] Victory and he could ever do by delivering them from some Romans because listen he could have delivered them from the Romans and he could have died and went away and it have been somebody else that rose up it wasn't about being delivered from Romans it's about being delivered from sin and death and being able to put his own life into somebody so they could also know what it's like to be able to walk above it to be able to talk above it to be able to live above sin and death people are misunderstood no as we said misunderstood what do you mean rain crazy lost your mind we may not can comprehend that today because we live in the place we get plenty of rain but not in that day wasn't just an area that didn't get rain the world didn't get rain Elijah misunderstood Daniel misunderstood Shadrach mesach and Abednego misunderstood all the prophets in the Old Testament rose up and prophesied and would speak the word misunderstood the the Magi that came to see Jesus were misunderstood Jesus when he walked here on the earth he was misunderstood amen Paul was misunderstood and all the all the ones down through the Dark Ages misunderstood why won't you just say deny him and you can live can't you just reason that can't you but they knew if they did it was a greater death but if they didn't it was a greater life this is where Satan's trying to get us through a swap amen a greater death for a greater life this is what he did to Heath she swapped a greater life for a greater death this is what he tries to do he tries to make young people swap out something that that's so insignificant for something amen that that that was so great they could have had right and they swapped it out and they took things something that was so insignificant that generally caused them more problems and more heartaches more pain and more suffering if they wouldn't have just swapped that moment with Jesus and for Jesus to come into their heart and to change them forever that had just took that and took it to their heart and said God whatever it takes let me just die to my ways and to what I've done let me live for you but they swapped it for just a few moments of pleasure and it leads to Greater heartache and leads to to Greater troubles leads to Greater problems and leads to Greater issues and they had a chance but people get misunderstood brother Brown was talking about a woman that was in a in in in in a hospit doctor's office he actually happened to be in the room next door and she didn't know it and the doctor didn't either but she had been in one of his meetings and been pray for for a a big Gorder or something on her big tomb or something that was out out of her you know growing out of way out very noticeable and the doctor he wanted to know what become of the growth she said well there's a man by the name of brother brandham who prayed for me and the Lord healed me he said well I don't believe that I could never believe anything like that tell me who took it off she said you show me the scar so what did you put on it to get rid of the scar she said nothing at all he just called me out in a meeting and the thing left and he said I was sitting in the Next Room that's right sitting right there listening she didn't know I was there and he didn't know I was there because he didn't even know me anyhow and anyway take you know going down he says he said well I don't believe one word of it said I I've never seen anything yet that could do anything like that I just don't believe it I I I got to see it before I believe it she said well what about my growth he said I'd have to see it Le before I believe it but see seeing is not believing faith is a substance of things you don't see so you believe it first and then it happens amen so a man was not a Believer so therefore it was all mystery to him he didn't know what he was talking about because he couldn't understand it it was nothing but a riddle people to say people today say well I don't believe in Divine Healing I don't believe in the Holy Ghost I don't believe in speaking in tongues I don't I don't believe in shouting I don't believe in all of that I don't believe in it why it's a mystery to them it's just you're just misunderstood and but it's God here in in his Bible is what it says here is bringing the same results that the Bible spoke of bringing then it's got to be God you just misst understanded that's all God is always misunderstood his disciples couldn't understand his miracles what manner of man is this that even the winds and the waves obey him they misunderstood he wasn't just a man he was God he that's what's a matter with a lot of lot of people they wanted to make him a little M mascot boy something that maybe carries a bad every once in a while they wanted to make him just a little fellow around the camp he wasn't just a little fellow around the camp I like that brother brand had a way of putting stuff said he was Jehovah God they misunderstood it they expected him to be just one of them he wasn't just one of them he was God among them he was more than a man as I've often said he was a man when he's hungry but he was God when he fed 5,000 he was a man when his tired in the back of a boat but he was God when he ceased the winds and waves what manner of man is this he wasn't a manner of man he was God manifested in a man but they misunderstood it they thought him to be just Mary's son a carpenter but he was God manifested in flesh the Roman soldiers they misunderstood it for sure they would not have crucified him or spit on him or hit him or or lashed him with 40 Lashes they misunderstood amen they misunderstood him all through his whole life amen every one of them trying to find a spot here go on down he said even the devil misunderstood him surely that that cannot be the Son of God he wouldn't stand there and be mistreated like that them cussing him and disciples treating him and walking away that can't be God he said if he would not have misunderstood that he would not have allowed him to go to the Cross cuz he knew if he died all was lost for Satan but the thief on his left misunderstood him but the thief on his right understood said we've done evil we deserve what we get what what we're getting but this man has done nothing Lord remember me when you come in your kingdom watch that voice come back and say today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise he understood that God was dying for our sins that was the only way he could die he had to be put to death amen he understood it people have been misunderstood all all all through time he said watch you watch how when the word comes into the Church in the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost was misunderstood and he said he's misunderstood today misunderstood today people misunderstand today May misunderstand the power of the Holy Spirit they call it a bunch of Holy Rollers they call it a bunch of people that ain't in the right mind they misunderstood they misunderstand that you have to lose what you call your right mind that to call yourself Christ because you have to have the mind of Christ in you you have to have it amen one's carnal the other's spiritual one walks after the flesh one walks after the spirit it's not you they misunderstand it's the Holy Spirit that's in you they misunderstand they might call you somebody they might say something about you speaking in his tongues or or or dancing in the spirit or or or whatever amen but it's not you they're misunderstanding it is God their misunderstanding we get on we get to a place we got to have it all figured out we got to have it all you know just right but the thing you got to come to is Lord I can't get it all figured out that's but one thing I can do is trust you one thing I can do is say God you're in control I don't know how it's going to happen I don't know how it's going to work out I just don't want to go by my own thinking no more that's right I got myself in a lot of trouble going by my own thinking and what I thought I ought to be and what I thought I ought to do but today God I want it to be your mind than me that's right let's bow our hearts brother brandom said like this he said we wasn't nothing but but a knead there was nothing to us we were all dead in sins and trespasses we were in all kinds of conditions but then we now can prostrate ourselves and give ourselves up until God takes his transfusion tube the name of Jesus Christ because there's not another name under Heaven whereby men can be saved and transfer the Life of Christ into us then we can have this kind of faith the same Faith Christ had Christ's Faith was not based on those Pharisees or sades on their pots or kettles or pans or washing feet and this that and the other was based on the word of God so much un Christ was the word the word was made flesh and then when we can get so transfused by his power that we die to our own thinking and our faith becomes that genuine faith in the Life of Christ is transfused into us and we become living creatures of God a dwelling place for the holy spirit that they now send his radiant blessings down through every part and we are the statue of Christ that's what we desire I'm going to me to say Lord tonight I want the mind of Christ I don't want to lean into my own understanding I I don't want to lean into my own thinking way I think it ought to be or way I think it ought to happen but Lord I want your life I want your peace I want your joy I want to dig out that old sand that has moved over that promise dig it out tonight get back down to that rock so the water can come and it can saturate your thirsty Soul Hallelujah father we come to you tonight once again hands lifted all over this building Lord my hands up included father Lord I I get myself into a lot of trouble doing my own thinking and my own mind and relying on my own ability abilities but Lord if we could just let go and let God have his way let the mind of Christ let there be a renewing of the mind of Christ in our hearts Lord that you can come and take complete control move through every fiber the every being Lord you saw each hand Lord we're all humans Lord we we get so we're so frail sometimes but sometimes we think was so big that we could figure you out or figure our own life out or figure out how we're going to do this or that just get all muddled up tore up and Tangled Up but God tonight we just want to come back to that rock and say I trust you you got my life in your hands my ways are your ways your ways are my ways I give give it to you Lord I make a full surrenderance anybody tonight need to make a full surrenderance and say Lord I I want to surrender myself to you father I want to surrender my mind to you Lord not give such a platform for Satan to come and torment me but Lord I I want to Just Surrender it to you Lord Lord forgive me if I kind of get out of control and thinking about things and get all muddled up but Lord I I just want you to wash me right now and let your love and compassion just flow over me
