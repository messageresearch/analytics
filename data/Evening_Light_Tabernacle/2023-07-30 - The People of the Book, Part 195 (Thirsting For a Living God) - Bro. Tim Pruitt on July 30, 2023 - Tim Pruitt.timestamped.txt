[58:28] I heard from brother Ron Spencer uh

[59:18] amen
[59:20] God bless you we're going to let you
[59:22] have your seats for a few minutes as I
[59:24] want to take a little bit of time to
[59:27] speak to you before we read the word and
[59:29] we're going to
[59:31] um just to share a few things today with
[59:33] you I want to thank brother Michael for
[59:36] helping me facilitate this and also for
[59:39] the brothers and and brother Michael got
[59:41] this done if you can y'all zoom in on
[59:44] this up here so that our unseen audience
[59:47] can see it too and this is just so
[59:49] beautiful the way that that it's done
[59:51] actually it was um when I went to
[59:54] Germany while we were building the
[59:56] church and saw something very similar to
[59:59] this it just um I I just realize that's
[1:00:02] what I wanted to go right there and so
[1:00:05] that's why it's there you know it's um
[1:00:07] something we can change every every
[1:00:10] service and update according to times
[1:00:13] and Seasons or even sermon contents or
[1:00:16] whatever else so you know um thank you
[1:00:18] brother Michael in all your name that is
[1:00:21] done with the hard work and you know
[1:00:24] they did that these screens here and on
[1:00:26] the side how many is happy about that
[1:00:28] amen praise the Lord
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:35] you know God gave the word but great was
[1:00:38] the company that published it and so you
[1:00:40] know there's many many that given to the
[1:00:43] Lord and we're so thankful for what they
[1:00:45] do of their time of their Sweat Equity
[1:00:47] if you look around this this place and
[1:00:51] what we have it's all paid for but a lot
[1:00:54] of it was paid for with your sweat and I
[1:00:56] want to thank you amen every time I
[1:00:59] drive up here I say thank you Lord
[1:01:00] You're you've been so good to us you
[1:01:03] have blessed us you've showed us as
[1:01:05] Jehovah's Zyra the provider you've
[1:01:08] showed yourself as hell else have I more
[1:01:11] than enough
[1:01:12] amen and you know with this more than
[1:01:15] enough I I think as we have done you
[1:01:17] know in our hearts can has been a little
[1:01:20] different maybe in our aim toward others
[1:01:23] but actually when I when we finished
[1:01:26] um this church God not only abundantly
[1:01:29] blessed us and provided for us but also
[1:01:33] I was I was able to fit pews into
[1:01:37] brother Wendell Martin's church and
[1:01:39] Supply them if you ever go there and you
[1:01:41] think it looks like even like Tabernacle
[1:01:43] well we gave them all our pews just like
[1:01:45] ours and and so and then we gave them
[1:01:48] ten thousand dollars to help them build
[1:01:50] their building we've done that with with
[1:01:52] with more than nearly about 10 down
[1:01:56] through the years that we've done that
[1:01:57] with uh around the U.S and Canada
[1:02:00] helping them get started in their in
[1:02:04] their um in their church service we
[1:02:06] recently just done that with the church
[1:02:08] in Newfoundland that just was able to
[1:02:10] buy a facility and and uh it was
[1:02:14] formerly a Catholic church but now the
[1:02:17] original Catholics have it again
[1:02:20] amen so you know we we are we have been
[1:02:23] blessed and blessed abundantly and we
[1:02:26] thank the Lord for that
[1:02:28] and I I wanted to I was talking about
[1:02:30] that and the blessings of the lord we
[1:02:33] we're still supporting the Japanese work
[1:02:36] and I just want to assure you every
[1:02:38] dollar given as designated for Japan was
[1:02:41] given to the trustees and spent for that
[1:02:43] purpose
[1:02:45] still today I sinned I'm 500 each month
[1:02:50] to help them rent a building for their
[1:02:52] church services and this is actually
[1:02:55] their Sunday morning service this week
[1:02:58] um where that you know there was no
[1:03:00] churches in Japan so with the burden on
[1:03:03] our hearts actually others had went in
[1:03:06] and tried to do some seed work there
[1:03:08] brother Danny del mundo others you know
[1:03:10] from Philippines different other places
[1:03:12] had went there and had it done some
[1:03:15] things but this was this was done as a a
[1:03:19] very new work and I I believe that's for
[1:03:22] the FED over there on the left who is
[1:03:24] the pastor he's from the Philippines
[1:03:26] that is working there in Japan and so
[1:03:29] God was able to leave us with them with
[1:03:32] a shepherd and to commit them to a
[1:03:34] Shepherd day or an autonomous Church
[1:03:36] they are on their own we do not control
[1:03:39] them they're not under our thumb but we
[1:03:42] do try to help them and system where we
[1:03:46] can
[1:03:47] um you know I like I said I I send them
[1:03:50] a 500 every month to rent a building for
[1:03:52] their church services and this doesn't
[1:03:55] cover all the expense it just assists
[1:03:57] you know why I do that that way because
[1:03:59] I think it's important that the group
[1:04:02] uses some of its own resources and
[1:04:05] become as self-supportive as possible
[1:04:09] and you know I and I like this because
[1:04:11] if we can get Believers there then then
[1:04:15] it you know it's their job then to
[1:04:18] evangelize their country Amen brother
[1:04:22] Branham said a missionary is not a
[1:04:23] squatter he comes and goes and so you
[1:04:27] know you but you know we believe that we
[1:04:29] get a work started and and from there
[1:04:32] they go and spread the gospel to their
[1:04:35] community and to around the world
[1:04:38] and uh and also we took tithe money from
[1:04:40] that was given to us from a Christian
[1:04:43] man that was designated for the Japanese
[1:04:46] work and and um you know as I said if
[1:04:50] it's designated for that purpose that's
[1:04:52] where it goes the trustees handle it and
[1:04:55] I make sure it goes to the country it is
[1:04:58] intended far and it has helped support
[1:05:01] those that has gone to Japan to be able
[1:05:04] to get this work and you know they
[1:05:06] didn't know exactly how to do it when
[1:05:08] they started you know this printing some
[1:05:10] works and going out and trying to pass
[1:05:12] out tracks and things and meet him in
[1:05:14] the Subways or whatever train station
[1:05:16] and a lot of that didn't work so you
[1:05:19] know it became more one-on-one and um
[1:05:22] you know we we had uh we supported
[1:05:25] ministers like brother Timothy brother
[1:05:27] Craig Brewer brother Jonathan Martin and
[1:05:30] uh and other other ministers who go
[1:05:33] there
[1:05:34] um including brother Danny del mundo
[1:05:36] that we helped support work to go and
[1:05:40] and also teamwork that went from here
[1:05:44] um brother George Winters brother John
[1:05:47] lay and different ones that we helped
[1:05:49] support to go in that initial uh thrust
[1:05:52] and um you know we we have also
[1:05:55] continued to support the translation
[1:05:59] work to get this message into the
[1:06:03] Japanese language you know
[1:06:06] when we went in there there was not a
[1:06:09] single book in their language not a
[1:06:10] single sermon of brother branham's not a
[1:06:13] singing a single
[1:06:15] um thing that we could give them years
[1:06:17] ago they had tried to do the churches
[1:06:19] book secular people had in the
[1:06:21] translation work a few copies was
[1:06:24] printed but that that whole work was
[1:06:25] dropped and forgotten and nobody could
[1:06:28] even produce a copy over there so you
[1:06:31] know but
[1:06:32] um but now today there are close to 500
[1:06:37] titles including the churches book and
[1:06:40] the Seven seal books that is in their
[1:06:44] language
[1:06:45] and it's all because of their efforts
[1:06:48] that that we have done from here and
[1:06:51] sending out and this is nothing short of
[1:06:55] miraculous one of the last couples that
[1:06:58] was reached there was um brother Emil
[1:07:01] and sister Ruth
[1:07:03] um you they have been here to our
[1:07:05] meetings we actually sponsored them to
[1:07:08] come over to be in one of our October
[1:07:12] meetings and them and their daughter was
[1:07:15] able to come and uh but this couple was
[1:07:19] very important I felt it was really
[1:07:22] important for them to to get a view of
[1:07:25] what it was like to be in a church where
[1:07:28] the spirit of God was moving and and
[1:07:31] that to be able to take that lick of
[1:07:33] fire back to Japan and you know these
[1:07:37] were this couple was when the last that
[1:07:39] was reached on one of our trips and uh
[1:07:42] while the brothers was there and by the
[1:07:45] Providence of god sister Ruth happened
[1:07:48] to be just happened to be just happened
[1:07:52] to be a translator by profession and so
[1:07:56] we we were able then to get her then to
[1:07:59] put the message into the Japanese
[1:08:01] language
[1:08:03] and and so and then you know as kobit
[1:08:07] struck the world for several years
[1:08:09] travel was prohibited to Japan and uh to
[1:08:13] buy to provide spiritual food since we
[1:08:15] couldn't go this money was spent to uh
[1:08:19] to put the message into the Japanese
[1:08:21] language now I'm just going to tell you
[1:08:24] it's a vital importance
[1:08:27] not just to tell them of Jesus
[1:08:29] and only just to fade back into sin and
[1:08:32] to the world but to found them in truth
[1:08:35] in present truth now brother Branham
[1:08:39] talked about that himself he said when I
[1:08:41] went to South Africa or to India and
[1:08:44] those places he said um you know many
[1:08:47] were there were many converts thirty
[1:08:49] thousand in one meeting you know that
[1:08:51] that Christ their idols and come to the
[1:08:54] Lord but he's and you're listening to
[1:08:55] take insides with Jesus he said they
[1:08:57] just faded right back out into the world
[1:08:59] or wherever they come from and he said
[1:09:02] you know what I've what should have
[1:09:04] happened was there to be Ministries go
[1:09:07] forth and start churches and and for
[1:09:09] them to get established in the in the
[1:09:12] truth well this is what we have tried to
[1:09:15] do is by getting a a seed Church you
[1:09:19] know then establish them in the truth
[1:09:21] get the message to them amen not just a
[1:09:25] denominational Jesus but the Jesus of
[1:09:28] the Bible
[1:09:29] amen and so the Bible tells you in
[1:09:32] second Peter 1 12 he said he said I
[1:09:34] would not be negligent to put you always
[1:09:37] remembers of these things though you
[1:09:39] know them and be established in the
[1:09:41] present truth now so how else can you
[1:09:45] establish them in the present truth
[1:09:48] except by giving them the true message
[1:09:51] that the apostles and the prophets
[1:09:54] preached and that's what our message is
[1:09:57] is not a new message it is the message
[1:10:00] in its original format serpent seed as a
[1:10:04] apostle Paul and John the Baptist and
[1:10:07] even Jesus himself and and all of them
[1:10:11] taught you know the predestination the
[1:10:14] security of the believer baptism in the
[1:10:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know
[1:10:18] the godhead and you know not a multiple
[1:10:22] deity but of many gods but the one true
[1:10:25] Living God so our burden is totally
[1:10:28] different from that of denominations
[1:10:30] they they present a Jesus of 2000 years
[1:10:34] ago we don't that Jesus has been
[1:10:39] modified by them by the denominations to
[1:10:42] fit the criteria of their beliefs
[1:10:45] and but we present a living God
[1:10:50] one who has spoken specifically to this
[1:10:54] generation
[1:10:55] and there is a message that is given by
[1:10:58] the resurrected Jesus Christ to the
[1:11:01] laodicean AIDS the AIDS we're living in
[1:11:03] to bring forth the Bride of people for
[1:11:06] his namesake that will be raptured and
[1:11:09] it is it is the most important thing we
[1:11:12] can do is get the message in their
[1:11:14] language
[1:11:16] now so you see this is more important
[1:11:19] than even me going over there preaching
[1:11:21] and holding campaigns across Japan
[1:11:23] because that would only last for in
[1:11:27] memory maybe for a few days maybe for a
[1:11:30] year or two and then would fade away
[1:11:32] but this when you can get this where you
[1:11:36] can put it in their language it will
[1:11:39] have an effect for years and years and
[1:11:43] years to come as God tarries now so you
[1:11:47] know again during covet you know the
[1:11:51] world was shut down the country of Japan
[1:11:53] was shut down for about two years and
[1:11:56] when it did open up they were requiring
[1:11:59] like three sets of vaccine and and uh
[1:12:02] and as soon as the doors was open you
[1:12:05] know uh we it was much easier for for
[1:12:10] someone else to travel there than uh
[1:12:13] that was close by so the Philippines was
[1:12:16] there this pastor right here comes from
[1:12:18] brother Danny del mundo does church and
[1:12:22] so he is very much connected with with
[1:12:25] this pastor in this group of people as
[1:12:27] we are and so we made it possible that
[1:12:30] brother Del Monte del Mondo and his wife
[1:12:32] would go and strengthen the Believers in
[1:12:35] the church there and Yokohama and also
[1:12:38] travel elsewhere in the country during
[1:12:41] that time we also channeled funds to
[1:12:43] brother Danny to rebuild Believers in
[1:12:47] the Philippines after a terrible typhoon
[1:12:50] their country and we we also helped him
[1:12:55] and to repair the ceilings of his church
[1:12:58] as the ceilings were falling in and his
[1:13:02] his church had some costly repairs so we
[1:13:05] were able to channel money to that
[1:13:09] um you know apart from that if there's
[1:13:12] is there so is that the only picture of
[1:13:14] that typhoon just go ahead and leave it
[1:13:17] on that one for now
[1:13:19] um we we also um sent contributions
[1:13:23] through time
[1:13:25] um for to Vision books that brother
[1:13:28] Barry Coffey is endeavoring to put
[1:13:30] sermon booklets of brother Branham and
[1:13:32] by Bibles and various languages and
[1:13:34] worldwide and I want you to know he's
[1:13:37] doing a tremendous work and I commend
[1:13:40] him for what he's doing now we didn't we
[1:13:44] haven't sent me some money I sent money
[1:13:46] that was given to me as tithing and and
[1:13:50] accepted it because tithing goes to the
[1:13:53] ministry I accepted it and then I sent
[1:13:56] it there to to help facilitate getting
[1:13:59] the message into different countries now
[1:14:03] today
[1:14:04] a team from Brother Jason Watkins church
[1:14:07] has left today going on a dangerous
[1:14:12] underground Mission work in Egypt and
[1:14:16] prior to their leaving
[1:14:18] um we helped them do a print job for the
[1:14:23] people in Egypt you know they meet there
[1:14:27] it's it's a crime to convert anybody
[1:14:30] into Christianity so you have that one
[1:14:33] of the translation books so uh you know
[1:14:36] we we have helped facilitate
[1:14:40] um sermons like the Easter seal the
[1:14:43] token the unveiling of God recognizing
[1:14:46] your day and his message why Christ
[1:14:49] speak does God change his mind a paradox
[1:14:53] invisible Union all in the Arabic
[1:14:56] language and this is going to to help
[1:15:01] um establish people there that are in
[1:15:03] underground Church is that are happening
[1:15:06] to meet in secret in other words that's
[1:15:09] what underground is not literally in the
[1:15:11] basement but maybe in the basement but
[1:15:13] still out of sight of the authorities
[1:15:15] and um so we have helped
[1:15:19] um you know facilitate this we're to get
[1:15:21] that printed this also goes like our
[1:15:24] Japanese
[1:15:26] um done work has done is put on the
[1:15:29] message Hub that way any Japanese person
[1:15:32] or arabic speaking person can go on the
[1:15:36] message Hub and download and print a
[1:15:39] sermon right there in their country You
[1:15:42] Don't Have To Cross borders you don't
[1:15:44] have to go through customs you don't
[1:15:46] have to do you know pay fees you know
[1:15:49] that they can do it in the privacy of
[1:15:51] their own home and and either read or
[1:15:54] print them out and distribute as they
[1:15:56] feel led so you know we so we have
[1:15:59] helped to do this we have also helped to
[1:16:01] do the same in the Farsi language we
[1:16:05] shall reach the Persian countries of of
[1:16:08] um and Persian speaking people like down
[1:16:11] in Iran and Iraq and different places
[1:16:14] like that that has went now
[1:16:17] you know you probably you probably don't
[1:16:20] realize this
[1:16:22] but um
[1:16:24] um I I just want to I just want to cover
[1:16:28] this while I'm here because next Sunday
[1:16:30] I I'd like to take a missionary offering
[1:16:33] to to support our missions as we go
[1:16:37] forth and this money again will go to
[1:16:40] missions and uh I may not be able to
[1:16:43] tell you exactly what where is going to
[1:16:46] go but I guarantee you every dollar of
[1:16:48] it will be spent for Mission
[1:16:51] projects and uh but you know and this is
[1:16:55] not missions but yet it is missions but
[1:16:57] your money won't go for this but you
[1:17:00] might not realize it but the Fiber Optic
[1:17:03] internet you know to support our
[1:17:06] streaming work our um to load it up on
[1:17:10] the uh on our website and so on it cost
[1:17:14] us about thirty five hundred dollars a
[1:17:16] year you're offering pay for that the
[1:17:19] offerings that you give and this helps
[1:17:21] not Mission offerings but your regular
[1:17:23] offering helps get the gospel to all the
[1:17:26] world to edify Believers around the
[1:17:29] world and that is also a mission work
[1:17:34] amen it really is because you know that
[1:17:37] this gospel must be preached into all
[1:17:39] the world and then the end shall come so
[1:17:41] this is one of the ways of reaching the
[1:17:45] world
[1:17:46] now so we're we're using as the Bible
[1:17:49] said travel will vastly increase you
[1:17:53] know so that's in the Book of Daniel
[1:17:54] where it speaks of that and so you know
[1:17:58] right now you don't realize it and um
[1:18:02] but that but we have right now listening
[1:18:05] in part of our service today brother
[1:18:08] attic Wilson and his family from South
[1:18:10] Africa then another part of South Africa
[1:18:13] hours and hours away brother Kalin Singh
[1:18:15] and the and uh perhaps some of his folks
[1:18:19] there listening in or watching the
[1:18:21] service right now as I'm speaking and
[1:18:25] and um that isn't because we are that I
[1:18:28] am so important but is that we we are
[1:18:32] doing all that we can to edify build up
[1:18:35] strengthen the body of Christ around the
[1:18:39] world and give them a balanced gospel
[1:18:43] now of course you know the um as as I as
[1:18:48] I said
[1:18:49] um then to do this not only do you have
[1:18:52] the internet but you also have the
[1:18:55] hosting for sermons on our website and
[1:18:58] the the streaming capabilities and that
[1:19:01] cost in the neighborhood of sixty five
[1:19:03] hundred dollars a year about five
[1:19:05] hundred dollars a month this is paid
[1:19:07] from again from the tithe given to me as
[1:19:11] a pastor and then I take I take it as a
[1:19:14] minister and put it back into the work
[1:19:16] of the Lord and this again is Mission
[1:19:19] work this is a total of ten thousand
[1:19:22] dollars each year to get the gospel out
[1:19:24] to the world just by these means and and
[1:19:26] if you look around the these cameras and
[1:19:30] whatever they were bought by the same
[1:19:32] means and even these new projectors not
[1:19:34] by your offerings but for the things
[1:19:37] that you entrusted to the ministry part
[1:19:40] and we as well we we support four
[1:19:45] um for ministers full-time in this
[1:19:47] church brother Joe Adams brother Aaron
[1:19:49] algo speed they are our evangelists that
[1:19:52] are going out from here we also send
[1:19:55] um 600 a month to to one of the
[1:19:58] evangelists that you know to help him
[1:20:00] pay his rent every month you know we we
[1:20:03] have had that kind of Burden not just to
[1:20:07] reach out to the world but also home
[1:20:10] missions and around the U.S and and
[1:20:12] Canada and so you know this is why we're
[1:20:15] doing this and also I just want to say
[1:20:17] that right here in our service today
[1:20:20] just to show you the effect
[1:20:23] um we have uh brother Timothy Williams
[1:20:25] from Australia will you stand brother
[1:20:27] Timothy amen he came to our our services
[1:20:30] this week he's looking for God Amen have
[1:20:34] you found him have you found the desire
[1:20:36] of your heart isn't that wonderful gonna
[1:20:39] be baptized today in the name of the
[1:20:41] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:46] now this is a face that you would never
[1:20:49] see
[1:20:50] but it's joined with us many times
[1:20:53] back here is a family here from Trinidad
[1:20:56] Brother David sister Carol and their
[1:20:59] daughter from from Trinidad where y'all
[1:21:02] stand amen they're they're part of that
[1:21:04] unseen host that many times are part of
[1:21:07] our services and they've just come to be
[1:21:10] here with us today
[1:21:12] amen
[1:21:15] now if you think we get lots of
[1:21:17] contributions from the world out there
[1:21:20] we actually get very little from outside
[1:21:22] sources to cover this part of the
[1:21:25] ministry and if you're listening in and
[1:21:27] you're blessed by the services they
[1:21:30] don't come for free you know you you
[1:21:32] might consider helping support the
[1:21:34] gospel to the world but in saying that
[1:21:36] I'm not asking for your tithe that
[1:21:39] belongs to your pastor to take from your
[1:21:41] local work but you want to give a
[1:21:43] mission offering or don't have a local
[1:21:45] home Church where your contributions
[1:21:47] would be spent as wisely as possible for
[1:21:50] the gospel of Christ
[1:21:52] now I also wanted to tell you not only
[1:21:55] do we do that but if you look here
[1:21:58] occasionally and I don't do this often
[1:22:01] just several times Through The Years
[1:22:04] um in Zambia we helped fund a a rough
[1:22:08] structure
[1:22:10] um in Zambia last year and uh so if you
[1:22:14] put your the picture from Zambia know
[1:22:17] that that's not Zambia that's uh there
[1:22:20] you go there's Zambia and it's a rough
[1:22:23] structure that we helped them a
[1:22:24] congregation do last year now this year
[1:22:27] we are finishing this with putting
[1:22:29] flooring doors windows and toilets and
[1:22:33] so on there as you can see it's still
[1:22:35] just a rough building yeah they use it
[1:22:37] just like that but you know they they
[1:22:40] ask and we had helped that much so I
[1:22:43] just thought well we might as well
[1:22:44] complete what we're doing so we've been
[1:22:47] we're finishing this putting Windows
[1:22:49] Doors toilets
[1:22:51] um flooring because you know they they
[1:22:54] were willing to to meet in there with
[1:22:55] dirt floors so God bless them they and
[1:22:59] they it's a struggling nation and and
[1:23:01] struggling people now as um as you know
[1:23:06] um and you might have heard there's a
[1:23:09] revival going on in
[1:23:12] Uganda and there's been a lot of new
[1:23:14] believers
[1:23:16] and again uh we have helped through the
[1:23:19] years to facilitate
[1:23:22] um translation works for the people in
[1:23:26] Uganda they got several different
[1:23:28] languages there that that we have helped
[1:23:32] facilitate and so we built and and I'm
[1:23:37] going back a few years but we built this
[1:23:39] church in in um for brother James Nevada
[1:23:43] Bondi uh back some years ago if you'll
[1:23:47] show that was that previous picture
[1:23:49] Michael uh right there and so you know
[1:23:54] we helped facilitate this because and we
[1:23:57] also supported translation and
[1:24:00] distribution of brother branham's
[1:24:03] message and uh and tracks and things
[1:24:06] like that to send out to the different
[1:24:09] languages there and and uh brother
[1:24:12] brother uh James uh he he at that time
[1:24:18] was supporting and I'm not certain all
[1:24:20] what he's doing right now now currently
[1:24:22] but and you know we actually helped him
[1:24:25] to print and translate many many sermons
[1:24:29] of brother branham's to go into the
[1:24:32] country of Uganda in several different
[1:24:34] languages and tracks and so on and then
[1:24:37] his church was just in shambles as a
[1:24:41] Shack
[1:24:42] in bad condition so we helped facilitate
[1:24:47] this and we we built him a nice Church
[1:24:50] there
[1:24:51] and then I you know knowing that he was
[1:24:56] doing this translation work and laboring
[1:24:58] for the gospel and and facilitating
[1:25:02] um and hosting
[1:25:04] um different translators that he would
[1:25:06] have to meet with then I uh built him
[1:25:09] this home right here where there there
[1:25:12] again is this is him standing in front
[1:25:14] of his home that that was built and this
[1:25:18] comes from a
[1:25:20] um from a brother who was living in a
[1:25:23] mud hut type with um they put sticks all
[1:25:27] around and and there was
[1:25:30] um you know manure and mud sightings as
[1:25:33] put on there that can be washed away
[1:25:35] during things uh during like
[1:25:38] um the torrential rains that they get
[1:25:40] there in Uganda and so on so
[1:25:44] um you know there there again we we
[1:25:47] tried to help because he's hosting
[1:25:49] ministers coming in and the trans works
[1:25:53] and for him and his family we helped do
[1:25:55] this so you know um together with
[1:25:58] brother Hilda Brown I worked together
[1:26:00] with him who was uh living of course at
[1:26:03] that time
[1:26:04] now you know
[1:26:07] um we we have plans this year coming up
[1:26:11] at the first of actually next year so
[1:26:14] we're making plans now uh brother
[1:26:16] Timothy Brother David Mayer of France
[1:26:19] they are going to the nation of Uganda
[1:26:22] to for special meetings there with um
[1:26:25] with a friend that I have been
[1:26:27] conversing with for probably the last
[1:26:29] seven to ten years
[1:26:31] and um and that's brother Buzz Bosey
[1:26:34] talamua
[1:26:37] um so if you'll bring up that photo of
[1:26:39] the committee there there they're making
[1:26:42] plans for a 2024 youth meetings in
[1:26:46] January or Brother David Mayer brother
[1:26:49] Timothy Pruitt will go they have a
[1:26:51] committee about 15 young people helping
[1:26:53] preparation so yeah there is still
[1:26:57] um Mission work that is going on and uh
[1:27:01] brother bozi
[1:27:03] um he's been instrumental in not only
[1:27:06] found in a church in Kampala Uganda but
[1:27:08] also founding a church in kawasa
[1:27:11] Ethiopia we have assisted him in
[1:27:15] translating printing books or booklets
[1:27:17] rather tracks and so on and you know
[1:27:20] things like helping him in evangelism
[1:27:23] putting tires on his car to go and
[1:27:25] preach the gospel in another nation and
[1:27:27] this man Works tirelessly for the gospel
[1:27:31] of Christ he make you ashamed you know
[1:27:34] when he went on his honeymoon he he took
[1:27:37] the money that was given to him and and
[1:27:39] him and his wife headed out for Ethiopia
[1:27:42] there to be able to preach the gospel
[1:27:45] and to share the the the the message and
[1:27:49] to help establish a church and right now
[1:27:51] because of his efforts there is a church
[1:27:55] there in kawasi uh Ethiopia and um
[1:27:58] there's also he has aspirations to go
[1:28:01] back because there's many other large
[1:28:04] cities in the millions that he wants to
[1:28:07] minister to and um you know I I wanted
[1:28:10] to get to know brother Buzz because I've
[1:28:13] written him many times and we've
[1:28:15] conversed back to the years so I
[1:28:18] actually paid for him and bought him a
[1:28:20] ticket to meet me in Germany where that
[1:28:23] brother Timothy and I could spend hours
[1:28:25] some hours together meet face to face
[1:28:27] talk about Mission Works and so on like
[1:28:30] that and so he met me there in um in
[1:28:34] Germany and we were able to discuss many
[1:28:37] things I got to know him on a personal
[1:28:39] level because the Bible said to know
[1:28:41] them that labor among you and so it's
[1:28:44] very very important so right now I'm
[1:28:47] going to go and bring Uganda to evening
[1:28:49] like Tabernacle and uh brother Michael
[1:28:53] has helped me facilitate this and we
[1:28:56] have here with us
[1:28:58] yeah
[1:28:59] yep here brother all right we have
[1:29:02] brother Buzz Bosey here and um it's uh
[1:29:06] he's going to greet you this morning God
[1:29:07] bless you brother brothers Bosey we love
[1:29:10] you amen you you have been a an
[1:29:13] inspiration to my heart I just want you
[1:29:16] to share with them your inspiration and
[1:29:18] again about 10 minutes to greet the
[1:29:20] people this morning
[1:29:22] amen amen God bless you so much brother
[1:29:24] Tim I really appreciate you and thank
[1:29:26] you for the invitation to uh good to say
[1:29:29] that evening
[1:29:31] we've uh over the years I presented your
[1:29:34] ministry
[1:29:35] and uh so I just wanted to give a little
[1:29:38] greeting and maybe speak a little bit
[1:29:40] about what we are doing here and and I I
[1:29:44] remember the first time I ever had of
[1:29:46] your ministry was at the meetings I
[1:29:49] witnessed 2007 that brother biscal uh
[1:29:52] hosted over in Canada and uh there I was
[1:29:56] really blessed uh with the method that
[1:29:59] you gave
[1:30:00] the dispensation of fullness of times I
[1:30:03] think that was the subject I was really
[1:30:05] so impacted by that and when I went to
[1:30:09] search on your Church website I noticed
[1:30:12] something that really moved me that you
[1:30:13] had started ministry at 15 years and
[1:30:17] this is exactly the age where when I
[1:30:19] started also ministering in the message
[1:30:22] having come from an Anglican Church back
[1:30:25] at Brown
[1:30:26] my father was a priest I started Living
[1:30:29] with uh with the bishop of our church
[1:30:32] um at 13 years and at that time the
[1:30:35] bishop wanted you know one day we were
[1:30:38] sitting on the dining table and he asked
[1:30:40] me uh can you preach and so I was very
[1:30:43] shocked because I did not expect that
[1:30:46] from from the bishop in the Anglican
[1:30:48] Church you have to go to theology for a
[1:30:50] few years be ordained as a as a minister
[1:30:52] to be able to stand on the pulpit but
[1:30:55] when he asked me that a little child of
[1:30:57] 13 years I was very shocked but that
[1:31:01] would be the first time that I ever
[1:31:03] stood before a few hundred people and
[1:31:05] and for two years I was with him and
[1:31:09] living in his house and ministering
[1:31:11] until later on the message I had the
[1:31:13] message when I was 15 years I was about
[1:31:16] to make 15 years and when I had the
[1:31:20] message for about six months I tried to
[1:31:22] wrestle with it it was not easy in
[1:31:24] coming because I had many aspirations I
[1:31:27] wanted to be a bishop in the Anglican
[1:31:28] Church I I wanted to be you know someone
[1:31:32] that would serve God and would tell
[1:31:33] people about about the Lord I had desire
[1:31:36] to live that kind of life you know of
[1:31:39] course being from a background where my
[1:31:40] father was a minister himself and so I
[1:31:43] knew that that would be the only thing
[1:31:45] that would bring me
[1:31:46] uh a closer to the Lord and to serve the
[1:31:49] people of God but literally did I know
[1:31:52] that God had other plans when he
[1:31:54] introduced the message to me and you
[1:31:56] know being that it's a few minutes I'll
[1:31:58] just give a little bit of that and you
[1:32:01] know
[1:32:02] um having ministered for two years 13
[1:32:06] years 14 years when I became 15 then God
[1:32:09] introduces the message to me through a
[1:32:12] few people that I had come in contact
[1:32:15] with
[1:32:16] and I applied to wrestle with that but
[1:32:18] through a supernatural encounter the
[1:32:20] Lord made me while I was just there in
[1:32:22] our church in the Anglican church and
[1:32:25] you know I saw the children being
[1:32:26] baptized I saw a woman preaching I I had
[1:32:30] I sing the Apostles Creed I don't know
[1:32:33] how many people listening to me today
[1:32:35] know the apostles greed and so as I had
[1:32:38] that across the screen
[1:32:40] um I was moved by this by this line
[1:32:42] which said and I believe in the Holy
[1:32:45] Catholic church and I remember the
[1:32:47] brother his name was Paul who used to
[1:32:49] minister to me you said you were
[1:32:50] catholic and I would say no I'm
[1:32:52] Protestant I'm not Catholicism so that
[1:32:56] voice came again to me I said oh
[1:32:59] goodness I have never had this been
[1:33:01] spoken I did not know that this was part
[1:33:03] of our crew and so but right there while
[1:33:07] we were standing in our church
[1:33:10] something happened that I would say was
[1:33:12] an encounter with the Holy Spirit
[1:33:14] having had the message for about six
[1:33:16] months and my heart knew that it was the
[1:33:18] truth but
[1:33:20] something needed to happen for God to
[1:33:22] move in my heart for me to hold somebody
[1:33:25] accept the message and and you know as a
[1:33:29] wall of wind was just going around over
[1:33:31] my head I had a I had a sound and it was
[1:33:35] loud and clear as I'm speaking to you
[1:33:37] today and he spoke to me by name say
[1:33:40] talimar find the nearest exit and leave
[1:33:43] this place
[1:33:44] and it came about twice and then the
[1:33:47] third time I couldn't resist it I just
[1:33:49] picked up my Bible and swung myself out
[1:33:51] of the church after the Anglican church
[1:33:52] and that would be the very first last
[1:33:54] time I went into the Anglican church and
[1:33:57] then later on I would go to a message
[1:33:59] church that same day because apparently
[1:34:02] I was living with a family that our
[1:34:06] message Believers Minister it was a
[1:34:08] pastor in the message and so I I had to
[1:34:12] go there at that moment because I had
[1:34:14] nowhere to go and right there he
[1:34:18] ministers preaching his name was brother
[1:34:20] Paul is preaching and preaching like a
[1:34:23] man with coats of fire under his feet
[1:34:26] just like a bridge by the team and so
[1:34:28] this moved me and and I knew that what
[1:34:31] he was saying was the truth everything
[1:34:33] he was speaking about was exactly what I
[1:34:35] had left in my church
[1:34:37] and you know that same atmosphere came
[1:34:40] again and that one will come came over
[1:34:43] my head again and our voice came out of
[1:34:45] it and said stand up on your feet and
[1:34:48] lift up your hands and declare to
[1:34:49] everybody here that you have accepted
[1:34:52] this message and you would like to be
[1:34:53] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:34:56] I try to resist it but I couldn't I just
[1:34:59] noticed that tears were coming down from
[1:35:02] my eyes and I just stood up and I was my
[1:35:04] whole body was shaking I don't know what
[1:35:06] was happening at that moment but I gave
[1:35:09] my heart to the Lord I was prayed over
[1:35:10] and they took and made to the river and
[1:35:13] baptized me in the name of our Lord
[1:35:15] Jesus Christ now when I came out of that
[1:35:17] water I decided and made up my my mind I
[1:35:20] was only 15 years but I made up my mind
[1:35:23] that I would tell the whole world about
[1:35:26] this entire message of course it was
[1:35:30] very strange at that time in our village
[1:35:33] in our place it was not widely known and
[1:35:36] you know all these things that were
[1:35:38] thought in the message he was not
[1:35:40] accustomed to them but I made up my mind
[1:35:42] I said if I'm going to live a life I'm
[1:35:44] going to live a life of telling others
[1:35:46] about this precious message praise the
[1:35:48] Lord and I just want to thank God
[1:35:50] because ever since then it's been 16
[1:35:53] years and the only thing I've known is
[1:35:56] to Proclaim this message this message
[1:35:58] will be Aha and by what this Grace I've
[1:36:00] been married now for 10 years and five
[1:36:03] children and and you know the Lord moved
[1:36:07] in my heart yesterday before I got
[1:36:08] married
[1:36:10] and uh I I just
[1:36:13] you know receive the burden
[1:36:15] I was in
[1:36:17] um in Zimbabwe at the time and the Holy
[1:36:20] Spirit ministered to me about Ethiopia I
[1:36:23] did not know a few people I have never
[1:36:24] been to a fair paid sir uh but not it's
[1:36:28] um in the north the Northern parts of
[1:36:31] Uganda
[1:36:32] in little ways away so I had never been
[1:36:34] there and been from a Battleground that
[1:36:37] did not have very much I did not expect
[1:36:39] that I would ever go there but you see
[1:36:41] the Holy Spirit began to minister to me
[1:36:42] and
[1:36:44] um I contacted someone who was there and
[1:36:46] wouldn't have an open door and somebody
[1:36:49] told me that there was no message there
[1:36:51] there is no Believers in the country
[1:36:53] with European it's a country for almost
[1:36:56] 120 million people and so I thought I
[1:36:59] said if God is ministering to me about
[1:37:02] going to Ethiopians we must make a way
[1:37:03] somehow and this man put me to a test he
[1:37:07] asked me quite a few questions and said
[1:37:09] how old are you
[1:37:11] um when did you believe the message how
[1:37:13] long have you been preaching the message
[1:37:13] are you married and I I failed the test
[1:37:16] I can tell you I failed the test I could
[1:37:18] feel I failed at first and this man told
[1:37:20] me I'm sorry I can't overcome you here
[1:37:22] he was a
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:30] foreigners in the country but then that
[1:37:33] took me into prayer and fasting I desire
[1:37:36] that God would do something that would
[1:37:39] sovereignly prove his will for us to
[1:37:41] build the country and it was them that I
[1:37:44] prayed I said God if it's a real may you
[1:37:46] then provide uh the resources for us to
[1:37:49] pray without having to ask nobody and
[1:37:52] also may you provide a contact I don't
[1:37:54] have to ask anybody for them to open the
[1:37:56] door to go for us to build the country
[1:37:58] and of course I wasn't married at the
[1:38:00] time but later on you know things
[1:38:04] happened and during the short time I
[1:38:06] cannot give you the whole story and
[1:38:07] testimony but what it suffice to say
[1:38:10] that
[1:38:11] um you know things happened and and the
[1:38:14] Lord provided the resources for us we
[1:38:17] needed quite a lot of money to go and at
[1:38:19] this time I was married and you know um
[1:38:22] maybe a few people have heard of that
[1:38:24] but the team dog came and grabbed me and
[1:38:26] my wife after the Lord had spoken to us
[1:38:29] and confirmed it by by a way of a vision
[1:38:31] that uh brother Tim would be coming down
[1:38:35] to do our wedding and and spoke to my
[1:38:38] pastor spoke to my father-in-law and my
[1:38:40] fiance and told them that the Lord has
[1:38:41] spoken to me about this but he has given
[1:38:43] me a sign and the sign has come to pass
[1:38:45] and this brother comes down and and he
[1:38:48] speaks to me he says where are you going
[1:38:50] to go for your wedding honeymoon I said
[1:38:53] by the team I'm not planning to go for a
[1:38:56] honeymoon anywhere because I don't have
[1:38:57] a enough resources to do that he said I
[1:39:00] have a proposal to make he said why
[1:39:02] don't you go to Ethiopia when you say
[1:39:04] the Ethiopia my heart shook because it
[1:39:08] had been three years earlier before this
[1:39:12] we have not spoken about these and he is
[1:39:15] proposing to me for us to go to Ethiopia
[1:39:19] it was then that I knew that and he said
[1:39:21] that well I I I'm gonna give you as my
[1:39:24] wedding gift for you to be able to
[1:39:25] accept me for your honeymoon and and God
[1:39:28] provided Sovereign
[1:39:31] [Music]
[1:39:40] for us to have a contact without us
[1:39:44] asking everybody and so by the team I
[1:39:46] was in my laptop like I am right now and
[1:39:49] they were trying to go through the
[1:39:51] Ethiopian Airlines website to book at
[1:39:53] our ticket
[1:39:55] I was with my wife seated by my side
[1:39:57] and we were going to book our ticket
[1:39:59] from an entebbe that is the airport in
[1:40:02] Uganda to borrow that is in Ethiopia and
[1:40:06] I received a call from someone I did not
[1:40:09] know previously he had never he had
[1:40:12] never met me I've never met him and he
[1:40:14] says
[1:40:17] you don't know me but I've seen your
[1:40:19] website I had put up a website called
[1:40:21] the youth message site because I wanted
[1:40:22] to use it to reach out to the people of
[1:40:24] the world about the message of the hour
[1:40:26] and so he said I've seen your website
[1:40:30] and I have a button to preach among
[1:40:32] Ethiopian people and right here in
[1:40:34] Nairobi we have a
[1:40:37] um some foreign
[1:40:39] people from Ethiopia where he has
[1:40:41] refugees
[1:40:42] and the Holy Spirit minister to me to go
[1:40:44] and minister to them and a few of them
[1:40:47] have believed but when I saw your
[1:40:48] website the Holy Spirit has implicit
[1:40:51] upon my heart to invite you to come and
[1:40:53] baptize them
[1:40:54] and I I was speechless I told this
[1:40:58] brother his name is um Justin I told him
[1:41:02] I said Justin you like you say you don't
[1:41:05] know me I don't know you but as I'm
[1:41:06] speaking to you I was trying to book a
[1:41:08] ticket to go to Ethiopia and this is an
[1:41:11] act of God and right away we are going
[1:41:13] to cancel our Ethiopian trip we're going
[1:41:15] to come to Nairobi fast and then from
[1:41:18] Nairobi we will go to Ethiopia so we
[1:41:20] landed in Nairobi met a few brothers
[1:41:22] that we knew and we met up with him also
[1:41:25] and he brought this Ethiopian man and
[1:41:27] brother tell me about place that
[1:41:28] Ethiopian man in the water
[1:41:30] and when he came out of the water he
[1:41:33] said
[1:41:34] I his name is Louisa he said I'd like to
[1:41:37] give you contacts for you to go and take
[1:41:40] this message to my people I want them to
[1:41:42] know about this message on the hour I I
[1:41:45] can't go back because I'm a refugee but
[1:41:47] I want you to go and take this message
[1:41:49] to them and so by God is Grace we went
[1:41:52] there and we called up this first man he
[1:41:55] came he's a priest one of he gave me two
[1:41:57] contacts one was a priest another one
[1:41:59] was his blood brother and the priest
[1:42:02] came and we had everything we had to say
[1:42:04] and he said whatever thing you said is
[1:42:07] the truth but I'm sorry I leave many
[1:42:09] people I just cannot I just cannot
[1:42:12] abandon them but please go on and preach
[1:42:14] this message to my country and so well
[1:42:17] we said well let's go the second contact
[1:42:19] the second contact came and
[1:42:22] um I I I I I I I his name is Paul kumasa
[1:42:25] and kumasa came in and he for about two
[1:42:29] three hours we tried to lay down the
[1:42:30] principles of the message for him and it
[1:42:35] gripped his heart we were just in our
[1:42:37] little room which gripped his heart he
[1:42:39] started crying he said this is the truth
[1:42:41] where has this truth been he said I'd
[1:42:43] like to be baptized right away and so we
[1:42:46] had to go out and look for water there
[1:42:48] was no water we just had together
[1:42:50] somewhere with a very huge bathtub and
[1:42:53] we've placed him by the name of all of
[1:42:55] Jesus Christ and that happened to be the
[1:42:56] first Ethiopian to be baptized in
[1:42:58] Ethiopia
[1:43:00] believing this message
[1:43:04] to come and for us to witness to them
[1:43:07] and so this woman comes
[1:43:10] and I felt that I needed to say this
[1:43:12] because it's very it this was how the
[1:43:15] method now is packed up from this moment
[1:43:17] of this woman us meeting this woman and
[1:43:21] when they told me when this brother was
[1:43:22] telling me about this woman he said you
[1:43:25] need to see this woman she will believe
[1:43:26] this message she'll stop by your food oh
[1:43:28] you need to see her so I was expecting
[1:43:30] you to see a saint but when this woman
[1:43:32] came she was dressed up like all of them
[1:43:35] who were in in plants and you know she
[1:43:37] had all the makeup and all the earrings
[1:43:39] and all the jewelry and you know when I
[1:43:41] looked at her my righteous indignation
[1:43:43] just rose up and shoot up and I said oh
[1:43:45] this is a jezebel she will not get it oh
[1:43:48] I was just biased and by the way it was
[1:43:52] that moment that God checked my attitude
[1:43:54] it was that moment that God opened up my
[1:43:57] mind to know that this message has power
[1:43:59] as long as it's laid down on the heart
[1:44:01] of a person they will receive if they
[1:44:04] are ordained to receive it and so this
[1:44:06] woman
[1:44:07] she looked at me and said as she
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:15] look son
[1:44:17] I I was called by this man because I
[1:44:20] respect him and he told me that there is
[1:44:23] a missionary from Uganda and and and and
[1:44:25] because I was praying for the Lord to
[1:44:27] visit me I came because I know that you
[1:44:31] have a message for me so if you have
[1:44:33] anything to say say it the way it is if
[1:44:35] it is God's word I will receive it and
[1:44:38] at that moment my wife was in the
[1:44:40] bathroom I did not know that she was
[1:44:41] praying but I she like rebuked me I
[1:44:45] opened up my heart and I started sharing
[1:44:47] everything you know talk about Holiness
[1:44:49] talk about the message of the generation
[1:44:51] talk about baptism godhead and
[1:44:53] everything I just powered it all out to
[1:44:55] her and she started crying and and
[1:44:57] laughing at the same time she had mixed
[1:45:00] feelings and and she told me
[1:45:03] uh is this all is there more I continued
[1:45:06] sharing for another one hour my wife
[1:45:08] came out of the bathroom and said I saw
[1:45:10] in a vision someone a lady being
[1:45:12] baptized I said praise the Lord she must
[1:45:14] be this woman let us wait a moment and
[1:45:16] see what the Lord will do and this woman
[1:45:18] was in a few moments she had given up
[1:45:21] her heart and she said this is the truth
[1:45:22] I'd like to receive it and be baptized
[1:45:25] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:45:27] she went out he looked for water
[1:45:30] we had no water anywhere in Addis Ababa
[1:45:33] the capital and so she came back later
[1:45:35] on she said I'm sorry I couldn't find
[1:45:37] the water but very early in the morning
[1:45:39] I'm coming back and so Saints I wanted
[1:45:41] to remember that this was our honeymoon
[1:45:43] myself and my wife so we were not very
[1:45:46] early in the morning before just before
[1:45:48] seven and this lady her name is Jordan
[1:45:50] she said I'm ready I'd like to be
[1:45:52] baptized and she came wrapped up in a
[1:45:54] very big gown you know and you know she
[1:45:56] told me that I borrowed it from somebody
[1:45:58] because she never
[1:46:03] had any
[1:46:13] address in Hawaii and so she gave our
[1:46:15] heart to the Lord with her
[1:46:19] God if it would help us in the work and
[1:46:21] and so the works popped out across the
[1:46:23] country and there are many other
[1:46:24] Supernatural testimonies really of what
[1:46:27] the Lord did
[1:46:28] we've seen God
[1:46:31] um uh a call and prostitutes prostitutes
[1:46:34] off the streets and they've been
[1:46:36] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:46:37] Christ we've seen people where you know
[1:46:40] completely oppressed by the devil being
[1:46:42] delivered
[1:46:43] foreign
[1:46:50] and we love you and the people here have
[1:46:53] heard your message today of sharing what

[1:49:28] to Psalms chapter 42 and verse 1 for our
[1:49:32] scripture reading this morning
[1:49:34] as the heart paneth after the water
[1:49:37] Brooks
[1:49:38] so paneth my soul after thee o God
[1:49:41] my soul thirst us for God for the Living
[1:49:44] God
[1:49:45] When shall I come and appear before God
[1:49:48] my tears have been my meat day and night
[1:49:52] while they continually say unto me where
[1:49:55] is thy God
[1:49:57] when I remember these things I pour out
[1:50:00] my soul in me for I have gone with them
[1:50:04] had I gone with them altitude I went
[1:50:07] with them
[1:50:09] um to the house of God with the voice of
[1:50:12] joy and praise with a multitude that
[1:50:15] kept holy day amen let's bow our heads
[1:50:18] father we love you we want to thank you
[1:50:21] for your blessings to us
[1:50:23] that you're a mighty God and that you
[1:50:26] are called a bride from around the world
[1:50:30] out of every out of every nation Kindred
[1:50:34] Tom tribun people
[1:50:36] and Lord we thank you o God that you
[1:50:39] have given us such a glorious message
[1:50:42] here in this end time and that we are
[1:50:45] part of of something that you are doing
[1:50:47] in this day as we find that last
[1:50:50] predestinated seed I pray that you'll
[1:50:52] bless ever effort of all of the work
[1:50:55] that is done around the world and oh God
[1:50:58] may it be used for your glory and Lord
[1:51:01] that you use us today Lord as we speak
[1:51:04] Words of Life May the joy of the Lord be
[1:51:08] our strength may you help us in these
[1:51:11] times Lord to stand in this evil day
[1:51:14] father I pray in the name of Jesus it
[1:51:17] should anoint the word as it goes forth
[1:51:18] now in Jesus name amen God bless you as
[1:51:22] you're seated
[1:51:24] I was sharing some things with some of
[1:51:26] the brothers during last week and
[1:51:28] something struck an accord in my heart
[1:51:31] that I want to speak upon this morning
[1:51:33] and I want to speak on thirsting for a
[1:51:36] living God
[1:51:38] and of course thirst is a painful desire
[1:51:41] that when you're really thirsty it hurts
[1:51:45] you know it's painful and of course we
[1:51:48] know what it is The Thirst naturally but
[1:51:51] there's also a spiritual thirst
[1:51:54] David said in Psalms 84 and 1 he said
[1:51:57] how amicable or how pleasant are thy
[1:52:01] Tabernacles oh lord of hosts my soul
[1:52:05] longest yea even famous for the courts
[1:52:08] of the Lord my heart and my flesh cryeth
[1:52:12] for the Living God
[1:52:14] and I believe that every man they thirst
[1:52:17] for God is a natural thing to thirst
[1:52:20] it's something that God placed within
[1:52:22] the heart of every man and David said
[1:52:26] here my soul I mean his very innermost
[1:52:29] being the soul desires and Longs and
[1:52:34] thirsts for our living God you know it's
[1:52:37] a control tower as it was that that is
[1:52:40] putting you by God to warn you that
[1:52:43] there is something that is needed that
[1:52:47] causes you to go out on a search you
[1:52:49] know to find that which is the answer
[1:52:51] for the longing of the soul and of
[1:52:53] course the same is true of a of a
[1:52:56] natural thirst long before you dehydrate
[1:52:59] because you can die of thirst there is a
[1:53:02] warning that goes off within your body
[1:53:05] and you begin to desire a hydration and
[1:53:09] and you say I'm thirsty I I need water I
[1:53:13] I need a drink and it'll even cause you
[1:53:16] to wake from a deep deep sleep and and
[1:53:19] cause you to get up and search
[1:53:21] I'm thirsty and the question comes to
[1:53:24] mind do all believers search or at
[1:53:28] thirst and I want to say certainly of
[1:53:30] all believers thirst but their thirst
[1:53:32] has been quenched and satisfied by
[1:53:36] almighty God they have found the
[1:53:39] Fountain of Living Water you know in
[1:53:42] Revelation 7 there's this multitude
[1:53:44] without number who come through to a
[1:53:47] Great Tribulation and and yet they're
[1:53:49] still thirsty because their thirst has
[1:53:52] not been quenched and the Bible says to
[1:53:55] them as they arrive there still thirsty
[1:53:57] you said in Revelation 7 16 they shall
[1:54:01] hunger no more neither thirst anymore
[1:54:05] neither shall the sunlight on them nor
[1:54:08] any heat for the lamb which is in the
[1:54:10] midst of the throne shall feed them and
[1:54:12] shall lead them into living Fountains of
[1:54:16] water and God shall wipe away all tears
[1:54:20] from their eyes
[1:54:22] somehow they get to this other side
[1:54:25] even though even through Great
[1:54:28] Tribulation and and and they are still
[1:54:31] thirsty they still have a need to be led
[1:54:35] to Living Waters
[1:54:37] now there is a natural thirst in every
[1:54:40] human being whether he's a sinner
[1:54:43] whether he's a saint every person thirst
[1:54:46] you are born with a desire or thirst for
[1:54:51] God you were made to desire God now you
[1:54:56] take animals animals don't desire God
[1:54:58] but humans do you never see an animal
[1:55:01] making a a statue or creating an idol uh
[1:55:05] to worship our building houses of
[1:55:08] worship there's no form of worship that
[1:55:11] you see in an animal that that is
[1:55:15] actively trying to worship something but
[1:55:18] man wants to worship something
[1:55:21] you read in the Old Testament in
[1:55:24] Jeremiah 10 where we instructed not to
[1:55:27] learn the way of the Heathen or who
[1:55:29] takes an ax and cuts down a tree and
[1:55:32] makes them out of it an object of
[1:55:34] worship with the work of his own hands
[1:55:37] and that man will try to carve something
[1:55:40] out of that wood and then deck it with
[1:55:42] gold or silver and dress it up and after
[1:55:45] working and making his hand to turn
[1:55:48] around and and bow down to worship it a
[1:55:52] a senseless Idol that has to be carried
[1:55:55] about it that are dumb that cannot speak
[1:55:58] Idols that you can pray to that will
[1:56:01] never answer
[1:56:02] but why does man do this because man is
[1:56:06] always hungered and thirsted after God
[1:56:09] he was made to do that because man has a
[1:56:12] soul
[1:56:12] and so he was made to desire to want to
[1:56:17] know his creator
[1:56:19] every person everybody every human being
[1:56:22] has a thirst for God again in the in the
[1:56:26] message thirst brother Bradham talks
[1:56:28] about it he said I've had people tell me
[1:56:30] well I never did I never thirsted for
[1:56:33] God I just believe it's for somebody
[1:56:35] some just some people that want to be
[1:56:37] Christian oh no that's wrong it is
[1:56:40] actually something that is associated
[1:56:42] with every human being and he said when
[1:56:45] we come to this country in the early
[1:56:47] days we found the Indians here and the
[1:56:49] Indians though Heathen at the time they
[1:56:51] worship the son or something as long as
[1:56:54] they're human there's something in them
[1:56:56] a natural thirst calling out to God
[1:57:00] somewhere
[1:57:02] amen now you know man wants to live and
[1:57:05] he thirsts so he looks for ways to enjoy
[1:57:09] life to his fullness
[1:57:11] and brother Branham told us about this
[1:57:13] and then Tyson's Foods he said I don't
[1:57:16] even condemn The Sinner or the drunkard
[1:57:18] for getting drunk he's all Moody he
[1:57:21] don't know he gets up in the morning
[1:57:23] he's got the blues he has a hangover he
[1:57:25] goes out gets three or four bottles of
[1:57:27] beers and a stuffed a little cigarette
[1:57:30] sucker sets back and smokes and blow it
[1:57:32] through his nose like he was a freight
[1:57:34] train I don't blame him that's all the
[1:57:38] joy he knows that's all he knows about
[1:57:41] he's a pig by nature but he said shame
[1:57:44] on you who professed to be a Christian
[1:57:46] and rely on such things as that for Joy
[1:57:49] when the Holy Ghost Gospel is nothing
[1:57:52] but one great big Powerhouse of Joy amen
[1:57:57] the Holy Ghost uh the gospel is a
[1:58:00] perfect intoxication for every man
[1:58:02] that's got the blues you'll take a drink
[1:58:05] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ be filled
[1:58:08] with the Holy Ghost you are drunk till
[1:58:10] you leave this world amen joy
[1:58:13] unspeakable and full of Glory there's a
[1:58:16] constant stimulation it's a constant
[1:58:18] intoxication drop day and night amen
[1:58:22] that's the word of God
[1:58:24] amen now all men thirst for God but
[1:58:28] they'll try to satisfy it on things of
[1:58:30] the world
[1:58:31] their nature though is sin nature and
[1:58:34] like a pig that Waller in the muck and
[1:58:36] the mire and the Stick Of The World
[1:58:39] but when you've not had a nature change
[1:58:43] the man's up all night playing his video
[1:58:46] games pretending to murder to kill to
[1:58:49] rape to pillage don't don't you know
[1:58:52] that's only trying to satisfy a a a
[1:58:56] beast nature and the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:59:00] get in enjoyment out of feeding on the
[1:59:03] Imagine feeding the imagination on
[1:59:06] things that are evil
[1:59:07] and then because then you know the
[1:59:09] family is neglected the wife is
[1:59:11] neglected not giving her two benevolence
[1:59:14] the children are neglected the Bible is
[1:59:17] not fed upon because you're too busy
[1:59:19] feeding the animal the Beast
[1:59:22] but of course he's a sinner his
[1:59:25] and his dope his uh his tobacco his
[1:59:28] video games his movies that's his
[1:59:31] pleasure
[1:59:32] but this if the soul ever gets that
[1:59:37] satisfying portion of the spirit of God
[1:59:40] the soul belong and desire for the
[1:59:44] Living God
[1:59:45] amen and whether they know it or not
[1:59:48] that you know even though they're trying
[1:59:50] to satisfy it with these vices of the
[1:59:53] world this dope this alcohol a whoring
[1:59:55] or or doing all the other kind of sin
[1:59:58] it's really a misplaced
[2:00:01] it's really a misplaced substitute
[2:00:03] trying to quench The Thirst that is in
[2:00:07] that heart for God
[2:00:11] if they can never come in contact with
[2:00:13] Christ
[2:00:14] they would find that they would have so
[2:00:16] much joy in Christ I mean those things
[2:00:19] would be deader than midnight to them
[2:00:21] they would become addicted to the word
[2:00:24] of God they would become drunk on the
[2:00:26] Holy Ghost and it to them it would be
[2:00:29] joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[2:00:32] a man when he comes home
[2:00:35] under pressure of his job he'll feel the
[2:00:38] need to smoke or you know that calms his
[2:00:41] nerves or he thinks or you know he needs
[2:00:44] a feels the need of wine to relax him or
[2:00:46] feels the need to party that's his
[2:00:49] release
[2:00:50] he wants his pleasure
[2:00:52] you see the thing
[2:00:55] for you to do as a Christian today is to
[2:00:59] live such a Godly life before him that
[2:01:02] you can prove to him that the gospel
[2:01:04] holds 10 000 more
[2:01:08] more pleasure that what that ever will
[2:01:11] be
[2:01:12] amen If he if that man dies in that
[2:01:15] state he'll go to hell on his liquor
[2:01:17] that's the devil's intoxication if he
[2:01:21] dies dragging on that old pipe or That
[2:01:23] Dope he you know God is his judge
[2:01:28] if they're not going out here dancing
[2:01:30] and running around in Memorial clothes
[2:01:32] again God's our judge they'll wind up at
[2:01:35] the judgment
[2:01:36] but there's one thing
[2:01:39] that's different for you
[2:01:41] amen there's one thing if you die under
[2:01:44] the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:46] like Stephen did when he looked up in
[2:01:48] the face of God and said I see the
[2:01:51] heavens open and I see Jesus standing at
[2:01:54] the right hand brother you're Heaven
[2:01:57] bound
[2:01:58] Hallelujah now Jesus invites whosoever
[2:02:02] will to come to me and drink
[2:02:06] drink that's quenching their thirst
[2:02:10] and he said they will never thirst again
[2:02:13] you know what a promise that that it is
[2:02:16] that he can be the answer to the the
[2:02:20] sole desire
[2:02:22] and my but you know the devil will make
[2:02:24] other ways to for you to try to quench
[2:02:27] your thirst
[2:02:28] sometimes it's a religious thirst
[2:02:31] you know I I'll just go to church and
[2:02:34] I'll join a church and I'll join a group
[2:02:36] of people who I think is right and then
[2:02:38] you wind up with as much hypocrisy in
[2:02:42] your life or sometimes worse than going
[2:02:43] to the ballroom to quench your thirst
[2:02:47] in the wilderness places of Israel
[2:02:51] where we read of David speaking of the
[2:02:55] deer the heart
[2:02:57] they had wolves and they had wild dogs
[2:02:59] that would attack the deer because they
[2:03:02] were an easy prey to them
[2:03:05] and I don't need to say to you you were
[2:03:08] that deer
[2:03:09] chased by the hounds of hell
[2:03:12] and if you're outside of Christ this
[2:03:14] morning the devil's on your Trail
[2:03:17] let me tell you demons that swore they
[2:03:20] would destroy you
[2:03:22] amen and of course you know you're
[2:03:25] running every man is running but you're
[2:03:28] running into a death trap
[2:03:30] you're running into total exhaustion
[2:03:33] until the hounds are gonna get you
[2:03:36] forever Center the hounds of Hell or on
[2:03:39] your Trail and they're yapping
[2:03:42] they're yapping at you
[2:03:44] amen I I was there in the in a place
[2:03:47] here just recently where
[2:03:50] um during the night during the night you
[2:03:53] know demons actually came into my room
[2:03:56] and they were they were screaming and
[2:03:59] threatening and yelling and trying to as
[2:04:01] if you know trying to give it get at me
[2:04:04] well I tell you what I did
[2:04:06] honestly I needed some sleep and they
[2:04:09] were disturbing me
[2:04:11] so I just say I just I just sat up in
[2:04:15] bed and I said okay you Devils now you
[2:04:17] go in the name of Jesus Christ I'm going
[2:04:19] to sleep and I turned over and went to
[2:04:21] sleep
[2:04:22] but you see there was a man there in
[2:04:26] those meetings that was having those
[2:04:28] same demons that was come screaming at
[2:04:30] him
[2:04:31] and service after or not service that's
[2:04:34] servant but day after day they were
[2:04:36] tormenting him and coming to him just
[2:04:38] like the eye experiencing and they were
[2:04:41] coming tormenting him and there in the
[2:04:43] presence of God Amen there is we we laid
[2:04:47] hands on him and prayed with him every
[2:04:50] one of those demons left and he found
[2:04:52] peace
[2:04:56] Hallelujah
[2:04:58] but you see ever for every sinner the
[2:05:01] hounds of hell are on your Trail they're
[2:05:04] on your Trail they're yapping they won't
[2:05:06] let you sleep at night your back becomes
[2:05:09] so hard your pillow hard you can't sleep
[2:05:12] and you can't rest because there's no
[2:05:14] place
[2:05:16] you can find peace
[2:05:19] and you hear them coming on your Trail
[2:05:22] the hounds of hell
[2:05:24] maybe sometimes it isn't even something
[2:05:27] you hear
[2:05:28] they're just sneaking up in the shadows
[2:05:31] and they're ready to pounce out upon you
[2:05:33] any moment Because You're vulnerable
[2:05:38] and I want to say today without outside
[2:05:40] of Christ you are vulnerable
[2:05:43] without the Holy Ghost you are
[2:05:45] vulnerable
[2:05:47] amen but these dears would be attacked
[2:05:50] by the Wolves because they're an easy
[2:05:51] prey and without the Holy Ghost you are
[2:05:54] an easy prey
[2:05:58] you can promise I'll be moral I'll make
[2:06:00] my vows I'll turn a new Leaf it'll never
[2:06:04] work
[2:06:05] amen you only make your vows and your
[2:06:07] promises to break them again because
[2:06:10] your adversary the devil is on your
[2:06:12] track he's on your Trail and he's after
[2:06:16] you and he's there in the shadows or
[2:06:19] over the next Hill around the next curve
[2:06:22] he's there everywhere you look
[2:06:25] yeah
[2:06:26] this deer right here at this water book
[2:06:29] he's constantly having to lift his head
[2:06:31] and look around he's nervous any moment
[2:06:35] there he's to pray
[2:06:38] brother Branham tells us
[2:06:40] thirsting for life he said is a good
[2:06:43] type of the devil you take a beautiful
[2:06:44] woman or a handsome young man that's a
[2:06:47] very that's a very pray for the sins of
[2:06:50] this world just to pray a little
[2:06:52] innocent boy of 16 or 17 her little girl
[2:06:56] just to pray to the devil to Feast on
[2:07:00] these wild dogs will lay in ambush
[2:07:03] it's like in the days when you know with
[2:07:06] Cain and Abel and and he says to him to
[2:07:09] Cain don't you know if you do do well he
[2:07:12] says you'll be accepted but if not sin
[2:07:15] is crouching at your door
[2:07:18] and send crouches in every man's door
[2:07:22] just waiting for that opportune time
[2:07:27] they'll take and jump on these little
[2:07:29] deer the first thing they'll do is try
[2:07:31] to maybe to get this hamstring behind
[2:07:34] the leg where they can't run and
[2:07:36] hamstring them
[2:07:38] if you can't grab them there he grabs
[2:07:40] them at the throat and the and and try
[2:07:43] to jugular vein loose and it bleeds to
[2:07:47] death in just a moment
[2:07:49] then there's another place is the flank
[2:07:52] of the deer
[2:07:53] and he'll hit him there in the flank run
[2:07:55] and Chuck his teeth to that if he's a
[2:07:57] heavy dog and you know he'll fling that
[2:08:00] little deer around you know and and
[2:08:03] there they were dog piling
[2:08:06] you see one devil will invite another
[2:08:08] devil
[2:08:10] yeah amen you think oh I'm just gonna
[2:08:12] live my life and you know it's just a
[2:08:14] little devil that I deal with no he will
[2:08:17] invite others
[2:08:18] and they'll go pile you and they'll pull
[2:08:22] you right down into the snares of the
[2:08:25] death and destroy your life destroy your
[2:08:28] family he's a thief and he comes to Rob
[2:08:30] and to kill and destroy
[2:08:35] this dog will grab it but maybe if it's
[2:08:38] a mid-century even he'll swing the deer
[2:08:41] off his feet
[2:08:42] and they just go and carry the little
[2:08:44] fella to death
[2:08:46] let me tell you the devil's not your
[2:08:48] friend
[2:08:49] he don't do anything to you but destroy
[2:08:52] you
[2:08:53] what does Sin have to offer
[2:08:55] it only offers a broken home
[2:08:59] a ruined children and when you get down
[2:09:02] to the end of the road you might have
[2:09:03] built Mansions you might be a great
[2:09:05] person in this life but really
[2:09:08] what does that have to offer you in the
[2:09:10] other place
[2:09:13] one day you're coming down to the end of
[2:09:15] all and I want to say the end is closer
[2:09:18] than what you think
[2:09:20] because the Rapture is Promised for the
[2:09:22] Saints and wrathin will be poured out
[2:09:24] upon the Earth
[2:09:26] I know you know you've been preaching
[2:09:28] you've been preaching like this for many
[2:09:30] years and yeah the other day I stood
[2:09:32] right there before Kenneth Middleton
[2:09:34] what we were the Lord had come for him
[2:09:38] let me tell you he'll come for you
[2:09:41] you got to be ready
[2:09:43] he's come for many
[2:09:45] he could come for you for the services
[2:09:47] out
[2:09:49] but here many times that the dog will
[2:09:51] grab or the wolf will grab him mouth
[2:09:54] some flesh and pull it out if the if the
[2:09:57] deer is quick if he can maneuver his
[2:09:59] body quick enough sometimes he can get
[2:10:02] away
[2:10:03] and then then of course you know when
[2:10:06] the as he gets away from him the dogs
[2:10:08] are rolling from their momentum and he
[2:10:11] runs and whatever but he's wounded
[2:10:14] he's wounded and he knows he's glad to
[2:10:17] find water
[2:10:18] well I'll tell you you won't be in this
[2:10:20] world of sin very long without being
[2:10:22] wounded
[2:10:24] amen you won't be back here very long
[2:10:27] without being defiled by sin and brought
[2:10:30] down into debts that you never imagined
[2:10:36] you can say well I'll tell you what not
[2:10:38] me I'm going to be a model citizen I
[2:10:41] just won't give my life to Christ you
[2:10:42] want
[2:10:46] you have no protection
[2:10:48] you're resolved in your willpower and
[2:10:50] your diseases will not keep you
[2:10:53] you're not strong enough for the devil
[2:10:57] come on amen but here you become wounded
[2:11:00] like this deer and you can imagine this
[2:11:03] deer the blood is running out of him and
[2:11:05] he's looking now for the water Brook
[2:11:09] if you can just get the water
[2:11:12] I can live
[2:11:14] and that's what I'm saying to ever
[2:11:16] wounded soul today if you can only get
[2:11:19] to the water
[2:11:22] if you could only get to that fountain
[2:11:25] of Living Water
[2:11:28] you can live
[2:11:32] but if you don't get to the water you're
[2:11:35] going to die
[2:11:39] the hounds are on your Trail
[2:11:42] sometimes when a deer is wounded it's so
[2:11:45] bad he'll never make it in the water
[2:11:46] he's just there sometimes he'll fall in
[2:11:49] the water and he's too badly wounded
[2:11:52] but sometimes
[2:11:53] they're wounded and would die from the
[2:11:55] wombs
[2:11:56] but to get in that water
[2:11:59] and in that water they drink and they
[2:12:01] drink
[2:12:04] across the Little Creek drink run down
[2:12:07] the creek a little bit run up the hill
[2:12:09] cross back get some water if you can
[2:12:11] just keep on running as long as he can
[2:12:12] get water but if he doesn't get the
[2:12:14] water
[2:12:15] he's going to perish
[2:12:17] this is what David said my soul is
[2:12:21] thirsting after you oh God I I must have
[2:12:23] God or perish
[2:12:25] you know David discovered something here
[2:12:28] he he discovered that no matter how much
[2:12:32] resolved he had and how much
[2:12:34] determination to be a good man and a
[2:12:37] good king and a godly man
[2:12:39] he had all of this determination
[2:12:43] resolve I'm gonna do this I'm going to
[2:12:47] live right I'll tell you what I'll do
[2:12:49] I'll put the word instructors before my
[2:12:51] eyes I'll tie them to my fingers
[2:12:54] I'll tell you what you know I'll put
[2:12:56] I'll hold these promises but I'll tell
[2:12:58] you what
[2:13:00] even though he had 500 wives
[2:13:04] 500 women could not satisfy his thirst
[2:13:11] he had to go and take somebody else's
[2:13:13] wife
[2:13:15] David found out all his pledges and
[2:13:18] Promises could not hold him
[2:13:20] I can get you to sign cards I'll be true
[2:13:23] to my wife I mean battle in front of the
[2:13:24] Altar and say you know I'm going to be
[2:13:27] true to you till death do us part and
[2:13:29] you mean it
[2:13:36] but the only way you're going to be able
[2:13:38] to keep that
[2:13:44] is to get The Thirst that is in your
[2:13:46] soul satisfied
[2:13:48] or else you will always be reaching out
[2:13:52] trying to satisfy it
[2:13:55] and the sinful world that has been bit
[2:13:58] by The Mad Dogs of hell
[2:14:01] with all his modern Jazz and rock and
[2:14:04] rap music and dirty television programs
[2:14:07] and everything cracking their jokes
[2:14:08] they've been knocked on bit
[2:14:12] they're trying to quench that thirst
[2:14:14] with this stagnated water of the devil
[2:14:18] but I tell you I pray today if any is in
[2:14:21] that condition today may your soul your
[2:14:23] heart become so thirsty that you find
[2:14:26] Christ or die
[2:14:28] and it becomes your passion Lord give me
[2:14:31] that water
[2:14:33] I must not fail to get it
[2:14:36] and bound I'll tell you what if you can
[2:14:39] ever get to that water as a deer thirst
[2:14:41] for the water Brooks and you just get a
[2:14:44] drink from there do you know you'll
[2:14:46] never have to have another sermon on
[2:14:48] morals you'll never have to have another
[2:14:51] sermon preached to you on how to dress
[2:14:53] or how to act or how to conduct yourself
[2:14:57] no because your thirst has been
[2:15:00] satisfied and you'll never give up
[2:15:03] Christ for that
[2:15:04] [Applause]
[2:15:10] what makes a man or woman do wrong
[2:15:13] what makes him drink and carry on is
[2:15:17] because there's something in them
[2:15:18] thirsting
[2:15:20] something in her thirsting
[2:15:23] they're trying to quits that Holy thirst
[2:15:26] with the things of the world when only
[2:15:28] God can satisfy that
[2:15:32] that's the reason you thirst for
[2:15:34] something anyway
[2:15:35] because God made you you know your body
[2:15:39] made you to that way so you turn your
[2:15:42] holy thirst to him
[2:15:44] see but when you try to quench your
[2:15:46] thirst with other teeth I dare anybody
[2:15:49] to do that you have no right to to try
[2:15:52] and quench that Holy thirst that you
[2:15:54] thirst for something and you turn into
[2:15:56] the world and then try to satisfy it
[2:15:58] with the world you you can't do that
[2:16:00] there's only one thing that will feel
[2:16:02] that void
[2:16:04] and that's God
[2:16:06] and he made you to thirst
[2:16:10] sometimes we look at as Christians you
[2:16:12] know we look at people who've done awful
[2:16:15] sins and we say oh my what an awful
[2:16:19] person
[2:16:21] really
[2:16:23] if we could look at it and see that it's
[2:16:25] a Thurston human being
[2:16:28] this is what brother Buzz was saying a
[2:16:30] moment ago you know I met this woman and
[2:16:34] I was told she had a hunger she was on a
[2:16:36] search for God I was looking to see a
[2:16:39] holy woman but I saw someone dressed
[2:16:41] like a harlot
[2:16:43] I saw someone who was who who had not
[2:16:47] found that satisfying portion and yet
[2:16:50] you see you see you would have thought
[2:16:53] it would be the model Christian the
[2:16:55] model man the model the model a leader
[2:16:58] out here but no God chooses the harlots
[2:17:02] the fornicators the idolaters and the
[2:17:05] adulterers because they are thirsted
[2:17:11] because they are thirsty for God they
[2:17:14] try to fill it up with alcohol or
[2:17:16] tobacco dope or women or men all kinds
[2:17:20] of other vices
[2:17:22] but it's because there's a hunger a
[2:17:24] thirst on the inside of them but they're
[2:17:27] trying to fill it with other things
[2:17:31] just remember he didn't come to call the
[2:17:33] righteous to repentance
[2:17:35] he come to he come to call The Sinner in
[2:17:38] the ungodly that whom he came to save
[2:17:41] the Bible said he came to say that which
[2:17:43] was lost
[2:17:45] and the first thing before you can be
[2:17:47] saved is real I went lost
[2:17:50] I need Jesus
[2:17:52] and to be helped
[2:17:54] I've tried religion I've tried this I've
[2:17:56] tried Reformation I I've tried I tried
[2:17:59] to be reformed I've tried to well you
[2:18:02] know make vows I turned a new Leaf over
[2:18:04] on New Year's I did this and nothing
[2:18:06] works
[2:18:12] but Isaiah 55 1 said ho everyone that
[2:18:17] thirst says in other words he's calling
[2:18:19] out like he's like stop
[2:18:21] echoing the touches stop
[2:18:25] and he that hath no money
[2:18:27] come and buy and eat
[2:18:30] come and buy wine and milk without money
[2:18:32] or price
[2:18:34] wherefore you spend money for that which
[2:18:37] is not bread and your labor for that
[2:18:38] which is satisfied not you tried this
[2:18:41] and you tried that but it don't satisfy
[2:18:44] hey my heart can diligently unto me and
[2:18:47] eat that which is good and let your soul
[2:18:49] Delight in its fatness
[2:18:51] and climb you ear and come unto me and
[2:18:54] here and your soul shall live and I will
[2:18:56] make an Everlasting Covenant with you
[2:18:59] oh even the sure mercies of David
[2:19:04] what an opportunity
[2:19:07] here the word is calling out actually
[2:19:09] from every scripture you know sometimes
[2:19:12] you say well I wish that God would speak
[2:19:14] to me or just look in the Bible
[2:19:19] I wish he would talk to me well how many
[2:19:22] promises do you have to have
[2:19:24] amen well I wish he cared for me

[2:19:33] had his memorial service of God speaking
[2:19:36] to me to tell him I love you
[2:19:38] he said well brother Tim I wish God
[2:19:40] loved me
[2:19:42] well he came all the way down from
[2:19:44] heaven
[2:19:45] because of you
[2:19:47] amen he came to seek you out
[2:19:51] he sends his holy spirit to find you he
[2:19:54] deals and knocks at your door to find
[2:19:57] you
[2:19:58] amen God select you that he gave his
[2:20:02] only begotten son

[2:20:07] to the world but friends it's also
[2:20:09] personally to you
[2:20:13] because of your sin and because he knew
[2:20:16] you were thirsty
[2:20:17] he was a thirst quencher and I want to
[2:20:20] say of him that no one ever cares for

[2:20:29] dope don't care for you your friends out
[2:20:32] in the world they will abandon you in a
[2:20:34] moment
[2:20:35] amen but there is one a friend that'll
[2:20:39] stick closer than a brother and said
[2:20:41] I'll never leave you and I'll never
[2:20:43] forsake you I won't abandon you I'll be
[2:20:47] there when you fall I'll lift you up
[2:20:49] again

[2:20:59] that Jesus would save me I've done so
[2:21:01] much I I've said so many things wrong

[2:21:08] believe that the devil has sent you to
[2:21:09] hell

[2:21:13] life that you're living is destroying
[2:21:15] you well why don't you just turn that

[2:21:24] is there you know to to destroy you why
[2:21:27] don't you believe there's a God who will
[2:21:29] save you
[2:21:31] amen the God who cares

[2:21:36] of our day and it's there to entice
[2:21:38] people and this is the truth
[2:21:42] I'm actually reading that from a quote
[2:21:44] from without money or price but let me
[2:21:46] just say this is the truth there's so
[2:21:48] many things to entice people

[2:23:35] um this guy was supposed to be a
[2:23:37] Christian and he said this excuse me
[2:23:39] it's about life how it really is and I
[2:23:41] said not my life
[2:23:45] not my life
[2:23:47] amen that's not how my life is my tears
[2:23:50] and my beer and my wife have gone on and
[2:23:52] and my kid's been raised by another man
[2:23:55] and all uh the sorrows and the troubles
[2:23:57] and whatever that they're singing about
[2:24:01] as they glorifies him and it's racist
[2:24:06] and they commiserate together
[2:24:10] one time I you know ever some years ago
[2:24:13] and they was talking about this hidden
[2:24:15] stuff if you play uh your your tape
[2:24:19] backwards on rock and roll you'd hear
[2:24:21] you know subliminal stuff that's in
[2:24:23] their backwards
[2:24:25] I said well I don't know
[2:24:27] I never listen to rock and roll never
[2:24:29] played One backwards
[2:24:31] didn't play one forward much less
[2:24:33] backward
[2:24:35] so I said I I don't know what's there
[2:24:38] but I said I wish they'd play country
[2:24:39] music backwards
[2:24:42] amen man would get his wife back
[2:24:45] you'd get out of the bar room and quit
[2:24:47] drinking
[2:24:48] he'd be a daddy to his kids
[2:24:51] come on there wouldn't be any divorces
[2:24:54] that'd be happy homes I wish they would
[2:24:57] play that backwards
[2:24:59] well I tell you that's what the gospel
[2:25:01] does it takes your rugged ratchet life
[2:25:05] and it turns it around and it restores
[2:25:08] you and brings back the holy ghost in
[2:25:11] your life with a holy think of the Holy
[2:25:13] attitude
[2:25:19] but what Satan wants to do to you
[2:25:22] is take you where your little children
[2:25:23] are ragged
[2:25:25] your little wife is broken
[2:25:27] your home is torn apart
[2:25:30] it's what he wants to do to you it
[2:25:32] glorifies sin
[2:25:34] the rap
[2:25:35] why I can't even do it
[2:25:38] the rap gets where you want to just
[2:25:40] shake your way down to Hell jerking and
[2:25:43] pulling and every step of the way all
[2:25:45] the way down into hell
[2:25:48] trying to numb your conscience
[2:25:51] oh brother Tim that don't affect our
[2:25:53] kids brother Brandon said I don't care
[2:25:55] how good a home a child has been brought
[2:25:58] up in and how it's been taught to do
[2:26:00] right if that child hasn't accepted the
[2:26:02] experience of the new birth rock and
[2:26:04] roll music catches his attention just as
[2:26:07] quick as he hears it because it's in him
[2:26:09] it's born in him by Nature a carnal
[2:26:12] Spirit and the power the devil is so
[2:26:14] great today till it catches the spirit
[2:26:16] of that little one
[2:26:23] and then he said how much more the old
[2:26:26] that is rejected to New Birth
[2:26:29] because
[2:26:31] only as your life has changed and you've
[2:26:33] been converted and Born Again Anew in
[2:26:35] the kingdom of God your nature will
[2:26:37] still be of the things of the world no
[2:26:39] matter how religious you are unless
[2:26:42] that's been changed in you
[2:26:45] you can worship and be religious and
[2:26:47] still and still that will have some kind
[2:26:50] of drawing power to you because the old
[2:26:53] man of sin and his desires is not dead
[2:26:56] yet
[2:26:57] but just let Christ one time take the
[2:27:01] Throne of your heart those things don't
[2:27:02] bother you anymore amen because it's so
[2:27:06] much greater
[2:27:07] and I just want to say to the wounded to
[2:27:10] the broken to the weary to the turn my
[2:27:13] sin that is chased by the hounds of hell
[2:27:16] that there is a fountain
[2:27:18] a Fountain of Living Water
[2:27:22] that will shield the broken the wounded
[2:27:25] the torn the bleeding
[2:27:31] I know
[2:27:33] I've drank from that Fountain and so
[2:27:35] have many here today
[2:27:37] this deer is always alert watching
[2:27:41] listening for Russell for crackling of
[2:27:45] the leaves
[2:27:47] King let us guard down for a moment
[2:27:51] brother Branham said that compare
[2:27:53] comparing the deer with the man
[2:27:55] thirsting for God there's something
[2:27:57] about a child of God that when you're
[2:27:59] born in the spirit receive the baptism
[2:28:01] of the Holy Ghost
[2:28:02] there's something about that person that
[2:28:05] can sense the enemy
[2:28:07] you can take a mountain when he's taking
[2:28:09] the scripture and reading the scripture
[2:28:11] and then tries to inject something that
[2:28:13] scripture that's contrary to to the
[2:28:15] scripture a man filled with the Holy
[2:28:17] Ghost can sense that right quick there's
[2:28:20] something out of the way when he gets
[2:28:22] into a place and that certain little
[2:28:24] sense in there it's done to protect your
[2:28:27] life you must never go for anything
[2:28:30] except it's exactly with the word and
[2:28:33] and because we're secured with that
[2:28:35] sense as long as we're in the Holy
[2:28:37] Spirit
[2:28:39] and brother random gave examples like
[2:28:41] that he said you can go for existence
[2:28:43] somebody said well I read that I I go
[2:28:46] read in Mark 16 these signs and follow
[2:28:48] them that believe in my name they said
[2:28:50] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[2:28:52] new tongues or take up serpents or drink
[2:28:54] deadly things it would not harm them if
[2:28:56] they lay hands on the sick they shall
[2:28:57] recover and then you find a person get
[2:29:00] up there and say now that was for the
[2:29:01] apostolic age
[2:29:04] that right quick if you receive the Holy
[2:29:07] Spirit you've been endowed with that
[2:29:09] sense
[2:29:10] it sets out there's something wrong
[2:29:12] there they try to explain it away that
[2:29:15] it's for another day that really you
[2:29:17] don't need those things today but Jesus
[2:29:20] said these signs shall follow them that
[2:29:23] believe
[2:29:24] so there's something in there that sets
[2:29:26] off in you a little better than knowing
[2:29:29] that's wrong and it's a way of death
[2:29:35] Hallelujah I'm glad to have that kind of
[2:29:38] buzzer on the inside
[2:29:40] remember when you hear things like that
[2:29:42] that Christ isn't the same that the Holy
[2:29:44] Ghost still isn't real that we don't
[2:29:46] believe in prayer lines anymore or altar
[2:29:48] calls it all of that's in the past
[2:29:50] that's a blesser goes off
[2:29:53] a warning goes off
[2:29:55] amen you know that you're about to be
[2:29:58] leapt upon and drive you there into the
[2:30:01] snare of the devil
[2:30:04] and God puts a warning on the inside of
[2:30:06] you gout yes
[2:30:10] brother Branham said in the Third Exodus
[2:30:12] he spoke about Joseph's brothers who
[2:30:14] thought that they would never need that
[2:30:17] old dreamer brother of theirs
[2:30:19] they wanted to get they wanted to get
[2:30:22] rid of the gifts
[2:30:25] and that's the reason of it now he said
[2:30:27] they thought they'd never have a need of
[2:30:30] it we don't need speaker with tongues we
[2:30:33] don't need interpreters in tongues we
[2:30:35] don't need the the Old Testament
[2:30:37] prophets to set us in order by the Holy
[2:30:39] Spirit we understand that they have
[2:30:41] abducted a man-made system to take the
[2:30:44] place of the Holy Spirit therefore
[2:30:46] there's a people that's elected
[2:30:49] amen the hazard names of the Lamb's Book
[2:30:52] of Life they can't go for that their
[2:30:56] spiritual minded and therefore they
[2:30:58] can't go for that they can't stand it no
[2:31:00] matter if their fathers and mothers was
[2:31:03] lived in that whatever organizational
[2:31:04] Church
[2:31:08] you know I nobody has a right to add to
[2:31:11] this word or take from it
[2:31:13] what we've seen God do in the prophets
[2:31:15] Ministry we ought to know is real and
[2:31:18] it's for us today
[2:31:20] a man that not one scripture should we
[2:31:23] part from we should take it the way it's
[2:31:25] written for God watches over his word
[2:31:27] you believe that amen see he said no
[2:31:30] matter what the church would say what
[2:31:32] anybody else would say if you're born of
[2:31:34] the spirit of God you become a part of
[2:31:37] the Bible
[2:31:38] you see because you become the word as
[2:31:40] you receive the word as God told Ezekiel
[2:31:43] the prophet take the scroll and eat it
[2:31:45] then the prophet in the scroll became a
[2:31:47] part of each other
[2:31:49] brother I can't deny Mark 16 it is who I
[2:31:53] am
[2:31:54] I can't this I cannot deny Divine
[2:31:58] Healing it is who I am amen I cannot
[2:32:01] deny the miraculous the Living God
[2:32:04] that's who I am amen I have taken of
[2:32:07] this word and when someone tries to
[2:32:09] separate you from that a little buzzer
[2:32:12] goes off right quick
[2:32:14] to warn you death is on the road
[2:32:18] amen
[2:32:19] but I'm going to tell you the elect will
[2:32:21] not be deceived
[2:32:23] because the holy spirit is on the inside
[2:32:25] there to warn them
[2:32:28] amen that's why you heard some of you
[2:32:30] even recently heard the word saying come
[2:32:32] out of her my people
[2:32:35] amen that you not be partakers of that
[2:32:38] see what is the devil trying to do to
[2:32:40] trap you and to keep you from your
[2:32:43] freedom
[2:32:44] where you're giving this old stagnated
[2:32:47] water
[2:32:48] from a polluted stream to pin you up in
[2:32:52] some organizational Doctrine nicolete
[2:32:55] and spirit
[2:32:56] to Overlord over you and hold you in a
[2:32:59] pen until the day of Slaughter
[2:33:02] and the church
[2:33:04] has become perverted until
[2:33:06] it's a lodge
[2:33:08] a Place full of every unclean and
[2:33:11] hateful bird
[2:33:12] unchanged
[2:33:14] sinful people who are trying to fill a
[2:33:18] religious Thirst by dutifully going to
[2:33:21] church
[2:33:22] and there they get their coffee and
[2:33:24] donuts and a feel-good sermonette from a
[2:33:26] preacherette
[2:33:29] church is a place where people come
[2:33:31] together and worship God in spirit and
[2:33:34] in truth
[2:33:36] now some only want truth and no spirit
[2:33:39] and that makes the church only a lodge
[2:33:42] where the word is perverted and reduced
[2:33:45] to an intellectual gospel
[2:33:48] then the church becomes stagnant it
[2:33:51] becomes a cesspool where you can't even
[2:33:53] find Faith anymore well there's no
[2:33:56] living God or his miracles there's no
[2:33:59] healing of the body and no healing or
[2:34:02] salvation for the soul just an
[2:34:04] intellectual acknowledgment of Doctrine
[2:34:07] without life
[2:34:08] and unfortunately that's what has
[2:34:10] happened in many messaged churches
[2:34:14] the Bible said in Jeremiah chapter 2
[2:34:17] verse 13 for my people are committed to
[2:34:20] evils they have forsaken me
[2:34:23] here's the evil they've forsaken me
[2:34:26] hey man you you think oh I we didn't we
[2:34:29] didn't turn away his gifts we didn't
[2:34:31] turn away his miracles we didn't turn
[2:34:33] away uh the the Holy Ghost is given the
[2:34:37] Apostle we hadn't we hadn't we hadn't
[2:34:39] turned that away no you forsook him
[2:34:44] when you did that you forsook him and
[2:34:48] then he said to healed out cisterns
[2:34:50] broken sisters that can hold no water
[2:34:55] and so even if there is a Revival comes
[2:34:58] by once in a while they can't hold it
[2:35:03] Church goes right back to the slump it
[2:35:05] was in you see say that Satan will lead
[2:35:08] you to come to his cesspools of unbelief
[2:35:12] people are hungry and if they don't find
[2:35:14] Food they'll eat from a garbage can
[2:35:18] how many are trapped in churches where
[2:35:20] the word of God is not living but just a
[2:35:23] dead Creed something that you profess to
[2:35:26] believe
[2:35:28] you know and in itself the word creed is
[2:35:30] not bad it just means I believe it's
[2:35:32] what we believe this is what we believe
[2:35:33] but you see if the life of the Holy
[2:35:36] Spirit isn't in you it's just a dead
[2:35:38] Creed
[2:35:39] and it may be the exact truth
[2:35:45] you see there's no reason for that when
[2:35:48] you're thirsting for God because God's a
[2:35:50] living God he's not a historical
[2:35:53] something
[2:35:54] as David said my soul searches after
[2:35:57] thee the Living God something that gives
[2:36:00] Living Waters
[2:36:02] something that satisfies
[2:36:05] The Thirst of the soul is something
[2:36:08] that all Humanity has in common
[2:36:11] man made to thirst after him
[2:36:14] so that no one would have an excuse
[2:36:19] that no one could say but God I never
[2:36:21] thirsted
[2:36:24] and God has said yeah you thirsty for me
[2:36:27] but you satisfied it with other things
[2:36:31] you took substitutes
[2:36:34] that the devil offered in and all staff
[2:36:37] needed water or even the gospel of an
[2:36:40] age past and did not stay in the present
[2:36:43] truth
[2:36:45] brother Branham asked this question he
[2:36:46] said why do you hunger Church why do you
[2:36:49] thirst it's the father trying to reveal
[2:36:52] they send this secret to you but you let
[2:36:55] so many things get it out of you
[2:36:58] you let your job your wife your husband
[2:37:00] your children you let the cares of the
[2:37:02] world you let some Pastor you let
[2:37:03] somebody else get it out of you when you
[2:37:06] know way down in your heart you're
[2:37:07] thirsting you're hungering is God trying
[2:37:11] to reveal to you see the Revelation what
[2:37:14] revelation
[2:37:16] the revelation of Christ personally to
[2:37:18] you
[2:37:20] now you might try to quench that desire
[2:37:22] with other things
[2:37:24] so it could be your spouse
[2:37:27] it could be your car
[2:37:29] it could be some possession could be
[2:37:31] your job it could be Church joining
[2:37:34] it could be belonging to the society or
[2:37:37] the community of Believers and yet
[2:37:41] sit there and never drink
[2:37:43] from that fountain
[2:37:46] belonging to or associating with a good
[2:37:49] group of people that is not the
[2:37:51] satisfaction
[2:37:53] it's to find God the Living God the god
[2:37:56] of Heaven
[2:37:57] and inviting him into your soul because
[2:38:00] only that will satisfy that longing that
[2:38:04] thirsting that you're longing for
[2:38:08] there's a genuine need and a thirst for
[2:38:10] Christian Fellowship absolutely that's
[2:38:13] good we like to be with one another
[2:38:15] we have things in common because we're
[2:38:18] all thirsting for God
[2:38:20] you know there's something that that
[2:38:22] should be in common with everyone that
[2:38:25] has come in this building today is is we
[2:38:27] all have the same thing a common desire
[2:38:30] a thirst
[2:38:32] embarrassed I want to see the Living God
[2:38:36] I want to see him in his power I want to
[2:38:39] see him in his glory I don't have me a
[2:38:42] historical God a god of history but I'll
[2:38:45] bring him out of history and bringing
[2:38:47] present tense
[2:38:53] the Bible said
[2:38:54] in first John 1 and 7 but if you walk in
[2:38:57] the light is he is the light we have
[2:38:59] Fellowship one with another and the
[2:39:01] blood of Jesus Christ of his son
[2:39:04] cleanses us
[2:39:06] from all sin
[2:39:09] sometimes
[2:39:10] a deer like this one will be out there
[2:39:12] by himself
[2:39:16] you wander off himself
[2:39:19] all alone
[2:39:21] that's always dangerous
[2:39:25] I tell you that's always dangerous
[2:39:27] you see you see there he's got two eyes
[2:39:31] two ears
[2:39:33] but if you had a companion he'd have
[2:39:35] four eyes and four years
[2:39:37] if he had six around him that would be
[2:39:40] more
[2:39:41] they're all watching listening
[2:39:44] warning
[2:39:46] and brother Bradham said that deer will
[2:39:48] wander off to himself
[2:39:50] that's a real place to get one
[2:39:54] he said that's why I think sometimes
[2:39:56] God's Little Deer sometimes wander off
[2:39:59] from the fold they might be some here
[2:40:02] tonight that's wandered away from the
[2:40:04] protection of the church from the
[2:40:06] protection of loved ones who pray for
[2:40:08] you and help you to come back to God to
[2:40:10] keep you straight to come to church and
[2:40:12] listen the gospel there may be some in
[2:40:14] radio land that's wandered away but this
[2:40:16] little deer wanting to wander out from
[2:40:18] the plot where she had protection away
[2:40:20] from the church where she gets in the
[2:40:22] Holy Spirit through the preaching of the
[2:40:24] word we're washed to the water of the
[2:40:27] word and then you get away and start
[2:40:28] staying home from church
[2:40:31] watching television
[2:40:33] all with tonight or when you go to
[2:40:36] prayer meetings going on and you're on
[2:40:38] your he said you're on your road when
[2:40:40] you've got prayer meetings going on then
[2:40:41] right then you're you're on your road
[2:40:43] out when your desires have become more
[2:40:46] to see some television program than it
[2:40:48] is to hear the gospel there's something
[2:40:50] wrong in the soul
[2:40:52] God Made You So you thirst for it
[2:40:56] now
[2:40:58] part of that thirst
[2:41:00] is even fulfilled in fellowship and with
[2:41:02] his children
[2:41:06] The Book of Proverbs speaks of fools
[2:41:11] or stupid people
[2:41:16] stupid people itself refuse to turn away
[2:41:19] from evil
[2:41:21] said keep company with the wise and
[2:41:24] you'll become wise
[2:41:26] you know like brother Kenneth told his
[2:41:28] family keep coming to church
[2:41:31] if you ain't going to church start and
[2:41:34] if you're in church state
[2:41:36] that was instructions of a man as he
[2:41:39] would leave for Glory
[2:41:41] and so you know keep company the Bible
[2:41:43] said with the wise and you become wise
[2:41:46] and you make friends with stupid people
[2:41:48] you'll will be ruined
[2:41:52] Trouble Follows Sinners everywhere
[2:41:55] that's why you don't want to you know
[2:41:58] keep a lot of company with Sinners oh
[2:42:01] Jesus did yeah he did to bring them out
[2:42:05] he didn't do it to play their games and
[2:42:07] to live their lives and to party with
[2:42:10] them somebody help me preach now he did
[2:42:12] them to show them the way of life
[2:42:17] the Trouble Follows Sinners everywhere
[2:42:20] so why do you want to be in their
[2:42:22] Calamity and their trouble because their
[2:42:24] trouble will bring trouble on you
[2:42:28] righteous people will be rewarded with
[2:42:30] good things
[2:42:31] so for the righteous good things follow
[2:42:34] I want to be among people where good
[2:42:36] things are happening I mean I want my
[2:42:39] friends to be friends where good things
[2:42:41] are happening what God is moving where
[2:42:44] prayers are being answered amen where
[2:42:46] lives are changed we're we're a Godly
[2:42:49] instruction comes
[2:42:52] be careful Who Your Friends Are
[2:42:55] brother Brandon was asked what kind of
[2:42:57] activities our kids could have he said
[2:42:59] keep them in Christian company
[2:43:02] he didn't say well you can you can rent
[2:43:04] the skate ring or you can do this and
[2:43:06] you can do that and I'll give you some
[2:43:08] other things you can do and yeah you can
[2:43:10] play UNO but not whatever the mother
[2:43:12] cards are I never played them but anyway
[2:43:15] you can play this but you can't play
[2:43:16] that and he didn't say he said keep them
[2:43:21] in Christian company
[2:43:25] be careful Who Your Friends Are
[2:43:29] you say well it's my brother it's my
[2:43:31] sister it's my Kinfolk they ain't your
[2:43:33] friends
[2:43:34] if they're not leading you to
[2:43:36] righteousness if you see the rewards of
[2:43:39] their life is evil they are not your
[2:43:42] friends
[2:43:45] amen now so you see the Bible tells you
[2:43:48] in Second Corinthians 6 14 be you not
[2:43:51] eat clear unequally yoked together with
[2:43:54] believe unbelievers for what Fellowship
[2:43:58] what Fellowship
[2:44:00] have righteousness with unrighteousness
[2:44:04] and what communion of light with
[2:44:07] darkness and what Concord or Harmony
[2:44:10] hath Christ with billion or what part
[2:44:14] has ye that believeth with an infidel
[2:44:18] and that's not just an atheist that's
[2:44:21] someone who adheres to a different
[2:44:23] religion
[2:44:29] if you think of John
[2:44:31] 737 you can put that scripture up for me
[2:44:34] please
[2:44:36] the Bible
[2:44:38] speaks of these
[2:44:42] in his promise he said in the last day
[2:44:45] that great day of the feast I believe
[2:44:48] we're there
[2:44:51] I believe this is the last Church ages
[2:44:54] that this is the last outpouring of the
[2:44:57] spirit amen amen this is the last of the
[2:44:59] last listen if this message don't turn
[2:45:02] your heart back to the faith Ain't
[2:45:03] Nothing Gonna Do It
[2:45:06] amen there's no eight day messenger
[2:45:08] nobody else ain't nothing ever going to
[2:45:10] get come and really turn your heart if
[2:45:13] this message don't do it
[2:45:16] you're not going in the rapture
[2:45:18] sorry
[2:45:20] God sent a message in this day in the
[2:45:23] last great day of the feast and this is
[2:45:25] where we are this is where we come
[2:45:27] what a wonderful feast
[2:45:29] I say what a wonderful feast
[2:45:32] amen it's a seven course menu
[2:45:35] did you know the Seven Seals are open
[2:45:39] amen the Thunders have spoken
[2:45:42] that which was sealed up has now been
[2:45:45] revealed
[2:45:46] do you do you know the book is not
[2:45:49] closed anymore and we're not preaching
[2:45:51] from a closed book and probing and
[2:45:53] wondering what it says but we have the
[2:45:56] gospel restored
[2:46:00] as it was in the days of Paul
[2:46:04] that's why this message is so vital
[2:46:07] that's why we're not go out to try to
[2:46:09] give you a Baptist Jesus or Methodist
[2:46:11] Jesus or you know just pass you a Bible
[2:46:15] and say hey read this and make it
[2:46:21] God sent a message in this day
[2:46:24] specifically designed to turn the hearts
[2:46:28] of their children back to the faith of
[2:46:29] the fathers or else he would just have
[2:46:32] to Smite the whole earth with a curse
[2:46:40] but in the last day Jesus stood and
[2:46:42] cried now he's not weeping he's shouting
[2:46:47] some people say well Jesus he was quiet
[2:46:49] when he gave the sermon sometimes he did
[2:46:53] sometimes the Bible said his voice
[2:46:55] wasn't heard in the streets
[2:46:57] but there was other times that he
[2:46:59] shouted
[2:47:00] you see he was a type of us all there
[2:47:03] are some that are that are equipped and
[2:47:05] they're ministered and maybe they they
[2:47:07] they bring it in a way and it's quiet
[2:47:10] and and it's soft and and whatever else
[2:47:13] that Jesus would speak that time waste
[2:47:15] sometimes and teach the Beatitudes and
[2:47:17] whatever but there's sometimes he
[2:47:19] preached
[2:47:21] and when he did he shouted
[2:47:24] If any man thirst
[2:47:28] I'm the fountain
[2:47:30] let him come to me and Frank
[2:47:34] I've got the water I've got the
[2:47:36] satisfied portion of God what you're
[2:47:39] Desiring
[2:47:41] I got what you won't find in the
[2:47:43] denominations of the day the Pharisees
[2:47:45] the Sadducees the herodians
[2:47:48] the scribes
[2:47:51] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[2:47:54] has said out of his belly or his
[2:47:57] innermost being shall flow rivers of
[2:48:01] Living Water
[2:48:03] so think about it friends you know you
[2:48:05] you get it as he said this speaking of
[2:48:08] the spirit that that they would believe
[2:48:10] on him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[2:48:11] was not yet given for Jesus was not yet
[2:48:14] glorified but you see here he said the
[2:48:16] Holy Ghost when he comes it'll be a
[2:48:19] fountain
[2:48:21] Hallelujah fountain down on the inside
[2:48:24] and it'll gush for us
[2:48:27] amen into
[2:48:30] eternal life
[2:48:34] now the Holy Ghost couldn't come back on
[2:48:36] man until Jesus was crucified
[2:48:38] diet buried rose again ascended of the
[2:48:41] glory because Jesus was the fullness of
[2:48:44] God in a body
[2:48:46] and he sent the Holy Ghost the spirit of
[2:48:48] God back but he's already preaching at
[2:48:51] times
[2:48:53] he's already preaching it and I want to
[2:48:55] tell you different from them it's
[2:48:57] already afforded you today
[2:49:00] amen he that will believe on me that's
[2:49:03] the scripture has said then out of his
[2:49:07] animals being
[2:49:09] shall flow rivers of Living Water
[2:49:13] you know not as the church said not as a
[2:49:17] message believer sages
[2:49:20] resided Creed and say I've joined the
[2:49:22] church and I believe serpent scene
[2:49:24] predestination I believe God's in the
[2:49:27] prophet in that sin it's more than
[2:49:29] believing
[2:49:31] you know again I I want to commend you
[2:49:34] for believing if you believed on the
[2:49:36] Lord I commend you that's a good place
[2:49:37] to start
[2:49:39] he that cometh the God Must Believe
[2:49:42] that he is then he'll reward you that
[2:49:45] diligently seek him but that's only the
[2:49:47] beginnings
[2:49:49] that's not even the Holy Ghost yet the
[2:49:51] Holy Ghost is drawing you and pulling
[2:49:54] you and wooing you
[2:49:57] but in Acts chapter 8
[2:49:59] it was Philip who went to Samaria and he
[2:50:02] preached Christ to them
[2:50:05] and they believed Philip preaching the
[2:50:07] things concerning the kingdom of God and
[2:50:09] the name of Jesus Christ and they were
[2:50:12] even baptized so they believed and were
[2:50:14] baptized both men and women
[2:50:19] not only that but there was a mountain
[2:50:21] there Simon a sorcerer himself believed
[2:50:24] and he too was baptized
[2:50:26] now the Bible said Simon a sorcerer
[2:50:29] believed
[2:50:31] it was still a sorcerer
[2:50:35] you said well I believe the message yeah
[2:50:37] it's still a devil worshiper
[2:50:40] I believe God sent a prophet still live
[2:50:42] in a dirty life
[2:50:44] I believe the message brother Tim ah
[2:50:49] you know that's as far as most message
[2:50:52] preachers will take you anymore
[2:50:54] just believe and get baptized
[2:50:58] just believe and get back oh you you
[2:51:00] accepted serpently you can see that your
[2:51:02] predestinated seek glory to God you're
[2:51:03] going to heaven you're in the rapture
[2:51:07] Simon tried to buy the Holy Ghost with
[2:51:09] money
[2:51:10] and this man who believed and was
[2:51:12] baptized was called out by Peter
[2:51:14] and he said thou has neither pardon nor
[2:51:17] a lot in this matter for thy heart is
[2:51:19] not right in the sight of God but he had
[2:51:21] believed it might baptized and Peter
[2:51:24] said back to your heart ain't right
[2:51:28] so don't just come that far
[2:51:31] I believe
[2:51:33] and accept the message and God's inner
[2:51:36] the prophet and get baptized
[2:51:41] you got to go all the way
[2:51:43] you can't stop
[2:51:45] if that's as far as you go and I commend
[2:51:47] you but you're just Simon the sorcery
[2:51:49] yet you can do that and still be a devil
[2:51:52] worshiper
[2:51:53] still living devices and there's many of
[2:51:56] them that does it on a message pew
[2:52:01] I'm not preaching the Baptist I'm not
[2:52:03] preaching the Presbyterians I'm
[2:52:04] preaching to you
[2:52:08] I do want them to be in heaven
[2:52:11] but I want you in a rapture
[2:52:16] and I'm not preaching for you just to
[2:52:18] barely make it by the skin of your teeth
[2:52:20] and wind up in the wack throwing
[2:52:22] judgment and finally led into eternal
[2:52:24] life and finally get the living water
[2:52:26] and finally quit there's I'm telling you
[2:52:28] there is something right now
[2:52:31] that you can get that satisfied person
[2:52:34] amen that will seal sin out of your life
[2:52:37] and seal the Holy Ghost into you and
[2:52:40] make you ready for a rapture
[2:52:49] I see in you he said are Galla
[2:52:53] bitterness full of bitter jealousy and
[2:52:56] the bond of iniquity and her hell kept
[2:52:59] it by sin that's as far as many goals
[2:53:01] and they become jealous
[2:53:04] next thing you know this is where
[2:53:06] trouble comes in the church
[2:53:08] because still sin is there and bitter
[2:53:11] jealousies rise up and envy and strife
[2:53:15] hatred
[2:53:17] this is where Judas has come up and show
[2:53:19] their colors
[2:53:21] because he stopped short of Pentecost
[2:53:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:53:27] that's the problem with many they
[2:53:29] believed and they've been baptized but
[2:53:31] they're still held captive by sin
[2:53:36] the scripture is there have you received
[2:53:39] the Holy Ghost since you believed
[2:53:42] you can believe but have you received
[2:53:45] this is the question
[2:53:46] you see ah and and I can tell you
[2:53:51] how you can know whether you've received
[2:53:53] or not
[2:53:54] because if you have received it out of
[2:53:58] your innermost being
[2:54:00] flows River of living wire
[2:54:04] glassing up out of the into eternal life
[2:54:07] no more no more will I have to go as a
[2:54:10] pastor and pull you out of sin
[2:54:12] say come back to church try to do right
[2:54:15] do better this time no more
[2:54:17] it'll be there a living fountain
[2:54:22] of blessing stream the continually
[2:54:25] cleans the soul
[2:54:27] purges out the trash
[2:54:30] it won't be me standing there keep the
[2:54:32] law keep the scripture keep the word
[2:54:34] keep the promises don't do this and
[2:54:37] don't do that it'll be the Holy Ghost on
[2:54:39] the inside of you and there he will gush
[2:54:42] up and blow the trash out
[2:54:54] in trials and tests and temptations
[2:54:58] it's still going to Bubble Up
[2:55:03] no I've been through some Temptations
[2:55:05] some trials myself
[2:55:08] I've been through a few
[2:55:11] I've been through some very difficult
[2:55:12] moments some very dark hours but I
[2:55:15] refuse to stay there
[2:55:20] I'm not going to sit around in mourn and
[2:55:22] mourn and cry and mourn and mourn and
[2:55:25] cry why would I do that
[2:55:27] I got a job to do I've got
[2:55:29] responsibility and besides that every
[2:55:32] time that it comes upon me something on
[2:55:34] the inside and bless it out it blows
[2:55:37] away that morning and there comes a
[2:55:39] rejoicing in a joy
[2:55:42] and a Thanksgiving to God
[2:55:48] I know I spent a lot of time already on
[2:55:52] missions
[2:55:53] but I want you to know that he said in
[2:55:55] Ezekiel
[2:55:57] I'll give you a new heart I'll give you
[2:55:59] a new spirit
[2:56:01] and then he said I'll put my spirit in
[2:56:03] you
[2:56:04] brother Branham shows that the new heart
[2:56:06] is on your only your intellects
[2:56:10] and it's a new way of thinking it's God
[2:56:12] enlarging the mind and starting to make
[2:56:14] the word of God be believable
[2:56:17] Jesus talks and said to Nicodemus said
[2:56:21] you know you hear you are a man of the
[2:56:24] scripture and you don't know these
[2:56:25] things well Ezekiel prophesied
[2:56:28] and said I'll tell you what I'm going to
[2:56:30] do with Israel
[2:56:31] there'll come a time they'll get a new
[2:56:33] birth and when they do I'm going to give
[2:56:35] them a new heart
[2:56:37] and I'm going to give them a new spirit
[2:56:39] but I'm going to do more than that
[2:56:41] I'm going to do what I couldn't do in
[2:56:43] the Old Testament
[2:56:44] I'm going to give them my spirit
[2:56:48] you say well why couldn't it well yes he
[2:56:50] could anoint Moses he could anoint in
[2:56:52] that sense be filled with the spirit but
[2:56:54] not like the New Testament
[2:56:56] because under the old Covenant there
[2:56:59] they were there under the blood and
[2:57:01] bulls and goats and it would not take
[2:57:02] away sin and it could not deal with sin
[2:57:05] nature
[2:57:08] because the life of the sacrifice could
[2:57:10] not come back upon the believer it was
[2:57:12] the animal
[2:57:13] but that day on Calvary things changed a
[2:57:17] New Covenant was written and God gave
[2:57:20] his own Holy Spirit the life of the Lamb
[2:57:24] of God to come Amen to take away your
[2:57:27] sin and to dwell within you and give you
[2:57:29] that overcoming power
[2:57:32] so they couldn't live right
[2:57:36] so they were given laws with threats if
[2:57:39] you do this you're stoned if you commit
[2:57:41] adultery we'll take you out if you bear
[2:57:43] false witness I will we'll Stone you
[2:57:45] with stone hey good you and your whole
[2:57:48] family will die
[2:57:49] for take another sacred things
[2:57:52] you took of the tithe that was to belong
[2:57:55] to only to God holy to God and you use
[2:57:58] them for yourself
[2:58:04] because that was the first fruits given
[2:58:06] of the land
[2:58:07] and it was all declared holy
[2:58:11] but you know when you get a new heart
[2:58:14] that's the intellect you think with
[2:58:18] it's a new way of thinking
[2:58:20] you know the Bible looks to be
[2:58:22] reasonable I didn't used to believe it
[2:58:24] that way and it's reasonable I I I I I
[2:58:27] believe it now I I want to accept Christ
[2:58:31] I don't want to go to hell I do realize
[2:58:33] the Bible said there's a a hell to shun
[2:58:36] and I don't want to go there
[2:58:39] well you know this was Billy Graham
[2:58:41] the only thing Billy Graham could give
[2:58:44] was a new heart
[2:58:49] a new way of thinking
[2:58:52] so this was him and his Revival and he
[2:58:55] would invite a rock star or ball star a
[2:58:58] movie star to come up give a testimony
[2:59:01] of how Christ had changed their lives
[2:59:04] and then he would preach and the spirit
[2:59:06] of God would move using that simple
[2:59:09] message and thousands would flock to his
[2:59:12] altars haven't received a new heart
[2:59:17] a new thinking oh the word of God is
[2:59:20] reasonable you know I don't want to go
[2:59:22] to hell I I want to make Heaven my home
[2:59:24] and if a rock star and a movie star or a
[2:59:28] ball star or bigwig thinks it's cool and
[2:59:31] the right thing to do you know I'll
[2:59:33] become a Christian too
[2:59:35] it's chick it's the thing
[2:59:40] but I tell you the holy spirit is not a
[2:59:42] new thought
[2:59:44] but it will give you a new thinking
[2:59:46] it'll change your thoughts
[2:59:48] you see a new thought we can we bring
[2:59:52] that same concept there's many many
[2:59:54] sitting on message pews that are just
[2:59:57] Billy Graham converts
[2:59:59] easy believism
[3:00:01] you see that that that that it just got
[3:00:04] as far as locked
[3:00:07] who buy the skin of his teeth get out of
[3:00:10] Sodom
[3:00:13] you see a new thought
[3:00:15] why you must have your thoughts changed
[3:00:17] why God's doing wonderful things he sent
[3:00:20] a prophet I believe that our seals are
[3:00:22] open I believe it serpent seed makes
[3:00:24] sense what is God doing he's God's
[3:00:27] giving you a new heart
[3:00:30] amen it's necessary that's what said God
[3:00:33] said I will give you a new heart
[3:00:36] and and then
[3:00:40] so we give them knowledge a new the
[3:00:43] intellect knowledge and they receive it
[3:00:46] but that's only the new heart
[3:00:49] let me tell you if you stop there you're
[3:00:52] not fully converted
[3:00:54] you'll wind up in the tribulation
[3:00:56] you're not going to Rapture without the
[3:00:59] token
[3:01:00] are you with me without the Holy Ghost
[3:01:02] this is what Billy Graham did he gave
[3:01:04] people knowledge that Jesus loved them
[3:01:07] that he died for them and they accept
[3:01:10] that knowledge and they believe it but
[3:01:12] what do they have a new heart
[3:01:15] you know what God provided the lamb
[3:01:17] brother Brandon said that's intellectual
[3:01:19] Faith that's what's matter with our
[3:01:20] revivals today whether that's how here's
[3:01:23] how they get it um here's how it is now
[3:01:25] get it Billy Graham Jack Schuler that
[3:01:28] was a Methodist man Mia a great man Oral
[3:01:31] Roberts the great evangelists on the
[3:01:33] field has come this nation back and
[3:01:35] forth and altered calls have been made
[3:01:37] to enough to convert a thousand Americas
[3:01:41] and the reason but the reason it's only
[3:01:44] the people that are brought to a
[3:01:47] intellectual faith
[3:01:50] they would go a little deeper till that
[3:01:53] Faith come from the intellectuals and
[3:01:54] soak down in the soul it would last
[3:01:57] and that's the reason about 80 percent
[3:01:59] or 90 percent of the converts that comes
[3:02:02] in Revival is gone before six months
[3:02:05] is because they only have an
[3:02:07] intellectual conception
[3:02:09] but when it becomes an experience of
[3:02:12] being born again of the spirit of God
[3:02:14] that anchors to Eternity
[3:02:16] and I want to say that's the
[3:02:18] intellectual side of the message now
[3:02:20] it's a new heart
[3:02:22] and certainly it's wonderful
[3:02:25] that the word of God is believable and
[3:02:27] that we gain understanding of the great
[3:02:30] Mysteries but still that isn't it
[3:02:33] Parkinson's would say though I
[3:02:35] understand all Mysteries
[3:02:37] and all knowledge and yet not have
[3:02:40] charity or love that basic element of
[3:02:44] God's nature that comes by the Holy
[3:02:46] Ghost I am nothing
[3:02:50] believe in the message is not enough
[3:02:53] believe in the seals are open the great
[3:02:55] Mysteries is still you can do that with
[3:02:58] just a new heart
[3:03:00] your thinking's changed
[3:03:02] you're still not safe from the hounds of
[3:03:04] hell
[3:03:05] no no
[3:03:06] it'll come in your house with television
[3:03:08] Hollywood dress makeup pornography
[3:03:11] sometimes drugs and alcohol
[3:03:14] slothful lazy lives no desperation no
[3:03:18] sincerity no dedication
[3:03:21] Galloping down every movie that comes
[3:03:23] along and and there it is is because it
[3:03:27] and it shows it shows that The Thirst
[3:03:30] has not been satisfied
[3:03:33] brother Bradham warned us said apply a
[3:03:35] church apply the token don't fail
[3:03:38] don't take no chance it won't work
[3:03:40] children you must have the token you say
[3:03:43] I believe yes I go yeah I believe the
[3:03:45] message that's all that's right and
[3:03:47] that's good but you must have the tokens
[3:03:49] you hear Brandon Tabernacle you must
[3:03:52] have the token displayed
[3:03:54] without it all your listening or
[3:03:57] believing is in vain you live a good
[3:03:58] life you listen to what the word says
[3:04:01] you go to church you try to live right
[3:04:02] that's fine but that's not it when I see
[3:04:05] the blood
[3:04:06] that's the token
[3:04:09] so he said don't just come this far and
[3:04:12] say I believe the message you obey the
[3:04:14] messenger coming to Christ well I
[3:04:16] believe everywhere brother Brown that's
[3:04:18] good
[3:04:19] but that's just being able to read
[3:04:22] take the message
[3:04:24] take it into your heart that you must
[3:04:27] have the token the very light that was
[3:04:30] in Christ being you don't make this hard
[3:04:32] the token is the Holy Ghost you must
[3:04:34] have the Holy Ghost
[3:04:36] and when I see that I will pass over you
[3:04:40] Ah that's the side
[3:04:42] now here's the other side
[3:04:46] the pendulum swings this way
[3:04:49] I'll give you a new spirit
[3:04:52] the new spirit is not the Holy Ghost
[3:04:55] that's when the seed of your emotions
[3:04:57] get cleaned up and makes you shouting
[3:04:59] down
[3:05:01] hello somebody
[3:05:03] amen emotion won't do it
[3:05:08] amen you know you you know an old man
[3:05:10] the old man Pentecostal man told Brother
[3:05:12] about time he said brother brother butts
[3:05:15] if you don't have joy just jump till you
[3:05:17] get it
[3:05:19] you jump all you want to
[3:05:23] yeah I don't give you Joy
[3:05:26] you don't jump to get joy you have joy
[3:05:30] and you jump
[3:05:33] come on I don't jump to get a million
[3:05:35] dollars
[3:05:36] and so I'm working for it
[3:05:39] amen and listen Grace is something you
[3:05:42] don't work for we're not working to get
[3:05:44] it
[3:05:45] but when we get it hallelujah it's
[3:05:47] something to shout about
[3:05:49] [Applause]
[3:05:53] and people make to make the mistake
[3:05:56] they'll come in a prayer line the first
[3:05:58] thing to do is start jumping and they
[3:06:00] ain't got nothing yet and they jump
[3:06:02] through the prayer line and jump right
[3:06:04] out of it and jump back to their seat
[3:06:06] and um
[3:06:08] next survival they gotta jump again
[3:06:13] my brother Tim why why would you bring
[3:06:16] something like this up we love to jump
[3:06:18] well hey I'd love for you to jump I'd
[3:06:21] love for you to shout I love for you to
[3:06:22] run the aisles
[3:06:24] but I mean you know don't let it just
[3:06:26] become a farm
[3:06:28] that this is just what we do with
[3:06:30] evening light Tabernacle
[3:06:33] amen this is a custom if it is your
[3:06:36] drink drinking from a stagnated stream
[3:06:40] amen do it because it's something
[3:06:42] bubbling up on the inside of you
[3:06:45] and it's giant speakable and it's full
[3:06:48] of Glory
[3:06:49] and really I believe that's why most of
[3:06:51] you shout and jump and and rejoice
[3:06:54] but you have people sometimes
[3:06:57] that they think that's what you got to
[3:06:58] do listen what you've got to do is meet
[3:07:01] the person of Jesus Christ
[3:07:06] amen amen something that takes over
[3:07:09] every fighter of your being
[3:07:11] amen something that makes you on the
[3:07:14] inside change from the inside out and
[3:07:18] makes you love the Lord with all your
[3:07:20] heart with all your soul with all your
[3:07:21] being
[3:07:25] you see you can take a substitute of an
[3:07:28] intellectual Faith or you can take a
[3:07:30] substitute of emotion
[3:07:33] but until that genuine baptism of the
[3:07:36] Holy Ghost satisfies every fiber and
[3:07:39] longing in a human soul
[3:07:43] there's people that actually live on
[3:07:45] emotion
[3:07:48] you know
[3:07:50] that that was the Pentecostal side
[3:07:53] this is a movement many of them you know
[3:07:57] they you know always you know it's
[3:07:59] clapping their hands and playing the
[3:08:01] music and patting their feet and you
[3:08:03] know and then
[3:08:04] and it's all by the music you know and a
[3:08:07] work up and it just becomes a habit
[3:08:10] and he let it stop and bucket of the
[3:08:13] water pours over them
[3:08:15] see and it's just become accustomed see
[3:08:18] it's a form of godliness
[3:08:22] and yet lacks the power of a living God
[3:08:24] that brings a changed life
[3:08:27] amen that's why it ain't about you jump
[3:08:30] into somebody you're living different
[3:08:33] it ain't about how you can explain to me
[3:08:36] the seals that's living different it
[3:08:38] ain't about you having all the knowledge
[3:08:40] you're having all the gifts is living
[3:08:42] different we want to see that life
[3:08:44] life-giving water
[3:08:47] bubbling out of your life
[3:08:52] thirsting for a living God until ever
[3:08:54] Fiverr now you might speak in tongues
[3:08:57] you might dance you might not you may
[3:08:59] shout I you know you amen you're going
[3:09:02] to shout
[3:09:03] I said you're going to shout
[3:09:06] you're going to have to do something
[3:09:08] amen because job said amen back there he
[3:09:11] said God said I saw you shouting
[3:09:15] Hallelujah the children of God shout
[3:09:18] because there's a victory in their life
[3:09:20] they shout because God is that healer
[3:09:24] they shout because the Lost comes to
[3:09:26] Christ they shout we are here in time
[3:09:29] doing what he saw us do in eternity
[3:09:34] you know there again
[3:09:37] you don't want it just the emotional
[3:09:39] side where you just have church religion
[3:09:41] and you get out next day is
[3:09:44] well are you a Christian well I don't
[3:09:46] know did you are you I don't know
[3:09:49] are you are you I'll tell you what
[3:09:56] because the emotion's gone
[3:09:59] it only lasted for a moment
[3:10:01] you want the River of Life down on the
[3:10:04] inside of you
[3:10:05] that what are your work or whether
[3:10:07] you're at school or whether I know it'll
[3:10:10] work in school
[3:10:11] come on you say it won't work there
[3:10:13] among the unbelievably it will I went to
[3:10:17] school with spoken word books under my
[3:10:19] arms I went to school as a living
[3:10:21] testimony
[3:10:23] I went to school with Joey unspeakable
[3:10:25] and full of glory and sharing it with my
[3:10:28] classmates
[3:10:31] it'll work in school it'll work on your
[3:10:34] job
[3:10:35] it works everywhere
[3:10:37] God wants you to take something Beyond
[3:10:40] just an impersonation of Christianity
[3:10:43] into a hidden life with Christ for the
[3:10:45] world and sin is cut off
[3:10:48] so he says I will put my spirit in you
[3:10:53] now I give you a new heart
[3:10:56] I've taught you how to be baptized
[3:10:59] I give you a new heart the seals are
[3:11:02] open the Mysteries are revealed the
[3:11:03] truth said the word serpent seed and
[3:11:06] Jesus loves you all of those things are
[3:11:08] yours new heart I give you a new spirit
[3:11:12] a motion shouting Jolly unspeakable
[3:11:16] but what I want to do is I also want to
[3:11:19] put within you he said my spirit
[3:11:23] and when I put my spirit in you it will
[3:11:25] cause you to walk in my stretches and
[3:11:28] you shall keep in my judgment and not
[3:11:30] only that but you will dwell in the land
[3:11:32] and that's what we want to do we want to
[3:11:34] dwell in the land of the Bible
[3:11:37] in the land of Truth
[3:11:40] now as we go into this
[3:11:43] I'm going to skip a bunch of things
[3:11:45] because I'm already holding you along
[3:11:47] with everything else
[3:11:50] this water is an endless supply
[3:11:55] and the bread has it
[3:11:57] goes in revelation 22 17 and the spirit
[3:12:00] of the Bride say come
[3:12:04] and let him that heareth come
[3:12:06] and let him that as a thirst come and
[3:12:10] whosoever will let him take on the Water
[3:12:13] of Life freely
[3:12:18] Jesus said
[3:12:19] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[3:12:22] and he that believeth on me shall never
[3:12:23] thirst
[3:12:26] this is his promise
[3:12:28] this is promised to us as believers
[3:12:31] now
[3:12:34] We Come to the River
[3:12:36] The Living Waters
[3:12:37] it's more than a substitute
[3:12:42] it's not a stagnant cistern of something
[3:12:45] they had

[3:16:30] going to pay your debt
[3:16:32] well I'll tell you what all of a sudden
[3:16:34] you'd have peace
[3:16:39] all of a sudden you could sleep at night
[3:16:42] you know all of a sudden there would be
[3:16:44] emotion
[3:16:45] that would be tears
[3:16:48] that would even be some shouting going
[3:16:50] on
[3:16:51] amen that would be rejoice and my dad
[3:16:53] just got paid
[3:16:55] my dad is paid here I wasn't hot here I
[3:16:59] was in trouble and this friend of mine
[3:17:02] this rich man yeah I tell you my debt's
[3:17:06] been paid there's been a weight lifted
[3:17:09] off of my shoulders you could go
[3:17:11] skipping down the streets and meeting
[3:17:13] everybody shaking their hands or even
[3:17:15] look at everybody it don't matter if
[3:17:17] it's a former creditor he's paying
[3:17:21] you're not hiding nowhere you're not
[3:17:24] afraid to take a phone call you're not
[3:17:26] checking your emails for threatening
[3:17:28] letter
[3:17:29] you're getting you you know you you know
[3:17:32] it's all paid
[3:17:36] and you can go and make a new life
[3:17:42] now let this sink in
[3:17:44] and you
[3:17:46] can even go and make new debts
[3:17:53] even though that the one pager death
[3:17:56] became your savior to save you from loss
[3:17:58] you stood still wouldn't have his life
[3:18:01] or his nature
[3:18:03] and there are many people that say God
[3:18:05] save me from my sins and I've accepted
[3:18:08] Jesus as my savior they feel emotion and
[3:18:11] there's a big burden lifted and they go
[3:18:14] back and make more sin depth
[3:18:18] because the life and the nature and the
[3:18:21] character of the Dead payer has never
[3:18:24] came into their life
[3:18:28] and that's what's lacking in the
[3:18:30] Christian world today
[3:18:32] they've accepted Christ as their savior
[3:18:34] they washed the robes in the blood of
[3:18:36] the Lamb they've done works of
[3:18:37] sanctification but they lack his life
[3:18:43] and that's why
[3:18:45] the spiritual life is stagnant there's
[3:18:48] no outflow of the Holy Ghost you have to
[3:18:51] become Living Waters
[3:18:56] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[3:18:59] has said
[3:19:01] out of his innermost being
[3:19:03] to flow rivers of Living Water
[3:19:07] what's the matter today
[3:19:09] as I bring this down to clothes and we
[3:19:12] try to bring it close
[3:19:15] what's all wrong with so many churches
[3:19:17] in the land today so many people
[3:19:20] what is clogging up the blessings
[3:19:24] we accept the Theology of the blood as a
[3:19:27] sub as a substitute and not born of its
[3:19:30] life
[3:19:31] to become a son of God
[3:19:34] Christ's blood is to be more than a
[3:19:36] substitute
[3:19:38] he is our sin offering he surely paid
[3:19:40] our debt but in this glorious Covenant
[3:19:42] there's more than just receiving money
[3:19:44] from the rich man
[3:19:47] amen but it's real you can receive the
[3:19:49] life of that rich man the kinsman
[3:19:53] redeemer who was not only Rich enough to
[3:19:56] pay your debt but the debt of every man
[3:19:58] in the world
[3:20:01] and then he'll take your depths and put
[3:20:03] him in the sea of his forgetfulness and
[3:20:05] make you Son of God a son or God and
[3:20:08] where you have the little life of Jesus
[3:20:11] Christ that returns back upon you as a
[3:20:13] believer
[3:20:15] you'll have the rich man living on the
[3:20:17] inside of you
[3:20:18] and out of his riches
[3:20:21] will be Abundant Life
[3:20:24] and it will not be a patch of life or a
[3:20:27] turning of a new Leaf for making a
[3:20:29] pledge but a new creation
[3:20:35] but the only way you can do that
[3:20:38] is for the old dead pen
[3:20:40] man and death to die
[3:20:44] that old sin nature has to die
[3:20:48] we don't live in you no more
[3:20:52] that one that made you a Slave
[3:20:55] that put you in debt
[3:20:57] that ran up your bill
[3:21:02] and the one who has all the riches of
[3:21:05] Eternity
[3:21:06] sit on the throne of your heart
[3:21:13] be in filled with divine nature
[3:21:16] if you can't stay out of debt
[3:21:20] you might have had since past forgiven
[3:21:25] but only when that man Christ Jesus
[3:21:28] comes in
[3:21:29] can you have the life
[3:21:31] to live an overcoming life
[3:21:36] now as I'm closing
[3:21:41] let the musicians come
[3:21:44] was a man
[3:21:46] he had struck it rich
[3:21:49] you've been out
[3:21:50] he was a gold miner and he got a good
[3:21:52] claim
[3:21:54] he had sackfuls of gold
[3:21:57] heavy heavy as he packed him there back
[3:22:01] toward town and he's thinking when I get
[3:22:03] to town when I get back to the city I'm
[3:22:06] gonna be rich
[3:22:09] I'm going to live it up all my hard work
[3:22:11] will be over my troubles everything else
[3:22:13] I'm going to live it I'm going to live
[3:22:15] it up
[3:22:20] and he sat by his campfire on the way
[3:22:22] home that night trying to sleep
[3:22:27] his dog begins to bark
[3:22:32] shut up
[3:22:35] shut up
[3:22:38] tomorrow I'm going to be rich
[3:22:41] tomorrow I'll be wealthy tomorrow
[3:22:46] I'll have everything
[3:22:48] I've got this gold and I get it and cash
[3:22:50] it in put it in the bank and I can draw
[3:22:52] I'll have it shut up don't
[3:22:57] the dog box again
[3:23:00] I said shut up
[3:23:03] quit barking
[3:23:04] I'm rich don't you know
[3:23:07] now I'm Mr so-and-so I was a poor old
[3:23:10] man but now
[3:23:12] I'm wealthy I'm going home I'm going to
[3:23:14] town I'm gonna Live It Up
[3:23:18] he lays back down the dog box again
[3:23:23] I don't need no dog
[3:23:26] what I need a dog I'm rich
[3:23:30] why do I need that
[3:23:33] he drew his gun and shot the dog
[3:23:37] killed it
[3:23:39] lay back down to sleep
[3:23:43] and while he's sleeping
[3:23:45] what the dog was warning him about was
[3:23:48] someone who'd been on his Trail
[3:23:52] and was coming up close
[3:23:55] and he shot the voice that was worn in
[3:23:57] him
[3:24:03] and he paid
[3:24:04] the consequences
[3:24:07] with his life
[3:24:10] what am I trying to say don't shoot the
[3:24:13] voice
[3:24:15] Don't Stop The Voice

[3:47:52] Grace said
[3:47:59] [Music]
[3:48:02] all right you know as I said
[3:48:04] as I was preaching today how that sin
[3:48:08] and the wrong kind of things the wrong
[3:48:11] kind of music and whatever will catch a
[3:48:14] child just that quick you know if you
[3:48:18] don't teach them another whether it's
[3:48:20] what whatever's right or wrong it'll
[3:48:23] catch them just like that
[3:48:25] but you know the gospel also will catch
[3:48:27] him
[3:48:28] and that's the beauty part of it we're
[3:48:30] not left defenseless
[3:48:33] amen but we have we know there's a power
[3:48:36] of the Gospel to go forth and to change
[3:48:38] lives
[3:48:39] and you know Judah has come wanting to
[3:48:43] be baptized I understand the other night
[3:48:47] in the service the Lord moved on his
[3:48:49] heart our brother Joe was Minister and
[3:48:52] that was a wonderful service and we
[3:48:54] thank God
[3:48:55] so now we have our little brother Judah
[3:48:59] that has come to the Lord and he wants
[3:49:01] to be baptized taking on the name of the
[3:49:03] Lord we had prayer with him down at the
[3:49:04] altar a moment ago
[3:49:06] Judah the Lord Jesus sent me to the
[3:49:10] gospel into the world to preach the
[3:49:12] gospel to baptize those who believed on
[3:49:15] the Lord and to baptize them as he
[3:49:17] commanded
[3:49:19] using the name of the father and of the
[3:49:21] son and of the Holy Ghost and in
[3:49:23] obedience to that Divine command I
[3:49:26] baptize you in the name of the Lord
