of the very end of this whole civilization and lord as we think back and we look at israel lord many years ago how lord you rose up a hitler in a mussolini in a different one and your prophet would say it was a tender hand of jehovah calling his people go back into a homeland and father we see this rising up in this rising up it could be nothing less but the tender hand of jehovah preparing a body lord of bride to go into that homeland or body change or rapture lord there will be no more suffering no more anxieties no more pressures of life but lord it will be eternal bliss as your prophet would say it would be sublime lord we just ask tonight lord as we have our arms and our hands praying for our neighbor you know what they're going through father each of us face our own our own

we look forward to a positive report lord we believe that for brother jonathan tonight you'll restore us back father he'll walk out of this service tonight without any symptoms or any ailments or any

commit this service to you lord you see brother timothy has been on a series here of late lord a wonderful series on casting down imagination surely lord the greatest battle is raging but you gave us

lord we're so thankful today that you're our god you're our savior we appreciate you lord with all of our heart ass lord you bless his servants father help us to step out of the way we pray in jesus name amen amen let's turn to second corinthians 10 and verse 3. also you can turn to psalms 23. see to remember me and sister ruth will be leaving tomorrow heading to into ohio to minister there this weekend so i just appreciate your prayers for that second corinthians 10 and verse 3 it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ also psalms 23 and verse 1. says hear the lord i'm sure we could no doubt quote this by heart the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i'll walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemy thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever amen we let you be seated today a man [Music] named henry ward beecher was cited by charles spurgeon speaking about the psalms 23 said it psalms 23 has charmed more griefs to rest than all the philosophy of the world it has remained remanded reprimanded to the redundance more thoughts more black doubts more thieving sorrows than there are sands on the seashore it has comforted the noble host of the poor it has sung courage to the army of the disappointed it has poured bomb and consolation into the heart of the sick the captives and dungeons the widows and their griefs the orphans and their loneliness dying soldiers have died easier as it was read to them ghastly hospitals have been illuminated it has visited the prisoner it has broken his chains and like peter's angels led him forth and sung him back to his home again it has made the dying christian slave freer than his master and has consoled those whom dying he left behind mourning not so much that he was gone but because they were left behind and could not go to what a wonderful scripture what a comfort you can pull in times from this scripture and as we've been speaking on casting down imaginations you know one thing david laid right at the beginning is the lord is my shepherd is not might be or may be or could be the lord is my shepherd and since the lord is my shepherd he will provide for me he will take care of me he will protect me he will save me he will heal me he will deliver me and and looking at casting down imaginations and we've been speaking about the greatest bout through the taking many thoughts from the greatest battle ever thought or ever fought but looking at this one part of this scripture the fifth verse it says thou has anointed my head with all now we know david as he was a a king as he would write this but one day before he was a shepherd and the scripture speaks of him a little shepherd boy tending his father's sheep and so he knew what it would take to take care of sheep and what they had to have and what they needed and and he would take this and bring it to his life as a as a king under the under the rulership of god and and looking at this you anoint my head with oil i begin to look at that and begin to think on it as what that would mean and and considered in the natural as far as to a sheep and i found this that would speak about in grazing time that was a prime season for all kind of bugs and insects and this presented a serious problem for the shepherd and his sheep there's a list of pests that's almost endless and we know no in louisiana as far as the bugs and my goodness it's almost endless there's a war warble flies and bot flies and hill flies every kind of fly that would aggravate the sheep as they would try to graze but the most the worst kind was a type of fly it's called the nose fly that would actually lay an egg in the mucous membrane lining of the sheep's nose and when it hatched that larva would begin to bar burrow into the sheep's flesh getting into the under their skin until it would cause intense inflammation and irritation and these parasites became so annoying that the sheep would beat their heads against the rocks and trees to try and find relief and so to counteract that this at the first sign of flies the shepherd would apply this homemade remedy they had in that day of maybe some linseed oil or sulfur and tar and they and it was an ancient equivalent to insect repellent and they would they would place it upon the sheep's head and and and then you know as a sheep a behavior of a sheep that that that would require the application of the oil and you know that the goat's sheep they have this tendency you know to be affectionate to one another and even to their shepherd and a sheep will often rub their heads with one another in a way of saying how you doing you know that kind of thing with sheep sheep talk but if one sheep was infected it could impass that infection onto the other sheep and so knowing this danger the sheep shepherd would restrain his sheep from a new field and and they would begin to mix up this oil that they would begin to get ready and but before he would even move him to a field he would walk up and down looking for a little small holes that may be in the field and he would take this bottle this thick of this bottle of thick oil from his belt and he'd rake back the long grass of the staff and he'd pour a circle of wall around each of these little holes now these little holes were snake holes and he would put this all around each hole that he would find and before he would lead his sheep into the new green field he would also spread this oil over each sheep's head in the sense he was anointing them or rubbing their heads with his oil and when the snakes beneath the surface would begin to see it sense the presence of the sheep and attempt to maybe come out and attack they were unable to do so because of the oil that was placed over their hole they went unable to come out and became essentially prisoners inside their own hole amen the oil on the sheep's head acts as a repellent so the snake if a snake does manage to come near it would the repellent would help even drive them away so in the very literal sense of all of this by oiling the snakes burrow by putting on their heads amen the shepherd had prepared the table or the meadow for the sheep to graze right in the abundance of all kind of enemies laying right beneath them amen so we know and we know in the scripture that all is symbolic of the holy spirit amen and so we also have this same anointing that's been afforded to us in this day amen and here we are in the worst ages ever been with the worst snakes has ever been the worst poisonous snakes there's ever been satan coming with his last blows with his last breath and god has prepared us a table to eat at even in the presence of our own enemies and satan's own eden is going to become a trap for him amen for his destruction that that it as for his my demise amen so stab it standing between us and that old worm the devil amen it tries to bore his way through many avenues of reasonings and doubts and confusions but that anointing is standing there between us and the enemy and it is the anointing that breaks the yoke off the of off of our lives amen this is what isaiah was saying isaiah 10 and verse 27 he said it came to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off of his shoulder and the yoke off of thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing amen because of the anointing i'm thankful god didn't leave us without any anointing in this age that the holy spirit is still here working amen the same oil of god is still in the lamp stands it's still burning amen with the same fire lit by the fire of god burning in every heart that will receive it amen burning in every life that will receive it amen amen burning is a fire burning in our hearts now i want you to know something in the difference between an animal and you amen we'll get into this even a little later amen the sheep didn't have no choice the sheep they would have to take whatever the shepherd would give it if the shepherd would want to come and put the oil on his head the sheep may run for a little bit but sooner or later would get caught and the shepherd would have to that sheep couldn't say yes or no but we as humans have the ability amen to say yes or no amen amen you know brother tim has brought this out before with goats you know if he seen a goat that was sick or or was or sitting off to itself and wasn't doing right he would look and check certain signs and see what it needs and by what he saw he'd go into the cabinet he'd get the medicine he'd come i helped him many times we'd grab the goat didn't ask a question then ask it if it felt like taking the medicine if he wanted to take the medicine if it don't want if it wanted to wait tomorrow then ask it one question we grabbed it by the head opened his mouth and put it down his throat but that's not how we as humans are amen amen it takes the la the the holy ghost can come into a building but it's up to us to receive it it's up to us to say yes lord i want that in my life i want you to have preeminence on my mind on my heart on my thoughts amen god can anoint he can bring the anointing into the building but it takes every heart saying yes lord i want part of that i want you to pour it out upon my life amen and so we see the holy spirit though comes amen to stand between us and our thoughts amen to stand between us and the thing that old worm that tries to board in now we see the world i mean the world is being bored amen with every kind of demonic thing amen their minds are being taken over they're they're being taken over by a strong delusion their their minds are insanity and complete insanity you see the world being taken off even our even our own our own country been taken over by complete insanity amen and it's only going to get worse and worse as it goes along amen but god has allowed us to have something in this life amen the holy ghost that can keep you sane in an insane world it can keep you with a reality that goes beyond the things of this life and this world that we're living in is so far beyond that but to keep you amen to have a have a stabilized life i mean to be able to be stable in the time that we're living in is a miracle amen to be able to have a mind amen that can think straight they can that can i can move straight is a miracle in the time that we're living in amen because the world is going completely insane amen even james would talk about the oil he said if any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church let them pray over you anointing him with all in the name of the lord what is this it is this is a symbol of the holy ghost that stands between you and the sickness we're placing it between you and the sickness hallelujah and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he has committed sins they shall be forgiven you so the holy spirit stands between you and the sickness the holy spirit stands between you and the depression the holy spirit will stand between you and the blind battles that you're going through and the things that are going on listen the holy spirit will stand between you and your young people and the loyalty seeing spirit that's trying to take you over amen it will stand between you it's the same as the pitch that would go in the gopher wood and it would stand between noah and the flood amen this is what we're talking about amen these imaginations and things that and the devil trying to pump in our minds tight day after day moment after moment and we see it taking over a world amen listen you see the gay agenda and where it is today and where it was even 20 years ago or 50 years ago when it was just coming out of the closet and now it's more of an accepted thing what is it it's a bore a worm borne into minds to where it's become an accepted thing that's what happened with women dressing like men it became such an accepted thing today you can go down there and you don't think nothing about it a woman can look like a man and you don't already think nothing about it and now vice versa we see now men are starting to go like women and we're like yeah it won't be long that board is going to get in there to where it won't be nothing different [Music] amen amen but there is a pitch that will stand between you and the judgment oh hallelujah there is an atonement that will stand between you and the judgment just like it did noah amen the pitch that was in the gopher wood in the ark was to keep out or to atone the believer from the wrath there's a people that's atoned from the wrath oh hallelujah hallelujah amen noah could not get to the wrath and the wrath could not get to noah he could not come into the judgment because there was an atonement between him and the judgment and the judgment was the water amen as it stood out so they are and therefore also the believer in christ is also safely secured amen not upon our merits but on the obedience that i'm walking into the ark i'm getting under the holy ghost i'm getting under the token of god whatever it takes i'm going to die out to my old nature i'm going to take the nature of a sheep and say yes shepherd i'll take what you got hallelujah listen the world's taking what the devil's got why can't we take what god's got the only thing noah had to do was get into the ark he didn't even have to shut the door god did that walk in that's all the believer does walk by faith in christ god takes care of the rest hallelujah god takes care of the rest he that heareth my words and believeth on him that send me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the judgment but pass from death and the life oh and save forevermore let judgment rocker if it wants to he said why i imagine sometimes the ark was standing on his end felt like it was upside down everything else was going on that kind of how 2020s felt amen up on his ends feel like it's upside down and everything else but noah was safe why because there was something that was planned already for the water it was something greater than the water it proved to be greater than the water because 40 days later he got out on dry ground oh hallelujah amen so will this holy ghost proved to be greater than anything the devil can bring up greater than any sickness he can bring up greater than any problems he can bring up this holy ghost will prove to be greater it's proved it and so therefore the pitch stood between him and the judgment oh my don't you glad you got somebody standing between you and the judgment whoa jesus the blood of jesus christ god's son stands between us and all the judgment you know every man coming to this world is born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to this world speaking lies undone unlovely ungodly away from god and alienated without hope without christ dying going to a sinner's grave ready for judgment now i i know i've spoke to some brother but the ill being won you know you come out of the world and you come to a church like this and you think man these people always been holy no we ain't always been holy no every one of us had faults had failures just heard about everyone's born in sin shaped in iniquity came into this world speaking lies unlovely ungodly alienated without hope going to a sinner's grave but then the word comes along whoo hallelujah sharper than any two-edged sword and it cuts down a tree and it hews it out and it cuts off them stickers and all those thorns and cuts the best part out of it it's pliable that and it's now put into the hands of christ and he takes another tree and he puts it under a fire and he begins to boil the sap out of it and he takes the life out of that tree and puts it in this tree hallelujah that's exactly what the ark represented the wood represented humanity that was full of holes been bored through after with this mind battle and bored through with this problem and poured through with this thing and this sin come and blowed a hole in it but there was a tree that was greater than the hole that was greater than the damage and i'm here to tell you this god has not found one that's unrepairable that he can't do something with if it had his name before the foundation of the world no matter how many holes the devil has poured into their mind born into their body this god is greater hallelujah and that life from that tree is poured into another tree to protect it to protect it to make an atonement to make it amen through the judgment through the things he said a man just says well i believe the word i'll just take this without the blood you're left to the world hello somebody you that don't believe in blood he said without the blood you're left to the world no matter how much you're in the ark how much ark or what bored you are you've got to get pitched you got to soak it up glory to god you got to soak up the holy ghost and keep the world out hallelujah you know what we could see a tree that was cut down and it was beat until all the liquid come out of it water blood and spirit so that we could be sealed to win to the first mind battle to the first sorrow for to the first lost to the first no to the day of our redemption which is our full redemption the change of our body amen this holy ghost is not not something that's not this is just about to lose steam here no it's a seal and he put his own name behind that seal and he said devils come on and do what you got to do you're not going to break this seal amen so that he could stand so we could stand the test you know the next and the next ark that we spoke of was moses put into a little basket on on the nile river amen provided by his mother the one who gave him birth not some seminary not some theological experience experience but the one who gives the believer birth prepares the ark for him to carry him through so she weaved it with a little stalks you know little corn stalks or whatever they had there and she built this art but then she took some pitch and she put it all the way around it slimed it inside and out ain't meant to make an atonement and that little baby moses was laying in that basket and he pushed it out into the judgment of the waters amen thickness into the waters it says it always mean thickness and multitudes of people and the little fellow out there little cover over his face out of the nile river you know running real swift alligators on every side rains and storms coming but little moses looking up at the stars in the sky at night and the wind blowing the crocodile's bumping his basket but he was still just as safe and just as protected because between him and the judgment was an atonement between him and all the gales and the heavenly winds the devil could sin was an atonement hallelujah amen between you and year 2020 is an atonement between you and whatever years we got is an atonement and he floated right through it he said we could look just a moment with some different eyes we'd see the holy spirit hovering over that little basket we could see angels of god sitting near down down each shore with their swords drawn no there was nothing going to touch that basket no i can see the devil trying to sink it with nothing going to get to it we can look back and know again noah could just be in there singing jesus keep me near the cross and all outside all the devils in hell couldn't take it because it was built according to god's instructions there was an atonement standing between him in judgment and mercy and though therefore every believer today no matter how hard it may seem how hard life may seem did you hear that no matter how hard life may seem as long as you're in christ jesus how many is in christ jesus there's nothing present nothing future oh hallelujah amen can reach your soul and separate you from the love of god in christ jesus the devil can turn every gate and hell loose on you but god's atonement is standing between you and every gate and you will float every wave you'll go down through every alligator bed hallelujah amen it was the same pillar of fire it was the same holy ghost it was the same anointing that we're talking about tonight that stood between israel and the egyptians amen just as it kept noah and it kept moses and now here they come and they're right there right there going towards the promised land and here's the red sea and all of a sudden the enemy's behind them we know the story and we're in there and they're surrounded before they know it they're surrounded on every side and there's no place to go but seemingly die the only thing left is to die and they begin to scream out moses why'd you bring us from egypt just to die but yet god was preparing something too many times we get caught up in all the circumstances around us not realizing god's preparing something we many many of us got caught up in year 2020 and how bad it is and it's like and god's preparing something he's preparing and going away so don't get caught up in the surroundings of the going away get caught up in the going away don't get caught up in the demons around the going away get caught up into going away don't get caught up in the alligators and the flood and the and the tumultuous waves and all that's bashing against the boat listen he uh brother branham already said it back and i forget what year it was i can bring you the quote he said the stabilizers are already on the ship he says she's going to crest every wave well that's good enough for me whatever 2020's got we're going through it oh 21 whatever year we got left we're going through it amen it's a seal that's going to hold to the body change amen when trouble begins to face you sickness on every hand trouble the angel of god will come and stand between you and the sickness hallelujah praise god and stand there in a way in what way how is he standing there he's standing there in a way challenging you to take god in his word take god in his word god had given israel the promise that they was going to the land hello israel he's given us the promise we're going to the land so don't get caught up in the red sea don't get caught up in the desert and the times of life and the things around you we're going to a land the angel of the lord will come and stand between you and that sickness i know we haven't got brother ron's reports back but i i believe that the doc i know what god's report is but i believe the doctor's reports are lining up hallelujah because there's an angel to stand between him and the sickness hallelujah just as it stood for sister elena that now celebrating another birthday the doctors were looking at a death sentence but an angel stood between her and the sickness hallelujah amen brother brown was saying another place about the angel standing there he said now you can walk to that sickness if you want to mercy i don't want to but this past son did i'm just going to tell this i don't get permission but i'm just going to tell it anyway brother brother jason jackson was preaching it brother ron spencer's and it had on his heart to pray for brother ron because brother ron going to his test just this week and and he just kind of went there as a surprise and and he just really had been burned and prayed he asked me several times pray for me that the lord had just you know worked this out or whatever that's just i want the lord's will but i feel to pray for him and sunday morning he's about to come out to preach and brother ron walks back into the back and he says he says uh i'm coming up this morning to be prayed for he said uh he says the angel the lord's in the building i just saw him and so brother jason begins to preach and he's a few 30 40 whatever minutes into a sermon he said things begin to change and he he just went all completely off his notes and i understand he just turned his ipad and just began to pray off and he just began to preach and he said it just going down and all of a sudden something changed and he said the angel of the lord is here and he said it was just like a holy hush just fell over the building and he walked down the aisle and he said and he's going down every pew and he's touching every heart well you know sunday brother tim told about those that had just given their heart to the lord those professors well one of them happened to be streaming that morning just giving his heart to the lord about three weeks ago and he and he sent a text right after the service was over and he said when brother brother jason was talking about the angel of the lord he said i saw the same pillar of fire that held hung over brother branham's head and he said it went down every row and there wasn't a row left out oh may that be this kind of service tonight i believe we can have those kind of services amen well there's not a role not a pew not a heart not a person left out but god come and touch every life [Applause] there is an angel to stand between you and that problem but here come pharaoh and all his men to try to destroy them understand this when the enemy comes it don't go unnoticed by god he saw him coming before he got there matter of fact he arranged it for him to come he moved on his heart to come he hardened pharaoh's heart to bring him down there to begin to come up with this idea that they was lost and they was entangled in the wilderness and we're just going to go down there we're going to just destroy them and he hardens his heart bringing him right to his own death to his own trap and the angel of the lord who was there to carry them to the promise rose up from the camp and stood between them in the dead and the danger and he still does that he still does that he will make the way he will make the way for every sick person sitting here right now he's already made the way he's standing between you and the trouble [Applause] oh hallelujah he's standing between you and the cancer you and the sugar diabetes you and the high blood pressure he's standing between you and the anxiety he's standing between you you can go if you want to but you don't have to and he said i know he's here right now the same angel of god is in this building right now you say how do you know that because his word declares it to be thus just what he did then he is doing now and always be the same the angel of god moving up to stand between us and the sickness stand between us and death no wonder david could say very surely yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll fear no evil you know in our life there's always a shadow of death hanging over us our bodies are going down into death things happen in our life every day and situations arise and it's always got that shadow that in the background of death but david said even in that i'll fear no evil why because thou art with me don't forget who's with you standing there the angel of god went stood between them and the enemy and the angel of god is standing tonight between every individual and the enemy how many individuals we got here tonight every individual and the enemy i know what i'm speaking about i know while standing here amen on the platform before you tonight i know that god has condescended coming down from glory it's in the building right now if you only dare to move out on god's word and see if he don't move before you now it came between the camp of the egyptians and the israelites and he's becoming between you and your problem oh hallelujah if that's the case your problem don't have a chance your sickness don't have a chance glory to god pharaoh didn't have a chance even when the odds looked like it was in his favor he had all the horses he had all the chariots he had all the armor he had all the weapons he had it all but he didn't have god he was a light to one and darkness to another the israelites after moses prayed they could lay down in peace notice all night the egyptians could not enter the camp of israel the darkest of nights the enemy still could not come in we see that moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back a strong end east wind blew all night the scripture says and and the children of israel went across the ground on dry ground but if you'll notice while the children of israel had come out of darkness and accepted light when they got in trouble the light turned around for their defense and they slept in peace what god was making away the lord is my shepherd i shall not want amen he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he restoreth my soul yea though i walk to the valley the shadow of death i fear no evil why my shepherd's with me hallelujah god promised to make a way of escape and he was working on it while they rested he was making a way while he was resting in the promise while they was holding on to i am the lord god that heals all my desire thy diseases he was making a way he was moving aside demons and fighting devils and pushing them back and said no that's my son that's my daughter you can't go there he's i'm so glad that i've been filled with the holy spirit and while we're rejoicing while we're resting in the promises of god god is making a way of escape [Music] so thereby you can cast down the imaginations you can try to figure out how it's all going to come to pass and who's going to be what is nothing but imaginations god's got a plan and god's going to bring it to fulfillment and but god's working on our escape and he's providing he's making it just perfect then in the darkness of the night a thief can come in and people don't even know why because they can't see and she's gone he said every man woman that'll accept jesus christ the holy spirit while you're asleep while you're rested maybe you're crippled maybe you're blind maybe you can't hear maybe you can't see maybe you're sick heart trouble cancer something dying except the light and rest and the same wind that opened the red sea was the same wind that came down on the day of pentecost amen and we'll move down through and open and it came down on the day of pentecost it'll also move down through your way and open a way for you and you'll pass right through the valley of sickness right back to the land of health again you'll pass right to the land of cold formal shackled down in different religions back to the holy ghost field happy rejoicing heart full of joy and life again god the great holy spirit standing here tonight between death and life standing between sickness and health right now the same holy spirit that you feel now every born-again person bound to feel the spirit of god you can't help it if you got life in you you know what it is but jeremiah would ask the question is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there why then not as the health of the daughter of my people recovered there was bomb there there was the great physician there but they was not recovered because they would not accept him he would move and he would come he would he would anoint a service he would do things and they would just sit there like nothing's going on nothing is happening we all not be like the world and act like nothing is going on they act like that you know the world is acting like well it's just another election another time of you know whoever's stealing this do it blah blah blah just just just just another day meanwhile we're sitting over here looking and saying no things are putting and being put in place things are taking place god is moving god is orchestrating it's for our going away party so therefore in the world let's bring it down to our church let's don't ever sit in a church service like nothing is going on like nothing is happening and we're wondering why why why is my children still suffering why am i why my son still not saying why why is this going why am i still having this trouble because the great physician's here the bomb is here but do you know the problem is we've got too many with goat natures that's right stubborn humanity always worried about you know something different their minds are off somewhere else you mean while god's walking down the aisles and not one row is left out hello somebody not one row is left out well i didn't get nothing out of that service but did you see him walk by and when you seen him walk by did you reach out and say lord i need you and cast down the imaginations and and the things that are around you amen we must take the remedy churches are crying out why why do we don't have no young people why why is it just older folks why because they refuse the remedy brother brandon would preach that and why go listen to it wonderful service he said why are people dying in the pews let's not fool ourselves it happens at evening like tabernacle too people die right in the pews why when the remedy is there and but why is it they refuse it it's like i was saying earlier we can't the pa the pastor you know people get upset at the pastor because he don't he don't preach this enough and he don't preach that enough and he don't line up to their legalism but anyway you know he got he got a preacher dress code and he got a really hammer on this and he really got a hammer on that and meanwhile i've been to a pastor's church and i know preachers of clothesline religion but yet their sisters are dressed not not according to that just to put it lightly but you know the man preaches it i've heard him preach it but why are they like that because they won't accept the remedy too much for them to swallow their pride stands in the way their arrogance stands in the way i have you to know i can do what i want yeah you can do what you want to do all day long congratulations you live in the u.s you're free to do whatever you want to do as a human but as a son of god you lay them all down as a sheep i said lord you're my shepherd there's a whole world being led somewhere amen but i want this shepherd to leave me i want the good shepherd to lead me whatever i got to do if i got to lay aside every right every pride everything he said that's the reason why there's no cure for sin in people's life because they won't take the remedy they refuse the toxin they refuse amen to take what god has ordained to give the holy ghost amen to be completely separated amen from their sins is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician what's the matter with the daughter of my people that they can't believe in divine healing no more we've got message churches that don't believe in that no more what's the matter with the baptism of the holy ghost do they quit teaching it people still getting it well what's going on he said what are you trying to do brother branham he said i'm trying to shake faith into a people that they'll realize is there no bomb in gilead he said the reason they dodged the issue is they're afraid of the new birth oh well you know we americans we're stylish you know and we got to have a certain style and we we don't want to be them old fogies well them olfogies are going in a rapture we don't want to be thought of as out of date we got to have you know you know you know if it ain't enough that we can't put paint on ourselves we got filters that'll do it hello somebody well i have you know i don't wear makeup wood though you can't fool me with your facebook post we got filters that'll put it on you take it on you why why are we here why why is why is these bugs in your ears why are they born into your brain and they're robbing you of things god god given things to you the holy ghost the greatest gift god could ever give a person people are being robbed wow they refuse to take the remedy ah we we you just want to be like so and so the joneses is huh that's just an american expression you know the john does the joneses we got to be so classy you know we're afraid of the new birth you know he said he talks about one time there was a man boy from a certain church he said i used to belong to he said billy you know what he said i was enjoying your message so much until a woman got back there began to scream and cry and all of a sudden a lot of them people started crying and i said oh that that excited you he said why i couldn't hear what you were saying no more it was all right up to that time and said oh she was just rejoicing he said all that i just made chills run up my back he said brother if you ever get to heaven let's ask you asking why let's ask if if you ever get to heaven if you ever get to heaven you'll freeze slap to death let me tell you because even the angels in heaven is screaming with wings over their faces and over their feet day and night holy holy unto the lord holy holy unto the you're living in the quietest world you ever lived in and if you go to hell they'll be weeping and waiting and gnashing of teeth and to be honest you may not hear anybody else because of your own weeping and nature amen weep in a national tea if you go to heaven it'll be glory hallelujah day and night this is the quietest place you ever lived glory he said he happened to play on this colgate baseball team he said well i don't know they they don't do that in my church i said well i hope you don't think yours is the pattern check mike i hope you don't think yours is the pattern that's a prophet of god telling some of you message churches that i hope you don't think yours is the pattern well i have you to know we don't do like those people that even like tabernacle do they run around they shout they dance well you know why because we know what the grace of god has done to our lives and we don't have those same worms in our brains born in we've been anointed hallelujah he said well i i don't look much more like a christian to me when the minister says speaking to do those kind of things i said you know what that encourages me hear them say amen means so bad he said i used to have this old dog and he'd take anything take to anything but a skunk i'd get him to a tree in a brush pile only thing i had to do was get him to get on that skunk and i'd say sick him i'd get this whole skunk under a brushed pile old fritz would stand there and look at me one thing i gotta do is get him back in that pile say he said master please don't send me back in there i said get him back in there boy sick him go at him get him get him get him he said the devil is the biggest skunk i know of woo hallelujah amen the devil is the biggest skunk i know of so let's not have a service that we ain't telling the man of god get him boy there the devil is i don't know i never forget being in a church over there in north carolina or south carolina within places and then i was just preaching law don't remember what thought i was on all of a sudden the brother couldn't handle the more he was translating to somebody sitting he couldn't stand it no more he stood up he said dad that devil is brother get him a while amen it's time we get that devil a while why is our children where they're in the condition they are why is our children posting things on facebook like they are why are we doing this why are we doing that why is laodicea coming in more and more why get him a while get that devil a while grab him and shake him a beer and say no you can't have that child of god i don't know he's a skunk he's a wretch listen they ain't a person in this building would let a skunk live in your house you would not let that skunk walk in your front door you'd be screaming and hollering but you'll let the devil walk right through and have time in your house it's time to get the skunk out of there and say devil you've been in my house long enough you've been to my children long enough i'm placing the blood over my house over my children over my loved ones hallelujah amen it's time we quit letting the devil run rainshot over the house empire over the people of god but we stand up for a god-given right and let the devil know what he is you're a skunk he's stink and he says when you see the preachers got intrigued it ain't the time to back off hang the timer say well what time is that i'm so hungry no you got a skunk treat the worst skunk of any kind of skunk a devil that are to take your joy take your happiness take your peace take everything from you take it all robber thief skunk and we see the preachers got him treated we're going back no no let's go forward amen he said see he's talking that same guy he said look he said i i heard the other night when old charles nolan knocked the home run he said i i live about five blocks from the park never heard so much noise in all my life he said oh billy you oughta been there y'all have been there there was three men on base it was a grand slam you know what happened that's all that's all that happened i mean nobody won a million dollars they spent money good lanes now spend hundreds of monies and they get crazy and they act all kind of nuts never heard such much noise at all my life oh billy you ought to been there he knocked the home run man i tell you ought to seen him when he come running around third winning the home plate i said you on holy rollers down there made it where i couldn't even sleep he said if you want to call me a holy roll that means you're an unholy ruler get him he stinks you would be a poor baseball fiend sitting there saying oh yeah i see it's a home run you say you wouldn't be very much enthusia you knock straw hats down over everybody's head you're slapping one another shaking carrying on and i said when a preacher gets in the pulpits and hits one of them home runs like that and you see them saints get up and holler because why heaven is open and the glory spout of god is pouring down i see it i see it hallelujah hallelujah i see the king's highway [Applause] oh it's strange how they miss that he said why they're afraid of the new births the reason why they're afraid is because the new birth has any birth is a mess i'm not i'm pretty sure that when that oil got poured over that sheep's head it wasn't real pretty it wasn't you know it wasn't like putting a little bonnet on his head and do a little sheepy after the no it was dripping all over it taught it said tar linseed oil none of them things i'd really like to be poured on my head matted all up smelled a berth is a mess if it's in a pig pen the barn yard in a decorated hospital room it's a mess and the new birth is to where in the world okay now let's ask the question why is people saying they got the holy ghost and still living in adultery and still living in all kinds of things because we got some people as we could read got in there messed with the prescription i said just believe and you'll you'll get there it's called it's called growing into token life you got the holy ghost you just need to grow nonsense [Music] new birth kick the trash out get serious with god say i'm coming all the way or i ain't coming at all i'm going all the way with jesus he said it'll make you squall it'll make you bawl it'll make you cry enough to wash the paint off your face oh yeah it'll do things for you that you didn't think you'd do you'll carry on like you never thought you could do it's a mess and you know before you can be born you have to die and some people have a hard time dying this is a prophet of god they kick they ball they scream they carry on but unless a corn of wheat falls in the ground amen abides alone if you want to bring forth fruit you got to die to yourself you got to die to your man-made theologies you got to die to your reasonings you got to die to your imaginations you got to die to it all and be born again of the spirit of god get rid of that old spirit of selfishness get rid of that old spirit of dryness that's in you and take on new life oh hallelujah it's messy but it's worth it hallelujah how do you get medicine you know we got this big deal now with this vaccine coming out you know how they figure it out to try to figure out if it's going to work they take maybe we call it a guinea pig but a guinea pig might be a rat mouse any kind of thing they poke it into to see if it might work and if he survives it then they'll try it on you yes but everybody ain't made like a guinea pig everybody ain't made like a rat sometimes a medicine will kill you there's been about as many killed he said with penicillin that had been healed everybody ain't made it like it'll help some but it'll kill others because all men ain't made like guinea pigs but you know it'll keep help some and it'll kill others but there's one thing for sure god's toxin will hurt no one but cure all [Music] that's right it'll hurt no one but kill but he'll all it heals all the broken hearted it heals all those that are downcast it'll heal you it'll heal your neighbor it won't kill you but it will heal you you take a little wash woman it's so backward she can't even talk to the insurance man that comes to the door but let her get filled with the holy ghost she'll give a testimony to shake the shingles off the top of the house so you've got something now in there born of the spirit of god you take the ordinary uh ornis i don't know how you say that word prostitute that ever walked in the street out there the dog wouldn't ever look at her let her come in and get cleaned up from god she'll be credited to any neighborhood or church that's the toxin we're talking about they give it to a little guinea pig but you know what god did he took his toxin and he gave it to himself he said let me try it myself to see what it worked and he went down to the river jordan he took a dose of that toxin and immediately the spirit led him to the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and it held him through every mind battle through every temptation through every struggle through every problem and in hell oh hallelujah in the garden of gethsemane could you imagine the mind battles could you imagine the imaginations what are the romans going to do to me what am i going to have to suffer how bad is it going to be such anxiety until blood began to come out of his pores praying agonizing god let this cup pass from me but it held come down right to the very moment not my will but thy will be done it held and that's what it'll do to every christian when you come down to something not my will lord that's a direct sign of the holy ghost not my will lord but thy will be done we'd go down through all the all the disciples as they would give their lives paul peter all those down to the it held it held it held it held it held and the only way it won't help hold is if somebody gets in there and messes with the prescription but if they'll go back to the original it'll hold it'll hold in your worst mind battle brother branham had it his wife had just died and his daughter was passing away and he said a black sheep come down and the devil was in his ear he said he'd come and set on his shoulder that means in his ear right there trying to bore his way in oh you mean all you did for god all the meetings you've held all the look what you've given up and he's turning his back on you what are you gonna do brother brown said i was just about to say he said all of a sudden something deep down said though god slay me yet i'll trust him it held this holy ghost to hold it's going to hold to the body change let's power it he took it himself he's not trying to put something on you that he don't trust he's putting something on you that he knows will work it'll hold i wonder today how many would say lord i want to accept you as my shepherd i need you as my shepherd lord lead me guide me maybe somebody can look at their own house say you know there's a skunk there forgive me lord for allowing that skunk into my life help me move it let me let me just yield to you lord and move that thing out yes jesus he's here to touch hearts and lives he's here to meet your needs he's here to come and he's here to come and touch you as he did those up in the upper room and it held it'll hold you it'll hold you so brother timothy i'm having some terrible mind battles give it all to jesus that god i can't handle it you say well i don't know about god healing somebody that's out of their mind well i believe god can and i believe god will he did it to the insane man that was out in the graveyard and he went and called him by name he's here to call others by name to reveal himself to you i wonder how many would just be honest with god and say lord i need more of you in my life i i want to surrender more to you father i want to come closer to you lord i see the times is winding up [Music] i i see the darkness is getting darker i i see all the things that are taking place lord [Music] you know these altars are always open if you need something
