========================================

Just to walk with him means more to me than words could ever tell. To dwell within the presence of a man you will. There could be no greater privilege afforded on demand than to walk through this end time. Hold in God's hand. I know he's my father. I'm so glad that I'm his son. Oh, I was in the mind of God before the world had begun. Yes, I believe every thing I've heard that was said by brother Brown who interpreted God's word and I'll always love to serve him. No matter where I go, I know that he'll be with me cuz his word tells me so. I know he won't forsake me. He'll keep me by his side cuz I'm one of the chosen of his elected bride. And I know that he's my father. I'm so glad to be his son. I was in the mind of God for the world had begun. I know that I believe every single word that was said by brother Gre who interpreted God's word that was sent by brother Brown who in turn It's in God's word.
