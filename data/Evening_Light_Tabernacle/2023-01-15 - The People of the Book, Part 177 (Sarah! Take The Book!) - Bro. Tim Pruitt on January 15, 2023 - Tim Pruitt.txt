he had a purpose and a plan several tests tests and weeks later I got the diagnosis it was cancer five months of chemotherapy followed that one point during the chemo the doctor examined me and couldn't find the lump anymore I told brother Joe he preached that Wednesday night and when he told it he said they did a scan and found no cancer first I was baffled that wasn't what happened yet it was a spoken under inspiration then I realized it was prophecy so he waited for the scan on January the 6th the CT scan and a bone scan we're done both were clear no cancer in my body at all to God be

the chains are gone we have an offering to bring before him I think of it there in Revelation 5. when all of those they're gathered around the throne and saw his great Triumph as he took the book and loosed the seals and they took the crowns and they cast them at his feet maybe our crown of Victory doesn't look large that look big but whatever I want something I want something to be able to throw at his feet that day and say you are king of kings and Lord of lords you are my God amen I want that kind of testimony amen do you love the Lord today brother Jerry wants to come down just a moment let's just have prayer with you before we start this service today brother Jerry is going for surgery coming up we believe the Lord will be with him how many believes that amen he's the Healer and the deliverer we believe the Lord Jesus is our deliverer Our Savior our King amen Jesus knows every heartache every situation every problem and there's no problem too big foreign he's the Creator he can create even bones within the spine put him back in the right place he can remove cyst even before the doctor's hand touches he's that God we believe him this morning we're trusting in Him Father it's in the name of Jesus as we come before your throne of grace today [Music] it is you Lord that we come to to find the help in our time of need and my brother Jerry is going to be going for surgery oh God you know you know the situation you know the solution and Lord you you will always be the healer those can cut and doctors can do this but doctors can't heal we're asking Lord even do it even before the doctor even has a chance Lord did you just open up everybody comes down the nerves flow freely the cess disappears by the power of the word we speak against that thing in the name of Jesus I said there'll be no further complications the healing will be complete it's in Jesus name we thank you Lord for your promise amen amen thank you for this testimony Lord we thank you now for this testimony amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord hadn't said much about it because I'm just wanting to catch the right moment but Brother Scott who just had surgery and we are we had prayer for you Brother Scott and but we want to welcome you and sister Ginger to the church and we're just really happy to have you as a part of us I hope you feel a part of the family God bless you amen let's welcome them with a hand clap another Stephen Conroy's father and mother we thank the Lord for them sending them our way we appreciate the Lord for all his goodness to us and his grace in our lives and he never leaves us and or forsakes us he'll always be with us amen he's the God who cares let's turn to Genesis 18 and verse 9 for our scripture reading this morning if you will look at this together Genesis 18 and verse 9. and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will surely return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and of course I believe this is the time of life where God is appearing to his church amen we uh we sang the song you know a moment ago all that is within me cries you know that God be glorified and that is God God with us but you know we're really entered into a time where it's God in us amen he's not only just God with us but he's God in us and he said I'll never I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be right there with you to the end of the world and you look here in this promise here he said I will return unto thee and um then if you'll turn with me to Revelation 5 and verse 1 we want to read from here Revelation 5 and verse 1. and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and loose this seal stir off and no man in the Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was I able to open the book neither to look their own and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book in the loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders to the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb of Heaven every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by that blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth and then then run over to Revelation chapter 10 and verse 8 we're going to read from here before you're seated and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open notice it was closed in Revelation 5 and no man was worthy to look upon it but it was taken by the intercessor the lamb the mediator between God and man God became God became a man that he might as man win back for man that which man lost so the book the title that man lost Jesus redeemed it for us as a man for man notice he did not need this for God as God because he owns everything but he needed it man needed he had lost a title to the Earth the title to his own Earth his own body and so there again um if you look and see at this now the little book is open in the hand of the Angel we standeth upon the Sea and the Earth and I went up to the angel and said give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall be and make that belly bitter it shall be in thy mouth as sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hands and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me that must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings God bless you can be seated I'm going to speak this morning on Sarah take the book now you know we have been we have been speaking about Sarah because she and Abraham is a prophecy of the church in the last day so she of course is representing the church who in the last days to take the book of inheritance and to receive it but Sarah in the tent of course had given up uh the right to be the mother of the abrahamic race her name was not even to be in the book instead of Hagar and Egyptian slave girl had taken her place and if things had continued the way it was Hagar and not Sarah would be in the abrahamic Book of Life and so now God has to get Sarah in agreement with the word with the promise of God and she had to see herself not some Hagar but she had to see herself in the book and she had to believe that it was for her and it was for her age um to fulfill and it was her promise to fulfill now she was at an age of time she had actually ran out of time she was now 90 years old and it already seemed to be too late by all by all the sensible thinking or reasonable thinking it was already too late and she's certainly now at this time cannot push the Fulfillment off to another day because um at 90 years old there's not a lot of days left and and I wanted to say that where we are in time that we are here in the last Church age and now this last Church age has existed the same amount of time as the first church age of 117 years and so again we we are run out of time this is the uh we we don't have time for another generation or another set of church ages you know everything has reached its end this is where we are and uh so like Sarah who has had was at an age where she had run out of time and it already seemed too late so for us it almost seems too late that we're way over into overtime somewhere and of course we know that as I have spoken Services past that with the coming of the Lord there is that word delay where that men will say the Lord hath the late is coming so that that in the very midst of time there are even Junctions of time where seemed like nothing is happening for for a bit as I've explained from the time word the angel came to Zachariah and simeon's prophecy and Anna's prophecy and and Jesus birth and all of these events that took place then for about 30 years it was nothing happened and except a little Glimpse that we have of Jesus at the temple at the age of 12 and so you know again when you look at it there there will be times of of where there's great things happening as we saw even in the intent Revival of brother branham's a great things happen in Dental lull and then the word Break Forth in great Revelations come forth and then and then a law and then you know Revelation strike the bride of Christ and an understanding come and then a law and and you know it's so you know what what we must do is not give up on the promise amen just because that we see a lull or a time of silence or a time where it seemed like God is not moving and remember this even in your own personal walk that there be those times that seem like God is a million miles away but you never give up on the promise of God you keep believing you keep expecting God to move on the scene on your behalf amen to reveal himself to you now the coming of the promised son was past due it seemed like it would never happen and so has it been with the church that every move of God you know has seemingly in the past just become another Ishmael the son of a slave girl another denominational move and Men settled down to just um well we thought it was going to be the Revival that would produce the the the coming son but it just produced a son of the slave girl another denomination another child of the bonds woman and uh so and while brother Bradham felt certain that would be no denomination that would follow this you know that we we find that denominationalism and its sectarianism has done its damage and it has divided us you know sectarianism is when a group of people is devoted to particularly narrow tradition or belief system and and they those who carefully adhere to one particular sect they'll actually feel hatred or bigotry toward those of other sex and you know it's like a little cancer a little cancer comes in there first it's a spirit and remember this when we go to dealing with things first of all everything you know the origin of it is a spirit even sickness in your body that's a spirit Jesus never did say um you know you epilepsy go he said thou devil go you know he never he never dealt with even the paralytic one he never did say um you know uh and call it by his scientific name he he would say you know that demon loose her and let her go you know all of these things you know he recognized it to be a spirit and uh so he said that little cancer comes in versus the spirit then it gets into backslidden cell or bruised cell or cell that's not operating right and that's what happens in the church when he when he gets someone failing to operate with the church Someone failing pulling off and getting indifferent that's a cancer in the church it's a devil in that person and that causes the whole church to be sick over it and of course as we look at the the church today uh of course that the church has been in a very sickened condition because of denominationalism and sectarianism even within the message as we pull off in our little camps rather than staying with the pure word of God and today the sons of Ishmael on a natural scene they fight as a cancer Over The Inheritance that belongs to Israel on the spiritual side how many ishmaels have risen up dividing the body and causing hatred and bigotry but you see you see again today there's where it wants to come right down to just point out and make us think that some man-made move that it all gravitated toward is was really God's purpose and God's design but I want you to know that that was never God's purpose God had never ordained an ishmaelite he he blessed it and he said I will bless it I'll I'll honor your efforts and all of that but that was never my promise my promise was never to to bring a message and it just died down in a little denominational move and and a little sector out there that is isolated from everybody else my promise was was to bring forth Jesus Christ back to the church amen now so so again you know the thinking of Sarah comes uh you know that the the anointing well that's for Hagar they they're the anointed ones at the end time and then we want nothing to do with the anointing because we see over here Hagar blessed and you know she had Angelic visions and and visitations and the voice that God spoke to her and so then we want to Discount the voice of God and and God the Angelic visit well it's never happened to me you know I'm Sarah and it's never happened to me so you see that's the for the false anointed one no it is for the true anointing and today Sarah is having her visitation from the angel of God God did not believe her alone neither did he just put the anointing upon the false but the anointing was actually set for the true elect that's who the anointing is for amen so you see again she would think you know the anointing that's for the Ishmael that's for the bombs woman that's for the denomination we don't want to have the anointing but Christ the son of man the word said no Sarah it is for you and it is for your children it is anointing to break the Yoke of unbelief all of your life it is the anointing that comes down to prepare you for a body change it is the anointing that we have received Grace upon Grace and but favor upon favor you are not a people void at the anointing Sarah you are a people that the anointing was set for [Applause] well I was speaking in tongues and prophecy and Gifts in the spirit uh that's for the the Israelites the Pentecostals that's only for Azusa Street just let's let Hague Gardner's Sons to doubt they're the heir of the promise you know Divine Healing that was for tent meetings and and healing revivals of the 40s and 50s it's it's not possible today we're too mature we're we're beyond that it's you know those uh expectations of Miracles can't be in the church we don't expect any Miracles we're too old for that no Sarah that's your story amen just as a deep mystery truth of the word are yours so are the promises of the spirit are yours amen you see Sarah had to take the book for herself she had to quit looking off to another age and realized the promise is now that's where I want you today I want you to begin to look at the promise as being now We cannot put it off we cannot be you know if you want to say you know well you're like the the Pentecostals you that's what you are brother Tim you're just like the Pentecostals no the Pentecostals are praising God for what he did and thanking the lord what what he's going to do but ignoring what he's doing today I'm saying today we are in the bride's Revival I am saying today amen the anointing is here I am saying that today is a day of Miracles a day of where not just mysteries of Truth are revealed oh of a great great Revelations of the word but the mystery truths of healing and miracles and signs and wonders are also ours [Applause] we got to quit trying to pass it back to Hagar that's for Pentecost that falling out in the spirit that was only for the methodists that's like saying Believing on Christ is only for the Baptist you see none of the promised word is close to her it has been opened and this is what Sarah has to do is take the book the whole book denominations have been built on partial truths the reason why we're not building a denomination and going to Rapture and we're going into a Rapture is because we are not building on partial truths partial truth causes denominations but when the fullness of the word comes it's a quickening power to Rapture and that's where we are now in condemnation by representation I'd like to share brother Brandon's prayer granted father heal all the sick and The Afflicted bring back the old-fashioned Revival type of people today listen he didn't just say bring back an old-fashioned Revival he said the old-fashioned type of people today and bring them back to original Pentecost bring them back to the blessings bring them back like Pentecost that fell in ad33 give them the Pentecostal blessings May the power of God come in the church May there be Divine Healing gifts give to the church May there be speakers with tongues interpreters with tongues May there be Gifts of prophecies and give all different manifestations not make believe nor try to believe or put on may it be real genuine coming with the word the word of God made known prophesying things that come to pass you said in your word if there'd be one who is claims are supposed to be a prophet what he said don't they don't come to pass don't hear him but if it does come to pass then hear that Prophet for I'm with him God give us them kind of prophets give us the real kind the kind that speaks with tongues the real kind that has interpretation granted father heal the sick and Afflicted make yourself known Among Us for we ask it in Jesus name amen so you see the angel is find he is there commanding Sarah take the book of inheritance you are to be the mother of this it is to come through you the promised son is to come through you let me tell you the return of Jesus is going to come to the church hallelujah amen the Rapture is going to come to a people who are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord look at it here again the angel is handing the book as represented by John there who represents the church even as Sarah represents a church here the the you know the John is the I'm the one who the angel is trying to hand it to and John is representing the church and as he does as he does there he is told and commanded to take the book amen this is what he was saying to Sarah he was coming to bring her recognition amen that the book of inheritance that she had given away to Hagar was hers and that she couldn't give it away come on church she could not give it away God would never recognize it he had a name in that book [Applause] and it wasn't Hagar the name in that book was Sarah come on now and none of her I believe was gonna erase it out of that book [Applause] look at this book Sarah your name is in it when did it get there when did my name get there when I started believing no down there at the altar when I prayed through no listen if you're let me let me make this clear if your salvation is in the temporary then your salvation is only temporary but if your salvation was in the eternals then your salvation is eternal right amen so again you see again when it didn't happen when I started believing it if if it got wrote when you started believing then it can be taken off when you start doubting and I want to give something new all her doubting and put it off to somebody else did not erase her name off the boat when God has a plan and he's predestinated a people they ain't enough devils in hell that's going to stop it Hallelujah his word will prevail of your doubt over your fear of your unbelief God did not just now find out you were coming your names was written in heaven before the foundation of the world that's the Bible amen God did not just start compiling this book that's why we've had to change a few a few words in some of the songs is because you know there there again it's it's sung with a with a denominational Twist of uh there's a new name you know written in glory in his in his mind yes it's mine no his the name wasn't written when you were at the altar the name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and God can't change his mind about you [Applause] amen you can't make a mistake and God acts you off his list and scratch your name out now if he said you would be there you're going to be there if he predestined Sarah to be the mother of this race and in the book at some point she was gonna have to take the book and see her name in it even though it was too late 90 years old but with God he's always on time he's never too late this could Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3. why don't you just give me verse one and I'll start there Ephesians 1 and 1. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God not by The Calling a man to the Saints we don't become Saints after we die we're already Saints a man with a Sanctified ones which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace me to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now this this was this was exactly the position of the first church the last day church has to come back to that same position where that they are blessed with all spiritual blessings in their position in Christ amen that's what the message does for you it positions you in Christ it makes you know you were you're not an accident God then just certainly suddenly think of you he already had your life pre-planned and he knew exactly the moment that would be right to interrupt sin amen and interrupted the curse that was upon your life from your natural birth he knew exactly the moment to step into your life hey man it looked like it was too late for Sarah but it was the exact moment for God just trapped into that life and take the book and say here it is see your name in it Sarah take this book it is your inheritance it's not for the Baptist the Methodist the Presbyterian the Catholic the children of of Ishmael it is not theirs it's your inheritance now so see who he's addressing here now he's not addressing a bunch of babies these are the Saints these are the faithful in Christ Jesus they have been set in Heavenly places and they have been blessed and he you know in the end he says you know something you've been taught you've been saved but I want to tell you what it's all about I want you to put your feet up in the heavens a little while instead of being so EarthBound and I want to give you a little something that a little boost a Revival a little stimulation that kind of builds you up especially when you know it's the word of the lord it's thus saith the Lord not want to speak to you you that said in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus been blessed together with all spiritual blessings the gifts of God manifesting Divine Healing prophecies everything going forth now you're grown up people now listen these are the kind that are grown up people that's what the early church was they were grown up so this was there and he said I want to talk to you I want to address this to you I want you to know you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world you're chosen for this moment for this moment in time no matter what the circumstances are you have been chosen now of course of course you have chosen Us in him now who did well you know I tell you what it was I heard the altar calling and I came let me tell you you didn't even seek out to God the Bible said that no man seeketh after God no not one if there's a hungry in your heart amen that there is a God that is calling upon you knocking at your heart you never sought God God sought you [Applause] salvations of the Lord all of it wasn't what you did is what he did when you were unlovable he loves you amen when he knew he was on the cross the song says you were on his mind but before all of that before the world began you were on his mind you were chosen amen you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world so you have chosen just to make sure you understand failure is not your name and My Chosen is your name you have chosen do you see this in the Bible you are chosen this is your identity you were chosen part of him before the foundation of the world so failure is not like your name so don't identify yourself with your past that's not your identity amen your name isn't defeat amen Well it can't be me I you know Sarah said I'm unworthy I'm worthy ain't your name quit saying that's who you are well I'll never do it don't don't say that that's not you don't call yourself names that the Bible doesn't call you the Bible calls you the faithful in Christ Jesus the chosen in him the Beloved of the Lord elect of God predestined from the foundations of the world this is what God calls of you this is what he thinks about you your name is chosen and you and you say well but I'm unworthy you know unworthy is not your name amen your your name is not unworthy You Are Holy look at look in First Peter 1 16 but he that called you is Holy so be you holy in all manner walks of life or conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy so he said for you to be holy not be defeat not be unbelief be holy blame us you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world now he did not choose you because you were blameless he chose you to be blameless amen he chose you listen he never said you're blameless and you're you're you know hey I I really got something here to work with here Sarah you know you're a 90 year old woman this is gonna this is really something to work with God said I'm not looking at your 90 year old condition I'm not looking at your past failures I'm not looking how many monthlies had passed and nothing happened and there was no praying I'm not looking at your past I am looking right now in the book and the book says you are the mother of this new race the abrahamic race the people that believe God in fact the matter is your name is joy amen because once Sarah got to believe and she started having Joy spells Hallelujah when you start believing you'll start having Joy spells amen see even that dancing spells amen remember the reason I'm having dancing spells the reason I'm shouting is because I've seen my name in The Book of Life from the foundation of the world that's what made Sarah rejoice no better woman had nothing to Rejoice about sitting in the tent Hagar's took her place it smells become the son she's totally outside of the book the book of The Inheritance looks like his left her out but that was man's thoughts that never was God's thoughts God's thinking was I haven't let you out in fact I've included you in the last day when the church gets so old and so decrepit and so unbelieving and so bitter in her unbelief that in that moment I'm gonna take and bring a message back that is going to transform her back to being a young person again that she'll be the same as when she was married on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah a new bride Jesus said to his disciples who rejoice in and they were rejoicing because demons was was subject to them and he said don't just Rejoice about that you know that that's great to see Devils cast out and they were they were subject to you through my name that's wonderful but that's not not what I want you to rejoice and I want you to Rejoice over something bigger and better than that and that is you rejoice that your name is written in heaven now for those that are against Charlie when the lamb opened a book the whole universe shouted and if the message of his coming don't make you shout then maybe you're one of those Pharisees that want to crucify Jesus but if we hold our peace the rocks will immediately cry out somebody's got to do it it's going to set somebody with stimulation of Revelation amen that it caused them to shout and to dance and rejoice over what God's done in the end time now you know I again how can I help it how can I help but Shout it's part of the script it's what's been written to me it's written in the book that Sarah laughed that Sarah rejoiced come on somebody hey man it was written in the book of Sarah you're going to Rejoice the baron will break forth with joy Sarah you're not going to be this way or you know just take this book and look at the book because in the buck it is written that Sarah will have this son and it's going to cause her to Rejoice that even her Offspring will be called laughter because God has made us to rejoice amen or stop this rejoicing and shouting brother Jim and those young people going wild sometimes let me just tell you well I didn't make him rejoice amen I didn't work him up it wasn't a song that got him going come on somebody he made them to rejoice how can we stop rejoicing when God made us to rejoice I was seen in the Bible I've been to shouter a long time come on before the foundation of the world he saw me shouting job said well John's house where were you job when the sons of God shouted for joy come on Amen I was seen in the book the book has written of me and I've just taken what he said and when I see that I was about there shouting and I am now here in time doing what I did in eternity [Applause] because in the Eternal ages before in God's mind he saw me shouting he saw me rejoicing over a message service over a visitation when the son of man came the word came and when it came it made me rejoice so you see the sons of God shouted for joy brother Benham said I was preaching one night and a woman got to screaming and shouting the little Baptist brother told me the next day I was enjoying your message till that woman went to screaming you know that make chills run over my back and I said brother you're living in the quietest world you ever lived in you don't like shouting here you ain't gonna want to go to heaven amen if you go to hell he said there will be weeping in Wayland And national teams there's going to be noise in hell if you go to heaven they'll be screaming and shouting all the time while he said if that made children I've been down your back he said what will it do when you get to heaven you'll freeze to death when you get there you'll be so out of place because even angels with wings over their face and hands and over their feet and over their face are singing holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy holy and it was so loud and so was so great until the temple post moved [Applause] he said God is an object of worship listen this carefully I'm finishing this quotation God is an object of worship God is worshiped if anything I honor the Pentecostal people far is to let loose and worship God now you know we got to move in this message that wants to dishonor that but brother Brandon said there's anything that'll honor them for is that is for to let loose and worship God if anything if there's anything that I honor them about amen then if he honored that about the Pentecost some people what would he disapprove about some of these marks today amen you know we spoke about last Sunday about the Nicolaitans they wanted to dress up the church you know they started having dignitaries to come to church and they wanted to be in a more refined more dignified manner brother Bradham told us in the second seal he said to what did the nicolaitan age ask for it asked to get away from the bunch of people that shouts and claps their hands and looks disgraceful gracefully like they did on Pentecost act like drunk men staggering in the spirit and think they didn't want none of that stuff they said they were drunk and when the celebrities said now don't really miss this may sound crazy to you but it's the truth when the dignitaries begin to come in they couldn't stoop to that so you see there again it's you know there there's something about it about getting rid of your pride humbling down amen letting God move through you rejoicing over what the world thinks is crazy amen but when you bring dignitaries into the church they want a dignified formal religion that God hates Redemption and the completeness of Joy he said they were full of new wine amen that's right the the wine that come from God out of heaven he said you ever see a drunk man he just in love with everybody he don't care that's the way a man is when he gets drunk on the spirit and he said the Bible said be not drunk on strong drink but with excess but be drunk on the spirit amen the spirit of God makes you so drunk you forget all your enemies and everything everybody's in love with you you don't care who's standing around you you're the biggest man in the country right there I don't care if your neighbor's sitting next to you with to some dignified Church let's just let the Holy Ghost get on you one time and see what takes place you get real good souse drunk and you'll see what takes place you'll say sister I got it don't you want it to yes sir yes sir it's something to take place there you are that we're all drunk on the wine and listen some of you sisters here did you know the Blessed Virgin Mary was in that she had to go up there that mother of Jesus had to go up there and be included in that bunch of drunk people so drunk on the spirit till she staggered like she was drunken whiskey and saw something and you think you'll get to Heaven by slipping over the church and put your songbook under your arm and walking over every Sunday morning the Bell Tolls and sitting living listen at some kind of uh some of the and walk back you'll never do it you'll have to come that route because that's the only route God ever laid down and ever has and you'll walk it or you won't be there I'm not your judge but I'm preaching the gospel that's exactly the truth the blessed and virgin was right there acted just as idiotic as the rest of them did and just as drunk as the rest of them these men and women every one of them was full of new wine and if God ever changed that program put your finger on the scripture for me it isn't there no sir it was plugged on to the end of the age that way Plumb on down to the end of the Bible and it'll be the same thing when Jesus comes amen well after the seals he talked different no he didn't go to this day the scripture is fulfilled and just read there where brother Bradham talks about his nephew that was seeking for God and he said you know I've run the Pillar To Post time to find something and I've been dreaming dreams of running up to the Altar and where he was preaching and making confession and he said Melvin no matter where you go how many churches how many Hail Marys that you say or how many blessings you get from man you've got to be born again of the spirit of God it's the only thing that is satisfy the human heart I know they got to substitute today of being born again just shake hands with the preacher put your name on the book but friends that's a Dogma it's not Bible truth if it was the acts of the Apostle in the second chapter would read like this when the day of Pentecost was fully come the pastor walked out and shook hands with the people but said when the day of Pentecost was fully come at the inauguration of the church there came a sound heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting that's how the Holy Spirit came the first time that's how they come every time since that time he is God and James is not now it stumbles people they say it was for another day and he said but he's the same yesterday today and forever every time the church ever received the Holy Ghost said always come like he did it the first time under the same prescription Acts 2 38 has never changed and never will change hey man now you see we're to be like a vine that is planted by the rivers of water a constant renewing all the time it's like I preached on the Passover I named it in Passover you just don't do Passover once a month or once a year but your whole life now enters in in Christ in communion and fellowship with him and you are in Passover the fellowship never ceases the communion never stops The Joy never quits coming the love never never dries up and Fades away but you know it's always there he said he'll be like a man in the scripture that believes all God's word where the power and the nine spiritual gifts can flow through one God and to his innermost being in other words he will be like a man in the scripture that believes all of God's word that's why we want to be isn't it that is portions not just cherry pick not just parks that we're going to fulfill and listen we're fulfilling the New Testament does somebody hear that we are fulfilling the New Testament that's the groom will fulfilled the Old Testament we are fulfilling the New Testament or the New Covenant are you with me amen so everything that was in the New Testament that you read about is actually a type to be fulfilled in this last day Mary Magdalene out of whom he cast Seven Devils come on he casts out all the unbelief of all the seven churches you were that unclean woman that had to be made a Virgin by the word because God couldn't find one so he had to create one and buy a new creation that's who you are today a virgin bride are you with me he said in other words he'll be like a man in the scripture that believes all of God's word were the power the nine spiritual gifts can flow through one God in his innermost being and people don't believe in shouting to think of it is they haven't got spiritual joy and the joys of the Water of Life can flow through and that's the whole what's the matter with Bradham Tabernacle because that unbelief the cares of the world has bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth that's what's matter with our nation that's what's a matter with our churches they have no joy and the joy of the Lord is departed from them and that was written one time in the scripture in the in the Hebrew word of Ichabod means the presence of the Lord has departed that's over our churches because we left off the original foundation and placed ourselves into Creeds and denominations and permitted the things of the world to dry up our experience with God now listen he included his own church tonight that's one thing we don't want to become is indifferent and my brother Bradham said you know when they got starchy and cold he said I won't drive this home make you understand he said a church of people like this who would received the word became formal and you know and and dried up and becoming different and the next thing you know they were persecuting everyone who wasn't like them and they were trying to get rid of those who shouted and spoke in tongues and had experiences with God that was that Nickelodeon spirit that was coming in trying to take away the joy of the Lord from the church amen planting the Bible where to plant it he said you feel you'd like to feel like they did on the day of Pentecost um would you like to have the joy they had when God poured his life into the first branch of the tree the tree began to act like drunken people they staggered under the impact of the spirit lovely holy little women like the Virgin Mary was out there acting like she was drunken for she was drunk on the spirit she and she tried to talk and she could not she had stamen tongues which means clothing clothing like a stammer and trying to say something she was so full of the spirit she couldn't say it and he imitates this time in person and he said Stamford lips and all all of a sudden with another language they spoke out and a little preacher didn't know how to not to write his own name on a piece of paper turned over a soapbox or something or stopped and jumped on it and said and them unbelievers began to say these men are drunk that's a bunch of holy rollers and that little fellow picked up the scripture not a Creed book but the scripture said you men of Israel you that dwell in Jerusalem let this be known to you for these are not drunk as they are seeing this is the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of the Prophet Joel it shall come to pass in the last days come on now how many believes we're in the last days said God I'll pour out my spirit that was what was pulsating them amen he said would you like to be plucked out of an old Creed and uh of some sort and set by The Fountains of life where peace like a river that's exactly what happened to us God plucked us right out of a bunch of Creeds and planted us over by the rivers of water that's what he was doing to Sarah taking her out of her dead form of condition I thought about it as I read this Sarah had to be drunk on something to believe that now a 90 year old woman was going to conceive Hallelujah but the son of man was standing there with Wayne and stimulation and said take a drink of this take this milk and eat this book and when it does oh you're going to prophesy and what you prophesy will agree with the word amen think of that the church tells us in this morning age the church had this had begun to spring up a root of bitterness this is what happens a root of bitterness comes up we don't want no joy this is Sarah you know it's American not the promise saying it can't happen you know how can a woman my age have pleasure with my Lord let those hairs over that only happened we were young yet we danced together we shouted we rejoice and boy we heard but now I'm an old woman I can't do this it's not possible it's not this age you know it's not not our time they did it in other ages they did in other times but not us and they but brother Bradley said that this morning church began to spring up a root of bitterness and he said why it was bitter against those who wanted to continue on with the Holy Ghost the love that faded away and they were trying to swap a decrees and denomination getting away from the Holy Ghost leadership that's why the bitterness was in them he said the bitterness started Sweeping in the creeping in the the second church a little more creeped right on in because they were making a better Church You Know It embarrasses us for someone to speak in tongues it embarrass us for somebody to shout it embarrass us you know that's an embarrassment yeah and and so they were they had had as he said these dignitaries come in great Roman people great men Cardinals dressed fine and he said they got away from all the noise and everything they had very quiet it showed they were dying uh-huh they were dying you know you want to call that well we're more mature no you're you're dying and you got one foot on a banana peel you see they were dying they were so they got so they got dignified and they made a better body and that's what we wanted to do to the message in the last day it's just kind of dignify it where you know we may be we've begun to be embarrassed as brother Bradham said and ashamed of him just before he leads us he said are you saved of your Pentecostal experience Are you ashamed to say yes I've spoke with tongue yes I believe in Divine Healing he said that's being ashamed of him he said it's exactly like that if I would say you know to a young boy this is my son and he'd say who me you my daddy oh no you know you're not my daddy he said it would embarrass me for my son to say that and he said It embarrasses God when we are ashamed of him we're too ashamed of our Pentecostal experience we're too ashamed to have any joy in the church come on Amen now now again again there it was in restoration of the Bright Tree he said a dignified group got among the common people and they said well now that's good you can heal the sick and you can do these things that's wonderful but see what we ought to do we ought to just kind of get it out there we're a better class of people understand the better class the mayor the judges the dignitaries of the city and as long as you're carrying on like that they'll never come around you they're afraid of you somebody spoke out of the congregation said they still are and he said somebody said that there still are I guess that's about right they're afraid of the Holy Spirit so I used to sing a song about the old-time religion and it went like this as the old-time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it and that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me amen so you see again that that's the whole thing it will make you stop your line it will save you when you're dying it'll stop the devil flying and it's good enough for me and he said that's the reason people don't want it now in the message desperation after the token message was preached he said this ought to cause us to go in the desperation because it's the hour in time that the Holy Ghost must be applied the token the Holy Ghost must be applied we're going to talk about that maybe in a little bit but anyway in desperations he said that he read the scripture and I'd like you to turn with me because it's a favorite of of many of the people in the world today this is commonly given for encouragement and ought to encourage us this morning but he says in Jeremiah 29 the 10th verse for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you so I want you to know now they had been taken down to Babylon and told they would be there for a specific time we to the church had been taken down to Babylon somebody help me preach think about what I'm saying we went down and we were dispersed now among the denominations and the Catholic Methodist Presbyterian whatever but it was in Babylon we was dispersed there you know taken from the promised land of the word and dispersed out into systems of religion down in the Babylon but I want you to notice God only allows that first set time and after that set time I'm going to visit you this is what he says to Sarah I'm going to visit you according to the time of life again he says I will visit you and I will perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place Hallelujah I will visit you and I'm going to perform my good work towards you and I'm going to cause you to turn return to this place I'm bringing you right back to the land that you were taken out of and he said but I know the thoughts that I think towards you aren't you glad Amen brother Madison isn't that sweet I think it's some of the sweetest words I know the thoughts that I think of you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then you shall call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you will seek me with your heart and find me and when you seek with me for me with search for me with your heart with all your heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away from you your captivity and I will gather you from all let me bring it specific the denominations stop here stop here just for a moment how many some of your background was Catholic raise your hands I won two I know another so so there again Catholics all right so what what about you that were Baptists raise up your hands all right what about let's just say Pentecostal raise up your hands so you see you were there I'm gonna gather you from all of that isn't that what God has done come on amen you Methodist boy didn't he gather you he didn't leave you alone he knew exactly where to find you to bring you not the evening tonight Tabernacle but to this place what place are we talking about because it's black is somebody ready for it to cut back the Pentecost where you fell from I will bring you again into the place which I caused you to be carried away captive brother Branham says here now these are his words back to Pentecost so I want you to see this is what he what he thought of it this is where you're coming back to I know the thoughts and I think I'm going to perform my good word to you and I'm going to bring you back to where you fell from back to Pentecost amen you know again he said it I put that in myself it doesn't say that but that's what I was meaning to the church so brother Brandon's message of what he meant to the church was that the message of God would turn us back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers Sarah I am returning you to Pentecost back to your youth back to when Mary the mother of Jesus with the 120 dance and shouted and glorified God under the power of the Holy Ghost I'm bringing you back you know something getting screamed out no no Sarah that's not you you're an old woman you're too dignified for that but we're about to lose all our dignity [Applause] Hallelujah the Nicolaitans brought that in the Holy Ghost never put that in amen the Holy Ghost put freedom and joy and rejoicing and dancing Hallelujah speaking of tongues and prophecy that's what the Holy Ghost wrote in Nicola anthonism brought in dignity dignitaries I can hear him saying hey Sarah you're you're too dignified for that you know this is not that day this is the calling out of the Bride not 2 000 years ago at Pentecostal the repeater the return let me just say something they're using Brother branham's words but let me just say the devil uses it scripture too let me make it clear we are not repeating Pentecost this is not another Journey Sarah where you're just going to be young and yet barren in this day instead Jesus instead of Jesus is setting as mediator which he still does he advances to take the book I want you to understand this is not the day of Pentecost because at the day of Pentecost Jesus sat down his mediator and sent back his own Spirit to come and live in the church is that right but this is the day when the lamb takes the book and reveals and opens the book father believer and then advances and brings the book down an open book not a close book but every promise of God opened to us not a few come on not just opening up the mystery of who the horse white horse rider the red the black the pale that's not it I was exposing the devil he is what bring you back to the mystery of your life Who You Are Sarah so you can see your name in the book Hallelujah he's gonna Rapture the names on that boat amen the names of the book that is the Believers that's who's written in the book and it had to be opened so we're not just returning to Pentecost we are taking this places they didn't get to go we are going all the way to the change Pentecost I'm done by 2 000 years ago stop short of the change they were right on the cusp of it the Mysteries were being given three Destinies and serpent sea eternal security baptism in Jesus name receive the gift of the Holy all of it was there ever mystery Paul was preaching them and he starts preaching the mystery of the rapture and says we which are alive and remain he's right on the cusp of it he's right on the edge of it and with all of that word they start falling the church now I wouldn't just say we are not just returning to Pentecost look at your neighbor and say that we are not just returning to Pentecost we are taking this to places they didn't get to go we are going all the way to the chains we have heard to shout We are Becoming The Voice and soon the trumpet's going to sound someone is going to fulfill the words of Jesus that the power of death will not be able to defeat my church but however despite all that all of that you know Malachi 4 and the ministry of the son of man he said I know the thoughts that I think of you they are peace and not of evil and it's for the purpose of uh back to Pentecost I'm going to bring you back I want to want to get this to you let me stop in a moment with Israel coming in from Egypt getting into the line was not all of it you know to build a nice home on your own and have your own Vineyard and raise your children in the promised land it's as I've said a land of milk and honey it's a wonderful place but God's intention was not just to give them a land where that they built a temple and had a synagogues or or they had they had their own piece of property and married and given marriage and just had children in generations and they go no he had brought Jim back to that land to receive the Messiah right she prepared them to receive the Messiah to come I want to say to you God has not just given us this land so that we could have our own churches and fit it with pews like we like and set Church ordered the way we want it and have our forms all set up the way we like them and we have something called a message church and we raise good kids and we have a church society that helps one another that ain't what God brought us here God has greatness here that we might see the Messiah that the promise said Hallelujah that the promise said we come otherwise it's all for nothing you might as well stayed in your denomination they had better churches and better facilities and better this and better that Aid societies but God has brought you to this land of the word that he might reveal to you the Messiah his plan his purpose and then you as a revelation so that he could come for you so he could give you the book of redemption so this is not just another Pentecost this instead are you ready for this is the Pentecost of all Pentecost this is a super Pentecost this is when the day of Pentecost has fully come Hallelujah there were partial comments in the past come on somebody that would still prophesying of something greater to come but we're not prophesying of something greater to come we have arrived we are at the church we are the people who are praying forth Jesus Christ back to the Earth again we're the people of the rapture the other instances of Pentecost where only a shadow of us Shadow is it's it's something that comes between that and as the real thing approaches you see something like it come the Shadow's not the real thing the type is not the real thing if it was Abraham it would have ended with Abraham so Abraham was left there as a type to say there's going to be someone this is going to be fulfilled in a greater way and a reality now hold that thought for a moment the other instances of Pentecost were only a shadow of us they were only prophesying of us I want you to look at it for a moment Acts chapter 2 is a prophecy of us the Pentecost 50 days or seven weeks after the Passover and leave in Egypt when they have their first Pentecost was on Mount Sinai and God married Israel and wrote his long stones gave his word on stones and then there was again another Pentecost it was only prophesying of a greater Pentecost because in that Pentecost it was 3 000 there that died when they made the golden calf and then you come right down along the line and and now you come all the way to the days of Jesus and it's prophesied of a greater Pentecost and then there was there was Jesus death the Passover Lamb I mean he's with me now and as the Passover Lamb of there he died and 50 days later his Spirit or his anointing comes down and and brings and brings uh their the spirit of Jesus and now God writes his law on flesh so this one was only foreshadowing another that would be greater but can I just say to you this this it was only foreshadowing another greater Pentecost and we are in the greatest Pentecost the greatest Jubilee that there has ever been right now going on right now and you expect us not to shout and you expect us not to rejoice we are in the Jubilee of jubilees Hallelujah when those you have been enslaved come on somebody they were in slaves of sins and so were we but when we were also enslaves of unbelief come on somebody down to seven churches we got enslaved in citizens of man but what did God do he has sent a jubilee trumpet that says lay down your hole You Don't Have To Belong to baptist Methodist Presbyterian Catholic you don't have to be enslaved anymore come on home take your inheritance slow down your hole now just prophesy now 2 000 years ago we the Passover Lamb came Paul said he was our Passover Lamb he said Christ Our Passover so you see we have now come seven weeks and now after seven weeks after Calvary and Jesus where Jesus became a Passover Lamb his anointing comes down and brings to us an open book that is saying to the church Sarah take the book this is a full inheritance and and I just want to say Sarah this is the greatest day of your life this is not just the day that the lamb takes the book this is even greater than that this is the day where you take the book this is our wedding day we're us and the word become one God materialize itself in Brides form this is the last days that we're living in and it is greater than the day of Pentecost remember this is not just a repeater the return this is more than that we are living out and is greater than the day of Pentecost even though that that is the alpha and we are the Omega then yet there is something that has been left for us that day of the first age did not obtain this last day is greater I want to say it again it's greater than the day of Pentecost because that gave us a deposit on our inheritance and he believes that but I want to say this is not just another deposit amen this is the receiving of the full and complete inheritance Hallelujah this is where that people in the last day take the book of title that Adam lost that a man took for us which was Jesus Christ and he comes down with his book come on and he hands that book a title of the Earth can I say the title to yours is in it therefore when you completely receive possession of that your body is going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and will no longer be under Satan's grip I want to get it to you they received a deposit a deposit you're not in the day of just receiving the deposit now individually you must receive the Holy Ghost and have the deposit and that deposits on the change of your body that just as God saved your soul you're going to have full and complete Redemption amen and the adoption that is the change of our bodies somebody with me now but now we're talking about the church and the church coming down now we're not speaking of individual and individually receiving the holy I'm talking about the move of God in this day and hour and remember back on the day of Pentecost he gave a deposit saying there's something greater to come now you know exercise is something a moment let's turn to Second Corinthians 1 and 21. now he which established you in Christ and hath anointed us is God so what established us in Christ and whatever who has anointed us that's God who has also sealed us and given us the help me now earnest of the spirit in our hearts now and Earnest is money in which purchases are given as a pledge or down payment that the full amount will subsequently be paid amen so again you know it is it is a deposit on a promise amen now if you go with me to Second Corinthians 5 and 5 and now he that will offer us the Same Spirit uh is God he's giving us an Earnest I'm sorry I meant Ephesians 1 13 and whom you have trusted after that you have heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom after you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory so he said I'm giving you the Holy Ghost you have received is the earnest of your inheritance amen it's a deposit that is going to be left with the church until the full possession comes until the title is handed over somebody with me now amen so this is not a repeat of Pentecost why because this is not a deposit on our inheritance it is the coming of the full and complete inheritance it's the bride's calling it's the marriage of the Lamb so do we have something different brother Brandon said we do oh you and you think well what is it it's the seals yes the Thunder's yes but let me just say the early church didn't need the Thunders and seals it wasn't sealed to them amen they didn't need the book open the book was open to them they had the revelation come on somebody no they didn't know the churches they didn't need to know the churches they had everything they needed to go in a rapture except us Hallelujah because God had more names on the book Hallelujah so the church would go through seven churches and then gathered up those names of the book because God's determined there's not going to be one left out okay so what do we have that's different by the time you said you know yeah we got the Thunders and the seals but they didn't need them well let's stop this for a moment God didn't want them to know there would be seven churches the devil would have done great damage with that nobody would have died ready nobody would have been prepared so every age died ready to come up amen now so God hid that from them and and in fact from what we know of the Book of Revelation It Was Written even after Paul was off the scene so you know there's a whole book that's written after Paul is gone Paul never mentions the seals he never mentions the seven Thunders Peter didn't know them none of them knew him it was not to be known and back to the matter is when when John was going to tell it you know when he got it and he heard it and he was going to write it and he said don't do it it ain't even for the Saints it will be kept silent until the days of the voice of the seventh angel and when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God will be finished [Applause] so hold that bright until the last days and when it's the last days it's time to let them know it's the last days Hallelujah hallelujah it's time for them to know where their hour of the mouth come on it's time to let them know where they come down to Seven Acres It's Time to Let It Go that they are in the last days that this is the cycle that is coming and the Silence of his Heaven has been broken at the seventh seal opened the seventh seal didn't start silence it ended the silence what God had held quiet and silence not become muttered what do we have different you know listen this is what some are saying we're not to return to Pentecost they're right we're not to repeat Pentecost they're right but they're trying to place that in a wrong way they're trying to say we're not to have the experience of Pentecost and Pentecost not experiences for all generation is for all people it never ends every person must have that Pentecostal experience but we are not merely repeating Pentecost we're not just going back there like they did stop for a moment now so what do we have this different what sets us apart from those on the day of Pentecost listen we have the same deposit the Holy Ghost we still have the same repentance and baptism in Jesus name brother Brandon said the word that that fell on the day of Pentecost won't work for today so what word was it repentance baptism in the name of Jesus Christ or you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what which one of those words won't work well brother Brandon was saying is that it's not that the truth that they had won't work today but God is not repeating that again this is not just going to be another Shadow another foreshadowing of another age this is the Pentecost of Pentecost amen this is what listen what do we have different the lamb in our day I want you to get this by revelation true a prophet of God the lamb haven't moved as a lamb took and opened the seals so brother Tim we have the mediatorial work yes we do amen just because he did the princess and working Calgary don't mean his purchasing stopped when he started mediating and when he mediates don't mean when he kept moving to the realm of of where that he has taken the book does not mean he stops mediating in fact it's as mediator he takes the book he doesn't do it as a as I he does it symbolically as a man not as God as a lamb see shows it symbolically a mediator lime is mediator but what is it we have different we have the lamb after Seven Ages taken the book tearing off its seals and and handing over the title deed the one that Adam lost the one Jesus paid for and it's now back in the hands of men and we are commanded to take it and the lamb is poison position to call for the names of all of those that are in the book to come and stand by his side which by the way is the rapture and to gather the Bride of the New Testament and Old Testament to the marriage supper of the Lamb so what is different here it is soon the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side amen all the hostess Seven Ages it will be is going to be a glorious sight with all the saints and spotless White I'm with Jesus we will be eternally you see this time hold it this time it's great again just like that green back there and the disc grain is predestinated not to fall amen that Pentecostal Church went into the ground as a seed and was planted but this time the grain is he raptured in the glory without doubt [Applause] what a difference Sarah you'll not die Sarah you're not going on into death but there's an anointing that has come down Hallelujah to discern the thoughts and intensive heart the son of man revealing himself what's now and as it does it points a message to her of transformation a message of change you see I saw another Mighty angel descend from heaven with the title deed kinos pouring out the complete fullness of redemption place and defeat of his body upon the seed and the Sea and the lamb swearing by himself there will be no delay it's time to finish this I've come down to finish what I gave back to Abraham years ago I've come now to finish it amen Sarah now step into the prophecy the book is open now for you to see your name in there amen if the book is open to show you all these hagars that are not the one I chose come on somebody amen the one that I chose amen Sarah you're the one and it's the hour of fulfillment and I want you to for finish it with laughter I want you to finish it with great joy I want you to finish it with faith I want you to finish with with power amen finish it with her the bombs woman and her child cast out and you see your place in the box and go in a Rapture Hallelujah are you with me church that's the hour we're living in now let me just read it to you and trying to do God of service without his will the day of Pentecostal Spirit directed it right into that Joel 2 38. the spirit the day of Luther directed it right into that Wesley in this last Pentecostal move but this is another age this is a calling out of the Bride not 2 000 years ago at Pentecost or the repeat or the return now men run with that and say oh no we're not to have Pentecost no we are to be Pentecost the Pentecost of Pentecost but we are not repeating nor are we just returning there what would prompt brother Brandon to say this now I'm trying to close and I I will I'll let you know when but I want you to get this I want to finish this thought what would prompt brother Branham to say this what and and I just want to ask you what could be greater than the spirit of God coming down into a person think about it it seems like this would be the greatest of all experiences what would be greater than deity coming down on the inside of your soul and possessing your mortal body well it would be greater oh it filled them with such Joy they spoke in other languages as the spirit gave the mutters and glorified God but this is not a repeat not just a return to Pentecost it is not the initiating of redemption it is the finishing up of redemption now think of some of the displays of God in the past and I'm just going to take you on a little Journey won't be long it'll be a short one each one think of this great this place of God in the past let's go back to the children of Israel coming out of Egypt what could be greater than God descending on a mount and the glory of the Lord coming down in a cloudy pillar and quaking and trembling and the mountains trembled in God's voice speaking from that how many would agree that would be a great moment how many would like to see that amen what would be greater than God taken his Majestic finger I'm taking stones and lighted his laws in it I say that would be a great moment and I say if you were living in that day you would say what in the world could ever be greater than this this is the Apex this is the top this tops off everything the Cloudy pillar is coming down flashing the light thundering the voice of God being heard God taking his Majestic figure and writing his loss why you would have been thought Blasphemous to come out and said you know brother Aaron he you think this is great it was great ain't it but there's something coming greater than this oh wait a minute your devaluing what we've got yeah yeah you're you're you're diminishing you know you're you're dismissing how great this is no we're not to valuing what you what you have at all but what could be great his coming is Jesus was greater than him coming down on a mountain and writing with a finger God came and revealed himself in Christ that was only a portion of there there on Mount Sinai now here was the fullness of God being manifested in Christ Jesus and Jesus opened the eyes of the blind amen he he calmed the storms he he healed the ears of the death he he opened the eyes of the blind he did all of this he you know and you wonder what could be greater what could be greater oh you're that poor black man oh since birth now he see what could be greater what could be greater than these Miracles what could be greater what could be right it's God With Us do you know John hot here it's in your job is in the boat with us it's a great moment ain't it yeah but there's something coming greater how in the world could you say that this is the greatest moment that a human being could ever have was to be right on the boat with Jehovah himself but now you can look and you can look back at that and you say his death was even greater than that his death was greater than open the blind eyes making cripples walk common stormy seas his death was greater than that because when he died he paid for my sins so now that we have something greater so what could be greater than if dying for me his resurrection his resurrection was greater than that because he didn't just if you just died for your sins and your sins passed was taken care of what about your sins in the future amount but his resurrection was greater than his death and if you can receive it his Ascension was greater than his resurrection and is coming back on the day of Pentecost what's greater than all of that because if he did not come to dwell in you it was in vain for him to die if he just went back into heaven and disappeared we would be in a bunch of trouble today [Applause] so what happened on the day of Pentecost that was greater than his work at Calvary and it was but let me just say it could have never been done without his work at Calvary you see one was making the way for the next so the Lesser was making way for the greater come on church I'm looking back at Pentecost back there two thousand years ago that's the Lesser making way for the greater amen now listen you see because of you that just if you hadn't poured out his spirit that had been nobody cleansed to receive it if he hadn't died and shed his blood and we be in the same trouble that they would have been in the Garden of Eden if they'd have taken from the Tree of Life and ate without Jesus dying to cleanse for sin they would have lived eternally in sin what if we'd have got the Holy Ghost without Calvary to cleanse our sins we'd have been just like that hold your thought I got you listening so yet the coming of the Holy Ghost for God to come and dwell in men was a million times greater but it could have never happened without Calvary this is the law was part of the process Calvary was a necessary part for without the shedding of the the blood of the lamb and the slaying of the life it would have never been released to come back on the believer Jesus said if I don't go away if I just live with you from now on the comforter can't come but if I go away I'll send my spirit back to you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost but as long as I stay here Jesus we want you to stay here this is the greatest thing God with us Emmanuel God With Us he said no no I've got to go because there's some greater coming than me there's going to be an experience greater than you walking with me on the shores of Galilee I am not going to just walk with you I'm going to be in you hallelujah amen giving you an overcoming life it won't be me saying don't do this don't do that let's walk here let's go there this is the will this hate the way it'll be me and you but what could be greater that deity coming down in the pillar of fire and birthing sons and filling them with deity and them staggered and drunk under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost yet Paul says that this is only a deposit what you received is just a deposit it's a down payment it's not even close to me in the full payment somebody help me preach Pentecost received the deposit we must receive that deposit too amen but in this day there's more than the deposit amen there's a people that comes into full possession somebody with me Amen brother Brandon said in the invisible Union of the Bride he said here come Luther out Reformation his words his church his one won't work today Wesley's want Pentecostals one it worked in USA then their day this is another day this is the opening of them Seven Seals I know that sounds strange to you but God did vindicate it so perfectly there's no question in it just perfectly now brother Branham is saying here he said their words Pentecostals words of Azusa Street Methodist Wesley won't work this is another day this is the opening of the book the revealing of those Seven Seals I know it sounds strange to you and even now we have difficulty wrapping our minds around it amen it sounds strange people just like when John came out and said Behold the Lamb of God to take away the sin the world and they said oh what do you mean we've had the Lamb of God all of these years we were told by Moses bring one examine him must be without blemish we went through this tradition for a Passover for years and you mean there's a greater lamb coming than this yeah and he looks at me and says Behold the Lamb because you would be a lamb of all Lambs here would be a one without blemish greater than all of these more holy than any of these somebody with me now now we've had all this preaching all these years of what he did at Calvary a lot of people stopped there they Don't Preach what happened in the upper room amen they don't they just talk about forgiveness of sins and well if you believe the message you've received the Holy Ghost and then bypass completely The Upper Room experience you know Peter even had a revelation you say well we got Revelation brother Tim we don't have experience we got Revelation well Peter had a revelation from God and still didn't have the Holy Ghost is that right they weren't converted but the church World said it goes right on well we believed on Christ we've accepted his personal savior we got the Holy Ghost and when we believed you do not so they avoid Pentecost altogether and we have something to go as far as Pentecost and say well we have the upper room experience and they go no further but he said it's another day this is the opening of The Seven Seals I know it sounds strange to you listen the devil does his work the devil God in those priests in those High priests that go that told them just keep the law of Moses you know don't don't accept this new covenant he had to explain to the Hebrews he said listen we got something better this is greater you ever read the book of Hebrews it's all about greater and better we got a better Covenant we got a better sacrifice we got a Greater Tabernacle we have a greater priesthood everything this is better this is better this is better this is better today you look out there yeah yeah yeah yeah of course this is better what are you talking about Paul Paul was talking about a bunch of people that Satan was in their ears saying you know just keep the law of Moses and Paul was having to say listen this is better this is greater and the devil will do everything he can to see that you don't understand the greatness of the Lamb taking the book and loosened the seals and handed you the title deed so we come right down the same point and now there's a further work of the Lamb and he's opening the Seven Seals I know that sounds strange to you how could this be greater think about it views walking into glory for with the with them on the road to Emmaus and the glorified one came walking with you after the resurrection and you recognize and know he who he is the glorified one the resurrection you could say what could be more awesome than walking down the road hand in hand with the glorified Christ sitting there and watching him break off a piece of bread hand the wine to us and multiply it like he did well what could be greater what can be greater well the answer to that is the resurrected one coming to live in you now you're saying well what could be more awesome than Pentecost what could be more awesome than what happened two thousand years ago I'm trying to tell you but don't be dull of hearing the opening of The Seven Seals because it's that handy back of the entire inheritance it's not just another deposit come on church amen that means that where they are they only got a deposit but you receive the foulness amen that means they got their Earnest and the claim on their mortal body but you by receiving the same Earnest or in this day an hour or receiving a message that is changing you amen that will glorify your body that'll bring the dead out of the grave amen notice now it is a time where the angel stands at the maturity of times when it goes back to its original condition back to where Pentecost was and now where they fail we continue on where they went down and started Church ages we in the ages by taking a rapture Hallelujah this is real church amen this is where that you are no longer a part of the Fallen World come on Amen you're not a part of the Fallen World Sodom is fulfilling this part it is falling worse said worse and worse and worse and worse and give the days are getting more and more evil but that's not you you are the people of the Rapture and you're not going down you're going up Hallelujah you're going up and you're going up you are rising you are not following you are not powered you're not going backwards Hallelujah the title deed that was lost by Adam has been opened and handed back to your possession and to show you how close we were God showed you the power of this word it will create squirrels it will take tumors out of a body thousands of miles away the word going forth unlimited by distance time space out of that moving into the eternals right down to a little woman and Vanishing a tumor it'll cause a resurrection of a little fish it will speak to storms it will bring the Lost to be saved come on Church your wayward children that's what it was we are right here on the cusp and this third full ministry does what and then it shows us if it can create a new squirrel out of nothing come on somebody amen so it will also Quicken your mortal body if it can resurrect a little fish it didn't matter how long you've been gone how many piles of Bones you are and Scattered across your you're coming forth by the power of this word Hallelujah if it would stop storms there it'll stop the storms in your life now if it would go forth and heal the sick heal no point and heal the sick now it will save the product now it will save the prodigal now he tells you shut the is being handed by I don't need is being handed back and saying Sarah take the bus [Applause] beat up and be the last prophecy for you're the last part of the word to be fulfilled this is not a return to Pentecostal this is going Beyond Hallelujah word they went down we go up Hallelujah can you Worship the Lord with me this morning at the musicians you are the people you are the people of the open box you're the people of the word amount look here Sarah take it if it says I can shout I got something to shout about in fact it don't even have to tell me to shout the very response Amanda when I see my name in the book well I see I'm part of the Bride in this last day it gives me reason to shout I don't have to have music to pump me up I don't have to have a preacher to work me up amen I have a joy on the inside of my heart and it's got to be expressed I can have every promise that God made and we are now the singers of a new song the debt is paid amen for him to take the book he had to place his blood on every seal and the Holy Spirit opened that seal and uncover what the Antichrist had covered up Amen to give you the secret the mystery or that it's revealed to you in this day yes the people of the book have returned to the land not to give us a new church not to give us a different place to meet not to give us nice pews not to give us nice families all of that's
