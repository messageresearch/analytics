you know brother brandham said this was a golden age cuz it may be the most awful time but the power of God is at its height he said he'd never leave us never forsake us not only that as it got worse he made sure we had more as it got more evil he said here's more here's more here's what you need and you've got exactly what you have need of to overcome in this day let's just tap into it let's just tap into the the untapped resources I feel like many times we live below our privileges but tonight I just hope we can just raise up raise up in faith to the level of the promises tonight and say Lord I know you're with me wherever I'm at tonight I know I'm going to come out on the other side amen amen wonderful let's pray Heavenly Father Lord what an honor it is to be gathered in your house Lord you see the thought Lord that you laid upon my heart and you see the Lord the many directions I was pulled with it and I just ask tonight Lord that you'll allow me Lord to to bring it together in a way Lord that you could min Minister that you could benefit Lord the people here Lord that I can just step aside and Lord these thoughts will come tied together Lord Lord we want to committ it to you tonight Lord we recognize that we're in the midst of Darkness but Lord we proom you promise that in the evening time it would be light Lord and I'm thankful tonight to be walking in that light Lord to know what lies ahead because the light shines before us Lord thank you that you haven't left us thank you for your presence that I feel here right now Lord your anointing Lord as we step into it and step aside I pray Lord that you'll just break every chain of bondage and Lord that you'll just set every prisoner free and may everyone be lifted up in the faith today Father we commit it to you the reading of the word the preaching and the hearing as well in Jesus name amen amen amen if you have your Bibles with you tonight you'd like to turn with me to the Book of John the 10th chapter Book of John the 10th chapter and we'll and we'll read from the seventh verse John 10 and 7 amen I'm going speak to you tonight on on the door of Victory the door of Victory you know I I I was originally just studying on the doors in in the Book of Revelation and and there in Revelation three and Revelation 4 and and the more I got into it and I just started coming across different quotes and scriptures about Jesus being the door Jesus being the door and recognizing the hour that we're in and how late it is and how close it is it was just really pressed upon my heart that that we got to get inside the door we got to get inside the door and so you may see a transition somewhere in this service where I kind of go towards those in in in the Book of Revelation but here at the beginning this is just what the Lord laid on my heart so I pray that you'll just receive it tonight John 10 and7 it says then say Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep all that ever come before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture if you'll also turn with me we're going to look at Revelation three and verse 8 Revelation three and verse 8 he says I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an Open Door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name amen I pray that the Lord will add His blessings to the word as you have your seats this evening amen you know as I said a while ago I I believe we can all attest and and say that it would be what we all believe but I I I believe that we're at the very closing of time um as you look around I don't see how we could believe believe anything else as you see the word fulfilled and the conditions of the world and and we stand here at the close of time the wrapping up of all things and and no matter how certain you are I believe it always behooves us to check up no matter how sure that you're sure that you're sure it behooves us to check up to see where we're at and and to make sure and to line up and to dig deep as it were and there's such a great deception in the in the world today and and I know that the elect won't be deceived and and and yet we cannot have that lacad isical attitude about our destination uh the elect's not going to be deceived I'm elect so everything's going to be okay A lot of times I would say that would show you're not elect if that's your attitude towards thing because the elect don't don't just come by happen stance and well what'll be will be that's not their attitude but they're striving and they're pressing towards the mark of the high calling and you know truth today is rarely told and many times some of the worst lies people tell are to themselves I think it's harder to be honest with ourselves than it is with anybody else and how many times we fool ourselves and we we put a smile on our face and we press on and say everything's fine everything's fine when when everything ain't fine and you lay your head on your pillow and you convince yourself I know I got it I know I got it but there's something nagging on the inside of your heart but but what about this thing what about that thing and yet instead of Fai in it and being honest with ourselves many time we lie to ourselves and and you know we live in a time where people are being taught to live their truth you hear this saying a lot of times especially amongst like the lgbtq groups and and different advocacy groups you know be yourself Live Your Truth you know be true to yourself and and be who you are and live your truth and it's pushed in movies and it's pushed in music it's pushed in schools and it's the general mindset of the world today that anything that would that mold you outside of what you want outside of what you desire in some way is robbing you of your true self it's robbing you of your right to express yourself and to act according to how you feel is right for you and I'd like to say tonight that that is the propaganda of hell that is Hell's propaganda that you got to live your truth because there is no such thing as your truth there is only one truth and that is Jesus Christ he is the only one that has truth that is truth he is the truth he is the life he is the way Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth that is singular that doesn't say I'm one of the truths I'm part of the truth he is the truth and the life and no man cometh to the father but by me and one thing we have to recognize and maybe this would seem even geared to the youth but I I don't think so I feel like you know if we all sit around a campfire we all coming away smelling like smoke so if we all Walk Through This World we all get bombarded by the same influences and there's a there's a real selfish influence in the world today that that wants it to be all about you that wants it to be all about me and and what can I do for me and and but the emphasis of a Godly life is to die to self the emphasis of a Godly life is to die to your will to lay aside your ambition and your desires and and align your life with his word which is his will amen what did Jesus teach us over and over again not my will not what I want not what I think is best Matthew 7:21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father he that doeth the will of my father Luke 11:2 and he said unto them when you pray say Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth and more Luke 22 and 42 saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done what's he showing he's showing the example of what a Christian's going to be like in every situation Lord this job looks perfect for me look at all the money I'm going to be making I know I'm going to have to miss Wednesday Lord not my will but thy will be done Lord I Lord I know that you know that this this boy ain't exactly where he needs to be but he really likes me and I really like him and we want to get not my will but thy will be done John 5 and 30 I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the Father which has sent me if I bear witness of myself no if I do what I want to do then my witness is not true here's what's missed in all the be true to yourself and and live your truth and and they're so worried about self-expressing and letting the world around them know who they are and what they are and what they're all about and what they stand for what they miss is that's not why we're here we're not here to express us you're not here to express you you are here to express him your life is to express Jesus Christ this isn't about bearing witness of me this isn't about bearing witness of you but it but it's about bearing witness to his glory amen and I know how I know how the world presents it I know how young people think is oh it robs you of your individualism it robs you of your ability to express yourself it it robs you of your ability to be who you are and and what you want to be it doesn't rob you of your individualism there ain't a one of us in here alike we're all different very different God is a god of variety creation shows that his choosing of the disciples shows that they were all so different they all acted different looked at things different thought about things different wrote differently you're you're always going to be you with your own personality and your own makeup and your own temperament your own disposition but placed in his hands you will be the best version of yourself oh I just want to be all I can be well then give all of yourself to Jesus I just want to be successful then give yourself to Jesus I want to make a mark then give yourself to Jesus and make a mark for Jesus do something that last do something that's Eternal cuz if you make a Mark here on this Earth it'll fade away it'll perish it'll burn nobody will remember your name but I got a name that's written in the Lamb's Book of Life that can't be forgotten that can't be erased it is eternal and I say make a mark for eternity tonight and give your life to Jesus Christ Hallelujah then your life will glorify his mercy and his grace it'll testify of his goodness and all that he has done for you because he alone is truth brother Bram says here God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him and there he is the door the gate the way the truth and the life we can't say that enough tonight what way are you going because there's only one correct way what are you believing because there's only one real truth and that's Jesus Christ tonight I'm looking for happiness he's the only way to true happiness I'm searching for peace tonight he's the only way to true peace tonight he's the way to True PE peace he's the way to True Joy he's the way to True contentment and he's the way to your salvation tonight Hallelujah there is no other way he is the door that we all must come through I want to deal as I already said with with doors for a little while tonight because doors doors represent many different things and we won't be able to go into all of them or to speak to all of them but doors can represent beginnings and endings a lot of times you hear say well that that door closed on that chapter of my life that door closed and a new door opened there there's a there's a new beginning a new chapter in my life a new door has has opened and a door can represent a transition from one place to the next death itself is a doorway where where we leave this body and and and the pains and limitations of this life in order to enter into the eternals we don't often look at it that way you know but brother brandham even says I'm glad that there's something to get us out of this pest house he said there's an open door and it's called death Jesus stands in that door amen he'll guide me over the river he'll take me through that door listen I believe we're all living for the Rapture as none of us going woohoo I can't wait to go by the way of the grave but I'm just saying death's not something to be feared your soul is right it's just a doorway you're just one breath away from the eternals and brother brandom says he'll take me through the door the same God that seen you through every hardship every heartache every trial every time you didn't know oh what's going to happen he was there he'll be there for you in that time as well doors can mean different things depending on which side of the door you're on you know to those sealed locked out you don't like that door but to those sealed in it's your protection those inside the ark look at that door a lot different than those on the outside of the Ark when you're sleeping in your bed tonight you that door is a lot different to you than the person who might want to come into your house it it it matters which side of the door that you're on doors are often used to signify opportunity and this is where I want to settle in for a second here because tonight we have a great opportunity because the door to Salvation is here tonight and it's still open you're not looking at a closed door you're not listening to a sermon of Doom and Gloom I'm not here to tell you you're not going to make it I'm here to tell you the door is wide open to anybody who wants to get on board tonight it's still open tonight the door to the ark is still open the door to overcoming power is still open the door to Mercy and Grace the door to forgiveness is it's all wide open tonight in the house of God and this is an opportunity that we do not want to miss we get so excited about about so many things and so excited about opportunities that come our way but tonight we have the opportunity you have the opportunity to to open the door of your heart to open the door of your heart to the King of Kings and the Lord of lords whether you're saved or not whether you're filled or not he still comes by and knocks on your door there's still things he wants to impart to you there's still things he wants to deal with in your life and we all stand here tonight with the exact same opportunity an opportunity to let him in every door of your life brother Brandon would preach that door and a door and and he talked about how excited that people get to have the opportunity to meet certain people how excited we would be if someone famous knocked on our door now a lot of people are wired differently and a lot of people couldn't care less but the majority of people if the president depending on who that was knocked on your door it'd be I mean it'd be a cool story to tell you'd be excited about it president came to see him if the governor came to see you even even the mayor stops by your house you tell people man the mayor came by today or I I'll speak to to to some of us maybe who who like sports if your favorite ball star drove up and knocked on your door it gets real quiet cuz we got a lot of liars it's okay I said some of us I threw myself under the bus with you but if they knocked on your door how excited it would be can can you believe they're here can you believe they're visiting me and yet every single service the King of Kings and the Lord of lords the one who blew the universe off of his hand the one who came down and gave his life for you every single service comes by and he knocks and he knocks as the word Goes Forth as the spirit moves across the building and he gives opportunity and I say where's the excitement when he knocks on the door where are we at say it's him he's here the king is here he's knocking on my heart's door tonight oh I want to let him in I want to sit down and sck with him tonight Hallelujah and you begin to feel that pool what about it you ought to be the happiest person alive that you can feel that pool the happiest person alive that you can recognize that presence because he's trying to gain entrance in order to give you entrance he's trying to come in so that you can go in he's trying to dwell with you and mold you and make you and save you don't turn away that tug tonight don't ignore that tug don't deny that tug how blessed you are if you feel that tug in your heart how blessed that that the god of Heaven the god of Heaven would tug on your heart brother brother says brother you ought to be the happiest person in the world to know this morning that you're sitting here as a Believer on the Lord Jesus yes sir brother you don't realize or a sinner doesn't know what it means when almighty God knocks on his heart why there's nothing like it there's nothing like it nowhere you you you could search and comb the heavens you couldn't find anything equal to that how excited we ought to be to come together knowing that's going to be the opportunity you can travel the world you can visit all the famous places you can do all the exhilarating things and there's nothing like it when he comes by and knocks on your heart how a holy infinite God would come down and knock at the heart of a sinner's door and want to live buddies with him I love the way he said that want to live buddies with him woo it ought to make us break loose he said it ought to make us break loose how many of the young people everybody just to think that the King of Kings wants to be my buddy he wants to be my friend he wants to talk with me tonight and deal with my heart tonight he wants to make sure I don't miss it so he's saying don't miss it it's closed don't miss it as close I'm here to deal with your hearts tonight no one could not tonight greater than Jesus Son of God King of Kings I say open your heart tonight but I'm saved brother and open all your heart tonight the little hidden places the little grudges the little hurts the little things you're holding on to Let It Go open your heart to him tonight don't let him in and then restrict his access don't let him in and say well don't don't don't meddle here in this part don't talk about that now preacher Lord don't deal with this don't meddle here I want you in my heart but but leave this part alone leave that part alone I I don't want to give up my attitude I don't want to give up my private life I don't want to give up my worldly entertainment whatever it is put whatever it is there I don't want to give up my GR judge I don't want to lay down my bitterness I don't want to lay down my stubbornness you know people don't want to lay things down because they feel like it empowers them we dealt with the spirit one time that told us the the person told us I don't want to be free from it because it gives me strength now that was an extreme example but we struggle to lay things down for if you really thought it was hurting you you'd let it go but you have a a like or a worship or an attachment to it that doesn't let you let it go but if you're going to get total Victory if you're going to live an overcoming life you're going to have to give him access to every door you're going to have to let him in every part that's how you overcome you give it all to him you hold nothing back and it's all wrapping up we've already said it it's all wrapping up all around us we can see it we can feel it we can sense it and if you're going to make it you got to be all in or you got to let him all in you got to quit holding back and turn things loose and it's a wonderful opportunity that we have tonight the world presents us with opportunities every single day but not every door listen to me not every door is one you should walk through not every opportunity is one you should take that's one thing that's hard to get I I want to say young people I just say people we just look at this opportunity look it's an opportunity I get to do this I get to do that and it's never placed in the scales it's just go go go go do do do do I'm going to do this I'm G to do I'm Gonna Take This Job this job is more money I'm going to do this I'm going to and it's never weighed out not every opportunity is an opportunity you should take not every door that's open is a door that you should walk through not not all roads that are open are good roads to drive down listen there's an open road and a wide open gate that leads to destruction that's an easy one to travel on not all freedom is real freedom but there is a real Freedom here tonight you're wanting something more you feel like you're cooped up and I I need to experience real Freedom you need to give more and you'll find more freedom than you've ever known there is a real joy in the house of God tonight there is real overcoming there is real Deliverance there is real power and it's here in the house of God tonight for you if you'll lay aside your wants and your desires and what you want and your pride and your ideas say Lord I'm opening it all up to you tonight I want that freedom that comes with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah but you got to enter in at the door and open up your heart then you're going to have that freedom that you've always longed for remember you have to open your heart to him in order for him to take over but it's the same thing for the Devil the devil can't take over if you don't open up to him devil can't come in if you don't open up to him a lot of what we deal with in the issues we face in the battles we fight are because we open ourselves up to an influence and that influence itself might not have been that big a deal you might not have seen what was wrong with that but it was an influence that began to worm its way into your life and change your thinking just a little we talk about it with guns and and shooting guns or bows or whatever you shoot but if it's off just one tick it ain't going to be very far off if you're not going very far but the further you go down the road the wider and wider and wider and wider it gets and you're right here and the word of God's right here and you're going it's not that big a deal you ain't even on the same path you're not even on the same road it's a big deal because an influence got in and began to work in your life we allowed something in that we should have kept out we opened a door to it and now now maybe that thing has you bound but he's a door of Deliverance Tonight Deliverance is at your door tonight are you going to open to that knocking he's the door of Freedom tonight if you're bound up the prison bars is already open Johnny Crow all you got to do is walk out tonight there's freedom for you tonight and he's telling you tonight that the door is open the door is open come inside the sheep fold is open come on in quit staying half in and half out I said it before if you're halfway in it won't be long you're going to be all the way out he is the door to the sheep fold and he's offering you entrance tonight he says and this is his word primarily this is the foundation and every Church every Born Again person is built upon this Foundation Jesus Christ the Chief Cornerstone and he's the gate the door of entrance to all Eternal blessings he is the gate and the door to the Sheepfold he's the one that can offer you forgiveness tonight what it say I I open a door that no man can shut that's right he's offering you forgiveness he ain't shut the door he's offering you entrance he hasn't shut the door he's offering you his protection but in order to get it you got to come inside the Sheepfold we got too many people living in the doorway to to make an example pardon me for a second well this has a code still there we we got too many people living right here on and they can see the blessings they can partake of the blessings but they can't be sealed in because they're standing in the way of the door and they can see the blessings they can taste it and they can worship and they can grab their worldly stuff too right here on this side you got to quit living right here because let me tell you the way the hinge goes is one of these days the door is going to shut and it has a lot different meaning than when it shuts on this side when it shuts on this side you're sealed in you're safe you're secure you're heavenbound you're going to the eternals you're going to go to the marriage supper of the Lamb don't be sealed on that side of the door get out of the doorway get in the Sheepfold tonight Hallelujah living in that place where you can't be sealed in but you're getting enough blessings to lie to yourself getting enough blessings to fool yourself still com able with the world still comfortable with how they talk still comfortable with how they act still comfortable with your attitude still comfortable lying still comfortable in unbelief but once you get inside then the world is sealed out get inside and get sin sealed out and get get get unbelief sealed out get the devil sealed out Hallelujah and begin dwelling in a spiritual atmosphere I love how brother Ben brought that out on Sunday begin to dwell in a spiritual atmosphere where your thoughts are never too far from him that he can't come and deal with your heart where he can't come and speak to you but when you live in a leot Dean atmosphere then you live in the realm of why why is that wrong wh what's wrong with that I I don't see the big deal but see the problem is when you're living in that atmosphere it never stops at one one I don't see the big deal but what happens is suddenly you don't see the big deal about anything and then your whole life becomes full of it's not a big deal it's not a big deal it's not a big deal it's not a big deal it's not a big deal and it Stacks up into a really really really big deal a lukewarm backsliding condition full of the influences of Leota more than the influences of God because one big no big deal becomes hundreds of them it becomes your life and then what ends up happening is this isn't a big deal and then church isn't a big deal and then prayer isn't a big deal and then you're just drifting aimlessly without an anchor it's a big deal it's a really big deal and it's bigger deal now than it's ever been before cuz we're right here when the door is shutting the problem is is that we're deciding how to live and we're judging right and wrong and what we should do and shouldn't do the exact same way the world does I don't feel like this is wrong or I don't feel like this is a problem or I don't think or I don't see or my personal favorite my heart doesn't convict me let's go to the scripture the heart is deceitful above all things your heart will lie to you quicker than anything ever and desperately now this is the thing you're wanting to lean on my heart doesn't condemn me wicked who can know it today I've decided to take leadership from a very deceitful and wicked thing and I think that's a wise decision no who can know it it's wicked it's deceitful how do you live how do you make decisions by the word of God you ask God to guide you you seek what pleases God the heart can only ever be trusted when he is in complete 100% control of the heart and he's the king of the heart and he's sitting on the throne of the heart and really what you're trusting is the leadership of the Holy Ghost and not your heart when every door is open but I find that people don't think something's that big a deal when it's something they really like so their heart gets easily swayed by their desires I convinced my heart it was okay so let's do it because it's something you wanted to do all alone we've all been there I've been there I'll speak for me you got to bring it back to this you got to bring it back to Holy Ghost leadership it's time to open up every door of your heart tonight it's time to come God's provided way give him your everything and it's got to be done his way not your way not well I believe the message not I go to church every service so does the devil I'm glad you do you should this isn't to knock that but there will be no perfect attendance of WS in heaven this person lived pretty terrible never did overcome but we'd like to congratulate them they made 37 years in a row never missed a service here's your seat at the banquet it's not happening that's not God's provided way the way he provided is through the New Birth the way he provided is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said oh God now this great dark ey were just before the most glor global global war that ever struck the peace while the power of the holy spirit is just moving in the land just as it was in the days of Noah men and women being persuaded today to come to Christ Jesus enter in at the door at the Straight Gate be born in the Kingdom you got to come the provided way we all know the parable we're going to look at it for a moment Matthew 22:11 says and when the king came came in to see the guest he saw there a man which had not a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment now we know that the wedding garment is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he was speechless listen you you won't even be able to say your excuses on that day you won't be able to utter a word of excuse but you'll be speechless then said the king to the servants bind him hand in foot take him away and cast him into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth so we know that the wedding garment was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and in those days what would happen just briefly as you as you came in everyone came through the same door and when you came through that door you your feet would be washed and they would put perfume on you and they would put a a wedding garment on you and by that what it did is it eliminated differences there was no difference in the rich there was no difference in the poor there was no big eyes there was no little yous the it eliminated the differences between race it eliminated everything but it showed that they had been invited and that they had come the proper way that they came through the door so all the guest had the same garment on and when the king found this guest there without the Garment on he knew that he had come some other way maybe a back window maybe a back door maybe he had tried to slip in when when nobody was looking but brother brandham says he called him friend verse 12 friend he says this shows that he was a church member he said it shows that this was a church member brother Brown tells us he's got a way today and it's the way of Calvary and you say well I believe that brother brandham well if you have and come by the door you've got to receive the Holy Ghost truly it's the only way it's the only way that you're going to make it in what what am I preaching tonight you're preaching you're preaching hard tonight no no no I'm just saying tonight we can't be just church members that's all if we can sum up this first part you can't just be a church member you can't just show up and think you're going to make it but you got to surrender everything to him you got to be filled with his life you got to get deity on the inside oh how do I do that you just surrender you Just Surrender and you repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's so many people well I just can't I'm not good enough and you're pushing it away and pushing it away and just say no it's mine it's my my promise I'm receiving it I'm going to be there quit talking your way out of the gift quit making it so hard on yourself he promised it he can't lie he promised that it's yours repent be baptized accept it not repent be baptized and argue with them about why you can't have it why you don't deserve it why you're never going to get it quit digging up your past repent be baptized receive it repent be baptized put it on walk in it overcoming [Applause] Lies We got to get into the fold hallu I know I know some of you have been here longer than me and teenagers I know our attitude we've been hearing this preach forever he's been coming soon forever he's still coming soon they stood at the ark door and laughed cuz you say it's going to close one day this thing's been open a hundred years it's always been open you said it was going to rain a hundred years ago and they made fun but while they were laughing God was getting ready to keep his word that's all I'm telling you tonight it's God's going to keep his word he said he'll save you he'll do it he said he's going to close the door he'll do it but it's open tonight it's for you tonight listen I'm not preaching fear to you I'm saying you can escape tonight I'm saying there's a way out tonight I'm saying you're not lost tonight I'm saying the door is open tonight I'm telling you that Mercy is here I'm telling you that Deliverance is at the door I'm telling you that Victory is at the door tonight just open the door and let him in it's going to close soon but here we are at the end of the ages and God is saying get inside there may be lots of doors open you tonight but this is the one you want to run through we've made all kind of doors but God has a door and he's the one who open and no man and no devil can close it listen I want to tell you you're worried he's not going to lose a one I'm worried you're not going to lose a one he's not going to lose a one he knows who his sheep are and he counts them and if there's one missing he says I'll go get them I don't care how far I got to go you don't know how far away my kid is it don't matter how far he's got to go he looks around and goes they're not all in I'm going after them tonight mercy and Grace is on their Trail tonight Jesus Christ is on their Trail tonight and there's nobody better than the mighty conqueror the King of Kings to be going after your loved ones tonight he knows who are his and then once you were inside the Sheepfold he literally becomes the door because he lays across the doorway that's what the Shepherds do they lay across the doorway so nothing can get to you there unless they come through him I like my odds pretty good you mean you got to go through the King of Kings you mean you got to go through the mighty conqueror to get to me I think I'll sleep well tonight I think I'll be safe tonight I think I can lay my head at rest tonight the world's falling apart but the King of Kings is in the doorway tonight watching over me because I came into the Sheepfold Hallelujah the devil can't get in and sheep can't get out how secure and happy we should be tonight he is the door to the fold he's the one fighting the Wolves Hallelujah open your heart tonight and let him work open the doors and let him move cuz we all have to have the wedding garment I'm going to turn just a bit here the wedding garment what is the wedding garment we know it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost getting people reformed isn't the Garment getting people a lot of head knowledge and teaching them the message isn't the Garment getting people to accept the truth of the word is not the Garment but the wedding garment is the new birth it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like they had at Pentecost and that's why that's why we continually have and will continually preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost we must continue to offer the opportunity for people to be born again I don't care how long you've been here I don't care how much you believe the message I'm going to keep offering you the opportunity to be born again amen we must continue to preach that the door of power is open in this day what happened was down through the the the years the the New Birth the truth of the new birth was lost and but once again with with the revelation of the hour and the restoration of the fullness of the word what we have is the opportunity to receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost just like they did in the upper room in this day this day a door was open to us that was closed to the other ages I just Googled what does it mean when a door has been opened it says when someone says a door has been open it means that a new opportunity has presented itself allowing access to something previously unavailable or difficult to achieve and the door there being a barrier that had kept people out but in this day that door has come open and in this day the Mysteries were revealed and in our day Satan was shown to only be a bluff and in our day the power of God was put on display in this day it's the open door of word and Power right brother Bram teaches us in the church ages about the blending of Ages and how the seventh age is actually just a continuation of the sixth and I tell you that because I'm going to use some quotes from the sixth age here and he says this age particularly flows into the next age so here we are we have flowed in and not only does this age overflow into the last age but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age and it was in this sixth age that we read in Revelation 3 at the very beginning where he said I have set a door before Thee I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it and we'll get more into that Friday night in our church age study but but brother Bram talks about the age and he pays it some wonderful compliments as he says they opened up many doors during that age the door to the gospel the door to the mission fields that the door that to Christ and everything was opened up during that age and you can see what they did the Brethren done a great job of it they done a great job of it if you read the whole thing you find out what they done a great job of they done a great job of spreading the word now notice we're back to this thought we want to get people in the wedding garment we want to get people to the baptism of the Holy Ghost we want to get people to the original Pentecost right we want to get people all the way in so how do we do that brother Aaron well we just give them the word we just say that God sent a prophet we just tell them believe the message brother Bram says for the past 150 years talking about back into that age great missionaries like no other time or age before has covered the entire Earth people say that you know that people all over the worth ain't heard about Jesus brother Brown says it covered the entire Earth think of that every nation under the heavens has heard the word it's just what the prophet said it completed many many many many years ago see but not the gospel just the word the letter kth but the spirit giveth life see he goes on to say the power of the spirit was missing in that age the word was well preached think about that he does say man they were off they were off their doctrines were off they didn't have it right he said the word was well preached the power of the spirit was missing think about it so we can't just get them back to the word or they would have raptured you can't just get them to the word you got to get them to a new birth he says it would have been wonderful if this Open Door had followed the Divine pattern of Pentecost this age had the word but they didn't follow the Divine pattern of Pentecost well what is that what is the Divine pattern of Pentecost it's the new birth it's Mark 16 in action it's the power of God manifested it's Devils cast out it's the sick being healed it's signs following them that believe he goes on to say Paul say the gospel didn't come in word only but through Power and manifestations of the Holy Ghost then when Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel he said go into all the world and demonstrate oh I like that demonstrate the power of the Gospel taking the word that what it says and show the people what it says and then make it manifest to them and then he tells us this he gave us the open door of word and power and that is what we are supposed to use that is what gave Paul his great and effective Ministry 1 Corinthians 2:4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power yes we preach the word but it has to come in power and demonstration otherwise it does nothing but make people realize they're lost it doesn't transform a life it doesn't change them it doesn't save them all it can do is tell them you're lost you're lost I need something to change my life I need something to give me overcoming power I need the open door of the word and power tonight amen he gave us the open door of word and Power in this day and he says that's what we're supposed to use may it never be said of us that the word was well preached but Power was lacking all right come on what I'm telling you tonight is your God isn't powerless this one I'm telling you to run to this door I'm telling you get inside of this sheep fold I'm telling you to go the ark the door it's not powerless but he's a living God he's a god of of Miracles he's a god of the supernatural this is a door of power this is a door of Victory it's a door that conquers circumstances Hallelujah this word has life in it it's not a dead word it's a word with power in it it'll change your life give it a chance it'll deliver the bound it'll heal the sick I'm not telling you to run into something tonight that you're going to have to run out of a few months later when it starts crumbling down this is an eternal Kingdom this is a powerful Kingdom this is an almighty God get inside of it and get through the door of Victory and watch your life blossom in his presence Hallelujah this is a permanent fix this is a sin cure tonight this is overcoming power the door of word and power has been opened and we are to use it I say it's enough of letting the bound stay chained up I say it's enough of self-help and psychology I say it's enough of living with Devils I say let's operate in the open door of the word and in power and right let's turn it loose in our lives tonight let's believe it let's let our faith raise up and say they don't have to stay bound they don't have to stay sick I don't have to be beat down my children don't have to go to hell there is an open door tonight of power and I'm going to step through that word I'm going to step into that door Hallelujah let's operate in the door that's been opened to us listen the Holy Ghost may be out of style and it may be ridiculed and mocked by many but it's still God's provided way he talks about this talks about people without power and he says that's just about all the strength the Christian multitudes have because the word was not brought to them by the original Open Door of Pentecost you say I'm I'm going through hell right now brother Aaron I know a man that can open that door he showed up there one afternoon after he died on the cross and he didn't show up to hang out he didn't show up to stick around he showed up to take over the devil the devil began to talk to I love how brother Brown illustrates and says yeah I got you now just like he says to many of you tonight I got you now Jesus said I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still wet on the cross I paid the price and I've come to tell you you've already lost the battle you've robbed long enough you've tormented long enough and now I have come down to take over I love how brother brand says he reached and he grabbed the keys of death and hell and he kicked him back in gave the door a good slam hallelujah what situation do you have that's worse than hell tonight I say he has showed up for your situation and he has showed up to take over he's come down where you're at and he says I'm here to take over I'll take over your heartache I'll take over your sickness I'll take over your depression I'll conquer death hell in the grave and I'll conquer this for you hallelujah hallelujah hallu before he left there was some saints down in Paradise let me see if I put this in here yeah I got so choked up reading this spirit of God moved in just it's a simplest little quote says there they are the Old Testament Saints laying there waiting to be clothed upon in Paradise he opened the door and Abraham said are we going out he said it's almost daylight on Earth let's get ready to go I got thinking about it for all of you that's inside the door all of you that stepped inside you may be snoozing on your couch one morning washing dishes or praying or I was just think I don't know he'll come to me I don't know but I was just thinking about looking over and seeing my dad say we we about to go it's almost daylight son Let's get ready to go it's dark Saints but it's almost daylight let's get ready to go I don't know who's going to come to you but one of these mornings they're going to come to you and they're going to say it's almost daylight let's get ready to go you stepped inside that door now you get to exit through that door there's a way of an escape made for us it's almost daylight let's get ready to go Hallelujah let's get ready to go he is the door of Victory and it's open tonight oh but brother Aaron I'm bound with chains of circumstance I'm Bound in sins I'm Bound in Pride I'm Bound by an evil spirit that's okay Peter was bound one night and the same Pillar of Fire that's in this building right now came into the prison cell and in one moment his shackles fell off in one moment he was free what am I telling you tonight I'm not here to beat you over the head cuz you're bound I'm telling you it's a freedom night Let Freedom Ring in the house of God let your shackles fall off and experience true freedom in the Holy Ghost he's here to deliver it's the same Pillar of Fire Hallelujah the open door of power we're supposed to be operating like that he says the seventh age is a very short age gathers itself into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of Pentecost don't tell me I'm not supposed to go back to that he said that's what the seventh age would be the reality of Pentecost I'm not talking about emotion I'm talking about overcoming power I'm talking about deity coming and living on the inside of you we're talking about God manifesting himself in your flesh we're talking about Satan being cast down by you tonight Hallelujah he says now notice if America would receive God's gift it would be a golden age for us and I'm just going try to wrap this up so if you'll just bear with me for a few minutes if all of the American churches would accept God's gift what is God's gift to the church the Holy Ghost he says now in any time that God ever sent a gift to the world and the people received it it was a golden age for them but when they rejected they went into chaos and disaster into punishment now you Bible historians just speak with one time and if they ever rejected God's gift and his signs they never prospered brother brand says in night 1965 that he said that if God had given him the choice of when he could come and preach on the earth he would have chose this age he said because it's the Golden Age and why do you keep saying that brother Heron focusing on the golden age because something is only referred to as a golden age when it's the most flourishing period in history for whatever you're talking about they say things like the Golden Age of literature the Golden Age of civilization what does it mean when something was at its abs abolute Peak this is the Golden Age of the power of God it's not the time to settle for less it's not the time to back off your promises and and quit looking for miracles it's not the time for his manifestations of power to be lacking this is the Golden Age and yet for many people it is lacking a lot of folks living under that indictment of the sixth age where the word the word is well preached but the power of the spirit spirit is missing he said that he opens and no man shuts he opened the door of word and power and yet some have tried to close it I thought of this scripture as I was thinking about that but woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men you neither go in yourselves neither suffer you them that are entering to go in not only do they not want it they want to criticize you and mock you for experiencing the Holy Ghost not only they try to shut it down for themselves but they try to shut it down for everybody else and in some places Even in our own ranks he's standing outside the door saying can I come in can I manifest myself in your church is that okay will you be offended if I begin to manifest there can I move in your service tonight will that be okay can I heal there can I can I do the miraculous there and they shut the door to the miraculous and they've shut the door to the gifts and they've shut the door to the supernatural but I want to tell you this they've only shut it for themselves they've only shut it for themselves Jonah 2:8 says they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercies brother brand tells says don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves heals fills with the Holy Ghost and power you are God's free men loosed by his blood I'd like to say tonight that that door I don't care how much they try to close it is still open at evening light Tabernacle tonight it's still will open anywhere that he's welcome he'll come in where he's welcome and heal he'll come in where he's welcome and deliver he'll come in where he's welcome and fill people with the Holy Ghost he'll come into your home if he's welcome and he'll solve problems that you thought were impossible he still moves where he is welcome oh he says but thank God in the last age there will be a group rise up woo check here we are the true Bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit and that day of gross Darkness the light will return to the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ you want to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ you got to turn back to the power of Pentecost you got to be endued with power from on high you got to have the new birth dwelling on the inside of you Hallelujah there are many Avenues and doors and gateways being closed to him all the time where he can't move where he can't manifest but I say it's still open here it's still open he'll move anywhere that he's welcome the door of the Supernatural is not closed and it will not close till the end of the age I say tonight he's the door of word he's the door of power and he's here tonight for your situation he's here tonight to make a way for you no matter where you find yourself no matter what situation you were in this is the goal golden age it's going to take so much power brother Aaron this is the Golden Age this is the age of Salvation this is the age of Deliverance this is the age of the Holy Ghost and Satan cannot stand before you once you enter into that door oh but brother Aaron he's blocking me here he's blocking me there all my options seem blocked you mean he's rolled a stone across your door he's blocked your blessings he's blocked your freedoms he's he's robbed your joy and stole your inheritance I just happen to know a God that roll Stones away maybe you wanted him a little bit sooner and maybe you wanted this situation resolved sooner and you wanted your child sooner and you you wanted Victory sooner and you may have even given up hope tonight you may have even given up that I'll never have that Victory I'll never have that healing I'll never get my child back you may have even said Lord if you'd only come a few days sooner if you'd only come a month ago I only got one question for you tonight in this presence in this atmosphere I got one question for you where have you laid them where have you laid your hopes where have you laid your dreams where have you laid your faith where have you laid that testimony where did you laid that loved one that you've given up on where have you laid that healing that you thought you'd never get I say it's time for a resurrection it's time for Faith to resurrect again it's time for our faith to rise up to to the promise it's time to roll the stone away where have you laid them at tonight where are they at it's time for a resurrection in the house of God let our faith be elevated to a place we can believe once again Hallelujah We Lay it over here and we don't talk about it no more we don't testify it no more out of sight out of mind well it's okay win some lose some no no sir that's a loser mentality this a golden age win some win some win some win some more healed heal some more victory victory some more overcome overcome some more Deliverance Deliverance some more we're going to win some win some there ain't no lose some in The Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's time for you to get completely inside he is the door you can stand to your feet with me tonight musicians can come his name is power his name is healing his name is life let's use his name in power let's don't use it in doubt and fear this is the time as the church ages wrap up I barely got to this they wrap up in Revelation three and in Revelation four it starts with another open door says after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and what this was this this was John being caught up and it represented the bride going into the Rapture Church AG is end very next verse a door is opened in heaven come on up he says where you at tonight come on up we're going to hear that real soon it's almost morning it's almost morning on the earth come on up I say tonight the devil can do his worst he can try to shut every door that he wants to he can try to seal up all of our escapes he can try to trap you every way imaginable but this is the day of the breaking of the seals this is the day of a door of word and power this is the time of a Rapture he can do what he want he couldn't keep Jesus in a tomb 2,000 years ago he couldn't keep Lazarus in a tomb 2,000 years ago and he cannot keep you bound to this earth in this last day I'm telling you it's Rapture time he can do what he wants but I'm running towards an open door I've entered into one
