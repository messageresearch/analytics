========================================

[Music] Every time I think of your kindness. Every time I'm singing your name, Jesus. I never thought my life could look like this. I give thanks every day for your amazing grace. And God, I'm in love with who you are. You are the bright and morning star. You fill me with joy inside of my heart. You bless me. You bless me. When I look at how far you brought me, nothing I could do to [Music] deserve. And when I was a sinner, you called me. And I'm alive by your side because you love me, Lord. And God, I'm in love with who you are. You are the bright and morning star. You fill me with joy inside of my heart. You bless me. You bless me. Oh, when everything seems impossible. You are my peace through every storm. You are the God of miracles. You bless me. You bless me. Thank you. Hallelujah. Thank you. Hallelu. Thank you for all that you have done. Hallelujah. Thank you. Halleluah. Thank you. Hallelu. Thank you for all that you have done. [Music] And God, I'm in love with who you are. You are the bright morning star. You fill me with joy inside of my heart. You bless me. You bless me. And when everything seems impossible, you are my peace through every storm. You are the God of miracle. You bless me. You bless me. Oh, and God, I'm in love with who you are. You are the bright morning star. You fill me with joy inside of my heart. You bless me. You bless me when everything seems impossible. You are my peace through every storm. And you are the God of miracles. You bless me. You bless me. [Applause]
