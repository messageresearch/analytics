in a real special way I believe we're in for a special time this evening we've had good moments already but I believe the angel of the Lord is here to reveal himself to us speak to our hearts amen most of all the lord loves you he cares for each and every one of you he's here to show his love to you and his concerned on your behalf and your needs today amen let's just sing this as brother Ron

never the same one service can make the difference in your life just one time you can go for years and then all of a sudden you just realize he's there and you're standing on Holy Ground and the angel of the Lord is there these have been very special meetings and I'm sure tonight will be very special for someone [Music] we could just grasp the moment that we're standing in we've heard some incredible thoughts already this morning as as we realize that we're we're not just looking to a vision we're walking in it [Music] there was a day where Abraham was fellowshipping with Isaac now throughout eternity God has looked for this moment for your coming home we're under great anticipation of going home but he's even greater anticipating having you there at a table already prepared and got a seat for you thousands of miles long won't it be wonderful amen we have a sister from Norway here her sister her name is Sister Anita Myers and [Music] she has a sister that has a desperate need a mental condition [Music] I'd like to pray for her if I could and before we go to the go to the word this afternoon amen if she is here would you come in mind amen ministers amen I'd like for this whole body to pray amen amen there was a woman left her house and she said if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment if I can just get to him you came a long way there was a man named Jerry as he left his house his daughter would die but he went to the one that couldn't minister now father you see our dear sister just now [Music] Lord she came a long way with great desperation send your word Lord Lord I hear the prophet of God he would say I'm searching for him the spirit father to come back to the body now Lord Jesus I asked you now that you would sin mental condition is just another spiritual condition Satan's sickness that he would put on the body now father at the name of Jesus Christ we ask you send your word to where she's at right now Satan turned her loose at the name of Jesus Christ not the name of a Preacher a name that is above every name a name that is above every Power Of Satan in Jesus Christ's name May our faith rise into another realm tonight for her in your name we praise amen hey man amen God bless you bless your journey amen [Music] oh yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah maybe you have a need tonight and you just like to say Lord [Music] would you remember me you know there's sometimes you just don't hardly know what to say you just grow [Music] but Jesus knows how to touch our hearts I know something about those kind of prayers [Music] Heavenly Father [Music] we sense The Nearness of the Angel of the Lord even now what a wonderful God you are one service One Moment in your presence [Music] our hearts Echo to you you know our most inner beings you know how much we need your touch you see our human Frailty you know without you we can't do anything foreign [Music] but you are the one that makes us special you're the one that touches our hearts you're the one that can take the impossible and make it possible we've seen Miracle after Miracle after Miracle no man can do that [Music] Lord in our hands have been lifted our hearts are now giving into your hands loved ones we place there Lord we don't want to leave them here touch them send your word to them May that world of the Holy Spirit that's brooding in this building now go to where they're at Lord God soften their Spirit Lord Jesus maybe they're deep in sin but God you know how to break the cycle of that I asked you now Lord Jesus touch their hearts minister to them now Lord as we are in our final hours of of our going home Lord May every service count May every song be special Lord May every time we walk through these doors may we never take it for granted [Music] oh God help us Lord you walked to where the more we walk with you the less this world will mean help us today we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we ask you amen and amenity amen amen amen I certainly love you with all of our hearts and I'm certainly honored to Stand Here Again and I don't take it for granted to stand here I'm certainly honored to stand here Satan did his best to keep me from standing here but we're still standing and no doubt many of you are fighting different battles and and I want to thank you for your prayers and uh thank you for your continued love for us and our family and God has provided for us a very incredible team around us to to encourage us and strengthen us in your prayers mean so much to us and I apologize first of all that I couldn't get to shake all of your hands but my body's pretty my body's pretty gets wore out and so the daily journey is Pretty Tough at times so I want to if you could do something for me if you would just just before we read our scriptures would you just look over at your neighbor shake their hand and say brother Ron loves you amen amen amen and I mean that with all my heart I may not let all my heart I hope in this world I have no enemies amen because we don't need to throw no stones at each other or it's life's hard enough as it is and so amen and so we love you thank you for your prayers and we we I have a wonderful nurse here with me and she's been a great companion and and a great Queen for me and I thank her for that amen I I wouldn't want to trade my battle for what brother Tim has had to go through a man losing his Queen but she she's waiting on him tonight in a brand new body and we wouldn't want to call her back for all the money in the whole wide world and and so we just we just are thankful for everything that he's done I'd like to speak to you just for a little bit if you if you don't mind foreign I'd like to speak to you on Satan underestimated you Psalms chapter 46 and verse 1. God is our refuge and strength and a very present help in trouble I'd like for you to read that with me just now God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble you may be seated I believe tonight that this has been on my heart for about three months as I would stand in this Pulpit tonight that this would be my opening statement I am walking out of this storm hey man a few years ago I stood in this pulpit and preached a sermon called take it back it was in October and then from October to December God would speak to me on December the 22nd and speak to me and said if you will trust me I will use you like never before we'd seen phenomenal miracles happen in our lives in our ministry and preached in incredible places had a opportunity to speak in China opportunity to speak in many places overseas many conventions God has allowed us to see phenomenal things happen maybe in my mind Zia was thinking that God was going to take our ministry to an even higher level but sometimes God reminds us this that he has confidence in US that allows battles to come our way it's not confidence in our flesh or even in our spirit but his confidence in deceit and if you remember God had confidence in job before that that Satan could touch his body Satan had to walk before God and he had talked with God and God spoke to him and and in no way am I putting myself on the level of job but I just want to use it for a reference job and he asked God asked him said have you considered my servant job we know the story and many things happened to job more than any of us in this building could even compare God would come to job in any situation God would come to job and when he came down and and came to where job was at God didn't talk to job about the difficulties of all of his trials he didn't tell him about the losing of his children losing of his wealth losing of his health he asked him a question where was you when I laid the foundations of the Earth and he began to describe what heaven was all alike he didn't just begin to describe how great that he was are you with me now I believe that God knows exactly our situations we are reminded in Psalms chapter 91 that the angels of God are encamped about us so we must sometimes look back at the battles that we have went through so if I would consider tonight and look back I would like to remind our enemy have you forgot that I experienced the doctors telling me that I would never walk again after falling 40 feet and I would be paralyzed the rest of my life have you forgotten that it was in a fire after being in a coma for weeks and weeks and and they were going to harvest my organs have you forgotten that God woke us up and restored our minds and restored our bodies restored the lungs have you forgotten all of these things that have happened as a doctor would look over at us the other day a new doctor in the in the palliative care team and she looked over and I watched her reading our report and I just asked her I said what are your readings you said I'm reading your report she said you don't look like your report your report says you're a very sick man [Applause] I want to take us back to a cave experience brother Branham says no my mind is going back to around two years ago would in the room that night that the angel of God came walking in there and said you have been born in this world to take a gift of Divine Healing to the people many will not believe you but now he's going to talk about me yet many will if you'll be sincere and we'll get the people to believe not even cancer shall stand before your prayer let me just let me just say this to you your condition cancer would be one of the greatest goliaths of this day but not even cancer is greater than our God [Applause] when we begin to think about God created his own enemy that God that created the Sun the moon and stars that wrote The Zodiacs in the heavens God's first Bible in the heavens God created it all the other day we were in we were in Saskatoon what was up a couple hours above Saskatoon we were looking for the Northern Lights it was that night that they wouldn't show up but we were looking at the stars and I you know I I I don't know too much about stars and but anyway brother Timothy had an app on his on his phone and and he just kind of pointed it up at certain stars and it would show the the bear yeah oh yeah I could see it then it would show the Milky Way well I could see it then but just a couple of seconds before it I I couldn't see it I I was looking at the whole picture but I I couldn't figure out what it was like but it's in meetings like this that God shows us and you see yourself in the word and God knows exactly how to show you where you're at now he creates his own enemy an infinite God creates an enemy that will fight like a winner knowing he's a loser he will start in heaven he will come to the Earth he will walk right into the Garden of Eden he would he would destroy the the image of the Garden of Eden and he will begin to walk through the DNA of humanity because God chose a Battlefield and it would be in the mind of humanity it's where they would fight two opposing spirits fighting one another but I want to remind the devil tonight we're on God's side [Applause] to us posing Spirits I know this is Elementary life and Hate both of them are incredible powerful our world is filled with hate our world is filled with jealousy and envy but there's a god of love that is greater than all the hate in the entire world faith and doubt are complete opposites positive and negative are complete opposites if you want to live a positive life speak positive things [Applause] light and darkness are complete opposites the scriptures would tell us that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against the rulers of Darkness of this world and against wickedness in high place brother Brandon would remind us that we are in a contest I think it's interesting that our prophet of this age would be a boxer as a Young Man he would be an undefeated boxer he would be a a very lightweight man with a quick hand with a quick eyes that would stand and battle men yet there would be one man uh six second that would that would hit him so hard it felt like it would take the life out of him and he would teach him about being able to take the punch [Applause] we realized that a contest is a is a test of strength it's a test of will it's a test of 40 field we must realize that tonight that there is nothing is great as the power that God put on the inside of you you must realize tonight that you're not trusting in your Humanity yet we listen to our humanity and our feelings our memory our conscience we listen to our imaginations we listen to all of those things in our life and sometimes let that guide us but if we could listen to the word of God and see what the word of God said about us [Applause] let me just say even in my battle retreating and quitting is not even an option [Applause] I'd like to say this to you maybe you're on the fence somewhere another and you're saying well brother Ron I just feel like quitting what are you going to go back to [Applause] okay where are you going to go back to [Music] where you gonna go tell me a messenger that is out there that had a greater Ministry than William Branham tell me a greater life than what you see [Applause] you've heard some of the greatest singers in the entire world standing on this stage [Applause] God has provided the very best you are surrounded by the greatest people in the entire world [Music] but if the enemy could he would divide you he'll tell you he don't that God don't love you the people sitting beside of you don't love you because he gets in your mind but you must not listen to him somebody's got something against you brother Branham said it even in a spot that boxer even in that spot when he'd lost his wife and now his baby's dying the devil began to whisper in his ear and just when he was getting ready to give up his Humanity felt like giving up something rose up on the inside of him I want to report to you regardless of what your circumstances is nothing is impossible to our God nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing foreign the scripture says fear not fear is real it's mentioned 600 times in your Bible so fear is very real but Jesus would remind Jarius fear not the angel will remind the brother Branham fear not I want to remind you to not feel the light all right that's the darkness gets darker and darker fear not Jesus is in US [Applause] we're the final runners sorry I'm going slow but I I want to drive these points home we are the final runners all of those Beyond that's when in the grave that did their best they didn't die in defeat they died in Victory Karen Pruitt did not die in defeat she died in faith and in the truth she stepped from this Dimension to a brand new body and she's dancing and rejoicing we are the final runners God's Got Confidence in the seed that he placed on the inside of you and we refuse to give up we're Mighty in battle we would be like Daniel standing in front of a a den getting ready to step in Moses with two million people standing in a Red Sea shamgar with a six foot stick in his hand David with a rock it looks like Satan gets the odds on you but he underestimated you I want to give you some reasons why Satan underestimates you because he's defeated most of your family DNA and sin has passed all along and and there's been drugs and prostitutes and all different kinds in your family they were lost they were just flesh going through life their books were written and their Grace came on the scene but God rich in Mercy God rich in Mercy he came looking after you you wasn't looking after God but God came looking after you he called you before the foundational world so he knew when you would be born he knew when you would arrive and regardless of the DNA that was stacked against you in your life and in your fleshly Humanity no wonder Satan underestimated you but God my God ignited an eternal seed that cannot be defeated [Applause] brother William said the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass healing is in your body I need a Coke brother van says and you know your enemy and you train for the contest and you're going to have when you meet him you know your enemy and you train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him because you're going to have to meet him and you know you know his you know what his strength is and you train for this contest when you do meet him for it's one thing for sure you're going to meet him and so you train for the contest now training for a contest is just like a boxer his enemy that he's going to meet out there in a contest to fight a real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent his studies his lips knows where he fight where he fights for whether he leans forward or hangs back or fights right or handed or left-handed he studies all of this and then if he's good and smart fighter he gets he gets a sparring partner [Applause] that'll fight just like his opponent fights for he'll know all the licks when he gets to the place and I think that's very good for Christians to do and now if you want to start training start at John chapter 3 and verse 16. the golden Rules start out right with that and you'll and you'll get on the floor and then train for it for the for The Knockout punches because you're going to have to use them [Applause] listen it's not just for the preachers to do every one of us has got to fight [Music] this ain't Hollywood you gotta fight oh my brother Ron I've been knocked down and bruised and beaten and I've been went through a whole lot of things that I've been in sin and out of sin and I've just yeah you get knocked down get back up Muhammad Ali would whisper in his opponent's ears is that all you got after they've exhausted themselves is that all you got is that the best punch that you got are you wore out yet you're gonna lay on the floor in just a few minutes let's give these people a good show [Applause] Satan would have done got you he would have done destroyed you if he could but you're still standing why don't you tell him is that all you got he would have done took your life if it had took it sin would have consumed you if it could have it's gonna take a stronger wind than this [Music] brother Isaiah you and your wife please stare Satan thought he had him he thought he had him their life was a mess just a few years ago but intermediate intermediate you didn't know what was going on but in a meeting two omnipotence was meeting foreign it wasn't you looking for God but God came looking for you his wife last night was she came to this meeting looking for the Supernatural and she was standing in the meeting last night and now she was standing there was last night the night before night before she was standing there and she felt a hand on her shoulder and she came to realize nobody was touching her I tell you the master knows how to touch Our Lives One Touch One Touch will change your life now the credit says that the boy in Finland didn't happen quite like it did so I want to go ahead since the boxing match is on [Applause] Satan you underestimated us we were flying into Monroe and I'm I have the note that I have right here about brother Guido telling me about the meeting after the boy in Finland and so I'm listening to brother biscoll preach I don't remember when but anyway he's preaching and right in the middle he stops and he tells the story about a sister goes to a nursing home and she meets somebody there that she knew as a child and they begin to talk about about their lives and begin to catch on catch up for a bit and then after a while it becomes spiritual and they begin to talk about where they fellowship at and the one says well I go to a Pentecostal church and and the sister says well I I fell a ship around the message of William Branham and said you have you ever heard of him she said well and kind of an odd way my husband is the one that drove the car that hit the little boy and he witnessed the whole miracle now Andrew set him beside it for me and I and I I know I've got this note that I'm getting ready to talk about and I tell Andrew I tell Andrew what brother biscoll has told about the story I said if we need confirmation on it yeah if we need confirmation on it here is a confirmation and I turned to Connie and I began to tell her she said in on this side of me and I and I and I tell her what I've just heard and she said listen to what I'm listening to right now and brother Branham is telling the story about the little boy thank you brother Guido on it on one of his last trips with us he told me he went to the place where all of that took place at me and you can help me if I get this wrong went to the place where all of that took place at at the next meeting people had heard about the miracle that took place and there was there was 12 rows of cots and wheelchairs of there and when brother Branham walks in the building he hasn't said a word when he walks in the building all of those cops and wheelchairs just empty [Music] [Applause] no brother Branham said said this he says all right quit fighting he said how do you feel brother Branham when you stand there and see the people coming in different languages and things are you afraid no no sir no sir he said so he said never been failed afraid yet because he told me so and I believe it's the truth are you with me now if he told me tonight to go to the presidential graveyard and raise up George Washington tomorrow morning I'd invite the world [Applause] come on are you with me now brother man would say if I've not told you the truth made God strike me dead Satan was opposing him but he couldn't do it Jesus said himself if I do not the works of my father then Believe Me Not if I claim to have an anointing and do not the works of my father because I am anointed by him and with him it's not me that doeth the works the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works and if I do not them works then don't believe me but if I do then believe them now that was for the Messiah the for messiah it's the church all right yeah are you ready John 14 12 Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also so why should we not believe that these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they'll cast out devils in my name they'll speak with new tongues they'll shout they'll dance president said the modern Church don't want any of them screaming shouting that's 238 dungeons around her whooping I'm afraid a lot of modern message churches don't want Holy Ghost Field preachers Hallelujah but that's the kind that shakes the devil you get your child full of the Holy Ghost you won't have to worry about drugs pornography alcohol the wrong kind of friends but if you get them full of the Holy Ghost they'll shake the house of hell why should these we be scared of that God said I am the Lord thy God who healeth all thy diseases ah now let me just say this to you there's a lot of people that can talk about a fight that ain't never been anyone there's a lot of people that are self-made Champions and they never got a scratch they're like lieutenants that just come out of school that think that they can command men and they never saw bullets flying and and the fire going on but we got some people in this building that are battle tested for the word they are built for laodicea conditions they will overcome it will overcome they know how to pray because prayer is like an atomic weapon against the devil God Jesus said if a house be divided against itself if Satan cast out Satan then his kingdom is divided don't underestimate the devil he's too smart Satan ain't going to cast himself out he's got you confused Satan can't cast out Satan me cast myself out why I know better than that notice don't you underestimate Jesus Christ he's the power above all powers he's the power above all powers I want to say it to all the Realms of hell can hear it Jesus Christ is the power above all powers don't be afraid of Satan as long as you're in him but if you're not in him you better tremble but if you're in him not even death itself can harm you you're free from all field [Applause] when I think about that I want to shout hallelujah so I stand here tonight regardless of the conditions and regardless of what doctors say and regardless of the battles and regardless of the chemo that I have to take every day [Applause] I am not afraid I will not run and I will not quit now I want to talk to you about your battle if I can stand here and preach the word under this anointing and under this condition how about you and your situation let's stand and fight like never before let's finish this the scriptures in Numbers Chapter 23 and verse 19 said God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent have they said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken or shall he not make it good behold I have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and I could not reverse it he hath not beheld the iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel the Lord his God is with him and the shout of the king is among them what's going on in their churches what's going on the move right now this is what we preached about for decades and now it's happening don't take this for granted this will push us right into a Rapture into a body change don't be against the move of God this is what's going to transform your body brother Brown says now God always has got somebody that's not scared way back on the backside of a desert hurting his puppy's sheep was a little old Ruddy stoop-shouldered boy that knowed something about God he wasn't a trained fighter but when he heard that giant make that expression he said do you mean to tell me that you'll stand here and let that uncircumcised full listing defy the armies of the Living God if you all are scared let me let me if you are a bunch of chicken-hearted preachers let me go find it sometimes we're looking for things that are already Among Us John first John chapter 3 and verse 2. beloved now I don't know how it was in your school but now means now [Applause] look at your neighbor and say now means now [Applause] look at your other neighbor say now means now that don't mean Wednesday night that don't mean two weeks from now that don't mean next year now means now [Applause] you are sons of God you are Daughters of God you stepped out of Eternity into a space of time he knew when you would be born he knew your situations of your life and he put you here for a purpose when your purpose is done he'll take you home [Applause] but while you're here you've got a job to do it ain't lay on your couch and feel sorry for yourself and give excuses it ain't to have a pity party the rest of your life let's fight fight with everything within you fight for your family fight for your home fight for your healing perfect dream it's worth fighting for oh in the next chapter ye are of God that means that's where your origin came from so many times we as Humanity want to trace our natural DNA and then our natural DNA we want it to be royalty we want it to be a part of the Adam's Presidential Library [Applause] and we found out we were slaves sorry [Applause] but that really went for all of you guys I just happened to pick on Joe I didn't went for all of y'all you thought you were special just trace your DNA a little bit baby just Trace her just a little bit there's going to be some things laying in there you ain't going to want to see there's a lot of nonsense in there there's a lot of illegitimacy in there there's a lot of stuff in there that you ain't gonna want to see but there's only one thing that can clean all that up books of sin was already on your life when you was a little bitty baby but God knows how to clear the deed he knows how to clear the neither that life no wonder Satan underestimated your life you begin to grow up and as you begin to grow up you went to school and you learned words in French that you shouldn't say [Applause] your mom and daddy Christian people never said them words but you went to school and you said words you come home and said words they they don't work here we don't say them kind of words who taught you to steal extra cookie who taught you to have jealousy who taught you the lust you get up a little older and you don't have a new birth you look in the mail and go I need to look like Marilyn Monroe News Bulletin she wore a size 16. Hollywood will point you to where our lives are disasters [Applause] soap operas will point you to where lives or disasters some of your friends that have been around you in their lives they have been disasters in their lives what what made you different you came from God you came from God I'm going somewhere here I'm going somewhere here and just like the negative and positive polls God sent his great magnet over your way and you could not resist this let's go Hallelujah he's sending over your friends and they didn't want nothing to do with it he sent it over your enemies and they didn't want nothing to do with it but God brought you to church and you had a lot of stuff on your life and the power of the word began to clean up your life and it cleans you and today you're not even the same person you used to be all right people go to Alcoholics Anonymous and they will stay clean for a little while because the power of a vowel is powerful but it won't hold you [Applause] the power of a vowel will not hold you you you could say it over and over and over and over and over and over again but Along Comes an enticing spirit and it can be a lot of different things that come to entice you because he just keep throwing bait he'll I'm not a fisherman but the hill I hang around one is really good but but you know you just keep throwing bait that they'll finally bite [Applause] and so Satan will keep throwing bait and if he can get you to look like he did in Ellie Sanders she just stopped and before long she was dancing [Applause] that he could just get you to stop and look at the wrong sights or to hear the wrong music [Applause] if there's no anchor in your heart you'll fall over and over again but I'm going to say this to you I don't care who you are in this building if you're failing 52 times there is a power of the blood that can raise you up maybe up to this night Satan has written a lot of things in your book but after tonight let the blood of Jesus Christ wipe it completely clean [Applause] is this all right I felt led to preach this so here we are let me just say Satan will talk to you into robbing the bank and then he'll call the law you can be seated incredible an enemy that was built to oppose God now becomes our opposer when he's got an entire world think about this for a minute other people have calamities other people have discouragements other people fall other people have car wrecks other people have AK-47s pulled out on them and are killed I came to this point the other day in another service in our church two of our kids was driving down the road and three guys in mask rolled up beside of them at the same time I was saying this and they rolled up with an AK-47 pointed out after them and God spared their lives there's a difference between you and everybody else [Applause] brother Brown would say this who has the most power before God an angel an angel is a servant is that right they're his servants what are you I'm saying this I'm going slow because I want you to catch it his son and daughter who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side brother Branham answers his own question The Sinner that's been saved by by Grace has more Authority in heaven then the Archangel that has stood by his side without sin because he's a son a son has more Authority [Applause] I feel like we're just before the coming of the Lord so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna step out on the edge here just for a bit sister Debbie would you would you stand sister Debbie shared something with us and I I'm going to tell it because it's too it's too good not to tell she's not given to these kinds of things to don't think you've ever seen anything quite like that who was preaching there not because of me but she saw through that door the angel of the Lord stepped through that door not open it but she saw the angel of the Lord stepped through the door and come out here isn't that right amen thank you thank you a couple years ago we were here brother Wayne and we witnessed the angel of the Lord stand right there isn't that right that's right and he was standing there and he was standing there with his arms like this right here and he had his hand and then he put his hand right here brother Josh was preaching isn't that correct and brother Josh was preaching as he was standing there and he had his hands like this and he put his hand like that and when I saw him put his hand like that I don't care if you don't believe me it's all right [Music] put his hand like that brother Josh is all over the stage he had had a lot more energy than I knew I kind of have to conserve a bit but anyway he's running all over the stage you know this to be the truth because he saw it as well and brother Josh would come over and put his hand on it and then he'd take charge in the cross and he'd come over and put his hand on it and go charge on a cross come over and put his hand on that foreign meetings on Saturday night brother Tim Pruitt walks to the pulpit and he speaks on Entertaining Angels because they're here to finish the work Two Worlds are coming together blending together after he finished and to me it was listen I I've been around my buddy a long time now I thought it was the greatest sermon he ever preached go listen to it go listen to it it's fine where you're lifting Humanity no I'm lifting the gift that's inhumanity and for those that are in this community that's missing the gift they're missing out listen I'm way too late in the late ending around I I'm not planning on being in the tribulation period [Applause] if you are build a bomb shelter turn all your money into gold get yourself a food supply because that's what you're going to need for tribulation period and you're going to need Faith to get yourself through it but for me I'm planning on the moment of the twinkle little this body is going to be changed and when brother Tim finished sister Lydia is she here could you stand begin to speak in tongues she began to speak in tongues brother Andrew began to interpret because this is what the prophecy said would happen in this age now I know I'm I know I'm making the devil real nervous right now when those when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost and he began to scream out to those people these are not drunken as you suppose but this is that that was that was spoken by the prophet Joel the prophecy has intercepted with time [Applause] and now is in flesh what you are witnessing God is not just with us but God now is in US we have become the Tabernacle of God he's not looking for a building he's looking for a body that he can live in [Applause] so what you're witnessing is this is that the final voice to the final age this is that that was was prophesied bone of his bone life of his life power of his power Spirit of his spirit this is the very Breath of God this is more than Tim Pruitt this is more than Ron Spencer this is more than Joshua Von's brunt this is more than Johnny this is God taking him and flesh hello what about you here's a man that built a table for brother Tim Pruitt could you stand that's all right he's had a heart condition he's not just had a heart condition but he's had a leak and he's an aorta valve isn't that correct yeah God dropped this in my heart you did a you did a you gave a servant of the Lord a blessing and now God is going to do a hard operation thank you brother Ron are you scared no sir I know where I'm standing we have been commissioned to speak it not stand there and wrestle with their Humanity but speak the word and believe the word don't you speak to your troubles right now let me see I feel like I'm exploding up here because I know where we're going now listen to brother Branham as he prays and as I read this probably nobody else drinks Coke in the Pulpit but you know I remember aren't you breaking order I broke a lot of orders in my life the brother Brandon says we have a right to enforce if you don't enforce who will foreign if you don't enforce who will Who will do the job who would do the job if you don't enforce it brother Tim Pruitt walked into your room brother stinky mad at the Devil I learned a long time ago don't call Tim Pruitt if you want to live a long time if you're dying and they're giving up and they're going to harvest your organ don't call him you'll be standing here 15 years later preaching thank you were dying you know you were dying but he walked into your room he called me before he left the parking lot and said pray with me I lived 17 hours and I prayed with with brother Tim agreeing because prayer is not that some priest prayer is a God and we have a god-given right the power of life and death is on the inside of our tongue and we have a power of the word to enforce our rights own Satan and sake giving back give it back speaking you can't have his life you give him back in the name of Jesus Christ thank you now maybe you have been enslaved to sin and I'm going here pornography is a demon that is so private that only you and that devil Fellowship yet it's so destructive it will steal your Victory I'm preaching to you because I know it it's not just for boys it's for girls as well you live in a society that pornography prevails he wants you to destroy your future husband and wife relationship he wants to destroy your morals [Applause] he wants to destroy your confidence [Applause] and every time you think you get a little victory Satan uphold the chain you know sometimes we get ball and chain religion and you know most time for a prisoner they only got a chain so long in the olden days they had a chain that would be about 15 feet so you could work and you go out to the end of your chain and it would pull because they had a ball that only that you would have to carry but you couldn't carry it far and nurse sometimes you can come to church and you can go so far and all of a sudden you get pulled knowing there's a ball back there last night was a prayer line tonight's going to be delivering tonight now here's what Satan does to you he'll let you go and then all of a sudden he'll start whispering in your ear I'm going to tell somebody I'm gonna tell somebody gonna find out on you and then you feel so sweet stinking rotten and he just holds you yeah he holds you and he holds you I'm going into a dark pit right now to help you I'm sorry I'm not preaching on third pull right now but I'm going the third pull is in action It's actually an action because I'm walking in your cave I'm walking in your pit cause in the morning I'm gonna come out there may be some lines in your pit but tomorrow morning I'm gonna come out foreign ography yours might be a lot of different things but I want to tell you to not he's in the building and listen after tonight you can tell the devil you tell who you want to but Jesus set me free and I'm so glad that Jesus Set Me Free I'm so glad that Jesus liberated me watch him pray Satan you can't hold them no more they're God's children right now and I'm bringing that before you you have to take your hands off of their life they belong to God now I claim them for you I claim them as trophies of Christ's love at Calvary I challenge you to a debate you don't have any legal power you have no power over them you didn't have it in the first place you was only bluffing them you was only bluffing Christ stripped you out of everything that you had at Calvary and he stripped every Power that you ever had you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your blood foreign Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13. I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me I'm coming to an end Paul would write this from a prison you know this is my favorite scriptures and we know that all things say it with me all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose now if there's anything that anybody that I could I would want to hear this tonight I'd like for the devil to listen up put your hearing aids in Satan I want you to listen just for the next couple of minutes for whom he did for no that's me I want you to go ahead though that's me [Applause] that's me that's me that's me he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and remember what justification is it is as though you never did it in the first place I don't care what your book says Isaiah it's as though you never did it in the first place just tell the devil go back to hell just tell him go back to hell where it came from I am a son of God forgiven I am a Son of God I am his son and whom he justified them he also glorified and what shall we there say to these things [Music] Satan you underestimated me [Applause] go ahead say it Satan you underestimated me it is the number one rule for an opponent to underestimate you number one go ahead and put your finger out there Satan you broke the number one rule you underestimated me Hallelujah what is it 450 people here tonight I want you to read it with me if God be false who can be against us God before us who can be against say say that to your neighbor [Applause] sometimes you get the picture wrong you got Goliath as a great big man and David is a little bitty boy but actually the picture was upside down because there was a great big God on the inside of a little bit Ebola that was way bigger than a great big Gala it ain't you that's gonna whip the devil it's the god that's on the inside of you take that devil take that devil take that double Derek before I walked out of here a voice whispered into my ear said tonight might be your last night preaching here ever I said well Deborah I'm gonna whip you tonight thank you Hallelujah as the musicians come I want to read you one more quote while you're standing brother Branham said that I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God this is almost unfair thank you tell the devil don't know what to do with him I'm going to read it slow so you can repeat it to your neighbor and I want you to say it loud enough that you hear it yourself I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God the devil don't know what to do with him all right brother Brown walked out of a building one night and he preached future home he looked at his son and he said Billy did you get it I see I did he said he said Billy did you get it yeah I did and he said Billy did you get it he said no I did it I'm going to ask you something I'm not brother Brown but did you just get it let's not have this meeting and you travel thousands of miles let's not just come and clap our hands and have music but did you get it Hallelujah I feel so good I could run I I particularly don't know what those cancer cells are going to do but in a few days I'm gonna have red hair [Applause] probably gonna weigh about 150 pounds and I'm gonna run all over heaven one more thing Satan can touch your flesh and he can touch your spirit but God put the seed of God on the inside of you where Satan couldn't get to [Music] [Applause] your head's about just a moment and you could just just to be real honest just now because remember at the very beginning of this service I said that tonight could be the difference in your entire life and maybe you'd like to say brother Ron I've been struggling with very secretive things and I just need to raise my hand before God and say God I need your help I need your help I need your help with this wow I need your help I just knew I want to be honest I need your help you can live a Victorious life you don't have to be a Slave I want to tell you there's I got some really good news you can walk out of this building tonight and lay your excuses down this median is tremendous when it becomes you and God it's more than just your neighbors and one another but it's you and God right now in this moment maybe buy an exercise and nobody looking around maybe about exercising just stepping out from where you're at walking in this way and you're just like say I want to lay some things at the altar that only I and God know about and I just want to lay it here I don't want to leave it here I want to leave it here that don't de-christianize none of us because we're all in a battle we're all in a battle I'm not here to stir you up or make you feel bad I want to tell you there's help here for you never think that we're trying to beat you we're trying to help you we're trying to tell you Jesus is here for you he wants to help you he didn't go to the woman at the will make her feel bad he he brought her life Hallelujah he didn't go to the Tomb of the legion and give him a bunch of what had caused him to be there but in a few moments he was a completely different man and he went home to live a different life I don't know what you've dealt with in your last little bit but God would lay it on my heart to speak this on Saturday evening to tell you that Satan don't have enough to keep you and his ball and chain don't have to hold you forever because God's got the key to the door and he knows how to take and empty all of that out and fill you with the holy spirit that you can live a private overcoming life and become a lighthouse where you're at to your community to your family to your neighborhood to release power in your prayer life and when you come to church you're a complete different person Heavenly Father we feel the presence of the Lord all through this meeting but especially right now Satan underestimates the power of God he hunched or underestimates the blood of Jesus Christ so he contrast to continue to hold on to real bona fide Christians Warren with them maybe because he's only got a short time to work but father you're a God rich in Mercy and your mercy endureth forever Lord we don't have to tell you be prisoners or slaves maybe we've driven thousands of miles we come to a meeting like this and it's you that changes our life even before we stepped out of the Pew it was you that was dealing with us but we know it's us and you now Lord if we were sitting at the table with you and you looked across the table and could read our whole heart and begin to talk to us no doubt you wouldn't do it in a condemning spirit but there would be something in your voice that would change our life Lord Jesus we have become aware that the angels of the Lord are in the building you've allowed us to be made known that that angels have come and the pillar of fire has been seen in this meeting but Lord you also want to make us aware that we're your children and we have more Authority than an angel in heaven now we came from you and that was our origin and we're going to go back and you placed us here for a purpose to overcome maybe it's as a father to rededicate our life to be a real daddy maybe Satan's robbed us of our time robbedness of our time with our wife and robbed us over time with our children maybe it's a mama that's got her eyes on a lot of different things in life and Satan has robbed her of her victory maybe even a Revival of prayer life in that home I believe you're the god that can take a meeting like this and a home can be rededicated I believe that Revival fires can start again in in hearts of believers not that we've done any great sin but just got a little cool in our life maybe words have been said that's caused hardship even to our own Humanity father if we could have the Zeal of this hour to repent to repent of our pride repent of our own arrogance and say Lord come and soften my heart cleanse my spirit renew my mind tonight father maybe we've lost our joy [Music] we've lost the joy of our salvation David would say creating me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me restore to me the joy of my salvation we danced this morning We Worship the Lord through this meeting but Lord You're mindful that you don't want one person to go back in the same old habits and the same life of a backslidden condition you would take the time in a meeting like this to go after one of your children you'd leave 90 and 9 to go get one so Lord go to the cave or the den Lord that makes us love you so much more foreign battle to word to where that feels like giving up doctors have asked me are you are you ready to give up my repetitive story is I'll never give up Lord may we have that not only as a in our natural life may we have that in our Supernatural life we'll never give up we'll never turn back we'll never retreat but we'll constantly fight oh Lord Jesus Minister standing all across this building from Belgium Dallas Ohio Virginia Lord we're standing here tonight Lord Jesus Lord renew our church like never before Lord don't let us miss nothing that's going on let us be sensitive to the spirit of the Lord May our eyes be Keen May our hearts be clear Lord reveal to us Lord exactly what we have need of [Music] Lord may we not misalign may we be exactly as the orchestra would play may your timing be perfect in Jesus Christ's name and any man any man any man amen any man maybe wherever you're standing now could you just lay your hand over on your neighbor [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah won't you pray for them you're not alone in this battle there's parents here that's got children that's gone the wrong direction I want to say this to you God ain't forgotten young man walked through this prayer line last night sins wrecked his life but I

day [Music] rekindle the fire in my life rekindle the joy of my life refill me with the Holy Ghost tonight Lord I open myself up to you fill my life fill my life fill my life fill my life I want to repeat this prayer Satan turn them loose take your hands off of God's Property in the name of Jesus Christ May every sick person be healed here tonight May every devil be driven out Satan you can't

here right now we went to the room and Aaron Oglesby was called to preach and became aware in that room and these were the words you'll never be the same you'll never be the same and immediately after that a vision came that my little baby Isaac would be born God not only showed me that baby that would be born out of impossible signs he even gave me his name Isaac Jackson Breeden you see he's the God that holds it all in his hands that's the god that's in this building now and your impossibilities that you think are so impossible he's got it in his hands right now and that same God is on the inside of you brother that God that said let there be a son and he believed his own word and it came into existence that God chose you to live in so it don't matter how you feel as a matter of fact it don't even matter how you think you just take God's word and believe God's word upon your promises right now and you take God in his word and all things are possible with them that belief all right
