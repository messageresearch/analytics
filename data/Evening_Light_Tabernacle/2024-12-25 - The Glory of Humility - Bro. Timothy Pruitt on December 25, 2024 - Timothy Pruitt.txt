and verse 26 reads like this and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto the city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came unto her and said hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at the saying and cast in her M mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God yes and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold th cousin Elizabeth she is also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called baren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her I was reading a few quotes on Christmas today going through this just want to read something to you for a moment so today we find out that they have injected everything all of our holidays are polluted our Easter there's no more about the resurrection of Christ it's some kind of Easter rabbit some new hat or some little pink duck has nothing to do with the resurrection of Christ no more than Santa Claus has anything to do with the birth of Jesus Christ but us the world the commercial world has got everything in such a tangled and mess until no wonder God is Justified to burn the whole thing up and he's going to do it he promised he would he has to to get all of this mess in order there's no hope for it it's all gone but now in this hour of Darkness as I say is what we live in still Christians should be holding forth that light that there is a truth to Christmas that is the birth of Jesus Christ the son of God you know he said in Rome he said they make the same celebration that was the son God Su God's day they made it the son of God's birthday when they join joined it all together he said but what difference does it make see if it was in July or August or whatever might might be it's still the sacredness of remembering that God gave us the hope that we have in US and now you say well the rest of them's all Santa Claus and going on like that W they just might as well do it no sir that is not a p this is not a pagan celebration to us this is a sacred hour if there had been no Christmas there would have been no Resurrection if there would have been no Christmas there would have been no love there there had been no Christmas there would have been no peace if there have been there would have been no Christmas there have been no Hereafter for a Believer if there had been no Christmas he says what if there wasn't a real Christmas if there had not been a real Christmas things wouldn't be the way they are tonight if there wasn't a Christmas there wouldn't have been no salvation he said now we're facing Christmas again and it's too bad it's been changed they've changed it the real meaning of it being the birth of Christ to now as Santa Claus has taken the place of Christ in Christmas some fiction of Chris Kringle coming down a chimney and with a sack of toys on his back that visits the whole world in one night he said I don't know what you think about it it's all right I guess if you tell your children of that but he said the scripture says Thou shalt not lie and then someday they're going to ask you is Jesus the same thing as Santa Claus is is he real too when they find out there's no Santa Claus he said I think it's best myself that might not be your idea but I'm tell I'm not telling you how to to raise your children but if they catch you lying on that then they're going to say someday or maybe this is a this is also a lie so just tell them the truth the straight truth and then they'll know what you mean so no matter how bad the outside looks and what they're doing out there there that should not bother us from making Christmas what it should be amen [Music] God resty Mery gentle let nothing you dismay remember Christ Our Savior was born on Christmas day to save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray oh Tidings of Comfort and Joy comfort and joy oh Tidings of Comfort and Joy he has come for us this Jesus he's the Hope For All Mankind he has come for us the Messiah born to give us life amen switch by Tidings of this same how that in Bethlehem was born

for us the Messiah born to give us Life Born to give us [Music] life for [Music] he was not the one we thought would come we were looking for a king but he didn't come in glory the author of the

Caesar Agustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made of serenius was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth under Judea under the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espouse wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end there wasn't the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring unto you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you that you shall find the Babe wrapped in swallen clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were going away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a Manger and when they seen it they made known abroad the Sayan which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen as it was told unto them how God unfolded himself and he came in a Christmas PR package and was laid on a straw bed first thing he had to put his little head on was straw and a dirty piece of swadding cloth wrapped around him the last thing he had was a th Crown of Thorns with a dirty rag wrapped over his eyes and he was hit on the head saying if your Prophet tell us who hit you and then he was nailed to a cross that was love reaching out when his own children cried for his blood and screamed father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing that was love reaching out he said the church don't want him today they want a Creed but we need love the church is dying by Creeds it can only live by love because love is eternal life love overcomes all things love is the most powerful force there is no they didn't want him because they knew what was in the gift but some of them had it revealed to them what the gift really was what was really in the gift so some of them looked into it I believe the first one to look in that Christmas package I believe it was Angels cuz the Angels knew it it was revealed to them they knew it and they came out on the hillside and told it to the Shepherds but perhaps little Mary want you to listen to this real close as a quote little Mary sitting up there tired tired and Dusty poor old Shepherd boy come by stinking like sheep seeing that little mother sitting there meant something just like people today can see there's something that's fixing to happen tremendous times maybe an old Shepherd boy came by and seen that little mother and something struck him said I have some cool water here in this flask would you want to drink and the little family thanked him the little mother to be taking the drink of water maybe that was one of the little Shepherds laying there that night on the hill and down in the stable and the little baby crying the world didn't want him there wasn't no room for him but it was at the same time a shepher out on the hill the Angels came down and begin to sing The First Noel today in the city of David is born unto you Christ the Savior said that's the only way anybody in the world will ever know what's in that package it has to be revealed to you you'll turn it down maybe say it's fanaticism but when you get the Revelation you'll seek after it and you'll open it up and see what's on the inside and God will come in and suck with you and you with him then you're ready to open the door and let him in that little package that may be knocking at your heart tonight the greatest Christmas gift that was ever given the first one and the greatest one the little package knocking in the heart of a man I'll come in and suck you'll never know it until it's revealed to you but when it's revealed to you then you will go hunting for it yourself amen e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e it's very striking to me as I was looking at this today brother Brandon would even speak about the shepherd who may have gave her a drink of water then they picked that up there in that film and then to see how that he was cast out of the religious Realms but when he came to Jesus he bound the broken that's what Jesus does and I and as they portrayed that in that film of when they heard and it was revealed they went they went looking for him and it was was in a place of humility it wasn't as they thought it would be in a you know maybe many thought it would be in a cathedral or he would have a angel salute as it were and come down on a red carpet into Caiaphas his Temple but brother Brandon would say it so eloquently he said how striking it is Jehovah born crying over a manure pile Jehovah born in a manger of straw there is your Everlasting sight to the proud and the puffed up amen the intellectuals who have involved in their own Theology and denied the truth of god Jehovah God a crying baby in a stinking Barn then we think we have the right to be proud holding up our nose criticizing acting as though we were somebody here's your real sign this is the right one Jehovah playing as a boy Jehovah working in a carpenter shop Jehovah washing the feet of fishermen I'll give you a sign said God not the sign of the white collared priesthood not the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you will want or think suitable but it is an everlasting sign it is the greatest sign to all Jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised bleeding with thorns on his brow and spit on his face mocked and said it not Jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked on a cross while Hypocrites Jered and dared him to come down off the cross Jehovah ding Jehovah praying and nothing happened Jehovah died then Jehovah died that is a sign for all men now there isn't another one like it it is the greatest sign of all then Darkness Came Upon the Earth and they put him in a tomb and there he laid three days and night until the earthquake Shadow the shattered the gr Gloom of night and he came forth Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended on high then Jehovah returned to indwell in his church Church Jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire Jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and Empower his people once more Jehovah came in this time to stay in his people and again Jehovah heals the sick and again he raises the dead and manifest himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation Jehovah came down and he raised The Prostitute to sin no more he came down to the drunkard with fly bro fly blows on his face as he lay unconscious in the gutter yes Jehovah came to M be manifested in the flesh and manifested through the flesh Jehovah came God in us the hope of glory yes Jesus came and shed his blood and set the captive free he came and redeemed his lost sheep he gave eternal life that they should never perish and he won't lose one of them but will raise them up again at the last day Hallelujah as I think about it his birth brought his life and his life brought his death and his death brought his resurrection and his resurrection brought his Ascension and his and his Ascension brings his return his humility brought forth His Glory Hallelujah and his name shall be wonderful counselor Prince of Peace and the Mighty God is as as Paul said in Philippians 2:5 he said let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation he came in humility that he might leave in glory amen he he made of himself no reputation he took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men aren't you glad about that tonight and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became o obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name and at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of the things of Heaven and the things of Earth and the things under the Earth and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Hallelujah he came with no name but he left for the name that's above every name Hallelujah the name of Jesus Christ amen and by Revelation in this name of who
