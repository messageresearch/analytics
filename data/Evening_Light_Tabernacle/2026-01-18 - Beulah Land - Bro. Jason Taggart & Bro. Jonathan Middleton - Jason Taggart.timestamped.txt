[0:14] I'm kind of home
[0:18] sick
[0:20] for the country
[0:26] to which I'm
[0:33] been before.
[0:38] No surprise
[0:44] will there be spoken
[0:50] for time
[0:57] anymore. Oh,
[1:03] beautiful land
[1:08] I want for
[1:12] you.
[1:16] And someday
[1:21] hold me
[1:23] still.
[1:28] There my hope
[1:33] shall be eternal.
[1:40] to the land
[1:45] sweeping
[1:47] the land.
[1:52] I'm looking out
[1:58] across
[1:59] the river
[2:04] to where my face
[2:10] going to end inside.
[2:16] There's just a few
[2:21] more days to labor
[2:28] and then I'll take
[2:34] my heavenly
[2:40] new
[2:45] I'm longing for you.
[2:52] And someday
[2:57] only
[2:59] I see
[3:04] where my heart
[3:09] shall be
[3:11] eternal.
[3:16] You land
[3:21] sweet.
[3:24] Sing with us four more times.
[3:28] You love
[3:34] I'm longing for
[3:37] you.
[3:41] And someday
[3:46] all thee I'll say
[3:52] where my heart
[3:58] shall be
[4:04] You are
[4:09] sweet.
[4:16] Oh, you love the lamb.
[4:21] Sweet sweet
[4:25] lamb.
