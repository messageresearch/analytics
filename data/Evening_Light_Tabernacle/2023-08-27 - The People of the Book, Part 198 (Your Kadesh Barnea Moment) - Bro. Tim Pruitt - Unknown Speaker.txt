that behalf but half of that heart right there listen he does Miracles so great I don't know what he's about to do this morning but I know he's a miracle working God I know he's a miracle working God

company we're going to have all of our young our prodigals come back home amen hallelujah it's the hour of Passover we're here we're here in the moment we're about to be changed in a moment the twinkling of an eye we're looking to him this morning our god reigns amen amen God bless you my goodness let's turn to the scripture this morning let's go to First Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 1. amen I know this is going to be a serious thought in one sense but on the other hand it's a rejoicing thought so you you can either you can either take it one way or the other you can either rejoice in it or you can go back to Egypt and go back to bondage amen so you can either look into the things of God and say it's mine or you can turn around and walk back as many others will do amen but this morning I'm going to be speaking on your Kadesh barnia moment and ma'am First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud and all passed to the Sea and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and the Sea and all did sit did and all did eat the same spiritual meat and all to drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness and now these things were an example to the the intent that we should not lust after evil things give me the next verse two and neither be idolaters as some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and Rose up to play amen God bless you you can be seated interesting this is where the text that I took for the very first sermon I ever preached when I was 15 years old I preached right here from this scripture but this morning we're going to be looking at this because I believe that we are in a very very serious hour very serious time and um we are in a Kadesh barnia moment as far as the bride of Christ as the people of the message now of course um just to preface this a little bit that Israel had journeyed from Egypt to Mount Sinai where they had met God in the pillar of fire upon the mountain and from there they journeyed 11 days to Kadesh and we're on the border of the promised land if I understand right it was only 30 more miles and they would have been right into their Promised Land but they were close enough to send representatives from each tribe to the land to discover if they lived in Walled cities or tent or you know to kind of check out the land just bring a report back and Cadence Barney is a place that as Moses and the children of Israel camp where they sent these to this promised land that spies and and um and it was intended that that would leave from kadash and go into the promised land instead what happened is that they left from Kadesh and went wandering in the wilderness for 40 years and and brothers and sisters the message Community stands here at Kadesh barnia and and I wanted to say that the promise of the word of God since the Seven Seals are open the mysteries of God have been revealed that that the promises are true and that our our God is real as we heard his song a while ago and the Holy Ghost is Our Land and we can however blessing of it amen we can have everything that it possesses we don't just look and emphasize in one thing like a jumper a shout or a dancer neither do we just emphasize just healing or Miracles or signs or wonders but we believe every bit in the book amen we believe every promise of the word of God it belongs to us as Believers this morning amen and I believe that it has been open to us in this day and many are standing on the edge and looking in and and you know it's not just that and I I don't want you just to take it just as that but I want you to also realize many or you are at your own kedish barnya moment sometimes when you're sick and you're um diseased in your body or you got a a horrible situation that's going on in your family you come to a kiddish Barney a moment where you are going to decide whether I'm going to believe the word of God and possess the land possess that promise or whether on the other hand I'm going to turn and go back into the same old wanderings of wilderness and my doubts and my fears and my unbelief so you don't don't just take it as them and day but I want you to ever want to make this real personal to your own life because you will have not just one Cadence Barney a moment but you will have many kids born here moments where you've got to make a decision am I going to believe the word of God and I am I going to take him as what he said or am I going to turn around and walk away from it and say I can't do it I can't possess it now they they had come to Mount Sinai already from Egypt and it journeyed there there they had a wonderful experience of course they had many wonderful experiences even down in Egypt they had wonderful experiences they saw the power of God and the Deliverance of the Lord in the hand of God go forth and and then on the other hand they went and and uh that would go to the Red Sea and they would see the mighty Deliverance there and their enemies dead in the Red Sea and then they would cross them there and water would come out of a rock where that the people would actually murmur because there was no water in the desert and God would actually Smite The Rock instead of smiking the people because the people should have been smitten because of their unbelief in their murmuring but God said take the Rock and smite The Rock instead and out of that came life-giving water so they had a marvelous experiences and and seen the Miracles of God and the word of the Lord come to pass that had already brought Manna down from heaven great things had happened already in for them and it was a tremendous but but I want you to notice now as they come to Mount Sinai and there the voice of God Thunders out on the mountain and there Moses goes up into the cloud and the pillar of fire and and Moses experiences the wonderment of seeing the theophany of God and God taken with his finger and writing upon Stone and giving them his to their command giving them his Commandments and so he does all of this and the thunderings That Shook the mountains and and the the quaking of it all in the and realizing this is an awesome God we serve and yet now they they border they come from there 11-day Journey from Mount Sinai and come to Kadesh and they're right on the border and I want to say to you many of you today are sitting right on the border of your promise right on the border of your deliverance right on the border where that God is about to pour out the blessings of the land and you can have it as a believer God is about to do some greater Mighty wondrous things amen I believe there's a Rapture that is laying ahead I believe there's a change in my body laying ahead amen I believe that God is about to do the phenomena like you've never seen before he is showing his power and he is on showing his display of his omnipotence now as we look at this I just want you to think of this because it would now be 40 years later they would again come to the point where that again's thighs would be sent out and just think as I mentioned my last sermon you know that many many of those young men that were now um 10 years old young children 10 years old would be 50 before they could go in and they man they missed out 40 Years of planting and 40 Years of building and 40 years all because of unbelief all because of refusal to enter into the promised land that lay right before them now take this represents that border and where everyone comes to the promised land and looks into the promises of God and discovered what is theirs Moses in our 12. I think it was a little bit political maybe you know as they disgusted of sending out someone maybe so they they get the favorite from each tribe and and making sure every tribe was represented and 10 out of 12 Spies gave an evil report think about that now these were all supposed to be message believers they were also supposed to be you know following the prophet but here out of them as their sin into the line 10 out of the twelve bring an evil report of the Lamb that God gave do you hear me amen but but I want you to notice 40 years later and this is what I was going to bring you know that when Joshua sent out spies to spy out the lamb he only sent two amen he didn't sin 12. he said two because two believed and he said I'm not sinning about to unbelievers I'm not going to send a bunch of borderline believers who won't go all the way but I noticing somebody that will bring me a word of faith Mountain that we can't take the land so he sends out too and the Bible said they bring back a report and it's different from their others the report before these two bring the same report that Joshua had brought and said truly the Lord is delivered in our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us so here they bring they bring a report back and their report is listen we can take this amen that the inhabitants of the country are her faith because of us and the Lord truly has delivered Hallelujah delivered them into our hands I'll tell you what friends I don't care what kind of devil is standing on your promise care how big a devil how big a demon or how big a Giants or how many they are what kind of depression what kind of unbelief what kind of suicide Spirit what kind of schizophrenia no matter what it is I'll tell you there is nothing amen there is nothing that our God can't do there is nothing that can withstand His holy name at the name of Jesus and [Applause] he is Lord Hallelujah he's a ruler overall now you know these two these two had a Joshua and Caleb attitude they saw they could see Jericho's walls coming down amen they they heard how the enemy really viewed them you know the team imagine how the enemy viewed them you see in their imagination in their as they intellectualize the situation are you with me that's a reason the situation they said we are as in their sight as grasshoppers we're just bugs that could squish under their feet these are giants these are Mighty Men these are powerful men and we can't take it but anybody I want you to hear that they came back with a report and their report was totally different from that it was the same at Matt's report of Joshua and Caleb's and said we're more than able to take it and the report was here's how the enemy sees you Joshua 2 and 9 and and Rehab seven to the men I know the Lord has given you the land and your Terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for We Have Heard we have our listened Devils have heard that we got young people living overcome alive [Applause] the darkness of this hour [Applause] oh yeah hell has already heard let me tell you Church you are shaking the gates of hell you are shaking the gates of hell [Music] but we also got Brethren Among Us who are too afraid to take it who want to bring a word to try to throw a stone or quote to try to tell us days of Miracles are passed or this is just nonsense that shadow the king among them there's no King to shout about I'm telling you right now friends I meant I don't want to be identified with them spies I want to be identified with a Joshua and a Caleb I want to have the same Spirit they had and say we are far the label Hallelujah oh when we got demons that are stripping our weapons and girls and women grow women with dresses up above their knees because of a demonic anointing that is trying to destroy them you don't think I'm going to say we're more than able to take that we're more than able to see our Holy Ghost come down upon a life and keep people how to dress right and walk right and talk right come on we're more than able you get the Holy Ghost on the inside of you I'm going to tell you you can take that land [Applause] you can have Holiness you can have Purity you can have Choice come on hey man you can have everything that the word of God promised you don't have to stand at the borderline say well I can't do it I can't live right it's all right for our boys to wear shorts I just it's just William Brown's opinion I'll tell you what borderline believer you better come on in you better get another Spirit on you you're a Cadence marnia this is your moment amen if I was you if I had that attitude I'd repent right now I turn from that wickedness amen so you know she she said we have heard how the Lord dried up the Waters of the Red Sea oh yeah when you come out of Egypt and what you did to the key to Kings of amorites that were on the other side of Jordan Zion and all God whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our heart didn't know listen these Devils were already running back they were already afraid come on you know listen listen what would happen in brother Brandon's meeting he would go to expose the cancer somebody help me preach and what would happen another one would reach out and say help me this one was screaming help me to the other help me come reinforce this I believe because he knew the moment that people started believing something was going to happen Hallelujah if I could give you to believe it this morning you can have the Deliverance that you are asking for in your life as soon as we hurt these Saints our heart did melt neither did that remain any more courage in any man because of you because of you devils are trembling because people are starting to believe things are starting to happen amen for the Lord your God oh I love this he he is God in heaven above and the Earth beneath he had went away to heaven and forgot us all but he's right here in the earth he's right there in your life he's right there in your Earth he's right here in the evening like Tabernacle to be your God to show you show himself God on your behalf so now let's just review just a moment let's just review how did this happened let's go to numbers 13 23 and let's just look at them bringing the evidence of the Lamb numbers 13 23. and they hear they go and spy out the land now they spend 40 days and they come to the brook of escrow and cut down them a branch with one cluster of grapes and they too bear it to upon the staff Brother The Grapes were so big listen the fruit of the land was so good amen it was so have you ever seen grapes that big I've seen some great clusters about like that but they're so big two men had to carry it on the side amount and they they bear between if between two upon his staff and they brought the pomegranates and the figs I want you to notice three fruits now as you look in numbers 13 27 they told them that we have come we came unto the line which thou sensed and what's now their first confession and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it now this is her first confession well I'd say what a land amen one cluster of great two men had to carry and then the wonderful fruits of pomegranates and figs three fruits three pulls amen we you know one of those polls was Divine Healing somebody help me preach I'm talking about the prophet of God in three phases of his ministry that's why the poll is as a face amen the first phase was Divine Healing and so you know here again in this first fruits of our promises there were huge prayer lines that sometimes would go for city blocks I remember where every Miracle conceivable was done there was nothing impossible blind eyes without eyeballs formed in the head let me remind you of jacco's testimony who went there as an Assembly of God preacher but he was an unbeliever in Divine Healing and he thought all of this was just hype and hysteria so he went out to see being that he was in San Antonio Texas in 1945 and watching brother Branham and this is his testimony and why I give the date because that's the date he gave and he said when I heard the man William Branham was Discerning people's hearts and praying for the sick and he said sometimes we we think we're the only one doing something for God so he belonged to the prestigings and denominations and thought if you're not in our group you ain't doing nothing and then in that show isn't that what happens around the message if you're not in our group it ain't happening or if it's happening there well we gotta make light of it or be jealous of it or enviously I say don't be envious of what God's doing amen be desirous of it to your church evolutionize your [Applause] let it do for you what it's done for us amen and he said when I heard about Discerning he said I thought it was for fortune telling so I went to find out for myself and he said I tried to get in the healing line but failed and and he was Discerning people and declaring them healed and one man came up had no eyeballs and he said he told him said now in three days it will be eyeballs form in your eyes well he said anybody could say that you know that man go get lost in the crowd and you could you forget about seeing him again nobody know whether that's true or not and he said um so as brother Brandon was praying he's praying for the people they let him out the door right where he was and brother Branham laid his hands over on his on his only messy um pass by and just stop in there for a moment and said you're not sick but your body is tired and he softly said to me you're doubting whether this is of God or not I want to tell you this is of God and we're both fighting the same devil amen come on I'm going to say to you listen I believe in everything the prophet of God said I believe in the things where he was correct in emotion and I believe the things that he was purporting emotion I believe every bit of it amen I believe in the mechanics I believe in every bit of the word and I believe in the Dynamics [Applause] and I just want to say Brother Where in the world you want to throw stones at us when we when we're fighting the same devil get on our team we've got to dying to defeat we gotta land amen so we're fighting the same devil go and continue in your Revival for you're also called to preach he said well man I are called to pray for the sick he said I left the mean I felt like I was walking on clouds but he's still a little bit skeptical so he said three after three days I thought I'd go find out about that man without eyeballs and when I saw him he still was still blind but eyeballs had formed and it was Now noon and that night after he fell asleep he woke around 7 PM must have been about the start of the meeting and he started running around to shouting praises to the Lord because he was now seeing that he said from then on I knew Reverend Brown was no ordinary preacher but was called for dispensational purposes now that was a testimony of a once critic and then become a fellow evangelist in the same field of Divine Healing and I just want to say brother we're fighting the same devil hey man Dave you know I'm not ashamed of any quote of the prophet of God I believe every one of them don't throw them at me they're for the enemy [Applause] don't go and stone me with stones try to take your little Revelation and stone it with me now let's use that against the devil [Applause] listen listen in I'm talking about clusters of grapes right now is somebody with me amen this is huge and what God showed us in this age because we are the Cadence by Nia too he brought evidence of the land are you with me I mean cluster of grapes so big that wooden couldn't pack it by himself my horribly Twisted bodies was straightened like the boy in South Africa who came in the prayer line with the dog like a lab like a dog with a chain about his neck he was mentally handicapped for one thing you don't think God heals mental handicap he showed over and over he does he still does he was mentally handicapped and some sort of disease it twisted his back and he walked like an animal on his hands and his feet it was a wretched conditioner you know a boy like this in in Africa like that where they were they're impoverished they would use them for begging and they were they would um bring them out and this hideous deformed condition and they brought this boy on the stage and he he started he started doing this little war dance because you know he he was before a crowd and and he you know he'd been trained to to do that and and you know so he was trying to do a war dance because that's what he would do when when begging would would get out you know and and on his hands and feet like an animal do a little war dancing people out of pity would give money and brother Branham stood there and trying to catch his spirit and trying to get him to settle down for a minute and break into a vision he said he's born in this condition and his parents outside an audience confirmed this was to be true and and then the vision began to show something he was thinking about this just really breaks my heart he was thinking about a younger brother who had been hurt riding a goat and it had crippled him and he's there now and he's thinking about if my brother could be healed and the vision picks that up and and tells of his desire and said what he's thinking about is his brother he's got a younger brother and he's in the meeting and he's crippled from riding on a goat and he fell off and he got hurt and I said I see him now said he's healed now he's looking at the vision and from the audience from the crowd came a boy running there with crutches over his head and screaming at the top of his voice totally healed amen and that little boy's seeing that you know his faith began to rise no doubt and and the Beast and goes on and he said I saw the boy like a blue shadow standing straight normal in his right mind and I said stand up Jesus Christ has made you whole he didn't know what I was talking about and then The Interpreter said and he didn't get it so brother Brandon walked over and grabbed his chain and took a hold of it around and said Jesus Christ makes you whole and pulled on his chains and his looks changed until you're starting dropping off his cheeks on his back belly and he's standing there looking around in his right mind every bone had snapped and went into place and here this crippled child deformed from birth comes home talking about The Grapes of this laugh I'm talking about the power of the Holy Ghost that can take a crippled boy I meant the foreign child and shield him in such a way as insane and make him normal that's what lays in this land oh it's a good land I say it's a good land amen here's the fruits of it God's so damn in this day the fruits of it Minds that were gone restored as horrible demons were cast out like the woman in Arkansas who brother Brandon was called to come down and pray while the prayer line was being formed and some of the bad cases was down in the basement and he walks down there and sees a woman there she's from a mental institution and her feet and her legs are up in the air and she's crawling around on her back both of their feet and legs stick up she's in a pair of shorts because you know that's about what they could dress her in there in the in the institution they had brought her brought her to the meeting and brother Brandon went down to pray for our new brothers the guy said no don't do that said her husband said listen she kicked out all the windows of the ambulance I'll tell you she'll kill you and he said no oh no he said I don't think so and he walked down there to take her by the hand and see if it was a germ disease and and when he took her by their hands she jumped so hard he said if I hadn't been able to lift my foot up and put it on her breasts and took away from it she'd have jerked me right down on her he said I ran back to get away from her and climbed up on the platform the little platform they're standing with her husband and she went crawling around on her back like and said she went over to a bench and she took and hit the bench with the back of her head and when she did she hit it so hard a big Splinter came out of it she picked that up and flung it at her husband and barely missed him and it hit the plaster on the wall and It Came Crashing Down broke the plaster on the wall it hit so hard and she said William Branham I have nothing you have nothing to do with me and he said well the husband said why she don't even know her name how did she know who you were she hadn't spoken three years how did she know that said that wasn't her that was a demon speaking through her amen oh let me let me just tell you let me just tell you these are not just Grapes of yesterday we are in this land and I can testify to you those grapes are still just as sweet Hallelujah I've seen demons cast out by the power of my Christ I know the power [Applause] what it can do and turn someone into the right mind yes sir I can stand here and we can give testimony after testimony of what we have seen God do because our God's real and these grapes are not fake they're not on a picture are you with me they're not just something that is plastic in an ornament they're not history thank you brother Branham said that was that devil talking through her using her voice and he said brother he said almighty God met me an angel of the Lord met me and gave me a gift to Divine heal and you believe that he said I do with all my heart he said well if I could get people to believe nothing would stand before me so well what must I do brother Brandon he said take her back to the insane institution and he said you know she and and she's going to come out of that in the name of Jesus Christ three days later you know she she never moved another time they took her peaceably back in another ambulance they put her back in the insane Ward about three days later she came to herself and a few months later was in the meetings where their little children her husband a restored mom oh this God is a restored this God is a restorer of marriages this God is a restorer of homes this God is a rescuer of children come on this God cares about your situation he's interested in you no matter how small or how great this God is interested in you oh yeah I put all of these in my notes yesterday as I was praying for this service this morning and then there's been study known and well you know I told you I was going to preach on this two weeks ago but you know cancers are the worst kind s of the worst kind we're healed brother Branham talks about Florence Nightingale I'm just talking about The Grapes of this land that's what I'm talking about I mean you know that they're huge they're they're clusters and and they're so big you know God was showing us the abundance the greatness of his power so that you can believe in anything for anything well you know Florence Nightingale had got down to 60 something pounds Skin and Bones and and was in a dying condition with tuberculosis and they flew her there to England and she just said from South Africa and just sit you know let's pray that I can die I can't die and brother Brandon said I couldn't pray that way she'd come all that way I couldn't pray that she would die so he he said we got down and started praying and a dove flew in the window and began to cool and he said I stood up and looked at that and I said I started to say did you see that and he just came out of my mouth you're you're healed you're going to be well and and you know and here this woman would come back and and and show him a picture months and months later there of Hertz 160 something pounds you know in full bloom health amen every kind of thing you see all great clusters may not be so big but this shows us what the land is able to produce Amen in this cluster in his clusters is a gift of faith in its clusters is the gift of healing Gifts of healing workings of Miracles these grapes wouldn't squeeze out would make the wine of stimulation as the word ripened and was revealed and would stimulate the believer to believe forever promise of God oh yeah but it's not just grapes they're pomegranates made of hundreds of tiny little fruits in one pomegranate perfectly detailed to every individual need somebody with me amen it could go back 40 years in your life amen I can tell your name and your address and repeat repeat the doctor's conversation or anything about your personal life well what did it do it it showed us that our God is a personal God he knows where you live he knows what your address is he knows the burden of your heart and our God cares about you he is concerned about every detail of your life amen oh my it showed us how God is personal God and like a pomegranate it's just crammed with every bit of goodness maybe all discernment is not on the same scale but it shows us that God knows every detail of our life and can give it can give insight into our troubles at any time discernment never delivered anyone it just raised their fate to a level that they could believe and thus receive God's promise every person can I say it every person is to have discernment of spirits in order to know what is right from wrong we can discern both good and evil and we can be confident that God knows and is concerned about every facet of life discernment comes in all sizes and shapes discernments of spirits and word of wisdom and the word of knowledge it all Lays there and there is prophecy there's so many wonderful lays things that lays there you see it is a good land for Deuteronomy 8 and 7 describes it for the Lord thy God bringeth thee unto a good land a land the Brooks of water of Fountains of depths that spring up out of valleys and Hills a lamb of weed and barley and Vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive oil and honey oh you see they're not just three things it's full of all kinds of goodness a lamb when you or you will eat bread without scarceness thou shall not lack anything in a land whose stones are iron and out of Hills our made us dig brass out of there will come the tools that you will need to use in that line is there but you know what it takes Faith to see it unbelief will never see the goodness of the land unbelief will point to the negative of them kids shouted but they didn't get nothing well I tell you someone did shout and they did get something in fact the reason they shouted was because they got something [Applause] oh yeah there are a few people that are shout to get it and you'll never shout enough to get it it comes to repentance turning from your sins and being sincere before God that's the way it comes the shout won't bring it down you can shout and scream all you want to it won't do one bit of good but I tell you what you cannot get in touch with deity and not have some kind of emotion happen [Applause] amen but it takes Faith to see it unbelievable point to the negative today's Miracles being passed to the promise of God being for yesterday faith says though is now unbelief says it's too late those days are passed or it's just not for me well then that means the Wilderness and death is for you now so brother Branham says about faith he said there's a little Door of Faith he's preaching doors in the door and he said there's a little door there's faith and said oh I'll give it a try Faith doesn't try oh blessed be his name Faith knows where he's standing Faith got big muscles and a hairy chest what and when he raises up with his big muscles everything contrary sits down he lets out a scream and it sounds like a panther screaming and every Jack Rabbit takes to his den faith is the boss [Applause] Hallelujah faith is the boss and all things are possible to them that believe all things well you said well I might ask God too much brother Branham you can't ask him enough he loves to do that for you and then he brings out the little fish about a half inch long in the middle of the Atlantic saying I better drink sparingly because you know I I might drink all this water up and then this ocean will go dry because I'll run out one day what nonsense and he said it would be more nonsense to think that you can exhaust the father's Good Will to do things for you Hallelujah you've come through the inexhaustible Fountain you come to the place of untapped resources you come to the place where the blessings of God never stop Hallelujah with a form of rain and the latter rain are poured out together and bring forth the highness of wheat [Applause] and oil and wine oh yeah could you imagine a little mouse about so long under the great Gardeners of Egypt saying now just a minute now there's there's billions 450 billions of tons of this Garner of grain in here but I better just allowance one one kind of day because I might run out before springtime and he said that's the way some Christians think God is trying to allow allowance herself just join in the church let me tell you this message is more about than just sitting on another pew let's just change it from the Catholic or the Methodist or the Baptist or whatever and come in here and sitting on the Pew it ain't about trading cues amen it ain't about joining the church and saying this is the best I can do you see if and and of course if that if you do the best you can do I'll tell you what you'll believe every promise God made if you'll do the best you can do amen you can never ask him too much he loves to give it ask abundantly that your Joys may be full just ask for great things and believe for great things but he said the reason you can't do it now here's them at their kadash the reason you can't do it you say now Jesus you saved me don't you let me go to hell but don't fool around maybe Dr P H Calhoun is right it might be that the days of Miracles are passed it might be it is for you you just make that up it is if you believe that it is and I want you to say days of Miracles has passed for some healing is over for some shouting is over for some amen Holy Ghost dancing is over for some but it ain't for you Hallelujah not sir you were at this key this morning moment and there's Jocelyn calebs that are here that's it we can take the land we can't enjoy all the blessings of God Hallelujah Ma he said a man came to me some time ago said Miss some random I don't care what you do or say I don't believe in miracles I said it wasn't for you unbelievers it was for those that believed that's the only question Jesus said he that believeth all things are possible it's for those who will believe and place their unadulterated faith in the finished works of Christ God's there and obligated to do it and then there were figs there were pomegranates and there were grapes and there were figs in Second Kings 20 and verse 5 it tells about Hezekiah a man who had got a word from God you're gonna die set your house in order but Prayer Changes Things and he set his face against the wall and began to pray and said God you know I've served you with a perfect heart give me some more years and he turned there and that prayer sent the prophet of God back to him that says I have heard thy prayers I have seen thy tears behold I will kill thee and I want to tell you he's saying that to somebody today I have heard that prayer and I've seen your tears but I will heal thee you know why because he's the same yesterday today and forever and if I can get you to look in This Promise of the word in your case martinia moment and you can say that can be my promise that could be for me is my inheritance I'm gonna take that it can be for you too and I want you to know this he said I'll add 15 years to thy days and I'll deliver thee and this city out the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my David's servant's sake and Isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took it and laid on the boil it must have been a cancer I don't care what your Cancer's name is there's a lot of different cancer there's a lot of different types of cancer there's cancers of gossip cancers of unbelief cancers are you with me of unforgiveness there's all kinds of cancers in your family every kind of situation but I'll tell you take a lump of figs take the word of God take this third-pull message and they took it and laid it on the boil and he recovered I tell you I challenge you to take any promise of the word of God and lay it on your problem and once a thing disappear foreign you see in the third poll there are Mysteries that God revealed seven Thunders utter their voices opening up the Plan of Redemption and giving us the whole land of the Bible every promise in the book you say brother Tim I'll tell you what you know you're you're preaching we can have the gifts of the Spirit we can have Divine Healing we can have altar calls we can have we can have prayer lines we can have Deliverance you know brother tell me you know aren't you aren't you going backwards no I'm going forward in the land I'm not going back anywhere I'm going into the promised land of the word of God that's what lays in the land but if you stand there in your Kadesh Barney a moment and you say but we can't take it that was only for brother Branham or you know only the azusa's three people have something to jump and Shout about are you with me I don't I know I'll be there only the Methodist can Shout if that's when you if you stand there and your key to Smart knee a moment and you say we can't take it you'll go into the land of wondering you'll wind up in the tribulation you see I don't just believe in gifts of the Spirit and Divine Healing and miracles and speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues and all of those I believe Seven Seals have been opened the mysteries of God's been revealed seven Thunders uttered their voices I believe in every mystery of the Bible I believe I believe it's a whole gospel I believe in a Full Gospel but it happens to be all them other things I just mentioned are in there too it's more than just theology it's more than just a new revelation it is a revelation that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today I believe in the whole land I don't believe in just conquering Jericho and and seeing that sealed walls come down and the seals are open and we stand there at Jericho and then you build you build a wall around Jericho up again and you encamp there because cursed is he that builds this wall again there is to be no denominational movements in this message [Applause] [Music] the homeland of the Bible in the land the third pull there's a power of the spoken word it's the word isn't it so that's the power of the spoken word there's the power of binding and loosened The Binding of the serpent death and anything beneath him that's what we got to look forward to listen friends I'm not I'm not just happy just having a Divine Healing movement I'm not just happy having a little prayer line amen I want to listen to the prophet of God saw in the third pole Vision as they formed that prayer line that we're going through and they were changed come on changed I'm looking for the change for a little Divine Healing I'm looking for a massive Divine Healing where gray hair will come back the right color amen reflection is all wrinkled becomes tight again we're bodies that are being pulled down into the ground listen six thousand years ago man went from mortal or Immortal into mortality but we're here at the other side of redemption that's what it was then but that's not what it is now amen we are models going into the Immortals for the Bible said we will not all sleep but we shall all be saved in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hello somebody's going to bind the serpent death and I'm telling you this message people are at that key that's my that's my dear moment will they get a revealing of the Holy Ghost which is the dynamic or will they reject it and call it fanaticism and sit back and criticize because somebody shouted or danced so well brother Tim there was some wildfire yeah there always is Fire gets out but brother Brandon said I'd rather have Wildfire than no fire foreign I would rather err on this side than that side I'd rather be a fanatic than a formula now I don't want Wildfire I'll be the first to tell you I don't want fanaticism I want the real and the genuine but just because as you wind up and the Devil comes around and impersonates sometimes amen don't mean that I'm going to be a wet blanket and start putting the fire out [Applause] are you with me I'm not going to do it we're going to have fire in this church we're going to have to build a fire movement we're going to have the Holy Ghost having this way yeah yeah there will be people whose lives are changing people who are healed delivered they will be snot on these altars Hallelujah there might be people rejoicing dancing in the spirit like Mary of dads Hallelujah cause I'm not going back into the wilderness we're going to have every promise of God this is Ireland this is the land of our fathers these spies Joshua and Caleb the two ties that went into Jericho they could say This Is Our Land Abraham walked this land Isaac walked this land Jacob walked this land Joseph lived in this land Joseph said bring my bones back to this land I want to be buried in this land because there's going to be a resurrection in this land so bring my bones back there because there ain't gonna be a resurrection down in Egypt so they can say this is my father's land Abraham walked over it he said I'll show you this the length and the height the breath to walk over it I can't give it to you now because iniquity of the amorites is not done but after seven churches somebody help me preach now after seven prayer churches I'm going to bring I'm gonna bring you to the land and you're gonna have your chance at kadash yeah so you see I want to say when I'm looking at this land that you can't tell me or that you tell me that I can't have that we can't possess I want to tell you this is my father's land this is the Lamb of Pop this is the land of Peter this is the land of James and John Hallelujah this is the land of Miracles glory to God this is a land of Divine Healing this is the land of raptured in vain in all days in this land [Applause] let me tell you in this land Jesus walked and when he walked where he walked every devil was subject to him Hallelujah amen this is my father's land and I have come to take what is mine Hallelujah it all belong to the Philistines it don't belong to the amorites amen it don't belong to any of them it belongs to me it's my land This Is My Land foreign there's a power the spoken word there is the opening the word the revealing of the Mysteries it all came from a prophet nobody can take his place none of us are trying don't get don't envious like they like like Joshua 1 to Moses because 70 begin to prophesy in the congregation because he'd been Anointed with the same Spirit of Moses and Joshua says went screaming stop him stop him he said to you envy for my sake I would have got all of his people were Prophets amen so you see that that in here though about victories there is a warning that goes with fig trees the Fig Tree must produce fruits a gospel without power is to be cursed and a religion without emotion is dead now if you want religion without motion stay in the wilderness amen if you want to gospel without powers stay out there in the wilderness but in this land there's every promise of God John 15 2 ever branches in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away this is what he says every branch that Beth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit well I'll tell you I'm either in the position of being banished or purged and I just say God Purge me but whatever he's looking for fruit if he doesn't find fruit he's gonna he's gonna take that away do you know what it means to be taken away to be cut off you're bound to bound together in bones for the burning for the tribulation for the fiery Trials of the tribulation now Jesus found a victory in his day in it isn't it a wonderment how that Jesus did this and remember these things were for examples the Bible said and Jesus found a victory and he expected it to be bringing forth fruit out of season now you know people think you need a certain season well this is not the day of Pentecost brother Tim well maybe not we certainly don't have to carry in the city of Jerusalem but I tell you we must be imdued with powerful and high oh it's not the repeated return right we don't have to go and do what they did we are not waiting for the Holy Ghost to came they they come because Christ had ascended and he said as long as I'm with you the Holy Ghost cannot come but when I sinned I'm going to send back the promise of My Father which will be the Holy Ghost and he said you wait in the city of Jerusalem until I do a few things there in glory and I'm going to send it back so they waited hmm you know again we think it needs a certain season well you know this is just out of season for fruit this is that you know it was the season for miracles and signs and wonders in the 40s and the Vintage but that's not our season I saw some of you who had the sharp look on your face but I've had preachers say that we are not in that season I don't really care Jesus looks at the big tree and is not seasoned and he expects fruit and he says he said if you don't bear fruit you're going to be cursed I I don't care about your seasons amen I want you to know if you want to go to Seasons I'm going to say it's your season to be blessed [Applause] it's your season for a rapture hallelujah what do you think will Rapture even means it means ecstasy uncontrollable estracy shout in rapturing you're claiming to be an erupture and you don't have any shout in your church amen you say well we got Rapture and Faith by the team will show it amen it's like if you're happy let your faith notify your face amen if you're really in the mood of God bless there be signs and wonders let there be healing and miracles let the power of God move into salvation Hallelujah what do you think we're standing many people are standing right there Kadesh [Music] and they're looking over and said we can't take it we can't take it because of you young people get a little bit too excited so we don't want that well I do I'd rather them be excited about Jesus then be dancing and shouting in a ball game come on I'd rather them dance and Shout in church than to be out in a honky tonk amen I'm happy to see our young people enthused about God Amen I always say every one of you from the front to the back would get enthused about Jesus Christ he ought to be the joy of your life he ought to be the sensible theme of everything we do as safe he ought to be the praise of our hearts that you understand that the borderline and criticize and say we can't take it I'm going to say we are more than able to take it Hallelujah it is Our Land well brother Tim I know you you're just a Pentecostal let me just tell you something first of all I'm not I'm not I never was birthed to under Azusa Street I never was I got I got filled with the Holy Ghost in this message by the way I spoke in tongues in this message that's not the evidence but I still did it it is one evidence the Holy Ghost does speak with tongues it's like hair on your head everything that has Harry in a human everything speaks in tongues ain't filled with the Holy Ghost [Applause] but I I figure if you are human you're gonna have hair unless you've got some kind of malady and God can heal that too because we've seen it happen alopecia accursive autoimmune immune disease on a young girl in our church and God restored her glory the thing was cursed in the name of Jesus Christ and hair began to grow Hallelujah you say well brother Tim I think you're Pentecostal where you got this from Penn now listen I learned how to preach from listening to the prophet I never went to Bible School I've never learned how to preach in some Pentecostal church I church I left that the United Pentecostal church when I was six years old my my parents did I had nothing to do with it I followed them out I was born in there and I followed them out they wanted to come out because they didn't want to they wanted a church independent denomination they began to hear about brother Branham in the message and we started we got the first church age book in 1965. we begin to we begin to realize God sent a prophet and then God then God took him home and in that era of time in 1970 and a 15 year old boy preacher boy I started preaching this message and I had never preached Azusa Street never well so you know but however I do want to say we are Pentecostal when brother Brandon preached here Leo to see in church and as a messenger of that church and preaching his message to that church age and he preached his time he said I want to be Pentecostal from the top of my head to the soul of my feet now I'm not denomination but I mean the real genuine hallelujah amen now you you know again brother Branham talks about it because he had to fight with the same thing his whole Ministry he had to defend dancing in the spirit he had to defend shouting he had to defend Divine Healing he had to defend workings of Miracles against a Church of Christ an antichrist spirit who raised up and said now because we have the complete Canon of the Bible then nothing can ever happen again we have the complete and total word of God so there cannot be a prophecy that would be an addition to the Bible there cannot be a healing because that would be an addition to the Bible there cannot be Miracles because that would be an addition to the Bible and they formed their cult and I call them Antichrist because Christ means the anointing and they're against the anointing anti-anointing and that Spirit has come right in the message of the hour and I think you know just like YouTube God is calling Ministries Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors I mean it's a shame to have to defend that it's ridiculous I mean now duh you ought to know God's calling ministers die we ought to know that but no you know they want to come along and use a few little isolated quotes there to try to shut down the ministry and the same thing happens with that Antichrist Spirit they're going to shut down shouting shut down same one that wants to shut down preaching and I have something to say I have something to say about some of these preachers they will criticize people in a prayer line that will be going to the prayer line and shouting and rejoicing and showing emotion and dancing to the spirit but they'll get up in the Pulpit themselves and they'll run back and forth on the platform and scream and holler and they call that anointing and they say oh but these are only blessings and it's without power I'll tell you what we come down to the point where there's just a few inspired preachers amen while the people just sit there and try to absorb it this is nicolaitanism I say it again it's Nicholas in his and his conquer the laity is to keep the holy ghost from moving in the pew I tell you the Holy Ghost is in the in the pulpit and a man can shout and scream under the anointing of God let me tell you under that same anointing that people can get under there and stand and shout and scream and rejoice Hallelujah yet you want some nickel here in spirit attire shut it down I'll tell you it ain't gonna happen might happen in your church you can have that if you want to but here an evening like Tabernacle we're gonna have the power of God under salvation we're going to have to Leverage well Pentecost is over brother Tim that's ages passed and gone yazoo's the street is that's not where we're at we're in the bride age but Pentecost is not over let me read you the from the prophet of God where they were saying days of Miracles have passed and he was he was talking about 1965 in the Easter seal and he was talking about the gifts of the Spirit and and how that somebody on the radio was criticizing Divine Healing gifts of the Spirit the moving of the Holy Ghost and said the days of of the Apostles is over with and he said he said Paul is ordaining these gifts in the church 30 years later and said in Galatians 1 and 8 if an angel from heaven preaches to you any other gospel than this which is already received see already been preached let him let him be a curse I believe that Pentecost began without an ending I believe it is to Every Creature all times all places that Pentecost should always remain the Pentecost of blessing should be upon the people well I better tell them what you have there is is not power it's blessings okay but the Pentecostal blessing is always be on the people what's wrong with the blessings [Applause] and I bet you ain't got no power either anointing without power is satanic listen oh yeah oh but brother Brandon said the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for today this is for the bride we got something different you don't think I know that quote oh yeah I know it I believe it you know you don't don't use something like that to throw a stone at me that's for the enemy I believe that well the the but you see you see the word that was fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for today we do not go to the city of Jerusalem to be empowered well if I'm on high but you must be empowered but you don't have to wait what was it what was it how long did they wait 11 days what was it 10 days whatever it was they waited they had to wait after the Ascension for the Holy Ghost to come and you know ever since then nobody has to wait we're not able now let me explain that we are not waiting for the spirit to come God is waiting on you to repent to submit yourself amen there's still a waiting there are people that have to tarry some people wait for 10 years because it won't die out to Old Man's self but not because the Holy Ghost ain't here the Holy Ghost is there the first day he'll be for you the moment you repent but God ain't going to come and seal your car and all kinds of meanness and everything else in it God ain't going to come and see I'm talking about the railway car the railway car brother random side of Houston I work for the railway and he said no you know there they would pack that car and and everything had to be put in just right then an inspector had to come along and and inspect what was in there and that it was right he said because he would have to not Shake loose on the journey because they would be responsible for the damage so you know if your temper is out of place if your lust is out of place you know lust is desires is just for the wrong things you get that desire toward Christ it's okay come on to have a great desire and love for your wife that's wonderful but for somebody else's wife that's sin are you with me so all of that has got to be put into place Before He'll seal the car and he comes there and he checks and he sees in your repentance and he visits you at the altar and sees in your repentance that there's still something loose in your life that you hadn't surrendered you know what's going to happen you're going to wait you're going to wait till that gets put in order because it's going to be sealed to the day of redemption it's going to be sealed to the rapture are you with me so these things have got to be put in order in your life and surrender to God you've got to give up the desires of the world you got to surrender amen and the more you surrender the more he takes control now so you see again again that the season of waiting is over listen brother Bradham tells us in Gabriel's instruction to Daniel God never blesses Israel till she gets to her Homeland God will never bless you a Methodist of baptism Presbyterian a Catholic Pilgrim holding his Nazarene Church of Christ or a Pentecostal organization he will never bless you that way come back to the Homeland to the beginning back to the Pentecostal experience like it happened on the day of Pentecost when the power of the Living God changed those thousands of people and set their heart aflame with the fire god that showed genuine not impersonated signs don't just stand there at the border and look don't don't don't just walk over there I've got just a few more minutes earn peace Giant on that I'll never do that I I could never be that way no you know Jesus passed by victory and he was disappointed there was no fix and he looked at it and said no man eateth from thee from henceforth now I'm going to tell you so it ain't a certain season we're waiting on you know if it is we've arrived this is Harvest Time this harvest season this is bright time I mean you want to go down and name it it's Eagle time Eagle hour all of these things that he mentioned wheat wheat age talking age so whatever it's all in season the word is always in season and and the bride tree is one he said like in restoration of Bright Tree now when that's tree that Jesus that God planted it was to Bear nine different kinds of fruit nine different kinds which means nine spiritual gifts nine fruits of the spirit to go with nine spiritual gifts that was God's tree he planted it on the day of Pentecost and this tree is planted by the river where the Springs nine different Springs reading into him rivers of water one Spirit one water one Spirit there are Gifts of healing Same Spirit Gifts of Prophecy Same Spirit All The Same Spirit but many gifts one Giver we're still in the message aren't we all right now and I'll tell you what if Jesus if Jesus comes to this church I'm talking about the Church of this last day and he doesn't find faith he's going to be like he was with that fig tree disappointed in fact of the matter is to keep that from happening and he said I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet to turn your hearts back to the Pentecostal faith of the fathers lest I have to just Smite it all with a curse because if I don't send Elijah to bring a restoration I'll have to curse the whole thing now he actually does this at kadash he says he says to Moses I'm going to curse the whole bunch of them to every one of them will die and I'll just start over with you and Moses begins to stand in the breach and said don't do it God because the the Egyptians know you had the power to bring them out but then they'll say you didn't have the power to take him in but I'm going to tell you this God that has the power to bring you out is the same God that has the power to take you in Hallelujah amen amen so when he comes his church and doesn't Find Faith he would be disappointed but I want to say he will find faith amen he'll break every Power of hell to get Faith in the hearts of his people a people who come to their Cadence Barney of a Rapture and say yes I can have a refilling of the Holy Ghost which is the Dynamics of this church [Music] yeah I can see it reason I hear a rumble in the Firebox you know it's like brother Bradham talks about a train you know said you got to get it up you know where you're aware there's a fire that is burning ah brother Tim brother Tim you know I tell you what you know it's only just raising it enough but people are shouting dance and run the aisle I'll tell you what throw away your old wet blanket and throw on some more wood on the fire Hallelujah let the fire blaze a little higher until the train goes down the track in Full Throttle climbing every Hill through every Valley until we fall in the arms of God amen well brother Tim they just they just blowing it out the whistle well you can't do that without Steam and you can't make Steam Without fire [Applause] so if it's blowing out the whistle it shows us some fire in the Box amen all we got to

with the Holy Ghost and old people who are revived with the fire of God Hallelujah [Applause] praise the Lord amen now don't give me no nerve pills I ain't nervous I preached this way since I was a boy and I'm still preaching the same gospel today this is not something new for evening like Tabernacle then this is not new for the message amen this is this may be news for some of these churches that have sat down and died but this ain't new this is the same fire that made brother Bradham jump on the pulpit when he's preaching that made him run up and down the aisles amen and he said it comes to and he finds himself with with his with you know pulling up his pants there and he says I was speaking in other tongues and he said and then came the interpretation that said he's a rock in a weary land and a shelter in the time of storm and I want to tell you right now he's still The Rock in a weary lab he's our shelter no matter how many Pebbles and trials it comes he is our shelter and that's what the Rapture is we are saved from his Pavilion hallelujah hallelujah Florida well brother Kim today you're acting like a Holy Roller I'll tell you little bears but very little preachers can preach what brother random preach why we are a Holy Roller [Applause] that ought to be the title of a lot of these message preachers right now is why I am a Holy Roller why the people are embarrassed because

tell you what many are you standing here or here today sitting here or at your Cadence Barney a moment you can sit and say well am I going to just be a spectator or am I going to enter in you can get

our music we want Hallelujah in the dance amen We Want To Praise Him with this altering in the dance We Want To Praise Him and We Want To Praise His mighty name and say praise he the Lord foreign if you can Mark 11 20. and in the morning after Jesus had cursed this fig tree they passed by you see God's expecting fruits and they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remember and said in him Master the Fig Tree which cursed in the way thou cursed in the way is that is withered away and Jesus answered said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith so you see at kadish barnia and going into the lamb we are challenged to believe for the impossible we're people of the rapture we're a people of of you know who believes that Divine Healing is the earnest of our new body because it's it's the down payment until the the promise a purchase Redemption comes now so now in this land of the third pool where there's figs and
