grateful we are lord lord for Lord the promise Lord that where two or three are gathered you're there in the midst of them Lord knowing that this morning you are here Lord to meet us Lord and we're expecting that Lord we've come with great expectation today Lord just knowing Lord that you you're God and you change not that your promises Lord are yay and they amen Lord and we can stand here today in confidence father knowing that the anchor holds Lord we look to your word today and just ask that you'll open it to our hearts Lord Lord that you'll just anoint my lips and anoint the ears of the hearer Lord that the word can have its effect today Lord we're inviting you right now to take complete control we're inviting you Lord to move how you see fit we're inviting you Lord freedom in this place to move Lord we just Commit This service into your hands right now and just pray Lord for every need Lord I just pray for Lord God right now Lord the the winers family the Coro family Lord those that have lost a mother and a grandmother Lord just just Comfort them today I pray father Lord wrap your loving arms around them Lord Lord be with our pastor and brother Timothy Lord as they away traveling Lord and just use them in a mighty way we pray we commit ourselves to you now in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this morning and it good to be in the house of God together man if you have your Bibles and you'd turn with me this morning to Psalm 62 and5 Psalm 62 and5 we're going to read a few verses there and then also Psalm 78 and 40 amen amen God's good to us isn't he amen amen it says here in Psalm 62 and5 my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my Deliverance I shall not be moved and God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God Amen and we're also going to look in chapter 78: 40 here it says how of did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yay they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel amen I pray the Lord will add His blessings to the word as we have our seats this morning amen you know expectations looking there at the word they limited limited the Holy One of Israel and they limited him in their expectations of what he would do for them expectations are are a very powerful thing whether it be in our in our natural life or or or whether it be in our spiritual life because your own expectations of yourself and what is possible for yourself is actually what limits you the most I believe it was Henry Ford who said whether you believe you can or whether you believe you can't you are correct so it's it's the expectation that you set for yourself the same thing applies in the spiritual brother Bram says but expectancy that's a great thing to expect something you usually get what you expect some people come to the meeting and say well I I didn't expect to get anything out of it well they won't but those who expect to get something God will give them their expectations if they're doing it reverently and in the fear of God Amen so so our expectations are so important because our lives will only manifest to the level of our expectations you'll never go beyond your own expectations and so I I want to speak to that today you see the title there the manifestation of expectation the manifestation of expectation and and and we live in a very as you know a very cynical World a very negative world a world that teaches us to expect the worst that it's always going to go bad a world of Doubt or of fear and and and of unbelief and and we have to keep our guard up at all times because if we aren't careful the attitude of the world will begin to erode our own attitude the attitude of the world will begin eroding our right mental attitude it'll begin to erode the proper expectations and they begin to become eroded away and the and the stress of this world the the evil of this world the negativity of this world begins to wear on us and if you walk through the world very often and you live in it and you work in it sometimes you just feel heavy you just feel like it's wearing on you and sometimes your faith feels weaker than others why is that it's the world that's eroding at your right mental attitude it it's eroding at at your expectations and so you get to the point to where you stop expecting good things and so what happens is you stop seeing good things you stop expecting good and so you stop receiving good and and we stop looking for blessings so we stop getting blessings because you get what it is that you expect and soon we begin to expect the negative I've been very guilty of this myself many times I I'll hear my kids say something like this and I and I'll realize they got that from me because I I I've said things like well that figures of of course why wouldn't that have happened this always happens to me there's been times where things happen and I'll tell idy I'll say well welcome to my life I was saying that Friday when I was crawling around under my house after a sewer pipe busted well of course it did why wouldn't it happen and I had to fight to keep myself with a right mental attitude it wasn't the easiest thing to do but it it's something that we have to fight to keep the right frame of mind amen because the world around us or else the homes we were raised in or the way we're wired or the pressure that we're under has conditioned us to have a resp that certain negative response to trials and tribulations and and really just meaningless incidents of life that's really all it is and we get that response well of course as if that's actually what we were expecting to happen we were expecting it to go bad but listen Christians have bad days too Christians spill coffee on themselves on the way to work too Christian sewer pipes bust too or as brother Tim used to say Christians have flat tires too they're just natural things in life brother brandham would say persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian Life there's only one thing you can do about them commit them to God just put it in God's hand the situation you're in the trial you're in the circumstance today I'm just going to commit it to God and let him have it because worrying about it is not going to do one thing having a attitude about it is not going to fix one thing listen in case you didn't know but I'm sure you did life is not perfect that's right life is difficult and we have to work to keep our attitudes right we have to work to keep our expectations right because if we're going to fulfill all that we're called to fulfill if we're going to be the bride in the last day if we're the final voice to the final age if we're going to manifest the life of Jesus Christ and the ministry of Jesus Christ on the Earth again we're not going to do it with a negative attitude or with lowered and misplaced expectations our expectations should be up here every day of our life I'm a son or a daughter of God I'm gathering together today to worship the most high God I know he's going to move in my life today I'm blessed today I'm blessed in the city I'm blessed in the field I'm blessed when I'm going I'm blessed when I'm coming I am a Son of God I'm expecting great things today let's raise our expectations today we have heard the the quote that the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass well I A lot of times until recently I didn't realize even myself this isn't an isolated quote he said this exact line 59 times throughout the message 59 times he says the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass well what is the right mental attitude well I guess we could we could also say the right expectations because the right mental attitude is an attitude that matches the word of God am brother and what are the right expectations expectations that match the word of God he said it that settles it my symptoms are worse today he said it that settles it my son's gone further away today he said it that settles it so if you get it to match the word of God then the circumstances no longer matter the symptoms no longer matter the current condition doesn't matter he said it that finish it he said it's finished it's finished he said it's over it's over he said by Stripes I'm Healed I'm Healed let my attitude match the word let my expectation today match the word his promises are true his promises are real all the promises of God in him are yay and in him amen I am a child of God therefore the promises that are true are my promises they're for me today they're for my family today therefore these are my expectations I'm going to receive today what I have need of God's going to move for me today I'm going to be healed today I'm going to be blessed in this service today God's going to show up today that's our expectation and then let that expectation begin to manifest in our lives amen besides what do you get with a negative attitude what do you get when you expect nothing from God what do you get when you confess the negative when when you give voice to the pressures of and the frustrations and the circumstances of life you get nothing or you get worse uh and I realize this ain't one of those tried for 30 days and if you don't like it send it back for free but I do want to say just give God a try one time just one time give him your absolute everything not one foot in one foot out because if you're halfway in you're going to end up all the way out but for once in your life give him your everything give him a try one time pour everything you got into and say God I'm expecting you to meet me I'm expecting you to do the exceeding abundantly I'm expecting you to move in my family I'm giving you my everything Hallelujah we can't allow this world and and and the situations and the circumstances to change our expectations amen and and and and I will say this if we've allowed it through trial or tribulation or hardship because when we go through rough patches I'm real I understand we go through rough times and if we've allowed that to Tamper down our expectations or get us focused then today let's line those expectations back up with the word the Lord's wanting you to know today I'm going to do it I'm going to do it what you've been asking for I'm going to do it just bring your expectations back in line with the word of God today Hallelujah church I'm not just hoping so I'm not just wishing I'm not just trying to get by I'm not just trying for us to have a good church and a good life and some good Services I'm expecting the Messiah I'm expecting the coming of the Lord I'm expecting a body change I'm expecting a Rapture I don't care what the circumstances are it looks worse than ever people are falling away this one's off the word don't matter circumstances he said I will have a bride without spot a wrinkle he said there be a Rapture he said it I expect it that settles it let that manifest out of our lives he says you can take over the circumstance tonight if you wish to oh my but there in the circum say take it over how do I do that the word God said so you can take over and control every disease that's in this body God said so he did it and God will do it again when he gives a promise he'll stand by I want to Echo that have you seen him do it he'll do it again he's seen him do it he'll do it again he gave the promise he'll stand by it today that's the expectation of the believer because God's word is not subject to circumstance and God's word in you is not subject to circumstance it isn't subject to time nor is it subject to the times that we live in listen I still expect us I still expect the Church of the Living God to be another book of Acts I'm not expecting us to just settle down and and ride the little Lazy River all the way to a Rapture Day I don't care if there's Rapids I don't care if there's storms I don't care who turns their back we're going to be perform the works of Jesus Christ the acts of the Holy Spirit are going to be in the body I still expect it today microphone didn't expect that work I can't hang mine under there like brother Tim and Timothy and brother Joe I'll be walking all over it back here yeah that's right we still expect the super Supernatural here I'm still expecting the Supernatural and But as time goes on and the longer we stay here and the longer it's been since the message was given then the enemy is going to try to get you get us to settle into just having Church let's just say you're in the message just just accept the word just just have church just be a good group accept the status quo as it were and and and the longer that you're sick the more deals that he's going to offer you because the longer that that your situation persists the more the devil tries to sway your expectation you've been sick six months you've been sick four years so he begins to offer you deals and the worst the diagnosis is the more fear he tries to get you to accept the longer your children are away from God the harder he tries to get you to back off the promise the longer the age last the more he tries to get you to settle maybe it's just not going to happen in my day listen if I'm 80 and on my deathbed Jesus is coming if I'm dying with sickness Jesus Is My Healer if my children are way way way far out there Jesus is the savior amen listen if my kids are out there today and they've been out there 25 years I'm still looking down that dusty road today I still got the fatted calf ready I got the best robe hanging up waiting to put on my children why I am expecting I'm not just hoping I'm I'm expecting them Hallelujah the Bible says here in Luke 15:20 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him why he was looking for him he was expecting him that day despite the circumstances he was still under expectation brother Brown says it's only those who look for him shall see him it's it's only those who believe in him shall enjoy his blessings it's only those who believe in healing shall receive healing it's only those who believe in Salvation shall obtain it church I'm still expecting today as a matter of fact my expectations are higher than they've ever been we're walking in the vision you can look around and recognize you're literally walking in the vision the word is being fulfilled all around you the world is falling apart at the seems this isn't catching us off guard honored events have been made clear by prophecy my expectations are higher than ever I've always known he was coming but now I'm expecting it today I'm looking for it in the morning and if he's coming that soon then how soon are my promise is going to be fulfilled if he's coming that soon how soon are my children coming back how soon am I going to receive it I'm expecting it today it's moved so far beyond hope I'm expecting it today hold ask this morning expect more this morning look for more this morning look I'm not blind I look around I recognize circumstances are bad I know the situation is scary I know we can't do it alone but my expectations are not in myself my expectations are not in myself my expectations are in him my expectations are in his word when your expectations are in yourself or in your church or in your pastor that's when you you find disappointment but today it ain't about that I'm saying look to Jesus get your expectations on Jesus he has not failed he cannot fail he will not fail just get your eyes back on him and expecting to move this morning my expectation is he's going to keep his word hallelujah he wants you to know today that you can count on him to bring his promises to pass quit worrying this morning quit trying to do it all by yourself and listen God doesn't need you to do anything but believe God doesn't need you to do anything but believe and let him work on the situation God let Abraham let all his abilities die God let Sarah get to 90 years old why God was going to do it not Abraham and say he just needed them to believe that's God was going to do it it was going to be a body change it was going to be a visitation God told the children of Israel March around Jericho and on the seventh day do it seven times and then shout and then blow the trumpet and then shout and then the walls was going to fall down why such a seemingly silly plan because he wanted them to know this ain't your might this ain't your power you can't conquer Jericho but that's okay I'm the captain of the Lord's host and I'm going to tear those walls down you just make sure you shout when it's time to shout isn't it something there was a trap Soul on the inside of there that couldn't get out but when the shout came forth when the praise went forth when the atmosphere got right her walls fell down and she was able to walk out a free person don't tell me worship don't matter don't tell me praise don't matter when the trumpet goes forth when the word Goes Forth then you shout and watch the walls come down he was letting them know it's my power I'm the one going to do this God's going to let it get down to where we realize we can't do this and we say God I'm just going to trust you and he says finally I'm just going to trust you I'm just going to believe in you quit worrying today and expect God to move ishmail was a product of worry how's he GNA do it I just it just don't seem possible you know what maybe this is the way do do go go this way ishmail was the product of worry he was the product of humans trying to help God out the product of humans trying to figure it out am listen God is in control of this brother Aon what's this whatever you need this to be wherever you're at today God is in control of this he is in control of of your situation he he's control of the problem that looks too big for you Jericho's walls were too big for the children of Israel but God was in control of the situation just commit it to him today your trial your sickness your fear commit it all to God and expect God to move on your behalf even before we walk out the doors today God move on my behalf move on my behalf listen worry has never brought one single promise to pass not a single promise has ever been brought to pass by worry but the right attitude the right expectation will manifest God's word every single time so what should our expectations be how high should they be listen don't set your expectations uh lower than anything other than total Victory lower than anything other than than than than crossing over into the promised land to obtaining the promise that God has given you because you're going to be given opportunities to stop short you're going to be given opportunities to go back there's going to be captains rise up that say this is far enough on there's going to be captains rise up and say we don't need the supernatural right we don't need the moving of God you don't have to get the Holy Ghost the way they used to God don't do that there's going to be captains that offer you and say look you came out of Egypt so you're okay you're going to be given opportunities to stop short opportunities to make peace opportunities to make a deal look Pharaoh's offer to them was based on Circumstance the fact that they were slaves and he says you can take these people but you got to leave some people you can go so far in worship but you can't go all the way you can have these blessings but you got to give up your peace you can have this blessing but I'm not going to let you have your joy I'll let you believe the message but the new birth isn't like it used to be and if you don't have the right expectation then the offers don't look so bad if your expectation is here and the offer is there well then you've receed what you were wanting but if your expectation is here and somebody offers you this let me just put it to you and use car terms brother Joe if you're expecting to get 10,000 on a car you're selling somebody offers you 1,500 nope no no sir not today but if you're expecting 10,000 and somebody shows up and says how about 12 and you're sitting there saying God pour it out Lord I'm exped and he says because you're expected I'm going to give you more than you even wanted I'm going to overflow your cup I found a heart that's believing I found a heart that's expected I'm not going to Short change them I'm not going to give them some kind of a Pharaoh's offer I'm going to say I'm going take you all the way and not only am I going to take you all the way I'm going provide for you all the way I'mma open the Red Sea I'm going give you Mana I'mma give you handfuls on purpose I'm going to heal you when the serpent bites I'm going to pour it out because there was some am Rams down there that was praying God send your deliver God it's time for a deliver I say there's people they saying God it's time for a Rapture it's time for our body change It's Time Lord for us to see you come back the way you said you would he's not going to Sure [Music] changes Pharaoh's offer played off a circumstance because of circumstance they didn't have high expectations I mean going a little way is better than going nowh where you ain't went nowhere in 400 years this is better than what you've been getting you're a slave you've been a slave and I'm actually offering you a good deal here but that good deal that you're being offered today ain't going to get you to the promised land it ain't going to get you through the Red Sea God said he was going to take them to a land flowing with milk and honey God said they could be totally free God said I'm the deliver I don't need no stinking deal from Pharaoh I am that I am and I have come down for your situation don't settle today with the Devil the I am is in the building the I am's going to take us all the way the I am has returned in the pillar of fire he didn't bring us here to stop us short he didn't bring us here to let us die in the wilderness he brought us here to Rapture us he brought us here to take us to a place that he has prepared he brought us here so that we could go to the marriage supper of the L and Pharaoh says yep but you got to leave some behind and God says no you don't just eat the lamb we're all leaving here in the morning [Applause] Hallelujah God was wanting them to change their expectations he said I am that I am Hallelujah but they were so used to being beat they were so used to things not going their way that they were constantly battling that slave mentality never experiencing truly freedom and every time something went wrong they would forget the promise every time something went wrong they would forget they were chosen they would forget what God had already done like I said well of course there's a Red Sea of course you brought us this way Moses of course there's no food well of course there's serpents why wouldn't there be I knew there was going to be serpents I knew the water was going to be bitter when I saw it that's Bitter Water I knew it because all they had ever known was slavery maybe the devil's beat you for a long time and all you've known slavery but I'm telling you there's one that's come down this morning and he's saying you ain't got to have a SL mentality no more you ain't got to keep going on you ain't got to wear that slave belt you ain't got to take one more you can throw your ho down your rake down whatever it is he's got you working with you can throw it down this morning you don't ow the devil one more day one more minute one more second you owe him nothing you can walk away today totally free totally delivered and you can have your joy and your peace and your Victory you can have the Holy Ghost you can have it all this morning [Applause] Hallelujah they've been bound up so long that their expectations was the expectations of slaves and the circumstan of Years Gone by still dominated their expectation well Daddy had temper problems I guess I'm going to have temper problems lust issues just run in my family guess I'm going to have them circumstance dominated their thinking family cycles and past failures still haunted them and no matter how much he did for them they still doubted because they allowed themselves to be slaves to circumstance listen God is greater than your circumstance God is the god of circumstance this morning he broke those circumstance listen I just want to put it like this you're stuck in prison whether it's in your own mind whether it's one the devil's put you in whether it's sin whether it's fear whatever it is and when that prison door is locked up there ain't no getting out I get it's a tough place to be what I'm telling you is that one came down and that one had the key and that one has opened the door and today the prison door is wide open and all you've got to do is walk out all you've got to do is say I'm tired of prison food I'm tired of staying here I'm tired of not having my own life I'm tired of being told when and where and how go to sleep get up there there's a God offering me Freedom this morning there's a God saying there's a better life this morning there's a God saying yeah I know you're not good enough neither was I but he's saying today I was good enough I was accepted I'm the lamb I'm the sacrifice I was good enough and I'm looking at you through the lamb this morning and I'm saying you're free just walk out to Freedom expect Deliverance I failed and I failed and I failed quit being a slave to p circumstances he's saying you're not going to fail you're going to overcome you're going to make it you are delivered just walk out this morning hallelujah how often did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yeah they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel they doubted even though they saw him move and they limited him with their expectations listen they never expected to make it they never expected to make it look if I leave here going to sheveport or a vacation let's make it a big trip I'm going to Virginia and I get right down here past this church and have a flat tire I don't go I knew we weren't going to Virginia you brought me out here to die now but the very first thing they ran into it showed they never actually expected to make it oh you brought us out here to die was there no graves in Egypt what this just just die right here instead of God you brought down plagues God you turned the Nile of blood God you took the firstborn God you passed over the night you said you would would I know that you are going to make a way through this Red Sea I know you're going to provide don't forget what God has done for you in your life already quit focusing on the negative and the failures we've all got them but today I'm looking and saying God has been good to me God has blessed me God has kept me God has provided for me he's going to do it again today Hallelujah they never expected to be delivered they never expected to be healed brother Brown says you limit God by your unbelief that's it our thinking limits him our attitudes limit him our doubts limit him but brother Aaron my Situation's different I know and mine's different and there all all different well this sickness is worse you don't understand what I've done or for people holding grudges you don't understand what they've done to me you don't understand the hurts this church has caused me that person's gone too far that person's crossed the line God hates back up they provoked him in the wilderness and grieved him in their heart why they Limited they limited they limited God hates to be limited he hates for us to put him in a box and say this is how he moves and this is how a service has to go and this is how salvation has to come I don't care if they come in the back door in their pajamas God Saves how God wants to save I don't care how God heals God heals how God wants to heal he moves how God wants to move if he wants tongues he can have tongues if he wants shouting he can shouting he wants dancing he can have dancing if he wants me to cry I'll cry God moves how he wants to move don't limit God who are we to limit God that's right who are we to limit his Mercy that's who are we to limit his grace who are we to limit God's power he is unlimited he's only limited or by the doubts that we put on him and it doesn't really limit him it limits him in our life it limits how much God can do for us listen he's going to do it for somebody he's going to heal somebody he's going to deliver somebody he's going to Rapture somebody I say Lord I believe I'm expecting it to be me I want you to move for me I think it's going to happen today Lord Jesus he heals who he wants he saves who he wants that's right get your thinking and your reasoning out the way if God says he saves he saves God says he heals he heals if God says you can have it quit trying to explain to him why you're not good enough and why you're too bad and why you've gone too far God said you can have it then you can have [Applause] it I'll try to figure it all out Peter didn't try to figure it all out that night out on the boat he said bid me come Jesus said come and right that moment Peter launched into a speech about Archimedes principle and how it states that the upward force of an object in the fluid equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces and this upward force is what gives something the ability to float but you understand that humans can't walk on water because their weight is is too great to be supported by the surface tension of the water and that the water density is not a you laugh that sounds like some people that come up for prayer before you even get to pray for him like man you might as well go sit you f a sink no he said bid me come Jesus said Come Peter got out the boat today Jesus is saying come come and all I'm saying is get out your boat of Doubt get out your boat of unbel get out your boat of fear and expect to walk on the water today you're not going to sink you're not going to drown you're not going to fail oh and if you do begin to seink all you got to do say Jesus save me I perish and in that moment he will reach down and pull you up and you'll walk on water again listen it's been a while since some of you walked on water you've been sinking but today is a new day today we're going back to the boat the boat that Jesus Christ Capt us The Old Ship isign we're going to walk on water again get up get out your boat today hallelujah amen amen B me come he says come today there's salvation for you there's Mercy for you there's Grace for you there's healing for you just take him out his word it's time for our expectations to match the promise it's time for our expectations to match the promise but Israel limited God over over and over again and over time it became a part of who they were you watch a church limit the moving of God and over time it becomes a part of who they are they limited him and over time it became more about their Traditions than it did about God's power their Traditions didn't get them out of Egypt their Traditions didn't get them out of Babylon but it became more about about their Traditions than it did God's power it became more about their doctrines and their forms Church don't let that be us I am so thankful that the Mysteries are revealed I'm so thankful that we have correct doctrine that godhead is there and serpent say I'm so thankful for all that but if that becomes all you focus on and the sick sit sick and the lost sit lost and the bound sit undelivered then what good is your Doctrine doing you but it became about their traditions and their doctrines and their leaders and their teachers set the expectations low what God could do what God would do listen a lot of people don't go far enough because of the expectations that they're taught there's a lot of people would love to get out in deeper water but they're held by fear in a place and told that no no no no that water's fanaticism we that water we're supposed to be in this water you're supposed to live right here in the kitty pool but their expectations are taught to them over and over again and it's all they know it's not that they're not good people it's not they're not hungry people it's all they know it's all they've been taught that they don't expect more because the leaders and the teachers have set the standard so low hey I put it like this we set the standards and expectations too low in our homes hey I'm must going to say something from my own heart too many times our our prayers with our families are bedtime prayers how many times have our kids H us asking for great big things setting the standard and expectation really really high and I thought about it I was like yeah I've prayed with my kids for for years but how many times has it just been God watch over them tonight and God bless us and God thank you and those things are wonderful you should thank you watch over us put yourself but how many times have they heard you set the expectation at a level that only God could reach and then watch them come behind it and back it up so then they go forward with their own high expectations we like to place the traditions on on on the denominations and the churches but many of us carry the traditions of our family and it's hard to break traditions I realize do you know how hard it is to have a different view of a of a man of God or a Ministry if you're whole life you were raised being taught that he was wrong and in error and and off the word you know how hard it is for that man to then help you later in life based off of a family tradition based off what you talked about around the dinner table or do you know how hard it is to expect God to move for you in your situation if you were told that God don't move like that no more if you're told God don't heal what do you do when you get sick and the doctors say we can't help you how hard it is to get the New Birth when you were taught that you already had it because you accepted the message and what it is is it changes expectations and if our expectations aren't in the right place then we miss what's happening because we're not expecting it we're looking in the wrong places our expectations are low but traditions and and teachings look why is it so hard I I'll even say look we have the most wonderful congregation brother Joe but sometimes we got we got to be real why is it so hard even for some amongst us to recognize the move of God how can a a place literally be blowed apart and we don't move now what do you mean by that brother you saying I need to get out in the aisles and and dance because some young people were dancing or I need to speak in tongues or I need to shout no I don't care what you do but if the whole place is moved by the spirit of God and this is you something's wrong yes sir wrong with your soul not in your spirit and just this the way I am know something's wrong in your soul I'm not saying you have to do nothing but if the king passes by he's worthy of this he's worthy of a bowed head in prayer instead of gawking like why are they doing that again listen I've said it before and I'll say it again everybody ain't going to dance everybody ain't going to shout but when David said he wanted a drink of water from the whale the whole Army didn't go but there was three that said I will so if he comes through this place and he's thirsty for a dance somebody's going to give it to him and you know what those three weren't looked at and despised those three were honored because they gave the king a drink not there they go again going to get water for David but some of us why do we struggle and I've already explained this in the past few minutes I'm not knocking as much as I'm saying it's what you've been taught and it's your tradition we got to raise our expectations above our [Music] Traditions I don't ever want it to be thought that me or brother Tim or Timothy or brother Joe or any any real man of God teaching the word thinks that everybody's got a shout jump dance run not at all but when the king comes through he deserves your worship however that is that's all I'm saying he deserves your worship everybody's going to do that differently but to know he's in the building and to intentionally withhold because in those atmospheres the only way you cannot worship is to intentionally withhold that's not up for debate it's a choice I choose not to something's wrong with the soul why is it so hard to recognize the move of God because of the teachings of man because in the car ride on the way home we talk about that one person who always gets emotional and so in our mind that's all it is are the misplacement of scriptures or limiting God or lowering expectations why didn't they recognize Jesus when he came wrong expectations oh he's going to come as a king he's going to overthrow the Roman government he's going to do this he's going to come down to you know Caiaphas say and he was born in a barn and he was the prince of peace and he said turn the other cheek he said give unto Caesar what is Caesar's and like that ain't him because their expectations were wrong he didn't come according to their Traditions look I'm so thankful today for a prophet that took out look all of us would be looking in the wrong place this morning all of us would be focused on traditions this morning but he came and what he did was he turned our expectations back to the word of God he put our expectations right back aligned with the word and so today our expectations aren't aren't formed by generations of denominational ideas because that's what caused the Jews to miss him hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years since a prophet had come and so it was their ideas and what they thought the prophecies were and they formed their own ideas the teachers of that day should have known him Israel was a covenant people just like us called chosen blessed and they were looking for the Messiah but with wrong expectations the scriptures spoke of him the prophets declared him they were wanting to see him but somewhere in the waiting somewhere in the time period between the prophets and the manifestation of of the word in a flesh body called Jesus somewhere in the studying and the teaching and the learning their expectations for what God would do and how God would act and how these scriptures would be fulfilled got twisted and they got off and it became intellectual it became learn about it and they weren't really looking for the m IAH anymore they were looking to continue living peacefully in their traditions and so I ask you are you looking for the Messiah still every day do you wake up and say Lord is this the day or you just looking to continue peacefully in your tradition as a message believer or are you looking for the coming of the Lord if we aren't looking for him guess what you won't see him if you're not looking for his coming you're going to miss his coming he says remember get this close now he only appears to those who are looking for him he only appears to those who are looking for him he didn't stutter he wanted to drive the point home makes himself known to those who are looking for him where did the Jews get away from the supernatural where did the message Community get away from the supernatural when did they quit expecting God to move these same people saw the Red Sea open they saw Jordan roll back they saw Jericho fall they'd seen move on their behalf Time After Time After Time but at some point they quit expecting God to move like that what are we talking about today we got to keep our expectations right we got to keep our expectations right the expectation isn't just good morals the expectation isn't just good homes and good churches today my expectation is the Holy Ghost today my expectation is that he's moving for me now that he's moving in my body now he's moving in my home now he's moving for my children now that the Rapture is at hand now the coming of the Lord is at hand now that's my expectation that's where my faith is and when he does show up in this service or in my home I want to recognize him I want to say that's him moving that's him moving right there I recognize it they should have recognized him but when he rode into Jerusalem and people got excited because they were looking for him they were expecting as a matter of fact they they had they were all gathered there at the gate there was rumors swirling that he was coming and they knew the prophecy that he would be on the CT and and they were looking and they were excited so when they saw it they begin to shout hosana they begin to lay down the the the robes and lay down the The Palms and they begin to dance and shout and scream Hosanna because they were expecting it and then there he was they were shouting and screaming and praising but the church leaders of the day said who is this is this just an emotional work up at their meetings who is this is that just the music making them do that who is this why they all snotting down at the altar who is this are they are they just in the flesh when they were the very ones who should have known who it was they knew the word so well and yet they couldn't see it when it was manifested because they were under false expectations brother Brown says and isn't it and it isn't changed any today because the holy spirit is forerunning the coming of the Lord Jesus and as the Holy Spirit begins to stretch out across the Earth Revival fires are broken out everywhere great signs and wonders has been done healings has took place prophecies has went forth all the Gatherings of the apostolic blessing has come back to the church again so as it was then so is it now the spirit of the unbeliever still cries out who is this when he moves in our church don't say who is this say I know who it is I know who it is Lord cuz I was expecting you to show up this morning I came knowing you going to move on my behalf this morning I came prayed up expecting to see you this morning Lord I know it's you I see it's you and I want to pray praise you cuz I'm expecting you to move in my family I'm expecting you to save my children I'm expecting you to restore this marriage I'm expecting an outpouring of the Holy Ghost I'm expecting a refilling of the Dynamics of the power of God in my life I see you Lord I recognize you Lord thank you Jesus for coming by our way this morning Hallelujah may we have our expectations right so that we always recognize him I'm thankful today for men of God who raise expectations men who don't lower them but who'll tell you that he's still the same today that he was yesterday that he still moves that he still feels that he still manifests amongst his people tells you you can overcome you are going to make it brother brandom says I haven't got much hopes for a pastor's church that hasn't got Ambitions to better themselves day by day and year by year a church that's really a church of the the Living God will never stop listen if you can't look back to where you were a year ago and dislike it it tells me you're still there a church that's really a Church of the Living God will never stop say well I just come in I guess it's all right now that ain't the Church of God he's got an ambition to press on brother that's not the ambition of the Church of God if he brings one he wants another and another and another and another there's no end to it just keep on climbing up see we want to have an ambition and expectations God wants us to be that way well every service can't be like why well every service ain't going to have a well sometimes it's you it's just a Wednesday it's just Bible study there's only a third of us here more for me I'm EXP to move right now I'm expecting to pour it out now just as great as any other service that we've ever had because our God isn't limited by circumstance by Time by people he said where two or three are gathered I'll be there in the midst and when he's there the miraculous happen the power of God's on this place the sick are healed the Lost are saved I'm expecting great things Hallelujah hallelu we don't need people in the pool pit telling you that you got to live with the devil that you must live with your issue and learn to cope with it lowering expectations that's what Saul did to David somebody finally got enough courage to go out and face the giant somebody finally got enough courage to get loose in the spirit to praise a little bit somebody finally expected God to back up his word somebody read Mark 16 before church and came to church fired up ready to see it in action cuz Mark 16 in action is the true church all else is false but then their preacher got up and said to David thou are not able to go against this Philistine thou are not able to get the Holy Ghost like they did in the book of Acts you are not able to be healed by the laying on of hands prayer lines do no good you are not able to see the gifts you are not able you listen you may not be able but don't tell me what I'm able I'm able to receive every blessing that God has given me I'm able to face any giant I got an expectation this morning that giant is coming down I've got expectations you can stay in the tent you can tell them you can't have it but I'm going into the valley this morning and that giant is leaving my property he's leaving my family he's turning my children loose that Giant's coming down this morning Hallelujah you may not want it you may not can take it but there's a people who said I've been called to it I've been chosen for it I'm going out to battle to claim every promise of God this morning hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord but we got too many captains willing to stop short maybe not go back to Egypt but stop short and settle down in their Traditions just let them have church let them accept the mechanics of the word but you keep all those Dynamics away that's just for special meetings if then you may have seen this quote before brother Joe but it shocked me it's in 1959 there's still a lot of amazing miraculous things going on 1959 brother Brown says it's the holy Spirit coming forth with the gospel in signs and wonders miracles to make ready a people why is those things happen Make Ready a people it's not for entertainment it's to make ready a people The Heir is charged with expectations amen with Believers expecting him to come amen and others are saying why these revivals why youth camps why special meetings why prayer lines why do we have it let's settle down to a church why it's been said in this church right here what do you know what they saw in that church right there and [Music] witnessed when we started to build the new church said we don't need miracles what we don't need these things anymore this is his church you want them go out on the field where they happen we don't need them here I want to go on record this morning we need them here I need them here and I'm not just hoping for him I'm expecting them here I'm expecting the sick healed the Lost saved I'm expecting the miraculous I'm expecting the supernatural I'm expecting a pillar of fire to come down service after service after service after service until the day takes us all the way from here I still need the miraculous I still need a Healer I still need a deliverer my children still need the Holy Ghost so I'm going to stand on it I'm going to believe for it I'm going to preach on it until the day my B's changed we need it here here hallelujah hallelujah our expectations are formed by the word not by the current condition around us not by the strength of the enemy not by our situation what you doing this morning brother a I just want you to get your eyes off the situation get your eyes off the circumstance get your eyes off the politics here in a couple weeks we're going to have an election and guess guess what somebody's going to win and we're going to wake up the next day one day closer to the coming of the Lord no matter who it was the coming of the Lord I don't know the date but the date set whether it's Donald Trump KLA Harris date set I don't affect nothing that's right dat set right what do you think about the presidential election Lord's coming back what if he went Lord's coming back what if she WIS Lord's coming back what are your expectations for 2025 Lord's coming back the Lord's coming back that's my expectations get your eyes away from all that and back on the word the Lord is coming back and he's coming back soon Amen brother Brown says if you go to look at circumstance or to look what's around you you are sure to fail but you must never look at what's going on around you because circumstances don't limit God but they limit our faith if we begin to focus on them but he is the god of circumstance this morning and I'm telling you not to let the things that you're seeing around you limit your expectations of this unlimited God why brother Aaron because God is God God is God you under attack today you find yourself in a valley today the stresses of Life Weighing on you today God is God your children are out of church God is God you find yourself down deep in the valley God is God you find yourself sick this morning God is God you find yourself de press God is God and he don't change he's God this morning you have limitations Your Heroes Have limitations God has no limitations and God and his people has no limitations my expectations today are the same in the valley as they are on the mountain you are going to go through valleys some of them deeper than others some of of them darker than others some of them harder than others but God's the same in the valley as he is in the mountain we're going to begin to turn this a little bit as we start heading towards home and I want to deal with the valley a little bit because remember circumstances when the devil get you down in the valley he likes to say see now where's your God see you served him all these years and you ended up in this Valley see you've tried so hard where's all your friends at now you're in this Valley alone whether it's true or not you know you feel that way sometimes that's you're fighting this alone you're by yourself let's make a deal I'll let you out of this Valley but you got to give me something I'll let you out of this Valley but you're going to give up something God doesn't have limitations God doesn't care where you're at this morning God's going to bring you Victory see the devil tries to get get you to limit God because of where you are but God is God of where you are what did the syrians say in First Kings 20 and 23 and the Servants of the king of Syria said unto him their gods are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than us but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they what's the devil saying let get down in the valley let her get under this sickness let that family come under this attack let the stress of work really begin to pile up and let's attack when they're sick and when they're struggling then we'll overcome because see they're God they're really only strong when they're on the Mountaintop and the children of Israel were numbered and were all present and went against them and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country when it looks hopeless I'm expecting God to move when I'm under attack I'm expecting God to move when I'm hurt and I see no way out I'm expecting God to move but see The syrians Limited God and he heard it and it angered him and there came a man of God and spake unto the king of Israel and said thus saith the Lord because the syrians have said the Lord is a god of the hills but he is not God Of The Valleys therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand and ye shall know that I am the Lord see he's not just the god of the mountains but he is the god of the M Valley he is the God of all of it so he's the god of your sickness this morning he's the god of your trial this morning he's the god of your circumstance he's the god of your situation the devil says I got him and God goes because you have limited me I'm going to destroy you under the feet of my bride that's a Son of God that's a child of God and he has a right footsteps or possession whether he's in the valley or whether he's on the mountain he is going to destroy you today because he is my son you have limited me you have said he couldn't overcome in this trial oh Hallelujah but there's victory in your Valley this morning amen he's the God of all of it and he will be victorious in all of it God heard it God heard it God's heard in this age as they said where is your God God's heard in this age as they said they can't take a Rapture from the valley of Leota they can't overcome in this Satan's Eden they can't overcome and God heard it and said thus sayith the Lord because you have said this that bride is going to overcome every devil she's going to conquer every situation she's going to take a body change and w capture right out of that Valley Hallelujah he says watch me they will be destroyed why because circumstances do not limit God he is God yes brother Aaron I'm in a valley this morning that's okay some of the greatest victories in the Bible came in valleys and these scriptures don't go I skipped some you'll notice just to get the story and and Saul and the men of Israel gathered together and pitched by the valley of Eli and set the battle array against the Philistines it's in a valley and it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and Drew n to meet David that David hastened and ran toward the Army to meet the Philistine listen David was not afraid of the valley he knew that God was God on the hill he was God in the valley I'll kill that devil in the good times I'll kill that devil in the bad times I'll overcome when money's tight I'll overcome when I'm being blessed I'll overcome when I'm sick I'll overcome when I have health I will overcome because my God is the god of every circumstance and he hastened and ran towards the Army to meet the Philistine and the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines until they came to the valley and to the gates of erron what's David show here sometimes you got to go into the valley to get your Victory sometimes you're going to walk through a hard time to get your Victory and it's all for the glory of God but one thing's for sure you're not gonna get it staying where you're at saon proved that they'd been there for 40 days and 40 nights and wasn't one step closer to Victory sometimes you got to go into the you know you we read the scripture in Psalms 23 and I know we don't look at it like this or refer to it like this but I was just thinking you know we usually use it as it refers to maybe funerals or or whatever but David was writing that from experience though I walk into the valley of the shadow of death you know how many men Goliath had killed yeah do you know how much death he had robed and and and I can just see David looking back thinking oh I didn't go to him in My Own Strength I didn't go to him but God went with me that's right I came to him in the name of the lord of the armies of Israel oh yes under inspiration do I walk into the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil there may be cancer in there I will fear no evil there may be diabetes in there I fear no there may be depression in there there may be every kind of demon of Torment in there and though I have to walk down into that Valley I will fear no evil for thou art with me oh Lord he wrote it from experience I believe we're a people that have experienced valleys and we've experienced that he's with us we've gone into the valley and we've come out with Victory I'm not afraid of a valley today my God is the god of the valleys he's the god god of the mountain he's a god of every situation Hallelujah Gideon then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the East were gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezel and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the East lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the Sand by the Sea for multitude and the three companies blew the trumpets and break the pictures and held the lamps in their hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with all and they cried the sword of the Lord and Gideon and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the host ran and cried and fled where where was this victory at in your Valley outnumbered in a terrible situation with bad circumstances but the victory was in the valley Deborah defeated the Canaanites in the valley it elah slew the prophets of Baal in the valley of kesan it was in the valley that the dry bones came to life for the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones so I prophesied as he commanded me and breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great Army I don't care where you're at today he is God and I expect to be victorious I expect him to move on my behalf Hallelujah the Jews have a saying that says the salvation of the Lord comes in the blink of an eye that's right that's all it takes the blink of an eye the salvation of the Lord comes in the blink of an eye let's raise our expectations knowing that any moment any blink of the eye Victory Is Ours raise our expectation to the level of the promise the Rapture is at hand in the blink of an eye in the moment in the twinkling of an eye the salvation of the Lord he's God when I'm on the mountain today he's God when I'm in the Valley he's God in my good days and he's God in my bad days what's it mean when it says the word of God will will overcome any place anywhere anytime under any situation I can whoop him when I'm sick I can whoop him when I'm healthy I can whoop him on the mountain I can whoop him in the valley the devil can't stand against a son or daughter of God when they take the word of God upon their lips it's good anywhere anytime any place in your situation today in the valley expect Victory I say let's be in the tent door this morning like Abraham looking for him expecting him let's expect this morning like the woman with the blood issue he says the woman with the blood issue was expecting If She Could Touch the Hem of His Garment it was over she wasn't hoping she was expecting when she touched the Hem of His Garment her expectations were fulfilled let's be like those wise men that saw his star because they were looking for him Church we're at the very coming of the Lord are we looking for him are we expecting to see him today but if you come expecting to be blessed God will see to it you'll get what you expect if you're expecting to be healed tonight you'll go home well that's just right if you're expecting it but first you've got to be under expectations you've got to believe it that's the reason no one seen the star in the days that it led the wise men but the wise men because they was expecting to see it they was watching for that star to rise and the prophet balam said that there'd be a star of Jacob arise and they were wise men astrologers and so forth they watched for that star they was watching for it that's the reason they seen it if you're watching to see the coming of the Lord no doubt but what yours said our expectations are going to be made manifest so today if your expectations were made manifest what would you get think about not your hopes what you're expecting if right now they were manifested if right now they came through that back door if right now it manifested in your body body what would you get think about it some people would get nothing but some people that have been looking for it I've been waiting for them back doors to open I've been waiting for somebody to sit down next to me I've been waiting for a sweep to come over my body I've been waiting for this I've been expecting this I knew it was coming I knew you were coming back I never had a doubt I knew it I was expecting it what would you get right now I say the Bride of Jesus Christ would get everything she's looking she's longing she's expecting him to fulfill his word despite the circumstances Hallelujah I know we believe in the moving of the spirit here at evening light I know we believe in the Supernatural and the miraculous and we've seen great things and we and we've have we've had and we have great expectations but we can't get comfortable and settle down where we are no matter how much ground we've covered no matter how far we've come right there after Pentecost in the Ephesian age they knew the power of God they manifested the power of God they operated in the power of God but over time they begin to settle they began to get comfortable Jude could see it slipping and he cried out contend fight hold on to it don't let your expectations slip away they drifted and their expectations changed and what happens there is the next generation is raised with Lowered Expectations and they never see beyond that level that's right and then that becomes normal and then the next Generation comes up with Lowered Expectations and we never get to the place to where cold and formal become normal I'm fully aware brother Joe that not every service is going to go the same God moves differently there's times some of the most Mighty services are just solemn he's just dealing in your heart I understand that when I say the movement of the spirit don't always think that we mean one thing we mean the move of the spirit however he chooses that to be but don't let us go a few services without feeling his presence without going okay what's wrong Lord I need to be in prayer for this service Lord what's going on don't let that become normal to where it's just that you come it's the status quo we had church and we went home because that's what happened down Through the Ages as they drifted further and further and then the next group has even lower expectations and then that becomes normal and what ends up happening is it manifest and it manifests itself as cold as formal and Powerless and this morning like like Jude would say I'm crying out contend amen Lord's been good to us contend for it he's moved in our services contend for it expect it he's done it before Lord I want to see it again Lord I'm not going to sit back and say Lord I Thank you for every testimony but testimonies we get it mixed up sometime testimonies aren't there for us to always look back to testimonies are so we know what he's going to do he did it so he's going to do it he's done it before he's going to do it again those testimonies are so when we Face Goliath we can say he already took care of me when I fought a bear he already took care of me when I fought a line so today he's going to bring my giant down I'm not satisfied with the testimonies of the past but God I'm expecting more today and more tomorrow every time we come together I'm expecting I'm looking for him now I'm expecting him now Hallelujah so we can see we're back again to the same place and we find out expectations that God comes to those all through the scriptures it's been the same thing he always appears to those who are expecting him always to those who are wanting to see him church he ain't going to let this bride down amen he ain't going to fall short of those expectations oh they make made fun of that that little wash girl there in the story he's coming back for me she was expecting and they laughed listen let him laugh he ain't going to leave you there matter of fact if you listen real close I believe I hear Wagon Wheels coming right now I believe it's time to go put the dress on I believe you need to be dressing yourself in this word right now he's provided the material and he's coming back to get you and when he gets back he's not wanting you to have to go oh I got to go clean up real quick ain't going to be time for that he gave you the wedding garment a long time ago and he said I'm coming back when I show up be ready be dressed I say I'm expecting him to come back today Lord I'm putting on your word Lord take everything off of me that I don't need I want to please you Lord when you see me I want to be ready to go if there's things I've held on to Lord Strip Me of them today and just let me be found dressed in the word of God CU I'm expecting you to come back any moment Hallelujah there's a people who are expecting today and they're not going to be disappointed their expectations have been brought back in line with the word of God and now their expectations are being made manifest I believe our expectations have been made manifest they expect God to move and when I say they you you expect God to move and he moves you expect God to heal and he heals you expect God to save and he does you expect to do the works that I do and you do amen because your expectations are becoming made manifest they expect him in their services and he comes
