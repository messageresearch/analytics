your feelings by your needs whatever it is this god is a god that is rich in mercy a god rich in grace that'll reach right down to you to your need to your situation amen we want to believe god today with all our hearts we always want to believe him but in this hour we got to have people that believe that have faith put faith into action it's really important it's a day and hour when the ends of the world has come we have already pre-tribulation plagues that are hitting here there everywhere we're just asking god to just come on the scene for his children i have their many prayer cloths today some are being sent out to covered patients others over well overseas some places we can't send to we apologize for that the mail service won't deserve it won't deliver it during this time it's cut off service remember their needs where prayer costs can't reach prayers can go right on through anyway amen because prayers can go beyond this room and out of this dimension into the dimensions of the unseen [Music] a man who can find whatever the need is wherever it is wherever a believing child of god is there are those that are writing me asking me for prayer for loved ones when brother wilson from us from south africa's who want restoration for his sister and husband and daughter they're backslidden it's an awful thing to be backslidden in this hour amen we need jesus more than ever we also have a prayer request for a sister a sister melanie from australia her husband needs god's deliverance he's a very very sad story of from a young boy being tragedies in the home horrible things that happened that a young boy should never seen [Music] drove him to drinking he still is drinking he needs a deliverance a daughter in that home that since the age of three a spirit of sadness is overtaking her and because she just don't want to live but you know there's a god that cares about people and their needs maybe i don't read every request over this pulpit that comes in from everywhere but if i get them they come across to me i pray for every one of them let's take a moment say god that's your child crying out to you [Music] there's many as i said not in our church though there are a few that the enemy is struck down with that horrible thing presses souls it needs a touch can't be in service today because of it but there are these our brothers and sisters is what this represents and these are just little shreds of cloths that i've been holding in my pocket and i now hold in my hand and we're going to go to the lord and i want you to go to the lord for your need whatever it is god knows he knows exactly what your situation is and he's able to do the exceeding abundantly above what you're able to think around you think or ask it he can do it by beyond that if you've got the capability to think it he's got the capability beyond that to meet that what you're even thinking and i want you to agree together with me and let's believe the lord for your god's children everywhere for this service this morning father we're your children we come in your name lord [Music] and we love you from the depths of our hearts and we just want to express our gratefulness to you as your people lord that are called by your name are humbling themselves [Music] lord they're believing in a great god who's able to do way beyond we can think you're the healer and the deliverer and the savior the satisfier and i'm asking god that you'll satisfy the needs of your children we read in the bible lord where they took from the body of saint paul handkerchiefs and laid him on the sick and evil spirits left them we know the power of your blood lord we know the power of prayer we know the power of asking and receiving and today we bind the enemy that has struck the children of god down everywhere those with cobian that are struggling to breathe or some fatigue and sickly they can't hardly stand their cells this morning have no strength i pray in the name of jesus that el will come there and they will take from him today the strength giver and receive strength on the inside i asked father that you bless this little home down in south africa is praying for a wife so that she can be a at home and lord there's others that are praying that daddy can come home and that he can be a real daddy a real father and not be off somewhere else but doing his responsibilities and others are praying and sending out requests all for for loved ones that have strayed away and many many needs lord and they're your great big needs to them lord they're big needs to us but they're nothing for you to do we ask that you'll meet the needs of your children today and bring healing and deliverance continue touching our brother ron lord is who is has received strength lord but he needs lord complete and total deliverance we believe that nothing can stand before our prayers not even cancer lord we believe that for sister erica brother donny's daughter but they have asked us to remember and we'll not fail to remember little 96 pound girl lord kennedy is only working now 50 lord now i have to take this chemo starting tomorrow but let us look away from that and look look away to calvary where there was one wounded for our transgressions one that was bruised for our iniquity one two one who that took the chastisement so of our peace that could we can have peace and by whose stripes we are now healed and i speak healing in the name of jesus and deliverance in the name of jesus and we call all of heaven to witness that we are the believing children standing right here right here in laodicea declaring the word of god is the truth in this last age and we believe from the depths of our hearts and we receive it now in the name of jesus and for every one of us here lord there are those that are lost that needs saving there are those that are justified that and they've accepted you as savior but they need sight to find there are those men sanctified needs for you there are those that have been filled with the holy ghost lord that needs today to stir up that gift of god within them i ask that ever needs to be supplied now in jesus name and we thank you for it lord amen praise the lord amen thank you jesus thank you lord god any rivers you think are impossible god in any rivers you think are uncrossable god any mountains you cannot turn all through but listen this god specializes in things thought impossible and he will do what no other power can do i'm saying it slowly it's a prayer right now god any rivers you think are uncrossable it looks impossible god any mountains you can't turn all through god specializes and things thought impossible [Music] and he will do what no other power can do do you think things are impossible i'll tell you what we had something that looked impossible didn't look like he'd ever get fixed a man that just walked along in life [Music] with a religious spirit on him always living a failure but also very religious but last october in the meeting that evil spirit left him and it's been replaced with something so much better and so much greater and today i'm going to baptize him in the name of the lord jesus christ victor middleton amen god bless you he can do what no other power can do and he can do it for your life today whatever you think is impossible he can do it amen god bless you matthew chapter 8 in verse 23 we want to go to this scripture once more and um we're just we just look here matthew 8 verse 23 and then we'll go to zechariah chapter 4 1. but right now matthew 8 23 and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea in us so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him and saying lord save us we perish and he said unto them why are you fearful o ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm but the men marveled saying what manner a man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gerges um there met him too possessed with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man might pass by that way then zechariah chapter 4 verse one we'll read from there and this scripture would come to me along with some other scriptures and about three o'clock in the morning this week which is why i'm taking this subject again and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what seesthal and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick olive gold and a boulder up on the top of it and his seven lamps they're on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are up on the top thereof and two olive trees buy it one up on the right side of the bowl and the other on the on the left side thereof so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord and then he answered and spake unto me and saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstones thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it amen god bless you you can be seated we're going to speak today on the awakening and we're still continuing the thought of is their hope of revival and we're going to speak on the awakening so as we're looking here in the scripture today as i said the scriptures come to to me and the wee hours of the morning this week and as i was awakened by the spirit of god and he began to deal with my heart and as i have been just combing over some of the very things that the prophet of god said going page by page um you know i i just have taken the the the sermons that i have studied and marked through because um you know i'm someone challenged me and saying you know well what is what you're expecting really what is to happen so i said well you know i'll go back to the prophet's message a man to to see that what i my expectations line up with what a prophet of god said so i've taken you know now all the way from 63 through 65 and just going page by page and combing through and and collecting just little parts and bits and pieces and because i i want to be fine-tuned in this hour i want to be very sensitive to what the lord is doing and to have the right kind of expectations amen because the wrong kind of expectations only bring disappointments now um i came across this little quotation in 65 that brother branham said and does god change his mind ever change his mind about his word and jeffersonville and this was in his prayer as he uh began that sermon and he said dear lord jesus we are assembled again in your name with great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power of god to bring us into recognition of our position and place and our responsibilities as being a called people separated from the world and dedicated to god now so there again an outpouring of the quickening power we ought to even look for that in this service this morning amen may this not be just another service amen not just be another time i want you to focus in this this could be a very very important time to you today amen and if you don't if you don't focus him i'm going to help you do it amen i'm not going to throw my water bottle at you or don't have some books to do it but i may just come down and speak to you all right amen so you know um as we're just looking at this we want to stay very focused that we can recognize our position where are we at in this time what our place is in our responsibilities now we are living in some very interesting times and looking back over the trail of time i would say there's been a lot of surprises along the journey uh even a lot of disappointments along the journey some things that we could have never imagined and if we ever needed faith it is now amen we we must believe we really have no option and um by our new birth we we were designed to believe and not to doubt and so that's why i'm going to preach today on the awakening that jesus must not no longer just be with us and that be allowed just to sleep on our boat in other words someone that is there and present but he's just you know he is not recognized in in our lives in our midst and he isn't given the place a preeminence that he he deserves amen but he must he must be called into action now we know that jesus of course the the corporal body sits on the throne of god and certainly he is not asleep and he's not he's not comatose and he's not um uh uh unaware of what we're going through or where we're at at this time but he ever lives to make intercession on our behalf so he is cognitive of every bird that falls of every problem that you have of every situation he is cognitive it but we we must do our part to go before the throne of grace and meant to bring that portion of that promise to our own selves and so he he of course is not asleep but sometimes i think on the inside the holy spirit that we have is is sometimes not brought to the forefront of our being as christians and this is what brother branham was talking about when he was saying go away jesus bring him back to the forefront amen bring that holy spirit where that is um uh we know it's alive but where that is awakening and working and that we're we're moved by the spirit instead of operating by the flesh because we are still a two-part being you know we are in that sense we have the holy spirit but yet we're human beings now of course in that when we're looking even in the old testament we found a man in the days of zechariah where an angel came and talked with him and and in his talking with him he awakened him as a man that is waking out of his sleep so he was awakened there um you know they're out of his sleep and brought to realization where that um that uh of uh that there were things that were present that was right there that he would be able to see if he was awakened now i want you to get the idea i mean he was he was awakened to something present and i want you to get this this is what we want to understand there can be an awakening you know to what is already present to what god is doing in this hour now so anyway he says he says this that he looked and he said i saw seven golden lamps and and then he began to hear the voices of god once that he becomes awakened to what he sees then and then then he begins to hear also as you know when you go to sleep your your hearing kind of fades away and and blocks out the sounds and someone when they call you a lot of times you hear them from a way of far distance and it way you know you start gradually coming oh did somebody call me but but it seemed to be something way far away at first and you wake and then to realize uh and become alert someone called me somebody's trying to get my attention and this can be of course the condition of people that you know they they have christ on the inside of them and they have a great faith that is on the inside of them but it lays dormant within them because it is not they are not awakened to it and we want to shaken by the holy spirit today to shake us and make us realize amen that they're somebody present amen somebody this present amen now so amen i believe don't you so right now i just take dominion over every spirit this morning every spirit i'm taking dominion over right now in the name of jesus christ now as we're there talking about this brother branham said what's the matter with the church today so apparently there was something wrong that we would ask that question he said we're full of theology without any dynamics in it in other words you've got to have the spark to the gasoline it's not even as good as water he said as long as it hadn't got the spark to fire it and no matter how well we have been taught and i want to say i think we've been well taught in this message and how well we how well we believe and how much we the bible we say is true and we believe it all to be true and i think that would be all our confession this morning we believe it's right amen it's got to be but the dynamics has to be there to spark to set that word of fire and make it start rolling it's got to have that if you don't the church sits still and the car sits still and you sit still but no matter how much you say i sympathize i believe every word of that you've got to have something to spark that off to make that 100 octane to go to firing and the big church of god to go to moving on it's got to take the dynamics with the mechanics nothing wrong with the mechanics just lacking the dynamics and i think that's what's the matter with the church today i'm still quoting brother branham that we're lacking that dynamical power to press this word and make it live for the day he said martin luther had the mechanics and dynamics of his day in other words he had a message just shall live by faith and it worked amen and he says you know john wesley and them of his day pentecost with their with had them with their day but what about our day this is another time the church should be fully grown now ready to go meet christ with the manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the bible operating in that one great body where he promised that he would meet the people and be worshiped in this great church of his so again the church should be fully grown ready to go meet christ with the manifestation of every blessing amen now again brother branham would have some different things to say about the conditions of this time and this age and the situations where we're at and then in 1964 he said why the church why it ought to be in its most glorious stage right now and the power of his resurrection and great signs and wonders so this is where the church should be i want to say this is where the church is amen we're at that very place where god is wanting to reveal himself amen now again he said in testimony testimonial c he said we find out that miracles isn't taking place no more like they were the sick goes home sick and and he says it isn't because of god it's because the lack of revival among the people so then again if we want it where the sick doesn't go home sick and the needs of the people where miracles aren't taking place anymore then we've got to get back in revival again amen you say but brother tim that's impossible there's no hope of revival but i'm hearing a prophet say something different than what we've been told over and over and over again sure revival is over for america revival there not be another worldwide revival amen even the revival brother rem said that we that his promise he said it'd be so small they won't even know anything about it but i'm just telling you the movie is on for the bride that is thus saith the lord and they say you can't have an old pentecostal old-fashioned pentecostal revival i'm quoting from 1965 easter seal i mean he said but he said but you can have one in yourself so every person can have that revival the nation may be gone but you you're still here you need to be gone you need to leave this world and you know that the bride of christ and i'm quoting brother bratton again will by no means be laodicea she will not be lukewarm she will be on fire for god amen and he said because of the lack of revival among the people there's no revival they just sit and listen and go home and say well that was pretty good and and that's not in and see there's not that zeal now i'm just going to tell you what i'm preaching today about the awakening brother branham was telling us there has been a rest between revivals and he said in this rest we've gone on a journey and on that journey we got jesus in the boat but as we're going along the journey there's been storms that have come up and we have forgot who's in the boat with us and he's telling us we must wake him because he's the only hope of getting to the other side now the other side we're one to go to is a rapture amen amen and we're not just going to deliver a few among the tombs all there there will be deliverance but even all of those that are asleep in the tombs that are the bride of christ down through the seven ages are going to rise up out of those tombs we're on a journey of a lifetime we're on a journey no other age has ever been set on but jesus has set us on this journey hey man and she is in the boat with us and his word cannot fail amen there will be a rapture in this end time there will be a resurrection [Applause] now and let me just tell you the time of just sitting there getting a good message and going home and maintaining what you got is over with it's time we put to work what we got now again in world falling apart 63 november it seems like a drying out to the churches hardly confined to church anymore that's alive with the word and with the spirit of god and great things taking place like it was like it was not long ago now you may wonder brother jim why are you emphasizing this why are you preaching like this because this rest between revivals cannot go on forever it's time we start stressing the dynamics amen i mean you know we have stressed the mechanics for the last 50 years around the message it's time we you know realize hey there's another wing to this and just with one wing flopping around you just flop around in a circle you never get off the ground that it takes two wings for this eagle to fly so there must have mechanics and dynamics amen this is time we start stressing the dynamics and that's what i'm doing and why am i stressing the dynamics because i'm tired of seeing the sick go home sick i'm tired of seeing people just maintain a denominational experience in a message truth church sitting on a message pew and all they've got is a denominational experience i joined a church i belong to this society of a church now and that's why i'm announcing this morning that the rest between revivals is over amen we have started out on a journey after the great healing revival that crescendoed on my that revival crescendoed into uh you know into the book being taken by the lamb and it's seven seals open and thus delivered its contents to us to word today we have an open book and we have spent 60 years since we discovered where we were in time go back 60 years ago and you'll know where we're at and man you're we're we're right back to what was it um 1960. and that we we we discovered there where we were in time that as a church we had journeyed through seven ages come on and we had now come to the last one and there's not going to be another age there's not an eighth one come on there's not something beyond this message there's not a bright age beyond this message or this age amen but right here in this last age there is a bride who has come to maturity who knows her place and knows her position amen now somehow along this journey we are hearing views that have been expressed in the boat that pentecost is really not our goal that you know but before jesus went to sleep in our boat he taught that that went over your head maybe you're just thinking about it i said somehow we're hearing views in this and you know been hearing views as we went along in this testimony on the sea and people have been talking about the message and they you know we've had the different ones discussing well this is talking about the miracles this is talking about the doctrines and and they're they're they're you know talking back and forth and weaving back and forth and we've heard views expressed in the boat that really pentecost is not our goal that before jesus but before jesus went to sleep in our boat he taught that you know and somehow we're to end up with something different today that was what was poured out in pentecost now listen even the devil in the storm and there's a devil in this storm amen there's a devil in this storm and we started out on the boat and the winds are now blowing and you know he knows there's deliverance laying ahead he knows there are tombs that's got to be emptied he knows that there's coming a major defeat for him and all of him has come out against us with millions of devils swearing that he would drown us before we can reach the goal are you with me and the devil in the storm knows assuredly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus claims is his own and all else is fault it has to be christ in the church is a continuation of the book of acts don't point to me all their failures i don't want to hear it don't point to me all the bickering and the fussing and whatever except the only good that does to me let me know is that we can have a book of acts right in the middle of trouble amen that's all it points to me that people are people and humans are humans and trouble is trouble no matter where you go and what age you live in but we can have a book of acts right in the middle of trouble i'm talking about we're a continuation of the acts of the holy ghost not the acts of carnal men and it is not the acts of carnal men that has been restored it is the act of the holy ghost working in his people don't miss the point the seven ages were represented by seven lamps the holy fire from the altar being passed from lamp to lamp to lamp as he saw this lamp here with seven golden candlesticks it's a wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven church ages the original outpouring of pentecost which outpouring came direct from jesus from on the mercy seat now no wonder some people say the outpouring is over because they don't believe jesus on the mercy seat no more you see the original outpouring of the holy ghost of pentecost which which became direct from jesus on the mercy is enduring and doing his church through all the seven ages and showing perfectly that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and and the never changing god the in essence and his ways but yet we're being told on the boat that somehow we got something different from what they had next to that the holy ghost don't come the same way amen and for me indeed for many it doesn't match the original outpouring and whatever this snake oil is there that we're trying to burn today the fire of god won't stay lit on it so that's why it keeps going out amen but come back to the original oil listen to what the prophet said what the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern but somehow we're winding up with something different we we don't want those acts 238 blabbering screaming shouting amen who are the second adam's way of acting amen again the prophet of god would tell us what the church had at pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the spirit but somehow we're told to expect different results and if the original root at pentecost was an orange tree how can we have bitter lemons coming forth as the fruit broken fellowship the orders that were to be used to push the boat along toward the gulf has wound up as weapons against one another scripture doesn't fight scripture and quotes don't fight quotes again the the true church will always try to be like the original at pentecost i hope that wrong amen the true church today will try to approximate that early first one the messengers to the churches having the same spirit of god in them will try to approximate the apostle paul they won't be exactly like him but the true messengers will be the ones that come the closest to paul who was free of all man sold out to god and gave forth the word of god only and manifested the holy ghost in power nothing else will do you have to work from the original as light begets like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her founders at pentecost and her messengers will follow the apostle paul the first messenger to the first church is that simple and that wonderful again quoting from brother branham oh where are we spiritually we're in a wilderness we're in a wilderness of darkness how far we've wandered from the first church pentecost is no longer in view the word can't be found you know there comes a point you know in your journey you can look back easily and see where you came from and you're headed toward another goal but you know once you get so far you can't see what was back there and yet you can't see what's up there amen so that's why you got to have the compass of the word just to keep going in the correct direction you were told to go originally amen now again let me just say again that the same spirit that was in jesus while he was there here on earth causing him to do mighty works which he did came back on the church at pentecost so they did the works that he did it is the restoration god will take the church right back to pentecost to the beginning now of course you know we hear the murmurings on the boat but we're in the bright age and there's no revival in this bright age you know why that's because we turn the we turn the bright age into an intellectual revival and we call that a word revival and it's not a word revival it's an intellectual revival now in broken sisters brother branham told us he said education cannot bring life and too many times our our our pulpits have been turned into intellectual um uh uh speeches and talks rather than the power of god into salvation are you with me but it can never bring life as he said it takes the spirit of god to bring life and life must get must not come out of an intellectual revival it's got to come out of the bible a word revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results you got in acts 2. now it always has always will be because it's the spirit of god that conditions the atmosphere and it is the rise in the sun brother branham talked about christ being the first fruits that slept then he talked about the bride coming to christ that there was another first fruits we're at another harvest we're in harvest time and in this harvest time it's not the groom coming it's the bride coming that's what a lot of the confusion that's going on today is people don't realize he had to come and bribe for him before he can come back and groom for him so he's got to come back in his church first amen in order to do that he had to have a word of god that would come to a prophet so it would be a word coming through a prophet to become flesh and a bride come on somebody and that bride to become the bride coming of christ do you realize you are part of his coming that we are already in his coming because god has a bride here on earth who is christ in bright form because he got the same spirit the same life and if you got the same spirit and the same life then you gotta have the same results so he said even as there was a sheaf as it would take uh you know omers of the grain of the barley harvest and they would wave that they would wave that um and in the barley harvest and then that would happen the the day after um after the crucifixion or after the passover and then and then they would then come up 50 days seven weeks later and they would come another waving of the sheep the sheaf sheath not sheep sheath a sheep is a collection of the grains a man and they would collect it and a priest would wave it it's amazing you realize that jesus when he rose from the dead at the rising of the sun he arose from the dead in his resurrection at the very same time that the high priest was there in the temple waving the barley harvest before the lord and here was the first fruits the first one up from the dead hallelujah waving before the people i'm not dead and there was a harvest of the old testament saints for they they that slept rose with him come on there was a harvest then now 50 days later seven weeks later seven churches later it is now not a barley harvest but a weed harvest and the we harvest is the gentile hallelujah amen god has brought a first fruit of the first from among the dead out of the tombs of denomination to wave before the people that he's the same as yesterday today and forever that this one's exactly like the one that fell on the day of pentecost now if you've wheat this is it if wheat was the original planting then the harvest can't produce a different result if it was a weak planet at pentecost you can't have a different result the message must be the same somebody help me preach i mean come on if you planted wheat you don't expect to get corn or that's maize or or or garlic or some other thing you expect wheat amer and if god planted a church on the day of pentecost and it was weak then when it comes back to harvest again how come we're expecting a different result we've got to have the same results and if that one wrote a book of acts this one writes a book of ice and this would display the holy spirit that's what displays the holy spirit the acts of the holy spirit will be in that church and she's way before the people come on amen before the lord as the first ones the first fruits from the dead now this is part of it now i want you to get this now let's talk about it let's talk about the bright age and what its message is because people say well we're in the bright age we're not in pentecostal age which we're not not not azusa we're actually not even in the first stage again we're not in ephesus we're not repeating the church ages this is the bright age you know what bright age means it means where it comes to maturity you don't you don't take a little girl you know that's five six years old and make her a bride unless you're some of these idiots from overseas you don't do that hey man you she's got to come to maturity she's got to be a mature woman and god can't take an immature church that's why he's been waiting on you to grow up amen for you to to develop some faith for you to to grow up in christ to be like yes for the church to be an exact match to him somebody with me amen so for the british he said for the brightest resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message how many wants to know what that message is the message of the bright age is that the full maturity of the word has turned back in his full power and is being waved over the people by the same old signs and wonders that he did back there because i live you shall have also speaking to his wife because i live you shall have also what a resurrection that was 2 000 years ago amen but what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power so the message is go tell my disciples i am not dead i'm not just a creed go tell my disciples i'm alive amen i'm no longer in the tombs of denomination come on i can't be held back in the dark clusters but the holy spirit has been released by the evening time message imagine that message has a message to the world go tell my disciples go tell him i'm not dead i'm not just a theory i'm not just intellectual revival but go tell them i'm alive with the same sign the same wonders the same holy ghost the same power the same divine healing the same miracles i'm alive [Applause] that's the bright age message she's to be the same kind of bride the same kind built out of the same kind of material she was at the first place amen now read malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed to have a message in the last days that it turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to the original oh this is going to choke some of us oh man and i'm not using it as an order to slap you i'm trying to say we need some direction in this hour turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to the original pentecostal message word by word and then he says brothers we are here hallelujah we got the message we just need to go tell amen oh my listen he said there's pentecostal people today by the way this easter seal today let me say this that we are standing how many wants to know where we're standing we are standing in this last day where god promised he had poured out his spirit upon all flesh and his sons and daughters have prophesied for he said these signs shall follow them that believe it's the hour that's what makes that creation in you now so then how do we expect different results if it's the same thing come on amen listen if it we you know if we're to be quickened they're made alive like them then also shouldn't we have the same results let me stop here just for a minute because in the type it was shown from the crucifixion which is the passover time to and the resurrection there were there were again seven weeks is that right and when the day of pentecost was fully come there were these sheeps that had been gathered in the upper room and they were ready to be waived come on and so on the day of pentecost 50 days after come on after the passover and we have come now 50 days or or seven months or seven excuse me seven church ages we have come now is everybody with me you're on the same page now since the passover here we are and now we're filling out all the tights and now the day of pentecost has fully come to the church ages and we are in the days whether the day of pentecost has fully come because it's been the feast of weeks it's been the seven churches but now we're in the last when that pentecostal group on the day of pentecost received their abstract deed isn't that what we got somebody help me preach look look is this not an abstract deed today is it not amen when god took the seven seals off of the book and opened the book and showed us clearly what serpency predestination eternal security all of the things of things in the bible where the bible is now an open book and we're not guessing in it we don't even have brother branham guessing at it prove it into the book wondering if he's right or wrong because now by divine vindiction we have the book open and the seals is off the book giving you an abstract this age has received an abstract of title hallelujah but that's not all of it you as an individual can receive your abstract of title which is the baptism of the holy ghost which means everything that was against you is split up all your sins all your past [Applause] amen ever debt tell me when that you made jesus can't pay amen why you with the holy ghost you have an abstract that ever sinned has been wiped away hallelujah you are free and clear and on the day of pentecost when they received their abstract it glorified their soul they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it quickened their body till they couldn't even speak in an earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a heavenly language the place that we're going to quickening power shook their mortal bodies so till their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language what a quickening power what something that belongs to the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in your immortal body it shall quicken your mortal body we are quickened by the power of the living god tongues quickened up to heavenly language to speak to them eruption of raising up into a different atmosphere than what they ever had lived in and now the with the also with the quickening life to them that come to them it quickened their language they spoke in new tongues it was designed to give them after this abstract it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds so when we got an abstract of the book by the openness seals it opened up every promise in the land that's why i'm preaching on the people of the land because it opens up the whole land everything that god gave in the past is ours is that right if they laid hands on the sick we got the right to do so amen they spoke with new tongues it can happen to you they saw signs and wonders because it's god's promise amen and the quickening power was there now it brought them back to the grounds that's what happened to us it opens up everything now the rapture belongs to you the deed is clear all the confusion of the ages was wiped away come on and when you get the holy ghost the same thing whether your mom or daddy your dad had done it whether you were illegitimately born or whether you were in a situation that you you know where you did the sinning and then we will as it was come on but when you get an abstract it shows the debt is paid and the devil doesn't have a claim on your life anymore glory to god i'm preaching to people that the devil don't have a claim of that we can say like jesus said that that satan has come and he has found no part in me he don't have a part in my life i don't belong to him my body don't belong to him my attitude my spirit nothing belongs to him satan you have no right on the body of the bride of jesus christ you have no right of our children you don't have any right on our children's children because we've got an abstract that the deed is clear and that every promise in the book belongs to us hallelujah when jesus was here he demonstrated the grounds that belonged to the sons of god on those grounds that were healing there were miracles hallelujah how dare we have some ones who said we don't have no rights to it well we're the people of the book amen easter seal he said the works that i do so you do also john 14 12. these signs shall follow them that believe that's mark 16. that is assurance when we see a group of people sitting together until signs manifesting themselves that is the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that's the property of god and you want me to hide it under a bushel you want me not to testify of what god has done amen no sir when we see those signs manifesting themselves when we see healing when we see black sliders coming back protestants coming home when we see those that were impossible saved hallelujah brain bleeds healed come on cancers leave and then kidney disease leave when we begin to see the signs multiplying among us that is the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate this is the property of god it is our property we know now cancer can be healed in our generation amen is our property we know now amen amen you talk about knowledge this is the knowledge we wanted oh my not just knowledge of how to dissect and you know add to and read between the lines and say something brother branham didn't say the message didn't say if the new birth is experienced here's what we have the dew dewdrops that come down from heaven the word of god says it'll wash away your sin and remain and you're baptized in the name of jesus christ for what what for the remission of your sins sins are emitted in the name of jesus christ as he said in his it is a horizon of the son in his prayer father if they're sick may they walk out here well maybe maybe if they're crippled that they'll walk out unto the power of the holy spirit if they've been sinners may they walk out of here washed and cleaned and the mechanics by going in the dynamics from above the holy spirit catch them away quick in their mortal bodies then we will hear you we shall hear genuine new tongues powers of god love and told dying grace and living grace and a resurrected christ a body of bride representing on the earth notice he said the very message again rising of the sun unless i tell you it's going to be from 63 through 65 that's what i'm covering the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he's risen glo tell my disciples i am risen from the dead i'll meet with him to confirm this oh god how in this last day there shall be light again across the earth and i'll prove to my disciples go tell them i'm not dead and i'm not a tradition but i'm a living christ i'll meet them take this message to my disciples that i'm risen from the dead it's the gospel the good news hallelujah so jesus is in our boat i don't care what you're going through today you may be listening to me and kobe's got you down i don't care we got jesus in the boat a boat has got jesus and it is unsinkable are you with me amen and go away jesus he says they seen him do the same thing they had him out there healed the sick and raised the dead before no things tell the people the secrets of the heart and they believed they were on the road to another revival but when trouble set in they forgot all about it it's easy when trouble comes to get our minds off what our real goal is this is when quarrels start in families when they get their minds off of what our real goal is this is when trouble starts when we get our our goal off of jesus we make something else our goal oh if i could just get ahead in life if i could just get ahead if i can just get ahead in life i'll tell you how get jesus you're ahead of everybody else amen come on amen i walked to my home this morning the early mornings i looked around i said thank you lord for my home thank you lord you've provided for me and you've been more than enough and you blessed me abundantly thank you but this is not what i wanted this was never what i wanted it was never what i wanted that's right what i want is that mansion what i want is a mansion about this tall with all his hair and all the right color amen not a defect anywhere 21 forever amen it's not a slogan forever 21 is real there is a people who that's their experience inside their soul they are forever 21 and their bodies going to come and line up with that it's a mansion but when trouble sets in we begin to forget all about who's in our ship he's just as great as he was out here in the divine healing move and opened the eyes of the blind he hadn't changed in power made cripples walk he's still the same god a man he's just as great as he was when he stood in space how many believes us amen i i sort of believe in the big bang it's not a theory it really happened he took and rolled the world off his hand and throwed it out there let it drift maybe for a million years till it comes an iceberg and pulls it back and puts it right in position and place and he sets it there everything revolves around he's the god who did this my god said let her be and it was you want to argue about it in sciences i don't really care what punky science says they never have been true in what they know they only know his men but my god spun this world off of his hands and put it out there a little dot in the universe and he poured all his love out on it and when you take and you look from other worlds and you look from other worlds another universe it's such a little speck it's not even discernable to the eye it's a piece of dust but on that piece of dust let's look a little further there was a timothy hall a little tiny piece of dust and god so loved that piece of dust he became one of them to redeem timothy hall and to make a son of god out of it because this god is so big he can become so little until he becomes a piece of dust just like you to save that piece of dust to bring you back and put you in the orbit that you fell from that was in his mind before the world began and he's not going to lose one of his pieces of dust even if you're a legion bound with demons and the church is struggling to get to you but we're coming in we're coming and i want the devil to know we're coming we're coming for those above the tomb we're coming for the legions that are present we're coming for the sick we're coming for the dead in christ we're coming we're on our way but we've got to get jesus awoke in our ship to get there as i thought about awakening i thought eliza this is three o'clock in the morning live was four days four days i'll go wake him tight luther wesley pentecost and here now we're on the fourth day i go wake him but this time it won't be just lazarus amen remember brother branham was saying that he had this hadn't said lives was all the dead in christ would arose but he said lazarus but this time he won't say lazarus this time he will call and all the dead in christ will hear his voice and live i'm telling you friends we're not just coming for the legions among the tombs we're coming for the dead that is in the tombs makes me want to shout this god is just as great as he was when he healed the lepers there's no problem for your skin condition all right man he's as great as he was in the wealth's revival he's as great as he was in any time and he's hearing the ship trouble to set in brother branham said we go to places we find fusses in the church tear up you know that aruna church stay together he said if we just catch that vision the very jehovah that made the heavens and the earth is right in this little vessel of ours while we're sailing light solemn maine for the holy ghost of jehovah and that's in that in spirit form and you god the holy ghost is god himself in you and jesus said it that day you'll know that i'm in the father the father me and i and you and you and me then god and all he was he poured into jesus and all that jesus was he poured in his church and he divided himself on the day of pentecost that pillar of fire came down and busted itself up this kind of glory and put it in different ones tongues of fire was seen upon each one the holy spirit god identified himself in human beings each of us have us that portion but in that portion in each portion is omnipotence that's why he said if you say this mountain because in you dwells omnipotence are you with me amen amen it's there it resides in you we need to wake jesus maybe we're between revivals brother branham said now i'm quoting he says maybe between the revivals now and he's talked about the revival they'd just been through oh the blind saw the deaf heard you know the different ones were delivered between the revivals now we're looking for another stirrer oh this is one of those forgotten quotes another star we're looking for another star i'm reading this amen it's it's a it's it's an after seals message amen between the revivals now what where's our revivals the divine healing and where the seals were open the miracles and the miraculous was done between these revivals yes there's another revival coming come on no it's not a world revival it's a bride's revival amen and that revival is here and it'll crescendo into the chains of our bodies [Music] and he said between the revivals now we're looking for another star so what i'm trying to tell you there's disturbing going on and there's been a storm been going on somebody helped me preach and devils have been in that storm and caused havoc everywhere come on amen but there's another stir in the stair amen jesus is getting started in the hearts of believers and in the believers there's a stare within the stair and that stair within the stair is going to destroy the stare that the devil has ever stirr every power every satanic move remain right on down to where it'll go find that individual and mercy will come to that house we're between revivals now we're looking for another star where there's got to be something happen that will gather the church together this revival will crescendo in the dead in christ rising legion he lived among the tombs dead things jesus went to deliver those who were among the tombs he wants to seek and to say that which is lost brother branham said is a good hangout for the devil a dead place that's the way it is he hangs out at dead places he said if you want to know truthfully some of the old cold formal churches that has a form of godliness and denies the power thereof is a real hangout for devils didn't the bible say that they would become a cage of every unclean and hateful bird amen you know there that's why sitting on message pews can be can be every kind of sin every kind of sin discovered come on because what the word is not being preached to bring conviction and correction are you with me amen oh he says if you want to know truth some of this old cold formal churches as a form of godliness deny the power of a real hangouts for the devil that's right a place where they say oh that's just a workup that's all mental that's psychology oh mind some of these devils don't make you cut yourself some of them are just as shrewd and polished as can be amen but they're scholars or don't think they're not you know brother branham oh he says he says those jews that denied jesus they were polish bible scholars the same religious devils came down comes down into people today some people trying to make fun of the baptism of the holy ghost they're speaking with tongues [Music] you know they were on their way to deliverance of men who were among the tombs broken and shattered lives right now right now dear brother wrote me i don't want to add to your burdens brother tim but i'm burdened i hear the sound of of children of those with autism of those laying afflicted for years and years and years little more than mindless vegetables and exhausted parents and oh yeah we have them i hear of husbands that are drunks smothering over memories of a horrible childhood where that husband watched murders happen a year of children suffering from demonic oppression with intense sadness until they wish to die i hear mothers crying for their children bound with alcohol some drugs i i i somebody here in this church mothers fathers crying for their children bound with alcohol drugs and then unimaginable sin and they wonder can they be free can they be free brother tim it's awful it's awful for you to build hope for them brother tim there's no hope i'm reminded of that brother branham talks about a young man in a wheelchair and he prayed with him he said now you go and believe him you confess it he kept confessing it confessed it i'm going to be hey i'm going to be well i'm going to walk he's a paraplegic i'm going to walk finally there was some minister got there and said you know it's a shame you know somebody got you to hoping and now you're all unhappy and you're you're dissatisfied with life and you you you now you don't want to walk and it's impossible and and you're you'll never walk you'll never walk son god he got gotta it's like to talk to ron spencer when he fell 40 feet so the first thing i want you to get in your mind is realize you'll never walk again you'll be this way forever and these preachers come there and said i know you got your hopes stirred up by that healing evangelist and that young man right back in his chair and he looked at him he said sirs if you were in my place would you take away the only hope i got and when he said that out of that chair he came and ran all over the place let's realize that there's some of these with horrible condition they're only hope is jesus the only hope is jesus comes alive he's not dead but he comes awake he stirred up inside of this bride that's their only hope well it's awful brother tim are you to build up hope but there ain't no hope i'm not trying to give you hope get us down i am not trying to i'm tearing the lambs wherever this goes from from south africa to to asia to japan to to everywhere it's going everywhere and whoever you are over in canada you're listening i am not trying to build your hope i am preaching faith not hope amen because legion the the bound the afflicted the blind the deaf and the dumb are waiting for us to realize jesus is in the ship [Applause] don't you know brother tim there's no hope for them yeah i know they're hopeless medical science can do nothing for them some normal babies talking walking giving giving an immunization shot go into some kind of shock never speak again become autistic believers children medical science says hopeless and i'm not trying to give them hope i hear brother branham listen i read this quote all of us love our pianist sister lorianne she was a young girl young mother she came to me and she said brother tim the doctors just said i have rheumatoid arthritis and soon i will be in a wheelchair and i became angry i got a call the other day lord laid them hard to call a person they don't go to this church somebody i know a couple i just felt in that moment to give them a call i gave them a call and said oh brother tim my wife's so sick she's so sick she's got a headache she get yeah and it's just been for for years now and it just keeps coming and coming and i got angry i think it's time we get angry this devil has no right to god's children we've got an inheritance it's time somebody gets mad i prayed with him there on that phone and she immediately started feeling better but but as i drove along i said to my wife i am so mad i am so angry i was greeted my teeth and i was saying i am so magic i don't know what to do i'm going to get that devil [Applause] oh that it would come and even the like tabernacle that we'd quit being complacent to let the devil blow us around everywhere come on let him rule our homes and ruin our marriages and wreck our children [Applause] sister loriann i i had just read this quote and it so stirred my heart i grabbed my book and as i as i brought it out in this sermon this morning i thought of this again i said well brother branham said well if god loves you enough to bring you out of sin how many knows he loved you that much amen he loved you enough to bring you out of sin and fill you with the holy ghost amen what's the matter with his poor spineless weaklings around the country won't he much more deliver you from your affliction when he promised he would do it god's word said so he'll do it he delivered him out of the hand amen poor spineless weaklings yeah we can't do it i can't offer him any hope so why are you preaching like this because i'm trying to change your thinking it's also been this way that way and that's the way all the raging but i'm trying to change your thinking oh yeah i know you may not believe it but i know god bless you brother john lay you may be listening some of his family listen i'm not trying to embarrass you but when he reached a crisis in his life to the point he had a nervous breakdown and he was in awful shape he come and he come and offered me his life savings to go on to church he gave his car he struck away to his son he was doing this and doing that and doing just irrational things his wife i told her i said sister marie if you need a break let me know i'll stay with him one day because he couldn't be left one thing he had confidence in me i think he had so much so much confidence she needed a little surgery and said i'll take your brother tim said he can do that surgery that's how much he believed in me he'll do it he'll take that out he believed in me that much timothy knows she called me up and said i need a sitter today i have had enough i said well bring him over and you go take the day off he can stay with me we went down to the barn and timothy was there and whatever we started just talking about some things and next thing you know he's yelling out of his head some just some irrational something screaming at the top of his voice and i just said brother john come on here with me come on we got something to do i take him over to some little garden where i had some plants to put out and i said come on i said help me put these plants out and we knelt down and as we was kneeling there when we was putting our plants and i said yeah i want them this deep and i want this much dirt on them and you know i was just talking to him and i was just trying to get in the rights find the right spirit and finally i put my arm around him as he's kneeling there and i said lord somewhere out there this man's spirit has drifted away from him and his out yonder his human spirit his mind has went from him but right now i'm reaching for that spirit and bringing it right back into this body and i'm asking for it to come back into this body right now he rose up from there a healed man his mind came back to him that's what i'm trying to do with you i'm trying to get your mind set back on calvary on what the cross did on who jesus is i'm trying to change your thinking when you look and you're thinking there is no hope i am telling you i'm not trying to tell you there is hope there is no hope now what i'm trying to tell you is my father amen he believed in hope against hope and his faith and his hope had a war and his faith won [Applause] amen he was known as the father of faith not the father of hope lord and if i can get your mind set back on calvary again hallelujah you'll become people of faith who believe in the impossible [Applause] oh yeah oh yeah that's exactly what happened the other day in the in the icu room i got enough of it and i walked in there and said satan i've had enough of this now you take your hands off of god's child i'm angry and you're going to take your hand off of my wife and her mind is coming back to her and she's well today brother madam said here's just a little ill inside it's catching her spirit and then you're projecting to her your very thought and you change your thinking and what it does and you can center on christ and from there she can go on but you got to change her way of thinking she can't change it herself she said just a world and you got to pick that up this is what brother branham said in the absoluteness report now again changing your thinking getting it back on christ because you're thinking it's hopeless i might as well give up it ain't never going to happen father abraham against hope believed in hope amen when hope was against him there was no longer any reason to hope come on there's no reason to hope a 90 year old was going to have a child and him a 100 year old come on there was no reason to hope there about but against hope he believed hallelujah faith caused him to have a different hope his mind was changed by the visitation of the angel oh hallelujah if we can get the angel christ jesus to rise in our hearts and a visitation take place you'll quit hoping and start believing stop here just a minute we should realize quote brother branham 1965 we should realize that in us has been given we who believe in jesus christ been born of his spirit filled with that quickening power and that power is in you by laying on the hands on the others like the disciples did down to the ages as absolutely healed the sick raised the dead showed vision prophecy and the very same spirit that lived among the early apostles is living in the church today working the very same things and as quick as we can realize that see no matter how much it's working you've got to recognize that and believe that it won't do one bit of good until you do believe it but the moment you believe it your troubles are ended so why are you trying to give them hope i'm not i'm trying to disturb their faith those hard and hopeless cases i'm trying to stir your faith will you start believing for the impossible that nothing is impossible with you you can overcome you can rise above you can break the cycles you don't have to continue the same path that others before set for you come on now it can be chased now this scripture came to me about three a.m in the morning the other morning when i was thinking on this just a flight of things began to come and the scripture came and i want to examine it before we close this morning and i'm not sure how i'm closing this second timothy 1 and 5. when i call to remembrance the unveined faith that is in thee which first dwelt in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice i am persuaded that in thee also wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but a power and love and of a sound mind now we often quote that by itself i want you to look at it in its context because paul is saying i often think of that genuine faith of yours a faith that first appeared in your grandmother lois then in eunice your mother and now i'm convinced it's in you as well because you have this faith i would now remind you to stir up that inner fire which god gave you at your ordination so again again i want you to see this in a little different light here was it was timothy who had a gift of faith in his life and paul said i recognize it i saw it in your grandmother i saw it in in eunice your mother and now i see it in you and so i recognize that in you lays a gift of faith but i want you to stare it up and he said because because god oh my come on now because he says god has not given us the spirit of timidity but a power and of a sound mind are you with me now he has not given you this for you to be timid with it but to put that faith forth to stir up that faith that is in you are you with me now i remind you to stir up that inner fire which god gave you and then stir up that gift of god for god has not given us a spirit of fear but a power and of love and a sound mind keep that faith ablaze god don't want us to be shy with his gifts but be bold and loving insensible this is what he was saying god does not want you to be shy with your gift you've got faith he wants you to put it to work he didn't give christ in your life for him to sleep he put christ in your life to overcome with [Music] so straight up set it ablaze yes revive god's gift his strength his zeal remember that statement wrestling between revivals i want you to know we're headed now toward another surge of the holy ghost somebody help me preach brother branham said i'm looking forward to another time 63 sermon i'm looking for a time of a break forth of the spirit of god in these last days we're now living in for another surge of the holy ghost holy spirit into the church for a rapture and faith just before it comes everything is setting right straight in order that and i believe that we're now at the time that the word shall have preeminence is somebody with me so brother branham was looking for another surge in the church i think we need to get ready for it come on we need to change our mind that we can't have revival just because the world can't have it the usa can't have it but i can have it and even like tabernacle can have it and wherever you are bright around the world in south africa asia wherever south down in australia you can have revival hallelujah again world following part 63 he said the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes stir serve yes sir to grab that church and take her in the skies exactly because see the church the word the bride and christ is ministries in the bride which is his body again let me carry you down this line just a second as i went through page by page and i've been a student of this message let me just tell you when i was a 15 year old boy preacher and some man laid his tithe in my hand i looked at that and i said that's so sacred i'll never abuse that this is from god and if i am given tithe from the people of god they will have my time i don't flip my time away every chance i get i'm looking searching asking seeking i've been going through and i went through i started in 1963. after it started with services at the time i went through it i combed it over i can show you the dates we didn't have the message when i first come in 1966 and brother branham's gone and we just got this church book at the at the meeting in shreveport we had fair few tapes we sat around as a family we read that paragraph by paragraph thank god for godly family that did that i cut my teeth reading a church aids book at 15 years old i had something to preach everybody's gone today you you're here you know you were there you were there when i when our church first started you know you know how i preached yes i was 20 when y'all came you know how i preached you know how the holy ghost fell while i was reading and preaching teaching from the church age book and i preached there i still got it in my notes right in my book i took the warning from god and there on that day drum butts floundering up and down young man television this and that something changed in his life back there my wife received the holy ghost that same day in my meeting her life has never been the same and as i was going when we finally got it where it could be in print and i had the message david momless god bless them for their work i started printing putting out i could study in chronological order i went through it it changed my thinking it changed my views it straightened me out and i got to the last sermon in 1965 and i'm hearing god say all these things that i have been sharing with you and i hear him saying these things i'm hearing him say to the prophet one thing after another about what this bride is to be and i said lord i'm coming now to the last sermon that was preached and the last words that was spoken to this age and i want to know i want to know for sure that i understood right and i get to the last sermon communion and this is what i'm sharing with you he says in the communion you know the hour will soon arise last sermon when right among us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananias and sapphira remember the hour is arriving now you just remember that god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now hallelujah let me tell you again let me as i went through and i've studied and i've come back and i and i've collected rachel you were there just there with you asked me what i was doing i took every one of those books and i had flags all through them and i went back over everything because because it was said that a lot of us don't know what god's really going to do in this end time and it challenged me and i went back and said have i missed the boat am i in the wrong way am i heading the wrong direction and i went through all of them and you come to the last one and again it jumps out at me again the hour will soon arrive when right among us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did and ananias of fire remember the hour is arriving now you just remember that see god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now now that's what god wants to do amen right now he wants to dwell among his people and show himself the same yesterday today and forever and it's not a false hope to tell those that are crippled or blind i don't care how long you've been in a situation i say let's stir up the gift of god in us and begin to believe that all things are possible to them that believe hallelujah amen is there anybody else who said that's what i want i want that revival i want to stir up that gift of god in my life i want to rise to the occasion i want an awakening complete and totally in my life i want to surrender of my heart hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen as you're standing here in the music sessions head this way brother branham said again in 1962 he said he says now he said in the church to keep the church in line with the word apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors officers of the church god sent not man called god's sin inspired men to keep the church lined up now what is it gifts of the spirit of the church not a bunch of fanaticism and oh god the last thing i want is a bunch of outbreak of azusa street nonsense and impersonation serious amen if a real church was ordained of god really filled with the holy ghost and sin would appear in the church it'd be another anonymized sapphire i'd like to walk into one see all the women and man under the power of the holy spirit if somebody had done something wrong the holy spirit would rise up and reveal it they'd have to clean up that's gifts of the spirit in the church oh god send us a church like that again in 61 backing up another year i wanted to see come to church and long to see it or walk in the back door front door wherever it is and look across the audience and see a perfect church all in order and sin couldn't stay there no spirit the spirit would call it out you see it just couldn't stay like another sapphire you couldn't do it there'd be no sin in that group see the spirit would speak it like quickly speak it like that no matter how it was how little it would be done see men and women there under the power of the holy spirit the spirit of god moving perfectly somebody done something wrong in the congregation they come quickly and confess it before the spirit got a hold of it to confess it and come tell it because they knew right then it was going to be called amen and then he went on to tell why ananiasis fire isn't called he said because they're the heaviest high payers in the church and a lot of times sin is sitting there because the pastor and the minister is afraid to call out against it we got today message girls running playing soccer and shorts that's a disgrace and it's because of backsliding in the pulpit or either that people won't listen boys and girls are allowed to wear shorts around the home it happens here backslidden parents it ain't the kids that are backslidden they ain't never got anywhere it's the parents that are backslidden a lot of times there's a backslidden mom that won't back daddy up while he's away from home that's why it's important that's why it's important that they'll be ahead of the home and there be a structure in the family and keep that family under the token it's time for men to for come to jesus meeting dad because you know men are still responsible no matter what what has happened you let your wife do something you let her cut her hair you're responsible for it and you need to come to jesus meeting amen come on styles have changed so now that that dresses are above the knees girls cutting their hair to shoulder length hey that's been preached by those who claim to be in the message teachers it's okay to cut your hair as long as it's just you know to the shoulder god of this evil age brother branham said this is 1965 just before he lives you say you said cutting hair what's that got to do brother let's just stop a man i feel somebody was in it might be on a wire somewhere a hair to a woman is an azerite vowel hairdo samson was an azerite vowel when a woman cuts off her hair she absolutely denies her nazarite vow that she is a bride to christ because that one thing she spoils the whole picture just that one day she spoils the whole picture same thing when a man wears long hair amen brother smith back there was in prison a tape got to him he was vain and proud of his long hair is that right chris remember but you heard the word preached and what happened you surrendered to the word your hair came off amen come on that's exactly right you see again here is another right vow to a woman and he said a samson was consecrated to an age and a purpose therefore he had long hair the woman that's a child of god lets her hair grow to show she is consecrated to every word of god if she cuts it off i don't care how much she dances sings is in the choir speaks in tongues runs up and down has all kinds of age society she is dead that is thus saith the lord the word of god first corinthians 14 she's denied her nazarite violence sold out to the god of this modern age she does it now shame on you lady or woman think of something to play i'll preach all day okay i will thank you i'll preach to luke because if you think having un cut hair is an option think again like some pentecostal girl said to me in the hospital when karen was in the hospital and she come in and she said well you know some of our church believes like y'all but we don't say that's in the law i said it isn't in the law paul taught that and paul said if i if a prophet or someone thinks he's spiritual let him acknowledge what i said to be the truth so let's just read it first corinthians 11 14 don't nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it's a shame to him chris that was a shame and you cut off your shame but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for harry has given to her for a covering and he's just covered it he just covered exactly what the hair was to be it was to be the covering not some wrap on your head your hair [Music] but if a man's seam if any man seem to be contentious we have no such customs neither the church of god [Music] so paul said and says he summed it all up and he said it like this all right this is how things are done in all of god's churches and that's why i said that none of you should argue about what i have said [Music] let me read it again that's how things are done in all of god's churches and that's why none of you should argue about what i have said it's undebatable case closed you say brother branham i get shut up brother brandon didn't do nothing he just said what paul said it's a bible truth but i want to tell you there's people that are getting ready for the dynamics so well brother tim i got the dynamics 15 years ago praise god hallelujah you know the holy ghost well it's time to stir it up crank up that gift of god and wake up jesus in your boat again listen to this he said what's and what shall we do with jesus called christ he said god's little flock that believes the word its mechanics is ready to it's ready for the dynamics to set it a fire with the holy ghost fear not little fluff it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom the holy ghost will strike a little church that's come out from the world women that have wears long hair nazarite to prove they're separated from the world oh i want to tell you there's a flock that believes and has the mechanics ready and ready for the dynamics to set it fire with the holy ghost hallelujah i believe we're pre-destinated for this time where where he says we're going to see a church without move that the church when it gets to its place are you ready to take your position amen then that's when philistines will go to backing up amen the shorts will go off the hair will grow down the faces will be washed cigars will be missing that's right when the church begins to get in this mighty power when they have an ananiasis of fire a few of them when you'll see that when the holy church stands together in its power positionally placed as sons of god adopted in the family of god a powerful church standing there in his glory oh that's what he's coming for hallelujah that's what he's coming for that's what he's coming for [Music] how many would say today i want that revival in me i want to be that revival i'm going to do what paul said i'm going to stir up i'm going to wake up the gift of faith that is my life where i start believing well i start believing for the impossible i've heard enough of the whales and the cries of moms and dads oh that are in such such pain cause of trouble in their home children that are mindless things that are happening [Music] and the doctors say there's no hope i'll always be this way but i'm trying to disturb your faith not your hope [Music] maybe that habit of that alcohol those trunks say it'll never break it'll never break i don't have any hope i've tried i'm trying to try to try to i have no hope i'm trying to get you to hope i'm trying to get you to believe i'm trying to get you to believe for the impossible that if god saves he can save me that he can reach right down to my dust where i am and find me and call me out and make me a real son of god amen how many feels that way this morning said i want to be a real son let him come from glory today amen come there and illuminate the light within my soul and change me in his presence i want to be different i want to be changed make me more like you jesus [Music] i can speak in other tongues right now [Music] it's right here at the surface all i have to do is let it go but for you i'm going to speak in your language [Music] there's a jesus in this boat of evening like tabernacle and that jesus is being stirred for the needs in this church and i'm believing right now that the almighty god we'll bring healing and deliverance [Music] yes i'm angry i'm angry at satan i've had enough of you satan i've had enough of your torment i've had enough of you torment god's children i hear their cries and god hears the cries and he has come down to deliver and he's right here among us this morning to bring deliverance in the mighty name of jesus and i say satan you take your hands over god's property i

real preachers be real musicians committed to god right now amen so i want to stir that jesus in my boat i want a revival in my home and i want to rededicate myself right now how many would like to rededicate yourself how many would just like to give yourself to god right now and just say i i ain't got nothing to rededicate but i want to give it i want to surrender it i want to heal myself to it i'm tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired today i want that deliverance for my life you're not impossible it's not an impossible case and i'm not giving you hope i'm faith by faith i'm speaking to you right now that there's deliverance in the name of jesus christ receive it in jesus name right now amen satan you've got to take your hands off of god's property i claim them in jesus name for the glory of god amen amen just take that moment now and you claim that you claimed it for yourself you claimed if your loved ones you raise your hand to god

space there forever repented of heart and and you know here's some time ago i guess it was october god turned his life around and he'd been showing fruits of that you know and so we thank god for those fruits that he's shown but today he wants to make everything clear and everything right amen leave nothing unturned he knows that he has done everything full requirement and of course he's been baptized before as a young man but today he comes now you know sincerely a surrender in his life to god and and say i want to walk in the newness of life that the old man is dead and i'm new in christ jesus and i'm going to walk in the newness of life brother vic the lord jesus sent me into the world to preach the gospel and he said that these signs would follow them that believe and we believe that this is one of the signs that demons would be cast out and people would be saved you know it's it takes the casting out of satan to feel one with the holy ghost amen because god won't dwell in the unclean vessel and with satan in there and of course we know the enemy has left you and you are now free to walk in the newness of life me and that god gave me that and by that testimony today he commissioned me to preach the gospel and to demonstrate his word and he said he said commissioned me to go forth and baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost and in obedience to that divine command that jesus taught us i baptize you now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord i don't know yet jesus thank you lord amen let him rejoice amen heaven
