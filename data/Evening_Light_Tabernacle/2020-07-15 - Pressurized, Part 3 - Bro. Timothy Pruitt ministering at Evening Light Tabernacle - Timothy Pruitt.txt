it father and seeing prophecy fulfilled and things around us taking place the very signs Lord of your coming or we're thankful that we can see those things Lord Lord that were not blinded by the glare of Sodom Lord but God we've had a personal visitation Lord with an angel God as called as my name and let us know who we are father what a blessed people we are tonight Lord we just want to say how much we love you and appreciate you Lord and we thank you for all that you've done for us Lord but where would we be if it wasn't for you and your grace in our lives and Lord calling the sword out of darkness into this marvelous light nor does many that's walking away there's many of this saying that ain't true there's many Lord that's maybe even sitting on the edge Lord and wondering about it but god I'm so thankful Lord and hearts tonight you've anchored it so deeply Lord that all the storms of hail could come against us we as Lord of every kind Norda blow but god we're just gonna rise above it all gonna rise above it all today Lord and we're just looking for your presence Lord to be here among us father to speak to us to touch our hearts to touch your lives Lord Lord I know there's those here today that really needs a touch from you lord or they cried out to you they asked for it father and they're needing you today we just ask that you would come by and minister we pray or there's many that couldn't be here tonight may you just touch them as well we ask it in your name for your glory and for your honor in Jesus name Amen amen let's turn in our Bibles to 1st Corinthians 15 amen is good to be in the house of the Lord as you've heard my mother was moved today to a specialized rehab facility she's thankfully not needing rehab on him on her mind or her bodily functions per se but just on strength you know from being in bed in the bed for two and a half weeks and not moving very much in that manner while we got a lot to be thankful for and just a miracle that God has done for our family and our church here amen to bring a person back from the brink of death and the doctors even not giving any hope but God who is rich in mercy amen we think the Lord for that first Corinthians 15 and verse 51 it says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory a man will let you be seated this evening like to just kind of continue on the thought have been on for the last a couple of Wednesday's on pressurized pressurized and just looking back a little bit as we been a few weeks since we spoke on this with Lord Lord just bringing some more things to a heart and just looking at this word pressurized it means to be brought to or maintained and an atmospheric pressure higher than that of the surroundings or greater than that of the surroundings and I believe there is a people that has been inoculated against the pressures of this world and there are great pressures in this world and is seemingly getting in more than seemingly it is getting worse it's the government's and things and all the things is going on if you look upon that and you and you and you feed upon that a lot and you're feeling that very much you'll become very disillusioned and very depressed about the things that's happening in this world but I'm thankful that that is not our hope that is not why we gathered here tonight to have hope in the government of the United States or have hope in this world of any sense or any form but we gathered here because we have a greater hope and that hope is the coming of the Lord Jesus and I I believe there's a people that's going to be able to stand in the most evil day there's ever been a menace that be able to stand and stand for righteousness and stand for holiness and and stand for the supernatural moving among us stand amen for the kingdom of God and able to take the pressure because there is going to be pressure against us amen you know people are looking for the squeeze that come against the bride well congratulations we're here amen and it's not going to get any better but it's going to get tighter and tighter and tighter until we just pop out of this old dimension and go to be with him amen in other words there's a power but in other words there's a power greater or higher than the power that's on the outside you know the devils want you to get your eyes on the outside and show how great he is and how how how impossible it seems or how how you know sickness may seem impossible or how great it is but you never forget the power that's on the inside of a Holy Ghost believer is greater than anything he could ever bring it's greater than any sickness he could ever put upon the Church of God is greater than any pressure he could ever put upon the Church of God amen that pressure or that Spirit of God as whether Aaron spoke about is there is a greater wind Amen there's a Holy Ghost that is greater and it has enough and it's more than enough for any situation that we could ever face and there's going to be a people that's even inoculated or pressurised against death itself amen that death is going to try to come but this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality and I believe that we're looking at a people that step in from getting ready to step from being mortal to be an immortal from being corruptible to be an in corruption amen amen I believe there's a people that's being ready and conditioned into such a place and we see the world that's being conditioned to a Tribulation their been their mind as being conditioned to drift tribulation period of tribulation amen to come upon this earth to where their minds would go so insane and that begin their imaginations run so wild and their insanity and we see the insanity of that dimension coming in this world and it's pressing upon every person it does not have a man there's not any kind of a code or any kind of a small print that says either you're white or black or red or yellow it's coming upon every person and it's coming upon every Amen male female amen they're being conformed into the image of that world at the world they underneath the world and we see there that hell is being unleashed in this hour and it's coming more and more and more into fruition in the body of people upon this earth but so as we see that that that dimension is being more fulfilled and more amen showing itself in and in the form of flesh so shall that other dimension also amen begin to show more and more of itself amen he said when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose with it Amen so if you see hell turning loose into this dimension and the insanity of the world and the mind of the devil being put upon people and you see it more and more and more you got to say Amen heaven is also turning loose that there's a people that's coming in the mind of Christ and they're getting more and more and more into his mind until they're going to take a body change amen and this is the world that we're living in we're living in a very scientific world and we're living in a time that never before amen in the seven churches is a man that never has been able to make a man take from this dimension and to move into another dimension until the time that we're living in and it's only speaking of him n is the natural say man speaks of the supernatural it's only speaking of that we are now for the first time in human history a man a man a body that's able to go from this dimension into another dimension hallelujah by the body change and so we see science has been able to prove this and they take an astronaut as saying as we spoke only sings and I want to just go for a minute and they can go forward so far till you can't even see it with their natural eyes no more and it'll go so far into the pressure of another dimension he said he can just go on out because it's me he's in a pressurized tank he can go and he can go into another place and sail around and see the world all around him he said so it is there is a spiritual age and there's a spiritual time where God is going to have spiritual astronauts and I still can't help but believe that in the middle of all this chaos and in the middle of all the struggle then the trials of life that are going on and the coronavirus and the riots and all this that in the middle of that that there would be a rocket lifts off any man I believe that's showing something to us said his brother Brennan would speak count down he would see in his age of a rocket taking place and he would say hey not only they're doing that in the scientific world but I'm telling you God is also doing that in the spiritual world and then in the middle of all this chaos around us that we'd see a rocket taking taking off a man I believe it's God just letting us know don't forget now we're on so we're on set and set and go we're ready to take off out of this so sinful world how do this okay us out of this so sickness and out of all these problems and lift into another atmosphere into another place ain't man God is going to have spiritual astronauts the Eagles of the air hallelujah the Eagles of the air that can go beyond any other birds cell over everything Oh hallelujah sale over everything spiritual astronauts that can take the Word of God and prove he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah he's going to have a people that's going to take the Word of God and prove he's the Lord God it heals all our disease that proves he's the same yesterday today and forever he's gonna have a people that's going to take the Word of God and prove he can heal her cancer where he can heal the brain bleed or he can take away depression or anxiety or her fears and they're gonna prove to the devil that greater is He that's in me and he that's in the world he's gonna have somebody that can prove he is the same today a spiritual astronaut amen amen being brought to another place amen what a wonderful thing for a spirit rostra not to know that this is not your world hallelujah I don't know about you but it makes me want to rejoice the thing that this world is not my future and my hope or what I'm putting my eggs in the basket here I'm not putting it in this world I'm not putting it in the things of this world I'm not putting it in governments I'm not putting it in anybody but Jesus Christ because I know he has the power to change it so body they need a government on this earth it has the power to change this body maybe they ain't a people upon this earth that's got the power to change this body I'm gonna put my eggs in the basket of war who rose from the dead halleluyah is alive today amen and putting the spirit and people that will believe that all things are possible [Applause] hallelujah amen for there to be an astronaut there had to be somebody who would believe there could be an astronaut that it'd be somebody that would believe and say yeah I believe if I got in that rocket I can go into another plane I had to be somebody John Glenn or any of the other ones that would say hey I believe enough to get in there more come on somebody has to be enough be enough before somebody that I believe enough to say I believe and I'm going to get in there where he said I'm the Lord God that heals all my diseases I believe it I'm going to get in there I'm going to get into the Word of God I'm gonna get into what he said hallelujah and by their belief that natural scientists achieved by man to go into another atmosphere and you can believe that but people won't say well I don't believe in God I don't believe in God I don't look but you can believe a man by his own two little orders one little pea-brain could come up with enough ideas enough drawings to take a man off of this earth and put him into another atmosphere you can believe that or even believe about a man who could hook it in his own little brain he come up with the idea of a car and you had enough belief in that man to get in that car and come to church amen you had enough belief in that man to believe in him to get in the airplane and go in the sky it took belief to get in there you believe that when you got in that airplane you're gonna get in that airplane and go to your destination why because you believe that or you wouldn't get in it I wouldn't get in it I wouldn't get in the car if I didn't believe that car is gonna start and get me to my destination I wouldn't get in that car and people's got enough faith to bless what it is is faith hey man and they can believe in man the man that has failed time after time a man that hasn't done nothing but made things work for himself yet they can't believe in a card that can come on the sea and change her life forever don't tell me you ain't no God don't tell me you ain't got any something in you to believe in a God when you can believe in a man to do those kind of things a spiritual astronaut he meant living in a spiritual age and natural men were able to achieve by natural abilities what they achieve and God is saying I need a man he'll stay with the Bible that'll stay with the Word of God and I won't stay with he's the same yesterday today and forever and not afraid of the promises regardless of what anybody else says don't you know John Glenn had enough people in his ear trying to tell him you're crazy this is impossible you're gonna die you're not going to make it back but he had enough faith to believe I'm gonna get in there and I'm coming back and I'm going into another dimension I'm going into another place amen he had enough faith to believe that no matter what anybody else said hallelujah and don't get on me when I got enough faith to believe that this body is going to change that this body is gonna come I got enough faith to believe that the dead in crisis went down on the grade they're all going to rise again hey man I got enough faith to believe that if somebody gets sick God's got enough power to heal them I got enough faith to believe that if you'll come and humble yourself and repent of your sins gonna save you I got enough faith to believe he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] here he wants you to become an astronaut that a ghosts are so far beyond denominational thinking or beyond man's thinking beyond anything else beyond they meant even beyond the things of a church but with God and him alone you know in order to be an astronaut you had to get in a tank and it was something they couldn't control themselves I mean they had a few little buttons they could push but it was something underneath them that could it could really cause some issues and it had done it but even later on you know in the eighties when they had that that one blow-up and then in the 90s when they had the other one blow-up returned to Earth there's a lot of things that could have issues with it but there was still people even beyond the issues we're still getting a rocket just a few days ago come on now and people want to say well there's issues at that church there's issues with believing there's issues with God and stuff there's a lot of issues but there's a lot of issues with man but they don't keep people from believing they don't keep people from saying yes it is possible yes we can go there amen why because they know Amen that is there and they're able to move amen they are able to push these buttons do whatever it takes taming the light diffuser light it off and into another dimension amen and so man's got enough about them to believe in that in a man-made rocket in a man-made instruments and man-made math and man-made everything man-made everything they're sitting on yet they still had enough in them to say I'm getting in it and I'm leaving here then what's wrong with the people of God saying Amen this ain't a man-made creature saying a man-made dogma this is God's Word and God said get in there he not into a church not into a person get into Jesus Christ [Applause] God wants men he'll come into Christ we're not interested in getting you to come into a church but if you come into Christ you're coming to church but that's not the goal that's not what we're interested in there's been a lot of people that set on church pews for years and where they at today we need people to come into Christ not into the message as far as the creed or a Dogma or some some idealism we told my people get into Christ you know he understand what I'm saying amen now I believe the message is Christ amen but come into him find him amen if you'll find him you won't have to worry about all the codes of this that and the other amen it'll just naturally happen on the inside of you because there's a different control tower a man but he wants somebody to believe he's the same yesterday today and forever not our own thinking and that's what a lot of people get hung up right there because you know they want their own thinking well I I just can't believe that one of maybe you can't but does that keep me from believing it oh there's a lot of people they couldn't believe anything but one day they couldn't believe he was gone either people who said I can't believe that message one day you're gonna can't believe we're gone hey man not your own thinking but moving out into space controlled not by man's Creed's or men's dogmas or man's ideas or your own ideas but controlled by the Holy Ghost oh ma Amen you know I think we're ought to be a people that gets past our closets controlling us and our ideas controlling us and what we feels right controlling us and how we feels comfortable controlling us and say God you control me I'm in your ship hey man astronauts how far it is away from the old horse and buggies and even the airplanes how far it is even from justification and sanctification and even the Baptist of the Holy Ghost the rent restoration of the gifts amen we're coming to eagles first maybe chickens lizards crows whatever but now there are Eagles no one can follow their astronauts for Jesus hallelujah amen we got people to be astronauts for the United States or astronauts for Russia how about some astronauts for Jesus let's say Lord let me get my eyes of what's going on on this world and the things around me and the problems and situations I can't control anyhow and get my eyes on Jesus Christ see even the natural one he a natural astronaut he don't leave by his own power he's fired out of there there's another force that's pushing him it's pushing him beyond all that he said that's all you have to do get into Jesus and God will do the shooting gonna do it it ain't gas line power no more it ain't some church cream it's God's atomic power that'll push you all the way out into space out under what is astronauts beyond justification sanctification amen going all the way the whole Bible hallelujah a real astronaut gets into all the promises of God he's not interested in saying what I want this one or not there's a no he's got to have all of them he knows that God is able to perform every promise he ever made hallelujah I mean if a man's got enough faith to believe this rocket it's gonna get on top he won't get on set on top of this rocket and he's gonna lift him up high enough to get out of the atmosphere of the earth into another atmosphere amen into where things are the once thought impossible or now possible once thought never would happen is now happening there was a time that it was thought that you would never leave atmosphere of this earth there was a time people actually science would even say that if a man went a certain miles an hour he'd explode didn't think it was possible to go that fast and now we're getting cars that goes beyond what they thought was possible come on that they meant an astronaut out there right now are doing things that once was thought impossible but that way it wasn't never impossible it was always possible come on I'll admit we are now receiving things in this word and things in this hour that once was thought impossible but it never was impossible it was always possible it just took somebody to believe it was possible it took somebody to say hey if this can happen for them and this can happen there and this can go here it's possible I believe it's possible pressure there's all kind of pressures that comes against us there's going to be more and more pressures and then cope in 19 is very small compared to what's coming upon this earth pressures and things that are pushing on every side amen but this but when I astronaut is in that tube he's controlled a man by radar or something that guides him to his destination a man that's a big radar you know that and pushes him to certain directions in certain places and brings him to a certain door of trajectory to reach a certain places it takes a precise moment for them to take off they can't just take off anytime they want to or decide when to push the button there's things they got to do they got to push it at a certain time so they reach a certain window so they reach a certain place to get to a certain thing it's all precise it's all in measured it's all exactly exactly to the T to try to get them to match up to this place and God has been doing this for seven thousand for 6,000 years he's been doing it for years and years and seven church ages all the way what's he doing adjusted and moving it wasn't man's power it was God's power it wasn't Martin Luther on his own decided to do what he does no it was the anointing of the Holy Ghost it was a radar that went off and said hey the just shall live by faith and I moved him over in a certain direction and I just wanted I you know Martin Luther you know I got a friend that I actually met over there in Switzerland just that randomly at a site it was it was a big wall in the wall of the Reformers and they took me there to look at it and it was this man from Singapore and I walked up to him beginning to talk to him but the David mayor was at work at the time so it was me and my wife and sister Ann and I went up to begin to speak to this man begin the witness to him begin to talk to him because I could tell he was interested in biblical things because he was there taking selfies with Martin Luther and all those ones and I'm beginning to talk to him about it and have been conversing with him even yet still a man and you know he takes me takes a picture of where Martin Luther nailed the theses on the door all the time he sent it to me God tries to go there at the anniversary of every year because he just he just really looks to martin luther in' and i've just been speaking to him about him in the reformation but now we're in the age of restoration hey man and and yes martin luther played a very important part but he went to john wesley all the way down to where we are today hey man but Martin Luther had to take a stand and he he protested it's what he did he protests that though the Roman Catholic Church in annually they want to come today and think there's the first protesters listen protests have been going on a long time ago a man because listen I believe we ought to protest we ought to protest against the aim and the formal ungodliness it tries to come in our churches and the easy believers and we ought to be protesting that well to be protesting that Amen the people to say days of miracles are passed know we didn't nail something on the door the days of miracles is here Amen we need we do need to protest against certain thing the darkness is trying to come in and take our children at you who your moms and dads want to be standing protesting against their amens the pressure that's trying to come in and take this all right now we ought to stand up against that and say look these are the days God has visited this generation and he's anointed some people not to stay here on earth not to build their own Kingdom in the old houses and old lands but it's by no native people to lift off from here and they go into another dimension we have people that gets caught up in all the things and they're getting drugged down by it but this astronaut once he gets into that chamber there's another power there that's taken over he's no longer his power John Glenn could not get himself into that place neither can you get yourself in into a body change there's another power Amen you know it was a he said brother Brennan sent like this he said he has a radar that guides him just like he guided Martin Luther just like the radar pushed down Wesley over to sanctification and radar push the Pentecostals to the places of the recent restoration of the gift there's over there still that Holy Ghost says God in the church come on now we're not under the guidance of a man we're under the guidance of the Holy Ghost we're under the guidance of thus saith the Lord we're under the guidance that God has nay he has never left us neither will he ever leave us he's still leading and God is still the same pillar of fire that that walked the children of Israel to the desert and he didn't get lost he didn't get turned around he didn't get eaten get disillusioned he led him the way that he was to lead the children of Israel neither to will he get lost he's leading us and guiding this bringing us through all this nonsense of this world into another place and there's a radar that guides this uh the spiritual astronauts it's a word that holds us it's a word that grabs ahold and says ask the Father anything in my name and I'll do it and thresher starts going forth and that prayer starts guiding you hello I'd seen prayer at work this these last couple of weeks and then ain't the first time I've seen it at work I've seen it work all my life seen prayer changed things and just in that instant and this is what he says radar the radar of the church is the prayer and the Holy Spirit that backs it up just watch the way the churches pray and you'll see the way the missile will fly did you hear that watch the way the church is praying and you'll see the way the missile will fly you can tell by the way the astronauts of track are traveling by the way the churches pray how's your prayer life it might be the reason why your missiles going down amen prayer leading you for air amen not not just not just laying down sit father thank you for this day thank you for all you've done amen no that's not the prayer God is wanting fellowship God is wanting the people that are fellowship with him that'll talk to him that he can talk to them amen God still got a voice he can still speak he's just looking for somebody say God speak to me lead me guide me I'm not oh this is not by my power I'm not here by myself I didn't bring myself here I need you Lord it´ll when you get to that place it'll lead you to all things are possible it'll lead you to Lord pour out your spirit upon the church give us what we have need up pour out your Holy Ghost take out every reasoning we believe the word is right we're going to stand right with it and he said when you begin to move into that place you'll see it begin to rise the astronaut to begin to move up going beyond what anybody says going beyond anyone anybody thinks and going into another atmosphere until an astronaut breaks the sound barrier he goes beyond the restrictions of this world he goes beyond what's going on around him amen right on through he's not it he don't even hear any of it he just moving on he's living in the presence of God his word what His Word says he's the high priest you see that great big radar sitting out there moving watch him in the meeting you can watch when the Holy Spirit comes in the form of the pillar of fire like he said he would a man's not gonna be sitting there trying to reason that was science a real believer why he's looking at a radar screen watch him he gets the point and it catches one there and that astronaut you got cancer you got so and so you're from such-and-such a place the Lord Jesus makes you well hallelujah off cells that astronaut he said all my what a church he said is being proved everywhere around us we're living in an astronaut age we're living in a place that at any moment we're gonna take one more step we're living room right now you know the little story it just touched my heart hearing it again I was a little girl that was out on the ranch she's out on the ranch and the rich young Sun came out from the east to find him a wife you know when all the sisters were there of that ranch ramrod was there his daughters was making themselves up getting ready and had a little cousin you know that was there tending the dishes and washing the clothes and making the beds and nobody ever thought anything about her nobody thought that surely if he came he's not coming for her she don't look good enough she don't have big enough place you don't have this you don't have that she looks so humble and they put on this big party in and out they go and they're just putting on the bling you know and trying to get his attention and everybody's vying for his attention but he's looking for certain character he's looking for a certain person he's looking for a certain kind of people and all of a sudden he goes out to get away from it all outside and down by the bunkhouse and he sees this little girl come out with a pail of dirty dishwater and she throws it over the fence and and he looks at her and he catches her hind he's like I wonder who that is he finds out about her and it begins to talk to her and begins to fellowship with her and he decides she's the one and he tells her look you're the one I come to marry you're going to be my bride and on this certain day I'll it's a certain time I'm coming back again amen and time went on and time went on it seemed like nothing was happening of course all them sisters made fun of her and made me in a made light of the situation but you know it came the time that there was only one year left it was only a few months left it was only a few days left there was only one day left there was only a few seconds left Oh hallelujah there was only a few moments left until she'd hear the sound of a buggy coming down the road to pick her up again and I could imagine that day was her last day of being there with all them people and them critics are making fun she came to her last day chiju she wind took that dirty dishwater and she thought it over the fence for the last time hallelujah she went and she win then went into the beds and she made the bed for the last time and she got up and she made breakfast for the last time and I'm thinking about a people it's been years he's been 40 years and 50 years we've heard that coming of the Lord and the coming of the Lord and now we get into one of years or year may be months or days but then we're gonna come to the last day how am I gonna come right to the last time we ever deal with cancer that we ever deal with high blood pressure and we ever deal with any demon of depression or anxiety on our children we're coming to the last day and we're gonna throw it over the fence one last time and then all of a sudden we put in the clothes of the word old and we're gettin their self ready and we hear the sound hallelujah what do you think those astronauts are feeling all of a sudden they feel all of a sudden they know it's my time to lift off of here Oh hallelujah I hear the sound in the mulberry tree it's the sound of not staying it's not a sound of occupied it's not a sound of the things that's going on I hear the wind of the Holy Ghost moving in a heart believe in all things are possible believe in the days of miracles were here believe in healing is here deliverance for God come on Sal don't let them revolution Amen to believe in that all things are possible well hallelujah amen this might be your last day ten men to deal with anxieties and fears and depression this might be the last service I don't hear a sound of a stair as the Bible said is David there in the mulberry bush he heard a sound of a goin well hallelujah hallelujah glory to car the world is worried about the following Kaiser and the stock markets and this and the other and their kingdoms they built they're all crumbling around them and they worried about how am I gonna make it how am I gonna stay there how am I going to keep this I'm a little I'm not worried about it I'm not staying here I'm leaving here and there's the people that hears the sound of the buggy coming down the road the Holy Ghost moving in the Church of God it's not moving with less power it's moving with greater power it's not moving with less miracles it's moving with more miracles it's not moving with less healings it's moving with more healings until the greatest miracle that ever hit this earth it's gonna be the change of this whole body hallelujah and we go home did you meet him in the sky and that is beyond the reasoning a man there's someone here even tonight saying that ain't possible you can believe that I refuse no will be transformed there's men in the grave right now you couldn't find maybe a spoonful of ash but that's not gonna keep it from hell you said how did you know the Bible teaching you here oh I don't know if I can believe the Bible is written by man well you can believe every kind of nonsense written by man I get amazed by people so I can't believe the Bible was written by man but that gum down seeing in they've gone down their old worldly things that all the things they're doing and it's written by inspired by Devils I'll try believing something may be written on paper by men but inspired by God you say well I tell you what we gonna do ain't no into there sing no in this world you're gonna close your eyes and it's gonna be finished it's just gonna be over to big blackness you'll not know nothing it'll be done you believe that if you want to I happen to believe we're sent an eagle here in this age that told us what's over there and there's nothing indication behind this eagle to believe him it's like I told her how a theist one time young man used to believe this message talking to him just visiting and and and and just thinking on these things and I don't think I've told this before but you know he said what are you just gonna close your eyes and there's not gonna be nothing I said okay great I close my eyes and there's nothing whatever lost I've had a good life tell you what I had I had a wife that wouldn't run out on me had children that would obey and do the things right and amen be good to people and good citizens and have a love for people that's what I have I have a church that loves each other and and people that love each other and care for each other what do you guys as if illicit this flipped the script just a little bit what if we close our eyes and there is something to this afterlife there what do you have think about it what are you gonna have if Oh foggy Timothy knows what he's talking about if this whole fogey Bible knows what he's told what are you going to have and what have you missed and what are you going to miss but he has come in this hour he brought such a revelation and vindication in this hour to put stability in our hearts to make a stable in an instable hour a mental over to where we can have enough stability in our heart to believe in the miraculous to believe in things that were once thought impossible by man but we're always possible by God amen stab it listen it didn't just all of a sudden become possible by God it's always been possible but now there's people that believes it to be possible a stability are having a straight turning door he said what a man once catches a vision of an invisible God and knows he's always present hello I know the devil's got her minds on Quran coronaviruses always prison and rights are always present and evil is always present and that's all we all were put in front of our faces if you look at those things out there it's constantly evil evil evil and it puts out the persona that everything evil is always present but if you can catch a vision of an invisible God and know he is always present oh he's always present amen he's there in every situation he's there in every problem he's there when you've lost loved ones he's down when you when you're down to your last minute or your last piece of money or your last food he's there he's always there and then that when you realize that something stabilizes a man's thinking and this is what we see people that's unstable because they've been feeding on the wrong things and they've become unstable because evil it's always present and this is always present and that's always present and it is in their thinking becomes unstable it in stabilized when you realize God is present right now just think that and I believe it do more than think it believe it God is present right now I told y'all the other day when I was sitting in my chair lift me and my boy I've been reading the Bible and things together and we got down to pray and I used that phrase whatever we biting spraying about my mom whatever we bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever we loose on earth to be loosed in heaven and it just struck me go back and read that again and I went back and read it and realized it was directly tied to a question who do you say that I am if you can say he's present if you can say he's here not because my senses declares he's here but his words said he's here if you can believe that then all things are possible to you Peter hallelujah and that went when I were when I realized I have to I must believe he's present right now he's not just a God of of Elijah or a god of Moses and the good stories and good things to pull straight from yes but he's not just you know the devil sent way there back there but not here yeah and Peter's day but not here Paul's day but not here brother branham's David not here but when you realize the same God that was here it stabilizes your thinking it stabilizes your actions it stabilizes everything about you and it makes you look out port it turns your eyes on him instead of the problems it turns your eyes on the unseen instead of what you can see and what we can see your very dark and very bleak but if we can look to the unseen we could have a little glimpse tonight with Johnny he ain't fightin along sister Teresa not fighting alone we're not here by ourselves none of you are here by yourself he's here and when God arises his enemies are scattered when God comes on the scene brain bleeds have to push back cancer has to flee God's moving in impossible situations God doing the miraculous it stabilizes your thinking this is what's wrong with people they haven't caught a glimpse of the unseen because of them people out there doing what they're doing right now and the people of this world can catch a glimpse of what's anointing them Lord and mercy they can really see what is pushing them and their ideas and their thinking it was push the driving force behind them they can't see what's there they think that's my own thoughts it's not your own thoughts it's a spirit behind that it's a spirit moving in the realms of this world and political and this idea it's spirits but if the spirits of Hell being push people in the places where they are today and it pushed Sodom where they were and it pushed thought where he was but Abraham there was another spirit it was a stronger wind it was something else it was a visitation of that angel that stabilizes thinking instead of 50 righteous Lord Savior if forty or righteous Savior 10 what was it was stabilizing his thinking in time of distress in troubles if you can catch a vision of the invisible God knowing he's always present it'll stabilize your thinking he goes on he says you see when you look with these eyes this is in now 58 so imagine we'll read today he said you look with your eyes and you see now nations are shaking and trembling war clouds are flying everywhere every nation is under distress perplexities of time every sign that jesus said would happen is happening there would be signs in the heavens above and the earth below and great things would be taking place flying saucers mystic things taking place but in those times he commanded his church to lift up their heads in the day to look up for the unseen Christ will be appearing very soon when you do it when you catch that glimpse it makes you think things you wouldn't ordinarily think it makes you a man wouldn't ordinary thing it makes you people do things that normal man when ordinary do it made Paul do things it wasn't ordinary Moses did things that he wasn't think in his own mind to do but he caught a glimpse of the unseen he caught a glimpse of something else around him more than what was there the desert the bush is this he caught a glimpse of the unseen the fire of God that could come down and it stabilized it's a stabilizer it's like a anchor in the ship it's a ship when the ship is tied to an anchor in the time of storm it holds it there in this place no matter how big the winds or how big the waves it holds it there and he said if Christ is your absolute and you're tied to him in the time of trouble the ship yep it'll rock it'll break if it gets to the rocks it'll break if it gets over there and the problems in this situation but you hung on to that anchor and let that anchor hang on to here it's your absolute in a born-again Christian is tied to Christ and the Bible as his anchor it's the thing tied to let organizations let different things science educators say what they want to but as long as that word says it I'm tied to it hallelujah and I'm not moving from it no matter what anybody else says and this is probably one of my favorite quotes in Christ as revealed in his own word in 65 something that just brings peace and mom in my store he says the stabilisers have been put on the ship oh yeah great fearful waves are out there before us we know but just beyond that way that last wave we're nearing the shore just stay stable just stay in the word no matter how you feel stay in the word stay stable when you see those great big old clouds around us storms rising atomic bombs everything they're talking about but our stabilizer is right in the word God said it would be and we will crash every wave that shouting ground right there you need to look at that that wave has been coming against you as I'm about to crest you I'm about to come over the top of you because I've been stabilized in the Word of God and upon this rock this revelation and he is now present I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it oh it'll be against it it'll come it'll blow it'll hit a hack at the doors it'll push against the old well old rugged wood of the cross but them stabilizers are still holding hey man things are coming and we're rising above it all go right over the top of them it can't sink us Oh hallelujah the devil's been telling you he's gonna sink unit looking back and say you can't sink me cuz I'm not the one holding me to sink me you got to sink him to defeat me you got to defeat him and he done proved you are a defeated foe hallelujah they can't sink us they can Travis you can put us in the gara grave we're gonna come out again that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it from coming to pass or keep it down there we will crest every one of them because our great chief captain is calling on the other side we're anchored in Jesus the storms of life will break I'm a Kurd in Jesus I'll fear no wind away whatever it might be let it come whatever manner whatever the world doesn't make any difference we're anchored in Jesus Christ pressurized but it takes the inoculation of the Holy Ghost to keep saying in the insane hour you see people that's run this race for many years are cracking under the pressure they're cracking under the pressure of critics and turning away from this glorious truth they're cracking under the pressure of the world and the political spirits and they're turning away from this glorious truth and they think well I'm just turning away from my idea no you're turning away from Christ listen this pressure this cuts in this world is to only get greater and greater and greater until all hell comes into this place till the man himself comes and incarnates himself the man of sin comes in and coordinates himself in a man and you're talking about pressure I'm not gonna be here there's in a way there's a sound of a going that's taking place there's a people getting ready to leave here and let me just say it very plainly and very bluntly when this bride leaves here all hail is turning loose it will have its full sway and his full way but right now you got a way of escape somebody showed me a video earlier out sometime this week of a man ministering on Hale has no exit once you get there there's no leaving but what you can exit there is a way of escape there is a way called the way of righteousness but you can leave it you don't have to go down with that thing it exit get up and leave I'm not I'm not going there I'm not going down on defeat I I'm not I'm not bowing down to this thing listen but the pressure that's coming upon this earth this is only a foretaste and you can't run far enough in the woods because go get away from this pressure I know people got the ideas well I'm gonna get off the grid I'm gonna get out there by myself nobody knows where I'm at but Lonnie they got a GPS thing that'll come right on top of your house and they know what you are they know what you will be they know everything about you seems like and you think it's this bad now just wait freedoms are being rolled away one by one things are being moved into this place one by one it's setting itself up for the Tribulation Period and there is a tribulation coming but there's also a leaving an exit there's a way to get out of here this whole world's about to burn but there's a way to get out of here this world's going down into hell but there's a way to get out of here there's an exit there's a way of escape there is an inoculation you can't sink inwardly enough and become so inward and so so drawn into yourself to get away from this pressure it's going to have to take an inoculation it's going to have to be something that come up on the heart that a pressure you for a pressurized age then I pressurize you that the pressure on the inside is greater than the pressure on the outside therefore it keeps what's on the outside from coming on the inside hallelujah that's why I said the gates of Hell will not prevail up against it because Peter you're gonna go to the day of Pentecost and you're gonna read you're gonna read the Spirit of God is gonna be unleashed to pull my people and you're gonna come out of there like a drunk man but you're not gonna be the same no more you went in there liar you went in there deceiver you went in there cursor you went in there denier but you're going to come out and you're gonna stand for me why because I got an inoculation that I hope I got something to rise above ever hell that come to ever Dart they come from Hell every kind of spirit that comes against you I got something greater I got something more powerful I got something a hope in the time of death it'll hold so much you'll go down but it'll bring you back up again and ain't no hell can stop it they can put guards around they can put it I sold over they can do what it roll to with the word done been spoke the words Dunn's been spoke Amen I'll show you a mystery will not all sleep but we all shall be changed there's a body change coming there is a people in a moment in a twinkling of I one day their own the next step they're young again Oh hallelujah one day they're decrepit and the next moment they're running on the streets we'll all go one day that kateharland walking it's and they're running a mile pressurise and the dead shall be raised we ain't lost one of our loved ones we ain't lost a woman and we're not losing a one he said all the father has given me that'll pressurize you if you can believe his words tonight it'll pressurize you God's got it I don't know how he's got it but he's got it when that happened to my mom a couple of weeks ago it struck my heart God's got this I don't know how he's got it but he's got it he saw this wave coming before we ever got here and he's got the answer and he answered but it'll keep you in the moment of temptation man vitals sure he tried to come to our minds I wouldn't visit her last Monday a week ago left there you think he came to my mind after sure he did tried to tell me I'd never have my mom back in their normal kept at capacities tried to tell me that it'd be impossible for her to do just simple things try to tell me she'd never talked like herself again tried to tell me all kinds of stuff lion-o devil he don't have the final say but you have to constantly pull those thoughts down no that's not my thought and that's not God's thought I said old devil talking again pull it down and say God by your stripes she's healed I don't know how you got it but you got it I don't know how you're gonna do it but you're gonna do it I don't know how in the wild world this is gonna work out but you are the one in control and I'm leaving it in your hands because I can't do nothing with it in my hands but in his hands a little boy with those five fish in his hands that with nothing but in God's hand to get feed 5,000 hallelujah amen in his hang your hands you may not better do nothing but if you put it in his hands he'll open up the Red Sea he'll make a way worse seems impossible he's good at listening in our hands this rocket ain't leavin but in his hands it can help believe it's got a predestinate a moment for a predestinated trajectory to meet a predestinated place the meeting in the air but Mike texted me sometimes during that he said you get ready he said God has moved and he said it's about to snowball that's was work it's about it's only going to snowball and I have to say from one it wouldn't 1
