today as well also we have brother Joel C he's uh brother Danny steaman's brother-in-law attends church there brother Danny's he'll here some time ago he had a mass they found had some issues went to the hospital and found a mass on his colon they removed it it was cancerous and they felt like they got all of it but the other day he went for a colonoscopy and they found more cancer than his colon

brother Joel C and just continue to remember him in prayer how many would have a need you to make known to the Lord amen my brother Aaron's going to come and take these knees before the Lord just remember this coming week he's going to make a few announcements about it but we have the the Ohio camp coming up me and sister Ruth are actually flying out today this evening so that's the Lord for traveling mercies but also for his mind we need his mind because you know Satan is putting out his mind out onto the world and so to battle that we have to have the mind of Christ and so we want the mind of Christ to come and take over the meetings and and the right words to be said because our young people need victories and we're looking for great victories and and I say our young people yes the young people at this church but young people all over the world and so we just asked God to come brother Ron Spencer brother Andrew Spencer will be there as well so just be remember those meetings

to be in the house of the Lord this morning we certainly appreciate the Lord and all that he's done for us and amen well praise the Lord looks like Oklahoma has moved here I hope to goodness you know you didn't come here thinking it was cooler weather down here it isn't I think sometimes you know hell is moved here and we're pushing it back amen so may God help us today and bless you all in his presence amen and I tell you uh next next um Sunday of course our young people will gone be gone and those us with them so you know we we are going to let them go up into Ohio and sponsored them to go that way and we're really happy that they're going to be a part of those meetings and I want you to be in prayer for them it's going to be really important you hold them up in prayer maybe someone that you've seen that that you know needs a closer walk with God or is struggling or maybe got a situation in their life you just take that person on your heart and pray for them this week amen it would certainly be appreciative amen God bless you thank you let's turn to Romans chapter 9 and verse 27 we got a wonderful day ahead for us where we're going to be having our our time of of um the word this morning and then then the the communion and the the foot washing that we will have and we will then have our fellowship meal together or we can just Fellowship together so it's just going to be a great time in the Lord and um so let's turn to Romans chapter 9 verse 27 Isaiah's also cried concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a Remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth and as Isaiah said before except the Lord of this sabbath hath left to succeed we have been as sodama and been made like unto Gomorrah amen may God bless you can be seated got a little thought this morning that I want to press upon your hearts today of possessing the land of promise and so we're going to be looking at that as I believe that we're a people in one of the greatest ages that there's ever been and it's a it's the age of the Rapture where we transcend dimensions and go into the Realms of the Supernatural and so to do that we of course have to be a supernatural people a super race as we near him and of course as brother Branham told us in how can I overcome he he talked about how the Realms are already blending and he said we see this age that we live in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages this laodicean church AIDS is the grandest of all the church ages because it is the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there was has ever been and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight than it was in any other in any AIDS here so you see it's a time where the blending of times or the blending of Realms where the creatures of time enter into eternity and then it that calls of course for a supernatural people a people who have more than the mechanics more than the Theology of the word in right Doctrine but also the Dynamics certainly the the mechanics must be in order that's true you know the the the truths of the word had to be restored and the correct doctrines put in place and there is certainly in a great importance that we place upon that because we must be correct on the word of God and so but the mechanics must be in order just like a a rocket just leaving the Earth and enter into Heaven's atmosphere that without the mechanical Parts being in order to the rocket itself would never launch but it takes the Dynamics then to come with the mechanics and push it from the Earth's atmosphere into the heavens now the world is in a race in one age we have moved from the snail pace of of horse and buggy and um we have come now to where that mind moves into Realms of outer space propelled by fire and lifted by air and unseen Force man travels Beyond his ability across the the globe and and and then into the other Realms Beyond this this um atmosphere of the earth and it's a natural types of spiritual that we too should also be working in the Supernatural Realm and lifted by the spirit an unseen Force into Realms um Eternal and so we where we will meet Christ in the air you know it will rise to meet him lifted by the holy spirit leaving the Earthbound Realms and and the life of sin and shame and the Troubles of this Earth I'll tell you what it's going to be a wonderful day when it's all over and this of course says we speaking about this land the promise I want you to say that we are a blessed people today because we have returned to the land the promise yet it's not without opposition because this is a populated land like the Israelites found filled with Canaanites and amorites and Hittites and jebusites it was it was already others that had camped down upon there but God had said to them their time was up amen and I want to just say it's the time is up for sin the time is up for the wickedness of this world the time is up for the devil in his Reign we're living in a time where God has declared the iniquity of the Amorite is full amen it's time now you know to lift the bride out of here and take her into her possession and pour out the wraths upon the Earth so we're we're here in a wonderful moment in time we're blessed to be here of all ages now as I said this land promised to us is also inhabited with demon powers to resist us and that must be conquered but we battle against unseen forces of demonic Powers whose job is to keep us from that Heavenly atmosphere of Faith where all things are possible so you see Satan in his army is to is there to beat you down pointing out your human flaws your human failures trying to get you to ignore the real work that is done in your soul he's always haunting you with memories of your past trying to to cower you down where did you you can't possess all that God has called you to be so the devil will do everything he can to try to to destroy you he's a thief he comes to Rob and to kill and destroy and there when he comes there he comes there and he'll point out your human flaws your human weaknesses he'll do everything he can to disqualify you and say you have no right to this land and your position in the land you see the devil he will work overtime to do that are you with me amen because that's his work and so this is the most greatest sinful age is more sin in this age than that there ever has been and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight than it ever was in any other age so you see there it is it is a wicked age it's a horrible age that we're living in demon powers coming against even more the Bible said in the Book of Revelation that has been released into this Dimension to come against us in this day and and so you see he is there because he does not want you to possess the promises of God he wants to keep you see you know thinking with a slave mentality where that you are still in bondage where you you're still having to bow to Satan and you still are expecting his whips and his beatings and everything else but you see I want you to know he's there with the opposition but I want you to know you've got a job to do because there's still a lot more land for you to conquer and there's still a whole much more you got to take back from the enemy that the enemy has stolen from you you've got to take your inheritance amen now what rule what Canaan represents you see is the Holy Ghost in his fullness so when we're talking about the lamb the promise we're talking about the fullness of the Holy Ghost so again that's what his fullness means or what it means you know Canaan represents the Holy Ghost in his fullness and I want you to know it's in reach of all who wants it it's in reach of all who wants it now you say fullness brother Tim what do you what do you mean I I mean that there's still much more to be conquered and let me say you know the you know there is there's much in this land I will we can say oh there's many gifts of the Spirit they're speaking of the tongues in this land of the Holy Ghost but that's only a gift and many people will stop there amen the ensues of Street movement claim to have fully entered into the Holy Ghost but they only just barely tapped into the anointing and I want you to know the whole land lays before you I want you to know every promise of God's word lays in front of you not just one or two you don't have to cherry pick you can have you you don't have to ration it hey man you just don't have to take part and leave some and take some and leave some no you it's all there for you I want you to understand you know it's there it's unpatter resources things that you have not yet experienced in God that he wants you to experience you know again there's many things in that land for example Holiness in our behavior and dresses there but many have stopped just being sanctified and then then you then others will say but it's the word but they tell me story if the water finished and the seals are open and the fullness of the word has come and yes and that means every Divine promise of God Is Ours that's what that means now just as Jericho had to be conquered and and its walls torn down as they were holding back and sealing back the the rest of the land do you see the walled off mysteries of God had to be restored and and and so it had to be broken down the seals had to be open the mysteries of God had to be revealed in this age but that was just to open up the rest of the promises Jericho is in all that we want to conquer there's a town of AI there's other towns you know that that has to be taken and we cannot be just satisfied with knowing the Theology of the Mysteries and leave of faith and working of Miracles and Divine Healing and overcoming power you see now when we're talking about this let's understand what we're possessing Israel was going into their Promised Land and and as they were going into that land that land lay before them was Canaan and and that they were taking a physical land but now for us Canaan does not represent somewhere in the distant future in the millennium but it represents the age of the overcomer now because in Canaan they killed they burned cities that you know they um they conquered but there's not going to be any death in the millennium so you see it it isn't that but it doesn't but what it is it is it represents the Holy Ghost and all the spirit of God decrees for the believer so every promise of God belongs to you now and it's laying before you for the taking amen whatever it is it's laying before you for the taking and God wants it possessed God has declared go take the lamb now and of course it shows where the churches come like Israel did in the same way as a justification by faith when they believe Moses and left Egypt and then sanctification along the line of of the pillar of fire and the atonement of the sacrificial lamb in the in the wilderness but then entering in to the promised land and I want you to know now in one sense every age has entered into its portion but I want you to understand no other age has stood where we stand we're living in a time to possess it all this is where we're at amen a time where every promise even the rapture all the way to the Rapture the change of your body is authority to you it lays right before you now so what is what is the New Testament what is the land promised to New Testament Believers it's the Holy Spirit for you said in Joel 28 that they'll come to pass in the last day I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh amen your sons and your daughters have prophesying on my hands made my man's servants my maidservants will I pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy also wonders in the heavens above and in the earth beneath and pillars of fire and smoke and vapor and there and Peter would would declare this is that on the day of Pentecost when he when he proclaimed repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins to take back all the trespasses and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now so there were three stages of this journey that Israel was taken three stages we're justified by faith Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ forsaken the land of Egypt sin and all of it leaving behind us Sanctified to the offering of his blood and washed from our sins becoming pilgrims and sojourners and claiming we're seeking a land a city that's coming our promise but I want you to know that's still the wilderness and what if you're there you're just still on your journey you're headed the right direction you've left Egypt you've been justified by faith you believed on the Lord Jesus Christ you proclaim the message is true you set out on a journey but you're not there the Wilderness was never given to them for them to live in it was given them to pass through and God wants you to pass through justification and pass through sanctification and enter into the land of promise now that's what God wants for you he has a land prepared and you can't stay in the wilderness now there may be more wonderful things and experiences that happens in the wilderness Journey you may get an angel's bread come down from heaven you may get water from a rock you may be baptized in the Red Sea you may you may have wonderful experiences there amen but that's not what you're to dwell and that's what happens to a lot of people is they stop right there and they don't go all the way into the full possession now so Israel in the wilderness so generous they were not to rest there you know stay there they would travel day after day following the pillar of fire but they've finally come to the promised land where they will settle down in other words possess the full promise the full promise of the Holy Ghost remember we're not going to a physical land we're going to a spiritual land and that land is the Holy Ghost now and let me just say when you go beyond the curtain of time it's just more of the same amen you enter into Divine love which is the Holy Ghost so everything that is possessed but by for the believer what God wants you to have is to be filled with the spirit amen now so this this uh land that they they could look as they would arrive there and say you know we have come to the where Abraham walked we're here where Isaac was here and Jacob there poured oil upon the stone here and saw a ladder come down here or what this is a place where Israel Jacob became Israel and and the twelve Sons were born This Is Our Land this is our ancient land and we're coming back to possess it and whether you know they can say it I want to walk where Abraham walked I want to Journey down to Gere or I want to go over here to this place I I want to worship on this mountain there I want to do that I want to possess everything that they have I want to be where Jacob you know as I said saw the latter come down from heaven I want to be there in this land now but this ancient land of the Holy Ghost that we have returned to is where Jesus trod amen where the Holy Spirit fell where Paul preached were the principles of the word were given and we have returned back to the land so we can get back in the same position Paul was Peter was Jesus was back to the original gospel and that's why we have returned it's our land but well now we've been out of it for seven churches seven Church ages but we're coming here for a reason because we've got to come back to this land of the Holy Ghost to receive the Messiah Jesus has got to come back for a people amen well I think about it when when uh when um Caleb said give me this mountain what's he went with his own Mountain well how come he wants that well you know those big giants on it all of that is dairy and Hebron and there there is there at the foot of this mountain is a graveyard what's so important about this graveyard why do we want this graveyard well Abraham was buried there and Isaac was buried there and Jacob was buried there and we're going to bring Joseph's bones back and be buried in the Promised Land so why do we want why do why do want this so graveyard Army where job was buried right here in this Promised Land are you with me amen so again he said because I saw a vision and I know that my redeemer lives and in the last day he'll stand upon the Earth and I want to be buried where he comes so the rest of them were buried down and so Caleb said give me this now there's Giants on it and I want you to know there's Giants on the resurrection there's Giants standing on your body change there is Giants standing on the Rapture doing everything he can to keep you back from your inheritance but the reason we're coming back to this land is not just to possess it and have a good church called the evening like Tabernacle we want to come back to this lamb to welcome back Jesus Christ to the Earth amen give me a little more sound up here now this ancient land of the Holy Ghost as I said that we have returned to is where Jesus trod where Jesus left and ascended and where the Holy Ghost fell where Paul preached now and I want you to know that this journey into this land Begins for all of us if you know that where we come we leave Egypt behind us we start following the pillar of Fire we start out you know with a justification by faith I believe the land is for me I'm an Israelite I'm not just a slave I'm not going to stay down here and be a slave to the devil the rest of my life I'm not going to push drugs and alcohol and sex sins that would ruin my life it's it's made a slave out of me but that's not who I am that's who the devil tried to make of who I am I'm a child of the most high God and I'm going to go to where where that place where it's our land where we're not slaves we're freedom rings well I can have my own place my own house raise my own family raise virgin daughters and virgin Sons come on this is what I want to do I want a holy place and be a holy nation and A peculiar people so you start out on this journey you know where that you're you come separated by the Washings of the water by the word Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and then being justified by faith you become a partaker in your peace with at God through Christ and you baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh you know to and that that that sets you out on your journey I want you to know many times people will stop there I believed and I was baptized and that's the end of the journey that's not where that's not where you were to arrive at you're still out in the wilderness it's a stage and a step toward the promise but you haven't received the promise now so again as you're looking there you're you're headed toward a promise that God made and what was the promise that God made he made you a promise of the Holy Ghost and all its properties to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call now once believe in the message except in the pardon and forgiveness of sin you've started a journey amen but your journey is not complete till you get to the land and then that land is the land of the Holy Ghost now in the in the message adoption brother Bradham speaks of this give me another microphone this this one is um I feel like it's not not carrying it so get me another microphone Timothy said get comfortable how many here to have church amen let's go forward then it sounds better thank you anyway Israel you know I had not received the promise getting out into the Wilderness just leaving Egypt wasn't enough you see they were on a journey and that's where that we've seen other others who have started out in the past in these seven churches we we've seen like Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness and all of them fell because you know they they didn't go all the way into the promise say they just built a camp out in the wilderness and because Israel when they came to the came to the place of cadius barnia and I've got a lot of things to say about that wave I don't get to it today I'll get to it but but when the spies came over and said the land is great and they brought back evidence but there was others that went and said we can't take it but Joshua and Caleb they stood out and said but we're more than able to take it God gave us a promise we can have this we can have what God said it is our promise This Is Our Land well but we didn't realize it would go on you know there was that was all of this and they were just happy with their twos works of Grace of justification and sanctification and they wouldn't move any farther how many people sit right there even on message pews that they've gone through repentance and baptism and done those kind of works but that never went on to real experience to going into the lion and discovered all the promises that lays in that land now as we're looking at instead of people going home brother Bradham said receiving the Holy Ghost and I'm quoting him speaking with tongues receiving the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost signs wonders and miracles they felt like it would break down their tradition of Doctrine so you see Pilgrim holiness and these moves of methodism wouldn't go any further that looked right at the promised land and said we cannot take it and we must never stop at justification or sanctification but we must go on into the fullness of God you know don't stop it just believe it on the Lord Jesus Christ and being baptized I've been just saying I believe the message and so that that is the Holy Ghost no that is not the Holy Ghost that's just being able to read that you're intellects that you think wealth in a mental ascent that's not the Holy Ghost amen you said well the evidence is believe in the word yeah you believe the word that says repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promises to you so yeah you will believe the word and when you believe the whole word of God that said repent be baptized or receive the holy ghost that entitles you to the token that entitles you to the land now but you know we must stop we must not stop because he cleaned us up from sin but we're pressed on to a position a position in the Holy Ghost and take in our place in that land now you see that's our adoption that's ours that's spiritual maturity receiving the Holy Ghost and coming into the fullness of its promise as he just mentioned speaking with tongues receiving the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost signs wonders and miracles with baptism after baptism until we're changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye now I don't know what people think we are entering into so well adoption brother Tim for maturity well that's the token that's the Holy Ghost that's the promised land and that promised land is the Holy Ghost now in 1961 on February the 11th there was a man came to brother Branham by the name of Danny Henry it was in a Full Gospel business meeting and brother Branham had just preached and this man came up and sort of embarrassed him you know because he grabbed him and hugged him and and said brother Branham said you know that could be the the 20th 23rd chapter of Revelation which there's not many that many chapters so that would be a an addition to the Bible and so you know brother Branham you know said no I just tried to preach what was in the Bible but this man was all excited you know because of of what he had heard and and how it had blessed him he wasn't criticizing but and so as he as he did the Holy Spirit fell upon him and he began to speak in French and he didn't know French but there were three at least three witnesses there who were French that did write down what he said so they interpreted they heard what he had said in the French language because they were as french-speaking people and it said because thou has chosen the Narrow Path because I had chosen to narrow path the harder way thou has walked of thine own choosing and brother Branham as he's looking at this he says you know he says um you you've got to make choices yourself Moses had had made his own choice and he didn't have to do it be and neither did I have to take this path he said I could add big buildings out yonder like some of them's got I could have a vehicle all across the television who would sponsor me when I'm tearing down the very Foundation but one thing I don't have to bow down to nobody's feet but the Lord Jesus Christ is right yes I preached what the Bible says I don't have to compromise with their organization because I belong to them I made the choice and you know that's the same thing with you you've got to make a choice it lays in the lap of every person this morning where are you going what what will you stay where you're at or you just Camp down where you are are you willing to go on into the fullness of the promise there is more for you than what you've experienced there's more for you than what you got say my brother Tim we're in the land Hallelujah we got the Holy Ghost and there's more of that Holy Ghost to be experienced until you are changed but people get happy where they're at and they want they will Camp down at one place and and they won't even fight to help somebody else get where they're going you know I've heard people say you know say in brag that they were so mature they didn't have to go to church it was only for the babies well if you're so mature then how come you're not giving birth to babies how come you're not out out there helping the babies mature and to grow in the Lord if you're so mature I'll tell you what you become is Granny grump amen you're way past Baron you're way you're way past value for anything time for you to cross over and get on over somewhere else because you're no value at all anymore we move on into God come on I'm not talking about because you're a certain age I'm talking about spiritual conditions amen so you see again you know you again in this land we can preach what the word sells we can believe what the word says we can experience what the word says we don't have to bow down to some system of man so brother said I was given he said I was given two signs he said of confirmation like Moses and he said so you know he said Moses had to make his choice and that's easy to understand because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way that has walked of your own choosing you see a lot of this God don't make the decision for you and nobody else can you can sit in your Molly grubs all you want to and nobody can get you out of them you can sit there and feel sorry for yourself and you know why if you were in a bar you'd be down in your beer you know what because why because and nobody can help you you've got to get up and get out of that yourself amen nobody else can deliver you out of it you've got to do some fighting this land is worth fighting for the promises of God are worth fighting for your marriage is worth fighting for your children are worth fighting for come on now amen the power of God in the churches worth fighting for a holy ghost meeting is worth fighting for and it's a bike it's not going to just be handed to you on the silver platter you've got to choose you got to make a choice you got to make a choice in this service whether or not you're going to go further with God or whether you're going to try to remain the same and slide back I heard now this man was speaking in this French language and then the interpretation said thou has walked of your own chosen but thou hast thou Hast picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way amen if you're going to make a choice would you like God to say about you you did my way amen You Came the way of the word you did what the word said you obeyed what the word said well God won't give me the Holy Ghost brother Tim well if you'll obey what he said he will otherwise it makes God a liar God said if you'd repent you turn from your sins you would be baptized in the name he'd give it to you he says well I hadn't got it yet well you still hadn't repented it there's still something wrong in your repentance amen he's sitting there dawdling around and just saying well it's got to just be God if he wants to give it to me he'll have to give it to me that's Cain's attitude this is the best I got take it or leave it that was Cain amen now so he goes on to say he says he said to our house because thou has picked the correct and precise decision is my way and because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven Waits thee and and of course you know he said that then he goes on himself that say that this in itself will give and make to come to pass their tremendous victory in the love divine so what in the world does that mean you see Divine love is the Holy Ghost brother Bradham referring to this and standing in the Gap he said now in the love divine Divine love how can that be divine love if it isn't the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is divine love so he said I'm not giving you a greater portion in heaven and so you're going to have more than everybody else but I'm going to give you a person because of your decision I'm going to give you a portion of Greater portion in the Holy Ghost amen so that tremendous portion and the love divine is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the Lamb which we have entered we have arrived and for the seventh angel messenger that was a tremendous victory for him and for all of us because again it wasn't a big portion of Heaven up there but no it was a greater portion of the Holy Ghost given to this age so that the Seven Seals the mysteries of God would be open to us so that would end open up the entire word of God every promise of God and he said this in this tremendous victory in the Divine love so you know in the Holy Ghost now without a vision or aware that he saw himself looking there and he saw a map of Palestine and there as if he's coming down to to down the the map that he was standing on he said I'd come two-thirds of the way and we had come to the Jordan and he said praise God on the other side is where all the promises lay now I want you to understand you know the message of Luther did not bring us into the Promised Land the method method the Methodist message did not bring us into the promised land it was a step closer and Azusa Street got close enough to speak in tongues but it wasn't the Promised Land I want you to know this message is what brings you into the Holy Ghost and to its fullness it provides for you the token not a gift but the literal life of Jesus Christ now so you see he looked at him he said we've come we've come two-thirds of the journey that's as far as Pentecost had come that's as far as Luther had come that's as far as Wesley is coming I'm talking about Pentecost Azusa Street but now he said as he gets through to his message on Paradox where he tells him this vision and in the in between that Vision he sees that on that Journey there on the path on the highway is is a big mamba snake and is out to get and to kill and destroy because the devil will do anything he can to keep you out of the promise and he said every time it would come to me it would just slow down and come slower and slower until it would stop but after others it was chasing them around and they were just one step ahead of it and he said you've been given power to bind her loose and because of the power that was given to him he said then Satan that I might know the power that I have been given I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ amen and what happened there they he turned and he and he turned into a like a uh that snake turned into something Glass and its tail wrapped around its neck and blue smoke fell flew out of it and he said it Formed like an and sign and he said that meant anything beneath him and everything beneath him are you with me listen we are living in the day where there's got to be a people who binds the serpent death and her changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and when you do that you'll bind everything beneath him now so he said we won't be the Highland that runs back in the wilderness we'll cross Jordan the separation God break to us the seals that's on the back of the book so he knew then that that cross and Jordan would bring us in to the fullness of the Holy Ghost and the seals of God would be open the the book would be open come on Church I mean you know I was just at a meeting there in Germany and and there's a man who went around you know a preacher went around and said this guy this guy's preaching some weird Doctrine he's preaching that we have an open book I said well I sure wouldn't want to be preaching the book was closed this is no weird Doctrine this is a this is a Bible truth this is what God done in this day amen God saw that one that we entered him to the Holy Ghost and a huge portion of heaven was given to the prophet of God and that was that the Seven Seals would come off the book and it would open to us all the land every promise in the Bible all the way to a rapture [Applause] wow you can sing it again and say there's never been a day like this day to me we're living in an awesome hour an awesome time amen now so he he tells us this will be the tremendous victory in the love divine now listen because that this Prophet would not build the way of denomination because he would not sell his gift for money because he did not become popular now the church World criticizes him today say he didn't know how to handle money he didn't know how to use his gift he didn't understand his position all of these Yaya that they have about him but that was the very thing that God used because he wouldn't sell it because he didn't try to be the most popular though he had the greatest gift amen though he wouldn't sell it out to denomination and we'll fly you here and we'll fly you there and you can you can speak to the masses and uh we'll get you to listen to the the up and UPS will come and listen to you and all of that and and it won't be down to the the down and outs it'll be to the up and upset we'll get you in and we'll provide for you and you'll have a salary and a plane and you'll be the great man in our organization you know that's what the devil will do he'll offer you everything he'll offer you boys some little Jezebel that'll never make a mother to your children he'll offer you you girls some little Snicker Fritz there that that is not no more interested in the house of God or worshiper the Holy Ghost and nothing that'll never be a leader in the home amen that ain't all the devil will offer you jobs pulled you away from the house of God take you away from fatherhood ruin you come on do everything he canceled that these are Thief he comes to Rob and to kill and destroy so therefore instead of going with them God gave him a greater portion of the Holy Ghost which would open up the Seven Seals and the mysteries of God in the Book of Revelation would be revealed to us and we would know what the Thunders uttered they are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it's surprising to me sometimes you know even this week I had a a preacher asked me you know you know one says the Thunders are this and one said they're that and brother Tim what's your opinion my opinion I I don't have an opinion I know what the prophet of God said you well all the seals aren't opened and then you still got well the seventh ain't opened well then you still got a strap on your Bible you still don't know the mysteries of God you still have got a closed book you know what caused that is because if people didn't get into the word and eat the book [Applause] kind of reminds me of brother Daniel Williams one time I won't tell you the whole story but anyway I'll tell you this part of it just to cut it short but there was a man that that came to him and said you know the seals aren't open brother Tim the seventh seal isn't open oh he said uh yeah it's it's open I said why don't you get me your seal book so he comes and brings him a seal book and he looks at it and there's two places marked in the whole book and he says preacher's visual book yeah no no that's not what I mean is this the one you study out of yes you know and then he looked at he said you just got a couple of places marked where somebody else told you what was in it and he closed it back and he handed it back to him and he said don't you argue with me again until you read this book amen you know read it eat it digest it you you will you will find out yeah brother brennerman you'll said some things in the original seventh seal and he said he felt checked about releasing it and so he held it back made a different ending that he would release but then after his death the whole the entire bit of it was was uh it was given to us the original seventh seal so brother Brandon can say God would not permit it so therefore it wasn't revealed because God wouldn't permit it because he made a new ending to it because he said it would send thousands of my friends from me you know why because he'd think he was trying to make himself the seventh angel so he made a new ending to it but friends that's not our excuse anymore there's over a hundred different quotes where brother Madam tells us all the Seven Seals have been revealed but it still winds up to be a question and a point of the dissension because people that is their Cadence Barney and they look at it and say we can't take it and we can't go into that and it's not for us and we can't possess it it's their Cadence barnia so they wander around and around and around make a camp out in the wilderness rather than going on into the Holy Ghost now kadish barnia happens more than once for many of you today your face in the Kadesh barnea I got some whole messages to preach on it but you're at a place where you've got to make a choice you're either going to be talked out of it by the devil because of some circumstance and say well it ain't for me or you're going to go all the way you've got to decide what are you are you one of those that's going to perish in the wilderness are you a just for a Caleb you got to decide it is the promise for me for my children amen this is our inheritance This Is My Land This is my possession and I'm going to take it every sick person is at their own Cadence barnia they don't go on into it and and fight and take their possession well they'll be graduated to the other side but nevertheless barnia but now I want you to know Joshua had a Ministry and his ministry was to divide inheritance that God had left for Israel and so his part his job was to give us the land and and of course because of his love being accepted in the Beloved here in the land I want you to understand it's a land flowing with milk and honey yeah I know they're they're demons there there are devils there they're camped out jebusites and and websites and every other thing are you with me amen but we have been accepted in the Beloved and we're here in the land of the Holy Ghost and there are gifts because of his love there is healing because of his love there are Miracles and joy and peace and happiness all because of his love is all in the Holy Ghost let me show you this in the Bible Romans Chapter 14 verse 17 you can put it on the screen for everybody to see for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink you know because they're they're about over here arguing over what kind of meats we can eat and whether or not this is kosher and that is not and he said if the kingdom of God is not meet and drink but here's what the kingdom is it is righteousness peace and joy where and the Holy Ghost amen so all of the promise of God lay in the Holy Ghost and you're saying I don't need more of it oh yes you do [Applause] the whole land is yours why would you just be satisfied with a little bit you're not a slave anymore that has no right to own land you have a right to ever Divine promise so here's our domain this is our Kingdom right there the kingdom of God is righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost so that's the kingdom that's our domain that's our Dominion that means that's what we're King over amen king of righteousness king of Peace king of joy king of your complexes king of your hindrances King over what the devil said about you you're King amen you're not a slave you have been brought here's a royal Nation a holy priesthood so you see that's our borders and within the borders of our land is the power of God overcoming life miracles signs wonders and once in the Holy Ghost and you take apart I say you know Jericho gets open and you see now the whole book is open well you don't stay there at Jericho we'll just major on this no you go on to the next amen you go in your expand your borders and man expanded from sea to Sea all that the word of God says you can have you do it and then there there again once in the Holy Ghost we keep expanding and there we will even meet death itself and death will be swallowed up in Victory I'm preaching to a people that will meet death himself not some little demon not some little devil not some little complex not submit them physical problem come on sickness or ailment but death himself and we'll defeat him for the Bible said death will be swallowed up in Victory that's how complete he has given the land to even death itself will be taken wouldn't you like to get it around your hands around its neck and squeeze it real hard until it gasped like you've seen some of your loved ones gasp somebody's going to do that might as well be me for this reason I've come that's the way you feel should be there in the Holy Ghost we're going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you think that's going to be less of the Holy Ghost no it'll be more of the Holy Ghost amen the the Dynamics of this church will be a refillment of the Holy Ghost you know I I don't care what part you have taken and how far you've Advanced there's still more to advance and that's what I keep saying advance so there in the Holy Ghost will be changed in a moment the twinkling of an eye with the refilling of the Holy Ghost we will be caught up to meet him in the air with the dead in Christ from The Seven Ages so there again brother Bradham talked about this he said Joshua and Caleb had that faith they looked at the adversary and they had that faith said we're more than able to conquer this anything the others looked at it and said we're like grasshoppers in their sight I don't know how they knew that must have went up and asked what do I look like Oh I'm a grasshopper well no you know it was in their imagination you know some people need something their imagination cleansed because every time that they listen to something even repeat I don't even know how to get along with their own wife or husband because their imagination goes so wild you know what I'm saying he said this about me and never was said she said that way and it was never that it was imagination brother Tim meant this how do you know what I meant you let some devil sit on your on your shoulder and twist what I say and then tell me what I meant it wasn't what I meant what the devil said to you but you see Joshua and Caleb they had that faith that we're more than able to conquer anything that would come before us and he said that's the trouble with the church we can conquer every disease we have the power in us we are Sons and Daughters of God nothing can stand before us the only thing he wants is to find somebody who will believe it I say don't let this come this far and leave the the systems of the world denominationalism and embrace the message and embrace the truth and believe this and believe that and then stop short of recognizing Who We Are and our sonship he wants somebody who will believe it he wants to believe he will believe that what God's already done for you not we will be we are now and the ever living presence of the spirit of God is in us now so again so God brings him to this land and they stand to Kadesh and they go over and check it out yeah the land's just as good as you said it was it truly flows with milk and honey here's the big grapes clusters that two men have to pack here he hears the figs and the pomegranates you know you know there was actually three hello there was actually three fruits that was brought The Grapes the figs and the pomegranates first pull second pull third pull amen every promise of God's word is somebody with me amen lays right there in the Promised Land hallelujah amen behind me here is the valley of agilon that I bet that I've had put up for the service today and then as we were coming to Israel there and we were about to leave right at that time the the sun was about to go down and I said it's right at the time we're just what needed more sunlight and he looked at an impossibility and he spoke Hallelujah he spoke not just as a man but a man commissioned by God who had an authority given to him from God and he said Son stand still and moon stand still we gotta finish this fight Hallelujah that's what he did he looked at I want you to know that's in the land the spoken word is in the land the power of God is in the land but his sons recognizing their Authority and their place and their position realizing it's for me it's for my children yeah my children can overcome too amen for them that's so far off don't matter how long they how far they strayed it's for you too you can have it the land is yours but you've got to fight for it so well I've got an addiction brother Tim well you've got to fight against that thing you just can't feel sorry for yourself and say well I got an addiction no you gotta fight you gotta you gotta you gotta come to a place where you hate that thing amen you got to find out you got to find come to the place where that you quit looking to that for comfort and begin to look to Jesus for your comfort amen he's the only thing that will satisfy the thirst and soul are you with me amen but the land is yours every bit of it's yours now but people are expecting God to reach down and get them by the neck and and and say you know you bring me out and you clean me off and you heal me and I believe you then and God said it don't work that way you start fighting and I'll get behind you and fight with you but as long as you're content to live with your Devils I'm going to leave you right where you are living with your Devils I hope you finally get miserable until you say God I'm through with this but see God doesn't do his business that way where he just grabs somebody and sets him over there in the land he said no I'm giving you a land that is possessed I'm giving you a land where devils are camping on a promise and you're going to have to drive him off amen now I'm going to go with you and I'll fight your battles but I'm going to use you to do it you know we want God to do all our praying we want God to do all the everything you know everything else God pick us up put us in it and God said no that ain't the way I work the way I work is that you I'm going to use you I'm going to use your hands I'm going to use your mouth I want you to start proclaiming I am a daughter of God I am a child of God I don't belong to the devil I belong in this land I won't be a slave no more somebody needs to tell the devil this morning I'm not no longer be your slave this is the last day devil from now on I'm servant God I'm through with your weapons the sleepless nights the weary days the depression I'm through with it all I'm ready now to go into the promised land I'm leaving it behind whatever I have to do if I have to drag you to the blood you'll never make it to the blood Hallelujah amen because the Red Sea of his blood will cover up on you and find you in the midst and I see you as my enemy dead you don't have to keep living with your complex you don't have to keep living with a monkey on your back you don't have to keep a slave to drugs and alcohol and pornography you can be free really Hallelujah and that's many many witnesses right here that said yeah come on over the land is good the Holy Ghost is good it works well why don't just go out there and run them amorites out in those Hittites and parasites why don't you just run them all out no Israel had something to do you got something to do too land is good land is yours you go possess it brother Tim make up my mind for me not I won't do it won't help you're the one who has to choose the narrow way the harder way God's way now here's a tip and I got this tip from Brother Branham who said I'll give you a little tip sometimes you might be sitting out there with a cancer or you might be sitting there with this disease and you think why me being a Christian would it be be in this way why would I be sitting like this if I'm a Christian sometimes God lets the things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and then he comes and makes a way through it for you that you might say this day this scripture is being fulfilled that he promised to do he let the children the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace but then they said our God is able to Deliver Us from this firing this fruitness but nevertheless will not bow to your image amen and when they walked out of there the smell no smell of the furnace was upon them and they could have said this day this scripture is fulfilled so God allows circumstances in our life so we can be inspired to say this day it's promise this word is true and it is fulfilled Hallelujah now Joshua knew what God had said he was Seed of Abraham and he said you know he looked up and said I believe God has given us this land and we're more than able to take it and because he stood the test against that whole group of Israelites listen all his brethren him and Caleb stood together and all the rest of them argued against it you know and then they went out and spread the the bad report you know first said that they'll survive yep the land's there it's as good as God said it's flowing with milk and honey but you see in this Modern Age we can't take it you see it ain't for us yeah you know and and here they bring back fruit you know three three evidences of that land of how good it really was and they even disbelieved the evidence and then he said so they they stand there and and hear Joshua stands a test and as they give this evil report the whole congregation now the whole church comes under the spirit of depression and say would be God we would have died in the wilderness and then they begin to say lead us and make us a captain and take us back to Egypt you see because they wanted the land but they didn't want to have to conquer now no matter how big you are or how what the opposition is what the doctor said God gave the promise and God is up to it come on if God gave it God's going to back up his word amen and here Joshua and Caleb said keep still everybody shut up they're bread for us we can take it our God is bigger than them amen what we have is greater than what they have oh but they have walls our God is greater and God would prove them walls would fall flat the moment that they testified and shouted maybe God's waiting on you to start shouting maybe God's really waiting for you to start quitting right quit your negativism and start being positive about the word of God and quick take the cane out and say I can but you don't know how long I've had this problem you don't know it's been in my family you don't know I don't care what I don't know I know what I do know and I know God gave me this land and I'm taking this land Hallelujah the promises to you to your children amen says not only for me but if I break the cycle it will break the cycle for my children Hallelujah why pass this unbelief down to another generation [Applause] so what do you do when he come down to that River Jordan he possessigated his enemies oh yeah brother he done had the devil worried because it was somebody start believing and if you'll start believing the devil will get scared because he ain't scared of you as an unbeliever but the moment you start believing Hallelujah the moment that you start realizing that amen I'm not waiting on the power I've Got The Power you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and I have the Holy Ghost so therefore devil you got to move back [Applause] you ain't holding me you ain't holding my family you ain't keeping the promise from me the promise is mine God is true to his promise right there right there when that sun was about that position over the valley of agilon and the enemy was being chased but they needed a little more Daylight I gotta finish this fight how many is that way this morning amen I'm not just happy just to have them on the run I'm going to finish this fight amen we're going to take their kings and put our feet upon their neck amen we're gonna hallelujah we're gonna overcome until every one of the enemy is dead We're Not Gonna live with another complex another problem another thing another lie of the devil and I'll tell you what as far as I can tell Joshua and his and his camp they were having some pretty good nights but the devil in his camp in Jericho was having sleepless nights you know why because they believed the report we heard what you did to the Egyptians we heard what happened at the Red Sea we heard how your God has been with we heard how you have fought against the malachites and your lichten we have heard we have heard we have heard and they were trembling I'll tell you when a Believer starts believing Hallelujah starts being what he is a Believer and he starts believing the devils are backing up [Applause] you start giving him nightmares that's what Gideon was when he went down to the camp of the midianites and God said I you're wondering about the victory I want to show you I already got it so come down here and listen to what they're saying so Gideon and I but he went down and they were listening what are they saying in the tents and a man woke up and punched his neighbor and said I just had an awful dream you see he still you see the devil started having nightmares you know what he was work listen there was so many midianites until they were like the sand of the sea and there were only 300 of Gideon but those 300 believe him in God who wouldn't bow to Idols somebody helped me preach amen they were more than enough in the hand of God and it had the devil trembling and they were having nightmares if God can get you to believe in you'll get your devils nightmares they're not yours they're the one bothering you that's why I called them yours they're not yours they don't belong to you you don't have to live with them you're not

the serpents Mouse him down good man smash him down good disconnect his head off his body and they sub tread on scorpions and serpents and nothing shall by any means harm them Hallelujah [Applause] praise God thank you years ago when I had my surgeries it was back in 1978 I went to an old doctor when I was 12. he looked at my feet and what he would have to do to do a surgery on him and he swore and he cursed thinking about what he had to do when I was about 24 23 I went back to the same old doctor because he was a gutsy old man he would take risks nobody else would a guy had crashed on the side of the road in a motorcycle and brought him up to the hospital oh Dr over Dyke said send them back to the scene of the accident pick up every piece of bone you can everybody else all the other doctors said I just cut his leg off he said no go back and pick up every piece of bone you can find bring me every fragment he cleaned them up and laid them down right in that thing and they all grew back together and the man kept his leg he was a gutsy old doctor by the time that I'm I went to him for surgery he'd had a heart attack and he didn't smoke any more because there in the office he'd light one cigarette off another when I was 12. but he said he had a heart attack and he said in the ambulance I flicked that cigarette out the ambulance door and I never smoked another one but anyway he gave me a 50 chance of keeping my feet said because of infection or whatever sits on he said but I'll tell you what a prosthetic be better than what you got in their condition so I didn't know I didn't know what you know what to do you know I was looking at this as a very serious thing you know he got feet and you don't want to lose him and so you know I was praying about it you love this story my friend brother vermilion's back there listening he knew brother the Lakers brother Liquors received a word from the Lord from for me he drove 500 miles over across to deliver that message and it was Romans 16. and it said the God of Peace will bruise Satan under your feet I took that Word of Promise and I went there and I had that surgery and when I came out of the walking cast that old doctor that was hard as he could be he looked at me and said Son don't you ever thank me for for what I've done he said I that did nothing said listen you have laid in that hospital nine days and your feet your leg swelled up so much my old ticker would go and beat like this every time I looked at you said I just knew I was going to have to cut it off because infection and whatever would get in it and your foot soiled up so big we had to cut the cast Open and hold it there and said but look son look at you walking down this aisle he throwed up his hands he said press up and people pray the same way they prayed that time because God has worked a miracle well I'm telling you that same God that said to me then the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet this feet will bruise ahead of every devil I put you on notice now you can criticize you can make fun but these feet will put be put on your head Satan Hallelujah see God is true to his promise and no matter what he has to do if he has to bankrupt Heaven he'll do that before he'll let one word go down he says I'm the Lord God that heals all thy diseases they lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's the promise of God Hallelujah Joshua didn't have any idea how he was going to get through it how he would take the city but God said I have an angel I'm sinning an angel before you to guide you on your way don't despise him he won't pardon your sins he'll tear you across a place he'll ruffle your feathers but remember follow him he's going to lead you to the promised land don't despise him don't reject him and you see God has given every sick person Divine Healing everyone that's wounded by sin he promises him Deliverance I can show you person after person you'd look around a lot of times and think you're sitting in a bunch of saints they are but not what they were amen some of them were junks and alcoholic and dope heads some of them were prostitutes and whoremongers and everything else but God rich in Mercy hallelujah amen they looked there at the promises I ain't worthy to have the Holy Ghost but God made a promise Hallelujah I had nothing worthy about me to have this lamb but God made a promise I can have it they pressed through until they received it you got to fight for every inch of ground got to put your foot on it footsteps is possession God wants you to fight through your promise some of you will go to youth camp this year this week and there will be brothers pray for you and we'll scream and shout and pray and everything else you know lay hands on you and pray for you

away amen what am I going to do I'm going to read my Bible I'm going to pray I'm going to call on confusion I'm not turning back [Music] amen Joshua he fought for every inch of ground from one end of the country to the other but God made a promise I've given it to you it's yours I give it to you and whether there's Giants whether there's atheists whether it's infidels whether it's cold formal churches what difference does it make let's take our Promised Land others want to stand there Cadence Barney and going wander in the wilderness for the rest of the time not me not me I'm ready to take

just tell you my friends I'm not sitting around mourning and crying and depressed and whatever else I know in whom I have believed I've been left here for a job to do and I'm going to finish it that's the way you ought to look at yourself today I'm here to the Finish and here to finish the race I am here to be that Overcomer that's promised instead of getting weaker all the time we ought to get stronger all the time Hallelujah you say I tell you what the devil thinks he had something on his hands before he's got a whole lot more on his hands I've just now beginning to fight amen the Caleb in me is coming out my sword is sharp and I'm ready to take my inheritance are you ready to take your inheritance Hallelujah take your promise take your lab take your possession fight with everything you

Army he's got an Earthly Army come on Amen and let me tell you friends you know you don't use your flesh but you got a representation there there was an angel that was assigned to you at your birth Hallelujah the word has been watching you over you all of your life amen has brought you to this point and I'll tell you what the Lord is on your side and he's the god of heavenly armies and he's a god of Earthly armies and we're here a part of the Earthly Army and we're here putting our shoulder to the will and say we will have every promise that God gave because it's ours Jesus paid for it we're going to possess the land of our inheritance but you are at your own Kadesh Borneo some of you young people could be going to the camp and you'll be looking there and you'll see others bring back fruit victories my brother Tim I ain't never seen one I was your I was a 15 year old I was the Lord's victory and I'm still here today his victory so I've seen him come and I've seen him go and I've seen them fall and they will not stand well you got look at one here the 50-something years and I'm still standing a young person in this generation in this age and this time but you are now at your cadish barnia you got to make your own decision it lays in the lap of every man every woman what will I do with this Jesus called Christ because he's on your hands and you can't wash it off pilate couldn't and you couldn't so the best thing to do is take it and place him in your heart I want you to Bow your heads with me went to musicians to come it's okay days Barney a moment anytime you see a promise of God and you have to decide like Joshua and Caleb whether what you are seeing is true or whether what God's word says is true where the circumstances are too big your problem's too large I can never break this addition addiction I can never get over this problem if I were to listen to the devil he that disqualified me many years ago he'll do everything he can to disqualify you he'll do everything he can to try to find some blemish some fault some this some that one why you're unworthy not able if I don't listen to him there wouldn't be a church called the evening light Tabernacle if you listen to him there won't be a Rapture for you if you listen to him you'll go right on a slave to that addiction Satan destroying you in your marriage your home destroying your kids he's a thief he comes to Rob and to kill and destroy but Jesus said I come to hell I give life an abundant life why don't you ask him today Lord let me come into the abundance abundance of the Holy Ghost to the fullness of my destiny that you promised me in the Beloved God bless you he sees your hands would there be somebody here today say brother Tim I'm there's an addiction in my life there's a situation there that I I've never been able to overcome it's I drink I use alcohol I do this I do that you know the reason for it is because God Made You to thirst after him and you're thirsting for a living God a cold Creed of some denomination ain't gonna satisfy that longing you're going to have to meet Jesus in the time in the time that your Cadence barnia today where you're forced to make a choice [Music] today you say I don't want to be a slave any longer I want to be free would there be somebody raise their hand to God and say that's me I want to be free God bless you God bless you God bless you is there someone else amen he sees you your little heart my soul thirst for Living God I pray father in the name of Jesus you'll take these words today [Music] as we prepare for the communion we sing the song says oh what Fellowship oh what Joy divine leaning on the Everlasting arm I pray that every man woman boy and girl will come into that Fellowship [Music] into that Joy divine where they can realize if God is on my side if he had not been on my side if he had not left a remnant [Music] we'd all be consumed but Lord you've left a remnant you've left a people who want to serve you who wants to give their lives to you I pray that you'll Minister them in a special way today ever a heart of her life I pray that those addictions and things that they're gotten that's holding on their lives will be broken that today they can say I'm willing I'm willing to take God to this word I'm willing to fight through until I see victory in Jesus name I ask it For Your Glory prepare our hearts Lord as we come to the communion table in Jesus name amen amen God bless you we're going to be coming to the communion here just in a moment brother Timothy is going to come lead a couple of songs we have to do things just a little different and because of the size of our audience and those who participate so you know when we were just a little home Church are there and the old Lebanon Primitive Baptist building we just stand around in a circle and I take the the one glass and platter bread and walk around and serve communion then things change things different things are needed and we have to change we do it like brother Branham did it's in it's in the message we used the multiple cups and the broken bread I loved it in the old church where we could while we was waiting on the sisters to come back from their foot washing us Brothers could gather around lay hands on one another pray over different needs till everybody gathered back in that was wonderful we moved here we have to do things a little different so as you know that when we do have the communion here in a minute you'd be ushered down the aisle by the by one of the ushers and you'll the deacons will be holding the bread the wine I will be standing there as the guard to the table watching each one of you as you come through that's why we were instructed to do then you'll go out and go to foot washing so well it's not night it's not enough it's dark enough the world we're living in is dark enough when you leave from here and from this church you're going to have to go out into the darkness but you can go out with a song in your heart knowing that greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world so God bless you as we prepare for that moment brother Timothy will you just come and lead us in some songs now we 've [Music] safe and secure from all along [Music] with my Lord [Music] come on [Music] leading [Music] life what a blessings [Music] [Applause] [Music] what's wrong [Music] [Applause] [Music] all along [Music] today only everybody [Music] like [Music] that's the door from all along [Music] here in this wonderful message this morning this song came in my heart it says if you're getting tired of losers in life's war and you keep searching for something worth fighting for well God's got an arm been proved in tried so just come on over to the wind inside to help us if you're getting tired of losing lives more and you keep searching for something worth fighting for well God's got an army we've improved and tried so come on over to The Winning Side over to the winning side where we're finally following Jesus [Music] very far through the lines [Music] can hurt me [Music] [Applause] so [Music] what you said [Applause] [Music] trees [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] to the winner [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] when Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] no words [Music] [Applause] I'm going all the way [Music] it always [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I've come I've gone yes I tried oh yes [Music] I draw the line [Music] go away [Music] I know it all over all the way if I'm going all the way oh the way if I'm going all the way I'm going all the way with my eyes made my decision [Music] made my decision oh I'm going all the way if I made my decision I'm going all the way I made myself [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] with my Lord [Music] sing the song I he was wounded for my transgressions [Music] a pair of Hearts right now for the [Music] communion we remember what he did for us he was wounded for us [Music] surely [Music] is [Music] one more time for us adventurous foreign [Music] foreign [Music] for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is a new testament in my blood this new year is often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you just show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we're chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man the hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation as far hits together now father today I commit this wine and bread and to you is a representation of your blood and body and we Lord by representation take this as a token identifying ourselves with the sacrifice and realizing that your body itself was not broken but there on the day of Pentecost the spirit of God was torn from you and they're divided among the people so when we hold this bread in our hands we're remembering I am a part of this body I have a place where I fit in the body of Christ and when we take this wine which represents the life of the grape that has been squeezed out Lord we realize your life was squeezed out for us and you were wounded for our transgressions the sins that we committed for our iniquity you took the bruising and the chastisement the whippings that we should have got you took them for us thank you Lord thank you for what you've done now may all our sins be under the blood of Jesus Lord may we oh God is take this today and eat and drink of this bread and this wine remembering what we are a part of and that we're to drink deep of the spirit as the Bible said be not drunk with wine which is excess but be filled with the spirit but Lord as we take this little portion just to remind us of how your life was squeezed out that you gave your your blood for us that we are people that you valued and that you love so much I asked Lord you're blessed now this portion and the people as they come today in Jesus name amen amen I want you to remember as you come originally this was a Passover meal and people would take of what they had they would bring it and this was in memory of the Passover and then they would Gather in homes and places and some would have much and some would have little and Paul would say said well you're shaming those who have nothing because they have very little and the others have lots of abundance that they have brought to this meal so he said I received something from the Lord we're not going to do this as a meal anymore we're just going to take the bread and the wine and we're going to remember in doing so the death of the Lord because with this part we're going to do in remembrance this is just for a moment you will take this 10 minutes from now it'll be out of your mouth The Taste maybe we might be gone [Music] the communion that you're really supposed to have is a communion Lord that's the fellowship we will go from here and have a fellowship meal we will enjoy the fellowship of others that Fellowship of sweet and it's good it's all because of Jesus we have one another so we're thankful for each one of you you're everyone part important to the body of Christ but then that me all will be gone maybe in days to come you'll even forget what you even ate The Taste will be gone from your mouth but that's not really the fellowship meal no more than this is really the communion God wants he wants your fellowship so as you come down through here and you take of the bread and the wine I want you to remember that you're a part of this body and that you're an important part each part will fit together to make a loaf all torn from the same loaf we are of one body we'll take out the blood the wine the blood of the grape and we will drink of that but let's remember what it's all about let's remember it's an action to cause a reaction like Elisha through the stick in the water and iron floated like he had salt in a cruise and poured in a bitter stream like Moses cut down a tree which would represent Christ and the cross make bitter water sweet it was an action to cause a reaction this in itself is no good unless it causes a reaction and that reaction should be to remember Passover communion Is Not For a Moment you have entered in Passover every day it should be eating the lamb every day it should be drinking of his life every day it should be a day of worship communion this communion that you're having right here is not the communion that he wants it's only representing we're doing this to cause us to stop remember the price he paid remember the part you're to be now when you're apart from each other remember you can't go out in the world and be like them then we'll go to foot washing that moment of taking your shoes off and submitting yourself to another to wash somebody else in humility watching yours is an ordinance but it's not what God wants it only is representing what God wants he wants you to remember that as you associate with one another you got a job to do and that's to serve you're not really here to be served you hear to serve so the really part of foot washing that is important isn't you getting your feet washed you watching somebody else's feet and Jesus would have this discussion with his disciples and he would say I'm going to wash your feet and Peter said oh no oh no you know it wasn't mine no I'm not going to let you stoop down and be that humble and watch mine no ah Jesus said you don't know what I'm doing but I'll tell you this Peter if I don't wash your feet you have no part with me and he said oh if it's that way he didn't wash my heads my hands and my whole body will just wash everything and Jesus said no I'm only going to wash your feet because he that has been washed is already clean because in that day in the bath houses they would wash the bodies and clean but then they would have to walk from that through the trails the dusty roads and whatever else and there were the animals had dropped their droppings and so on was there in the dirt and the grime and so they had all been washed Jesus had breathed on them and said now you're clean to the word that I speak to you they'd had Washings you've been washed you've been cleansed by the Holy Ghost and Washed by the Water of the word but now since that time you had to walk through the path of life a lot of Filth and dirt all around you and your feet get dirty [Music] you just keep remembering you do need your feet washed [Music] just keep remembering you got to get humble enough that when the word Goes Forth you'll let it wash the dirt off your feet just remember you're here to serve to encourage somebody along the road along the way and wash the dirt off their feet said brother don't listen to that kind of stuff don't don't repeat that gossip don't do that don't live that long and you wash the dirt off you encourage somebody along the road you're here to encourage one another remember what this is about [Music] remember the blessing that God has given you by allowing you to have a part by making you a part of this body for making you peace of the bread remember without the others it's not a whole loaf we need one another so encourage one another love one another bless one another at a fine build up one another and when you hear someone being torn down lift them up encourage strengthen take a load off now what we're going to do is the ushers are going to come and by the road they'll bring you down in two lines and you'll come from this way and you'll go out down these aisles so you'll be taken down this aisle and down this and and when you do you take your communion in the bread you go right straight out to these doors and the men will go to the right to this hallways here and the women will go that way to where they're set up there and then we'll come back and we'll have some songs and some worship and then we will have prayer and dismiss you to uh the fellowship meal so right now I want those that um that are musicians and so on and and and those that are helping serve and whatever and preparing food and things like that for you to to try to make it down first in these lines I want the brothers to come is they'll come right now we will begin the communion and you all can go ahead and put on some music we'll just have that and the brothers for those that are in the music will come and uh come back in early [Music] Amanda you can have your seats if you're not taking communion you can just stay right in your seats until they all come back again if you're if you take communion not taking foot washing then just go back to your seats after taking communion [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
