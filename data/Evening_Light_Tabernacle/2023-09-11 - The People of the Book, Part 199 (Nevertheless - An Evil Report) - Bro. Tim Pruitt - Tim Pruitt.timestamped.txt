[1:03:28] the Lord Jesus amen he's moved over
[1:03:30] toward hot springs and driving over this
[1:03:32] way so we're happy to have him in the
[1:03:35] house of the Lord this morning
[1:03:37] amen isn't it good to be a Christian
[1:03:41] Amen to be serving the lord in this
[1:03:43] generation to be a light in this time of

[1:03:57] to get ready for your miracle
[1:03:59] I'll tell you God's moving you ought to
[1:04:02] be expecting you've got a prodigal
[1:04:04] that's away from home may not be a child
[1:04:06] may not be a son or daughter maybe a
[1:04:08] mother or dad but whoever it is God
[1:04:11] knows maybe a brother or sister but God
[1:04:13] knows
[1:04:14] and God's able he's moving
[1:04:17] amen he's calling is he lacks getting
[1:04:20] people ready you realize even the church
[1:04:24] not the bride the church has to be ready
[1:04:26] because when the Rapture takes place not
[1:04:29] to be another Gentile saved so you see
[1:04:32] when when we leave the Holy Spirit
[1:04:34] leaves the Earth with us or we leave
[1:04:36] with the Holy Spirit as it lifts and
[1:04:38] it's lifting you can see it lifting from
[1:04:40] the nation lifting from society lifting
[1:04:43] from homes lifting from churches you've
[1:04:45] lifting from everywhere and when it
[1:04:48] leaves we're going with it
[1:04:50] and I pray all the time Jesus said we
[1:04:53] should pray always to escape the things
[1:04:55] that are coming on the earth and to be
[1:04:57] accounted worthy to stand before the son
[1:04:59] of man and the son of man is the word
[1:05:02] stand before him and let him judge us
[1:05:05] amen because if we're judged now we
[1:05:07] won't be condemned with the world
[1:05:10] amen and we receive the Judgment of the
[1:05:12] word now and let him change our lives
[1:05:14] amen and accept his correction and move
[1:05:18] into the Realms of the spirit and the
[1:05:20] supernatural then we won't be left
[1:05:22] behind here he because the Rapture is a
[1:05:25] judgment I'll take one I'll leave one
[1:05:27] you know I that's a it's a judgment so
[1:05:30] we we must be ready for it and it's not
[1:05:33] the white Throne judgment no it's not
[1:05:35] the Wrath poured out no but it's it's
[1:05:38] the blessings of God as he as he judges
[1:05:41] and he looking he's looking for the
[1:05:43] token which is the Holy Ghost Amen
[1:05:47] brother Branham use the word token it
[1:05:49] differ differentiates away from just the
[1:05:52] the baptism on the realm of the spirit
[1:05:55] that the Azusa Street movement had is
[1:05:58] the token it's a literal life of Jesus
[1:06:00] Christ but I want you to understand it
[1:06:03] is the Holy Ghost amen and how we need
[1:06:06] him this morning amen we love you and we
[1:06:09] week thank you I appreciate your prayers

[1:06:24] there so brother Timothy and I will be
[1:06:27] away uh two Sundays from from now and
[1:06:30] and uh we'll be sharing the word of God
[1:06:32] with them we love we love it when other
[1:06:35] ministers come well there's a prize

[1:06:49] to that I hope you're praying about it
[1:06:51] and calling on the name of the Lord amen
[1:06:54] to move upon hearts and lives and send
[1:06:57] those that are you know people are
[1:06:59] hungry people are hungry people are
[1:07:02] seeking God and and it's important in
[1:07:04] this hour because he says blessed are
[1:07:07] they that hunger and thirst for
[1:07:09] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:07:13] amen amen God bless you if you'll turn
[1:07:16] with me to Book of Numbers chapter 13
[1:07:18] verse 23 we're going to read from there
[1:07:21] this morning I'm going to be and you
[1:07:24] you'll find these words in my text as I
[1:07:27] read it this morning but I'm going to be
[1:07:30] speaking on nevertheless
[1:07:34] and then I put it in parentheses an evil
[1:07:38] report
[1:07:40] so you know
[1:07:41] here we are in a in a day an hour where
[1:07:44] we're at the brother Brandon calls this
[1:07:47] the Judgment seat of the world
[1:07:50] so every person comes to this place of
[1:07:53] acadishbarnia
[1:07:55] every church every age comes to a place
[1:07:59] of of um kadish barnia and we we are
[1:08:04] here in this time because it's a Rapture
[1:08:08] hour
[1:08:09] and we've got to decide whether we can
[1:08:11] take it our weather is not for us
[1:08:14] weather's too hard when it's too it's
[1:08:16] impossible
[1:08:17] but I tell you again we're headed for a
[1:08:20] tour de crescendo
[1:08:21] and every person is headed toward and
[1:08:24] and forced to a decision what you're
[1:08:27] going to do with this Jesus called
[1:08:29] Christ
[1:08:30] and so today as we read we we will find
[1:08:35] ourselves either on one side of the
[1:08:37] other and I I trust we'll be on the side
[1:08:39] of those who can say we're more than
[1:08:42] able
[1:08:43] amen God bless you Numbers chapter 13
[1:08:46] verse 23 and they came unto the brook of
[1:08:49] Esco and cut down from them some Branch
[1:08:52] with one cluster of grapes and they
[1:08:55] buried between two upon the staff and
[1:08:59] they brought the pomegranates and of the
[1:09:01] figs and the place was called Brooke
[1:09:04] escall because of the cluster of grapes
[1:09:08] which the children of Israel cut down
[1:09:11] from this and they returned from
[1:09:14] searching the land after 40 days and
[1:09:18] they went and came to Moses into Aaron
[1:09:20] and to all the congregation of the
[1:09:22] children of Israel unto the Wilderness
[1:09:25] of Quran to Kadesh and brought back word
[1:09:29] unto them and unto all the congregation
[1:09:33] and showed them the fruit of the lamb
[1:09:36] and they told him and said we came unto
[1:09:40] the land whether thou sinnest us and
[1:09:43] surely it fluids with milk and honey and
[1:09:48] this is the fruit of it nevertheless the
[1:09:51] people be strong that dwell in the land
[1:09:54] and the walls cities are walled in very
[1:09:57] great
[1:09:58] and moreover we saw the children of
[1:10:00] Enoch there and the malachites dwell in
[1:10:03] the land of the South and the hidites
[1:10:06] and the jebusites and the amorites dwell
[1:10:09] in the mountains and the Canaanites
[1:10:11] dwell by the Sea and by the coast of
[1:10:14] Jordan
[1:10:15] and Caleb steeled the people before
[1:10:17] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[1:10:21] possess it
[1:10:22] for we are well able to overcome it
[1:10:26] but the men that went up with him said
[1:10:29] we be not able to go up against the
[1:10:32] people for we are for they are stronger
[1:10:35] than we and they brought up an evil
[1:10:38] report of the Lamb which they had
[1:10:41] searched unto the children of Israel
[1:10:43] saying the lamb through which we have
[1:10:46] gone to search it is a land that Edith
[1:10:49] up the inhabitants thereof and all the
[1:10:51] people that we saw in it are men of
[1:10:54] great statue
[1:10:55] and there we saw the Giants the sons of
[1:10:58] Enoch which cometh the Giants

[1:14:56] well let's cool feeling swept over this
[1:14:58] man and his eyes and his eyes became
[1:15:01] clear
[1:15:02] and another man you know heard of the
[1:15:05] same testimony and he was streaming and
[1:15:08] while he was streaming there his heart
[1:15:10] was so bad that he could only get around
[1:15:12] on on a walker or cane and then as as he
[1:15:17] began to hear of the testimonies of God
[1:15:20] passing by and healing his faith reached
[1:15:23] out and claimed the promise of God he
[1:15:26] also felt that same cool Sweep come over
[1:15:28] him and when he when he did
[1:15:32] um you know his he he he he threw aside
[1:15:36] his Walker and his Cane and and he went
[1:15:38] back to the doctor and the doctor said
[1:15:40] man you're so good I don't need to see
[1:15:42] you for another year
[1:15:47] Hallelujah I know you believe that
[1:15:49] because we've been seeing God moved too
[1:15:52] amen but he's moving by the spirit all
[1:15:55] over the world and I'll tell you what
[1:15:57] wherever you are whether you're in this
[1:16:00] church this morning you're streaming or
[1:16:01] listening in it is the hour of
[1:16:05] Deliverance
[1:16:06] God is delivering his people
[1:16:09] and I believe that with all of my heart
[1:16:11] now Israel following the pillar of Fire
[1:16:15] had been brought up to this place called
[1:16:17] kadish barnia
[1:16:19] but here they would refuse now to follow
[1:16:22] it into the land of promise
[1:16:26] and for 40 days there's 12 Spies that
[1:16:29] searched out the lines and and the
[1:16:32] evidence was shown of its goodness and
[1:16:35] they come back with the cluster of
[1:16:36] grapes and it took two men to carry in
[1:16:40] and the pomegranates in the figs
[1:16:43] and the Bible said in verse 27 they told
[1:16:46] him and this is the first report if they
[1:16:49] just stopped right here
[1:16:51] if they would have just kept with this
[1:16:54] word we we come to the line wither thou
[1:16:57] send us to us and surely it floweth with
[1:17:00] milk and honey and this is the fruit of
[1:17:04] it
[1:17:05] if they could have just left off the
[1:17:08] nevertheless
[1:17:10] if they would have stayed with that that
[1:17:14] very word right there things would have
[1:17:16] been different
[1:17:17] they wouldn't have wandered around 40
[1:17:19] years in the wilderness and I just say
[1:17:22] we ain't got 40 years to wander around
[1:17:25] because you see and we're not going to
[1:17:28] have 40 years because when this bride
[1:17:31] leads there's going to be only three and
[1:17:33] a half years left
[1:17:35] so as we look into this you know we you
[1:17:39] don't want to be left in the tribulation
[1:17:41] so if you ever believe this is our to
[1:17:44] believe if you ever prayed Lord help
[1:17:47] thou my unbelief this is a time to pray
[1:17:50] Lord help out my unbelief
[1:17:53] amen now for us the land is the Holy
[1:17:57] Ghost and is fullness it is exactly as
[1:18:01] God said this is this is exactly what
[1:18:04] they were saying on these this first
[1:18:06] part of the report it's exactly as what
[1:18:10] God Said
[1:18:11] it surely flows with milk and honey you
[1:18:14] know it is there here's the fruits of it
[1:18:17] here's the proof of the land
[1:18:19] and I wanted to say this land that we're
[1:18:23] in is not a physical line it's a land of
[1:18:27] an open book
[1:18:28] it's a land where the promises of God
[1:18:31] lay before us every one of them laying
[1:18:35] right there for you to possess this
[1:18:37] morning
[1:18:38] and he says and and I want to say it's
[1:18:41] exactly as God said there are provisions
[1:18:45] of Deliverance there is provision of
[1:18:48] experiences in the Holy Ghost there
[1:18:51] there is provisions of visions and
[1:18:54] spiritual dreams and prophecy and
[1:18:58] tongues and interpretation plus all the
[1:19:00] fruits of the spirit of love joy peace
[1:19:03] long-suffering gentleness meekness
[1:19:04] patience gentleness kindness all of
[1:19:07] these things lay there within there and
[1:19:10] then there are mystery truths that are
[1:19:13] ready to be discovered
[1:19:15] but these come up to the border of it
[1:19:17] and stopped refusing to take the land
[1:19:22] I just want to just remind you of what
[1:19:25] God has done in this generation
[1:19:27] I I
[1:19:30] just heard brother Matthew Watkins
[1:19:33] mentioned this and dear God help me that
[1:19:36] I don't ever preach as long as he does
[1:19:39] but nevertheless helped me to be mindful
[1:19:46] I'm saying that for his sake
[1:19:56] but he mentioned brother Perry green of
[1:19:58] whom that we had back in the the 80s
[1:20:03] that I that I actually had to come and
[1:20:06] give to our church
[1:20:08] um a testimony of things that he
[1:20:11] witnessed and seen and he shared with
[1:20:14] our church
[1:20:15] and brother Matthew mentioned this and
[1:20:19] as he did as he did mention it
[1:20:23] um you know it brought back to my memory
[1:20:25] again brother Perry's testimony and I
[1:20:28] just wanted to share it with you today
[1:20:30] as he mentioned this as a witness and
[1:20:33] eyewitness of what God has done in this
[1:20:36] generation I'm doing this to tell you of
[1:20:39] how good the land is
[1:20:41] and he said my family moved to Beaumont
[1:20:44] Texas in 1949 when my dad became pastor
[1:20:47] of the manual Gospel Church
[1:20:49] shortly therefore thereafter we learned
[1:20:51] that there was a man by the name of
[1:20:53] William Aaron Branham that was
[1:20:55] conducting Divine Healing meetings
[1:20:57] in Houston Texas which was less than a
[1:21:01] hundred miles away
[1:21:03] and he said you know since I
[1:21:06] he said that since I was nine years old
[1:21:08] I had quoted Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus
[1:21:12] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:21:14] forever but I had no idea what it really
[1:21:16] meant
[1:21:17] I was 16 at the time that we went to
[1:21:21] Houston Texas and I had the baptism of
[1:21:25] the Holy Ghost and had an experience of
[1:21:27] speaking in tongues and I'd read about
[1:21:30] Divine Healing
[1:21:32] um and rather ever miracle in the Bible
[1:21:34] and I believed them
[1:21:36] and yet he said I quoted since a child
[1:21:40] since nine years old Hebrews 13 8 the
[1:21:43] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:21:45] and forever but I had no idea what it
[1:21:47] really meant brother Branham was in the
[1:21:50] Sam Houston Coliseum on January the 23rd
[1:21:54] 1950 and we had arrived early enough
[1:21:58] that we were able to get a seat on the
[1:22:00] lower level right in front of the pulpit
[1:22:01] about 11 rows back as the service began
[1:22:05] the first speaker was brother Gordon
[1:22:07] Lindsay followed by FF Bosworth and then
[1:22:10] brother Branham came to the pulpit and
[1:22:13] as he looked across the the audience he
[1:22:16] said good evening friends
[1:22:18] it was so personal I I thought he was
[1:22:21] talking to me and I got up out of my
[1:22:24] seat and stood in front of the platform
[1:22:26] on the left hand side near the pulpit
[1:22:28] because I thought the man is spoken to
[1:22:30] me and when he had called for the prayer
[1:22:33] line about 15 people came forward and I
[1:22:36] found from where I was standing I could
[1:22:38] directly view the prayer line I never
[1:22:41] seen one before and I didn't know what
[1:22:43] to expect
[1:22:44] and the first person was a little
[1:22:46] seven-year-old boy that had been blind
[1:22:49] from birth
[1:22:50] and brother Branham took the boy by the
[1:22:52] hand and asked us to Bow our heads while
[1:22:55] he prayed for the child and as soon as
[1:22:57] the prayer was over the boy looked
[1:22:59] around like he could see and everybody
[1:23:01] began to praise the Lord and my thought
[1:23:03] was well how do I know the boy was blind
[1:23:06] and they held up by handkerchief and the
[1:23:08] little boy reached out and grabbed it
[1:23:10] they held out a microphone cord and he
[1:23:13] stepped over it and brother Bradman said
[1:23:15] now run back to your daddy and the boy
[1:23:18] turned and looked out at the audience of
[1:23:20] approximately 1100 people
[1:23:23] and he had never seen his dad and when
[1:23:26] the child had been called to the
[1:23:27] platform a man that came and stood next
[1:23:31] to me the man now called The Boy by name
[1:23:33] and the platform was about four feet
[1:23:36] high and the boy came to the edge of it
[1:23:38] and leaped off into the man's arms he
[1:23:42] played with the man's red necktie and
[1:23:45] then a saw the man's tears and and then
[1:23:48] he saw the man's tears and touched them
[1:23:50] and then he began to feel the man's face
[1:23:53] like a blind child would that was his
[1:23:55] dad then he threw his arms around his
[1:23:58] dad's neck and looked directly at me I
[1:24:01] knew I had seen a miracle it was the
[1:24:03] beginning of the chains of my life
[1:24:06] and there was a young lady that had been
[1:24:09] brought up had brought up a six-year-old
[1:24:11] boy that had been born with no feet
[1:24:14] brother Bradham took him in his arms and
[1:24:17] asked her to remove the stockings once
[1:24:19] more he asked us about our heads which I
[1:24:21] did but again I watched upward his
[1:24:24] brother Branham at brother Branham as he
[1:24:26] prayed I wasn't the only one watching
[1:24:29] because in the midst of the prayer it
[1:24:31] appeared that brother Branham dropped
[1:24:33] the little boy and many people in the
[1:24:37] audience gasp and right in front of my
[1:24:39] eyes I saw two little feet created and
[1:24:43] this affects me until this day when I
[1:24:45] see the little baby's feet it stirs
[1:24:47] something within my soul because of the
[1:24:49] Miracles that I saw
[1:24:52] so all I'm just doing is just bringing
[1:24:54] it out to you again today of the land
[1:24:59] and what lays in our land
[1:25:02] creative power
[1:25:04] creative power that can create new cells
[1:25:08] in a in a long and a lung that is filled
[1:25:11] with cancer have all brand new sales in
[1:25:14] it
[1:25:15] amen the power of God that can go out
[1:25:18] and rebuke an autoimmune disease or or
[1:25:21] that can heal a brain bleed or make a
[1:25:24] crippled child to walk
[1:25:26] we're talking about the power of the
[1:25:28] Living God we're talking about the
[1:25:31] goodness that lays in this land
[1:25:34] amen the treasures that are there
[1:25:37] the great Mysteries that have been
[1:25:40] revealed in the truths that have been
[1:25:42] given to us in this generation where
[1:25:45] that we can say we are now preaching
[1:25:48] what Paul preached
[1:25:51] well you know and of course these
[1:25:53] brother Adam called him at katisbanea
[1:25:56] borderline believers they walk up into
[1:26:00] the borderline and and then they taste
[1:26:03] of the goodness of the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:05] they see its fruits and refuse to go in
[1:26:10] okay
[1:26:11] there's all things that we could bring
[1:26:13] out on Hebrews 6 and maybe we will some
[1:26:16] today
[1:26:17] but I I want just to say today you know
[1:26:20] there there are many that are standing
[1:26:22] there at the border
[1:26:24] or maybe maybe they've got into the edge
[1:26:27] of it and I'm just saying there's more
[1:26:32] am I the it is wonderful that we have
[1:26:35] conquered Jericho
[1:26:37] and for us the seals are open the walled
[1:26:41] cities and you know Jericho was the
[1:26:43] entrance into the land and so to get the
[1:26:46] land open the walls had to come down
[1:26:48] first
[1:26:49] Amen to get the land open the seals had
[1:26:52] to be open the Mysteries had to be
[1:26:54] revealed and the book opened to us to
[1:26:57] open up ever promise that lay in there
[1:27:00] is somebody with me amen and I know that
[1:27:03] many will listen to me today and say but
[1:27:06] we're not borderline Believers we'll
[1:27:08] conquered Jericho and for us all the
[1:27:11] seals are open and this proves by the
[1:27:14] temp we're in this land of the Holy
[1:27:16] Ghost and I want to say that's true
[1:27:20] but you know when you rebuild the walls
[1:27:23] and make denominations out of your
[1:27:25] doctrines
[1:27:26] and still won't possess the rest of the
[1:27:29] land
[1:27:30] amen remember there is a curse with
[1:27:33] rebuilding the walls of Jericho
[1:27:35] you will layer that in your firstborn
[1:27:38] and your last child that's what he said
[1:27:41] you know your firstborn and your last
[1:27:43] child will die let me tell you friends
[1:27:45] this is this is what happens death comes
[1:27:48] into account and the young people suffer
[1:27:51] when we refuse to go into all the land
[1:27:54] and we won't just rally around the great
[1:27:58] mysteries of God and say we have the
[1:28:00] mystery truce yet we don't go in and
[1:28:03] discover everything
[1:28:06] that lays in our land
[1:28:10] now
[1:28:11] I wanted to say
[1:28:13] so many are fulfilling and and
[1:28:16] if you heard
[1:28:18] if you heard me preach when I was away
[1:28:20] at brother Ron's how many was either
[1:28:23] there or you was listening in let me see
[1:28:25] your hands probably about half of the
[1:28:28] congregation
[1:28:30] well I will reiterate some of the things
[1:28:32] that I even spoke there
[1:28:34] to the congregation today and for the
[1:28:38] audience that that is here
[1:28:40] but anyway again you know and for you
[1:28:45] that have heard it'll be a reminder for
[1:28:47] the rest of you it'll be something there
[1:28:49] that I want you to grasp
[1:28:51] today with all your heart
[1:28:54] but many are fulfilling that which is
[1:28:57] found in the first chapter of Judges
[1:29:00] where the word neither replaces the word
[1:29:04] nevertheless
[1:29:07] they're basically the same in his
[1:29:10] application in this way it's because so
[1:29:13] many are found there
[1:29:16] um that neither how they possess all of
[1:29:19] the promises but too many of us are
[1:29:22] content with living on the edge of the
[1:29:25] land
[1:29:26] possessing some of the promises but
[1:29:30] neglecting to possess all and allowing
[1:29:33] Canaanites to dwell in what belongs to
[1:29:37] believers
[1:29:40] the Bible would say in the Book of
[1:29:42] Judges neither did Manasseh drive out
[1:29:44] the inhabitants but the Canaanites would
[1:29:46] dwell in the land you see God gave you
[1:29:49] the land but he expects you to drive out
[1:29:52] your enemy he gave you Divine Healing
[1:29:55] but he expects you to take the word and
[1:29:58] with faith apply it and drive out your
[1:30:00] enemy he gave you the promise of the
[1:30:03] Holy Ghost but he expects you to repent
[1:30:06] and turn from your sins and with faith
[1:30:09] believe that the promise of God is for
[1:30:11] you
[1:30:13] you see if the enemy is kept down on
[1:30:16] your health the Covenant gives
[1:30:18] Provisions Isaiah 53 and others that
[1:30:22] says in the New Testament I would that
[1:30:24] you would prosper in health as your soul
[1:30:26] prospers
[1:30:28] you see The Church Must Have Divine
[1:30:31] Healing
[1:30:33] for they must have the Divine healer now
[1:30:37] listen for the resurrection
[1:30:40] because without it there will be no
[1:30:44] Resurrection
[1:30:48] now
[1:30:49] you know I I know
[1:30:53] when you preach things like this
[1:30:56] you can have all kinds of quotes thrown
[1:30:58] at you well you know like you just you
[1:31:02] can't
[1:31:03] you can't major on a minor
[1:31:06] let me just tell you Divine Healing is
[1:31:08] something that is needed
[1:31:11] all I am saying about this is in the
[1:31:13] land
[1:31:15] you say well it's minor I don't care if
[1:31:17] it's not a major town like Jericho but
[1:31:21] AI must be conquered
[1:31:24] amen there's other cities maybe
[1:31:26] Leicester city they all have to be
[1:31:28] conquered
[1:31:29] are you with me sir don't throw any
[1:31:31] don't you throw any quote and say well
[1:31:33] that's not a major it's just a minor
[1:31:35] listen if it's in the land it's
[1:31:37] important
[1:31:38] [Applause]
[1:31:39] I just say if you got the major you
[1:31:42] gotta have the minor
[1:31:44] you see brother random and let me quote
[1:31:46] him as I said if there's no Divine
[1:31:49] Healing there is no Redemption of the
[1:31:52] body you see it's part of the earnest
[1:31:56] money if there's no Divine Healing now
[1:32:00] there is no resurrection of the body
[1:32:03] Divine Healing is the earnest of our
[1:32:05] redeemed body did you ever think of that
[1:32:08] if there's no Divine Healing then when
[1:32:10] you go to the Grave that's all of it
[1:32:13] you'll be there forever in your dust to
[1:32:15] go away and there'll be no more of you
[1:32:18] then he says and it and Jesus lays the
[1:32:21] complete of Salvation the complete of
[1:32:24] Divine Healing I'll tell you what if
[1:32:26] it's in Jesus I want it
[1:32:30] you know one more thing I want to say
[1:32:32] for her for I go too far in this maybe
[1:32:34] Divine Healing is a minor
[1:32:37] but it's only a minor in comparison to
[1:32:40] Salvation
[1:32:42] amen what's more important what is the
[1:32:45] major is getting your soul saved
[1:32:48] but you see it's only a minor in
[1:32:51] comparison to that you see it's a very
[1:32:53] important part
[1:32:57] of the believer's victory
[1:33:00] amen it's it is a very important part
[1:33:03] listen brother Madden said that in Jesus
[1:33:05] lays a complete of Salvation the
[1:33:08] complete Divine Healing and let me just
[1:33:11] say if it's in Jesus I want it
[1:33:15] and let me back up again and say it
[1:33:17] might be minor to you but if you're sick
[1:33:20] this morning
[1:33:23] hey man if you got a death notice from
[1:33:26] the doctor this morning
[1:33:27] hey man if you got a need in your life
[1:33:30] or for your loved one
[1:33:32] come on if you don't even Carol Reagan
[1:33:35] and their daughter Erica
[1:33:37] hey man if you're wrong Spencer it's not
[1:33:40] minor it's major
[1:33:46] and I just say if you would have the
[1:33:48] right kind of feelings for your brother
[1:33:50] or your sister it would be a minor to
[1:33:53] you either it would be a major
[1:33:59] if there was freely some brotherly love
[1:34:02] and brotherly kindness and real concern
[1:34:05] for one another
[1:34:07] we lay on the altar of God and say God
[1:34:10] Amen pour out your blessings
[1:34:17] notice
[1:34:18] says in Jesus laser completes of
[1:34:21] Salvation the complete of Divine Healing
[1:34:23] if there's no Divine Healing now there's
[1:34:27] no resurrection of the Dead
[1:34:29] oh I'd like you to wait over that that's
[1:34:31] right we have the first fruits of our
[1:34:34] inheritance is that right
[1:34:35] the earnest of our salvation
[1:34:39] amen
[1:34:41] now
[1:34:43] if there's no Divine Healing and another
[1:34:46] quotation there is no Resurrection
[1:34:49] now you couldn't disprove that by the
[1:34:52] scripture see I'm arguing the points of
[1:34:55] Christ because we have the earnest of
[1:34:58] our Salvation which is the baptism of
[1:35:01] the Holy Ghost
[1:35:02] amen that is the down payment the
[1:35:05] earnest which holds it secure in heaven
[1:35:07] for us and if there's no Divine Healing
[1:35:09] to make a cancer-ridden body come normal
[1:35:13] and well again there is no resurrection
[1:35:16] of the dead that's right we have no
[1:35:19] Earnest of it at all there's no been no
[1:35:22] plan made for it
[1:35:25] so I'm not just saying Divine Healing is
[1:35:28] a part of the earnest for the rapture
[1:35:30] now that doesn't mean now if you get
[1:35:32] sick and you die that you're not going
[1:35:34] to be resurrected or Rapture no that
[1:35:36] simply means it's the down payment money
[1:35:38] on a new body
[1:35:41] and when you see wage just like the one
[1:35:44] you see the change in a person and the
[1:35:47] desires of the world is gone the short
[1:35:50] skirts and the shorts and the cigarettes
[1:35:53] and the beer is all gone it's a sign of
[1:35:57] the working of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:00] amen now like brother Madam said and who
[1:36:03] is this Melchizedek like you women
[1:36:05] claiming you got the Holy Ghost going
[1:36:08] out here and you're wearing shorts and
[1:36:09] things how could you do it how could the
[1:36:12] spirit of God in you ever let you do
[1:36:14] such a thing as die it just can't be so
[1:36:17] certainly it can't be he's not a filthy
[1:36:21] Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and then when
[1:36:25] you become subject to that Spirit it
[1:36:27] throws your home being subject to that
[1:36:30] spirit and that spirit is nothing in the
[1:36:32] world but the seed word made manifest or
[1:36:35] Quicken Hallelujah Made Alive and when
[1:36:38] the Bible says don't do this the body
[1:36:40] quickly turns to it there's no question
[1:36:42] and what did it it's the earnest of the
[1:36:45] Resurrection this body will be raised up
[1:36:48] again because it's already started it
[1:36:51] was once subject to sin admiring
[1:36:53] corruption but it now has got the
[1:36:55] earnest and it's turned Heavenly now is
[1:36:58] the earnest that you're going in the
[1:37:00] Rapture it's earned us a person laying
[1:37:03] dying nothing left but death that's all
[1:37:07] that can happen and I've seen of Shadows
[1:37:10] of people don't eat up with cancer and
[1:37:12] tuberculosis and see them persons a
[1:37:15] little while after that perfect normal
[1:37:17] and strong if there's no Divine Healing
[1:37:21] there's no Resurrection because Divine
[1:37:23] Healing is the earnest of the
[1:37:26] Resurrection you know what the earnest
[1:37:28] money used on you it's the down payment
[1:37:30] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:37:32] with the stripes we were healed
[1:37:35] man you see it's a double atonement
[1:37:39] it's not only for the soul it's for the
[1:37:41] body
[1:37:43] say well I've been saved in my soul and
[1:37:45] you don't look like it you still you
[1:37:47] still got the pain on and the lipstick
[1:37:50] and the short skirts and the shorts and
[1:37:52] whatever it's not showing
[1:37:55] amen are you with me amen so again you
[1:38:00] see it's a Redemption of the soul and
[1:38:03] the body
[1:38:04] but you notice in the Book of Judges
[1:38:08] it says in the amorites forced
[1:38:11] the children of Dan into the mountain
[1:38:14] and would not allow them or suffer them
[1:38:17] to come down to the valley think of it
[1:38:19] hear hear God's enemies
[1:38:24] amen here these represent a type out
[1:38:27] demon powers
[1:38:30] that they they forced them into the
[1:38:33] mountains and would not let them come
[1:38:35] down in the valley
[1:38:37] you see you cannot bear fruits in the
[1:38:40] mountains it's down in the valleys where
[1:38:43] you bear the fruit
[1:38:45] so if you look at this for a moment hear
[1:38:48] the enemies that they were to drive out
[1:38:52] even though they had entered into the
[1:38:54] land
[1:38:56] I'm trying to give something to you you
[1:38:58] might say brother Tim I've got the Holy
[1:39:00] Ghost I've been filled with God's spirit
[1:39:03] I know the power of Christ and it
[1:39:06] changed me
[1:39:07] but I I'm trying to tell you friends
[1:39:10] that it's it's more than just that
[1:39:13] it's more than just that initial feeling
[1:39:16] of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:17] amen it's a continually living with
[1:39:20] crisis of refilling of his presence it's
[1:39:23] being that dude with power of among high
[1:39:26] again and again and again
[1:39:29] it's bringing you to a fresh and up to
[1:39:32] date experience
[1:39:34] not something you talk about in 50 years
[1:39:37] ago we conquered Jericho and the seals
[1:39:40] were open and bless God I got the
[1:39:42] mystery revealed what about the rest of
[1:39:45] it
[1:39:52] brother Branham
[1:39:53] would take Samson as a type
[1:39:56] and he says
[1:39:58] where he stood there blind and defeated
[1:40:00] and bound
[1:40:02] and typed it with the church today
[1:40:05] and he says I can almost point you to
[1:40:07] church like that helpless defeated and
[1:40:11] blind rejecting the promises rejecting
[1:40:14] the word a church that God promised
[1:40:16] would have power over sickness in my
[1:40:19] name they shall cast out Devils taking
[1:40:21] up a devil and casting him away in the
[1:40:23] blessings he promised to his church
[1:40:26] and because the church has turned from
[1:40:28] prayer meetings and from sincerity and
[1:40:31] made the religion of Christ a tradition
[1:40:33] and it's to it's and it's taken all that
[1:40:37] took all the strength out of it glamor
[1:40:39] has come in our churches and she stands
[1:40:42] defeated
[1:40:44] again in the message Messiah he told us
[1:40:48] you know Joshua was told that every
[1:40:51] place that the the soul of your feet
[1:40:54] shall tread upon that I've given to you
[1:40:58] you see footsteps mean possession
[1:41:01] and that's what I'm preaching to you
[1:41:03] today is Elijah Coast
[1:41:06] amen take another step move a little
[1:41:09] further amen conquer more in your life
[1:41:13] you're going to come to acadis barnia
[1:41:16] you're going to come to this season time
[1:41:18] where you're going to decide am I going
[1:41:21] to let amorites live here
[1:41:23] and keep me from bearing the fruits
[1:41:27] or am I going to take everything God
[1:41:29] said
[1:41:31] now
[1:41:33] he said as we enter the kingdom of God
[1:41:35] God's kingdom taken all the Philistines
[1:41:38] out the unbelievers and all the amorites
[1:41:41] and the malachites and whatever so it
[1:41:43] out of us like that we take possession
[1:41:45] amen I like that say days of Miracles
[1:41:48] are passed you have a right get out of
[1:41:50] me
[1:41:51] I put a footprint there I took over
[1:41:54] there's no such thing as seeing Vision
[1:41:56] get out of here you have malachite I'm
[1:41:58] coming over from there you're pressing
[1:42:00] out you see you're taking over that he
[1:42:04] said from that little that little light
[1:42:06] that is born of you when by the Holy
[1:42:08] Ghost about the size of a button it
[1:42:11] begins to push out and begins to take
[1:42:13] over every part of your being to bring
[1:42:16] it into faith
[1:42:18] you see
[1:42:20] he told it he told us again do you use
[1:42:23] these same principles all the way to the
[1:42:25] end of his ministry when he would come
[1:42:27] and that question answer 64 and say when
[1:42:31] Joshua entered the land of Canaan
[1:42:33] he said don't you let him live
[1:42:36] it's a cute baby little malachite or am
[1:42:38] I right kill it
[1:42:41] amen remember he'll grow up to be an
[1:42:43] amalekite he'll pollute the camp and
[1:42:46] when them little things come back like
[1:42:47] disagreeing with the word of God get rid
[1:42:49] of that thing
[1:42:51] I don't care what denomination it
[1:42:53] belongs to you say Well they're good I
[1:42:55] don't care how good a people they are if
[1:42:57] they're contrary to that word get that
[1:43:00] thing out of you
[1:43:01] it's growing a little a malachite it
[1:43:04] looks cute it looks innocent it looks
[1:43:06] all right but don't you have anything to
[1:43:08] do with it you stay away from it
[1:43:11] well brother Brandon might go down here
[1:43:13] well because I said Just remember any a
[1:43:16] malachite anything that denies the word
[1:43:18] stay away from it have nothing to do
[1:43:21] with it
[1:43:23] Hallelujah
[1:43:26] amen I you know I just want to say you
[1:43:29] know there's a lot of Gossip of unbelief
[1:43:30] today
[1:43:32] and it ain't all coming from
[1:43:33] denominations either
[1:43:36] amen you better tune your ears to the
[1:43:39] word of God and hear what the spirit is
[1:43:41] saying
[1:43:43] no again I just say to the message
[1:43:45] community
[1:43:47] at large where is faith
[1:43:50] where are workings of Miracles
[1:43:53] where is prophecy where is the word of
[1:43:56] knowledge where is Divine Healing where
[1:44:00] is the overcoming life
[1:44:02] power over pornography why why why is it
[1:44:06] that the Holy Ghost is lacking
[1:44:09] you know what instead you see instead of
[1:44:12] them going on into the promise and
[1:44:15] possessing everything that God said they
[1:44:18] made agreements or Leagues with them
[1:44:20] and allowed them to stay and instead of
[1:44:23] driving out and annihilating our enemy
[1:44:26] we bring in the gods of psychology we
[1:44:30] learn how and train people how to live
[1:44:33] with their Devils instead of
[1:44:35] old-fashioned prayer altars and prayer
[1:44:38] meetings and preachers who know how to
[1:44:40] cast out Devils they go back to Egypt
[1:44:43] pulling the knowledge of how to use
[1:44:45] psychology to help their flock
[1:44:48] you see it becomes Reformation
[1:44:52] instead of transformation
[1:44:56] Judges chapter 2 verse 1 I want you to
[1:44:59] read this with me you put it on the
[1:45:01] board if you will
[1:45:03] and here's what the angel the angel
[1:45:04] comes because of this neither
[1:45:08] and the angel Lord came up from gilgal
[1:45:11] to bochum
[1:45:12] and said I made you to go up out of
[1:45:15] Egypt
[1:45:16] and I brought you to the land which I
[1:45:18] swear to your fathers and I said I will
[1:45:20] never break my Covenant with you this
[1:45:23] this is really important for you to
[1:45:25] grasp this is a God that keeps his word
[1:45:29] come on and he says and ye shall make no
[1:45:33] league with inhabitants of this land you
[1:45:36] shall throw down their altars but you
[1:45:39] have not obeyed my voice
[1:45:41] why have you done this
[1:45:44] wherefore I also said I will not drive
[1:45:48] them out before you but they shall be as
[1:45:51] thorns in your sights and their God
[1:45:54] shall be a snare unto you
[1:45:57] because you refuse to possess
[1:46:00] because you said you you said neither
[1:46:03] because it was said of you neither did
[1:46:06] neither would
[1:46:09] they allowed the enemy to live among
[1:46:11] them God said okay I won't drive them
[1:46:14] out
[1:46:15] I'll leave you to your own misery they
[1:46:18] will be thorns in your side and their
[1:46:21] gods will be a snare to you
[1:46:25] amen and their gods have become a snare
[1:46:29] because I hear pastors crying
[1:46:31] yeah as a senior pastor myself I hear
[1:46:35] from other pastors I can't get my people
[1:46:38] to come to church
[1:46:40] what do you do
[1:46:41] you know their heads are in gaming and
[1:46:44] movies or even pornographies they'll
[1:46:48] never mature
[1:46:49] they're always making wrong decisions I
[1:46:52] can't get the ladies to wear dresses
[1:46:53] that cover on their knees while standing
[1:46:55] in their city and get them to quit them
[1:46:57] wearing makeup or trimming their hair I
[1:46:59] can't get men to be real fathers
[1:47:01] and leaders in their home and there's no
[1:47:04] family altar they simply refuse to kill
[1:47:07] out the amalekites
[1:47:10] you see nevertheless is the word we're
[1:47:15] using today nevertheless is the same as
[1:47:17] but
[1:47:19] God is good but
[1:47:21] the power of God is real but the Holy
[1:47:25] Ghost is true but
[1:47:30] you see these become words
[1:47:33] and I'm going to show you in the Bible
[1:47:35] there are words that come and twist the
[1:47:39] word of God they see it they Proclaim it
[1:47:42] they say it's right it's a good land yes
[1:47:45] it's there but we can't do it
[1:47:49] and it's because of a minority
[1:47:55] it's an intellectual anointing
[1:47:58] to intellectualize and to dress up and
[1:48:03] sophisticate
[1:48:04] the gospel
[1:48:08] you see
[1:48:09] the spies had searched the lamb for 40
[1:48:11] days now they're unbelief would cause
[1:48:15] them to wonder for 40 years I want you
[1:48:17] to think of that a day of unbelief can
[1:48:19] give you a year of unfruitfulness
[1:48:22] but why did this happen
[1:48:24] it happened because Tim's spies heard
[1:48:28] and then they began to see hear and see
[1:48:32] through the lens and ears of an
[1:48:35] intellectual demonic anointing
[1:48:40] two different Spirits anointing to
[1:48:42] people I'm gonna prove it to you
[1:48:43] look at Numbers Chapter 14 and verse 24.
[1:48:47] but my servant Caleb he had another
[1:48:50] spirit with him
[1:48:54] so I want you to know if he had another
[1:48:56] Spirit then his Spirit was different
[1:48:58] from theirs
[1:49:00] he had a different anointing he had a
[1:49:03] different spirit that these other
[1:49:05] believers who were saying we can't take
[1:49:07] it
[1:49:10] somebody help me preach now
[1:49:12] amen because my servant Caleb he had
[1:49:16] another spirit and he had followed me
[1:49:19] fully him will I bring in the land where
[1:49:21] he and he went and his seat shall
[1:49:23] possess it
[1:49:25] I don't know about you but that's where
[1:49:27] I want to be identified this morning I
[1:49:30] want to be identified with a Caleb
[1:49:33] Hallelujah
[1:49:35] think about it for a moment
[1:49:38] here to be identified with the Caleb
[1:49:41] brother Brandon said Caleb and Joshua
[1:49:43] represents the True Believers that
[1:49:45] stayed with Moses
[1:49:50] I'm represented right there
[1:49:52] that's my representation
[1:49:54] that's a word that speaks of me
[1:49:56] somebody help me preach amen two Spirits
[1:49:59] one's the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:01] and it anointed Hallelujah it anointed
[1:50:05] their eyes the eyes of men like Joshua
[1:50:09] and Caleb not to even they made no
[1:50:11] mention of giants they made no mention
[1:50:14] of Walled cities they made no mention
[1:50:16] all of any kind of obstacle that laid in
[1:50:20] front of them come on somebody oh they
[1:50:23] saw was the fruits all they saw is my
[1:50:27] Godly healer my God to deliver my God's
[1:50:30] a savior my God to reveal us
[1:50:38] but the other spirit
[1:50:40] will come right down and start twisting
[1:50:42] what they saw and what they heard
[1:50:47] foreign
[1:50:48] and if you're not careful
[1:50:50] you can sit in a church service just
[1:50:52] like this
[1:50:54] and while the anointed word is going
[1:50:56] forth an intellectual demons sit right
[1:50:58] there on your ear and twist everything
[1:50:59] that has been said unto the anointing
[1:51:04] amen
[1:51:07] wow brother Tim every time you hear
[1:51:09] every time I hear you preach about Judas
[1:51:13] hop to Judas every time you preach about
[1:51:16] Cain I'm the king
[1:51:19] why do you want to identify yourself
[1:51:21] there
[1:51:23] come on Amen that you see but Satan will
[1:51:27] anoint that ear placing doubt
[1:51:30] you know yeah Judas went all the way and
[1:51:33] Judas had Miracles and Judas had signs
[1:51:35] and Judas believed in Judas was
[1:51:37] justified Judas who Sanctified but he
[1:51:40] didn't know yeah and you know that's
[1:51:41] going to be me brother Tim
[1:51:44] I just can't make it
[1:51:46] I just can't it just won't work for me
[1:51:49] it just ain't for me
[1:51:51] this word isn't for me
[1:51:54] let me tell you God didn't bring you to
[1:51:57] this point
[1:52:00] he didn't give you this opportunity
[1:52:03] amen and you turn around and say it's
[1:52:06] not for me
[1:52:08] no sir he gave you this opportunity he
[1:52:10] lets you hear the word of God where you
[1:52:13] can decide it's for me
[1:52:16] amount it's my promise it's my word it's
[1:52:19] my Deliverance
[1:52:21] amen the Holy Ghost is mine the power
[1:52:25] over sin is mine the power of the Holy
[1:52:27] Ghost to heal the sick is mine
[1:52:33] you got to hear what the spirit says
[1:52:36] just make sure what you're hearing is
[1:52:39] the word
[1:52:40] not something not a word Twisted by a
[1:52:43] demon because he will come and twist it
[1:52:48] Tim spies saw and hurt to the eyes and
[1:52:51] the ears of a demonic anointing
[1:52:54] this demon will take you out of church
[1:52:58] he will kill your children with death
[1:53:01] the 10 came under anointing of the of an
[1:53:04] evil spirit and said we can't take it
[1:53:07] you see they were still controlled by
[1:53:10] slavery
[1:53:11] in their minds they weren't conquerors
[1:53:16] they saw themselves as poor helpless
[1:53:19] slaves
[1:53:20] instead of God's Own beloved Sons
[1:53:26] they saw themselves as defeated
[1:53:29] as that has happened years of history
[1:53:32] and generations of failure
[1:53:36] of 400 years of failure and being in
[1:53:40] slavery that's how they viewed
[1:53:42] themselves
[1:53:43] they were because of an anointing began
[1:53:46] to anoint their seeking to seek as a
[1:53:50] slave instead of a mighty conqueror
[1:53:53] [Applause]
[1:53:58] no
[1:54:00] you see
[1:54:02] they were still controlled
[1:54:04] by their slave owners
[1:54:07] that slave owner that would whip them
[1:54:09] and say you can never do this
[1:54:11] you'll never be anything you will never
[1:54:14] overcome this you will never rise up
[1:54:16] above it that would beat them down and
[1:54:19] keep them in bondage and say you're
[1:54:22] worthless you your mama was a slave your
[1:54:25] daddy was a slave your granddaddy was a
[1:54:27] savior great-granddaddy was a slave you
[1:54:30] will always be a slave you can never
[1:54:32] break the cycle I'm going to tell you
[1:54:34] friend don't you listen to that
[1:54:37] hallelujah amen God has come down and
[1:54:40] said you're my children
[1:54:42] and because you are Sons Hallelujah I'm
[1:54:46] bringing you into the Abduction of sons
[1:54:48] I want you to realize your sonship and
[1:54:51] who you'll be allowed to
[1:54:53] [Applause]

[1:54:59] slave mentality it'll just keep beating
[1:55:02] your down
[1:55:04] you'll only live in defeat
[1:55:07] you're not a Slave
[1:55:09] your name isn't defeat

[1:59:41] studying and and I was just listening to
[1:59:43] the Bible
[1:59:44] I'll just give you a little hint I like
[1:59:46] I like Reese's Chronological Bible and
[1:59:49] you know it's uh it's read and
[1:59:52] dramatized form on on
[1:59:54] um on YouTube
[1:59:56] and I go through the Bible listening to
[1:59:58] that
[1:59:59] it's King James
[2:00:01] dramatize that has different voices and
[2:00:04] different ones when the man speaks a
[2:00:06] woman speaks nice
[2:00:08] and I'm I'm listening to all of the
[2:00:10] genealogies you know the genealogy of
[2:00:13] the so-and-so begat so and so and so and
[2:00:15] so beget so and so and and I you know
[2:00:18] and you know and I'm thinking that I
[2:00:19] could care less who began who
[2:00:24] you know I I don't know who they are and
[2:00:26] what they are and whatever I finally
[2:00:28] glad it finally got to Jesus because I'd
[2:00:31] reckon recognize that
[2:00:34] but all of these began who began who
[2:00:36] began who in the middle of that begotten
[2:00:38] who if mentioned a man by the name of
[2:00:40] Jabez
[2:00:42] and Jay Bells was named Sorrow by his
[2:00:48] mother
[2:00:50] amen she named him such looking for
[2:00:54] Scranton Chronicles four and nine and
[2:00:55] you can mark it in your Bible some of
[2:00:57] you need to hear this

[2:01:40] listen
[2:01:41] the book of Joseph the Bible comes here
[2:01:44] and all of a sudden breaks with all the
[2:01:46] begets and it mentions a man by the name
[2:01:49] of Jabez
[2:01:50] and Jabez was more honorable than his
[2:01:52] brethren
[2:01:54] now what made him more honorable it
[2:01:55] wasn't because what his mother called
[2:01:57] him
[2:01:58] his mother said he called him sorrow
[2:02:01] because I bear him with sorrow
[2:02:04] you know people I name you a lot of
[2:02:07] different names

[2:02:16] accept it amen he had that name but look
[2:02:19] what he did with it verse 10 and if she

[2:05:34] bondage
[2:05:35] and your sorrows
[2:05:38] you know
[2:05:40] he'll even anoint preachers gifted men
[2:05:44] where the anointed word of the prophet
[2:05:48] of God will be twisted in the intellect
[2:05:50] until they won't even believe in altar
[2:05:53] calls anymore
[2:05:54] our prayer lines
[2:05:57] they don't know faith
[2:05:59] no workings of Miracles nothing it is

[2:06:41] have dancing in the spirit you can have

[2:06:51] the blessings of God you can have it all
[2:06:55] [Applause]
[2:06:57] is for all his children
[2:07:00] it's not just for evening in my
[2:07:01] Tabernacle
[2:07:04] but listen I can't help it the politics
[2:07:07] of your church won't allow you to enjoy
[2:07:09] your religion
[2:07:12] brother Branham recognized the need for
[2:07:14] his church
[2:07:16] he said in 1959
[2:07:18] speaking in Clarksville he said I see
[2:07:21] some of the Tabernacles folks here I'm
[2:07:23] going to say this about the big sisters
[2:07:25] one thing the Tabernacle needs up there
[2:07:27] at our church at Jeffersonville the
[2:07:30] Tabernacle at Jeff is a rededication and
[2:07:33] a refilling of the Holy Ghost everyone
[2:07:36] get down to the Altar and pray until
[2:07:38] they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:39] and the whole church be filled with the
[2:07:42] power of God that's what we need not
[2:07:44] only the Tabernacle here but the body of
[2:07:46] Christ Universal it needs a refilling
[2:07:50] that means even in light Tabernacle amen
[2:07:53] I like I like David said one day restore
[2:07:55] to me the joy of my salvation now he had
[2:07:59] not lost his salvation but the joy of it
[2:08:01] and when it comes to places I can't
[2:08:03] enjoy my religion my salvation there's
[2:08:05] something wrong somewhere because it's
[2:08:07] joy unspeakable and full of Glory one of
[2:08:10] them said taste and see the Lord is good
[2:08:13] it tastes like Honey in the Rock oh I'm
[2:08:15] so glad I tasted that the Lord is good
[2:08:18] and I love honey but I've never tasted
[2:08:21] any like that that's the best that I
[2:08:23] know
[2:08:24] yeah as he was approaching the Holy
[2:08:27] Ghost series for his own church in 59.
[2:08:30] he's he was there in San Jose and he had
[2:08:33] this to say we're to leave for home
[2:08:34] right away I've got a three-day meeting
[2:08:36] there and my little church teaching the
[2:08:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in
[2:08:40] tongues signs and wonders to follow the
[2:08:43] Believers and so forth of the people
[2:08:45] that's around in there I believe in all
[2:08:47] the spiritual gifts I believe in all the
[2:08:49] Bible I'm Pentecost from the top of my
[2:08:52] head to the bottom of my feet inside
[2:08:54] outside all around through through I am
[2:08:57] Pentecostal
[2:08:59] amen I'm just saying you can have this
[2:09:02] revival for your church
[2:09:04] it's for the bride it is an exclusive
[2:09:07] for us
[2:09:08] amen so someone is safe you know I you
[2:09:11] know we we're having a false Revival
[2:09:13] because they believe the Revival is over
[2:09:17] but if you just take a thorough study of
[2:09:19] the subject that's all our house be a
[2:09:21] student
[2:09:23] you know you know search out the land
[2:09:27] you know that don't don't just take one
[2:09:29] little quote or a little something or
[2:09:31] something said about the amorites and
[2:09:33] jebusites and try to apply it to the
[2:09:35] bride
[2:09:36] come on
[2:09:38] a man so he said in the message he said
[2:09:41] uh and the Escape hither come quickly he
[2:09:44] said now we're speaking on Babylon and
[2:09:47] the handwriting the wall and we're here
[2:09:49] today we can almost feel the hot wings
[2:09:51] of judgment blowing in our face the
[2:09:54] world has come to an end there's not a
[2:09:56] hope for the world outside of the coming
[2:09:58] of the Lord Jesus that's the only hope
[2:10:00] you can put an Eisenhower in every
[2:10:03] country County and America will still
[2:10:05] Wade in sin
[2:10:07] I'm not looking for any great Revival
[2:10:09] the thing of it is the Revival has come
[2:10:12] and gone and you didn't know it it's
[2:10:13] always been that you you look for
[2:10:15] something that's Satan kept saying
[2:10:17] there'll be greater over here and
[2:10:18] greater over here in his past right by
[2:10:20] you did not John the Baptist come on the
[2:10:22] earth and even the righteous did not
[2:10:24] recognize him did not Delight disciples
[2:10:26] say when will Elijah come and he says
[2:10:28] already come and you didn't know it the
[2:10:30] Revival is just about over don't look
[2:10:32] for nothing greater we've already got
[2:10:34] the greatest thing in heaven the Holy
[2:10:37] Spirit manifests in himself in this
[2:10:39] generation there's nothing else it can
[2:10:42] be done
[2:10:43] because why anything else is going to be
[2:10:46] more of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:48] it won't be out of the land of the Holy
[2:10:50] Ghost
[2:10:51] are you with me amen now again he said
[2:10:54] and I'm just bringing these out because
[2:10:57] he says now in the in Shreveport and an
[2:11:00] invisible Union and it is one of his
[2:11:02] last sermons now we're looking forward
[2:11:04] to the coming of the Lord in our
[2:11:06] generation I'm not looking for Revival
[2:11:09] in our generation I'm looking for the
[2:11:11] coming of the Lord in our generation
[2:11:14] I want you to know once more the coming
[2:11:17] of the Lord is our Revival
[2:11:22] it's not just a healing Revival
[2:11:25] amen it's the coming of the lord it's
[2:11:27] the mighty Angel descending
[2:11:30] amen it's the power of the almighty and
[2:11:32] the same sermon now I want to give you
[2:11:34] the other side that's one side of it now
[2:11:37] let me let me go into the same sermon a
[2:11:39] little later on down he said some of you
[2:11:41] people that really believe this is the
[2:11:43] truth
[2:11:44] that we're entered into another age
[2:11:46] we're entering the Rapture age you know
[2:11:49] the church can't go in his condition and
[2:11:52] it can't get any better it must get
[2:11:54] worse how many knows that
[2:11:56] Say Amen
[2:11:58] well it's got worse it's got to get
[2:12:01] worse and it can't go on like this it's
[2:12:03] got to be something and it's moving
[2:12:06] right now friend it's on the move is on
[2:12:10] for the bride that's the truth that's
[2:12:12] that's saith the Lord
[2:12:15] so the Revival's over for the church
[2:12:19] the Revival's over for the nation you
[2:12:22] can put good men in every County it'll
[2:12:24] never turn it back
[2:12:26] you can go take over your school boards
[2:12:29] and it won't turn it back you can go
[2:12:31] around and be elected as in the Senate
[2:12:33] and it won't bring it back you can get
[2:12:36] somebody else in the presidency and it
[2:12:38] won't bring it back
[2:12:42] amen you're not going to revive America
[2:12:44] you're not going to revive the world
[2:12:46] but you can revive the bride
[2:12:51] the move is on for the bride that's
[2:12:54] that's saith the Lord
[2:12:56] amen amen
[2:12:58] [Music]
[2:12:59] so you see
[2:13:01] many will point to America's rejection
[2:13:04] of the Holy Spirit the Pentecostal move
[2:13:07] that rejected the word as a premise for
[2:13:10] the argument
[2:13:12] you know
[2:13:14] that that that's just a false Revival
[2:13:16] but I just want to say I just want to
[2:13:19] say yeah there's a false Revival
[2:13:22] but that means there has to be a true
[2:13:24] Revival
[2:13:25] you can't have a counterfeit unless you
[2:13:28] have a real
[2:13:29] but brother Benham tells us every fresh
[2:13:32] and true Revival will be because men
[2:13:36] have gotten back to the word for their
[2:13:39] age and I just want to say we don't deny
[2:13:42] any word
[2:13:44] we have to hold every mystery truth amen
[2:13:48] we believe the seals are open that
[2:13:51] Partners have sounded their voices we
[2:13:54] believe in predestination eternal
[2:13:56] security serpent sea every bit of it all
[2:13:59] of it from Genesis to revelation
[2:14:02] so we're not word deniers
[2:14:05] so we can have Revival
[2:14:07] this message is our Revival
[2:14:10] Amen brother Brandon would come up in
[2:14:13] the third ceiling he said the bride
[2:14:15] hasn't had a Revival yet there's been
[2:14:17] the Revival no manifestation of God to
[2:14:20] stir the bride yet we'll take those
[2:14:23] seven unknown Thunders back there to
[2:14:25] wake her up again I'll tell you what
[2:14:27] when the message came and the Thunders
[2:14:29] uttered their voices and it opened up
[2:14:32] the Seven Seals and gave you an Open
[2:14:33] Bible
[2:14:34] somebody with me amen it started causing
[2:14:38] a Revival right then
[2:14:40] the reason why this church exists is
[2:14:43] because of that Revival
[2:14:45] hallelujah amen and so you see the
[2:14:49] voices of Thunders revealed the mystery
[2:14:51] it calls the Revival and we have had the
[2:14:54] mechanics
[2:14:56] amen but now the Dynamics is falling on
[2:15:00] the word that we have heard

[2:15:13] didn't have to whistle
[2:15:15] amen and if you ain't got enough fire to
[2:15:18] to blow out the whistle you ain't got no
[2:15:20] fire in your box
[2:15:22] amen you've got dead ashes of a pastoral
[2:15:25] Bible
[2:15:29] tells us
[2:15:30] and hear you him
[2:15:32] he says placing of a son
[2:15:35] he said take him out have us in a
[2:15:38] certain place have a ceremony before
[2:15:40] Angels placing positionally what he is
[2:15:43] in the body then that person has the
[2:15:45] authority let me say this if you call me
[2:15:47] a fanatic from this night on the very
[2:15:49] same thing that I'm speaking of will be
[2:15:51] done there will be a power put in the
[2:15:54] church and now it's coming in that the
[2:15:57] Holy Spirit was so anoint the people
[2:15:59] till they'll speak the word and it'll
[2:16:01] create itself right there we haven't
[2:16:04] seen Powers like coming into the church
[2:16:06] now I know it for a fact
[2:16:09] amen say to this mountain don't that be
[2:16:13] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[2:16:14] believe what you said will come to pass
[2:16:16] you can have what you said the placing
[2:16:18] of the church in position with the
[2:16:20] fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:22] comes and where the fullness of the
[2:16:24] power of the Holy Ghost comes into the
[2:16:26] church then critics Mouse will be shut
[2:16:28] it'll be a short time Jesus came right
[2:16:30] off the mountain went straight to
[2:16:32] Calgary it won't last long but it'll be

[2:16:39] we're in it
[2:16:40] it's happening
[2:16:42] amen you don't have to wait for some
[2:16:44] squeeze
[2:16:46] if you look around you're already being
[2:16:47] squeezed
[2:16:49] you don't have to wait for more
[2:16:50] persecution
[2:16:52] hey man if you look around and you

[2:16:56] realize you're being persecuted
[2:16:58] are you with me amen you don't have to
[2:17:01] wait on nothing
[2:17:02] it's here the move is out
[2:17:06] speak to this mountain brother Brandon
[2:17:08] said I believe the Church of the Living
[2:17:09] God is moving into a sphere that's going
[2:17:12] to shake the whole world that's the
[2:17:14] first time it's been since the days of
[2:17:16] Jesus and Nazareth to a human being ask
[2:17:18] anything you will it shall be given to
[2:17:20] you anything you desire don't you see
[2:17:22] the words of Jesus Christ being
[2:17:24] fulfilled or it's going to come to pass
[2:17:26] pretty soon I'm looking forward to
[2:17:27] happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to
[2:17:30] happen now that that anointing will
[2:17:32] strike the whole Church of the Living
[2:17:34] God and shall raised her feet like a
[2:17:37] mighty marching Army the sick will be
[2:17:39] healed by word the blind will see the
[2:17:41] death will hear the dead will be raised
[2:17:44] up in the power of God will shake the
[2:17:46] world with the Church of the Living God
[2:17:48] we're in the process of it now I believe
[2:17:50] it's soon coming to pass I will believe
[2:17:52] it will be exactly that way I believe
[2:17:54] it's going to strike the Church of God
[2:17:56] soon it's going to start a Revival
[2:17:58] that'll shake the world and we have it
[2:18:01] this is it
[2:18:06] so well that was before the seals we'll
[2:18:09] try the indictment then after the seals
[2:18:11] May there come forth a Revival of the
[2:18:14] justice and a great power come among the
[2:18:17] church just before it's going it's not
[2:18:19] hard to pray that because you promised
[2:18:22] it and we're looking for it Lord that
[2:18:25] third pool that we know will do great
[2:18:27] thing in our midst but you know what the
[2:18:29] problem is they don't want it
[2:18:33] they don't want it it's like when Jesus
[2:18:37] went across the sea because he had heard
[2:18:41] the cry
[2:18:43] of one man
[2:18:46] who came to a a man who was a mental
[2:18:49] case
[2:18:51] who was a maniac
[2:18:53] living among the tombs and he came to
[2:18:58] his senses and nothing and one day just
[2:19:00] to say God help me and he went back into
[2:19:04] his insanity
[2:19:07] but you know what God happened to be on
[2:19:09] earth

[2:19:17] here

[2:19:24] here where is it not in Bradford
[2:19:29] Hallelujah there he was
[2:19:36] way across the sea
[2:19:39] nobody could have heard it
[2:19:42] but he did
[2:19:45] you think God don't hear your cry
[2:19:48] listen if he'll hear the Cry of an
[2:19:50] unsafe maniac
[2:19:52] there happened to be a seed of God he'll
[2:19:54] hear the Privacy to God that's already
[2:19:56] saved

[2:20:01] it out God help me
[2:20:03] God help me
[2:20:06] amen oh he will come all the way across

[2:20:21] office and say son it's your offer it's

[2:20:33] he ain't gonna leave our hook behind
[2:20:36] he's not going to leave you where you're
[2:20:38] at that's why he calls time at the time
[2:20:41] after time at the time
[2:20:46] because God ain't content but you just
[2:20:48] haven't landed the Devils dwell on
[2:20:55] that become thorns in your side
[2:21:04] he hears a cry of this maniac
[2:21:07] somebody with me
[2:21:09] and as he hears the cry
[2:21:11] they come across he here he goes and he
[2:21:14] says I got to go to the other side boys
[2:21:17] and he gets in the boat
[2:21:19] well the devil heard it too
[2:21:22] so he gets in the Wind
[2:21:25] I don't care what the devil does he
[2:21:27] can't stop
[2:21:29] when Jesus is on his way

[2:21:49] they ain't enough to be left of the
[2:21:51] enemy that can stop Jesus when he's on
[2:21:54] his way

[2:22:19] preacher for one sermon to touch your
[2:22:21] heart to turn you back
[2:22:23] to believe in again
[2:22:25] to raise your faith
[2:22:28] to tell you he's a Bible Jesus a Bible
[2:22:31] God with a Bible promise and the Bible
[2:22:34] days are right here because we are here
[2:22:36] living it out

[2:22:59] yeah come on now oh I wish he would
[2:23:03] speak he's going to use your voice

[2:23:13] this word may provisions
[2:23:16] to speak to the storm
[2:23:19] and it go back
[2:23:28] he goes out there
[2:23:30] this one man
[2:23:32] hears us cry he hears his cry this one
[2:23:35] man
[2:23:37] goes across the sea
[2:23:39] he'll leave all of Heaven for one

[2:23:46] he'll come right down to you in your
[2:23:47] need
[2:23:49] for you
[2:23:51] and here he comes
[2:23:53] and of course
[2:23:55] you know what he does
[2:23:57] there's a bunch of hog razors there
[2:24:01] are so happy with their Hogs and their
[2:24:03] Hogs and their living and the riches and
[2:24:05] the riches from their Hogs
[2:24:07] and the slop that they've eaten
[2:24:10] they're so happy with the hallways and
[2:24:13] the slop pins
[2:24:15] Devils all around
[2:24:19] they don't want no devil cast out
[2:24:21] might cost him something
[2:24:24] might cost them their prestige
[2:24:27] might cost them their riches
[2:24:30] it might it might make them embarrassed
[2:24:34] are you with me amen you know what
[2:24:36] brother brother Branham said brother
[2:24:38] Branham said they had their Hogs and and
[2:24:40] I'm just going to paraphrase some of the
[2:24:42] things that he said about it he said
[2:24:44] they have their Hawks
[2:24:46] they're slopped pens and they felt more
[2:24:49] comfortable with devils
[2:24:51] that they did with Jesus
[2:24:54] because when Jesus casts out them Devils
[2:24:57] they went into the Hawks and the Hogs
[2:25:01] you know what I'm going to say committed
[2:25:04] suicide
[2:25:06] yeah say it brother else
[2:25:09] suicide
[2:25:11] that's how you call a Hobbs they
[2:25:14] committed suicide
[2:25:16] and here here that you know that lost
[2:25:18] all their Hogs you know you might you
[2:25:21] might lose your prestige
[2:25:23] when the devil gets cast out of you come
[2:25:25] on when the devil leaves your your
[2:25:28] country when it leaves the church a man
[2:25:31] that might be crying that might be
[2:25:33] sounding there might be dad said you
[2:25:36] might lose your prestige but I tell you
[2:25:39] I'd Rather Have Jesus in a bunch of
[2:25:41] homes and live in the presence of devils
[2:25:49] he said they felt more comfortable than
[2:25:51] they did when Jesus was there
[2:25:54] so they told him leave leave we don't
[2:25:57] want you here it's costing us too much
[2:25:59] why you go to a big formal church today
[2:26:02] and let two or three people get in there
[2:26:04] and go to praising God and shouting
[2:26:05] going on like that maybe someone give a
[2:26:08] message in tongues and somebody get
[2:26:09] healed by the power of God or give a
[2:26:11] vision why they just freeze them to
[2:26:13] death
[2:26:14] well I don't want nothing like that
[2:26:16] better at home with the Devils that's
[2:26:18] right than to have the lovely Jesus
[2:26:20] around
[2:26:21] You Preach to them like that and they
[2:26:22] just sit like a wart on a pickle just a
[2:26:24] sour and cold as they can be nobody
[2:26:26] would say Amen or nothing just freeze up
[2:26:28] and freeze down he said I wish you would
[2:26:31] quit while he he's been up there 15
[2:26:33] minutes now how long in 15 minutes Matt
[2:26:35] Watkins
[2:26:38] amen and when is he going to stop
[2:26:42] you see you see he said I can see the
[2:26:45] legion after he comes to his right mind
[2:26:47] he's got healed I could see after he
[2:26:50] keeps waving to Jesus the devil them
[2:26:53] peoples come down and said we don't want
[2:26:55] you around here we want the Hogs we'd
[2:26:58] rather have our Hawks we don't want no
[2:27:01] more or no such Revival is that all this
[2:27:04] here nonsense Divine Healing we know the
[2:27:07] days of Miracles has passed that's man's
[2:27:10] only worked out now get out of our land
[2:27:13] we don't want none of that Holy Roller
[2:27:15] stuff started over here he said Jesus
[2:27:18] won't stay
[2:27:19] don't worry
[2:27:21] where he's not welcome he won't stay
[2:27:25] you know I'm shouting rejoicing
[2:27:28] speaking in tongues
[2:27:30] you don't want the movement of the
[2:27:32] spirit in your church he won't stay
[2:27:34] you can kick him out he'll be the
[2:27:37] unwelcome Christ you can be just like
[2:27:38] laodicea and reject him
[2:27:43] amen oh
[2:27:47] you know so
[2:27:49] let's get into our topic
[2:27:52] verse 31 but the people but the men said
[2:27:55] the men that went up with him said
[2:27:58] we're not able to go up against these
[2:28:00] people
[2:28:01] for they are stronger than us
[2:28:04] we can't do it
[2:28:07] our young people
[2:28:09] can't overcome in this age
[2:28:11] the Holy Ghost can't keep them
[2:28:14] not Church you think I'm making this up
[2:28:17] but I've heard preachers in the Pulpit
[2:28:18] say the Holy Ghost we got today just
[2:28:21] can't it's not it's not powerful enough
[2:28:24] to make you live right
[2:28:27] and I'm sitting there and I say who
[2:28:29] wants that then
[2:28:31] I don't want that kind of Holy Ghost
[2:28:33] Holy Ghost I believe in seals you to the
[2:28:36] day of redemption seal Satan out seals
[2:28:38] you in
[2:28:39] amen oh well our people can't overcome
[2:28:42] in this age the Holy Ghost can't keep
[2:28:44] them but they can't Rise Above This
[2:28:46] field it's too hard I tell you what
[2:28:49] we'll just do we'll give them some
[2:28:50] psychology to help them cope
[2:28:52] we will give them some sessions to learn
[2:28:56] how to control their sexual habits
[2:29:01] so they try Reformation
[2:29:05] instead of transformation
[2:29:08] because there's a big difference between
[2:29:10] reform and somebody
[2:29:12] and transforming somebody
[2:29:15] transforming power comes by the power of
[2:29:18] the Holy Ghost Reformation comes by men
[2:29:22] conforming you to what they want you to
[2:29:24] be
[2:29:25] so you see in their hearts they went
[2:29:27] back
[2:29:28] to Egypt
[2:29:30] and when they went back in their hearts
[2:29:34] they begin to remember the flesh pots
[2:29:38] that was there
[2:29:40] you see when we believe and we just give
[2:29:45] a mental asset Ascent to the message and
[2:29:49] we believe that's the Holy Ghost
[2:29:52] and porn then is too strong for us and
[2:29:55] we can't help but be lukewarm
[2:29:58] and you see we we got church order here
[2:30:01] and we we ain't got no power against
[2:30:03] sickness because healing was only for
[2:30:05] the messenger and that word isn't in
[2:30:08] season anymore you see this is what the
[2:30:11] Bible said in verse 32 and they brought
[2:30:13] up an evil report
[2:30:16] of the land which they had searched the
[2:30:19] lamb through which they we have gone to
[2:30:22] search it is a land that eateth up the
[2:30:24] inhabitants thereof and all the people
[2:30:27] that we saw in it are men of great
[2:30:30] stature and we saw Giants and the sons
[2:30:33] of anak which come of the Giants and we
[2:30:37] were in our own sight
[2:30:39] I want you to notice they have a
[2:30:41] different sight
[2:30:43] because we are anointed with a different
[2:30:45] spirit
[2:30:48] and so he said and we were grasshoppers
[2:30:51] in their sight
[2:30:54] now numbers 14 1 and the call the
[2:30:58] congregation lifted up their voice and
[2:31:02] cried and the people wept that night and
[2:31:06] all the children of Israel murmured
[2:31:08] against Moses
[2:31:11] and against Aaron and the whole
[2:31:12] congregation said unto them would the
[2:31:15] god that we that died in the land of
[2:31:17] Egypt
[2:31:18] or would God we had died in this
[2:31:22] Wilderness wherefore hath the Lord
[2:31:25] brought us into this land to Fall by the
[2:31:29] sword that our wives and our children
[2:31:33] should be a prey worry it not better for
[2:31:36] us to return into Egypt and they said to
[2:31:39] one another let us make a captain and
[2:31:43] let us return unto Egypt
[2:31:46] now returning to Egypt
[2:31:49] means look God was our captain
[2:31:53] Captain is a leader
[2:31:56] and the pillar of fire had led them
[2:31:58] there and the pillar of fire had
[2:32:00] directed them to this place and the
[2:32:03] pillar of fire had given them that line
[2:32:05] and here Joshua just when Caleb are
[2:32:07] going in there led by a pillar of Fire
[2:32:10] but these men
[2:32:13] but these men reject God's leadership
[2:32:18] without the leadership of God they could
[2:32:20] have never left Egyptian bondage
[2:32:23] amen have to receiving the law Mount
[2:32:26] Sinai these people they willingly
[2:32:28] affirmed all that God has spoken we will
[2:32:30] do we will be obedient and here he said
[2:32:33] go take the land and they said we can't
[2:32:38] we don't want God's leadership no more
[2:32:42] we'll just go back to Egypt make us
[2:32:44] captain make us another leader we want
[2:32:46] another leader than God
[2:32:50] and in this crisis listening to the
[2:32:53] voice of reason
[2:32:56] and under demonic anointing they
[2:32:58] hurriedly rejected God's leadership
[2:33:02] that they said let us appoint a leader
[2:33:04] in return to Egypt
[2:33:07] they had a leader and God was her leader
[2:33:11] and they didn't like it but they didn't
[2:33:13] like it where he was leading them to
[2:33:15] them
[2:33:18] they would only go so far
[2:33:21] I wonder today
[2:33:23] after 60 years of mechanics
[2:33:27] of laying the word on top of word
[2:33:30] dissecting it like Israel did receiving
[2:33:33] the law
[2:33:34] and we understand today by God's grace
[2:33:37] having a perfect interpretation of the
[2:33:40] word of God
[2:33:42] we understand predestination
[2:33:45] eternal security baptism in the name of
[2:33:47] Jesus Christ
[2:33:49] and we walk right up to the Border of
[2:33:52] the fullness of the spirit
[2:33:54] why why do we want to go back
[2:33:58] to Egypt again
[2:34:01] I want to just get it to you
[2:34:03] I want you to realize look in their
[2:34:05] minds no longer was Egypt the enemy
[2:34:13] the enemy was now God
[2:34:16] Moses Joshua and Caleb
[2:34:20] or anyone that says we can have the Holy
[2:34:23] Ghost in his power
[2:34:26] you see they just dismissed that as a
[2:34:30] motion
[2:34:32] we can't cast out Devils we don't have
[2:34:35] the stomach to face Giants
[2:34:38] so we don't want prayer lines we can't
[2:34:40] speak with new tongues we can't have
[2:34:43] prophecy the Holy Ghost we want is just
[2:34:46] to say we believe the message
[2:34:49] we don't want it
[2:34:51] we want it without feeling
[2:34:54] we can't have an experience that's the
[2:34:57] way we got it in Egypt
[2:34:59] brother Adam said in Paul Moore I'm
[2:35:01] Locus and caterpillar he said there's no
[2:35:04] place in the Bible where they ever
[2:35:06] receive the Holy Ghost without having
[2:35:08] emotion speaking with tongues and
[2:35:09] shouting and praisins of God and
[2:35:11] prophecies and manifestations they never
[2:35:13] just did walk up and shake hands with
[2:35:15] the preacher and walk away
[2:35:19] he says in the message thirst I'll give
[2:35:21] you one and at the end of his ministry
[2:35:23] he said wait until that satisfaction
[2:35:26] comes that satisfaction portion of the
[2:35:29] fullness of the Holy Ghost comes in then
[2:35:31] the joy bells are shouting speaking in
[2:35:34] tongues dancing in the spirit will come
[2:35:36] you won't have to do it in by the music
[2:35:38] you will do it when you're going down
[2:35:40] the road in your car you will do it when
[2:35:42] you're sweeping the floor you will do it
[2:35:43] when you're driving the nails in the
[2:35:45] wall with your carpenter work wherever
[2:35:47] you are that joy unspeakable and full of
[2:35:49] Glory
[2:35:51] amount
[2:35:52] he talks about it in the future home
[2:35:55] what a mighty message that is how that
[2:35:57] the heavens and earth will pass away and
[2:35:59] it'll change forms and he's and he
[2:36:02] equates it until he said you know when a
[2:36:04] man receives a baptism of fire there's a
[2:36:07] lot of noise around there they think
[2:36:09] that's a shame to hear people scream and
[2:36:12] shout like that just wait until the
[2:36:14] Earth gets her baptism
[2:36:18] you know I have I have preachers that
[2:36:20] tell me
[2:36:21] and this is no lie brother Tim you only
[2:36:24] quote statements that fits your
[2:36:27] narrative
[2:36:29] I just want to say that's what Jesus did
[2:36:34] hello
[2:36:36] I only quote things that fits my
[2:36:39] narrative
[2:36:41] that's what Jesus did
[2:36:43] when Jesus was baptized
[2:36:45] baptized on the River Jordan but John he
[2:36:49] was endued with power having been filled
[2:36:52] with the Holy Ghost how many knows
[2:36:53] that's the truth
[2:36:54] and after fasting 40 days he was tempted
[2:36:57] to use his power and he was hungry and
[2:37:00] Satan tempted them to use his power for
[2:37:03] himself and make stones into bread you
[2:37:06] remember that
[2:37:07] and Jesus told Satan it is written
[2:37:12] he gave him a quote
[2:37:16] amen and he said here's my quote
[2:37:19] and it fits my narrative
[2:37:22] man shall not live by bread alone by
[2:37:26] every word
[2:37:29] Hallelujah I want to ask you every word
[2:37:33] do you mean the seals yes everywhere do
[2:37:35] you believe the Thunder yes everywhere
[2:37:37] do you believe predestination everywhere
[2:37:39] do you believe Holiness Everywhere You
[2:37:41] Believe in gifts Everywhere You Believe
[2:37:43] in speaking at times every word
[2:37:45] man shall not live by bread alone bye
[2:37:57] so Satan Jesus told Satan it is written
[2:38:02] man shall live by every word of God
[2:38:05] so Satan said
[2:38:08] you want you like quotes do you I have a
[2:38:11] few mom
[2:38:13] I can use it I can pull it right out of
[2:38:15] the out of the quote book too
[2:38:18] I'm doing my little message search
[2:38:20] and I'll find something that disproves
[2:38:22] what you just said
[2:38:24] you know here it is
[2:38:26] because
[2:38:28] so Satan uses the word
[2:38:30] but he uses the wrong motive
[2:38:33] and he threw a quote back at Jesus
[2:38:38] now I just want to say Satan is stupid
[2:38:42] if he thinks he can defeat Jesus with a
[2:38:45] quote
[2:38:51] try this
[2:38:54] try this your narrative
[2:38:57] let me just say to you you can't hurt me
[2:39:00] with quotes I love quotes
[2:39:04] amen every one of them I love them all
[2:39:06] come on
[2:39:09] I love what he said about the horror but
[2:39:11] I Don't Preach that's for me
[2:39:16] I I love what he said about
[2:39:19] the Lake of Fire and Satan being cast
[2:39:21] into it but that's not for me
[2:39:26] so I when I preach about heaven and what
[2:39:28] and what is for me I don't have to
[2:39:30] preach about hell
[2:39:32] so you're only been in your narrative
[2:39:33] yeah that's my narrative
[2:39:35] Heaven Is Mine
[2:39:39] amen amen
[2:39:42] again Jesus has said man shall live by
[2:39:46] shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:39:49] every word
[2:39:50] wow
[2:39:52] so he told us a quote
[2:39:55] and Jesus said
[2:39:57] but that quote don't fit my narrative
[2:40:06] you know what a narrative is story
[2:40:10] your story
[2:40:12] so that quote don't fit my story
[2:40:16] hello
[2:40:17] you see it was being applied incorrectly
[2:40:22] Jesus would not live
[2:40:24] the word that was quoted by the devil
[2:40:28] amen he knew that Satan mislocated and
[2:40:33] misplaced the word and once it's
[2:40:36] misplaced it is no long no longer the
[2:40:39] word of God is a true of the devil to
[2:40:43] bring defeat
[2:40:46] so Satan tried to use the word with the
[2:40:49] wrong motive
[2:40:53] and the first thing that the devil tried
[2:40:55] to do
[2:40:56] of course is what he's trying to do is
[2:40:58] get him to doubt what had happened in
[2:40:59] the River Jordan that he was the son of
[2:41:02] God
[2:41:04] in other words to doubt his experience
[2:41:06] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that it
[2:41:08] happened on the River Jordan and he says
[2:41:10] cast thyself down here's the word cast
[2:41:13] thyself down leads him up to the temple
[2:41:15] cast yourself down don't you know the
[2:41:18] angels will bear you up lest you
[2:41:21] Dash your foot against a stone it is
[2:41:23] written
[2:41:26] and it was the word it was the quote and
[2:41:28] it's a good quote
[2:41:31] we can preach that quote today it's the
[2:41:35] word of God but it's got to be applied
[2:41:37] right
[2:41:37] [Applause]
[2:41:40] and the devil was misapplying the quote
[2:41:45] come on Amen to get him to fit his
[2:41:50] narrative
[2:41:54] cast ourselves down for it is written
[2:41:57] I'm quoting this
[2:42:00] let me just tell you
[2:42:02] friends
[2:42:03] yes
[2:42:04] it fits my narrative
[2:42:08] that there is a real Holy Ghost
[2:42:13] it fits my story
[2:42:16] that there is Divine Healing it bits my
[2:42:19] story that there's a shot of the king in
[2:42:22] our midst it fits my story that young
[2:42:26] people and old people alike can worship
[2:42:28] God in Freedom that fits my story
[2:42:32] amen
[2:42:34] so don't throw some quote at me that's
[2:42:36] meant for denominations that rejected
[2:42:38] the word or word rejecters and they want
[2:42:41] to shout and reject the word that's not
[2:42:42] us we believe our the word
[2:42:47] try to apply something like that to us
[2:42:50] that doesn't matter that is not our
[2:42:52] story our story is we believe the
[2:42:55] message we believe in production of
[2:42:58] Truth we believe the word
[2:43:00] that's our story
[2:43:08] preachers get embarrassed to hear there
[2:43:10] was shouting and dancing in the spirit
[2:43:13] they're ashamed of being
[2:43:15] in Pentecost
[2:43:18] well brother Branham had some words for
[2:43:20] you
[2:43:21] just before he left
[2:43:23] we noticed today if someone says are you
[2:43:26] a Christian this is from ashamed
[2:43:29] 1965.
[2:43:30] in Jeffersonville
[2:43:33] we noticed today why am I qualifying
[2:43:35] that you know
[2:43:37] because here's what goes
[2:43:39] if it's before the seal well that was
[2:43:41] before the seals that we don't we don't
[2:43:42] believe that
[2:43:43] somebody else we have qualifiers on
[2:43:45] which one we accept and which one we
[2:43:47] don't
[2:43:51] preaching that to denominational group
[2:43:53] and he was just speaking their language
[2:43:56] so you see that's their narrative
[2:43:59] so I'm going to say
[2:44:01] this fits
[2:44:03] it's in Jeffersonville it's in 1965.
[2:44:06] it's just before you departs from this
[2:44:08] Earth one of his last sermons that he
[2:44:10] preaches and he said it's a popular
[2:44:12] thing to say I'm a Christian but do you
[2:44:14] believe the word of God which said these
[2:44:16] signs have followed them that believe oh
[2:44:18] even ministers faces will blush Are you
[2:44:21] ashamed to say of Divine Healing Are you
[2:44:24] ashamed of the Full Gospel Are you
[2:44:26] ashamed of your Pentecostal experience
[2:44:28] that's being ashamed of his word that's
[2:44:31] his word made flesh in you
[2:44:36] oh what if this little boy said he and
[2:44:39] you say he's my son and he says who may
[2:44:42] be your son what would you do what do
[2:44:44] you think I am it would embarrass me it
[2:44:47] would you if it were your son and that's
[2:44:50] the way he lives with so-called
[2:44:51] Christianity today if you name the the
[2:44:54] denomination all right they accept the
[2:44:57] fatherhood denomination but when it
[2:44:59] comes to accepting the fatherhood of the
[2:45:01] word Christ no they're embarrassed they
[2:45:03] don't want they don't want to say yes I
[2:45:06] have spoke with tongues yes I have seen
[2:45:09] Vision yes I believe in Divine Healing
[2:45:12] yes I praise the Lord I'm free from our
[2:45:14] all organization I'm not bowing down to
[2:45:17] any of that I am a servant of Christ oh
[2:45:19] my that just tear them to pieces
[2:45:23] then he goes on to say but let me say
[2:45:26] this a man
[2:45:29] who has once come in contact with God
[2:45:31] which is the word and the word has been
[2:45:33] made plain and manifested to him
[2:45:36] there is no shameness about that you're
[2:45:39] not embarrassed it doesn't embarrass me
[2:45:42] to say I believe every word of God it
[2:45:46] doesn't embarrass me when the Lord has
[2:45:48] anything to say anything you go and say
[2:45:50] it and do it it don't embarrass me to
[2:45:52] say I've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:45:54] it don't embarrass me to say I've spoke
[2:45:56] with other tongues it don't embarrass me
[2:45:58] to say that our Lord is showing me
[2:46:00] Vision it don't embarrass me to say he's
[2:46:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:46:06] I'm not ashamed
[2:46:09] I'm not ashamed
[2:46:11] are you with me
[2:46:12] I'm not ashamed of this land
[2:46:16] I don't see any Giants in it that are
[2:46:19] significant
[2:46:21] every time that I see is insignificant
[2:46:24] they are bread to us
[2:46:26] every obstacle I see we can overcome it
[2:46:30] every enemy Hallelujah he has made me
[2:46:33] the triumph over every enemy I found
[2:46:36] every Every Mountain a mountain that the
[2:46:39] Giants are camping on I'm going to take
[2:46:40] that mountain I say like Caitlyn did
[2:46:43] give me that mountain
[2:46:46] are you with me
[2:46:49] stand on your feet
[2:46:56] another Matt Watkins and I have a little
[2:46:58] funny thing going on between us
[2:47:01] he made a statement about he Don't
[2:47:03] Preach as long as me
[2:47:06] I thought it was funny
[2:47:09] I hope he thinks this is funny today
[2:47:13] let me just say
[2:47:15] we preached Maybe
[2:47:18] like I said in Virginia now or none of
[2:47:20] your business
[2:47:26] but God knows what your need is
[2:47:30] and he knows what our narrative is
[2:47:37] I can read every quote brother Brandon
[2:47:39] said about emotion
[2:47:41] and I can rejoice
[2:47:43] in everything that he said against and
[2:47:46] far
[2:47:49] because I believe it all
[2:47:51] and I believe we're walking in the land
[2:47:54] and brother when I get a hold of these
[2:47:57] grapes and taste his goodness
[2:48:01] it makes me want to shout it wants me to
[2:48:05] claim this is God
[2:48:07] this is what about this is a truth this
[2:48:10] is mine
[2:48:11] when I see the results
[2:48:15] hallelujah or you can have all the
[2:48:17] arguments you want you can debate the
[2:48:19] message all you want but I see the
[2:48:21] results
[2:48:24] seek transformation I see the Dynamics
[2:48:27] of the holy spirit that changes lives
[2:48:30] and transforms people
[2:48:37] well brother Tim I personally I think
[2:48:40] y'all get a little bit too noisy well
[2:48:43] let me
[2:48:44] give you a quote
[2:48:46] that fits my narrative
[2:48:49] was the Pentecostal Church a noisy
[2:48:52] church back at the beginning when the
[2:48:54] Holy Ghost first fell
[2:48:56] the Virgin Mary likes she was drunk
[2:49:00] staggered under the power of God and all
[2:49:03] of them like that and the people said
[2:49:05] they're full of new wine that's the way
[2:49:07] the church was ordained that's the way
[2:49:10] that every church was ordained every
[2:49:12] time God has a church it'll be the same
[2:49:14] kind of church because it ain't got no
[2:49:15] uncertain sound well our Bishop says I
[2:49:18] don't care what the bishop said is what
[2:49:20] the word says The Bishop's got an
[2:49:22] uncertain sound if his sound is sounding
[2:49:25] the same thing that this is he's right
[2:49:27] and then if the church don't act like it
[2:49:30] did like that he's wrong if you've got
[2:49:34] say you've got it and didn't act like
[2:49:36] that then there's something wrong with
[2:49:38] you because that's exactly what he said
[2:49:40] everyone
[2:49:46] amen that fits my narrative
[2:49:57] my story is
[2:50:00] I've been in the land
[2:50:02] and I've been walking through it
[2:50:05] my story is there is healing that will
[2:50:09] cause cancers to go
[2:50:10] [Music]
[2:50:12] my story is it'll drive out fear
[2:50:17] my story is it'll take a man that was
[2:50:20] laying there and that the doctor said
[2:50:21] was Brave dead and it was going to
[2:50:23] harvest his organs and raise him up
[2:50:25] again to preach the gospel and that's 15
[2:50:27] years ago and yes I'm talking about Ron
[2:50:29] Spencer that's my narrative
[2:50:34] and my story is as I walk through this
[2:50:37] land Hallelujah it'll transform young
[2:50:39] people
[2:50:40] [Applause]
[2:50:41] fill it with the Holy Ghost he'll give
[2:50:44] him a joy in the heart that the world
[2:50:46] can't give but the world can't take it
[2:50:48] away
[2:50:49] that's my story
[2:50:53] Hallelujah my story is it is not emotion
[2:50:57] but it will make you emotional that's my
[2:51:00] story
