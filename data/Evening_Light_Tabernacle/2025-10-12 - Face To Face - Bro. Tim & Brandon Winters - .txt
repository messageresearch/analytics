========================================

Listen. [Music] Oh, I'm a traveler [Music] far from home. I get lost, but I press on. There's a mansion in the streets of gold where I belong. [Music] Yes, there's a day. It's coming soon where the old will be made new. And heaven's glory shines like the morning before our eyes. [Music] When we all [Music] see Jesus. When we all [Applause] see Jesus, no more sickness, no more madness, no more pain. [Music] When we all see Jesus face to Hey, [Music] [Applause] hey, hey. [Music] Then we will sing with angels voices. There will be a great rejoicing for holy, holy, worthy, worthy is the lamb. [Music] When we all see Jesus. When we all see Jesus. No more sickness. No more sadness. No more pain. [Music] When we all see Jesus face to face when we all see Jesus face to face. [Music]
