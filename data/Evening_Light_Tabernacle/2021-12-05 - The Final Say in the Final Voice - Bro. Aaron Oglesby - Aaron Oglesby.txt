that you will move in our midst lord we know you will ask you to move me out of the way now father in jesus name we pray amen amen hallelujah isn't god good to us if you'll open your bibles to the book of revelation the third chapter we'll get right into the word revelation 3 14. hallelujah we just thank him for his goodness his mercy his love to us in our lives we're going to read just verse 14 that we're going to move down to verse 21 and then we're going to go to chapter 10 three different readings revelation 3 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of god verse 21 to him that overcometh i'll i'll find myself right there this morning to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne right there the word says that there's going to be overcomers the word has already declared it and the word is the final say so we know that scripture will be fulfilled someone is going to overcome laodicea revelation 10 7 and we'll read through verse 11 scripture we all should know well but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hands and ate it ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen i pray god add his blessing to the word now as you're seated wonderful scriptures that we've read wonderful words of life so much there that we can digest and we just want to try to find god's leadership this morning on which direction and how to take this last time that we we spoke here in the church we we spoke on the final say and i want to continue along that thought this morning and my title today would be the final say in the final voice the final say in the final voice we established last time the the supreme authority of god in and over every situation all right that there is only one who has the final say and that is the lord jesus christ amen our opening scriptures would describe him as the amen the faithful and the true witness brother brown would pick up this and he says i looked up in the dictionary webster's according to webster's it's perfect in itself talking about a amen unlimited in its power primarily an ultimate and an ultimate is the amen it's unlimited in power an absolute it's used many times it's the last word it's the amen it's unlimited there's nothing else in its way it's the supreme it's the ultimate and an ultimate is when it's because you've reached the end it's the amen that's all he says that's what he is the amen c he's got the last word to say he is the amen this morning aren't you glad that it's him that's holding the final say in your life look it's not the doctor's report this morning that's the final say it's not my opinion of you or brother joe's opinion or you or another man's opinion of you that is the final say it's not what the enemy has told you and the plans that the enemy has made for your life that is the final say but the very one who formed the galaxies the very one who blew the sun the moon and the stars off the palm of his hands he looked at your life and he made plans for your life and he said i hold you in these hands i have the final say over your life regardless of circumstance regardless of what the devil has tried to do he told peter the devil desires to sift you as wheat but i have prayed for you so it doesn't matter what the plan is of the enemy today in your life that doesn't matter my god holds the final say in your life he is the i am god he is the amen and that means that not only does he have the final say this morning he is the final say amen that's how we can rest this morning brother brother timothy was preaching about a place of rest and being unshaken that's how we can have rest when things that we can't comprehend or things that we don't understand when these when these things are happening we can still rest because we know whose hand we're in it would be extremely troubling and hard to deal with within ourselves if every time things turned upside down or every time we lost a loved one if we felt like the enemy had won oh the enemy came in and took that person the enemy's doing this to me and if we felt that way we would feel beat down all the time because things are constantly happening to us all right if we felt like the enemy had the final say in the life of our loved one who passed on but we can rest knowing that the final say rested in the hands of the master all right there was no defeat and even if we can't wrap our minds around it or understand why god's hand was in it because the devil never has the final say in a believer's life he never has the final say brother joe did an incredible job on wednesday night preaching about the plan of god and how it will never be defeated the purpose of god in your life will never be defeated listen stormy skies rough waters dark trials they are not signs of sin in your life they are not signs of god's displeasure in your life those are not look i'm going through a tough trial that means god picked you out to defeat that thing god looked at you and he said i've got confidence in that one they'll stand they'll overcome they'll rise above it and he picks you and it's not a sign of his displeasure it's not a sign that satan is gaining any kind of victory over you but many times it's just molding and testing and trying and yet all things are working together for your good sure satan wants to destroy you but he can do nothing unless permitted by god jeremiah 29 11 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end right here thoughts in jeremiah 29 means plans i know what i've already planned for you i know the end of the story i already know listen church of all people we should know what the end of the story is we should know that the seals have been taken off we've read the back of the book we know what's going to happen the rest of it's just drama you know if you take i i get onto my daughter all the time because she'll get a book and the first thing she wants to do is read the end of it i say why do you do that because the rest of it doesn't make me nervous then the rest of it doesn't matter i already know how it's going to turn out come on church the rest of it shouldn't make us nervous this morning we already know how it's gonna turn out we've already seen the back of the book the rest of it's just drama it's just getting there i know i'm gonna get there i know what's gonna happen i know how it ends victory eternity everlasting life health healing victory over death hell and the grave i know how it's going to turn out [Applause] [Music] amen satan's plans just don't matter satan began making plans in heaven to be exalted and worshiped and when that didn't go as planned we see him in the garden making plans bringing deception a plan to regain position a plan to regain authority by causing man to fall and he brings a twisted version of the word in the garden he changes one little word just a reminder here it all matters every part of it matters every word matters the parts you don't like i hope you like it all but how about the parts that are hard they matter if it's hard on you they probably matter the most every part of it matters he comes and he twists one little word and he causes adam's bride to fall and then adam falls with her and the whole earth under adam falls all creation everything that was under adam because he was god of the earth it's now in a fallen condition and satan thinks i've won i've accomplished i'm back i'm back to where i wanted to be i'm back in power sin and death is now going to reign in these mortal bodies but right there in that moment in the darkest moment of earth's history love projects and a savior is promised and when god says something it's the absolute when god says something it's the amen brother brown says there in the garden that morning when sin was so black jehovah come in there stood as couple standing condemned there would be no more human race they had to die death on the human race give the world back to wild beasts and there'd be no more human race but in that darkest of hour in that time when all hopes was gone grace come pouring through how many is thankful for grace this morning says i'll give you a savior a messiah oh it's wonderful how god could ever do it god's amazing grace in the garden of eden that give them that promise of just one of a just one who had come through who would come through the woman the woman's seed shall bruise the serpent's head the guilty one i love how he says that not you're the guilty one but he's going to bruise the serpent's head the guilty one and his head shall bruise her heel to show there had been an affliction to the church but he promised a triumph what provided that savior it was grace i'm not going to have time to deal with this and go down this but just for a minute as i came across it it did my heart so good and i found found some quotes but not only did he come to redeem you and i but his but his creation of earth is going to be redeemed earth is going to be redeemed everything that satan thought he destroyed not only did he think he destroyed the human race but he destroyed eden he destroyed this wonderful earth he had made it a place of his eden of darkness of death of dying and he says no no but when the blood of god fell and struck the earth hallelujah he said that blood fell and it struck the earth and he said now the earth has gone through justification and sanctification and it's going to get a baptism of fire he said but earth struck the blood struck that earth which you were a part of these bodies being pulled from the earth and he says that earth will be redeemed for jesus and his bride going back over a few things because i just want to reestablish in our minds that god is in control his word is the absolute he is the final say and he is limitless in his power get that in our minds today that our god is limitless and that's important to know because you know satan does have power satan does have power and yet if you go and you'll stack them up and compare the two one is extremely limited and one is limitless one has limitations on it one has no limitations on it and let me go ahead and tell you the one that is unlimited is our conqueror the one that is unlimited is our savior the one that is unlimited is our chief captain we are on the side of limitless power and we're going up against one who is limited the powers that satan possess are subject to the word of god god says stop he has to stop sickness is commanded to go it has to go a storm is commanded to peace be still it has to cease because the power of god is unlimited and the power of satan has limitations it is limited by the power of the word it is limited by the power of the holy spirit when he's told that's far enough oh come on church when he's told that's far enough that's far enough he has to stop i say there's got to be some people this morning that say satan that's far enough you've gone far enough you won't take another step in my life you won't take another step in my home you're not taking another step in my promises that is far enough you've done all you're gonna do there's gonna be no more robbing me of my joy no more robbing me of my blessings of my children you have gone far enough it's time to look at the storm and say peace be still this morning it's time that we begin to operate in the privileges and remember all your benefits that have been given unto you the devil you will not have the final say in my life you will not have the final say in my health you will not have the final say in my walk with the lord there's going to be no more robbing me because he's subject to the word of god so take the word of god and apply it to your situation there's going to be no more robbing me of my praise look there's victory in your praise and that's why he wants to rob you of your praise so many times we think when i get victory i'm going to shout when i get victory i'm going to dance when i get victory how happy i'm going to be that's fine and those things happen but sometimes victory is on the other side of the praise sometimes victory's over there and how do i get to it i'm going to praise my way to it i'm going to thank him for it i'm going to shout i'm going to dance i'm going to sing i'ma say thank you lord jesus and the devil's trying to get you to sit down and shut up i can't my victory's right over there and i'm going to praise my way to it [Applause] i mentioned this to brother derek the other day because he had a bad day wednesday it was bad he told me about i was like man i had a good day compared to that but i never would have known it i never would have picked it up listen if i can tell that you had a bad day when you come in on wednesday night you're doing it wrong if i can look at you and say they had a bad day then you don't know how church works leave your junk out there i had a bad day at work this ain't work i had a bad day at home this ain't home this is where i come to praise god this is where i come to worship god not i'm going to sit here mully grub and maybe i'll enter in later no sir you're doing it wrong but i'm here to say thank you jesus thank you lord i love you your mercies are great they endure forever your grace is amazing yes i had a bad day but lord not from you you were awesome today that's why we come to church [Applause] turn loose and forget those things bless the lord o my soul he deserves all we got when we come here not i need 27 minutes to warm up i know the circumstances of life are hard oh come on i have bad days we all do i'm not always perfect in church that's not what i'm saying preaching to me too i'm just saying why are we here don't sit here and dwell on tomorrow don't sit here and think about what happened during the day today think about what he's done for us circumstances of life are difficult but remember that he is a god that defies circumstances come on church he is a god that defies symptoms he is a god that defies logic you may be in a bad spot this morning you may have been going through a rough patch but he promised to be here this morning he promised that he would be in our midst he promised that he was going to show up and when he shows up it changes everything when he walks up to the grave it changes everything when he speaks nothing else matters because he is the final say it doesn't matter how long you've been in that sick condition this morning it doesn't matter how long you've carried that bitterness and that unforgiveness this morning it doesn't matter how long you've been in sin this morning it doesn't matter how bad things have been at work it doesn't matter if the man was in the grave for four days none of that mattered he didn't walk up and say if i'd only been here he'd have lived if i'd only showed up sooner but he walked up and he said where have you laid him where have you laid him where have you laid the things that satan tried to rob from you where have you laid your hopes and dreams this morning where have you laid the ones you've given up on this morning because he's walking up this morning where have you laid your hopes where have you laid the things that you gave up on and just said they'll never happen wherever you laid them this morning where's your joy buried where's your piece buried at this morning he's walking up to the tomb of lazarus this morning he's walking up to your tomb this morning where is he buried at my peace was robbed from me at a young age things have been taken from me things came in your childhood things scarred you people hurt you people did you wrong until you begin to believe the lie that that that you're not worth anything you're not worth very much anymore you're a nobody nobody cares about you you're of no value to anyone anymore you're not worthy and those scars became your grave clothes and you got all wrapped up in those things and they're binding you this morning and they're binding you in your walk and the devil put you in a tomb and he rolled a stone over your life and he rode a stone over the person that god intended you to be all along and death and corruption have had their say but corruption knew its master oh death had it say corruption had it saved but corruption knew its master sin may have had it say in your life depression may have had it say in your life anxiety's been ruling your life you can't break free there's chains and there's grave clothes but there's one here this morning that has the final say those say don't matter anymore when he walks up to your tomb and he says come forth come forth break free from those things break free from sin break free from shame break forth come forth this morning [Applause] lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and jesus said unto them loose him and let him go jesus had the final say that morning those grave clothes can't hold you if you want to come forth this morning that sin can't hold you if you want to come forth this morning back in genesis god had promised a redeemer god had promised the savior and here he is four thousand years later the manifestation of all the old testament prophecies god with skin on him doing the works of god but in humanity a second adam brother branham says he is the god of the amen he never changes what he does never changes he says it and it stands fast he does it and it is done forever none can take from what he says or add to it so let it be so let it be aren't you glad that you served that kind of god this morning you know exactly where you are with him at any time and all the time he is the amen god and won't change these things saith the amen i like that it means that whatever he said is final it means that whatever he said to the first age and to the second to all the ages about his own true church and about the false vine is exactly right and it won't change it means that what he started out with in genesis he will finish in revelation aren't you glad for that what he started out with in genesis he will finish in revelation he starts the plan of redemption right there in genesis and then down down through time every story that's told every type every life live is building towards the manifestation of a redeemer types and shadows and prophecies they're all pointing toward his coming a spoken word son of god born of a virgin one who would restore one who would wipe away tears one who would wipe away the curse of death one who would make the blind to see one who would make the death to hear and one who would make the lame to walk and one who would bridge the gap and bring man and god back into fellowship once again and here he stands stands there on the earth doing god things in the body of a man the full manifestation of all the word doing exactly what the word said he would do and the whole time what's amazing about it brother joe is the entire time satan has been trying to stop the plan ever since the book of genesis ever since the fall recognizing that god's trying to work this out and he's trying to stop it and he's trying to move here and he's trying to stop this seed and he's trying to stop this one here and he's trying to ruin this one and he's trying to kill this one and he's trying to stop this one if you haven't figured it out yet he can't stop it if you haven't figured it out yet he's tried to stop you and he's tried to bury you and he tried to hinder you but this seed came to this one and this one came through this world war and it came down here and it came to there and this one met this when you're like why is all this happening my life's a mess your life's not a mess it was orchestrated by almighty god and here you sit this morning because his plan was working the whole time here you are because god had the final say over your life [Music] no matter what he tried no matter what he did he may not realize it but he's playing right into the hands of god right into the plan of god we see it with hitler how awful that is how terrible the murder of millions of jews brother branham said that was the tender hand of jehovah them right back to where they're supposed to be how many times is he moving us to where we're supposed to be and it seems like the devil's wearing me out and god knows no no i know the plans i've made i know the plans i've made he's just moving you and satan thinks oh i got him oh i'm moving he's moving me all right moving me right into a place where i can receive the promise moving me right into a place oh sure they were mad when they got got taxed in the days of joseph and they had to go back but it was all in the plan of god all moving according to the plan of god thinking that he's doing something even with the crucifixion of jesus brother brown said had he known he would have never let that blood be shed had he known he would have never killed him he'd have tried to protect him stay back don't touch him i don't want this blood shed but once again thinking he was doing his worst thinking he was winning once again he was playing right into redemption's plan that's why it seems so many times that satan it seems that satan is so successful he's doing so much he's ruined this earth he's attacked my family it seems that he's so successful and yet he's a total and absolute failure god allows what looks like victories for him and yet it's all working towards total victory for you god says i know the plans that i've made for you and the plan of god will not be and cannot be stopped because our god is the final say listen satan operates in the now he has to react to it oh wait god did this now wait one what's he doing he got me last time i got you every time hey but but how am i gonna react i'm trying to figure it out and yet god's plan was finalized before the foundation of the world knowing exactly how the devil will react to everything that he did and making it turn and work exactly to to his plan and work for your good how is he going to stop you from getting your name written on the land's book of life when it was written on the book of life before the foundation of the world how can he stop something from happening and that's already happened he can't do it you've already been seen in the vision your name's already been written down your names are engraved in the palms of his hand what's he gonna do about it nothing he can't do a thing about it he can't stop the end from coming to pass it's already been written [Music] so what are you worried about what do you tore up about oh am i going to make it oh what if the devil does this and what if i mess up today the amen's already spoke the amen has already spoken your name's already been written down look he can no more stop you than he could stop jesus he couldn't stop joseph he just fulfilled the plan of god he couldn't stop job he just ended up getting blessed twice as much as he was before he failed to stop jesus he couldn't stop the true church that was born there on the day of pentecost he tried to stomp it out with persecution he fed him the lines he burned them at the stake he covered it up with false doctrines he tried to make the church cold and formal he ate the leaves off the tree to where the tree was totally bare but the amen had already written in the word i will restore before he ever ate one leaf off the tree before he did one thing that i am looked down and said i'm gonna restore what the devil's gonna do the amen had already spoke behold i sent unto you elijah the prophet sure he ate the leaves off the tree sure he ate it down but then out comes luther then out comes wesley already put there in the plan of redemption and the plan of restoration i will restore here comes luther here comes wesley i send you elijah the prophet out comes william branham out goes a message from that and out from that message comes you a people upon the face of the earth once again birthed by the very word of god can't you see that we're walking in the very plan of god that we're literally walking look look it's incredible when you open up the bible and you can look and you can see oh okay well satan tried this and i see where god countered it there and god had already planned for that here yeah yeah oh and look at this mighty person here and this mighty prophet and then he did this and he did what wait a minute that's me wait uh mama that's me the plan was all for me redemption was all for me salvation was all for me satan said i'm gonna destroy him i'm gonna ruin him i'm gonna cover him up i'm gonna wrap him in grave clothes but he came to the grave this morning all for me and he called my name and he said aaron come forth come forth from that walk in freedom walk in power walk in victory it's all for me the plan of god unfolding just for you not stopped not hindered but what he started in genesis marching right on all the way to revelation the full plan of redemption the plan to have a bride what he started in genesis carried all the way over finished in revelation see the whole time the word was not only pointing to a second adam it was also pointing to another eve an eve that would not fall joseph rejected by his brothers takes a gentile bride a queen accepted by the king and given even half the kingdom there in esther a bride that is redeemed by kinsmen and ruth one thing after another pointing to it a determined god i will have a bride that will not fall an enemy determined i'm gonna stop it confident that just like in the garden he would make this bride fall and a god so sure that you wouldn't he said i'm gonna go prepare a place so confident that you'd make it so confident that you'd overcome so confident that the deposit that he placed on the inside of you would manifest itself in this last day he said i don't even got to worry about it i go to prepare a place that where i am there you may be also he knows you're coming he knows you're going to make it he provided the way he's confident in the deposit that he put down on the inside of you he's confident in himself [Applause] excuse me i'm sorry early in the ephesian age paul is writing second corinthians 11 2 for i'm jealous over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste version to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ we already see what the enemy did in the garden of eden he's trying to do again with this one brother branham says so way back there in the early church a very short period after pentecost the false vine got to interwine itself around the true vine and we find the deeds of the nicolaitans he says they got people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship did not anyway at all resemble the early days after pentecost sounds so familiar says it got them to where their worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days of pentecost and so satan comes in the attacks just like he did eve and he changes one word here and he changes one word there and now the wolves have entered in and it seems so subtle and innocent even at first but but soon deeds become doctrines and before long the church is aimed at but relaxed the church has left her first love and there's a lukewarmness that has begun to creep in it has become nothing more than cold formal worship and the experience has been traded out for head knowledge this is what happened to the first age and once you do that then the things that are taught from the pulpit can be changed and manipulated because there is no personal relationship with god and because you don't have that relationship and you're relying on man to feed you then when things that are wrong or said that little alarm bell doesn't go off because you don't have that's why they want you to trade in that personal relationship for head knowledge because head knowledge can be manipulated head knowledge can be changed and over time one little word here over a period of time it's like those of you who have ever shot a gun if it's off an inch at 50 yards it's gonna be off a lot of inches when it gets on down the range so one word changed here and you begin to accept things that you wouldn't have because there is no holy ghost leadership in the church so you're relying on men to provide you with what you need and they become your leader instead of the holy ghost and now the divide between truth and what you're being fed grows exponentially if you'll look from the day of pentecost to just an age or two later it doesn't even resemble the same thing if you look at the catholic church today and try to compare it to the church that was started on pentecost it's not even the same religion it may be called christianity but it's not even the same religion they're not followers of christ because they accepted the leadership of man and they substituted the experience for head knowledge why do you think why do you think that those that operate underneath this spirit even within our our message are so against you listening to other preachers because they need you to rely on them and their teachings and not come in contact with too much truth they don't want you coming into in contact with too much truth why are they so against you going to a meeting where the holy ghost is moving because unlike paul their desire is to espouse you to themselves and not to the holy spirit so they build a fence around you and and hold you to themselves under the guise of protection i want to protect you from that stuff i want to protect you from that moving and in that time satan eats away until there's almost nothing left until it doesn't even resemble what god started in the upper room satan thinks to himself this one's falling just like eve this wasn't hard this took no time brother brown said it wasn't long after the upper room it had already wormed its way in but the amen had already said brother johnny i'm gonna have a bride that's it the rest what is the rest of it drama he'd already said i'm gonna have a bride he had shown there in eden how she would be when adam said this is bone of my bone and this is flesh of my flesh church we're gonna be just like him men can come and teach head knowledge men can come and teach this and say that but the ministry of the bride is gonna match exactly to the ministry of the groom she will be just like he is she's going to be just like him oh but but satan says look where she's falling too we haven't even got through the fourth age it's the fourth church age and it's so dark there isn't hardly anything left from the original tree planted that day on pentecost but the amen said i'm going to restore brother brown says but what he was god's perfect prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree hey man glory i'm going to say something directly if he's the bridegroom tree do you believe it from the garden of eden and the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bright tree she's got to be born of the same material the word made flesh in the tree hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride the works that i do shall you do also is that right yes so he begins to restore it's eating down to nothing it's eat down to there's nothing left it's all based on head knowledge and the head knowledge has gotten a million miles away but luther breaks away from the false vine and he preaches justification and then wesley comes and he preaches sanctification what is it it's a tree being restored it's the bride tree being built back up and yet there were still claims that satan could hold over the church there were still false baptisms there were still false teachings of the godhead the tree wasn't producing the fruits that god had intended it to produce yes it had come a little ways and it had grown a little bit but it still wasn't matching him this was not bone of his bone although there were glimpses there were glimpses of it oh that's how it was oh there's there's a glimpse of it and yet there were claims over that church so what's he looking for this was not the ministry of jesus christ being repeated and that is what he's looking for brother branham says there's got to come one in this last day a restoration of the church the bride tree that was eat down back yonder by the canker worms and the palmer worms and all kinds of insects that eat all the brotherly love and fruits away from it there's got to come a church again where those barriers will be broke and the holy ghost will have the right of way among the people when you do you will see the same signs and wonders that happened back there in them days thus what the church was at pentecost now listen brother aaron why do y'all harp so much on this on the gifts and the movement of the spirit why do you harp so much on on on turn back to the original pentecost listen to this thus what the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close so if you will admit that we are still in the church ages that this is still the layout of seeing age he has to keep doing exactly what he did at pentecost that is the pattern of the church we're not patterning after other people we're not patterned after other churches we're trying to pattern after the book of acts church because that is the pattern that is what we are to be that is who we are to be luther came and wesley came and there were glimpses but it still wasn't the pattern there still had to be more than the azusa street revival and a restoration of gifts make no mistake about it that was part of the restoration and if god thought that it needed to be restored then why in the world would we think it's not needed god went through a lot of trouble to make sure it was restored and then we went oh we don't need that thanks now we're good really god thought it needed to be restored and if he thought it needed to be restored then it must be needed we don't need the gifts anymore those things are no longer very even going on you know the very reason they had to be restored is if you go back far enough into the first age you would find people thinking just like that we don't need that anymore we don't need to speak anytime yeah that happened a few years ago you know a few places but we've moved beyond that and now we have a deeper revelation of the word and so those things are not tongues and they're not needed those things aren't and so because of that attitude they were lost church we can't afford to lose anything that god has restored in this age because there ain't time to go through that process all over again we're at the end we got to grab a hold to everything god's given us everything he restore and say yes that's mine i'll take it if god says it's mine it's mine if he says it's in the church it's in the church i'll take all of it you may not think it's important but if he thought it was important enough to restore it must be something that i need in this last day so i want it all i want to take it i want to hold on to it we can't give back to the enemy what god has restored and so once again the azusa street move comes and once again there are fruits of the spirit being manifested the tree was beginning to take shape and yet there must come something else still something's missing there's got to be something else something to turn us turn us to what brother brother says but what i said was that because of the unchanging god with unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect act of god and then judge by that standard perfect act of god and judge by that standard that is how it's done the true church will always try to be like the original at pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one and just like in every other instance oh something's lacking we need something don't worry he's already provided it just like in every other instance the amen the final say had already spoken and it was already laying right there in the word he was already so many steps ahead of the enemy laying right there all these years in malachi 4 5 it says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he will turn the hearts back to the faith of the fathers and that message comes forth in power and it called forth a restored bride with a restored word and it restored her to a position to where i can stand here this morning and tell you that you are the manifestation of the spoken word of god you are that's good brother aaron my i was wondering about that this morning i don't think you were you are the manifestation of the spoken word of god brother branham says and now remember you christians were his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking hallelujah that does something to me maybe not to you but i am the manifestation of god's thinking i am part of his plans i am part of what he laid out before the foundation of the world then what devil can stop me what devil can hold me what depression what anxiety what fear what sickness what death what grade none of it can stop me because i'm the manifestation of the very thinking of god once again in flesh upon the earth what can stand in my way nothing can stand in my way and now just like the time to where everything that was pointing to jesus became flesh and he stood in a body upon the earth and he went about tearing down satan's kingdom he went about showing that death didn't have to be feared that sickness didn't have to be feared he showed that the grave didn't have any victory and just as the groom did those things just as the groom proved that he had the final say over the enemy now there is a bride the manifestation of the word and flesh again doing the exact same works death doesn't have to be fear sickness doesn't have to be feared sin doesn't have to be feared we are him in flesh once again the manifestation of the word and flesh again and nothing can stand before you because you or the final say you are the final say over the enemy devils i recommend you get out of my way this morning because regardless of what you do and what attack you bring i have the final say over you i can take the word of god right now and put it upon my lips and it's the same as deity speaking i curse you in the name of jesus every spirit of fear every spirit of depression every spirit of suicide every spirit telling me that they ain't gonna make it i am the final stay over you i rebuke you i tell you to go this is a church with victory with life we will be healed we will be saved we will have victory we will rapture our young people are going my mama's going my daddy's going my children's going why i have the final say i have say over this i am the manifestation of the word in a body with my believing brothers and sisters you have a save it's not time to remain silent it's not time to be pushed around but rise to the occasion take your authority and speak what you have need of hallelujah brother brown says they are one same word the same word that spoke of the groom speaks of the bride and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride as a mouthful it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him then i say prepare for the same results he got prepare for the same results he got we have seen them and we will see more we have seen the prodigals come home and we will see more we have seen cancer defeated and we will see more hallelujah we have seen the lame walk and we will see more we have seen those filled with the holy ghost and we will see more because she is him repeating the ministry of jesus christ on the earth once again a momentary consideration of the church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read known of all men for their generation when the method is failed god raised up others and so it has gone through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age why can he trust you with that because he knows you're not speaking your own thoughts he knows that she is free from man's thinking because he has restored her to a place that he can trust her speaking for him restored you to a place to such a perfect word that he can trust you speaking for him what is it that's holding you this morning then what's holding you what haman is coming against your life what's coming and threatening your family come on the only thing that would have hindered esther is if she had not went in but she had to finally quit looking at herself as unworthy and what if he don't accept me and what if and what if and he had to go in and once she did and once she confronted her haman he said speak in my name and seal it with my ring and whatever's done in my name and seal with my ring let no man stand before it i say what's your haman this morning what's coming against you and your family this morning speak in his name speak in his name and go forward seal it with his ring and go forward let the proclamation go forth we will have victory we can defend ourselves we will slay the enemy we will ransack their tents we will take everything that was taken from us back we will have joy and peace and victory speak it in his name and go forward do you realize how close sometimes we look around and look how bad the world is though satan he's making he's gaining ground do you realize how close haman's plan was to succeeding and completely wiping out the jewish race it was right there until somebody said i'm the queen i have the right to speak i'll raise up to the position i won't back down had that one person not spoke the race would have been wiped out maybe it's in your family if you don't speak your family will be wiped out maybe it's just you personally before the chaos said to her so don't think that just because you're in the palace if you don't speak that it's going to pass over you you can't just sit back and go maybe it'll skip me maybe it'll pass me no this lukewarm layout of seeing spirit that's coming for each and every one of us it's coming after your homes and your children but somebody's going to raise them say i'm the queen i'll have the seal i have the name of the king i have the authority to speak i am him and i speak you'll come no further you stand still hallelujah sure satan thought the church was defeated just like haman thought i've got him we're right there at it he thought once again i've won the church has taken in the creeds of man the ideas of man false doctrines false baptisms but he said i know my plans he had spoken a restoration and he had a message that would be the final say on all these claims against the church he had a message that would produce a people that he could trust to speak for him the message was the final say on the mysteries that's what revelation 10 7 told us it was the final say on the seals it was the final say on water baptism it was the final say on godhead it was the final say on no eternal hell it was all the loose ends it was the final say it tied it all up luther couldn't have the final say there were still too many claims on him wesley couldn't have the final say there were still too many claims on him the pentecostals could not have the final say there was too many claims on them but in this day in this generation look those ages couldn't have the final say because the whole word had not yet been restored back so they could not have a final say with a partial word so there had to be a prophet a prophet that would come and stand there and receive a message from almighty god a message that would come and break every claim and strip away everything that stood between you and full redemption and full manifestation a prophet the seventh church age messenger to restore all that had been lost a prophet to reveal the seals and then could the final say be spoken then could there come one who was the final voice to the final age we couldn't be here without a prophet first speaking do you realize have you ever thought that the message spoke you into existence had william branham not come and this message not come would we be here this morning this bride this group this worldwide body spoken into existence by a message no other age could do that no other age could come no other than no other age could have the final say you say well praise god the seals are open word is restored that's why we don't need all your emotion like you have at evening like tabernacle all that stuff the opening of the word is exactly what's bringing the emotion that's exactly what we're excited about look i don't like to run joe wanted so bad to say obviously i can't dance i don't like to and i'm being carnal for a second but when the spirit moves and i see my name in the lamb's book of life and i can only see it there because the seals were ripped off and that's what's allowed me to see it then it makes me get a little bit excited i may come out my chair and run around the building i may dance a little bit and guess what i won't care even one little bit what you think about it because this is about me and my god this is about my name this is about eternity this is about what he did for me this is me i'm part of the pride i'm the manifested word he did it all for me i've got eternity i'm gonna live forever i'm gonna overcome i'm gonna make it and it gets me excited excited enough to exercise a little bit that's some excitement in my life [Applause] that's exactly what's bringing the emotion john said every creature which was in heaven and in the earth and under the earth heard i john he was shouting and screaming and praising the lord it brought emotion david danced when the word was restored that's what's bringing the emotion i'm not emotional because you have not seen the opening of the word you've got a head knowledge of it you've been told the stories but once you see it and you see you're there that's me mama that's me then it brings the emotion and the excitement i have eternity [Applause] it's the age of finality in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished it's the age of finality it's all wrapped up the mystery is finished i say you make your calling in election sure trim the lamps apply the blood he said he would send malachi 4. he did it he said he would have a bride and he does he said the mysteries would be revealed they are there is a living breathing spoken word bride on the earth today he says just as the church stands today the true living church of god without a denomination or anything else she stands alone but yet she's had the anointing poured on her she knows what she is he had luther wesley william brown a vindicated message by a vindicated prophet sure there's gonna be those that dispute it there's gonna be those that the doubt the message that'll say it isn't the truth or he was wrong here he was wrong there and they'll try to discredit it but we're talking about the amen god they've tried to discredit him from the beginning of time but he's always a step ahead he's always got his plans i know the plans i've made they're going to try to discredit it but we're talking about the one who had the final say time after time he would come down and back up what was preached in that service with an amen he would come and move and he would discern hearts and he would speak life and he would bring healing and that was god coming in and going amen what was just preached amen that's the truth here's the final say amen and the amen of god would move and he would come and he would put his stamp of approval upon what had just been preached well he didn't say this right well he said it right enough that the angel of god felt comfortable enough to come down behind it and confirm what he just said so if we're taking opinions i mean i'm going to go there well i'm not sure he told this story right he told it enough that the angel of god came down in the service and healed the sick came down and discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart and said amen to what was said you want to try to discredit it and yet thousands upon thousands if not millions came night after night after night and i would venture to say 99 of them did not agree with him and did not believe him and yet never once with all those people there who would love nothing more than to see him discredited do you hear somebody go that's not true he said it wrong or somebody in the back hollered that was wrong right there i know not not once listen he wasn't preaching to message churches he was preaching to people that would have loved to caught him in error and couldn't and now they're all gone and suddenly you got some kind of evidence you've got something that you think you can present to me now that all the eyewitnesses have passed off the scene you can produce some kind of so-called evidence look in noah's day they produced evidence that it couldn't rain but the i am god had the final say the i am god is the finality of it the absolute of it and he said amen to this message he said amen to this message and aside from all that i've seen what the message has produced i see what the message produces produces the greatest young people in the world it produces the greatest people in the world it produces people with real true love in their heart overcoming sin walking according to the word and if you have a problem with that i think i know where the problem lays brother brown says there it is he's sending a vindicated prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2 thousand years he's sending someone who is far from organization education in the world of religion that is john the baptist and elijah of old he will hear only from god and he will have thus sayeth the lord and speak for god he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6 will turn the heart to the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his boys and perform his works hallelujah do you see it what's he saying he's saying you're his hands he's saying you're his feet he's saying you are to be his voice and you are to perform his works oh not me brother aaron no you're not talking about me i've had a bad couple of weeks i i'm not i'm not even sure i'm saved i'm not you just don't know i um that can't be about me because i'm just i'm just struggling to to control my attitude hello flesh i don't like it it wars against us oh you don't understand i i've struggled i fell down i messed up i got men the devil won on me the other day listen guys christians are fighters it's what we do we're in a fight and guess what sometimes in a fight you get hit sometimes you get hit and that's okay you stepped into look anybody can step into the ring but can you answer the bell anybody can step into the ring but when you step into the ring you're going to have fights and you're going to get hit and sometimes you get hit and it makes you feel like you want to quit but there's something on the inside of you that says i can't quit i got to stand here i got to keep going i got to keep swinging i got to keep fighting i got hit again that's okay that doesn't mean i'm not a christian it doesn't mean the devil's going to win it just means he landed a blow and i messed up but i'm going to keep fighting i'm going to sit down i'm going to read for a minute i'm going to encourage myself there's the bell ding ding ding i'm coming back out i'm going to fight another round i'm going to stand another round with the enemy i'm not backing up i'm not quitting i know you might have had a bad week a bad two weeks a bad month but don't quit don't give up everything that the lord's already done for you because of a bad day just get up and keep going keep fighting keep pressing let that deposit on the inside of you keep punching out and keep feeding and you're gonna win the fight these are the championship rounds they get difficult the attacks get harder but this is what we trained for this is why we're here because you're going to win you're going to overcome you're going to land a knockout blow it's who you are i got punched a lot in the last couple weeks too it didn't mean i wasn't a christian and then i was in a fight we're fighters it's time to dig in our hills we got work to do we got things to conquer we got to step up to the plate and begin doing what the word said we were going to do oh i messed up the devil i started to say shut up but tell the devil to shut up not you quit speaking the devil's language like mordecai said to esther it's time to act now it's time to act now it's time to go on the attack it's time to quit sitting back and playing defense quit sitting back just letting him lie bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb i say there he is there's the enemy there's that one that's been tormenting you there's depression there's anxiety there's fear there's sin there's the thing that's been coming at you at night trying to torment you about your family there's the one coming at you at night telling you you're not gonna make it your brother's not gonna there's the one not allowing you to sleep peacefully at night there i say go get him i say quit sitting there let him tell me i say get up take the armor of the word and put the word on your lips and attack him and say i won't stand for it no more you've had all my peace you're gonna have you had all my joy you're gonna have you want hey you want some peace you want some peace you want a piece of me you want a piece of this word i say i'm coming out to take what you've been robbing from me i'm not gonna sit back and take it anymore you wanted some you got the whole thing we're coming out we're coming at you we're not scared we're armed we're dangerous we're the bride of christ we're here to fight we're not backing up we're not giving in hallelujah we're overcoming oh blessed be the name of the lord you want to fight we're here today we're answering the bell we're fighters it's what we do hallelujah speak healing speak joy speak victory speak what you have need of because you're the final voice in this situation you have the authority to do so hallelujah hallelujah you speak to your mountain let your mountain hear your voice this morning there is a bride i'm gonna go through this part quickly and there are many claiming that they are that bride or that they are part of that bride and it's not for me or you to say whether they are aren't but what i can do is i can look into the word and i can see what the bride will do and what the bride will produce and how the bride is to conduct herself and then i can make sure that i'm lining up to that as brother tim put it so perfect last week you must line up to the vision you can't be part of that group that is the final voice to the final age and not be matching him word for word you can't be speaking things contrary to the word and be part of the final voice your attitude can't be us four and no more you're not part of the final voice you're out of your attitude is to put others out because they don't agree with you you're not part of the final voice matter of fact brother brown says now isn't that just like the nicolaitans that we have with us today they curse everyone that don't go their way when all you know is condemning others it shows that you yourself have never experienced the grace of god in your own life listen i don't know where people got it twisted but this whole message is a message of grace that's what this message is is grace brother brown says i believe that we are now living in the last day i believe that this is the last message this message of grace that god has given to his church and i believe that any time christ could come that's why i'm here tonight trying my best to call to every side of the world and all that i can do to let people see that he is true and living god and that he is the only door people get it so mixed up and they want to turn it into a message of judgment sure it warns of judgment it's a warning of judgment it warns to flee from the wrath that is to come it warns not to be partakers of the plagues but that warning is grace to you it is grace to you it comes forth shouting grace grace that's what the message came to say listen people think well boy noah's message was it's going to rain noah's message was there's an ark noah was not a message of judgment it was a message of grace there's judgment coming but there's grace for you there's a door available to you i've always loved it that when you read about the ark it tells very specific dimensions about everything everything but there's no measurements on the size of the door i got a lot of baggage i got a lot of things weighing me down i've got doors big enough door's big enough you don't understand what i've been through in the sin that's been doors big enough for you this morning and it's open just come on in just come on that's what the message is is get in the ark get in the ark it's not if you you're going to burn in hell nicolaitans the message is get in the ark this morning noah's message was a message of grace brother branham called the messengers down to sodom messengers of grace and we tend to look at oh they rained fire and brim so no they came and rescued people before the fire and brimstone fail this is a message of grace if you're preaching that mercy is over you are not part of the final voice you can't fall in that category and be preaching that mercy's over if you preach division if you speak against your brothers you are not part of the final voice brother brown says and today the only thing that will break down the barriers the only thing that can melt us together as brothers and christians the only thing that could bring us together again is the spirit of god or the love of god that should have brought in our hearts a message of grace from god that we are not divided all one body are we god heals them just the same as whatever they are we are not divided well brother aaron you don't know this doctrine they're preaching over there with this over here they're just a little different when they came to jesus and asked about a situation like that one time and he said if they're not against us they're for us if they're not against us they're forced how about we focus on getting right and focus on getting your family right and then focus on making sure you're being fed right and then that doesn't mean i'm not worried about others i'm talking about worrying about everybody else's problems and trying to fix them let god deal with them if you truly feel like there's an error pray for them telling me about it helps them none it helps them none yes judgment is coming but there's mercy what would the bridegroom be saying i'll tell you exactly what he'd be saying forgive them they know not what they do that's exactly what he'd be saying listen judgment's coming yet judgment was upon the jews it was literally the very closing of the jewish dispensation judgment was there and what was he speaking father forgive them and so here we are in the closing of the gentile dispensation his bride's gonna be speaking the same thing not like they're gonna burn no father forgive them father show them grace father show him mercy the same mercy you showed me the same grace you showed me the same love you showed me bring them in father bring them into the heart that's the message point them to jesus tell them there's mercy tell them there's grace if your life is speaking judgment upon your brother you're not in the final voice pointing out their flaws you know some people hate when a person is looked at highly by a group of people and yet they feel like they know the real them yeah oh everybody likes them but i i know the real them i know this and it burns them up to see somebody respected and oh i know this i know this and what you are is you find yourself on the side of the accuser of the brethren and you're not part of the final voice to the final age the final voice will speak as the groom did and offer forgiveness and healing because she will match him you cannot be part of the final voice and claim that the days of miracles has passed you can't be part of the final voice and not see that john 14 12 is for this day mark 16 in action there are things that the finals say in the final voice we'll be saying those things are if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover if we resist the devil he will flee we can cast out devils we can tear down satan's kingdom you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost you can be healed today you can be saved today your family can be saved that's the final voice that's the final say there's grace there's mercy bring them in there's salvation there's healing there's deliverance bring them in why do you think that attack is so bad against the holy ghost today and the movement of the spirit and and the and the experience of the holy ghost because satan saw what it did to the first church age when he robbed it from them and now for the first time in thousands of years he sees another church that resembles what he saw back there when christians were dangerous i'd like to tell him we're back i'd like to tell him we're back again back then christians were dangerous and he wanted to rob him of the power but there's another group on the earth today that has the same power satan we're back we're back on the earth again manifested once again he wants to rob that from you because he saw how effective it was in the first age it was the dynamics that proved in the groom who he was there were a lot of great teachers there were a lot of men crucified but it was the dynamics of the resurrection that proved who he was and it will be the dynamics and the bride that proves who she is oh come on somebody the final voice the voice of the groom expressed through the bride i'm gonna try to start bringing this down listen this the stumps growed from wesley from luther to wesley to pentecost and now is honing out those pentecostals and those that got the baptism of the holy ghost it shall come some day the headstone christ jesus in these last days and will have to have a ministry just exactly like his his whole spirit as it gets closer closer closer than negative becomes so positive that after a while the negative and the positive blends together the church in christ to make one for we're flesh of his flesh we're bone of his bone amen you believe it it shall be light in the evening time he says but look right where that headstone's supposed to fit it's honed if they could ever find that headstone it would fit just so perfectly snug it would bind the whole thing together that's the bride of jesus christ when the headstone comes there will be a church there on earth to receive it and it'll have a ministry just exactly like his it'll just go right in there bringing up the feet luther and all the rest of them for the resurrection somebody's got to step up and play the part oh y'all trouble now i found two more bottles of water somebody's got to start stepping up playing the part it's been seen it's been spoken and it's only drama now but who's going to play the parts somebody's going to quit allowing they're going to quit allowing their flesh to talk them out of it somebody's going to quit allowing their complexes to talk them out of it look we've had enough of flesh speaking it's time that the deposit that's on the inside overtake the flesh and we allow that deposit to begin speaking instead of our flesh because that deposit is going to agree with the word that deposit is going to say what the word said because that deposit is just as eternal as the word is eternal the deposit on the inside of you will agree with the word listen as we begin to bring this down you have not only been given the authority to speak you have been commanded to speak back to our opening verses revelation 10 8 and i'm not going to read all of them but i'm going to skip through it says go and take the little book which is open notice we have an open book in the hand of the angel we're standing upon the scene upon the earth verse 9 says take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but that shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey verse down to verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nation tongues and kings this is the ministry of the bride once the book has been opened there's the open book there's a group of people that have taken it out of the hand but now they have something to say they have a ministry to speak brother branham's asked will the bride have a ministry he says the bride of christ certainly that's what's going on right now it's the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour and then it'll be so humble that's what the final voice to the final age is the final voice to the final age is the ministry of christ repeated in a people what was the final voice to the jewish dispensation the ministry of christ what will be the final voice to the gentile dispensation the ministry of christ what he did she will do what he conquered we will conquer where he overcame we will overcame and where he resurrected we have over we have resurrected i listen a lot this week who is the rising of the sun and brother brown would say what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is here we are listen he says he proved what he was and this is back to it was the dynamics that proved who the groom was and it'll be the dynamics that prove who the bride is he says he proved what he was anyone could die but it take god to raise again in his life he looked like god he preached like god he healed like god he acted like god he was god and he proved on easter morning that he was god he was more than a man he wasn't a prophet yet he was a prophet he was a good man but yet he was more than a good man he was god and so this is the day in memorial of his resurrection that he proved it when he was here on earth there never was a birth like his there never was a death like his and there never was nobody raised from the dead like that he proved what he was when he was here on earth he said he was god he acted like god he preached like god he healed like god he rose from the dead like god he proved he was god he was more than a philosopher he was more than a teacher he was more than a scholar he was more than a prophet he was god that's who he was and it was the resurrection that proved he was god it was the dynamics that proved he was god it wasn't just the teaching it wasn't just his doctrine it was the dynamics of resurrection power that proved he was almighty god it was the dynamics that caused him to resurrect it was the dynamics he said it won't just move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with the octane and the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion and every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of god mechanics with dynamics the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move we have put too much stress on the mechanics not in nothing on the dynamics it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass this is gasoline it might be a gasoline can but it could still be water but the only proof of it is put some life on it and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not come on church here we are it was the dynamics that proved whether or not he was the groom and it'll be the dynamics that'll prove whether or not you're the bride just as the dynamic power of the resurrection proved he was so will it prove who she is oh come on not just the correct doctrines which we have but the dynamic power of the resurrection working in our midst healing the sick saving the lost filling people with the holy ghost and all of it happening through each and every one of you his bride the manifestation of the word once again here upon the earth look satan i don't think you know who you're messing with this just isn't some other denominational church fly by night that's going to lay down and quit but this is a church scene in the vision this is a church who is in the thoughts of almighty god this is a people that are born of his bone flesh of his flesh and even as he thwarted you every time he came in contact with you so will she we will overcome you in your own layout to see you in your own eden all of it happening right now and his bride what a match what a match doing his works speaking his word the lord jesus manifested in a bright body armed and dangerous the final voice and abroad declaring he is the same yesterday today and forever dynamic power proving once again that he lives i thought about that and i was looking at that i said it was dynamic power that resurrected the lord jesus from the grave it was dynamic power that morning that proved that he was the groom because he raised from the grave and it's going to be dynamic power one of these mornings that takes us in a rapture and proves who we are you talk about a proven you talk about a final say i say let them mock let them make fun let them ridicule let them say this there's going to be a final say coming one of these mornings it's going to be dynamic power it's going to be dynamo in the bride of jesus christ the same power that raised him out of the grave is going to take you up off the earth the final say wraps your day those in the bride will do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete now listen to this here's the point i've been wanting to get to he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through his bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time we got some conquering to do we got some devils to defeat we got some overcoming to do we got blind eyes to come open we got loved ones that we're gonna call back we got some healings and deliverances even in this service that we got to do because it's his work working through us it's his bride manifested in the flesh so much so how much resurrection power is going to be in that bride how much so much so that you will call for the general resurrection will that power in him cause the first resurrection what's the power in you gonna cost that resurrection brother branham says say to this mountain and you've heard about what's been taking place that's the ministry that we're entering into we we're way up the road now soon the coming of the lord jesus and we've got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment a twinkly of an eye or will not go but don't worry don't worry i know what plans i have don't worry it'll be there it'll be there and when the power of this church rises it'll bring its brethren and the power of that church rises will bring us with the power of this church when it rises to the place it's supposed to be it's going to bring its brethren and the power of that church will bring the other brethren then there'll be a general resurrection we're looking forward to it the voice of god so strong in a people that is calling for a resurrection the voice of god it's a group of people that's calling for resurrection power to operate within them lord i need that power today and it's what we need each day and i'm calling for and i need it tomorrow and this one's calling for it and this one's calling for it and you're calling for resurrection power and i need it in this situation and i need it in that situation and then it's a life so close a life that's so full of the power of the resurrection and there's thousands of these lives thousands of them calling for it i need resurrection power brother joe you need resurrection power and you're calling for it and i'm calling for it and thousands of lies calling for resurrection power and he's calling her and she's calling him and there's a drawing and up from the ground they're going to come oh hallelujah resurrection power and the bride of jesus christ what a perfect match what a perfect match he's calling me and i'm calling him and up from the ground they're gonna come i say it's a perfect match because when my groom stood there at the grave of lazarus brother brown said had he not called him by name it would have called the general resurrection but it wasn't time yet but it is now a group of people i say call it i say call it i say call for that resurrection power call for it in your life call for it in your home call for it for your needs call for him to come close to you and as he begins to call you and begins to draw you that same power is going to draw the dead in christ right up out of the grave are you ready to be that people are you ready to be that people this morning where you stand with me stay with me is there somebody here that will give him praise today and say lord i'm ready to be that people i'm ready to be the manifestation of the word i'm ready for you to speak through my life i'm ready to do your works lord i see in the word what the bride's supposed to be i see how she's supposed to act i see the power that's supposed to be there and i want that i'm calling for that resurrection power i'm calling to you lord if i don't got it fill me i need more of it and when there's enough lies calling for it oh hallelujah he begins to pull him down out of glory and he begins to pull her up off this earth the resurrection is going to take place the dead in christ so when this corruptable shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory death swollen up in victory what is that jesus conquered that no no death took jesus took the stinger from death but it's his bride that never tastes death whatsoever and death is swallowed up in victory what a promise what a word what a people and i say she's standing on the earth today doing the works of god ready to say death you are swallowed up in victory the final say in the final voice the same power in the bride i ask you today what will you speak what will you speak amen will you bow your heads with me father lord you promised that if the same spirit had raised up jesus from the dead dwell in us it would quicken also our mortal bodies lord i want to be diligent lord i want to match you or we can't be pretending can't be pretending when it comes time for a resurrection can't be pretending when it comes time for a rapture lord i know you wasn't pretending that day at the grave of lazarus lord you wasn't pretending that day at calvary you wasn't pretending when you went down to hell oh and you wasn't pretending when you resurrected lord i don't want to be a pretender but lord let me be diligent lord let me be diligent there's got to be a people tearing satan's kingdom down lord i want to match that lord the closing words of the jewish dispensation you cried out it is finished and i believe it is finished we'll close out this one as satan's kingdom is completely destroyed by a bride who has thus saith the lord and we know what you want done with it lord help us all to come to that place lord we're all at different places along the walk but lord once again i want a crowd there's mercy and there's grace there's salvation and there's healing lord i want to match you and what you cry and what you're saying i want to match you so perfectly lord that you give me the authority to speak in your name lord how we love you and how we thank you and how we believe lord god that you're coming so soon lord i ask for each heart gathered here if there's one that doesn't know you lord may you draw nigh to them now lord and each and every one of us i have a relationship with you lord may we take another step and draw another step closer i pray in jesus name hey man do you love him before i leave i want to read you this quote it is finished there is now therefore no condemnation why should the church fear what promises has he ever failed to manifest before us why should it fear punishment or death it has all been overcome here is the mighty conqueror here is the one who conquered both worlds of the scene and the unseen not like alexander who conquered the world at the age of 33 and knew no other way to turn for further conquest so he died a victim of sin and righteous living not like napoleon who conquered all europe but finally was defeated at waterloo and banished to elba only to find himself conquered but nothing could conquer christ he that descended has now ascended above all and unto him has been given a name that is above every name yes he conquered death hell in the grave and has the keys thereof what he looses is loosed and what he binds is bound there is no changing of it there was no conqueror before him and there is none beside him he alone is the savior redeemer he is the only god and the lord jesus christ is his name all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use so you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail the final say and the final voice god bless you church amen [Applause] fall just like the
