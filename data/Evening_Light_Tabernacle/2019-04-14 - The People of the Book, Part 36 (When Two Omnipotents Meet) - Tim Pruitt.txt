so a lot rather you just be there any man it'll be a great time together this will be our 32nd year to hold them Easter camp and it'll be our 30th year at Dry Creek Louisiana there where we when we rent the Baptist campground there for the weekend and had for the last 30 years and man we're just looking for a great time in the Lord I've been talking to brother Donnie Regan brother Andrew Glover they're looking there with great anticipation for the meeting the Lord speaking to them about the different needs and so we're just looking to the Lord to really speak to us in a mighty way also I wanted to say that as I drove up I as I pulled in before there was a few come but just a few cars here this morning my wife and I arrived and and it was grateful that the roads were all open after the six inches of rain that we got yesterday and so we were happy for that be able to come and you know as I drove up in in the parking lot I looked over at my wife and I mentioned about Walker's Chapel and the church there or I first started preaching when I was only 15 years old and that's been now nearly 50 years ago February coming up will be 50 years of ministry I started there had never stopped a man and so you know today we're here because of our love for the Lord Jesus and for this message that God sent a message of restoration in this endtime I was really pleased to hear that the brother Leo's sister Helen was here today and we're happy to have the Chambliss is also the Nelsons that are here it's so good to have you in the service with us and we're just looking to the Lord and all of you that is assembled I know there's different members of the life family that were here for the baby dedication also other extended family so we're just really happy to have you in the service with us today a man but we're thankful for Jesus without him or nothing a man he's all he's the reason we live he's the reason that we endure Amen he's the reason we believe a man let's turn to mark chapter 11 verse 20 if you will will stand for the reading of the word as we just go into the scripture once more this morning this was the scripture that brother Branham was complicate contemplating upon when when the third pull of his ministry would would come into effect and would begin to show the power of it and would show in the power of creation and in mark 11 verse 20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance said unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curses is withered away and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever sayeth therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them a man of God bless you you can be seated may God bless his word today as we just look into some things in the word I'm going to be speaking today on when to omnipotence meet and we're we're speaking here as we've been ministering on the people of the book it's a subject that I have ministered on since I visited the land of of Israel last year and just have been sharing some of the things that inspired my heart while I was there and as we look into the word to see even as they are people that have been returned to their homeland that I believe that the Bride of Christ is a people that we have been turned to our homeland and our homeland is the Holy Ghost the Word of God amen and and of course with Israel there there are many things to be conquered as you know the Golan Heights has just been acknowledged by our own presidents as being a part of Israel and so they you know they are people that are trying to reclaim an ancient homeland and of course they couldn't have done that without God and they couldn't do that without prophecy being for them because the Word of God had set it into motion many many years ago and so is the Word of God put into motion that the the words of the promises says I will restore saith the Lord and so with Israel their mountains to be conquered fig trees to be moved scriptures to be fulfilled and I think there are same thing for us there are mountains to be moved there are fig trees to be to be moved and scriptures to be fulfilled and Jesus is telling us that nothing shall be impossible to you and that's because that of course God is sin and Elijah prophet to turn our hearts back to faith again remember this was necessary in our day in our hour because we were a people that were bewildered and confused and an analyst scattered out in denominationalism as Israel was a people bewildered and confused about even their origin or their destiny and then were persecuted group that were scattered out among the nations and as God has gathered down my believe that God has gather the people back to his word and so - and of course as that will unfold in the the hours of days ahead and the Tribulation Period after the bride is gone where Elijah and Moses will will bring and present Christ back - on the Jews again and their hearts will be turned back to the faith of the of the father's back to the faith of the received the son Jesus Christ and I believe in this day that God has promised the same for us that he sent unto us a message in this last day to turn our hearts back to faith again to cause us to start believing a man and to believe we're gonna have to believe in the impossible that with that which is impossible with man is possible with God that even as we look forward to a resurrection and to a rapture though how impossible that may seem for God to be able to gather all the dust of the bones of the ones that have went on before is through the ages and gather them up in a glorious resurrection and the rapture of the church and change us as we're standing on our feet in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I believe it'll take a people that believe in the impossible Amen that the impossible becomes a possibility and this is what we're wanting to look today because remember as I just want to share with you just a few little quotes that there there will come a messenger in the last day that will guide the people back to the first fruit back to the original faith granite Lord that is great messenger among us now the great Christ the Holy Spirit made vivid made understanding opening up the word and revealing us to us may he guide them back to the original Pentecostal faith like Peter said on the day of Pentecost repair number one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins man and there's a promise that goes with that and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost which is our homeland because the Holy Ghost is the word and the word is the Holy Ghost because the word is God and the Holy Ghost is God that one and the same and to be turned back to our homeland is to turn us back to the word again but it's more than a word it's the person of Jesus Christ the reality reality of the gospel also brother Branham would say in the god of this evil age he said just as a seed of the church fell back there with the signs and the wonders and the Living Christ among them it ends up in the last days under the ministry of Malachi 4 and restores back again the original faith that was once given what a promise that yes a mime again and going beyond the camp this sharing a few of these he said Lord the pool is ready for the first move after repentance because the first move after repentance is to be baptized in his name right and then a promise to to receive the Holy Ghost and in this last day our calling back to the original faith the original prescription while we sing to many people away from Christ dying under these other man-made prescriptions but they may be ever so good in their denomination but lord I want your prescription our doctor there's a doctor there's a balm in Gilead there's a physician here to heal ever since its soul to heal ever physical being great doctor of all times great creator of the heavens and earth come now will you among us and speak to us in the name of Jesus Christ I tell you that was his prayer damned that's our prayer today man again and the Feast of the trumpet said therefore during the time of the Reformation that come into reformers as the seven seals proved it was but in the last days now honey believes were living in the last days it was supposed to be revealed again we find the scripture Malekith for that there is to be an anointing come down to restore again that original faith and to bring the faith of the people back to the original Pentecost the aroo the faith of the fathers I believe that today don't you and then there's an anointing that has come down I want to say that anointing is still here among us to bring either bring us back to the original faith again to cause our hearts to believe not to sit down in this last and evil agent and Laodicea into a faithless generation but a people who believe in this last days how many believers this morning and man that God wants you to believe his word and his word a promises promises a restoration in this last day a restoration of faith again for people to be able to begin to believe to believe for the impossible again in feasts of the trumpets he would come to the end of his sermon there and say remember that Gentile bride is to have a prophet called Elias Elijah that is to call them out of the traditions the bride just the same as these prophets called the Jews out of Judaism to Christ the atonement this will happen there under the Ministry of Moses and Elijah the Gentiles already knows the atonement but it's to call the bride back to the original atonement so again to call us back to the original Tommy to the original blood to the original prescription and man to the original promise to the original Pentecost a man now there of course have been organizations that have been grafted into the vine of the tree and these are like suckers that are suffering the life and competing for the light but in spite of all of that God is gonna have a bride tree a man all that the cattle are made I'm quoting Joel chapter 2 and the caterpillar ate and he said I will restore saith the Lord and Malachi 4 tells us we'll be brought back to the original faith like it was on the day of Pentecost the faith of the fathers and we believe it will come and he says I believe it it is time for it now well how many's ready for a man well I'll tell you we see limbs that are withering away we see people that are caught up in Laodicea we see people that are are dying on the vine as it was but ever forever ever Lamb that is on that vine that the father didn't plan it will be plucked up and everything that will not bear fruit will be cut off a man it's a fruit barrel now and God is looking for people who will offer back the fruit of faith again or people who will believe him now we we notice that again that in in this a restoring faith were promised in Malachi 4 to be returned back to the original faith back to the original seed back to the seed that mean like it began on the day of Pentecost back to the same doctoring word by word powered by power spirit by the same thing exactly like it was back in the beginning through signs and wonders of the living presence of God a man so after 2,000 years we can see today he's still alive and he's still living among his people dwelling among the candlesticks walking among his church revealing himself to be still the living Christ he's not a dead Creed and he's not a form of godliness that denies the power thereof but he's a real living God that will show itself alive among his people but you know with the Israel and in that day of Israel there was so much unbelief in the land and even the disciples their hearts was being excited to believe and they were starting to believe and power was being given to them to cast Satan out and as it did there came a very hard case to them that we'll read about here in a moment man matter of fact let's just read it in Matthew 17 and verse 19 and the disciples were brought a very difficult case of a child that would constantly because of an evil spirit threw itself into fire throw itself in the water always a self-destructive spirit that - sounds like the world we live in today self-destruction everywhere my people are so hurting until they're cutting themselves a man and destroying their own lives but I want to testify today of a god that's a restorer somebody with me now that just brings from my mountain my memory a little child down at youth camp a young girl actually a teenage girl that had comin and C it had a difficult life and hated herself want to destroy herself and slice the wrists she was in so much pain demons had got ahold of her until she was cutting her South and time to destroy her life and then God and His mercy got ahold of her and turned her life around hey man but you know even though her life was turned around now as a young woman she still bores the scholars this is what we try to keep you young people from having to do bear the scars the hurts and shame of sin the men that if you come to the Lord at a young age this is why we have youth camp and then give you a chance get you in an atmosphere where the Holy Spirit can deal with your life and change you man not only that we've tried to provide that in every service to have that kind of atmosphere where people can be born again and my not other dried confession but a real life-changing experience that brings you to God and cleanses your life and deals with it that sin issue and changes your nature this young girl now this had happened to her and she was now in an camp and and she was still wearing the scars the scars of on her risks where she had sliced it and there to us she wanted to lift her hands to worship God she wanted to praise His name but she was seemed to the scars she wore you know maybe sleeves and things that would hold over other past shames she's sitting there in the service and she's saying oh I would really like the worship god I'd really like to give him praise I really love just hurling raised my hands but I have this everybody will see these ugly scars but she said he's my Lord and I'm gonna do it anyhow and she raised her hands and begin to worship Him a man freely and begin to praise God and as she did the scars fell off arms and they were no more visible a man completely healed and gold I'm talking about a God that is rich in mercy I'm talking about a God whose a God of first chances and second chances and third chances and four chances helicopter that not only shield you and deliver you but also remove the scars of your life high will restore sayeth the Lord but away this young man in the Bible he constantly was trying to destroy his life and the Bible said the disciples had prayed over him remember they had been given power to cast him out now something happened it was struggling with some his shoes and they were not able to cast the Spirit out and then they brought him to Jesus you know this is always important if we can get just teach you in the presence of Jesus laws we're just men gathered here amen maybe that ain't much but when God gathers among us we're not just a lifeless your meaningless gathering of people and man we're people of God that's what we want we want his presence welcomed but they wait so they would gentlemen and finally that would come to Jesus and bring him to Jesus and Jesus would cast him out and verse 19 of chapter 17 then the disciples came to Jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out and Jesus said in them because of your unbelief for verily I say to you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say to this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing somebody say nothing nothing shall be impossible to you I wonder do we as Christians believe that and we ought to this is something that our Lord said about us hey man I think of these disciples the failure to cast out the evil spirit by the disciples III can't would like to look at it this way for a moment the disciples started out perhaps they were praying in faith and when immediate results were not seen they began praying and unbelief and maybe they started out as Peter did with great faith walking on the water but then begin to look at the mountainous waves and the tumultuous winds and maybe faith gave way to unbelief as they began to look at this voice symptoms as he would frost at the mouth as he would roll there and his in his spasm in his agony in the cries of the parents and her unbelieving and to grow and grow and grow until Jesus came you know faith jesus said all it takes it's just faith as a grain of mustard seed just a tiny bit of phrases all minister needed to conquer any mountain faith is a powerful gift of God and the inner born-again believer has faith a man using the you know me and we know that because without faith it's impossible to please God he that cometh to God must believe that he is nothing he was or that he was gonna be but that he is and that he'll reward those that diligently seek Him this is part of the very law of faith notice as we're saying but using the that tiny mustard chia seed ax as an example Jesus illustrates the omnipotent power of God unleashed in those who have through faith true faith is a new product it's a limited in power when it's connected to an unlimited God hey man now Dever man is even given a measure of faith I would say I would submit that even unbelief is faith it's a it's faith that's aimed in the wrong direction believing in the wrong thing you gotta have a lot of faith to believe there is no God you've gotta have a lot of faith to believe that this world here just kind of came out of you know I'm just noting that there's nothing created nothing hey man you've got to have a lot of faith to believe that so it's faith but it's aimed in the wrong direction that's what Malachi 4 was sent to do to turn our hearts back come on to faith again two calls of people and start believing again a people to believe in what others are thinking impossible they begin to see as a possibility amen and Jesus would say nothing is impossible 200 beliefs the biggest obstacle in your life the greatest thing that you're facing the biggest problem in your family there is nothing impossible now but he illustrates by that seed that little seed of faith he says you know there's enough omnipotent in that faith that it will create it absolutely move a mountain or it'll look up a big tree or in a movie the obstacles there's enough evidence in that but it's got to be connected to our not never to God hey man now this is what we're going to be talking about today is that connection that connects you to an omnipotent God now everything from the writing of the Old Testament to Calvary to the church ages with its messengers the message that we received the seven seals revealed every mystery of the Bible has been revealed in order to prepare you for a miracle I you know I shared some little quotations last week and I want to just bring him back to your the father in front of your memory actually was two weeks ago because brother John Andy's bless us last weekend but anyway we he said brother Branham would talk about Noah building our and he said he was not only working a miracle he was preparing for a miracle I wonder how many hearts are really prepared for the miracle of the body change prepared for the miraculous of the dead and price rising oh the great rapture of the church well that's what's promising our generation and in order to bring it there's got to be hearts prepared for that rapture now he said now the church today is not only having miracles but it's preparing for a marathon and I just brought it out gentle even last Sunday you know we have seen God working in so many different ways and when we've seen him work through the messenger through the divine healing movement whether with the blind eyes open and the deaf ears hearing and the many miraculous things has taken place are you with me I mean we've seen God working in his miracles and and his mighty wonders and and by the working of the Holy Spirit let me just stop just for a moment let me share with you just this newspaper article I I received today um it's an old one that comes from 1949 but it's tweaking about the services of William Branham back in 1949 in the great divine healing campaign when the Holy Spirit was moving in such a miraculous way and remember it is to prepare us to believe dr. shreek down on unbelief but to believe not become more faithless Jesus wondered when he look down through time he said will I find faith on the earth this is what he's looking for somebody to believe him now but anyway this is a little newspaper article I'm just going to share it with you this this comes here from a paper in representing cities of North Chicago it was dated March the 24th 1949 and the the reporter was Fanny Wilson and she was writing in the community news of the Chicago paper said in the last night's service a young boy paralyzed in his arms legs and back twisted out of shape was brought by his mother from Bensenville Illinois and was prayed far and immediately after prayer he walked straight and steadily from the platform without aid to women who had been blinded with cataracts for two years were healed in the same service and after being led to the platform they they were prayed then prayed for the first was able to see and walk as her husband said even those bloodshot veins and her and her eyes were clearly she followed up with that said the main difference between William Branham and most everyone else is then the Bible to them that the Bible is ancient history to their to him is just as vital and a positive of force now as it was in the days of Jesus of Nazareth and what makes the story difference is that Reverend William Branham proceeds to prove his contention not that he can dear contends but far from it but brother Branham is more humble than all the humble men you have ever seen put together now so you see this was their record and what God did even before I was born to start getting your faith to believe a man a little mind then know how we ought to be today are people of faith are people who can believe are people who will stand on the Word of God come on amen Oh mind we have seen God moved now we can testify of his feeling virtuous we can testify a big healing cancer and alopecia and given the sight back to the blind and healing brain bleeds and on and on and on and on and on that we can see that has happened right here in this assembly because people have began to believe because these kind of things that we spoke out of the past has inspired our faith to believe God will restore that time still God that God still heals that God still delivers that still saves that he still fills with the Holy Ghost that stopped is the same hallelujah and his name has power his name is full of glory and his name is above every other name never deceive never problem has about through the name of Jesus that it's a name of Jesus every knee cancer has to bow to it blind eyes that's about to it and whenever disease has to bow to the name of Jesus and confess he's ruler are you with me so now brother Branham was saying another church today is not only having miracles but it's preparing for a miracle the coming of the Lord Jesus and the rapture the church to be taken up give me a church ready and he uses it like this visualized to see signs and and to see the admitted God and the great power of God moving among the people which the rapture will be an easy thing when Jesus comes they'll be caught up because they believe in such sure we're at the end time we're at a junction road the crossing time the ending of a dispensation the beginning of a new and there's been six of those and we're on the seventh in other words we come through 6,000 years since Eden and man's fall and we're about to see the dawn of a millennial day now so again he speaks about this said of nebadon spoke had every Junction and when the church cooled off and then the n' evidence both miracles take place and this is a junction of all junctions let me tell you just because he said that some 50 60 years ago doesn't change it because we're still at that junction we're still right on the border of the rapture we're still right on the border of a millennium ahead we're still right here on the edge of Phoenix and of all things and we're here at the junction of junctions hey man and there this is the end time how many can declare that man that you saw a brother Timna there's a they've been saying that for years let me tell you why cuz her husband in times hey man there was an end time for eating back in Adams day there was an end time for Noah oh man there was an end time for Sodom and Gomorrah there was in time for the Jewish dispensation and now we're at the end time for the Gentile dispensation so yeah there's always been in times but they've all been 42 that's in time and we're hearing the fulfilling of all things the wrapping up of the dispensation of grace she said this is the end of the whole history of the world is right now so you can expect omnipotence to speak and you can expect the greatest and yes miracles that ever happened on the earth will happen in the next few years to come and we're still in that dispensation of the unfolding of the end time now Jesus the gospel of Jesus is totally different than this namby-pamby gospel is being preached out in the world today his doctrine is totally different than the doctrines that are being preached in a majority of churches around the world let me just go ahead and define one more time for you that doctrine and mark 1:22 and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught his one that had Authority and not as the scribes and that Jesus did a mighty miracle and brother great healing in verse 27 and they were all amazed it is so much as they questioned among themselves saying one thing is this what new doctrine is this but with authority commandeth even the evil unclean spirits and they do obey Him so the real doctrine of Jesus what is preached cast Satan out that's what real salvation is it's not teaching you how to live with your devil how to live with your complex how to live with your sin how to live with your habit it's casting shake it out and true doctrine when it's preached and I will bring for the holy people a man you are brittle Oh hallelujah and I bring the Holy Spirit down and cause you to live a holy life modesty will no longer be a word we talk about but it'll be a word that is demonstrated it is people both men and women come on church somebody help me preach now a man what kind of doctrine is this what new doctrine is this and I'll tell you what this is still new to most places because they don't know this doctor this doctrine just out unclean spirits now let's talk about this for a moment in the original going into the land leave in Egypt as Israel would go for their first time into their homeland as Justin was looking into the land God would speak to him and say be the strong and very courageous foreign to you I have given this lamb and ever foot ever place your foot is given to tread upon that I have given to you a mite now I want to just bring that right down to you because we are here taking possession of every promise of God this is our holy land amen this is what we must conquer this is what we must possess in other words come on somebody every devil that is squatted on a promise of God has to be cast out from every unbelief has got to be tore down and my people have got to stop believing this book is mine every word of this is mine every promise of this is mine is mine Jesus died for it he paid for it and it's my inalienable right to possess this land hey ma'am now the same thing with Joshua when he stood there looking at that new land that God spoke to him and caught but giving these words be strong and be thou courageous for do you I have given this land could we just bring that and fast-forward it and place it right in our moment in our time hey man this promise is still real if it meant that for a physical people for a physical land Amen which was only foreshadowing and typing and speaking of something greater to come somebody help me preach aim and then so that word should be so applicable to us in this moment be not strong be a courageous I've given you this mountain I'm giving you this land I'm giving you this promise it is yours it's for your children and your children's children put those in our fall even as many as the Lord our God shall call I've given you this land don't put your foot on it go possess it hey mom now would you to hear the words of a prophet if he would say and as I was with Moses so will I be with you there's volumes spoken that title as I was with Moses so will I be with you as I was during that Exodus so I'm here in this Exodus now Joshua the new commander to lead an army his second to the place for the great man like Moses stood there was no little task and I think of a minister today that is called a God to step into the tracks where Jesus do it what a command what a commission but that's what but each that's called of God is commissioned to stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each Minister is called to stand where he would the works that I do say you do also its ministers ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed and that's quite a command hallelujah man I know that too man I answered that to man some fifty years ago when he called me to preach come on now man and I've stood right there in that very tracks where Jesus stood and then proclaiming the Word of God saying that God makes a promise to this last generation and it does in the end with a godsend and a prophet it continues right out as as a bride is called in this last day and God calling up people for his name sake amen amen the works that I do say you do also every minister is ordained of God commanded the stand and the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command that's what we're looking at I'm looking at this promise I'm looking now listen I'm not in any way trying to say I'm a Joshua I'm just simply saying I'm not Caleb that stands with Joshua a man that looks and say give me my Mountain now we're more than able to take the land then we steal the unbelief of the people and say it's still possible Laodicea isn't too great lukewarmness isn't too powerful to stop the Word of God from being fulfilled in this hour Bobby's gonna believe it Jesus is still the same now look everywhere Jesus went he conquered now wait a minute I'm gonna start right here now just a minute because that's your Commission everywhere the soul of your feet shall tread upon I've given that to you hey man everywhere he went he conquered everywhere you go your to conquer the Bible said to him that overcometh and he spoke it to the last stage didn't he so somebody's gonna be a conqueror in the last stage are you with me man so he conquered everything that could be conquered when he was on the earth he conquered passion so will you pride so will you he conquered sickness so will you a man he conquered Devils so will you a man even when he died he conquered death and if you go into death you will rise and triumph over death - there will not be one of the Saints left behind hey man notice now as we go on he when he when he arose he conquered hell and so are you you say what brother Tim hell is all around us and I agree every kind of spirit has been released into this age in this hour in this time but you will conquer hell you have been ordained to conquer the evil that is around you you have not been called to defeat you have been called up to walk in victory when he rose he conquered hell he went up and conquered everything that was against mankind and when of the red wine press of God and crushed it down and conquered death hell in the grave sickness and formalities and everything else and overcome it all and rose on the third day and conquered all the atmospheres above and cut that mist that was between God and man oh and connected I want you to get this word connected heaven and earth together oh man glory amen there he stands a mighty Conqueror since she ripped the veil in - there he is he has the keys of death and hell hanging on his side he says fear not he laid his right hand or his power of all men raise him up but the power of is right here and so said don't fear I am he that was and that is and that shall come I am the first and the last and he that lived and died and is alive forevermore hey man how many of you today can say hey man hey man the summons we say hello behold the mighty conquer remember all the end blame you I believe that's what God did for us today to see the antecessor hey man the atonement behold him in plain view there he stands the mighty conquer since he read the veil in - no I just want to tell you he came to connect heaven and not together this is what happened even at the River Jordan when the great dumb of God came upon the Lamb of God and abode with him it was connecting man and heaven together again somebody with me that through him we can become connected I'm talking about connected because it's going to take your faith connected to an omnipotent God and then from dividends to work and we're in our where there must be I'm limited so this thing in fact every one of you that are born again or a display of omnipotence Amen what actually happened was to omnipotence met there was a potential in the seed gene of God that was resident in you by predestination hallelujah and then by the connection of the Holy Ghost coming to you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you didn't have the seed in yet there's nothing in you to respond a man you just become a false anointed one at the end time but if there's a seed in you you became connected with God with heaven the moment you were born again hallelujah every every egg of a woman is dead unless is connected with the life of the male and the Turks is dead if it's not connected with the life of God you remain dead as a person unless you get connected but when you're connected there's omnipotence power to conquer sin I believe the devil unclean spirits the power God and the deliverance so every man or woman filled with the Holy Spirit is connected with God because of a new birth and that gives a connection with God as he resides within the soul now again this brings us right down to the use of the word Zoe life we liked the name name our kids Owen and you know sometimes going about without meaning but Jesus said I give them eternal life which is Zoe life and that Zoe that word eternal comes from that word Zoe which means the life of God a man here those that receive me I give them life all that artists that is all - sent shockwaves through you today hey man he puts his life in you abides his life and his life is an imminent life his life knows no limits there is no hindrance to it come on it is all-powerful hey man it'll blow everything out of the way notice now when we have God's life in us it makes us believe like God does hallelujah let me say to you when you have God's life in us it makes us believe like God does that whatsoever His Word says in the materialize a man for it says by His stripes were healed and for you a believer that settles it amen God said son wouldn't so when a man is born of the Spirit of God he's a son of God and then he believes for things that are impossible he still believes it why because his God is in him shall I say it again here's God he is in him by the Holy Spirit and he believes hey man now if you hadn't got the Holy Spirit in there you hadn't Hallett don't have anything for his mind - one to rest the bones it'll just wander here and there in doubt and unbelief he doesn't know them can't comprehend the things of God because if my natural man cannot understand the things of God they're just foolish to him but now he said then he then he talks about the Pentecostal and the poor and the Full Gospel and he said one of the things the greatest things were the greatest hindrance among us is it you're trying to place the great things of God yet to come when you're right in the middle of it now and this is always what it being you know one day one day the bride will have her power one day she's going to come into omnipotence one day one day and I'm telling you that your prophet of God taught you is today not one day this is today not a future day this is the day a man this is the day this is a day where people who are full of drugs and alcohol can have dominance over alcohol and drugs this is the day where those that are bent down and crippled in their spirit because of pornography this day they can have power over yesterday you can walk in freedom this day not another day today this is a day that if you're bogged down with a cancer you can be healed yesterday today today the Bible said today is the day of salvation this is the day then of deliverance today today you can shake off your lukewarm spirit today you can get rid of your unbelief it's an unclean spirit unbelief can I say it again it's an unclean spirit today you can get rid of the unclean spirit well you know people say well just wait in the Millennium to come well what would these things be in the Millennium when we don't need healings that's the next stage to be issued in the great millennium to come but now we're in the Holy Ghost age somebody help me preach amen not we are in the Holy Ghost say Amen now you are the sons of God not well and now we are seated in heavenly places not we will be we are now right here now sons and daughters of God seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus there we are then all things are possible then and when all these little shackles and dark shadows gets broke away then the Holy Spirit can come right in and perform miracles Amen there's nothing impossible with it then but just that little doubt sitting there now as a born-again believer God wants every doubt removed he did all kinds of things did you start believing come on hey man God wants it once you connected to him by having faith in God when you believe it begins to connect you with an omnipotent God now let me let me share with you this profound statement from the Patmos vision cut every obstacle from human being that they might be connected like in the Garden of Eden now I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it man there is omnipotent you believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did not he say mark 11:20 do whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you say so man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent hey man so can't you see then when you put your faith in an omnipotent God that's then omnipotence there it's beginning to work can't you see that your faith makes you up Kniffin it you said but my faith is so small but but that's not true we we have been given translation faith this word has given you faith for a rapture hey man now let me get say it if you're looking for another personality to come if you're not looking for another message to come that a give you rapture and faith ain't nothing else gonna give it if this message of calls your heart to stop believer ain't nothin comin gonna do it it's gonna cause you to believe now hey man we've had their lives in ministry to turn our hearts back to faith to cause a people to start believin are you with me hey man I'd like to share this from spiritual food in due season brother band said I want to get you built up now in this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour the faith is going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapture and faith and so we want you to believe that in all that you've seen and heard and the word you have been heard preached the signs and the wonders that you've seen done we want you to accumulate it all together in your heart and consider whether it be God or not hey man well if it's God it was sent to build you up in the Oracle of faith in the Word of Faith in the faith of this hour let me share with you again from the token message I'm looking for a time for a break forth of the Spirit of God in these last days that were not living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for a rapture and faith just before it comes and everything is setting straight and ordered for that and I believe we're we're now at the time that the word should have preeminence net words the word is what we believe that we quit out doubting I'm floundering and our fluttering around and I grab things right in that word I believe it's a time we should lay aside creeds and our thoughts and come back to the word hey mom the message countdown he would explain how that the power had began to rise he would use the natural event inventions to show the spirits of progress he say would come from the oxcart to do maybe the bicycle to to to the automobile to the airplane to the to the jet all the way to rocket power the man power to take us out of this dimension into another and he says I've said some rough things prettier up things about their plane automobile remember their horsepower to all of its horsepower the church is just moving up Holy Ghost power it's the Holy Ghost so we're justified by your ministers know that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us the Holy Ghost feels us and the Holy Ghost gives us rapture and faith see as we move up hallelujah the Holy Ghost gives Rock through faith a man again he would talk about this and why Christ speak and he says a man just noticed he said he asked me about the rapture the coming in the rapture and we know we've lived the time out and at the time of the rapture is at hand and we're looking for rapture and faith that a pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that will change these bodies that we live in a man we swim we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him here before us and then we see a God who can take a cancer that's he demand and raise them up to strong healthy man that ought to give rocktron faith to people a man that when the that when the light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken into the heavens yes there's got to be something like that happen hey man when we see God begin to move among us heal our sick and bring deliverance are you with me Church man it ought to give a ruptured faith it all calls us to start believing in the impossible man we're here at Easter time it's Resurrection hour it's resurrection time that those seeds that we've laid in the grave no matter how long they have laid there the atmosphere is changing hallelujah there's a spring time come oh it's a restoration hour that's the season begins to change Oh hallelujah I looked here the other day we're looking at the changing of the season and I couldn't help but reflect that here we're at a power of the changing of the seasons remember we're moving out of the wintertime and went into the restoration our a man God singing a prophet was a part of that restoration our but you being restored is a part of that restoration our the springtime a man for that which is laid dormant but as powerful begins to push the life that's in the seed that has laid dormant for years begins to push out against the soil against the thing that buried it and held it down are you with me and I say you've been held down long enough you've been bound down you've been in darkness long enough hey man there's a light on the inside of you omnipotence it's beginning to respond to the Annapolis of the season as the cycle changes and that Sun begins to shine upon the seasons buried in the ground Amen light began to spring forth leaves begin to come up blossoms begin to blossom fruit begins to come on the branch it's our it's the time that a piece of people blossom out and the power of God amen what an hour we're living in it ought to give us rapture and faith the man that just something just kind of exists our faith up for a little bit and drops back down remember we one miracle ought to prepare us for another miracle a mammal one thing God does preparedness for another greater thing hey mom ma this is what it ought to be you said well but my faith is small this small is a tiny grain of mustard seed that's enough to move a mountain but it's got to be put to work somebody hear me he's a high priests working on what not on your crying not on your repenting not on your on your faith but on your confession amen no matter how much faith you got it will never do you any good gee but works with it cause faith without works is dead hey man there's a potential laying in the seed and it can be there for years and years and years and lay in there until the atmosphere gets right but until there's wax come on that comes with the potential of the seed and it'll just lay there for years and years we got years and years we're out of time hey man we're right down here they're the last messages come to the church the last Messenger has come to the church come on the last prophet has come to the church I realize according to revelation 10 eight the bride prophesize seemed that must prophesy again but it's simply saying a bride under a messenger becomes the final boys to the final eight it's not another message it's the same message that same passing being preached again you haven't ever tried other people demonstrating Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hey man where people looking for a resurrection of all the dead of the seven ages if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting a celestial body and with that spirit and that soul is celestial body you'll raise up into this again this natural body for the great millennium and you have the power in you now to do that so we're going to where in the world you get scripture for that if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it shall also what make a lab quicken your mortal body hallelujah so therefore it's already laying in you resurrection power is already laying in yet that's what raised you up from the things of the world it's the same thing that will quicken your mortal body hey man it ain't something that's coming it's something already here it's something resident on the inside of you but if that power that you have in you now but that power that you have in you now could make a new world now these are some astounding things you can go back to all Roberts you can go to a a Alain they never spoke words like these they didn't have a message this is not just a sign there was a voice with the side there was a message from God you know with the sign notice now you but but that power that you have in you could they make a new world now listen God doesn't have little weak spots and big heavy spots is powerful the least little touch of God is omnipotent hallelujah do you do you have the Holy Ghost in you then that in each little Church of God is omnipotent so powerful resurrection life hey mouth he says I'm trying to get you in the faith now you know that something happened to you as a Christian do you know it you used to ride down yonder in the muck with all that muck and sin drinking gambling things of the world well as soon as you believe that Christ forgave your sins you raised up above that stuff hey man how many how many in this building has been risen with Christ and man it raised you up above sin didn't it Amen now the only thing that you have to do is to write higher in the healing is this have more faith just keep pushing it out my day you remember that's the secret of a grain of mustard seed a man that in that mustard seed is a life and then that is a potential to become a mighty tree somebody with me now it lays all within the seed every leaf that he'll ever put on is in the sea ever to ever live every piece of bark every attribute of a tree is already laying in the sea hey man never saying that it was already laying in you by the new birth hey man it all you've got to do is start drinking and pushing out drinking in and pushing out drink it responding to the atmosphere responding through the movin of the Holy Ghost responding to the call of God drink in and push out drink em and push out three can and push out I wish I had it right now I'd show you maybe Timothy you can you can send it to the guys up there and they can put it up for me but of a seed that a crock of mighty rock let me just tell you friends that's that faith that's in you it's going to come through look he said I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing and if he said it its obligated to him he's obligated to do it he's under obligation to his own word he's got to do it he made a promise come on somebody he may he put it in his word I'm gonna do this and God will do it he said I'll have a rapture in the last day he's gonna do it man whatever he's gonna do to do it if he has to defeat ever devil and he will he'll do it he got a defeat to unbelief in your life he'll do it whatever he's gonna do he'll do it when he said to Pharaoh let my people go he was gonna do it you won't let him go then I'll make you I'll make you wish you would have hey man I'll turn the screws down on you listen it's time we put the screws on the devil you don't have a right to our land you don't have a right to our children you don't have the right to our grandchildren you right to our bodies you don't have a right to our husbands you don't have a right to our wives you don't have a right to the church you have no rights no legal authority the word has been really let my people go and with a nipple it's big thing starts happening Devils are getting defeated the element goes on the Ragnar because of nipple and begins to speak but in order for am nipa to speak there had to become a people speaking with an impetus if you're sick you're not a Christian become a Christian right now so that healing power can come in you by being a Christian and that'll give you a fait - right above sin it'll give you faith and everything that you have need of in the journey and this journey is right in you now and the only thing you have to do is have faith in God that pushes out good things for you which is you by the Holy Spirit do you understand clearly now like to bring out just a couple of more quotations on this now if we're born again of the Spirit of God God don't have little weak parts and big strong parts did you hang up on me no at least touch of God is omnipotent he's all together God amen the Holy Spirit that is in you is the Spirit of Jesus and is no weaker in you than it was in Jesus it's just as powerful in you as it was in Jesus a man of Christ not being you you are none of his but if you're here then his power is resident within you all right so God don't have little weak parts and big strong part he's all together God and you've had enough God in you till it's just a barely a shadow that's enough power to make a new earth that's enough power to make a new moon and a new system it's God and it's strong and right now I never believe in here that has eternal life which is God's Spirit in you is enough power that a raise up the dead that is healed the sick that sets orbits in conditions high now listen but it's controlled by love that spirit that is in you the Bible calls it the law of the spirit of life so we it's not that we just go out and begin to do things in our own will well I've got this power I'll go do it but it is that we find that will of God hey man now notice again I wonder why he brought the illustrates enough this is what a seed can do amen this is what that that life of God can do in you that's over any hindrance any Rock a man that can I tell it to you you are unstoppable you are entertaining hallelujah the mountains has to be moved because of nebadon start speaking in accordance with the word and I'd see the life in you begins to push out and as it pushes out it begins to crack the rocks around you begins to move the mountains and the boulders and the things and the heavy loads that has held you back and I'm telling you there's nothing that can hold you back as a seat of God and if God has given you I promise of God hear my words now and let me prophesy if God has given you a promise of God a man there is nothing can keep that promise from happening a man just put your faith in a nipper that God and omnipotence starts moving and Crocs begin cracking open and Mountain starts moving if it's one grain at a site at a time it starts moving but it's gonna move and tell it moves till it's gone completely hey man if you had enough of God in here till it's just barely a shadow there's no power now in every believer here's eternal life God's Spirit in you enough power that a raised up today that he healed the sick they sent their orbits and conditions but it's controlled by law and that's the spirit within you your sons and daughters of God the same spirit that you got in you will raise you up at the day of the resurrection Jesus when he was here on earth when he died his soul descended to hell and he preached to the spirits that were in prison a man and then that repented not in the long-suffering of the days of Noah this is true this is found in the book of Peter he said so his body went into the grave but when he died he commended his spirit unto the hands of God and his spirit went to God his soul went to hell his body with the grain and Jesus what's now was barred out barred out from the resurrection until the scripture could be fulfilled notice he could not come back because he had to stay in the grave for three days and nights but when the scripture was all fulfilled this bar was taken away and his spirit descended his soul and his Souls his body and he rose again all right now hold it it's a principle that goes with the power was in Jesus but he couldn't raise on the first day he could raise on the second day he had the raised on the third day come on because there was a word that barred him from resurrection power it laid within him but it could not work until it moved in the right position are you with me now that's why in the Millenium I had the bars that are placed by the word that banned us from Eden's power will be totally lifted from and our full potentials as sons of God will be manifested in that day in the millennium ahead we will not use an axe to move a tree there we will speak and it'll be done a man we will work but not by the sweat of our brow somebody with me Amen we will be exercising our full potential but right now we're still held back from fulfilling all of that until the appropriate hour are you with me now why is it that some still die even though we pray and believe you know I was with I was with brother Jerry show and I can take you back a decade ago when he was down with this condition within his lungs where he couldn't breathe and was having to have oxygen and dare one holy or one day the Holy Spirit moved on me as I walked past him he was still serving as a deacon and I walked past this man gasping for every breath sometimes fighting sleeping the service because he's not getting enough oxygen but still faithful to come to church I wonder what kind of testimony you're gonna face on a day like that and here he would come service after service and his pain and gasping for breath are you with me one service of walk past him at the end of his service the Holy Spirit just moving and in the audience and as I walked down this was in the old church who walked down past him walked down the steps and as I walk by I saw him there and I laid my hands on him and I rebuked that affliction and for three years he went without needing additional oxygen you know why God's a healer God said deliver a man but here he comes out now age comes own time comes own and the time of his departure is at hand say it how you want to God wants some of us to be alive and remain for the rapture and some will put in the grave but don't worry about those in the grave they'll rise first hey man hey man then brother Jerry dare who would go on go back on oxygen and now labour try he you know he'd me thank God for healing me and there would be little healings you remember when he laid there there in the hospital completely died and God raised him back up again and the doctor would call him Lazarus friend they would put him on Hospice then he would defy all odds in the years a year or more later it would be before he would die but he still would have to go by the way of the grave it was God's law and then no matter how we prayed how much we believed how we believed just like we did the first time you know it wasn't we wasn't believing we were still believing but he was fired out from that promise because he was accounted to be among those who would go and sleep and he has a dream of his self and he said I saw myself a young man running down the path there let breathe deep I can breathe I could run and just a few days later he got that shilling and crossed the dementia and today jeri-show is a well man sister Rachel just saw him the other day sit down on her bed right there and say and she reached over and grabbed him by the shoulder and felt of him and said Jerry you're real you really said yes I just want you to know I always hear you when you call my name [Music] you think the dad you think the dad came here the Bible says they do man you think they can't see in this dementia the Bible says they do look at the souls on the altar they're not dead they're alive Jerry is more alive now that what he ever was but he was barred out from healing here on earth to get a greater healing there somebody with me but it didn't keep up nipa tons from working cuz one breath beyond this old feeble body was a new celestial body that doesn't have problems breathing hallelujah glory to God so what is it that some still die yet though we pray and believe and he says yet nothing shall be impossible to you it's because it's some yes yet must fulfill the word that was given because of our original sin man's original sin the day you eat thereof that day you die and some must fulfill that but one day may it be today one day the last one the last one will go what we call by the way of the grave the last one will die you say brother Tim you're way out on a limb let me just go back for a moment in the Jewish dispensation the last one to come in was the thief on the cross the last one finally King Abraham died Jacob died come on all of them died and this last one Oh hallelujah man I can't imagine him now that's just my imagination here but I can just picture him running down the aisles going right down into that region what there is a paradise and screaming out listen folks he's coming the one you've been looking for that one Abraham you preach about the one sin sin you talked about the one Daniel you saw Jeremiah salt one day hey man it's this day now it's no longer another day we have reached the last one and the last one it's running through and he's making the announcement to the restaurant he's coming and he makes a little pit stop down in the regions of the loss read your Bible he takes the keys of hell away from Satan what the devil don't have a key to his own house tanka he preaches a doe spirit that were there that would repeal in the days of Noah the Bible said so while he was in the grave he was not dead he was living he was acting he was talking he was preaching and he comes to the Saints and say today's the day little children my blood is wet on the cross and your debt is paid for in full and today the last one has come in now it's going up time and the Bible said to remember this Matthew 27 the Bible said that many that were in the grave awoke the Saints who were in the grave awoke and appeared to many there was a resurrection so I'm not way off him huh hey man if there was a resurrection for that dispensation would there be a resurrection for this dispensation and we're here when one day the last one the last person the last member of the body will breathe their last breath this man this thief on the cross would go there in the grave only to rise in a couple of days hey man one day we'll bury our last one only for them to raise in a day come on a man one day the last one will die only to raise up again hallelujah chains in a moment in a twinkling of an eye prophecy [Applause] right now test time testing hallelujah amen amen but some will be barred out but there some will fulfill that word and potential or shall I say omnipotence will come to omnipotence omnipotent faith will meet the omnipotent God in an omnipotent hour what an hour we're living what a day that will be we will not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye as an impotent power sweeps over your mortal body and gray hair comes back to right color again visions returned back to a young person and we go into an eternal camp meeting where there won't be no old people there because death and hardly with me the death an old age and all the remnants of sin will be barred out of going there [Applause] and because of that connection as he leaves here from the earth he's taking you with him he will not leave you behind he's taking you with him don't you want to go with him hey man don't you want to be a part of that great promise man admittances working and to omnipotence our coming together on a militant promise in an imminent God even a people who believe in the omnipotence will you bow your heads with me now hallelujah Jesus we just want to worship you today we just want to give praise to you because you're worthy we want to thank you that you're the omnipotent God and there's a people that nothing is impossible to them we're looking at a God who spoke things out of nothingness and brought into existence we're looking at a God that showed that power still lays in the word today that would speak omnipotence would speak and even even squirrels could be created little fishy give back its life Lord souls that were lost be overcome by the power of God things would happen because of nipa tense was speaking Lord just showed Europe nip it in power you showed your grace showed your power Lord let us be a people today who believe in that omnipotence let our hearts be turned to faith Lord we're here in the endtime your word is the truth the Word of God can't fail you sent us a message to turn our hearts back you caused us to believe and the Bible said he that believeth on me shall not be ashamed or confounded has shamed or just left as that we're holding the bag believing and nothing happens but there's a people in this day that will believe in impossible that realize nothing is impossible for this bride that's called in this last day and I'm part of that God would show us the power time on time again that power would go out hundreds of miles away and by the word just take a tumor out speak to storms because your God above omnipotence and you reign you reign over ever power over every situation your life you're not dead this is more than about just having a full of feel-good gospel you can feel good but he's got to change lives I pray Lord in your presence today that there will be that very thing that would go forth changing lives changing lives changing lives will you do your work Lord do your work do your grace your grace overshadow ever person they didn't move on ever life they move out unbelief and fear or do you have not given us the spirit of fear but a spirit of love and of a sound a disciplined mind a mind to believe your word Lord may your people realize today we're in another Easter it's Resurrection hour not as Easter because that's the season here but is your season you brought here upon the earth I will restore saith the LORD the bind will put forth has put forth another branch and that branch produces fruits just like the book of Acts we love you Lord today and we thank you Jesus we thank you for your goodness we

worthy and deserving of my praise so I use word [Music] my heart its tolls the Lord blesses his name forever he has won my heart captured my - bound them both together he has defeated me in my rebellion conquered me in my sin he has welcomed me into his presence completely invited me in he has made himself the object of my sight flooded me with mercies in the morning trying to me with grace in the night but if there was for him but what I do have is good news for my god knew that man-made words would never do for words of the tools that we use the point to the truth so he sent His Son Jesus Christ as he were living through his image of the invisible God the firstborn of creation for by him all things were created giving nothingness formation and overall things [Music] [Applause]
