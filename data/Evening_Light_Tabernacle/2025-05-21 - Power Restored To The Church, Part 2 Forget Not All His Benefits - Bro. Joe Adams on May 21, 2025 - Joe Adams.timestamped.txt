[15:46] "Father, come by my way and speak to my

[15:55] but Amen. Let's just go to him in

[16:01] Father, we're so thankful, Lord,
[16:04] to come together again, Lord, as your
[16:07] word says to do and come together and
[16:10] gather in the name of Jesus Christ.
[16:13] Lord, at the mention of that name, every
[16:15] demon has to flee. Lord, I don't know
[16:18] the needs that's here tonight, the
[16:19] situation, sicknesses, doctor's decrees,
[16:23] whatever. Lord, but Lord, there's
[16:25] nothing that can stand in face of the
[16:28] name Jesus. Lord, we call upon the name
[16:31] Jesus tonight and we ask, Father, you'll
[16:34] come and meet needs and touch hearts.
[16:36] Seen every hand that were lifted, you
[16:38] know, the need represented behind that
[16:40] hand. Lord, we don't do it out of a
[16:42] formality or a tradition, Lord. But we
[16:44] do it because we have needs and we lift
[16:47] that hand to say, "Lord, I have a need."
[16:49] And I I ask you to come by and minister
[16:51] and touch and speak, Father. Lord, you
[16:54] touch. We ask, Father, we invite you
[16:56] tonight, Lord, in this place, Lord. If
[16:58] there be any visitors among us, may they
[17:00] feel your presence, Lord, as we worship
[17:03] you in spirit and truth and and the
[17:05] spirit of God just come down and reign
[17:07] among us. I pray, bless the offering,

[17:11] song. Bless brother Joe as he ministers
[17:14] tonight. We
[17:15] pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. I
[17:20] want you just turn around, shake one's
[17:22] hand, welcome each other to the house of
[17:24] the Lord. And if you have a visitor next
[17:26] to you, be sure and make them welcome.

[35:49] be blessed tonight. If we look here, we
[35:51] want to look and we want to pick back up
[35:54] on where we spoke last time. Powered
[35:56] restored to the church. And I want to
[35:58] give a subtitle tonight. And I kind of
[35:59] wrestled over this to the last day and
[36:01] night. forget not all his benefits.
[36:05] So with that title there, you can kind
[36:07] of see pretty much where we're headed.
[36:09] Forget not all, not just some, not just
[36:12] the ones that have been made revealed to
[36:14] us. But the Bible says, "Forget not all
[36:17] of his benefits." And we pick up here in
[36:19] Acts three. It says, "Now Peter and John
[36:21] went up together into the temple at the
[36:24] hour of prayer, being the ninth hour,
[36:26] and a certain man laying from his
[36:28] mother's womb was carried, whom they
[36:30] laid daily at the gate of the temple,
[36:31] which is called beautiful, to ask alms
[36:33] of them that entered into the temple,
[36:36] who seeing Peter and John about to go
[36:38] into the temple, asked of alms." And
[36:41] Peter fastening his eyes on him with
[36:43] John, said, "Look on us." And he gave
[36:45] heed unto them, expecting to receive
[36:47] something of them. And Peter Peter said,
[36:50] "Silver and gold have I none, but such
[36:52] as I had give I thee. In the name of
[36:54] Jesus Christ, rise up and walk." And he
[36:57] took him by the right hand and lifted
[36:59] him up. And immediately his feet and his
[37:00] ankle bones receive strength. And he
[37:02] leaping up stood and walked and entered
[37:04] in with them into the temple, walking
[37:06] and leaping and praising God. And all
[37:09] the people saw him walking and praising
[37:11] God. And they knew that it was he which
[37:13] sat for arms at the beautiful gate of
[37:16] the temple. And they were filled with
[37:18] wonder and amazement at that which had
[37:20] happened unto him. God bless you. You
[37:22] can have your seats this
[37:25] evening. You know, there's things that
[37:27] God does many times that we don't
[37:29] understand.
[37:32] There's things that God does that maybe
[37:34] we can't even explain. That's right.
[37:37] Things that we go through in life that
[37:39] we question. We may ponder and we find
[37:42] here this man he was lame from his
[37:44] mother's womb 40 years the Bible tells
[37:46] us per se somewhere around there that he
[37:49] was born this way and no doubt when he
[37:52] came across Peter and John and they said
[37:54] silver and gold have I none but such as
[37:56] I have give I thee no doubt he may have
[37:59] said well what do you got and Peter
[38:00] response to him was I got faith you know
[38:03] Peter wasn't that many days from the day
[38:05] of Pentecost he had just been endued
[38:07] with power and we find here that Peter
[38:10] could tell this man that you know all
[38:12] that Jesus had heard all that Jesus had
[38:14] told me I'd fish with him I walked with
[38:17] him he told me that the things that he
[38:20] did that when he's gone that I'll do the
[38:23] same things in his absence and you know
[38:25] what Peter may have pondered those
[38:26] things and scratched his head and maybe
[38:28] he didn't completely understand what
[38:30] Jesus meant by those words but he you
[38:33] know but he knew one thing about it when
[38:34] he left the day of Pentecost he knew
[38:37] that I got it you know There's things
[38:39] that we go through in life. There's
[38:40] messages that you may hear and you you
[38:42] may not fully understand at that time of
[38:45] your life. But the one thing you got to
[38:47] be rest assured on is tonight as I got
[38:49] it. And we find there's things that God
[38:51] does. There's things that we can't
[38:52] explain. But nevertheless, what God
[38:55] does, God does it perfectly the first
[38:57] time. We understand that God doesn't
[38:59] make mistakes. That his his ways are
[39:02] perfect. His timing is perfect. His word
[39:04] is perfect. Therefore, his outcomes must
[39:07] be perfect.
[39:10] So you may not be able to understand it.
[39:12] You may not be able to explain it. You
[39:14] may be able to not be able to stack the
[39:15] quotes or stack the scriptures. But the
[39:18] thing you must say is, "I got it."
[39:21] So we find there was a man in history,
[39:23] many of you familiar with this man. He
[39:25] goes by the name of Benjamin Franklin.
[39:27] If you never heard of him, you've never
[39:28] done American history.
[39:31] But Benjamin Franklin would look up into
[39:33] the skies at night during a thunderstorm
[39:35] and he would see the cracking of
[39:37] lightning and the thunder and the
[39:38] popping and there would be light up
[39:40] there and no doubt something in his mind
[39:43] cuz he was intrigued by by the power
[39:46] that was in the sky. And notice what he
[39:48] did. He tied the key to a kite and he
[39:51] caught electricity. He said there was a
[39:54] power up there and if I can harness that
[39:57] power I can bring it down here. And
[39:59] notice when he got it, he he screamed
[40:01] out, "I got it. I got it." But Benjamin
[40:04] Franklin didn't understand really what
[40:06] he had.
[40:08] He didn't really understand the gravity
[40:11] about what he just harnessed in a little
[40:13] bottle by a kite and a key. But there
[40:16] was another man that came along. There
[40:18] you go. A man by the name of Thomas
[40:20] Edison. Many of you may have heard of
[40:22] Thomas Edison in our history books.
[40:24] Thomas Edison, he was a very, you know,
[40:26] he was a what you call it? I can can't
[40:29] think of the name of it was yeah an
[40:32] inventor creator you know he his mind
[40:34] constantly just thought about things and
[40:36] you know he looked at Benjamin Franklin
[40:38] here and he said if Benjamin Franklin
[40:40] says I got it then he knowed he said if
[40:43] I got it then it's got benefits to go
[40:46] with it. So he know in his mind he
[40:49] wanted to create a light bulb. He he
[40:50] wanted to harness that power that light
[40:53] that was in the skies and bring it down
[40:55] to the common man bring it down into the
[40:57] household. And notice his brain kept
[40:59] working and working and working. He
[41:01] didn't just want the power. He wanted
[41:03] the benefits of the power. And let me
[41:06] tell you, sons and daughters of God,
[41:07] tonight, I don't just want the Holy
[41:09] Ghost. I don't just want the word. I
[41:11] want the power that goes with it. I want
[41:14] everything that's in store with it
[41:16] tonight.
[41:18] Don't just scream out, "I got it. I got
[41:20] it. I got it." And that settles it. I
[41:22] got it plus more. I got it plus the
[41:24] power. I got it plus the rewards. I got
[41:27] it. Plus the benefits.
[41:31] I want the benefits of being a son of
[41:34] God. I want the benefits of being a
[41:35] child of God.
[41:41] Notice he got it. But he says, "If I got
[41:44] it, then it's got benefits."
[41:47] The Bible would tell us, and this is
[41:48] where we're drawing our subtitle
[41:50] tonight, Psalms 103:2, it says, "Bless
[41:52] the
[41:54] Lord, oh my soul,
[41:57] and forget not all of his
[42:02] benefits. Forget not all of his
[42:06] benefits." There's times we're going
[42:08] through a valley, times we're going
[42:09] through a trial, times that maybe the
[42:12] benefits of being a Christian, benefits
[42:13] of being a child of God are not readily
[42:15] available in your mind. But the Bible
[42:17] points us back. Forget not all of his
[42:21] benefits. Then he begins to outline
[42:24] several of these benefits. Who forgiveth
[42:27] all thy iniquities.
[42:29] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Come
[42:31] on, church. Notice who healeth all thy
[42:35] diseases. And the church should be able
[42:37] to rejoice on that there alone. Who
[42:39] redeemth thy life from destruction, who
[42:42] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[42:44] tender mercies. Who satisfy thy mouth
[42:47] with good things.
[42:49] So that thy youth is renewed like
[42:51] eagles. I tell you what, the older I
[42:53] get, the more I want to be renewed like
[42:54] an eagle.
[42:56] Man, I'm ready for a body change. I'm
[42:58] expecting it. the Lord. Notice in verse
[43:00] 6, the Lord execututeth righteousness
[43:02] and judgment for all that are oppressed.
[43:06] And then Psalm 68 and verse 19, blessed
[43:09] be the Lord who daily,
[43:14] Come on, let's Psalm
[43:17] 68:19. Blessed be the Lord who
[43:21] daily for the Lord hadn't done nothing
[43:24] for me. Daily loadeth us with benefits.
[43:28] So, there's benefits to being a
[43:30] Christian. There's benefits to being a
[43:32] believer. There's benefits of the
[43:34] restored power back in the body. There's
[43:36] benefits, church. Right now, you may
[43:38] have not tapped into them, but there are
[43:41] benefits to being a child of
[43:44] God. There's benefits to being a son of
[43:47] God. And I want all that he has for me.
[43:51] In Psalms 42 and verse 7, the Bible
[43:53] says, "There's a deep calleth unto the
[43:55] deep at the noise of thy water spouts.
[43:57] All thy ways and thy billows are gone
[43:59] over me. But there's a deep calling out.
[44:02] And that's why you're even here tonight.
[44:04] There was a deep calling out. You may
[44:06] question, you may ponder, well, what
[44:08] what brought me to church on a Wednesday
[44:10] night? Because there's a deep calling
[44:11] out. And we find that Thomas set us in
[44:13] no doubt. He worked tireless nights,
[44:16] tried 10,000 of wires and he would try
[44:19] one wire and it wouldn't work. And he
[44:20] had just cast it aside. And you know, he
[44:22] didn't get discouraged. Was he defeated?
[44:24] No, he was never defeated. Why? Because
[44:26] there was something on the inside of
[44:28] Thomas Ed and Edison that said that will
[44:31] light
[44:33] church. There's something inside a
[44:35] bornagain believer that says this life
[44:37] is not the only life that we live.
[44:39] There's something on the inside of us
[44:40] calling out for a rapture of the body.
[44:43] There's something calling out for a body
[44:45] change. When sickness overwhelms you,
[44:47] there's something calling out this ain't
[44:49] the final say. This ain't the final
[44:51] result. God has more in his word for me
[44:53] than this. There are benefits to serving
[44:55] God.
[44:57] And there's a deed calling out for
[44:59] healing. There's a deed calling out for
[45:01] deliverance. There's a deed calling out
[45:04] for your sons and your daughters.
[45:08] There's a deed calling
[45:10] out. And there was a deed calling out
[45:12] for
[45:13] electricity. Notice God was about to
[45:15] revolutionize the world with
[45:18] electricity.
[45:21] Something that was harnessed from the
[45:22] sky.
[45:25] What was God doing in this hour, in this
[45:27] age? He was about to revolutionize the
[45:30] church with a power that we hadn't seen
[45:33] since the day of Pentecost.
[45:37] And can I tell you there's benefits
[45:40] to tapping into that power? Oh, they
[45:43] want to claim it may be emotional. I
[45:45] don't doubt that it it causes some
[45:46] emotion, but that's okay. Don't be
[45:49] ashamed of the emotion. That's just a
[45:51] power at work. That's just, let me tell
[45:53] you, if you got a hold of us some raw
[45:55] electricity
[45:57] back here, we have some plugs back here.
[45:59] You don't see nothing going through
[46:00] them. There's nothing plugged into them.
[46:02] You don't see the electricity. You don't
[46:03] feel the electricity. But let me ask
[46:05] you, you if I gave you a fork in in your
[46:08] hand and I said, "Go stick it into that
[46:09] plug." You would feel the power of that
[46:12] plug. Though you can't see it, though
[46:14] you can't explain it, but I tell you,
[46:16] let it get a hold of you one time. And
[46:18] that's what I'm telling you. You get the
[46:19] Holy Ghost get a hold of you one time.
[46:22] The power that's been restored back to
[46:24] the church and you will know that
[46:26] something had got your attention.
[46:30] But there's benefits.
[46:33] There's benefits to having these plugs.
[46:35] There's benefits to having electricity
[46:37] and there's benefits to the Holy Spirit.
[46:41] There's benefits of being a child of
[46:42] God.
[46:44] So there's something on the inside of a
[46:46] born again believer that cries out for a
[46:47] body change.
[46:49] Well, if this is all that we have to
[46:51] look forward to in this world, we're
[46:53] people most miserable.
[46:56] No, but there's something crying out.
[46:57] Even when I was out in the world, there
[46:59] was something crying out, I need to live
[47:01] right. I want to live better than way
[47:02] I'm living. Yeah, even as a ranked
[47:05] sinner out on a drunk or whatever it may
[47:07] may have been that I'd done before I
[47:09] went to bed that night, I'd prayed and
[47:11] I'd ask God to forgive me only to repeat
[47:12] the cycle. Well, you say, "Brother Joe,
[47:14] you shouldn't have done that." You're
[47:15] right. I shouldn't have. But there was a
[47:16] deep longing to be set free from that
[47:19] life. I didn't understand how to fulfill
[47:21] it. I didn't understand how to quench
[47:23] that thirst. But God in his time, God in
[47:26] his season brought the word and my path
[47:29] and my myself, our past cross. And the
[47:31] power that went out before the
[47:33] foundation of the world that said, "Let
[47:35] us make man in our image." That power
[47:37] caught a hold of a son of God. And it
[47:39] changed his life. And I'm here to tell
[47:41] you tonight, you may be drifting on like
[47:43] Solom, but there's a power going out.
[47:46] There's a word that's been spoken and
[47:48] letting it just cross your path one
[47:50] time.
[47:52] Wonderful. Corey Tinboom would tell us
[47:54] because she was a marvelous quoter, a
[47:57] woman who had really lived a Christian
[47:58] life. She said, "If you look at the
[48:00] world, you'll be distressed."
[48:03] And even said, "Amen to
[48:05] that." If you look within, you'll be
[48:08] depressed.
[48:11] Oh yeah. Praise God. We got one. You
[48:14] look at yourself, all your mistakes, all
[48:16] your failures, all your shortcoming.
[48:17] Man, you'll get depressed. How am I ever
[48:19] going to make it?
[48:21] But if you look to God, you'll be at
[48:23] rest.
[48:25] So, I believe it's a great reminder. We
[48:27] started this year off with looking unto
[48:29] Jesus. Being reminded to take your eyes
[48:32] off the world. Take your eyes off your
[48:34] symptoms. Take your eyes off yourself
[48:37] and put your eyes back on Jesus. The
[48:40] Bible says, "Look to Jesus, the author
[48:42] and the finisher of our faith."
[48:45] See, in the Old Testament when they were
[48:47] bit in the desert there, they had to
[48:48] look to a brazen serpent and they were
[48:50] healed. That brazen serpent represented
[48:52] sin already judged. But in the New
[48:54] Testament, now the antitype became the
[48:57] type. And not only we're look to the
[48:59] serpent, but we're now we're look to
[49:00] Jesus Christ, the redeemer, the the
[49:03] perpetuation for all of our sins. And
[49:05] that's the only way that we live.
[49:09] She would tell us also, Corey would tell
[49:11] us, "How many of you've ever worried
[49:13] about something?
[49:16] Maybe just half of y'all worry."
[49:19] Thank you, brother Al. Everybody.
[49:23] We've, you know, you've been at night
[49:24] about 12, 1:00 in the morning, ftting,
[49:27] rolling your thumbs, mind
[49:29] racing,
[49:31] sweating. Am I just speaking about the
[49:33] Adam's householders?
[49:36] And you just you're worrying about this
[49:37] trying to figure it all out. How I'm
[49:38] going to make this change? How am I
[49:39] going to do this? What am I going to do
[49:41] in this situation? What's going to be my
[49:42] response? Sometimes we already build a
[49:44] bridge before we even get there.
[49:47] But Corey to Boon would tell us worrying
[49:49] is carrying tomorrow's load with today's
[49:53] strength. Carrying two days at once.
[49:56] It's moving into tomorrow ahead of time.
[49:59] Worrying doesn't empty tomorrow of its
[50:02] sorrow. It empties today of its
[50:04] strength.
[50:06] It empties today of its strength. And
[50:10] the Bible would tell us in Matthew 6 and
[50:12] verse 25, "Therefore I say unto you,
[50:15] take no thought for your life what you
[50:17] shall eat, what you shall drink, nor yet
[50:20] for your body what you shall put on. Is
[50:22] not the life more than meat and the body
[50:24] than raignment?" And then verse 31,
[50:27] therefore take no thought, saying, "What
[50:30] shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or
[50:32] wheither all shall we be clothed? For
[50:34] all, for after all these things do the
[50:36] Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father
[50:38] knoweth that you have need of these
[50:41] things." And he says in verse 33, "Seek
[50:44] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[50:46] righteousness, and all these things will
[50:48] be added unto you." Amen. And in verse
[50:51] 34, take therefore no thought for
[50:54] tomorrow, for the tomorrow shall take
[50:56] thought of itself, sufficient unto the
[50:58] day is the evil thereof.
[51:02] So that we're not to worry about life.
[51:08] Not to worry about life. Well, Brother
[51:12] Joe, that's easier said than done. Well,
[51:15] the Bible says if you're if you're
[51:17] standing on the word of God,
[51:21] It was quoted that they asked I don't
[51:23] know if it was oh Mo why you carrying
[51:26] that Bible around you can't read. He
[51:27] said because I believe it. I believe it
[51:30] from kiver to kiver and I believe the
[51:32] kiver too. He says I'd rather be
[51:34] standing on the Bible than standing in
[51:37] heaven. He like that's a big step. He
[51:41] said Moses why you say it like that? He
[51:43] said because heavens and earth will pass
[51:45] away but God's word will never pass
[51:48] away. Let me tell you, there are
[51:50] benefits when standing on the word of
[51:52] God. You can't count on your neighbor.
[51:55] You can't count on your job. You can't
[51:57] count on your friends. You can't count
[51:59] on your health. But what you can count
[52:01] on is the word of God. And he says,
[52:03] "I'll never leave you. I'll never
[52:05] forsake you, but I will be in you even
[52:09] to the end of the age." That's a
[52:12] benefit, a benefit of being a child of
[52:15] God. that the King of Kings and the
[52:17] creator of heavens and earth will never
[52:19] leave you in your moments of distress,
[52:23] standing on the word of God.
[52:26] And the Bible says, having done all the
[52:29] stand, stand
[52:32] therefore, think about that. When a
[52:35] train goes through a
[52:36] tunnel, how many have ever ridden on a
[52:39] train? Okay, good. When a train goes
[52:41] through a tunnel and it gets dark, you
[52:45] don't throw the ticket away and jump off
[52:48] the train, do
[52:50] you? Do you? No. You sit back and you
[52:54] trust the engineer.
[52:58] Look, church, the life that we live will
[53:00] take you through a lot of dark tunnels.
[53:03] The life that you live will take you
[53:04] through a lot of deep valleys. The life
[53:07] that we live as a believer take you
[53:08] through a lot of steep mountains. And
[53:10] you wonder, will I ever get there? You
[53:13] be like that little train. I think I
[53:14] can. I think I
[53:17] can. And you you stress and you sweat
[53:22] and you toil and you pray and you
[53:25] believe and you do it all over again the
[53:27] next day and you keep trying and you
[53:29] keep trying and you keep trying. But the
[53:33] thing is to remember, you got a ticket
[53:35] in your hand.
[53:38] The price has been paid.
[53:42] The token is in your hand. When it gets
[53:45] dark, don't throw the Don't throw the
[53:47] ticket down. Don't jump off the train.
[53:49] That's the time to sit back and relax.
[53:53] And trust the engineer.
[53:56] Trust the one who who's driving that
[53:59] train. So, there's going to be a lot of
[54:01] lot of dark tunnels that we face, a lot
[54:03] of difficult trials, even sickness in
[54:06] our bodies that may have you question
[54:10] why, why me? Why
[54:14] now? What did I do? Has anybody ever
[54:17] asked this? What did I do to deserve
[54:22] this? That's our human mindset, right?
[54:27] But we find here when Job went through
[54:30] his greatest
[54:32] trial, if you look at the scriptures,
[54:34] Job didn't do anything that merited to
[54:37] being thrust into a trial. Am I right?
[54:41] But the Bible says that God had a
[54:44] conversation with his arch enemy, the
[54:46] devil, and he asked him a question. Have
[54:49] you considered my servant Job? You know,
[54:53] I like the way God stakes a claim on
[54:55] Job's life. He didn't just say, "Have
[54:57] you considered Job?" or "Have you
[54:59] considered Mike Wear?" or "Have you
[55:01] considered Tim Puit?" or "Have you
[55:03] considered Timothy or Timothy Puit or
[55:05] Aaron Oglesby or any of these great men?
[55:07] Ron Spencer, but have you considered my
[55:10] servant Job?" So God was staking a claim
[55:15] that the Job didn't belong to the devil.
[55:17] Job didn't belong to the trial. Job
[55:19] didn't belong to the sickness. Joe
[55:21] belonged to God. And what am I telling
[55:24] you tonight? I'm telling you, you don't
[55:26] belong to sickness. You don't belong to
[55:28] that trial. You don't belong to that
[55:30] depression. You don't belong to that
[55:32] anxiety. You belong to
[55:35] God. And God stakes a claim on you. And
[55:39] God had confidence that Job will keep
[55:42] his word. And God has confidence in you
[55:44] tonight that you will keep his word.
[55:52] In the exposition of the church ages,
[55:54] the prophet would tell us redeem means
[55:56] to buy back. It means to restore to the
[55:58] original owner. God by his death of shed
[56:00] blood bought back his own.
[56:06] He bought back the spoken word seed
[56:09] bride.
[56:11] My sheep hear my voice, the word, and
[56:13] they follow me. Notice you always were a
[56:16] sheep.
[56:17] Come on, church.
[56:20] You may have felt like a pig. You may
[56:21] have felt like a dog. You may have felt
[56:23] like a scoundrel. You may have felt like
[56:24] a thug. You may have felt like all these
[56:26] things. But you always was a sheep. He
[56:30] said, "You were never a pig or a dog
[56:32] turned into a sheep. That's impossible.
[56:35] For every kind of life produces the same
[56:37] kind, and there is no change in
[56:39] species." And if we were in the thoughts
[56:42] of God, then expressed in this flesh,
[56:44] then there had to come a day when we
[56:46] would hear the voice to work. And
[56:48] hearing that voice became aware that it
[56:50] was our father calling us and recognize
[56:52] that we are sons of God.
[56:56] Oh, hallelujah. Let me tell you, some of
[56:59] us were going the wrong way. Some of us
[57:01] was headed to a devil's hell. But one
[57:03] day, we heard the voice of God and it
[57:06] turned us around. And now we begin to
[57:09] realize we are sons of God. We are
[57:12] daughters of God. We are children of
[57:14] God. And we have benefits of the father.
[57:20] Hallelujah. When you were born of the
[57:22] spirit of
[57:24] God, he says then you got then you're a
[57:27] son of God and you always was a son of
[57:30] God. Let that
[57:32] resonate. I'm gonna leave that there for
[57:34] just a minute. You
[57:36] always was a son of
[57:41] God. Always.
[57:44] Not when you came to the altar, not when
[57:46] you went to the meeting, not when you
[57:49] went to a camp, but you always was a son
[57:54] of God.
[57:56] Well, Brother Joe, I would I didn't grow
[57:58] up in church. It don't really matter. I
[58:01] didn't either. But I stand before you
[58:03] now as a son of God. 20some years of my
[58:06] life, I wasted. But I stand before you
[58:08] now. Why? Because I always was a son of
[58:12] God. Because what God did, God deposited
[58:15] a seed gene on the inside of you before
[58:17] the foundation of the world. You were in
[58:19] the very thoughts and mind of God. And
[58:22] the thoughts of God are eternal.
[58:25] Therefore, there was going to be a day
[58:27] that you would hear the word and you
[58:30] would come to recognition that I don't
[58:32] belong in this chicken yard. I don't
[58:34] belong down here in the bars. I don't
[58:36] belong on those websites. I don't belong
[58:38] in that kind of lifestyle. I don't
[58:40] belong in drugs and alcohol. I belong in
[58:43] the heavenlies flying with dust, sayeth
[58:45] the Lord. I am a child of God. And I got
[58:48] benefits of being a child.
[58:52] Notice what he says. No way to separate
[58:54] it because see, you have eternal life
[58:57] and eternal never did begin and eternal
[59:00] never will end.
[59:04] Hallelujah.
[59:06] So, let me just say it like this. When
[59:07] this earth is burned over, because the
[59:10] Bible speaks about this earth being
[59:12] burned over. When this earth is burned
[59:15] over and the adversary is thrown into
[59:17] the lake of fire, guess who will be?
[59:22] Oh, I figure you get a better amen than
[59:24] that.
[59:25] when all that you have been through, all
[59:29] the heartache, all the sickness, all the
[59:31] trials, all the worry, all the darkness,
[59:35] when it's all said and done and it's all
[59:38] washed away and we're sitting in
[59:40] heavenly places and we watch as the
[59:44] adversary is thrown into the lake of
[59:46] fire, we will still be
[59:52] not the last day for my not The last day
[59:55] for Philip Ronolie, but the last day for
[59:58] sickness, the last day for depression,
[1:00:01] the last day for anxiety, the last day
[1:00:04] for for bitterness and worry and all the
[1:00:07] last days for everything but us. It's a
[1:00:10] benefit.
[1:00:12] To live eternally, I know we can't wrap
[1:00:15] our minds around what does it mean to
[1:00:16] live eternally because we got these
[1:00:18] finite human minds and some of your
[1:00:20] minds are more messed up than mine.
[1:00:27] Woo! We're in a bad shape,
[1:00:30] church. But you know, I mean, the
[1:00:32] battles that we face, family strengths,
[1:00:34] things, our makeup, our personalities,
[1:00:36] all that. But every one of those, God
[1:00:38] put it there to give a unique sound,
[1:00:43] a certain
[1:00:44] team. See, we need you in Evening Light
[1:00:47] Tabernac because you give us
[1:00:48] certainting. Some of you teaming too
[1:00:51] often, but that's okay. At least you're
[1:00:53] tinging.
[1:00:55] Some of us tongue when we need to team.
[1:00:58] But see, God put it all together to make
[1:01:00] up the body. And there's benefits. We're
[1:01:03] going to get into some more of these. I
[1:01:05] got to speed up here. But notice, you
[1:01:08] always
[1:01:09] was a son of God. So no matter what
[1:01:13] you're going through, young person, no
[1:01:15] matter what you're facing, you always
[1:01:18] was a son of God. And if you always was,
[1:01:21] you always will be.
[1:01:25] Not when your favorite preacher comes,
[1:01:27] not when you feel the aoria of a special
[1:01:30] meeting like we just did this past
[1:01:32] weekend, but you always were and you
[1:01:36] always will be. See, the word is
[1:01:39] eternal. And if God made a promise
[1:01:40] that's eternal, then there's nothing
[1:01:42] nowhere can stop it.
[1:01:46] There's nothing nowhere can stop it.
[1:01:47] They couldn't. He can turn every atom
[1:01:49] upside down, turn it backwards. You can
[1:01:51] never pierce the word of God. Not one
[1:01:52] little word. Jesus said, "Heavens and
[1:01:54] earth will pass away, but my word will
[1:01:57] never pass away."
[1:02:00] So what is the word? Now listen to this.
[1:02:02] This is conflict conflict between God
[1:02:04] and Satan. I was listening to this
[1:02:06] earlier today. See the word, what is the
[1:02:08] word of God? The word of God is God
[1:02:10] himself.
[1:02:13] Now, we're talking about power being
[1:02:15] restored to the church. And I understand
[1:02:17] that in the day and age in which we're
[1:02:19] living in, many want to proclaim that
[1:02:20] the days of miracles have passed. God
[1:02:22] don't do these things anymore. That was
[1:02:24] for yesterday, the 40, 50, 60s during
[1:02:26] the healing revival, different things of
[1:02:27] that nature. You know, great men who's
[1:02:29] gone down through the ages. You know,
[1:02:31] they were okay to have their revival,
[1:02:33] but they refused to let us have
[1:02:35] ours. But I want you to hear this quote
[1:02:37] here and listen what he says. What is
[1:02:39] the word of God? The word of God is God
[1:02:41] himself. So God gave the believer
[1:02:43] himself.
[1:02:45] Notice God gave the believer himself.
[1:02:50] He didn't give you a substitute. He
[1:02:53] didn't give you a carbon copy. God gave
[1:02:55] the believer himself. And what is it?
[1:02:58] It's God himself. He gave the believer
[1:03:01] himself to attack the enemy by. In other
[1:03:04] words, he's the father and the word is
[1:03:06] God and then the word is our father.
[1:03:07] We're born by the word. He's standing in
[1:03:10] the forefront of his children. Notice
[1:03:12] now there you are. He's standing out
[1:03:15] there for his children. What are we
[1:03:17] scared
[1:03:18] about? God gave himself. And if there
[1:03:22] was power in Jesus, then there's got to
[1:03:24] be power in the church.
[1:03:26] If there was power to open blinded eyes
[1:03:29] and heal the leper and raise the
[1:03:31] in the days of Jesus and God gave
[1:03:34] himself to the church, then there's got
[1:03:36] to be power once again in the church.
[1:03:41] And he tells us, Jesus own word tells us
[1:03:43] the very works that I do, you shall do
[1:03:46] also.
[1:03:48] Church, you don't have to knuck down to
[1:03:50] the devil. You don't have to knuck down
[1:03:52] to the critics and the naysayers that
[1:03:54] says all this all about emotion and all
[1:03:56] this. If they want their intellectual uh
[1:03:58] theology, let them have their
[1:03:59] intellectualism. I want the power. I
[1:04:02] want the benefits of the power.
[1:04:08] I want the power to live an overcoming
[1:04:09] life. I want the benefits of what an
[1:04:12] overcoming life means. My kids are my
[1:04:15] kids. That's one benefit. I ain't
[1:04:18] worried about who's been at the house,
[1:04:19] the male man, the male lady, or whoever
[1:04:22] else. Talking about power to know in
[1:04:25] this hour, in this day and age, that a
[1:04:27] wife could be loyal and faithful to a
[1:04:29] husband and a husk, a husband can be
[1:04:31] loyal and faithful to her spouse.
[1:04:36] The power to live above sin, to live
[1:04:39] above drugs and
[1:04:41] alcohol. The power to change a life. The
[1:04:44] power to take an atheist and make a
[1:04:46] Sunday school teacher out of her.
[1:04:49] The power to take a criminal, Grant
[1:04:52] Larson, and make a trustee out of him.
[1:04:56] You want to talk about power in the
[1:04:58] church? I'm telling you that power is in
[1:05:01] this church right here tonight.
[1:05:04] Some of you were going the wrong
[1:05:05] direction. Brother Johnny, I remember
[1:05:08] your testimony. He out of a dumpster.
[1:05:14] Brother Johnny, not brother
[1:05:17] L. Maybe he needs to give you his
[1:05:19] testimony
[1:05:20] someday. But the power to transform a
[1:05:24] life.
[1:05:25] We're not dumpster diving today. We're
[1:05:27] feeding on the body word of the Son of
[1:05:29] Man. for feeding on the word of God made
[1:05:33] real in this hour. And there's benefits
[1:05:36] that it produces, church
[1:05:39] benefits. When you come into a prayer
[1:05:40] line, you don't have to guess. You don't
[1:05:43] have to hope so. You don't have to maybe
[1:05:46] benefits of seeing a young boy who's
[1:05:48] never walked, never crawled. When a
[1:05:50] grandmother begin to lift her arms and
[1:05:52] praise not her calamity, but begin to
[1:05:54] praise the Lord through her calamity.
[1:05:56] And a young boy who's never walked got
[1:05:58] up and began to run around the house.
[1:05:59] That's a benefit of serving God. That's
[1:06:02] a benefit of a family life, a family
[1:06:05] legacy lived out. Because we know what,
[1:06:07] just the same way we see brother Ron
[1:06:08] there fighting stage four cancer or
[1:06:11] whatever it may be for five years now.
[1:06:12] The doctors gave him four months and
[1:06:14] he's still standing, still preaching,
[1:06:16] still displaying what a Christian life
[1:06:18] is. And though maybe five minutes ago,
[1:06:20] he was back in the back throwing up, but
[1:06:22] he stands there as a soldier of the
[1:06:24] cross. what benefits of serving the
[1:06:26] Lord. And now his sons and his daughters
[1:06:29] and his grandchildren, they're all
[1:06:30] serving God.
[1:06:33] I'm telling you, it's benefits of
[1:06:34] raising your children in the fear and
[1:06:36] the admonition of God.
[1:06:39] So God has confidence in you. The Bible
[1:06:43] will tell us in Psalms 30 and verse 5
[1:06:46] that weeping may endure for the
[1:06:49] night, but joy cometh in the morning.
[1:06:53] There's a lot of tears that are
[1:06:55] shed. There's a lot of times that you're
[1:06:57] you're up late and you're praying for
[1:06:59] your children. You that have children,
[1:07:02] you're praying that they find their
[1:07:03] place in life, not the world life, but
[1:07:06] this life, that they get filled with the
[1:07:08] Holy Spirit, they find the right mate,
[1:07:10] they they live in the right place, they
[1:07:12] go to the right church, that their lives
[1:07:14] make a difference.
[1:07:16] And there's a lot of tears that are
[1:07:18] shed, a lot of weeping, but the Bible
[1:07:20] says,
[1:07:21] "Joy cometh in the morning."
[1:07:26] Joy cometh in the morning. And the Bible
[1:07:27] tells us in Philippians 4 and verse 6,
[1:07:29] "Be careful for nothing, but in
[1:07:31] everything by prayer, supplication, and
[1:07:33] thanksgiving. Let your requests be made
[1:07:35] known unto God. And the peace of God
[1:07:37] which passes all understanding shall
[1:07:40] keep your hearts and your minds through
[1:07:42] Christ Jesus." And in first Peter 5:7,
[1:07:45] casting all of your cares upon him, for
[1:07:48] he carth for you.
[1:07:51] You realize God will put somebody in a
[1:07:54] certain place and have somebody else in
[1:07:57] the same place in an unexpected time, in
[1:08:01] an unexpected way so he can work a
[1:08:03] miracle.
[1:08:07] See, there's power in being positionally
[1:08:10] placed where God wants you. That's a
[1:08:13] whole another sermon that I've been
[1:08:14] preparing.
[1:08:16] And I just kind of think that God has
[1:08:17] placed me where he's placed
[1:08:19] me for a special person
[1:08:23] because I believe God's going to do the
[1:08:25] supernatural
[1:08:27] because God is supernatural.
[1:08:30] And why shouldn't we expect the benefits
[1:08:32] of serving a supernatural God?
[1:08:35] So we understand many time God will
[1:08:38] allow
[1:08:39] us God will allow us to get in
[1:08:44] places where we question
[1:08:48] maybe maybe question who we
[1:08:51] are know those times that you get to
[1:08:53] that place you got to be certain of God.
[1:08:58] Cory Tinboom would tell it like this and
[1:09:00] I thought this was a amazing quote that
[1:09:02] she quoted. She goes, "In order to
[1:09:03] realize the worth of the
[1:09:06] anchor, you need to feel the stress of
[1:09:08] the
[1:09:09] storm." And I put it I kind of twisted
[1:09:12] it up and put it in Joe Adams language.
[1:09:14] You'll never know the strength of the
[1:09:17] anchor until you felt the power of the
[1:09:21] storm. Sometimes we wonder what's
[1:09:24] holding us. Why am I here? I'm holding
[1:09:26] on. I'm holding on. It's not you holding
[1:09:27] on. It's that anchor that's holding you.
[1:09:31] And you'll never know the worth or the
[1:09:34] power or the strength of that anchor
[1:09:36] until you felt the strength of the
[1:09:38] storm.
[1:09:39] And the the greater the storm, the
[1:09:43] greater the anchor.
[1:09:46] The greater the storm, the greater the
[1:09:48] anchor.
[1:09:52] So, if you know about Corey Timboom's
[1:09:53] life, she was captured by the Nazis and
[1:09:55] thrown into a concentration camp and she
[1:09:58] was put in solitary confinement for, I
[1:09:59] believe, 3 to six months because she was
[1:10:01] sick at the time. And while she was in
[1:10:03] this solitary confinement, she had one
[1:10:05] little window that sunlight came in, but
[1:10:07] she had a little friend. It was a little
[1:10:08] mouse that came out and it came and it
[1:10:10] played with her, if you want to call it
[1:10:12] that, playing. And she would feed it
[1:10:13] crumbs. And she would quote this quote.
[1:10:15] She says, "You will never know that
[1:10:17] Christ is all you need until Christ is
[1:10:20] all you have."
[1:10:23] You will never know that Christ is all
[1:10:27] you need until Christ is all you
[1:10:32] have. When family's forsaken you, when
[1:10:35] friends have forsaken you, when churches
[1:10:37] have turned their back on you, Christ is
[1:10:40] all you need.
[1:10:43] And you realize that when he's all you
[1:10:46] have.
[1:10:47] And there's going to be a point in some
[1:10:50] parts of our lives that we will get to
[1:10:51] that place to where we recognize that he
[1:10:54] is all we need.
[1:10:57] Because your
[1:10:58] relationship is not you and the pastor,
[1:11:01] though we have a great pastor. Your
[1:11:03] relationship is not you and one of us
[1:11:05] other preachers, though I believe we're
[1:11:07] great preachers and we're very equipped
[1:11:10] sons of God to deliver the word, but
[1:11:13] your relationship is based on Christ and
[1:11:16] Christ alone.
[1:11:18] And you'll never know that he's all you
[1:11:20] need until everything around you is
[1:11:22] stripped from you and he's all that you
[1:11:24] have. But I believe God allows us to get
[1:11:27] to that place so you can see there's
[1:11:30] benefits to serving him. Sister Jenny,
[1:11:33] there's
[1:11:34] benefits to remaining faithful in the
[1:11:38] face of
[1:11:39] adversity, of sickness and trial and day
[1:11:42] in and day out grind and grind and grind
[1:11:45] to remain a faithful wife, a faithful
[1:11:48] spouse. Stand faithfully by your husband
[1:11:51] who's ravished in pain day in and day
[1:11:53] out.
[1:11:54] There's a benefit because this life is
[1:11:56] not an eternal life. But this life, this
[1:12:00] body is decaying each and every day and
[1:12:03] it will be changed.
[1:12:07] That's a benefit of the power that's
[1:12:09] been restored back to the church. That's
[1:12:11] right. So, let's go on just a little bit
[1:12:13] further here.
[1:12:17] We find that in the days of Jesus that
[1:12:19] the church there the Jewish church the
[1:12:21] prophet would tell us that they had
[1:12:22] their seven church ages like we have our
[1:12:24] seven church ages and at the end of the
[1:12:26] seven church ages for them they were
[1:12:28] expecting Joel's prophecy to come to
[1:12:30] fruition and there it came to fruition
[1:12:32] on the day of Pentecost and when Peter
[1:12:34] and the 120 came out of the upper room
[1:12:36] they were the excuse me they were the
[1:12:38] very manifestation of Joel
[1:12:41] 2:28 you know before then during that
[1:12:44] time they had the word they had the law
[1:12:46] they had the prophets, but they had no
[1:12:48] power because their intellectual ideas
[1:12:51] choked the power from the church. They
[1:12:53] could take a pen and they can push it
[1:12:55] through the scroll and they can tell you
[1:12:56] every letter that it hit, but they did
[1:12:58] not possess the power to make that word
[1:13:01] live. And I'm afraid today that many
[1:13:06] have taken the quotes, they taken the
[1:13:07] scriptures, they taken it all, and it's
[1:13:09] nothing more than just theology,
[1:13:12] intellectualism. But there's got to be a
[1:13:15] people that wants the benefits of the
[1:13:18] word,
[1:13:20] benefits of the promises that lay in the
[1:13:24] word. You recognize there's over 800
[1:13:26] promises that lays in the Bible for you
[1:13:28] as a child of
[1:13:30] God. Why just put the promises on the
[1:13:33] shelf and say, "Well, I got it." And
[1:13:35] then it never comes to
[1:13:37] manifestation. But we're sons of God.
[1:13:40] We're daughters of God. My children have
[1:13:42] access to their father and they have
[1:13:45] access to their father's bank account
[1:13:48] not
[1:13:50] directly mind
[1:13:52] you my wife now that's another story she
[1:13:56] has access directly but what am I
[1:13:58] telling you is when there is a need in
[1:14:00] my children and they come and they
[1:14:02] approach me
[1:14:04] correctly they don't demand payment or
[1:14:08] they don't demand this but they ask
[1:14:10] father you know I'm in need. I'm falling
[1:14:13] on some hard
[1:14:14] times. Can I please borrow? You know
[1:14:17] that I like to say that borrow word with
[1:14:19] the intention of never paying it back.
[1:14:22] Yeah, you little
[1:14:27] thief. But they have the benefits of
[1:14:30] coming knowing
[1:14:31] that there's money in the father's bank.
[1:14:35] And church, we have a father that owns a
[1:14:36] cattle on a thousand heels. What am I
[1:14:39] telling you? There's benefits of
[1:14:41] accessing the father, coming to him and
[1:14:45] saying, "I have a need, Zach. I got a
[1:14:48] need of healing. I got a need of
[1:14:50] deliverance. I got a need of a life to
[1:14:52] live above suicide and above depression
[1:14:55] and above anxiety and above rebellion
[1:14:57] and above all this stuff. I want to live
[1:15:00] separated from the world. Father, I'm
[1:15:02] approaching you tonight as your child. I
[1:15:05] want the benefits of being a son of God.
[1:15:09] I want the benefits bestow upon me the
[1:15:11] benefits of being a child of God of
[1:15:14] being an
[1:15:16] Adams and every child here should should
[1:15:20] take that and said it is a pleasure and
[1:15:22] an honor to approach their father in a
[1:15:26] way that the Bible says that he will
[1:15:28] withhold no good thing to them that walk
[1:15:30] uprightly.
[1:15:33] What a benefit. That's right. Some of
[1:15:36] you may be here tonight in need of
[1:15:37] healing. There's a benefit. By my
[1:15:40] stripes, you are already healed
[1:15:46] already.
[1:15:47] If Jesus was standing in this suit and
[1:15:50] this tie and this shirt today, he
[1:15:52] couldn't do one more thing for you than
[1:15:54] what he's already done. It's finished.
[1:15:58] On Calvary, when he hung his hands out
[1:16:00] and opened his arms and his hands were
[1:16:02] pierced, his feet were pierced, his side
[1:16:03] were pierced, and he began to scream
[1:16:05] out, "It is finished. everything
[1:16:08] complete redemption and all that
[1:16:09] redemption had of all the benefits that
[1:16:13] you would need, he finished it there and
[1:16:15] then
[1:16:17] all that you have to do is access the
[1:16:19] father. Amen. But you have to do it
[1:16:21] recognizing I'm a child of God.
[1:16:24] Let's go on. See, God is not going to
[1:16:27] allow his word to fall to the ground. He
[1:16:30] didn't just want one manifesting the
[1:16:33] power all encapsulated in Jesus Christ.
[1:16:35] But he had in his mind, let us make man
[1:16:38] in our image. God wanted a family. God
[1:16:40] wanted sons of God. And and yet he he
[1:16:43] sent Jesus to pay the price so that that
[1:16:46] fallen man would now be able to come
[1:16:48] back into a position of sunship. And the
[1:16:51] same power, the same life that was
[1:16:54] bestowed upon Jesus, though it was
[1:16:55] without measure is now in sons and
[1:16:59] daughters of God with
[1:17:01] measure. But the you can go to the ocean
[1:17:04] and you can take one teaspoon out of
[1:17:06] that ocean and every molecule, every
[1:17:08] substance that's in the great Pacific
[1:17:10] Ocean is is in that little teeny
[1:17:13] teaspoon. Everything is in it even
[1:17:16] though it's in a smaller measure. What
[1:17:17] am I telling you? You possess the same
[1:17:20] power.
[1:17:22] It's been restored back to the church.
[1:17:25] Quit living below your God-given
[1:17:28] privileges.
[1:17:32] Now notice, let's get back to our story.
[1:17:35] Peter and John approaching this lame man
[1:17:37] crippled from from his mother's womb.
[1:17:39] And he's sitting there and he's out
[1:17:40] begging. You know, he's been carried to
[1:17:43] this spot daily.
[1:17:46] Every Wednesday he comes and he sits in
[1:17:49] the same
[1:17:50] spot. Every Sunday he comes and he sits
[1:17:54] in the same
[1:17:56] seat. How dare you sit in my
[1:18:00] seat? Get out. Don't you know this is my
[1:18:04] spot? He was carried
[1:18:09] daily. But there was a day that was
[1:18:11] going to be different.
[1:18:14] See, because Jesus has heard every
[1:18:16] prayer that he prayed.
[1:18:20] He had heard every prayer. He had felt
[1:18:23] every wse of pain that shot through his
[1:18:27] body. He
[1:18:29] knew that that crippled man desired to
[1:18:33] be healed.
[1:18:35] And though Jesus could not get to him
[1:18:37] while he was in his fleshly form, that
[1:18:41] same power that resonated and lived and
[1:18:43] manifested in Christ will now begin to
[1:18:46] live out through his disciples and
[1:18:47] through the 120 in the multiplication of
[1:18:50] different ones as they believed on the
[1:18:52] word and believed on Christ. So now we
[1:18:54] find here this crippled man here he's at
[1:18:57] the he's at the gate and the gate called
[1:18:59] beautiful and Peter and John come and no
[1:19:02] doubt Peter says such as I have I give
[1:19:04] you and and maybe he stopped for a
[1:19:06] minute and said come on Peter you don't
[1:19:09] understand my case is
[1:19:12] different how many times have we told
[1:19:15] God that our case is different
[1:19:19] you don't understand it I've been like
[1:19:22] this for 40 years you don't think I've
[1:19:24] tried to get medical help. You don't
[1:19:26] think I went to Willis Night and don't
[1:19:27] go to Mind Medical
[1:19:29] Center. Just
[1:19:32] kidding. Little pun on hospitals there.
[1:19:35] Go to Ashner. You don't think he's tried
[1:19:37] to get the best help that he could get.
[1:19:40] Peter, you don't understand my
[1:19:42] case. Let me just say it like this. Per
[1:19:45] adventure. Per adventure. If your
[1:19:48] situation and your case was unlike any
[1:19:50] that anybody has ever heard of before in
[1:19:54] life, Jesus Christ is the same
[1:19:57] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:20:01] He remains the same. If he
[1:20:05] healed in that day, then he has to heal
[1:20:09] every man according to their faith or he
[1:20:12] would not be just in his healing. The
[1:20:16] first one
[1:20:18] So there was a young girl where many of
[1:20:19] you may know her. She had uh some form
[1:20:22] of
[1:20:23] leukemia. Never before has it ever been
[1:20:26] recorded has anybody had ever recovered
[1:20:29] from this kind of leukemia. And I can't
[1:20:30] remember the name of it but her her she
[1:20:33] goes there to brother Tom Ray's church
[1:20:35] or was it brother Tom Ray's church as a
[1:20:37] little kid and she was the only one
[1:20:40] recorded in history that was ever that
[1:20:42] ever recovered from this form of
[1:20:44] leukemia. and they had to go back and
[1:20:47] rewrite the books.
[1:20:49] That's a benefit of serving God. Because
[1:20:53] when the doctors say you can't be
[1:20:54] healed, when the priest and the
[1:20:56] preachers say the days of miracles has
[1:20:57] passed, God honors your faith. Not their
[1:21:00] doubt, not their unbelief, but he honors
[1:21:02] your faith to believe that he is in fact
[1:21:05] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:21:09] If he healed yesterday by faith, he'll
[1:21:11] heal today by faith. If he delivered
[1:21:13] yesterday by faith, he'll deliver today
[1:21:15] by faith. If he filled with the Holy
[1:21:17] Ghost yesterday by faith, he will fill
[1:21:19] with the Holy Ghost today by faith. But
[1:21:24] notice, it's when you're ready to make a
[1:21:29] decision. See, you got to make a
[1:21:31] decision. Yes, I'm going to believe him
[1:21:33] for my
[1:21:34] healing. And you and that has to settle
[1:21:36] it. Or you're going to have to believe
[1:21:38] him for my deliverance. or per
[1:21:40] adventure. You got to believe him for my
[1:21:43] children. See, you got to believe that
[1:21:46] he is. See, this crippled man believed.
[1:21:48] He had to he had to make a decision. Was
[1:21:51] Peter telling me the truth? He had
[1:21:53] walked with Jesus. He had fished with
[1:21:55] Jesus. He had lived with Jesus for three
[1:21:57] years. He had spent time day and night
[1:21:59] with Jesus Christ. And I couldn't get to
[1:22:01] Jesus, but I know he has been with him.
[1:22:03] Is he telling me the truth? So, he had
[1:22:06] to make a decision. And notice what he
[1:22:08] did. The Bible says that he immediately
[1:22:10] leaped up.
[1:22:13] Peter didn't have an all night prayer
[1:22:14] meeting. Peter didn't get the church to
[1:22:16] gather together and lay hands on him.
[1:22:18] Peter just spoke the word of truth to
[1:22:21] him. And that's what we do. We preach
[1:22:24] the truth. We preach faith to you so you
[1:22:26] can leap up out of that crippled
[1:22:28] condition. Whether it be lameness in
[1:22:30] your body, may it be crippled in your
[1:22:32] mind, may it be crippled in your spirit,
[1:22:34] whatever it may be, it's so you can leap
[1:22:36] up.
[1:22:39] walking and leaping and praising God.
[1:22:41] But when you're ready, when you're
[1:22:43] ready, God will take that crippled
[1:22:45] spirit off of you. When you're ready,
[1:22:48] young boys, young girls, he'll take that
[1:22:52] that spirit to look at these dirty
[1:22:54] websites. He'll take that out of your
[1:22:55] heart when you're ready. That's right.
[1:22:59] When you're ready to give up depression
[1:23:01] and fear and quit petting those little
[1:23:02] petty things. When you're ready, he'll
[1:23:04] take it from you. When you're ready,
[1:23:07] he'll take that thirst for the things of
[1:23:08] the world, for drinking and smoking and
[1:23:10] all that sex sins. He'll take all that
[1:23:12] out of your heart and give you a thirst
[1:23:14] for the word of God. When you're ready,
[1:23:17] see, he's a gentleman. He's not going to
[1:23:19] force anything on you. But when you're
[1:23:21] ready, when you would rather die than do
[1:23:24] that again, that's
[1:23:26] when he's going to be there to lift you
[1:23:28] up out of that crippled
[1:23:31] condition. But you got to make a
[1:23:33] decision. The Bible says, "If you have
[1:23:35] faith as a grain of a mustard seed, you
[1:23:36] shall say unto this mountain, remove
[1:23:38] hence to a yonder place, and it shall
[1:23:40] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[1:23:42] unto you." Why a mustard seed? Little
[1:23:45] bitty mustard seed. You can't even see
[1:23:47] it because it will grow into a great big
[1:23:50] tree and the fowls of the air will come
[1:23:53] and they will roost in it and take cover
[1:23:55] and take rest in that. And when a farmer
[1:23:59] when a farmer gets in his mind that he
[1:24:02] wants to have a crop, he takes a seed
[1:24:04] and he plants that seed in the ground.
[1:24:06] He's not digging that seed up each and
[1:24:08] every day hoping that it's going to
[1:24:11] manifest. No. When a farmer gets in his
[1:24:14] mind and in his heart that he's going to
[1:24:16] have a crop and he's going to have a a
[1:24:17] seed or or bring forth a harvest and he
[1:24:20] goes and he gets exactly what seed he's
[1:24:23] looking for. if it's faith, if it's
[1:24:25] healing, if it's deliverance. Notice,
[1:24:26] he's gathering exactly what he has need
[1:24:29] of. And he plants it into the ground.
[1:24:31] And he's not every day going back, hoing
[1:24:33] it back over, checking it. Only thing
[1:24:35] that he's responsible to do is keep the
[1:24:38] weeds away. Plant that seed in faith,
[1:24:41] water with thanksgiving, and expect the
[1:24:43] harvest.
[1:24:47] That's real simple. Plant it by faith.
[1:24:53] Water it with thanksgiving
[1:24:56] and expect a harvest.
[1:25:03] And the Bible would tell us they that
[1:25:06] sew tears shall reap in joy.
[1:25:09] Sewing sometimes planting the ground,
[1:25:11] the seed in the ground, breaking that
[1:25:14] that fow ground is not easy at times. It
[1:25:17] can be very difficult,
[1:25:19] especially when you have children that
[1:25:21] are wavered and you plant that seed and
[1:25:22] all you see is the markings of the
[1:25:24] world, the the scars of life and you see
[1:25:27] sickness just ravishing bodies and you
[1:25:29] see homes divided and you see all this.
[1:25:33] But you got to plant that seed. You got
[1:25:36] to cultivate the ground.
[1:25:38] You got to water it before you see any
[1:25:41] little sprig come up. Water it with your
[1:25:44] praise.
[1:25:45] But we find in our day and age, many of
[1:25:49] us struggle to praise God when we don't
[1:25:51] see it.
[1:25:53] We struggle to praise God when we don't
[1:25:56] feel it. We struggle to praise God
[1:25:58] because we think, "Well, I'm a
[1:26:00] hypocrite. Satan tell you, you got no
[1:26:03] right to praise you." What? God ain't
[1:26:05] done nothing for
[1:26:07] you. How many of you are breathing at
[1:26:09] this moment?
[1:26:12] He done something. That's right.
[1:26:14] And the Bible says, "Let everything that
[1:26:17] has breath."
[1:26:20] How many of you are breathing again?
[1:26:22] Let everything that hath breath praise
[1:26:27] ye the Lord.
[1:26:30] It's a benefit. Yes. to praise the Lord,
[1:26:34] to praise the King of Kings, to lift up
[1:26:37] your adoration to the only one that can
[1:26:41] bestow upon you the glory and honor and
[1:26:45] the blessings in which he so freely died
[1:26:48] for.
[1:26:52] There was a man one time as we begin to
[1:26:54] bring this down be just a few more
[1:26:56] minutes. There was a man one time he
[1:26:59] never wore a pair of shoes. He was in
[1:27:01] South Africa. The prophet was visiting
[1:27:03] South Africa there. And he never had a
[1:27:04] pair of shoes on his feet. And he was
[1:27:06] back in the jungles. And he was born to
[1:27:07] missionary parents. And he was born with
[1:27:09] deformed feet. And he come walking up
[1:27:11] there and he was clubbing his feet
[1:27:12] along. And he had a shoe box under his
[1:27:16] arm. Shoe box under his arm. And someone
[1:27:19] said, "What do you got in there?" He
[1:27:21] said, "I got a pair of
[1:27:24] shoes." So what do you expect to do with
[1:27:26] them? Are they for your father? He said,
[1:27:29] "Nope.
[1:27:30] I'm going to wear
[1:27:33] them. And the same look that some of you
[1:27:35] are giving me is the same look that he
[1:27:36] got
[1:27:37] then. What do you
[1:27:40] mean? And when the service was over, he
[1:27:44] had those shoes on his feet, running
[1:27:47] down through the lot just as hard as he
[1:27:49] could, praising God.
[1:27:53] What did he do? He took God at his word.
[1:27:56] That's right.
[1:27:58] He never had a pair of shoes on his
[1:28:00] feet. He never knew what it felt to to
[1:28:03] to really walk the way a normal child
[1:28:06] walked. But he had said they asked him
[1:28:08] and he said, "I seen others coming
[1:28:10] through that were crippled and was
[1:28:12] healed. I seen those who were blind that
[1:28:14] would see again and God would not turn
[1:28:18] me down."
[1:28:20] I wonder evening light tabernacle and
[1:28:23] those that on the stream tonight, how
[1:28:25] many of you brought your shoe box to
[1:28:27] church tonight? It may be a child. It
[1:28:30] may be a husband. It may be a wife. It
[1:28:32] may be for healing. It may be for
[1:28:34] deliverance. But you brought that to the
[1:28:36] house of God tonight. And when this
[1:28:38] service is over, you know that God is
[1:28:41] going to give you the exactly what you
[1:28:42] need. What did he do? He tapped into the
[1:28:45] word of God. He tapped into the benefits
[1:28:48] of serving God. He seen the crippled
[1:28:50] hill. He seen the blinded eyes open. And
[1:28:53] he knew in his heart of hearts that God
[1:28:56] won't turn me down. What about an
[1:28:58] evenite tabernacle? God ain't going to
[1:29:00] turn you down tonight. You're a son of
[1:29:02] God. You're a daughter of God. And
[1:29:04] there's benefits of serving this
[1:29:08] God. There's benefits tonight. Healing
[1:29:11] is a benefit. Deliverance is a benefit.
[1:29:14] The Holy Ghost is a benefit.
[1:29:20] Benefits. Forget not
[1:29:23] all of his benefits. Let me tell you
[1:29:26] another
[1:29:27] story up at Ko Tabernacle. Brother
[1:29:31] Timothy mentioned this, but it was
[1:29:32] already in my notes. He mentioned this
[1:29:34] past weekend. It's a young boy. He was
[1:29:36] crippled. He had polio. Couldn't get
[1:29:38] into prayer line. So they bring him back
[1:29:41] for prayer at the end of the service.
[1:29:42] And he said, "Mr. Bam. He said, "Can you
[1:29:44] tell me some consolation?" He said,
[1:29:45] "Yes, son. You got polio." He said,
[1:29:47] "Yeah, that's right." He said, "Your
[1:29:50] name is such and such. You come from
[1:29:51] such and such a place." He said, "That's
[1:29:52] right." And he asked, "What about my
[1:29:56] healing?" And
[1:29:58] notice what the reply. By his
[1:30:04] stripes, you are healed.
[1:30:07] by his stripes. Not man's stripes, not
[1:30:11] the church's stripes, not the
[1:30:13] denomination stripes, not the creed
[1:30:16] stripes, not the idea stripes, but by
[1:30:19] his stripes, you are already healed.
[1:30:24] And notice what this young man did. This
[1:30:26] young man goes back to his home, go back
[1:30:27] to his neighborhood, and he begins to to
[1:30:30] praise God. He begins to confess, "By
[1:30:33] his stripes, I am healed." And later
[1:30:36] that week he was making such a stir that
[1:30:39] the local ministry came to his house and
[1:30:42] said you are bringing a reproach on the
[1:30:43] name of Christ. Now could you imagine
[1:30:46] thus four ministers coming to your house
[1:30:48] for acknowledging what God said he would
[1:30:50] do.
[1:30:52] And here these ministers just they just
[1:30:55] kind of come on him and they say you got
[1:30:57] to stop doing this. He said, "Mister, if
[1:31:00] you was sitting in the seat that I'm
[1:31:01] sitting in, if you were sitting in the
[1:31:04] chair that I'm in, why would you rob me
[1:31:06] of my last hope?" What am I telling you,
[1:31:09] church tonight? And he said, "In the
[1:31:11] name of Jesus Christ," he said, "By his
[1:31:14] stripes, I am healed." And he jumped up
[1:31:16] and be around that place. What was it?
[1:31:19] He tapped into the benefits. Though the
[1:31:22] preacher didn't believe, though the
[1:31:23] family didn't believe, though the
[1:31:25] neighborhood didn't believe, he believed
[1:31:27] the word. He believed it was for him.
[1:31:29] And I'm here to tell you, it's for you
[1:31:32] tonight. The benefits of serving
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:39] God. We don't need all this emotion
[1:31:41] though, Brother Joe. All this leaping
[1:31:43] up, jumping, shouting. Musicians, you
[1:31:45] can make your way back jumping,
[1:31:46] shouting, praising God. That's a bunch
[1:31:48] of nonsense.
[1:31:50] Maybe because you're not in that
[1:31:56] seat. Maybe because you're not the
[1:31:59] one who's never
[1:32:02] walked. Maybe you're not the one with
[1:32:04] the doctor's
[1:32:06] report. Maybe you're not the one that
[1:32:09] says cancer stage
[1:32:12] four. Prepare your
[1:32:15] house. Maybe you're not the one that
[1:32:18] says tumor.
[1:32:19] We hope we can get it. We're not going
[1:32:22] to make any promises. Maybe you're not
[1:32:25] the one that your kids are wewarded and
[1:32:31] lost. Maybe you're not the
[1:32:34] one, but per adventure, you
[1:32:40] are. And that prodal comes walking
[1:32:42] through the door.
[1:32:45] The Bible says that that father looked
[1:32:48] down that dusty road day in and day
[1:32:51] out. He looked with
[1:32:55] anticipation. He looked with
[1:32:58] expectancy. It was a
[1:33:00] benefit to serving
[1:33:02] God. And the Bible says when he saw his
[1:33:06] son, he didn't just
[1:33:08] walk and just
[1:33:11] mope. He ran.
[1:33:14] He
[1:33:15] exerted some emotion.
[1:33:18] He exerted, brother Timmy, some
[1:33:20] excitement. My son who was
[1:33:23] lost has now been found. Or maybe it's
[1:33:29] you. Maybe if you was in that seat of
[1:33:31] stage four cancer, no
[1:33:35] hope, put your family in order. Play
[1:33:38] something. He's worthy of it
[1:33:41] all. No hope.
[1:33:44] five
[1:33:50] children, lungs full of
[1:33:53] cancer, breast full of
[1:33:59] cancer, and we preach to you, by his
[1:34:03] stripes, you are healed.
[1:34:06] We preach to you the
[1:34:08] benefits of turning away from the
[1:34:11] doctor's report, looking away from the
[1:34:13] PET scan, looking away from the trial,
[1:34:16] looking away from the
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:20] problem, and looking to the promise.
[1:34:26] And in a
[1:34:29] service, you stand to your your
[1:34:33] feet and you begin to worship.
[1:34:36] You leap
[1:34:39] up jumping and
[1:34:42] leaping and run around the church
[1:34:44] praising
[1:34:45] God
[1:34:49] before any
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:53] report before before any
[1:34:55] report that you're cancer
[1:34:58] free. What am I telling you
[1:35:01] tonight? I know it's not all about
[1:35:03] emotion. I get it.
[1:35:07] But if you were sitting in some of the
[1:35:08] seats that some of these people are
[1:35:10] sitting in today, why would we want to
[1:35:13] rob them of their last hope? That's
[1:35:15] right. Why would we want to keep the
[1:35:18] benefits away from them? Why would we
[1:35:20] want to squash and squaltch their
[1:35:24] enthusiasm for the word? We was in a
[1:35:27] meeting this past
[1:35:30] weekend on a Saturday night after the
[1:35:33] prayer
[1:35:36] line. A church that's been hungering to
[1:35:39] break through for
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:43] worship. I was there a couple weeks ago
[1:35:46] and for the first time in 15 years, they
[1:35:48] begin to do a Jericho march around the
[1:35:50] church.
[1:35:52] They were priming an
[1:35:55] unexpectancy when the presence of the
[1:35:57] Lord comes. But in this night, as I
[1:36:00] bring this to a close, on this night
[1:36:03] though, one by
[1:36:05] one, people begin to act
[1:36:10] uncharacteristically because the
[1:36:12] benefits begin to fall
[1:36:14] down. the benefits of being a child of
[1:36:17] God. To have that word revealed to you
[1:36:20] that I may have walked in this prayer
[1:36:22] line with a list of
[1:36:23] prayers in my
[1:36:26] hand. And a young man sat in the
[1:36:29] back, never before has he done this,
[1:36:32] jumped up out of a seat and begin to not
[1:36:34] only did he run around on church,
[1:36:35] brother Timothy, he ran on the platform
[1:36:37] and ran around several times. Never in
[1:36:40] his life has he's ever done that. Now, I
[1:36:43] say it's not all about emotion, but he
[1:36:45] be to worship God and thank God and
[1:36:49] water that seed before one request was
[1:36:52] ever answered on his note. What am I
[1:36:55] telling you tonight? I'm telling you
[1:36:58] there's
[1:36:59] benefits. There's benefits to serving
[1:37:02] God. There's benefits as we find in
[1:37:05] Exodus 15 and verse 26. For I am the
[1:37:07] Lord that health thee. That's a
[1:37:10] benefit because power has been restored
[1:37:14] to the church. We know what it means to
[1:37:16] not have power in this church. We have
[1:37:19] swept
[1:37:22] coat and we know what it means when the
[1:37:24] power has been restored and the lights
[1:37:27] are on and we can function and we can
[1:37:30] operate the way that we as believers
[1:37:32] operate. We don't have to sit in the
[1:37:34] dark. We don't have to question. We
[1:37:35] don't have to worry is it going to come
[1:37:37] on? its own. The power has been
[1:37:40] restored. He's the Lord that health thee
[1:37:42] in Isaiah 53. He was wounded for our
[1:37:44] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[1:37:46] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:37:48] peace was upon him. And with his stripes
[1:37:51] we are Amen. Come on, church. We are
[1:37:56] healed.
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:58] Notice Mark 16. And these signs shall
[1:38:00] follow them that believe in my name.
[1:38:02] They shall cast out devils. They shall
[1:38:04] speak with new tongues. They shall take
[1:38:06] up serpents. If they drink any deadly
[1:38:08] thing, it shall not hurt them. They
[1:38:10] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:38:14] shall recover. That's not a question.
[1:38:17] That's not a if. That's not a maybe.
[1:38:19] That's a
[1:38:20] benefit. They shall recover.
[1:38:24] That's in God's word. And God's word is
[1:38:27] himself. And he is
[1:38:29] eternal. I'm telling you, you can bank
[1:38:32] on it. You can rest your soul on it.
[1:38:35] It's a benefit tonight. By his stripes
[1:38:38] we are healed. You can lay hands on the
[1:38:41] sick and they shall
[1:38:46] recover. Philippians 4:19, "But my God
[1:38:50] shall supply all your need according to
[1:38:53] his riches in glory." That's a benefit.
[1:38:57] He won't supply your wants, but he will
[1:38:59] make sure he has ample supply for your
[1:39:01] needs.
[1:39:07] Malachi 3 and:e 10 it says prove me now
[1:39:11] herewith sayaith the Lord of hosts if I
[1:39:13] will not open to you the windows of
[1:39:16] heaven and pour out a blessing that
[1:39:18] there shall be not be room enough to
[1:39:21] receive
[1:39:23] it oh I hope you came with your cups
[1:39:26] lifted
[1:39:28] up me evening life tabernacle prove me
[1:39:31] tonight on a Wednesday tonight that I
[1:39:33] would open up the windows of heaven on a
[1:39:35] Wednesday night and pour out a blessing
[1:39:37] that you don't even have enough room in
[1:39:39] this building. You don't have enough
[1:39:41] room in your cup. It'll be overflowing,
[1:39:43] pressed down, church. What does God just
[1:39:45] want your praise tonight? He wants you
[1:39:48] to accept him. It's a
[1:39:51] benefit. A benefit tonight.
[1:39:55] Prove me, sayeth the Lord. I walked out
[1:39:58] here tonight. I didn't want to preach
[1:39:59] tonight. My heart's been heavy because
[1:40:01] I've got different things on my mind,
[1:40:03] different people on my heart. But I'm
[1:40:05] proving the Lord tonight. I've been
[1:40:07] fasting for two days. I'm proving the
[1:40:09] Lord tonight that he'll honor my
[1:40:11] request. He'll honor his word tonight. I
[1:40:13] got needs in my family. I want to see
[1:40:15] God move. I want to see God filled. I
[1:40:18] want to see God come down and baptize
[1:40:20] with the Holy Ghost. I approve of you
[1:40:22] tonight, Lord. It's a benefit. It's a
[1:40:25] benefit. You said I can have my family.
[1:40:27] You said I can have my children. It's a
[1:40:30] benefit tonight. I receive it. I receive
[1:40:33] it
[1:40:38] tonight. Malachi 3:12 says, "The nations
[1:40:42] shall call you blessed." Oh, you've been
[1:40:44] called every dirty name in the book, but
[1:40:46] the nations going to call you
[1:40:49] blessed. You shall be a delight,
[1:40:52] delightsome land, sayaith the Lord of
[1:40:54] hosts. Thou shalt also be the crown of
[1:40:57] glory in the hand of the Lord, a royal
[1:40:59] diadem in the hand of thy God. In Isaiah
[1:41:02] 62 and verse4, thou shalt be no more
[1:41:05] turned forsaken, neither shall the land
[1:41:07] anymore be termed desolate. Thou shalt
[1:41:10] be called Hezbollah, and the land Bulah,
[1:41:12] for the Lord delightth in thee, and thy
[1:41:15] land shall be married. The Lord shall
[1:41:18] make thee the
[1:41:19] head, and not the tail.
[1:41:24] The
[1:41:25] Lord shall make thee the head and not
[1:41:28] the
[1:41:29] tail. A
[1:41:31] benefit. Proverbs 3 and verse 5. Trust
[1:41:34] in the Lord with all thy heart. Lean not
[1:41:36] to thy own understanding. In all thy
[1:41:38] ways acknowledge him and he shall direct
[1:41:42] thy paths. You don't have to go at it
[1:41:44] alone, young person. You don't have to
[1:41:46] try to drift through this life trying to
[1:41:48] figure it all out. Delight thyself in
[1:41:50] the Lord. Acknowledge him.
[1:41:54] Lean not to your own understanding, but
[1:41:56] he will direct your path. Jeremiah 29,
[1:41:59] we're very familiar with this one. I
[1:42:00] know the thoughts that I think toward
[1:42:01] you, sayith the Lord. Thoughts of peace
[1:42:03] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:42:05] end. But in verse 12, he says, "You
[1:42:08] shall call upon me and you shall go and
[1:42:10] pray unto me, and I will hearken unto
[1:42:13] you a benefit that God hears your
[1:42:17] prayers." Amen. Not only does he hear,
[1:42:20] but he
[1:42:22] hearkens. You shall seek me and find me
[1:42:25] when you search me with all your heart.
[1:42:27] I will be found to you, sayaeth the
[1:42:29] Lord, and I will turn away your
[1:42:31] captivity, and I will gather you from
[1:42:33] all the nations.
[1:42:36] Benefit. Philippians
[1:42:39] 4:7, the peace of God which passes all
[1:42:41] understanding will keep your hearts and
[1:42:43] your minds through Christ Jesus. Isaiah
[1:42:46] 26:3, "Thou shalt keep him in perfect
[1:42:48] peace, whose mind is stayed on thee,
[1:42:50] because he trustth in thee." In Matthew
[1:42:55] 11:28, Bible says, "Come unto me all ye
[1:42:57] that are weary and heavy laden, and I
[1:43:00] will give you
[1:43:02] rest, a benefit. You don't have to toll.
[1:43:06] You don't have to
[1:43:08] stress. Take my yoke upon you, lean of
[1:43:11] me, and or learn of me. said, "For my I
[1:43:13] am meek and lowly in heart, and you
[1:43:15] shall find rest for your souls. For my
[1:43:18] yoke is easy, and my burden is
[1:43:22] light." The power has been restored back
[1:43:25] to the end time
[1:43:28] church. And I just encourage you even
[1:43:30] like
[1:43:31] tabernacle, forget not all
[1:43:34] benefits. He's worthy. Let's sing that
[1:43:38] to him if you'll stand with us tonight.
[1:43:40] He's worthy of it all.
[1:43:43] He's worthy of every praise before you
[1:43:44] feel it. He's worthy of every adoration
[1:43:47] before you got one sign that is done.
[1:43:50] Come on, brother
[1:43:53] Andrew. You're worthy of it all.
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:03] You're worthy of it all.

[1:44:23] glory.
