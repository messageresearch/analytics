TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign we're going to go ahead and get started thank you everybody for being here and man for testimony night that we have we're really man we're really excited to hear about What the Lord Has Done in the Paris family I can tell you if knowing them for many years now it's been uh wonderful to hear a lot more about the back story to What the Lord Has Done and it'll be a blessing to each one of you so we're just going to sing a song if we could stand before we turn it over to brother Aaron I Love You Lord and I lift my voice amen [Music] two words amen that's what we're here to do with our testimony with our lives [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] please and I live my voice [Music] [Applause] words [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and let it be us ing sound you amen like Michael said thank you so much for for coming out tonight for this testimony night and a night of Fellowship you know it was brother Michael's uh desire to do something like this a few months back and then begin talking and and you know it's we've been blessed as a church in many many ways and the Lord the Lord has seen fit in the last few years to to to have families that have moved in and to become part of us a part of our church family and and brother Michael's desire was you know he said we don't want to become a a church full of people who don't know one another and so we wanted to have opportunity for for people to to give their testimonies not only to give them opportunity to share but to give us opportunity to learn about them and know their backstories like like brother Michael said and so I first met the the parishes a little over two years ago at the Easter camp that we had here because we couldn't go down to to the Youth Camp so we had a meeting here and and I guess coming up in August they would have been here two years I believe it was in August about two years and and it's been a pleasure to have them as part of our our church family they've been a real blessing to many and so tonight I just want you to join me in welcoming them as they come to to share their story about what God has done in their life [Applause] yeah and I get I guess kind of the format that we want to talk about a little bit tonight would be to take take your lives as individuals briefly your childhood your upbringing bring it right up to the point of where y'all met one another and then from there obviously it'll be a story that that you can tell together but what we'll do if it's okay with y'all is we'll start with you okay and and your upbringing your childhood we'll start right at the very beginning where were you born yeah I was born actually just outside of Washington DC uh my my folks had moved down from upstate New York my dad was a police officer and so he started working with an agency there in in the District of Columbia and so I was born in Virginia so just across south of the Potomac River and um but I would actually grow up most of my life just in the inside of Maryland so so born born in Virginia yeah your dad is a police officer I was trying to find the Mason-Dixon Line in there he was close he's close to it so your dad was a police officer tell me a little bit about um your home life as far as was your family Believers yeah um my earliest memories were were Church home church we um my parents got saved when I was probably two and a half or three years old um my dad's mom was a Believer had attended some of brother branham's meetings in Upstate New York so the message was very early in their family so Church you know nobody knew what really a church was outside of they'd left the denominations and so you just had Church in your house so I remember like people would come through our home like Jackie Benton Ned Iverson Ron Walbert and you know different different ministers would come through and preach now Moses was it in your home yeah they would actually come to our house and what kind of group did you have meet in there just family mostly just family and then a couple of couple of other family members and a pastor eventually moved in and established a little church there so we did in the early years growing up have a home have a church there so at some point um it seemed to me like y'all moved out west is that right yeah we did um my dad took a job as a welder in the oil rig industry and and I that he knew kind of took us off to South Dakota so we lived in the very southern part of South Dakota for a little while about a year and we just had tapes to listen to so it was like being in the desert nearly you'd say spiritually so I'm probably eight nine years old at the time and spent a year there and then spent two years two the next two years 80 81 in Oklahoma so what part of Oklahoma Claremore okay clear more area where yeah brother Rice is now yes okay yeah right there so you're born first seven eight years you're in Maryland and that's when y'all head to South Dakota yep it's been about a year there then you end up in in Claremore Oklahoma Claremore Oklahoma and you have the picture Michael of um brother Ivan and sister Ruth I ran across a picture today so while he's looking for that when you're in Claremore yeah do you all have a church there yeah there's a church I think there were two churches there if I if I remember correctly uh it's pretty little but I know we went to two different churches there but my dad didn't really really feel connected uh spiritually in that direction and he wanted to get back to Maryland my mom did really bad because that's where they felt like home was so we ended up moving back while we're there two things there's a there's a connection even with this church that you made while you're in Claremore yeah because you run across what family there I run across the wrestlers like to the degree of brother Ivan had to kill two goats to feed both our families [Applause] I guess I haven't disclosed I'm from a family of nine kids so I'm number three in the in the chain and so I've got five siblings uh yeah so there's the first four of us so that's in Maryland before we we go out west did you find the other picture brother Michael okay so there's a picture I found today of um of sister Ruth's dad and her standing with my dad and they got a picture so that would have been 1979 1980. so at this point in Oklahoma are there already nine of y'all kids yeah so we're we've the whole band is is uh together there literally that's why I took two goats that's why I took two goats so so at this point y'all moved back to Maryland same town um nearly the same town the same area first for sure yeah but a different house um but the same folks the same people that we've we fellowshipped with um before we left we came back to the same area and your dad goes back to being a police officer goes back to being a police officer and um actually is a as a teacher so he kind of was into teaching he had a degree so he could kind of run run both sides did your mom work no Mom was too busy mom was a stay-at-home it's hard to work with she worked she worked she worked with nine kids she worked out dad worked really hard too um I don't remember a day my dad not working hard um he was a welder so a steel worker they're very hard-working people they generally don't take the pay for what they do because they feel like it's the labor of their hands and you know they want to be able to give back so that was a lot of the years that I was impressed upon me of just the the work ethic so so we're back in Maryland and you let's just put you around the age of 12 13 14 somewhere in there church is a big part of your life yes yeah and you made mention even the did your dad lead songs yeah my dad LED songs for a number of years I don't really remember how many I I remember sitting in the back of the car I mean you've got all the kids piled in the car and somebody's got to pick songs because Dad's leading song service that usually felt my lot so I'm going through the only belief song book you know picking my favorite songs for song service you had an influence on the service at a young age very young age so we hit high school and I had a memory um I even remember the type of chair that I was sitting in I was probably 12 years old it had the Chrome like they were it's sectional so it had like a long bench but each chair had its own end of they were all connected and they had the Chrome handles and like a teal vinyl seat pretty slippery but as a 12 year old kid I'm sitting there and I'm hearing the preaching and he's preaching about pharaoh and Moses and just how Pharaoh was used as a tool Moses was elected of God and I was like oh that would be the awfulest thing to turn out to be a pharaoh I would not ever want to be a pharaoh I I want to be a Moses good call but as a young person that impressed me sure um but not actually not feeling God ever deal with me in that regard but just as a just an understanding that God has elect but God also has tools that he uses that he discards after use yeah so at a young age you recognize the need to be a Moses yes so you have a you know church is a big part of your life but would you say there's ever an experience with God in your youth at all no not beyond that um that would probably be the only if you call that an experience an understanding um but that really that was it so when you hit your high school years would you say did you begin to drift from church yeah as a 15 16 year old I saw the need for money so I saw the need for a job um I was able to get a job get a car and there started the the Trek away from home I started to miss church and it became just common in the home that you could be at home but not have to go to church my oldest brother had gone away to college and come back and he brought everything from the world back home and um yeah so those were the years where Church became less of an influence you graduate high school and you don't stick around do you no I don't stick around I was 18 years old and I met the military recruiter at high school and I wanted to be a cop I wanted to be like my dad but I had this problem with age you can't be a cop until you're 21 and carry a gun but the marine recruiter said we'll let you carry a gun right out of boot camp like no problem and that was pretty attractive to me so I signed up for six years like why not you can be a marine carry a gun for six years and um that'd be great so for timetable's sake what year are we in right now we're 1989 going into 1990. and you sign up and they're shipping you to boot camp where the week after I get out of high school I'm on the bus to boot camp Paris Island South Carolina and this is about the time we're starting to have trouble in the Middle East yeah in 1990 91 somewhere in there we have Desert Storm right yeah August of 1990 I think Desert Storm kicks off look at that fella there oh my goodness yeah I was so so Desert Storm starts and the way it works if I remember right with you talking to me is you're in training to go but the war only lasts a few days it lasts a hundred days and I'd come out of boot camp gone to a school they sent me to another school a special ops school for anti-terrorism because that was a big deal in the world starting in about Beirut so 85. um so I was supposed to be going immediately to the desert and they stopped all deployments like nobody else went so no Marines were coming back so I went to another school and then another school so I probably went to four four or five schools in that time because the schools were empty because everybody was over there yeah so it was a situation where the war ended but they hadn't come back yet correct so what all did you get trained in just curious yeah so I I'd be um we were in a small unit so everybody kind of had to wear a lot of hats so I became a an ammunition driver so I went to the ammo depot and picked up all the ammunition that we would need I would drive five ton trucks because I had my driver's license I could get a bus license so I drove all the Marines so we go out to the out to the range and we'd shoot three hundred thousand dollars worth of ammunition in a week and I went through a swimming instructor School did that over in Japan as well flew helicopters and jumped out of the back of helicopters into the ocean did us a boat School learn how to drive boats to take Marines to the beach and you also uh mentioned like a pre-sniper school or something like that yeah that was part of the special ops unit you have to wear a lot of hats so um SWAT is kind of the catchphrase in the secular world and I did the sniper portion of what you would call a SWAT team so at this point in your life you loving the Marines yeah the Marines is a lot of fun we're busy we're deployed all the time where there's a lot of things happening and it's pretty exciting this brings us pretty close to the point of meeting her as well right yeah so at some point you end up in California yeah that's where I'd gone to this this special unit so I was there about two years and we were deployed a lot but on one of those deployments I came back and I I'm at Debbie so unless there's something else that you want to add I'm going to skip over to sister that's good where were you born so I was born in Baltimore Maryland which is Derek and I are two weeks apart in age and we were born 45 minutes away from each other in the same area so Baltimore Maryland for me and Falls Church for Derek so um my dad worked for Levi Strauss and when I was five years old he got transferred to California so when I say where I'm from I don't often say Baltimore Maryland because I didn't grow up there I don't have any real connections there I say that I was raised in Napa California which is the wine valley that's where that's the area I grew up in no now there said that brother Derek tells us that his family was message Believers yours were not no um I guess by association Catholic yes to what degree are y'all at Mass every week or no no Easter Christmas Catholics and I don't think it was even every Easter and every it was occasionally occasional Easter an occasional Christmas so you spend the majority of your childhood in Napa yes California with a really good moral upright family that was giving the worked in the community they volunteered at the state hospital they volunteered for Special Olympics just a really a good family and a family that respected God and would never let anyone around them take the name of the Lord in vain is what my mom would say like you would never do something like that when I was in third grade my parents moved me to a private school in town a seven-day Adventist School not because we had any affiliation with seven-day Adventist or even knew anything about it but it was just a good private school in town so they sent me there so as far as my religious upbringing I always say well it was really Seventh-day Adventist because I went there from third grade to eighth grade so all of my Bible stories and foundation and everything came from The Seventh-Day Adventist before we move on there was a story you told that just shows the hand of God you know in your life uh something that happened when you were five years old when your parents were having a get together at their house I believe it was around Christmas was that right it was it was a Christmas my dad was having a company Christmas party so tell us that story so we I grew up on the river so in in Napa there's a river that flows through and we had a dock and a boat and but I was not you know obviously not allowed to go down there and be unsupervised well they were having a party that night and whatever got into my mind I decided to go down to the dock because I wanted to see the Ducks and I leaned over the dock and fell promptly fell right in at that moment my grandfather had actually stepped outside and he saw it happen if he had not stepped outside at that moment I would not have lived because I remember being underwater I remember reaching up I remember going down and coming up like the typical they say you you know like Bob three times and and that's it I remember that I remember being under the dock and not being able to reach up but he saw it happen so he ran down reached into the water and pulled me out well little stories like that actually kind of connected us when we first met gives the same thing nearly happened to me um my oldest brother and sister we like to catch Bullfrogs we had a pond in front of our place and I mean bullfrogs are fun to catch when you're a little kid so we're all peering over the edge of the dock and my brother pushed me in to catch one because it seemed like the thing to do that's what brothers do we couldn't swim I had five so I I tried to doggy paddle or something but I'm just going down and and my sister just reaches into the muck of the pond and feels around and feels my hand and pulls me out you're the same and I was the same age five years old and five years yeah we talked the other the other evening and you mentioned another neat story that I think the people would enjoy at some point uh you ended up getting moved to a Catholic school is that right in 10th Grade and there's a story about your First Holy Communion that um that I think is is very interesting because you had had all these lessons in The Seventh-Day Adventist Church and now you're with the Catholic Church those two don't necessarily see things exactly the same no and so tell us about the First Holy Communion that whole thing yes so with the Catholics you um normally you're five years old I happen to be 10 so I was late going through it but you go to classes before you're allowed to take that first communion so I went through all the classes and I don't remember them at all but I did it and then at the end of the classes you're supposed to go to a priest meet with a priest recite your little thing and confess your sins and so I went for some reason it wasn't a confessional box like they normally have I actually went to his office and it was just him and I and he's you know waiting for me to recite my thing and and tell my sins and I'm 10 years old and I look him in the eye and I said if Jesus died for my sins and the curtain rent from the top to the bottom which means I don't have to come and confess my sins to you I can tell it right to Jesus and he just looked at me and he said go say ten Hail Mary's and promptly sent me out of his office so he didn't even have anything to say but in my heart I was like all right that's the truth because he did not want to he didn't want to deal with that so I went and kneeled down at the at the Pew and didn't say my ten Hill Mary's and walked out and I'm pretty sure I was not in a Catholic church again after that so I know we're moving rather rather quickly but at some point we ended up toward towards you know late Middle School maybe early high school years and and fall in with the wrong Crown I do I do just briefly tell us a little bit about that and where you know how your family reacted to that yeah so in eighth grade I I didn't want to be in private school anymore it was it was Junior High years and that's when things get weird with friends and everything and so I told my parents that I didn't want to go to that school anymore and that I wanted to go to public school and they let me so I went on to public school started out okay and then quickly became not okay I got in with the wrong crowd of people um just the the new waivers the the purple hair you know all of this all of that stuff so that's the group of people that I felt comfortable with because um I don't know I just did so I wound up in the wrong crowd of people and taking me down a wrong path we're not here to judge you but I just got to ask did you have purple hair I did okay I just wanted to know if you were just hanging out with them or if you had the purple hair too it was brief it was brief and even the time in the public school is brief because my parents saw obviously I mean your child's got purple hair there's problems you got problems um so it really in 10th Grade they took me out of public school and sent me to boarding school you know I find that extremely interesting because I guess I knew that boarding schools still existed but typically you think of that as being something way old-fashioned way back in the day but they just told you okay we're sending you to live at school was there a religious affiliation to this school back to the Seventh-day Adventist s they really did have a big part in your life so tell us just just briefly how long you were at boarding school how that experience was for you so it was good it did get me out of that group of friends and well I mean the funny thing about boarding school is you've got rich kids there so the rich kids are going to boarding school and a lot of them are getting sent there because they were like me and they got in with the wrong crowd so I laughed and told my parents after the fact I said there was way more drugs at boarding school than I ever had opportunity to get to in public school but I wasn't doing that there to be honest um I did get in with a nice group of of kids and things were going well for a while but then I turned I was turning 18 and I just decided that I didn't want to be there anymore and because I was turning 18 I called my parents and I said I'm turning 18 if you don't come pick me up I'm just gonna walk and they came and picked me up so at the age of 18 you're done with school I'm done and it's ridiculous because it was January of my senior year like I could have just finished but no so you moved back home yes and things go swimmingly um no because I've still got this uh attitude and um my parents you know they say okay fine you're not going to be in school you got to get your GED you've got to get a job and I said great that's what I want to do anyway so I got the job but I wasn't getting along with my parents um so at 19 years old I moved out and what year are we in 19 1990 approaching so let's try to bring this together yeah so you tell me how you end up yeah on the day that you meet her so the base that I'm stationed at is on the Oakland side of the San Francisco Bay Area and a lot of times the guys on the base would either stay there they'd go to Sacramento or go to San Francisco and um one of the guys said let's go to Napa I'm like what do you do in Napa he goes I don't know let's go find out so we drive to Napa with not a lot of understanding of where things are or anything and we find a bar to pull into and we pull over it's I mean it's early in the AFT like I'd say early in the evening it's like eight nine o'clock at night not really late and um I'm the designated driver so we're just hanging out seeing who shows up at this place and uh shooting pool and I meet Debbie mm-hmm I'm sitting at the other end of the bar oh he's cute are you in uniform I have to know no okay I mean I looked to like it because I didn't have any hair I got you yeah and and so y'all meet each other and it was interesting because y'all told me y'all clicked right off the bat because born in the same place a lot of same life experience yeah we started sharing stories of like where are you from where are you from and oh really oh that's interesting oh that happened to me too oh that's kind of weird so and then she tells me she's going back to Maryland the next day so we just really connected instantly connected instantly into the level yes so I was leaving on vacation and um so I had not dated a lot amazingly when uh during this time period of my teens and everything because anytime I would be talking to someone if it would start to get serious I would cut it off like I did not want any kind of serious relationships so um usually a boy would last like two weeks and that would be it and so anyway met Derek and then the next day going back to Maryland to be with family I told my family I met the man I'm going to marry she didn't tell me that I took it so far as to go to an antique store on this trip and buy something that looked like an engagement ring and put it on my finger and wear it for that whole trip because I did not even want anybody else to even talk to me no later Revelation later but not long so so take me through this this Whirlwind relationship you're in the military yeah you're deployed I get deployed like immediately with within a a couple of weeks of us meeting that is um we met in July and this is November so July of 92 and this is November of 92. this was like our first pictures together so um you get deployed pretty quickly I get deployed twice in this time frame deployed in October I came back for this um Marine Corps ball and then I got deployed again in late December early January it wasn't a trip that we were planning but it ended up being almost four months long we got stationed up in Bremerton Washington it's kind of funny I remember I remember being there and saying you me a million dollars to live in this state it rains constantly I mean where did I live for 25 years that that's how it works right there yeah so at some point there's this um I don't know how to put it rational decision yes that y'all should get married it wasn't necessarily your typical thought process on marriage no it was fairly practical well we really liked each other a lot that helps so we wanted to we wanted to spend time together and I'm getting ready to be permanently a permanent Duty station change from the west coast to the east coast I'm going all the way to North Carolina for the next four years and that's a long time to be away from Napa so we had this couple of conversations on the phone in January of 93 and I said you know it really makes sense to me if you were to go with me now it would be expensive though because we'd have to get a house off the base and it's not really going to look very good if we're not married so don't you think we should get married [Applause] of course I didn't know that that has been sitting there all along she's been waiting on you to yeah [Applause] he wasn't there there was no down on a knee here's a rain situation no I just popped that she asked me I'm on a pay phone in the barracks in a hallway on a knee I know no pictures to prove it but there I was no special moment so she agrees she agrees that it would be cheaper if y'all get married because y'all can live on base it's just a smart thing to do because they'll pay for us to move it and you move like they give you a house there makes perfect sense makes all the sense in the world all right so you told a story that I that I loved about trying to convince your commanding officer yeah that you are going to get married but in order to do it you had to be allowed to come home early I do I've got to leave the deployment early to come home to get married and about three months out I start trying to convince my commanding officer that I need to be let loose early then everybody else everybody else got to stay behind and I'm going to get married and so he did everything he could to convince me to not go so one night I'm out walking Dry Dock on a nuclear sub and he comes out there he says oh I don't know if I was a lance corporal or I probably was just a kid he goes so understanding is you want to get married yes sir he says you realize you have to go home early said yes sir you know I've seen a thousand of them not work out probably not the thing you want to do I said no I really love her sir no I've heard that a thousand times he says well tell you what I'm going to do he says I'm gonna give you six months to think about it see that ship over there that's the Nimitz it's sales in the morning I'll cut you orders and you can be on it and I'll let her know that you just couldn't come home I was like gulp I can't do that sir so so I had to convince him that I wanted to go home and get married so after he tried to talk you out of it and it was just uh you were convinced that cheaper was the way to go so you all get married and you come home you're planning a wedding this whole time the whole thing all by yourself so it's a good thing that your officer lets you come home early yeah because there was a wedding being planned it was and we have pigs and y'all get married in what year in April of 93 yeah 33. now I'm gonna stop right there for a minute all this time yeah all this time has been a couple of months no no no all this time nine nine months nine months I'm referencing all this time meaning when you left home oh yeah till now yeah we've been about three years has Church the message God any of that playing any role in your life at all um no no except one moment um when we met with the Episcopal priest who was gonna marry us uh we had to meet with him because he's got to tell us you know what's going to happen and I'm he says I'm going to stand up here and you know the whole Entourage and I said when you go to pray for us will you will you pray for us and end your prayer in the name of Jesus Christ and not in the the trinity he just kind of looked at us he goes yeah I can do that and I I don't know why I had that in me just to ask or to say but like that was the only fleeting passing thought of God or any kind of Truth had to be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ yeah it was important so she knows nothing of your upbringing no y'all are getting married and how many times have you met his family zero zero yeah um yeah so let's fast forward to the first meeting yeah there comes a time where you're going home to see family how long have y'all been married a couple of months a couple of months we're married and I'm getting stationed in North Carolina so we have a couple extra days to drive across the country and um she smiles because it was an exciting trip and uh and meet my folks so she's never like I haven't told her my background it's interesting when you're in the military you're either Catholic or you're Protestant or you're um Pentecostal or your Baptist or something and I grew up in a little tiny Message Church from the time I was born I don't even know what a Pentecostal is I don't know what a Baptist is I've never been exposed to anybody I don't know what a Protestant is I don't know the difference between all these things so I would always just say I'm just a Christian so when she asked me what's my religion I would just say I'm a Christian so your your level of shelter even went to the fact of not even understanding other religions or anything at all at all let alone what I believed true yeah so y'all are heading to meet your family yeah and she has no idea no idea what's your impression when you walk in the door I you have a picture of the house Mike so I lived out in the country it was in the middle of the cornfield middle of a cornfield in a house built in 1740 and I walked into that kitchen there before my eyes was a Little House on the Prairie and I'm looking around at these people and I'm like what is this now my religious experience is Catholic and Seventh-day Adventist I don't know anything else I have never seen a Pentecostal person in my life so this blows my mind I'm I'm like wow okay that's great but they're nice people they're really nice and I love them right away at this point how many of your siblings are living in the house how many of your siblings are still there well I think only two are gone so it's still a house full yeah at least seven the full Paris experience yeah all the yes all the kids is there anything all the kids is there anything to do with religion that takes place on this trip is there I asked his mom a couple of questions I mean I can't even remember what was said the only thing I remember her saying is she had not cut her hair in 25 years and I said not even a trim and she said no I have not cut my hair 25 years so I'm like wow okay that's it I didn't delve into anything I didn't ask more questions I'm like that's good so lead me up to when questions start getting asked or when you do end up going to a church service or any of that yeah that's a I think that's a long ways it really is well was this the time where they start sending you books yeah yeah my parents started trying to plant Foods yeah so they would send us we'd get we'd get a little package in the mail every once in a while of a only belief magazine and uh well another one would come and another one would come and sprinkled in in an around that would be June 1992 so would be the uh a message book here and there would be thrown in a cassette tape now and then have a service of a service and ah I was just like I'd flip through them and then put them in a box another one put it in the Box well then we would move like we would move from North Carolina to Napa and then we would move from Napa to Seattle area and all the while here's the Box and Debbie's like can we just get rid of the Box already I said no the Box comes with us it's just a box just bring the box just bring the box I'm like throw the Box away we don't look at it we don't read anything it like just look can we just throw this away I guess you understood it was religious literature but nothing beyond that I tried to read I tried to read um a message book or two that would come in but I didn't even understand that I was reading a sermon I was trying to read it like a book more and so I'd get a page or so into it and not really understand that I'm reading a sermon right like I had read the footprints on the sands of time when I was a kid so I really loved the stories I really connected at that level so I had a respect for anything that had to do with the message from that point right but it didn't go beyond that but I knew that it was special and I doesn't throw it in the garbage because that would be terrible we may not listen to it or read it but we're not throwing it we're not throwing the garbage that's right box comes with us so y'all move back to Napa yep at some point we moved back to Napa I get a job um working in sales for a packaging company um it's my first introduction to Coffee actually one of my customers was a coffee roaster that led to another transfer up to Seattle where we took a territory covering Oregon Washington British Columbia and Alberta Canada um and that's where I was in the Seattle area where we spent a good number of years so we did skip this and it's okay we don't have to shove into it but at some point I mean you're six years up you said I'm done with the Marines yeah and it was for the sake of family yeah yeah Debbie had a lot to do with that I I did see what the lieutenant colonel was saying about a thousand people make the wrong choice I was starting to see that that was real but the wrong choice was the Marines correct for me staying in would have been the wrong choice for our family so you go into sales you live in the Seattle area and at some point and if I skip too far here stop me y'all go back for a family reunion yeah Yeah it's gotten to be about uh 2002. we're in Seattle for about four years at this point yeah we've tried to like we've had Rebecca at this point in one two yeah yeah so I got out of the military in 1996. Okay so we kind of flashed over a couple of years there but Rebecca was born in in 97. while we were in Seattle or the first year we were in Seattle and um we tried we tried to try Church she wanted to raise Rebecca in a Christian home and I have this concept of what a church service should be like in-house quite closely resembled a house so and I would any time we went to a church that had stained glass windows I'm already on my heels and I would ask Derek periodically over the years I wouldn't push too much but I would try to understand like I needed a denominational name like what is this what do you believe what were you raised you know give me a name and he couldn't give me a name he would say the spoken word the message of the hour and I don't get this I need a name neither did he not honestly he didn't get it either no that's right so yeah was it during this time that you're trying to buy a house yeah that's a great story you got to share that story yeah so we're trying to buy our first home and I'm out of the military so you qualify for certain benefits and and I find this mortgage company that has all of this you know portfolio that all they offer um VA things and it's uniquely called Eagle Mortgage so I was attracted to that you know Eagles you know that was that was pretty cool um and somewhere along the line of of meeting with him and talking to him it turns out he's a message believer and invites us to church at his house perfect it yeah I mean I thought this was a this was a we're going to have our house we're going to be able to go to church it's and it's in a house and he has the only belief songbooks and he plays a guitar and preaches like that's exactly what I remember from being a kid but something just didn't click and I couldn't put my finger on it and I don't think Debbie could either but it was almost like a feeling of US foreign no more kind of there wasn't really a spirit of I don't know how to explain it but at that point I was like it feels a little weird and there probably was only about four of you yeah maybe maybe with if both of his other kids showed up we could explain it now we couldn't explain it then but there was no life right yeah there just wasn't any life to back it up yes so we weren't attracted to it so that I say that cost us about two years because that was into late 1999 to 2000. so you go to that church yeah service or one or two times a couple of times and then after that the years without it again yeah until we go to Maryland to a family reunion so in 2002 take it from there yeah do you want to tell that yeah do I so in 2002 my my parents organized my siblings organized this family reunion so there's going to be all nine kids and significant others so it takes a pretty good size beach house to get everybody coordinated to come together and so we're all there and I don't know we spend two or three nights there but the weekend comes along and anytime you go to Mom and Dad's house it's you know you know you don't spend the night Saturday night and be there on Sunday morning because you're going to church or you're going to get asked you're going to get asked anybody they didn't make anybody go to church but some felt more obligated than others and I didn't feel obligated I just you know we're just not going to church until somebody pipes up on Saturday night we're all sitting around drinking having a good time and and wine coolers we're drinking one my mom says so who's going to church with me and Bruce in the morning and uh we will I'm like we literally raised my hand we'll go so you were excited I wasn't excited but I don't know what she's going through because at this time Debbie's kind of been you know you've had uh Y2K you've had uh 911 the Twin Towers have fallen like so she's going she's had a baby so she's going through things that I'm not going through she's reading the Left Behind series she's been raised in the in the Seventh-day Adventist where they teach you to go through the tribulation right um that's just part of their protocol so there's something in your heart that is stirring for something I mean there's yeah I'm I'm on depression medicine um every day I'm on anxiety medicine as I have panic attacks so um and I read the Left Behind series and I'm like you said God Bless yeah I know I'm unsaved but I don't know how to be saved and so this is just an opportunity to go to church it is you're all about it I am yeah so how's that service go you know that's so this is in Delaware and uh it's a small small Church like a metal frame building and maybe 30 40 people are there the guy preaching I actually had grown up with as a kid so I relaxed instantly um it's a message church and we're sitting all the way in the back so Rebecca's maybe four and a half years old at the time and we're just sitting there and listening and it's a good service and all of a sudden I'm noticing that I'm crying and um feeling any emotion but tears are running down my face so I grab her back and put her on my lap and I'm like trying to hide behind her I wouldn't want anybody else to see this weird reaction that's happening and I have nothing no butterflies no excitement I'm crying and it's getting worse I'm not sobbing like a like you'd say you're crying like that I'm just I'm starting to snot so now I'm like wipe my nose on Rebecca's blanket [Music] [Applause] this is really strange I mean this is really strange I don't know what's happening so they dismissed the service they sing a song and everybody gets up and I'm gone I get in the car as quick as I could we drove separately from my mom and dad I got in and closed the door I was like whatever just happened in there I don't know what that was but that that was really weird like I didn't expect anything like that and I've never had that happen before and immediately I wanted to withdraw I wanted to get a get away um I was affected in the service enough that I'm hearing things that are kind of questions that I had so I it uh it made me go hmm maybe there's more to this like I want I want to know more you're finally getting a little bit of a window into what he believed all his years yes or what he so I've got to go back to work thankfully I mean long ways away three thousand miles so I'm going back to Seattle so I catch a flight I think the next day and Debbie and Rebecca are going to stay with Grandma and Grandpa for another week for another week so so I asked Grandma um so where like how can I find a church that's near us and she says well there is a church in Canada and I said great that's three hours north of us I need something like in Seattle right she said well reach out to them and maybe they can help you find something that's close to you so I do I send an email to Cloverdale and I get an email back pretty much immediately because I send this email on Monday and they tell me that they have Outreach meetings in Seattle once a month on a Friday that's great and the next one's like a month away because I guess they had just had one so that would put us to the end of June when we went for that now are you willingly going to this oh it's a month away I say sure sure a lot can happen in a month she might forget she didn't forget no she didn't forget no I was excitingly waited for waiting for that month I tried to work late that day I tried to come up with every excuse why I couldn't get home finally she calls me and it was like death if you don't get to the house right now matter of fact you don't even have time to come home meet me halfway so we had to meet at a Red Robin and leave my car and I had to get in her car but by then okay it's fine we're gonna go to church it's Friday night we didn't have anything else to do anyway it's gonna be fine so we drive through these neighborhoods and you get to an industrial park and then South Tacoma yeah Tacoma it's not like the nicest area no so I we have an address and that's all we have we don't know if it's a big stained glass window church or if we're back to house meetings it's pre-gps are you Matt questioning it MapQuest paper happy but we get we we get to a place that matches this the address and it's a house so we walked through the door and there's folding chairs set up in the living room there's only belief song books on the chairs I relax this is comfortable to me he says Yep this is it this is it oh this is it it's a house it's a house again so we we know Martin Wallman here pretty well right Martin comes over it's his wife's parents house okay okay so there you cranian Russian they're Russian not Ukrainian I knew that sorry Deanna their mom really loved Ivy the kind that grows across the ceiling if you put fishing line so the whole ceiling is covered with ivy looks amazing so like plants yeah so you walk in and everything's ivy for her it's not relaxing no to me this is fine I pick up the only belief song book and I'm oh I remember that song childhood memories yeah start coming back so I'm pretty relaxed um yeah until until the guy gets up to start speaking in Russian now all of a sudden it doesn't make sense we're in the wrong place so the Centurion simple believer I figure I'm a simple believer so I just bowed my head and I said I'm not a Believer at this point that I know of and I say God if I'm where I'm supposed to be if I brought my family where you want me I need to hear like you made it possible on the day of panic cost I need to hear my own language Peter ivanenko becomes and he starts interpreting for brother Mahmoud okay I relax again prayer answered yeah so that's you know a check in the right box so I'm relaxed again and a few 20 30 minutes later they're not always on time um the folks from Cloverdale the Outreach team rolled in John Andes and a bunch of sisters Calista and Margaret they would all came in and oh the atmosphere was all of a sudden on fire like singing and just worshiping the Lord and oh this was totally different from what I remembered growing up and this guy gets up and he starts preaching and I mean we're talking preaching and all of a sudden I realize I'm hearing the same service I heard a month ago the same scripture the same references and I'm having the same reaction this time I realize it's God and I realized I'd missed it before and um I'm not panicking but I'm so excited that God's actually speaking to me yeah I'm I'm so excited I'm throwing in the towel like it's over I'm gonna serve God and it's going to cost me my family I'm gonna serve God and I don't know where I'm gonna live but God's dealing with my heart and I that night I totally surrendered um I knew Debbie wouldn't accept it her just her whole demeanor of being in the space was the ivy on the roof yeah it just wasn't working you're the one that pushed for this I was backpedaling so hard and I'm just like what have I done I forced this what have I done this was terrible so it's awesome it's obvious to everyone I mean in this moment that it's happening yeah brother John Andy said I was just like a light bulb just totally lit up so I'm shaking his hand and wherever Cloverdale is be there on Sunday morning and I'm out the door and get in the car and close the door and I just I'm just singing inside and I hear this on the other side and at the moment I said in my heart I've lost Debbie but it's gonna be okay and that could tell I said you may be going to Cloverdale on Sunday but I'm not and I said that's okay me and Rebecca go it'll be fine and I just had the thought in my head yeah right you're taking my child to Canada I didn't say that out loud I needed a bargaining chip on my side so I'm taking Rebecca yeah I am completely running the opposite direction and he is completely surrendered so this starts uh this starts a chain of what you would call Supernatural events um I go home that night and I'm happily reading my Bible I'm reading it like it's brand new like I've like are you kidding me this is really what it says and so I I stay on the couch that night in the living room and sometimes I sleep sometimes I pray sometimes I read and not really concerned that my other half is unhappy upstairs gone to bed yeah I'm laying in the bed still going what have I done I'm seeing my life pass before my eyes now the TV's got to go out now I've got to put on a skirt all the time now you know like all this list of all these things I've got to do just by seeing observing Derek's family and knowing how they live Little House on the Prairie Little House on the Prairie coming to your house yes and now I've got to do that yeah so I wake up the next morning and he's still down on the couch and he's reading the Bible what have I done and I go into our office upstairs and I am still searching and I do still want the truth so I just bow my head right there in the office and I say Lord if this is the truth you need to let me know and he said right back to me just follow your husband okay like this huge weight came off me because suddenly I didn't have to put on a skirt I didn't have to throw out the TV I didn't I didn't have to do anything just go just go with him he's not asking me to do anything just go right okay so I get up from that prayer and I lean over the railing and I said okay we'll come with you on Sunday hey I was happy and I I got a traveling Companion now you got to remember I'm practical yeah he he didn't want to say anything to mess it up so he was just like all right that's great that's it to make this work we're going to Canada it's three hours away so we're just going to make a day of it yeah it'll be like a mini holiday we're going to drive to Canada we have to get we have to get up at six in the morning we have to leave at seven hit a Starbucks on the way get a coffee it'll be nice time not really realizing that God's about to change your life right for real you're in it for a holiday and the Lord says keep coming so we get we we drive up so our first service was on a Friday night Sunday morning arrives we head off to Canada and it we're still MapQuest days that's right nothing's changed there we have a paper map with an address we printed it out on our computer and we pull up to the Canadian border and we've got all of our documents and who's in the car in front of us Brother John brother John follow me follow me [Music] so we followed brother John to church we threw away MapQuest and never looked at it so great because we're driving into another country and we don't know where we are or where we're going and it just took every every worry off so we our first service we look like the world you got to remember we don't look like this we walk in and sit down and pre-service music is playing we're crying this atmosphere is amazing they start singing we're crying even worse and now we're looking around at the people smiling and clapping their hands they've been here so long they've become formal any different look at us we don't even feel this atmosphere that we're feeling oh we didn't know that we couldn't figure out why they weren't crying starting to wash you right they've been washed we didn't know that so we cry the whole first service and as the as the service comes to an end I brother biscoe's preaching it I remember having this fleeting thought of what if you've picked the wrong Church great here I sit amongst people that appear to be pretty nice they look good the preaching sounded good but how do I know well okay the Pentecost thing worked so I better pray so I bow my head and I pray and I'm like God I don't even know what to ask you for the only thing I can think of is like if you could have because I don't know brother Edge brother Ed or brother Biscoe I just said the man preaching if you could have him tell this relate the story of the man from Chicago I don't even know the story but he sent his son out west to find a wife and the stories from childhood I've read the footprints on the sands of time so that's the only thing I can put my finger on and say I remember that if he could tell that story the service finishes and he walks away closes this Bible and walks back towards this chair and my heart sinks because now I'm like I've got to deal with the reality that I've just asked for something and either God didn't answer or he answered brother it turns on his heel and comes back to the podium and tells the story verbatim like every detail of the event so I'm crying all over again I'm so happy because now I know that I'm where I'm supposed to be right and we leave the service and actually ask to meet with brother Ed and explain to him who we are I know we look like we're right out of the world we are and he doesn't he's very gracious the interesting thing is Derek is a military background so he has a very orderly way of doing things and kind of like the Centurion or saying like I know what power you have Jesus you just say the word and this will happen and so he kind of approaches brother Ed in that way and he asked to attend his church I don't want to just come here and just like show up like I want you to know I'm serious I want to be baptized I want to attend your church and I'm serious yeah I'm not going to be a fly by night in out half in the world we're here we're here we're committed for you committed I was more committed yes but I still have questions I have kind of the same question not is this church okay but is this the truth because I've seen Catholic I've seen Seventh-Day Adventists but I know neither of them really had the truth they had partials and I wanted to know that it was the truth so you leave there you gotta get baptized I'm getting I'm getting baptized the next Sunday so spoke to brother Ed and he said that's fine you can get so my days set next week so take us through that yeah so we come up the Saturday before they're having a fellowship I can't remember whose house but they had a fellowship a bunch of people came over and so we're just kind of mingling and I'm hanging out with some of the brothers and Debbie is hanging out with some of the sisters actually so I'm sitting off in the chair just kind of watching everybody just kind of taking everything in and this lady just comes up to me so when are you getting baptized you know where is Kathy Morgan say uh I don't know I know I should say that's the night before you're getting baptized yeah that's the night before so we get to spend the night with um a very nice couple Mike and Debbie gagne brother Ed said that he put us together because we were so so much alike um so we got to spend the night with them and we just sat around for a couple of hours actually before we went to bed and visited about the scriptures and brother Mike is is a phenomenal um student of the scriptures his Sunday school teacher so he's very patient and able to go through different scriptures with us and we kind of came up came across talking about a fleece and um and explained it to Debbie in a way that she grasped it to the level where hey maybe I need to ask the Lord for a fleece so that night you know I'm getting baptized in the morning so brother Mike has two separate rooms so I have a room to myself so I'm able to go and pray and as much as I'd like to and not be disturbed or Not Disturb anybody during the night and Debbie got to think that night so I'm sleeping in the other room with Rebecca and Rebecca has gone to sleep and I'm just laying there so when are you getting baptized ties thinking about that I was like no like what am I so I'm praying and now here I am laying in this bed and I am going to ask the god of creation to give me a fleece who am I I'm a worm this is what I'm telling him I'm a worm I'm nothing and I'm going to ask you for a fleece Lord I'm not worthy I don't know what to ask you but would you please just show me something and that's that's how I leave it so I don't ask for a specific thing but I just humble myself and so we go to church that morning we get up and uh and head off to church and we're driving our vehicle and Mike and Debbie are driving there's we're mapquesting it so you take this turn and when you get there you take that turn and we're in the car we're in the car go ahead and drive uh I'm driving and I'm watching this look at her Bible now I've driven thousands of miles with this girl who gets sick if you hand her a map you could be lost in Chicago you could be lost anywhere if you hand her a map to try and get help she gets sick and I'm like what is she doing why is she reading she's going to get sick great we're going to get to church and she's going to be sick and have to sit in the car on your day on my day she's gonna miss it [Applause] this is just working out great so I'm not really excited but it doesn't say anything because she's reading the Bible so I don't get sick which is a near miracle in itself and and God could have left it at that really but it didn't even dawn on me that I didn't get sick but I didn't get sick for some reason I had the Book of Life on my mind so I mean I've got a little bit of a religious background so I know some words some things and I thought of the book of life and so I just am looking in the back concordance and okay where does it talk about that in the Bible and I'm going back and forth and I'm I'm trying to find um the part in Philippians where it mentions the book of life and it's uh I go back and and I keep going to the wrong scripture three times in a row I go to Philippians 4 8. finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things it doesn't say anything about the Book of Life finally I find it it's actually Philippians 4 3 where it's mentioned and that's when I close the Bible I'm like okay finally found it that's what I was looking for okay done so I put the Bible down and we get to church about 15 minutes later and I'm not sick not sick same atmosphere we're crying it's awesome it's great um brother Ed comes up and and takes the pulpit says open the scriptures to Philippians 4 8. and I've got my Bible and I say and out the door I go on my day I'm disturbing his day I don't know what's happened but this isn't good she just walked out he barely read the scriptures and a few minutes later she comes bustling back in and it's my day I'm really trying to pay attention in this traffic and then I get a tap on my shoulder and one of the deacons I'm like really yeah he hands me a note so it's for sister Debbie so okay so I'm now I'm handing notes in church we definitely didn't do that in the home Church no that was not so I opened the note the note says sister Debbie didn't realize that you were brother Derek's wife yes it would be fine if you got baptized today so then I have to read the note because she hands it to me to read so then I read now I'm happy no we're about so when you left you went to find somebody to tell me you won't get baptized yeah I was gonna find anybody somebody so the man that was just song Waiting is coming around the the uh the foyer and I see him and I'm like he was just up there he must be good so like a good person to talk to so I go up to him and actually lay hands on his lapels of his coat and I'm crying and I said I have to be baptized today and he's like okay sister we'll get you taken care of just calm down like we'll get you'll it'll be fine so okay and then I go back inside so your day became y'all's day my day became our day and I got her back so y'all are baptized in what year this is 2002 July 11th so we've come from meeting in a in a bar in Napa which the odds of you even being there is so now we are in Canada being baptized together yeah yeah God's going to get you no matter where you are yeah he's gonna find you he's going to bring you where he wants you know and I just I love I love how he just in his own way as it related to what you needed and what you needed yeah would reveal the truth to you you know he speaks to us all in different ways and he did it in a way that you needed it so y'all get baptized together and we're gonna go to this next part quickly but y'all are all in we're all in you're all in so this is two thousand you just told me but 2002 you said or three two thousand two thousand two we're 31 years old yeah at this point so brother John and I connect really quick he actually prayed with me that that first service at the end of the service for I don't know 45 minutes or an hour um so we connected really really well and um so they would have the Outreach meetings every month down in in the Tacoma area and so I helped you know came right along with helping arrange the meetings we decided that having a house meeting with ivy on the ceiling maybe not attractive to newcomers that might not be used to this worked for me didn't necessarily uh help for sister Debbie so maybe we could get a building where we could have meetings so um very early on we got into the logistics of of getting a building setting it up every on the Friday nights we went to Friday nights every week right away so I I don't know it was probably two or three months in brother John said I think Eugene was leading songs brother John said um can you sing I said well I've ever picked songs pick songs for other people yeah yeah I can I can lead songs so I started leading songs pretty much right away at the on the Friday night services yeah the Outreach meetings so immediately involved and then you also began to work in in missions as well yeah within a couple of years um it was actually uh after uh I think it was a school Christmas concert that we had for Beast for Bible Christian Academy um I was doing the Because I've been leading Songs in Seattle I did the MC for the school where it was Rebecca was in the school at this point because we moved up to Birch Bay and uh I asked brother Ed to come up and open in prayer and he said well we've been looking for a new song leader and I'd like to introduce you to Our Lady some new our newest song leader so that's how I became the song leader in Cloverdale was at a Christmas concert I didn't see that one coming no that caught me off guard now so go ahead so he so from from there it was about three years um I started working in missions full-time so right along I think brother Tony admin at the time and then I was the missions director until Kim dingwal took over now a lot of people here I say a lot of people quite a few knew from working at the camp yeah up there what year does that take place so that takes place in 2009 yeah David's uh 18 months old at this point we've come through his miraculous healing and uh and the kids are really little Rebecca's like maybe 11 11 at the time so we get asked to go out to the camp and kind of be security so a lot of people's recollection of the campus kind of brother Ron's tied to brother Ron Spencer I I think most most folks know that brother Ed called him and said you'll be our first speaker right we've just bought Mount Baker camp so he speaks that fall and then the next summer where we go out to the camp to look after it for the summer and at the end of the summer I asked him because I think brother John lay had started to come back down here because he was helping out a lot at that time and carrying the Lion's Share the of the workload there and um as it came to be August I said who's the who's the new crew me and my family are going back to Birch Bay and they said oh well we haven't been looking for anybody I said that's pretty sneaky so you're just gonna leave us right here so yes yeah that became a big part of your life and how long did y'all we stayed there 0-9 till um we lived on the grounds for eight years we ran it for 10. now one thing that I didn't realize until they got here we had conversations is I always thought of the campus like a message Camp you know that that's just a couple times a year there was but this was 365. yeah all kind of different groups using this camp and y'all were running it give us just briefly the the scope and size of what y'all were doing yeah so we had a 40 acre Camp uh 35 buildings Debbie was the head chef I was the sales operations and Logistics and the kids were in supporting roles as they grew up um we cooked on average 23 000 meals a year I didn't cook often I did I did burgers in one of those somebody quit the picture of David cooking I mean cooking he's in trouble our average group look at that our average group size was 125 campers but we did have groups like when Cloverdale would come up to like 400 when it was really big of course there was a lot more people helping for that so we served 10 000 campers a year so it was a pretty busy operation we were most days most weeks y'all were there running yeah I I really subscribed to God can give you inspiration beyond what your in your normal scope of understanding what you're able to do and one of those instances um I didn't share with you the other night was we got the opportunity to build a sport court and it's on the side of a mountain so there's not a lot of level areas to play so having a basketball court would be awesome so I got some funding kind of squirreled away and brother Ed was able to pitch in on another large portion of it and then I got a concrete company to commit to a portion of it so I I get a guy with a bulldozer and an excavator to kind of level out a spot and he leaves for the weekend and we're supposed to pour concrete on Tuesday he's not coming back on Monday I think it's Memorial Day weekend and uh the the concrete company stops by on Friday and he's gonna I don't know if you know the term shoot grade I don't know what shoot and grade is and he's going to take the highest point in the lowest point and see what the differential is it's nine inches I said well that's not bad right he said well it's going to cost you a lot of money probably an extra truckload of concrete the sport Court's going to be 125 feet long and 50 feet wide and I'm panicking because an extra truckload or two sounds excessive I don't know couple five six thousand dollars of concrete so I'm I'm really burdened and and under the strain of I don't know how to make this happen before Monday before Tuesday because the concrete guys coming and that contractor with the excavator has left so I get in the van and I drive to Bellingham I didn't send you a picture of the sport court but around a concrete project you generally have boards that support the walls where the concrete is gonna and you've got these posts like every eight or ten feet 12 feet holding up those boards so in my mind I'm driving to Bellingham and I'm thinking about how am I going to level the sport Cork and the Lord dropped a thought into my head of make a grid Square make a grid Square and just pull a string to every post across from each other all the way down the sides and then across the ends and make it squares of 12 foot squares level the squares up to the string and your sport quote will be level like that took a second and on that inspiration by Monday we leveled an entire 125 the con the concrete contractor was blown away he showed up on Tuesday morning saying how how did you here how did you do this I said five gallon buckets in some string and we leveled up maybe he didn't like communicate inspiration to everyone like we want to say we took over a camp I was a mom that cooked for a family of six yeah he worked in missions had sales background we were doing something that we had never done before no one trained us how do I know how much potatoes to cook for 150 people I have no idea we were under constant a constant prayer asking the Lord for inspiration like praying for wisdom with everything we did we needed help like I lived on James 1 5. guaranteed so this lasts how long the whole Camp experience yeah the whole Camp experience really was how many years yeah about 10 10 years and eight of those were on on surrounds we live on grounds yeah in the mountains now we're getting closer and closer to your arrival here yeah 2020 comes 2020 comes and Washington state was probably up there well the the West Coast they shut everything down like if you were a venue if you had any more than two people show up at any one time like that was not permitted so the camp closed like immediately all of our groups canceled of course we dealt with all churches all churches were closed so um the opportunity to make Revenue completely shut off so I I actually laid myself off in uh in April of 2020. now we we can't go past this without mentioning somewhere right before this yeah you start roasting coffee yeah Kind of a Funny Hobby like going back to my sales World I'd been introduced to coffee and we drink a lot of coffee and I told Debbie I said you know if I could just roast my own you know that would just be that would be the cat's meow you know if I could just roast my own coffee so she found this little uh toaster oven kind of a toaster that you can roast six or eight ounces of coffee beans in at a time and I thought I'd hit the big time so that was that was literally the extent of what we thought was going to be our our roasting coffee for you yeah yeah and then we we moved off we moved off of the camp because I kind of I have this I have this underlying feeling in 2016 2017. that a 50s Within Reach age-wise and I don't see myself living at camp for another 20 years and retiring you pay your bills right it's a non-profit there's not like a big retirement program for anybody I've got a young family we're not in church very much um I need to I need to move off ground so I met with the board and um let them know what we were thinking and how we could make this all pencil and make it work so we did we bought a house in Blaine in uh the end of 2016 very very nice place and the Lord really helped us out a lot so we set up this little tiny coffee roaster in the back shed you know so I could have coffee on them on the weekends and I could roast coffee and somehow a neighbor found out that we have this little coffee roasting thing going and asked for four pounds and it took us like eight hours to roast this coffee on this little tiny thing I'm like this isn't gonna work I said hey this is a great opportunity I know we don't have a lot of money but we should buy a bigger roaster so we took the next couple of months and we found a bigger roaster that roasted three pounds at a time and that was that was our next you know cat's meow moment so you start roasting coffee thinking possibly another Revenue stream yeah yeah this could this could supplement the offset maybe some of the camp time so when we're not busy at the camp I could stay home roast coffee and start building up some business in that regard and so Debbie showed somebody the coffee and they loved it well they own an espresso stand well an espresso stand uses a lot of coffee and now I'm looking at sitting at the coffee roaster for eight hours a day two three days a week I I do that I have a camp to run need a bigger coffee roaster absolutely it's just natural it makes sense so we started looking for a bigger coffee roaster and I mean the it would take time to tell the entire story but miraculously we get the coffee roaster that I have now roast 25 pounds at a time and so we set that up here in in the shop in late 2019 uh mid-2019 mid-2019 not knowing that within six months covid was going to hit and shut everything down but at the same at the same time covet is hitting another Coffee Roasting Company comes up for sale kind of the Lord is really preparing like he's he's creating a path at this time yeah I get a phone call from our competitors customer who lets us know that the competitor passed away and their business is closing and could we Supply coffee to them well I'm not thinking about coffee for the to supply them I'm thinking our competitors closing their business and Derek needs to go talk to them so we try to call him try to call him can't get a hold of him so finally I'm just like you know let's jump in the car and drive over there and see what it's all about so it takes 40 minutes or so 45 minutes and we pull in and the doors cracked open there's hardly nobody around per se it's in an industrial park and so we walk in the door and this ladies at a at the back of the warehouse packaging coffee and she said I'll be with you in just a minute it's my last bag and I said oh that's okay I was just popping in to see who's running the show oh no we closed I said closed she's like this is literally the last bag and we've closed ever ever we're done I said who owns it and she told me who it was and she said but she's not taking any calls and I said who's close to her and so she told me her dad the lady's dad so I right there on the spot reached out to him and within a couple of days we drew up papers and I bought her out to pay her out over the next two years because covet had hit their sales had disappeared all the cafes the restaurants everything everybody that they sold to had stopped buying coffee so they thought they didn't have anything um so I told her well if if nothing comes of it you aren't out anything but if I start selling a lot of coffee I'm willing to pay on everything I sell so I did I was able to pay her for the next two years as a widow and she did pretty well so we got good in a very short period of time you went full-blown coffee business yeah like it there was almost no transition between the camp and coffee like it just it just Blended one right into the other Coffee started up in a major way yeah now we're getting to the place where we're gonna we're gonna have to bring this down and wrap this up and I know we've been here a minute and but I don't want to move on without the opportunity because you mentioned it briefly about David's healing and maybe we can't give it as much time as we wanted to but but just for the for the sake of it I think it's a great testimony what was it he was born with congenital hyper insulin let's explain that briefly his pancreas never stopped producing insulin so where it's like the opposite of diabetes so when I took him to the emergency room after one of his seizures they tested his blood sugar and it was Zero so that's where he functioned so he was put on medications round-the-clock care checking on him every two hours trying to keep him from having seizures trying to keep his blood sugar up and weeks at Children's Hospital yeah lots of time in the hospital children's hospital and basically you get to the place to where your only option is take out the pancreas the pancreas and intentionally make him a diabetic yes that's your only option because pancreas won't turn off right yes so y'all end up in is it Philadelphia yeah Children's Hospital Philadelphia and it is the night before the surgery where they're going to remove his pancake and they actually say to you it's gonna be better to take diabetes home with you or something yeah so we met the research scientist the night before when we had to sign papers for David to lose his pancreas and the research scientist looked me in the eye and he said you want to take home diabetes you don't want to take home hyperinolism and I said I don't want to take home either right yeah he said I understand but you need to sign the paper so David's 10 months old at this point at this point it's been nothing but Health struggles and health troubles yeah you're sitting there it's got to be tough signing papers going I'm going to make him a diabetic but at the same time well you realize lesser of two evils types you realize that the struggle is not going to end because now you've got to maintain insulin and there's still medication involved and so it's not doesn't really feel better so it so that night you go to Google this is the night before the surgery and just tell them what you come across yeah so I had actually searched a lot all through throughout David's sickness because you're looking for anything you can to try to help your child but that night I start searching again for Alternatives like there's got to be another there's got to be something else and I come across a medical journal where someone had had pancreatic cancer and the doctor did a procedure called a ruin Y which it you know the pancreas looks like this it cuts off the this part of the pancreas it reattaches it somewhere else that's what a ruined why would be that's the easiest way to explain it so I find this online and I just close my computer and I say that's got to be it that's got to be the answer and that's it I just we go to sleep and the next day we take David down for surgery they medicate him and the nurses take him away and the surgeon comes in the surgeon is one of two people in the entire world that work on the condition that David had so there's him in Seattle or not Seattle but Philadelphia Children's Hospital there's another surgeon that's at Great Ormond Street in London England two men in the world that do this David is case number 104 in Children's Hospital Philadelphia like in history in history yeah at this point he's number 104. so the surgeon walks into the room in a suit very powerful man like he's he's the guy and he says do you have any other questions I haven't even asked him any questions I haven't met him before so I said yes if you have the opportunity will you do a row and Y on David's pancreas and he looks up at the corner of the room and he says yep turns on his heel and walks out the door at that moment when he looks up to the corner of the room I look down at his hands and I just pray not his hands Lord but yours and that's it he walks out the door that's the last time we see him never saw him again and you're wondering what in the world to ruin why yeah it was Derek did he turned to me right after he walked out he said I ruined what what did you just ask him to do I said I don't really know but I found this thing on Google let's remember that I got my GED I did not even graduate high school I have no medical background that was inspiration from the Lord and he does it he does it successful yeah so he um he resects David's pancreas they slice until they take out the part that's producing insulin non-stop they reattach his pancreas down below so that it still produces digestive enzymes it still produces insulin it still functions just like it would have if it was still in one part but now it's in two parts and now because of that other children who have the same disease it's actually listed in the pamphlet as an option yes yeah yeah because of what happened that's awesome yeah yeah that's an incredible story so didn't you say like immediately his blood sugar leveled up yes he came out of surgery he wasn't even awake and his blood sugar was completely normal and I said he's not on any medication right now like for the condition that she said no no he hasn't been on that since last night he's not on anything no he's not on anything his blood sugar was 70. it was normal we'll praise the Lord yeah the procedure was so new when we were checking out and you're you're going through you know all the things within the nurse that checks you out right and um Debbie said can you see in there where it says definitively how much of David's pancreas was removed and she said oh it was like 95 and Debbie's like no no um it should be more like 15 and we're trying to see the the notes the surgeons notes you know because he dictates and um she's like no no it would have been it would have been 95 here see right here oh oh that's just that's not biologically possible I don't think they could do that and Debbie's like what did they do he only has 15 removed so he ended up with only so it was such a new thing yeah even the the staff there was like no it didn't make sense yes we thank God that you found that medical journal on Google that's right that's incredible yes so I wanted us to tell that story and then bring us back it's 20 20. yeah you're no longer able to go to church yeah a lot of people all over the world [Music] but it was it got to the point where in Canada it lasted even longer you weren't able to go things were shut down yes you begin streaming here and there a lot of people were streaming different things and God's really doing things in your home at this time yes dealing with your children and yeah drawing you closer and just opening hearts and they stream or y'all stream the Oklahoma Youth Camp yeah we um I think we've got a link for the Oklahoma meeting so we started streaming those those were awesome I mean I don't know if there it had been it probably a year but since there were any kind of camps really anywhere right and um so the end of the Oklahoma meetings and then I think brother Andrew Glover came here Donald Winston preached and so we streamed that and uh Lily said Dad whatever we've got to do you've got to get us to their Easter meetings they're having they're having camp at church for Easter we've got to be there and in the back of my mind I'm like okay covid flying the tickets the cost of everything is just going to be insurmountable like we're not going to be able to put that together and um but I said yes that can change a lot can change but I which the kids know a lot can change and they've seen me change before you know oh we're we're going to do vacation in a couple of months and a lot changes we don't go on vacation so that potential disappointment has kind of ever been set up and happened in the past and I felt like I told Debbie I said I don't think we can afford to fail I think we've got to figure out how to pull it off so let's see how many miles we've got so I scrounge credit card miles and miles from bonuses of this thing and that thing we're really sure like we're only halfway there and I said didn't you sign up for a for Alaska Airlines card or something like that some time ago just to get the miles and you get the bonus miles and um yeah I think it took us a while to find the card she sat on hold for like two hours two hours yeah and finally the guy he's like frustrated that this person's still on hold it's not just going away so he's like ma'am um you don't even have your password to your account to even verify that you have any miles she goes I know that's why I'm asking you he's like please hold so he puts her on hold again he comes back he's like all right it's all set it's here's your account here's your password and everything and she's like well how many miles are on there and he's like um looks like 105 000. so it's like a hundred thousand miles on there I think he just put them on there credit [Music] so here we miraculously have enough miles for all of us to come for sixty dollars sixty dollars each no total all six of us like ten dollars a person we've flew to Louisiana praise the Lord yeah yeah and then I mean there's a cost to stay like that could run you a thousand fifteen hundred bucks for a week because we figure if we're going to come down here for the Easter meetings you might as well at least enjoy it and stay for a couple of days maybe a week would be nice we haven't had a vacation in a while but it's going to be expensive so I let brother Timothy know that we were coming in um you know the kids are looking at airbnbs and hotels and you know we're the dollar signs are getting higher to the point where it's starting to feel like we need to push back here a little bit and brother Timothy said what if I got you a place to stay for the whole week for nothing I said that's better than 60. so we came and it was it was amazing it was we I mean you haven't been in church for a while and you see God dealing with your hearts I mean just from sitting here for a few minutes you remember what happened to me when I first gave my heart to the Lord and I'm seeing that same level of reaction happening in my kids and uh that's what you want like you can have a lot of things but if you can have that what wouldn't you do amen that's right so we went home from the Easter meetings very impacted um by Church by the People by what we had seen God already doing in our lives the way that he'd set up things for us we're walking down the main street of Minden and a guy who we know now um but you didn't know then we didn't know then uh he stopped us on the street like we're walk on a Saturday main Street's pretty quiet and he strikes up a conversation with us asks what we do ask it for visiting and he said yeah we're visiting from the Pacific Northwest oh are you moving to Minden we're not moving to Minden it's hot here moving to Minden we live in the Pacific Northwest it's cool he's like well what do you do I said well I'm a coffee roaster oh we need a coffee roaster here we need a coffee matter of fact we need a coffee shop in our town we don't even have a good coffee shop in this town if you moved here you could roast coffee and have a coffee shop I mean he's setting it all I don't know him so we get in the car and I'm like this is a little weird I mean this guy's asking us if we're moving to Minden that's so he comes back and knocks on the window he said don't give up on us we need you in Minden and I just thought that is really strange well I've told other people that story and Mike wise in this town is not known to be outgoing not known to be one that would approach anybody and talk to them just out of the blue so I felt like that was look you look back now I was very taken back by it because we're from the Pacific Northwest we don't talk to people unapproached we observe from a distance and if somebody waves at you on the you know like you're driving down the street and somebody waves you're like what are they doing do I know you that's the specific Northwest anyway we were feeling we were feeling definitely a pull to go we didn't know where the Lord was leading us to go but we were feeling that and I can't give you a real reason why but it was happening and we had tried to go to Virginia we had tried to go to brother Ron's and those doors closed quickly hard twice in a row and we're like okay and so that's yeah you know when you're coming to a season but you don't know what it holds yeah you know it brother Timothy has preached on seasons and changes and when you're coming to Spring you know that there's going to be leaves on the trees but you don't really know what they're going to look like until they actually develop you don't know what the blossoms are really going to look like and so we felt the season changing but really didn't know what it was going to develop into and as we went through those those first Oklahoma camp meetings and God moving on the on the young people and and then coming here um we've really started to see the picture developing and the way that God allowed us to come and some Supernatural things that he did for us when we went back home um really just showed us that um this is where we needed to be and we got to be with sister Kathy again I mean a little piece of home little piece of home well thank y'all yeah so much for sharing and you know churches are built on good families strong families and through the years we we've had that here strong family strong foundations and and we're just thankful that another piece was added and that hopefully that y'all have been as blessed to be here as we've been to have you here and what I'd like is for the rest of the Paris family to come join their parents up here on the stage right now and I know they've been here for for two years I'm going to get out of the way because I'm not family per se we just want to say thank you [Applause] you can go okay we could go too right you're free yes no brother Aaron hasn't dismissed oh okay no we're gonna let you be dismissed thank you why don't you give them a hand again foreign all right so if we I know everybody's been sitting for a while I hope you really enjoyed that time and hey man so many wonderful things that the Lord has done Sister Abigail do you mind helping me with that um with that one if we could all just stand together and man I think it's just wonderful to hear that no matter where you are no matter where you're going if you're a seed of God he's gonna find you hey man he's gonna hey man he's gonna find his own if you know this song just sing it with me when there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see he will make a way for me and he will be my guy hold me closely to his eye with love and strength for each new day he will make a way he will make a way we'll sing it again now and God Will Make A Way where there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see he will make a way for me my God hold me closely to his eyes to me [Music]
