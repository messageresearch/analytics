here today for you and we say God bless you and welcome here today in the name of the Lord Jesus if you'll turn with me to Genesis 18 verse 20 I just want to thank you for your prayers while we were away with them Edward Johnson City dedicating brother Donnie Reagan's church had a glorious time together with with them and the Saints there and so uh this next Sunday I'm going to be up in Newfoundland and then fly from there over into New Brunswick and uh having meetings there two weekends in a row while I'm up in that part of Canada that's about as far north east as you can go so far that you know their time they change it to where it's not on the hour with us but uh you know like right now it's nearly 12 o'clock it would be like 12 30 you know on the half hour where whatever time they are there several hours of away so in a way I I would appreciate your prayers we we don't go just to gratify ourselves we we go to try to minister to the body of Christ as I told you before our um our real ambition is is to see each one prepared for the coming of the Lord and we can help a little church somewhere a place somewhere or a group of people somewhere wherever they are to strengthen the body of Christ that's what we want to do amen so God bless you as our ministers will be busy this summer uh just going in and out different places there's many many needs everywhere keep them in prayer I would appreciate that please keep me in prayer Genesis chapter 18 verse 20 and the Lord said because the crying of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the Cry of it which is come unto me and if not I will know and the men turned their faces from thence and went towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord and Abraham Drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked per Adventure there'd be 50 righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the 50 righteous that are therein that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the Earth do right and the Lord said if I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city then I will spare all the place for their sakes and Abraham answered and said behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord which him but dust and Ashes per Adventure there lacked five of the 50 righteous will thou destroy all the city for the lack of five and he said if I find there 40 and 5 I will not destroy it and he spake unto him yet again and said for adventure there be 40 found there and he said I will not do it for 40's sake and he said unto him oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak for adventure there will shall be thirty be found there and he said I will not do it if I find 30 there and he said behold I've taken upon me to speak unto the Lord for adventure the B20 found there and he said I will not destroy it for 20's sake and he said oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak but this yet but this once per Adventure 10 shall be found there and he said I will not destroy it for Tim's sake and the Lord went his way and as soon as he left communing with Abraham and Abraham returned to his place God bless you can be seated I'm going to speak to you this morning on the power of an intercessor and after the wonderful promise of restoration which would include Abraham and Sarah being restored to youth again and so they could have the promised son and after seeing the supernatural display of the son of man in his ministry the angel of God Discerning Sarah's heart and after giving to him the mysteries of God and and revealing to Abraham things that would have otherwise been hidden Abraham was not satisfied with his salvation and his restoration only but seeing the judgments that is about to be false Sodom he begins to intercede and begins to plead for the Salvation of Sodom and I I really think it was for the sake of his nephew lot that he had something in mind you know and so he he would first start with 50 and then 45 and then 30 and then 20 and finally down to 10 he just whatever he wanted to make sure that his nephew lot and his family was saved and I think that that is to be the desire of real Christians we don't want to see nobody lost because that's really God's desire you know he he was not willing that then he should perish and even he will show his long suffering as in the days of Noah to to try to bring in every person and and give every person an opportunity we serve a merciful god he's a god rich in Mercy I know in a day in a time where men have have misunderstood the breach and try to make God a god that is no longer a cry or Christ no longer on The Mercy Seat I tell you I beg the difference with that I believe there's more Mercy in this age than any age that there's ever been because again as brother Brandon would preach as one of the last of his sermon that God is rich in Mercy but anyway um you know here we see Abraham entering into a Ministry of intercession he was not just willing to let the world go by and Sodom burn and everybody'd be destroyed without imploring God for the lost for those who would be lost in the fire and he wanted to see them saved the Bible said in James 5 16 that he he says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and so there is much power in Believers intercession for one another you see um as he as brother Branham told us and believe in God he said there that's the reason he said the prayer face shall save the sick that's the individual's prayer the effects of fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much I know if you only knew that in your hand Christ gave us the authority with his name being Christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it even changes everything it'll change the mind of God it did do it after death was pronounced to a man he prayed and and God told the prophet go back and tell him I heard him and so he said so their their prayer and he said he instructed us hold on now we know it doesn't literally change God's mind numbers 23 19 says that God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent for at the sad and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good so you see this is this is God's nature he he cannot change his mind about his word he can't go back on his word he must do what he said as Samuel spoke of him as the the glory of Israel that changes One of Israel does not lie or change his mind for he is not a man that should change his mind so God is forever the changeless one of Israel the counsel of the Lord stands forever since the book of Psalms and malachite says and speaks of him as I am Jehovah and I change not but do you see it is that God will use you through intercession to change circumstances in order to fit his plans and God wanted a lot saved amen God wanted lot saved he didn't want him to be lost and Abraham responded to God's Desire by interceding on his behalf and and and and and through Abraham's intercession then the lot was saved let's look at the Book of James chapter 5 and verse 13 and if you'll put it upon the board for us ought to see the screen is there any among you that is Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord you see there is this prayer of intercession as it goes on in verse 15. it says and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he hath committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your fault one to another pray one for another that you may be healed and the effects of fervent prayer of a righteous man Avail as much so you can see the instructions of God you know pray for one to one for one another that you may be healed and then he tells you that that the prayer of the righteous man is effective when it's fervent amen when it when it approaches God you know with a with a right attitude and with fervency and believe in his promise now the devil don't want us interceding for the needs of God's people that's very plain it's incred incredible what we have to defend this day like I've already mentioned you know Christ having left the emergency seat of course he hasn't he is still there he ever liveth to make an intercession on the behalf of those that has need we can boldly come to the throne of grace to find help in the time of need you know he is there again the high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmity and right now his office is the office of the high priest as he intercedes on the behalf and what's the last member of the bride of Christ comes in then he for the Gentiles Mercy is over he leaves the seed of Mercy he takes his bride out of here and judgment comes upon the Earth but you don't have to worry about there not being any Mercy as long as the bride is here she is the very seat of Mercy because she is in touch with The Mercy Seat in heaven now but the devil doesn't want us interceding for the needs of God's people and it's incredible today what I find we have to defend anymore you know um you know it just says there's teachings against preachers and the preaching of the word there are those of opposed prayer lines and laying on of hands and you know evidently Satan don't want God's people ministered to hey man because he knows and Minister unto them he's going to be cast out you know and and yes I I do recognize that brother Branham told us that laying on our hands is a Jewish tradition but so is married to a Jewish termite tradition so it's fasting Jewish tradition anointing with oil is a Jewish tradition praying over the food is our Jewish traditions all of those are Jewish Traditions even communion is a the Passover which is a Jewish tradition so you see you see he simply speaks of the Gentile Roman Centurion which who said to Jesus there's no need to come to my house for a physical test just speak the word and my servants I live and Jesus called that great faith and brother Branham certainly encouraged the church to to anticipate the spoken word but he never ever ever forbids laying on of hands and back to the matter is I'm a personal witness when I sat as a young boy in brother bannon's meeting in his last public meeting in in other than the the um the church there in Tucson but in the last campaign that he would have hearing which was which in Shreveport we had a open prayer line and there in that prayer line I watched him as they laid hands upon them one after the other by the way in that meeting also he had an altar caller amen and he would say he said I believe in old-fashioned altar calls because he said God still moves in them amen I still believe in those things I realize yeah maybe the methodists abused them maybe maybe somebody else abuse it but they're still the truth there's still things that God moves in there's still things that we we see God using to to bring in the loss and the sick and the dying now the book of Hebrews chapter 6 it less it lists the elementary or foundational doctrines of Christ and and these doctrines are listed in there in Hebrews six and one as repentance from dead works of Faith toward God uh and of instructions about Washings and the laying on of hams and the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment so we do believe in all the fundamental doctrines don't we so why do we believe in laying on our hands what is wrong with that truly it's a doctrine of Christ for in as much he told us to baptize in his name he also commissioned us to lay hands on the sick saying that when we interceded for them in that manner they shall recover amen so it was a practice not only in the Old Testament but it's also a practice in the New Testament Amen in both covenants it was there it's going to be here until the duration amen the old man the Old Testament shows how that laying on of hands would would come to be used in the New Testament Church Jesus which was originally went laying on the hands was for the passing of blessing um to formally recognize a leader so in numbers 8 and 10 he would bring the Levites together before the Lord and said when you bring him the Levites before the Lord the people of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites so you can see here it was a part of commissioning so laying on our hands is for commissioning so that so then again in numbers 28 or 27 18 God instructs his Moses to lay his hand on Joshua to formally recognize him as the new leader of a Nation so he said take Joshua the son of none and a man to whom is the spirit and lay the hand upon him so you see laying on hands was an act of recognition and a passing on a blessing to those that God had chosen now in Timothy Chapter 5 um first Timothy Chapter 5 he warns Timothy to lay hands on no man suddenly now in doing this he is not warning against praying for the sick but rather to be careful who you ordain and who you give positions to in the church so let's just look at it for a moment so we can just kind of settle this and clear the air and go forward because I believe we're people who are called to intercession Amen to pray for the sick is part of our commission amen now first Timothy 5 21 I charged thee before God um and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that I observe these things without preferring one another doing nothing by partiality lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other men's sins and keep thyself pure now this has nothing to do with praying for the sick this has something to do it's with rather ordaining and commissioning elders and church officials so he says don't do nothing hastily be careful when you put men into position amen because again when you when you put men in position you become identified with them because you recognize them officially and they become an official representative of the church so you know if you've done this hastily and this man goes into sin hey you're caught with it yeah you're branded with it now so in it it's an admission and a warning not to be too hasty about putting men into positions now if you keep it in context with what he's saying let's go to verse 17. the elders who direct the Affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor especially those whose work is preaching and teaching now I'm reading another translation but you get it it said for the scripture says do not muzzle an ox while it's treadling that treading out this the Grain and the worker deserves his wages do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it be brought by two or three Witnesses but those Elders who are sinning you are to reprove before reprove before everyone so that others may take warning and then he says I charge you in the sight of God energy and of Christ Jesus neglect angels to keep these instructions without personality and do nothing out of favoritism do not be Hasty young laying on our hands do not share in the sins of other and keep yourself pure so maybe a better translation would be it's don't give your seal of approval to People Too hastily you see it's very possible to lay hands on people too suddenly too quickly to give them a seal of approval before we really know them or in part authority to them before they're ready for it and this was a foolish mistake that that will often produce painful consequences in the Amplified it says like this do not be it do not hurry to lay hands on anyone ordaining and approving someone from Ministry or an office in the church or in reinstating expelled offenders see all that's within context of what he's talking about and therefore sharing the sins of other keep yourself free from sin so Paul's warning to Timothy to lay your hands on no man suddenly has nothing to do with praying for the sick but rather Clausen into him not to put their seal of approval on on to someone making or import imparting authority to a person you see you let me just make it clear you do not need to be fearful to share in their sins by praying for someone who might have hidden sins but the church's reputation can be tainted with men who are in office who are living sinful lives and we've all been hurt very badly by the sinful action of preachers of deacons that we were associated with so Paul warns us don't ordain anyone hastily and he's reiterating the same advice that he just gave two chapters later or earlier rather in first Timothy 3 and 6 concerning the office of a bishop or a pastor and he warned he's not to be a novice not to be a newcomer not to be untrained not to not to be put in the office of of a pastor and he and he he doesn't have the experience of being a Christian and the reputation of being a real child of God with a with a with a record behind him he's not to be a novice unless to be lifted up with pride and fall in the condemnation of the devil moreover he must have good report of them which are without not only within the church but even in the even in the community around you we don't you know you don't want someone to be a bishop or leader or pastor of a church and he's done uh nefarious business deals out there and cause all kinds of trouble in the community and you know sin on his life and bad reputation because that affects the church now so again he said he said he must be of a good report of them which are out let's see fall into reproaching the snare of the devil so this one this subject is not mourning Timothy about the laying on of hands of the sick but be very careful when you are commissioning others and this charge comes from a whole section about elders honoring the good discipline the bad and and for When leaders like Paul or Timothy or others in the church formally lay their hands on someone for uh to to us them into a Ministry or into a new calling they're putting their seal of approval on them and in some way they share even in their fruitfulness or in their failures amen so you see when we ordain a man to go out and preach the gospel we are putting the weight of the whole church behind him we're playing we're we're giving him our recommendation we're sending him out Amen to represent us in the Gospel of Jesus Christ so you see laying on her hands then it's very we've got to be very careful not to do this hastily and put people in positions that they're not supposed to be in but he's not talking about me real slow when you pray for somebody or be careful about praying for people because if you pray and you lay hands on them and their sin their sinners then that's their sins come back on you that's a much a bunch of malarkey and baloney as you can imagine otherwise we're about to be we better not just pray for anybody I can't even pray for Aaron he might be a secret Sinner and whatever he's doing might come back on me I can't pray for you because whatever you're doing might come back on me you might be cursed by God and who knows I'm I might be trying to take the girl so nobody prays for nobody forget about laying on hands you just don't pray you see we come to a point where you bind the hand of God where you stop the work of the Living God who commission us cast out devils lay hands on the set they shall recover do this with boldness because you're an intercessor who can come boldly before the tone of Grace and by helping the time of need so you see laying on the hand's ends like anointing with oil or fasting or external rituals like communion or or water baptism none of that is none of that is Magic it's a means of Grace and it come it accompanies words of of commendation and you know and Collective prayers of the elders and the Saints for those that believe and like baptism the the laying on of hands is is an official recognition a recognition it's sort of like um an initiating right so Paul warns us don't be hasty and putting people in positions but laying on the hands was not only for ordaining one to an office or for The Healing The Sick but also for imparting the Holy Ghost for those in the upper room you see the Holy Ghost came spontaneously and 120 were filled with great power and spoke in a Heavenly language is that right at the house of Cornelius a gentile they received the Holy Ghost as Peter was was preaching the word and it was not without emotion or without feeling for they spoke in tongues and prophesied in the book of Acts chapter 8 the Samaritans who were a mixed Heritage of Jews and and Gentiles believed and embraced the truth of the word of God so they sent Peter and John to come and pray for them and the Bible said and they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost now you can look at that here these people had believed they had embraced the message and yet didn't have the Holy Ghost right so embracing the message of embracing the message and confessing the belief in the truth was all that was needed then they would not have needed Us in for Peter and John to come and intercede for them by laying on the hands wouldn't have been necessary again in Ephesus the followers of John the John the Baptist were told of Christ and his resurrection and the coming of the Holy Ghost and they had been that were then baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in 19 Verse 6 of Acts and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied so you can see this is exactly what happened you see Paul Come laid his hands on them that's why that we come around the altar a lot of times and we have people seeking the Holy Ghost and you come and pray with them and intercede for them amen lay in your hands upon them and calling on God and say Lord fill this person with the Holy Ghost amen now again let me go back over that it can come spontaneous as you hear the word it can come spontaneous and nothing was even being preached it was just in one mind and one Accord was sitting there waiting and the spirit of God fell in 120 received the Holy Ghost or it can come by laying on the hands you see you can't put God in a box now brother Branham gave an illustration I think that is really important to understand and then the sermon Bob and Kelly had brother Branham called a prayer line and there he asked ministers to come and pray with him over the sick and he did this pretty often in his ministry you know that if you listen to any tapes because he said I don't want your faith built into an evangelist I want you to have your faith built in your own Pastor he's the man that's going to lead you out from here so he would get other ministers to come and pray with him and and he would say now form a double line and he expressed his appreciation for the ministers and and in doing so he said I'm going to tell you it makes me proud of my heart grateful to find Servants of God that will stand before the people and say I'm a witness of this gospel too so he would call for preachers who also believed in Divine Healing to come join with him in the prayer line for the needs of the people amen and then he said I'm glad makes me proud in my heart to find Servants of God who come and be identified with Divine Healing and prayer for the sick and will stand on the platform with me to pray for these so they're men of God every one of them that's called of God every man called of God's commission to lay his hands on the sick and they shall recover how many believe that then then how you going to fail with from getting to pass through an arch like this so you said you ever notice Solomon built the temple listen close when you enter the door what happened there were Angels carved of olive wood with the wings tipping across and every worshiper coming to the holy seat come right down across the tips of these angels Wings right down to the mercy seat right down to the altar you know the order of Solomon's Temple and he said now what an angel is a messenger get a dictionary and find out what an angel means some of them's Heavenly Messengers some of them are Earthly Messengers that God dwells in to bring his Earthly message amen I'm sitting right behind me is an Earthly angel amen we call him Aaron Oglesby but he's an Earthly Angel a messenger of God commissioned of God to to what he said they're standing there with their they are these are messengers angels of the Lord Messengers to you and they're standing there with their hands out to obey What God Says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now I'm going to give you just an illustration brother Aaron come here I need another angel so we're going to make a double line so I want you to stand right here William come up yeah you you're William you stand right there you're the sick one you're approaching the angels it's a prayer line these are Earthly Angels not Heavenly angels angel means messenger now then Aaron and I are going to be lifting our hands to anoint you and to pray for you so you step forward and as you do you're coming come on step forward you are coming under the Ark of the angel's wings and we lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Hallelujah that's exactly the way brother Madam taught it Angels standing there coming under the Ark of the angel's wings and he says each of these men have just as much anointing to lay hands on the sick as I do and every Minister touched him and they can touch them as they go by now listen to the instructions of the Prophet lay your hands anoint them or they have why touch them because we are following the example of Jesus who commissioned us to do it you know Jesus most common practice in his in healing is to touch it's also described as laying on her hands you know to be healed let's just look at a few of Matthew 8 and 2 catch up with me there Matthew 8 and 2 and lo there came a leper and worshiped him saying Lord If thy wilt make me clean remember he didn't ever say uh let me think about this it was the will of God to heal and Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean so here's one of the few times it was every question in the Bible whether or not it was God's will to heal and Jesus answered positively I will be thou clean and he touched him and and healed him now when Peter's mother-in-law was sick the Bible said he touched her hand she's sick with a fever she touched her hand and the fever left until there was two Blind Men in Matthew chapter 9 he touched her eyes and said according to your faith be it unto you so that's another key when you're coming to a prayer line he didn't according to my faith I believe but it's going to be according to your faith what do you believe amen you accept the promise of God so according to your faith be it unto you and the same thing in Matthew 20 Jesus had compassion on two Blind Men and he touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him and Mark says chapter 7 the deaf man had he also had an impediment of speech he put forth his fingers into his ears and he touched his tongue think of that here here Jesus what did he do he with touch laying hands on the sick in this case he touched their ears sticking his fingers in their ears touched his tongue and he spoke clearly you see then he commissioned us as he was leaving to preach to baptize to cast out Devils to bind serpents as Moses did and to lay hands on the sick so Matthew Mark 16 verse 15 this is the Great Commission remember this is only given to those to whom the word has been opened to so the opening of the word entitles us to the to the position to finish the Great Commission is that right so if you're in the opening of the word and you don't believe in laying on the hands you ain't in the opening the word the book's still close to you you're still over here in denominational Darkness look what he said in verse 15 he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature I don't care how many tells me Don't Preach no more just push play I'm going to do what the Bible said what Jesus commissioned me to do I'm going to preach [Applause] I don't care if it's a popular opinion of the day or not I'm going to do what the Bible says I'm going to preach he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned so notice he commissions preaching baptism and signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues well we don't believe in that anymore oh yes True Believers do amen they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick with a promise they shall recover so in the book of Acts once Jesus ascended into heaven his Apostles in effect become his hands I want to make something clear to you Jesus cannot come to this earth not at this time he said well what about the Rapture no we meet him in the era his feet never touched the ground until he touches the Mount of Olives and the Cleveland too that's when he comes back with the Saints at the battle of Armageddon so the word keeps Jesus from coming here he cannot come that's what brother random said he cannot if you would say well you know here's male scars and look the long robe in the long hair he said any impersonator can do that that's not Jesus that's not how we look for Jesus in this day now Jesus is here but in the form of the Holy Spirit he sent his Spirit to anoint man to preach the gospel and to fulfill this Great Commission that we just read about amen preach baptize lay hands on the sick cast out Devils speak with new tongues all of these things this is what he does in his church now so he cannot come to Earth he has to use your hands now here I'm talking about an intercessor I'm coming back to Abraham for a moment and I want to stop here just a moment in the midst of this and review you know here here Abraham comes right here at this point and he says you know he said shall I hide from Abraham what I'm going to do and he reveals to him the mystery he tells him about the burden of Sodom he does all of this on there God did not do anything on Earth until he spoke with Abraham then he interceded as Abraham pleaded for him to do it so Abraham's Abraham's intercession as a priest moved God to save lot now God was going to save lot but he needed Abraham to intercede you see because he had he had a prophet on Earth he had a vessel on Earth through which he was going to do his work through somebody help me preach now amen you see we are heirs and Joint heirs with Christ so brother Madam tells us he says you see if you were in the foreknowledge of God you are part of God and you're becoming becoming a part of God and the only way you can be a Son of God or daughter of God you have to be a part of God and God is not complete without you so if unless there are men praying God can't work unless there have been Inner City God can't move unless listen he's not going to come and lay hands on you no he filled me and others with the spirit to do that and for us to refuse to do that is to thwart the work of God to refuse to give our hands to him to use now I want you to think of this because he said he is incomplete without you so you know he has them to use your hands he cannot come here he cannot walk down these aisles and come lay hands on you but he has sons of God that are here through whom he works now I I want to just kind of go over a couple of things right here you know John John Wesley said God does nothing but an answer to prayer so I want you to understand the power of intercession if you want God to move start praying Abraham don't be satisfied with one prayer if you don't think he got it that first time go again come on Amen if you don't think you got through that type of go again keep going until you're sure and you're satisfied that you're going to get the answer you see brother Benham told us and see not out with this shot said we become too much like Hawks and not like eagles so he said you know there again we voltarized down and we're too soft for a prayer meeting can't pray five minutes anymore you see because part of our work here on the Earth is to him to call to bring God's power through intercession to work upon the Earth there's power in prayer there's power in your prayer you know Abraham you're the heir to the Earth and God did not do anything until he comes and consults or speaks with Abraham and God's not going to move until you start calling for him amen I'm trying to get you to understand you've got a part in this you've got a part to play God Made You heirs together with him right amen so if you're an heir with him you've got a part in this to do oh yes that but there's one interceder but in the inner Seasons interceded between God and man that's the man Christ Jesus yes I get that he's the only one worthy to take our petitions and bring them into the presence of God but you are the man you are the man who comes to and women that comes to Jesus Christ as a man who understands your human frailties listen that's why his approach there in the heavens is not as Spirit God no man can come to spirit of God the Father except by Me Jesus said so you see our approach to God the Avenue that we have is through another man and that man is Christ Jesus because he don't our relationship with him is not like an invisible God that you know never was human never knew our problems never knew how they felt to be sick didn't know how it feels to be betrayed didn't know how it feels to be tempted God came flesh so that we would have an advocate that understands us amen that understands us and we when we call oh Jesus I'm sick he understands he said brother it's him he never had my problem listen when he went to hell he defeated every problem no he never had my headache when he was damaged with crown of thorns jammed on his head there he had the worst headache that they beat him with the rods on the head he knows what it is I have a headache well my back hurts he knows he was on the cross he knows what it means to have a backache while my legs are hurting my feet are hurting he knows what it is so I have feet hurting electric he whether he's suffering It Off so that you can come to him as a priest that understands your condition not a distant God who don't know how it feels to be human but God became human Hallelujah he became human so that you could approach him now brother Branham tells us in a couple of things in Faith and Action he says Jesus looked on the Harvest how many believes he was the lord of the Harvest he looked on the Harvest and said pray ye the Lord the Harvest to sin labors into his Harvest now in other words you ask me just what I know that's got to be done but yet you've got to ask me for it come on when John when John heard him say um I you know behold I come quickly and he makes the last Prayer in the Bible what does he do he responds to the word and said he said even so come Lord Jesus do you know did bride of Christ has got to be making that prayer the last prayer the Bible has got to be the drive of their heart listen things are coming upon us like a trap amen and snap and sat on your freedoms and everything else and the world is these sodomites and these these uh drag queens marching down the streets screaming we're coming after your kids it's not an empty threat I tell you it's not an empty threat but I'll tell you the Bible said that there are those who are going to escape the things that are coming on the earth and will not be caught in the end time trout so the prayer of the Believers got to become even so calm Lord Jesus in other words your attitude about the coming has got to come the same as his your longing has got to meet his longing brother Brandon said do you know that there are some things that we have to do that God cannot do to until we do it he talks about me in the vine and then us the branches and then bearing the fruit he said he furnishes the energy but we've got to do we got to do the job he talks about the Harvest again and he says he could not do it until they asked him to do it you say well why is that is because he listened to me because he Partnerships with you his partnership with you we are the wonderful sermon on Esther the other day when when Brother David Seiler preached but listen the king did nothing for them until Esther stood up and took our position you know it needs we need sons of God exposing the devil and saying that Wicked hangman that Wicked cancer that Wicked devil that wicked porn that Wicked evil there [Applause] we need people bringing it before God and saying God we you know if we if you don't do something we're going to perish and it's the truth if the Rapture don't take place we're gonna perish we need a rapture we need people calling on God come Jesus come Jesus don't leave me here whatever you do don't leave me here [Applause] so you see God made it that way where that that we we would be his hands his feet I want you just to get some of this for a moment Brother Brad was sitting now listen to this God Is So arraigns it that his program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're in God's will doing his program again he Partnerships you he said the thing about it is he said we are he says we have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that makes us a part in relationship with God that's born again a son and daughter of God tell him out of the Bible they'll believe it but the thing of it is they forget who they are they think well I don't know well brother oh brother you that's born again Sons and Daughters of God is it going to choke you co-equal with Jesus Christ in his presence amen oh my that's what makes the devil angry and Let the Church of God realize who they are amen listen what do you what did the king say to ask her I'll give you everything even half of the even to half the kingdom listen listen church this is what he's endowed his bride with you say oh well what the King was going to do he's going to take him he's going to take a razor and divide the Kingdom right in half no that's not what he was saying he was saying we are will reign together Esther amen we will reign together you know the law has been written amen all men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God but write the book write it and avenge your enemies and The Last Enemy that's got to be revenge is death and somebody in this generation is gonna defeat death Hallelujah they'll defeat death hell and the grave because hell has come here in this dimension we'll defeat it we are the defeaters this is where God is doing he's moving it he says isn't it strange that God wants his people to have part into it Jesus looked to the Harvest and he says pray you the Lord the Harvest that was him pray to me I'll send labors into my Harvest it's some part you have to do God is waiting for his church to call on him he's always did it God is waiting today for the people to call his servant into action and the servant can't get into action until the people praise you either believe that or you don't I believe it amen listen let me just share one more with you he said see we're Buddies it's a church we've got something to do ourselves you got something to do here's the gospel I know it but if you just sit here and don't preach it what good is it going to do going to do you've got to something you've got to do to make an effort he said well I believe God can heal I mean I just don't know stand up and let that word become your word believe it don't reason it just believe it so you see God God the prophet of God said we're Buddies this is what Abraham was a friend of God and as a friend he said won't you do right you're going to destroy this but what about the righteous there you you can't destroy the righteous with the wicked you will want the god of Heaven do right well what about your lost loved ones come on life never was a part of the royal seed but he was a part of redemption I want you to get this we have the church that'll go through tribulation when's the last time you prayed for your neighbor when is the last time you encouraged someone just in their walk with God or they don't go to our church they're not bright people listen what if they just go into the tribulation they're going to be there and your testimony encouragement Don't Close Your Heart and say a Spore no more every member in the Lamb's Book of Life is valuable whether it's the bride whether it's the Buddhist virgin whether it's 144 000 they're all valuable [Applause] foreign now coming back here once Jesus ascended into heaven his Apostles in effect become his hands now they like the Lord to heal with touch come on we know there's nothing in the flesh of man it's doing what God Said do it's being the conduit through which the spirit of God can move as an intercessor God could God could have done everything he did down at Sodom without Abraham but he wouldn't he said I want you to have a part of this and once the Mysteries were revealed to him it made him an intercessor it gave him a concern for the Lost even if they wasn't going to be bride he had concern for the Lost now so ananas would lay his hands on Paul three days after the Damascus experienced and restored his sight in turn Paul his hands became channels of extraordinary miracles but lay his hands on the sick man that malt and heal him the Bible said he did Mighty Works to the laying on of his hands this is what Jesus said would happen in John 15 he said I'm the vine you are the branches you will bear the fruit of the Vine so he tells us in the inside man we are God's fruit bearers and I believe Saint John 17 you are the branches he was divine the Divine puts for the branches but the branches has to Bear the fruit if the branch is getting the life out of the vine well it's the same kind of life that's in the vine don't you think so it has to be now our hands look at your hands our lips our eyes them are God's hands lips and eyes that he has here on the Earth now he's gone back to God and he's sent forth his energy of his Spirit to anoint us with the Holy Spirit and that if we'll submissive to him and then our hands represent his hand that's the reason they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and hear you him he says it like this God always in great feeling toward his people meets in the counsel of man God only works through his church are you getting this the church is God's agency he said in one place in the gospel I'm the binder of the branches the vine does not bear the fruit it purges the Branson Branch bears fruit so the church is the branch that the holy spirit is working through he speaks through the pastor's lips he works through his hands and through Divine gifts he sets his body into emotions led by the Holy Spirit by emptying himself out and letting the Holy Spirit take control he brings messages he sees visions and great things no matter what it might be that God has chosen to do if he'll yield to the spirit God will work through him or any member of his church because as he pours out his spirit all men shall drain dreams and young men shall see visions amen my sons and my daughters they will prophesy somebody help me preach now so you see God as he says and we would see Jesus God in Christ reconciling the world and himself God can find himself to one body that was his son through the death of his son God brought the entire it brought God to the entire church Universal through the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit and through the blood of Christ cleanses mortal man and makes them not in themselves but by the grace of God through his grace make some subjects of the holy spirit that he talks and walks and preaches and acts through his church his Vine his branches that's connected in him amen again in perseverance brother Branham talked about the Harvest again where he said you prayed that the lord of the Harvest was sin labors and he said he made himself we're making himself with man so bound together that he works only to the agency of man he chose man to work for me he could have chose his son to preach the gospel he could have chose the Winds of the trees or the stars but he chose man and he veils himself inside and hides himself from the unbeliever and reveals himself to whom he will amen again he says and thou art a prophet but he couldn't do no more for you than what he's than what he can working through his church right now the message Witnesses he said Jesus Christ is in the building I believe that this morning it meant to perform Miracles I believe that too but he does it through his church his people they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover in my name they shall cast out evil spirits the commission given the church that's what's the matter with the church today it doesn't know its position if you knew positionally what you was and what you are there would not be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes that's right the thing of it is you're looking off into a millennium for something to happen out there when it's already here now we are the sons of God no we will be we are right now right this minute we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now oh if you could just recognize that and the supreme authority that Jesus has given to every believer anything you'd desire of that you need only thing you have to do is ask and receive it whatsoever thing you desire When you pray believe you receive it it'll be given to you that's true whatsoever thing you desire When you pray believe it you receive it you shall have it you see all through the book of Acts and let me say about the book of Acts that was not the Acts of the Apostles that was the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles is that right so when we talk about a book of Acts Church we're not talking about fickle men who are fighting argue and thus and debating this and that and how quarrels in the church and dissensions and we're not talking about man we're talking about the Holy Spirit and God's going to have a book of Acts Church let me rephrase that God has right now at evening like Tabernacle the bride around the world a book of Acts Church amen where the Holy Spirit Acts he's not stale he's not stagnant he's not dead he's not passages he acts he acts Hallelujah and his church is Jesus Christ in action on the Earth now so all through the book of Acts where the Holy Spirit was moving through the apostles God healed to the to the laying on of hands transferring by intercession the Redemptive blessings of Calvary through the hands of redeemed men it is the New Testament way among both Jews and gentiles now and I prove that by the Bible somebody with me now so we we the thing of it is is we are not just to have an organizational life this was not another denomination this is not just another two where you're a church where you occupy a pew amen you might chew too if you're chewing gum but spit it out and let's get to church but nevertheless you know God is we're we're not just to occupy Pew we got a job to do you a congregation or to bring the Holy Spirit down through intercession through psalms to praise through worship through prayers brother Brandon would say I can't do nothing until he's here and we can't do anything until he's here now he was already there but that was served to be worshiped and and to be and for the preaching of the word but then he would come there to heal the sick now in the Statue of perfect man brother Brandon said we are not building an organization remember this we're not just going to become another denominational Church just uh you know organizational members he said Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his words he build up the individuals of that place not build an organization to a greater denomination but to build the individual to Sons and Daughters of God that's what God wants in this day is Samson God of sons and donors of God operating by the spirit of God I'm going to get them to some of the nuts and bolts of this in just a minute but let's let's just review a little more of the Bible at Iconium which was a city and Asia Minor known now as turkey Paul and Barnabas Minister dare acts 14 and verse 3 they remained there a long time speaking boldly for the Lord Who Bore witness to the word of his grace granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands um among the Jews and the Gentiles in age of verse Chapter 19 Verse 11. God wroughts special Miracles by the hands of Paul I'm showing you this is New Testament Doctrine Bible Way so that from his body were brought into the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and diseases departed from them so not only did he lay hands on them but the things that he was the things that he was wearing are holding there was taken and put on the sick and the diseases departed from them the evil spirits went out of them because that's what healing does cast out devils remember Paul and the apostles they are the they are the pattern of every god-called minister amen if you're not laying hands on the sick you're not a god-called minister that's just it one of the last recorded miracles in the book of actses in Acts 28 28 chapter 28 verse 8. it happened that the father published lay sick with fever and dysentery and Paul visited him and prayed and put in his hands on him healed him hmm so you can see right now what what it is all the way down through it's the pattern of the Bible whether they were Jews or whether they were gentiles sure sure we we ought to believe in a greater way I'd like to see your faith rise where you're just right in your seat you're healed I've seen it happen I've seen people filled with the Holy Ghost right in their seats I have preached in meetings and demons would fall out right there and be that people delivered right there as I ministered the word amen I remember Ellis Blake years ago he he when I backslid took up cigarettes again had a two pack a day habit or more and he'd come back in church and there you know his backslidden under condemnation and everything but while I was preaching one morning the Holy Spirit fell down in that place and he screamed out I'm delivered I'm delivered I'm delivered and never to smoke again that's the power of the Gospel going forth but I've also seen it where we lay hands of the sick of the oppressed on the demon my press and they recover I'll get to in a minute God don't just have a gift of healing he has gifts of healing now brother Bradham in Be not Afraid this is after the seals in Tucson now I want you to believe but first I want you to see that now like healing we know the holy spirit is here and I believe in laying on the hands somebody oh jumped on me kind of rough about that this morning there's no such a thing as people laying hands on one another it shouldn't be done can you imagine some some Candlelight preacher spirit are you with me Campbell light that's Church of Christ I call a man of Christ because they don't because they're Antichrist anti-anointing so I don't call them Church of Christ I call them Church of antichrist because they're anti-anointing they don't believe in praying for the sick they don't believe God heals they believe all that gives us path that sounds like a lot of message Believers today that become Church of the Antichrist says you know this man jumped on him about saying they're kind of rough there's no such a thing as people laying hands on one another it shouldn't be done now can you imagine the evil spirit in a man that would attack God's Prophet for laying on hands and he said I said well you just haven't read the Bible brother that's all said the last commission that fell from the lips of Jesus Christ was lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's the last word she said when he left the Earth his first commission he gave the disciples was heal the sick cleanse the leopards raise the Dead cast out Devils first group is sent out Matthew 10. the last group he sent out these signs have all of them that believed they said cast out devil speak with new tones take up serpents drink deadly things if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's the last words he said and was received up in the glory certainly that's a Great Commission what it does I don't know it says care not what he said do amen and of course as I said that's not the only way God heals because you know he he spoke the word and the Centurion servant was healed said I I don't need a touch just say it just send the word you know that's where his faith lay and if you're faithful lay that way you can be of service this morning while I'm preaching because when the gospel is preached demons are cast out amen now did you know brother Brandon said about Peter he received a special gift he said he received a great gift of healing so that people that laid in his shadow were healed so these people wasn't even touched all they had to do is just have his shadow pass over it was a great gift of healing but you said but shouldn't we be concerned about someone who's living with some kind of secret sin you know uh you know and and you know shouldn't you be afraid that would jump on you or you'd be associated with that well let's read the Bible the Bible answers it James 5 13. is any humongous Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms is there any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord verse 15 and the prayer face shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and doesn't matter we're eating this and if he hath committed sin is going to jump off on you you got to worry about getting his curse if he's committed sin they shall be forgiven him [Applause] well maybe he's done something and he committed sin and this came on him well if we pray for him God will not only in our intercession heal his body but forgive him of his sins thank you verse 15 says and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he committed sin they shall be forgiven and confess your false to one another pray for one another that you may be healed the effects of fervent prayer of a righteous man of aleth much now I want to tell you something in your intercession the first thing you have to do is position yourself as a righteous man you say well wait a minute when Jesus told us how to pray he told us first to position ourselves what do you say our father how can you how can you call him father and you're not a son you are positioned yourself in relation to him Our Father which art in heaven come on amen so the first thing you do when you pray is you position yourself as a son of God that's why people over here they're waiting on adoption in one day where you know when the bride gets the power we all get adopted glory to God well when's it going to be what are you gonna have to do to do it how much work do you have to do to get it I tell you what you receive the Holy Ghost he positions you in the body it gives you power to cast out Devils to speak with new times come on it's the adoption robe it's the badge of authority I will now after I'm now acting not as a hollow human being but as as a man filled with the spirit of God so the first thing you do is position yourself Who Am I who is God a distant God he's my father and he's my father I'm his son and as his son I can approach him I'm not a stranger I'm not a sinner I'm not a wayward one I'm a son and as a son I come into this presence with boldness amen now but brother Tim I'm not sinless I got lots of faults and sometimes like he preached about Sarah you know she struggles to believe and she doubts and quivers and waivers and I'm not going to ask you for a show of hands I'll just put mine up I have enough trouble with my own mind and my own unbelief my own doubting and quivering questioning you brother Tim yeah first thing I do when I come to God is I have to get rid of all of that because that ain't the truth I am a redeemed blood-bought son of the Living God bought by the blood of Jesus Christ washed as white as snow without without one thing the devil has no claim of me because the blood has annihilated my sin so I'm not approved to the mentally sinner I'm approaching them as a son what about a son an osprey he's my daddy Papa God I can ask him a favor anytime I need this I need this this brother's need this brother's in need this sister God I need this my brother Brandon said a righteous man is not a sinless man oh now listen hold this notice he said Elijah was a man subject to passions as we are he had his ups and downs his differences and the scripture of his life proves he had his ups and downs like we do and he had times of wondering wondering questioning and his times that his temper got away from him he had a lot of things that went wrong but he was still a righteous man because he confesses unworthiness and believed in God and that's what made him righteous amen now come on now we are not righteous within ourselves we're righteous to Jesus Christ I cannot be Sanctified Within Myself I'm Sanctified through Jesus Christ who stands in the presence of God in my place it isn't my Holiness it's his Holiness my Holiness won't work at all but what he does because God has accepted him and accepted him he had to accept me because I'm in him hey that's pretty simple ain't you we are accepted in the Beloved if God accepts Christ he accepts me come on look in the Old Testament what was it bring a lamb without blemish and if the priest come on either you bring your lamb lead it up the priest never looked and said uh okay but you've got a flaw there you can't worship Boy you know you I'll tell you what you've made a mistake you you you can't come in here no no he never looked at the man he looked at the lab come on now and if the lamb was accepted and judge to be without blemish then he was accepted hallelujah how do I know I'm going to be if they accepted in the presence of God because they did everything right and I read my Bible on my knees for 24 hours at least this week and I prayed so long and I did this and I did this work and I carried Goods to this one and helped that is not how he's not looking at me he's looking at my lab and if Jesus was accepted you are accepted that's why the Bible said you are accepted at the Beloved where in Christ well you just don't know what kind of bad thoughts I had this week yeah you don't know what kind of bad thoughts I had and I ain't telling you either I'm going to tell you how many it was and what it was about ain't none of your business because every one of them thoughts I cast down they're not a part of me amen but you see that's why you see if your heart condemns you not then you can have confidence God hears you so how do we keep our hearts from condemning Us by repentance so we're not sinless in ourselves we can't be sanctifying ourselves we're Sanctified through Jesus Christ who stands in his presence in my place and isn't my Holiness is his Holiness my Holiness won't work at all but because God's son accepted him and accepted him he had to accept me because I'm in him was and that makes what makes it real isn't it then we don't depend on ourselves now let's get a little clarification now that doesn't make us say we can sin brother if you sin you're just away from God that's all there's only one thing is confessing it right with God as long as you desire to sin the desire of sin still in your heart then it's time to stay down to altar until that thing's taken out you will sin you're bound to sin because you can't help it but not willful sin he that sins willfully after receives the knowledge of Truth there remaineth no sacrifice for him you say well if I sin will believe then there's no sacrifice for me that's exactly right you have to go back to Calvary again that's all it means don't mean you're lost forever means you can either go back to Calvary because you need a sacrifice for that because you sin willfully but but every day he said you're beginning you're bound to sin so we'll think wrong thoughts we'll do we'll make a little mistakes along the way now we're not going to go out there and take another man's wife that's premeditated we're not going to go out there and lay with a that's premeditated you understand amen but you're you know willfully sin you know I you know you sin willfully after you receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no sacrifice for your sins but every every day you're bound to sin brother Brandon tells us if I got what I deserved I'd go to hell take the blood of Jesus off of you one minute you're lost you're hopeless when you're without God Bound for hell and let me just say even brother Brandon would pray many times the Lord forgive me of my sins I I really don't believe he was drinking and smoking and adulterizing and I but he fought with unbelief just like we do turn on the radio and the radio a man was saying something about God not being real and whatever and taking him down a path and he listens that a little bit and you know he got to thinking you know Satan began to talk to him and in his thoughts finally he got to hold himself and said Satan how a liar you are so while that ain't proper English I don't care what English it is devil understood it Satan how old are you all they make my thoughts dims your thoughts and you're going to go to hell for them thoughts but I ain't Hallelujah because there is an atomic at your house brother Branham talked about this affirmative prayer of a righteous man availeth much he said now we're not righteous no man is righteous only the Son of God and we don't stand in our own righteousness I don't stand in my righteousness I stand in his righteousness so as long as I'm Anointed with him it's the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man interceding for you through me to have you believe now in the body of Christ there are Gifts of healing in the church as is one of the nine spiritual gifts and of course in there given by the spirit is the word of wisdom the word of knowledge faith is one of the gifts of the Spirit Well it gives her laid on the Shelf well then we can't have faith then you know to Gifts of healing and the Bible the Bible speaks gifts plural there to another that work in the Miracles to another prophecy to another discernment of the spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues and brother Branham speaks of that in standing in the gap and he says he said in gifts the gifts has returned to the church's Divine Healing and prophecy and speak with tongues and interpretation and although it's been misrepresented terrifically yet but yet that don't take away there's a good one there is a true one of a real genuine a gift of speaking in tongues that's always supposed to be in the church so all the way down to the end and after the end because brother Branham tells us you know when we get on the other side we'll all be speaking in tongues a Heavenly language amen now so you see every man that's born of the spirit of God becomes the Son of God and the supernatural power of God is in him and he can't help but believe in the Supernatural because he's the son of God and there there's a lot of them today that you know it's cold and formal and different God forsaken backslidden churches because they're filled with men and women that are not born of the spirit of God they have no taste of God or they don't know nothing about him all they know is theology even if it's message Theology and that's the reason you can't get them to believe a thing but we're to be a spiritual church we're to be a super race we're a people that can that should hear his voice we're a people that should uh should it should become intercessors you know that that sigh and cry for the Abominations that's done in the city you know people that as brother random was said you know that sin is so sneaky it just sneaks right up on you before you know it and actually if you think about it you know you're living in a time and you know now it's quite common to you all the sin that's going on around you it just happens it's in your neighborhood it's in your schools it's everywhere and you see it it you know kind of makes you sick but it has a way of just kind of sneaking up on you where it becomes common well that's just the way things are but it should make you sigh and cry for the Abominations it's done in the city and brother Bradham said that's the one that God is putting his seal upon because otherwise it just dulls our senses oh well that's what's the world we live in and we get to the point that it doesn't bother us but it ought to make us sick and God wants intercessors he wants people who can pray the fervent prayer I'm gonna go just a little bit over time because I'm borrowing from next Sunday and then the next Sunday no it won't be that bad but I I want just a little more time now you know brother Madam was told by the angel you are to receive a gift to Divine Healing and he said how perfect that was they told you a gift he never said the gift but ever gift he said but Divine Healing is the gift but Divine Healing and it's a gift it's Gifts of healing and you can have all kinds of gifts of healing different ways but every other is a gift the gift of Prophecy the gift of this but Divine Healing is in the plural gifts and so there's not but what not just one gift of healing there is a variety of gifts of healing Peter had it where that his shadow would pass over and people it would be healed that was a great gift you know others you know while Paul was preaching he perceived that a man had Faith to be healed and commanded him to stand up you see again and again there's all kinds of others would be laid hands on different different approaches varieties or diversities the Bible calls it of gifts now brother Branham called it a gift a gift to preaching that could explain the word in such a way that you could receive your healing right there in your seat was also a gift of healing yet it was administered through preaching not laying on our hands so there's all kinds of ways that God will use it you know when when that and of course you know let me just say you think if the days of Miracles are passed brother Brandon said the days of God has passed so we know the days of God is in past so the days the Miracles are not passed so the only thing that we can do as a minister is to point you to the work at Calvary we have no power to heal you even though we have become the hands of Jesus there's no power in our hands we are just carrying out his word to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover just like getting ministering baptism water only saves you in the answering of a good conscience toward God not through the outward cleansing so it isn't a physical the physical act of baptism that saves you it is the the answer of a good conscience toward God but you have to do the physical act same thing with with laying on the hands it it doesn't heal you but it's a physical act through which God moves which he transfers his power through through uh through humans unto and as a as a um as a catalyst or a contact now brother Branham many times he didn't even raises his voice when he was praying for the sick many times it was very mellow very quiet you know many times that he he would pray for needs and even demon powers and just speak them you know I can go back to Youth Camp when when that boy there was laying there and I just in a voice she can only hardly hear and just spoke to him speak his peace till that demon there fled away and yet you could barely hear me say it there's other times I've lifted my voice listen I know I know the powers of demons but they got to fall before the presence of my God he commissioned me to cast out devils I know he's going to do it he commits me to lay hands on the sick and I know they're going to recover now but in a prayer line in 1948 brother Branham was praying for this woman and he must have lifted his raised his voice pretty loud he said doubt their Spirit come out of her in the name of of Jesus Christ the son of God leave the woman through Jesus Christ's name I assure you thee to go then he said I'm not yelling at you but you can't baby demons and faith is our Victory he says God rebuked that devil that's hindering you these beautiful little girls May the power that raised Jesus from the grave cast that thing away and never bother you no more I say that on the authority of God's word you have to get angry with the Devil amen God gives us a victory we got it right now this is the victory that overcomes the world even your faith but he says you have to get angry with the Devil so there are times brother Branham would be very soft there'd be other times he would scream out amen and there they would say you can't baby demons others you say scream out and he says you got to get angry with the Devil you see again it's diversities of gifts and diversities that of administration why am I saying that because God don't just have one way of doing things don't put him in a box and brother Brandon said most ministers who preached Divine Healing are usually all I ever met are great teachers of the word some of them just have great powerful Faith just lay hands on the people and scream out and make the enemy leave them now that's Faith that's the gift of faith so how could we deny that it's in the Bible now let me bring it down to you but it's not just preachers that have gifts of Faith or Gifts of healing that's in the body hello somebody I want to get it I want you to hear you're a partner too is not just preachers this is not a nicolaitan gospel where we conquer the laity and it's all in the preacher listen he says in the message expectations he said and here might be one tonight with the prayer of faith that would pray a prayer of faith that would heal someone that gift might be on them tonight and it might be upon this lady here tomorrow night and upon this man over here the next night and it might come back to her it's in the church the body so the gifts of healing are in the body hey now you say a sister or a gift of healing come on a sister well you remember Brother Brad I'm talking about it being in an auditorium there and he was going to have a a prayer line that night and prayer cards had been passed out and there was this little sister with a baby there that was afflicted and she was holding that baby and had a prayer card in her hand and and that sister sitting on the front row and she's saying you know uh you know man I just feel led to pray for that that baby and I just can't get away from it and so he kept kept kind of rebuking the thought really you know just putting it down putting it down and finally you know it just came over and she walked up to the sister and the little lady with the baby and said uh you know you would you mind if I said something to you and certainly well I'm a Christian too and I'm a mother and yeah just to relieve my conscience for the last 30 minutes you've been standing there I feel God wanted me to pray for that baby would you mind if I prayed for it before you took it up so well certainly she let the little baby out the mother prayed for it and said thank you and walked back and said why don't you take my seat and she gave her her seat and walked up into the balcony that night on the platform this lady come up in there with the baby and was told your babies had a certain certain disease yes said there's a woman that's dressed in a certain way prayed for that baby sitting right up there in that balcony there this that's screaming now and said she God ordained that that woman should pray for that baby again he said now what if that little mother had failed to do what God told her to do you know see it wasn't evangelist Place God works in all the laity we all have certain jobs to do but you pray for one another and God will take care of you in 1960 he mentions Again The Compassion of that mother for that baby would have been far beyond what I would have had for her so the gift of healing if God ever speaks to your heart to go pray for someone you go do what God tells you to do always follow the Holy Spirit again in question answer 64 he brings again can we all do Miracles he said yes when you're directed by the Holy Ghost to do Miracles go do it because the holy spirit's directed now he said if that woman wouldn't have carried out what God told her perhaps there would have been rebuking the spirit to her because she disobeyed God hello and she hadn't done what God told her to do perhaps there would have been a rebuke he said always if you're a Christian and something's persuading you to do something go do it don't doubt it go do it so you see the Bible talks about this and he talks about Elijah and he said Elijah was a man of like passion as we are and he prayed earnestly that it not rained you know he walks right out there and he said there will not be rain or due till I call for it but then he had to pray earnestly that it would rain here he spoke it in a word of faith and then had to pray God don't let it rain you know what I said and for three years it didn't rain and then God said he he God said to Elijah in the third year of drought said go to Ahab and tell him go show yourself to Ahab and I will send rain on the earth now God said I'm going to send rain so he goes up there there and and you know what happened here comes the pillar of fire down burns up the sacrifice the altar licks it up all around God vindicates him and he walks over to Ahab now it's not rained in three years the sky's the brass full of judgment and there ain't a hint of water in the sky they're in a cloud and and he just begins to act now because God said I'm going to send rain God said I'm going to heal you I'm the Lord God that heals All to Jesus you've got to act on it come on and the church has got to act on it if the church isn't praying and the church ain't believing in it and the church is forbidden it then God can't move [Applause] now so here Elijah there is saying they have guilty up and drink and he said for there is a sound of an abundance of rain he said I've already well listen where did he hear the sound when God said I'm going to send rain on the earth that was the sound of abundance of rain there is sound of healing that is right here in this building this morning because God said come on I'm gonna Shield you he'll not heal just your body he'll heal your marriages he'll heal your home he'll heal your finances he'll heal everything come on don't limit God limit the Holy One of Israel [Applause] so now God has said it's going to happen but Elijah's got to pray for it it is not going to happen till Elijah prays so Elijah gets up on the top of Mount Carmel cast himself down on Earth put his face between his knees and he said to his servant go now look to the Sea and he'd come back and said there's nothing so Elijah said God you ain't going to do it I prayed and it didn't happen so I give up let me just go tell Ahab no he didn't do that did he days of miracles must be passed there ain't no healing in the bride so what'd he do he went and prayed again and he prayed again he sent him again and he goes and said there's nothing so when you pray and you get nothing what do you do huh you pray again so what'd he do he prayed again and now the third time and nothing happens so he prays endlessly again come on amen the effects of fervent prayer of a righteous man when a man of God when a child of God will not give up but will be persevered and hold on and do like Abraham and go again and again and again and again but I prayed for that and nothing happened that's what was happening with Elijah I prayed nothing happened so you pray again nothing happens well go back up and look nothing Elijah might look up six times nothing seventh time he comes up there come on and before now everything has been like a failure prayed six times nothing happened might as well give up you're not a prophet off after all must be some sin in your life God ain't hearing you it might have been too haughty down there when you when you when you spoke to those prophets of Baal all this condemnation coming his way I'm talking about a man of Life passion as you you get down to pray and every time the accusers right there whispering saying all kinds of things and you have no right no whatever because he knows if you'll believe you're about to cast him down you see the Bible said that we were in the Heavenly it's a Heavenly battle against Princeton politics and powers and spiritual wickedness in Heavenly places so the higher you go in God the more you're going to be opposed by the devil so yes you as you begin to pray look for opposition come on it's a matter the devil's going to come out with all his forces with his accusation with everything but you don't give up I'm telling you don't give up on your marriage don't get up on your home don't give up on your children don't give up on the prodigal come on now I'm saying don't give up but I pray pray again the Bible said ask and keep on asking and it'll be given you seek and keep on seeking and you will find that now can you keep on knocking amen the door will be open for everyone who keeps on asking receive he that keeps on seeking fines he that keeps on knocking it shall be open Jesus told us a parable of an unjust judge and he told us about a woman that came she was a widow and wanted the judge to do something on her behalf and she he wouldn't do it he was a hard man and he didn't care for the Widow and whatever and she but he got to take him this woman is the kind of woman ain't gonna give up and so if I don't do something for her she will come in here every day troubling me are you with me amen so yet he said I don't feel man and I don't regard people I don't care whether she's a wit or not he's a hard man and he says but I'll tell you what she's persistent and I know if I don't give it to her she's going to come in here every day bothered me so what I'm going to do is I'm going to give it to her now Jesus said hear what the unjust said God the unjust judge saith verse 7 of the of Luke 18 what's this put it up for me Luke 18 verse 7. and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear along with him what's not verse 8 I tell you this is Jesus word he will events them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh will he find people who won't give up will he find people that'll hold on to the promise will I find that kind of Faith persistent faith on the Earth are you with me now now then the Bible said about Elijah and it came to pass the seventh time that he came and said behold out of the sea Rose this little Cloud it's not like a man's hand it's not very big now listen all Elijah had to do was just see the slightest movement he didn't think God that's good enough you're going to do I tell you you'll never get enough water out of that so what a mouse no I think what he did he looked at that and he said us I see it right there in that promise I see God moving I see the spirit moving I see a cloud I see something happening and he began to act of what had happened and he said go tell Ahab and prepare your Terrier because I can hear the sound of abundance of rain I see the holy spirit is about to break out Hallelujah that's what we're seeing the size about his head we have seen this healing this miracle this tonight and the other don't you give up on any promise of God look at the promise of God and say that promise is mine I've not given up on it I'm going to have it for my children I'm gonna have it for my family if I have it for my marriage I'm gonna happen for my church thank you Jesus that's why we ought to look at it this morning thank you Jesus I see things beginning to move I see the holy ghost look at that now I'm going to act on it let the musicians come Hallelujah get in desperation go there and keep on praying approach him again I've asked you for 15. what about 45 I've asked you for 45. what about 40. I've asked you for 40. what about 30. I'm asking for 30. what about 20. what about what about 10 whatever and the Bible said and God remembered Abraham and saved lot there's about there's some here this morning God's remembering he hasn't forgot you he wants to work through you amen he wants to work through you are you with me my think of that just a moment brother Branham talks about it and the Bible says and let me just cover this just a moment I know you're standing now and we're here at the end but I want just to I just want to bring this out the Bible said that sometimes we don't even know what to pray for put up Romans 8 26. and says the Holy Spirit helps us in our infirmities for we don't know what to pray for Israel but the spirit itself make its intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knoweth what is the mind of God because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God so when you pray you might be like the little boy who was saying his alphabet and he was down praying and somebody come up to him and said Sonny Boy what are you doing say in your alphabet that's disrespectful he said no I don't mean to be disrespectful he said you see I I was I I have no education I wasn't I'm an orphan I didn't get to go to school and I don't know how to read or write but I do know the alphabet and my mama died before she could teach me how to pray and I don't even know how to pray so I was down here just reciting my alphabet he said because I knew God could take those letters inform them into words that he would know my heart and what I'm trying to say the Holy Spirit oh my do you break out sometimes into an unknown language to you brother Brandon was in a meeting and he had a strange event he felt so burdened he couldn't go to the church and he was going to let the meeting just go on without appearing he's in a hotel and Billy came and said dad you ready no I can't go come back in dab you ready you know I feel so burden I can't go and he says okay I'll be back around say go tell brother Baxter just to do what he can with the meeting close it however he wants to I can't come he said about that time as Billy walked off to get a Coke and a candy bar he was there and he began to hear somebody in German sound like he thought it was German began to speak he said who is that ah they're really desperate whatever they is there's something going on and you know he could hear the noise from down the street in his hotel and and this man over here speaking in German so what is that said has he listened he realized it wasn't out in the hall it was right there in a room and he felt of his mouth and it was his mouth moving and he was speaking in another language foreign like I could just run through a trip and leap over a wall I felt such freedom and he said I ran and found Billy said Billy don't leave without me let's go and got the meeting brother Baxter was singing a song One More Time waiting and saying well I Bill said I thought you'd never get here brother Bradham uh you know uh you know you're late I know I know and he gets something goes to speak and in the back there's a woman who was dying had been dying with tuberculosis doctor said don't move her her lungs will rupture they took an old car and took the seed out of it laid her down in the rough roads I think it was in Arkansas the rough roads could have been Louisiana's rough roads the man who began to beat her up and down and you know her lungs ruptured and blood was spurting out of her mouth and she said get me out of here I don't want to die in this car and they laid her out on the grass and all of a sudden laying out there in a dying condition about to draw our last breath something came over her and she jumped up from there totally healed ran to the meeting was shouting in the back and they said what was it said I was on the way to the meeting and there I was dying blood coming out of my mouth I was hemored into death and said all of a sudden I was healed and said what time was that brother Bradham Mass what time was it was exactly the same time he was interceding through a prophet on Earth he said it might have been her angel that came to him but whether it came to him and he began to speak to him through him and intercede God wants to use his people God wants to use you Amen to intercede on the behalf of others I wonder how many he's got a burden in your heart this morning you got a need that is there maybe some need some desire maybe lost loved one maybe maybe a a a your home is all tore up maybe maybe sicknesses in your body maybe you got a friend maybe whatever maybe he got someone that's lost maybe right here in this building this morning that needs a touch let's practice what we've heard today I want you to lay your hands on that person next to you right now I want you to agree together I don't know maybe you can have compassion for that brother that sister won this right now in need you can have compassion so that's my brother that's my little sister that's my friend they got a need in their life and we've been commissioned to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover as sickness may be a home disease marriage problem that sickness could be financial situation [Music] might be a demon [Music] of Oppression or depression a spirit of suicide it could be a spirit of the enemy whatever it is subject to the name of Jesus Christ we've had on the board all day here Moses with his hands lifted up interceding and of course as he interceded for Israel in the battle when his hands fall down the battle would go against him and they would be run from their enemies but I'm asking today is there somebody here that can say he's Jehovah Nissi the Lord my banner and to know you know to lift up the name of Jesus and I want to say of that that name as we lift it up it's higher than all names it's greater than cancer it's greater than uh than cigarettes it's greater than drunkenness it's greater than a family problem it's greater the pornography is great I don't care you name the name and if we'll lift up that name right now amen there'd be somebody winning the battle now listen I don't want to be the one just praying I want you to pray what good would it do for me to pray you need to pray amen you're the intercessor there are Gifts of healing all over this building right now in men and women right now that are laying their hands on the sick Rey laying their hands on one another amen and I tell you God is doing Miracles right now he's moving by his holy spirit obstacles
