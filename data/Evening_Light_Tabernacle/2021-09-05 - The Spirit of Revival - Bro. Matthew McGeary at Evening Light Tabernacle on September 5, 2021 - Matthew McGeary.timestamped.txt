[46:24] are standing here this morning in the
[46:26] face of all opposition and declaring
[46:28] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[46:31] today and forever oh my what a blessed
[46:34] people we are amen
[46:36] my praise the lord
[46:38] amen just maybe in settling myself just
[46:40] to tell you that uh we we've come to
[46:43] know brother tim and the family and just
[46:44] hold them
[46:46] really dear to our hearts we started to
[46:48] serve the lord and in december of 1999
[46:51] and from that time we would come over to
[46:53] be in fellowship with the saints here
[46:55] and brother tim and and my uh i cherish
[46:58] the uh some of those early years i'd
[47:00] come over and brother tim would take me
[47:02] to some goat shows so his goats could
[47:04] show this little city boy around the
[47:05] arena
[47:06] and uh you know some of his prized goats
[47:08] received best of show for for uh showing
[47:11] a little city boy what it was like to to
[47:13] to go into a goat show and into the
[47:15] country and i just look back on those
[47:17] little times of fellowship we had and
[47:19] and how much they've meant to me down
[47:21] through the ages and down through the
[47:22] time and you look back and you reflect
[47:24] on it and my life seems to get busy and
[47:27] and you get a family and you don't maybe
[47:30] have the the the ability to travel or
[47:32] take the time out like you used to but
[47:34] my you certainly cherish those and so
[47:37] we're just so thankful to be here we're
[47:39] just reading out of john uh first john
[47:41] chapter four
[47:43] and be reading to you
[47:44] uh verse
[47:46] one through four out of first john four
[47:49] verses one through four
[47:56] and it reads here it says beloved
[47:58] believe not every spirit but try the
[48:00] spirits
[48:04] whither they are of god because many
[48:06] false prophets are gone out into the
[48:08] world
[48:09] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[48:11] spirit that confesseth that jesus christ
[48:15] is come in the flesh
[48:16] is of god and every spirit that
[48:18] confesseth not that jesus christ is come
[48:20] in the flesh
[48:21] is not of god and this is the spirit of
[48:24] the antichrist wherever you have heard
[48:26] that it should come and even now already
[48:28] is in the world
[48:30] year of god little children and have
[48:32] overcome them because greater
[48:35] is he that is in you
[48:37] than he that is in the world
[48:39] amen and let's also just read out of
[48:41] revelations chapter 3
[48:45] and verse 20 and 21
[48:51] it says behold i stand at the door and
[48:54] knock if any man hear my voice and open
[48:56] the door
[48:58] i will come into him and will sup with
[49:00] him and he with me
[49:02] to him that overcometh
[49:05] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[49:08] even as i also overcame and set down
[49:11] with my father and his throne amen you
[49:14] may be seated we ask a blessing upon the
[49:16] reading of the word
[49:17] brother branham would take this these
[49:20] texts these scriptures and he would
[49:22] preach the message called how can i
[49:24] overcome
[49:26] and
[49:28] my what a what a statement
[49:30] how can i overcome
[49:33] i mean when you read the title there's
[49:34] something in my heart that says lord i
[49:36] want to overcome
[49:37] how can i overcome and i think this is
[49:40] very profound here as the prophet would
[49:41] read these texts and he would say i want
[49:44] to take my subject this morning of this
[49:48] how can i overcome
[49:51] now i chose this because that i think
[49:53] it's a time
[49:55] that we should never let the spirit of
[49:58] revival die
[50:00] we've got to keep in revival
[50:03] constantly revived every day paul said
[50:06] he had to die daily that christ could
[50:09] live and we must never let the revival
[50:14] die within us oh my here here's the
[50:17] question how can i overcome
[50:20] i mean that's a good question concerning
[50:22] the day and age that we're living in
[50:24] you know the pressure of the age
[50:27] the nervous tension
[50:29] the always uh reaching for riches
[50:33] enough is never enough
[50:35] oh my does anybody know what i'm talking
[50:38] about it seems like there's just a
[50:39] constant pressure to do more to have
[50:42] more uh to go more places and and why
[50:45] you could even uh maybe have nice things
[50:48] and you can have a nice car and a nice
[50:49] career but mine just seems like there's
[50:51] a pressure on the age and a nervous
[50:53] tension that's that's always a pressure
[50:56] in you to to have more and to do more
[50:58] and and listen to what the prophet is
[51:00] saying here he says we've got to keep in
[51:03] revival
[51:05] constantly revived every day
[51:08] constantly revived every day so not just
[51:11] sunday
[51:12] not just wednesday
[51:14] not during the special services but
[51:16] every day
[51:18] we got to be constantly revived because
[51:21] god is wanting to have fellowship with
[51:23] you
[51:24] god is wanting to have communion with
[51:26] you now and it's not just in the sunday
[51:29] service it's not just in the wednesday
[51:31] service but oh we got to stay constantly
[51:34] revived we got to be in a relationship
[51:36] constantly walking with the lord in a
[51:39] revival
[51:40] now maybe god did something for you
[51:42] maybe on a saturday night and god came
[51:44] by and touched you and he did something
[51:46] specific for you there but as i thought
[51:48] about that you know there came a time
[51:50] that i'd given a promise to my wife
[51:53] and i said i'm i'm going to come to ohio
[51:55] and i'm going to marry you and it
[51:57] happened to be on a saturday where we
[52:00] went before the altar we made our vows
[52:02] and we were married but you know what i
[52:03] didn't leave her at the altar
[52:07] it was a saturday but i came there with
[52:10] a purpose and i came there to marry her
[52:13] because i wanted to spend the rest of my
[52:15] life with her and i want to tell you
[52:17] when god comes by your way and he
[52:19] touches you in a specific way and maybe
[52:21] it was on a friday night maybe it was on
[52:24] a saturday night maybe it'll be in a
[52:25] sunday morning service god is not
[52:28] touching you to leave you there at the
[52:30] altar but god is wanting to become one
[52:32] flesh with you he's wanting you to be
[52:34] born of his bone flesh of his flesh life
[52:37] of his life and power of his power god
[52:39] means business
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:42] he didn't come to just touch you and
[52:44] be a one-time thing but god has a
[52:47] purpose that he is wanting to do in your
[52:49] life and he's wanting to live with you
[52:51] he's wanting to be in communion with you
[52:53] he's wanting you to be lived constantly
[52:55] in revival every single day
[53:04] he said i will never leave you
[53:06] nor forsake you but i'll be with you
[53:09] even in you until the end of the world
[53:12] the prophet would say something along
[53:13] these lines that god pouring his spirit
[53:16] out into you
[53:17] he said not just one baptism
[53:20] not one little baptism of baptism after
[53:23] baptism
[53:25] he said not a revelation of
[53:28] justification not a revelation of
[53:30] sanctification not a revelation of the
[53:33] pouring out of the gifts and the pouring
[53:35] out of the spirit but he said revelation
[53:38] after revelation and power after power
[53:41] and glory after glory that is what god
[53:44] is wanting to enter in with you is a
[53:46] relationship where he's constantly every
[53:49] day revealing himself to you and
[53:51] speaking to you lifting you up guiding
[53:54] you oh that's the kind of relationship
[53:57] that god is wanting to have with this
[53:58] bride here in the end time well it's not
[54:00] just for the sunday night service it's
[54:02] not just for the wednesday night service
[54:04] it's not just for the camp meetings but
[54:06] god is wanting to live in a union with
[54:09] you every single day all that you can
[54:11] feel this presence that you can feel the
[54:13] power of god and then it'd be so real
[54:15] for you you might go through some time
[54:17] you might go through some dry spells
[54:19] where you don't feel them you don't know
[54:21] that uh you can't feel his presence but
[54:23] something has happened something has
[54:25] been quickened there is a seed that has
[54:27] come alive and in the face of the whole
[54:29] adversary in the face of the enemy when
[54:32] it seems like everything is going wrong
[54:34] and all hell is breaking loose you can
[54:36] stand right there in the face of the
[54:37] enemy say i know my redeemer living
[54:41] why i met him
[54:43] he came to me
[54:45] he revealed himself to me
[54:47] oh greater is he that is in you than he
[54:50] that is in the world
[54:53] oh those that hunger and thirst after
[54:55] righteousness shall be filled
[55:02] the prophet goes on to say here
[55:04] and how can i overcome
[55:06] so if we are trying to follow the
[55:07] message of the hour
[55:10] or at least this part of the message we
[55:11] should live constantly
[55:13] in the life of christ
[55:15] see because if you don't you lay around
[55:18] and know that these things that you're
[55:20] supposed to do
[55:22] and you don't do it
[55:25] oh now the lord's talking to somebody
[55:28] if he ain't talking to you he's talking
[55:29] to me
[55:32] he says we should live constantly in the
[55:34] life of christ see because if you don't
[55:36] you lay around and know that these
[55:38] things that you're supposed to do and
[55:39] don't do it the bible said that he that
[55:42] knoweth to do good and doeth it not to
[55:44] him it is sin
[55:45] then you become doty rotten
[55:49] and you're separated from the life of
[55:50] god so strive with all that's in you
[55:55] to stay in the life of christ that you
[55:58] would be fruit-bearing
[56:00] now we wonder why many times in our life
[56:02] we're not bearing the fruits of christ
[56:04] it's because we're not doing the things
[56:07] that we know we should do
[56:10] well that's pretty simple brother
[56:12] matthew yes and it's a simple truth
[56:17] that we need to take to heart
[56:20] and be obedient to the word of god
[56:23] and there's things that the pastor and
[56:25] the ministry here will deal with and
[56:27] they'll preach at over and over and
[56:29] you'll hear those things and maybe
[56:31] you'll adhere to do it one time or two
[56:33] time or you do good for a week or two
[56:36] weeks or maybe three months but god is
[56:38] wanting to call you to more than that
[56:40] he's wanting to call you into a life as
[56:42] an overcomer where those things are dead
[56:45] to you
[56:46] they don't tip you anymore and if they
[56:48] do tempt you you don't let that thought
[56:50] roost there in your mind but you look to
[56:52] the word that you might have the victory
[56:54] over it
[56:56] oh my maybe god is going to work in your
[56:58] life and maybe the things of the world
[57:00] they don't have a pull on you but you
[57:02] know it can be in the simple things
[57:04] where where god is calling us to a life
[57:06] of prayer
[57:08] and we know that god has told you over
[57:10] and over that you just feel like in your
[57:12] heart you know i need to get up early in
[57:14] the morning and i need to spend at least
[57:16] 30 45 minutes reading my bible and being
[57:19] in prayer in the presence of god that i
[57:22] could just start out my day in a sweet
[57:23] communion with the lord and you know
[57:25] that the lord has been dealing with you
[57:27] in those things and you wonder why
[57:29] you've been in frustration you wonder
[57:31] why the atmosphere in your home hasn't
[57:33] been just quite quite right and you
[57:35] wonder why you're not bearing the fruits
[57:37] in your life that you should be bearing
[57:39] it could be simply that god is just
[57:42] wanting you to be obedient to that still
[57:44] small voice that is calling you into
[57:46] prayer or calling you to a fellowship
[57:49] and you know to do those things
[57:52] oh brother matthew this doesn't sound
[57:54] like some big deep revelation well if
[57:56] we're not being faithful to the little
[57:58] things just like the prophet always said
[58:00] how in the world am i going to teach you
[58:02] algebra if you won't learn your abcs
[58:05] oh my we live in an age of such pressure
[58:07] and demand on the flesh and the time
[58:09] that we're living in i wonder if we were
[58:11] to calculate it all up and if we were to
[58:13] add it how many times you're on the
[58:15] internet versus how many hours you spend
[58:17] in prayer how many times are you looking
[58:19] at these other things of the world and
[58:21] i'm not even saying they have to be sin
[58:24] it could be talking to friends it could
[58:25] be talking to loved ones it could be
[58:27] shopping it could be uh looking to buy
[58:30] things you know there's so much in this
[58:32] world now
[58:34] to entertain you there's so much in you
[58:37] to build your portfolio and to pin this
[58:39] here and to like this and to follow this
[58:41] and you find out that if you're not
[58:43] careful you're on some of these social
[58:45] media platforms and you know what
[58:47] everybody else is doing
[58:49] but you don't even know what the lord
[58:51] god is doing in your own life
[58:53] i know where so and so is i know where
[58:54] they're on vacation i know where they
[58:56] went to all i know about those church
[58:58] meetings over there and then you find
[59:00] out that in your own life you're not
[59:02] bearing the fruits of christ because so
[59:04] you're so involved with everybody else's
[59:06] life and now the word of the lord is
[59:08] coming and telling you that you've got
[59:10] to constantly remain in the life of
[59:13] christ constantly being in revival
[59:18] god help us to be faithful in these
[59:20] little things
[59:22] we're talking about being an overcomer
[59:25] oh because if you just lay around and
[59:26] you don't do these things you become
[59:28] doty you become rotten and often you
[59:31] find yourself in a position or making a
[59:33] decision or something like that and you
[59:35] wonder like how did i even get here
[59:37] i thought i was past this i thought i
[59:39] was beyond this
[59:41] and oh then the devil starts to heap on
[59:43] that that condemnation and that
[59:44] conviction onto your life because you
[59:46] start to question oh do i really have it
[59:49] you start to question your experience
[59:51] with god because oh what did the prophet
[59:53] say the devil has a punch coming
[59:56] and if we're not guarding ourselves well
[59:58] how do you guard yourself brother
[59:59] matthew oh you guard yourself by the
[1:00:02] word of god being obedient to the word
[1:00:04] of god staying in prayer staying in
[1:00:06] fellowship staying in the word oh paul
[1:00:09] would say it like this he'd say this i
[1:00:10] say then walk in the spirit and you
[1:00:13] shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh
[1:00:17] of church we need to get in the spirit
[1:00:20] if you walk in the spirit you will not
[1:00:22] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:00:24] that's right
[1:00:27] oh the prophet of god said
[1:00:29] when you get in the spirit
[1:00:31] then you see the vision
[1:00:34] i was like well you see the vision what
[1:00:36] are you talking about well the prophet
[1:00:38] said
[1:00:39] that the vision is the word of the lord
[1:00:44] and the word of the lord comes to the
[1:00:46] prophet
[1:00:48] therefore this message is the very
[1:00:50] vision for your life
[1:00:52] the word says where there is no vision
[1:00:55] that people perish god has not left you
[1:00:58] without a vision god has not left you
[1:01:00] without a purpose god hasn't left the
[1:01:02] bride here wondering what's going on or
[1:01:04] what's going to happen where did i come
[1:01:06] from where did i go but god has revealed
[1:01:09] the whole secret purpose of his mind to
[1:01:11] the bride of jesus christ and she knows
[1:01:13] where she's standing she has the mind of
[1:01:16] god she has thus saith the lord or she
[1:01:18] stands still
[1:01:21] come on now
[1:01:22] oh we're talking about being overcomers
[1:01:24] about living in the spirit
[1:01:29] the prophet would say that overcome
[1:01:31] means to recognize the devil
[1:01:34] and every single one of his tricks
[1:01:37] but he didn't leave it there
[1:01:40] there's a lot of people that can
[1:01:41] recognize the devil they can recognize
[1:01:43] the silent times that we're living and
[1:01:44] they can look out there and and see the
[1:01:46] political scene and the sickness and
[1:01:48] everything that's in the land and they
[1:01:49] can recognize the devil is on a tear
[1:01:52] well they can point it out and look at
[1:01:54] how
[1:01:55] corrupt everything is but he said an
[1:01:57] overcome means to recognize
[1:02:00] that greater is he that is in you
[1:02:03] than he that is in the world
[1:02:05] so yes you might recognize the devil in
[1:02:08] all of his tricks but we got to
[1:02:10] recognize and have a revelation to know
[1:02:12] that greater is he that is in you than
[1:02:15] he that is in the world
[1:02:20] the prophet would go on to say this we
[1:02:22] see this age that we're living in
[1:02:25] it's one of the grandest ages
[1:02:27] of all ages
[1:02:29] this lady you'll see a church age is the
[1:02:31] grandest of all the church ages
[1:02:34] because it's the ending of time
[1:02:37] and the blending
[1:02:39] of eternity
[1:02:41] and then it's the greatest sinful age
[1:02:45] it's more
[1:02:46] sin in this age than there's ever been
[1:02:53] well i'm not going to debate that nor
[1:02:55] would i ever debate with the prophet
[1:02:57] right
[1:02:59] not to go on a tangent but it's funny
[1:03:00] how some people can
[1:03:04] it's more sin in this age than there
[1:03:06] ever been
[1:03:07] and the powers of satan
[1:03:10] is many times harder to fight against
[1:03:13] than it was in any age now we're looking
[1:03:17] at our text here it says to him
[1:03:19] that overcometh will i grant to sit with
[1:03:22] me and my throne even as i also
[1:03:25] overcame
[1:03:28] well to be an overcomer you have to have
[1:03:31] something
[1:03:32] to overcome
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:35] to be an overcomer you have to have
[1:03:37] something to overcome and here the
[1:03:39] prophet is showing us that the age that
[1:03:41] we're living in there's never been an
[1:03:43] age with more sin there's never been an
[1:03:45] age that has had such darkness upon it
[1:03:50] he said the the power of satan is harder
[1:03:52] to fight against than it was in any age
[1:03:56] that there ever was oh my it makes me
[1:03:59] think of the the prophet isaiah there in
[1:04:02] uh uh
[1:04:03] chapter 61 verse two and he say in gross
[1:04:05] darkness upon the land and gross
[1:04:07] darkness upon the people the prophet
[1:04:09] would pick that up and say that is a
[1:04:11] prophecy concerning the day and age that
[1:04:14] we're living in and he would tie that
[1:04:16] scripture there in the beginning of how
[1:04:18] the world laid there in darkness and
[1:04:20] chaos
[1:04:22] he said the earth was without form and
[1:04:24] it was without void
[1:04:27] but oh underneath all of that chaos
[1:04:29] underneath all of that darkness that was
[1:04:32] laying there there was a spoken word
[1:04:34] seed that was laying there and something
[1:04:37] had this transpired in the midst of all
[1:04:39] of that darkness for the seed and that
[1:04:42] life that was laying there on the bottom
[1:04:44] of all of that chaos and all of that
[1:04:46] darkness and the scripture would read
[1:04:47] like this it would say
[1:04:49] that and the spirit of god moved upon
[1:04:53] the face of the waters and god said let
[1:04:56] there be light and there was light oh i
[1:04:58] see oh god may the spirit of god move
[1:05:01] upon me move upon my life move upon my
[1:05:04] chaos move upon my family move upon my
[1:05:07] friends live upon my family lord move
[1:05:09] upon my day from waking to envy lord i
[1:05:12] want to constantly live in revival oh
[1:05:15] god may your spirit move upon me
[1:05:18] oh we see all the darkness we see all
[1:05:20] the chaos out there
[1:05:24] but in that same scripture what does it
[1:05:26] say arise and shine for thy light has
[1:05:29] come it says gross darkness upon the
[1:05:32] land and gross darkness upon the people
[1:05:34] but the prophet ties that together with
[1:05:36] ezekiel or zechariah 14 he says that
[1:05:41] in the evening time
[1:05:43] oh there's going to be a day
[1:05:46] that's neither day or night
[1:05:48] he said it's because of the presence of
[1:05:51] the darkness
[1:05:52] and the presence of the light
[1:05:55] that makes it a day that's neither day
[1:05:57] or night but he said in the evening time
[1:06:00] oh it shall be light you don't have to
[1:06:02] worry and fret because of the condition
[1:06:04] of the world you don't have to worry
[1:06:06] about these uh diseases and things that
[1:06:08] are going through the world you don't
[1:06:10] have to be sitting there and wondering
[1:06:12] about your job am i ever going to be
[1:06:13] able to pay my bills am i ever going to
[1:06:15] be able to afford this or for that
[1:06:17] you're allowing the nervous tension of
[1:06:19] the age to pressing upon you but there
[1:06:21] is a message that is shining the gospel
[1:06:24] light that's saying arise and shine you
[1:06:27] are not called to be part of the
[1:06:28] darkness you are not called to be part
[1:06:30] of ladies here but god has called you
[1:06:32] out of the darkness he has called you to
[1:06:34] lie the message of the hour has come to
[1:06:37] quicken that seed inside of you and
[1:06:39] bring you forth alive
[1:06:41] oh thank god that the gospel light is
[1:06:44] shining in its full strength and power
[1:06:47] thank you jesus
[1:06:50] oh glory to god you don't have to be up
[1:06:53] and down
[1:06:54] you don't have to be in and out you got
[1:06:55] an anchor
[1:06:57] oh sure you might have trials you might
[1:06:59] have uh persecutions and disappointments
[1:07:02] and heartaches
[1:07:03] sickness and pain come on does anybody
[1:07:05] know what i'm talking about
[1:07:09] oh but there's an anchor there
[1:07:13] we're gonna have trials
[1:07:15] we're gonna have sickness
[1:07:17] we're gonna have pain
[1:07:20] but is that gonna discourage you from
[1:07:22] serving the lord
[1:07:23] are you gonna back up are you gonna quit
[1:07:26] well i was fellowship with brother aaron
[1:07:28] about that song i have decided
[1:07:32] to follow jesus
[1:07:34] oh my you know when you when you find
[1:07:36] out the meaning behind the songs you're
[1:07:38] singing oh it can it can well a well
[1:07:41] spring up inside of you oh it's about
[1:07:43] 150 years ago
[1:07:45] after the welsh revival had broken out
[1:07:48] there were some american baptist
[1:07:49] ministers uh they wanted to spread the
[1:07:51] gospel and so they went into the
[1:07:53] northeast part of india there and they
[1:07:55] were going to to spread the gospel into
[1:07:57] the tribes and uh you know those the
[1:07:59] tribal indians there they were they were
[1:08:01] primitive and they were very territorial
[1:08:03] and and then i believe it was the assam
[1:08:05] tribes up there in that region that they
[1:08:07] wanted to come into well i'm going to
[1:08:08] tell it and i don't know how
[1:08:10] they would get up in that region there
[1:08:12] and and these missionary baptists wanted
[1:08:15] to to preach the gospel of jesus christ
[1:08:17] a god of love a god of forgiveness
[1:08:20] and one of these missionaries had
[1:08:22] success he had found a family and this
[1:08:24] man he he was married and had two boys
[1:08:27] and he accepted jesus christ as a savior
[1:08:29] and he was living there in his tribe and
[1:08:32] and all of a sudden you know he that god
[1:08:34] was moving in his life and and he
[1:08:36] started to have an effect on the other
[1:08:37] people in his community and actually
[1:08:39] other people started
[1:08:42] to receive the gospel
[1:08:44] they started to believe on the lord
[1:08:46] jesus christ and it caused such a stir
[1:08:49] in the tribe and the community that the
[1:08:51] chief he called him and said hey come
[1:08:53] here and they had a town meeting right
[1:08:57] they said you're causing a lot of
[1:08:59] raucous you're kind of a lot of nonsense
[1:09:01] and he took this man this is a true
[1:09:03] story i'm told he took this man
[1:09:07] and his wife and his two kids and set
[1:09:09] them there before the city and said you
[1:09:11] must
[1:09:12] renounce your faith in jesus christ
[1:09:16] he said or i will kill you
[1:09:21] and his response as the holy ghost moved
[1:09:24] upon him
[1:09:25] he said i have decided
[1:09:28] to follow jesus
[1:09:31] and there the chief had given the signal
[1:09:33] and there the archers sent forth their
[1:09:35] ball and it struck both of his sons
[1:09:37] there and they fell over laying on their
[1:09:39] ground and they were twitching there in
[1:09:40] front of him
[1:09:42] and the chief looked at him and he said
[1:09:44] now
[1:09:45] i'll give you another chance
[1:09:47] to renounce your faith
[1:09:49] and jesus christ or your wife is next
[1:09:52] and the man standing there
[1:09:54] he looked up and said
[1:09:56] vo none go with me
[1:09:58] still i will follow
[1:10:01] and there the arrow struck his own wife
[1:10:04] and she was laying there
[1:10:07] and the chief looked at him and said
[1:10:09] i'll give you one chance more
[1:10:12] to renounce
[1:10:13] your faith
[1:10:15] in this jesus
[1:10:17] and there
[1:10:19] the man standing there
[1:10:22] in the face of death
[1:10:27] he said
[1:10:28] the cross before me
[1:10:31] the world behind me
[1:10:34] no
[1:10:35] turning back
[1:10:38] oh and as the story goes and arrow
[1:10:40] struck him and he laid down there and he
[1:10:42] died with his family you say what's the
[1:10:45] point of the of the story brother
[1:10:46] matthew well there's several points we
[1:10:49] can gain from it but that's man's
[1:10:50] devotion to his faith there struck that
[1:10:53] indian chief he sat there and thought
[1:10:55] how can a man
[1:10:57] allow his whole family to go by the way
[1:10:59] of the grave he thought this faith in
[1:11:02] jesus christ must be something real and
[1:11:05] he sought after it and he said i too
[1:11:08] will be a follower of jesus christ and
[1:11:10] the chief in the presence of the whole
[1:11:12] community fell down there and actually
[1:11:14] received the word
[1:11:17] in that hour
[1:11:19] jesus christ the same
[1:11:22] yesterday
[1:11:23] today and forever
[1:11:26] i wonder if we in the face of death
[1:11:29] can say as this man
[1:11:31] maybe in the face of your friends
[1:11:34] maybe in the face of your colleagues
[1:11:37] maybe you're at work and and people are
[1:11:40] are saying things
[1:11:42] just to try to get at you and they're
[1:11:43] they're trying to to see what you
[1:11:45] believe and they're trying to pull it
[1:11:46] out at you and maybe you're just being a
[1:11:48] little reluctantly you're like well
[1:11:49] maybe if i tell them exactly what i
[1:11:51] believe you know they're not going to
[1:11:52] befriend me anymore
[1:11:54] but i wonder
[1:11:56] if there's a life
[1:11:57] if there's a spirit inside of you that
[1:12:00] could say like this man that can say i
[1:12:03] have decided to follow jesus
[1:12:06] oh the cross before me the world behind
[1:12:09] me there's no turning back i want to
[1:12:12] tell you i made a decision a long time
[1:12:14] ago there's no turning back i'm going to
[1:12:17] come too far the devil's going to try to
[1:12:19] put you down he's going to try to put
[1:12:21] out that spirit of revival that's living
[1:12:23] inside of you people oh but you have
[1:12:25] made your decision why don't you just go
[1:12:27] ahead tell the devil there's no turning
[1:12:30] back i've come too far he's already done

[1:12:43] look at some people that are overcoming
[1:12:46] and lady garcia in the face of their
[1:12:49] jobs in the face of their friends in the
[1:12:51] face of adversity they're gonna tell
[1:12:53] that old devil i won't turn back

[1:13:27] oh glory to god

[1:13:32] decided
[1:13:35] to follow jesus
[1:13:38] oh in the face of adversity
[1:13:41] in the face of torment
[1:13:44] in the face of being brokenhearted
[1:13:49] i have decided
[1:13:50] yeah
[1:13:52] you know i i was
[1:13:54] under a little juniper tree if i could
[1:13:57] just be honest with you this week
[1:14:01] and i was just thinking about how
[1:14:03] maybe the way things are and
[1:14:06] maybe how things
[1:14:07] could be different
[1:14:09] and just
[1:14:10] maybe things that have transpired over
[1:14:12] the last
[1:14:13] few years you know and
[1:14:15] i started feeling down and
[1:14:17] i started feeling a little discouraged
[1:14:19] you know and
[1:14:20] and here
[1:14:22] you know god's
[1:14:23] puts a message on my heart the spirit of
[1:14:25] revival
[1:14:28] well all right
[1:14:30] the spirit of revival i was like well
[1:14:32] lord i need some reviving myself lord
[1:14:35] i need something to raise up within me
[1:14:37] lord i'm feeling a little down and i
[1:14:39] just i started thinking there in the
[1:14:40] word you know what did david do yeah
[1:14:43] david was discouraged one time
[1:14:47] and i was looking at that you know david
[1:14:49] had a lot more to be discouraged about
[1:14:50] than i did
[1:14:52] there he's coming back from the battle
[1:14:53] of ziklag there and he's coming back and
[1:14:56] and no no doubt as they're coming down
[1:14:58] the trail there they can see the smoke
[1:15:00] and the fire coming up and no doubt just
[1:15:02] their energy spent from being in battle
[1:15:04] and here they come to where uh their
[1:15:06] homes were and their families and their
[1:15:08] kids and everything has been taken
[1:15:12] everything is gone
[1:15:14] and his own men those mighty men that
[1:15:16] fought with david they were so grieved
[1:15:19] and so vets that they were even starting
[1:15:20] to speak of stoning david
[1:15:23] and here david all of his friends all of
[1:15:26] the ones he fought in battle with all
[1:15:28] the ones he had gone to church and had
[1:15:30] church service with and they'd sat with
[1:15:32] him on the front row and he was just
[1:15:34] wondering how am i going to make it
[1:15:35] another day the very ones that i've
[1:15:37] preached the meetings with they're
[1:15:38] talking about stoning me they're trying
[1:15:40] to kill my character they're trying to
[1:15:41] tell me i should have never led them to
[1:15:43] the battle we should have never went
[1:15:44] this way david it's all your fault
[1:15:46] that's the reason why we're in this mess
[1:15:50] and there david oh he's discouraged but
[1:15:52] oh we can learn a great principle of
[1:15:54] this
[1:15:55] david the scripture says encouraged
[1:15:57] himself in the lord
[1:16:00] david said now where's that he fought at
[1:16:03] go ahead and bring me the ephod
[1:16:05] i want to know what god says about it
[1:16:08] oh i believe that ought to be the heart
[1:16:10] cry of the believer if you're
[1:16:11] discouraged or you're going through
[1:16:13] something i want to tell you you want to
[1:16:15] find out what does god say about it what
[1:16:17] does god say about my condition what
[1:16:19] does god say about it
[1:16:22] you are not cast down you are not
[1:16:24] defeated what can separate you from the
[1:16:26] love of god if god before us who can be
[1:16:29] against us always that he will work all
[1:16:32] things out to the good to those who love
[1:16:34] god and are called according to this
[1:16:36] purpose well if i could encourage you
[1:16:38] with anything i want to tell you good's
[1:16:39] coming yes
[1:16:41] oh maybe you're in your darkest trial
[1:16:43] you have a broken heart you don't know
[1:16:45] how you're going to make it another day
[1:16:46] oh but i want to be like david did i
[1:16:49] want to look into the word of god i want
[1:16:51] to say what is god saying god god says
[1:16:53] good's coming he said i'll never leave
[1:16:55] you i'll never forsake you but i'll be
[1:16:58] with you i'll even be with you until the
[1:17:00] end of the work good is coming
[1:17:03] oh my god is good he's real and he has
[1:17:06] something special in store for you
[1:17:09] oh you can encourage your heart you can
[1:17:11] comfort your heart with these words to
[1:17:13] know that jesus christ has your best
[1:17:16] interest in mind
[1:17:18] jesus would say it like this in the
[1:17:20] world
[1:17:21] you shall have tribulation
[1:17:24] but be of good cheer
[1:17:26] i have overcome the world
[1:17:29] oh greater is he that is in you oh let
[1:17:31] that sink down now
[1:17:33] greater is he that is in you
[1:17:36] the scripture would say something like
[1:17:37] this don't go out there and look for the
[1:17:39] kingdom way off somewhere
[1:17:41] jesus said don't go out there and look
[1:17:43] for the kingdom where is the kingdom of
[1:17:44] god
[1:17:45] the kingdom of god is within you
[1:17:49] oh you want to know why you can
[1:17:50] constantly live in revival
[1:17:53] oh come on church
[1:17:55] you can live in revival every day
[1:17:57] because jesus christ the kingdom of
[1:18:00] heaven the word of god has made its
[1:18:02] abode right there in your heart
[1:18:06] oh thank you jesus
[1:18:08] oh
[1:18:10] my
[1:18:11] how can i overcome
[1:18:14] god has called you
[1:18:16] to be an overcomer
[1:18:18] and the scriptures would say like this
[1:18:20] in matthew 3 11 you say i indeed baptize
[1:18:22] you
[1:18:23] with water under
[1:18:24] repentance
[1:18:26] but he that cometh after me
[1:18:28] is mightier than i
[1:18:32] oh look i can baptize you
[1:18:35] the brothers can baptize you
[1:18:39] you can be baptized by good church
[1:18:40] services
[1:18:45] but he that cometh after me
[1:18:48] is mightier than i
[1:18:54] he that cometh after me
[1:18:57] is mightier than i
[1:19:00] we want to build on our experience
[1:19:01] church
[1:19:02] we want to build on the word of god
[1:19:04] that's being revealed in our lives and
[1:19:07] know that god has more force maybe
[1:19:09] you've come to a place of justification
[1:19:11] maybe you've come to a place of
[1:19:12] sanctification but god is wanting to
[1:19:15] baptize you with the holy ghost he says
[1:19:17] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[1:19:20] than i oh he shall baptize you with the
[1:19:23] holy ghost and fire i was just dwelling
[1:19:25] on that oh i just love the principle of
[1:19:27] fire brother branham tells that story
[1:19:29] about the little turtle right he said he
[1:19:31] got a hold of that turtle and he wanted
[1:19:32] to make that turtle move so what did he
[1:19:34] do he started to beat it with the willow
[1:19:36] stick he started to tell that little
[1:19:39] turtle hey this is how you ought to
[1:19:40] dress you shouldn't cut your hair you
[1:19:42] should wear long dresses you shouldn't
[1:19:43] wear splits in them you know you should
[1:19:45] go to church on sunday and wednesday
[1:19:47] starting to give the message to it lay
[1:19:49] it over to that turtle over and over and
[1:19:51] over and as long as he laid that out to
[1:19:53] that turtle that turtle wouldn't even
[1:19:55] move
[1:19:56] well maybe i'll take the turtle on down
[1:19:58] to the water i'll go ahead and baptize
[1:20:01] it in the water i'll go take it down to
[1:20:03] some meetings i'll go ahead and get it
[1:20:05] in the atmosphere and i'll just see if i
[1:20:07] can get this turtle to move and he went
[1:20:09] down there and he dunked the turtle in
[1:20:10] the water and pulled it out but nothing
[1:20:12] would move that turtle he just was sank
[1:20:15] back in that shell
[1:20:16] oh but i like how he tells a story you
[1:20:18] know then i got the idea i went to go
[1:20:21] ahead and build me a little fire under
[1:20:22] it and when i built that little fire and
[1:20:24] i set that turtle on top of that fire
[1:20:27] all of a sudden he began to move oh you
[1:20:30] don't have to beg it to go to church you
[1:20:32] ain't got to plead with him to go to
[1:20:33] church you ain't got to tell her how to
[1:20:35] dress right you ain't got to tell her
[1:20:36] how to act right there is a fire that is
[1:20:39] shut up in your pose that's causing you
[1:20:41] to act right it's causing you to talk
[1:20:43] right it's causing you to refute the
[1:20:45] devil on any stance he'll take against
[1:20:47] you and tell him that this message is
[1:20:48] true i'm not backing up i'm not giving
[1:20:51] way
[1:20:53] oh there's a fire in me there's a spirit
[1:20:55] of revival
[1:20:59] it wasn't given to me by my mama it
[1:21:01] wasn't given to me by my daddy it wasn't
[1:21:03] given to me my church it wasn't giving
[1:21:05] me to myself campground oh many times
[1:21:08] when you think about a revival
[1:21:10] maybe you start to think about the camp
[1:21:12] services we've had some mighty camps
[1:21:14] we've had some mighty special meetings
[1:21:17] power of god moved down amongst us
[1:21:21] oh we witnessed the supernatural
[1:21:24] but you know
[1:21:26] when when the lights are shut off
[1:21:31] and everybody's gone home
[1:21:34] where's the spirit of revival then
[1:21:39] where is the fire of god then
[1:21:42] it's a good question to ask
[1:21:46] where is the fire
[1:21:48] but he that cometh after me
[1:21:51] is mightier than i
[1:21:53] he shall baptize you
[1:21:55] with the holy ghost in fire
[1:22:00] of the very life of god
[1:22:03] oh my i'm thankful for the atmosphere
[1:22:05] that god creates when his people get
[1:22:07] together
[1:22:10] things can happen
[1:22:12] people are wondering what has happened
[1:22:14] to these people
[1:22:15] why are the people acting different what
[1:22:18] what's what's causing all this ruckus
[1:22:20] why are these young people giving their
[1:22:22] lives to god why they're renouncing all
[1:22:24] the things of the world
[1:22:29] it's because they've got fire in them
[1:22:31] there's a spirit of revival that's broke
[1:22:33] out in them
[1:22:35] there's something that's changed and
[1:22:36] there's something that made makes them
[1:22:38] different
[1:22:40] i'm not talking about some strange fire
[1:22:42] like in leviticus 10 where where the
[1:22:45] priest offered some strange fire before
[1:22:47] the lord
[1:22:48] the prophet of god said that's
[1:22:49] denominational fire this ain't no
[1:22:51] denominational fire this is the power of
[1:22:54] god to transform a life
[1:22:56] this is that great ish oh in sunlight
[1:22:59] that would shine down upon a
[1:23:00] predestinated seed and bring all the
[1:23:02] potentials that was lying in the seed to
[1:23:04] the manifestation of what god called it
[1:23:06] to be
[1:23:07] that's what we're seeing in this hour
[1:23:09] we're ripening in the presence of the
[1:23:11] sun and we're seeing sons and daughters
[1:23:13] coming into their position coming into
[1:23:15] the maturity and manifested the word
[1:23:18] that has been spoken by malachi 4 5
[1:23:20] that's what this is all about
[1:23:22] this is the word take it on flesh the
[1:23:25] prophet of god would say this he would
[1:23:26] say you call for revivals
[1:23:29] you wait for your church to have a
[1:23:31] revival well that ain't the revival for
[1:23:33] you the revival ought to begin right in
[1:23:37] you
[1:23:39] when you begin to thirst for god there
[1:23:41] might not be another member of the
[1:23:43] church wanting the revival
[1:23:45] it breaks out
[1:23:47] in you and if it breaks out of you he
[1:23:49] says it'll break out in other places oh
[1:23:52] my praise god if it breaks out in you
[1:23:56] it'll break out in other places what
[1:23:58] does that mean i'm not talking about an
[1:24:00] event
[1:24:02] i'm not talking about a church building
[1:24:05] i'm not talking about a place where
[1:24:07] revival started but i'm talking about a
[1:24:09] people the bible says the angel of the
[1:24:12] lord and campeth round about them that
[1:24:15] fear him and deliver them oh i'm talking
[1:24:18] about the purchase blood pot redeemed
[1:24:21] saints of almighty god oh you say
[1:24:24] brother matthew how dare you say the
[1:24:26] angel of the lord is here that was
[1:24:28] reversed special for the prophet no i'm
[1:24:30] quoting the bible the bible said i want
[1:24:32] to ask you this morning do you believe
[1:24:34] the bible do you believe the word of the
[1:24:36] god it says the angel of the lord
[1:24:40] encampeth round about them that fear him
[1:24:43] and deliver them that means the angel of
[1:24:45] the lord is here oh come on the prophet
[1:24:48] of god said god still sends his men with
[1:24:51] the angel before them to prepare the way
[1:24:54] oh you want to wonder why we have such a
[1:24:56] good time you want to wonder why there's
[1:24:59] a revival you want to wonder why why
[1:25:01] because the angel of the lord is here
[1:25:03] the angels are here and camping around
[1:25:06] about the saints of god
[1:25:13] oh hallelujah it ain't the church
[1:25:15] building that brought the angel
[1:25:18] come on now
[1:25:19] it ain't the church building that
[1:25:21] brought
[1:25:22] the revival
[1:25:24] it ain't the campground that brought the
[1:25:26] angel
[1:25:28] it's god's people
[1:25:30] getting together and a divine promise
[1:25:33] from almighty god that said where two or
[1:25:35] three are gathered there i'll be in
[1:25:37] their midst oh what do you expect to
[1:25:39] happen you're there in the presence of
[1:25:41] almighty god what do you expect to
[1:25:43] happen when the angel of the lord comes
[1:25:45] what do you expect to happen when jesus
[1:25:48] christ shows up on the scene and he
[1:25:50] means business oh come on now people
[1:25:52] will be in bondage they'll be set free
[1:25:54] people are being bonded to pornography
[1:25:56] they'll be set free people will be sick
[1:25:59] they will be delivered wow because
[1:26:01] that's a divine promise from almighty
[1:26:03] god
[1:26:05] oh that's why
[1:26:06] it's not because what i've done it's all
[1:26:08] because of what he's done
[1:26:10] that's the reason for it
[1:26:13] oh praise god
[1:26:15] he said these signs shall follow them
[1:26:17] that belief
[1:26:19] oh in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:26:23] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:26:25] they shall recover

[1:26:42] who led the children of israel by a
[1:26:43] pillar of fire
[1:26:45] and a cloud by
[1:26:46] day
[1:26:47] is here this morning
[1:26:50] amen
[1:26:51] the same jesus who was walking down the
[1:26:53] street one time
[1:26:55] and the crowd was all around him
[1:26:57] and people were throwing it upon him and
[1:26:59] touching them all sudden jesus stopped
[1:27:00] and said who touched me
[1:27:03] who touched me the disciples are
[1:27:04] wondering what do you mean lord who
[1:27:06] touched you there's people everywhere he
[1:27:08] said no
[1:27:10] i perceive virtue has gone from me
[1:27:14] and there was a lady
[1:27:16] who had had a blood issue i believe for
[1:27:17] 12 years that had reached out
[1:27:19] and touched the hem of his garment
[1:27:23] and she was healed
[1:27:25] well that's what i'm saying i'm saying
[1:27:26] the same jesus
[1:27:28] the same jesus christ is here right now
[1:27:32] so then what about your problem
[1:27:34] what about your sickness what about your
[1:27:36] trial what about your discouragement
[1:27:39] i'm telling you jesus christ is passing
[1:27:41] by
[1:27:42] well if we can just have a faith in our
[1:27:44] heart now
[1:27:45] to take god at his word and say oh my
[1:27:47] maybe i've been in a lot of services
[1:27:49] before maybe i've been but tonight's
[1:27:51] this morning's my time this is my turn
[1:27:54] i'm going to reach out i'm going to
[1:27:56] touch the end of his garment because
[1:27:57] i've heard the word go forth and it says
[1:27:59] that the angel of the lord is here that
[1:28:02] he encampeth round about those that fear
[1:28:04] it and he delivereth them that means my
[1:28:06] god is in the building so whenever you
[1:28:08] and i meet him i'm asking i'm telling
[1:28:10] somebody whatever you have needed this
[1:28:12] morning why don't you just go ahead and
[1:28:14] claim it why don't you just go ahead and
[1:28:16] accept it why don't you just go ahead
[1:28:17] and reach out because jesus christ is
[1:28:20] passing by your way
[1:28:22] oh the same god
[1:28:24] that part of the red sea
[1:28:26] the same god that spoke to elijah said i
[1:28:28] have commanded a widow woman to sustain
[1:28:31] thee
[1:28:32] hear a widow woman
[1:28:34] about to make two cakes and die
[1:28:38] this story don't even make sense
[1:28:42] what do you mean you've commanded a
[1:28:44] woman to sustain my life who doesn't
[1:28:47] even know she's been commanded and
[1:28:48] doesn't even have the substance to
[1:28:50] sustain me
[1:28:53] the same
[1:28:54] god that could command a widow woman who
[1:28:58] is about to eat two cakes and die
[1:29:01] to sustain a prophet is the same god i'm
[1:29:04] talking about when the prophet come down
[1:29:06] there and said oh give me something to
[1:29:08] drink and now she turned away
[1:29:12] maybe she could have handled that
[1:29:14] but go ahead and bring me a cake first
[1:29:19] oh but
[1:29:20] what do you mean
[1:29:22] see she didn't even realize she was part
[1:29:24] of the predestinated plan of god
[1:29:27] she didn't even realize that the word
[1:29:29] had already commanded her to sustain the
[1:29:32] prophet's message oh come on now
[1:29:35] you didn't even know that you were
[1:29:36] laying here lady elsia there was a seed
[1:29:39] of god that he had planted but god had
[1:29:41] commanded these stones god had commanded
[1:29:44] these seeds you wouldn't even know that
[1:29:46] you were called by god you didn't even
[1:29:48] know that you were elected and you were
[1:29:50] chosen but the word of god had
[1:29:52] prophesied the word of god had been
[1:29:54] spoken and the word went forth and there
[1:29:57] is a pride to receive that word and all
[1:29:59] of a sudden she said all right
[1:30:01] nonetheless i will give it to you first
[1:30:04] oh and that's what the bride of jesus
[1:30:05] christ is doing although none go with me
[1:30:08] still i will follow i will give my whole
[1:30:10] heart to this message i'll follow with
[1:30:12] everything that's within me if my daddy
[1:30:14] falls away so be it if my mommy falls
[1:30:17] away so be it if my church falls away
[1:30:20] i'm not giving up i'm not backing up i
[1:30:23] have decided to follow jesus i am going
[1:30:25] on with god i'll keep believing them
[1:30:27] until the chains of my body and if i go
[1:30:29] into the grave i'm coming out again
[1:30:32] because the spirit of revival is shown
[1:30:34] up in my bones
[1:30:36] oh glory to god
[1:30:39] hallelujah
[1:30:40] it's not i'd have heaven but christ
[1:30:43] liveth in me
[1:30:45] praise the lord
[1:30:48] glory to god
[1:30:53] oh hallelujah
[1:30:55] if that same spirit church
[1:30:58] that raised up jesus christ from the
[1:31:00] dead dwell in you
[1:31:03] it shall quicken
[1:31:05] your mortal body
[1:31:07] it shall quicken
[1:31:09] your mortal body
[1:31:11] that ain't just limited to the grave
[1:31:14] but when you get that quickening power
[1:31:16] on you
[1:31:17] oh my something begins to happen
[1:31:21] it begins to change the way that you act
[1:31:23] it begins to change the way that you
[1:31:25] think it becomes to change the way that
[1:31:27] you talk
[1:31:28] does anybody know what i'm talking about
[1:31:31] oh i've been there
[1:31:33] i've been there all the spirit of god if
[1:31:35] it dwell in you it shall quicken your
[1:31:37] mortal bodies the prophet would say this
[1:31:39] out of perfect faith
[1:31:40] he was saying now we become anointed
[1:31:43] with that same spirit
[1:31:46] anointed messiahs
[1:31:47] messiahs of the last day to shine forth
[1:31:50] the resurrection of jesus christ to show
[1:31:52] that he is not dead but in the form of
[1:31:55] the holy ghost
[1:31:56] he's in his people
[1:32:00] moving among his bride
[1:32:02] with a love affair to her pouring out
[1:32:04] into her himself they are becoming one
[1:32:07] for the wedding supper the same signs
[1:32:10] promised by the same god and the same
[1:32:12] word is making the same manifestations
[1:32:16] oh praise god church you have been
[1:32:18] anointed
[1:32:19] this is a reality this ain't a hope so
[1:32:21] message
[1:32:23] i'm not i'm not wondering
[1:32:27] abraham wasn't wondering if he was going
[1:32:30] to have a promised son
[1:32:32] he was expecting
[1:32:34] the promised son
[1:32:36] the bride is not wondering
[1:32:40] she's expecting
[1:32:42] why because she's been impregnated with
[1:32:45] the word
[1:32:46] we have received the word in this hour
[1:32:51] oh what did the prophet say
[1:32:53] he said here is the secret
[1:32:56] here is the secret the word is in the
[1:32:58] bride
[1:33:01] as it was in mary
[1:33:03] what
[1:33:06] you ever think about that he's speaking
[1:33:08] to you
[1:33:10] here is the secret
[1:33:11] the word is in you
[1:33:14] as it was in mary
[1:33:16] that means that word that is in you is
[1:33:18] going to bring forth none other than
[1:33:20] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:33:22] and forever
[1:33:23] well how did it get there
[1:33:25] how did it get there all i know is that
[1:33:27] when the angel
[1:33:30] came to mary
[1:33:31] and
[1:33:32] told her the message she said be it unto
[1:33:34] me according to thy word
[1:33:37] thou art highly favored
[1:33:40] among women
[1:33:42] god has placed his word seed inside of
[1:33:45] it of you you don't have to struggle
[1:33:47] with that church you don't have to
[1:33:49] wonder you don't have to wonder if
[1:33:50] you're in or out or is that is the
[1:33:52] message for me god placed that word
[1:33:54] inside of you
[1:33:56] oh he chose you before the foundation of
[1:33:58] the world
[1:33:59] he elected you he called you he placed
[1:34:01] his word in there and what he's wanting
[1:34:03] you to do is say lord be it unto me
[1:34:06] according to thy word
[1:34:10] oh maybe you say brother matthew you
[1:34:12] don't understand
[1:34:14] i you've you've come to you've come too
[1:34:17] late i've made too many mistakes
[1:34:19] i've fallen this spirit of revival
[1:34:21] you're talking about i was living in
[1:34:22] revival
[1:34:24] i had it in my life
[1:34:26] and i see people rejoicing in the
[1:34:28] presence of the lord
[1:34:29] and i want to get back into the presence
[1:34:31] i want to get i want to get my life
[1:34:33] right but i've just missed my
[1:34:34] opportunity
[1:34:36] you know it kind of reminds me
[1:34:38] of when i was a little boy i was at some
[1:34:40] some camp services
[1:34:42] it's a place down in dry creek louisiana
[1:34:44] maybe some of y'all have heard about it
[1:34:46] they have some camp services down there
[1:34:48] and and i had an experience with the
[1:34:49] lord
[1:34:50] but i had come back from that and though
[1:34:53] i had an experience and i i had felt the
[1:34:55] presence and something had taken place i
[1:34:57] knew it was real but i came back and i
[1:34:59] didn't feed the fire
[1:35:02] i didn't i didn't feed the fire and i
[1:35:04] found out after a little bit a while
[1:35:06] that you know that that revival fire had
[1:35:08] went out
[1:35:11] but i'm so thankful for that god never
[1:35:13] gave up on me
[1:35:16] but god was waiting there until i would
[1:35:18] come to that time of a full surrender
[1:35:20] and i want to just be a word of
[1:35:21] encouragement to you god has not given
[1:35:24] up on you
[1:35:26] maybe you're sitting in this church
[1:35:27] service right now and you're feeling all
[1:35:28] alone and you feel like you missed your
[1:35:31] chance and you missed your opportunity
[1:35:32] but i'm giving you the word of the lord
[1:35:34] to tell you that you haven't missed your
[1:35:36] chance you haven't missed your
[1:35:37] opportunity god has not given up on you
[1:35:40] he's just wanting you to accept him he's
[1:35:43] just wanting you to take him out of your
[1:35:44] way he's oh but what about all my faults
[1:35:46] brother matthew what about all my
[1:35:48] failures what about all the things that
[1:35:50] i've done what does the scripture say
[1:35:52] therefore is now no condemnation to them
[1:35:55] who are in christ jesus
[1:35:58] oh my bible tells me sin will not have
[1:36:01] dominion over you
[1:36:02] i want to encourage you i don't care how
[1:36:04] far you've fallen god said sin will not
[1:36:08] have dominion over you that is the
[1:36:10] reason he died at calvary he paid the
[1:36:12] penalty for that sin so that you don't
[1:36:14] have to keep living in condemnation
[1:36:17] oh it's not too late this is the time
[1:36:19] this is the hour that god is calling you
[1:36:22] he's wanting to revive you he's wanting
[1:36:24] that spirit of revival to come upon your
[1:36:27] life and put you in action

[1:36:43] your walk
[1:36:44] the word tells us
[1:36:48] that only the elect can be reborn
[1:36:52] right
[1:36:52] the prophet of god says that in the
[1:36:54] church book he says in non-seed there's
[1:36:56] nothing to be quickened
[1:36:59] so i don't care where you're at god
[1:37:01] placed that seed here is the secret the
[1:37:03] word
[1:37:04] is in you as it was in mary there is
[1:37:06] something that god is wanting to quicken
[1:37:09] inside of you if you can just forsake
[1:37:11] your faults forsake your failures
[1:37:14] forsake your own ideas forsake whatever
[1:37:16] it is that's holding you back why don't
[1:37:18] you just go ahead and get the victory
[1:37:20] this morning and say once and for all
[1:37:22] i'm going to lay it all down lord jesus
[1:37:24] i know that i gave up on you but you
[1:37:27] never gave up on me and right now i'm
[1:37:29] going to turn my heart back to you god
[1:37:31] and say i'm coming lord i'm coming with
[1:37:33] everything that's in me oh just fill me
[1:37:35] with that spirit of god set my heart on
[1:37:37] fire let the spirit of god revival break
[1:37:40] out on me oh and i know if it breaks out
[1:37:42] in me it'll break out in other places
[1:37:44] it'll break out in my family it might
[1:37:46] break out in my job it might break out
[1:37:48] of my school but oh god just set me on
[1:37:50] fire lord let me be living in the spirit
[1:37:52] of god oh constantly living in revival
[1:37:57] oh it's for you church you can have it
[1:38:00] the scripture says and be not drunk with
[1:38:02] wine wearing an access
[1:38:04] but be filled
[1:38:06] with the spirit
[1:38:08] oh i like how it runs off of that it
[1:38:10] says be not drunk with wine well the
[1:38:13] next statement is saying we're in an
[1:38:15] access but be filled with the spirit
[1:38:16] that means there's some stimulation of
[1:38:18] this revelation
[1:38:20] oh you ever seen a drunk man i was
[1:38:22] staying at a hotel not too long ago i
[1:38:25] saw some guy walking through the parking
[1:38:27] lot and my goodness gracious he couldn't
[1:38:29] even walk a straight line

[1:39:46] hallelujah
[1:39:48] well the devil keeps trying to tell me
[1:39:50] i'm just trying to work up the people
[1:39:52] you're just trying to work up the people
[1:39:54] you're just trying to get them all
[1:39:56] excited
[1:39:57] oh my you know there's a spirit out
[1:39:59] there that wants to kill your influence
[1:40:01] there's a spirit out there that wants to
[1:40:03] kill this revival
[1:40:04] that's why the word of the lord is
[1:40:06] coming to you and it's saying don't let
[1:40:09] that spirit of revival die
[1:40:12] why because the devil hates it
[1:40:15] why because you're tormenting demons
[1:40:17] you're shaking the walls of hell because
[1:40:20] he knows someday in a moment in a
[1:40:23] twinkling of an eye there's going to be
[1:40:25] a people that are changed you're going
[1:40:27] to put death under your feet it'll be
[1:40:29] swallowed up in victory oh great where
[1:40:32] is your victory oh death where is your
[1:40:35] skin
[1:40:37] hallelujah
[1:40:38] glory why don't you praise the lord
[1:40:43] hallelujah
[1:40:46] oh glory
[1:40:48] you can't be shut up church
[1:40:51] you're going to be taken up
[1:40:53] you can't be shut up you're going up
[1:40:56] oh praise the lord
[1:40:59] the prophet of god would say this
[1:41:02] hallelujah
[1:41:05] he said it takes the spirit of god
[1:41:08] to bring life
[1:41:09] and that life must not come
[1:41:11] out of just
[1:41:13] the intellectual revival
[1:41:15] well glory to god brother aaron you're
[1:41:17] telling me you can have an intellectual
[1:41:18] revival
[1:41:20] i guess you can the prophet just said it
[1:41:24] he said
[1:41:26] the life must not come out of just the
[1:41:29] intellectual revival
[1:41:31] you know there's a whole lot of kind of
[1:41:32] revivals out there
[1:41:36] but the bride
[1:41:38] is interested in just one kind of
[1:41:39] revival
[1:41:42] there's only one revival the bride is
[1:41:43] interested in
[1:41:45] he said it got to come out of the bible
[1:41:48] word revival
[1:41:50] and that word is the same yesterday
[1:41:52] today and forever and when it falls
[1:41:54] today it quickens you get the same
[1:41:57] results you did in acts 2
[1:42:00] always has and always will be because
[1:42:02] it's the spirit of god that conditions
[1:42:05] the atmosphere
[1:42:06] oh glory to god
[1:42:08] oh my stick around a little bit
[1:42:11] there's an atmosphere here
[1:42:13] it takes the atmosphere to do things
[1:42:17] that's the reason you men are always
[1:42:19] taught bring your children here
[1:42:21] well certainly that's right i was glad
[1:42:23] to see my daughter rebecca come in and
[1:42:25] sit down just a few minutes ago
[1:42:27] some of you seen me wink out a woman it
[1:42:29] was my daughter so she come in and sat
[1:42:31] down now listen to this is the prophet
[1:42:34] listen what he's saying here he's saying
[1:42:36] i want her to receive
[1:42:38] the baptism of the spirit and that's why
[1:42:41] she is here
[1:42:43] in the meeting
[1:42:46] that's the purpose of it
[1:42:49] it takes atmosphere
[1:42:52] well people can go on and criticize
[1:42:56] they can go ahead and call us fanatics
[1:42:58] they can call us holy rollers but my
[1:43:01] prophet told me that it takes atmosphere
[1:43:04] to bring forth a birth
[1:43:06] and when you get god's people together
[1:43:09] and they start singing the praises of
[1:43:11] almighty god and you know that by divine
[1:43:14] promise the angel of god is in the
[1:43:16] building
[1:43:18] now just for a little side note here you
[1:43:20] know the devil always wants to cause you
[1:43:22] to to doubt the word of god
[1:43:24] what do you mean brother matthew the
[1:43:26] angel the lord is in the building you
[1:43:28] know there's a bunch of y'all having
[1:43:29] church all over the world
[1:43:31] how can the angel of the lord be in
[1:43:33] every place at the same time well i just
[1:43:35] got to thinking about it well like you
[1:43:37] know devil
[1:43:38] i mean
[1:43:39] i see maybe your reasoning point but i
[1:43:41] just thought you know i'm gonna look up
[1:43:43] and see how fast light travels
[1:43:46] and i looked it up and it said that in
[1:43:47] one second light can travel around the
[1:43:50] world seven and a half times and one
[1:43:52] second
[1:43:54] and i thought my certainly
[1:43:56] the one who created light
[1:43:58] can travel a whole lot faster than light
[1:44:01] so if it takes one second come on now if
[1:44:03] it takes one second for light to travel
[1:44:06] around the world seven and a half times
[1:44:08] oh god just needs a second he just needs
[1:44:11] a millisecond he'll flash this way or
[1:44:13] flash that way he'll come right down to
[1:44:15] your aisle right down your pew and he'll
[1:44:18] touch you and in a moment you'll be
[1:44:20] changed in a moment you'll be different
[1:44:23] all things will pass away all things
[1:44:26] will become new why just one moment in
[1:44:28] his presence everything will be
[1:44:30] different
[1:44:32] that's the god i serve
[1:44:34] oh my just a little bit of atmosphere
[1:44:38] all things are possible
[1:44:40] you realize right now
[1:44:43] where you're sitting
[1:44:45] you're sitting in the presence
[1:44:47] in an atmosphere
[1:44:49] where all things are possible
[1:44:52] well as we opened up the service
[1:44:54] the prophet is saying not just a
[1:44:56] revelation
[1:44:57] but revelation
[1:44:59] after revelation
[1:45:01] this is a word revival
[1:45:04] why do we purpose in our heart
[1:45:06] lord jesus
[1:45:08] i know you're not done with me
[1:45:11] i know you have more for me
[1:45:13] let's start being an expectation for the
[1:45:15] word to continue to unfold deeper and
[1:45:19] deeper greater and greater one baptism
[1:45:22] after another many baptisms many
[1:45:25] refillings revelation after revelations
[1:45:28] paul said i came not to you with
[1:45:29] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[1:45:32] power and demonstration
[1:45:35] right that's what we're talking about
[1:45:37] power and demonstration of the word
[1:45:40] just moving towards a close here really
[1:45:41] quick the word says in john 6 63 it says
[1:45:44] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:45:46] flesh profiteth nothing the words that i
[1:45:49] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[1:45:53] are life
[1:45:55] he said brother matthew what are you
[1:45:56] talking about what's moving this revival
[1:45:59] it's not an intellectual revival it's
[1:46:01] not an emotional revival
[1:46:03] oh sure if we just came to church and
[1:46:05] all we did was work up an atmosphere and
[1:46:08] and all we did is get a bunch of people
[1:46:10] excited
[1:46:12] then what then what are we doing yeah
[1:46:13] maybe we're just having an intellectual
[1:46:15] revival maybe we're just having a little
[1:46:17] bit of an emotional revival but all
[1:46:19] there is a people who have given the
[1:46:22] word first place in their life they have
[1:46:24] given the word preeminence and it is a
[1:46:26] word revival the bible says in matthew
[1:46:29] 24 27 it says for as the lightning
[1:46:32] cometh out of the east and shineth even
[1:46:34] unto the west so shall the coming of the
[1:46:37] son of man be for wheresoever the
[1:46:39] carcass is there will the eagles be
[1:46:42] gathered
[1:46:43] oh that's what we're gathered around
[1:46:45] we're gathered around the revealed word
[1:46:47] of the hour the prophet would say there
[1:46:49] in the first seal he says oh there's
[1:46:50] coming a messenger that's going to take
[1:46:52] all the loose ends he's going to tie him
[1:46:55] all together and what is it going to do
[1:46:57] it's going to reveal the whole secret of
[1:47:00] god and it's going to gather the bride
[1:47:02] together for the rapture for rapturing
[1:47:04] faith
[1:47:06] and then he comes there in the third
[1:47:08] seal
[1:47:09] and he says oh the bride has i had no
[1:47:11] revival yet
[1:47:13] here this is 1963's he's preaching the
[1:47:16] third seal
[1:47:18] he says the bride hasn't had no revival
[1:47:20] yet
[1:47:21] he says it's going to take those seven
[1:47:23] unknown thunders
[1:47:25] to wake her up
[1:47:27] this is 1963 oh the bride hasn't had no
[1:47:29] revival yet it's going to take those
[1:47:32] seven unknown thunders to wake her
[1:47:34] up and then he comes in in 1964
[1:47:38] preaching recognizing your day in its
[1:47:39] message
[1:47:40] and he says all the church seeing the
[1:47:42] church world they're out there
[1:47:44] praying fast and pray fast and pray for
[1:47:47] some great awakening
[1:47:50] but what does the prophet say he says
[1:47:51] they
[1:47:52] have missed it they have not recognized
[1:47:54] the awakening of the bride
[1:47:58] they have not recognized the awaking of
[1:48:00] the bridal they didn't recognize the
[1:48:02] opening of the word that's what this
[1:48:04] revival is about
[1:48:07] this revival is about the word that has
[1:48:09] been opened up to us in this day the
[1:48:12] third pool the revealing of those seven
[1:48:14] seals that had your name on the book and
[1:48:16] it's called your name that's what this
[1:48:18] revival is about this is the bride's
[1:48:20] revival this ain't about going back to
[1:48:23] another age this is about going into a
[1:48:25] rapture this is about going into a body
[1:48:27] change
[1:48:28] this is about recognizing who you are in
[1:48:30] your position in the revealed word of
[1:48:32] the hour
[1:48:34] oh that'll cause a revival
[1:48:36] oh hallelujah we've got to get down into
[1:48:38] that word feed on it the prophet said if
[1:48:41] you want deity in your midst
[1:48:43] welcome and receive the word oh how many
[1:48:46] years say lord i want to welcome and
[1:48:48] receive the word
[1:48:50] hallelujah amen we'll just come to a
[1:48:52] close if the musicians would come
[1:48:57] oh praise the lord
[1:49:12] the prophet would say this
[1:49:17] he says in recognizing your day and its
[1:49:19] message
[1:49:20] he says the world forces this way
[1:49:23] and the world forces that way but god
[1:49:25] forces upward
[1:49:26] the spirit of god which is the word of
[1:49:29] god my word is spirit and life will put
[1:49:32] the bride in her place
[1:49:34] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:49:36] the word then she's in christ we'll put
[1:49:39] her in her place no national force will
[1:49:41] do it but national force did drive
[1:49:43] israel to her homeland the national
[1:49:46] force of council of churches will drive
[1:49:47] every organization into it but the power
[1:49:50] of god will raise the bride into glory
[1:49:53] and out of it oh aren't you thankful for
[1:49:55] that i'm not looking for no natural
[1:49:58] national force to put me in place i'm
[1:50:00] not looking for some pandemic
[1:50:02] to put me in my place i'm not looking
[1:50:04] for some government to hunt me down in
[1:50:07] my neighborhood and all of a sudden i'm
[1:50:08] gonna start crying out to god and think
[1:50:10] oh my i better get ready i better get in
[1:50:12] my place but no the prophet of god is
[1:50:14] saying no national force will do it but
[1:50:17] the power of god is what puts you in the
[1:50:19] bride
[1:50:20] that's what the spirit of revival is it
[1:50:23] is the very power of god it's the very
[1:50:25] spirit of god that has come down to
[1:50:27] apprehend vessels
[1:50:29] and reveal himself to you oh have a
[1:50:31] revival break out in you
[1:50:33] glory to god
[1:50:37] oh hallelujah
[1:50:46] the prophet would say this in the smyrna
[1:50:48] church age you'd say as the eternal
[1:50:50] logos god
[1:50:51] was manifested in the sun
[1:50:54] and then jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:50:56] the godhead bodily
[1:50:58] and that eternal one was the father
[1:51:00] manifested in the flesh
[1:51:02] and thereby by gain the title of son
[1:51:05] even so we
[1:51:07] follow this now
[1:51:09] even so we eternal in his thoughts
[1:51:12] in our turn
[1:51:14] became the many members spoken word seed
[1:51:18] manifest in flesh
[1:51:20] and those eternal thoughts now manifest
[1:51:23] in flesh
[1:51:24] are the sons of god
[1:51:26] even as we are so called
[1:51:30] he said in our turn
[1:51:32] god's word and our turn becomes flesh
[1:51:36] so when we look into the bible
[1:51:38] abraham had his turn
[1:51:41] david had his turn
[1:51:44] all the disciples had their turn
[1:51:48] martin luther had his turn wesley had
[1:51:49] his turn
[1:51:50] brother branham had his turn
[1:51:53] but in our turn
[1:51:56] oh somebody ought to say it's my turn
[1:51:59] but in our turn we become
[1:52:02] the manifested word of god in our turn
[1:52:06] oh the prophets had their turn the
[1:52:08] patriarchs had their turn
[1:52:10] the disciples had their turn
[1:52:13] but in our turn
[1:52:15] this is your turn church
[1:52:17] oh i i heard it said
[1:52:20] that every age has a chance at a revival
[1:52:22] every age has its turn
[1:52:25] oh what are you seeing what are you
[1:52:26] talking about man i'm talking about a
[1:52:28] people that are recognizing it's your
[1:52:31] turn
[1:52:32] hallelujah it's your turn church
[1:52:35] oh it's your turn to allow this word
[1:52:38] this spirit of revival
[1:52:41] to move you
[1:52:43] to change you
[1:52:45] for you to become the very word made
[1:52:47] flesh
[1:52:50] oh what is this all about
[1:52:52] this is a word revival
[1:52:56] you know i heard i hear the prophet tell
[1:52:57] a story
[1:52:59] let's all stand
[1:53:04] there's a welsh revival that broke out
[1:53:08] and you know it caused quite a scene
[1:53:10] there was
[1:53:11] such a moving of the power of god and
[1:53:13] people's lives being changed that
[1:53:15] there were some religious men who wanted
[1:53:17] to go see what it was all about
[1:53:21] so they went up there and
[1:53:24] with their religious clothes on and they
[1:53:25] got over there
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:29] in the whales and they're like you know
[1:53:30] what
[1:53:31] let's go find this welsh revival and
[1:53:34] they saw this little police officer over
