gathered us from all different places to speak to our hearts maybe you have a need on your heart this evening that you would just like to say Lord Jesus I would like to invite you by my house you know it's kind of like he asked zacchus to come down out of a tree of all of the people hundreds maybe even thousands there and he said today I'd like to dine with you and if Jesus comes to your house you'll never be the same you may have to go make some retribution but just his atmosphere he'll change your life oh there may be a lot of star scars and pains in your life and a lot of things that that you just don't know how to answer five minutes in his presence will change you forever and he's that same God today brother Brandon would tell us don't miss it don't miss him as this meeting goes through he's passing by we're witnessing the bride's Revival don't look for it to come he's Among Us now he's Among Us now this word this anointing will change your body but don't miss it don't miss

than the honeycomb I've never found you to disappoint me one time I found you father on The Mountaintop and then the deepest valley I found that you were you're faithful in every situation of Our Lives we've seen you do phenomenal miracles the greatest of which is a transformation of an individual's life now father we ask you to take lips of a man one more time last night we heard from your word as brother Andrew spoke under the anointing of the word of the Lord identifying that bars and chains and prison cells were broken Lord Jesus you're the Healer that is Among Us we surrender ourselves to you father feeling already the anointing of God here Angel of the Lord is present even now we don't have to embellish that you're here you're here to confirm your word I asked you that you would strengthened this church like never before I ask you to speak to our hearts we thank you for what you did here Sunday what you did here last night what you're going to do tonight and what you're going to do in the rest of this week who is to say that this is the last weekend the last weekend on this Earth oh God help us father let us catch every moment Lord absorb it father minister to our hearts prepare us for the Readiness Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and amen amen God bless you so good to be with you so good to have my family with me Andrew and his wife and my grandbabies and my brothers daughter charity that is with us and also brother Jeremy and and his wife and sister April and brother Stephen and sister Tara and all of you I'd like to thank you for coming to our Labor Day meeting while you you came and it was such a wonderful blessing I never heard your preacher preach that great in his life amen and I know you enjoyed it amen I know you enjoyed it that should have been the best amen of the whole amen so we we love brother Tim we've been buddies a long time now and I don't know why I got grayer and he got darker headed and so and that's just how it is thank you for every prayer that you have prayed for me and God's been with us in this journey it's not for sissies but we are still standing still cutting Devil's heads off and here we are Psalms chapter 27 and verse 1. I'd like to speak to you this evening and maybe just somewhat of a simple thought on let's finish this amen Psalms chapter 27 and verse 1. we identify this as the Rapture scriptures the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise against me and this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that I will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all of the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon a rock you may be seated this evening I find it very interesting that brother Branham when he's beginning to speak on the Rapture he reads these scriptures an infinite God that knows the beginning from the end the Alpha and Omega has the last age Prophet to use these scriptures that David is writing about as his theme thought that I have hidden you I have hidden you as the final voice as the final age I have hidden you in my Pavilion I I've got this taken care of it wasn't we that have gathered ourselves here together it wasn't we that gathered ourselves it was God and when you think about this you and I had very little to do with this because you wasn't looking for God God came looking for you and and remember it he took charge of you he's your husband he's the he's the king of your heart he has given you everything that you need for life's journey and for the battles that you will face in your life and so when he's writing through David thousands of years ago these words are more than a song it's more than a than a poem but it's power packed for the Bride of Jesus Christ for in the time of trouble I've got you we see a man named Putin screaming to fulfill scriptures screaming to prop to fulfill the prophecy that is written Israel is screaming for a messiah they're screaming to be a part of that that word that is a part of them but there's a bride that's on the Earth there's Angels standing holding back Putin and all of his armies and nuclear weapons they cannot fulfill ahead of time everything is on time [Applause] and brother David's country he is in a he has a place where they have a clock that is called Big Ben it's supposed to be one of the greatest clocks that there is in the world on time let me just say it has nothing on God's timepiece God's time is not a second off [Applause] I think about the Gathering of a setting here together and I I'd like to just use a couple of illustrations sometimes we just take for granted somebody else is in the building brother Dave and mayor that sets behind us at standing here Head and Shoulders above us all incredible Prince of a man he spoke to you on Sunday that was the best I've ever heard him speak and God came and amen at the end of the service [Applause] your response ought to have been better than that it's one thing for a man to speak then then God Amen [Music] we we became almost common listening to the tapes that brother Brandon would speak a sermon and we could we could give a list of sermons that brother Branham would speak and then he would turn into the prophetic gift and God would amen the word and begin to call names and where they were from and their addresses and their condition what the doctor said he would rare his shoulders back and say he's here [Applause] he would remind us that we're not feeding on the mind of a man but we were feeding on the body word of the son of man we weren't it wasn't even feeding on the personality of William Branham though we loved him and had phenomenal respect for him and still do but it was the mighty angel that was a company there was not another man on the sea I can say this without without even with a declaration there was another phenomenal speaker on the sea and there was phenomenal speakers but there was not another one all right that had been met by an Angel in the cave that would stand there night after night after night after night confirming this message our Prophet had to leave the scene but the angel is still here I heard Brother David speak who is like our God and then he would use Danny Henry's as he stood there and he spoke that in the French language how would you like to hear that how it sounded I I was with you I applauded that was incredible then at the end of the service God spoke to you [Applause] not David May or God spoke to you I like that more than a man more than a pastor more than a group of people [Applause] he's confirming his word [Applause] Brother David was a was in his father-in-law's Church knowing well Sister Anne 's father and mother and Brother David was interpreting for me wasn't a preacher I told this at brother biskels is it okay to tell it again just a smile so I I and God just moved on me spoken to my heart and I turned to Brother David as we're standing in in Switzerland and I said don't interpret this but God's calling you to speak and be a preacher and Pastor a church he wasn't even a preacher but the amen is there's now a church it's one thing for something to speak something or have an unction for something but God opened the door I don't care what critic says I'm not interested in the credit it was in one of those meetings as I walked by Brother Joshua and I've never said your last name right Von braunt I'm not a Belgian knees as I walked by him and he was standing as a deacon in the in the meetings about 450 people and I walked by him and I turned and went back to you and told you that God was calling you to preach and now about six to seven years has been a preacher it was just a couple of years ago that God called your father home but he got to hear you preaching I'm going to just can I talk to you just a bit you know I'm fighting to live you can listen to me a little bit your dad was so proud of you it was in North Carolina your father was at the end of the meet we were at the end of the meeting and I had spoke to where that God can't operate out and because I we had some critics in the room if God can't operate out here he'll operate in the back room Miracle after miracle happened behind the curtain and your father came back and it was told to your father God's there's a train coming go ahead and get on in a couple of months later God took him home but he had a desire that he constantly would remind me of that would be son Isaiah he said I want Isaiah to come home I want him to serve the Lord some things I can't say from the pulpit I want him to come home I want his wife him and his wife together I want them to serve the Lord so when you look over at them brother Isaiah your wife if you just raise your hand just now there's a miracle these are names that were in the Lamb's books these are names that were in the Lamb's books and Satan did everything possible [Applause] like he did you to destroy you before you were ever born but Satan can't stop you [Applause] in Revelations chapter 19 I want to I have I have read what God has fortified you with and now I want to read you where we're headed and I want to remind the devil that we are not we're not just going to finish here [Applause] we're not just going to finish here we're going to walk off of this Earth but we've got a place to go we're going to spend eternity together [Applause] and I heard a great voice of a great multitude as a voice of many Waters and a voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent arenas let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready Revelations 21 and verse 1 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven's saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death [Applause] there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor Pride neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away he that set up on the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these things these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely he that overcometh he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son in First Corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24 and Paul is writing about running this race know you not that they which run in a race run off but one receiveth the price so run that you may obtain Paul is the first church age messenger giving charge to every age even this one even you tonight every man that strived it for the Mastery is tempering in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beta the out but I but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway let me just say this to you there's nothing in this life worth getting hung up for there's not a house there's not a job there's not a relationship there's not a marriage [Applause] there's not an offer from the Devil there's not a hurt feeling there's not an ounce of Pride are you with me now the Zeal of this age is to repent well brother Ron I fell I made some mistakes get up get up while there's still time to run did I just because you've Fallen get up run Paul gives us a glimpse of Hero's lives I cannot imagine the responsibility of what it was to take an inside entire life of a man and to take one or two sentences to describe his entire life but yet those people would be listed in the Overcomers that will inherit all things now in this Paul was not was not just given us a motivational speech but God was given us momentum I know you've heard this and read this a thousand times but let me just read it one more time Paul is writing in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 32 what more he's already talked about Enoch he's already talked about Abel he's talked about Moses he's talked about all of those what more shall I say for the time she had failed me of of Didion and a Barack and of Samson he just mentions their name yeah and of Jeff Knight and of David and of Samuel and of the prophets now notice these next words who through faith subdued kingdoms righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of the fire escape the edge of the sword no Hollywood here out of weaknesses who made strong wax blogging in fight turn to fight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised the life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance let me just say this to you maybe you've got some excuses here tonight of why you're not giving it a hundred percent why don't you tell these people if you could have a personal interview with them why you're not giving a hundred percent why why don't you have an interview with some of these people that were stretched apart that were shown asunder women were cut apart that their babies were pulled out of them why don't you talk to them [Applause] and others had trial of cruel mockings and sturgeons yeah over more over bonds of imprisonment they were stoned they were sauna sunder they were stoned read that with me they were stoned that might not mean too much to you but how many has ever heard of a man named John Wesley John Wesley was five foot one he was a red-headed man he was not accepted in any of his churches but that scripture stood out to him and if you go back and read in any of these sermons he mentions that over and over again because John Wesley was stoned repetitively he was stoned after he would get done preaching none of us we may get a Blog and we may get some hurtful text and we may get some words or somebody might meet us after church but John Wesley when he got done preaching was stoned and you can read it in his in his Daily Journal it said last night I preached and they stoned me and they piled Stones up on top of me and they left me for dead but God rich in Mercy [Music] [Applause] and I shook the Rocks off of me today I'll preach eight more times God give us the energy of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens of the caves and these all haven't obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect I'd like to say this to you you have no Stadium where somebody's cheering for you maybe you can't hear the other side but there's angels in another dimension there's a cloud of witnesses that are watching us that have went on before us sister Karen is screaming finish this race there's a body change laying ahead there's a resurrection right in front of you don't get distracted keep your eyes on the prize don't let nothing get in your way [Applause] expensive well for seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin was just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and it's set down at the right hand of the Throne of God these all died in faith they didn't know what God defeated and neither are we a bunch of victims but we are victorious standing here tonight Paul would say it like this I press towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God which is in Christ Jesus now if I could just share a couple of thoughts with us just here just for a few moments we are his subjects and we were predestinated before the foundation of the world we came from God and we're going back to God and we come to an understanding that our origin was not of man but was of God yes and God was like a great contractor when he was making the Earth he laid our bodies in the Earth now watch what's this Revelation chapter 5. he said the book he took the book with Redemption power for the for the blood that's a Trent that's a transform you from a rascal to a son of God with authority with checkbook adoption with substance of God placed inside of us the re the resort his life his own life greater than all darkness that there is there's no room no darkness in him like the attribute see it is in God an attribute is your thought God in the beginning the Eternal he wasn't even taught he was eternal he wasn't even God God is an object of worship so he wasn't even that he was Elohim he was the Eternal but in him was thoughts watch this Prophet as he just lays it out no other man never spake like that he wanted to become material what did he do then he spoke a word and the Word was materialized that's the whole picture I like God's whole picture you know what about a picture if there's 150 people in your picture who do you find you're a bunch of vain people and you'll stand there and go well my hair wasn't right I wasn't standing right I well when you look at the work when you look at the word you find yourself in the book it's good to find this one and good to find that one but when you find yourself if you ever get that anchor in your heart that's not a devil in hell can shoot you from that Elohim sitting on the throne with all of his subjects around him I want you to just notice this is what God pictured before all of this started he's sitting there with his thoughts and you was there and if you ever was there and then you came into this little hickey of time if he ever thought of you there's never a time that he unthinks of you I like that don't you he's not the kind of businessman that gets in the middle of the stream and says I I don't have enough to get him through if he ever thought of you let's just watch this he says it's like a man building chains or making chains the mortar each Bell has got to ring different from the other the same materials but so much iron so much steel so much brass to make it ring The Ting isn't that so simple Oh I thought it would be a great mystery that's the way God did he bred this one to that one to this one to that one and this one to that one are you getting the point and it got exactly what he wanted and that's how he come down God unveiled himself in a pillar of fire down through the prophets then into the son of God he which he was God see it's the same God be bringing out exactly from Perfection to Perfection from glory to glory that's the way the church does notice Through the Ages the same way by the prophets he reveals himself them wasn't exactly prophets they were gods for what they spoke was God's word they were the flesh that God was veiling in they were gods ever heard a denominational preacher used that kind of a term Jesus him set himself how can you condemn me when I say I'm the son of God and your own law says that them who the word of the Lord comes to what's God now think about this you're sitting there tonight and and the enemy was whispering your ear how worthless you are and he'll try to send you down through memory allies and maybe remind you that nobody cares or nobody loves you or you know there's so many things that are against you and all the complexes of your life but I want you to think since Adam as I expound on that quote since Adam man has courted woman not man courted man escorted woman just to get her to smile at him then to Mary then to have children that's been happening since Adam and then we're understanding in One in a Million that in every seed of life 999 000 Souls of cells die and only one is predestinated to life so all the way since Adam [Applause] God has been watching over your natural seed that's your natural sin he wanted you a certain height a certain build a certain hair color a certain a certain way in your attributes he wanted the Bell to chime just right [Applause] just so that he could come and live on the inside of you [Applause] oh brother Brandon would use some statements he said she knows what he wants done with the word he would use this term checkbook Authority that God signed it and you just have to fill it out he said he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she will do the Greater Works God's not going to send another messenger neither is he going to raise another Prince of preachers we're not looking to the personality of man we need preachers God Holy Ghost Field preachers [Applause] we need that but God wants to use you now we're gathered in this building and every one of us are sitting here and every one of us come from different diverse situations sister Elena your testimony has went around the world Satan attacked you tried to take your life you took the word of God and you signed a check Satan thought he had you as a matter of fact no doubt Satan said she'll be she'll be dead in just a few months he had plans to destroy the family but you took the word of God come on you took a word of God your testimony has went around the world there's just such a woman probably no doubt and I'm just gonna be kind they're such a little woman I don't know how tall she is and I have no clue what she weighs never going to get in that trouble but she has shook the kingdom of hell the reason we can do that because brother random says he conquered sickness he conquered Temptation and when the enemy spit in his face he smote his jaw and he turned to the other side when they jerked his beard from his face and spit on him he never reviled back he conquered the temptation he says have faith in God he said oh my how the devil has to recognize the supreme authority of Jesus Christ not me he hates me he don't have to mind me but he has to mind who I represent he asked the Mind who sent me here hallelujah listen to him pray Satan you bound these people you've exposed you're exposed tonight your grips are lost you have no legal Authority at all Jesus Christ robbed you and stripped you at Calvary and we become us the Church of the Living God In The Name of Jesus Christ I adore you to leave every person in the building come out of the people thou demons I jure Thee by the by the Living God live [Applause] he said that's the way the enemy will do if he can if he can see he's got an upper hand he will always proposition you but when he's in a corner he's a coward for the Devil is defeated he's nothing but a bluff if this Bible is the truth which it is Christ stripped him of every legal Authority that he had at Calvary and he paid the full price for sin and all of his attributes [Applause] thank you I can say this and I'll share this with you on our roughest days our lowest hours of despair even in those tone those times we're still chosen blessed favored forgiven loved let of God Victorious inheritance of all of Heaven's Glory privileged to walk with our own Creator married to the kings of kings and he calls us his beloved we're strong in faith we're armed to fight devils entrusted with God's word the most powerful weapon protected by the arm of the almighty and he has placed a hedge about us I imagine every time I read that the devil must just shiver here I stand tonight and the enemy Whispers constantly in my ear that death is in front of me but I refuse to fear because I realize to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord so every time I step into Pulpit is another time to pull the sword and cut his head off maybe your fight is not staged for cancer but the word cancer seems to make people tremble in their shoes but once it begins to get into your body and in your lungs and in your brain the enemy Whispers in your ear but God who is rich in Mercy so every time I get an opportunity to stand in the Pulpit I may be weak I may be dizzy but I stand here and I want to challenge you if I'm not here to whine on you I'm not to lay my head on my shoulders and for you to feel sorry for me I want to challenge you let's finish this race let's finish it let's finish it you may be tired you may be wore out you may have went through a lot of things but let's finish this last finish this race foreign notice it is to him that overcometh so God sees you as an over comma God sees you I like how God sees you don't look at how you see you or somebody else sees you look at what the word says about you you are an overcomer you overcome a lot of things just to be sitting in this pew [Applause] so if you're sitting on on the other side of the internet and you've got a lot of excuses why you're not here Shake Yourself get over yourself [Applause] expect to be victorious expect Faith to pre be preached you walk into this building expect this to be the greatest service you've ever been in we don't come here to be entertained [Applause] we're not looking for the best thing to help there's three of us preaching we're not here to compete with each other we are here to complement each other we're a team here [Applause] whether you're the Oregon player or you're sitting in the balcony every one of us are on the same team we all have the same enemy so every one of us has got to fight 15 years ago I was in a coma and I've entered into a state of being brain dead you know the story I'm not going to tell it much I'd entered into a state of being brain dead and non-responsive your pastor walked into my pulpit spoke on God's Hall of Fame and then he spoke on God will have a testimony God used him as a this may stumble some but who cares as a prophet in the pulpit projecting impossibilities [Applause] little did any of my family know that the doctors were going to harvest my organs they were already making preparations to approach my family to harvest my organs those that are in the medical field knows how all of that happens but let me just say this to you God had a plan [Applause] the last 15 years we've seen the dead raised [Applause] I'm going to go ahead and preach we've seen the dead raised we've seen a little girl come out of a wheelchair and run all over a building we've seen cancers delivered greatest of all we've seen the transformation of souls last weekend we baptized 35 people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ just last weekend you tell me oh one day the Revival is gonna happen brother on it's happening now no man is producing these things no man can produce that God himself the mighty Angel is among us even in this building he's in this building now he will not entrust this to a man to finish it so he has come himself to finish this work it is Jesus Christ in Bride form sure when looking for the corporate return of Jesus Christ but look around you you are seeing his physical attributes on the Earth right now that he thought of before the foundation of the world [Applause] what has he done to try to stop you let's just like think about that just for a minute how much energies that the enemy tries to stop you is this okay I didn't look at my clock so every one of you are a separate book every one of you every one of you are different every one of you have different things that you have to fight your fingerprints different your eye prints different even your blood is different but every one of us came out of the book of eternal life that he thought of and God had confidence not in your flesh because you came through the hybrid of man the Fallen flesh of of this dirt but he placed something on the inside of you that Eternal Gene seed of God that may have laid their dormant for decades but one day God rich in Mercy that seed came to life [Applause] and you could have been raised in the worst home in the world but God ignited that sin okay the woman at the well and Jesus goes to her and he even sends his disciples away because they'll be judgmental and he goes to her

Belgium East why don't you stand One turns into thousands One turns into thousands Colby stand up me One turns into thousands God knows what he's doing when he plants a seed [Applause] I feel ten thousand votes up here on this stage God knows what he's doing when he's igniting you Wendell brother wouldn't know he knowed what he was doing and all of hell was against you but he knew when he was calling you to preach the gospel and he would raise your voice to preach the gospel he'll still be calling maybe even the day of the rapture we got work to do [Applause] give me a give me an oak tree and he gives you an acre give me an apple tree and he gives you a seed he said can you count can you count the apples the bushels of apples in a seed think of an eternal God that's thinking about you
