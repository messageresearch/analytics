[9:02] Spirit of God,
[9:05] oh spirit of God,
[9:09] right in my heart.
[9:13] Fill my
[9:17] [Music]
[9:22] spirit of God. Move
[9:25] an empty vessel. I want to be so that
[9:32] you
[9:33] can come.
[9:36] Oh yes.
[9:37] Can we sing it again and make it our

[9:55] Fill my whole being

[10:03] Spirit of God move.
[10:06] An empty vessel I want to be so that you
[10:14] can come
[10:19] Lord
[10:21] and fill me
[10:24] Lord Jesus.
[10:26] Lord that's our prayer tonight
[10:29] Lord is that you'll just come and fill
[10:31] every heart and every life Lord. Lord,
[10:34] and if we've been filled, we're asking
[10:35] tonight, Lord, for a refilling, Lord. We
[10:38] recognize that we need more and more of
[10:40] you each and every day. Lord, it's the
[10:43] great hour of darkness, but we can
[10:45] rejoice because light has shone, Lord.
[10:48] And when that light has shown us, Lord,
[10:50] our need for you more than ever, Lord,
[10:52] our need for refillings of your spirit.
[10:54] And I'm just asking you to come tonight,
[10:56] Lord, illuminate, Lord, your word. Open
[10:58] our hearts to receive it and speak life
[11:00] tonight, Father. I pray we love you,
[11:03] Lord. We commit this time to you, Lord.
[11:05] May it not just be a history lesson,
[11:07] Lord, but may we see you moving in the
[11:09] midst of your church in Jesus name. We
[11:11] commit these things to you. Amen. And
[11:14] amen. Thank you very much.
[11:17] Amen. But before we get in, let you seat
[11:22] have your seat. We're going to read one
[11:24] verse. And I didn't put it in the
[11:25] PowerPoint, so I'm just going to read it
[11:27] here for you. And we're going to read
[11:29] the final verse in in Revelation three
[11:33] as he closes out the Leodysian church
[11:36] age. He says, "To him that overcomemeth
[11:39] will I grant to sit with me in my
[11:40] throne, even as I also overcame and am
[11:43] sat down with my father in his throne.
[11:46] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[11:49] the spirit saith unto the churches."
[11:52] Amen. May God add his blessing to it. as
[11:54] you have your seats.
[11:59] Amen. Before we before we get into this,
[12:01] I do just want to make mention, I know
[12:03] it was put on the the the Facebook
[12:05] announcement, but just a reminder that
[12:08] afterwards, there will be food and
[12:10] fellowship at uh Brother Jackson, Sister
[12:12] Laura Burns's home. They've been so
[12:14] gracious as to open up their home to us
[12:16] tonight, and there'll be um food and
[12:19] things supplied there for fellowship
[12:21] afterwards. So, amen. And it's good to
[12:23] be back together again as as we go into
[12:25] the closing chapter of the seven church
[12:28] age book. And and this was titled a
[12:30] resume of the ages. And and and a resume
[12:35] means a summary of something. So that so
[12:38] that's what this is tonight. It's it's a
[12:40] it's a summary. And brother brother
[12:42] Brandham says, "It is therefore our
[12:44] purpose now to take this chapter and
[12:47] beginning with the Ephesian age traced
[12:49] through all ages, the church and her
[12:51] history as given to John by the spirit
[12:54] of God. We will not be adding new
[12:56] material as much as correlating what we
[13:00] already have." So, so what we're looking
[13:02] at tonight, it's a review from the
[13:04] Ephesian age all the way through the
[13:06] Leodysian age to to bring it all
[13:09] together. many of the things that we've
[13:10] discussed and and and really we all here
[13:13] know h how the church started and where
[13:16] it got its beginning. We we can see that
[13:18] right there in the book of Acts. We know
[13:19] that the church began on the day of
[13:22] Pentecost and we know how the early
[13:24] church operated there originally just by
[13:27] reading the book of Acts. We can see how
[13:29] God moved and what was expected and and
[13:32] we that's not a mystery. It's right
[13:33] there for all of us to read. And and so
[13:35] really what we're doing in this review
[13:37] is is focusing on how the false vine
[13:40] managed to worm its way in and how did
[13:43] the false vine get in and and eventually
[13:45] gain power and influence within the
[13:47] church and then and then around the the
[13:50] fifth age, how did God begin a
[13:52] restoration to bring the church back to
[13:55] what it was originally? Amen. So, so as
[13:58] we look at this, just a few things that
[14:00] you've seen many times and a map here of
[14:03] the seven churches of Asia Minor that
[14:06] represent the seven church ages and and
[14:09] we see them there. We we started in
[14:12] Ephesus and then it goes to Smyrna and
[14:14] Pergamon and Thyra and Sardis and
[14:16] Philadelphia and back to Leodysia and
[14:19] and and what we found out was these
[14:21] messages weren't just to just to
[14:24] churches but they were these churches
[14:26] represented ages. Amen. And brother
[14:28] Brandham says these seven churches
[14:30] churches located in Asia Minor contained
[14:33] certain characteristics within them. So
[14:36] in the present as they were there, there
[14:38] was certain things about those churches
[14:41] at that ancient date which became mature
[14:44] fruit in later ages. So so remember that
[14:47] we're not just learning about a place
[14:49] although it was a place but we're
[14:51] looking at an age and the
[14:52] characteristics. And early on brother
[14:54] Brandham told us he said the key to all
[14:57] this is the revelation that God never
[15:00] changes. We've put that in every single
[15:02] PowerPoint of every single study. And if
[15:05] you don't come away with nothing else,
[15:06] remember that Jesus Christ is the same
[15:09] yesterday, today, and forever. He says
[15:13] God never changes and that his ways are
[15:15] as unchangeable
[15:17] as he is. So the the word can't change
[15:21] or be changed because the word is God.
[15:24] If he ever did it, he does it still. The
[15:27] way he did it at the beginning, he does
[15:29] it tonight. what he did in the first he
[15:31] will have to keep on doing until it is
[15:33] done for the last time. And I can look
[15:36] at that tonight and say what a rest we
[15:37] can have in that as believers. What a
[15:40] rest tonight that we can have. What a
[15:42] foundation that you can have as a young
[15:44] person or as a Christian. That that our
[15:46] foundation isn't built on opinions. It
[15:49] isn't built on the shifting sands of of
[15:51] culture, but it's built upon the solid
[15:54] rock, the unchanging word of of of God.
[15:57] Amen. And and brother Brandham tells us
[15:59] that that that as we go into this study,
[16:02] he said, "Why is so much of it
[16:03] misunderstood?"
[16:05] He said, "So much of it is misunderstood
[16:07] about the book of Revelation?" Because
[16:10] for most of the ages, they didn't
[16:12] realize that when he said the word
[16:14] church, that he wasn't just speaking to
[16:17] the elect. that he wasn't just speaking
[16:20] to the bride as it were when he speaks
[16:23] about the church, but he's speaking to
[16:25] everything that claims to be the church.
[16:29] He and as we study, we learn that the
[16:31] church is made up of two different
[16:33] vines.
[16:34] So, there's two vines within the
[16:36] framework of the church. The false vine,
[16:39] which many times we'll refer to as
[16:40] tears, and then the true vine or the
[16:43] wheat. And and as you read the Bible and
[16:46] and and pay attention to it, you find
[16:48] constantly this terminology referencing
[16:52] the cycles of planting and growing and
[16:55] harvesting. And if you're aware that
[16:56] it's not really talking about farming,
[16:58] but it's talking about people and and
[17:01] when he goes forth and it says and he
[17:02] swed good seed that in the field, the
[17:05] field is the church ages. The field is
[17:08] all of history. And he put good seed
[17:10] there. And and if you recognize that
[17:12] terminology, that seed is people.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; And if you recognize that, it makes it
[17:16] so much easier as you're studying and
[17:18] reading your Bible. But but but when God
[17:20] speaks to the church, he is speaking to
[17:23] both. And he's calling both the church,
[17:27] the true and the false. And he tells us
[17:29] here, he says, "Both claim to know and
[17:31] be known of God. Both purport to speak
[17:35] for God. Both believe certain very basic
[17:38] truths and differ on others. But since,
[17:41] now this is very important. Listen to
[17:43] this. But since both bear the name of
[17:45] the Lord,
[17:47] being called Christians and by such name
[17:51] bearing a claim of relationship to him,
[17:55] and in the parenthesis he says God calls
[17:57] it marriage.
[17:59] God now holds them both responsible to
[18:02] him and therefore speaks to each. Now,
[18:07] both of these vines, they they're going
[18:09] to be there from the beginning all the
[18:11] way side by side until they both come to
[18:13] full maturity and then both are going to
[18:16] be harvested. But right here, I want to
[18:18] focus in just for one second. I want us
[18:20] to think just for a moment about the
[18:21] statement, he holds them both
[18:24] responsible to him. Now, why is it why
[18:28] is it that he holds them responsible?
[18:30] It's because they claim a relationship
[18:32] to him. And in so doing, to those that
[18:36] don't know better, they represent him.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; And he holds them responsible for the
[18:41] way they represent him.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; He holds them responsible. And I And so,
[18:46] what am I saying to you tonight? I want
[18:48] you to make sure that your life matches
[18:50] what you're claiming. Yeah.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Make sure tonight that that your life
[18:55] levels up to what you say you are.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't don't claim the Holy Ghost
[19:00] and then not be willing to live
[19:01] according to the word.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Don't there there's a responsibility
[19:06] that goes with your claims. And once we
[19:08] make a claim of well, I'm a Christian,
[19:11] then we bear the responsibility to be
[19:14] true to that relationship.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. True to that standard.
[19:19] and and and and and one thing we must
[19:21] never do is bring a smear upon the name
[19:23] of Christ. Once you're identified with
[19:26] something, then your actions reflect
[19:28] that thing to others.
[19:30] And so, bringing it down to our level,
[19:32] you're identified as a message believer.
[19:35] You're identified with Evening Light
[19:37] Tabernacle. So, others can take their
[19:40] opinion or their understanding of those
[19:43] things from the way you reflect it.
[19:46] You reflect evening like tabernacle when
[19:48] you're out and about. Larger than that,
[19:51] you reflect the message of the hour when
[19:53] you're out and about.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; You're reflecting Jesus Christ when
[19:57] you're out and about because of of who
[19:59] you are and what you claim to be. And
[20:01] God will hold you responsible for the
[20:04] relationship that you claim to him.
[20:06] Amen.
[20:07] And the false vine claims Christ and
[20:10] therefore he holds them accountable to
[20:12] him. So when it says church, he's
[20:15] including all of it. There's true in
[20:16] there and there's false in there, but
[20:18] they're all held accountable to the same
[20:20] word. So where did the false come from?
[20:24] What was its origin? Jesus teaches us a
[20:27] parable in Matthew 13. And it says, "And
[20:30] another parable he put forth unto them,
[20:32] saying, the kingdom of heaven is likened
[20:34] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[20:36] field. But while men slept, his enemy
[20:39] came and sowed tears among the wheat and
[20:42] went his way. But when the blade was
[20:45] sprung up and brought forth fruit, then
[20:47] appeared the tears also. This is not
[20:52] just a parable of a farmer farmer. It's
[20:54] a parable of the church. It's a parable
[20:57] of of the church. And God started a good
[21:00] church.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; In other words, God sowed good seed. The
[21:03] church on the day of Pentecost was a
[21:05] good church. It produced good fruit, but
[21:08] the enemy came in and swed the false
[21:11] vine or the false seed in the good
[21:14] church and it began to grow in that soil
[21:17] and manifest and they're going to both
[21:19] be here until the end of the age. And
[21:21] both are very religious. Don't don't let
[21:23] that fool you. But both claim a
[21:25] relationship to God and and many times
[21:28] they can even look alike. But when it
[21:30] comes to seed time, when it comes to
[21:33] fruitbearing time, when they manifest in
[21:36] full maturity, God says, "Let them grow
[21:38] side by side. Let them grow right there.
[21:41] But when they come to full maturity,
[21:43] you'll be able to tell which ones are
[21:45] which. And the tears are going to be
[21:47] bundled for the burning." But the wheat,
[21:50] listen, don't sit there and selfidentify
[21:52] tonight as a tear. Don't let anything if
[21:54] anything said that makes you feel like
[21:55] that, just say, "Lord, maybe I got some
[21:57] repenting to do, but tonight I'm wheat
[21:59] by the grace of God." Because the wheat
[22:01] ain't gonna be burned. The wheat's going
[22:03] to be gathered into the barn and taken
[22:05] into the rapture. Amen. That's what
[22:08] happens when it comes to full maturity.
[22:10] The the tears are exposed for what they
[22:12] really are, and they're bound for the
[22:14] fire while the wheat is taken into the
[22:16] garner. And brother Brown tells us right
[22:18] here, he says, "The birth of the church
[22:20] was at Pentecost." And he tells us that
[22:23] she remained separate and undefiled for
[22:26] some time. How long this continued, we
[22:29] do not know. But one day, even as Eve
[22:32] was tempted and seduced by Satan, so the
[22:36] church was contaminated by the entrance
[22:39] of the Antichrist spirit.
[22:42] And we set the time there for that very
[22:44] first church age beginning around,
[22:46] brother Brandham said around 53 AD. And
[22:48] we're not going to go into the details
[22:50] about each man. But I do want to bring
[22:52] back up the messengers. And the very
[22:54] first messenger to the first age was the
[22:56] Apostle Paul. And and that age was
[22:59] Ephesus, the Ephesian age. And and it
[23:01] means aimed at and relaxed.
[23:05] Aimed at and relaxed. This this was the
[23:08] age of the upper room. Meaning it was
[23:10] the closest to that. It was the age of
[23:13] Paul, the age of Peter, the age of
[23:15] Stephen.
[23:16] great heroes of the faith, people that
[23:19] had been at the upper room,
[23:22] people that knew about it, that that was
[23:24] this age. But as time went on and the
[23:26] revival began to cool off a little bit,
[23:30] they relaxed and they began to drift.
[23:34] And Jesus said concerning his bride in
[23:36] that first age, this is a quote, "I have
[23:39] somewhat against thee because thou hast
[23:42] left thy first love. Remember therefore
[23:45] from whence thou art fallen and repent
[23:49] already in that first age the church was
[23:52] fallen.
[23:54] They were cooling off. Brother Brown
[23:55] says there was a cooling off of that
[23:57] complete love and abandonment to God.
[24:02] Think about yourself tonight. Think
[24:03] about where you're at in your
[24:05] relationship. Is it a complete
[24:07] abandonment to God? Is it your source of
[24:10] everything? Your source of life? your
[24:12] source of of of love that what you think
[24:15] about as you're awake, as you think
[24:16] about as you're going to sleep, does he
[24:18] consume you? Is it an abandonment?
[24:21] Because we don't have time for another
[24:23] cycle.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; There's been, you know, the cycle of
[24:27] revival and death, but we're in the
[24:29] final one, and someone's going to break
[24:31] that cycle. We don't have a time for for
[24:34] a cooling off period and and a drifting
[24:36] period. We we can't have it said of us
[24:40] as a church, but more specifically as
[24:42] individuals, we can't have it said of
[24:44] us. We have left our first love.
[24:47] That can't be the testimony of who we
[24:50] are. That that other things have
[24:51] replaced our zeal for the word. That
[24:54] other things have replaced our our zeal
[24:56] for communion with God and our zeal to
[24:59] please him and our zeal to know him.
[25:02] where our desire for entertainment
[25:05] overwhelms our desire for devotion.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Now, listen, that's a that's a great
[25:11] danger in our day. And and if you know
[25:14] me, I say it all the time of, you know,
[25:16] we're not the the entertainment police.
[25:18] I can't be your Holy Ghost. I'm not
[25:19] coming around saying, "Well, how much
[25:21] did you do this today and how much did
[25:22] you do that and and what movie did?"
[25:24] Listen, my goal is if you just get
[25:26] people to fall in love with Jesus, those
[25:28] things will take care of themselves.
[25:30] If you get people to fall in love with
[25:32] Jesus and devote themselves to complete
[25:34] abandonment and those things will find
[25:35] their proper place. Some of those things
[25:37] will find their way out and then other
[25:40] things will find their place of
[25:41] importance within the hierarchy of your
[25:43] life. Amen. So, so when I say these
[25:46] things, it's a real danger because we
[25:48] live in a day of endless entertainment
[25:52] right at your fingertips.
[25:55] Endless entertainment. And once again,
[25:58] I'm going to say this as if I'm speaking
[25:59] to all Christians who are all living
[26:01] right. So I'm only speaking about the
[26:03] clean entertainment.
[26:05] Because if you got other things in your
[26:07] life, then we got a whole other
[26:08] conversation we got to have.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; So I'm just talking about things that
[26:13] are okay.
[26:15] We have so much to distract us,
[26:20] so much to take our time. It's so easy.
[26:24] It's it's fun. It pleases the flesh. It
[26:28] makes us laugh. But let me give you an
[26:30] analogy. It's like junk food.
[26:35] That Snickers and that bag of Doritos
[26:37] may not kill you today.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; But I promise you, if that's all you
[26:45] feed on, you are not healthy.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; That you're not healthy. It can't Look,
[26:51] I I love a good Snickers.
[26:54] I love entertainment,
[26:57] but you better find a place for them or
[26:59] you end up extremely unhealthy. When
[27:03] they take your blood and they run tests
[27:04] on it, things don't come back right.
[27:07] There's things out of place and there
[27:08] things out of order and the doctor says,
[27:10] "You better get this taken care of
[27:12] because your diet's been wrong."
[27:15] Well, you're saying it's time to go back
[27:17] and begin to feed more often on things
[27:19] with spiritual vitamins in it, with
[27:21] spiritual strength in it. begin to feed
[27:23] on things that are that are edifying you
[27:25] and and making you stronger. A a diet
[27:28] full of spiritual vitamins. Back to the
[27:30] Bible, back to prayer, back into the
[27:34] message.
[27:36] Listen, it it I dare ask for a raising
[27:40] of hands, but I just happen I just know
[27:42] there's many of our young people that
[27:44] have never sat down and listened to a
[27:46] message
[27:48] or read a message book
[27:51] or even sat there and listened to to the
[27:54] prophet there as as he begins to discern
[27:58] in the congregation or discern in prayer
[28:00] lines and we tell them, you know, you
[28:02] you can trust this man. He was
[28:04] vindicated. He was vindicated. and
[28:05] they're just trusting us cuz they hadn't
[28:06] ever fed on it for themselves.
[28:10] I'm just trying to encourage you. Get
[28:11] your diet in balance.
[28:14] Begin to to feed on things that have
[28:16] eternal value.
[28:18] And and I think I can I'm making myself
[28:21] quite clear. I'm not saying no
[28:23] entertainment. We're not we're not
[28:24] entertainment Nazis here.
[28:27] I'm saying find the right diet of
[28:29] balance that's that that's going to help
[28:31] you make it there.
[28:33] That's what we're trying to focus on
[28:35] tonight. Get back into those things and
[28:38] so that he doesn't look at us and say,
[28:40] "I have somewhat against thee.
[28:43] I did so much. I gave so much."
[28:48] But you never had time for a few minutes
[28:50] in the Bible, a few minutes of of of
[28:52] prayer. You know, and I say this all the
[28:54] time, and I only say it because I'm
[28:56] transparent and and I'm honest with
[28:58] y'all. Maybe too transparent. There's
[29:01] many, many, many times I look at my
[29:03] screen report and go, "What?
[29:08] How many? I wish I could say minutes.
[29:11] How many hours?"
[29:15] But I was too busy
[29:17] for a tape
[29:22] because that's the trap of the world to
[29:24] make you feel so busy, to make you feel
[29:26] I don't have time. Well, you don't
[29:28] because we're giving it all away.
[29:31] You know, it's like you go around and
[29:33] you give all your money away and then
[29:35] say, "I don't have no money." You don't.
[29:36] You gave it away. We're giving our time
[29:39] away to to frivolous things and then we
[29:42] don't have time for the things that
[29:44] matter.
[29:46] And I don't want to hear I have somewhat
[29:48] against thee because you left your first
[29:50] love.
[29:51] Let's make sure. Let's just say tonight,
[29:53] Lord, let me fall in love with you all
[29:55] over again. Lord, light that fire in me
[29:58] all over again, just where I can put
[30:00] things in their proper order, where I
[30:02] can put things where they where they're
[30:03] supposed to be.
[30:05] The enemy began to come in and seow
[30:07] false seeds and false ideas. And and he
[30:10] began by what's known and brother Bram
[30:12] talks about as the deeds of the
[30:13] nickelans.
[30:16] And in this, the church began to turn
[30:18] away from the pure word and their
[30:19] dependence on him and began to rely on
[30:23] the wisdom and the leadership of man.
[30:26] The fire died and and formalism came in
[30:30] and the moving of the spirit became an
[30:32] irregular thing.
[30:35] Man began to rule as a as an ungodly
[30:37] priesthood was instituted.
[30:40] Brother says, "See how it started out in
[30:41] the early church. It was called deeds.
[30:44] Then it became a doctrine. It became the
[30:46] standard. In other words, this is what
[30:48] we do. This is how we operate."
[30:52] It became the unbending way. It finally
[30:54] took over and God was pushed aside.
[30:58] What was just the actions of a few began
[31:01] to take hold and people began to
[31:03] surrender their rights. Listen, you have
[31:07] rights in the Holy Spirit. You have
[31:10] rights to have your own relationship
[31:12] with God. Don't take that for granted.
[31:15] It's not just for for the for the
[31:17] ministers to to to commune with God.
[31:19] That that's one of the things that was
[31:20] torn away by the message of the hour was
[31:23] that nickelatanism to where all the
[31:25] spiritualism's in the pull pit and you
[31:27] just got to sit there and hope you can
[31:28] learn something.
[31:31] But you have the right to operate in the
[31:33] realms of the supernatural. You have the
[31:35] right to to dig deep into the things of
[31:37] God. You have those rights and you got
[31:40] to be willing to say, "I'm not going to
[31:42] let those be taken from me by anybody or
[31:44] any spirit or any teaching."
[31:47] Amen.
[31:49] God's leadership was pushed to pushed
[31:50] aside and man's leadership was fully
[31:52] instituted.
[31:54] The the the leoty began to surrender
[31:56] their rights. Now, now notice when I
[31:58] talk about the leadership of man, I'm
[32:00] not talking about God called men leading
[32:03] by the spirit.
[32:05] That's not what he was talking about.
[32:08] He was talking about grievous wolves
[32:11] that would come in and take all the
[32:12] authority on themselves,
[32:15] all the gifts upon themselves. If
[32:17] anybody has a gift, it's here. If
[32:19] there's any authority in this place,
[32:20] it's here. And you're just the ley. Just
[32:22] sit there and soak in what you can. They
[32:26] take it all upon themselves and they
[32:27] draw men away from the Holy Spirit and
[32:30] to themselves.
[32:33] And with that, the false vine began to
[32:35] squeeze the life out of the church. And
[32:36] brother Brown says, "The true vine hated
[32:39] the formal deeds of the nickelans, and
[32:42] so did God. But by the end of the first
[32:45] age, the nicicoatans were flourishing
[32:47] and and spreading their influence.
[32:50] Brother Brown says it started so small,
[32:52] so quietly, so inoffensively. It looked
[32:55] so good.
[32:57] Then it caught hold and like a python it
[32:59] squeezed out the very breath and it
[33:01] killed all the spirituality there was in
[33:04] the church.
[33:06] He says, "What was planted in the first
[33:09] age will develop in the second age and
[33:12] in all other ages and until it comes to
[33:14] maturity and harvest." So listen, that
[33:18] spirit that would try to rob life out of
[33:19] the church and make it a morg is not
[33:21] dead. It matures and it goes on and on.
[33:25] And don't get it twisted and think, "Oh,
[33:27] well that's just those churches out
[33:29] there." He don't got to squeeze the life
[33:30] out of them.
[33:33] If he's attacking anywhere, if that
[33:34] spirit is anywhere, where is it
[33:36] attacking? Where the life is. But if
[33:40] that spirit and that seed that was
[33:42] planted isn't gone, then neither is the
[33:44] true seed. And neither is the Holy
[33:46] Spirit that brings life and brings
[33:48] freedom and brings deliverance. It is
[33:51] still here as well. Amen.
[33:54] That evil spirit's always trying to find
[33:56] a way back to once again squeeze the
[33:59] life out of the church.
[34:02] So, as we go into the second age, God
[34:05] raises another messenger.
[34:09] He said, "Using our God-given rule of
[34:11] choosing the messenger for each age, we
[34:13] unhesitatingly declare that Ireneius was
[34:16] exalted by the Lord to that position."
[34:20] And God begins to use Irene to battle
[34:22] the nic nickel false vine and the and
[34:25] the former cold spirit that was taking
[34:28] over the church. And the prophet says,
[34:30] "His churches in France were known to
[34:32] have gifts of the spirit among them. For
[34:34] the saints spoke in tongues, prophesied,
[34:37] raised the dead, and healed the sick by
[34:40] the prayer of faith."
[34:43] And we begin to learn by the spirit of
[34:44] prophecy as we read through that that
[34:46] this false vine is the vine of Satan.
[34:50] Revelation 2:9 tells us, "I know thy
[34:53] works and tribulations and poverty, but
[34:55] thou art rich, and I know the blasphemy
[34:58] of them which say they are Jews and are
[35:00] not, but are the synagogue of Satan." In
[35:04] other words, they're claiming something.
[35:06] They're claiming a relationship with
[35:08] God, but in reality, they are of the
[35:11] devil. They meet in the name of God.
[35:13] They preach and they baptize, yet they
[35:15] are not of God. They are like Balum.
[35:20] God speaks to them, but they refuse to
[35:23] do his will.
[35:25] They're like Balum. Brother Brandham
[35:28] says, speaking about Balum, so God let
[35:30] him go. The perfect will of God gave way
[35:33] to the permissive will of God because of
[35:36] the heart desire of Balum. God actually
[35:40] said, "Go ahead." Did God change his
[35:42] mind? No, sir. God had his way
[35:46] regardless of Balum going.
[35:49] And listen young people, that's what we
[35:50] have to deal with tonight is that
[35:52] heart's desire.
[35:54] Not I'm doing this because the preacher
[35:56] says or I'm doing this. Well, really,
[35:58] I'd rather be doing that. I'd really
[35:59] rather be.
[36:01] Listen, when you come to church and you
[36:03] worship with your whole heart, maybe
[36:06] even gifts are manifested and and and
[36:08] and and you're praising God and maybe
[36:10] even anointed to do so, but then refuse
[36:13] to line up to the word.
[36:16] refuse to do God's perfect will and go
[36:19] about life however we want to and have
[36:21] the attitude of it ain't that big a deal
[36:22] but then come back in anointed and
[36:24] worship and praise and go back out and
[36:26] live any way you want to not according
[36:28] to the will of God but according to your
[36:30] will you're walking in the footsteps of
[36:32] Balum
[36:35] that was the attitude of Balum and
[36:37] brother Bram says as he knew that Balam
[36:39] wanted his own heart
[36:42] above the word and he gave it to him yet
[36:44] all the while in the end having his own
[36:48] way. Even so today, God tells folks, "Go
[36:51] ahead in your own heart's desires, for
[36:54] they have already rejected the word, but
[36:56] the will of God will be done
[36:58] regardless."
[37:00] Amen.
[37:02] And so, I just want to open up tonight
[37:04] to to the Lord and say, "Lord, not my
[37:06] will,
[37:08] not what I want, but let my heart desire
[37:11] to be the will of God. Lord, if I don't
[37:14] understand it, if it doesn't benefit me
[37:16] in a way that I can see, no matter how
[37:18] it works out, no matter how it shakes
[37:20] out, no matter where it puts me on the
[37:22] totem pole, if it's your will, that is
[37:25] my heart's desire, not but God, I want
[37:29] this so bad. I want this so bad. And
[37:31] even after he says no, you still
[37:33] continue. But I want this. He'll let you
[37:34] have it.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; But you're out of the will of God, and
[37:39] it never works out for you. Brother
[37:41] Brandham said Balum, even though he got
[37:43] riches, even though he got, he said,
[37:45] Balum was the loser.
[37:48] And if you want to be a winner, there's
[37:50] only one way to be a winner tonight.
[37:51] That is to walk in the will of God. Walk
[37:54] in the path of God for your life. But
[37:57] but but brother Aaron, I I want what's
[37:59] best for me. Then walk in the will of
[38:00] God. That is always what's best for you.
[38:04] I want my heart's desire to be, Lord, to
[38:07] do your will.
[38:10] It was Balum, he says, who was the
[38:12] loser, for he bypassed the word.
[38:16] From there, we come into the third age
[38:18] around the year 312, the Pergamian age.
[38:23] Brother Brandham says, "Using our
[38:24] God-given rule for choosing the
[38:26] messenger to each age. That is, we
[38:28] choose the one whose ministry most
[38:30] closely approximate that of the first
[38:31] messenger, Paul, we unhesitatingly
[38:34] declare the Pergamian messenger to be
[38:37] Martin.
[38:40] During this age,
[38:43] during this age, God deals with two
[38:45] doctrines that he hates.
[38:48] It's the doctrine of Balum that caused
[38:50] Israel to fall into idolatry and the
[38:53] doctrine of the nicicoatans, which we've
[38:54] been dealing with both of these, which
[38:57] had only been deeds in the Ephesian age.
[38:59] But now in Revelation 2:14, speaking
[39:02] directly to this age, he says, "But I
[39:04] have a few things against thee, because
[39:06] thou hast them that hold the doctrine of
[39:09] Balum, who taught Bailac to cast a
[39:12] stumbling block before the children of
[39:14] Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto
[39:16] idols, and to commit fornication. So
[39:18] hast thou also them that hold the
[39:20] doctrine of the nickel." And so we see
[39:22] now it's no longer just deeds, but it is
[39:25] grown and is manifested in doctrines. He
[39:28] says which thing I hate.
[39:31] The prophet tells us the separation of
[39:33] the clergy from the ley grew. In other
[39:35] words, the the the clergy got lifted up
[39:38] more and more powerful and the leoty got
[39:41] less and less. They were more the gap
[39:43] between them grew more and more. And he
[39:45] says it grew from the biblical truth of
[39:48] of elders ruling the flock by the word
[39:51] to the deeds of the nicicoatans wherein
[39:53] the clergy set themselves in ranks one
[39:56] over the other which unscriptural
[39:58] formula then evolved into a priesthood
[40:01] that placed the clergy between man and
[40:03] God giving the clergy certain rights all
[40:06] the while denying the ley their
[40:08] god-given rights. This was usurpation in
[40:12] this age. It became a doctrine. So the
[40:16] doctrine of the nickelans and the
[40:18] doctrine of balum. The doctrine of balum
[40:21] balumism is a two-part thing. First of
[40:24] all, it seems so simple, seems so good.
[40:26] The first part of balenimism is let's
[40:28] just talk things over.
[40:31] Let's just all come together. Let's just
[40:34] talk about our differences. Let's get
[40:36] this all ironed out. We're not that
[40:38] different.
[40:40] It was first of all to suggest that they
[40:42] all get together and eat together and
[40:45] get things ironed out and second part
[40:47] from there it leads into well now we can
[40:50] worship together.
[40:53] The people were introduced to idol
[40:54] worship and and and spiritism for for
[40:57] statues with the names of saints were
[40:59] placed in the buildings and the people
[41:00] were taught to commune with the dead.
[41:04] And as the scripture told us, it was
[41:05] Balam who gave this advice to Bailac to
[41:08] trap and destroy Israel by united
[41:12] meeting,
[41:13] bringing them down together just to have
[41:15] a meeting. And it was this age that
[41:17] Constantine the emperor called the Nyine
[41:20] Council in 3:25 where Christians both
[41:23] false and true came together to talk
[41:25] things over and figure things out to be
[41:29] better united. But brother Brandham says
[41:31] the true Christians should have never
[41:34] gone to that meeting. They came away
[41:37] stripped and bound with less truth than
[41:39] ever before. And now they were under the
[41:42] control of the political power of Rome.
[41:45] He says for the food that man truly
[41:47] needs, even the word of God, they were
[41:49] given creeds and dogmas and rituals
[41:52] which were also enforced by the state.
[41:54] And above all, they were given three
[41:56] gods with a triple compound name of the
[41:58] one true God. And water baptism in the
[42:01] name of the Lord Jesus Christ gave way
[42:03] to the pagan baptism of three titles.
[42:05] The real believers ought not to have
[42:07] gone there. They had already lost much
[42:09] truth and now they too would lose the
[42:12] understanding of the godhead and forfeit
[42:15] names for titles in water baptism.
[42:19] He goes on to say, "The Nicicolayan
[42:21] doctrine was the corruption of the
[42:22] clergy as they sought political power
[42:24] amongst themselves. While balamism is
[42:27] the subjection of the people to their
[42:30] system of creed and worship in order to
[42:33] hold them." Notice over and over again,
[42:35] what is it? To take away your rights, to
[42:37] take away your freedom, to hold you, to
[42:40] bind you. Anything that doesn't give you
[42:42] freedom isn't of God.
[42:45] where where the spirit of the Lord is,
[42:47] there is liberty, there is freedom. You
[42:51] have the right to serve God in freedom.
[42:53] You have the right to have relationship.
[42:55] You have a right to experience the power
[42:57] and the moving of God. And these things
[42:59] were being stripped away by these
[43:02] doctrines.
[43:03] The people lost their freedom that they
[43:06] were snared by political powers as it
[43:08] took over the church. And with that
[43:09] power, they force-fed the people their
[43:12] creeds and dogmas. There was no
[43:14] leadership of God. They only received
[43:17] what the false vine wanted them receive
[43:20] in order to keep them bound. False gods,
[43:23] idol worship, false doctrines. Brother
[43:26] Brandham says, "And that very same
[43:28] spirit and doctrine is right amongst the
[43:30] Protestants, and it's called
[43:33] denominations."
[43:39] Listen, I know most of you were were
[43:41] raised up in a message church. Most of
[43:44] us here never knew the change and the
[43:47] bondage of a denomination
[43:49] or of the creeds and the dogmas and only
[43:52] be given a little bit of truth and
[43:54] trying to survive in a little bit of
[43:56] truth. Listen, we ought to be thanking
[43:58] God tonight and rejoicing that God sent
[44:00] a prophet that said, "Come out of her,
[44:02] my people." to where you have an
[44:04] unending supply of spiritual food. You
[44:07] you have every opportunity laid at your
[44:09] feet tonight. You have you have
[44:11] spiritual food in due season. Your eyes
[44:13] have been open. You know the truth of
[44:15] these things. And yet many of God's
[44:17] people are still trapped in
[44:18] denominations to this day. Bound by
[44:22] these creeds and these dogmas and these
[44:24] lies that have stripped them of their
[44:26] freedom. I'm glad today for truth. I'm
[44:29] glad today for freedom in the Holy
[44:32] Ghost.
[44:34] This brings us to the fourth age,
[44:36] Thitara, the longest of all the ages.
[44:39] And the messenger to this age was St.
[44:41] Columba.
[44:45] And listen, as we as we go through this
[44:47] tonight, even though most of our of our
[44:49] focus is on the false vine and what they
[44:50] were doing during this time, make no
[44:52] mistake about it, there was still a true
[44:54] vine. And they were still fighting the
[44:57] good fight. And they were anointed for
[44:59] what lay ahead of them. And they were
[45:00] anointed to overcome in their age. And
[45:03] they stood strong even unto death.
[45:06] Especially in this age where where
[45:08] thousands millions were put to death to
[45:10] death. They were anointed by that ox
[45:12] anointed.
[45:13] But now the false church was more
[45:15] powerful than ever
[45:17] because the false church and the state
[45:19] had come in union. They had come
[45:22] together. And now with men leading the
[45:24] church and and the leadership of of God
[45:26] and the sovereignty of the local body
[45:28] had been stripped away. And they were
[45:30] all under one banner.
[45:33] And the stage was set for the dark ages
[45:35] and for the next thousand years the
[45:37] church would know the very depths of
[45:39] Satan.
[45:42] He says when any religious people
[45:44] embrace both nickelaninism and balamism
[45:47] and have the political, financial and
[45:49] physical power to back it up, there is
[45:51] only one direction they can go and that
[45:54] direction is right into the Jezebel
[45:58] doctrine. And why is that?
[46:01] Because there was now a hierarchy set up
[46:02] where only the priests heard from God
[46:05] and they were backed by political force
[46:06] of the governments. Then it was easy to
[46:09] spread their false teachings
[46:11] because we're the only ones that can
[46:13] hear from God. You have to trust us. Oh,
[46:15] and not only that, but we have this
[46:16] political force to make you worship this
[46:18] way, to make you believe this way, or
[46:21] else you'll be put to death.
[46:23] It's exactly what Jezebel had done by
[46:26] combining the religious and political
[46:27] power. They could force their religion
[46:30] on people. And so in this age, the pope
[46:33] is put in place of Jesus. Idol worship
[46:36] is forced and millions of Christians are
[46:38] put to death.
[46:40] And here's how it works. If the
[46:41] political power wanted something taught,
[46:44] then the religious force taught it.
[46:47] If the religious force wanted to get rid
[46:48] of some godly man who wouldn't bow down,
[46:51] then the political force would come in
[46:52] and have him put to death. So they
[46:54] worked together to force this religion.
[46:57] and and Rome was drunk with power and
[46:59] drunk on the blood of the martyrs.
[47:02] He says, "But the true vine struggled
[47:04] and survived. God was faithful to the
[47:07] little flock and in spite of what Rome
[47:09] might do to their bodies, Rome could not
[47:11] kill the spirit within them and the
[47:13] light of the truth shone on backed by
[47:16] the Holy Ghost and power." Young people,
[47:19] let's let that sink in for just a minute
[47:21] and read that again. Rome could not kill
[47:25] the spirit within them. Tonight, if
[47:28] you've been born by the spirit of God, I
[47:29] don't care how hard it gets, how bad the
[47:32] trial is, what the devil threatens to do
[47:34] to you, he can't get to that spirit on
[47:36] the inside of you. He can't get to that
[47:39] seed gene of God. What am I telling you?
[47:41] You're going to make it. You're going to
[47:43] be there. You're not going to fail.
[47:45] You're not going to quit. You're not
[47:46] going to lay down and give up. You don't
[47:48] know how close I am to giving up. That's
[47:50] okay. That just means soon and very soon
[47:52] you're going to turn and start going the
[47:54] other way because you're not going to
[47:56] quit. You're not going to fail. They
[47:58] can't kill the spirit on the inside of
[48:01] you. Hey man, you are going to be there.
[48:05] You are going to overcome.
[48:07] If Rome couldn't stomp it out then, no
[48:10] evil spirit's going to stomp it out
[48:11] today. That's one thing we see in the
[48:13] age. It got dark. It got down to where
[48:15] there was only a few remaining. But God
[48:18] backed them up. I say, God, back us up
[48:21] again in this day. You've always done
[48:23] it. You said, "I'll never leave you.
[48:24] I'll never forsake you." No matter how
[48:26] bad it got, you can still see him
[48:28] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[48:30] candlesticks. He said, "I'll never leave
[48:32] you or forsake you." I'm telling you, it
[48:34] may be leadya. It may be dark, but he's
[48:37] still here in the midst of the church
[48:39] moving and walking and backing us up
[48:41] with the Holy Ghost in power.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:47] Then from there
[48:49] we come to the fifth age,
[48:52] the age of reformation,
[48:55] the sardanian age. And we know that that
[48:58] messenger was Martin Luther.
[49:01] Brother B says, "But then God in his
[49:03] sovereign grace sent a messenger by the
[49:04] name of Martin Luther to start a
[49:07] reformation.
[49:09] And for the first time in hundreds of
[49:11] years, the true vine began to grow as
[49:14] men began to protest the vileeness of
[49:17] the Catholic Church. And and Luther
[49:19] comes on the scene. And and and he's not
[49:21] he's not a prophet. He's a reformer. And
[49:25] so, Brother Brham makes it clear because
[49:26] of that, he was not like he was not a
[49:29] man like Apostle Paul who could take the
[49:31] church back all the way to the original
[49:33] or to the fullness.
[49:35] But he could come in and begin to point
[49:37] out the evils being done and and and and
[49:40] begin to show glimmers of truth. He
[49:42] wasn't able to lead the church back to
[49:44] the whole truth, but it was the
[49:46] beginning of the return. He might not
[49:49] could take them all the way back to
[49:50] Pentecost, but he could get the true
[49:52] vine turned and pointed and marching
[49:54] back in the right direction. The the the
[49:57] the wheat plant sent up a chute of
[49:59] truth. the seed of wheat. It had died
[50:02] and had gone down into the ground and it
[50:04] had it had rotted through the dark ages,
[50:06] but now it was beginning to come up. And
[50:09] it was a signal. That chute was a
[50:11] signal. It may not be the harvest. It
[50:14] may not be the whole wheat plant. But
[50:16] what it was was a signal that at some
[50:18] future date at the end of the leodysian
[50:21] age right before the coming of the Lord.
[50:23] There is going to be once again a wheat
[50:25] plant that reaches maturity that matches
[50:28] the original that was planted there at
[50:30] the beginning that sprouted forth on the
[50:32] day of Pentecost. This was a signal that
[50:35] life's coming back.
[50:37] It had been dark and an evil time but
[50:39] truth was beginning to sprout up. And it
[50:42] was during this age that the word was
[50:44] spread far and wide by the invention of
[50:46] the printing press.
[50:49] And the six age comes along and it takes
[50:51] great advantage of this. And and the
[50:53] messenger of this age was John Wesley,
[50:57] the Philadelphiaian age. And the great
[50:59] John Wesley was the messenger. And it
[51:01] was the second stage of restoration.
[51:04] Education abounded and missionaries
[51:06] spread the word all over the world. It
[51:08] was the age of the open door and it was
[51:10] the age of brotherly love and the true
[51:12] vine flourished.
[51:16] And yet just as the false vine had not
[51:18] been able to stomp out the true. Even
[51:21] though the true vine has now is
[51:23] flourishing and growing and the false
[51:25] vine has receded, the true vine wasn't
[51:28] able to stomp out the false
[51:31] because there was something that both
[51:33] ages failed to do. It allows that false
[51:37] vine to survive. And Luther comes with
[51:40] justification and Wesley comes with
[51:42] sanctification.
[51:43] But brother Brandham says, "But how sad
[51:46] does this age make us feel as we realize
[51:48] that every great move of God and there
[51:51] were many neglected to throw off the
[51:54] nickelan doctrine for they all organized
[51:59] and died." Great things were done in
[52:01] these two ages. The restoration was
[52:04] underway. Make no doubt about it. But
[52:06] they were tainted with the same error of
[52:09] hierarchy, the same air of nickelism.
[52:12] And and after the revival had died down
[52:14] a bit, they went right back into
[52:16] organization.
[52:19] Young people,
[52:21] brother Tim said recently, we we don't
[52:24] we don't know how much longer. We we
[52:26] have to humbly admit we don't know how
[52:27] long we'll be here.
[52:29] You may be here after I'm gone there. I
[52:34] mean, I hate to say things like this,
[52:35] but it be realistic. There may may be a
[52:37] whole different set of preachers stand
[52:39] in this pull pit.
[52:42] I don't know what doctrines are going to
[52:44] come around and what what's going to
[52:45] happen. But whatever happens, don't you
[52:47] ever settle for nickelanism again. No
[52:51] matter what gets taught, I've said it
[52:53] already. This message threw that off. We
[52:55] don't got to have some headman. We don't
[52:57] got to have some some some headquarters.
[53:00] that this message restored the
[53:02] sovereignty of the local church. You
[53:05] have rights in the Holy Spirit. It
[53:06] restored your right to hear from heaven.
[53:09] It said, "Come out of her, my people.
[53:11] Come away from the leadership of man."
[53:13] We have no place for nickelism in our
[53:17] ranks. We don't got to have a man ruling
[53:20] over us or this pastor ruling over this
[53:22] pastor. We are led by the Holy Spirit.
[53:26] It's that simple. We don't ever want to
[53:29] go back into those things where men
[53:31] control everything and men tells you how
[53:34] to do it and man tells you what to
[53:35] believe. You dig for yourself. You pray
[53:38] yourself. You get in the Bible yourself.
[53:41] You study the message yourself and then
[53:43] gather together and be fed by the
[53:46] anointed man preaching the word of God.
[53:50] Hallelujah.
[53:53] Then we arrive at our age,
[53:56] the Leodysian age, the bride age,
[53:59] harvest time.
[54:02] Brother Brham says the Lutheran age was
[54:04] the springtime. The Wesleyan age was the
[54:07] summer of growth. The Leodysian age is
[54:09] the harvest time of gathering the tears
[54:12] for burning for binding and burning and
[54:15] gathering the wheat for the Lord.
[54:18] The messenger to this age
[54:21] is William Brham.
[54:24] Vindicated time after time after time
[54:26] over and over and over and over and over
[54:28] again.
[54:30] We make can see some things different
[54:32] and maybe disagree here and there. This
[54:36] is not debatable.
[54:38] The messenger of our age.
[54:41] And speaking of our age, he says there
[54:44] must come upon the scene in this age.
[54:49] This age,
[54:50] those who will bring the wheat and tears
[54:52] to maturity. The tears are already
[54:55] maturing very fast under corrupt
[54:57] teachers who turn the people from the
[54:59] word. But the wheat also must mature.
[55:01] And to her, God is sending the prophet
[55:04] messenger with the vindicated mystery
[55:07] that he might be accepted by the elect.
[55:09] They will hear him as the first church
[55:11] heard Paul and she will mature in the
[55:14] word until becoming a word bride.
[55:18] This is where we are. This is what's
[55:20] been going on. What do you think's been
[55:23] happening all these years? The message
[55:25] was accepted by the elect. That's why
[55:27] we're here. That's why and I don't even
[55:31] want to uh downgrade this by calling it
[55:33] a movement but just for the sake that's
[55:35] why the movement of the message even
[55:37] exists is because the elect heard and
[55:40] responded and accepted.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; They accepted the message and and now we
[55:45] have reached the time for the harvest.
[55:52] I have no idea why that's blank. So I'll
[55:54] read what's supposed to be there.
[55:57] says, "This age started just after the
[55:59] turn of the 20th century as it was to be
[56:02] the age, now listen close, this was to
[56:05] be the age
[56:07] in which the true church would return to
[56:09] being the bride she was at Pentecost.
[56:13] We know that there must of necessity be
[56:17] a return of dynamic power.
[56:21] This is the age that the church returns
[56:24] to being the bride she was at
[56:25] Pentecost." And we know of necessity
[56:29] that there must be a return of dynamic
[56:32] power. This is that age. This is the
[56:35] time. We we can't say this enough. Well,
[56:38] brother, why are you always pointing to
[56:40] Pentecost? Why do we always point to the
[56:42] book of Acts? Why do you always talk
[56:44] about the dynamics? Because the prophet
[56:46] did.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said, "This is the
[56:51] age that we return to being the bride
[56:54] that they were at Pentecost. This is the
[56:56] age that it's necessity that there's a
[56:59] return of dynamic power. If it's
[57:02] necessity, we can't preach it enough.
[57:05] It's necessary.
[57:07] We must have it. He said it was of
[57:10] necessity. It must happen. Now, now he
[57:13] tells us, now this is where some people
[57:15] get a little confused. And he tells us
[57:17] that many thought that the Isuza
[57:19] movement and the restoration of gifts
[57:22] was the long awaited restoration.
[57:26] And he goes into Joel 2 and he shows
[57:28] that it could not have been. I'm going
[57:30] to do this briefly and so hopefully you
[57:32] get it. Joel teaches about the former
[57:35] and the latter reign. He says, "Be glad
[57:38] then ye children of Zion. Rejoice in the
[57:41] Lord your God, for he hath given you the
[57:43] former rain moderately, and he will
[57:45] cause to come down for you the rain, the
[57:48] former rain, and the latter rain in the
[57:50] first month. And the floor shall be full
[57:53] of wheat. So we see a harvest,
[57:56] and the vat shall overflow with wine and
[57:58] oil, and I will restore to you the years
[58:00] that the locust hath eaten, and the
[58:02] cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the
[58:03] Palmerworm, my great army, which I sent
[58:06] among you. Now look, the former rain is
[58:10] the teaching rain or the spring rain.
[58:15] The latter rain is the harvest rain. So
[58:18] former teaching reign, latter rain is
[58:21] the harvest rain. And speaking of the
[58:24] Isuza movement, he says this could not
[58:26] be the full awaited restoration because
[58:30] the former reign or the teaching reign
[58:34] had not even come yet.
[58:36] So the teaching rain hasn't even come
[58:39] yet. So how could there have been a
[58:40] restoration to a harvest?
[58:43] He says it like this. He says, "How
[58:45] could this be the real thing when the
[58:47] teaching reign had not come? The prophet
[58:50] messenger who was to be sent to teach
[58:52] the people and turn the heart to the
[58:54] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[58:57] had not come."
[59:01] And then to prove that Isuza was not the
[59:03] long awaited restoration, they did
[59:05] exactly what Luther did and what Wesley
[59:08] did. Before even two generations had
[59:11] passed, they organized
[59:14] and went straight back into denomination
[59:17] again.
[59:20] But that's not us.
[59:23] We have not come to go back to Isuza. We
[59:26] have not come to go back into a
[59:28] denomination. That's Isuza is not the
[59:31] Pentecost that I'm telling you to return
[59:33] to. I don't believe that any message
[59:35] preacher is trying to tell you to return
[59:37] back to Isuza Pentecost for the teaching
[59:41] rain has come and the harvest reigns
[59:43] have fallen. Rapture and faith is here
[59:46] and it's time for the combines. It's the
[59:50] time of the harvest. And if they weren't
[59:52] it, then why do we want to go back to
[59:54] that?
[59:55] &gt;&gt; That's not what we're trying to go back
[59:57] to. We've been made ready by the word
[59:59] and the truth of the messenger of this
[1:00:02] age. We're not going back to
[1:00:04] denomination.
[1:00:06] Hear me. We will not go back to
[1:00:08] denomination. And we are not going to be
[1:00:10] hindered by scarecrows that point to the
[1:00:12] error of Isuza.
[1:00:14] We know they weren't the truth. We know
[1:00:17] that they that they weren't the
[1:00:19] restoration. But we do know that God
[1:00:21] once again restored the gifts that it
[1:00:23] was a move. that it was it was the the
[1:00:25] the stalk as life was coming through it.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; We don't have to demonize that move to
[1:00:31] recognize that wasn't it.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; That's not what we're going back to. But
[1:00:37] we've been turned back to the original
[1:00:40] under the message of the hour. The
[1:00:42] original what? Pentecost.
[1:00:45] If you hear us say Pentecost, we're
[1:00:48] talking about the original Pentecost.
[1:00:51] Brother Brandham says in her, that's
[1:00:53] you, will be the fullness of Pentecost.
[1:00:58] For the spirit will bring the people
[1:00:59] right back to where they were at the
[1:01:01] beginning. That is thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Listen, once again, not debatable.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I think we're supposed to go back
[1:01:10] here further to to this and and I
[1:01:13] believe in No, no, no, no. Thus sayeth
[1:01:15] the Lord, he's taking the bride back to
[1:01:18] Pentecost.
[1:01:21] This is not the resurrection of the
[1:01:22] church. It is the restoration. God will
[1:01:25] take the church right back to Pentecost
[1:01:28] of the beginning. He makes it clear. He
[1:01:32] makes it very clear. We are to return to
[1:01:35] being the bride that she was at
[1:01:37] Pentecost. Then I tell you tonight,
[1:01:39] young people, don't settle for anything
[1:01:41] less. Don't settle for going back to a
[1:01:44] Baptist theology and don't don't go back
[1:01:46] to to just accept it.
[1:01:49] No matter how much they try to calm you
[1:01:51] down and make it all intellectual.
[1:01:53] Listen, they didn't receive and
[1:01:55] something intellectual on the day of
[1:01:57] Pentecost. They didn't just say, "We
[1:01:59] accept it and and walk down the stairs."
[1:02:02] They didn't come out quietly and in
[1:02:03] perfect order at Pentecost. But that's
[1:02:05] what the nickelans wanted.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; That's what they wanted to do was reign
[1:02:10] and just accept it. Just calm down. Just
[1:02:12] hide the gifts. Nope. That was the fall
[1:02:15] of the first age.
[1:02:17] That was the the coring them down and
[1:02:19] putting them in a pin is what caused the
[1:02:21] first age to fall. But we're actually
[1:02:23] going back before the fall of the first
[1:02:26] age. And we're going back to the
[1:02:28] beginning, which was the birth of the
[1:02:30] church at the day of Pentecost, to the
[1:02:33] original before the false vine entered
[1:02:36] in.
[1:02:38] Don't get it wrong. We're not going back
[1:02:40] to the Ephesian age.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; The upper room was before the Ephesian
[1:02:45] age ever started.
[1:02:47] They walked, brother Brandham said,
[1:02:48] unadulterated and free and clear for
[1:02:51] years. How long, we don't know. But
[1:02:54] there was a time period there where the
[1:02:56] original operated as the original before
[1:02:59] the age ever began. Before the false
[1:03:01] ever came in, that's what we're going
[1:03:03] back to. The original when the church
[1:03:06] operated free in the spirit, separate
[1:03:09] and undefiled.
[1:03:12] He says, "Thus what the church was at
[1:03:14] Pentecost is the standard."
[1:03:18] Brother, you've read that a lot. I love
[1:03:20] it. Because there's no gray area.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; There's no debate in it. There's no
[1:03:25] argument.
[1:03:27] That is the pattern. There is no other
[1:03:29] pattern. No matter what the scholars
[1:03:32] say, I don't care if they're Baptist,
[1:03:33] Methodist, Pentecostal, or message
[1:03:35] scholars. Scholars, scholars, scholars.
[1:03:38] No matter what scholars say, God has not
[1:03:40] changed that pattern. What God did at
[1:03:42] Pentecost, he has to keep on doing until
[1:03:45] the church age is closed. Let me tell
[1:03:47] you again and reinforce what we've been
[1:03:49] hearing. The church age has not closed.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; We're still in the seventh age. We are
[1:03:55] still under the seventh messenger. And
[1:03:57] you still have a right to the original
[1:03:59] new birth even tonight in this place.
[1:04:03] Hallelujah. You have a right to the
[1:04:04] power of the spirit manifested. You have
[1:04:06] a right to the gifts. Oh, brother Aaron,
[1:04:09] I don't know about that. You do have a
[1:04:10] right to it. Prophet of God says, "What
[1:04:13] the church had at Pentecost is in her is
[1:04:15] her inaliable right originally." Now,
[1:04:18] these are what your rights. She had the
[1:04:20] pure word of God. You have it. She had
[1:04:23] the power of the spirit manifested in
[1:04:24] diverse signs and wonders and gifts of
[1:04:28] the Holy Ghost. Listen, we live in the
[1:04:30] age of people's rights. When everybody's
[1:04:33] running around clamoring for this and my
[1:04:34] right this and claiming all kind of
[1:04:36] nonsense, well, since it's the age of
[1:04:38] people's rights, I think it's time that
[1:04:39] you as a people raise up and desend to
[1:04:42] begin to fight for your rights. These
[1:04:44] are your rights. You have the right to
[1:04:46] the movement of the spirit. You have the
[1:04:47] right for the gifts to be in operation.
[1:04:49] You have the right to the new birth.
[1:04:51] Don't let anybody take it from you, lie
[1:04:53] to you, pin you up, and say this is how
[1:04:55] it's got to be. You have a right. And
[1:04:58] it's the age of people's rights and
[1:05:00] we're living in it. So you might as well
[1:05:01] fight for your rights that God gave you.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Not some demon thing. I have this right,
[1:05:07] this right. I'm telling you the rights
[1:05:08] that God said, these are yours. Let no
[1:05:11] man take that away from you. Hallelujah.
[1:05:18] Many are growing cold.
[1:05:22] Many are laying down their rights and
[1:05:24] once again slipping back towards
[1:05:25] nickelanism.
[1:05:27] formalism,
[1:05:30] cold, dead, stripped of everything but
[1:05:33] their head knowledge.
[1:05:35] They can quote you and debate and put
[1:05:38] everything just right.
[1:05:41] And none of this,
[1:05:46] not bad people,
[1:05:48] not lost people, not saying none of
[1:05:50] that, saying they've allowed something
[1:05:52] to come in and begin to squeeze life.
[1:05:56] Don't let that happen to you. I'm not
[1:05:59] even talking about Evening Light
[1:06:00] Tabernacle as a whole. You know what
[1:06:02] makes up Evening Light Tabernacle as a
[1:06:03] whole? Individuals.
[1:06:06] Do you know how that happens as a whole?
[1:06:08] When individuals let that happen. You
[1:06:10] know what causes a revival in a church
[1:06:12] as a whole? When individuals have a
[1:06:14] revival.
[1:06:17] It always comes back down to the
[1:06:18] individual.
[1:06:21] Don't lay down your rights. Don't accept
[1:06:24] formalism. Don't accept cold. If people
[1:06:26] are sitting around you in a church
[1:06:28] service dead and and formal and and and
[1:06:31] cold, that don't mean you have to.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; I mean, how many times, and I've been
[1:06:35] guilty of this. How many times have have
[1:06:37] you heard it said, "Man, it just it just
[1:06:40] seemed off in there today or it seemed
[1:06:42] dead or it seemed like something was
[1:06:44] hindering." Okay. Well, if you recognize
[1:06:46] it, why didn't you fight it?
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; If you recognize it, why weren't you
[1:06:50] willing to peck against the egg and
[1:06:51] stand up and say, "Glory
[1:06:56] We've all we've all heard it told how
[1:06:59] how the Welsh revival began with one
[1:07:01] precious sister standing up saying, "I
[1:07:03] love you, Lord Jesus, with all of my
[1:07:06] heart." If that can start a revival that
[1:07:09] swept for for years and and what can it
[1:07:11] do for a church service?
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; What can it do for one moment when maybe
[1:07:16] there's one person sitting there bound
[1:07:18] that needs a deliverance, that needs a
[1:07:19] moment, that needs a breakthrough? But
[1:07:21] it's one of those services that seems
[1:07:22] cold. It's one of those services that
[1:07:24] seems like something's hindering. But
[1:07:25] what if that one person was willing to
[1:07:27] say, "I'm not going to stand for this,
[1:07:29] but I'm going to fight for our rights.
[1:07:31] I'm going to enter in. I'm going to
[1:07:32] create an atmosphere. I'm going to watch
[1:07:34] it spread. And then I'm going to see
[1:07:36] somebody have the courage to break
[1:07:37] through into the Holy Ghost."
[1:07:40] We don't have to sit back and accept
[1:07:43] cold and formal and dead.
[1:07:46] Hallelujah.
[1:07:49] He says, "But thank God,
[1:07:52] in the last age, there will be a group
[1:07:55] rise up." He's talking about me,
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; the true bride of the last day, and she
[1:08:01] will listen to the spirit. In that day
[1:08:02] of gross darkness, the light will return
[1:08:05] by the pure word, and we will return to
[1:08:08] the power of Pentecost to welcome back
[1:08:11] the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm going to put
[1:08:13] it like this. There's an equation here.
[1:08:15] Without the power of Pentecost, we're
[1:08:17] not going to be able to welcome back the
[1:08:19] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; 2 plus 2 equals 4. If you take one of
[1:08:24] those twos out, it no longer equals. You
[1:08:26] want the end result? We've got to return
[1:08:29] to the power of Pentecost because he's
[1:08:31] not coming back for a cold church, a
[1:08:33] formal church, a leadyan church. He's
[1:08:36] coming back for bone of his bone and
[1:08:38] flesh of his flesh and power of his
[1:08:40] power and works of his works. And he
[1:08:42] sees it and he says, "Yep, she's ready."
[1:08:44] just like the one that I started 2,000
[1:08:47] years ago. So now I can return to
[1:08:51] receive her.
[1:08:53] This is the age of apostasy. He says,
[1:08:56] "This is the age of the restoration.
[1:08:58] It's the age of the finished cycle. With
[1:09:01] this,
[1:09:02] it's all over."
[1:09:05] So we conclude the seven church ages,
[1:09:08] saying only what the spirit said to each
[1:09:11] age.
[1:09:13] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[1:09:16] the spirit
[1:09:18] saith unto the churches.
[1:09:22] And I love what he says on this last
[1:09:23] slide I'm going to put up because it's
[1:09:24] so true. If you get into the message
[1:09:27] yourself, you'll find this to be true.
[1:09:30] You'll never find Brother Brandham
[1:09:31] telling people, "Come to my church."
[1:09:34] You'll never find him telling people,
[1:09:36] "You got to come and be part of my
[1:09:37] group." He wasn't interested in building
[1:09:40] a kingdom.
[1:09:41] He was interested in people having a
[1:09:44] relationship with Jesus Christ.
[1:09:47] He said, "Not for one moment do I bring
[1:09:49] a message to the people that they may
[1:09:51] follow me, join my church, start some
[1:09:53] fellowship and organization. I've never
[1:09:56] done that and will not do that now. I
[1:09:58] have no interest in those things. But I
[1:10:01] do have an interest in the things of God
[1:10:03] and people. And if I can accomplish just
[1:10:06] one thing, I will be satisfied. That one
[1:10:09] thing is to see establish a true
[1:10:10] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:10:13] men, wherein men become new creations in
[1:10:16] Christ, filled with his spirit and live
[1:10:19] according to his word.
[1:10:23] Young people,
[1:10:25] that's our desire here.
[1:10:28] The ministry here, the the the parents,
[1:10:31] uh, everybody that works to make this
[1:10:33] church happen.
[1:10:37] Say this in a way to you don't think I'm
[1:10:38] okay if if you leave. I never want to
[1:10:41] see any of y'all leave.
[1:10:44] But what I want is the will of God in
[1:10:46] your life.
[1:10:47] We're not interested in how many people
[1:10:49] are on our roles. We don't have roles,
[1:10:51] but you know what I mean. We're not
[1:10:53] interested in how big our Sunday crowd
[1:10:55] is.
[1:10:58] I'm not interested in in you seeing
[1:11:00] things my way. Brother Tim's not
[1:11:02] interested in Brother Joe. They're not
[1:11:04] interested in in you seeing things
[1:11:05] exactly the way they see things. We're
[1:11:08] interested in you knowing him.
[1:11:12] We're interested in in you growing in
[1:11:15] him and and deepening your relationship
[1:11:18] in him. And because the truths have been
[1:11:21] restored in this day, you have the
[1:11:24] opportunity to know him like most of
[1:11:27] those down through the ages never had.
[1:11:30] A great opportunity.
[1:11:32] service after service,
[1:11:34] day after day, really because you got
[1:11:36] the prophet's message. You've got
[1:11:38] access,
[1:11:41] and once again, I'm not promote. I'm
[1:11:42] just saying you got access to sermons
[1:11:45] from ministry all over the world. You've
[1:11:46] got access to one of the greatest
[1:11:49] ministries on the face of the earth
[1:11:50] today. You've got access to the prophets
[1:11:53] ministry, the one that that that that
[1:11:55] we're here because of.
[1:11:58] You have access that other ages never
[1:12:00] had. Many of the ages we spoke of
[1:12:03] tonight didn't have a Bible in their
[1:12:04] language.
[1:12:06] And yet they stood and they scratched
[1:12:09] and they clawed and they fought for any
[1:12:12] little morsel they could get.
[1:12:16] Don't stand there next to a storehouse
[1:12:19] full of food, full of fresh spiritual
[1:12:23] vitamins, food in due season, food
[1:12:25] that'll take you to a rapture and fill
[1:12:28] up on junk food every day.
[1:12:32] Don't neglect to feed on this message.
[1:12:36] Don't don't don't neglect to have
[1:12:38] communion with God. And I don't mean to
[1:12:41] oversimplify it. You got to start
[1:12:43] somewhere.
[1:12:45] Give him 15 minutes in the morning.
[1:12:49] Give him 15 minutes a night. Brother
[1:12:50] Aaron, that's I'm just just start
[1:12:52] somewhere. Start building that
[1:12:54] relationship. It may not be a building.
[1:12:57] It may be a block. But we heard
[1:12:59] Wednesday, it's a sure foundation.
[1:13:02] You start spending a little bit more
[1:13:03] time with him. Watch your life begin to
[1:13:05] line up a little better.
[1:13:08] Watch things start to become a little
[1:13:09] bit clearer. Watch it become easier to
[1:13:13] get along with brothers and sisters. I'm
[1:13:16] just saying. You're putting good things
[1:13:18] in you. Good things come out.
[1:13:21] You live in the greatest age it's ever
[1:13:24] been. But brother, I thought it was the
[1:13:26] most wicked. Yeah, but it's the greatest
[1:13:28] because we stand in a time where the
[1:13:30] seals have been ripped off. All the
[1:13:32] mysteries are revealed. The truth of the
[1:13:34] new birth is revealed. You have access
[1:13:36] to everything. And you're on the verge
[1:13:37] of the coming of the Lord. Don't waste
[1:13:40] that opportunity.
[1:13:44] Because of what's been restored, you can
[1:13:46] be born again just like those in the
[1:13:48] upper room. Matter of fact, you must be.
[1:13:53] And that's our goal.
[1:13:55] That's what we preach here, brother.
[1:13:58] What's y'all's focus? The new birth.
[1:14:04] But but what if I don't understand
[1:14:08] the new birth?
[1:14:11] That's the focus
[1:14:13] because that is the token.
[1:14:17] And you got to have the token to get on
[1:14:18] the train.
[1:14:20] Brother Brandon would tell you red
[1:14:21] lights are flashing. Throw down your
[1:14:24] worldly bag of peanuts.
[1:14:26] Get ready to get on board. It's harvest
[1:14:29] time. We've been hearing it. It's
[1:14:31] harvest time. All things are being made
[1:14:35] ready.
[1:14:38] Are you
[1:14:40] ready? You bow your heads with me.
[1:14:44] I know a lot of this was just review. A
[1:14:46] lot of it was just very factual,
[1:14:49] historical.
[1:14:51] You know, it's incredible to be able to
[1:14:53] look at the anointed word, the revealed
[1:14:55] word of the day, and and look at history
[1:14:59] that's already passed and have the
[1:15:02] reality of that history revealed to you.
[1:15:05] That it was more than just history and
[1:15:07] facts and governments, but it was a true
[1:15:09] vine and a false vine and there was a
[1:15:10] war going on. And what did it all lead
[1:15:13] to, brother? And how'd it turn out?
[1:15:17] It led to right here.
[1:15:20] And it turns out with a harvest,
[1:15:23] it turns out that the false vine is
[1:15:25] going to be bound and burned.
[1:15:30] The tears, but the wheat, they're about
[1:15:33] to go on a rapture.
[1:15:37] That's where we're standing.
[1:15:42] And I have such great admiration and
[1:15:45] respect
[1:15:46] for every single one of you because what
[1:15:51] I recognize as even
[1:15:53] the most struggling young person in in
[1:15:56] our ranks
[1:15:59] is still such a wonderful soul that God
[1:16:02] has put here that's fighting the battle.
[1:16:04] Maybe you fell in time after time and
[1:16:05] that anchor just hadn't got there. But I
[1:16:08] see the fight.
[1:16:10] I see the struggle. I don't see a bunch
[1:16:13] of quitters.
[1:16:16] You wouldn't be here. It's a Friday
[1:16:18] night, man. You know how much
[1:16:20] entertainment things you could be in
[1:16:21] right now? But where are you at?
[1:16:24] What brought you? What drew you?
[1:16:27] Why can you feed? Why can you come and
[1:16:29] give up a Friday for this? Because
[1:16:31] there's something on the inside of you.
[1:16:34] What did it say? He said Rome could kill
[1:16:36] them. Rome could burn them. road could
[1:16:37] do all those things, but it couldn't get
[1:16:38] to that spirit on the inside of them.
[1:16:41] Leotia can make it evil. They can be
[1:16:43] perverted. They can put entertainment
[1:16:45] around you. They can push all kind of
[1:16:46] stuff down your throat, but they can't
[1:16:48] get to that sea gene of God. And that's
[1:16:51] why you're here.
[1:16:53] I want you to know you're appreciated. I
[1:16:55] want you to know that you're loved, that
[1:16:56] you're cared for. And please don't think
[1:17:00] you have to fight this battle alone.
[1:17:03] You got an incredible pastor. He He's
[1:17:06] recently offered he's going to do
[1:17:07] questions and answers and take advantage
[1:17:09] of that. Take advantage of that. You got
[1:17:12] Brother Joe and Brother Timothy and
[1:17:14] myself and well, I don't I don't want to
[1:17:16] bother y'all. Y'all are busy. That's
[1:17:18] what we're here for.
[1:17:21] I'm never too busy for you. That's a
[1:17:24] promise. I want you to hear me. I'm
[1:17:26] never too busy for you.
[1:17:29] We will lay down what we're doing to to
[1:17:31] talk with you, to pray with you. Don't
[1:17:33] think you got to fight this all by
[1:17:35] yourself. And I know, look, God, the
[1:17:37] most important one, he said, "I'll never
[1:17:39] leave you and forsake you." But I want
[1:17:41] you to know that you got brothers, you
[1:17:43] got sisters here that are willing to
[1:17:45] stand by your side and fight for you.
[1:17:49] Quit thinking you're in this alone.
[1:17:52] Quit thinking you're not going to make
[1:17:53] it. I'm here to tell you, you are going
[1:17:54] to make it. You're not going to be bound
[1:17:57] and burned, but you're going to be taken
[1:17:58] into the garner. You're going to be
[1:18:00] taken in the rapture where there's
[1:18:02] eternal life.
[1:18:04] Who you talking to, brother Aaron? If
[1:18:05] you're under the sound of my voice, I'm
[1:18:07] talking to you.
[1:18:10] He that hath an ear, let him hear.
[1:18:14] And I'm just offering right now if if if
[1:18:17] there's anything in your life and and
[1:18:19] you just want to come to the altar
[1:18:20] tonight and make it right. Just lay it
[1:18:22] down. You say, "I got some things I want
[1:18:24] to lay down. I got some things I want to
[1:18:26] line up. I want to make some things I
[1:18:27] want to make sure of." Hey, this is the
[1:18:29] make sure get ready, lay down time.
[1:18:33] If you know right now that if Jesus

[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; But say, "God, help me get those things
[1:20:17] in their place. Help me put those things
[1:20:20] where they're supposed to be. Where I
[1:20:21] can elevate you in my life so I can
[1:20:24] sing. Lord, I'm ready to go.
[1:20:27] That's my heart's cry tonight.

[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you're calling your drawing,
[1:21:08] Lord, in this last day, Lord, that you
[1:21:11] sent a message, Lord, to pull back the
[1:21:13] scales off our eyes and let us recognize
[1:21:16] we're standing right there. It's going
[1:21:18] home time. It's leaving time. It's
[1:21:19] rapture time.
[1:21:21] And I'm going to be ready.
[1:21:24] How How can you say that? Because a
[1:21:26] message has turned my heart. It's turned
[1:21:29] my heart and it said, "I'm not going to
[1:21:30] leave you, but I'm returning you to the
[1:21:32] power of Pentecost. I'm returning you to
[1:21:34] a place where you can have overcoming
[1:21:36] life, victorious life, where you can
[1:21:38] rise above, lay out a sea, and victory
[1:21:40] tonight. And because of that, because of
[1:21:42] the new birth, I'm going to be ready to
[1:21:44] go. Lord,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; I'm laying it all down tonight. I'm
[1:21:47] giving everything to you.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Going to be ready.
[1:22:04] Going to be ready to go.
[1:22:12] I'm going to be ready.
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:20] Going to be ready to go.
[1:22:28] I'm going to be ready.
[1:22:33] Yes, I'm
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:22:36] going to be ready to go.
[1:22:42] And lately all
[1:22:45] I've got is leave
[1:22:49] on
[1:22:51] my mind.
[1:22:57] Oh, it seems
[1:23:00] as all I've been thinking
[1:23:04] about
[1:23:07] so much of the time
[1:23:15] and very soon
[1:23:19] I'll leave my trles
[1:23:24] fall
[1:23:25] behind.
[1:23:29] Just leave me out. I've got
[1:23:39] even
[1:23:41] my
[1:23:45] lately all
[1:23:47] I've got
[1:23:49] is sleeping
[1:23:51] on
[1:23:53] my mind.
[1:23:59] Oh. Oh. It seems
[1:24:03] that's all I'm thinking
[1:24:07] about.
[1:24:10] Oh,
[1:24:12] so much of the time
[1:24:20] and very soon
[1:24:23] I'll give
[1:24:25] my troubles.
[1:24:28] Oh, I'll be
[1:24:33] laying
[1:24:35] down. I've got live
[1:24:43] on
[1:24:45] my mind
[1:24:48] and lately on
[1:24:51] I've got
[1:24:53] to sleep.
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:56] Oh yes, on my mind.
[1:25:04] Oh, it seems
[1:25:07] that's all I'm thinking
[1:25:11] about.
[1:25:15] Oh, so much of the time
[1:25:21] that see
[1:25:27] I leave
[1:25:29] the trles
[1:25:32] far behind.

[1:25:38] me out.
[1:25:41] I leave
[1:25:43] with you.
[1:25:46] Leave it alone.
[1:25:49] I've seen that second prayer.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; So I guess
[1:25:56] I should be looking for
[1:26:01] a better
[1:26:03] place to live.
[1:26:09] But I just can't seem to get excited
[1:26:15] about
[1:26:16] this world
[1:26:19] and all it has to me.
[1:26:24] Oh, I could
[1:26:26] care less
[1:26:28] if I could buy it all
[1:26:32] with a solitary
[1:26:37] night.
[1:26:40] for one good
[1:26:44] this world
[1:26:46] to me.
[1:26:49] Oh, with the rapture on my mind.
[1:26:59] And lately all
[1:27:02] I've got
[1:27:04] is
[1:27:07] on my mind.
[1:27:13] Oh yes.
[1:27:16] It seems
[1:27:18] that's all
[1:27:20] I'm thinking
[1:27:22] about.
[1:27:26] So much so much time.
[1:27:30] [Music]
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; And very
[1:27:36] soon
[1:27:38] I'll leave
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; I'll leave
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; my trles
