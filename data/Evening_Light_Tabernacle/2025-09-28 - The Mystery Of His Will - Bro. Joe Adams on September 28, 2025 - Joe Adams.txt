========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] There have been a few changes to include my lack of a microphone for a few moments. Just bear with the technicians. We're really happy that the musicians have a a nice spot. They're a little more spread out. I think some of the feedback that we've gotten is, "Wow, it's nice not to look at the back of somebody's head when you're trying to play with them." So, that's a great improvement. Would you agree that's a nice improvement? Amen. Our pastor's away this morning. He's taking the memorial service for brother Ed Biscll up in Cloverdale Bible Way and Brother Timuit's taking that service with him this morning. So, we they coveret our prayers. So, as they've prayed for you this morning to be here, uh we do want to remember them in prayer as well. Um we had a very nice workday yesterday because of who you are. It's in the key of G. We had a very nice workday yesterday. A lot was accomplished. So, for those of you that were able to come and put your shoulder to the wheel as it were, we certainly do appreciate that. There was a lot of pressure washing done and you know, just basic grounds cleanup. you know, we have uh special meetings coming and why we wouldn't want somebody to come and see a church that doesn't look quite cared for. So, it's nice to be able to do those things at this time. Weather was wonderful. And now it's the Lord's day. So, we just want to come into his courts with praise and thanksgiving on our hearts. See what he would do in our midst today. See what he would do for you. Maybe do for a loved one. Maybe the person sitting next to you. Amen. We just want to invite him to come this morning.

Oh, you want to see all your loved ones waiting there for you. I know I do. Got a lot of them as you go down. [Music] Sorry.

But with him, we're unstoppable. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What a mighty word. What a mighty God we have in this hour. We just want to greet you this morning. Thankful for all that are here. Uh you know, our pastors away and the other ministry teams away. And we appreciate you being here, not forsaking the assembling together. I also want to say thank you to each and everyone that showed up yesterday for the church work day. We got a lot of things accomplished back in the fellowship hall. You go in there, you'll see sound panels are up. The front landscaping, we spent four hours, a team of about 10 people cleaning that up and freshening up the front there. Stuck over repairs were done in many places. Power washing was done in several places. So, a lot of things were accomplished and I I want to say thank you for those that attended that helped. We had a lot of the young boys came out and put their shoulders to the wheel and woo must be nice to be 24 22 again. Man, I'm wore out this morning. But we're here. We're at our post of duty and we just want to come and put our shoulder to the will and trust that we can speak to you. That will something that will bless your soul, bless your spirit. Maybe you've ever questioned the message, question your position in the body, why were you raised in the message, come to this church. Maybe by the grace of God today, we can kind of help answer some of those questions. Let's just go to him in prayer this morning. Father, Lord, we want to say thank you that you've called us into your presence, Lord. And Lord, we believe that you've extended to us in this hour your golden scepter that we as your people, Lord, can come. We can bring our petitions before you today, Father, knowing, Lord, that you would not withhold any good thing to us who walk uprightly, Lord. We don't walk on accordance to our merits, maybe the family we were born into, Lord, or any of the good deeds that we have done, Father, but it's according to your purpose and your will, Lord, that we were chosen in you before the foundation of the world. And Lord, since we were chosen in you, as I said before, you didn't choose us to lose us, Lord. So, we're so thankful we can come today. And we just pray God that you would anoint your servant to get out of the way that you can be able to Lord speak to your people. May you just anoint the ears of the hearer Lord. Maybe some are going through a battle Lord and and the word just seems to just be there but it's not really having an impact. I pray to this morning, Father, that the word find a bedding ground. It'll it'll find an impact, Lord, and it'll begin to manifest and grow today. So we just we commit the service to you, Father. Bless our visitors that's in the midst today. May you just reward their faith in each of us likewise in Jesus name. Amen. If you have your Bibles this morning, we're going to look here in the book of Ephesians. Remember the prophet taught us that the book of Ephesians parallels the book of Joshua, which is the placing of the elect in the land of promise. So this morning, we're just going to look here and I've been kind of on a theme coming out of Ephesians for the last several services and several more to go. If and when I have an opportunity to speak to you again, we'll look at some more things, different angles. Seems like the more you study, you kind of branch off here and branch off there. And the Lord kind of continues to re reveal himself to us. We find here in Ephesians 1 and verse three it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. Notice verse four according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. And when you read this I want you to clue in on several of these major points that he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. That we should be holy without blame before him in love. Verse five, having predestinated us unto the adoption placing of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. key in on that. He had done this for us, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him, in whom also we have attained ained of inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. Just for the record, that clock back there is wrong. So, I have several hours to preach. It's not even nine o'clock. So, don't blame me if we go a little lengthy this morning. But somebody's Yeah, they're not doing their job or we didn't catch it. So, but anyway, I want to speak to you this morning briefly. Briefly, huh? When a preacher says that, he's lying, right? But I want to speak to you on the mystery of his will. the mystery of his will. And we take this from verse nine or let's go back to verse eight. Wherein he he is in God had abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence. Then he goes into verse nine. How did he abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence? By having made known unto us the wisdom of his will. Now this or the mystery of his will. And this word mystery, the English word mystery is something that is dark, obscure, secret, puzzling. It's inexplicable, incomprehensible. But it comes from the Greek word mysterion, which it has a completely different meaning. The word mysterion in the Greek, it actually means a truth here to here to hidden from human knowledge of understanding, but now being disclosed by revelation of God. So it's a religious truth that one can know only by revelation can it only be fully known. So you got mystery that we would think of a mystery dark obscure but a mystery when we look at it through the biblical eyes we find that it is it means a truth that was previously hidden but now being revealed by God. &gt;&gt; So it's a divine purpose that was not fully understood in past but has been made known through the gospel. And we're going to kind of take this. We look at Paul. Paul is the he would be the church founder, the first church age messenger. And he would begin to preach to the Gentiles. And he'd begin to reveal the mystery of God to the Gentile people. Remember prior to Paul, it was the Pharisees, the Sadducees, Jews, Jews, Jews. But when Paul came on the scene, his ministry was not directed to the Jews. His ministry was to the Gentiles. So we find here in Ephesians 3, Paul would even say, "For this cause," 3:1, Paul would say, "For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles, if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given to me toward you, how that by revelation, notice how it's coming. It's coming by revelation, he made known unto me the mystery." Remember the thing that was hidden, but now been made known. The mystery, as I wrote a fore in few words, whereby when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellow hairs of and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel. So God uses Paul to declare to declare specifically how Jews and Gentiles now will be joined together in Christ. So, no longer are the Jews separate, I mean the Gentiles separate from the Jews, but now through Paul's ministry and through Paul's revelation and through the mystery that God would give Paul the revelation, he begins to include the Gentiles, you and I, Gentiles into the part of the economy of God. And we find so we find this was hint hinted at down through the ages. But yet God could not find a man to put his hand on to bring forth this revelation. But Paul on the back side of the desert in Arabia, he began to find God. He began to receive from God. No man taught Paul these great things. Remember he sat under the great teacher Galia. But Paul would even say everything that I learned I had to count it as dung so that I would know Jesus Christ and him crucified. So this understanding that Paul received it didn't come by school of the prophets. It didn't come by seminary degrees. It didn't come by man's intellect and man's wisdom. Paul's revelation came from God. And he be now clue in. He be to reveal to the Gentiles the mystery of God. Paul began to bring the revelation of the mystery of God to the gentile people. &gt;&gt; Now, Paul's group, I believe they were well taught. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe Paul's group could say that we could say that Paul's group was probably expecting the return of Christ. &gt;&gt; Just any day now. They were waiting. They were expecting. Paul had great understanding. Paul had great revelation. But can I say this? Paul didn't have all the revelation. And I say that very sub subjectively because we're going to find through the scripture today and why God sent us a message. &gt;&gt; All right. So we look here. All the mysteries wasn't revealed to Paul. &gt;&gt; See, he wasn't aware that there were going to be seven gentile church ages. He wasn't aware that there was going to be seven messengers to each church age and that there would be a further or greater unfolding of the mystery of God's will down through every church age. &gt;&gt; See in each age there was going to be a greater or additional outpouring of this revelation. But we find in Ephesians 1 and verse 9 but he began Paul would get say having made known unto us. So church, we have to make it personal this morning that we can look and we can see somebody has a great revelation here or a great revelation there, but what about your understanding of the word of God? What about your revelation? And Paul begins to make it personal. Notice it come through a one-man ministry. &gt;&gt; The revelation came through a prophet, came through Paul, the first church age messenger. But he says, but it was came for us. The mystery, not only was it to just be placed in a prophet, but the mystery that God was making known was to be made known to the gentile race. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he sold us, having made known unto us the mystery of his will. And that word again, I'm going to say it over and over and over today because I want you to understand and we've been well taught by brother Tim that sometimes repetition helps you learn. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the key word in this entire sermon today is mystery. Something that was hidden but now being revealed. &gt;&gt; So we find this word Paul's saying mystery, a hidden thing, a secret, a hidden purpose or counsel, secret will, religious secrets confiding only to the initiated and not to ordinary mortals. &gt;&gt; So this is not just to ordinary mortals. So look at your neighbor. You're not ordinary. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Say amen, brother L. &gt;&gt; She's not ordinary. Nor are you. &gt;&gt; No. God separated us from ordinary mortals. And we're going to look at this. I have quotes and I have scriptures to prove that point. But having made known to us the secret of his will. And that word will there many times we gloss over these things and we read and we just we read to try to read quickly and oh I got a chapter in but if you stop and just dissect some of these words and look at the Greek meaning behind them but this word will there means choice or purpose or desire or pleasure what one wishes or has determined shall be done. So God here through Paul begins to reveal the secret thing that God had purposed before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; God begins to unfold it to him. Now we go to first Timothy 3 and verse 16. Kind of take my time today and kind of work through this. And it may not be super evangelistic, but you know that's neither here nor there. I want this to anchor in our hearts. 1 Timothy 3:16, Paul again, now he's writing to Timothy. He says, "Without controversy, great is the mystery." That key word again, something that's hidden but now revealed, "The mystery of godliness." &gt;&gt; Then he begins to explain what that mystery is. God was manifested in flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into glory. So God, the mystery of godliness, God was manifested in the flesh. So we have to understand, if I can say it like this this morning, we have to understand the mystery of godliness so that we can understand the mystery of his will. So we have to understand the characteristics of of God, the nature of God to understand who God is. And we find here by the scripture that it says that God was manifested in the flesh. Notice the first mystery. How can God be 100% eternal spirit and yet be 100% man humanity? &gt;&gt; But see, we we don't know what it means to be eternal spirit. We don't know what it means to be flawless. We don't know what it means to live perfect. We don't know what it means to be without weaknesses. And yet here God, here he is. No flaws, no weaknesses, no shortcomings, great eternal spirit knows all. And yet he comes into fallen humanity. That's a mystery &gt;&gt; that God became flesh. Great eternal spirit now becomes one of us. Like one of us to have pains like us. To wake up with a headache like us. To have hard times like us. great eternal God coming to become a man so that he can be a great sucker for you and I in this hour so he can be a perpetuation for us. He knows what it means and how it feels to go through human battles. And God can only do that by becoming man. And it's a great mystery. &gt;&gt; How can God do that? Here he was God the eternal word made flesh was manifested in flesh. In the beginning was the word. The word was God. The word was with God. Then you drop down to verse 14. And the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; Then we find that it says he was justified in the spirit. Notice he was justified in spirit, but he was reproached as a sinner. He was put to death as a malifactor. He was made sin for us and was delivered for our offenses. But yet he was justified of the spirit. He didn't stay in a grave. He rose again. Why? because the spirit lifted him up. &gt;&gt; Never before has this been done. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. &gt;&gt; But Paul begins to unfold this revelation to us. He was seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles. Another part of the mystery that the Gentiles would receive the message of Jesus Christ. that which was purposed by Moses, that which is purposed down through the Old Testament prophets for a people for God's name's sake. And yet we find that the Gentiles, the heathens were included in the plan and purpose of God. &gt;&gt; He was believed on into the world. He was preached and he he was received up into the glory of the ascension. Now listen what brother Bram says here in the scriptural sign of the time. He says, "Without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. For God was manifested in the flesh, seen of angels, handled here in the world, received up into glory." So we find this now that he was God made flesh. He tabernacled with us. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He changed his great position from being great eternal one as we spoke last night. He was the attribute of his own thought. He became down here and become man to redeem man. I say thank you God this morning. &gt;&gt; So great eternal God humbled himself. He left all the glory. He became man in order to redeem fallen humanity. And that word redeem there means to be brought back. Listen how your prophet when you go and you look the word up redeem and how he would place it many times he would change the order of it or change the name the nature of it but it still means the same thing to be brought back to bring back to where you started from to bring back where you once were or to bring back to its original place or place of origin. So that tells me that this earth is not our original place. Louisiana as great as it is. Roll of the eyes for y'all on stream. As great as it is, it's magnificent magnificant however of a state that we live in. That's not our place of origin. &gt;&gt; But we find God through a vindicated messenger. God through a vindicated prophet will begin to reveal to you and I our place of origin. And we find here that God became man in order to redeem us, to restore us back to that place. So don't get caught up in this flesh. Don't get caught up in what's going on around you. Don't get caught up in politics. Don't get caught up in the bad days and the good days. No. Get caught up in the word. &gt;&gt; Get caught up under revelation. Say, "God, show me where I come from. Show me where I'm going. Lord, &gt;&gt; make known to me the mystery of your will, your purpose for me, for my life, for my family. &gt;&gt; That's what we should be asking. Notice here, then we go to 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 19. We're going to build this scripture on top of scripture. &gt;&gt; But brother B, as you turn there, Brother Bam says, "Redeeming to buy back is it restores to the original owner." Amen. &gt;&gt; See, God by his death, shed blood, brought back his own. He brought back the spoken word seed bride. &gt;&gt; God did it. He did it by himself. Then we find 2 Corinthians 5 verse 19 to it that God eternal spirit was in Christ human vessel reconciling the world to himself. not imputing their trespasses upon them, and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation. That word reconciliation, now I'm an accountant. Levi's accountant. We got a couple more accountants here, but it means something completely different than our accounting terminology. This word reconciliation here means to bring back into favor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. where once you were out of favor because you came in sin, you were shaped in iniquity, you needed a heavenly father, you needed a redeemer, you needed a kinsman, and God stepped down out of glory to do what? To reconcile, to bring you fallen humanity, sin cursed humanity back in favor with God again. &gt;&gt; It means to return to favor with to to receive one into favor. &gt;&gt; Say, "Thanks be to God." God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. So all that God was, &gt;&gt; he poured into Jesus. &gt;&gt; And all that Jesus was, he poured into the church. So how did God return us to favor? He poured his life into us. &gt;&gt; So you're not here this morning. How many of you are here by show of hands? &gt;&gt; Some of you are not here. You're just your body's present. I got you. But you're here. You're not just here by mistake. &gt;&gt; You're not just sitting and eating like tabernacle. You don't just come to this church. You're not just born into that family. The message is just just didn't come by your way &gt;&gt; haphazardly. &gt;&gt; No. But God purposely done these things. Why? To return you into back to favor with God again. That means your place of origin was somewhere. And the great revelation is being made known in this day through a seventh angel is to let us know where is that place? Where did we come from? Where are we going? &gt;&gt; He would say in the super sign. He says now the super sign was first man was the first man that God could come into. All that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church. the super sign, God and man together. That was to be the super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days. We keep going here. But we find today we got Superman. Now, Superman was my favorite cartoon character. I told y'all before me and my brother, we'd put a we'd put a towel around and he would be, you know, one of the other ones. You can have you can be one of those. I'd put that towel around, climb up on the dresser. Woo! Jump off on the bed. Superman. Yeah, I was about that tall and about that wide. But something was super about me. All right, but let me dream. Right. &gt;&gt; But he said the world had their superman or fatic fictitious superman, all these other kind of super things, but the church has got a super sign. Listen what it is. God back in the church. &gt;&gt; There's your super sign church. God almighty, eternal spirit back now in the church. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. God back in the church, manifested in human flesh. God united with man his sure super sign. See the eternal sign, an unfailing sign. It would never fail. The word and man become one. When God's word and man become one. But notice if we're not careful, we will make this statement, God united with man, here super sign about one man. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; We've seen it. We've seen the failure of humanity grasping for a super sign, for a superman. We make it all about one. We make it all about a prophet. But remember, it's God back in the church. &gt;&gt; Manifested in human flesh. &gt;&gt; God united with man. Or can I say it like this? God united in mankind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just one man, but mankind. God united in humanity with humanity. He says that was the super sign of the day. when that same spirit that was on Jesus Christ comes into the church to manifest the written word for the day that is still the super sign. So the super sign is still God ever remains true to the super sign. It's God in manifesting his written word. Now how many knows what the super sign is? &gt;&gt; Okay, I got two of y'all. Thank God if somebody's listening. It's okay to participate this morning. God's great super science is not just God and Tim Puit. Not just God and Timothy Puit or Aaron Ogensby or Donnie Reagan or Ron Spencer or any great preacher you want to put there or William Brandom or Paul or Arenus Columba, Martin Luther, all these other ones. Wesley, it's not God just in these great men. But it's God in flesh again. It's God sitting on these pews this morning. It's God hearing the word. It's revelation being unfolded to a predestinated sea. A son and daughter of God this morning, not in the days past, not in history, but God present tense this morning. &gt;&gt; That's the super sign that this message is true. That God is true. That he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. For some people, all the message is is God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; But can I tell you this morning, it's more than just God sending a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who did he send them to this morning? &gt;&gt; There's got to be a recipient of the the prophet's message. And I'm looking at it this morning. &gt;&gt; And he's making known to us the mystery, the hidden thing, hidden purpose of his will. Well, I was just born into the Adam's family. No. It's more than just &gt;&gt; I can't even snap this morning. It's more than just belonging to evening like tabernacle. &gt;&gt; And we understand Revelations 10:7. If you'll go there with me this morning, I want to try to tie all this together so it will erase any question regarding you and regarding this message &gt;&gt; and regarding a prophet. &gt;&gt; The more that I study, the more that I grow, the greater the revelation comes, the greater the purpose and the meaning behind this message. We look here, Revelations 10. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, now we can all agree that that day is here or that that day has passed, the seventh angel's gone. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound the mystery, there's that word again, that hidden secret, the hidden purpose of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants, the prophets. So we know by scripture that the seventh angel, he will reveal things that the previous messengers were not permitted to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that okay this morning? Is it safe to say that? So Paul be began to reveal. &gt;&gt; All right. Corinthians, Ephesians, different areas. Second Timothy, different scriptures. Paul began to reveal the mystery of God. But the seventh angel in his day, in his ministry, he's going to finish &gt;&gt; the revelation. That's right. Notice it's not that brother Brandham brought a different message, &gt;&gt; but he's finishing the revelation &gt;&gt; that Paul started. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, the seventh angel is preaching what the first angel preached. &gt;&gt; Not a different message, not a new message. But the messenger will, what is what he does? He will take the loose ends. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; He's going to take the loose ends from all their previous ages. &gt;&gt; Great men. Some were reformers. They didn't they weren't prophets. They didn't have that revelation. They had loose sins. And brother Bram makes a statement here in the breach. He says, "Now at the sounding of the seven church age, the last church age, all the loose ends that through these church ages has been progged at." And I had to look that word up. I'm thinking, man, surely he got that wrong. No, it's Pragged. Prague means to search and to forage. So men down through the ages been searching for the revelation, searching and forging for the re understanding of the mystery of God. And he says, "All that they have progged it will be wound up together." &gt;&gt; So then he goes into the first seal at the end of the Pentecostal age. I'm thinking I'm assuming the the uh Isuza Street Pentecostal age, which would be the Leodysian age, we're supposed to receive. Notice according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are to see to receive a messenger that will take all the loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapturing of the church. And this is why I say that Paul didn't have all the understanding because brother Bram's going to say something here in just a minute that helps me conclude that statement that and he goes in to say and said there is coming forth seven mysteries thunders that's not even written at all. That's right. And I believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith. So in Paul's day, the seven thunders, the seven mysteries, the sealed book was not revealed. &gt;&gt; Remember when Adam fell, the book went back to the hands of the original owner. &gt;&gt; So it was yet to be revealed. But it would take the lamb in the book of Revelations, Revelations 5, that would take the book, reveal the book, and then the book becomes a new book. Then the mystery of God, the revelation of God has been made known. So that's what I'm trying to share with you this morning. And brother Bam says, "But see there's loose ends left that can't be explained. See, the seals hasn't been broke." So wonder why all the loose sins were in the previous ages. Cuz the seals were yet to be broke. But after the seals broke, it became a new book. &gt;&gt; No longer were there loose sins, but God sent a vindicated voice, a vindicated prophet, and he tied those loose ends together to make known to finish the mystery of God. to make known to us to know where you're standing. &gt;&gt; So you can't be buffeted. You can't be knocked off of it. You know that. You know that. You know that this message is truth &gt;&gt; and who you are. Not just to know that the message is true. It's one thing to know the message is true and doubt your position in it &gt;&gt; or doubt your position in the economy of God. But we're going to find God is bringing it all together through the seventh angel. He says, 'Now, what a time we're living in. This great mystery of God being finished, bringing into God has showing what it is. How these little isms went off and made them this and somebody made them that, and somebody made them this, but the angel of the Lord come down and brought up all their isms and poured out the truth of it and presented it. So God through an angel visitation through a prophet, he would come and take all these loose ends, all their little isms, and he would pull the truth out of all their little isms and bring the revelation that's been hidden before the foundation of the world. For what? To get a bride ready to get a church ready for the rapture. &gt;&gt; We're not taking a rapture unless all the mystery of God is finished. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh my. Well, let's look at some of these mysteries. Is that okay? This morning, that clock is yet to move. So, I got all the time in the world. I'm just waiting on it. It ain't moved a dime. But let's look at some of the mysteries. And brother B will say this is a sign of the end, sir. You can go back and listen to it. 1962. A mystery is scripture is previously hidden truth now divinely revealed. So, this seventh angel, he's going to do, he's going to finish the mystery of God. And here are some of the mysteries. Number one, the mystery of the kingdom of heaven. Two, the mystery of Israel's blindness during this age. Romans 11:25. Three, the mystery of the translation of the living saints at the end of the age. 1 Corinthians 15 and Thessalonians 4. Fourth, the mystery of the New Testament church as a one body composed of both Jews and Gentiles. Fifth, the mystery of the church as the brother of Christ. Six, the mystery of the living Christ, same yesterday, today, and forever. Then he goes to Galatians 2:20 and Hebrews 13:8. And the seventh is the mystery of God, even Christ as the incarnate fullness of the Godhead embodied in whom all divine wisdom and godliness is restored to man. Notice the ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity. Then we have the mystery of the seven stars in Revelations 1 and verse 20. Seven stars of the seven churches and the seven messengers and so forth. the 11th, the mystery of Babylon, the prostitute. See, these are just some of the mysteries. Then we got the serpent seed. That's been a hidden mystery all through the years. And grace, notice the mystery of grace. He said, straightened out, not disgrace, but real true grace. &gt;&gt; Then no such thing as eternal hell or burning hell. Notice the mystery of hell. You'll burn for millions of years, but anything that was eternal had no beginning or no end. and hell was created. Then we got the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation, but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did. Then in the last, the mystery of water baptism, not in father, son, holy spirit, but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, not in titles, but in the name. &gt;&gt; So this seventh angel will begin to reveal, tie all these loose ends up into one glorious message. And he would tell us in the message adoption number four he says remember it cannot talking about a mystery it cannot be taught in a seminary &gt;&gt; it's a mystery it's hidden but it's divinely revealed you cannot know it by education by theology it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God then he goes on into the the the the church age And he's talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ. And he says, "You'll recall that I mentioned at the beginning of the message that this book that we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself to the church and his works in future ages." Now, he's speaking on the church ages. Then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we failed to get it. &gt;&gt; So, you can't just read and read and read and read. I don't care if you got a 160 IQ. That's not going to give you revelation. That's going to give you intellectual understanding. &gt;&gt; But he says, now I mentioned to you, it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we fail to get it. Bringing these two thoughts together, you'll see that it won't take just an ordinary study and thinking to make the book real. It's going to take, notice the operation of the Holy Ghost. That means that this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people. Oh my. Don't let that gloss over your head, church. &gt;&gt; A special class of people. Well, I thought I was just this. I thought I was this that. No, you're a special class of people. &gt;&gt; Predestinated from the foundation of the world to receive this great revelation and unfolding of the mystery. You're not here by mistake. You're not here by happen. God predestinated you to be here this morning in this service to hear the word being preached to receive the message of the hour. That's why you're here so he can unfold to you little bride the mystery of his will his purpose &gt;&gt; for coming. Let me keep going. Now this book means that it can only be revealed to a special class of people. &gt;&gt; Man, you may be poor as dirt, but you're special. You know, there that's we're going to have that. There's going to be wealthy people, unwealthy people, fat people, skinny people, ugly people, pretty people, short people, tall people. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; You're a special class of people. &gt;&gt; You're not just anybody. It will take, notice, and he goes on, it will take one with a prophetic insight. Oh, here's where we're bringing a prophet in. It's going to take one with a prophetic insight. It require the ability to hear from God. It will require supernatural instruction. Not just a student comparing verse with verse, though that's good. But a mystery requires a teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear. how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know. So the revelation of the mystery of God and his will can only come notice it will only come to a special class of people. Do you look around men Louisiana 14 13 14,000 people you got Spring Hill down the road here and we got other places down the road but you look here we have maybe 200 250 among 13,000 people 14 maybe our secondary and primary service areas if we call that that's a hospital term maybe 20 25,000 people but there's 200 sitting here &gt;&gt; special class of people &gt;&gt; recognize who you are church You're special in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; There may be days you don't feel special, but nevertheless, you're special in the eyes of God. So that's why God had to send a prophet, a vindicated prophet. He had to reveal the mystery of God, the things that were hidden, the mystery of his will, his purpose, or it would never become clear. &gt;&gt; See, man can't bring clarity to the mystery of God's will. How many of you know how many denominations there are in the world today? There's 47,000 different denom Christian denominations in the world today. All claiming to bring clarity to the mystery of God's will. &gt;&gt; See, man can't do it. Denominations can't do it. It's going to take one with a prophetic insight to come and to reveal the mystery to that special class of people that predestinated that were ordained to receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it shows you who you are &gt;&gt; regardless of your family, regardless of your mistakes, regardless of your past. That has no bearing on your future. &gt;&gt; We look here in 1 Corinthians 2 and verse six. Oh, let's go actually go to verse 7. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes of the world knew. For they had known, they would have not have crucified our Lord of glory. But as it is written, I have not seen, nor is he or heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. Thank God &gt;&gt; he has revealed them unto us. Not Joe Adams, not Tim Puit, not the great teachers in the message. They didn't reveal this to you, but God has revealed it to us. For the spirit searches all things, yet the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of man, say the spirit of man which is in him, even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. For now we notice it says now now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. So not only does revelation come by one word of prophetic insight but it's going to come by the Holy Spirit bringing forth revelation to those predestinated to open your eyes so that you can see the mystery of God. The Holy Ghost gives revelation or we failed to receive it. Colossians 1 verse 26. Even the mystery, here's that word again. Even the mystery which has been hid from the ages and from generations. But now we think about it. Oh well, this is back when Paul was preaching. It's it's many many many many years ago. Don't put it many many many years ago. Remember that's the beginning of the revelation. We're at the finalization of the revelation, the the the the crescendo of it all right here. But he says, even the mystery which had been hidden from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. Notice the the words that he uses here. the riches of his glory of this mystery, this hidden secret that was once in but now being made manifest among the Gentiles which is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Not Christ in your neighbor, not Christ in the preacher, not Christ in the deacon, not Christ in the song leaders and all that, but it's Christ in you this morning. That's the hope of glory. That's the riches of this mystery that is no longer on great men, though we are so thankful for great preachers that can get theirselves out of the way. But it's for even you this morning, God making known the mystery of his will. That is no longer me a sinner, no longer me born in sin, shaped in iniquity, but me being a tabernacle of the Holy Ghost this morning that he came down and he accepted me and reconciled me back to his will. God bringing me back in favor with the word. &gt;&gt; Paul begins to teach the Gentiles that the mystery of God that they were included &gt;&gt; in the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Man, they were sinners. They were &gt;&gt; outcast. But I want you to know Paul never uses the term gentile bride. All right? He uses the term church and he's speaking to the Gentiles and he's talking about church, Jew and Gentile being reconciled to God. See, that was Paul's revelation. Great revelation like we're included. &gt;&gt; But that's not all of it. Now, where once used to be Jew, Jew, Jew, now the mystery that we have in this hour, it's Christ in us. The anointing in us, not Christ in the four walls of this building, not Christ in the school of prophets, preachers, deacons, not Christ in your denomination, but Christ in you. No matter your background, no matter your location, no matter the state that you had to come from, &gt;&gt; Christ in you the hope of glory. And brother Brown makes a statement out in Christ mystery. He says, "When this revelation, this great revelation, revealed mystery is made known to you, then you denounce all the things of the world." &gt;&gt; See, when you see God in this message, you can't see anything else. When the truth of this message has been revealed to you, when I say the message, now remember the message is Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to associate and think when I say message only William Brandom. He was the voice that brought the message but the message is Christ. &gt;&gt; So when you see Christ, you see the truth of this message and it's been revealed to you not by man but by the Holy Spirit. You can't go back to systems of man. You can't go back to sin and the beggarly elements that you come out of. You can't go back to the bottle, back to the drugs. You can't go back to all these other things. You can't go back to the things that you used to find comfort in because now he is your comfort. &gt;&gt; He is your peace. &gt;&gt; Once you receive this revelation of not only who God is, but who you are. &gt;&gt; You can't wait for the church doors to open. &gt;&gt; I know that's stinging some people right now. I'm sorry. Your prophet said it, not me. You can't wait for the doors to open to be in his presence &gt;&gt; to hear the unfolding of the revelation of God. &gt;&gt; See, he's everything that you desire. &gt;&gt; He's everything that you think about. You wake up talking to him, you go to bed talking to him. &gt;&gt; He consumes you in your thinking. Why? Because you denounce all the things of the world. So, brother Brandon would take Colossians 1 verse 15- 29 and he would begin to preach Christ the mystery of God revealed. He only preached it once and he preached it shortly after the opening of the seven seals. And he's picking up on Paul's inspiration and preaching not only the mystery of godliness, who God was and how God was eternal spirit come down in man, but now he's looking beyond that and how notice not only just Jesus coming in tabernacle or God tabernacle Jesus, but now he's here preaching the mystery of the bride. See, Paul didn't use the terminology gentile bride. But the seventh angel begins to use that terminology over and over. God calling out of a leg, calling a bride out of a church. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Say, I no longer call you church. I call you bride. &gt;&gt; That's a revelation of a mystery. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thought it was all Gentiles. When those that will receive Christ come on in, it's great. You know, that's the gentile church. But here in the seventh angel, when he begins to sound his message, there's a calling out of a bride out of the church systems, out of the man-made creeds and dogmas. Why? because she's staying true to the word because revelation has become known to her and the mystery of God's will is being unfolded. &gt;&gt; So we look here, he begins to preach and he would say God emptied himself. All that God was, he poured it into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured it or empty keynoted himself into the church. &gt;&gt; So pour is not spilling over and everything pours out. It's purposely done. So he purposely pours a drink. All of this he pours it into another vessel but the same contents just a different vessel. &gt;&gt; And all that God was eternal spirit great creator supernatural. He pours it into Christ. That's why blinded eyes could open. &gt;&gt; The lame could walk. The dead could come back. &gt;&gt; But oh church, it don't stop there. Because all that Christ was, he pours into a body. &gt;&gt; That's why in this day cancer's defeated. That's why in this day blind eyes can come open. That's why in this day supernatural can take place. Why? Because it's the same God pouring out himself of the same spirit. And we can have supernatural signs and wonders in this church. Not just somewhere else. Not just ages past, but God, he knows in this hour, church, emptied himself, poured himself out to make himself relevant &gt;&gt; in this hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That he is the same. &gt;&gt; Very much the same. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a great revelation God has given us. All that God was, he said he entered into Christ. All the great eternals of God was entered into Christ. and all that Christ was, he entered into the church. Woo! Come on, church. Recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; My He goes, I think the Greek word is kinosis, which means emptied himself out. Not in a way that we would think something of something inside of somebody emptied out, but he poured himself out. He just poured himself out. Now I'm training Levi at the hospital and I'm pouring myself out, giving him all my understanding through 20some years of working there. Pouring it all out. And that's what he's saying. He emptied, he poured all his great revelation out. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, he pours it into a bride. That's why revelation, church, is of the utmost importance. That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz no man can bring this revelation to you. Only God can do it. So the bride, how many of you bride this morning? &gt;&gt; The bride must see who she is. &gt;&gt; And you don't see it by intellectual understanding. You don't see it by reading verse by verse, comparing verse by verse. So she must see, little bride. You must see that you're just as much part as the promise that Jesus is. Same way Sarah had to see that she was included in the promise just as much as Abraham was. So when God gave the promise to Abraham, you know how Sarah was. She fussed and stewed and stomped. I'm not going to go any further than that. I live in a house of a lot of girls. There's a lot of stew and fuss and stomping going on at certain times of the month. But we find Sarah. 20 years go by. Nothing different. Nothing different. Nothing there. All she's heard about is this child, this child, this child. But when she finally caught the revelation, &gt;&gt; notice when she finally caught the revelation that it was going to come through her and not some Hagar. Then she judged God faithful. And that promised son who's been in waiting for 25 years, then he manifested himself. And I can tell you this morning, little bride, when you reveal, when God reveals to you who you are, and you judge him faithful today as much as he was yesterday, then you too will bring the promise of the spoken word in this hour. You will be the unfolding of the great mystery of God. &gt;&gt; You'll understand why you had to move here. &gt;&gt; You'll understand why you came to the message. You'll understand why you couldn't keep living that life. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Because revelation struck. He struck that predestinated seed. She judged and faithful. So, it's got Can I say this? We as the bride have to receive this revelation. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And it has to become personal. Young person has to be more than mama, grandparent, pastor, preacher, church. It has to become personal. I'm included in the promise. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm included in the promise. When God speaks of a bride, he's speaking of me. &gt;&gt; I know life may deal you a bad a bad hand every now and then, but just realize I'm a part of that bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. Notice that's why the message came by my way is to pull me out of the systems of man. Pull me out of the life of sin. The message was sent to turn my heart. &gt;&gt; Come on church, make it personal this morning. &gt;&gt; The message was sent to prepare me for a rapture so that I can meet my Lord and my Savior. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandon will tell us and that clock hadn't turned yet, so I don't know what time I started and we just going to keep preaching. &gt;&gt; All right. He says in Christ the mystery now God's great secret God's secret mystery that he had before the world began back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and going to achieve. Notice, not only was he trying, but he was going to achieve &gt;&gt; and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed &gt;&gt; because first there was no moon, no star, no atom, no molecule or anything. He was God, but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him. But notice in this age, in this hour, for the first time that we've ever heard recorded, God sent a vindicated prophet. And not only did he just stay with the scriptures, which he did, but this prophet was permitted to go into the back part of God's mind, &gt;&gt; permitted to go back where no man has ever gone before and bring those mystery truths to the forefront and begin to reveal to an end time elect, predestinated, chosen, gentile, bride exactly the purpose and the will of God. See, it's in this day under the seventh angel all the mysteries are going to be finished. And one of the greatest mysteries that God had in the back part of his mind was a gentile bride, a church, a bride out of a church. Now, so God's greatest desire, let me say it like this, God's greatest desire is his bride. God's predominant thought, prevailing predominant is his bride. That's his crowning achievement. He will take in complete service and preach on the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; The masterpiece being the bride. &gt;&gt; See, when Jessica and I were dating, liking each other, man, I thought, "Woo, I did good." She said, "I'd ride with you if you open that door, but you better watch out. I'll open all four doors, but when we started talking, my sister Rachel, I couldn't get my mind off of her. She was all I thought about." And that's what he's saying here. His prevailing thought is his bride. &gt;&gt; Everything he's it's been sitting. He dwelt alone into eternity. He wasn't God yet. And yet you was in the back part of God's mind. He was waiting, waiting, anticipating for this hour, for this moment, for this day, for a gentile bride to be manifest that he can share himself with. &gt;&gt; That's why God sent us a message. &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. Notice, but some would have us to believe, but his greatest desire was, "Oh, God sent a prophet. Oh, God sent a prophet." William Brand was a prophet of God for this hour. He's the Messiah sign. And I believe he's a prophet and I believe he's a Messiah sign for this day. But I don't believe it's all about him. &gt;&gt; And I got scripture and I got quotes to back it up. See, believing God sent a prophet. See, some of them teach that all you got to do is believe God sent a prophet and you're rapture ready. &gt;&gt; You going to be disappointed. &gt;&gt; You believe God sent a prophet and you got the Holy Ghost, you will be disappointed on that day &gt;&gt; because it's more than just believing God sent a prophet. You have to understand why did he come? Who was he sent to? What is he telling me? What is he revealing? So, brother B said in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love and him was father and him was son and it was to be a savior. Him was to be a healer. All these great attributes that we see already expressed. They were in God. And yet God wasn't even an object of worship at this time. So he created angels. But the angels could not give God exactly what he wanted. He wanted more than just to be worshiped. I'm a husband and I love my wife and she's never called me Lord. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; But I don't want to be worshiped in that aspect. I want to be loved &gt;&gt; because I love her. I love my children. I don't want them just to go through religious duty. This is what you do. No, I want to be loved. And God wants to be loved by his bride. Not just worshiped. &gt;&gt; He desires. He desires worship. But beyond that, he desires to be loved. &gt;&gt; Someone to love him and to praise him and to offer a sacrifice of praise. When everything's going wrong, everything's tossy turby in your life. You still offer a sacrifice of praise. Why? Because it comes from a heart of love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But brother B says God had a purpose and a hidden mystery. What is the message for then, brother Joe? Was it sense? So God can show the world that he can get one man in his hand and he can do supernatural things. He can do the first pull of the sign in the hand and the second pull and the discernment of the spirit. Was it just that or was it to prove that he can to the theologians and intellectuals of the day that he can take a seventh grade Kuckian and confound scholars? The message is much more &gt;&gt; than the first and second poll. Those were gifts that God used to catch the rainbow trout. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To get your attention &gt;&gt; so that he can unfold this great revelation to you. So the message is more than just God sending a prophet. God sent a message through a vindicated prophet to make known to us his bride the mystery or the purpose of his will. Otherwise that word purpose there or that word will there is intentions. He's got intentions to take somebody for a wife. &gt;&gt; So it was sent to call a bride out of a church and prepare a bride for a rapture to get her dressed in the word of God. &gt;&gt; So this message is our dress wear. &gt;&gt; And brother B will say it like this. I hope we can crown that he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress the bride in the clothes of the word and for his righteousness. That's the message of the last days, the even light. And the first is first find the church where they will believe the message. Hunt it. Notice hunt where the church is is that'll even let you come in. They won't close the door. It's in your face. And this is in 1963 after healing revival left and he begin to be rejected. And then when you do there, you'll find character now is she'll stand still long enough to tell her how the bride's got to be dressed. She's got to be clothed. Stand still. Notice then he goes into little Rebecca listening to every word her little heart beating and he was telling her and now you sweating it out where will I go and until I find character then when he find the character then he's got to make her stand still long enough to get ready to meet him. See get her ready stand still and listen to the message of him. Eleazar wasn't speaking of himself but he was speaking of the one he was sent from. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, her affection wasn't on Eleazar, but her affection, her heart began to beat the one that Eleazar was telling her about. But many of us had made everything about this message all about Eleazar. And it has nothing to do with Eleazar. We're not going to marry Eleazar. We're going to marry Isaac. We're going to marry Christ the word, not William Bren the prophet. &gt;&gt; And I don't mean that disrespectfully to a prophet. We need a prophet voice. It's the one that opens the revelation to us. But don't just get focused on that. &gt;&gt; Recognize who you are and who you're going to marry, church. &gt;&gt; We're marrying Christ the word. &gt;&gt; And it took a prophet. It took an eleaser &gt;&gt; to tell us all about it. &gt;&gt; And when they asked, "Will you go?" She didn't stumble. She didn't stutter. She said, "Yes, I'll go. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'll go. And that's what it's about, church. This message was sent to lift this end time bri out of Satan's Eden and to restore her back to her original position. See, brother said, God's great mystery of how it's a secret is kept a secret. Nobody know nothing about it. Even the angels didn't know about it. But he showed or revealed it in every type of the Bible. Therefore, the entire Bible is a revelation of God's mystery in Christ. The entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose that he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible. And he says and all the acts of all the other believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's great goal is. And now in the last day, he has revealed it and he shows it. What are you talking about, brother Yo? Moses and Zapor, Joseph and his gentile wife. Boaz Ruth the Moabitete. Salmon marry and Rahab the harlot. Hosea taking wife of whoredoms. Abraham and Sarah being turned back to bring forth the promised word. It's been typed all down through. But today it's no longer type. Today we are the manifestation. Somebody's going to be the full revelation of the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; So notice he said the fullness of God of the Godhead is made known. The secret mystery is now revealed and God is manifested. God and man become one. The anointed man Christ. What does Christ mean? The anointed one. In Colossians 1 verse 27, we find again we go back to this. To whom God will make known what is the riches of his glory of the mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. So the entire mystery that's in the back part of God's mind is you. &gt;&gt; You're the mystery. &gt;&gt; You're the mystery in your failures, in your weaknesses, in your shortcomings, in your disappointments, on your bad days, in your sicknesses. You are the mystery. You are the mystery. See, you're the mystery. How can a holy, righteous, sinless God dwell in fallen, sinful, decay in humanity? I don't understand it. And I can't explain it. All I can tell you is he's living in me. &gt;&gt; My desires have been changed. My nature's been changed. The things I used to do, I don't do no more. I don't have no desire to go back to the world. I have no desires to go back to the bars. Had no desires to go back to the drugs. Have no desires to go back to the drinking. Had no desires to go back to the that kind of lifestyle. Why? Because I have been changed. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, the Baptist church didn't do it. The Pentecostal church didn't do it. The Presbyterian church didn't do it for me. I jumped all around all those denominational churches. But it took one with a prophetic insight. &gt;&gt; That's right. and the unfolding of the mystery of his will to show me who I was in this message. Can we keep going? Says Moses had them partly. So the great mystery, let me go back. The great mystery is God tabernacle humanity. And you look at your neighbor, you're like, "Woo, that is a mystery." Some of you just look with a big big smile on your face. Don't look at your neighbor and do that. But God, I know there's some days you wake up like, "Ain't no way God's in there this morning." But he is. &gt;&gt; Thank God. But notice he said Moses had him partly. David had him. Oh my. But here he is manifested in the fullness deity himself standing on earth. God in the fullness to die for the sin of the people that he might bring his church a sanctified life. that he might have preeminence in the fullness in his church to manifest every promise in the last days that he promised for the last days. God came and manifested himself, the great eternal spirit that couldn't die as a spirit. So, he became man in order to redeem and restore fallen man. He became Christ in order to fulfill all those great attributes that he had. He had attributes to be a healer. There had to be somebody sick so that God could heal. And we see with sister Atlanta and different others here, there had to be somebody that would get that would get cancer. But God will show himself greater than the cancer. He come to know that he could be a deliverer. So there had to be somebody lost that needed deliverance. And he came to manifest that. Somebody to be a father or he had an attribute to be a father. There had to be sons and daughters of God in this hour that say, "Yes, that's who I am." &gt;&gt; He had attributes to be a groom and it had to be a bride. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, God didn't manifest himself in Jesus just to prove that he could become a man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's going to shock some people. &gt;&gt; He became Jesus because of you. That's why &gt;&gt; cuz all these thoughts on the back part, healer, deliverer, but all that, the greatest thought he had was a bride and she was going to be a human bride and he was going to heal that bride and deliver that bride and marry that bride. and that preeminence in that bride. So all this he became Jesus Christ eternal spirit became a man for you. &gt;&gt; Don't you ever short change yourself. Don't you ever quit on yourself. God became Jesus Christ for you. &gt;&gt; For you. For you. my and he's the greatest of all revelations. &gt;&gt; He came to heal you, deliver you, restore you, reveal himself to you. Not only reveal himself, but reveal who you positionally are. &gt;&gt; So he's not telling us, brother tell us, he's not sharing these secrets with the flurers. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; only to the predestinated. So if you got ears that can hear and you've heard, come on, church. &gt;&gt; Who are you this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh, this is beautiful. &gt;&gt; So what was Jesus manifested for? I know you was asking that question. He said to show God that he was God. Then he goes in to say and through that purpose he achieved the church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promise of the word of God in the last days. when he gets to preeminence preeminence in the church the position he place in the church Jesus said he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall you do also even more than this shall you do for I go unto the father that was his purpose so he sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in the last day revealed and then Christ the mystery he says he had a three-fold purpose of God one God wanted to reveal himself to a people. He couldn't do it as eternal spirit. So he had to take on the form of humanity and he came as his son Jesus Christ. Second he wanted to have preeminence in a body of believers that is his bride that he might live in a people. Third that he was going to restore Eden or bring back that which was lost the bride and the groom back to Eden again. Then it would say the anointed man but now the anointed people. &gt;&gt; So all that God was is in Christ again. And the reason why Christ came is because of you. And so all that Christ was, he empties it into us, you. So we look here in the deity of Jesus Christ. He's the creator of all things. He made He made life, frogs and bees and ducks and chickens and animals and created everything. Nothing was made that was not made by him. Who Christ the deity? He brought plagues and everything in the days of Egypt. Who Christ? He stopped the mouths of lions. He quenched the violence of fire. They escaped the edge of the sword. They raised the dead from the grave. Who Christ? Oh my. What will it be? Who is it? It's Christ the deity. And he said, "Brother and sister, that deity is in you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, we just think, "Ah, I just got to drag myself to church." No, you're deity this morning. &gt;&gt; He says, "No, Christ in you." Hallelujah. We're not worshiping Christ in a manger, but Christ in you, the Holy Ghost, the hope of life. Hallelujah. The creator, God himself, dwelling in the human being. God, Christ, the the hope of glory is in you, not in a cradle, in you. Then in the church age, he said, "Now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the world, the earth or the foundation of the earth, the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man." And then you go to Ephesians and we went there. It's where we started. He chose us in him before the foundation of the world. He predestinated us unto the adoption of children according to his good pleasure. He made us accepted and beloved and we have redemption through his blood and forgiveness of sins. Everything that God wanted to do, he wanted to do it with us. &gt;&gt; Let me go on a little bit further here. &gt;&gt; Can I go a few more minutes this morning? It's just now one o'clock. All right. That that thing up there is lying. But I'm gonna keep it honest today. He said the messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things. According to Malachi 4, he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. And he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10, which are the revelations contained in the seven seals. And it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; So it's the revelation unfolded that turns our heart back. So we see who we are. &gt;&gt; But he says he goes on into the church. He says the people in John's day mistook him for the Messiah. He says, "Now the last day prophet messenger will have such power before the Lord that there will be those who mistake him for the Lord Jesus. There will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this." &gt;&gt; And he goes on down a little further. He says, "But don't you believe that he's not Jesus Christ? He's not the son of God. He is one of the brethren, a prophet, a messenger, a servant of God. He needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that which John received when he was the voice that cried, I am not he, but he is coming after me. &gt;&gt; So I'm trying to show you this this thing that we call the message. It's not just about William Brand though he is a very intricate and intricral part of the unfolding of the mystery of God. Brother says, "You know what? He had a purpose in saving me." Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Brother Hell, he had a purpose of bringing you out of Mississippi. He had a purpose of bringing me out of Mississippi. One of probably the best things that ever come out of that state. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on, y'all. Say amen to that. &gt;&gt; We got to get it where we can, brother. Ain't a whole lot coming out of Mississippi. Good, bro. But notice, he's had a purpose in saving. He had a purpose in saving you. And I'm determined by his will to do his will. That's the reason he done it. I don't know. He says, I don't know why he done it. He goes, you know, there was millions in sin when I got saved. But he had a purpose in saving me. He goes, I'm an oddball amongst the brethren. Many times, believe in predestination, seed of the serpent, baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, all these other things, see things and visions and powers of Christ return back condemning organization and things. I'm an oddball. But he had a reason to save me, a purpose for doing it. He saved me when there was millions of others in sin. But he saved me for some reason. And can I tell you this morning, he saved you for some reason. &gt;&gt; He saved you for a purpose this morning. And he brought you here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; He said, "There were educated men, smart men. There were theologians. There were bishops and doctors and so forth in the field when he saved me. But he saved me for some reason." &gt;&gt; That's right. And God has got a purpose of you being here. &gt;&gt; See, you can only be get to the place how much he goes, if you can only be get to the place, how much trouble you would save God and yourself. &gt;&gt; And the whole church said, "Amen." We build bridges and cross them. My goodness. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Y'all know you a bunch of bridge builders this morning, &gt;&gt; man. You build, you make things happen that ain't even close to going to happen. &gt;&gt; We all do it, church. &gt;&gt; But God, nevertheless, he saved us for a purpose. God had a purpose in saving you because why? You were in the eternal thoughts of God before the foundation of the world. You was the one that God wanted to spend eternity with. You were the one that God wanted to share his love with. You was the one God wanted to reveal his mystery to. You were the one this morning. And God had to save you in order to fulfill the plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; God did it. And we find here in according to Revelations 5, the Bible tells no man was worthy to take the book or even look at the book. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God, &gt;&gt; but God came a man became the lamb. John looked for the lion of the tribe of Judah and he saw a lamb that had been slain. And that lamb took the book from out of the hand of the one that was on the throne. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. The book, the title deed of redemption, brother say it's the book of redemption. All those that would be redeemed, everything laid in that seal book. But when that lamb took the book, he handed it down to John in Revelation 7. And John is a type of the bride. And now little bride, it ain't in the hands of the angel anymore. It's not in the hand of the original owner anymore. Now the book is in our hands. Now it's in our belly. Now we must prophesy again. We must manifest the vision that pertains to the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He said it's a forfeited title deed is in the hands of the original owner, Almighty God. The title deed to the earth to eternal life. When Adam forfeited it and Satan's dirty hands couldn't take it, but it went back to the original owner, God himself. And he sits on the throne with it in his hand. The title D. That makes me feel religious. The title deed to eternal life. Abstract title D. Eternal life. When Adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith and went back to the hands of the original almighty God, waiting for what? Redemptive claims. God is claiming. God is claiming. This book of redemption is a title deed. What's an abstract to a title? Means it's been searched all the way back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like a drop of ink into bleach. You can't find a trace of it. &gt;&gt; Some of you should say, "Amen." Hallelujah. Cuz you know what you've done. You know the life that you live. But when that confessed sin is dropped into the blood of Jesus Christ, it goes all the way back. Hallelujah. Falls on the head of the accuser. And now we're sinless. Come on, little bride. You may have walked in sin. You may have done things that you wasn't proud of. Oh, but once that confessed sin has dropped into the bleach of the blood, there ain't no more sin. There is no condemnation to them that the mystery is being made known to. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful word we have. What a beautiful message we have. What a beautiful people we are. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I feel religious &gt;&gt; cuz I know where I've been. I know what I've done. But I know where I'm going this morning because God the great creator had poured himself out. It's more than just a message. It's my life. &gt;&gt; He's everything to me this morning. &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. &gt;&gt; I don't know why I keep looking back there. Everything ain't changed. Mercy. I'm sorry. Either I'm dumb or dumber. Notice he said the the law required a kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And no man was found worthy. Wasn't worthy to take the book. But it also says in Revelations 5, wasn't even worthy to look at the book. Could you just imagine this scene for a minute? No human was worthy even to place eyes on the book. Not the contents of the book. the book &gt;&gt; and the law required a kinsman redeemer and brother says grace met the requirement &gt;&gt; in the person of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and the virgin birth produced our kinsman redeemer so what was the purpose what was the purpose of the birth to say that Jesus could be born that God become a man it's more than just God becoming a And it's more than this this message coming in William Bran. &gt;&gt; See, God condensed, became a man who was without sin, became sin that he could fulfill the thoughts that were in the back part of his mind, the hidden mystery, make himself known to have preeminence in a body so he can get her ready. Get her rapture ready by unfolding the mystery. His purpose. his purpose of calling you out. &gt;&gt; And if he's called you out, he's taking you in. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now God's law required a kinsman redeemer. The lamb come out hollering, I am their kinsman. I am their redeemer. I have made intercession for them. And now I've come to claim their rights for them. There's the only one. I've come to claim their rights in that they have a right to everything that Adam and Eve lost. I paid the price. So to claim it back for humans and brother man says now the seals were broke. Why? In the last church age to reveal these truths. The lamb broke the seals and revealed them to this church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride. See oh my he wants to bring his subjects to him. bow. Oh church, then we go into he says, "Now in the Christian age, there was one God which appeared in the form of the pillar of fire to a prophet called Paul who was set to sent to the Gentiles to take a people out for his name's sake." And this phrase here, his name's sake, means there's going to be a one that carries on his name. &gt;&gt; She takes on his name. Now, Jessica, when we got married 23 years ago, she took on my name. She's not Miss Joe or Miss Joseph, she took on my name, my last name. She's Miss Adams. And that's what we find here is he's called out a people &gt;&gt; that would be Miss Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. Not Miss Baptist, not Miss Pentecost, not Miss whatever 47,000 different denominations, not miss message, &gt;&gt; but miss Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And he said he died for the purpose to resurrect his bride, the body. Oh. And he says now, and I'm bringing this down to a close, musicians, make your way back. We're about to parachute out of here. He says, "Now, come on, musicians." Mercy. I'm calling. Everybody's like, "Would y'all heard him get up there? Few more minutes, but y'all just play something softly, please." Thank you for being great, great listeners this morning, wonderful participants. But he says now this is in Christ mission. Now the life in the body is the vindication that the rapture is at hand. A few services back I preached on you predestinated unto quickening power and you hath he quickened. Quicken means to made alive and now we find life in the body is a vindication that the rapture is hand. When you see the headship and the body becoming one, the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about ready to receive the headship. He begin to give life unto the body. The one that he's redeemed, a meteor mediatorial work is done. He's bringing his life to the body in a vindication for the rapture. Then he goes on to say, "Oh church, Christ the true headship is coming in his bride, doing the same works that he did at the beginning, making ready the fulfilling of his word as he did at the first." In John 14:12, he said, "The head and the body are becoming one in the works and in signs and in life, vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last days." He promised this to the last days. Oh, he says, "Notice, if you can see that the marriage supper is at hand." &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. Just a few more settings of the sun. &gt;&gt; Just a few more. We're going to step out of this pest house of humanity. &gt;&gt; And we're going to step into a new body. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God be to reveal to us we're not part of the world. &gt;&gt; We never were part of the chicken yard. We may have pecked around and done things we shouldn't, but all the time we always was an eagle. We always were sons of God. We always was daughters of God. We always were the bride of Jesus Christ. Always were and always will be. Church, he said the head and the body are becoming one. the head, Christ, and the body of the bride. No longer twain. She's not doing her own thing. No, she's subject to the head. The head and the body are becoming one in works and signs in life, vindicated by God himself through the promised word. See, the marriage supper is at hand. If you can see again, remember the marriage supper is at hand. Then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in the great millennium taken up of the church and destroying of the wicked the world under the sixth seal to be purified by volcanic to take on the corruption the sin of the world and to mold her out again and bring forth the bright new millennium for the age that has come now. And he goes on the great three-fold manifestation of revelation God in Christ Christ in the church in the kingdom coming. He goes, "I'm talking about the headship in Christ being personally identified by the original headship." We have the answer, church. There's been a lot of questions you may not have had the answer for. There have been a lot of things you may have, you know, the devil may have stumped you on, but we have the answer, according to a prophet, to the devil's question. He said, "The headship is here. Christ the word is here again in this hour." We have the answer to the devil's question. We have the answer this morning. Christ is risen and paid the price and raising up the body. And the devil can't stand. I said, "Oh, glory to God this morning. I don't care what he can't stand. I'm going in the rapture. The headship of the word is coming this day. And I am the body. I have received revelation. I have received understanding. I know the mystery of his will. The headship has come. The devil, the reason that he's howing the way that he is, his wickedness, his scheme has been uncovered by reason. A resurrected Christ and the headship in his body. We got the devil's answer. Not me that liveth, but Christ, the word living in me. Not my idea, his power. Not my idea, his word. He promised it. Here it is. He said it would be here. We got the answer, brother Creed. We got the answer this morning. No more doubts. No more frustrations. No more highs and lows, disappointments. We have an answer cuz we have a word. Cuz God sent us a prophet with the vindicated message. The headship has come to the body. God and his church is one. Christ in you. And he says, "God's great revelation." God's great revelation, headship to a body. Oh my. He says, "We stand justified before him because he cannot pass judgment for he's already judged the body, which I'm part of." And he goes, "Justified in the sight. We're justified. We are the victory. The church is the victory. We come forth in the last days with the glorious gospel showing his victory. He died for this purpose. And we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church. The vindicated word in the body is the very victory and the reason of his death. Christ the word. He was the word. He is the word and the church becomes the word by making her part of him. whole church and there's been churches churches and there's been brides brides down through seven ages. Now we're in the seventh final age. There's been churches. There's been those that claimed they were the bride. But there has to come one. There has to come one. And it can only come after the opening of those seven seals for the fullness, for the finality, for the finishing of the mystery of God's will. There has to come one. Then he goes and he says, "Oh, he being the groom, the bride has to come forth because it's part of him." It can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations that others spoke of the bride. It can only manifest if it does something different from the groom. is not the bride because she's flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. She is him. And he says, "And how the bride holds to that promise." As I end with this scripture, 1 John 3:1, "Behold, what manner, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore, the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. But, beloved, now, if you don't get anything out of this service today, I want you to know now. Now, the bride is coming to manifestation. Now, listen to what he says. Now, we are the sons of God. And it does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And he has appeared in the word and we are like him. We are bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, power of his power, life of his life. We are him. He says, if you only know positionally who you was and what you are tonight, there wouldn't be a feeble person in the next five minutes. That's right. The thing of it is you're looking off in the millennium for something to happen when it's already here. Now, we are the sons of God. Not will be. We are now. He says, "Right now, right now, this minute, we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Oh, if you'd only recognize that the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer. The devil's just trying to scare you out of something. He's trying to put something off somewhere that says that the days of miracles have passed. But you are now. We are sons of God now. We're seated in heavenly places now. Now we have all powers in heaven and earth right now, church. Now the purpose of the revelation of the mystery has been unfolded. Now it's not all about a prophet. Now it's about a bride who through a prophet ministry would unite her to the headship. He that this great mystery of God last quote made known understands how that God was in Christ reconciling returning to favor himself to the world. How that he and the father are one. how that the great mysteries of the fulfilling of God taken and bringing himself manifested in the age of human beings and in the strain of human beings and in the company of human beings to make his word manifest in that day in the eastern rising of the sun to do the same thing as a sun sets in the west to make himself manifested in a bride church the word made manifest. He that understandeth, that is to know, that has been revealed to him, of him that has sent me, has everlasting life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed from death unto life. You are the very mystery of God. Hidden, hidden down through seven church ages, hidden in the back part of God's mind, but now being made known. Now, that's why this message came. What a revelation we have this morning being the predestinated. What a revelation we have knowing that we come from the very back part of God's mind. His thoughts and his greatest desire is you. In one place, brother Bam says, you are the very heart purpose of God. God's heartbeat is his pride. What a blessed people we are. If you just let's just sing that song, Brother Derek. See, you're not only bride, but you're the Gentile bride. And it may appear that maybe you just you're just here. You just drifting through life. But see, there's more to you than just drifting through Leoa, drifting through life. See, the only one that can fulfill the purpose of God is his little gentile bride. We are the sons of God. God didn't make you just to struggle. He didn't make you just to barely get by. But he made you a wordborn bride. You were made to be free. You were made to rule and to reign and to live eternally.
