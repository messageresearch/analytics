[41:10] verse 13 through verse 17 we find God
[41:13] testifying of his son so we're going to
[41:16] look at this tonight it says then cometh
[41:18] Jesus From Galilee to to Jordan unto
[41:21] John to be baptized of him but John
[41:23] forbade him saying I have need to be
[41:25] bapt TI of thee comest thou to me and
[41:28] Jesus answering said unto him suffer it
[41:30] to be so now for for thus it becometh us
[41:34] to fulfill all righteousness then he
[41:36] suffered him and Jesus when he was
[41:38] baptized went straight way out of the
[41:40] water and loow the heavens were open
[41:42] unto him and he saw the spirit of God
[41:45] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[41:47] him and lo a voice from Heaven saying
[41:49] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[41:53] pleased God bless you you can have your
[41:55] seats tonight also want you to look over
[41:57] Matthew
[41:59] 4 this is immediately immediately
[42:02] following the baptism we find here in
[42:04] Matthew 4 then was Jesus let up of the
[42:07] spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted
[42:09] of the devil and when he had fasted 40
[42:12] days and 40 nights he was afterward a
[42:14] hunger and when the tempter came to him
[42:17] he said if thou be the Son of
[42:20] God if thou be the Son of God command
[42:23] these stones to be made bread but he
[42:25] answered and he said it is written man
[42:27] shall not live by bread alone but by
[42:29] every word that proceedeth out of the
[42:31] mouth of God but that wasn't enough the
[42:34] devil came again he said then the devil
[42:35] takeen them into a holy city and he
[42:37] seted them on a pinnacle of the temple
[42:40] and he saith unto him if thou be the Son
[42:42] of God cast thyself down for it is
[42:45] written he shall give his angels charge
[42:47] concerning thee and in their hands shall
[42:50] bear thee up lest at any time thou shal
[42:52] Dash thy foot against the stone so we
[42:54] find here and I want to speak to you
[42:56] tonight if I could for just a little bit
[42:59] we have the answer sir how many of you
[43:02] have ever been questioned and you didn't
[43:04] have the answer makes you real feel real
[43:07] insecure doesn't it you feel really
[43:09] intimidated when somebody asked you a
[43:11] question that you should know but you
[43:13] don't have the answer but you know it's
[43:16] a different story when you have the
[43:18] answer it's a different story when
[43:20] somebody asked you a question or there's
[43:22] a problem that is presented to you and
[43:24] yet you have the answer you don't have
[43:26] to shy away in unbelief you don't have
[43:28] to shy away in fear you don't have to
[43:30] shy away in intimidation because why
[43:33] because you have the answer so it gives
[43:35] a sense of Pride it gives a sense of
[43:37] security it gives a sense of ownership
[43:39] when you have the answer and I want you
[43:41] to know tonight as we go into 2024 we as
[43:45] the bride of Christ we have the answer
[43:48] we have the answer to the sin question
[43:50] we had the answer to sickness we had the
[43:52] answer to cancer we had the answer to
[43:54] Broken homes we had the answer they sons
[43:56] and daughters of God going out in the
[43:58] world we have the answer tonight that's
[44:01] right we have the answer we don't have
[44:04] to to knock down with the devil God has
[44:06] given us the answer
[44:09] tonight so notice what we find here
[44:13] Satan Jesus wasn't tempted by some
[44:16] spirit of fear or some Spirit of
[44:18] depression or some other kind of little
[44:21] minion of the devil he was tempted by
[44:23] the Devil Himself cuz he find that in
[44:26] the scriptures there's prophecies
[44:28] concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus
[44:30] Genesis 3 and ver1 15 says I'll put imy
[44:33] between thy seed and the woman between
[44:36] uh and it shall bruise thy head and it
[44:39] shall bruise his heel and then we find
[44:41] in Isaiah 14 therefore the Lord himself
[44:44] shall give you a sign Behold a virgin
[44:47] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[44:50] call his name Emanuel let's look at a
[44:52] few more Isaiah 9 and verse 6 For unto
[44:54] us a child is born unto us a son is
[44:57] given the government shall be upon his
[44:59] shoulders his name Shall be Called
[45:01] wonderful isn't he Wonderful Tonight
[45:03] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[45:06] father and he's still the Prince of
[45:08] Peace oh yeah we find here in Micah 5
[45:11] and verse two but thou Bethlehem EP
[45:14] though thou be little among the the
[45:16] thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall
[45:19] he come forth unto me that is to be the
[45:21] ruler in Israel whose goings forth had
[45:24] been from the old from Everlasting
[45:26] Hosea 11 and verse1 that he called my
[45:29] son out of Egypt and we're all familiar
[45:31] with Isaiah 53 who had believe our
[45:34] report and who to whom of the arm of the
[45:36] Lord is revealed he shall grow up before
[45:38] him as a tender plant and as a root out
[45:41] of a dry ground he is no form of
[45:43] comeliness and when we shall see him
[45:45] there is no beauty that we should desire
[45:47] him and yet he was despised and rejected
[45:50] a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief
[45:53] verse four and he had borne our grief
[45:56] and he carried our sorrows and yet we
[45:58] did esteem him strick and spitten of God
[46:01] and he was wounded for our
[46:03] transgressions he was bruised for our
[46:05] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[46:07] peace was laid upon him and with his
[46:10] stripes we are
[46:13] healed the Bible says he was oppressed
[46:15] and yet he opened not his mouth all
[46:19] these scriptures
[46:21] foretelling of Jesus's coming and yet
[46:24] when he came
[46:26] Satan doubted And yet when he came to
[46:29] his own his own believed him not they
[46:32] doubted and brother Bon will tell us he
[46:35] says now Satan always comes with
[46:39] if and if he came with Jesus with the if
[46:42] question he comes to you in this hour
[46:44] with the if question he said he always
[46:47] comes with if that question mark always
[46:50] across the word if thou be the Son of
[46:53] God command these stones to be made
[46:56] bread and notice Jesus he said Jesus
[46:59] never said I am the Son of God I rebuke
[47:01] the Satan he said it is
[47:03] written he said is it the father's word
[47:06] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[47:09] every word that proceeds out of the
[47:11] mouth of God he says now in another
[47:14] place earnestly contending for the faith
[47:16] he says always Satan putting a question
[47:18] mark across the word of God if thou be
[47:23] if you be a Healer let him heal this one
[47:25] if it be this let it be that it's always
[47:29] that's the question
[47:30] mark and notice he said if thou be the
[47:33] Son of God command these stones to be
[47:36] made of bread he had been fasting for 40
[47:39] days and 40 nights and yet he come to
[47:41] Jesus at his weak point and he said if
[47:44] you are that promised Messiah if you are
[47:47] the one that's been prophesied to come
[47:49] if you are that seed that I've been
[47:51] looking for All Through the Ages if
[47:53] you're that one then command these
[47:56] stones to me made of bread you're
[47:57] sitting there you claim to be God and
[48:00] yet you're hungry yet you're whed out
[48:02] God had left you here by yourself if
[48:04] your God command the stones to me Made
[48:07] bread otherwise perform a miracle and
[48:10] then I'll believe
[48:12] you notice Satan trying to excite him in
[48:16] his mind to distrust his care of God
[48:19] that God placed him God ordained him God
[48:22] positioned him God said this is my
[48:24] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased see
[48:28] that wasn't Jesus making that
[48:29] declaration that was God the Father
[48:32] declaring that Jesus is his son in whom
[48:36] he is well
[48:39] pleased and brother Bron would tell us
[48:41] like this I believe that Jesus is the
[48:44] son of God I believe that in his body he
[48:47] was a man he was born of a woman just
[48:49] like I was but his blood was not a woman
[48:53] it was God and Jehovah God the low God
[48:57] who brewed over the Earth and brw First
[48:59] Man Out of the Dust of the earth
[49:01] overshadowed Mary and brewed over her to
[49:03] fulfill his word and created the blood
[49:06] cell that brought forth the son of the
[49:08] Living God he says in the message of
[49:12] total Deliverance Jesus was completely
[49:14] totally
[49:16] man he could cry like a man he could eat
[49:19] like a man he could be tired like a man
[49:22] he was completely totally man in his
[49:26] physical being but in his Spirit he was
[49:29] completely totally God sir oh that
[49:32] should give you confidence tonight
[49:34] Church to realize that we're completely
[49:37] totally man we're completely totally
[49:41] Daughters of God but yet inside of this
[49:43] Humanity we're completely totally God
[49:47] because why God once again came to
[49:49] Tabernacle our Humanity deity is no
[49:52] longer in heaven but it's in you that's
[49:54] sitting here tonight almighty God had
[49:56] come down once again and he's making a
[49:59] declaration that we have the
[50:02] answer it's no longer you contending
[50:04] with the Devil with your mere flesh but
[50:07] almighty God has come down to give you
[50:09] Faith to overcome to give you life to
[50:12] live above
[50:14] sin notice now what he says you see he
[50:17] was tempted in all manners like we are
[50:20] he was a man not an angel he was a man
[50:23] he had desires and temptations like we
[50:25] do
[50:26] the Bible said it did he was a man not
[50:27] an angel above
[50:29] Temptation he was a man completely man
[50:34] that God took a complete man to bring
[50:36] total deliverance and he filled him with
[50:39] his Spirit the Holy Ghost was in him
[50:42] without
[50:43] measure and he was tempted like we were
[50:47] sometimes you feel when you're tempted
[50:49] you feel like you're all alone don't you
[50:51] but he had already been through that
[50:52] Temptation notice he was tempted like we
[50:55] were he was completely God he proved it
[50:59] when he raised the Dead when he stopped
[51:02] nature The Roaring Seas the mighty winds
[51:04] when he spoke to the trees and so forth
[51:06] and they obeyed him he was God
[51:10] inside oh brother sister we can look
[51:12] past the veil of our Humanity tonight
[51:14] you will see God inside once
[51:18] again otherwise what was this message
[51:21] for otherwise what's the purpose of
[51:23] having the Holy Ghost if it's not God
[51:26] inside he was God without measure we're
[51:29] god with
[51:31] measure notice we're men and women but
[51:33] we're also Christians and he's our
[51:36] example let us completely deliver our
[51:38] lives into the hands of the Holy Ghost
[51:40] that we might be subjects of the kingdom
[51:43] of God brother B goes on to say that he
[51:46] was totally man and he was totally
[51:50] God see but he surrendered his natural
[51:53] Parts his physical parts his own own
[51:55] thinking his own doing his own cares and
[51:58] he says I only do that which pleases the
[52:00] father and no wonder Satan would come in
[52:04] question if thou be if thou be the Son
[52:08] of God how can you be the Son of God
[52:11] when you're totally completely
[52:13] man and how can you be totally
[52:16] completely man and yet claim to be
[52:20] God see the
[52:24] question but see Satan knew that he
[52:26] caused man to fall in the beginning and
[52:29] Satan knew that from that point never
[52:32] have a man ever been able to overcome
[52:34] his vices ever to live a life free from
[52:37] sin every man had its own share of
[52:41] weaknesses he came and he was every man
[52:44] was
[52:45] guilty of
[52:48] sin therefore Satan questioned how can
[52:53] you be the son Son of God and notice
[52:57] he's been looking down Through the Ages
[52:59] looking for this one looking for that
[53:01] seed that was going to bruise his head
[53:04] cuz he had a purpose he was going to
[53:05] stop that seed from coming he was going
[53:07] to destroy that seed before that seed
[53:09] destroyed him but when that seed came
[53:12] and manifested he didn't recognize the
[53:15] seed nor does he recognize the seed
[53:19] today the Bible say he came to his own
[53:22] and his own received him not Scholars
[53:24] great Scholars Pharisees and Sadducees
[53:27] they long for Jesus to come they look
[53:29] for the coming Messiah they anticipated
[53:32] it and when he came they thought he
[53:34] would come with a full Angel salute they
[53:36] thought he was going to come and he was
[53:38] going to liberate them from Roman
[53:39] oppression he was going to come and he
[53:41] was going to set the temple in order he
[53:43] was going to be a Pharisee or a sadducee
[53:46] he was going to be a great intellectual
[53:48] teacher and he was going to set
[53:50] everything in order but when he came all
[53:54] right but when he came when he came he
[53:58] didn't come the way they thought he
[53:59] should come he came born in a manger he
[54:02] came in a stable he came in a a supposed
[54:05] illegitimate birth but when he came he
[54:08] still came the Son of
[54:11] God but he was
[54:14] unrecognized and he was questioned and
[54:17] brother Brown would tell us that when he
[54:19] when he came and he was 45 days being
[54:21] tempted Satan Satan HD him at his weak
[54:24] point and Satan loves to hit you at your
[54:26] weak
[54:27] point notice he comes but he said it is
[54:30] written took him to the top of the
[54:32] Pinnacle and set him up there if you be
[54:34] the Son of God cast thyself down and you
[54:37] know he give his father's word charging
[54:38] you and he said it is written it is
[54:40] written every place that he faced a
[54:45] question he answered with it is
[54:48] written now why would God need to be
[54:51] tempted because he was totally man
[54:54] that's right
[54:55] and as man he had to overcome so that
[54:58] when we got down to the last Age We got
[55:00] down to the last people there was no
[55:02] more another message coming no more
[55:04] another age promise and God got down to
[55:07] the finality of the finality there would
[55:09] be a people once again they're not
[55:11] relying on their flesh they're not
[55:13] relying on how much word they know but
[55:15] they're relying on one thing that it is
[55:17] written it is written is just as
[55:19] almighty God defeated Satan in his
[55:22] Humanity there would be a people again
[55:24] in the end
[55:25] they would defeat the same devil the
[55:27] same Temptations the same trials the
[55:30] same tempter with the same word and it
[55:32] were produce the same
[55:35] effect and he's still God tonight he's
[55:37] still overcoming tonight and he's still
[55:39] tabernacling our flesh
[55:42] tonight but B will tell us he says now
[55:45] when you get the Holy Ghost he said the
[55:48] first thing the Devil comes right along
[55:51] with
[55:52] Temptations when you get the Holy Ghost
[55:55] not playing about it when you get it and
[55:58] we're going to dig into that here a
[55:59] little bit tonight he says when you
[56:00] claim your healing he said you watch The
[56:03] Devil come right along to back her up
[56:05] and say it's wrong he says that's the
[56:07] time to
[56:09] stand that's the time to stand when you
[56:12] claim your healing because why you don't
[56:14] testify what you see or feel you testify
[56:18] of what you
[56:19] believe yes sir he said Jesus come along
[56:23] when he was baptized and straightway
[56:24] went to the water and a voice spoke out
[56:27] this is my beloved
[56:30] Son and I believe he's gotten down to
[56:32] the leot dean Church age and I believe
[56:34] once again he's looked down and he's
[56:36] claimed this is my beloved Son this is
[56:40] my beloved daughter this is my church
[56:43] this is my bride this is my people why
[56:47] because they're not Li relying on the
[56:49] words of a man they're not relying on
[56:51] denominations they're not relying on
[56:53] somebody else but they're ly on the word
[56:56] of God and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:58] that come down in this hour just like it
[57:01] did on the day of Pentecost it came down
[57:03] some may have spoke in tongues but one
[57:05] thing for sure they were changed when
[57:07] they walked out and that's the same
[57:09] power the same anointing the same
[57:11] effects of the Holy Ghost tonight some
[57:13] of you may speak in tongues some of you
[57:15] may speak may have a a vision some may
[57:18] whatever it may be but all of us if you
[57:20] receive the Holy Ghost it is no longer
[57:22] you and your Humanity but it's almighty
[57:24] God living himself out and he's changed
[57:27] your sin nature and now you have a
[57:29] desire for the things of God now you
[57:31] have a hunger for the word but if you're
[57:34] still hungering for video games and
[57:36] hungering for YouTube and Tick Tock and
[57:38] all this other stuff it declares that
[57:40] you ain't got what you expect to
[57:43] have I'm not saying it's wrong to look
[57:45] at that but when you're feeding on it
[57:47] non-stop something ain't
[57:49] right because the Holy Ghost come down
[57:52] and it changes your
[57:53] desires
[58:00] notice Satan had faced a lot of Great
[58:03] Men Through the Ages Noah was a
[58:06] righteous man but he was a
[58:10] drunk think about it Abraham was a great
[58:14] man but he
[58:16] lied
[58:18] Jacob seemed like everything fell in
[58:20] Jacob's lap because he was a Shyer a
[58:23] pathological deceased
[58:26] Eli he was an incapable
[58:30] Father David a man after God's Own Heart
[58:34] committed adultery and had a man
[58:38] murdered
[58:40] Moses Moses was a great man but Moses
[58:43] had a
[58:44] temper oh but what am I telling you why
[58:46] are you saying this brother Joe because
[58:47] I'm telling you that all these men had
[58:50] their share of weaknesses but when it
[58:52] came down to Jesus Oh and then when when
[58:55] when the enemy tempted Jesus he realized
[58:57] he was more than just a Noah he was more
[58:59] than just an Abraham he was more than
[59:02] just a Moses there was something
[59:03] different about this one and let me tell
[59:05] you when he comes against you in this
[59:07] hour oh I want the devil to know this
[59:09] ain't Moses that your messing with this
[59:11] ain't Noah that you're messing with this
[59:13] ain't Abraham that you're messing I'm a
[59:15] Son of God tonight I've been born of the
[59:17] spirit of God and Jesus Christ is on the
[59:20] inside I may not overcome you with my
[59:22] flesh but what's on the inside of me he
[59:24] greater and migher than you
[59:28] are he realized that it was more than
[59:33] Moses PA
[59:36] church he realized that Jesus was the
[59:42] answer that he was the answer to all the
[59:45] scriptures that prophesied of a messiah
[59:48] he was the answer that prophesied of
[59:51] your healing he was the answer to the
[59:54] scriptures that says by your his stripes
[59:57] we are
[1:00:00] healed
[1:00:02] notice but Satan
[1:00:05] doubted said this can't be the Son of
[1:00:08] God there's no way if he's the son of
[1:00:11] God then why would he allow this to
[1:00:14] happen well they took him there and they
[1:00:16] beat him and they whooped him and a man
[1:00:18] ripped his beard from his from his face
[1:00:21] and he said not a word and yet the devil
[1:00:24] doubted because why because he said how
[1:00:26] could this be God and he not crucify him
[1:00:30] how could this be God and he not bring
[1:00:32] some kind of punishment upon these men
[1:00:34] when they spit in his face and pull the
[1:00:36] be his beard from his
[1:00:38] face oh but church when death met
[1:00:43] Jesus death knew that he met something
[1:00:46] different brother Bama said I can hear
[1:00:49] it coming now you hear the bump bump
[1:00:50] bump along the Cobblestone Road and and
[1:00:53] and Satan's there doubting the entire
[1:00:55] time this can't be he he can't be
[1:00:57] nothing more than just a Prophet this
[1:00:59] ain't no way this is a Son of God if he
[1:01:01] was he wouldn't be allowing this and the
[1:01:03] be of death begin to buzz around and he
[1:01:05] begin to ask oh Satan you want me to
[1:01:07] sting him now he said yeah go down there
[1:01:09] I don't believe that's God I don't
[1:01:10] believe he's the son of God I don't
[1:01:12] believe he's the one that's been
[1:01:13] prophesied to come oh let me tell you
[1:01:15] when that be of death hook his Stinger
[1:01:17] to Jesus Christ he knew right there
[1:01:19] something was different he stung Noah
[1:01:21] and Noah went by the way of the grave
[1:01:22] and he could sting Abraham and Abraham
[1:01:24] went and he stung this one but when he
[1:01:26] stung Jesus Bo Hallelujah he lost his
[1:01:29] Stinger death lost his sting oh thou Son
[1:01:32] of God here he is again in the end time
[1:01:34] church that don't have no sting to us
[1:01:36] tonight we're more than a Mass for the
[1:01:38] enemy why because we got the same Lord
[1:01:41] Jesus oh when he anchored that sting of
[1:01:43] death inside him oh death knew its maker
[1:01:46] death knew that Jesus was the answer to
[1:01:49] every
[1:01:52] question oh he knew
[1:01:55] something was different and
[1:01:58] notice brother B would tell us he said
[1:02:01] that the Old Testament had their ages
[1:02:04] just like the New Testament Gentile has
[1:02:07] seven Church ages so did the Old
[1:02:09] Testament Believers had their ages and
[1:02:12] notice Jesus came at the end of the
[1:02:16] age he came as fulfillment of the Old
[1:02:19] Testament scriptures prophesying of a
[1:02:23] messiah and if that was the case brother
[1:02:26] B would tell us and it is the rising of
[1:02:28] the Sun the same word that spoke of a
[1:02:31] groom speaks of the Bride so what are
[1:02:34] you saying brother Joe I'm saying that
[1:02:36] God still replicates himself he's
[1:02:39] already said and we find here in John 1
[1:02:41] and verse2 but as many as received him
[1:02:45] to them gave he the power to become sons
[1:02:48] of God notice that's not your
[1:02:50] distinction that's not your declaration
[1:02:52] you don't make yourself son I can't make
[1:02:55] you a son but almighty God made you a
[1:02:58] son to them that believed him them that
[1:03:01] received him to them gave he the power
[1:03:03] to become sons of God and we find in 1
[1:03:06] John 3 and verse one behold what manner
[1:03:10] of love the father had bestowed upon
[1:03:14] us notice it's the father bestowing this
[1:03:18] title of
[1:03:22] son that we should be called that word
[1:03:24] called there means to Bear a name or a
[1:03:27] title to be called the sons of God
[1:03:29] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:03:31] because it knew him not beloved now we
[1:03:34] are the sons of God and it do not yet
[1:03:37] appear what we shall be but we know that
[1:03:39] when he shall appear we shall be just
[1:03:42] like him so Satan today comes and he
[1:03:46] questions your claim as a son and
[1:03:48] daughter of God that's right he
[1:03:51] questions The Authority for you to use
[1:03:53] the word of God God he questions the
[1:03:56] distinction that God put on you that
[1:03:58] this is my beloved
[1:04:00] Son notice the Bible tells us well
[1:04:03] brother Joe how do we become a Son of
[1:04:04] God we look in 1 Corinthians 12 and: 13
[1:04:07] the Bible says for by one Spirit are we
[1:04:10] baptized into one body whether we be jew
[1:04:13] or Gentiles whether be Bond or free we
[1:04:16] all have been made to drink in one
[1:04:19] spirit so Satan questions your
[1:04:22] experience you that's been born again
[1:04:24] again how many of you got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:25] tonight Hallelujah Satan questions you
[1:04:28] on a daily basis whether you got it or
[1:04:32] not but God already spoke a word
[1:04:35] concerning your coming Genesis we find
[1:04:37] in Genesis 1:26 let us make man in our
[1:04:39] image after our likeness we find in
[1:04:42] Genesis 2 and verse 7 the Lord God made
[1:04:43] man of the Dust of the ground and he
[1:04:45] breathed in his nostril the breath of
[1:04:47] life and Man became a living Soul we
[1:04:50] find in Ephesians 5 and verse 27 that he
[1:04:53] wants to present him s a glorious
[1:04:56] Church notice not having a spot or wrink
[1:04:59] or any such thing but that is should be
[1:05:01] holy without blemish 2 Corinthians 11:2
[1:05:04] for I am jealous over you with The Godly
[1:05:07] jealousy for I have exposed you to one
[1:05:09] husband that I may present you as a
[1:05:11] chaste virgin to Christ then we find in
[1:05:14] Revelations 22 and verse 17 and the
[1:05:17] spirit and the bride say come so there's
[1:05:21] a word concerning a bride there's a
[1:05:24] prophecy concerning a bride so if
[1:05:26] there's a prophecy concerning a bride
[1:05:28] then that bride must come
[1:05:30] forth but Satan is there doubting if
[1:05:33] thou
[1:05:34] be if thou be see everything that Christ
[1:05:39] was we
[1:05:42] are
[1:05:43] everything that he was we
[1:05:47] are he would tell us in John 15 and
[1:05:50] verse 5 I am the vine and you are the
[1:05:52] branches no notice he that abideth in me
[1:05:55] and I in him the same bringeth forth
[1:05:59] much fruit there's got to be fruit from
[1:06:02] our lives and I understand that we find
[1:06:05] people today ministers today they don't
[1:06:07] want the fruits of the Holy Spirit they
[1:06:09] don't they think it's all
[1:06:11] emotion but it's not all emotion it is
[1:06:14] fruit that's to come forth if you're
[1:06:16] feeding off or living off the natural
[1:06:19] Vine the genuine Vine and not some
[1:06:21] man-made Vine and we know we we've been
[1:06:24] through this over and over and over
[1:06:26] brother BR talked about the grafted in
[1:06:28] limbs they'll not bear oranges or the
[1:06:30] lemon will not bear or they'll bear
[1:06:32] lemons and and they'll bear graef fruit
[1:06:34] but that that Branch ever puts forth
[1:06:36] another Branch it's going to be like the
[1:06:38] original because it's going to be living
[1:06:40] off the the life of the vine and what am
[1:06:43] I telling you that today we're not
[1:06:45] grafted in Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:47] we're born in Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:50] we can't help but produce what's on the
[1:06:52] inside of us a sheep don't have to
[1:06:54] manufacture wool it's a sheep it
[1:06:57] produces wool and Sons and Daughters of
[1:06:59] God we don't have to manufacture signs
[1:07:02] we don't have to manufacture speaking in
[1:07:04] tongues that happens because we're sons
[1:07:06] of God because the almighty God's on the
[1:07:08] inside and his promise nine spiritual
[1:07:11] gifts should be in operation in every
[1:07:14] local
[1:07:15] assembly that's God's word that's
[1:07:17] through a
[1:07:19] prophet so we
[1:07:21] find brother B want tell us the true
[1:07:23] belie is drawing from the same
[1:07:27] Source drawing from the same Source but
[1:07:30] notice Galatians 4 and verse four we're
[1:07:32] going to kind of get into this and just
[1:07:34] for a little bit this evening when the
[1:07:36] fullness of time was come and brother
[1:07:38] Tim I'm borrowing some of this from our
[1:07:40] conversation that you've been sharing
[1:07:42] with the ministers so I'm goingon to go
[1:07:43] along those lines for a little bit
[1:07:45] tonight so I'm going to do a little
[1:07:46] plagiarism but you know what when you're
[1:07:48] a minister there's no plagiarism it's
[1:07:50] free territor it's like Wikipedia we
[1:07:52] just go add to and take away
[1:07:54] so I'm barring from brother Tim tonight
[1:07:56] so promise I won't do half a good a job
[1:07:59] as he does but that's all right just
[1:08:00] buckle up we're going to get there
[1:08:02] notice he says but when the fullness of
[1:08:04] time was come God sent forth his son
[1:08:07] made of a woman made under the law to
[1:08:09] redeem
[1:08:11] them to redeem them that were under the
[1:08:13] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:08:16] of
[1:08:17] sons because you are Sons God has sent
[1:08:20] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:08:22] hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou
[1:08:24] Art no more a servant some of you need
[1:08:26] to get that right there you're no more a
[1:08:29] servant some of you come in church with
[1:08:31] your head down that's servant mentality
[1:08:33] you're not a servant you're a son stick
[1:08:36] your head up pull your squ shoulders
[1:08:38] back and realize I'm a son I'm no longer
[1:08:40] a servant I'm not a servant to the devil
[1:08:42] you never belong to the devil you always
[1:08:45] belong to
[1:08:47] God he said redeem means to buy back
[1:08:50] it's to restore to the original owner
[1:08:53] God God by his death the shed Blood
[1:08:56] Bought back his
[1:08:59] own see he bought back the spoken word
[1:09:03] seed bride my sheep hear my voice the
[1:09:05] word and they follow me he says you
[1:09:08] always were a
[1:09:11] sheep always were a
[1:09:14] sheep he said you never were a pig or a
[1:09:17] dog turned into a sheep some of y'all
[1:09:20] should shout hallelujah and
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:24] you're not a dog you're not a pig you
[1:09:27] don't have to slop around in the things
[1:09:28] of the world you're a son and daughter
[1:09:30] of
[1:09:32] God no that he said that's impossible
[1:09:35] for he says you're not a you're never
[1:09:36] were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep
[1:09:38] that's impossible for every kind of Life
[1:09:41] produces the same kind there is there's
[1:09:44] no change in a species we were we were
[1:09:46] in the thoughts of God and then
[1:09:48] expressed in flesh then there had to
[1:09:51] come a day that we would hear the voice
[1:09:54] are the
[1:09:55] word see the thoughts of God that's
[1:09:57] where we were before the foundation of
[1:09:59] the world and through the ministry of
[1:10:01] Malaki 4 God is restoring a people back
[1:10:05] to those thoughts because he's turning
[1:10:07] the hearts and lives of those people
[1:10:09] back to the faith of the fathers so he
[1:10:11] sent us a message to Quicken the seed
[1:10:14] that laid on the inside to and we find
[1:10:17] but Satan he may have covered that seed
[1:10:20] up he may have put a lot of dirt on it a
[1:10:22] lot of a lot of ground on a lot of sin a
[1:10:24] lot of habits you may have a lot of
[1:10:26] scars but there'd come a day one day you
[1:10:29] would hear that voice you hear Mama
[1:10:31] Eagle scream out you wasn't made there
[1:10:33] for that chicken yard you don't look the
[1:10:35] same you don't act the same your
[1:10:37] feathers are not the same your speech is
[1:10:39] not to say all it took was one day to
[1:10:42] recognize I heard that eagle scream and
[1:10:44] you realize you wasn't an Earthbound
[1:10:46] chicken but you was a son and daughter
[1:10:48] of God you always was an eagle Church
[1:10:52] why because eagle life was on the inside
[1:10:55] not chicken
[1:11:00] life Eagle life we got an eagle
[1:11:06] message and it's worth flying into the
[1:11:08] heavenlies and get out of these
[1:11:09] Earthbound conditions we've been in
[1:11:12] notice brother Brown would tell us in
[1:11:13] the the church ages he said now comes
[1:11:16] our triumphal our triumphal Capstone on
[1:11:19] the baptism with the Holy Ghost now
[1:11:22] we're speaking about we have the answer
[1:11:25] I want you to realize tonight that that
[1:11:27] answer lays in none other than the Holy
[1:11:30] Ghost it's the holy you have to know
[1:11:32] tonight church that you have it I'm not
[1:11:35] talking about playing games I'm not
[1:11:37] talking about just being Sanctified and
[1:11:39] coming up to the borderline and and
[1:11:40] everything looks toart but yet you still
[1:11:42] got these desires on the inside I'm
[1:11:44] talking about you got to know be on the
[1:11:46] shadow of a doubt that your life has
[1:11:48] been been been been baptized with the
[1:11:50] Holy Ghost he said now comes a triumphal
[1:11:53] Capstone on the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:56] Ghost and because you are Sons God sent
[1:11:59] forth his Spirit into the son into your
[1:12:01] heart's crying Abby father notice
[1:12:04] wherefore thou are no more a servant
[1:12:07] when God fills you with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:09] you're no more servant that servant
[1:12:11] mentality is gone and now you operate as
[1:12:13] a son your name on the check is just as
[1:12:16] good as the father's name on the check
[1:12:17] it's time time some of you start writing
[1:12:19] out some
[1:12:20] checks some of you need healing some of
[1:12:23] you need deliver some of you need God to
[1:12:25] move financially I say write the
[1:12:27] checkout tonight he's still God he's
[1:12:29] still on the throne he's still moving
[1:12:31] he's still making a way write that check
[1:12:33] out
[1:12:35] tonight if thou be a Son of God you'd
[1:12:38] write it
[1:12:41] out notice Jesus he said Jesus Christ
[1:12:45] came forth died upon the cross and he
[1:12:49] accomplished
[1:12:50] Redemption restoring to the original
[1:12:53] owner by means of purchase or the paying
[1:12:55] of the price and thereby placed us as
[1:13:02] Sons as much as I love brother Tim he
[1:13:04] couldn't Place me in that
[1:13:06] position as much as you love your pastor
[1:13:08] he couldn't place you in that position
[1:13:10] as much as you love your favorite
[1:13:12] preacher is or even brother brandham he
[1:13:15] couldn't place you in that
[1:13:17] position your adoption is your placing
[1:13:21] and when you get the Holy Ghost that is
[1:13:23] God
[1:13:23] signifying I'm placing you as my son and
[1:13:28] now your name on the check is just as
[1:13:30] good as my name on the check write it
[1:13:35] out he says we were hell captive by the
[1:13:38] devil but we were Sons nonetheless and
[1:13:41] he says and hear this and because you
[1:13:43] are Sons God has sent forth the spirit
[1:13:47] of his son into your heart whereby you
[1:13:50] cry father father God sent forth notice
[1:13:54] he sent forth his Spirit he sent you a
[1:13:57] message to do what turned that heart I
[1:14:00] didn't know I was a Son of God living
[1:14:02] out in the world I didn't know I was a
[1:14:04] Son of God doing the things that I did
[1:14:06] but deep down inside God planted a seed
[1:14:09] there and one
[1:14:11] day and for many of you all it took was
[1:14:14] one day one day you heard from your papa
[1:14:17] you heard that that wasn't what you are
[1:14:19] you never were that but you always was a
[1:14:22] Oh I what about it silence one day you
[1:14:24] recognize you didn't have to continue
[1:14:26] living in that dark life no God came
[1:14:28] across your path in a youth meeting and
[1:14:30] what did God do God completely changed
[1:14:32] your nature changed your desires change
[1:14:34] who you are why because you are a son of
[1:14:38] God notice now because you always were a
[1:14:42] son God sent a message to you yeah he
[1:14:46] sent the Holy Ghost to place you to
[1:14:50] adopt you as a
[1:14:52] son and as adopted Sons we are to
[1:14:55] manifest the attributes of the father
[1:14:57] that's right our lives are declaring
[1:14:59] that he is here yes you understand what
[1:15:02] I'm saying your life the fruits that
[1:15:04] your life Bears should if you have the
[1:15:07] Holy Ghost not a gonna say should it
[1:15:09] will declare that he is
[1:15:12] here because what he is we are
[1:15:17] right brother B what tell us like this
[1:15:19] is now it's right to bring him back
[1:15:21] exactly like he was was at the beginning
[1:15:24] his same Ministry the same Jesus the
[1:15:27] Same power the same Holy Ghost the same
[1:15:30] one that come down on the day of
[1:15:32] Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's
[1:15:34] manifested today from Glory unto Glory
[1:15:38] unto glory and I ask you tonight if he's
[1:15:40] to manifest today where is he doing that
[1:15:43] the prophet is no longer on the
[1:15:45] scene but God is the Holy Ghost is he's
[1:15:50] still moving in lives he's still moving
[1:15:52] he's still coming out and baptizing
[1:15:55] people he's still the same holy ghost
[1:15:57] that fell at the day of Pentecost and
[1:15:59] he's still the Holy Ghost
[1:16:02] tonight oh
[1:16:04] Church see it's back in its original
[1:16:07] seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:09] with signs notice with the same
[1:16:13] signs today now they don't want the
[1:16:15] signs we're immature right we don't want
[1:16:17] signs we don't want wonders we got the
[1:16:18] word well let me tell you the
[1:16:20] distinction that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:16:21] is that signs and wonders will follow
[1:16:24] he says with the same signs the same
[1:16:26] wonders the same baptism the same kind
[1:16:29] of people acting the same way with the
[1:16:32] same
[1:16:33] power acting the same way it's been a
[1:16:37] long minute that some of you stumbled
[1:16:39] out of
[1:16:40] here but he said it would act the same
[1:16:43] with the same way the same power he said
[1:16:46] the same
[1:16:48] Sensations is from Glory unto Glory so
[1:16:51] what is the baptism of the Holy Holy
[1:16:53] Ghost brother Joe he said it is the
[1:16:54] spirit baptizing you into the body of
[1:16:58] Christ that's what the baptism is he
[1:17:01] said notice in another place the mark of
[1:17:03] the beast and I've been studying that
[1:17:04] message today I listened to it probably
[1:17:06] three times already today and two or
[1:17:08] three times earlier this week he says
[1:17:10] but if you've been Justified that's all
[1:17:12] good how many you been Justified man
[1:17:15] every hand in the house should be up he
[1:17:17] says if you've been Sanctified that's
[1:17:20] good he says but when you received the
[1:17:23] Holy Ghost it's a finished
[1:17:25] work see God has completed his Plan of
[1:17:28] Salvation and sealed it with the baptism
[1:17:31] of of the Holy Ghost see the Holy Ghost
[1:17:33] in every place in the Bible is a
[1:17:36] finished work and God completed his work
[1:17:39] and not only is the Holy Ghost God
[1:17:42] filling us or baptizing us into his body
[1:17:45] not only is it a finished work but the
[1:17:46] Holy Ghost is also a
[1:17:48] token so we're going to look at this
[1:17:50] just for a minute Exodus 12 and verse 12
[1:17:54] Exodus 12:12 says I will pass through
[1:17:56] the land of Egypt this night and I will
[1:17:59] Smite their firstborn in the land of
[1:18:01] Egypt both man and Beast and against all
[1:18:04] the gods of Egypt will I execute
[1:18:05] judgment I am the
[1:18:08] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a
[1:18:12] token upon the houses where you are and
[1:18:15] when I see the blood I'll pass over you
[1:18:17] and the plague shall not be upon you to
[1:18:19] destroy you when I smite the land of
[1:18:22] Egypt so God provided a lamb's death of
[1:18:26] blood as an an accept accepted
[1:18:29] substitute for the firstborn see the
[1:18:31] blood on the doorpost was a token it was
[1:18:34] a sign that something died in the
[1:18:37] inhabitants place is that okay tonight

[1:19:13] answer for complexes and family strains

[1:19:21] flesh of our is going to shed its rope
[1:19:23] and we're going to step into a new body

[1:19:27] blood is the answer oh when they was
[1:19:31] getting ready to leave Egypt it had to
[1:19:33] be blood and if we're getting ready to
[1:19:34] leave this Egypt it's got to be blood
[1:19:37] again blood's got to be on the doorpost
[1:19:40] of your heart you're not making it out
[1:19:42] without
[1:19:43] it the Holy Ghost seals
[1:19:46] you see it's not something that we have
[1:19:48] to guess
[1:19:50] at we have some that want to preach that
[1:19:53] you got to have you got get Justified
[1:19:55] and you get Sanctified and and then you
[1:19:57] get rest the the Holy Ghost and then you
[1:20:00] get adopted oh my
[1:20:04] goodness how many of you know that you
[1:20:06] got
[1:20:08] adopted but some of them preach it I
[1:20:10] mean they they preach it as to guess
[1:20:11] workor you got all three and now all of
[1:20:13] a sudden you got to get
[1:20:15] adopted well the Holy Ghost is your
[1:20:20] adoption God ain't going to put his
[1:20:22] stamp over approval on some unwarranted
[1:20:24] life he ain't going to put his stamp of
[1:20:25] approval on somebody still dabbling in
[1:20:27] sin still looking at things he shouldn't
[1:20:29] look at no sir God puts his stamp of
[1:20:32] approval on a consecrated sold out
[1:20:35] Justified Sanctified born again son and
[1:20:37] daughter of God that's what he's putting
[1:20:39] his stamp of approval
[1:20:41] on see it seals you to the day of your
[1:20:44] Redemption you don't get a sealing one
[1:20:46] day and all of a sudden you got to go
[1:20:48] down a few more weeks or months or years
[1:20:50] and hope and pray you get adopted it is
[1:20:53] your adoption the Holy Ghost is your
[1:20:57] adoption it is the answer to the
[1:21:02] question to sin's question that I don't
[1:21:05] have to sin anymore I don't have those
[1:21:08] desires
[1:21:09] anymore it's the
[1:21:11] answer notice brother Brown said I used
[1:21:13] to work for a railroad
[1:21:15] company he goes and before that car
[1:21:17] could be sealed the inspector would come
[1:21:19] around to see if that car was properly
[1:21:21] loaded
[1:21:23] you know he come in he'll shake it he'll
[1:21:26] climb on the inside he'll make sure all
[1:21:27] the contents are exactly where they
[1:21:29] should be and all tied down the way they
[1:21:31] should be because he said there was
[1:21:33] going to be a rough road ahead he had to
[1:21:35] make sure that the contents on the
[1:21:37] inside of that cart would make it there
[1:21:39] and when he shut the door and put his
[1:21:41] seal on it he was verifying that the
[1:21:43] contents I've done expected it
[1:21:46] everything on the inside of here is
[1:21:47] where it needs to be the life is where
[1:21:49] it should be and I put my approval on it
[1:21:52] and and he was declaring it's going to
[1:21:54] make it at Eternal destination and what
[1:21:56] am I telling you when God gives you the
[1:21:58] Holy Ghost when God gives you that
[1:22:00] answer he is telling you right now
[1:22:02] brother and S no matter how bad leoda
[1:22:04] gets no matter how sick you get no
[1:22:07] matter how tired you get you're going to
[1:22:09] make it oh hallelujah we're going to
[1:22:11] make it Oh Glory to God you don't have
[1:22:15] to worry about falling you don't have to
[1:22:16] worry about coming short you're going to
[1:22:18] make
[1:22:19] it we got the evidence we got the answer
[1:22:23] tonight the holy ghost in the heart of a
[1:22:25] Believer is the
[1:22:30] answer he said what's the Holy Ghost
[1:22:32] doing he goes and he inspects that's the
[1:22:36] reason you can't notice I want you to
[1:22:38] hear this he goes that's the reason you
[1:22:42] can't have these things like well I
[1:22:43] spoke in tongues and I shouted and I
[1:22:45] danc in the spirit he said that don't
[1:22:47] have one thing to do with
[1:22:49] it so some of you that shouted that's
[1:22:52] fine fine we want you to shout some of
[1:22:55] you that jumped and danced in the spirit
[1:22:57] that's fine we want you to continue that
[1:23:00] some of you that spoke in tongues keep
[1:23:02] speaking in tongues but that ain't
[1:23:06] it you got to make sure that the
[1:23:08] contents are sealed that's right you got
[1:23:11] to make sure that what's on the inside
[1:23:14] of you is past
[1:23:17] inspection it's a rough road ahead look
[1:23:20] around look at Fox News look at CNN news
[1:23:23] look what's going on all around us you
[1:23:24] got to be blind deaf and dumb to not
[1:23:26] realize we're at the End of the Age oh
[1:23:29] but we got a promise we got a promise
[1:23:31] brother e oh that the con the
[1:23:33] inspector's coming through even again
[1:23:35] tonight and what is he doing he's here
[1:23:37] tonight to put his stamp on a young
[1:23:39] person to put his approval on a young
[1:23:41] person tonight they say yes you have met
[1:23:43] the requirements you have met at the
[1:23:45] contents are where they need to be and
[1:23:47] I'm going to seal you with the Holy
[1:23:48] Ghost until the day of your Redemption
[1:23:55] so we have a positive
[1:23:57] token brother B say the holy spirit is
[1:23:59] our token therefore when you receive the
[1:24:02] Holy Ghost you pass from Death unto life
[1:24:06] he said that's all there is to it
[1:24:07] because life is in you you can no more
[1:24:09] perish he that's born of God does not
[1:24:12] commit sin for he cannot sin for the
[1:24:15] seed of God Amen the seed of God remains
[1:24:18] in him and now he can he says and now he
[1:24:21] goes and how can he sin when a sinless
[1:24:24] God is in him think about it how can you
[1:24:28] sin when a sinless God is in you but
[1:24:33] Satan says how can a sinless God be in
[1:24:36] you when you're
[1:24:39] man how
[1:24:41] never never had there been a man outside
[1:24:45] of Christ was able to withstand my vices
[1:24:49] withstand my my Temptations I I could
[1:24:52] put those images in front of them
[1:24:53] they're going to fall every
[1:24:55] time but like Jesus God's declared I go
[1:24:59] I'm going to have one that's right I'm
[1:25:02] going to have somebody I'm G to have
[1:25:03] sons and daughters of God they're going
[1:25:05] to get down there it's going to be the
[1:25:06] worst age they going to be in the midst
[1:25:08] of Satan zeden but they're going to come
[1:25:10] out they're going to be in the midst of
[1:25:12] the worst age ever known to man sin
[1:25:15] depravity on every part but they're
[1:25:16] going to keep their head up they're
[1:25:18] going to keep looking to the word
[1:25:19] they're going to keep professing why cuz
[1:25:21] it ain't them it's no longer I that
[1:25:23] liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[1:25:25] that's the answer tonight to the devil's
[1:25:27] question it ain't you doing it with your
[1:25:29] Humanity it ain't you doing it because
[1:25:30] you belong to even like Tabernacle it's
[1:25:32] not you doing because you say I believe
[1:25:33] God sent a prophet it ain't you because
[1:25:35] you believe William Brad it's because
[1:25:37] almighty God had come down and sealed
[1:25:40] you with the Holy Ghost there's the
[1:25:42] answer to the devil's question there's
[1:25:44] the answer to sin's question there's the
[1:25:46] answer to the sickness question there's
[1:25:47] the answer right there and we had the
[1:25:51] answer it's not a guessing game you
[1:25:53] don't have to worry about it will I be
[1:25:56] when will it happen if you got the Holy
[1:25:58] Ghost tonight you got the
[1:26:02] answer you can walk around with your
[1:26:04] head up yes you ain't got to be
[1:26:07] intimidated because you don't know the
[1:26:09] answer because you got it tonight some
[1:26:12] of you that's born again of the Holy
[1:26:14] Ghost now so does brother Brandon
[1:26:16] preached adoption to Spirit fill
[1:26:19] people think about it notice when he was
[1:26:22] was preaching he preached the
[1:26:24] Pentecostals that claim they were born
[1:26:26] again filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:27] women were cutting their hair wearing
[1:26:29] makeup some starting to wear pants and
[1:26:32] trousers men telling dirty jokes smoking
[1:26:34] cigarettes
[1:26:36] Pentecostals men living two or three
[1:26:38] times with several different women some
[1:26:40] of them having kids outside of their
[1:26:42] their their spouse and yet they're
[1:26:45] claiming Born Again Holy Ghost fill
[1:26:47] people and that's why the prophet of God
[1:26:50] said you got you claim that but you got
[1:26:52] to go on to adoption otherwise what was
[1:26:54] he telling them he tell what you got
[1:26:56] didn't work only what you received was
[1:26:58] an a portion but I'm here to tell you
[1:27:00] there's more than a portion that's been
[1:27:01] given in this hour church God had come
[1:27:04] and visit us personally in this
[1:27:07] age it's got to be more than an isua
[1:27:09] Street with the restoration of
[1:27:13] gifts or we appreciate isua it has its
[1:27:16] place but don't tie your experience to
[1:27:18] an isua sensation don't tie your
[1:27:21] experience to a speaking in tongues or a
[1:27:23] dance or a shout you tie your experience
[1:27:25] to the word of God make sure that he has
[1:27:28] come on the inside and your Natures are
[1:27:31] now changed and your desires are
[1:27:36] changed notice now love how brother Tim
[1:27:40] put this he said within the isusa Full
[1:27:42] Gospel Movement people were abandoning
[1:27:45] every vestage in standard of Holiness
[1:27:48] and they refuse to take on his
[1:27:50] name see they're Miss misbehavior
[1:27:53] prevented them from being positioned in
[1:27:55] the body their
[1:27:58] misbehavior but your behavior your
[1:28:01] obedience permits you to receive that
[1:28:04] stamp of approval that seal of the Holy
[1:28:07] Ghost see it's a token that's why the
[1:28:10] token message is so important and notice
[1:28:13] when was the token given in the evening
[1:28:18] time so I'm going to say
[1:28:20] something with without this message you
[1:28:24] couldn't receive the Holy Ghost you
[1:28:27] could receive a portion so in Luther's
[1:28:30] day they received a portion of the Holy
[1:28:32] Ghost
[1:28:33] justification and when Wesley came they
[1:28:35] received another portion of the Holy
[1:28:37] Ghost in
[1:28:38] sanctification then in the early 1900s
[1:28:41] with the isua movement they received
[1:28:43] another portion the restoration of the
[1:28:46] gifts but Malachi 4 when Malachi 4 came
[1:28:51] that's when the hearts of the people
[1:28:53] begin to be turned back to the faith of
[1:28:56] the father so it would take a Malachi 4
[1:28:59] Ministry to what bring the word of God
[1:29:02] back down to a people where it's no
[1:29:04] longer God in portion in justification
[1:29:07] and just sanctification or just gifts
[1:29:09] and shouting and dance but now in this
[1:29:12] hour through this message we once again
[1:29:15] have invited almighty God to come back
[1:29:17] and Tabernacle our Humanity oh
[1:29:20] Hallelujah church we got the answer and
[1:29:23] it ain't just some portion it's the full
[1:29:26] deal we got the answer tonight God once
[1:29:30] again is on display in this
[1:29:35] hour we have notice what he says in the
[1:29:38] token message we have a token in this
[1:29:42] day he says we've been given a token
[1:29:45] which is the anti-type of the type of
[1:29:48] the natural token he says we have been
[1:29:50] given the super natural Supreme
[1:29:54] token he didn't say isua received it he
[1:29:57] didn't say Luther received it he didn't
[1:30:00] say Wesley received it he said we
[1:30:03] received
[1:30:04] it come on some of you get the frown off
[1:30:07] your face and look at what he's telling
[1:30:09] you tonight you've received that Supreme
[1:30:12] Supernatural Supreme
[1:30:16] token never has there been an age to
[1:30:20] where the Holy Ghost can come back
[1:30:23] a people a bride that he can put his
[1:30:27] life
[1:30:28] in never notice see the previous ages
[1:30:33] only had them in portion and brother
[1:30:35] Brown would tell us he says now all that
[1:30:37] was foreshadowed had been given to this
[1:30:41] generation all that's been
[1:30:44] foreshadowed blessed are your eyes for
[1:30:48] they see and blessed are your ears for
[1:30:52] they hear what other
[1:30:54] Generations have longed for what
[1:30:58] Pentecostal they got so close but they
[1:31:01] couldn't carry over they got right up to
[1:31:03] the Border looked over and said you know
[1:31:05] what I'm not going to take on that name
[1:31:08] God said that's fine I'll have a people
[1:31:09] that will and that's why the message
[1:31:12] came and the messenger comes at the end
[1:31:16] of the
[1:31:17] age with a purpose to call out a people
[1:31:20] yes sir call out a people yes with an
[1:31:23] answer with an
[1:31:25] answer oh my oh you know let me just can
[1:31:29] I go just a little bit
[1:31:31] further notice now all that's been
[1:31:33] foreshadow has been portions of the
[1:31:35] spirit that's been but in this
[1:31:37] generation we got the
[1:31:39] fullness see it wasn't the fullness in
[1:31:41] Luther's day or Wesley's day or Zeus's
[1:31:43] day but through the message of Malachi 4
[1:31:46] God had once again given this generation
[1:31:49] the token
[1:31:50] life see it's no longer God above us in
[1:31:53] the pillar of fire it's no longer God
[1:31:55] With Us in Christ walking with us but
[1:31:57] now it's God in
[1:31:59] us oh
[1:32:01] my oh man I think about that when I walk
[1:32:04] I knew the life I used to live and now
[1:32:06] I've been filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:32:07] and things I used to desire I don't
[1:32:08] desire no more and I trust every one of
[1:32:10] you been born again of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:12] can say the same thing the things I used
[1:32:14] to desire I don't desire no more the
[1:32:16] life I used to live I don't live anymore
[1:32:18] the things I used to do I don't do
[1:32:20] anymore why because why because you've
[1:32:22] been
[1:32:23] adopted because you've been placed
[1:32:25] because you've been sealed it's a
[1:32:27] finished work notice he would tell us
[1:32:30] that the our identification is to
[1:32:32] manifest the word of God he said these
[1:32:35] signs shall follow them that believe not
[1:32:37] just professors but identified
[1:32:41] believers they shall follow them that
[1:32:44] believe just absolutely impossible for
[1:32:46] it not to happen so these brothers that
[1:32:48] don't want the signs they don't want to
[1:32:51] be true father followers of Christ
[1:32:53] because he said it's just absolutely
[1:32:55] impossible for it not to happen the
[1:32:57] works that I do shall you do also that's
[1:33:00] the identification Jesus's
[1:33:02] identification was to manifest the word
[1:33:04] of God which he was and the church's
[1:33:08] identification today is to manifest the
[1:33:11] promised word of this day by The Same
[1:33:13] Spirit that manifested and Quicken the
[1:33:16] word
[1:33:17] then so those that are going in the
[1:33:19] Rapture how many you going in the
[1:33:20] rapture you can't have just a
[1:33:24] portion you got to have the
[1:33:27] fullness you can have you got to have
[1:33:29] more than just a confession of faith we
[1:33:31] appreciate that but you got to build on
[1:33:32] that confession and get
[1:33:34] Sanctified you got to get more than just
[1:33:36] Sanctified you got to be born again of
[1:33:37] the spirit of God brother B said you can
[1:33:39] be justified without being Sanctified
[1:33:40] you can be Sanctified without being
[1:33:42] being being the Holy Ghost filled he
[1:33:44] goes but you can never receive the Su
[1:33:46] but what first you got to go through all
[1:33:47] these
[1:33:48] channels notice a person can do all this
[1:33:52] and still not have the Holy Spirit see
[1:33:56] you can be justified without being
[1:33:57] Sanctified and Sanctified without having
[1:33:59] a holy ghost but when it comes to finish
[1:34:01] both justification and sanctification
[1:34:03] the Seal of the Lord Jesus Christ by the
[1:34:05] baptism is put on
[1:34:07] you so that's what we want church and
[1:34:10] the message is to bring back the
[1:34:13] word you believe that and Christ is the
[1:34:17] word so if the message is to bring back
[1:34:20] the word which is Christ and how could
[1:34:21] you be filled with the Holy Spirit in
[1:34:23] fullness prior to the
[1:34:26] message so it's more than just a baptism
[1:34:29] of Holy Ghost on the spirit realm that
[1:34:31] we want it's more than just an emotional
[1:34:34] response of rejoicing and
[1:34:37] shouting and if Aza movement and its
[1:34:39] predecessors like Luther and Wesley was
[1:34:41] the final quickening then why did we
[1:34:44] need the
[1:34:45] message why did we need the message to
[1:34:48] come because the message is bringing
[1:34:51] back Christ Christ not just in letter
[1:34:54] form not just in tape form but it's
[1:34:58] bringing back Christ in Bride form it's
[1:35:01] bringing back Christ in word form the
[1:35:04] word once again made flesh and dwelling
[1:35:08] Among Us your neighbor if you look at it
[1:35:11] look past that Veil that's the word made
[1:35:14] flesh and all their failures and all
[1:35:17] their flaws it's still the word made
[1:35:19] flesh for those who receive the baptism
[1:35:22] of the Holy Ghost so the baptism of the
[1:35:24] Holy Ghost is the answer it's the token
[1:35:27] it's the literal life it's the proof
[1:35:29] that you have died to self and to the
[1:35:31] things of the world and you had been
[1:35:33] sealed it's your identification that you
[1:35:35] are in fact a son and daughter of God
[1:35:38] it's the fact that the life of the
[1:35:41] father is living in
[1:35:44] you and brother Brown I'm I'm gonna
[1:35:46] close here in just a few
[1:35:48] minutes he said there's been churches
[1:35:50] churches and there have been Brides
[1:35:52] brides churches and Brides he said but
[1:35:54] there has to come
[1:35:56] one there's been claims put on as being
[1:36:00] the bride through many
[1:36:02] generations but they only had a
[1:36:04] portion and yet they had a claim but he
[1:36:07] said there has to come one that's both
[1:36:11] Dynamics and the
[1:36:13] mechanics preach the gospel is not just
[1:36:16] preaching it like I am right now with
[1:36:17] voice but he said to preach the gospel
[1:36:20] is to demonstrate the power of the word
[1:36:22] of God to make that word do what it says
[1:36:25] it will do to make that word perform
[1:36:29] what it says it would do that's what is
[1:36:31] bringing back or that's what the Holy
[1:36:33] Ghost is to do in this hour is to
[1:36:35] declare that the same word the same
[1:36:38] signs the same wers is among the same
[1:36:40] people professing the same
[1:36:44] life so the bride he said the he said
[1:36:47] and being the groom the bride has to
[1:36:49] come forth because it's part of to him

[1:36:57] groom speaks of the Bride see God forsaw
[1:37:01] the bride in the groom and Jesus took
[1:37:04] his wife's place and became sin for her
