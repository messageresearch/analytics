[0:00] When the spirit of God is so far into
[0:01] the church that they know nothing about
[0:04] casting out devils,
[0:07] they know nothing about the spirit of
[0:09] God moving. They know nothing about the
[0:12] Holy Ghost and a genuine in infilling.
[0:18] When it gets to that place,
[0:21] they have a name that they're living
[0:25] but are dead.
[0:30] I want to know,
[0:33] are you a Christian by name only?
[0:38] Are you a message believer by name only?
[0:42] If the veil was open in your heart,
[0:46] is the pillar of fire there?
[0:50] I want to know, are you living on past
[0:52] reputations when he raised down his hand
[0:55] for me?
[0:57] [Music]
[0:59] or are you living on past reputations
[1:01] [Music]
[1:05] or what you once were?
[1:10] Have you lost that first love
[1:15] has murmuring got in your heart
[1:18] and you no longer can break the bread
[1:20] with singleness of heart
[1:24] and unity of the spirit.
[1:30] He's reaching down for you today.
[1:37] Let him speak.
[1:40] Let him talk to you in a personal way
[1:45] and you examine your life.
[1:48] Where am I?
[1:53] If the voice
[1:55] would change,
[2:01] if it would change from the voice to the
[2:04] trumpet,
[2:08] would you hear the call?
[2:17] Are you a bride prepared to meet the
[2:20] bridegroom?
[2:23] Or is there things in your life you just
[2:26] really need
[2:28] to deal with
[2:31] to be zealous
[2:33] and repent
[2:36] when he reached
[2:39] down his hand
[2:42] for me. I'm so thankful he did.
[2:46] He's reaching down this.
[2:49] [Music]
[2:58] Well, I was lost.
[3:01] I was undone
[3:04] without God.
[3:08] [Music]
[3:16] One more time. Sing it.
[3:26] Is your wall on the altar?
[3:30] Is the murmur gone out of your heart?
[3:35] Are you still just worried about clicks
[3:37] and clams and everything else rather
[3:39] than the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[3:42] that makes us all?
[3:48] Is it time to really dedicate your life
[3:51] a new or maybe dedicated for the first
[3:54] time?
[3:56] This altar is open.
[3:59] You are invited. The spirit of the bride
[4:02] say, "Come." When he reached
