our mouth Lord open our ears Lord we ask you to take complete control Lord that as we look down Through the Ages Lord Lord Lord we can see the great truth that you've revealed in this day Lord and may we not just leave these things in the past or in history but may we recognize where they're applicable in our own lives father Lord for we know that the spirits that have attacked down Through the Ages still attack Lord but the same power that you gave to the men and women down through the ages to overcome with still overcomes in this day Lord we just thank you Lord God for that we ask you that you'll speak now that you'll take control of this service and that you'll have your way Lord we just committed all to to you now in the name of Jesus we pray amen and amen hallelujah isn't it good to be in the house of God Amen well um if you're surprised to see me up here tonight you're not near as surprised as I am I uh no brother Timothy woke up sick this morning and so um brother Tim had asked me if I would stand in tonight and and and have the opportunity Unity to share with you the church what we have been sharing with uh with the young people as we've studied the church ages and so um we're going to read one one scripture here in in the Book of Revelation if you'll turn with me to Revelation 2 and and and and we'll read um verse 12 and we'll just remain standing as as we read this one verse then I'll let you have your seat and we'll come back to the scriptures later uh Revelation 2 and verse 12 it says and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges amen I pray that the Lord will add His blessings to the word as you have your seats tonight amen so it'll be a little different tonight I I'm I'm not necessarily going to do anything different I'm just going to approach this the same way I do our youth services and just trust that the Lord will have his his way and that that that he'll move the way he wants to move and and that we can just get ourselves out of the way tonight amen amen so we've been studying with with the youth the the the the church age book and and I would like to say that if if you haven't read it recently I would recommend that you do I would recommend that you get in it it's not one of those things that you read once and say well I've read it or you know I know what's in there but but just everything we believe you can find in the church age book uh after the Bible I think it's the most important book that there is and and I think that we should go through it you know time and and time again and I'd like to you know and when you read it don't just read it but read it with with a mind of Revelation and Lord open your word to me and and and and actually go through it and digest it but with the youth we have come down through and studied the revelation of Jesus Christ we've studied the patmas vision the Ephesian age and we've also already studied the sman age and we find that it's important because brother Bram says for out of the Ages come the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets and out of the trumpets come the vows like the first burst of a Roman Candle the church Ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light but once the Brilliance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the Revelation open wide before our wondering eyes you read that and you can see the importance of understanding and Revelation and digging into this and and it's important once again to to stress the importance of revelation we can read it we we can memorize it we can learn things but we want it to be more than that tonight we want it to be God revealing himself to us re revealing himself to our soul to where there's a true understanding not just a head knowledge not just something that that we know because we've memorized it but we know because we've met the author we know because he's opened it up to us amen we want God to reveal himself to us and brother brand says the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized so no matter how much we talk about it no matter how much we preach about it no matter how much we put it out there we cannot overemphasize it he says it can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation he says I'm talking about revelation God revealing himself to you personally amen once God's revealed something to you there's nobody no man no Spirit no devil no nothing that can take it out of your heart if you know this message by head knowledge and you have an argument then somebody might can just come and out argue but once you have an experience and a revelation of who God is you're not the at the mercy of an argument you're not the at the mercy of somebody with the better head knowledge than you because it anchors down in your soul and it's there forever it is an eternal Revelation amen so we have we have studied with the young people the the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ the errors of the Trinity Doctrine because we know and the word proves and history proves that they didn't believe in three Gods at the beginning they didn't believe in three gods in the book of Acts and it wasn't until the nying Council of 325 ad that that the Roman way of polytheistic worship became instituted into the church and we've studied proper baptism in the name of Jesus Christ according to the scriptures we've studied the original sin in the garden and thus because of the original sin the the two separate vines that we find winding down through the church ages and all through time and we know that there's one True Vine and one false Vine and how that false Vine is always trying to take the life away and choke out the True Vine she's always trying to rob that life and and we we've studied the persecution of the church and the tribulations that the Saints down Through the Ages have endured for the cause of Christ and many other things we've covered like the sound of many Waters the Seven Stars in his right hand the Sevenfold Glory of his person all these things and now we're coming to a new age tonight we've studied The Messengers in each age but now we're at the start of another age the pergami and age and so that's where we find ourselves tonight the it says and I'm going to read again and to the angel in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling B before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed un idols and to commit fornication says so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saveth he that receiveth it amen so tonight this this is the message to to the church there at pergamus we'll probably only get to to look at at verse 12 and verse 13 but we want to look for a minute a lot of this will be informational because we're going just through the church age book as as brother Bram would do it pergamus lasted from 3:12 to 606 ad you can see it here on the map in the northern part there of Asia Minor you can see the seven churches we started at Ephesus went up to Smyrna and now we're up at at pergamus pergamon was the actual the ancient name um but as down through time it became known as pergamus what you see here is just some of the the ruins that are still left behind from that time that still stand to this day there at the city of pergamus pergamus was located on three different Rivers one of these Rivers had access down to the Sea and it wasn't a small place there was over 2,000 th 200,000 residents that lived in pergamus at its apex when it was at its most powerful and and and brother Brown it was a major intellectual and Cultural Center brother Bram says yes it was a a a a a city of great sin given over to lentu rights of the worship of of of aspius whom they worshiped in the form of a living serpent which was housed and fed in the temple he goes on to say in this beautiful city of irrigated Groves public walks and Parks lived a small group of dedicated Believers I like to believe that that would be our description even today maybe we live in a world full of sin a world full of evil and you know in this place they were actually worshiping a living serpent we live in a time where people worship the devil they may call on the name of Jesus but they they they worship the devil their lives prove that their lives manifest that we're surrounded by evil but down there in Le oosa there is a small group of dedicated Believers there are people that have received the truth of the day and they're holding on to it no matter what comes no matter who tries to pull away no matter who tries to strip us of of of the god-given rights that we have in this day we're going to stand firm and fight for them and we're not backing off and one day there'll be written of us that there was a small group of dedicated Believers that stood firm in the face of evil that stood firm in the the face of sin Amen brother Brown makes it clear that the key to the whole church AE study to everything he said it is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is that's why the the very theme of this message was Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and brother brandham goes and some of these things are very very impertinent to our day as as there's people saying that you know maybe you shouldn't have so much emotion in the church and and we don't need certain things and certain things are are have been put on the shelf and you don't get the new birth the way they used to and and then you know that maybe there's no true revival going on things like that but brother brandham says speaking of how God never changes he says that is how it is done the true church how many believe we're the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost he says the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one and The Messengers to the churches having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul so he's using scriptural pattern here and he says using history as our source he says we can find what men in each age were the closest to the original pattern and we know that the Apostle Paul was the original messenger so what they so what he would do is he would examine the ministry of those men that God used to restore truth in each age not that there was just one there may have been many that God used to restore truth in each in each age but brother Brandon would go and he would examine them and he would use this scriptural pattern he says then out of those there would be one of every age who would stand out the clearest as the closest in word pattern and power that one would be the messenger now as he looked he they wouldn't be carbon copies it wouldn't be in somebody trying to stand a certain way talk a certain way that's not what he's talking about they wouldn't be carbon copies but all of all the gifts and of all the Ministries in each age the one that is the most like Paul meaning that preached the word the way he preached it that stood for the truth that Paul stood for the one who who who who would would contend for the faith as it was once delivered that one he said would be the messenger to each age and he says as like begets like now listen again the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her found ERS at Pentecost how different is that from those trying their best to distance themselves from Pentecost not only are we not trying to be just exactly like it but we're literally finding people pushing away saying we don't need we don't need and brother brandham saying the true church is going to literally try to copy it they're going to look at it and say what was at Pentecost is mind what the new birth that they had at Pentecost is mind the Salvation that their kids could get in the book of Acts is for me the healings they had is for me where they spoke in tongues we can too where there was gifts we can have those gifts too he's saying that what the church had at Pentecost is the inalienable right of each and every one of you and he says the true church is going to try to get a hold of it they're going to fight for it he says and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first age he says it is that simple and that wonderful why have we complicated it so much it's that simple it's really not even it's one of those things there's things in the scripture that I can understand sometimes maybe you don't see it the way I see it and I don't see it but brother Brown says this isn't debatable this is how it is it's that simple so using this scriptural pattern he says useing our god-given rule for choosing the messenger to each age that is we choose the one whose Ministry most closely approximates that of the first messenger Paul we unhesitatingly declare the pergami and Messenger to be Martin I read that and I thought isn't that awesome just the way brother brandham worded that right there unhesitatingly declare you talk about seeing things from a higher plane you talk about uh uh being being able to see things in this day that no other age has been able to see we can look at things in the past and study things from past ages that others can only prob at and well maybe it was like this and maybe this and you know and who knows and yet we look at it clearly we don't wonder if maybe it was Martin we can unhesitatingly declare today that the messenger of this age was Martin there's no doubt out there's no wonder but it's been declared to us in this day unhesitating listen in a world of darkness in a world where there is no truth in a world where people are wandering around aimlessly we can stand today unhesitatingly and say God sent a message in this day God has restored truth in this day God has turned our hearts back in this day I don't have to be ashamed that God sent a prophet I don't got that doesn't embarrassed me none because I can take everything he said right back to the word unhesitatingly and so it's been Vindicated Time After Time After Time we can stand on this message tonight unhesitatingly Martin was born in Hungary in 3:15 brother Brown says however his life work was in France where he labored in and around tours as a bishop he died in 399 he's the uncle of St Patrick of ir Ireland and he was a professional Soldier brother brandham goes on to talk about Martin and his conversion and and and some of the things that that that pointed to him that let him know that he was the messenger for the age he says Martin was converted to Christ while he was following a career as a professional Soldier and his conversion came from a very Supernatural event that he experienced while he was a soldier as as he was on patrol one night and it was freezing cold and snow and and things of that nature there was a beggar there on the side of the road that was freezing to death and no one else had paid any attention to him they just left it there Along by the side didn't give no heed to him and just let him lay there until Martin comes along and Martin sees him there and in the bitter cold and and he doesn't have ant extra coat or an extra cloak that he can give him so he takes off the one that he's wearing and he cuts it in half and then he takes and wraps the beggar there in the in one half of it that he can be shielded from the cold and and warm and and brother Bram says he attended him the best he could and went on his way he says that night the Lord Jesus appeared unto him in a vision there he stood like a beggar wrapped in the half of Martin's garment he spoke to him and said Martin though he is only a cuman has clothed Me With His Garment he says from that moment on he sought to serve God with all his heart and his life became a series of Supernatural Miracles that manifested the power of God you know and I could only I just thought about that Within Myself and I and I know this is just just me in my own mind but I thought today you we there are things that the church world is just neglecting and they're just just leaving Jesus neglected there with dirty feet and they're not paying him any attention but there's somebody coming along and recognizing that that part of the word supposed to be picked up and that part of the word is supposed to be picked up and it's supposed to be taken care of and cherished and brought in from from the from the world where it's been neglected and left out there and there's a people today that's taking the very word Jesus and putting it back in a place that it deserves in a place of reverence and then picking it up and saying the word matters the truth matters others may have left it neglected by the wayside but to us we're not going to leave it there but we're going to pick it up and we're not just going to live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God yes says from that moment on his life became a series of Supernatural Miracles that manifested the power of God so apparently that the the the the works that happened in the book of Acts were still happening here in the pergan church age those that followed the me the true message in the pergami ande were experiencing and witnessing the supernatural it says after having left the Army brother Brown says and having become a leader in the church he took a militant stand against idolatry he cut down the Pagan Groves tore down the images of of their idols and he destroyed their altars says he had no fear I I like a man that has no fear that isn't afraid to stand up for what he believes in says he had no fear of the enemy regardless of their standing or regardless of their position he wasn't swayed by politics he wasn't swayed by who paid the most highs and and this that and the other he didn't care about any of that stuff so he he withstood Bishops he withstood Emperors he withstood everyone as long as they were standing against the word of God says one ruler actually refused to open the gates and let him in because he had this this Emperor was persecuting people and and and so Martin's there to speak with him and so he prayed and the gates open supernaturally so Martin goes in and the emperor won't even look at him just hay and won't even look at him refuses to listen to him refuses to speak to him so right there in his presence Martin falls on his face and goes to prayer again and then right there in the midst of witnesses a a fire burst forth out of the throne that the emperor is sitting on and he has to come running down off of the throne right there and brother brandham just says he says God will always humble the hoty he'll always humble the hoty but right there Martin was a man who operated and believed in the Supernatural says historians acknowledge that on least three occasions he raised the dead by faith in jesus' name such was his order in serving the lord that the devil was mightily aroused what is your testimony what is your testimony is the devil taking note of your presence because it talks about how upset that the devil was with Martin to the point that that that he would even send assassins to try to take his life for doing nothing other than standing for the word of God because I'll tell you this and we'll get into this later the things go hand in hand when you stand for the word of God the supernatural will follow and the supernatural going on you just start letting Supernatural take place you'll start making enemies that that you didn't even try to make you'll start having people not liking you and trying to call you out and you hadn't said nothing or done nothing you're just standing for the word of God you're just letting the supernatural move and people start taking note and people start hating you and brother brandham says the devil took note of Martin I want that to be my testimony I want that not that I care if the devil knows about me I want God to know me but I do want the devil to know that there's somebody down there shaking up my Kingdom there's somebody there that's tearing things up that's standing for truth that won't back off the word no matter how much lay at a see and pressure I put on them no matter how lukewarm other people get there's somebody down there that's still preaching it straight and truth and saying this is a Living Word with the Living God and there's a power under Resurrection says too often when men are signally used of the Lord they become lifted up with pride but not so with Martin he ever remained The Humble servant of God brother brandham says surely this was a great man a true Messenger to the age never desirous of all but to please God he lived the most consecrated life he says by signs and wonders by signs and wonders by the power of the spirit Martin was truly Vindicated as the messenger to that age but not only was he gifted by a great ministry he himself was forever true to the word of God I don't care how great your ministry is if you can't stay true to the word of God if you begin to get so lifted up that you think your ideas matter you will be humbled you will be brought down but he says he fought organization he with stod sin in high places he championed the truth in word and deed and lived out a full life of Christian Victory listen at the end of it all I hope I hope that can say that that that that the Lord worked through me to do some miraculous things and and all those things I I I believe that these signs shall follow them that believe I say it over and over we'll say it a bunch tonight but at the end of my life if time terries I hope people can say that he lived out a full life of Christian Victory because in the end that's what it's all about is the Holy Ghost you claim to have producing victory in your life you can produce signs and wonders and speak in tongues and shout and dance but I want you to produce Victory I'm looking for victory because it's the Victorious that's going to leave here it's the Victorious that's going to have a body change what we need in the lives of men and women tonight is VI victory Victorious lives dear in this age there was continued persecution scripture would tell us in John 16 and 2 they shall put you out of the synagogues yay the time cometh that whosoever kth you will think that he doeth God a service Matthew 24:9 then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake God was moving and the devil was stirred up the persecution of the previous age had not Abad and and looking there at John 162 where it says that whosoever kth you will think that he doeth God a service brother brandham says he says they were burned at the stake they were nailed to logs face down and wild dogs were turned loose upon them so that the dogs would tear away the Flesh and bowels leaving the victim to die in terrible torture babes were ripped from expecting mothers and thrown to the Hogs and he says what made it even worse is that a lot of this was being done by others who claimed to be Christians that thought they were stomping out you Heretics so they thought they were doing this to do God a service but as I read that and I didn't quote all of it because he goes on and on but you get get the point nailed the logs face down and wild dogs turn loose on them tear away their flesh and bowels babes ripped from expecting mothers thrown to the Hogs and I thought how do we even have the nerve to voice our trials and our tribulations how do we even have the nerve to ever complain how are we so caught up in the little things that would divide us H how have we gotten to the place that we're so soft as Christians that we actually gripe about the temperature in the church I know I get cold up here sometimes too I'm not talking about saying man it was cold but there are people who literally gripe and let it ruin their service I was so cold were you tied face down and Wild Dogs released upon you during the service I mean seriously we got to the place where we'll gripe about how loud a mic is or who's preaching or who's leading singing look we're all human we all have our likes and dislikes preferences you know nobody wants their ears to hurt because the mics were to nobody wants anything like that I understand Humanity but when it comes right down to it the amount of time and energy we put into into griping and into negativity when I'm saying just have the strength to push through have the strength to push that out of your mind and say I've gathered here to have service I've gathered here to hear from God and I'm going to do that no matter if things are perfect or not at least I'm not getting eaten by dogs or thrown to the Hogs or burned at the steak and none of that is happening here tonight I promise the Lord praise the Lord let's not be so soft let's recognize these people had their eyes on the prize these people if we could get that get our Focus back on the prize and why we gather and what we're doing and what we're fighting for and what the prize is and we start to let those little things fall off to the side and recognize look just around the curve we're going home we're right here on the final lap we're right here at the end of time I will not be distracted I will not be pulled off into negativity but I'm going to keep my eyes on the prize it's Rapture day it's going home time it's Victory Day let's bring our Focus back tonight they were Valiant and they were Brave and they went to their desk praising God praising God that they were accounted worthy my let that become our Focus again God let me be accounted worthy Lord to fulfill what you've called me to fulfill in this day and in this day he's not even calling you you to die for him he's calling you to live for him he's he Lord let me be accounted worthy to manifest you in this day to be a light shining in darkness in this last day to manifest you in this last age I mentioned this brother Brown says and the tragedy was even greater to think about when one realizes that this was not solely the work of heathen but many times it was caused by so-called Christians who felt that they did God a favor in Exterminating these loyal soldiers of the Cross who stood for the word and obedience to the holy spirit let me just throw this in as it comes to me don't ever be guilty of crucifying a brother many times we speak in anger or in haste or out of our emotions stop for a minute before we speak think for a minute before we speak forgive before we speak if you have completely forgiven before you speak you will never say something against someone you shouldn't forgive before we speak don't be guilty of being the ones that would bring persecution against those fighting the same fight we're fighting what you see here is the FAL false Vine lashing out at the True Vine false seed lashing out just like in Genesis where Cain lashed out at Abel and what it is is their worship is false and an example of true worship is placed in front of them and they're told this is what's right do this and you'll be accepted and instead of coming God's provided way they take the path of Cain Cain worship and they go the path of Cain and that is murder why well we dealt with a little bit of this on Sunday it's because their father was a murderer from the beginning they can't help but manifest what seed is within them amen verse 12 the salutation Revelations 2:12 and to the angel of the church in pergamus right these things saith he which hath a sharp sword with two edges I like to focus on that saith he who has the sharp sword with two edges key word there he let's find out who he is brother Bram tells us that this is just a further Revelation talking about Jesus of his godhead set forth by his association with the sharp two-edged sword which is we all should know the word of God so brother brandham says it's just a further it is a further revelation of his godhead set forth by his Association with the sharp two-edged sword which is the word of God so what is his association with it what is Jesus association with the word of God let's look at these scriptures and it'll tell us Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword so we find it right there we know that the two-edged sword that he's holding is the word of God Ephesians 6:17 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Revelation 19:15 and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword so we're starting to see an association here says in Revelation 19:13 and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood in his name is called the word of God John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and 1 John 5:7 says for there are three now this one just blows it all open if you're trying to figure out what are you saying what's the word who's the word for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one so just substitute it for what you normally hear there normally you would hear what the Father the and the Holy Ghost so who is the word Jesus he is the word brother Brown says now we can see his association with the word he is the word that is who he is the word is his name there in John 1 where it says in the beginning was the word the actual root for that is logos which means thought or concept and then brother brandham says it has a dual meaning which is thought and speech and remember we talked about this once again on Sunday a word is a thought expressed so what John says here in chapter one is is actually awesome he says that the concept of God the concept of God was expressed in Jesus that which had only men had thought about or had a concept of was now expressed in Jesus amen the expressed image of God brother Brown says God became expressed in the person of Jesus Christ Jesus was the expressed image of God again in John 1:14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the very substance of God was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and as you think on that it's almost overwhelming when you think that the god that spoke worlds into existence the very God of creation the the god that scribes had written about the God that prophets had prophesized of was now standing there on the earth among men in a flesh body just like this right here expressing God to man manifesting God to man not God to man but man to man think about it like that you could handle him you could touch him you could see him he felt your infirmities he was here expressing God the fullness of God to man in a flesh body how how much of God all that God was he poured into Christ the whole thing before only Express in a cloud only expressed in a pillar of fire but now declared expressed manifested Emmanuel God With Us brother Brown says that is what the Living Word The Living Word Jesus did he brought God to us for he was God Amen John 14:10 says believest Thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works brother Bram says here it is most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in the son was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works that is is exactly what we have been teaching all along now watch he's going to go into some things here that that that people like to latch on to as reasons why you know the works don't matter and the experience don't matter and things like that but but if you'll keep following the thought he brings it all back around to this very quote right here he says when the bride will get back to being a word bride oh we're all about the word it's word word word I agree 100% so let's read the quote together since we're all agree she will produce the very works that Jesus produced the word is God the spirit is God they are all one one cannot work apart from the other then quit trying to separate the two quit trying to pull them apart I tell you the elect won't receive a dead word the elect won't Won Won won't fall for a word that doesn't have life in it because she knows we know the elect knows that that if we're truly back to the word if we are truly focused on the word we're focused on the word we're focused on the word then the works must be there yesly you can't separate the two and way one cannot work apart from the other and I and I looked at that today and I dwelled on that and thought about it I thought how confused does does one have to be to hear Ministry preach the supernatural to hear Ministry preach about healings and miracles to preach signs and wonders to preach about gifts operating and that the shout of the king supposed to be in the count in the camp and then that person say well y'all are focusing too much on that and not on the word that's a confused person when those things are the very things that the word produces so what I'm trying to say is and I may say it again if you're not producing that it's proof that you're not truly focused on the word your source is contaminated you're not drinking from the Eternal perfect Source like we talked about on Sunday but a contaminated Source will separate it and you'll have a dead word well let's keep things in balance that has become a buzzword for let's keep things dead you know I told somebody just yesterday in conversation a group of us were talking and I said you know I understand that our balance and God's balance are two different things when we think balance we think like 50/50 it's balance but God's balance is whatever is needed it may however he wants it that's balance but if we're just going to look at it from the way we think about balance we could preach nothing but the moving of the spirit from now in the next 25 years and we would never balance out all the dead cold formal teachings that we've been having for the last couple decades just to try to bring things Back in Balance they've been so out of balance for so long we we do need balance that's the truth we need to bring it balance to all the dead cold formal ritualistic teachings that's been going on forever and ever to where we ended up with churches full of cold dead formal Christians sitting on the Pew with no life in them we need to balance that out we need the fire of God to come and Purge it and balancing out to where we got a people on fire for God Walking with God expressing God manifesting God the very image of God manifested again and [Applause] abroad but too many of us are manifesting Church word word word yes yes yes I don't know anyone who disagrees with that but what you're saying is not true because if your focus was on the word you're going to produce the works of that word The Works of John 14:12 The Works that Jesus produced brother Brown says the word always comes to the truly spirit filled I want you to stay close with this for a little bit that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost that is what Jesus said would be the evidence so let's look at this for a moment the spirit and the word John 14:16 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever so he's talking about the Holy Ghost even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive so just hold that for a second as we go to the as we go to the next one but he says here the world cannot receive the spirit of Truth then what is truth John 17:17 sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth John 8:43 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word so they can't receive the Holy Ghost we saw that in in chapter 14:1 17 they can't it says the world can't receive it and in John 8:43 they can't receive the word why not why couldn't they receive one and not the other because they're the same thing they are the same thing watch this now John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth the word the Holy Ghost is come he will guide you into to all truth so let's just stop and let's just put this together like like a basic equation if you have the Holy Ghost can you walk and live in error doesn't mean you'll never mess up but what's he going to do he's going to guide you back into all truth you're going to be in the truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so the spirit of truth here the word is going to guide you into all truth in other words all the word which in this day there's only one place where you can find all the word that's the message of the hour so what's this saying let's put it in PL plain English you cannot be a word rejector and claim that you have the Holy Ghost you cannot look to a sign or a gift as the evidence and then parts of the word and claim to be spirit filled that's what Pentecost did that was the error of Pentecost it's not that they accepted the gifts they were supposed to accept the gifts it was the restoration of the gifts is that they then rejected the word and claimed that they had the the the the authentic Holy Ghost they denied the word they claimed to have the Holy Ghost yes they had been anointed sure the spirit of God had moved on them and amongst them absolutely all right but the rejection of the word proved that they were not the spoken word seed bride how can the spoken word bride reject the word it proved that they were not the original they didn't have the life in them it had passed through them brother Bram says here I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues now I I want everyone to focus here because I believe that you know and if you that we believe in speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing and if you're a student of the message at all you'll know that brother brownon believed in it too but he's making it very clear so there's no confusion young people I want you to to to understand this very clear the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost he says Jesus did not say the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age in other words what he's saying here is the Holy Ghost in a person cannot feed on Creeds and dogmas it can't feed on partial truths and denominational ideas the Holy Ghost will be identified with the light of the day it'll call you out of Darkness it'll bring you to the truth every single time and with the spirit of God in you you can't help but see the the truth for your day because he is the spirit of Truth he says have you noticed in Revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that Hearth say come see the bride speaks the same word as the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit in every Church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true true Christians took the word for their age that's what it says in John 8:47 and he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God when you can't receive truth it shows you are not of God now I want to notice I I want you to notice I want to stop before we run off into easy believism and say well all you got to do is be in the message and that's proof you got the Holy Ghost that's not what he's saying it's kind of like paying ties don't make you a Christian but Christians will pay tith being in the message don't make you filled with the Holy Ghost but if you're filled with the Holy Ghost you'll be in the message do you understand that it it's not you you if you have the Holy Ghost you will be in the truth you will be in the message if you have the spirit you will hear the word but that doesn't mean if you in the message you have the Holy Ghost if you truly have the Holy Ghost and you have that word that life living on the inside of you it will produce a life to back up your claim be being in the uh in the message is more than just admitting that the message is Right coming to the word is more than just seeing that it's true Nic Nicodemus knew that it was true he knew and he said that they all knew they all knew the message was right did that make them all saved now they crucified Jesus knowing that the message was the truth he said we all know you come from God in other words yeah I see that the message is right that didn't mean they were saved and had the Holy Ghost far from it but it's when you allow the word or the message or the truth of the day to change your life there's many of people that sit right in the water and rot they'll sit right there and rot there's many that do that they'll listen to the truth and rot but when the spirit is there they'll receive that word and the evidence of it will be a changed life that's the evidence of it brother brandham says he talks about tongues and other gifts are manifestations he says they're not signs that you have the Holy Ghost no just because some people will take that and go see that's why we don't need it that's not what he says he makes it very clear let's just keep going he says why isn't the manifestation an Evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost because you surely could not manifest the Holy Ghost unless you were truly Spirit-filled he asking a question and then he says you know I hate to say this because I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings he says but you can manifest the Holy Ghost without having he says you can have manifestations of the Holy Ghost without being spirit filled he says so where is manifestation as an Evidence it isn't there if you are truly filled with the spirit of God you will have the evidence of the word in your life now we'll find what is the evidence of the word in your life and we'll get to that but talking about manifestations and being the the the evidence of the Holy Ghost he goes through several examples he points back to balum and he says balum was religious and he worshiped God he said in talking about manifestations he says he says the spirit of God manifested through him we're talking about balum in one of the most beautiful portions of absolute accurate prophecy the world has ever seen but his sure wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost now I understand that was before that it was given but that's how brother brownon would describe it he he wasn't he wasn't seed he says now then what do you think of caiaphus the high priest the ible says he prophesies the kind of death the Lord would die we all know there's no record of him being Spirit-filled and then he goes into the examples and starts talking about the two preachers there early on when he was first introduced to the Pentecostal people and he talks about how they were speaking with tongues and interpreting and and he wanted to know more about it so he came up and began to speak to them and he said one was a hypocrite and the other a genuine Christian he says here were two men one of which was a real believer and the other was a sinful impersonator yet both were manifesting gifts of the Spirit so so what you're saying brother Aaron is we don't want these manifestations of course we want these manifestations we don't want you to arrest your holy ghost on these Eternal manif on these manifestations we don't want you going I know I got it because I spoke in tongues I know I got it because the this thing swept over me and caused me to dance in the spirit no you don't know you got it you had a manifestation of the spirit the prophet's just saying don't rest your soul on a gift or a tongue or a shout or a dance that's it don't rest on them they're not the evidence of the Holy Ghost but what they are is evidence that the Holy Ghost is present and he is working in our midst who doesn't want that just a Ju Just you as an individual as a church we want those things it is evidence of God moving in our midst but as an individual you are not to rest your soul on that alone he says I will admit now pay attention because this the every one of these quotes are from the pergami and age in order okay I will admit that true manifestations is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing Mighty acts I'll take it I want the Holy Spirit to do Mighty acts in evening like Tabernacle I want it to do in every church I want it in my home I want the Holy Spirit to do Mighty acts period so now that we've settled that but it is not the evidence of the individual being spirit filled even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations you speak in tongues all the time interpret all the time Dance all the time shout all the time run around the building all the time word of w knowledge you name them and not have the Holy Ghost he's being very clear about that now notice now notice cuz people like to hang on this first part but then focus on the second part Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word we're done never did I say Amen but I also say let's let's take all of it why because he knew that if the people got the word The Works would follow if people get the word The Works will follow that is Bible amen I I say I want the works here so that I know for sure that what I'm feeding on is the word it is so so he says you'll have the evidence of the word in your life is the evidence of the Holy Ghost then he comes and tells you what is the evidence that the word is there The Works Will Follow The Works will follow that is Bible no we don't chase after a gift no we don't look look look for tongues no we aren't sign Seekers but if you are in the word and the word in you come on now yes preach the word yes focus on the word yes emphasize the word because if that's truly what you're doing the spirit's going to move that's how it works if you're focused on the word and preaching the word the Miracles will take place the Devils will be cast out the Lost will be saved those with need the Holy Ghost will be filled with the Holy Ghost the shout of the king will be in the camp when you preach the word when you focus on the word all those things are going to follow and if they're not it's because you have departed from the word you so desperately claim to [Music] promote I'll be honest with you I'm ready for a lot of folks that claim to only focus on the word to actually start doing that because when they do look out it's going to break out in their Church they ain't going to be able to contain it they ain't going to know what's going on we were just focusing on the word I know that's what we've been doing for a while now we've been loving it we're focusing on the word we're focusing on the word and signs follow and the sick are healed and people speak in tongues and people get happy and there's emotion that goes with it because we see our name on the last book of life that was written there before the foundation of the world what are you so excited about the word why are y'all running around the church the word why are you so emotional the word it's what we focus [Applause] on I don't know why that's so small we got giant screens and it's still tiny it ain't little here so I don't know what happened anyway I'll read it to you if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word you're going to have to trust me that that's what it says welcome and receive the word how do you welcome the word by proper Church order by sitting very quiet and nodding which if I do it just right I can sleep and do it and people will never know that how do you welcome and receive the word you welcome it by how you respond to it there's a lot of places that the word isn't welcome and you can tell by the response to the word the next one says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst how many of you ever heard that quote before and I'll tell you this as you as you travel and get around what you'll find is it's a quote actually used to kind of suppress the moving of the spirit and the works and all those things are like well we have to be sufficiently impressed by the word in our midst it's about being sufficiently you know impressed or you know by by the word in our Ament we show how impressed we are by how we respond to it that shows you how impressed you are by the word the Pharisees were not impressed by the word in their midst so they put Jesus in a corner with dirty feet direct correlation if you're impressed by the word you will worship him you will praise him you will shout you will cry if you are sufficiently impressed by the word you won't have him stuck over in a corner but when you're not sufficiently impressed by the word you stick him there and then criticize everybody that washes his feet with their tears and dries it with their hair but that's okay I choose to be one of those that is impressed by the word and so it excites me I'm impressed by him so I worship him I'm impressed by him so I give him my everything it's the exact opposite of what people use that quote for you want God to move then welcome his word respond to his word worship accept it and see what begins to happen the last quote up there says if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the re revelation of the Living Word in their midst the power of God would not have faded as it did in those Dark Ages if the church back then would have held on to the revelation of what that it was a Living Word he said that it was life in it that signs followed that worship was supposed to be in spirit and in truth that it was more than just doctrines and forms and traditions if they would have fought for the moving of a living God he says the power of God would not have faded as it did in those Dark Ages there we go the acts of God in our midst brother Brown says and right today I love this this brought such joy to me when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without a doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again so if we've returned to the word what can we expect the wonderful works and the wonderful acts to be in our midst again if we have not returned the word then we can expect crickets but when you return to the word you have a right to expect the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God to move in our midst again he says whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into Fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God so much like him that the sick stay sick so much like him that the Lost day lost so much like him that sin goes unch in the church so much like him that we reject the gifts that he sent us so much like him that we don't want his Spirit moving amongst us can you imagine actually being so different from him that his presence doesn't bring emotion in your life being so different from him that a Revival in the church doesn't bring emotion but criticism that you can look at and criticize it because you're so different from him you don't recognize him so different from him and therefore you're not impressed with the word in your midst and you put him in the corner and criticize those that begin to worship and praise him not this bride no that's not how this bride's going to act she's going to be so much like him she's going to be a super Church a super race in His image an army that cannot be defeated an army that cannot be stopped an army that acts how he act when he was here when we meet a devil the devil's cast out when there's sickness we lay hands on the sick they shall recover there's still those filled with the Holy Ghost there's still those delivered from addiction there's those delivered from pornography there's those delivered from depression why his body's upon the Earth and she's so much like him she's doing exactly what he did when he was here why must we be like him so we can be United with him bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she is him doing his Works overcoming this world why because we're impressed with the word and we've accepted it and we're allowing it to do its work in US those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time brother Joe we're going to finish this you can't do away with the works or you've done away with the word there's works for us to do the same works if you do away with that you do away with John 1412 and so many other scriptures there's works that we have to do Revelations 2: 13 we're bring bringing this down we're getting close to the end says I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where in Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth speaking of works here he says I Know Thy Works brother Bram says these are the identical words uttered to each of the seven Messengers relative to the people of God in each age as they are spoken to the two Vines the true and false they will bring joy and gladness to the hearts of one group but they ought to strike fear strike Terror in the hearts of the other other yes it's true that we're saved by grace and not of Works we're saved by grace we're not saved by works but true salvation will bring to pass works or deeds that are pleasing to God and he says I Know Thy works 1 John 3:7 says little children let no man deceive you he that doeth that means worketh righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous brother Brown says if this verse means anything at all it means that what a man does he is Matthew 12:33 says either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit you can't do away with the works he says oh Generation of Vipers how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart speaketh the mouth he says I Know Thy works if a man fears if you're sitting here today and this is where you're at if a man fears that he might not please God then let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he will hear those words well done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of God in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of Praise he says if a man wants to know how he's making out let him do as James suggested look into the mirror of God's word he goes on to say difficult though it was at times to serve the Lord yet they served him and worshiped him in spirit and in truth but with the false Vine it was not so alas they had repudiated the life that is built upon the word and we're now going further and further away from the truth how it must have pleased God in this age of persecution in this age where they were being killed and murdered and slaughtered that despite all that and despite the persecution there was an elect group that wouldn't back down that were still holding on to the truth and still pressing on still letting the word live in their hearts live in their lives and their Works indicated that this was the truth he he goes on to say in this verse that thou holdest my name fast to whom can we go thou alone Hast the words of eternal life they held fast then they were holding fast now but not with fatalistic dread as men who live out bar and lives they were holding fast in his strength in the Assurance of the spirit that they were one in him they knew and they loved that name and they knew it was above every other name there their knees had bowed to that name their tongues had confessed to it whatsoever they did they did it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and why is he why why is Jesus pointing this out as he's speaking here thou holdest fast my name because in this time the name of Jesus was being pushed completely aside it was being pushed aside in titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost had completely taken over the church the the so-called church was drying up and embracing the Trinity Doctrine and yet there was somebody that was still going to know we're going to baptize in the name of Jesus we're going to pray in the name of Jesus we're going to believe in the name of Jesus we're going to stand on the name of Jesus we know Salvation comes in the name of Jesus and he's saying thou held fast my name you kept holding on to my name when others cast it aside but you still held on still on that he says with so many dishonoring God turning him into three gods and changing his gracious name to titles one would would wonder I love this so much he says one would wonder if the signs and wonders that attend such a great name would still be visited amongst the people indeed those signs were mightily and wonderfully manifested though certainly not in the false Vine men like Martin were greatly used and God bore them witness both by signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost that name was still effectual as it always has been and ever will be where the Saints honor him through word and faith I say tonight the name of Jesus is still as effectual as it's ever been it's still heals it still delivers it'll still fill you with the Holy Ghost in places where his name is honored and lifted up there are still signs there are still wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost anywhere Saints honor him anywhere that people are sufficiently impressed with the word that's why he moves here that's why he moves in Virginia that's why he moves in Tennessee and Arkansas and Europe and everywhere else it's a word Revival people who are sufficiently impressed with the word and that word brings life he says Thou Hast not denied my faith acts 3:16 Peter is here is describing the Miracle at the gate called beautiful and he says in his name he's telling them how it happened through faith in his name so and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see and know yay the faith which is by him hath given him the man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all notice Peter did not claim it was his own human Faith any more than he claimed it was his own own name what was it he said it was the name of Jesus and he used the faith that Jesus gives to perform that Miracle what's it say in Revelation 2:13 I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith it's not your faith says Thou Hast not denied my faith it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he made that he had given to Believers listen your faith isn't weak oh I I don't know about my faith I don't know if I got enough Faith to be healed I don't know if I got enough faith for a Rapture I I think the faith that he gave you which is his faith is going to be exactly what you have need of just start putting trust in the fact that it ain't even your faith don't even just start casting down your doubts and start realizing he gave me a Measure of Faith it's his faith that's going to take me out of here it's his faith that's going to change my body it's his faith that's going to take me in a Rapture he knew you didn't have enough Faith so he supplied the faith he gave you exactly what you have need of he says and today's church is filled with mental believers who endorse the Virgin birth the shed blood going to church taking communion those are all great things he just described all of us I hope up until this point but then he says and are not reborn at all even so in that third age was the same problem human Faith wasn't enough then and it's not enough now it takes the very faith of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with hands he says it wasn't enough then and it's not enough now this was a living faith what Paul say I live by the faith he say in the Son of God he said of the Son of God he didn't say in he said of so these people weren't looking to their Church they weren't looking to man's ideas but God said you have not denied his faith my faith and they knew knew that it was only through his faith that they were saved only through his faith were they healed only in their in his faith could they be delivered as we come to this last slide now the musicians can come you can stand to your feet with me as we look at this the last part of that verse was about Antipas my faithful martyr brother brandham says there is no other record in the word or any profane history concerning this brother but surely there need not be it is more than enough that he was forn and known of the Lord he says full of the Holy Ghost and Faith as was Stephen he respected no one he feared no one and when death was pronounced upon all who would take that name and walk in the faith of Jesus Christ he took his stand with those who would not turn back like those in that age I say hold on to the faith lift up the name of Jesus manifest The Works of Christ and right now determine in yourself like Antipas I will not turn back I don't need people to know my name I don't care if anybody ever knows my name but let it be said that I held the faith that I lifted up the name of Jesus and that I never would turn back even like Tabernacle Don't Turn back we're too close to turn back now we're right at the blending of Time and Eternity they stood they made it every age has had an elect stand and make it I'm looking at a group that's going to stand and that's going to make it amen amen let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord how grateful we are Lord that it's your faith that you've provided to give us the strength to stand in this day Lord may we have the courage to stand no matter what anyone says no matter what criticism comes Lord as a matter of fact help us to never criticize eyes back help us Lord within ourselves Lord like like Steven would say Lord to forgive them Lord as Jesus said Lord forgive them they don't know what they're doing Lord I pray that each one that's drifted away and and Lord those that have drifted away from the new birth and drifted away from you Lord may may a sweet go out tonight and begin to call your elect back home Lord we ain't giving up on one of them Lord because you promised that you wern't going to lose one Lord and I'm standing here not in my own faith but in the faith of the Son of God saying our children are coming back our brothers and sisters are coming coming back our sons and daughters Lord wherever they may be wherever they've been scattered throughout the world lord they're coming back Lord because you're not going to lose one there's going to be a people who hold on to the faith who lift up the name of Jesus Lord in a Dying World lifting up all kind of other gods there is but one God to the true elect And We Worship You
