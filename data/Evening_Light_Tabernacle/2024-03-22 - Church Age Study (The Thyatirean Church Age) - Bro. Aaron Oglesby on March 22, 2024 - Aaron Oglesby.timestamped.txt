[11:05] Jesus name we pray amen
[11:08] amen amen while you remain standing
[11:11] we're going to go ahead and and we're
[11:13] going to read from the book of
[11:14] Revelation the the second
[11:17] chapter tonight we're we're starting a
[11:19] new church age uh we are going to be
[11:22] studying the th tyan age it's the fourth
[11:25] Church age and we're going to study um a
[11:29] portion of that tonight so if you have
[11:32] your Bibles we're going to start in
[11:33] Revelation 2 and the the 18th verse it's
[11:37] so good to have all the young people out
[11:39] tonight and all those others all you
[11:41] others that have come out to support
[11:42] we're so thankful for your support
[11:44] tonight to have you
[11:50] here and it says in verse 18 and unto
[11:54] the angel of the church and thy Tower
[11:57] write these things saith
[11:59] the Son of God who hath his eyes like
[12:02] unto a flame of fire and his feet are
[12:04] like fine brass I Know Thy works and
[12:07] charity and service and faith and thy
[12:10] patience and thy works and the last to
[12:13] be more than the first now notice there
[12:15] at the beginning of verse 19 that this
[12:17] isn't a typo it says I Know Thy works
[12:20] then it list and charity and service and
[12:22] faith and thy patience and then it says
[12:24] again and thy works and the last to be
[12:28] more than the first we'll get to that
[12:29] later on it says not withstanding I have
[12:32] a few things against thee because thou
[12:34] sufferest that woman Jezebel which
[12:37] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[12:39] and to seduce my servants to commit
[12:42] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[12:45] unto idols and I gave her space to
[12:48] repent for her fornication and she
[12:51] repented not
[12:53] behold I will cast her into a bed and
[12:57] them that commit adultery with her into
[13:00] Great Tribulation except they repent of
[13:03] their deeds and I will kill her children
[13:06] with death and all the churches shall
[13:08] know that I am he which SE searches the
[13:11] Reigns of the hearts and I will give
[13:13] unto every one of you according to your
[13:15] works but unto you I say and unto the
[13:18] rest of thy Tara as many as have not
[13:21] this Doctrine in which have not known
[13:23] the depths of Satan as they speak I will
[13:26] put upon you none other burden
[13:31] but that which ye have already hold fast
[13:34] till I come and he that overcometh and
[13:36] keepeth my Works unto unto the end to
[13:40] him will I give power over the Nations
[13:43] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[13:45] iron as the vessels of a Potter shall
[13:48] they be broken to Shivers even as I
[13:50] received of my father and I will give
[13:52] him the morning star and he that hath an
[13:56] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[13:58] unto the churches amen may the Lord add
[14:01] His blessings to the word as you have
[14:02] your seats
[14:08] tonight
[14:13] amen give me just a
[14:17] moment so we are studying the the the
[14:20] fourth age the th Ty and Age and and
[14:23] we've always put a map up here so that
[14:25] you could place it in relation to the
[14:27] others we started here at at Ephesus and
[14:30] then we went to Smyrna and pergamus and
[14:33] now we've moved over just to the east to
[14:35] thara thar the age brother Brandon puts
[14:38] it as lasting from about 606 to
[14:42] 1520 ad and he says it it is the longest
[14:46] of of all the ages and we have just a
[14:48] few pictures here showing some of the
[14:51] surviving streets that the way it would
[14:54] look today this is uh what's left of of
[14:57] some of the streets there's not much of
[14:58] the this city left uh but there is there
[15:01] are a few um there are a few things
[15:04] there a few um ruins as it were is
[15:08] brother Bram says it's the least
[15:09] noteworthy of the Seven Cities of
[15:13] Revelation uh it was well off
[15:16] financially he talks about how there was
[15:18] a it was surrounded by rivers and there
[15:20] was lots of rivers there but but that
[15:22] all the rivers were full of leeches and
[15:24] so they were they weren't any good but
[15:26] but the city itself was well off
[15:28] financially and and it had a lot of
[15:29] different guilds uh or we might would
[15:32] use the word today unions and those
[15:34] unions there were there were Potters
[15:36] there were Tanners there were Weavers um
[15:39] Dyers and and robe makers there there's
[15:42] one that you've probably heard of in the
[15:44] Bible known as um known as Lydia and and
[15:47] Lydia in the Bible is called the seller
[15:50] of purple and and she was from this city
[15:53] it tells us in Acts 16 and in chapter 14
[15:56] it says and a certain woman named LD
[15:59] a Sellar of purple of the city of thara
[16:03] which worshiped God heard us whose heart
[16:06] the L the Lord opened that she attended
[16:09] unto the things which were spoken of
[16:11] Paul and Lydia was actually Paul's first
[16:15] European convert now now as we know as
[16:18] we go into this each city is chosen by
[16:22] the spirit and it's
[16:24] chosen uh that City because the city has
[16:28] the the spirit spiritual elements of the
[16:30] age that it represents so so remember
[16:33] we're not studying a city we're studying
[16:35] an age but the city represents that age
[16:38] because of the spiritual elements that
[16:41] are there so so the spirit sees the
[16:43] spiritual condition of a certain city
[16:45] and then calls it out as the
[16:47] representation of a future age amen so
[16:51] in this case thara had the spiritual
[16:55] elements that would match those in the
[16:58] four
[16:59] age in tharra they worshiped Apollo
[17:03] Apollo Tyrus Apollo was the son God and
[17:07] he was next in power to his father who
[17:11] was Zeus he's known as the averter of
[17:14] evil he presided over religious law and
[17:17] also over atonement and brother brandham
[17:20] says he communicated his knowledge of
[17:22] the future and his father's will to men
[17:26] through the prophets and the or oracles
[17:30] so so we see right here at the very
[17:31] beginning that this city is is joined
[17:34] together with this the emperor worship
[17:37] cult that we covered last time and they
[17:39] have this fatherson element to their
[17:42] religion all right and and and that
[17:44] aligns perfectly with Rome's Trinity
[17:47] that by now has a complete strangle hold
[17:50] on all of Christianity the the religion
[17:53] of the city in tatara was was extremely
[17:57] brother Bram says remarkably powerful
[18:00] and it wasn't so much that it was
[18:01] powerful because of what It produced but
[18:03] it was powerful because if you'll
[18:05] remember just a moment ago we mentioned
[18:07] all the the trade uh guilds or the
[18:10] unions of potters and Tanners and
[18:13] Weavers and dyes and Rob makers in order
[18:16] to make your living operating in one of
[18:19] these guilds you had to belong to the
[18:22] temple worship of Apollo so if you
[18:25] didn't belong to their religion and you
[18:27] didn't belong to their Temple and you
[18:29] didn't accept the idols that they
[18:30] worshiped you weren't allowed to make a
[18:34] living you weren't allowed to have a job
[18:36] there within the city it sounds very
[18:39] familiar to those who don't have the
[18:41] mark of the beast are not going to be
[18:42] able to buy and sell so it's is it's
[18:45] using church and state and strong arming
[18:47] people into this false
[18:51] religion now as we as we go into this
[18:54] next part
[18:55] remember that the churches in the Bible
[18:58] that the Church in the Bible is given
[19:00] feminine
[19:01] characteristics and women in the Bible
[19:04] can be the type of of all things vulgar
[19:07] and foul but they can also be the type
[19:10] of all things clean and
[19:12] beautiful so so we we see this with the
[19:15] false church it's called the Great
[19:18] but then you find the True Vine is
[19:20] called the bride the Lamb's wife so the
[19:23] church is a woman false and true the
[19:27] church is a woman and amen and and so
[19:31] the name thara means dominating
[19:36] female we have none of those here
[19:38] tonight
[19:39] right
[19:42] good dominating female thus this age is
[19:46] characterized by a dominant force a
[19:50] force that ruthlessly invades all
[19:53] conquers all and despotically controls
[19:57] so if it's a dominating force and it
[19:59] means dominating female we know it's
[20:02] referencing a church but it's not
[20:06] referencing the true church it's
[20:08] referencing the false Vine Church I I if
[20:12] we can remember back to the Ephesian age
[20:14] and I want to go back there just a
[20:16] minute and I pulled something from there
[20:18] that the goddess in their Temple was
[20:20] shown as a wooden figure with iron bars
[20:23] for arms and brother Bram says she was
[20:25] simply an almost shapeless female figure
[20:28] that finally sunk into the block of wood
[20:31] from which she was carved and her two
[20:33] arms were formed of two simple bars of
[20:37] iron how perfectly this depicts the
[20:40] spirit of antichrist loosed in the first
[20:43] age there he was loosed in the midst of
[20:45] the people and yet took no shape as to
[20:48] alarm the people yet the two arms of
[20:51] iron bars showed that it was his intent
[20:54] to crush the work of God as he made his
[20:57] inroads listen it don't the devil don't
[21:00] always come out like brother Bram says
[21:02] here he he says it took no shape to
[21:04] alarm the people so so young people
[21:07] listen sometimes uh your parents may
[21:09] tell you you know don't do these things
[21:11] or the minister may say don't do these
[21:12] things and you look at it and go but
[21:14] what's the big deal I don't see the
[21:16] issue because it hasn't taken a shape
[21:18] yet to alarm you but your parents
[21:21] understand and the ministry understands
[21:23] that that there's things out there that
[21:25] comes in this way and this way and it
[21:26] may not look bad right now but but look
[21:28] at what it may become down the road and
[21:31] you have to trust the the leadership
[21:34] that's been placed in your life to
[21:35] protect you from those things but he
[21:38] says here these two arms of of iron bars
[21:41] showed that it was the intent to crush
[21:44] the work of God so now from the first
[21:47] age this church has grown in power to
[21:50] where she now rules with an iron
[21:55] disposition now as we as as we look at
[21:58] what kind of a disposition and nature
[22:01] that a woman should exhibit remember
[22:04] that it does not that it does relate to
[22:07] the Natural and it should be applied
[22:11] there um in the husband and wife
[22:14] relationship but also we're talking
[22:16] about the church and Christ and a
[22:19] spiritual
[22:21] relationship a woman is not supposed to
[22:24] have an iron
[22:27] disposition she is is to be
[22:29] meek gentle easily LED according to the
[22:34] scripture the woman is to be submissive
[22:36] to the man now I do want to stop and say
[22:39] this there's a lot of men that have some
[22:41] really twisted ideas about what
[22:43] submissive
[22:45] means all right it don't it don't mean
[22:48] that you get to rule over a woman with
[22:50] brute force it don't mean that you're
[22:52] going to do what I say and that it
[22:54] there's a scriptural
[22:57] submission that there there there it's
[22:59] in the scripture how how the man is to
[23:01] be the head of the household and the
[23:02] woman is is supposed to follow but but
[23:05] it also there supposed to follow you as
[23:07] you follow
[23:09] Christ and Christ isn't standing there
[23:12] saying you're going to do this or
[23:15] else that's that's not how this works
[23:17] but but but the church is to be
[23:20] submissive to God she is to be led by
[23:25] him brother Brown says women a woman who
[23:28] is truly female all female will be of
[23:31] that disposition not a
[23:34] doormat this isn't about M making
[23:36] someone a
[23:38] doormat it's something that brother Tim
[23:40] has always said in in marriage
[23:42] ceremonies that that that God took a rib
[23:45] from Adam something close to his heart
[23:49] not from his feet for him to tr over her
[23:53] and not from his head for her to rule
[23:55] over him but from the heart says not ad
[23:58] door door mat no real male makes a
[24:01] female a
[24:04] doormat but she will want to be under
[24:07] Authority and not rule over the male for
[24:11] he is the head of the house now if she
[24:15] breaks that image that God made for her
[24:18] she is
[24:21] perverted okay that's that's why it
[24:23] matters how you dress that's why it
[24:25] matters how you wear your hair that's
[24:27] why we don't uh wear clothes that
[24:30] pertain to a man because when a woman
[24:32] does those things she's invading into
[24:34] man's domain taking Authority and
[24:37] therefore according to the word it's a
[24:40] perversion but that goes for the men as
[24:42] well this isn't just a woman thing men
[24:45] you wear clothes that pertain to a woman
[24:48] you dress like a woman you act like a
[24:51] woman wear your hair like a woman let a
[24:53] woman run over you you are
[24:55] perverted this isn't a one-side preach
[24:58] at the women thing this gospel is for
[25:00] men and women God placed Us in certain
[25:04] positions and it's his order it's not
[25:07] for us to question that order it's for
[25:09] us to line up to that order it's for us
[25:12] to come into submission to that order
[25:15] prophet of God says being a dominating
[25:18] female is Antichrist and the seeds of
[25:21] the Roman Catholic Church are in her
[25:23] though she may deny this ever so vinant
[25:26] but when it comes to the word let God be
[25:30] true and every man's word a lie amen let
[25:35] God's word be true and every man's word
[25:38] a lie so even in like Tabernacle young
[25:41] people we are to be submissive to the
[25:45] word it is what supposed we're not
[25:47] supposed to argue with it well I don't
[25:49] understand we're not to be dominating
[25:51] the word says it that's what we come
[25:54] subject to not to debate it not to try
[25:57] to overrule it
[25:59] but we're supposed to come subject to it
[26:01] we're not to have an iron dis
[26:03] disposition of well nobody's going to
[26:05] tell me what to do nobody's going to run
[26:08] my life that's not the right
[26:10] attitude and what we see here is the
[26:13] dominating female in the fourth age is
[26:15] the Roman Catholic church and she
[26:18] doesn't care what his word says she
[26:21] still doesn't care what his word says
[26:24] she's an independent liberated female
[26:26] doing what she pleases
[26:28] but not the True Vine not the Bride of
[26:31] Jesus Christ we love his every word we
[26:35] long to to for his approval we care what
[26:38] the bridegroom thinks we come subject
[26:40] and that is our disposition we we can't
[26:43] young people identify with that that
[26:46] dominating Spirit of the church who does
[26:48] as she
[26:50] pleases that can't that can't be us and
[26:52] and and they lay aside the word here and
[26:54] run over the word there and and cast
[26:57] aside the word every place that it
[26:59] displeases her but that woman is drunk
[27:02] on the blood of the Saints she is
[27:05] Mystery Babylon and an Abomination
[27:07] before God but the bride but the bride
[27:11] that's who we're talking about this is
[27:13] the other Church the Bride of Jesus
[27:15] Christ she is submissive to her head she
[27:18] allows the word to judge her listen what
[27:21] what what is the house of God it's the
[27:23] beginning of judgment we don't come here
[27:25] to have our ears tickled and leave oh I
[27:28] sometimes that happens sometimes you get
[27:29] built up built up but the word judges us
[27:33] and because we're not of that Spirit of
[27:35] dominating we take it and we say yes
[27:37] Lord change my life to match that word
[27:41] we have come subject to the word and
[27:44] because of that the Bride of Jesus
[27:46] Christ is exalted to heaven and shares
[27:49] the very Throne of God as his
[27:55] Queen and in this th Ty in church age
[27:59] she we're talking about churches not
[28:01] people
[28:03] here is a dominating female she is
[28:06] Mystery Babylon she is the great
[28:09] she is Jezebel the false prophetess why
[28:13] because the true female is submissive to
[28:15] God Christ is her head she has no word
[28:19] but his no thoughts but his no
[28:21] leadership but his but what about this
[28:25] church talking about the false one she
[28:28] is has cast out the word destroyed the
[28:30] Bibles and worthy essays of The Godly
[28:33] she has slain those who would preach the
[28:37] truth so so in this age not only has she
[28:40] been seduced but now she is seducing
[28:45] others brother brandom actually goes so
[28:47] far as to say she is the Bride of Satan
[28:51] and for 900 years during the length of
[28:53] this church age she destroys all who
[28:55] dare to stand in her way truth is is
[28:58] almost completely gone there's a reason
[29:00] this is known as the Dark
[29:02] Ages the light had gone out not even not
[29:06] just Gospel Light but but even the
[29:08] sciences and the things of that nature
[29:10] it had all been crushed out light was
[29:12] gone it was the Dark Ages she dominated
[29:17] kingdoms she dominated the world he says
[29:20] there was a little group there was a
[29:23] little group who belonged to God and
[29:25] their citizenship was in heaven and them
[29:29] she could not destroy God kept his
[29:32] little flock they could not be destroyed
[29:35] listen the seed couldn't be destroyed
[29:37] then and that seed can't be destroyed
[29:39] today it may be the most wicked age it
[29:42] may be the darkest age it may be the
[29:44] worst evil time we've ever come in but
[29:47] there is still a little flock standing
[29:49] on the earth to day that will not bow
[29:51] they will not Bend they will not give in
[29:53] to to what's popular or what's modern
[29:56] but what are we subject to we're subject
[29:58] subject to the word and because of that
[30:00] his hand is Upon Our Lives listen people
[30:03] are giving their mind to the Beast
[30:05] people are giving their hearts to the
[30:06] beast but there's a people today that
[30:08] are given their minds and their hearts
[30:10] have been turned back to the word and
[30:13] that's where we stand that and listen it
[30:15] may be dark but there is a light shining
[30:18] it may be dark but there's a people
[30:20] standing saying there is a truth there
[30:22] is a baptism of the Holy Ghost there is
[30:24] salvation there is a God and this God
[30:27] cares how we live amen there's a people
[30:31] whose hearts and Minds have been turned
[30:35] back now as we began studying these ages
[30:39] we we know that there was a key that
[30:41] brother Bram said he used to to know the
[30:45] messengers of each age and he says the
[30:46] key given to me of the Lord whereby I
[30:50] was able to determine the messenger for
[30:52] each age is a most scriptural one in
[30:57] fact it might be called the Keystone of
[30:59] the Bible it is the Revelation that God
[31:02] never
[31:04] changes and that his ways are as
[31:06] unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 138 it
[31:10] says Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[31:12] today and forever what he did at the
[31:15] first he will have to keep on doing
[31:17] until it is done for the last time there
[31:21] will never be a change apply that to the
[31:24] church ages he says the kind of man that
[31:27] God chose for the first age and how God
[31:30] manifested in that man's Ministry is an
[31:33] example for all other ages what God did
[31:36] in the first church age is what he wants
[31:38] to do in all other
[31:41] ages so when brother brandham looks at
[31:43] this age he actually says that there
[31:45] were two men in this age whose Ministry
[31:48] stood this test he said one was St
[31:52] Patrick and the other St
[31:55] Columba he says but it was Colum
[31:58] who was the messenger of the age and and
[32:02] brother brandham takes a little time
[32:04] here in the midst of it to to battle
[32:06] against the idea that St Patrick was in
[32:09] any way part of the Catholic
[32:12] system and he comes in he say he says
[32:15] even though he wasn't the messenger he
[32:17] he he wants his name cleared of that he
[32:20] wants his name cleared as a real man of
[32:22] God who who stood for truth and who
[32:24] stood against what the church had become
[32:27] he says he had a wonderful Ministry full
[32:29] of signs and wonders and led thousands
[32:32] to the Lord there in Ireland he goes on
[32:34] to say at no time did he ever go to Rome
[32:38] nor at any time was he commissioned by
[32:41] Rome so he says that about St Patrick
[32:43] but he says St Columba was the
[32:47] messenger now Columba was born in
[32:50] Northern Ireland he was born to
[32:53] royalty and one of the things that that
[32:55] that says about him is he committed the
[32:57] the scripture to memory and and he went
[33:01] out spreading the gospel over o over
[33:04] today what we know as as Scotland now
[33:07] Columbus
[33:09] conversion when he was called into the
[33:11] ministry he was called by an audible
[33:13] voice and it said that after that
[33:16] nothing could stop him listen young
[33:19] people let that be your testimony today
[33:22] you've been called in this hour by a
[33:24] message you've heard a voice in this day
[33:27] call your name and call you and
[33:29] commission you to be the Overcomers of
[33:31] the last age and I say it ought to be
[33:33] the testimony that there's nothing that
[33:35] can stop us let Temptations arise let
[33:38] let lukewarmness come let let problems
[33:41] in the church come but there's a group
[33:42] who says nothing is going to stop me
[33:45] I've been called I've heard my name I've
[33:47] seen my name in the book and no matter
[33:49] who falls left Who falls right who falls
[33:51] away who quits I'm not going to be
[33:54] stopped because I've heard my name
[33:56] called amen
[33:59] just like The Messengers before him
[34:01] Columbus Ministry was was full of the
[34:05] supernatural so much so that many have
[34:08] claimed his ministry was right there
[34:10] next to the apostles brother brandham
[34:13] says this and I love this quote he says
[34:15] how we thank you for great St Paul of
[34:19] Ephesus how we thank you for irenius oh
[34:22] Lord irenius the great servant of yours
[34:25] and for St Martin and tonight for St
[34:28] Columba Lord how we thank you for these
[34:31] men in the midst of dark romanism
[34:34] paganism coming in the church they stood
[34:37] Gallant for the Pentecostal message and
[34:40] blessing and speaking in tongues and
[34:42] great signs and wonders and the healing
[34:45] of the sick and raising of the Dead
[34:47] listen once again I say that we should
[34:49] stand for the Pentecostal blessing for
[34:51] the Pentecostal message that God is
[34:53] still a supernatural God I mean the
[34:56] prophet of God stood there and said we
[34:57] thank you oh Lord that there were men
[35:00] who stood for the message of the
[35:02] supernatural I say there's still people
[35:04] standing for the message of the
[35:06] supernatural when to so many God is just
[35:08] a cold Creed or or something formal but
[35:11] we say today no he is aive he is well he
[35:14] is moving he is healing he is saving
[35:17] he's delivering he's still setting
[35:19] people free because he's a supernatural
[35:22] God and he's leading a supernatural
[35:26] people scholars in the earliest early
[35:29] 20th century would write about
[35:33] Columba this man not
[35:37] necessarily a skeptic but also not
[35:40] believing everything he' read says this
[35:43] but in whatever we may regard the
[35:46] Miracles attributed to
[35:48] Columba and they are very numerous they
[35:51] show the absolute faith that the people
[35:54] had in him they called him the angel of
[35:57] the Lord and realize that he lived on a
[36:01] higher plane than they
[36:04] did so Columbo would go about spreading
[36:07] the gospel and one of the ways that he
[36:08] would do this was he would send out
[36:11] teams of
[36:12] 12 and in the midst of those teams you
[36:15] would have some Carpenters some teachers
[36:18] some preachers and they would come and
[36:20] they would build a small town and they
[36:21] would enclose that town with a fence or
[36:23] a wall and here they would begin to
[36:26] teach and preach the gospel as more came
[36:28] in and more people came to these towns
[36:30] they would begin to train others to go
[36:33] out and do the exact same thing that
[36:35] they had done and they would move and
[36:37] build a little community and and allow
[36:39] the people to come to them and I love
[36:41] what brother Brown says about the way
[36:43] they did it and it's something we can
[36:44] take great note
[36:46] of he says instead of attacking other
[36:49] religions they taught the truth for they
[36:53] believed that the truth was weapon
[36:55] enough to accomplish the ends that God
[36:58] had in mind for them listen we don't
[37:01] have to attack everything and everybody
[37:03] all you got to do is just preach the
[37:04] truth just teach the truth now sometimes
[37:07] the truth may may seem like it's
[37:08] attacking if it's going against
[37:10] something that you believe but the truth
[37:12] is when it comes to the word of God let
[37:15] God's word be the truth and every man's
[37:17] word a lie but we don't have to go out
[37:20] of our way to slander this and attack
[37:22] this just preach the truth just live the
[37:26] truth brother Brown says that they were
[37:28] a free work moving under the message of
[37:30] the hour totally free from
[37:34] Rome the salutation we find in
[37:37] Revelation 2
[37:40] and8 says these things saith the Son of
[37:43] God who hath his eyes like unto a flame
[37:46] of fire and his feet are like fine
[37:50] brass notice it says these things saith
[37:55] the son of God the revelation of the
[37:59] godhead in this age to that age was that
[38:02] Jesus is the son of God and and brother
[38:06] Bram speaks about this part here in
[38:07] great detail how that in the flesh he
[38:10] was the son of man but now he's no
[38:12] longer in the flesh but he's back in the
[38:15] bosom of the father and he's risen and
[38:17] now we know him not in the flesh but we
[38:20] know him by the power of his
[38:22] resurrection and in this position of his
[38:25] mighty power he is above all all and he
[38:28] is over all he has conquered all and and
[38:32] and and because of this he alone
[38:34] deserves the praise he alone deserves
[38:37] all the glory and all the honor and he
[38:40] expects to be in full control and full
[38:43] leadership of his church that is his
[38:47] expectation he didn't conquer death Hell
[38:50] In The Grave Just to surrender the
[38:51] leadership of his church over to men he
[38:55] didn't come and take on flesh and fight
[38:57] all those battles and redeem mankind
[38:59] just to turn over that leadership to
[39:02] man but what is it that we see here in
[39:05] the fourth age that
[39:07] there the city of tharra is representing
[39:10] the fourth age what is it we see in
[39:12] tharra Apollo is being revered as the
[39:16] Son of
[39:17] God showing us that in the fourth age
[39:21] the church is giving the glory and the
[39:23] honor and the praise that belongs to the
[39:25] true Son of God to
[39:29] another the praise that's supposed to be
[39:31] going to Jesus is now going to another
[39:34] and the scripture says his eyes burn
[39:36] like unto a flame so the religion of the
[39:40] tharan
[39:41] age has elevated the pope to
[39:46] deity now if you don't believe that you
[39:48] can read the writings of Thomas aquinus
[39:52] where he says the pope seems to those
[39:54] who view him with the spiritual I to be
[39:58] not a man but a god there are no bounds
[40:03] to his
[40:04] authority he can declare to be right
[40:08] what he will and can take away from any
[40:11] their rights as he sees fit to doubt
[40:15] this Universal Power leads to being shut
[40:18] out from
[40:20] salvation now there's only salvation in
[40:23] one there's only salvation in Jesus
[40:26] Christ so what's happening here is is a
[40:29] man is being elevated to take the the
[40:32] glory and the honor and the power that
[40:34] belongs to Jesus and he's looking at it
[40:37] and his eyes are flaming I don't know
[40:40] what that means to you but it tells me
[40:41] he is extremely angry he's very angry
[40:45] the church is placing salvation in the
[40:47] hands of a man and not in Jesus Christ
[40:51] the scripture tells us in 1 Timothy 2:5
[40:54] for there is one God and one mediator
[40:57] between God and man the man Christ Jesus
[41:00] who gave himself a ransom for all I want
[41:03] to tell you tonight and remind you there
[41:05] is but one way to Salvation I am the way
[41:09] the truth the life no man cometh unto
[41:11] the father but by me there's no church
[41:14] no Prophet no preacher nobody that can
[41:16] give you salvation but the blood of the
[41:19] Lord Jesus Christ is where our Salvation
[41:22] lies he is the way he is the truth he's
[41:25] the life I want to encourage you toight
[41:27] if you haven't found your salvation in
[41:29] Jesus if you're still at that place get
[41:31] into Jesus tonight but don't I need to
[41:34] know about this and knowbody just fall
[41:36] in love with Jesus what do I need to do
[41:39] just ask Jesus for salvation you don't
[41:42] got to come to me you don't got to come
[41:44] to some man through some certain Church
[41:46] you just find Jesus he is the one he's
[41:50] the only one that can give you
[41:52] salvation brother Brown says no wonder
[41:55] the feet are like fine brass as he
[41:57] stands ready to trample into powder and
[42:01] dust the wicked kingdoms of this
[42:05] world so the false Vine has put the Pope
[42:08] in place of
[42:09] Jesus and they've established and
[42:12] enforced idol
[42:15] worship under Empress theod Empress
[42:18] Theodora alone from 1842 to
[42:23] 1867 over 100,000 saints were killed
[42:27] killed because they reputed the images
[42:29] of no
[42:31] value in other words they said those
[42:33] Idols aren't our
[42:34] Gods we don't have to bow to that that's
[42:37] that's not what the scripture says
[42:38] that's not what the word says and just
[42:40] for that stand they were
[42:44] slaughtered just in this short period of
[42:46] 25 years over a 100,000 are killed and
[42:50] yet just like in every age before the
[42:53] True Vine stood and just like in every
[42:56] age our God remain faithful to those who
[42:58] would stand the false Vine maybe has
[43:01] Cast Away his word the false Vine says
[43:03] it don't matter they rejected his
[43:05] leadership but the True Vine stands and
[43:08] to the True Vine he says fear not little
[43:10] flock it is your father's good pleasure
[43:13] to give you the kingdom and when I come
[43:15] with feet of brass and flaming eyes I
[43:18] will recompense judgment is mine I will
[43:21] repay saith the
[43:24] Lord comes to the eulogy re Revelation 2
[43:28] verse
[43:31] 19 he says I Know Thy works and charity
[43:36] and service and faith and thy patience
[43:40] and thy works and the last to be more
[43:44] than the
[43:45] first now he said this in every age and
[43:48] I'm going to slow down a little bit I've
[43:50] I was going pretty fast there for a
[43:52] while intentionally knowing we have
[43:53] other things to do but I've gotten far
[43:56] enough along I can slow
[43:58] down he says this to every age I Know
[44:01] Thy
[44:02] Works he says this in every Age and and
[44:06] works is something that Jesus spoke
[44:08] about even in his own Ministry when he
[44:11] said believe me for the very Works
[44:15] sake and I know and you know that we
[44:18] don't lay our faith in our works no man
[44:22] has done enough works or could ever do
[44:24] enough works to Merit salvation we don't
[44:27] lay our faith in works that's not where
[44:29] our faith lies but the life and Ministry
[44:33] of Christ produced Works did it
[44:37] not then what should happen with a
[44:40] believer that has the same life living
[44:43] on the inside of them if that life walk
[44:46] in the shores of Galilee produce works
[44:49] and we claim to have that same life
[44:51] living in us should it not produce the
[44:53] same thing so it's not where our faith
[44:56] lies but but what does Paul say there in
[44:59] in Ephesians he says for we are his
[45:03] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[45:07] good works which God hath before
[45:10] ordained that we should walk in them so
[45:14] so good works will not save you but they
[45:18] will come forth out of a saved
[45:21] life as fruit unto the Lord so just
[45:25] because you have good work Works doesn't
[45:27] mean you're saved but if you're saved
[45:30] you will have good
[45:31] works it will be the fruits of the
[45:34] spirit that manifest themselves that
[45:36] there should be a harvest of good works
[45:38] that come out of a Christian's life I'm
[45:41] G to say it again good works don't make
[45:43] you a
[45:44] Christian but a Christian will have good
[45:47] works but what what we see with Rome in
[45:50] this age is what God detests men doing
[45:55] evil works and claiming to be doing the
[45:58] will of
[46:01] God he
[46:03] says they were killing maming and doing
[46:07] all manner of evil in the name of the
[46:10] Lord they lived out lives exactly
[46:13] opposite to what the word teaches in
[46:17] that evil day those True Believers Shone
[46:20] like a light in a dark place as they
[46:24] continually did good
[46:27] listen I say the same is true to today
[46:30] today the real believer is shining in
[46:32] the darkness it's easier to shine today
[46:36] than it's ever been there may be a time
[46:39] if you go back a hundred years or 200
[46:41] years where a Christian could walk down
[46:43] the street and blend in with the
[46:45] unbelievers that's not the case anymore
[46:49] your life should be shining brighter
[46:51] than ever because it's darker than it's
[46:53] ever been don't be one running around
[46:56] living wrong and claiming to be right
[46:59] don't be blending in with the age
[47:02] because in this age it's never been so
[47:04] easy for your light to shine I I'll put
[47:07] it like this young people it should be
[47:09] obvious that you are a
[47:12] Christian it should be obvious your
[47:14] dress should declare that you are a
[47:16] Christian but let's take it beyond that
[47:19] because sometimes we get right there and
[47:20] we well I dress right okay your attitude
[47:25] should declare that you are a Christian
[47:29] the way you treat people should declare
[47:32] that you are a
[47:34] Christian your words should declare that
[47:38] you are a
[47:39] Christian listen I I I I I'm I'm not
[47:42] that guy that's going to come down on
[47:43] catchphrases and all this we all get
[47:45] caught up in we we say things that are
[47:47] common to our day okay but if your
[47:50] conversations sound exactly like the
[47:52] conversations of the world something is
[47:55] wrong right there should be a
[47:58] difference what you feed on should
[48:01] declare that you are a
[48:03] Christian and your good works should
[48:06] declare that you are a Christian God
[48:09] cares about our works he says to each
[48:13] age I Know Thy works it mattered enough
[48:16] for him to put it in the word I know
[48:19] what you're doing I know how you're
[48:21] living I know the the the testimony that
[48:24] your life is is saying out there to the
[48:26] world you're saying you're a Christian
[48:29] but I know your
[48:30] Works you're saying you've been changed
[48:33] but I know your works now in this part
[48:35] though he's saying it in a way that he
[48:37] is commending the Believers he's saying
[48:40] I know your Works you're doing a good
[48:42] job I see the life that you're living
[48:44] he's commending them for living changed
[48:47] lives and their works are testifying of
[48:50] a new life on the
[48:51] inside well I have the Holy Ghost
[48:53] brother Aaron does the way you treat
[48:56] people declare you have the Holy
[48:59] Ghost well I've been born again does
[49:02] your attitude declare that you've been
[49:04] born again if if I didn't look at the
[49:06] way you were dressed and I only judged
[49:08] it off of your attitude and your words
[49:10] would I
[49:14] know do your Works declare that you've
[49:17] been born again he says yes sir if you
[49:21] are a Christian you are going to do what
[49:24] is
[49:24] right it's not a struggle
[49:29] because if you're a Christian it means
[49:30] the life of Jesus is on the inside of
[49:32] you living out through you and you're
[49:35] going to do what is right your Works
[49:39] will show that your heart is right this
[49:41] is where you get into people who say
[49:43] things like God don't look on the
[49:44] outside he looks on the inside
[49:46] absolutely but what's on the inside will
[49:49] always manifest on the outside that is a
[49:52] law that's not argument that that's not
[49:54] disputable what's in here Will manifest
[49:57] out
[49:58] here it won't be something that you put
[50:02] on for you will do his will when no one
[50:06] but God sees you and you will do his
[50:09] will even if it cost you your
[50:14] life notice after Works he goes straight
[50:18] to charity know word for charity is is
[50:22] love he says because without love our
[50:25] works are not EX accepted before God and
[50:28] neither is our service let me put that
[50:31] to you in a way you can understand if
[50:33] you're doing it
[50:34] begrudgingly if you're doing it because
[50:36] you have to I have to do this it's not
[50:42] accepted you have to do it without love
[50:45] our works are not accepted he says now
[50:47] you can see right here that these
[50:49] Believers because remember he's
[50:51] commending them for their their works
[50:53] and their charity weren't in that nickan
[50:56] class that did works as a means of
[50:58] Salvation or to be admired by men we
[51:02] don't do good works so people will think
[51:04] good of us our work should flow out of
[51:07] our life because the Life of Christ is
[51:09] in our life that's what it is the love
[51:12] of God has been shed abroad in our
[51:14] hearts and that is what is driving them
[51:17] to the good works not well I have to do
[51:20] this not rules not regulations but the
[51:25] love of God living out of your life and
[51:27] living for others just like Christ did
[51:31] that's why brother Brandon would say
[51:32] that eternal life is living for others
[51:36] what did Jesus eternal life do when he
[51:39] came to promote himself and and do what
[51:41] he wanted to do and build you know his
[51:43] big Earthly Kingdom and and have a wife
[51:45] and family and live a life of no eternal
[51:49] life came and lived for
[51:51] you eternal life came and gave himself
[51:54] for you eternal life life is living for
[51:58] others so when the Life of Christ is on
[52:01] the inside of you eternal life then you
[52:04] can't help but put others
[52:06] first well I struggle with that get more
[52:09] of
[52:10] Jesus you can't help but put others
[52:13] first to serve others live for others
[52:16] because that's what that life
[52:19] does that life is not a selfish life so
[52:23] what happens I'm not saying you don't
[52:24] have Jesus what I'm saying is you're
[52:26] letting your selfish nature override the
[52:29] life that's trying to live out of you
[52:31] you got to take control of that bring
[52:33] your life your thoughts your ideas
[52:36] subject to the word of God and say no
[52:39] we're not here to be selfish we're here
[52:41] to give our life for other people you
[52:45] you you so love others because it's the
[52:47] love of Christ and it testifies to the
[52:50] world what What did the what did the
[52:53] pagans say when they witnessed this life
[52:55] in the early CHR Christians in the early
[52:58] Christians they said behold how they
[53:00] love each
[53:02] other it was so manifested that other
[53:05] people noticed it they lived for others
[53:08] so much that the pagans had to testify
[53:11] look at how much they love one
[53:14] another and if the pagans or the
[53:16] heathens or whoever you want to put
[53:18] there had the opportunity to sit in on
[53:20] our conversations about our brothers and
[53:23] sisters would they walk away and go my
[53:25] how they love each other'
[53:28] or would they go man they don't even
[53:29] like them
[53:30] people they go to the same
[53:33] church they're the same
[53:36] religion or would they walk away and say
[53:38] my how they love each
[53:43] other at this point brother Brown says
[53:46] he wants to give a
[53:47] warning and he references Matthew 24 and
[53:52] 12 says and because iniquity shall
[53:55] abound the love of many shall wax
[54:00] cold now we know that we're in the age
[54:02] of Le
[54:03] oosa it's an age where the spirit
[54:05] promotes
[54:07] selfishness self-love the love of
[54:10] pleasure the love of material things and
[54:13] and then the spirit of this age makes
[54:16] people say It's All About Me Maybe you
[54:18] don't say it but you live that
[54:20] way it's all about me it's what benefits
[54:23] me what makes me comfortable what gets
[54:27] me more things and the spirit of the age
[54:30] causes you to harden your hearts to the
[54:32] needs and the feelings of
[54:36] others and not only that it caused you
[54:38] to harden your heart to your own
[54:40] spiritual needs and pursuit of what
[54:42] makes you feel good right
[54:46] now he says so many are getting so hard
[54:49] because they haven't realize the effect
[54:51] of this last day spirit it's time to
[54:54] draw n to God and let him fill our lives
[54:58] with his love what' he say right there
[55:01] so many are getting so
[55:04] hard young people don't be a part of the
[55:07] so
[55:08] many don't don't don't be a part of that
[55:11] but but but be like the True Vine there
[55:12] in the darkness of the fourth age who
[55:14] held on to their love of God and held on
[55:18] to their love for each other listen you
[55:22] I hate to use the word have to but
[55:24] you're going to have to fight for it
[55:26] because in this age it's easy to get
[55:28] bitter at people get mad at people get
[55:31] upset at people that's human nature it's
[55:33] going to happen you got to be willing to
[55:35] lay it down and let that love override
[55:38] those
[55:38] feelings you're going to have to fight
[55:40] for it one thing you're going to notice
[55:42] throughout your life and I'll testify
[55:44] for me I don't want to put it on you but
[55:45] I'll say for
[55:47] me is as your relationship with the Lord
[55:51] cools so does your feelings for your
[55:53] brothers and
[55:55] sisters you're on fire for God you love
[55:59] everybody and you're willing to overlook
[56:03] the things about them that you just
[56:05] don't
[56:06] like but get cool on God and all of a
[56:10] sudden that person irritates you to know
[56:13] in all of a sudden every little thing
[56:16] about every little service drives you
[56:18] nuts and you're frustrated at this and
[56:22] that and it's because your own personal
[56:24] relationship has waxed cold
[56:27] when you're on fire for him you're on
[56:29] fire for his people you'll fight for his
[56:32] people you'll love his people you'll
[56:33] care about his people what it is is it's
[56:37] the age trying to cool you off so what
[56:40] am I encouraging you to do look fall in
[56:42] love with Jesus all over
[56:44] again I'm not saying you got to go back
[56:46] and do all the first works over I'm
[56:48] saying stop for a minute and recognize
[56:49] where am I what is this about why did I
[56:52] start this my I used to be so in love
[56:55] with him well then fall in love love
[56:56] with him again remember what it was when
[56:58] your sins were forgiven remember what it
[57:00] was when he came and lifted those
[57:02] burdens away remember what that time was
[57:05] like remember where you were going and
[57:07] where you were headed when you were
[57:08] going to a sinner's grave in a devil's
[57:11] hell and he turned your life around and
[57:13] don't grow cold on him when he gave his
[57:15] life for you fall in love with Jesus all
[57:18] over
[57:20] again and then with that love for your
[57:22] fellow man and your brothers and your
[57:24] sisters it'll begin to flow out of you
[57:27] you won't have to force
[57:31] it God goes on to say to him Jesus says
[57:34] I know your
[57:36] service now when he says that we want
[57:40] that to be a positive statement not a
[57:42] negative when he says that to you I know
[57:45] your
[57:46] service you better hope that's a
[57:48] positive thing not I know your service
[57:51] and it's a negative thing I know what
[57:53] you have done what you haven't done
[57:57] he says I know your service Jesus said
[58:00] he that is greatest of all is servant to
[58:05] all now pay attention to this because
[58:08] this is something that this age doesn't
[58:10] like even as the son of man came not to
[58:13] be ministered unto but to minister so we
[58:18] are to follow that
[58:20] example see him as he bows himself over
[58:24] the feet of the Apostles and washes
[58:26] their tired and dirty feet he said you
[58:29] don't know what I'm doing but you will
[58:32] know Hereafter but what you see me doing
[58:35] you ought also to do now listen true
[58:41] he's literally washing their feet and
[58:43] true we carry out that ordinance but it
[58:46] was about more than that it was about
[58:48] being a
[58:49] servant it was about humbling yourself
[58:53] humbling your opinion of I'm above that
[58:56] why should I have to do that listen the
[58:58] footwash flunky was the lowest of the
[59:01] low in that society and Jesus said I'll
[59:04] do it for my brother I I'll do that and
[59:08] he humbled himself to to to show us to
[59:11] do the work of a
[59:13] servant well well what's that mean
[59:15] brother that well that can take on many
[59:16] different things first of all quit
[59:18] thinking about
[59:20] yourself reach out to others help
[59:23] someone else along the way make their
[59:26] day lighter lighten their load recognize
[59:30] others needs over yours think about
[59:33] their needs and don't always focus on
[59:36] your own listen we all have
[59:39] needs we all have problems we all have
[59:42] issues we all have situations we all
[59:44] have struggles but what this is about is
[59:47] listen you don't think he had
[59:49] problems he was fixing to suffer the
[59:51] most cruel death ever it' been easy for
[59:55] him to say boys pull up a
[59:57] chair let me tell you all about what's
[59:59] is going to happen to me and how this
[1:00:01] last last three and a half years has
[1:00:02] been such a struggle and how nobody's
[1:00:04] believed me and they've rejected me and
[1:00:05] I've been all y y'all sit down and
[1:00:07] listen but he said no let me serve
[1:00:10] you let me take time to serve you so
[1:00:13] what what am I saying it lay your
[1:00:15] struggles and your needs down long
[1:00:18] enough to be a servant to
[1:00:22] others be a good
[1:00:24] listener sometimes that's what people
[1:00:26] people need but this
[1:00:28] ain't rocket science this ain't algebra
[1:00:31] it's not difficult sometimes people
[1:00:33] don't need
[1:00:35] advice sometimes people don't need to
[1:00:37] know what you think they need somebody
[1:00:38] to listen and
[1:00:40] care and lay aside your
[1:00:42] selfishness be be an ear where somebody
[1:00:45] can unload their burdens but we get so
[1:00:48] selfish that all we want to do is unload
[1:00:50] our
[1:00:53] burdens what is it at the end of the
[1:00:55] journey
[1:00:56] that we're all Longing To
[1:00:58] Hear well done my good and
[1:01:02] faithful
[1:01:05] servant that that doesn't just mean that
[1:01:07] you served him how okay it means you
[1:01:09] serve god well then how do we serve him
[1:01:11] what you've done to the least of these
[1:01:13] my little ones you have done unto me
[1:01:16] serving God is about serving his
[1:01:19] people it's about being a
[1:01:22] servant as brother brandham said those
[1:01:24] who long to be served those who want
[1:01:27] recognition those who want to be seated
[1:01:29] at the head of the table will always go
[1:01:32] down in shame we are to be
[1:01:35] servants but that's not easy to hear in
[1:01:38] this age where it's all about get what
[1:01:39] you can while you can and build your
[1:01:41] wealth and do this and look out for you
[1:01:43] that's not the attitude of the Christian
[1:01:45] attit of a Christian is who can I help
[1:01:48] who can I reach out to who who can I
[1:01:50] lighten their
[1:01:52] load I know thy faith and thy patience
[1:01:56] and this point in the scripture he's
[1:01:59] commending them for their faithfulness
[1:02:01] not necessarily U like like his faith
[1:02:05] like they're holding on to the faith but
[1:02:07] the word here is for their faithfulness
[1:02:09] in other words they've been steadfast
[1:02:10] they've been true they've been faithful
[1:02:12] he he says I know thy faith and
[1:02:15] faithfulness and patience go together we
[1:02:18] see that in James 1 and three knowing
[1:02:20] this that the trying of your faith
[1:02:23] worketh patience so patience is the
[1:02:28] outcome of
[1:02:31] faithfulness I hate to tell you this but
[1:02:34] there is no other way to gain
[1:02:37] patience than by the trying of your
[1:02:40] faith that's
[1:02:42] it and we need patience so you're going
[1:02:46] to be tried I I I think it's one of the
[1:02:49] most lacking things in this entire age
[1:02:52] because we want things now we want
[1:02:55] reward now we want you to respond now
[1:02:57] and and and what's the saying somebody
[1:02:59] read your text and you can tell they
[1:03:00] read it and they didn't write you back
[1:03:02] right away what they left me on red why
[1:03:06] didn't they respond right now well why
[1:03:08] don't you go back 20 years and write a
[1:03:10] letter and have to wait a week for them
[1:03:11] to
[1:03:12] respond but this age where used to type
[1:03:14] it they respond do this they respond do
[1:03:18] that put something in the microwave your
[1:03:19] meal comes out they they want it now
[1:03:22] they want success now and it carries
[1:03:24] over to our spiritual life and we'll get
[1:03:26] down and pray and open our eyes to see
[1:03:28] if it happened well it could sure but he
[1:03:32] also wants to see if you'll hold on and
[1:03:35] continue praying and knock and keep on
[1:03:36] knocking and he wants to see that if
[1:03:39] your patience has been how's he going to
[1:03:41] do it by trying your faith to see if
[1:03:43] you'll still hold on to see if you'll
[1:03:45] stand a test of time and that develops
[1:03:48] your
[1:03:49] character he says how highly God regards
[1:03:53] this outworking of our patience
[1:03:56] as seen in James 1 and4 but let patience
[1:03:59] have her perfect work that ye may be
[1:04:02] perfect and entire lacking nothing God's
[1:04:07] will for us is perfection and that
[1:04:09] Perfection is patience wow waiting on
[1:04:14] God and waiting for God what is that
[1:04:19] that's character development having to
[1:04:21] wait for something it's not something
[1:04:23] that this age is used to and and God
[1:04:26] looks at these Saints in the fourth age
[1:04:28] praying for deliverance praying that God
[1:04:31] would move holding on every single day
[1:04:34] people being massacred by the millions
[1:04:36] or by the thousands and he's watching
[1:04:38] them patient as Lambs led to the
[1:04:40] slaughter lovingly Faithfully they serve
[1:04:43] God that is all they wanted out of life
[1:04:46] just service to their lord how great was
[1:04:49] to be their reward in other words they
[1:04:52] never even got their reward
[1:04:54] here I there there's nothing wrong with
[1:04:56] striving for things here on Earth but
[1:04:58] it's time we turn our attention to that
[1:05:01] reward and quit being so impatient you
[1:05:03] may not even receive your reward here
[1:05:06] but how great will your reward be there
[1:05:09] turn your attention and look for that
[1:05:12] reward tonight look away from the
[1:05:14] rewards that the Earth and and that the
[1:05:16] world can give
[1:05:18] you we mentioned this early on in the
[1:05:23] study where he says I know thy Works he'
[1:05:27] already said that at the beginning I
[1:05:28] Know Thy works and now he comes back
[1:05:30] again at the very end of this at the end
[1:05:32] of the same verse and says I Know Thy
[1:05:33] works and the last to be more than the
[1:05:36] first and what we have to understand is
[1:05:39] this is in the time of
[1:05:41] Inquisition where there was more blood
[1:05:43] shed than at any other time except for
[1:05:45] the Reformation if you were a Christian
[1:05:48] and you weren't going with exactly what
[1:05:51] the Catholic Church said you were in
[1:05:53] danger of death every moment of every
[1:05:57] day but during this time he says I Know
[1:06:00] Thy works and the last to be more than
[1:06:03] the first in other words you got
[1:06:06] stronger as the age went on you were
[1:06:09] standing stronger at the End of the Age
[1:06:12] than you were at the beginning of the
[1:06:13] age he says as the darkness of the age
[1:06:16] increased as the honor role of the
[1:06:18] martyrs grew lengthier day by day they
[1:06:21] worked all the harder they served all
[1:06:24] the more and their faith increased their
[1:06:28] faith didn't decrease they didn't get
[1:06:30] weaker at the struggle and why am I
[1:06:32] going through this and God why why they
[1:06:35] said no we're going to press harder
[1:06:36] we're going to serve more we're going to
[1:06:38] give him more of ourselves and here in
[1:06:40] leosa well it seems like it's worse than
[1:06:43] ever I say press harder push for more
[1:06:46] giveing more of your life surrender more
[1:06:48] of who you are how awesome is it that
[1:06:51] God can look at it in the darkness of
[1:06:54] the Dark Ages
[1:06:56] death all around and they served him all
[1:06:59] the more things are getting worse
[1:07:01] they're getting stronger things are
[1:07:03] getting harder they're getting more
[1:07:05] faithful and at the end their works then
[1:07:08] were greater than at the beginning there
[1:07:10] was no waning away there was no slipping
[1:07:12] back into lukewarmness but growing
[1:07:15] stronger day after day to the point that
[1:07:19] it was there labors that would pave the
[1:07:21] way and open up the way for the oncoming
[1:07:23] Reformation the reform didn't come on
[1:07:26] the scene in the in the next age just
[1:07:28] barely stumbling in but these people had
[1:07:31] pushed and pushed and pushed and their
[1:07:33] faith was stronger and stronger and it
[1:07:35] made the way for the Reformation to take
[1:07:38] place what about your faith what about
[1:07:41] the life you're
[1:07:42] living are you making a way for the
[1:07:46] Rapture are you in a situation where
[1:07:48] God's having to go come on we got to get
[1:07:50] your faith up come on get your faith up
[1:07:53] you got to start believing again or is
[1:07:55] there people saying we're going to push
[1:07:56] harder we're going to push more and
[1:07:59] you're going to push so much and get so
[1:08:01] much stronger that you actually make a
[1:08:03] way for for the resurrection that your
[1:08:05] faith makes way for the Rapture of the
[1:08:08] church that's a testimony of these
[1:08:12] people then we bring ourselves to the
[1:08:21] rebuke I think I need to go back
[1:08:24] on
[1:08:27] says notwithstanding Revelations 2 and
[1:08:29] 20 I have a few things against thee now
[1:08:33] notice and we're going to this on the
[1:08:34] next
[1:08:37] slide we've said it ever since the first
[1:08:40] age that there's two
[1:08:43] Vines so when he gives all this Accolade
[1:08:46] I see your works I see your faith I see
[1:08:48] your patience and then he says I have a
[1:08:51] few things against thee we should have
[1:08:53] the understanding that even though he's
[1:08:55] addressing them all as the church he was
[1:08:57] speaking to the True
[1:08:59] Vine and now he's speaking to the
[1:09:02] false I have a few things against thee
[1:09:05] because thou sufferest that woman
[1:09:07] Jezebel which calleth herself a
[1:09:09] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[1:09:12] servants to commit fornication and to
[1:09:15] eat things sacrificed to Idols does this
[1:09:18] sound like something that the True Vine
[1:09:19] would be
[1:09:20] doing
[1:09:22] no it's the false Vine so what we find
[1:09:25] here is we know that there's two vines
[1:09:28] or two churches and he speaks to both of
[1:09:31] them in each age as though they are one
[1:09:35] but let's drop down to verse 23 this is
[1:09:37] just three verses later and he says and
[1:09:39] I will kill her children with death and
[1:09:42] all
[1:09:45] the churches plural there's more than
[1:09:50] one all the churches shall know that I
[1:09:54] am he which searches the Reigns in the
[1:09:56] hearts so obviously without even getting
[1:09:59] into it doctrinally it's easy to see
[1:10:01] that there are some churches that don't
[1:10:04] know he's the one that searches the
[1:10:06] Reigns and the hearts they don't know
[1:10:08] that why because they're given all their
[1:10:10] love and affection and glory to a
[1:10:13] man they've turned away from the true
[1:10:16] and living God and he says I will kill
[1:10:17] her children with death and all the
[1:10:20] churches will know in other words those
[1:10:22] that don't know right now they're going
[1:10:23] to know they're going to find out
[1:10:27] because apparently there's some of them
[1:10:29] that don't understand that he is the one
[1:10:32] but they're going
[1:10:34] to so what church could it be that
[1:10:36] doesn't know this
[1:10:39] truth the one that that has looked away
[1:10:42] from Christ and is now placing all his
[1:10:44] power into the hands of a man the false
[1:10:47] Church the Catholic church now he hadn't
[1:10:51] talking here to the same ones who he
[1:10:52] just commended for all their works and
[1:10:54] all their love brother brandham says of
[1:10:56] course it's the false Vine group because
[1:10:59] the True Believers certainly know that
[1:11:02] judgment begins at the house of God and
[1:11:06] they being God-fearing judge themselves
[1:11:10] that they be not judge why do we preach
[1:11:13] the hard truths why do we say things
[1:11:15] that are cutting so we can take the word
[1:11:18] and judge ourselves with it that we be
[1:11:21] not judged on that
[1:11:23] day judge yourself now allow the word to
[1:11:27] judge you don't let what you think judge
[1:11:29] you don't let you you know well this
[1:11:32] church says well that church well I'm
[1:11:34] thankful for every church but you better
[1:11:36] let the word judge you and not what a
[1:11:38] church says judge
[1:11:41] you he
[1:11:42] says now why does God call these
[1:11:46] churches his churches even though they
[1:11:49] are the false
[1:11:53] Vine because they are
[1:11:56] Christians but they're not Christians of
[1:11:59] the spirit they're Christians of the
[1:12:02] Flesh in other words they are bearing
[1:12:04] the name in vain what's it say in Mark 7
[1:12:06] and7 how be it in vain do they worship
[1:12:11] me teaching for doctrines the
[1:12:14] Commandments of who men in other words
[1:12:18] it never says it never says they're not
[1:12:21] at church worshiping me it doesn't say
[1:12:23] that at all
[1:12:25] he says they're worshiping
[1:12:28] me they are worshiping me and he's
[1:12:31] saying they're doing it in
[1:12:34] vain listen Cain was a
[1:12:37] worshipper you say it doesn't matter as
[1:12:39] long as you worship God then why did he
[1:12:41] say what he said to Cain Cain built an
[1:12:43] altar we know what an altar is it's just
[1:12:44] it's a church place of worship Cain
[1:12:47] built a church Cain brought a beautiful
[1:12:50] sacrifice and God looked at and said
[1:12:53] nope won't accept it
[1:12:56] and he looks at Abel's and says but I'll
[1:12:59] accept
[1:13:01] that now he does he send Cain away
[1:13:05] straight to hell no he says hey don't be
[1:13:08] angry just do what your brother's doing
[1:13:10] he showed you it's in the word just do
[1:13:12] what he's doing and you'll be accepted
[1:13:13] too you tell people that they're
[1:13:15] worshiping wrong and they'll respond
[1:13:17] just like Cain did he didn't go oh
[1:13:20] awesome let me go over here and worship
[1:13:21] with Abel he was so mad about it he
[1:13:24] killed him yeah you can see that Cain
[1:13:27] Spirit rise up in people when you point
[1:13:29] out things in that that they're doing
[1:13:31] that isn't right according to the word
[1:13:33] not according to our
[1:13:37] opinion so he says and we're bringing
[1:13:40] this down to a
[1:13:42] close he says in the same way now
[1:13:45] remember they're Christians but he says
[1:13:47] in the same way a Christian is a
[1:13:49] Christian as long as he subscribes to
[1:13:52] the fact that Jesus is the son of God
[1:13:54] born born of a virgin was crucified and
[1:13:57] died and rose again that he is savior of
[1:14:01] mankind
[1:14:06] Etc he says he is a nominal Christian
[1:14:09] and belongs to the church but he is not
[1:14:12] a true or spiritual believer when do you
[1:14:16] become a true or spiritual believer when
[1:14:18] you accept All the Right
[1:14:20] doctrines no when you're born
[1:14:23] again when you receive the the the New
[1:14:25] Birth when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:14:26] but he says that kind of a Believer is
[1:14:29] one who has been baptized in the body of
[1:14:32] Christ and is a member of him but
[1:14:35] nonetheless it is in God's order that
[1:14:38] the tears grow up with the wheat and
[1:14:41] they are not to be uprooted that is the
[1:14:44] command of God their day for binding and
[1:14:47] burning is coming but not
[1:14:51] yet he says so the spirit is speaking to
[1:14:54] a mix mixed group here in this fourth
[1:14:57] age on the one hand he is praising it's
[1:15:00] the True Vine and on the other he is
[1:15:04] rebuking he has told what is right with
[1:15:07] the True Believer and now he warns what
[1:15:10] the false Vine must do if it is to stand
[1:15:12] Justified before the Lord in other words
[1:15:15] just like with Cain he didn't send them
[1:15:17] away he said here's what you must do if
[1:15:20] you want to be
[1:15:22] justified before the Lord and so I ask
[1:15:25] you tonight as we bring this study to a
[1:15:28] close when the spirit
[1:15:32] speaks what did you
[1:15:35] hear as you sat here tonight did you
[1:15:38] hear yourself prais for your works for
[1:15:41] your
[1:15:42] patience for your
[1:15:44] love or has the word rebuked
[1:15:48] you do you find yourself tolerating
[1:15:52] things of this world as he said you
[1:15:54] tolerate Jezebel
[1:15:56] do you find yourself tolerating a
[1:15:58] lukewarm walk do you find yourself
[1:16:01] tolerating
[1:16:03] sin he says of the false Vine I gave her
[1:16:06] space to
[1:16:08] repent and she would
[1:16:12] not and he tries to enter
[1:16:15] in but he finds himself shut
[1:16:21] out if your life isn't testifying I'm
[1:16:24] not talking about about your
[1:16:25] words I'm not just talking about your
[1:16:28] dress I'm not but your life isn't
[1:16:31] testifying of him tonight and he's
[1:16:34] knocking at your door don't turn him
[1:16:37] away don't lock him
[1:16:39] out well but there was a lot of things
[1:16:42] you said tonight that that I don't line
[1:16:44] up with exactly so so does that mean I
[1:16:46] don't have the Holy Ghost no we all need
[1:16:49] more we all have places where we come
[1:16:52] face to face with the word and we go I'm
[1:16:54] I'm not matching up to that and instead
[1:16:57] of turning away and going but I'm good
[1:16:59] enough that's the attitude of the false
[1:17:02] Vine the True Vine says Lord whatever I
[1:17:04] got to do to match that right there I
[1:17:07] see I'm falling short but Lord there's
[1:17:09] something in me that says I know I can
[1:17:11] be that I know I can match that I know
[1:17:13] you'll give me the
[1:17:15] power and if you see yourself not
[1:17:17] matching up don't don't turn away we all
[1:17:20] have space to grow we all have places to
[1:17:24] repent do not ever get to a place in
[1:17:26] your Christian wal that you don't think
[1:17:28] you have to repent or that you'll never
[1:17:31] have need to repent or say I was wrong
[1:17:34] or I saw that wrong or I acted wrong we
[1:17:37] all have space to repent and tonight he
[1:17:41] offers once again space to
[1:17:45] repent so that on that day when we stand
[1:17:49] there we will all hear the exact same
[1:17:52] thing well done my good and faithful
[1:17:57] servant will you bow your head with me
[1:17:59] this
[1:18:04] evening he says I Know Thy Works he says
[1:18:07] I've seen your faith I've seen your
[1:18:12] patience listen young people old people
[1:18:16] middle-aged people he sees where we're
[1:18:19] at he sees the
[1:18:21] struggle he sees how difficult the age
[1:18:24] is he sees the darkness of the age but
[1:18:27] he hasn't left you here alone he hasn't
[1:18:29] forsaken you you say well I've been
[1:18:31] falling short brother Aon that means I
[1:18:32] the devil said it means I didn't get
[1:18:34] nothing the devil's a
[1:18:36] liar don't let him take what God's done
[1:18:38] for you away just recognize where you
[1:18:40] fall short and say God I need
[1:18:42] more God I need a a greater walk I need
[1:18:45] another refilling I need you to take me
[1:18:46] a step higher Lord I I I don't want to
[1:18:49] be like those that when they come face
[1:18:50] to face with the word instead of
[1:18:52] changing they turn and walk away from it
[1:18:56] but tonight he's offering
[1:18:58] space look the word was was cutting and
[1:19:01] and and clear tonight there are things
[1:19:03] that should come out of the lives of a
[1:19:05] Christian and I'll sit here with my hand
[1:19:07] up and say I know I haven't brought
[1:19:09] forth a full Harvest of every single one
[1:19:11] of those things I know there's places I
[1:19:13] look at and I I could give more I I
[1:19:16] could surrender more I I I could love
[1:19:18] people more I I I I could do more for
[1:19:21] Jesus and my hands up saying Lord Purge
[1:19:24] me
[1:19:25] I I don't want you to be there like that
[1:19:27] last picture knocking on my door and I'm
[1:19:29] sitting there saying I'm good enough
[1:19:30] I've got enough I I'm
[1:19:33] saved but he's saying he wants to give
[1:19:36] you more tonight he wants to take you up
[1:19:39] another level he wants to take you up
[1:19:40] higher to where all things are possible
[1:19:43] to where people know that you're a
[1:19:45] Christian you don't have to tell them
[1:19:48] Christ lives out of you he lives out of
[1:19:51] you in your relationship with your
[1:19:52] friends he lives out of you in your
[1:19:54] relation relationship with your parents
[1:19:56] he lives out of you in your relationship
[1:19:58] with people that you don't
[1:20:01] like Lord fill me so
[1:20:05] full of the Holy Ghost that it can be
[1:20:07] said like like it was of brother
