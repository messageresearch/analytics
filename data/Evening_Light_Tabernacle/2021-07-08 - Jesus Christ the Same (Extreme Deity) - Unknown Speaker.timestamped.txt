[21:48] sister hollis
[21:49] as well as those others that aren't able

[41:41] the house of god together
[41:42] amen in the times that we're living in
[41:45] amen so you can gain courage to press on
[41:49] amen hebrews 13 and verse 8 says jesus
[41:52] christ
[41:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[41:57] also first kings 18 and 36 and it came
[42:00] to pass at the time of the
[42:03] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[42:06] elijah the prophet came near
[42:08] and said lord god of abraham isaac and
[42:11] of israel
[42:12] let it be known this day that thou art
[42:15] god in israel
[42:16] that i am thy servant and that i have
[42:19] done all these things at thy word
[42:22] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[42:24] may know
[42:25] that thou art the lord god and that thou
[42:28] has turned their heart back again
[42:31] then the fire of the lord fell and
[42:33] consumed the burnt sacrifice
[42:36] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[42:40] and licked up the water that was in the
[42:42] trench and when all the people saw it
[42:44] they fell on their faces and they said
[42:47] the lord
[42:48] he is the god the lord he is the god
[42:53] amen we let you be seated
[43:00] i'd like to read this quote again as
[43:04] as it would be played to me
[43:07] from my ipad as i would minister it
[43:08] brother ron spencer's
[43:11] something that's really been speaking to
[43:13] me in the last few days
[43:16] be okay it would come from the worst
[43:17] center in the city
[43:19] you'd say my favorite hymn the
[43:22] background of it you would know that how
[43:24] it came about my friend brother
[43:26] booth cleburne wrote that on his knees
[43:28] by inspiration in the cornfield one
[43:30] night
[43:31] with pasteboard pieces in the bottom of
[43:34] his shoes
[43:35] for soles on his shoes and he sold it to
[43:37] wycliffe for one hundred dollars and
[43:40] taking the
[43:40] taking the copyright of the song he said
[43:43] but that's my favorite of the hymns
[43:46] it expresses the extreme deity
[43:49] of the lord jesus and especially in a
[43:52] day like this when they try to make him
[43:54] just a prophet
[43:56] but he was more than a prophet he was
[43:58] god
[44:01] and this word extreme extreme deity
[44:04] no brother tim ministered some years
[44:06] back on
[44:07] a god who does extreme things but
[44:10] the extreme deity of the lord jesus
[44:14] you know i got to looking at the word
[44:16] extreme it means to
[44:17] exist in a very high degree
[44:21] it's to go to great or exaggerated links
[44:25] it's exceeding the ordinary or the usual
[44:29] or the expected and i have to say this
[44:31] is exactly what had happened in that
[44:33] moment as i stood there in his ministry
[44:34] ministering
[44:36] that god came in a very unexpected way
[44:39] at an unexpected time and it exceeds the
[44:42] ordinary
[44:43] the usual or or the expected and i would
[44:46] like to speak to you tonight on jesus
[44:48] christ the same
[44:50] extreme deity extreme deity you know
[44:53] as we look at this scripture of elijah
[44:57] as he would make the decree or make the
[44:59] lay it all out between him and the
[45:01] prophets of baal
[45:02] that they would beats build an altar and
[45:04] they would and they would
[45:06] you know do whatever they wanted to it
[45:08] and put a sacrifice
[45:09] on it but they said but elijah would
[45:11] make this this one
[45:13] statement that would bring the
[45:15] difference between who he was and who
[45:17] they was
[45:18] was let the god who answers by fire
[45:21] let him be god now this would be extreme
[45:24] this would be this would not be just
[45:26] lighting a fire it wouldn't be just
[45:28] you know your normal thing but it was
[45:31] beyond
[45:32] even what a human could even comprehend
[45:35] and it would be an extreme thing it
[45:37] would go exceeding it would exceed the
[45:39] ordinary or the usual
[45:41] or the expected and they said this is a
[45:44] good thing you know the children of
[45:45] israel this is a good thing let the god
[45:46] who answers by fire
[45:48] let him be god and we know the story is
[45:50] how the prophets of baal they would get
[45:52] their stuff together and they would
[45:54] begin to dance and shout and scream
[45:56] and cut themselves and elijah would
[45:58] actually begin to
[46:00] uh rebuke them or even make fun of them
[46:03] as they would do this and he would tell
[46:06] them
[46:06] you know maybe god's out there on a
[46:08] vacation or maybe he's doing something
[46:10] they'll scream a little louder
[46:12] amen because he knew of where he was
[46:13] standing he knew he served the one true
[46:16] living god
[46:17] amen that this god could do exactly what
[46:20] he said he would do
[46:21] and so and elijah and confidence would
[46:24] bring it to a place
[46:25] and he would bring the altar and it
[46:27] would very type out our elijah in this
[46:29] day
[46:30] how he'd bring all the loose sins
[46:31] together and all the broken pieces back
[46:33] together
[46:34] place the stones back in their place the
[46:36] wood back in his place
[46:38] everything in exact order according to
[46:40] the word of god
[46:41] and he would he would bring the waters
[46:43] upon it he would do all these things
[46:45] and then he would stand back and he said
[46:47] if i've done all that you have asked see
[46:49] brother brandon would pick this up he
[46:51] said see elijah had saw a vision
[46:53] he saw god had spoke to him to tell and
[46:56] told him
[46:56] exactly what to do and how to do it and
[46:59] he said see
[47:00] he and he said see he come and he come
[47:02] to this moment
[47:04] but it still had to take the fire of god
[47:06] he could ask for it he could speak about
[47:08] it he could talk about it
[47:10] but it had to take the fire of god to
[47:12] come down
[47:13] upon the altar and burn up the sacrifice
[47:16] and that
[47:16] as we read that's exactly what took
[47:18] place god done the extreme
[47:20] and he showed a sign and a wonder amen
[47:23] amen to
[47:24] to bring the people's attention back to
[47:27] himself that i am truly god
[47:29] bale's not god he couldn't answer he
[47:32] couldn't he if he couldn't answer this
[47:33] simple request he can't do anything for
[47:36] you
[47:36] but i can answer this and so therefore
[47:38] if i can answer this request
[47:40] i can do what i said i will do amen so
[47:43] you know i began thinking about the
[47:45] different things through the
[47:47] through the old testament how god showed
[47:49] extreme he showed the extreme
[47:52] deity not just uh not just himself but
[47:55] extreme deity took it beyond ordinary
[47:58] of course god himself is beyond ordinary
[48:00] but amen he took it even to a point that
[48:03] people couldn't
[48:04] they couldn't say anything about it they
[48:05] couldn't question it they couldn't
[48:07] you know they had to say this was god
[48:10] amen and so
[48:11] we of course you know it begins with the
[48:13] very creation of all things
[48:15] the sun the earth the universe that we
[48:18] live in today
[48:19] actually expresses his extreme deity
[48:22] that when you know we look at that
[48:24] universe that we live we've talked about
[48:25] it how that they have looked with their
[48:27] best
[48:27] instruments and they've come to the
[48:29] conclusion maybe
[48:30] not exact conclusion but to their best
[48:33] ability to
[48:34] say that if they could go out to the
[48:36] furthest point they don't think they
[48:37] could ever get to it
[48:38] because it's almost unlimited or is
[48:41] unlimited
[48:42] amen because it's showing or expressing
[48:44] his extreme
[48:45] deity amen who he is and and what he's
[48:49] doing amen so
[48:50] as we would read in the scriptures in
[48:52] the beginning god created the heavens
[48:54] and the earth
[48:54] his word began to speak and it became
[48:57] the past amen
[48:58] as sun began to form earth began to form
[49:01] stars upon stars upon stars
[49:04] unlimited amount of stars began to be
[49:06] put in their place
[49:07] and he began to express himself as
[49:09] brother branham would say he wrote
[49:11] his first bible in the heavens and he
[49:13] expressed himself in a place
[49:16] to be an extreme god who can do extreme
[49:18] things
[49:19] and so you know the greatest miracle
[49:22] that is the creation of all things and
[49:24] this is what
[49:25] even john 1 would say in the beginning
[49:27] was the word and the word was with god
[49:29] and the word was god he was in the
[49:31] beginning with god
[49:33] all things were made through him and
[49:35] without him
[49:36] nothing was made that was made so the
[49:39] greatest miracle is the creation of all
[49:41] things his deity
[49:43] his extremeness his greatness his
[49:46] vastness
[49:46] everything that he is is expressed in
[49:49] his creation
[49:51] amen it shows and it shows all the way
[49:53] down through the bible
[49:54] his deity how he can move how he could
[49:57] orchestrate
[49:58] how he could bring something so
[50:00] unbelievably to pass to where
[50:02] amen it would it would blow the minds of
[50:04] men that were there amen
[50:05] i know men today wants to look at it and
[50:07] say it wasn't happening
[50:09] but the men that was there could say
[50:10] this truly was god
[50:12] this truly was god and he would show it
[50:15] in abraham and sarah hey we'd call him
[50:17] out of a nation and
[50:18] he would say come walk with me and he
[50:20] would give him a promise of a son
[50:22] and and it would again it seemed like
[50:24] this promise would linger and linger
[50:25] until
[50:26] amen abraham and sarah was even well
[50:29] past childbearing and
[50:30] well past the ability to produce amen
[50:33] life and
[50:34] and god would come in such an extreme
[50:37] way
[50:37] that he would change their bodies they
[50:40] meant to receive the promised son
[50:42] how he would give them the promise and
[50:44] and though their body be
[50:45] dead and and lifeless and and it seemed
[50:49] impossible his word his deity his
[50:52] extreme deity would still prevail
[50:55] it would it would be it was extreme to
[50:57] take an old man
[50:58] an old woman and change them into such a
[51:01] place
[51:02] that they could give birth to a child
[51:04] amen the burning bush was an extreme
[51:06] expression of his deity
[51:08] that god could come down and light a
[51:10] bush on fire
[51:11] and it'd not burn that was a expression
[51:13] of some self it was a sign
[51:15] it was a wonder it was showing who he
[51:18] was it was pointing to something amen
[51:20] amen we would see the ten plagues that
[51:22] would take place and
[51:23] and it would bring about the uh the
[51:26] freedom of israel out of
[51:27] egypt and it would show his extremeness
[51:30] and how he could
[51:30] create frogs and fleas and dust out of
[51:33] dust and
[51:34] out of nothing and turned water into
[51:36] blood
[51:37] and do and darkness upon the earth and
[51:40] and the death angel and all that
[51:42] it was showing his extreme deity it was
[51:45] showing who he was amen of course the
[51:48] red sea
[51:49] he would bring them to that place and
[51:51] that would have definitely would show
[51:52] who he was and
[51:53] you know the morning i was woke up to
[51:55] this as brother branham would speak
[51:57] these words
[51:58] he would say stand still and see the
[52:00] salvation of god
[52:01] he said what was he doing he was
[52:03] expressing himself
[52:05] in that moment of need and he was making
[52:07] the red sea
[52:08] stand to attention as his people walked
[52:11] through it
[52:12] it was expressing his extreme deity it
[52:14] was expressing
[52:16] who he was and how he was a deliverer
[52:18] and how he could make a way where there
[52:20] seemed to be no way
[52:21] how he could open up things that seems
[52:23] impossible and how he can move
[52:25] mountains and how he can move seas it
[52:28] was showing who he was and who he is
[52:31] and he would show himself as he would
[52:33] turn bitter waters into sweet and
[52:35] drinkable waters and
[52:36] he would show himself as he would he
[52:38] would go down and he would feed
[52:39] people out of adam quail and manna that
[52:42] fell from heaven
[52:44] and he would it would show himself how
[52:45] he would deliver them from their enemies
[52:47] and
[52:47] how he'd move in a in a moment he would
[52:50] he would show himself as he would make
[52:52] them
[52:52] bring come break them come to the moment
[52:54] of crossing the jordan
[52:56] when it was out of his banks and and it
[52:58] seemed impossible but yet
[53:00] god always makes the possible or the
[53:02] impossible possible
[53:05] and it would tell them to take me and be
[53:06] in faith and to step into the water
[53:09] and that water would move back again as
[53:11] he did at the red sea it was showing
[53:13] the same god today is the same god that
[53:16] was yesterday
[53:17] he was showing himself he was extreme
[53:19] his extreme deity these are extreme
[53:22] things
[53:23] this is not your normal things it's not
[53:25] your explainable things
[53:26] these are extreme it's beyond the usual
[53:29] amen
[53:30] until where he would come to the jericho
[53:32] and and it seemed impossible seemed too
[53:34] high
[53:35] it seemed too wide it seemed to too
[53:37] great
[53:38] and then and he would tell them and give
[53:39] them the instructions and they would
[53:41] follow him
[53:42] and they would give a shout and the
[53:44] walls would fall down
[53:45] he was showing himself i'm god over
[53:48] every situation
[53:51] he would show himself in the sun that
[53:53] would stand still
[53:54] as joshua was trying to get his victory
[53:56] over his enemies and
[53:58] he was saying look i need more time i'm
[54:00] not done with this battle
[54:02] they're going to get away if it goes
[54:04] dark son you stand still
[54:06] moon you don't move and it will so amen
[54:08] it may go beyond your thinking and your
[54:10] imagination
[54:11] but it happened anyhow and god showed
[54:15] who he was in that moment
[54:17] [Music]
[54:18] amen in his battles he would show his
[54:21] deity where
[54:22] he would reign hail stones and he would
[54:24] send hornets he would set and b
[54:26] ambushments he would send angels you
[54:29] know to where even one angel would come
[54:31] into the camp of the syrians
[54:33] and kill 185 000
[54:36] one angel oh come on somebody
[54:40] we're talking about the greatness of our
[54:42] god tonight
[54:43] and who he is amen he would put words
[54:46] even in a donkey's mouth
[54:48] that's extreme that's that's beyond
[54:51] human comprehension
[54:52] amen it was so far beyond that even the
[54:54] man that was riding him didn't even
[54:56] catch it for a few moments
[54:58] it was so extreme amen his anointing is
[55:01] would fall upon a man
[55:03] named sham guard to where that man with
[55:05] an ox goat could kill
[55:06] 600 philistines he would it was so
[55:09] extreme that his anointing would fall
[55:11] upon a man
[55:12] and a man named simpson and he would
[55:14] kill a thousand philistines
[55:16] with a jawbone his anointing was so
[55:18] extreme that
[55:19] it would fall upon a young boy and it
[55:21] would kill a goliath with a sling and a
[55:23] stone
[55:24] his deity would sustain widows and
[55:26] doubts
[55:28] or in droughts it would give barren
[55:30] women children
[55:31] he would stand in the lion's den and
[55:33] shut their mouth he would stand in the
[55:35] fire
[55:36] and three hebrew children would talking
[55:38] about your god tonight
[55:39] would stand up through fire and three
[55:41] hebrew children would walk out
[55:43] without even a smell of smoke and to
[55:45] think
[55:47] that deity came down into flesh
[55:54] how striking it is to know that he
[55:57] wasn't
[55:57] he wasn't satisfied with being able to
[55:59] just send down hail stones and
[56:01] and be able to put this over here and do
[56:03] this over here he wanted to come down
[56:05] himself
[56:07] the extreme deity he said brother was
[56:10] saying he said how striking it is
[56:12] that god himself would come become a
[56:14] baby
[56:15] that god so loved the world that one of
[56:17] the greatest scriptures there is the
[56:19] love of god so loved the world
[56:21] he gave his only begotten son and
[56:23] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[56:25] perish
[56:26] but have everlasting life the very dust
[56:29] that he created on earth
[56:31] he became that dust the extreme
[56:34] deity of god stepped into the flesh and
[56:37] was called emmanuel
[56:40] not just god above us god with us
[56:45] hallelujah changing his his form
[56:48] or his face or his mass from god
[56:52] to man he said he stretches tents
[56:55] from the stars of heaven down to live
[56:58] here on earth
[56:59] with filthy creatures as we are the love
[57:02] of god
[57:03] he said how striking it is to be as for
[57:06] a sinner it ought to be to a sinner
[57:08] to know the little jehovah crying in his
[57:10] mother's arms
[57:13] little jehovah not not a polished up
[57:15] angel
[57:16] or polish of an angel he came as
[57:18] abraham's seed
[57:20] he came as a man he never came down to
[57:23] the golden corridors of heaven
[57:24] if it would it would have been for the
[57:26] rich but he was born in a manger
[57:28] so poor he had to borrow a womb so poor
[57:31] he had to borrow a place to be born
[57:33] but when he left he had a border grave
[57:35] to be buried in
[57:37] jehovah emmanuel amen the extreme
[57:40] deity of god is that a super son
[57:49] god sent prophets he sent signs
[57:53] he said everything but he said i'll give
[57:55] you a super sign
[57:58] this sign is going to be me myself
[58:01] i'm coming down to dwell among you to be
[58:04] called emmanuel
[58:05] he said that ought to strike the people
[58:07] himself be made flesh and dwelt among us
[58:10] born in a dirty stinking stable little
[58:13] jehovah not laying in a pink basket in a
[58:15] hospital room
[58:16] but a stinking manger over a manure pile
[58:18] in a barn
[58:19] emanuel the creator of heavens and earth
[58:22] emmanuel
[58:23] the swat on the cloth of emmanuel oh
[58:25] hallelujah
[58:26] little jehovah playing as a child
[58:28] jehovah as a teenager
[58:30] jehovah as a carpenter it ought to
[58:32] strike us
[58:33] amen it ought to strike us that it was
[58:36] god
[58:37] veiled in flesh and extreme expression
[58:40] of his deity
[58:42] and he showed who he was because he came
[58:45] and he had the same power
[58:46] and the same anointing and the same
[58:48] abilities
[58:50] [Music]
[58:51] hallelujah he would see people that was
[58:53] walled in by
[58:54] spirits of hell and he would break down
[58:57] those spirits
[58:58] and set that person free he would see
[59:01] people bound by
[59:02] all kinds of things uh their blinded
[59:05] eyes
[59:09] that story that blind man when they
[59:11] would walk up to him and always has been
[59:13] one of my
[59:14] personal favorites of how he was born
[59:17] blind
[59:18] and and the disciples asked did he sin
[59:20] or did his mother or daddy sin that this
[59:22] man is born by blind and he said
[59:24] jesus said no but that the glory of god
[59:27] may be made manifest
[59:30] why are you going there through things
[59:32] church because that the glory of god
[59:34] might be made manifest
[59:36] why are we having trials why are we
[59:38] having a situation
[59:39] so the glory of god might be made his
[59:41] extreme deity
[59:43] might be shown to a dying world
[59:46] that he is still the same yesterday
[59:48] today and forever
[59:49] this is why the man was born blind so i
[59:52] can
[59:52] show people who i am
[59:58] he said i don't want to serve a god like
[1:00:00] that well then serve the devil he does
[1:00:02] it too
[1:00:04] he tears your body apart with drugs and
[1:00:06] alcohol to show who he is
[1:00:08] i'd rather be born and lifted up out of
[1:00:11] this old mary clay
[1:00:13] to that god can show amen the
[1:00:15] manifestation of himself
[1:00:17] even if it may be extreme it may seem
[1:00:18] impossible it may seem like a million
[1:00:21] miles from happening but god works in
[1:00:23] impossibilities
[1:00:27] i mean how many impossibilities are we
[1:00:29] looking at here tonight
[1:00:32] impossible that you're here tonight
[1:00:34] impossible that you heard the cry of god
[1:00:36] impossible that you would even want to
[1:00:38] know more about god
[1:00:39] but you're here why because god went
[1:00:42] past
[1:00:43] what was impossible and made it possible
[1:00:47] showing you who he is
[1:00:55] brother bryan will tell the story about
[1:00:56] a woman
[1:00:58] while he's preaching on the deity of
[1:00:59] jesus christ he said
[1:01:01] mr branham he said i appreciate your
[1:01:03] preaching but
[1:01:04] one thing i don't agree with you she
[1:01:05] said what's that
[1:01:11] i like his reply she said there's one
[1:01:12] thing i don't agree with you
[1:01:14] he said what is it sister if there's
[1:01:15] just one thing i'm thankful to meet you
[1:01:17] because usually it's about a hundred
[1:01:18] things
[1:01:20] she said well there's one thing
[1:01:22] outstanding of course you belong to
[1:01:23] church
[1:01:24] that didn't believe in the deity of
[1:01:25] christ
[1:01:27] just like when i see today when they go
[1:01:28] to push him back and just make him a
[1:01:30] prophet
[1:01:31] she said you may you brag too much about
[1:01:33] jesus you make him divine i said he was
[1:01:36] divine
[1:01:36] it couldn't be divine i can prove it to
[1:01:39] you about your bible it was it wasn't
[1:01:40] divine
[1:01:41] so i'd like to see you do that all right
[1:01:43] take your bible and turn to saint john
[1:01:45] 11.
[1:01:46] all right i know what you're going to
[1:01:47] say and
[1:01:49] she said jesus on the road down to raise
[1:01:51] lazarus up by the grave
[1:01:53] the bible said he wept i said sure he
[1:01:56] said well now how can he be divine and
[1:01:58] weep
[1:01:58] i said that was the man part weeping
[1:02:01] that's right but you failed to see that
[1:02:03] he was emmanuel
[1:02:05] he was both man and god i said he was
[1:02:08] going
[1:02:08] he was a man going to a grave weeping
[1:02:11] but when he pulled them little shoulders
[1:02:13] back together
[1:02:14] and said lazarus come forth that man had
[1:02:17] been dead four days
[1:02:18] stinking came forth and lived again that
[1:02:21] took more than a man
[1:02:23] he was a man when he came off the
[1:02:25] mountain that night hungry
[1:02:27] looking on a tree to find something to
[1:02:28] eat but when he took five biscuits and
[1:02:31] two fish
[1:02:31] and he fed five thousand that was more
[1:02:34] than a man
[1:02:35] that was the creator jehovah at work
[1:02:37] again
[1:02:39] he was a man when he was laying in the
[1:02:41] ship that night and ten thousand devils
[1:02:43] of the sea
[1:02:44] swore he would drown him bats bouncing
[1:02:46] him up there like a bottle stopper
[1:02:48] and when waves coming up he was tired
[1:02:50] from preaching until he couldn't even
[1:02:52] move
[1:02:52] they didn't even wake him but once he
[1:02:54] was aroused and went forth
[1:02:56] he put his foot up on the bow that boat
[1:02:58] and looked at that storm right in the
[1:03:00] eye
[1:03:00] and said peace be still and there wasn't
[1:03:03] even more than a ripple
[1:03:05] that took more than a man that could
[1:03:07] steal the waves of the sea
[1:03:09] it was a man that cried for mercy at a
[1:03:11] cross my god my god why has that
[1:03:14] forsaken me
[1:03:14] but on easter morning when he broke the
[1:03:18] seals of death hell in the grave
[1:03:20] and he rose up again and said i am he
[1:03:22] that was dead
[1:03:23] but i'm alive forevermore that was more
[1:03:26] than a man
[1:03:27] that was god in man
[1:03:31] expressing his extreme deity
[1:03:35] he said every man that ever amounted to
[1:03:37] a hill of beans believes that
[1:03:39] so if you don't believe that tonight you
[1:03:41] don't even mount to a hill of beans
[1:03:45] you don't know where you're standing at
[1:03:47] you don't know who's standing among you
[1:03:50] that's truly what it is you don't know
[1:03:52] who's standing among you
[1:03:53] you want to make him just a prophet or
[1:03:55] or a lower part of the godhead or
[1:03:58] something second
[1:03:59] but second part whatever he he was god
[1:04:01] veiled in flesh
[1:04:03] the extreme deity he would show it over
[1:04:06] and over
[1:04:07] even though you know he didn't come with
[1:04:08] a salute from heaven he he didn't come
[1:04:10] as an angel he didn't come with this
[1:04:13] big applaud or anything like that he
[1:04:16] came down
[1:04:18] amen as abraham's seed to show that last
[1:04:21] day
[1:04:22] super sign of god to make a supersede
[1:04:25] a super race a race that has been
[1:04:27] promised
[1:04:28] abraham's race to bring forth a
[1:04:30] supersede that we've been talking about
[1:04:32] a super christ what did he do with him
[1:04:35] to him when he would come to earth they
[1:04:36] made fun of him
[1:04:37] they called him called the spirit that
[1:04:39] was working in him a devil it's a devil
[1:04:42] it's beelzebub a fortune teller
[1:04:44] but they failed to realize who was
[1:04:46] veiled behind that flesh
[1:04:50] it was a super sign he rose up again on
[1:04:54] the third day
[1:04:56] for he trusted the word of god
[1:05:00] hello deity trusted his own word
[1:05:04] he trusted his own word david has spoken
[1:05:07] under inspiration
[1:05:09] he said i'll not leave his soul in hell
[1:05:10] neither will i suffer my holy one to see
[1:05:12] corruption
[1:05:13] therefore jesus knew that the scripture
[1:05:15] spoke of him that he wouldn't see
[1:05:17] corruption corruption sets in about 72
[1:05:19] hours
[1:05:20] on a dead body we know that we know he
[1:05:22] knew sometime between that
[1:05:24] he would raise from the dead and he rose
[1:05:27] prophets were signs
[1:05:28] that but they died and went into a grave
[1:05:30] but jesus was a superside
[1:05:32] amen expressing the extreme deity
[1:05:36] of god building flesh
[1:05:39] oh my
[1:05:43] that same deity that would open up the
[1:05:45] red sea and it would
[1:05:47] it would call hailstones down it would
[1:05:49] it would do all kinds of things extreme
[1:05:52] it would come now in this flesh and it
[1:05:54] would cost stan at a friend's grave
[1:05:56] and call him back to life again it would
[1:05:58] heal the lame it would heal the halt
[1:06:00] it would heal the sick it would give ice
[1:06:02] to the blind he
[1:06:04] showed that indeed the jehovah of the
[1:06:05] old is jesus of the new
[1:06:08] it's the same power it's the same
[1:06:10] anointing it's the same works
[1:06:13] it's the same life it's the same god
[1:06:16] hallelujah and to think that that god
[1:06:19] was not happy
[1:06:20] just being in one flesh
[1:06:24] amen he wants to show himself in an
[1:06:25] extreme way
[1:06:27] at extreme times amen to show that he's
[1:06:30] god
[1:06:35] and the same deity fell on about 120
[1:06:38] in the upper room filled them with the
[1:06:40] power of god
[1:06:41] and they went forth to heal deliver and
[1:06:44] set free god's people
[1:06:46] why it was the same deity
[1:06:50] are you with me tonight it's the same
[1:06:52] god

[1:06:56] god

[1:06:58] just one body it's 120 bodies
[1:07:02] and it's breaking out and it's breaking
[1:07:04] out and it's breaking out
[1:07:05] what god is expressing himself as a
[1:07:07] portion of deity
[1:07:09] is actually being placed in every person
[1:07:12] by the holy ghost
[1:07:16] i'm about to use this mic brother tim my
[1:07:19] voices ain't got it

[1:07:44] to be with you

[1:08:12] but he's the one that stood on the
[1:08:14] invisible platform
[1:08:15] and reached out and said let there be
[1:08:17] light and there was light
[1:08:19] that was jesus christ for he was in the
[1:08:22] world and the world was made by him
[1:08:24] and the world recognized him not but i
[1:08:26] recognize him
[1:08:28] i recognize that he's still the same

[1:08:55] in the world and the world was made by
[1:08:57] him

[1:09:00] that he
[1:09:01] is the deity of god look what he did

[1:09:35] didn't matter to an eternal creature
[1:09:38] time only matters to us it don't matter
[1:09:40] to god but god spoke it and it happened
[1:09:44] he brought it to pass by his word

[1:17:40] cell to become

[1:18:43] himself up
[1:18:44] wrapping himself in a blood cell to come
[1:18:47] down to redeem man to life
[1:18:49] he said when that blood cell began to
[1:18:50] spread out and spread out
[1:18:52] it brought the body of christ jesus
[1:18:55] jehovah himself was tabernacled in him
[1:18:57] through it bursting to that blood cell
[1:18:59] at calvary that it might bring
[1:19:01] sons and daughters to himself and now

[1:19:08] that's what makes satan mad

[1:19:36] all things are possible that means
[1:19:37] there's nothing impossible
[1:19:41] it makes it very simple there's nothing
[1:19:44] impossible to gods what they keep saying

[1:21:40] confident than ever
[1:21:42] god's got this god's going to move god's
[1:21:45] going

[1:21:49] i said but i said i'll bind with you on
[1:21:51] that i'll believe with you on that
[1:21:53] because i know
[1:21:54] the same god that walked on waters is
[1:21:56] the same god in us
[1:21:58] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:00] forever he's not just a god 2000 years
[1:22:03] ago

[1:22:18] she would be back to herself
[1:22:20] and she'd be giving kisses and saying
[1:22:22] words and speaking
[1:22:23] amen he's the same god
[1:22:28] hallelujah he's the same god he's
[1:22:30] showing us
[1:22:31] amen his extreme deity
[1:22:35] i would actually come home from there
[1:22:37] and go to brother david and sister
[1:22:38] atlanta
[1:22:38] and give the testimony again of what all
[1:22:40] had taken place and i said i have to
[1:22:42] fully believe
[1:22:44] god is here to show his extreme
[1:22:47] deity he's here to show himself in a
[1:22:50] real
[1:22:50] powerful way to show he is still god
[1:22:58] and i'm looking at it i'm seeing
[1:23:01] strength come to a body
[1:23:03] i'm seeing mine return to a to a mind
[1:23:06] i'm seeing god move in the
[1:23:09] impossibilities
[1:23:15] i say god continue the work
[1:23:18] you are the author but you're also the
[1:23:21] finisher
[1:23:22] who who started the work will finish the
[1:23:25] work
[1:23:26] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:23:29] and forever
[1:23:31] if he can make dry bones live again he
[1:23:34] can make a body that's been torn down
[1:23:36] by satan's attacks he knows that old
[1:23:38] devil has been against her
[1:23:40] as his enemy and i heard the prophet of
[1:23:42] god say it today
[1:23:43] as i would watch deep call it to the d
[1:23:45] he would say when they
[1:23:47] when the when the devil or satan gets
[1:23:48] out after one of god's children
[1:23:50] he said he better watch out he's got
[1:23:52] jesus christ on his hands
[1:23:56] hallelujah amen the devil is not just
[1:23:59] dealing with you
[1:24:00] as a man or you as a man or you or you
[1:24:02] as a man or me as a man or you as a
[1:24:05] woman
[1:24:05] he's dealing with almighty god filled in
[1:24:10] [Applause]
[1:24:14] flesh
[1:24:19] he said he broke open that blood cell
[1:24:20] and he washed us
[1:24:22] and he brought us us into himself by the
[1:24:24] holy spirit
[1:24:25] there you are now we are sons of god
[1:24:30] part of god deity itself
[1:24:33] lives in every believer how many
[1:24:34] believers every man that's born of the
[1:24:37] spirit of god is a part of god
[1:24:40] no wonder that man believes in the
[1:24:42] supernatural
[1:24:44] no wonder he can believe in anything
[1:24:46] because an in him is a portion of god
[1:24:50] in other words in him is the
[1:24:56] supernatural
[1:24:58] mercy jesus said these signs shall
[1:25:01] follow them that believe
[1:25:03] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:25:05] speak with new tongues
[1:25:06] take up serpents drink deadly things or
[1:25:08] lay hands on the sick
[1:25:10] and they shall recover jesus said that
[1:25:13] he's become a part of him yes sir god on
[1:25:15] the instance of the
[1:25:16] on the instance of deliver anything
[1:25:18] he'll make a way when there's no way
[1:25:20] he'll make a way
[1:25:21] any man that believes in him believes
[1:25:23] the same thing he has to he's a part of
[1:25:25] god he's the offspring of god he's the
[1:25:27] son of god
[1:25:28] or a daughter of god he can't do nothing
[1:25:30] else because god's right with him
[1:25:32] even in him he's just a portion of god
[1:25:34] everything that god was in the pillar of
[1:25:36] fire
[1:25:37] he emptied into the son jesus christ and
[1:25:39] everything he wasn't the son jesus
[1:25:41] christ
[1:25:42] he's now emptied into his body the bride
[1:25:47] oh my god the mighty one the buckler the
[1:25:50] shield
[1:25:52] all his redemptive names everything he
[1:25:54] was he emptied into jesus christ
[1:26:04] he was saying jesus would say it like
[1:26:06] this what you say
[1:26:09] to this mountain be raised up and cast
[1:26:12] in the sea
[1:26:13] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:26:14] what you say is coming to pass
[1:26:16] you will have it what you say
[1:26:20] what you say then how can a man move a
[1:26:22] mountain
[1:26:23] only deity can move a mountain but so if
[1:26:27] we're sons and
[1:26:28] daughters of god then you go out and say
[1:26:30] mountain move
[1:26:32] that's not what he said you say i'll
[1:26:34] show you i can move
[1:26:36] it that's wrong it's you if you're but
[1:26:38] if your objectives is right and your
[1:26:40] motive is right
[1:26:41] then it's not you speaking it's deity
[1:26:44] speaking
[1:26:46] i am the vine you're the branches when
[1:26:48] you can get out of your own way so away
[1:26:50] from you
[1:26:50] that it's not you no more but let christ
[1:26:52] speak through you
[1:26:53] he said like these anointed ministers
[1:26:55] when they get anointed by the holy
[1:26:56] spirit to preach the word
[1:26:58] you don't have to worry about any words
[1:26:59] the holy spirit just delivers them
[1:27:01] you don't know what you're going to say
[1:27:03] the spirit just says it that's all
[1:27:04] that's what makes it all right he said
[1:27:06] that's the way it is by speaking to the
[1:27:08] mountain
[1:27:09] if your objective is right and your
[1:27:11] motive is right
[1:27:12] it isn't you speaking anymore it's the
[1:27:14] spirit of god speaking
[1:27:16] and when that that's what moves the
[1:27:17] mountain not you
[1:27:19] the spirit of god
[1:27:21] [Music]
[1:27:23] hallelujah
[1:27:28] you can learn you can learn more about
[1:27:29] the deity of christ and
[1:27:31] in the pergament church age he'd speak
[1:27:34] some wonderful things about it
[1:27:39] he would say this jesus would say i'm
[1:27:42] the way the truth and the life
[1:27:45] there he there it is he is a spirit and
[1:27:47] he is life
[1:27:49] that is exactly what the word is that's
[1:27:50] exactly what jesus says he is the word
[1:27:53] so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man
[1:27:56] in faith
[1:27:57] takes that word into his heart and
[1:27:59] places upon his lips
[1:28:01] while that's the same as deity speaking
[1:28:04] every mountain has to go satan cannot
[1:28:08] stand
[1:28:08] before that man hallelujah oh
[1:28:14] can somebody say hallelujah
[1:28:18] hallelujah he said if the church way
[1:28:20] back there in that third age had only
[1:28:22] held to the revelation of the living
[1:28:23] word in their midst
[1:28:24] the power of god would not have faded as
[1:28:26] it did in those dark ages
[1:28:28] and right today when the church returns
[1:28:30] to the word and faith
[1:28:31] we can say without a doubt that the
[1:28:33] glory of god
[1:28:34] and all of his wonderful acts of gods
[1:28:37] will be
[1:28:38] in her midst again he said because
[1:28:41] it's deity in the hearts of men once
[1:28:43] again
[1:28:46] oh my we saw it also in this day
[1:28:49] wow undeniable proofs of his
[1:28:52] resurrection
[1:28:54] lame would walk people would jump out of
[1:28:57] wheelchairs
[1:28:58] watching the deep calling to the deep
[1:29:00] cancers would fall off
[1:29:03] there was a woman in the meeting that
[1:29:04] was carrying around one of the gross
[1:29:06] said it fell off
[1:29:07] turned white and fell off in that
[1:29:09] meeting what was it god showing his
[1:29:11] extremeness
[1:29:12] his extreme deity you know and it's just
[1:29:16] our position and our place
[1:29:18] to continue to speak faith
[1:29:21] to continue to speak what god has said
[1:29:24] you know it's
[1:29:25] it's our position and our place amen to
[1:29:27] use the words of god
[1:29:29] and speak it it's what he told us to do
[1:29:32] so it's our position
[1:29:33] it's who we are you know brother brandon
[1:29:36] i just want to bring this in the end as
[1:29:37] we
[1:29:38] look at these things for a moment he had
[1:29:41] his little little mexican brother that
[1:29:43] had a son
[1:29:48] he said a man about my age his wife is a
[1:29:50] finnish woman
[1:29:52] a little blind brother danny stevens
[1:29:53] shared this with me blessed me so much
[1:29:56] very lovely lady he was a gentleman went
[1:29:59] to the hospital he said i've seen a lot
[1:30:00] of sites we all do
[1:30:02] he said that disturbs us and brings our
[1:30:04] emotions but that was one of the worst i
[1:30:06] ever seen
[1:30:08] they brought this little lad to near the
[1:30:10] nursery room to with a special nurse
[1:30:12] when i looked
[1:30:13] there's cancer that spread his little
[1:30:15] jaws out so far
[1:30:17] they had to put a rag around his head to
[1:30:19] keep the keep from bursting his head
[1:30:21] open
[1:30:23] in his little jaws where the doctor
[1:30:25] tried to cut the cancer away they had
[1:30:26] made great big ditches back and forth
[1:30:28] all the way around his little throat
[1:30:30] just just aggravated the cancers he said
[1:30:33] just scattered it maybe it would be the
[1:30:35] right word
[1:30:36] said it went into his little tongue and
[1:30:37] little baby's mouth not over that wide
[1:30:39] little tongue had swollen and run out
[1:30:41] about that far and turned black
[1:30:43] and it was shutting the air off that
[1:30:45] he's trying to breathe
[1:30:47] so that daddy walked around the side of
[1:30:49] his little baby and said hello ricky
[1:30:51] daddy's little baby daddy's brought you
[1:30:53] to brother brannon to pray for you
[1:30:55] little baby recognized his father and it
[1:30:58] did not have any breathing up here so
[1:31:00] they had to cut a hole in his throat
[1:31:02] this little round whistle that we used
[1:31:05] to have for years ago that was in his
[1:31:06] throat
[1:31:07] he's catching its breath through that
[1:31:08] whistle and a nurse had to stay there
[1:31:10] all the time because the cancer was
[1:31:12] draining out of this little hole
[1:31:14] sounds terrible darn
[1:31:17] and the cancer was draining out of the
[1:31:19] from and from it and said the little
[1:31:20] arms wasn't splints and he couldn't
[1:31:22] catch it
[1:31:22] with with this with his hands to pull it
[1:31:24] out when it was so he couldn't pull it
[1:31:26] out
[1:31:26] he said the nurse was there all the time
[1:31:28] and started straining she'd reach up and
[1:31:30] take something and pull the cancer stuff
[1:31:31] out of that little whistle
[1:31:32] so he could breathe again his little
[1:31:35] hands like this reaching for his daddy
[1:31:38] he said you know i i just almost tore my
[1:31:41] heart apart
[1:31:43] as i was standing there i thought lord
[1:31:44] jesus if thou art the fountain of all
[1:31:48] sympathy and all mercy lays within you
[1:31:50] would you get any joy out of seeing this
[1:31:52] little dart and lay here like that
[1:31:55] i just can't believe i never will
[1:31:57] believe that this will be the will of
[1:31:59] almighty god to see
[1:32:00] such as this i thought you are the
[1:32:02] fountain of mercy
[1:32:04] and if you be the fountain of mercy then
[1:32:06] how would you or how could you be a
[1:32:08] merciful god enjoy seeing something like
[1:32:10] that
[1:32:11] what would you do if you were standing
[1:32:14] here
[1:32:18] he said i want to be honest when i meet
[1:32:20] god i want to meet him
[1:32:22] with an honest heart i've done the best
[1:32:24] i know how to do
[1:32:26] he said but when i said that something
[1:32:27] spoke down within me and said
[1:32:29] lord well as i said lord what would you
[1:32:31] do if you were standing here
[1:32:33] something spoke said and said i'm
[1:32:35] waiting to see what you'll do
[1:32:44] hello somebody i'm waiting to see what
[1:32:48] you will do
[1:32:50] and i looked at that little thing i took
[1:32:52] this little baby's hand not that wide
[1:32:54] and put in my fingers like this and held
[1:32:55] i said by
[1:32:56] faith in god i placed between this
[1:32:59] cancer
[1:33:00] and the baby the blood of the lord jesus
[1:33:03] christ
[1:33:03] and i turned around and walked out and
[1:33:05] the father came with me i just couldn't
[1:33:07] say no more
[1:33:08] i got in the car and he said brother
[1:33:10] branham here's a little titans i've been
[1:33:11] saving for i said i don't take that
[1:33:13] money put it on the baby's bill
[1:33:15] but within about two hours from that
[1:33:17] time the little jaw
[1:33:18] had gone back to normal the tongue had
[1:33:21] come back into his mouth
[1:33:22] and the loving mercy of the kind loving
[1:33:25] father
[1:33:26] had seen fit to heal the baby and the
[1:33:28] next morning
[1:33:29] the baby was going to be sent home a
[1:33:31] well baby
[1:33:39] that's the extreme deity of god
[1:33:43] and he has come down to show us his
[1:33:46] extreme deity
[1:33:50] that is the shame yesterday today and
[1:33:52] forever
[1:33:55] he'll tell again about how that little
[1:33:59] boy's brother came to him a little later
[1:34:02] jumped out of a station wagon tears
[1:34:04] running down his cheek
[1:34:06] jerked off his hat with his little
[1:34:07] finished wife standing there brother
[1:34:08] branham
[1:34:09] i come here to give you that ties again
[1:34:11] i said i said oh brother i don't want
[1:34:13] that he said you know ricky's going home

[1:34:15] i said i'm grateful for that but i told
[1:34:17] you to put that on ricky's bill
[1:34:19] that's just what i had to tell you about
[1:34:20] brother brad when i went to pay the
[1:34:22] doctor this morning to put that money
[1:34:24] over to him i said doctor
[1:34:26] i want to pay you some on the bill he
[1:34:27] said mister don't you even mention to me
[1:34:30] that anymore about that bill you don't
[1:34:31] owe me nothing that's the greatest thing
[1:34:34] i ever seen done in my life
[1:34:35] he said that's the phenomena of the
[1:34:37] phenomena
[1:34:39] you don't owe me a penny it just goes to
[1:34:42] show that the living god
[1:34:43] still lives he's come to show the
[1:34:47] phenomena
[1:34:48] of the phenomena the extreme of the
[1:34:50] extreme

[1:34:53] still the god who heals
[1:34:54] he's still the god who sets free he's
[1:34:56] still the god who brings life into a
[1:34:58] body

[1:35:01] but god is still on the throne
[1:35:05] and he's come down to show his deity his
[1:35:08] glory and his people
[1:35:15] we've seen it god move in impossible
[1:35:18] situations
[1:35:21] it would be a sin for us to disbelieve
[1:35:25] because we've seen god do some
[1:35:27] impossible things
[1:35:29] and i'd say he's not finished yet
[1:35:36] he's not gonna he's gonna get so extreme
[1:35:38] that one of these days
[1:35:40] these old bodies
[1:35:44] have been bound down by every pain and
[1:35:46] every kind of discomfort
[1:35:48] and every kind of thing and going slowly
[1:35:49] into a grave all of a sudden gonna come
[1:35:52] so extreme
[1:35:53] that god is gonna change every molecule
[1:35:56] change it all back to what it was
[1:35:57] supposed to be at the beginning
[1:35:59] he has come down in this hour to have a
[1:36:02] bribe without spot without wrinkle
[1:36:04] and he's going to fulfill that word they
[1:36:06] ain't a devil in hell there ain't enough
[1:36:07] devils that's going to stop it but
[1:36:09] there's going to be a bride that says
[1:36:11] yes lord

[1:36:14] they're going to let that deity
[1:36:15] begin to work in their lives until it
[1:36:17] heals the
[1:36:18] it raises the dead it changes lives it
[1:36:21] brings the prodigals home until it
[1:36:23] culminates

[2:09:30] they will be doing some tests tomorrow
[2:09:32] to
[2:09:33] try to discover uh and determine where
[2:09:36] they're coming from
[2:09:38] they will do some sonograms on the legs
[2:09:41] it will do
[2:09:41] a scope down her throat and
[2:09:45] take pictures inside there trying to
[2:09:48] figure out what well where this is
[2:09:51] coming from
[2:09:54] because of the
[2:09:57] because of the the brain bleed
[2:10:00] uh it could be dangerous to give her
[2:10:03] blood thinners
[2:10:04] could start new bleedings or the
[2:10:07] bleeding to start again
[2:10:10] and yet uh you know they
[2:10:14] they feel like they need something to to
[2:10:17] uh dissipate the clots
[2:10:20] so you know their wrists this ways and
[2:10:22] their wrists that ways and
[2:10:25] they they are back and forth on what to
[2:10:28] do
[2:10:29] and you know wanting me to make
[2:10:32] decisions on what to do and
[2:10:34] you know i need leadership from the lord
[2:10:38] as to and some guidance by the holy
[2:10:40] spirit
[2:10:41] we need god to undertake
[2:10:44] amen and god's still god
[2:10:47] you know i am satisfied and i know this
[2:10:50] if
[2:10:51] god gives us an answer of no and and he
[2:10:54] says it's her time upon earth
[2:10:56] i'm confident i know she's a child of
[2:11:00] god
[2:11:01] and i know god's got all it in control
[2:11:04] but i think tonight when we
[2:11:08] come before the throne of grace
[2:11:11] and we can come as children of the most
[2:11:13] high god
[2:11:15] we come boldly before the throne
[2:11:20] and tonight as we have been preaching
[2:11:22] and speaking about changing dimensions
[2:11:25] and
[2:11:26] transcending dimensions and the war that
[2:11:29] goes on
[2:11:30] into the heavenly realms and we also
[2:11:34] know that we are seated
[2:11:36] with power and authority
[2:11:39] we know our position in christ and we
[2:11:42] know we're seated
[2:11:43] with him so we have a right to come
[2:11:47] before the throne of grace to find help
[2:11:50] in our time of need
[2:11:53] 2 000 years ago my lord was beat
[2:11:57] and his head that no doubt had
[2:12:00] [Music]
[2:12:01] concussions and bleeds
[2:12:06] and all kinds of things that were going
[2:12:08] on
[2:12:11] he did this as a man that he might
[2:12:14] be able to sit as a man and we could
[2:12:17] approach him
[2:12:18] as a man so man would not come and
[2:12:22] approach a god that has never felt
[2:12:25] pain and never felt sorrow never felt
[2:12:29] problems
[2:12:30] but we can find somebody that is
[2:12:32] compassionate
[2:12:33] that went through what we go through the
[2:12:36] bible said he was a man of sorrows he
[2:12:38] was acquainted with grief in other words
[2:12:40] he was familiar with pain
[2:12:44] he was familiar he knows what we go
[2:12:48] through we as the children of god
[2:12:51] right now in our closing prayer tonight
[2:12:56] we are moving beyond
[2:12:59] this building we're moving in realms
[2:13:03] beyond here and by faith
[2:13:07] we're approaching the ivory throne
[2:13:10] where that he sits there as the high
[2:13:13] priest
[2:13:15] who can be touched with how we feel
[2:13:21] i want you to carry your feelings to
[2:13:23] there
[2:13:25] we're the bride of christ
[2:13:28] esther you have a right to go before the
[2:13:33] king
[2:13:33] [Music]
[2:13:36] you don't have to be scared i'm afraid
[2:13:38] you have a right
[2:13:39] to approach the throne the scepter has
[2:13:43] already been held out
[2:13:45] you're walking there and you're telling
[2:13:48] what wicked haman has been doing
[2:13:53] amen you tell him
[2:13:56] this wicked haman
[2:14:00] this weekend heyman is doing this to
[2:14:02] your children
