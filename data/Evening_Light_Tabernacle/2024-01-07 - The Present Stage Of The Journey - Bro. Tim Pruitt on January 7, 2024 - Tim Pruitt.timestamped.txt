[55:48] Jesus I wouldn't know what to do without
[55:51] him today we have many many many that
[55:55] are sick not able to be in service with

[56:01] love to be
[56:02] here and I send my greetings out to them
[56:05] in our new year service today first
[56:08] service that I will speak this
[56:11] month and to you of course the seen
[56:15] audience kind of takes me back to maybe
[56:19] the early 90s or something as far as our
[56:22] congregation size
[56:25] but you
[56:27] know it really doesn't matter how many
[56:29] that there are is this two or three he
[56:33] said I'll be there in the
[56:35] midst and I tell you what I promised him
[56:38] a long time ago that I'd do my best no
[56:42] matter what kind of what size audience
[56:45] it
[56:46] was I remember preaching over
[56:48] Mississippi to a group of I think there
[56:51] were eight of us and I was one of the
[56:53] eight my wife was is also
[56:56] present and so I guess I was preaching
[56:59] to
[57:00] six you know cuz we as far as someone
[57:05] knew but
[57:07] anyway I preach just like I'd preach too
[57:11] a thousand cuz I figured if God couldn't
[57:14] trust me to do my best with eight he
[57:17] sure couldn't trust me to do my best
[57:19] with a
[57:21] thousand see you know the numbers
[57:23] doesn't matter what matters is this he's
[57:27] present and he's able to meet your need
[57:30] I'm speaking to people today around the
[57:33] world and some of them are just little
[57:35] family units some of them are you know
[57:40] large family units are single people
[57:44] some of them are in
[57:46] situations their churches and such a
[57:49] terrible shape they can't go there no
[57:51] more they got despotic par pastors that
[57:54] are abusive and they can't go preaching
[57:58] false doctrines I hear from them and
[58:02] they said brother Tim you know we
[58:04] receive strength from what you
[58:07] preach you know I I'm sorry they're in
[58:09] that condition I I'm sorry that there
[58:11] are trouble like that in the world but
[58:15] all we're wanting to do today is come in
[58:19] by the Holy Spirit and bring them a word
[58:21] of encouragement to lift them up to
[58:24] encourage enourage the bride of Christ
[58:25] wherever they are to just get in Step
[58:29] just get in Step God's moving he's doing
[58:32] wonderful things I've got a couple of
[58:34] prayer requests or actually prayer clo
[58:37] one's I'm going to be sending to sister
[58:40] a sister in
[58:42] Trinidad sister CA she has a need her
[58:46] foot won't heal she listens to our
[58:50] services there from Trinidad and
[58:53] there's there's another a little sister
[58:55] Maria that you heard from Finland a
[58:58] mother her husband and her have both
[59:01] desperately reached out to her for to us
[59:04] for her she's got a fighting anxiety and
[59:09] can't sleep at night
[59:11] and an awful oppression of the
[59:15] enemy the children of God shouldn't have
[59:18] to go through those kind of things not
[59:21] when we got a Healer like we do a
[59:23] deliver like we have and I believe we
[59:26] can believe the prayer of faith today
[59:29] that when these prayer cloths are laid
[59:30] on them that they will be healed I'm
[59:34] going to say the same thing to you our
[59:36] church family that is listening in that
[59:38] can't be here

[59:43] a loved one can just lay hands on you or
[59:46] someone nearby or maybe you're by
[59:48] yourself whatever may God lay his hand
[59:51] on you and today May healing virtues
[59:54] flow from the throne of grace father in
[59:56] the name of Jesus thou knowest every
[1:00:00] need that would be among us we're just
[1:00:03] asking Lord that you would just come

[1:00:10] passion your suffering that you did for
[1:00:12] us on the cross for we know Lord that
[1:00:15] you paid for this foot condition when
[1:00:19] those nails were put in your feet we
[1:00:22] know Lord when you were beaten and a
[1:00:24] crown of thorns put on your head that
[1:00:27] all of the fear and anxiety problems and
[1:00:30] everything else you paid for it Lord we
[1:00:33] know oh God when you took the stripes
[1:00:35] upon your body that you paid for every
[1:00:38] need that there could be whether it be
[1:00:40] from cancer to covid to flu to RSV to
[1:00:46] weakness whatever it is and we bind the
[1:00:49] power of the enemy today in the name of
[1:00:52] Jesus Christ and as we send out these
[1:00:55] paraca to this these ones in Trinidad
[1:00:59] and Finland Lord may we hear back from

[1:01:57] verses there in the scripture you're
[1:02:00] going to be seeing on the screen to King
[1:02:02] James I'm using a little different
[1:02:04] version but you know it's the word of
[1:02:07] God the word of God is the word of God
[1:02:09] no matter if we say it or paraphrase it
[1:02:12] or or whatever you know it's the word of
[1:02:15] God is still prevails it's the truth
[1:02:18] that we're looking there in the word
[1:02:21] amen so if you will turn with me to
[1:02:23] Psalms chapter 62 we're going to read
[1:02:27] from verse one there and um we uh trust
[1:02:31] the Lord will bless us today amen we
[1:02:35] want to welcome each one of you in the

[1:03:01] who holds our hand amen asking God's
[1:03:05] blessings amen upon you all amen um

[1:03:20] you say Amen to that he alone is my Rock
[1:03:24] in my salvation my Fortress where I Will
[1:03:28] Never Be
[1:03:30] Shaken amen that reminds me of Psalms 27
[1:03:34] where brother Brandon pulled the Rapture
[1:03:36] sermon from and you know of of there
[1:03:39] being our Fortress and our rock verse
[1:03:42] three so many enemies against one man
[1:03:46] all of them trying to kill me to them
[1:03:50] I'm just a broken down wall or a
[1:03:53] tottering fence
[1:03:55] now that's what they think but our
[1:03:57] Fortress is the Lord they plan to topple
[1:04:01] me from my high position they Delight in
[1:04:04] telling lies about me they praise me to
[1:04:07] their face but curse me in their
[1:04:10] hearts let all that I am wait quietly
[1:04:15] before God for my hope is in him he
[1:04:19] alone is my rock and my salvation my
[1:04:23] Fortress

[1:04:28] and Honor come from God Alone he is my
[1:04:33] refuge a rock where no enemy can reach
[1:04:38] me oh my people trust in him at all
[1:04:43] times pour out your hearts to him for
[1:04:46] God is our refuge verse
[1:04:51] 11 God has spoken plainly and I've heard
[1:04:55] it many times power oh God belongs to
[1:04:59] you unfailing love oh Lord is yours

[1:05:08] what they have
[1:05:09] done amen God bless you you can be
[1:05:14] seated for my New Year's message this
[1:05:18] morning I would like to address you as a
[1:05:22] part of the bride of Christ those of you
[1:05:25] that are assembled here today and those
[1:05:27] of you that are watching online our
[1:05:30] church local our church online and those
[1:05:33] around the world those that are viewing
[1:05:37] this service today and you know when we
[1:05:41] I will speak I I kind of like to do this
[1:05:46] sometimes on the first of the year much
[1:05:49] like um in our country we have the State
[1:05:51] of the Union Address and there will be
[1:05:55] an address from our president that will
[1:05:57] tell us the the State of the Union as he
[1:06:00] sees it and I think of that many times
[1:06:05] as I approach um a New Year's message
[1:06:08] like I have today is not not so much a
[1:06:12] state of the union of the United States
[1:06:15] but of course um the the state of where
[1:06:20] we are in the journey you know as a
[1:06:24] calendar would turn we we'll often look
[1:06:27] at it and we we kind of like to know
[1:06:30] what just lies
[1:06:31] ahead you know I uh have had opportunity
[1:06:36] a lot of times to sit down with Elders
[1:06:39] um and and here try to get wisdom from
[1:06:43] them and say what do you expect what do
[1:06:47] we look for and today I'm going to be
[1:06:52] speaking to you on this present state
[1:06:54] stage of the
[1:06:55] journey and I I want to just picture
[1:06:59] this as if we are traveling along and
[1:07:02] like many times with my family that we
[1:07:05] would do and the kids were little and
[1:07:07] all be in the car and you know the
[1:07:10] journey would get long and it would be
[1:07:13] wearisome and uh you know everybody was
[1:07:17] ready to get to where we were going and
[1:07:21] we would hear the the I would hear the
[1:07:24] children pipe up someone in the back and
[1:07:27] say Daddy how much
[1:07:31] farther or maybe another and say are we
[1:07:34] there
[1:07:36] yet and you know we as we look at this
[1:07:43] today I think that is naturally some of
[1:07:46] our questions as we come upon this
[1:07:51] journey and of course you could say say
[1:07:54] in one way we have been journeying as a
[1:07:57] people since Eden and another way is
[1:07:59] chrisom we have been journeying since
[1:08:03] Pentecost and and um and of course and
[1:08:07] as us as message Believers we can look
[1:08:10] at different landmarks and places of
[1:08:12] where we have been in the journey maybe
[1:08:17] where maybe where you joined in as it
[1:08:20] were a bus going down and you got on it
[1:08:23] a certain stop and of course we know
[1:08:26] along some of those stops some got off
[1:08:29] and some went on to their reward and
[1:08:31] others went off and found a place back
[1:08:34] out in the world that suited them
[1:08:37] better and you know but anyway
[1:08:40] nevertheless we have a
[1:08:42] Destiny and there is an end to the
[1:08:45] journey and that end is coming
[1:08:47] up and and of course we are looking to
[1:08:51] know where are we in this Journey just
[1:08:54] how much further do we have to go and I
[1:08:58] look over and see some of you that are
[1:09:00] past 70 and and and you've reached your
[1:09:04] three scoring 10 and um you know you you
[1:09:08] know there's not much time left in your
[1:09:11] journey here upon the Earth and um and
[1:09:15] of course as we look here we know also
[1:09:19] you could be just a young person maybe a
[1:09:22] teenager or whatever that you know we
[1:09:25] have been along long long enough to know
[1:09:28] that it's not just the old that goes on
[1:09:31] but teenagers and sometimes children and
[1:09:35] sometimes um you know young mothers or
[1:09:37] dads or whatever you know there there's
[1:09:40] there's there's trouble and strife and
[1:09:43] things that happens along life's journey
[1:09:45] and of course part of that is just being
[1:09:48] human because we are should I say Mortal
[1:09:52] because of the IM mortality that was
[1:09:55] forced upon us because of Adam's
[1:09:59] decision now as far as a world that we
[1:10:02] live
[1:10:03] in you can certainly see the bills are
[1:10:06] coming due in
[1:10:09] 2024 a lot of bills are coming du the
[1:10:12] debts are high and they have put them
[1:10:15] off as far as they can and we have spent
[1:10:18] until the death ceiling has reached
[1:10:21] limits that is UN
[1:10:24] imaginable and the debts that we have
[1:10:26] made in society uh two will have to be
[1:10:30] paid and many of them will be paid this
[1:10:34] year experts are
[1:10:37] predicting um bank failures and a great
[1:10:41] reset um that you know that your money
[1:10:44] will be more devalued and will buy less
[1:10:48] and all the time uh causing hardships
[1:10:52] upon you housing experts are predicting
[1:10:56] a housing crash that it can't continue
[1:11:00] to keep going higher and higher and
[1:11:02] higher that at some point there has to
[1:11:04] be a correction and comes things come
[1:11:07] back to more of a re more realistic um
[1:11:12] figure and and of course when we look at
[1:11:15] at the world that we live in um with uh
[1:11:20] the the the world conditions we have a
[1:11:24] weak America we have a China that is
[1:11:27] ready to pounce on Taiwan and and claim
[1:11:31] it for their own and then we have Israel
[1:11:35] right now in the Middle East that is
[1:11:38] that is clawing through another
[1:11:40] attempted Holocaust and trying to root
[1:11:43] out an enemy that they had turned a
[1:11:45] blind eye
[1:11:47] to in in hopes of achieving a peace but
[1:11:52] it was a false hope
[1:11:54] and then we have Iran that is um poised
[1:11:57] to finish uh its Atomic weaponry and has
[1:12:01] proxy Fighters employed everywhere and
[1:12:05] um you have um them with their proxy
[1:12:08] Fighters the the hooes and whatever
[1:12:11] sending their bombs and sending their
[1:12:14] drones and stopping ships and the and
[1:12:18] and commerce and and uh threatening
[1:12:21] World Peace then we have Russia that is
[1:12:25] angry about America's proxy war used in
[1:12:29] Ukraine and and um they're they're angry
[1:12:33] and and they're they're making their
[1:12:37] moves and they also uh there will be M
[1:12:41] much much debt to be paid coming up in
[1:12:45] this year 2024 is another election year
[1:12:49] and America is so divided that no matter
[1:12:52] who win
[1:12:54] there will be the chance of a Civil War
[1:12:57] I don't know how big or how small but
[1:13:00] you know there's going to be somebody
[1:13:01] unhappy no matter who wins and and to do
[1:13:06] there will be
[1:13:07] disruption when this day the right is
[1:13:10] vilified by the left and the left has
[1:13:12] gained dominance and you have you know
[1:13:16] the the the stoking of racial fires
[1:13:19] until the blacks threaten the whites and
[1:13:21] the whites threaten the blacks and no
[1:13:24] and and nobody likes the
[1:13:25] Asians and then you have the the gays
[1:13:28] who threaten those who are straight and
[1:13:31] Sodom has become embolden and
[1:13:34] transgenders announc that they're coming
[1:13:36] after your
[1:13:38] kids and so you know it's um it's a very
[1:13:42] treacherous time in this journey you
[1:13:44] know it's kind of like um in the journey
[1:13:47] you're passing through a bad
[1:13:49] neighborhood and and you're you're
[1:13:53] you're
[1:13:54] everywhere that you look there is
[1:13:56] Calamity from hijackings and threats of
[1:14:00] of rioting on the streets or boycotts or
[1:14:04] this or that or the other and you know
[1:14:06] it's all that's going on as we look
[1:14:09] around and and we wonder sometimes you
[1:14:12] know that we can't help but breathe
[1:14:14] where are we at in this
[1:14:18] journey and I think in Isaiah 21 And1 um
[1:14:23] there was there was the prophet Isaiah
[1:14:26] who said the burden of Duma he calleth
[1:14:30] me out of sear Watchman what of the
[1:14:32] night Watchman what of the night and the
[1:14:36] Watchman said the morning cometh and
[1:14:39] also the night if you will inquire
[1:14:42] inquire return come and of course as
[1:14:46] we're looking around it's getting darker
[1:14:48] and darker as there is approaching
[1:14:52] danger and hell itself is coming here
[1:14:55] upon the Earth getting ready for the
[1:14:58] actual coming of its king which will be
[1:15:02] cast out of Heaven amen and come down to
[1:15:05] the Earth knowing that it has but a
[1:15:08] short time you know here again brother
[1:15:10] brandham saw it in the vision coming um
[1:15:14] as uh he saw it um visualized in that
[1:15:19] Vision materialized in a giant mamba
[1:15:22] snake and the whole world was shaking
[1:15:25] under its
[1:15:27] influence and even here in America that
[1:15:30] was once the beacon of
[1:15:32] Christianity and freedom is now
[1:15:35] dying and and it has been bitten by the
[1:15:39] snake as it were and the whole world is
[1:15:42] shaking and and the civilization that
[1:15:45] you live in is crumbling around you
[1:15:47] because it's
[1:15:49] dying and and and of course we long for
[1:15:53] the day that somebody might see its head
[1:15:57] finally
[1:15:58] crushed and that the dead in Christ will
[1:16:01] rise for their bodies are still even
[1:16:04] today held under the curse and
[1:16:08] Decay and we long to be among those as
[1:16:11] we sigh oh to be among those who are
[1:16:15] alive and remain to the coming of the
[1:16:18] Lord so you see we could go on our after
[1:16:23] hour painting this picture and knowing
[1:16:26] that all the prophets prophesied to this
[1:16:29] day and and we we hear the it screamed
[1:16:34] out Watchmen what the night and yet the
[1:16:38] Pentagon doesn't have an answer the
[1:16:40] United States and our government has no
[1:16:43] answer uh no matter who you get in or
[1:16:46] who you elect they cannot they cannot
[1:16:50] find the solution to the world's trouble
[1:16:53] that we're in we whether it's our allies
[1:16:57] in Germany or our perceived enemies in
[1:17:00] Russia none of them have the answer
[1:17:04] science does not have the answer they
[1:17:07] have even in in in our days released
[1:17:11] from their Laboratories their
[1:17:13] experiments that has has brought to us
[1:17:16] horrible diseases of covid that killed
[1:17:19] millions and wrecked
[1:17:22] economies and they don't have the answer
[1:17:25] and and but I want you to know there the
[1:17:28] real true Watchman is the Holy Spirit
[1:17:33] and he has the
[1:17:35] answer and we we can cry out to him
[1:17:38] Watchman what of the
[1:17:40] night and I want you to know the
[1:17:43] Watchman on the wall says it is time to
[1:17:47] go up we are nearing the end of the
[1:17:51] journey and you as a people are under an
[1:17:54] eagle
[1:17:56] anointing and it is time that you leave
[1:17:59] the nest that you get out of your
[1:18:02] comfort zone and you fly and spread your
[1:18:05] wings and
[1:18:07] fly into into the Realms of the Blessed
[1:18:11] where all things are possible where the
[1:18:14] Supernatural is real to you and you
[1:18:18] experience it yourself and a people that
[1:18:22] know their God do
[1:18:24] exploits of course we know as an eagle
[1:18:28] that an eagle flies higher than most
[1:18:31] other birds he's built for the heights
[1:18:34] he's special built for the altitude that
[1:18:37] he flies in and I want you to know that
[1:18:40] God has equipped you as we walk on this
[1:18:45] journey and seemingly in snail Pace that
[1:18:48] we're about to take an astronaut ride
[1:18:52] and leave the real that we are in
[1:18:55] because the end of this road you know
[1:18:58] ends all of the
[1:19:19] walkingspree muching dangers and today
[1:19:23] God still has Eagles we can we can go
[1:19:26] back and re we can reference and we will
[1:19:28] of course the great prophet before us of
[1:19:31] brother brandham for our age and we will
[1:19:33] also reference some great men like
[1:19:36] Isaiah or Jeremiah or the different ones
[1:19:40] you know because they are they were
[1:19:42] Eagles and they had spiritual eyes and
[1:19:45] they prophesied of the day that we're
[1:19:48] living in to kind of give us an idea of
[1:19:51] where we are in time that's right and
[1:19:55] today God still has Eagles Messengers
[1:19:57] men on the tower who climb up to the
[1:20:01] spirit that is far above where atomic
[1:20:04] bombs can go or scientific researches a
[1:20:07] man that is specially designed for a
[1:20:11] purpose amen men of God anointed men who
[1:20:16] can climb the ramp parts of Calvary in
[1:20:19] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:20:22] stand back on the top of the Cross and
[1:20:24] can send back a message God has said
[1:20:28] this this is his word here is his
[1:20:32] promise amen that there is a rock that
[1:20:35] we can stand on when all the trouble is
[1:20:38] all around us that we can have a
[1:20:41] consolation that he has not left us but
[1:20:44] he is with us for he said I'll be with
[1:20:47] you even in you to the end of the world
[1:20:50] I can hear brother bradam say oh listen
[1:20:52] listen to thus sayith the Lord if you
[1:20:54] consider me to be his servant it's just
[1:20:57] before the day of bre break of day and
[1:20:59] that is why the horrible Gloom is over
[1:21:02] the Earth it's just before the coming of
[1:21:05] the Lord Jesus and there's no more hope
[1:21:08] left in nothing but his
[1:21:10] coming nations are against Nations they
[1:21:14] have fooled with God's laboratory till
[1:21:16] they got power to break below one
[1:21:19] another into Atomic ashes and they're
[1:21:22] Wicked they're unreligious they're un
[1:21:25] Christlike and the only motive they have
[1:21:27] and the only objective is to destroy and
[1:21:30] they're inspired by the destroying angel
[1:21:32] that was sent down from heaven to
[1:21:34] inspire these men and let me say in the
[1:21:37] name of the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit
[1:21:40] has sent as a Watchman on the tower and
[1:21:43] as the people cry what of the night are
[1:21:46] you weary of this life are you weary of
[1:21:49] sin are you weary of funeral sessions
[1:21:53] and are you weary of sickness and
[1:21:55] ungodliness on every hand has the night
[1:21:59] been long and weary what of the night
[1:22:03] Watchman and he says the morning cometh
[1:22:07] see the Comfort the night also what is
[1:22:10] the night Watchman what are the night
[1:22:12] what's going to happen here it is total
[1:22:16] Annihilation is coming to the whole
[1:22:18] world but before that Annihilation takes
[1:22:21] place the church of Jesus Christ will go
[1:22:24] in the Rapture to meet our
[1:22:26] Lord what a promise that is what a
[1:22:31] consolation I think I'm preaching to a
[1:22:33] people today that we are weary we are
[1:22:36] weary of burying loved ones we're weary
[1:22:40] of the toil we're weary of the long
[1:22:43] night we're weary of of of church ages
[1:22:47] and and just uh you know that God send a
[1:22:50] messenger and they fall away and go back
[1:22:52] and the cycle of Revival and death so
[1:22:55] you don't continue on we're weary of it
[1:22:57] all we're tired of it we're saying God
[1:23:00] where are we at this journey how much
[1:23:03] further that we got to go how much
[1:23:06] longer
[1:23:07] Lord I think it must be that way I think
[1:23:10] there must be a people that are crying
[1:23:12] out in their hearts even so come Lord
[1:23:16] Jesus Hallelujah now Daniel looked at
[1:23:19] his prophecy too and as he pondered the
[1:23:23] present stage of his journey if you'll
[1:23:27] turn with me to Daniel chapter 9 and
[1:23:29] verse 2 we used Daniel as a reference in
[1:23:33] the first re year of his Reign I Daniel
[1:23:37] understood by books now I want you to
[1:23:41] notice he didn't get a love story
[1:23:44] magazine I want you to notice it's not a
[1:23:47] fiction story he wasn't he wasn't into
[1:23:51] Zang Grant or whoever I don't know what
[1:23:53] their names are but anyway he went into
[1:23:56] none of them he says you know I Daniel
[1:23:59] understood my books what was he looking
[1:24:01] at he was looking at the word of the
[1:24:05] Prophet look where unto the word of the
[1:24:08] Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that
[1:24:11] he would accomplish 70 years in the
[1:24:14] desolation of Jerusalem and I set my
[1:24:17] face unto the Lord God to seek my prayer
[1:24:20] and supplications with fasting and
[1:24:22] sackcloth and Isis now Daniel was among
[1:24:26] the Hebrews that were taken down to
[1:24:29] Babylon you know Daniel had not done
[1:24:33] evil you can see from his life he was a
[1:24:37] sincere believer in
[1:24:39] Jehovah early on he would refuse to eat
[1:24:42] the king's meat to pollute himself with
[1:24:45] the Pok the pork and the uncleanliness
[1:24:48] of the meats that they were forbidden to
[1:24:50] and meat that would not been uh that was
[1:24:53] not Kosher and and so you you know from
[1:24:56] early on you can see his life and his
[1:24:59] testimony he had been a Believer all
[1:25:01] that time but he too was taken
[1:25:04] captive he too his hands were tied
[1:25:06] behind his back and stripped and taken
[1:25:09] down to Babylon he too would would see
[1:25:13] the atrocities of relatives and friends
[1:25:16] and loved ones slaughtered and
[1:25:18] killed and and and and Friends brothers
[1:25:22] sisters taken prisoner and taken down to
[1:25:27] Babylon now Babylon had a a way of doing
[1:25:31] things they they the way that they would
[1:25:33] control a region is they would upright
[1:25:36] the population and would move them here
[1:25:38] and move them there and whatever so that
[1:25:40] they would not be in their Homeland
[1:25:43] because in their Homeland they would
[1:25:45] have
[1:25:45] strength they would have courage and
[1:25:48] would fight for their Homeland but if
[1:25:49] you take them out that they're part of
[1:25:51] Babylon
[1:25:52] and it's here down in Babylon that they
[1:25:54] would actually wouldn't have a temple
[1:25:56] and they would start their synagogues
[1:25:58] and their Pharisee worship and all the
[1:26:01] other things that would come as they
[1:26:03] would adapt to Babylonian culture and it
[1:26:07] would be that many of them would go down
[1:26:09] into Chala into Babylon and would never
[1:26:12] return they would always live down there
[1:26:16] and they they would say I can serve
[1:26:18] Jehovah there I don't have to go back to
[1:26:20] the Homeland that becomes the attitude
[1:26:23] of a lot of people today we can serve
[1:26:26] the Lord where we at we don't have to go
[1:26:28] back to the homeland of the Bible we
[1:26:31] don't have to return to the book of Acts
[1:26:33] we we don't have to go back to to the
[1:26:36] worship uh you know where God chose to
[1:26:38] put his name we can worship anywhere we
[1:26:41] can do our own
[1:26:43] thing
[1:26:45] yes but when I think about Daniel a man
[1:26:49] who had not sinned a man who had not
[1:26:52] done evil a man who was righteous but he
[1:26:55] had to suffer with the
[1:27:01] wicked sometimes things seems
[1:27:04] unfair why is it Lord I've tried so
[1:27:08] hard I've done everything I can you know
[1:27:11] I served you here I am a prisoner down
[1:27:14] in
[1:27:15] Babylon here I am taken from my
[1:27:18] home here I am and he determines and as
[1:27:22] heart I'm going to serve God no matter
[1:27:24] where I'm
[1:27:29] at this
[1:27:31] nation we will suffer in this
[1:27:34] nation Christians will suffer because of
[1:27:37] the unrighteousness and
[1:27:39] politics and it'll make the whole nation
[1:27:43] suffer and this was from nothing he did
[1:27:46] but rather judgment was upon the nation
[1:27:48] of Israel and because of their sins
[1:27:52] righteous men like Daniel Hebrew
[1:27:54] children Shadrach mesach and Abednego
[1:27:57] was bound taken down into
[1:28:00] Babylon here he was separated from his
[1:28:02] people separated from his church think
[1:28:05] about that not one church service to go
[1:28:07] to maybe like some of you sitting there
[1:28:11] in your home today and there's no place
[1:28:13] to go no hymns to be sang but what he's
[1:28:17] saying to himself yet he still held on
[1:28:21] to what the prophet said While others
[1:28:24] were worshiping foreign Gods you know he
[1:28:27] held on and he said I I I want to search
[1:28:30] the
[1:28:30] message I want to go back and look and
[1:28:33] see what the prophet said let's see what
[1:28:36] Jeremiah said you know we're nearing the
[1:28:39] time and I tell you if there was ever a
[1:28:41] time that we ought to be into the word
[1:28:44] of God and seeking it out it's right now
[1:28:46] in this hour it's the hour of more
[1:28:50] consecration of Mer
[1:28:52] dedication because we know we're at a
[1:28:56] junction being taken away from his home
[1:28:59] now nearly 70 years remember 70 years
[1:29:03] was approaching if he was if he was 14
[1:29:06] when he was taken away he was now 84
[1:29:10] years old or there about you know here
[1:29:14] here he was and he goes and he
[1:29:17] looks
[1:29:18] having into the book he want to see what
[1:29:22] is it how many days will it be before
[1:29:25] all this is accomplished and the same is
[1:29:28] true today we are looking back we're
[1:29:31] searching the books I don't know I don't
[1:29:33] know about you but you know it's kind of
[1:29:37] like my kids my children along the
[1:29:39] journey daddy where are we how much more
[1:29:41] time how how many more miles of course
[1:29:45] we didn't have je GPS you know with an
[1:29:47] ETA so we look at the road mapap and
[1:29:50] said well it looks like if if I can read
[1:29:54] the figures right on this map we got we
[1:29:57] got another hour and I you know and
[1:30:00] there could be delays and there could be
[1:30:02] situations rise we don't know exactly
[1:30:06] what minute it'll be but we're headed
[1:30:08] that
[1:30:09] way just just hold on children we're
[1:30:12] going to get there after a while and so
[1:30:15] you know again that today we're we're
[1:30:17] looking back we're searching the books
[1:30:20] we're reading the road map
[1:30:22] we and we see we are now approaching a
[1:30:26] great Junction like I said there's a lot
[1:30:28] of deaths that has to be
[1:30:31] paid Daniel made himself ready he was
[1:30:34] starting a fast he was sanctifying
[1:30:37] himself and he sought the Lord knowing
[1:30:39] the Fulfillment of the promise through
[1:30:41] near and he didn't want to miss
[1:30:45] it he's saying God what must I do next
[1:30:50] for we're now at end time and that's
[1:30:53] what I say today God where are we where
[1:30:57] where do we go next we're nearing the
[1:30:59] shore the day that we're living in shows
[1:31:03] every sign is pointing to the coming of
[1:31:06] the Lord oh I can go back and consult
[1:31:09] the books Let's go and let's turn as it
[1:31:12] were uh turning the book and and and of
[1:31:15] course this is not in the Bible it's in
[1:31:17] the sermon desperation oh
[1:31:20] church he screams out rise and Shake
[1:31:23] Yourself and pinch your conscience wake
[1:31:27] yourself up in this hour we must be
[1:31:30] desperate or perish there is coming
[1:31:33] forth something from the Lord and I know
[1:31:35] it is dust say the Lord there's coming
[1:31:38] for something and we better get
[1:31:40] desperate it's between life and death
[1:31:42] it'll pass through us and we won't see
[1:31:46] it it's very important we note the
[1:31:49] signpost along the road
[1:31:54] some of the
[1:31:55] signpost that identifies where we're at
[1:31:59] as we see the cooling off among
[1:32:03] Christians we see the Church of the
[1:32:06] Living God becoming
[1:32:08] indifferent becoming infatuated with the
[1:32:11] world and losing its love for
[1:32:14] Christ we we see even among Mage
[1:32:17] Believers becoming so denominational
[1:32:20] minded and drawing up its
[1:32:23] barriers until you
[1:32:26] know it ought to be seen as Milestones
[1:32:30] to let us know we're getting close to
[1:32:34] the end of the
[1:32:35] road when we see even our message
[1:32:39] becoming more and more denominational
[1:32:42] eyes with with little Jerusalem's here
[1:32:45] or there where you got to come because
[1:32:48] this is where that you must be to make
[1:32:50] the Rapture in this certain church or
[1:32:52] this certain group of people I I want
[1:32:55] you to know you know I want you to know
[1:32:58] as we look into that for a moment it's a
[1:33:01] Milestones to tell you that that even
[1:33:05] the movement that we have been in as
[1:33:08] what we call the message is a dying
[1:33:11] movement now I know that'll make a lot
[1:33:13] of people angry but it's a dying
[1:33:16] movement the throws of death is upon it
[1:33:21] and see moves more and more toward
[1:33:23] denominational
[1:33:25] mindedness you know the and and I want
[1:33:28] to I want to deal with this for a moment
[1:33:30] because here we are I want to just point
[1:33:33] out some of the signs as we pass by see
[1:33:36] this sign here says we are at this place
[1:33:40] and so from here you know from here we
[1:33:43] got to go go further from here and and
[1:33:46] and we don't want to stop here so you
[1:33:49] know if you look in Revelation chap 3
[1:33:51] 314 and I and and read of the leoan age
[1:33:55] and we're not going to actually read it
[1:33:57] but I want you to remember this as we
[1:34:00] look at this
[1:34:01] Milestone this Milestone says that the
[1:34:05] church would become
[1:34:07] lukewarm that it would deal with with
[1:34:10] horrible situations thinking it's rich
[1:34:13] and increased goods and having a need of
[1:34:16] nothing and yet would not know his
[1:34:18] spiritual poverty it would give to the
[1:34:22] point that it would actually put Christ
[1:34:24] on the outside where he would actually
[1:34:27] be be um uh standing on the outside of
[1:34:31] the church knocking trying to get in you
[1:34:35] know again we we look back and we can
[1:34:38] say yes the Methodist did it yes the
[1:34:42] nazarenes did it yes the bilol did it
[1:34:46] yes the isusa street movement did it but
[1:34:50] you realize the last rejection of Christ
[1:34:54] will be among those who claim this
[1:35:00] messag I want that to sink
[1:35:04] in the Bible declares that before he's
[1:35:07] coming there will be a great fall in the
[1:35:11] way well yeah there's certainly been a
[1:35:14] great fall the Virgin that started out
[1:35:17] has defiled herself with other lovers
[1:35:19] and she is called in the Bible the Great
[1:35:21] and if that's not b bad enough
[1:35:25] she's influenced her daughters and her
[1:35:27] daughters are who came out of
[1:35:29] Catholicism are called harlots and yeah
[1:35:32] that's a terrible
[1:35:33] fall amen but yet I want to say you can
[1:35:37] still even though that is true you can
[1:35:41] still expect to fall in the way not just
[1:35:43] the fall of those who have now denounced
[1:35:46] the message and have went out into the
[1:35:49] world or joined themselves with the
[1:35:51] Harlot system or maybe got re-baptized
[1:35:54] into titles to their
[1:35:58] shame amen but but but those but those
[1:36:02] who still cling to the prophet of
[1:36:06] Malachi 4 will actually reject
[1:36:09] Christ they will be ashamed of the Holy
[1:36:13] Ghost they will become ashamed and
[1:36:15] embarrassed of Holy Ghost meetings they
[1:36:19] will be embarrassed to see the word
[1:36:21] bring forth acts 238 tongu speaking
[1:36:26] youngans of course the bride won't fall
[1:36:30] away but the mixed multitude among her
[1:36:33] will they will make captains to go back
[1:36:35] to
[1:36:36] Egypt I you know I've read I've read in
[1:36:40] the
[1:36:41] books and I'm telling you from what I've
[1:36:44] read in the books as Daniel read of
[1:36:48] Jeremiah I read of the prophet of the
[1:36:50] last day and one of the last sermons
[1:36:53] that he preaches to us is ashamed of him
[1:36:55] and I read in the books that many will
[1:36:58] become ashamed of him that many will
[1:37:01] scorn a church filled with the spirit
[1:37:05] they will reject the gifts of God even
[1:37:09] to the point of not just the nine
[1:37:11] spiritual gifts but even reject the
[1:37:14] ministerial Gifts of Ephesians 4 they
[1:37:17] will not want the moving of the spirit
[1:37:20] they will preach against it and will
[1:37:23] crucify Christ from their pulpits they
[1:37:27] will call the Revival he sends a false
[1:37:31] Revival they will mock with scorn those
[1:37:35] who receive the word with joy as David
[1:37:39] did uh in his day and then they will be
[1:37:43] like the daughter of Saul maau as she as
[1:37:47] she she looked upon David as he danced
[1:37:50] before the Lord and he was dancing not
[1:37:53] just out of an emotion or just some
[1:37:56] little Joy or just cuz he was happy that
[1:37:58] day but because the word was
[1:38:02] returning amen and it was not because of
[1:38:05] his dancing and shouting that Aza died
[1:38:09] the reason Aza died was because because
[1:38:12] David had brought it on the oxcart like
[1:38:15] the Philistines had done not in God's
[1:38:18] provided way on the
[1:38:19] Levites the shoulders of the Levites and
[1:38:23] because it was not brought by God's
[1:38:25] ordained way because he failed to
[1:38:27] consult the word before trying to bring
[1:38:29] the word back the ark back and me death
[1:38:32] struck and it always will the word has
[1:38:36] to be carried on the shoulders of the
[1:38:39] Levites and as David danced before the
[1:38:42] Lord because the word was now returning
[1:38:46] because there was a restoration taking
[1:38:48] place then is the daughter of Saul
[1:38:52] looked upon her upon him saying David
[1:38:55] you're too childish you're too immature
[1:38:59] you're too
[1:39:00] Pentecostal it's only babies that wants
[1:39:03] the gifts of the Spirit you know you're
[1:39:05] not dignified enough to be king but
[1:39:09] David was not walking that day with a
[1:39:11] dignified robe and the air of a king you
[1:39:15] know all proud and exalted he realized
[1:39:19] that the Ark of the Covenant symbolizing
[1:39:22] the true and great king was now being
[1:39:25] put back into his proper place and when
[1:39:28] he did he forgot all about his
[1:39:32] dignity amen and he made great the name
[1:39:35] of the Lord while he based himself amen
[1:39:39] humbled himself are you with me and
[1:39:43] because of that Mel was struck with the
[1:39:46] curse of
[1:39:48] bareness she would not bring forth
[1:39:50] children of the king amen
[1:39:55] David David was able to put aside who he
[1:39:58] was to make great the King of
[1:40:02] Kings I hope where we are in this
[1:40:05] journey I hope if we've learned
[1:40:08] anything that we have learned you know
[1:40:11] to put away our
[1:40:13] pride oh that we we're the great people
[1:40:16] and we're the great ones and that we
[1:40:18] welcome and make great the King of Kings
[1:40:22] and the Lord of lords and we exalt his
[1:40:24] word over our opinion over what we
[1:40:29] think there so many will look even at
[1:40:31] what the prophet of God say and shrug
[1:40:34] you know and say well that's just his
[1:40:36] opinion well I tell you his opinion is a
[1:40:39] lot better than
[1:40:41] yours amen he met an angel he was in the
[1:40:45] presence of God he was Vindicated I'll
[1:40:48] take his opinion any day over yours
[1:40:51] or over
[1:40:52] mine amen you see but again David was
[1:40:56] able to put aside who he was to make
[1:40:59] great the king of kings and Lord of
[1:41:02] lords that's what real men do they will
[1:41:05] welcome and receive the word and when
[1:41:07] doing so they'll throw out their
[1:41:10] garments of Pride throw out their
[1:41:12] dignity and they'll humble themselves
[1:41:15] and rejoice liftting up the name of
[1:41:17] Jesus hallelujah oh yes they will read
[1:41:21] their
[1:41:22] quotes that fit their
[1:41:25] narrative leaving out what they don't
[1:41:28] want and it'll be a word without power
[1:41:32] mechanics without
[1:41:34] Dynamics religion without
[1:41:36] emotion that is
[1:41:38] dead lectures without anointing dead
[1:41:42] sermons that kill and that can only
[1:41:45] bring forth stillborn children without
[1:41:48] emotion or life I'm not speaking these
[1:41:52] things today as a
[1:41:54] novice I'm not speaking this as a young
[1:41:57] preacher or a young
[1:41:59] convert I'm speaking to this as a man of
[1:42:03] experience as I've stood preaching to
[1:42:05] this congregation as it started out in
[1:42:07] Little Home meetings and would start out
[1:42:10] with with a little small handful of
[1:42:12] people and build up and up to now to now
[1:42:16] 54 years of ministry on February the 1st
[1:42:20] I don't say that
[1:42:21] I don't say this you know as a novice I
[1:42:25] say this as one who's been
[1:42:28] there who's come through it who's dealt
[1:42:31] with situations who's traveled the world
[1:42:35] who's put my thumb up the pulse of the
[1:42:38] people among churches and see the
[1:42:41] problems that are there and I just want
[1:42:43] to say dead sermons
[1:42:46] kill and lectures without anointing are
[1:42:49] of no value I don't care how many quotes
[1:42:52] that you use the devil uses
[1:42:55] quotes Satan would use quotes to have
[1:42:57] tried to defeat Jesus amen but he didn't
[1:43:01] know how to place them in right order he
[1:43:05] did not have the the ability to use it
[1:43:08] in the correct way and it was not
[1:43:11] anointed and it didn't bring life and to
[1:43:13] obey it would to bring
[1:43:17] death the message movement is going
[1:43:21] through the same cycle of Revival and
[1:43:23] death that every movement before them
[1:43:25] did that's right and I'm going to say
[1:43:29] thus this church will either have a
[1:43:32] Revival or a
[1:43:40] funeral
[1:43:42] sa pause and think on
[1:43:49] this thank you Lord we'll either have a
[1:43:53] Revival or a
[1:43:57] funeral and we get to decide which
[1:44:04] one did you hear me we get to decide
[1:44:08] which
[1:44:10] one we can decide whether to have a
[1:44:12] Revival within our being where the
[1:44:15] spirit of God saturate your soul or we
[1:44:17] can have a funeral and bury your old
[1:44:19] dead emotionless
[1:44:21] religion bear you with it but I just
[1:44:24] want to say not all will go down into
[1:44:29] death let me read again from the books
[1:44:33] not all will go down into the into death
[1:44:36] let me quote from from even first
[1:44:39] Thessalonians 4 we which are alive and
[1:44:42] remain there's somebody that's going to
[1:44:44] be remaining there's somebody going to
[1:44:47] be still
[1:44:48] alive I want to be among those that not
[1:44:51] just have got breath in my body but I'm
[1:44:53] alive and my soul within me there's life
[1:44:57] that is breathing
[1:44:59] out hallelujah holy spirit
[1:45:05] life so let me read from the books I
[1:45:08] believe that the bride of Christ is
[1:45:10] called I believe she's sealed in the
[1:45:12] kingdom of God I believe the mechanics
[1:45:15] is there yeah they're waiting for the
[1:45:18] Dynamics to take her off the Earth
[1:45:21] into glory in the Rapture I believe it
[1:45:23] with all my heart yes sir we don't know
[1:45:25] how he's going to do it but he shall do
[1:45:28] it he is a Dynamics we just become
[1:45:31] members of the machine of his body
[1:45:34] forming ourselves into his image and see
[1:45:36] him uniting himself with us in his works
[1:45:39] with his love gifts as he hands them to
[1:45:42] us just before the wedding
[1:45:44] supper and we're waiting watching for
[1:45:47] that how many's looking for his love
[1:45:49] gifts
[1:45:52] I am amen I'm looking for his love
[1:45:56] gifts come on church amen is not going
[1:45:59] to be it's not going to be another
[1:46:01] sermon it's not going to be another word
[1:46:03] it's not going to be a new revelation
[1:46:06] you know but it's love
[1:46:08] gifts amen things that he's going to
[1:46:11] endow on his church that he is endowing
[1:46:14] that he wants to do with every one of
[1:46:16] you this
[1:46:18] morning amen I you know again in the in
[1:46:22] as I read from the books back in the
[1:46:24] message Oneness the church is now
[1:46:26] engaged like a man engaged to his wife
[1:46:30] what does he do while they they're
[1:46:32] engaged he just been doing all kinds of
[1:46:35] things sending her presence making her
[1:46:38] feel good well that's what Christ is
[1:46:40] doing to his church he's sending us
[1:46:42] Gifts of his Spirit how can you be
[1:46:45] engaged then when you're denying these
[1:46:48] gifts exist it's the very love tokens
[1:46:51] it's God's token to the church Jesus
[1:46:54] said so these signs shall follow them
[1:46:57] that believe you know anything about
[1:46:59] those signs Amen in my name they shall
[1:47:02] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[1:47:05] tongues if they they hands on the sick
[1:47:07] they shall recover and he says The
[1:47:09] Church Must Believe every word every
[1:47:13] promise every Iota and claim it for
[1:47:16] themselves and
[1:47:18] exercise themselves in
[1:47:21] if I was engaged to a girl and I was a
[1:47:23] single man and I'd send her something an
[1:47:25] engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it
[1:47:28] then that shows she doesn't believe
[1:47:30] me she doesn't want to be my bride amen
[1:47:34] well I'll tell you
[1:47:35] what I've been there done
[1:47:41] that back
[1:47:45] 1975 I asked the sweetheart of mine
[1:47:49] where you married
[1:47:54] me and she nodded her head yes nodded
[1:47:58] her head she's really
[1:48:01] shy I said what I didn't hear
[1:48:07] you I said I didn't hear you say
[1:48:12] anything she nodded her head more
[1:48:14] vigorously I said a vow has to be
[1:48:18] spoken and she said said
[1:48:22] yes we went
[1:48:26] down I got the best ring I
[1:48:30] could we were both
[1:48:32] poor there'd be times I didn't even have
[1:48:35] a car to
[1:48:39] drive I went and bought her
[1:48:44] ring we
[1:48:46] paid $98 for it
[1:48:51] my father-in-law would say where'd you
[1:48:54] get that from a gum
[1:48:58] machine but it was the best I
[1:49:01] have she wored with
[1:49:07] pride she believed me she believed in
[1:49:14] me she wanted to be my
[1:49:17] bride she took my ring
[1:49:20] and there she wore it and showed it
[1:49:23] everywhere others say it's cheap it's
[1:49:26] from a gun machine others would make
[1:49:29] maybe a light of it or whatever you know
[1:49:32] how in the world is this guy ever going
[1:49:34] to mount to anything she she she B on
[1:49:38] the the bobtail
[1:49:41] nag and
[1:49:43] won am
[1:49:46] amen you
[1:49:48] see D I've been there I've done that but
[1:49:51] what if she would say oh no you know
[1:49:54] it's kind of like Billy Graham one time
[1:49:58] was courting a girl she a beautiful girl
[1:50:00] nice girl and he asked her would she he
[1:50:03] marry her and she said
[1:50:05] no no I I'm I'm not going to marry a
[1:50:08] preacher like you said I I want to marry
[1:50:11] somebody that'll be
[1:50:17] famous she didn't know what she was
[1:50:20] throwing
[1:50:22] away she didn't know what she was
[1:50:25] thinking was cheap yeah that didn't look
[1:50:28] like would amount to
[1:50:30] anything and brother Brandon said if
[1:50:33] Christ sends his church the gifts that
[1:50:35] he promised and they refuse them and say
[1:50:37] they're not so that they don't want to
[1:50:40] be the bride of Christ they are espoused
[1:50:43] to some other lover and not to Christ
[1:50:45] the bridegroom so the real Church keeps
[1:50:49] the promise and keeps all and accepts
[1:50:51] the gifts that God sends them amen yes
[1:50:55] sir amen hallelujah now the last Church
[1:51:00] age is Leo DEA and he's shown on the
[1:51:03] outside of his church knocking to get
[1:51:06] back
[1:51:07] in they have put him
[1:51:11] out
[1:51:13] again thinking of this Paul said and I
[1:51:17] will quote from the book this book
[1:51:21] I will quote from this know this in the
[1:51:23] last days perilous times will come men
[1:51:27] will be hey and high-minded and lovers
[1:51:29] of Pleasures more than lovers of God and
[1:51:31] Truce Breakers false accusers and
[1:51:34] continent despiser those that are good
[1:51:37] and brother Bram comments on that and
[1:51:38] said call you a Holy Roller anything
[1:51:40] they
[1:51:42] can having an a form of
[1:51:44] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:51:47] he said there you are fundamental in
[1:51:49] dark now get this church fundamental in
[1:51:53] Doctrine but powerless in
[1:51:57] power they deny the existence of Divine
[1:52:00] Healing they deny the power of the gift
[1:52:03] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:52:06] the power
[1:52:07] thereof that is the state that the
[1:52:12] message Community has
[1:52:15] become his word testifies in the last
[1:52:18] day that would come of Fallen away and
[1:52:20] there will come up a cold form of
[1:52:23] powerless churches that we're living in
[1:52:25] a church that has no power having a form
[1:52:28] of godliness but denying the power
[1:52:30] thereof from such turn away he gave the
[1:52:32] sign that there would be times when men
[1:52:35] man would sit in the temple of God
[1:52:37] showing himself he is God and he would
[1:52:40] come ruling the Nations how perfectly
[1:52:42] all these things how God's word has been
[1:52:45] perfect and how close are we how far are
[1:52:49] we I I I will tell you this we've run
[1:52:52] out of
[1:52:53] Ages I don't know you noticed or not but
[1:52:56] where this is the last one and it's been
[1:52:59] a long journey for the church since the
[1:53:01] day of Pentecost and as we passed one of
[1:53:04] the last mile
[1:53:05] markers I see a sign let me read it to
[1:53:09] you oh no I I don't I don't know if you
[1:53:12] can take this or not it says Jesus has
[1:53:16] been put out of the message
[1:53:18] Church
[1:53:24] are you
[1:53:25] sure did you read that right brother
[1:53:28] Tim
[1:53:30] well let's see let me look a little
[1:53:33] harder at the
[1:53:36] sign oh wait a
[1:53:39] minute I
[1:53:41] seem there but
[1:53:44] outside with dirty
[1:53:48] feet
[1:53:58] some of you are wishing I have stayed
[1:54:00] home today I could at least change the
[1:54:07] channel but let me just tell you every
[1:54:11] Revival and I'm quoting the books every
[1:54:14] Revival down through here the churches
[1:54:16] every Revival is always been brought
[1:54:18] sight of out outside of
[1:54:20] organization any man that ever started
[1:54:23] Revival was outside the organization and
[1:54:25] every time a Revival started they had
[1:54:27] signs and miracles and speaking in
[1:54:29] tongues and healings and so forth and
[1:54:31] taking place like that and as soon as
[1:54:33] that founder died then they organized it
[1:54:35] it made an organization out of it and it
[1:54:38] went right dead and God never fooled
[1:54:40] with it no more that's exactly right and
[1:54:43] here he is at the last Church AG
[1:54:45] standing outside the door God Almighty
[1:54:47] that breaks my heart
[1:54:50] right standing outside of the door of
[1:54:53] his own church after being pushed out by
[1:54:55] whirl and coldness and denomination and
[1:54:58] difference and standing outside the door
[1:55:01] knocking trying to get back in and
[1:55:03] brother Bram said when I thought that a
[1:55:06] while ago I just leaned over my table

[1:56:21] so Christ Jesus Christ himself gave a
[1:56:26] message of what would be in this last
[1:56:30] age what would be the the condition what
[1:56:34] would be the situation where we would be
[1:56:37] what would be happening in this last age
[1:56:41] now so again you see here here again I
[1:56:45] want you to see this so as brother Bram
[1:56:47] is preaching the message
[1:56:50] message of the leoan
[1:56:53] age he's not doing as John Wesley or
[1:56:57] Benjamin Franklin or some Statesman he
[1:57:00] doing it as the seventh angel who has
[1:57:04] received the message from Christ
[1:57:07] himself amen and he's the messenger and
[1:57:11] he he stands there in his church and he
[1:57:14] says it's Jesus
[1:57:17] outside with dirty feet
[1:57:23] amen and he says I often dealt with
[1:57:27] Jesus standing in that Pharisees house
[1:57:30] nobody paid any attention to him when he
[1:57:32] had Dirty Feet they didn't meet him at
[1:57:35] the door and wash his feet in anointing
[1:57:37] taking the manure and stuff where he had
[1:57:39] been walking His Garment sweeping around
[1:57:42] and brought brought that old stink off
[1:57:44] the road where horses and things had
[1:57:45] travel and got that stink on them they'd
[1:57:48] always wash the feet that was the custom
[1:57:50] and a footwash flunky stayed at the door
[1:57:52] and when a man come would wash his feet
[1:57:54] and raise up get a little pair of
[1:57:56] sandals and put on they anointed his
[1:57:58] head made him feel good and to burn on
[1:58:00] his neck from the rise of the sun comb
[1:58:02] back his hair and he will go
[1:58:04] in and then this poor old Harlot down
[1:58:08] the street who come up there she only
[1:58:10] had a little bit of money in a sack and
[1:58:13] she looked over and seen Jesus staying
[1:58:16] sitting there with dirty feet now why is
[1:58:18] brother Brandon preaching this because
[1:58:20] this would be what
[1:58:23] happened in this church
[1:58:26] age amen that that here he would see
[1:58:30] Christ the the woman he forgive that
[1:58:32] other woman of her sins you know I I
[1:58:35] know he's the man I've heard that done
[1:58:37] these things you know but but look at
[1:58:40] him why why isn't anybody inviting him
[1:58:42] in how come nobody wants
[1:58:48] him and he said that's the way we do we
[1:58:51] invite him to come to our
[1:58:52] meetings but when when he comes we're
[1:58:56] ashamed of
[1:58:57] him oh I wouldn't stay now listen I'm

[1:59:34] our Pharisee
[1:59:36] order that somebody was so worried that
[1:59:39] somebody might get out of order well
[1:59:42] they ought to get out of order long
[1:59:43] enough to get
[1:59:46] saved amen again you know hear this this
[1:59:49] little woman elbowing away through the
[1:59:51] crowd I I tell you I wish that's the way
[1:59:54] where every one of us would accept Jesus
[1:59:56] elbow in our ways as the crowd not
[1:59:58] worrying about what everybody else saw
[2:00:01] or thought about or how they saw I was
[2:00:04] or my pastor the way I've been but but
[2:00:07] realize Jesus needs to be
[2:00:10] worshiped and he deserves our
[2:00:13] worship amen and his feet must be washed

[2:00:55] while the trouble of it is you got too

[2:01:22] in the presence of Jesus and I left
[2:01:25] [Applause]
[2:01:26] it that's right she wasn't so much
[2:01:29] noticing about how much order she was in
[2:01:31] or how much she was out the main thing
[2:01:34] was to get to Jesus amen that's the way

[2:01:38] feeling amen I don't care what people
[2:01:41] have to do come on somebody amen you you

[2:01:52] make it all legalistic better have your
[2:01:53] church bail and you all the other things
[2:01:55] that you're supposed to do two just

[2:02:00] it law make it all law that's right amen
[2:02:03] remember those things were Church order
[2:02:05] was given to as a guideline and
[2:02:08] sometimes you got to get out of the
[2:02:12] guideline amen you got to get out of the
[2:02:14] guideline set there the of the order in
[2:02:17] order for somebody to get saved to break
[2:02:20] through to the holy
[2:02:22] spirit amen notice she wasn't noticing
[2:02:26] about how much order she was in or how
[2:02:28] much she was out the main thing was get
[2:02:30] to
[2:02:32] Jesus that's the old thing about our
[2:02:34] youth camp I I really don't care about
[2:02:37] what Pharisee is looking in what's in
[2:02:40] our
[2:02:42] services amen it really don't matter
[2:02:44] what they think as long as young people
[2:02:48] are getting to Jes
[2:02:50] Jesus Hallelujah I don't care if they
[2:02:53] have to get out of order if they get out
[2:02:55] of order whatever it's always in order
[2:02:58] when a soul comes to Christ that'll be
[2:03:01] the main goal of every church amen is to
[2:03:04] see our altars full of the people
[2:03:07] seeking God having a greater experience
[2:03:10] with
[2:03:12] him she didn't care about all of that he
[2:03:16] said he sat without being kissed he
[2:03:19] wasn't welcome and she wanted him to be
[2:03:21] welcomed she didn't care about their old
[2:03:24] Pharisee orders about their old
[2:03:26] tradition she was pressing her way
[2:03:28] through to get to Jesus God help us to
[2:03:31] have a Revival like that where men and
[2:03:34] women will elbow their way through the
[2:03:36] crowds and denominations and the bearers
[2:03:38] till they get in the presence of
[2:03:47] Jesus yeah
[2:03:49] Jesus sitting there with unwashed
[2:03:52] feet I don't want that happening in this
[2:03:58] church every time he
[2:04:00] comes I want to make him
[2:04:03] welcome make him welcome with our tears
[2:04:06] with our
[2:04:07] rejoicing with our glories to God with
[2:04:10] our
[2:04:11] shouts with our receptiveness to the
[2:04:14] word of
[2:04:15] God
[2:04:17] Jesus with dirty feet leot to and
[2:04:20] churches and nobody paying any attention
[2:04:22] and today he packs a dirty name as Holy
[2:04:26] Roller of course we've changed that and
[2:04:28] call it
[2:04:30] Pentecostal or something another like
[2:04:32] that and Men ain't got the goal to stand
[2:04:36] up for
[2:04:42] him let me put up a
[2:04:47] slide
[2:04:59] today with Jesus standing outside the
[2:05:01] door of the Pentecostal organizations
[2:05:04] Baptist organizations Methodist
[2:05:07] organizations trying to get back in with
[2:05:10] Pentecost again and the people are
[2:05:13] passing him
[2:05:16] by after your world and and things have
[2:05:19] pushed him out of the church he's
[2:05:21] standing trying crying to get back in
[2:05:23] look what he said he's trying he I'm not
[2:05:27] talking about some Zeus or
[2:05:30] something I'm talking about this
[2:05:33] age look if you see the caption the Leo
[2:05:36] Dean Church age his brother BR preach it
[2:05:39] receive him the message from
[2:05:41] Jesus to
[2:05:44] you and he's trying to get back in the
[2:05:47] church with
[2:05:49] Pentecost
[2:05:51] again not isusa Street the original
[2:05:55] outpouring of the Holy
[2:05:57] Ghost and it's the most pathetic thing
[2:06:00] I've ever seen in my life had no need of
[2:06:03] him outside knocking trying to get in
[2:06:06] that's the same thing that he's trying
[2:06:08] to do today he was
[2:06:10] outside we'll take the next slide they
[2:06:13] never throwed him out they still sang of
[2:06:16] him no notice this having a form of
[2:06:20] godliness but denying the
[2:06:24] power so I want you to get the picture
[2:06:27] they didn't throw him out no they still
[2:06:29] sang about him that's right you see but
[2:06:33] they still preached about him but they
[2:06:37] they had never missed him in their
[2:06:42] presence they were going right on they
[2:06:44] were nearsighted they were looking at
[2:06:46] their big buildings look how God's
[2:06:48] blessed us you know we used to be in our
[2:06:50] our little bitty Shany of but church or
[2:06:52] storefront and here we are now and God's
[2:06:54] given us look at his
[2:06:57] blessings I I thank God for this
[2:06:59] building God gave us God gave us this
[2:07:01] building you look around this campus and
[2:07:04] everything has been paid for we don't
[2:07:06] owe a dime on none of it that's
[2:07:08] phenomenal that was a miracle that was a
[2:07:11] blessing from God but I'd rather be back
[2:07:15] in the old church I'm talking about the
[2:07:18] old old church with broken window panes
[2:07:22] and with wood heaters there and a few
[2:07:24] people that love the Lord than to have a
[2:07:26] thousand people who didn't really come
[2:07:30] there with the same intent to make Jesus
[2:07:33] welcome amen I say we can do it right
[2:07:36] here in this building it ain't the
[2:07:38] building and it ain't the
[2:07:40] number amen it's the hearts that
[2:07:43] surrendered to
[2:07:47] God but they didn't miss
[2:07:50] him no no they didn't miss speaking in
[2:07:54] tongues they didn't miss the great
[2:07:57] powerful messages of God who cuts down
[2:08:00] to the heart and circumcises the heart
[2:08:03] and tears off the things of the world
[2:08:05] and Shucks you like a piece of corn
[2:08:08] there was too worried about
[2:08:13] order and they had to order but not
[2:08:15] Jesus that's right
[2:08:21] give me the next
[2:08:22] slide If You Preach like that in their
[2:08:25] church that OU you out and that's the
[2:08:29] way the Holy Ghost preached you know I
[2:08:31] had been Ed out but I've been preached
[2:08:33] out many times afterwards the next four
[2:08:36] or five sermon they ate me for lunch
[2:08:39] breakfast and supper but I preached it
[2:08:43] anyway if you preach like that in their
[2:08:45] church that ask you out and that's the
[2:08:46] way the Holy Ghost preach Jesus said you
[2:08:49] Generation of Vipers you Snakes in the
[2:08:51] Grass and John did do great anointed men
[2:08:54] I always tore the hide off of them but
[2:08:56] they didn't miss him cuz they didn't
[2:08:59] have that so they went they had a little
[2:09:03] flowery something patting them on the
[2:09:04] back and said just join put your name
[2:09:06] here and we'll take you in our
[2:09:08] membership and you just go get your
[2:09:10] paper from other church and we'll
[2:09:12] receive you and so forth now your pledge
[2:09:15] will be how much each year you see
[2:09:17] that's it rich have need of
[2:09:20] nothing but you have need of the
[2:09:22] greatest thing and haven't got it again
[2:09:26] this is to our church age Jesus standing
[2:09:29] outside trying to get back in with
[2:09:40] Pentecost what would you think next
[2:09:43] slide what would you think would happen
[2:09:45] tonight in the Methodist Church
[2:09:50] I don't want to change the
[2:09:52] prophet but I'm going to say what would
[2:09:54] you think would happen in a message
[2:09:57] church if the Holy Ghost fell upon the
[2:09:59] church and they began sh jumping
[2:10:01] shouting jumping speaking in tongues and
[2:10:03] acting like a bunch of drunk people why
[2:10:06] the conference would throw that message
[2:10:09] Methodist Church out of the conference
[2:10:12] you know that the same thing would
[2:10:13] happen Baptist Church did that happen
[2:10:15] same thing Pentecostals why there's many
[2:10:17] of it happened the same thing sure yes
[2:10:20] sir they wouldn't put up without that
[2:10:23] nonsense they'd say well they even
[2:10:25] spoiled our new carpets uhhuh My my what
[2:10:28] a miserable Bunch they
[2:10:31] are your the messenger is describing the
[2:10:35] miserable condition that people will get
[2:10:38] to in this
[2:10:40] age now so again you see again if he's
[2:10:45] outside of the Pentecostal church now
[2:10:47] how are we going going to get him back
[2:10:49] in this is a question he was asking then
[2:10:52] and he said here it is if any man will
[2:10:55] hear my voice and open the door I will
[2:10:58] come in and I will s with him and he
[2:11:00] with me amen he won't deal with them no
[2:11:03] more because they're dead and gone gone
[2:11:07] to begin with he hates it he's always
[2:11:09] hated he's always hated that spirit amen
[2:11:14] of divisiveness and inclusiveness and
[2:11:18] and and and pushing everybody else
[2:11:21] out amen listen church sometimes I might
[2:11:24] I might scream out at some of these
[2:11:26] brothers and it's not to condemn them
[2:11:29] and this message isn't to condemn it's
[2:11:31] to say listen there's a promise in the
[2:11:34] word and you can have
[2:11:37] it it can be in your church you say well
[2:11:41] brother Tim youall think the Revival
[2:11:43] comes from evening like Tabernacle
[2:11:45] listen this bride's Revival started
[2:11:47] because the book was open seven angels
[2:11:51] came and opened the book and revealed
[2:11:53] the mystery to a prophet of God and
[2:11:56] because of that it is started a bride's
[2:11:58] Revival and I just happen to be a part
[2:12:01] of it and I want everybody around the
[2:12:03] world who's the bride to be a recipient
[2:12:06] of that
[2:12:08] Revival I didn't start it and you can't
[2:12:10] stop
[2:12:12] it
[2:12:16] Hallelujah but here it is
[2:12:19] If any man next slide If any man any
[2:12:23] Methodist man any Baptist any
[2:12:25] Presbyterian any Catholic man any Church
[2:12:28] of God man any nazarine man any
[2:12:31] Pentecostal man or let me just say any
[2:12:33] message Man any man that hear my voice
[2:12:37] and will open the door I will come in
[2:12:39] and suck with him and he with me and
[2:12:41] that's the message to the Pentecostal
[2:12:43] church not to try to revive the
[2:12:46] Pentecostal organization but revive the
[2:12:49] Pentecostal
[2:12:51] blessing in the individual's heart yes
[2:12:58] sir but we don't want this Pentecostal
[2:13:02] blessing no no no we we got another
[2:13:05] lover we don't want that in our church
[2:13:08] no sir we we have our forms and our ways
[2:13:12] and we do this and that we have our
[2:13:14] orders get out of order long enough to
[2:13:16] get saved
[2:13:20] that's what needs to
[2:13:22] happen in the Easter seal brother Bram
[2:13:26] said oh they say you can't have these
[2:13:29] oldfashioned Pentecostal revivals he
[2:13:32] said yes we can you can have it in
[2:13:36] yourself do you know what that means if
[2:13:39] your church don't have
[2:13:41] it you can have
[2:13:43] it you get to choose you get to choose
[2:13:47] Revival or
[2:13:49] funeral come on Revival and death is
[2:13:52] going on and you get to choose and so
[2:13:55] you they say you can't have it but yes
[2:13:57] you can the prophet said you can have it
[2:14:00] in
[2:14:02] yourself Hallelujah if all of even the
[2:14:05] light Tabernacle goes dead in
[2:14:08] 2024 I don't have to go dead I can have
[2:14:12] a Revival on the inside of
[2:14:15] myself Hallelujah I am the
[2:14:20] Revival you can't separate me from this
[2:14:23] revival I am this
[2:14:26] [Music]
[2:14:28] [Applause]
[2:14:29] revival
[2:14:31] well we don't
[2:14:34] need or want a Pentecostal
[2:14:37] blessing well let me read from the
[2:14:41] books cuz the Bible said they would get
[2:14:44] that way that would be their sign of a
[2:14:48] protest that they would
[2:14:50] wave come
[2:14:51] on not anti-semitic ISM but anti- word
[2:14:56] anti moving of the spirit and they'll
[2:14:59] wave that around and he says this
[2:15:02] brother Bram had to deal with in his age
[2:15:04] he said Paul is ordaining these gifts in
[2:15:07] the church this is 1965 in Easter seal
[2:15:10] ordaining these gifts into the church 30
[2:15:13] years later and then Galatians 1: 18 if
[2:15:15] an angel from heaven preaches you in
[2:15:17] other gospel than this that that already
[2:15:20] received see already been preached let
[2:15:22] him be a curse I believe that Pentecost
[2:15:25] began without
[2:15:27] ending sounds like to me then we ought
[2:15:30] to still be in
[2:15:32] Pentecost until the day we leave after
[2:15:36] all it's the
[2:15:37] Jubilee and the Rapture is the Jubilee
[2:15:41] It's the final setting free from the old
[2:15:44] flesh
[2:15:46] hallelujah amen oh he said I believe
[2:15:48] it's every creature all times all places
[2:15:51] Pentecost should always remain the
[2:15:53] Pentecostal blessing should always be
[2:15:55] upon the people I just say God give me
[2:15:58] the Pentecostal
[2:16:01] blessings I'm not going to deny any of
[2:16:03] your gifts that's right I hear Brother
[2:16:06] brandham crying out and this should be
[2:16:08] your cry in this year coming God created
[2:16:11] me a Revival let me be the
[2:16:15] Revival Let each of us be the Revival
[2:16:18] the Revival of me make me the hunger
[2:16:20] Lord Make Me The Thirst from this hour
[2:16:24] on be thine more consecrated servant a
[2:16:27] better servant more blessed more of you
[2:16:29] more able more humbler more Kinder more
[2:16:32] willing to work more looking to the
[2:16:34] things that are positive forgetting the
[2:16:35] things that are in the past and the
[2:16:37] negative and let me press toward the
[2:16:39] mark of the prize of the high
[2:16:42] calling so
[2:16:44] now I don't want to throw you for a loop
[2:16:47] here
[2:16:48] here but with him
[2:16:51] rejection with him
[2:16:53] rejected then watch the
[2:16:59] crucifixion brother
[2:17:02] Tim we pass that on this journey 2,000
[2:17:05] years ago didn't we I mean crucifixion
[2:17:07] was way back there aren't we near the
[2:17:11] resurrection what are you talking about
[2:17:13] a crucifixion
[2:17:15] for because before there can be a res
[2:17:18] Resurrection there has to be a
[2:17:19] crucifixion
[2:17:22] first so if you're looking for a
[2:17:25] resurrection before the Resurrection
[2:17:27] comes there's a crucifixion
[2:17:31] first so he's been crucified and he's
[2:17:35] been put out of the denominational
[2:17:37] system but the last
[2:17:39] place that he will be pushed out is in
[2:17:42] the message
[2:17:44] Community his power will be killed his
[2:17:47] Miracles will be scorned and spit
[2:17:51] upon oh oh no oh no brother Tim that's
[2:17:54] only the denominational known many let
[2:17:57] me tell you let me just get this clear
[2:18:00] many around the message is under an
[2:18:04] indictment for crucifying Christ
[2:18:08] aresh just be sure you're not one of
[2:18:11] them in the in the indictment message
[2:18:14] brother Bram preached he said to base
[2:18:16] this indict
[2:18:18] he he said he used that four four um
[2:18:23] letters from the scripture he looked
[2:18:24] into the book and the book said There
[2:18:28] They Crucified
[2:18:31] him and he used that to base his
[2:18:35] indictment against thisgeneration
[2:18:38] and I want you to hear what he said in
[2:18:41] the opening of it he said I'm bringing
[2:18:43] an indictment to the denominational
[2:18:46] churches
[2:18:48] that exempts us praise God hallelujah
[2:18:52] we're not no denomination no we left
[2:18:54] that long time ago praise God we're not
[2:18:57] one of them we we we and also many of
[2:19:02] The
[2:19:04] Independents for crucifying Christ AR
[2:19:08] fresh so you don't even have to belong
[2:19:11] to
[2:19:13] denomination you can be independent from
[2:19:16] them and still crucify him aresh
[2:19:20] Amen in the token
[2:19:23] message there is some of the
[2:19:25] independence just as bad as the
[2:19:28] denominational sometimes
[2:19:35] worse I I'm looking at people here today
[2:19:38] that have sat in
[2:19:40] Cults that was worse more denominated
[2:19:44] more
[2:19:46] tighter more more
[2:19:48] tighter than any denomination you could
[2:19:50] have be Freer being a
[2:19:54] Baptist there's
[2:19:56] Cults this
[2:19:59] message those around the fanaticism
[2:20:02] around this message has could produced
[2:20:10] Cults men who rise up and say you can
[2:20:13] only be make it in the Rapture by
[2:20:14] listening to me if you don't go to my
[2:20:16] church you're not going in the
[2:20:19] Rapture all kinds of things it is
[2:20:24] horrific and the tragedies along the
[2:20:27] road I I you know I'm I'm a world
[2:20:30] traveler and I I hear from people around
[2:20:32] the world I deal with people who who are
[2:20:36] struggling in situations like that
[2:20:39] that's
[2:20:40] right who who who come to me with
[2:20:43] questions and and said brother Tim you
[2:20:45] know all of these things are happening
[2:20:48] in our church you know our our pastor is
[2:20:52] left his wife and he went and got him
[2:20:54] another one and now you know she wasn't
[2:20:57] a virgin according to what the prophet
[2:20:58] taught and and he he makes up these
[2:21:01] rules and and these others and we got
[2:21:03] all kinds of sin and things that are
[2:21:05] happening in our churches I don't know
[2:21:08] what to do and I want to go to church I
[2:21:10] want to obey the word but I can't
[2:21:16] go what do I
[2:21:18] do some of the worst Cults there ours
[2:21:21] call themselves
[2:21:23] message and like so many others have
[2:21:26] made themselves a Jerusalem the place
[2:21:29] you must come to
[2:21:31] worship they don't know that our
[2:21:33] Jerusalem is from above and it's the
[2:21:36] true place of
[2:21:37] worship the true place is in
[2:21:41] Christ they don't know that they think
[2:21:44] it's in a certain place a certain
[2:21:46] headquarters
[2:21:48] but in their
[2:21:49] Jerusalem now if youd studi the
[2:21:52] indictment message you brother brother
[2:21:54] brandham said each one of them have made
[2:21:57] their little
[2:21:59] movement a Jerusalem the place where you
[2:22:03] must come to worship and he said but but
[2:22:06] he went on and preached he said but in
[2:22:08] their Jerusalem the word is crucified
[2:22:11] the life is taken out of it and all is
[2:22:14] left is a dead
[2:22:16] Creed and he said the new Calvary is the
[2:22:19] church socalled many holy places most
[2:22:22] holy places great Pulpit there he
[2:22:25] receives his heartest pierces a new
[2:22:28] Calvary where is it found at in the most
[2:22:31] holy place there in the most holy place
[2:22:35] they the Jews the most holy people
[2:22:37] crucified most shameful death
[2:22:40] him the most wonderful person of life
[2:22:45] amen where did he he get his Spears at
[2:22:48] in his side where did he get his pierces
[2:22:51] on Calvary where does he get it today in
[2:22:54] the Pulpit where do they come from
[2:22:58] Jerusalem where do they come from the
[2:23:00] denomination and I just say just because
[2:23:03] you don't have papers for
[2:23:06] one some of the churches are so
[2:23:08] tightened up until God couldn't
[2:23:11] move in many Methodist churches acts two
[2:23:15] would not be welcome but would be
[2:23:18] rejected they won't welcome the Holy
[2:23:21] Ghost and especially not if you can't
[2:23:23] speak in his
[2:23:25] language they don't want that language
[2:23:27] from Heaven the ones who claim to love
[2:23:30] him that's who crucified him today his
[2:23:33] second Calvary where he receives his
[2:23:36] pierces against the word who is he he is
[2:23:38] the word where is he pierced the hardest
[2:23:41] from the pulpits in the holy places just
[2:23:45] like it was then
[2:23:47] amen so this is what happens in the
[2:23:50] journey Christ will be crucified from
[2:23:53] message
[2:23:56] pulpits oh well now brother Tim but we
[2:23:59] welcome and receive the word it's true
[2:24:01] you
[2:24:02] welcome and you welcome and receive the
[2:24:07] knowledge of the word but if it's true
[2:24:09] that you welcome his word then you
[2:24:11] welcome his spirit because his spirit is
[2:24:13] word in life amen his word is spirit and
[2:24:17] life amen so so look children as we're
[2:24:21] driving along I I just want to say we're
[2:24:24] passing another
[2:24:27] signpost uh brother Tim I hope this
[2:24:29] ain't as bad as that last one well let's
[2:24:32] just look at it Romans
[2:24:36] 11:25 we're going to read from the
[2:24:39] books Romans 11:25 for I would not
[2:24:42] Brethren that you be ignorant of this
[2:24:44] mystery lest you should be watch eyes
[2:24:47] and your own conceits that blindness has
[2:24:49] happened in part to Israel until the
[2:24:52] fullness of the Gentiles come in so now
[2:24:55] stop leod is prophesied to be what
[2:25:00] blind okay so that means we now are
[2:25:04] reaching our
[2:25:06] fullness remember
[2:25:09] here it says and all Israel shall be
[2:25:12] saved is written they that come out of
[2:25:14] Zion that the there shall come out of
[2:25:16] Zion the deliver and shall turn away
[2:25:19] ungodliness sh from Jacob so this is
[2:25:22] promise so we know that laying right
[2:25:25] ahead of us all Israel we're talking
[2:25:28] about the elect shall be
[2:25:31] saved but in the meantime the Gentiles
[2:25:35] their age is coming to the
[2:25:37] fullness now the Gentile is dispensation
[2:25:41] is represented by seven Church
[2:25:44] ages so the this the seven Church ages
[2:25:48] is the fullness of the Gentiles if we're
[2:25:50] still in in the Gentile dispensation we
[2:25:53] are still in the leoan age and which is
[2:25:56] the seventh age under the seventh age
[2:25:59] messenger now this sign of course means
[2:26:04] that our road will end at the Rapture so
[2:26:08] it's telling us there is an end of the
[2:26:11] road right ahead and that's as far as
[2:26:15] Gentiles can go because the rest of them
[2:26:18] have to go in a Rapture because they're
[2:26:20] coming to the
[2:26:21] fullness of the
[2:26:24] Gentiles but in doing so now Israel is
[2:26:28] still spiritually blind and but their
[2:26:31] eyes are about to be open however
[2:26:35] Gentiles see but very little and their
[2:26:39] eyes are becoming dimmer and dimmer by
[2:26:42] the
[2:26:43] minute as their light goes out
[2:26:47] right now in the blinding of the Gentile
[2:26:50] of the Jews when they were blinded in
[2:26:53] that Darkness under cover you know it
[2:26:57] takes light to for your eyes to see and
[2:27:00] under the darkness it came and enveloped
[2:27:03] them a spiritual Darkness on the Jews
[2:27:06] they killed their
[2:27:07] messiah in that
[2:27:10] Darkness amen and in the blinding of the
[2:27:13] Gentiles they will crucify the word
[2:27:17] taking the life the anointing and the
[2:27:20] power out of
[2:27:21] it that's it now after World War Two we
[2:27:26] know that the United States had a
[2:27:28] national Revival with both Billy Graham
[2:27:31] and brother bradam and the Divine
[2:27:33] Healing movement and of course there was
[2:27:36] also all Roberts and the charismatic
[2:27:39] Pentecostal movement it all sprung up
[2:27:41] right at the same time do you know why
[2:27:44] because as we looked at the the sign
[2:27:48] going along the journey I want you to
[2:27:50] notice trees have put forth their
[2:27:54] buds you know here Israel now the Bible
[2:27:58] says of her and as it prophesies when
[2:28:01] you see the victory but if you notice it
[2:28:05] also says and all the other trees right
[2:28:09] so it's not just Israel putting for
[2:28:11] their butts but all the other trees so
[2:28:14] just as just as the angel of God is
[2:28:18] coming to a prophet for restoration of
[2:28:21] the Bride tree so Israel the Fig Tree
[2:28:25] begins to put forth its buds but that
[2:28:28] wasn't all the charismatic the
[2:28:31] Pentecostal would put forth their buds
[2:28:33] the Baptists with a million more than 44
[2:28:35] would put forth their buds and all of
[2:28:37] them would begin to leave
[2:28:40] out now every one of them is coming to
[2:28:42] fruit every one of them their debt has
[2:28:45] to be paid
[2:28:47] comes a harvest time now so there was in
[2:28:52] that cycle in that sign there was a for
[2:28:56] formation of the nation of Israel the
[2:28:59] Revival of a nation that placed her back
[2:29:02] in their Homeland and that nation has
[2:29:05] now been built and it's a modern yet is
[2:29:09] a sinful place has a powerful Army
[2:29:13] nuclear
[2:29:14] weapons you know I I I read there many
[2:29:19] of the accounts of the the survivors of
[2:29:22] that Holocaust and seen pictures of them
[2:29:25] and whatever you know uh
[2:29:29] ungodly people shall I say it you know
[2:29:33] uh my uh you know my girlfriend and I
[2:29:36] were living together and our child you
[2:29:38] know open
[2:29:41] fornication all kinds of things and and
[2:29:44] there they are their eyes are blinded
[2:29:47] the light is not dawned on them are you
[2:29:49] with me amen so she is a great nation
[2:29:53] but she's also a sinful
[2:29:57] Nation amen and the nation has has got
[2:30:01] now a powerful Army and nuclear weapons
[2:30:05] and she's leading the world in science
[2:30:07] and many fields and she's built an
[2:30:09] agricultural infrastructure in modern
[2:30:12] city she's the Envy of the world as a
[2:30:15] democracy and she's largely though
[2:30:18] secular almost
[2:30:20] Godless and she also is a democracy rif
[2:30:25] with crooked
[2:30:28] politicians
[2:30:30] however they had a joke just
[2:30:34] happened and it's part of our
[2:30:38] journey on October the 7th things change
[2:30:43] forever and they'll never be the same
[2:30:45] again
[2:30:47] and and and I'm just going to make a
[2:30:50] prediction what I predict to see from
[2:30:54] this coming out of this rubble and out
[2:30:57] of this ashes and these horrible things
[2:30:59] that has happened to them as a nation
[2:31:02] that there will be a national Revival
[2:31:05] within
[2:31:06] Israel which then they will fulfill
[2:31:09] their
[2:31:10] Destiny I won't say all will have
[2:31:13] Revival and you say well why do you
[2:31:14] believe this because with a religious
[2:31:17] fervor the temple will be
[2:31:21] rebuilt with religious fervor two
[2:31:24] prophets will raise up and 144,000 will
[2:31:28] be called
[2:31:30] out if you would live this why if you
[2:31:33] would stay here and don't go into
[2:31:34] Rapture this will happen you will see it
[2:31:38] God help you that you don't see it the
[2:31:41] question is though this is the question
[2:31:44] what about her
[2:31:45] counterpart what about the bride of
[2:31:47] Christ will we the Gentile bride remain
[2:31:51] the same status quo or will we too seek
[2:31:54] the Lord and turn to him since the World
[2:31:58] War II Israel uh Israel's spiritual
[2:32:01] counterpart I'm talking about us the
[2:32:03] Gentile bride has received a message now
[2:32:07] listen to me carefully we received a
[2:32:09] message we have built moves we have made
[2:32:12] kingdoms we have made fine churches we
[2:32:15] have political systems and as the World
[2:32:19] falls apart around us will we seek God
[2:32:23] with all our heart and consummate the
[2:32:27] resurrection and the Rapture and fulfill
[2:32:29] our
[2:32:32] destiny something must happen right a
[2:32:36] Revival of some sort must happen to
[2:32:39] Israel in order to build a new
[2:32:42] Temple I don't know that the secular Jew
[2:32:45] will repent
[2:32:47] nor that there would be a re National
[2:32:49] Revival there in Israel who knows the
[2:32:51] outcome of that spiritually she's called
[2:32:54] Sodom and gomorah they will so
[2:32:57] vehemently reject the two prophets and
[2:33:01] kill them and parade their bodies like a
[2:33:04] bunch of heathens up and down the city
[2:33:06] for for three or four days the Bible
[2:33:08] says in the Book of
[2:33:11] Revelation are you with me so maybe they
[2:33:14] w't all turn to God but there's going to
[2:33:16] be a Remnant there's going to be a group
[2:33:19] of them that will have a hunger in their
[2:33:22] heart we must find
[2:33:26] God and I'm saying if this is happening
[2:33:29] in Israel in the natural counterpart
[2:33:32] what about the spiritual
[2:33:34] counterpart I don't say they will all
[2:33:36] repent I don't say they'll all come back
[2:33:39] but I say oh God let those of us whose
[2:33:43] Hearts can be turned let me oh God be
[2:33:46] stirred in this hour to realize there
[2:33:50] must be an
[2:33:52] Awakening a realization of the
[2:33:54] Fulfillment of the promises but the
[2:33:57] Gentiles have rejected their Revival and
[2:34:00] even many in the message Community will
[2:34:03] do the same they will think the bride's
[2:34:07] Revival is only mechanics just word we
[2:34:10] got it it's the
[2:34:12] word and in doing so they'll condemn
[2:34:14] prayer lines oh of course unless they're
[2:34:16] having
[2:34:17] one if it's them and they sanction it
[2:34:20] well it's
[2:34:22] okay listen you don't know I have been
[2:34:25] to churches priest in their
[2:34:27] pulpits where the altar was moved to the
[2:34:32] basement they wasn't going to have
[2:34:33] nobody snotting around their
[2:34:38] altar others condemn any sensation or
[2:34:42] emotion upon receiving the Holy
[2:34:45] Ghost
[2:34:48] I'm talking about the
[2:34:50] status it's hard to believe I know I
[2:34:53] know some of you think I'm making this
[2:34:54] up but I'm
[2:34:57] not
[2:34:58] listen I'm going to be very vague about
[2:35:01] this because I don't want to hurt
[2:35:03] anybody but I was in a message church
[2:35:05] just some years back walking down the
[2:35:08] hallway with one of the
[2:35:10] pastors and there was a sign board they
[2:35:13] used for witnessing and it lists the
[2:35:16] Mysteries that have been
[2:35:17] restored and one of them was listed was
[2:35:21] the mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[2:35:24] Ghost without
[2:35:27] Sensations and I stopped the pastor in
[2:35:29] the
[2:35:31] hallway cuz I it was
[2:35:34] incredulous I said you you do know that
[2:35:37] isn't right don't
[2:35:39] you that's a misuse of a
[2:35:43] quote and and by only taking part part
[2:35:46] of it and it's
[2:35:48] wrong what you're teaching there is
[2:35:51] wrong and why do you insist on keeping
[2:35:55] that of course he knew how how I believe
[2:35:58] and he just Pat me on the shoulder I
[2:35:59] know I know I know and on down to The
[2:36:02] Minister's office I went with
[2:36:08] him I just want to show you
[2:36:11] listen I've been through the
[2:36:14] message they have their one
[2:36:16] quote I have over a hundred and I picked
[2:36:20] out a few Choice ones to show
[2:36:23] you because I want you to fully
[2:36:28] understand what comes with the Holy
[2:36:32] Ghost we're going to go to God hiding
[2:36:35] himself in Simplicity this
[2:36:39] slide and this is as the seals were
[2:36:42] being opened the Methodist said when we
[2:36:46] shouted we had it but they didn't the
[2:36:49] nazarin said when they lived holy they
[2:36:52] had it but they didn't the Pentecostal
[2:36:55] said we speak in tongues we got it but
[2:36:59] they didn't see God unfolded himself not
[2:37:04] in Sensations no that's Sensations yet
[2:37:09] with
[2:37:10] it see he's not unfolding a sensation
[2:37:15] he's giv you the person of Christ but
[2:37:18] there's a sensation that comes with
[2:37:20] sensation is a
[2:37:21] feeling it's an
[2:37:24] awareness that's what it is if I feel a
[2:37:27] sensation I'm aware something is
[2:37:29] touching my hand I'm aware something is
[2:37:33] crawling on my face it's a
[2:37:35] sensation right and when Christ comes in
[2:37:38] your life you are aware he's entered
[2:37:43] let's go to The Sixth Seal to see if if
[2:37:46] I if I'm right as he says in the Sixth
[2:37:49] Seal here it all is it isn't emotion let
[2:37:53] me tell you let's make sure we
[2:37:55] understand the Holy Ghost is not a jump
[2:37:58] that's right it's not a shout it's not a
[2:38:01] feeling it's not chills going down your
[2:38:04] back it's not speaking tongues speaking
[2:38:06] in tongues is a gift of the spirit it's
[2:38:08] not the spirit amen it isn't a motion
[2:38:13] though a motion accomp
[2:38:21] it
[2:38:23] well let's go further into 63 now I
[2:38:26] could have went prior 63 and got a bunch
[2:38:30] more and I could actually bring out more
[2:38:33] from here but I'm just bringing you a
[2:38:35] few
[2:38:37] because because I hear people say
[2:38:40] brother Tim you're only preaching your
[2:38:42] narrative this is my story
[2:38:46] it is the whole
[2:38:50] message so watch this there is a only
[2:38:54] there's only one way provided by god
[2:38:56] notice ju July of 63 if the Holy Ghost
[2:39:00] is on you this word is Vindicated to you
[2:39:03] because Jesus said these signs shall
[2:39:05] follow them that believe to all the
[2:39:07] world to Every Creature amen God's
[2:39:08] provided way what are those
[2:39:11] signs in my name they shall cast out
[2:39:13] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[2:39:16] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:39:18] they shall
[2:39:19] recover we could go on quoting but you
[2:39:21] get it let's go to the next one and this
[2:39:24] is paradox and he preaches a paradox
[2:39:26] which means a
[2:39:28] miracle so he could easily title this a
[2:39:32] miracle so he said for me to live as
[2:39:35] Christ Hallelujah I believe that the
[2:39:37] same God that fell on the day of
[2:39:39] Pentecost upon his churches a pillar of
[2:39:41] fire and divid himself with clothing
[2:39:43] tongues among his people is here tonight
[2:39:45] it is the same God he was then he is
[2:39:48] today with the same Holy Ghost I know
[2:39:51] it's a miracle a paradox it cannot be
[2:39:54] explained emotions screaming crying and
[2:39:58] so forth cannot be explained but it's a
[2:40:02] miracle a paradox how God does it it's
[2:40:05] the what is all of this it's the Unseen
[2:40:09] God dwelling in the human heart making
[2:40:12] himself visible by vindicating his word
[2:40:15] that he's a same yesterday today and
[2:40:20] forever well if that in enough lless
[2:40:24] Journey over to
[2:40:25] spport and let's see this
[2:40:29] one you people standing here now look
[2:40:32] don't you rely upon some
[2:40:35] emotion although it has emotion in
[2:40:42] it I thought it was without feeling
[2:40:46] your Prophet didn't teach that that is
[2:40:49] not a restored mystery that's a lie from
[2:40:52] Satan by the misuse of the word of God
[2:40:56] he did it to
[2:40:58] Jesus he used the word to try to get him
[2:41:01] to fall I'm not falling for it that's
[2:41:04] right let's go a little
[2:41:06] further
[2:41:08] 64 let's traveling to 64 here any birth
[2:41:12] is a mess I don't care where it's at if
[2:41:14] it's in the p pin or a hospital a birth
[2:41:17] is a mess so is the new birth it'll make
[2:41:20] you do things you didn't think you would
[2:41:22] it'll make you get down at the altar and
[2:41:25] cry and scream wash the pain off your
[2:41:28] face yeah that's needed in message
[2:41:29] churches too raise your hands praise God
[2:41:32] speak in tongues and all kinds of things
[2:41:34] the new birth will do
[2:41:38] that because it's a Zeus Street's way of
[2:41:41] doing
[2:41:42] it I didn't read that I Miss that's way
[2:41:46] you've been reading it I'm I'm not
[2:41:48] pointing at you I'm pointing at
[2:41:51] you the new birth will do that because
[2:41:54] it's God's provided way to be born
[2:42:00] again is that not enough what about the
[2:42:03] seed coming to maturity brother brandom
[2:42:05] starts and he said you know like the
[2:42:07] seed that is planted must come back to
[2:42:09] the grain again so and mighty God
[2:42:11] unveiled he said and now it's rip here
[2:42:14] we are in that time of ESS to bring him
[2:42:17] back exactly like he was at the
[2:42:19] beginning this is what to expect at this
[2:42:22] journey his say Ministry the same Jesus
[2:42:25] the Same power the same Holy Ghost the
[2:42:28] same one that came down on the day of
[2:42:30] Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost is
[2:42:32] manifested today from glory to glory to
[2:42:35] glory and is back to its original seed
[2:42:39] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with
[2:42:41] the same signs same wonders same baptism
[2:42:45] same kind of people acting the same way
[2:42:48] with the same power the same sensation
[2:42:51] it's from Glory unto glory and the next
[2:42:54] will be changed from this Glory into a
[2:42:57] body like his own glorious body where we
[2:43:00] shall see
[2:43:02] him so brother brandom tells us here
[2:43:04] it'll have the same
[2:43:09] sensation
[2:43:11] well brother Tim we need deep teaching
[2:43:14] got to have it from the depths well you
[2:43:16] can't get more deeper of a sermon than
[2:43:20] future
[2:43:22] home you know when a man receives a
[2:43:26] baptism of fire there's a lot of noise
[2:43:29] around here they think that's a shame to
[2:43:32] hear people scream and shout like
[2:43:35] that that's too deep for too
[2:43:40] many go ahead let's go to why it had to
[2:43:43] be
[2:43:44] Shepherds I'm Consulting the books I've
[2:43:49] seen jumping spells and joy spells but
[2:43:51] there was nobody hurt the mountains rung
[2:43:54] out and the sun went down and everything
[2:43:57] took place but there was nobody hurt
[2:43:59] I've seen meetings where the power God
[2:44:01] was revealed to the people and they were
[2:44:03] free from the world and the things of
[2:44:05] the world and the joy of the Lord filled
[2:44:07] the congregation and they stood and
[2:44:09] screamed and cried and shouted to the
[2:44:11] top of their voice for the glory of God
[2:44:14] I never did see anything disorderly they
[2:44:17] was always right in order because they
[2:44:21] had recognized that their name had been
[2:44:24] written in the Lamb's Book of Life from
[2:44:27] before the foundation of the world
[2:44:31] hallelujah amen when you see your name
[2:44:34] in the book when you see your part of
[2:44:37] the
[2:44:38] promise but brother Tim you missed it I
[2:44:42] mean you're way off on the deep end it
[2:44:44] this is is a word Revival it's just word
[2:44:47] word it's just word only man well okay
[2:44:51] let's just see what the word does let's
[2:44:54] go to Broken sist 65 we're coming close
[2:44:59] to the end of the prophet's warnings
[2:45:02] education can never bring life so you
[2:45:04] can't educate them into this message
[2:45:06] that's it takes the spirit of God to
[2:45:09] bring life and the life must not come
[2:45:11] out of an intellectual
[2:45:13] Revival but it's got to come out of the
[2:45:15] Bible word Revival is everybody on page
[2:45:19] all right word Revival and that word is
[2:45:22] the same yesterday today and forever and
[2:45:24] when it falls today and quickens you get
[2:45:28] the same results he did in Acts two
[2:45:31] exactly it always has it always will be
[2:45:34] because the spirit of God conditions the
[2:45:37] atmosphere well brother Tim the
[2:45:38] atmosphere just a right in my church for
[2:45:41] there to be Revival in it well I tell
[2:45:43] you you got a job job that's right you
[2:45:47] got a job to do change the atmosphere
[2:45:50] until the holy spirit is welcome
[2:45:55] again and I didn't even bring for you
[2:45:58] the one from invisible
[2:46:01] Union which the only kind the word can
[2:46:03] bring forth is those acts 238 screaming
[2:46:08] yelling youngans miserable creatures
[2:46:10] that they think they are but our Prophet
[2:46:13] called you miserable
[2:46:16] for refusing to wash jesus'
[2:46:20] feet so what will cause the Gentiles to
[2:46:23] be cut
[2:46:24] off I want you to see this this was
[2:46:27] taught in the leodan age by the leoan
[2:46:31] messenger your
[2:46:35] message let's turn to Romans
[2:46:38] 11:19 if you go listen to this you'll
[2:46:42] hear what brother brandham says
[2:46:46] and he says Thou will say then the
[2:46:49] branches were broken off that I might be
[2:46:51] grafted in now what he types Paul is
[2:46:53] using and he's talking about Israel has
[2:46:56] not received the gospel and it's turned
[2:46:58] to the Gentiles and he said what has
[2:47:00] happened is that there has been the
[2:47:03] Olive Tree that the branches were cut
[2:47:06] off that a wild Branch a wild Olive
[2:47:10] Branch would be would be um grafted in
[2:47:15] all right and he said you Gentiles are
[2:47:17] the Wild Olive Branch that has been
[2:47:20] grafted onto the tree and he said so you
[2:47:23] will say the branches broken off that I
[2:47:26] might be grafted in well he said it's
[2:47:30] because of unbelief they were broken off
[2:47:33] this is why they were broken off they
[2:47:34] were broken off because of unbelief and
[2:47:37] thou standest by faith but be not high
[2:47:40] minded but
[2:47:41] fear for if God spared not the natural
[2:47:44] branches take heed that he spare not
[2:47:47] thee behold therefore the goodness and
[2:47:50] severity of God on them which fail
[2:47:52] severity but toward thee goodness if
[2:47:55] thou continue in his goodness
[2:47:58] otherwise Thou shalt be cut off so if
[2:48:02] the Gentiles are coming to their
[2:48:05] fullness to their end what's going to
[2:48:08] happen to them they are going to reject
[2:48:12] Christ just like Israel did 2,000 years
[2:48:16] ago and will be cut off and the original
[2:48:21] Olive Branch will be put back in and the
[2:48:24] finishing up will be the gospel turned
[2:48:27] into the
[2:48:29] Jews so here we are I'm reading you the
[2:48:33] road sign there's a saw
[2:48:36] out a pruning shear and God is about to
[2:48:41] cut off the
[2:48:43] Gentiles now let me take you to the
[2:48:45] leodan age brother bradam says in there
[2:48:49] he said we're closing the church ages
[2:48:52] Paul said if God Spar not the olive
[2:48:53] original Olive Branch but cut it off
[2:48:55] because of unbelief is that right what
[2:48:57] caused them to be cut off because they
[2:49:00] rejected Pentecost is that right on the
[2:49:03] day of Pentecost they made fun and
[2:49:05] blasphemed the Holy Ghost when Jesus was
[2:49:08] here they called him B above he was a
[2:49:11] devil he a fortune teller he said I
[2:49:12] forgive you for that but when the Holy
[2:49:14] ghost has come don't you speak against
[2:49:16] it because if you speak against it it'll
[2:49:19] never be forgiven you watch out amen
[2:49:22] remember this comes right back the cycle
[2:49:24] right to the Gentiles and remember when
[2:49:27] Jesus commissioned his disciples not to
[2:49:29] go to the Gentiles is that right but go
[2:49:31] to the lost sheep of Israel how did they
[2:49:33] condemn themselves by blaspheming the
[2:49:35] Holy Ghost calling the spirit of God an
[2:49:38] unclean thing making fun of him when
[2:49:42] they were dancing in the spirit and so
[2:49:44] forth on the day of Pentecost the same
[2:49:47] city they made fun of it Titus killed
[2:49:50] them in there and their blood run out of
[2:49:51] the gatesway and they eat their own
[2:49:54] children and everything in that same
[2:49:55] Century that's right and one of the
[2:49:58] greatest nations in the world became the
[2:49:59] lowest and Scattered to the Four Winds
[2:50:01] of the Earth because why unbelief and
[2:50:04] that was the original stump the original
[2:50:06] tree and he said now at the first tree
[2:50:09] was holy it Branch was holy the original
[2:50:11] tree and because they disbelieved the
[2:50:13] Pentecostal Mage that Paul was preaching
[2:50:16] God cut him off and took a wild Olive
[2:50:19] Tree which is the Gentiles us and
[2:50:21] grafted Us in that we might live off the
[2:50:24] substance of that tree now how much more
[2:50:27] in this day when we're rejecting the
[2:50:29] Pentecostal message that come down to
[2:50:32] the church ages how much more is God
[2:50:34] going to able to take off that old wild
[2:50:38] tree off of it anyhow and let some other
[2:50:41] come in because he will reject it
[2:50:44] because of their
[2:50:46] unbelief so a sign that we are close to
[2:50:51] the end of the Gentile ages and the
[2:50:54] Rapture will be a rejection of Christ
[2:50:58] which is the rejection of
[2:51:01] Pentecost because that's where what is
[2:51:05] Pentecost is the Holy Spirit the spirit
[2:51:08] of Christ poured out oh yes but I got
[2:51:12] some good news oh yeah
[2:51:16] amen I have some good
[2:51:18] news it ain't all bad
[2:51:21] news yeah been a rough Journey come
[2:51:24] through some bad
[2:51:26] neighborhoods been a lot of warning
[2:51:29] signs but let me tell you something when
[2:51:32] you see these things come to
[2:51:35] pass what were you instructed to do by
[2:51:38] the book look up the road ends here
[2:51:42] hallelujah but it goes up there
[2:51:45] look up for your Redemption BR
[2:51:49] n because guess what after the
[2:51:53] crucifixion after the crucifixion after
[2:51:56] he's totally crucified and death comes
[2:51:58] the
[2:52:00] resurrection and I already see men and
[2:52:03] women and boys and girls coming out of
[2:52:05] the tomb of formalism of Resurrection
[2:52:08] out of do denominationalism out of
[2:52:10] Creeds of man I see a men and women
[2:52:13] rising up
[2:52:15] amen skin coming on the body amen what
[2:52:18] is it a bunch of bones that have been
[2:52:20] laying there bearing for many many years
[2:52:23] and life is coming to the body which is
[2:52:25] a Vindication the Rapture is in hand God
[2:52:29] putting skin on a
[2:52:31] people that'll bring the gospel to the
[2:52:33] last days with the signs and wonders of
[2:52:35] it to the
[2:52:38] world watch man what of the night I've
[2:52:42] told you about the night
[2:52:46] been some morbid horrible
[2:52:48] scenes ain't nothing like what's fixing
[2:52:51] to
[2:52:54] come the
[2:52:56] spirit the
[2:52:58] spirit that attacked the Jews the other
[2:53:03] day can only attack Us in the
[2:53:05] ecclesiastical
[2:53:07] manner I'm talking about whel there'll
[2:53:09] be persecution here there
[2:53:11] others but when the bride leaves from
[2:53:14] here
[2:53:18] you think they are just after the Jews
[2:53:21] and want to exterminate
[2:53:22] them they want to destroy all
[2:53:27] Christianity and guess what the spirit
[2:53:30] within this nation will join with
[2:53:34] them already you see laws
[2:53:38] changing already you see things
[2:53:41] happening in our universities taking
[2:53:43] over by
[2:53:47] absolutely
[2:53:49] crazies
[2:53:51] leftist ping into the youth until they
[2:53:54] don't know right from
[2:53:57] wrong they're like a Muslim child in
[2:53:59] Gaza who's Tau from the day he's born to
[2:54:02] hate a Jew and there're nothing but dogs
[2:54:05] and should be exterminated and Destroy
[2:54:07] everyone you can and and got their
[2:54:09] little coloring books and everything
[2:54:10] else you know and and they they do
[2:54:13] practice runs and everything thing else
[2:54:15] killing the Jews destroying them but
[2:54:17] listen they're not just after the Jews
[2:54:20] they want to all this the true Seed of
[2:54:23] Abraham they're going to be after the
[2:54:25] church when the bride leaves and they
[2:54:26] would get you but the Bible said you
[2:54:29] should pray always to escape the things
[2:54:32] that are coming on the earth and be
[2:54:34] counted worthy to stand before the son
[2:54:36] of man but let me tell you friends you
[2:54:39] see that they may hang him on a Roman
[2:54:42] Tree they may come and every kind of way
[2:54:45] and crucify him and the big
[2:54:47] denominational stones to try to keep
[2:54:50] Christ in the Tomb but there will be an
[2:54:53] Easter for he said I'll bring back a
[2:54:56] church in the same power I'll bring back
[2:54:59] that bride like she was there in the
[2:55:01] beginning with the same signs the same
[2:55:03] fruit the same things that he did I'll
[2:55:06] bring her back I will restore sayeth the
[2:55:08] Lord I'll tell you what church look from
[2:55:12] this time on not to go down but to go
[2:55:17] up hallelujah look from this moment on
[2:55:21] to go forward not backwards look for
[2:55:24] this moment Hallelujah not to not to go
[2:55:27] down into death like every other Revival
[2:55:29] has done but be among those alive and
[2:55:32] remain at the coming of the
[2:55:36] Lord the world
[2:55:38] groans for manifested
[2:55:42] Sons but if there was ever time to
[2:55:46] shine oh yes it's like the Morning

[2:58:27] love me with all their heart and with
[2:58:31] all their soul and with all that's in me
[2:58:35] that's what he wants
