[32:28] from brother
[32:29] ron spencer this morning and he just
[32:32] sent a word to me and said the lord just
[32:34] told him that the spirit of god would

[32:37] would have a
[32:38] a real meeting here this morning he said

[32:54] hallelujah
[32:57] the prophet of god said five minutes in

[33:02] school amen
[33:05] his word is life and we want to greet
[33:08] each one of you
[33:09] from brother erickson and the family and
[33:11] the church true word want to say god
[33:13] bless you and
[33:14] amen and we want to greet each one of
[33:16] them that are
[33:17] listening this morning and amen and i
[33:20] just want to
[33:20] to take to the word of the lord this
[33:22] morning and just
[33:24] a few things to speak to you today from
[33:26] our hearts and
[33:27] if we go to the book of revelations we'd
[33:29] like to look in the third chapter
[33:32] uh i think that it's a powerful time
[33:35] that we live
[33:36] and i want to read here from the 20th
[33:38] verse
[33:40] and down to the 22nd verse
[33:44] revelation chapter 3
[33:48] for behold i stand at the door and knock
[33:53] and if any man hear my voice and open
[33:56] the door
[33:58] i will come into him
[34:02] and will sup with him and he with me
[34:07] now to him that overcometh will i grant
[34:11] to set with me
[34:12] in my throne now i want you to realize
[34:16] this is the first age that's been
[34:18] offered this
[34:21] to set with me and my throne as i
[34:24] overcame and sat down with my father in
[34:27] his throne
[34:29] now he that hath an ear
[34:32] let him hear what the spirit saith
[34:35] unto the churches amen we ask the lord
[34:38] to bless his word today
[34:40] as you may be seated i i want to
[34:43] just take a little thought from this
[34:45] today and speak to you
[34:47] on speak what the spirit saith
[34:51] on speak what the spirit saith
[34:54] i think of today of the grace that we
[34:58] have of
[34:59] having the message of the hour to be
[35:01] able to have
[35:02] a prophet of god at the age that uh that
[35:05] we have seen
[35:06] such outstanding manifestations and
[35:09] vindications of the omnipotence of god
[35:12] i believe that we're standing in a
[35:14] position where we've been able to see
[35:15] more
[35:16] of the power of god than any age since
[35:19] the time that jesus christ himself
[35:21] walked upon the earth more
[35:22] vindications of his resurrection and his
[35:25] power and it was anointing we we've been
[35:27] blessed to be
[35:28] have this kind of seat amen and to be
[35:30] able to see and i
[35:32] think sometimes that of course as the
[35:34] message churches and the
[35:35] men of god around the world seeing such
[35:37] a display of the power of god
[35:40] in a prophet that many times that they
[35:42] get to looking at the prophet maybe a
[35:44] little more than they're looking
[35:45] at the one who was behind the prophet
[35:48] and
[35:48] uh and that's one thing i i never want
[35:51] to lose focus
[35:52] of what it is that we're actually doing
[35:55] and what
[35:55] william branham was introducing to the
[35:57] church was a true christianity
[35:59] it was a true power it was a true a true
[36:02] view of the resurrected jesus christ and
[36:06] brother branham again and again would
[36:07] let us know that it wasn't
[36:09] him it wasn't him and that i think that
[36:12] is so
[36:13] amazing that he would say even anointed
[36:15] ones in the end time brother branham
[36:17] will say
[36:18] i wasn't the one that appeared down on
[36:20] the river
[36:21] i was only standing there when he
[36:23] appeared and
[36:24] i'm not the one that performs these
[36:26] things and foretells these things as
[36:28] they happen as perfect as they are
[36:30] i'm only the one that's near when he
[36:33] does it
[36:34] i was only a voice that he used to say
[36:37] it
[36:38] it wasn't what i knew it's what i
[36:41] surrendered
[36:42] myself to now that he spoke through me
[36:45] it isn't me
[36:46] it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[36:49] a manifestation of the son of man
[36:52] amen and to think that brother branham
[36:54] would show you that the
[36:55] the thing that he was projecting what he
[36:58] was saying was
[37:00] is this is not me friends this is what
[37:02] i'm surrendering to
[37:03] and to think that a man who could so
[37:06] surrender himself to god
[37:08] that god could operate like that through
[37:10] a human being not through an angel
[37:12] not through a man without mistakes not
[37:15] through a man
[37:16] without trouble but through a human
[37:17] being that god could so manifest himself
[37:20] because man is designed
[37:22] that he's able to surrender to the great
[37:24] anointing of god
[37:26] and that god could show his resurrection
[37:28] power through a
[37:29] human being and i think of that today
[37:32] because i realize that a prophet is
[37:34] trying to tell the church in the
[37:36] in the church age book and he'll go
[37:37] through and tell us that there will come
[37:39] in the last days
[37:40] there will come spirits in the land
[37:42] there will be invasions and invasions of
[37:44] arab and invasions of every kind of
[37:46] spirit
[37:48] as the scripture says amen that hell
[37:50] will be renewed from beneath and
[37:52] and it will enlarge its borders and we
[37:54] know that a prophet would announce the
[37:56] god of this evil age and he would say
[37:58] it's satan's eden and
[37:59] he would say hell is bullying over so
[38:01] all these things are pouring out into
[38:03] the age that we're living in
[38:05] and and he would specifically say that
[38:07] the antichrist spirit
[38:09] amen above all the things he wants to do
[38:11] is he wants to make you lukewarm formal
[38:13] and powerless he said but now if the if
[38:16] the true
[38:17] church the true bride is able to discern
[38:21] the antichrist spirit that works within
[38:23] the framework of the church if she could
[38:24] discern that spirit
[38:26] but not just discern it she should be
[38:29] able to withstand it
[38:30] not just discern but to withstand that
[38:33] antichrist spirit which
[38:34] is only a religious spirit and a
[38:37] religious spirit to take away the fire
[38:39] to take away the power of god
[38:41] to take away the reality of resurrection
[38:43] and i say that because
[38:45] amen that he is able to give us a place
[38:47] that we're
[38:48] that we're able to say that someone in
[38:50] this last day will discern it
[38:52] and withstand that spirit now the
[38:55] prophet will tell us
[38:56] that those spirits are here questions
[38:58] and answers he'll say that those
[39:00] uh those spirits those demon powers he
[39:03] said they're actually
[39:04] powerless until they can find a body do
[39:07] you know the devil is powerless
[39:09] until he can find somebody to work
[39:10] through amen and that's what the prophet
[39:13] is telling us that if we could keep the
[39:15] devil
[39:16] from finding something to work through
[39:18] he would be powerless
[39:20] is that right he meant now think about
[39:22] this because then the prophet of god
[39:23] said with that in mind of course
[39:25] he says it brings us to another thought
[39:28] that the holy spirit covers the earth
[39:30] but it's almost helpless until it gets
[39:33] into you and me
[39:34] god is depending on you and i the holy
[39:37] spirit the earth
[39:38] is full of the spirit of god but it's
[39:41] poured out but it cannot operate
[39:43] until it comes into us and we
[39:47] human beings will operate amen to think
[39:49] today that god
[39:51] is saying to the church he's looking for
[39:53] eyes he's looking for legs he's looking
[39:55] for hands
[39:56] he's looking for bodies he he is looking
[39:59] for mouths he's looking for someone
[40:01] amen that the spirit of god can claim
[40:03] them
[40:04] and use them for the glory of god now
[40:06] we've got to recognize then there's two
[40:08] spirits trying to
[40:10] operate there's two spirits trying to
[40:12] find vessels
[40:13] amen and both of those spirits need that
[40:16] to operate or to become
[40:17] powerful amen in this in this a
[40:20] dimension that we're living in
[40:22] now the prophet of god said of course
[40:23] we're going to have to them to resist
[40:25] the devil
[40:26] and then he will flee from us see not
[40:29] only just discerning but resisting
[40:31] and the prophet of god said to resist
[40:33] that devil means to turning down
[40:35] to resist him just to walk away from him
[40:38] amen
[40:38] uh god said a certain thing no matter
[40:41] what he's trying to tell you
[40:43] don't you even listen to him you have
[40:46] ears and your ears are deaf to anything
[40:50] else but what the spirit says
[40:52] now to he that hath an ear listens now
[40:55] see what the spirit saith unto the
[40:57] church and the one that's got the
[40:59] listening post let him
[41:01] catch what the spirit says to the
[41:03] churches
[41:04] now i think it's amazing that the
[41:06] prophet begins to tell us
[41:08] amen that the spirit of the devil is
[41:10] powerless
[41:11] unless he can get into something and
[41:13] then he tells you to resist the devil is
[41:15] to turn him down
[41:16] or in other words not to listen to the
[41:18] devil so how does
[41:20] the devil really approach the church he
[41:22] approaches it through
[41:23] word but before it's a word it's a
[41:25] thought and a spirit places
[41:27] thoughts into the mind or into the life
[41:30] of a person and then either they
[41:32] give life to that thought or they kill
[41:34] that thought
[41:35] in the channel or the womb of the mind
[41:37] now we find out a prophet is saying then
[41:39] someone
[41:40] is going to have to learn how to
[41:42] recognize
[41:43] the thought of the enemy and turn it
[41:46] down while it's still
[41:47] in the thought process amen and kill it
[41:50] resist it
[41:51] and then resist the devil and say to him
[41:54] you can't work through me
[41:55] i tell you this morning i pray amen that
[41:58] we have the church of the living god and
[42:00] and right here this morning i pray that
[42:02] the devil is out of a job
[42:04] i pray that the church has come together
[42:06] this morning to say
[42:07] you're not going to work through me the
[42:09] devil has a
[42:10] he has a purpose now to make you look
[42:12] more formal and powerless
[42:14] and i pray this morning that every
[42:16] individual in this assembly will say
[42:18] amen that satan you're not going to work
[42:20] through me
[42:21] you're powerless unless you can work
[42:23] through somebody amen i don't know about
[42:25] my brother but i know about me
[42:27] you're not going to work through me
[42:28] you're not going to use my mind you're
[42:30] not going to use my thoughts you're not
[42:32] going to use my voice
[42:34] you're not going to use my action matter
[42:36] of fact amen this morning maybe somebody
[42:38] has allowed him to do so but i say with
[42:41] you this morning
[42:42] you are to sell the devil you're fired i
[42:44] tell you what a blessing this morning to
[42:45] be able to fire the devil amen
[42:47] amen can you imagine i tell you this if
[42:49] you start firing the devil
[42:50] you know what he's going to say to you
[42:52] but i've worked here so long you can't
[42:54] fire me
[42:55] but listen you've been given the power
[42:57] and the authority this morning
[42:58] as a prophet of god said at some point
[43:01] the church has a
[43:02] authority like the father has and
[43:05] whoever he hires is hired
[43:07] and whoever he fires is fired let me
[43:10] give it to you in the scripture
[43:11] whatsoever you bind on earth shall be
[43:13] bound in heaven whatsoever you shall
[43:15] loosen the earth shall be loosed in
[43:16] heaven
[43:17] there is an authority in the church of
[43:19] the living god
[43:20] that you have the power to fire the
[43:22] devil this morning
[43:25] however he's working however he's trying
[43:27] to work you can fire him this morning
[43:29] and i know that devil well enough to
[43:31] know he don't want to go by himself
[43:33] amen and he's going to say to you but i
[43:35] worked for your mama i worked for your
[43:37] daddy i worked for your grand
[43:38] i've worked for your family for years
[43:41] but you're gonna have to tell the devil
[43:43] don't matter how long you work for us
[43:45] you're fired this morning
[43:46] and you'll never work for my family
[43:49] again
[43:49] amen pack your bags take off amen you're
[43:53] not welcome here
[43:54] we're not going to and we're not going
[43:56] to make a a savage package with you
[43:58] amen we're going to destroy you we're
[44:01] going to burn
[44:03] every remnant that you are amen we're
[44:05] going to
[44:06] fire that devil i think it ought to be a
[44:09] day today that we are the fire every
[44:12] devil
[44:13] every devil and depression every devil
[44:15] of nervousness
[44:16] you want to say you're out of a job this
[44:18] morning amen you are to
[44:20] tell that devil go back where you come
[44:23] from satan
[44:24] amen this is not your home
[44:29] you may think i'm overboard but the
[44:30] prophet of god used the story
[44:32] in the bible when he said that jesus
[44:35] came to the demons
[44:36] in gardea remember the man who was in
[44:39] the tombs
[44:40] and he was naked cutting himself chained
[44:42] there and jesus went there
[44:44] and he delivered that man remember and
[44:46] he said to the devil go
[44:48] and what did the devil say amen amen the
[44:51] prophet of god said satan
[44:52] asked if he could stay the bible said he
[44:55] asked if he could stay
[44:56] amen and he just wanted a vessel to get
[44:59] into
[45:00] amen which brother branham uses to prove
[45:03] that
[45:04] satan is powerless without a vessel so
[45:07] since he couldn't get
[45:08] a human body he meant he took an animal
[45:11] body
[45:11] and he run that herd of swine out into
[45:14] the out into the lake and killed it
[45:16] so it tells you this amen that if the
[45:18] devil can get a hold of something
[45:19] he will destroy it he will destroy
[45:22] everything that he touches
[45:23] amen but i'll tell you this amen that
[45:26] jesus gave power to the church
[45:28] that they was able to say to satan amen
[45:31] that you have
[45:32] no power to work here amen and you have
[45:35] been given that authority this morning
[45:37] now
[45:38] you don't have to listen to the devil
[45:42] now there's some people you're going to
[45:43] have to listen to but you don't have to
[45:45] listen to the devil
[45:47] amen can i get some audience participant
[45:50] i want you to say to somebody you don't
[45:51] have to listen
[45:53] amen amen isn't that isn't that good
[45:55] young people there's somebody you don't
[45:57] have to listen to
[45:59] amen the devil starts talking to you you
[46:01] can tell him like one of the boys back
[46:02] at the church he'll say this
[46:04] not my mama somebody tells one of them
[46:06] young boys you got to do this or that
[46:08] he'll say not my mama
[46:09] and i'll tell you what when the devil
[46:11] says something to you all you got to
[46:13] satan not my lord
[46:14] you're not my god you have no right to
[46:17] even talk to me
[46:18] amen listen you can fire the devil this
[46:20] morning
[46:21] and leave him unemployed
[46:24] amen now we're taught that we
[46:28] can resist the devil just resist it
[46:31] no matter what he's trying you don't
[46:33] even have to listen to him
[46:34] you can just resist him amen in other
[46:37] words you can deafen your ear to him
[46:39] amen
[46:41] so you have a prophet saying that you
[46:43] don't have to listen
[46:45] but you've got to have an ear for what
[46:47] the spirit says
[46:50] now the scripture is telling us that the
[46:53] one that has an
[46:54] ear is also the overcomer the in that
[46:57] beautiful
[46:58] the one that can listen to the word is
[47:01] also the overcomer the word
[47:05] will make you an overcomer the word will
[47:08] put you in victory
[47:10] the word will put you over your enemy
[47:13] every time
[47:15] i think of this because the scripture
[47:17] says in that allowed to see an age
[47:19] that he knew there would be some
[47:20] overcomers in there
[47:22] and he said to he that overcometh now of
[47:25] course we realize
[47:26] that this scripture was written 2 000
[47:29] years ago
[47:31] but it was written about somebody
[47:35] now don't think that when he said that
[47:36] he that overcometh that
[47:38] god has an empty mind and he don't know
[47:41] who that's talking about
[47:43] because in the book of matthew the 20th
[47:45] chapter we found that they said to jesus
[47:48] they actually said to him put me on your
[47:51] left hand and put me on your right hand
[47:53] the mother of zebedee uh's children josh
[47:55] zebedee and john
[47:57] and they actually asked and jesus said i
[48:00] can't give you that position
[48:02] for it is prepared for them which my
[48:05] father has given it
[48:06] and the prophet of god said that's for
[48:08] that word bride
[48:10] the overcomer of the laodicean age
[48:13] so you can see 2 000 years ago
[48:16] somebody was trying to take your seat
[48:18] and jesus was saying oh no
[48:20] that's a special age a special time and
[48:23] it can only be given to a certain people
[48:26] now the prophet will tell us of course
[48:28] in john 17
[48:29] of the foreknowledge of jesus when he
[48:31] said father glorify them
[48:33] with thine own self of the glory which i
[48:35] have with thee before the world was
[48:37] brother brahman reads john 17 and tells
[48:40] us that jesus had foreknowledge of his
[48:42] own disciples
[48:43] in ephesians chapter 1 he will read it
[48:46] with paul
[48:47] and he'll say now according as he has
[48:49] chosen us with him
[48:50] before the foundation of the world that
[48:52] we should be holy and without blame
[48:54] before him and love
[48:55] now paul talks about pre-existence of
[48:58] predestination in god
[49:00] and so does jesus talk about it amen but
[49:03] brother branham brings these two
[49:05] scriptures together to help us
[49:07] now in in questions and answers to
[49:09] genesis 1953
[49:12] brother branham actually says when god
[49:14] created me william brattle
[49:16] i was before the foundation of the world
[49:18] he made my being my spirit
[49:20] i wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[49:22] i know of
[49:23] he said but i was there and i don't
[49:26] believe you're getting it now
[49:28] but just wait a minute jesus told the
[49:30] disciples
[49:31] that he knew them before the foundation
[49:34] of the world
[49:35] and paul said that he chose us in him
[49:39] before the world began so he just tied
[49:41] them two scriptures together
[49:42] now some part of me ormond neville the
[49:45] rest
[49:46] of all of you here i like to include
[49:49] myself don't you
[49:50] and the rest of all of you here that's
[49:53] in christ jesus
[49:54] before the world ever began
[49:58] and here's my analysis of that
[50:01] i like analysis you know amen there's a
[50:03] lot of analysis there's a lot of people
[50:05] gives analysis
[50:06] but here is a prophetic analysis here is
[50:09] when a prophet
[50:10] analyzes what this means he says here's
[50:13] my analysis
[50:15] i think that the people today that are
[50:18] possessed with this spirit
[50:20] or a or the spirit a part of those
[50:23] angelic beings
[50:24] a spirit which rotated off of god that
[50:27] never fell
[50:28] in the beginning and resisted the
[50:31] devil's
[50:32] lie in heaven now look what he's saying
[50:34] he's tying
[50:35] together ephesians 1 john 17
[50:39] and also revelations 3 that overcomer
[50:42] and he's
[50:42] tying it to a spirit that was in heaven
[50:46] that anointed the angels that come from
[50:48] god
[50:49] and that spirit was a spirit that
[50:51] resisted
[50:53] the devil now notice this because again
[50:56] brother adam will bring it up
[50:57] he says and the spirit that's joined
[50:59] with god is one spirit
[51:01] see there's not 40 spirits of angels and
[51:04] god
[51:05] and the spirit that's in you ask
[51:07] yourself sometime
[51:08] where did god get eve's spirit
[51:11] he took it out of adam and where did god
[51:14] get the spirit that's in the church
[51:17] he took it out of jesus christ so the
[51:19] spirit that was in jesus christ
[51:22] come from his father we don't believe in
[51:24] 40 spirits there is one spirit
[51:26] one faith one lord one god he is one
[51:29] spirit now
[51:29] you say well seven spirits but those
[51:31] spirits come from one spirit
[51:33] and that's eternal life or almighty god
[51:36] that
[51:36] spirit that was in the beginning is the
[51:39] same spirit that's in your life today
[51:42] the prophet of god said that spirit that
[51:44] dwells in the church
[51:45] is the spirit that come from heaven that
[51:48] god knew
[51:49] before the foundation of the world that
[51:50] rejected the devil's lie
[51:53] can you imagine that the spirit that god
[51:56] sent from heaven
[51:57] to anoint you was to tell that devil
[52:00] you're a liar amen that you cannot
[52:04] receive the lie of the devil because
[52:06] you're anointed to reject it
[52:09] my when i think about that the spirit
[52:11] had to take a body of flesh for testing
[52:13] had to come
[52:14] and flesh like others now god by the
[52:17] beginning
[52:18] know the spirits which would and would
[52:21] not
[52:22] there you are god in the beginning knew
[52:26] the spirits which would and would not he
[52:29] knew
[52:30] which side you were going to take he
[52:33] knew brother brown says he knew
[52:34] therefore he could predestinate
[52:37] he said but by foreknowledge he can tell
[52:39] you who would be saved
[52:41] and who wouldn't be saved for he knew
[52:44] which
[52:44] person would take up with with spirit
[52:47] amen god knew which spirit you would
[52:50] take up with
[52:51] he knew what you would believe he knew
[52:54] you would be
[52:54] like a lie or hebrew you believe truth
[52:58] amen now look what he's trying to tell
[53:00] you to he that overcometh
[53:02] let him hear let him hear what the
[53:04] spirit
[53:05] saith under the church amen when i think
[53:08] about this
[53:09] in 1959 why cry brother branham and
[53:11] clarksville
[53:12] he'll say this how does the people
[53:14] accept it the holy spirit has one
[53:17] message
[53:18] it's speak the word and go forward
[53:22] that's right don't cry to me amen
[53:25] there's the word
[53:27] speak it and move forward thus saith the
[53:30] lord
[53:31] that's the message of the holy ghost to
[53:34] heathen half an ear
[53:36] let him hear what the spirit is actually
[53:39] saying to the church
[53:41] amen it only has a message speak the
[53:44] word
[53:45] and go forward now here's the thing
[53:48] the bible tells us in isaiah 59 that god
[53:51] made a covenant with the church
[53:53] and it would be with your words and
[53:56] think of this and
[53:57] atmospheres your brother and i'm gonna
[53:58] try it he'll say you speak the word
[54:00] and i will perform it that is my
[54:04] covenant and it can never fail
[54:08] now god knew which which you would take
[54:10] up with he knew that you would either
[54:12] have a wishbone
[54:14] and you would wish you could be that son
[54:16] or he knew you would have a backbone
[54:19] where you could stand and claim the
[54:21] promises of god
[54:22] no matter what condition you are under
[54:26] no matter what condition the world is in
[54:29] the word of god remains true and he
[54:31] looked at this lord to see an age
[54:33] and he looked at this odd to see him
[54:35] condition and he said but i've got a
[54:37] spirit in there
[54:38] amen i've got a spirit in that bride
[54:41] that they will not consider the
[54:43] condition
[54:44] but they will speak the word of god oh i
[54:46] pray to god tonight
[54:48] amen this morning that god would awaken
[54:50] the spirit of resurrection in the church
[54:53] that the word becomes true no matter
[54:56] what situation they're in
[54:57] god didn't give us a wish bone he gave
[55:00] us a backbone
[55:01] a stand against every devil to stand
[55:03] against
[55:04] every instruction that the enemy would
[55:06] try to place in the church
[55:08] that you would withstand that devil on
[55:11] every move that he would make
[55:13] now i want to say a couple of things i
[55:16] wanted
[55:16] to if i can to make it real crystal
[55:18] clear to you
[55:20] amen if you speak the word this is my
[55:22] covenant
[55:24] he said i will perform it now listen
[55:27] he meant some people are waiting to
[55:29] speak
[55:30] when the church becomes anointed they're
[55:33] waiting to speak
[55:34] after the church gets thus saith the
[55:36] lord amen
[55:38] sunday the church is going to have a
[55:39] great move but the prophet of god says
[55:42] in invisible union
[55:43] right here in louisiana he says see it's
[55:46] on
[55:47] it's on the move is on for the bride
[55:51] that's thus saith the lord
[55:54] listen we're not waiting for nothing
[55:56] else the bride has received
[55:58] the thus saith the lord people say well
[56:01] what about this
[56:02] what about that what about this i can't
[56:04] help none of that
[56:05] i don't know about the conditions i
[56:07] don't know about our old bodies
[56:09] i don't know about the trouble but i do
[56:11] know that a prophet of god said
[56:13] the move is on for the bride then the
[56:15] spirit that's within me
[56:17] cannot help but to accept what a prophet
[56:21] of god said
[56:22] and if i have accepted it i've got a
[56:24] right to turn around and say
[56:26] what a prophet has said about the church
[56:28] of the living god
[56:30] can i say some things that are very true
[56:32] some things that are very true
[56:34] in romans chapter 8 paul said in all
[56:36] things we are more
[56:38] than conquerors through him that loved
[56:41] us
[56:42] now in all things we are more than
[56:44] conquerors
[56:45] now i know sometimes you would like to
[56:47] think in some things
[56:48] but paul didn't say in some things he
[56:50] said in all things
[56:52] amen we are more than conquerors amen i
[56:55] tell you this morning
[56:56] you are more than a conqueror i don't
[56:58] care what's happening
[56:59] it doesn't matter what kind of situation
[57:02] you're in
[57:03] i want you to hear what the spirit says
[57:05] to the church
[57:06] you are more than a conqueror amen and i
[57:09] tell you this
[57:10] if you'd fire that devil you could say
[57:12] the same thing
[57:14] i don't devil of dispressing and and
[57:17] uh how could i say it that old devil of
[57:19] depression and discouragement
[57:21] amen he would like to keep you from
[57:24] receiving the fact that you are more
[57:26] than a conqueror
[57:28] to point out your weakness to point out
[57:29] your trial to point out the insecurity
[57:33] to point out all the little problems and
[57:35] the weaknesses in your flesh
[57:37] amen to get you to focus on the wrong
[57:39] part of you
[57:40] if you can take your focus from the word
[57:43] part
[57:43] and put it on the human part then he'll
[57:46] keep you bound the rest of your life
[57:48] but if you would ever start recognizing
[57:50] that before there was a world
[57:52] before there was a star before there was
[57:54] a moon before there was an
[57:56] earth there was a god and i'm a part of
[57:58] that god
[57:59] and he came into this flesh and now
[58:02] deity
[58:03] is on the inside of a human vessel
[58:08] change your focus this morning leave the
[58:11] flesh
[58:12] and move into the spirit of god amen if
[58:14] you let the spirit begin to speak to you
[58:17] you would begin to hear you're more than
[58:19] a conqueror
[58:20] you would begin to hear the spirit say
[58:22] to you
[58:23] it's time to throw down this devil it's
[58:26] time to cast him down
[58:28] it's time to destroy this devil
[58:31] now just in case you think that was
[58:34] isolated to the romans
[58:36] paul said to the philippians i can do
[58:39] all things
[58:40] through christ which strengthen me
[58:45] i can do all things now there's a devil
[58:47] telling you this morning that you can't
[58:51] amen there's a devil this morning saying
[58:53] but that
[58:55] but that situation but this but this
[58:58] now now you've got to recognize that the
[59:00] devil has a way
[59:01] that he just wants to bring reasonable
[59:03] doubt he don't have to disprove the word
[59:06] he don't have to disprove the promise he
[59:08] just wants you to reasonably doubt
[59:11] that that is actually possible in your
[59:13] life but the bible coming from the words
[59:15] of jesus christ said
[59:16] amen to him that believeth all things
[59:20] are
[59:20] possible unto him that believeth then
[59:23] there is nothing
[59:24] that is impossible with the church of
[59:26] the living god
[59:28] amen nothing nothing nothing nothing
[59:31] impossible
[59:32] in philippians 4 i can do all things
[59:35] amen say it with me
[59:36] all things anything
[59:40] that says something different than that
[59:42] is a lie
[59:43] of the devil and i
[59:46] am here to resist him in every area
[59:50] i can amen i'll tell you what i believe
[59:53] there's a line of resistance
[59:55] i believe there's a resisting group of
[59:56] people today called the bride of jesus
[59:59] christ that they tried to stomp us
[1:00:01] out they tried to silence us they're
[1:00:03] trying to shut us up
[1:00:05] but we still are going to resist this
[1:00:06] devil as long as we are
[1:00:08] on the earth we have a resistance
[1:00:11] against the spirit of the enemy
[1:00:13] that could say well you can do all
[1:00:15] things but this
[1:00:17] but see we can do all things now
[1:00:19] anything
[1:00:20] contrary to that is a
[1:00:23] lie romans chapter 4
[1:00:26] verse as it is written i made thee the
[1:00:29] father of many nations
[1:00:30] for before him who believed even god who
[1:00:33] quickeneth the dead
[1:00:34] and calleth those things which be not as
[1:00:37] they
[1:00:38] were if you hear brother branham quote
[1:00:40] this
[1:00:41] he uses this every time as abraham he'll
[1:00:43] say abraham called things that were not
[1:00:45] as though they were
[1:00:46] but if you read the scripture it ain't
[1:00:48] talking about abraham it's talking about
[1:00:50] god
[1:00:51] amen so i got to think well maybe
[1:00:52] brother brown just read it differently
[1:00:54] than
[1:00:54] and just perceived it differently and i
[1:00:57] i read and found with iran said it just
[1:00:59] like romans said it and
[1:01:00] and he said it then he said it with
[1:01:01] abraham until he began to realize
[1:01:04] that abraham had so communicated with
[1:01:07] god
[1:01:07] until he began to take on the nature of
[1:01:10] god and if god said it was this way
[1:01:12] abraham said it was that way there was
[1:01:14] no difference
[1:01:15] in the confession of abraham and the
[1:01:18] confession of god
[1:01:19] though his wife was barren he was still
[1:01:22] professing to be a father
[1:01:24] though his body was incapable he was yet
[1:01:27] saying it was going to be anything
[1:01:30] contrary to that as a lie
[1:01:32] i want you to know this morning you've
[1:01:34] got to be able to recognize
[1:01:37] something contrary to the word as a lie
[1:01:42] it's not a misunderstanding it's not a
[1:01:44] reasonable doubt
[1:01:46] it's a lie anything
[1:01:50] that takes the privilege and the
[1:01:52] redemptive right
[1:01:53] of the bride of christ and minimizes
[1:01:56] dilutes
[1:01:57] waters down tries to rob that
[1:02:00] is a lie and it comes from the devil
[1:02:07] and you say brother wayne i heard one of
[1:02:09] the preachers saying like are you
[1:02:10] calling him the devil oh no
[1:02:11] the spirit coming out of him is though
[1:02:14] i don't care who he is i don't care
[1:02:16] where he's from or what he's saying
[1:02:18] if he takes a redemptive right from this
[1:02:20] bride he is a thief and a robber
[1:02:25] and the devil come to steal kill and
[1:02:27] destroy you so that's pretty rough
[1:02:28] no it's just like jesus preached because
[1:02:32] when he was talking to
[1:02:33] simon peter he said my name is simon
[1:02:36] next thing you know he knew who jesus
[1:02:38] was he said your name is peter
[1:02:40] next thing you know peter said that did
[1:02:42] he couldn't suffer in the flesh
[1:02:43] he didn't think that jesus being the
[1:02:45] christ could suffer on a cross
[1:02:48] and jesus rebuked him in calling the
[1:02:50] devil amen he gave him a good name
[1:02:52] gave him the rock of revelation and then
[1:02:55] told him that he was the devil
[1:02:56] he rebuked the wrong spirit coming out
[1:02:59] of peter
[1:03:00] and i believe any spirit that comes out
[1:03:02] of us
[1:03:03] amen that's contrary to the word of god
[1:03:05] we ought to just rebuke that spirit
[1:03:08] and call it a lie from the devil i'll
[1:03:11] tell you this morning
[1:03:12] there's so many voices now there's so
[1:03:16] many voices and there's so many voices
[1:03:18] in the earth
[1:03:19] that it's absolutely a hard thing
[1:03:21] because it deadens the voice of the
[1:03:23] supernatural
[1:03:24] yeah i'm quoting brother brown now
[1:03:27] amen ben is the voice of the
[1:03:29] supernatural because there's so many
[1:03:31] voices
[1:03:32] now watch brother random said lot's wife
[1:03:34] was destroyed
[1:03:36] because she loved the pleasures of sodom
[1:03:39] greater than the voice of the angel
[1:03:41] do you see watch today how hollywood
[1:03:43] voices are putting pressure on the
[1:03:45] people
[1:03:46] hollywood is trying to uh control the
[1:03:49] way the sisters dress
[1:03:50] amen hollywood controls the way people
[1:03:53] does things
[1:03:54] now the voice of hollywood becomes
[1:03:56] strong
[1:03:57] the voice of modern religion becomes
[1:04:00] strong
[1:04:00] and brother and said the voice in the
[1:04:02] enemy it tries to deaden the voice of
[1:04:05] the supernatural
[1:04:06] now watch this because everything
[1:04:10] that says you cannot it's a lie
[1:04:14] everything that says it's not possible
[1:04:17] is a lie
[1:04:18] anything contrary to the promise of god
[1:04:22] upon your life
[1:04:23] is a lie from the pits of hell
[1:04:27] now notice this because amen now there
[1:04:29] is times
[1:04:30] in great men's life where they believe
[1:04:32] their own thing
[1:04:33] and great men believe the wrong thing
[1:04:35] great men did the wrong thing
[1:04:37] watch apostle peter deny the lord at the
[1:04:39] tomb
[1:04:40] or at the cross he denied the lord
[1:04:42] remember that
[1:04:43] amen but listen on the day of pentecost
[1:04:46] he received
[1:04:47] the spirit of god that's an abstract
[1:04:50] title telling god
[1:04:51] he didn't hold it against him because he
[1:04:54] received the abstract from god
[1:04:57] that the sin wasn't held against him he
[1:04:59] meant but the voice of god
[1:05:01] changed him when he heard that voice i
[1:05:04] i think if there's been no greater
[1:05:06] example of this when apostle paul
[1:05:08] was killing christians walking on the
[1:05:10] road to damascus
[1:05:12] amen and he met a great light and paul
[1:05:15] was a great intellectual man
[1:05:17] but when he heard the voice of god
[1:05:20] he recognized that his intellectual ways
[1:05:24] was actually crucifying jesus christ
[1:05:27] afresh
[1:05:28] amen and the voice of the supernatural
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:31] it actually changed paul and sent him
[1:05:34] another way
[1:05:35] oh the voice of god what it could do for
[1:05:37] a person
[1:05:38] i think about even half an ear let him
[1:05:41] hear the voice
[1:05:42] the one that changed paul the one that
[1:05:44] changed peter
[1:05:45] i tell you there's no greater example as
[1:05:48] of the man lazarus
[1:05:49] amen who was laying them the tomb four
[1:05:51] days gone
[1:05:52] but when jesus come and stood by the
[1:05:54] tomb the man was already dead
[1:05:57] are you hearing me it seems like it's
[1:06:00] too late
[1:06:01] to hear the voice of god it seems like
[1:06:04] it could never happen
[1:06:05] but when jesus came by amen no matter
[1:06:08] the condition
[1:06:09] amen that lazarus was in amen the voice
[1:06:13] of god
[1:06:14] had predestinated a place to cause a
[1:06:17] resurrection in that man
[1:06:21] i'll tell you what hey man it don't get
[1:06:23] any better than that does it
[1:06:24] four days in the grave everybody's
[1:06:26] saying it's too late
[1:06:27] everybody's saying corruption has set in
[1:06:29] there's no way for them to come out of
[1:06:31] it but
[1:06:32] jesus had a vision amen and in that
[1:06:34] vision
[1:06:35] lazarus was going to raise and the voice
[1:06:38] of god
[1:06:39] gave voice to a vision in the face of
[1:06:42] impossibility
[1:06:43] but when jesus called the man by name
[1:06:46] glory to god amen i know he was dead and
[1:06:48] cold i know he was in the tomb
[1:06:50] but he could hear the voice of god past
[1:06:52] the tune
[1:06:55] amen i was preaching one time on the
[1:06:58] prophecied over the valley of dry bones
[1:07:00] and
[1:07:00] he told he told ezekiel he said speak
[1:07:03] he said speak to those dry bones and the
[1:07:06] bible said
[1:07:07] ezekiel went up there and said hear ye
[1:07:09] hold dry bones
[1:07:11] hear ye the word of the lord i thought
[1:07:13] my never seen no bones with ears
[1:07:15] amen but when the word of the god was
[1:07:17] commanded toward them bones
[1:07:19] amen they didn't even have ears on their
[1:07:21] body but god made them hear
[1:07:24] a power that would take them out of any
[1:07:26] situation
[1:07:27] and put life back in them oh i tell you
[1:07:30] this morning
[1:07:30] that same voice is right here in the
[1:07:33] church
[1:07:34] of the living god and is speaking again
[1:07:37] the names of the pride of jesus christ
[1:07:40] by the preacher of this message and i i
[1:07:42] know you might think it's too late but
[1:07:43] it ain't never too late
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:48] oh it ain't never too late brother brian
[1:07:50] said lazarus
[1:07:51] it brought a man out of the dead rotten
[1:07:53] who it ought to go
[1:07:55] he said now it brought that man forth
[1:07:57] after being dead and rotten
[1:07:59] he said what should the voice of god do
[1:08:03] to the church of the living god
[1:08:06] if it would do that for a dead man what
[1:08:08] should the voice do for a church
[1:08:10] that is alive that is full of the power
[1:08:13] of god
[1:08:13] and is full of the life you know how to
[1:08:15] fan the flames of the quickening power
[1:08:18] of the holy ghost you know you know to
[1:08:20] charge
[1:08:21] something on the inside of us yes sir
[1:08:25] amen let us hear let us hear
[1:08:28] what the spirit says under the church
[1:08:32] now
[1:08:33] now the prophet of god would tell us of
[1:08:34] course that in revelation chapter 10
[1:08:38] it's an evening message is that right
[1:08:41] pulling from zechariah 14 in the evening
[1:08:43] time
[1:08:44] there shall be light in isaiah 60 rise
[1:08:47] up and shine
[1:08:49] for thy light has come in revelations 10
[1:08:52] it's going to tell the story how the
[1:08:54] mighty angel come from heaven the great
[1:08:56] covenant angel
[1:08:57] the covenant of the spoken word the
[1:09:00] covenant
[1:09:00] the coveted angel of the word of god
[1:09:02] will come with a book in his hand
[1:09:05] and and he'll be coming as a mighty
[1:09:08] angel
[1:09:08] putting foot on the land and see
[1:09:11] bringing everything
[1:09:12] under his subjection and power by the
[1:09:14] word of promise
[1:09:15] and and the bible tells us clearly that
[1:09:18] john was going to write this he was
[1:09:20] going to write these seven thunders
[1:09:22] and and the bible says john you seal
[1:09:24] those things up
[1:09:27] until the seventh angel sounds now
[1:09:30] if you're a bible student you know that
[1:09:33] every one of those old testament
[1:09:34] prophets knew something great was coming
[1:09:37] and some of them declared it more
[1:09:39] clearly than others
[1:09:41] in daniel 12 he talked about michael
[1:09:43] standing up
[1:09:45] talked about him coming fighting for his
[1:09:46] people when the books were open
[1:09:48] sealing up to the end time isn't it
[1:09:50] amazing that the
[1:09:52] seven church ages amen it has an end
[1:09:55] and the seventh is the end and the
[1:09:57] seventh angel is the end time prophet
[1:09:59] the evening age the token time this
[1:10:02] prophet was going to come
[1:10:03] but everything was hinging on this man
[1:10:06] coming
[1:10:07] and bringing the revelation that book to
[1:10:09] the church
[1:10:10] because the word couldn't come lest
[1:10:12] there be a prophet
[1:10:13] amen that's right the word couldn't come
[1:10:17] unless it's a prophet now how you're
[1:10:18] going to overcome this devil
[1:10:20] is you've got to accept the word you've
[1:10:22] got to hear
[1:10:23] what the spirit is saying now we can say
[1:10:26] in revelation 3
[1:10:27] hear what the spirit says and a lot of
[1:10:29] anybody could make up what the spirit is
[1:10:31] saying
[1:10:32] but it's what it's saying go to
[1:10:33] revelations 10
[1:10:35] and read revelations 10 and hear
[1:10:38] what the spirit is saying it's saying
[1:10:41] that the word would become
[1:10:42] open to the church under an elijah
[1:10:45] anointing to return it back to its
[1:10:47] its original faith the original power
[1:10:50] the
[1:10:51] the life that that struck in the heart
[1:10:53] of those disciples would live again
[1:10:55] the apostolic age would live again the
[1:10:58] tree of life
[1:10:59] would live again amen it would come from
[1:11:02] amen the word of god now
[1:11:04] if you can hear what the spirit is
[1:11:05] saying then then the book is going to be
[1:11:08] opened
[1:11:09] and the thunders are going to sound now
[1:11:11] i know that
[1:11:12] i know you're a very taught church and i
[1:11:13] don't want to get deep in this so i just
[1:11:15] want to maybe just to make a statement
[1:11:17] here
[1:11:17] and then continue but but many people
[1:11:20] have made a lot of things out of these
[1:11:21] thunders
[1:11:22] and and i can't help that i can't help
[1:11:24] what others have done that's not
[1:11:26] that's not within my my my grip whatever
[1:11:29] they did they did
[1:11:30] but i just want to say what the spirit
[1:11:33] says
[1:11:34] and the spirit says that the thunder was
[1:11:37] the voice of god when the seals opened
[1:11:40] and he uses john 12 brother branham uses
[1:11:43] john 12
[1:11:44] and said if you wonder what a thunder
[1:11:46] was remember when jesus said
[1:11:48] glorify me with the glory i had before
[1:11:50] the world began
[1:11:51] and he said and a voice spoke out of
[1:11:53] heaven and said i have glorified thee
[1:11:55] and i will glorify thy name again and
[1:11:57] when he said that the bible said
[1:11:59] that some heard it thunder but an angel
[1:12:03] had spoke
[1:12:04] and brother brahm said see it was a
[1:12:06] voice of god
[1:12:08] but to others of course it's just a
[1:12:09] noise it's just a thunder
[1:12:12] amen but to him that can hear it it's
[1:12:15] the voice of god
[1:12:16] glorifying the church amen to think of
[1:12:20] this brother adam says
[1:12:21] the thunder is the voice of god when the
[1:12:23] seal was open
[1:12:24] now i know that it's very important
[1:12:27] because brother brown talks a lot about
[1:12:28] the thunders
[1:12:29] and he says to us that it would be the
[1:12:31] thunders that would bring
[1:12:32] us faith for rapturing grace
[1:12:36] pretty important then isn't it he also
[1:12:38] says to us
[1:12:39] that there had been no manifestation to
[1:12:41] wake up a bride
[1:12:43] he meant all the way up until the third
[1:12:45] seal he's still saying this
[1:12:47] but in the third seal brother adam says
[1:12:50] to us
[1:12:50] it would take those seven unknown
[1:12:52] thunders to wake up that bride
[1:12:54] so we can make a real quick assumption
[1:12:56] here or togetherness with
[1:12:58] to save a lot of reading the bride's
[1:13:00] revival and the awakening of the bride
[1:13:03] is the same thing and the bride's
[1:13:05] revival or the awakening of the bride
[1:13:07] will not be brought on by a lot of
[1:13:10] persecution
[1:13:11] it was brought on by the opening of the
[1:13:14] seven thunders which would be the voice
[1:13:16] of god to the bride church
[1:13:18] do you see what she needed was a voice
[1:13:21] to wake up that bride
[1:13:22] so then we have groups saying we need
[1:13:24] those thunders to open we need those
[1:13:26] thunders to come
[1:13:27] amen and they're looking for those
[1:13:28] things well in 1964
[1:13:30] brother branham comes around and he says
[1:13:32] in recognizing your day in this message
[1:13:35] he said they're fasting and praying for
[1:13:37] an awakening to come
[1:13:38] he said but what's wrong with them he
[1:13:40] said they feel the pull of the hour
[1:13:42] being a christian
[1:13:43] he said but they have missed the
[1:13:46] awakening
[1:13:47] of the bride so somewhere between the
[1:13:49] third seal
[1:13:50] in 1964 he's telling us the thunders had
[1:13:54] already
[1:13:54] sounded which was the voice of god to
[1:13:57] the pride
[1:13:58] that would awaken her from dead dark
[1:14:01] denominational ideas
[1:14:03] and the traditions of mankind that had
[1:14:06] bound the church
[1:14:07] for 2 000 years in the ideas of man
[1:14:11] but listen this morning the word of god
[1:14:13] has come
[1:14:14] to loose the church of god to loose it
[1:14:17] from every tradition
[1:14:18] to knock away oh brother tim you don't
[1:14:21] know what you're saying to me this
[1:14:22] morning
[1:14:23] amen to knock away every claim he was
[1:14:26] talking to me on the way to church and
[1:14:27] i'm sitting over quiet as a mouse
[1:14:28] i bet he was wondering what i was
[1:14:30] thinking i was thinking if he keeps it
[1:14:31] up he's going to preach everything i got
[1:14:32] in my notes
[1:14:37] hey man he probably already has a couple
[1:14:39] times but i'm going to preach it anyhow
[1:14:42] amen but there's no manifestation to
[1:14:43] stir it up or wake it up
[1:14:45] so the awakening of the bride now notice
[1:14:47] this because
[1:14:48] this happens at the same time as the
[1:14:51] seventh angel
[1:14:53] that's why revelation 3 says behold i
[1:14:56] stand at the door and knock
[1:14:58] okay so a lot of people think about this
[1:15:00] knock they think i knock at the door
[1:15:02] well then we find out the door is the
[1:15:05] heart
[1:15:06] and then we find out the knock is not
[1:15:09] this
[1:15:10] it's a voice of god so the voice of god
[1:15:14] is knocking at the heart of the bride
[1:15:17] and what's he wanting to do
[1:15:19] he's wanting to come into the church
[1:15:22] to reveal the things that have
[1:15:25] concerning the bride in this last day
[1:15:28] there is redemptive rights being
[1:15:31] released
[1:15:31] under the preaching the word in this age
[1:15:33] there are things you've never thought
[1:15:35] about
[1:15:36] that you can do and you can say and you
[1:15:38] can have
[1:15:39] until you come to the church of the
[1:15:41] living god and you started hearing them
[1:15:42] preach about
[1:15:43] liam's being restored and the power of
[1:15:45] the spoken word and
[1:15:47] how the spirit of god would cast out
[1:15:49] devils and heal the sick and
[1:15:50] raise the dead who would have ever
[1:15:52] thought about these things
[1:15:54] but all of a sudden they're not just
[1:15:55] things out here
[1:15:57] their things begin to be revealed
[1:16:00] right in the individual now
[1:16:04] you think of this because he said he
[1:16:06] would like to come in to you
[1:16:09] and the bible said sup with him and he
[1:16:11] with me now brother adam interprets that
[1:16:13] sub as to reveal
[1:16:15] hidden things to you now think about
[1:16:18] this to reveal
[1:16:20] hidden things to you now just real
[1:16:22] simply those seven thunders
[1:16:24] were not something that wasn't written
[1:16:26] in the bible
[1:16:27] there's something that was written but
[1:16:29] something hidden
[1:16:31] it wasn't something that paul hadn't put
[1:16:33] in there
[1:16:34] listen brother brown didn't take us to
[1:16:36] another gospel
[1:16:38] but he brought us to the same gospel
[1:16:40] that paul was preaching
[1:16:41] this is an original bright church it's
[1:16:44] an original message
[1:16:46] now if brother branham would have said
[1:16:48] something that hadn't already been
[1:16:50] written
[1:16:51] then paul said we had to accurse him but
[1:16:54] look what he said he was telling us
[1:16:56] that it was things written but things
[1:16:58] that were hidden
[1:16:59] in there and wouldn't be made known
[1:17:02] until the last days now when he begins
[1:17:05] to come in there
[1:17:06] and he starts revealing now a spiritual
[1:17:08] food and due season
[1:17:09] if you like to read it he says something
[1:17:11] that's been hid in the book whosoever
[1:17:12] take this word or add one word
[1:17:14] so it's a mystery that's been in the
[1:17:16] book in those seven church ages
[1:17:18] now notice because when you start
[1:17:21] having supper with this one
[1:17:24] with this one that comes in the heart
[1:17:26] that knocks at your heart the voice of
[1:17:28] god that's coming in
[1:17:30] you're starting to have supper with the
[1:17:32] voice of god now
[1:17:33] it's an evening time communion
[1:17:36] the lord's supper now we have a natural
[1:17:39] communion
[1:17:40] but there is a spiritual communion a
[1:17:42] fellowship
[1:17:43] and it's it's actually a beautiful type
[1:17:46] of when melchizedek came to abraham in
[1:17:48] genesis 14
[1:17:50] and he offered unto abraham both the
[1:17:53] wine and the bread
[1:17:54] serving him communion after a great
[1:17:57] battle and
[1:17:58] gave unto him communion typing the
[1:18:00] communion of the church and the marriage
[1:18:02] supper
[1:18:03] but there's a bit of a spiritual thought
[1:18:05] laying there
[1:18:06] even that melchizedek didn't have a lamb
[1:18:09] right there
[1:18:10] melchizedek didn't have a lamb in other
[1:18:11] words he wasn't a priest in that nature
[1:18:14] right then
[1:18:15] he was a priest of the host most high
[1:18:16] god but he wasn't a priest with a lamb
[1:18:19] he was a priest in restoration
[1:18:21] and in communion amen but in the middle
[1:18:23] of the bible
[1:18:24] melchizedek comes and gets his lamb and
[1:18:28] says this
[1:18:28] is the lamb of god and jesus christ the
[1:18:32] son of god
[1:18:32] the lamb of god amen was claimed
[1:18:36] to be god's only begotten son and the
[1:18:39] very lamb
[1:18:40] of our redemption and the blood of our
[1:18:42] atonement
[1:18:43] now i want to maybe say something to you
[1:18:46] in saying this
[1:18:47] that it's a very secret food to
[1:18:49] understand that jesus christ was
[1:18:51] melchizedek in the flesh he wasn't just
[1:18:55] a jew
[1:18:55] or a gentile it was god amen who
[1:18:58] manifested himself in the flesh and
[1:19:01] claimed
[1:19:02] the flesh of jesus christ as brother
[1:19:05] branham will say it in
[1:19:06] in future home he will say that he
[1:19:09] redeemed
[1:19:10] that part of the earth so he could from
[1:19:13] that
[1:19:13] redeem the rest of the earth in other
[1:19:16] words god claimed
[1:19:18] 16 elements to make it a redemptive work
[1:19:21] for the bride of christ now now you're
[1:19:23] all you're all
[1:19:24] well studied enough to know amen the
[1:19:27] scripture tells us very clearly
[1:19:29] amen that that secret food of
[1:19:31] melchizedek that was going to be coming
[1:19:33] to the church
[1:19:35] going to be revealed in the church then
[1:19:37] the voice of christ
[1:19:39] would be speaking to her revealing to
[1:19:41] her her ordination
[1:19:43] where she come from where she's going
[1:19:45] what she's doing
[1:19:46] the secrets of your eternal life would
[1:19:49] be coming into the church now that
[1:19:50] secret food
[1:19:51] becomes as a communion and it begins to
[1:19:54] move into the flesh
[1:19:55] as you eat it as you let the secrets of
[1:19:59] god
[1:20:00] be revealed in your heart your flesh
[1:20:03] begins to take on its form
[1:20:06] as you receive the word
[1:20:10] you become the word as you take in the
[1:20:13] word
[1:20:14] can i say it like this it starts
[1:20:16] claiming you
[1:20:18] it maybe started claiming a little part
[1:20:21] of your life
[1:20:22] and then it claimed another little part
[1:20:25] but it starts claiming that
[1:20:28] until the spirit of god will cap that
[1:20:31] off
[1:20:32] and call you a child of god now think of
[1:20:35] this because that claim
[1:20:37] amen is the very thing that was done to
[1:20:39] the body of jesus christ
[1:20:41] when he was laying in the tomb and he
[1:20:42] was dead have you ever asked yourself
[1:20:45] how god proved that was his body
[1:20:47] brother brahm said the cross didn't do
[1:20:49] it many good men had died
[1:20:51] his justice birth didn't do it he said
[1:20:53] but when he resurrected from the dead
[1:20:55] it was proof of whose body that was
[1:20:59] amen you see then god's spirit claimed
[1:21:02] the body of jesus to resurrect it and
[1:21:06] prove whose body
[1:21:07] it was now he's not here claiming
[1:21:10] the body of jesus christ in the physical
[1:21:13] he's here claiming the bride body
[1:21:16] of jesus christ and the very spirit
[1:21:19] that raised up jesus from the dead has
[1:21:22] come back upon the church
[1:21:25] to say that you are not the body of
[1:21:27] denomination
[1:21:28] you are not the body of the world you
[1:21:30] are the body of jesus christ
[1:21:34] oh my then the voice of god begins to
[1:21:37] sound upon that church
[1:21:38] and begins to claim it amen revelation 5
[1:21:41] the book is open
[1:21:42] revelations 10 uh closed revelations 10
[1:21:46] it's open
[1:21:47] and when he opens it he starts calling
[1:21:49] he starts calling for his bride
[1:21:52] to come out of tradition
[1:21:55] to come out of hybridization if you're a
[1:21:58] bible study
[1:21:59] you know revelation chapter 14 speaks of
[1:22:02] three angels
[1:22:03] and the third angel comes flying saying
[1:22:06] to the church
[1:22:07] you cannot worship god in the image of
[1:22:09] the beast at the same time
[1:22:10] amen now how many how many knows that
[1:22:13] that was the message of william branham
[1:22:15] you say third angel sure start with
[1:22:17] martin luther
[1:22:18] john wesley william branham that third
[1:22:21] angel and what did he do he called
[1:22:23] the bride out of denomination
[1:22:26] watch this that's the same angel in
[1:22:29] revelations 18
[1:22:31] where the bible says that an angel comes
[1:22:33] down from heaven
[1:22:34] and lights the earth with his glory and
[1:22:37] a voice in the fourth verse sounds out
[1:22:39] and says come out of her my people and
[1:22:43] be not partakers of her
[1:22:44] see that voice is calling the bride out
[1:22:47] of denomination
[1:22:48] and claiming that bride for the work of
[1:22:51] the
[1:22:52] spirit in the last day let me ask you
[1:22:54] something why hadn't the spirit been
[1:22:55] working the whole time
[1:22:56] it was poured out two thousand years ago
[1:22:59] but it's been barred out
[1:23:01] it's been pushed out it's been created
[1:23:03] out
[1:23:04] doctrines have pushed christ on the
[1:23:06] outside of the church
[1:23:07] where the prophet of god has called the
[1:23:10] pride
[1:23:10] to come out of the church and come back
[1:23:13] into the manifestation
[1:23:15] of the spirit of god to loose them
[1:23:18] from every thing the enemy had pulled
[1:23:21] them into
[1:23:22] now in revelations 18 this is an angel
[1:23:24] of light calling the church
[1:23:26] calling them to come out now you might
[1:23:28] think it's odd that i would call this
[1:23:30] the seventh angel
[1:23:31] because the bible says to us that it
[1:23:33] sounded from heaven a voice sounded from
[1:23:35] heaven
[1:23:36] but brother adam said it's simple he
[1:23:38] said the angel on earth
[1:23:41] he said when he sounded his message it
[1:23:43] was so
[1:23:44] recognized in heaven until they echoed
[1:23:47] it
[1:23:47] back from heaven what he was saying on
[1:23:50] the earth
[1:23:51] this message is recognized in heaven
[1:23:55] and on earth as the voice of god
[1:23:58] this voice is a voice of illumination
[1:24:02] and enlightenment god didn't come to
[1:24:04] leave you in darkness
[1:24:06] he come to enlighten you to come to
[1:24:08] illuminate you now
[1:24:10] now i i want you to stay with me a
[1:24:12] moment that voice is coming into your
[1:24:14] heart to reveal to you
[1:24:16] the voice is coming into your heart to
[1:24:18] illuminate you
[1:24:19] to make you full of light now notice
[1:24:23] because in ephesians 1 this is paul's
[1:24:25] own prayer
[1:24:26] he says i pray that the spirit of wisdom
[1:24:28] and revelation
[1:24:29] and the knowledge of him the eyes of
[1:24:31] your understanding
[1:24:33] being enlightened that you may know the
[1:24:35] hope of the calling the riches of the
[1:24:37] glory
[1:24:37] and the inheritance in saints and to
[1:24:40] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[1:24:42] power to us who believed
[1:24:43] according to the work of his mighty
[1:24:45] power which he wrought in christ when he
[1:24:47] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:24:49] his right hand in heavenly places far
[1:24:51] above principality and power and might
[1:24:54] and dominion
[1:24:55] and every name that is thing not only in
[1:24:56] the world but also which is to come
[1:24:59] and he had put all things under his feet
[1:25:02] and gave him to be the head
[1:25:04] over all things to the church now watch
[1:25:07] paul
[1:25:07] tie together the spirit of wisdom and
[1:25:10] revelation with the resurrection
[1:25:12] power this was not a man who believed in
[1:25:15] intellectuals
[1:25:16] that would just tell you something about
[1:25:18] the scripture
[1:25:19] but he connected it with the
[1:25:20] resurrection power
[1:25:22] look what he does if you if you read
[1:25:24] ephesians 1
[1:25:25] you're basically reading revelations 3
[1:25:28] when the scripture says that you should
[1:25:31] share the throne
[1:25:32] of christ and hear paul is saying when
[1:25:35] your eyes are opened
[1:25:37] you will see that you're connected to
[1:25:39] christ
[1:25:40] who sets above everything who everything
[1:25:43] is
[1:25:43] is beneath him and under his feet and
[1:25:45] he's saying over in revelations 3
[1:25:48] when christ comes into your heart and he
[1:25:50] illuminates your life
[1:25:51] then you're going to see that you're not
[1:25:53] just another person
[1:25:55] you're going to see that you're not just
[1:25:57] subject to the devil
[1:25:58] you're going to start seeing that you
[1:26:00] were a son or daughter of god to begin
[1:26:02] with
[1:26:03] and that satan has tried his best to put
[1:26:06] some kind of a claim upon your life but
[1:26:09] he has no rights you know
[1:26:10] i was just thinking here the other day i
[1:26:12] was thinking about how
[1:26:13] that the devil tried to actually give
[1:26:17] he tried to actually give the earth to
[1:26:19] jesus and
[1:26:20] instead of him dying for it and you know
[1:26:22] how brother ram teaches us
[1:26:24] that that jesus wouldn't accept that he
[1:26:27] wouldn't let that happen
[1:26:29] and and and he actually died
[1:26:32] and gave his blood
[1:26:35] so that he wouldn't have to accept it as
[1:26:37] a gift from the devil
[1:26:39] because he didn't want your sin
[1:26:41] returning
[1:26:43] at the time he was planning to claim his
[1:26:46] own throne
[1:26:46] can you imagine jesus showing up to
[1:26:49] claim the bride body
[1:26:51] and satan run around saying amen you
[1:26:53] can't you can't give him that anointing
[1:26:56] you can't place your spirit in his life
[1:26:58] because of this back here and
[1:27:00] because of this over here and this over
[1:27:02] here jesus
[1:27:03] knew who he was picking to begin with
[1:27:06] amen jesus knew how rotten of a rascal
[1:27:09] you was going to be to begin with
[1:27:11] jesus don't know the you the world knows
[1:27:14] he knows the real you
[1:27:16] amen he knows everything about you he
[1:27:19] knows everything
[1:27:20] you thought and where you come from he
[1:27:23] did not die to redeem them that are
[1:27:26] perfect
[1:27:26] he redeemed them that were lost to make
[1:27:29] them perfect
[1:27:30] by the blood of jesus christ now
[1:27:34] i say that to you this morning that i
[1:27:36] can also say that by the power of the
[1:27:38] blood
[1:27:38] then satan does not have one legal right
[1:27:41] with you this morning
[1:27:44] he's only doing it because our unbelief
[1:27:46] permits him to do it
[1:27:49] now satan actually has no claim on you
[1:27:52] at all
[1:27:53] now i know i'm making some testimonies
[1:27:55] this morning about you as the bride of
[1:27:57] christ
[1:27:58] and they're completely not true without
[1:28:00] the blood
[1:28:02] everything that i'm saying about you is
[1:28:04] not true
[1:28:05] without the blood but even in the old
[1:28:08] testament
[1:28:09] when moses put the word in the in the
[1:28:12] third realm and he placed the word in
[1:28:15] the holies of holies
[1:28:16] he put the blood on that word he put the
[1:28:19] blood on that ark of the covenant
[1:28:21] because it was the testimony of god and
[1:28:24] now the church god is saying things
[1:28:27] about you that are not even true without
[1:28:31] the blood
[1:28:31] but because of the blood i can stand
[1:28:35] here this morning
[1:28:36] and say everything the devil says about
[1:28:38] you
[1:28:39] is a lie and everything god says
[1:28:42] is the truth amen it's a different point
[1:28:45] of view
[1:28:46] it's a different way of looking at the
[1:28:48] people i'm not
[1:28:49] looking at you through my ability i'm
[1:28:52] looking at you through the blood
[1:28:56] i got to preach it on the cross one time
[1:28:58] i got to thinking about the blood and i
[1:29:00] i sometimes i used to run not much
[1:29:02] anymore but
[1:29:03] i used to run get sweat in my eyes and
[1:29:05] you couldn't hardly see nothing that
[1:29:06] salt running in your eyes
[1:29:08] and i got to thinking about that i got
[1:29:10] to think about jesus being on the cross
[1:29:12] and when he was dying that that blood
[1:29:14] started dripping into those eyes
[1:29:16] and i got to thinking when he was
[1:29:18] looking at the at the crowd
[1:29:20] he was not looking at them with clear
[1:29:22] eyes
[1:29:23] he was looking at them through the blood
[1:29:26] and the
[1:29:26] sins of the people through the blood of
[1:29:29] jesus christ
[1:29:30] he said turned out to be pure as
[1:29:34] lily or pure as white as snow though thy
[1:29:36] sins be as crimson they shall be white
[1:29:38] as snow the book of isaiah
[1:29:39] do you see then it's according how
[1:29:41] you're looking at things
[1:29:43] now christ is saying that satan has no
[1:29:46] legal rights do you know do you know
[1:29:49] that you're actually
[1:29:50] one of the three thrones of almighty god
[1:29:54] first thrown in heaven second throne in
[1:29:55] christ the third throne
[1:29:58] is actually in the bride he becomes the
[1:30:02] lord
[1:30:03] he becomes the god the king
[1:30:06] of our lives now i i understand that
[1:30:10] satan
[1:30:11] would like to return to you and say to
[1:30:13] you oh my that
[1:30:14] you know this is here and that's there
[1:30:16] and this is this is this is a part of
[1:30:18] your life and
[1:30:19] and but you know i'm kind of one of
[1:30:22] those guys that
[1:30:23] i guess maybe i probably should be quiet
[1:30:25] sometimes when i don't but
[1:30:26] i just like kind of speak back sometimes
[1:30:30] and you know what i mean if you hear
[1:30:32] somebody say something really good and
[1:30:33] you're not that sharp you know and
[1:30:34] you're around somebody later and they
[1:30:36] say something you
[1:30:37] you'll borrow a little what somebody
[1:30:38] else said you know and whenever i start
[1:30:41] arguing with the devil i just start
[1:30:42] borrowing things i heard brother braham
[1:30:44] saying
[1:30:45] real real good things brother graham
[1:30:46] said i just borrow and begin to say them
[1:30:48] back and you know
[1:30:49] sometimes you've heard this when the
[1:30:51] devil tells you about your past tell him
[1:30:52] about his future
[1:30:53] well it takes a new light when you start
[1:30:55] hearing what brother bram said about the
[1:30:56] devil's future
[1:30:58] some time ago i know brother timothy
[1:30:59] probably told you but i was actually
[1:31:01] studying
[1:31:02] and come across the quote and i was
[1:31:03] looking into the annihilation of our
[1:31:06] accuser
[1:31:06] and the and what the power of the blood
[1:31:08] actually does in the future of our lives
[1:31:11] and how far does it really go
[1:31:12] in annihilation and i got to look at
[1:31:15] this and it was odd because brother
[1:31:16] brown begins to preach
[1:31:17] and he pulls up a scripture and he says
[1:31:20] the soul that sinners shall die
[1:31:22] and immediately he takes it over to the
[1:31:24] devil and he actually says
[1:31:26] of our enemy the devil he says that uh
[1:31:29] he actually
[1:31:30] says amen that this devil has a future
[1:31:32] and i want to read this about in the
[1:31:34] fourth seal here
[1:31:36] i want to read this from the fourth seal
[1:31:38] first and brother man will say this
[1:31:39] he'll say now
[1:31:41] uh they were gods and if you become born
[1:31:44] in the family name
[1:31:45] you're a son of god or a part of your
[1:31:47] father then when sin come in we found
[1:31:49] that the man crossed the chasm and the
[1:31:51] blood of bulls and goats covered
[1:31:53] but did not remit but until the bleeds
[1:31:56] came
[1:31:56] and took that stain of sin and broke it
[1:32:00] completely to pieces
[1:32:02] and send it back upon the original
[1:32:03] perverted that was satan
[1:32:05] when it got back to satan he
[1:32:08] waits his time of eternal annihilation
[1:32:13] now that shows what we believe we
[1:32:16] believe will
[1:32:17] that shows what we believe we believe
[1:32:19] that he will absolutely be
[1:32:20] done completely away he will be
[1:32:23] annihilated
[1:32:25] amen and i read that and then listen to
[1:32:28] what brother branham says he says see
[1:32:29] i believe sin will be so broke up that
[1:32:32] when it's confessed upon the basis of
[1:32:34] the blood of christ it's like drawing a
[1:32:35] drop of black ink into a bunch of clorox
[1:32:38] it breaks its chemicals and sends it
[1:32:40] back to where it come from
[1:32:42] and that's the way the blood of jesus
[1:32:43] christ does it sets a man across the
[1:32:46] chasm
[1:32:46] and then he says see then he becomes and
[1:32:49] the creative power of god that's in him
[1:32:52] whenever he whenever god can command it
[1:32:54] to be done
[1:32:55] it'll be done and we get back now he's
[1:32:58] trying to tell us that under the power
[1:33:00] of the blood
[1:33:01] that the sin is completely done away
[1:33:03] with
[1:33:04] but he's going to transfer that sin
[1:33:07] back to the one that was the originator
[1:33:10] of the sin
[1:33:11] god has the power to put the sin back on
[1:33:14] the one that caused it
[1:33:15] i think it's amazing that being calvary
[1:33:17] brother brahm says i believe that there
[1:33:19] is a complete annihilation of that soul
[1:33:21] that sins for the bible
[1:33:22] said the soul that sinneth it shall
[1:33:23] surely die
[1:33:25] not the man the soul sin and soul satan
[1:33:28] must
[1:33:29] surely die to be completely destroyed
[1:33:32] how i disagree with the universe that
[1:33:33] say satan will be saved he sinned
[1:33:36] he is the originator of sin and his soul
[1:33:38] sinned
[1:33:39] and he was a spirit that spirit will be
[1:33:42] totally
[1:33:43] annihilated until nothing will be left
[1:33:46] of it
[1:33:47] now i want you to think about this a
[1:33:48] minute there is a time
[1:33:50] when satan there will be nothing left of
[1:33:53] it at all
[1:33:55] now think about this because everything
[1:33:58] that he's saying to you
[1:33:59] he's trying to bring it is as an
[1:34:02] original truth
[1:34:03] but nothing satan has ever said about
[1:34:06] you
[1:34:07] is an original truth he come
[1:34:10] after amen and started perverting the
[1:34:13] things that god did originally
[1:34:15] but someday god will totally take away
[1:34:18] every bit of the hybrid of satan and
[1:34:21] restore
[1:34:22] the world and the people back unto the
[1:34:25] original word
[1:34:26] let me tell you that devil is
[1:34:28] annihilated i told brother timothy i
[1:34:30] said i
[1:34:30] i read this in my study i was studying
[1:34:33] it and what i did there was a spirit run
[1:34:34] right across the room
[1:34:36] and i just started laughing i said
[1:34:37] that's right devil you can run but you
[1:34:39] can't hide
[1:34:40] amen you can you can come against this
[1:34:42] bride and you can talk about her and you
[1:34:44] can ridicule her and you can honor
[1:34:46] and you can try your best amen but it's
[1:34:49] never going to change the fact the
[1:34:50] devil's a liar
[1:34:52] it's not going to change the fact amen
[1:34:54] that he's always lying
[1:34:55] and that god is going to completely
[1:34:58] annihilate him one day
[1:35:00] until nothing is left of him at all i
[1:35:03] want you to know this morning there is a
[1:35:04] day that devils die
[1:35:06] amen amen the prophet of god said satan
[1:35:09] is is
[1:35:10] powerless for a thousand year millennial
[1:35:12] is that right he said because he don't
[1:35:14] have anything to work through
[1:35:15] he said but at the end of that
[1:35:17] millennium he'll be raised up
[1:35:18] he said and there'll be one last
[1:35:19] campaign i said oh my
[1:35:21] i'd like to be in that camp meeting you
[1:35:23] talk about a camp meeting
[1:35:25] of all camp meetings amen the devil's
[1:35:27] going to resurrect everything he has
[1:35:30] and come against the church of the
[1:35:31] living god only to die
[1:35:33] do you see god is annihilating that
[1:35:36] devil
[1:35:36] once and for all but he's already
[1:35:39] annihilating him
[1:35:41] in your life
[1:35:43] [Applause]
[1:35:45] oh i thank god this morning
[1:35:48] that the spirit of god is taking
[1:35:50] possession of a church
[1:35:52] annihilating every sin calling this
[1:35:55] bride
[1:35:56] the anointed bride of jesus christ
[1:35:59] and the prophet of god will say this
[1:36:01] there's got to come a time forth when he
[1:36:03] would express himself in the fullness
[1:36:05] of the godhead deity through the church
[1:36:07] had the preeminence in his church
[1:36:09] the anointed man now the anointed people
[1:36:12] oh my to bring back the anointed bride
[1:36:14] and bridegroom
[1:36:15] anointed by accepting what eve turned
[1:36:18] down
[1:36:19] my the anointing of god coming upon the
[1:36:22] church
[1:36:23] in the messiah brother man will say when
[1:36:25] he comes upon the church in the last
[1:36:26] days what will it be
[1:36:27] a pulled out group a group of people
[1:36:30] anointed with the spirit of god
[1:36:31] they will be messiahs they'll be
[1:36:34] anointed ones he anointed once and if
[1:36:37] the spirit is in them
[1:36:39] they'll do the things that he did isn't
[1:36:41] that right
[1:36:42] now i think it's important you catch
[1:36:44] something here she's already anointed
[1:36:48] this bride's not going to be she's
[1:36:50] already anointed
[1:36:52] she is actually already anointed his
[1:36:54] pride is the anointed one
[1:36:56] for the last days and it's already
[1:36:59] raised with him and resurrection
[1:37:01] these two are one my when i think about
[1:37:03] it this morning we look at you
[1:37:05] and i know that you can see all the
[1:37:07] problems of one another
[1:37:08] and and i appreciate that that there's
[1:37:11] good vision but let me say this to you
[1:37:13] you don't want to start a carnal view of
[1:37:15] your church or your pastor or your life
[1:37:17] or anything else
[1:37:18] because carnality will destroy you it's
[1:37:20] an enemy done to god
[1:37:22] amen and i i will say this though amen
[1:37:25] that if you
[1:37:26] if you can if you can get the right kind
[1:37:28] of view of things
[1:37:30] it changes everything uh
[1:37:33] let me let me just put it to you like
[1:37:35] this uh there there's mirrors and
[1:37:37] of course brother madam tells us that a
[1:37:39] prophet is a mirror the word of god is a
[1:37:41] mirror
[1:37:42] uh it matters how you look into the
[1:37:44] mirror according to what you walk away
[1:37:46] with
[1:37:47] now in your in your human i thought it
[1:37:49] was pretty funny i was thinking about
[1:37:50] this quote
[1:37:51] specifically and i was thinking about
[1:37:54] you know sometimes
[1:37:55] i never hardly wake up in the morning
[1:37:57] walk up to the mirror and say well
[1:37:58] there's a messiah standing there
[1:38:01] you know you don't usually just run over
[1:38:04] and say hey
[1:38:05] sister karen come look right here in the
[1:38:06] mirror there's a messiah standing here
[1:38:09] which one of y'all done that this
[1:38:11] morning see because that mirror doesn't
[1:38:14] reflect
[1:38:16] anything but you're human and in the
[1:38:18] body you're looking at look at all the
[1:38:20] things that's reflected back at you
[1:38:23] those days in the world those days and
[1:38:25] those lives it's all reflected back in
[1:38:27] that mirror
[1:38:28] because it's being held in that flesh
[1:38:30] but think about this
[1:38:31] what if there was a different kind of
[1:38:33] mirror what if there was a different
[1:38:36] view that you could look in
[1:38:37] and not see the human but you could see
[1:38:39] the reality
[1:38:40] of what god made you and i thought about
[1:38:43] this i thought about
[1:38:44] amen isn't it something that you can see
[1:38:45] something in the word of god
[1:38:47] and you can see where a prophet can say
[1:38:49] that they can do all things
[1:38:50] that there's nothing impossible she is
[1:38:52] the anointed pride
[1:38:54] and you know what you'll do you'll
[1:38:55] actually go and preach it
[1:38:57] or you'll call somebody to come and read
[1:38:59] it and you'll say look right here and
[1:39:00] see what he said about me
[1:39:02] because you're looking at different view
[1:39:05] at the same person
[1:39:07] but a different kind of mirror and i'll
[1:39:09] tell you this morning
[1:39:10] the prophet of god said you give me a
[1:39:12] church that's so anointed with god
[1:39:15] until their every action and every move
[1:39:17] is thus saith the lord
[1:39:19] in the shekinah glory i will show you a
[1:39:22] messiah
[1:39:23] you show me a church i'll show you a
[1:39:26] messiah
[1:39:27] look at the way the prophet could change
[1:39:30] you're seeing a church
[1:39:31] he's seen a messiah he wasn't seeing
[1:39:34] just the human
[1:39:36] he was seeing what god made the church
[1:39:38] i'll tell you this morning
[1:39:40] that there is a there is a life that is
[1:39:43] behind the veil that a prophet could
[1:39:45] view
[1:39:46] and it would speak of it from the word
[1:39:48] now now this morning you all know the
[1:39:50] stories of balak and balaam and
[1:39:52] i don't have time to get into all that
[1:39:53] but i do know this i do know that balak
[1:39:56] tried to hire balaam to keep the church
[1:39:58] of god out of the promises
[1:40:00] and he actually tried to hire him to
[1:40:03] curse the children of god
[1:40:04] well he should have he should have read
[1:40:06] the covenant to abraham because
[1:40:08] whoever curses is cursed and whoever
[1:40:10] blesses is blessed
[1:40:12] but see you can start looking at a
[1:40:14] blessed person from a certain angle
[1:40:16] and believe you can curse them and balak
[1:40:20] believed
[1:40:21] that he could get balaam looking at a
[1:40:23] certain view
[1:40:24] of that bunch of holy rollers down there
[1:40:26] that he could actually begin to curse
[1:40:28] them
[1:40:29] but balak amen didn't realize that god
[1:40:32] would never curse israel
[1:40:34] because he was looking at them from a
[1:40:36] different view
[1:40:38] now remember when balaam went in and
[1:40:40] made offers and sacrifices he come back
[1:40:42] and he said amen that god wouldn't allow
[1:40:44] him to curse those people
[1:40:46] he wouldn't allow him to curse them
[1:40:48] because he's already blessed them
[1:40:50] so it doesn't matter how you view it
[1:40:52] matters how god views
[1:40:56] now when god began to view brother brahm
[1:40:58] said this
[1:41:00] he says that balaam and balak
[1:41:03] couldn't see the water from the rock
[1:41:07] see they couldn't see the smitten rock
[1:41:10] they could see the problem
[1:41:12] but they couldn't see the atonement god
[1:41:15] smote that rock
[1:41:17] because of the of the people and
[1:41:20] and the condition they were in god saw
[1:41:23] the condition
[1:41:24] but he smoked the rock so that god could
[1:41:27] give them something
[1:41:28] in their condition god saw the condition
[1:41:31] but he gave an answer to it
[1:41:33] you see what he done he meant the
[1:41:35] condition they were speaking against the
[1:41:36] prophet
[1:41:37] and god saw the condition but he gave a
[1:41:40] brazen serpent
[1:41:41] to take away what was caused by their
[1:41:44] own condition
[1:41:46] now balaam wasn't able to see that
[1:41:47] bailey wasn't able to see it but iran
[1:41:49] said he wasn't able to see the pillar of
[1:41:50] fire
[1:41:51] and to think this morning where is that
[1:41:52] pillar of fire brother graham said it
[1:41:54] was right behind the skins of the bride
[1:41:56] of christ
[1:41:57] where is that pillar of fire this
[1:41:59] morning it's actually behind the skin
[1:42:02] of the bride of jesus christ now this
[1:42:05] morning
[1:42:06] i realized that this message claims this
[1:42:09] message
[1:42:10] it influences this message identifies
[1:42:13] the message of the hour does all of
[1:42:15] these things under the bride of christ
[1:42:17] and it claims a part of your life for
[1:42:19] something i i want to share a little
[1:42:21] testimony happened to me back up in july
[1:42:23] i was up at brother
[1:42:24] uh i was up but brother matt morris's
[1:42:26] speaking there during that fourth of
[1:42:27] july time
[1:42:28] and we went over to a little picnic and
[1:42:30] uh
[1:42:31] and there was a lady there who was an
[1:42:33] apostolic lady and
[1:42:34] she just started coming to church for
[1:42:36] the match there and i started talking to
[1:42:38] her
[1:42:38] and and when i started talking i thought
[1:42:41] she would just have stalin you didn't
[1:42:42] know
[1:42:42] about the message or anything well i
[1:42:43] asked her i said well where are you from
[1:42:45] she said well i'm from carlsbad new
[1:42:47] mexico
[1:42:48] well she was about 75 years old or so
[1:42:50] and her husband sitting there
[1:42:51] i said originally carlsbad new mexico
[1:42:53] well i said to brother matt sitting
[1:42:54] there i said well hey
[1:42:55] that's well brother branham actually
[1:42:57] preached a message turned on the light
[1:42:59] from carlsbad and held meetings in
[1:43:00] carlsbad
[1:43:02] and when the lady heard me say brother
[1:43:04] branham she said you talking about
[1:43:05] william branham
[1:43:06] and i said yeah brother branham she said
[1:43:08] well she said i was actually in his
[1:43:10] meetings when i was about five years old
[1:43:13] and i said really you were in brother
[1:43:14] brown's meeting she said yes she said
[1:43:16] i said well you was awful young do you
[1:43:18] actually remember that
[1:43:19] she said oh yeah i remember that i
[1:43:21] remember it very well and i said you
[1:43:22] remember that from the time you
[1:43:24] she said yeah i remember it she said but
[1:43:25] there was one specific thing i remember
[1:43:28] and she said what i remember about it
[1:43:30] was she said that that there was a girl
[1:43:33] and i think she said she was close to 18
[1:43:34] years old i got the
[1:43:36] the testimony recorded but i think she's
[1:43:37] about 18 years old she'd never spoke
[1:43:39] in her life she couldn't speak she
[1:43:41] couldn't hear and they brought her to
[1:43:43] the meeting and said well brother
[1:43:44] branham brought her up before the crowd
[1:43:45] and she said now she's from her hometown
[1:43:47] so they were family friends she knew the
[1:43:48] family
[1:43:49] was friends with her older siblings and
[1:43:52] she said that
[1:43:52] she brother brown brought her up the
[1:43:54] prayer line and said stood her out in
[1:43:56] front of the people
[1:43:57] and and put her in front of him
[1:44:00] and while she was in front of him he
[1:44:02] began to pray over her
[1:44:04] and and and commanded that deaf spirit
[1:44:07] to leave her
[1:44:09] well when the deaf spirit began to leave
[1:44:11] her she said brother brown done the
[1:44:12] oddest thing
[1:44:13] said he took the mic and put the little
[1:44:16] girl in front of him where she couldn't
[1:44:17] see him
[1:44:17] and said he reached the mic around and
[1:44:19] put in front of the little girl
[1:44:21] he said then he whispered in her ear and
[1:44:23] he said i could i could hear it sound
[1:44:25] pretty close she said
[1:44:25] he said say mama
[1:44:29] and she said i never will forget that
[1:44:31] when that little girl how she said the
[1:44:33] word
[1:44:34] she said mama just real just mama she
[1:44:38] said first word she'd ever said in her
[1:44:39] life
[1:44:40] she said i will never forget that
[1:44:42] brother and i thought well isn't that so
[1:44:44] odd
[1:44:45] and and so we went back home started
[1:44:47] studying it well when we did brother
[1:44:49] branham actually does that a lot on tape
[1:44:51] he does it chicago different places
[1:44:53] and in it brother branham says he said i
[1:44:55] didn't find that specific place but i
[1:44:57] found other places
[1:44:58] and he says that what it is he says that
[1:45:01] the hearing and the speaking nerves are
[1:45:03] actually tied together
[1:45:05] and he said that if a person can't hear
[1:45:08] they generally can't speak
[1:45:10] he said now what it is is there's a
[1:45:11] nerve now you all you all heard brother
[1:45:13] graham explain he said if an ear problem
[1:45:15] he said if it was a bone or something he
[1:45:17] said a surgery could fix it
[1:45:19] he said but because there's actually
[1:45:20] nothing wrong with the bone there's
[1:45:22] nothing
[1:45:22] in there wrong he said there's a nerve
[1:45:24] he said which
[1:45:25] a devil will clamp off that nerve of
[1:45:28] hearing
[1:45:30] he said it's just like you put an
[1:45:31] invisible band around your hand
[1:45:33] he said the vessels is there the blood
[1:45:35] is all there he said but when you start
[1:45:37] tightening it up the hand will start
[1:45:39] turning colors and and it'll start dying
[1:45:41] he said there's nothing wrong with the
[1:45:42] hand there's nothing wrong with the
[1:45:43] blood
[1:45:44] it's just there is something cutting off
[1:45:46] the life source he said now
[1:45:47] that invisible band he's describing is
[1:45:50] the spirit
[1:45:51] he said and the spirit was cutting off
[1:45:53] the hearing
[1:45:54] unto that little girl but when he
[1:45:56] rebuked the spirit
[1:45:58] the child could hear and if the child
[1:46:01] could hear
[1:46:01] the child could speak now what did it
[1:46:04] speak
[1:46:05] it spoke the only thing it heard it said
[1:46:07] the word mama but because it had only
[1:46:10] heard the word mama
[1:46:11] it said the word mama later brother
[1:46:13] random actually said because i don't
[1:46:15] have a hearing test
[1:46:16] he said then to prove to the people that
[1:46:19] the spirit has left the child
[1:46:21] he said i will make them say something
[1:46:23] to prove the hearing has returned
[1:46:26] well of course as a preacher when i
[1:46:27] heard that i said now i know what's
[1:46:30] wrong with so many thoughts
[1:46:31] i know why i hear the things that people
[1:46:34] say well there's no move and there's no
[1:46:36] power left in the bride and there's no
[1:46:38] no manifestations and there's no if you
[1:46:40] i don't know if you ever heard anything
[1:46:42] like that
[1:46:42] but you hear that a lot these days and i
[1:46:45] i always wondered what was wrong but now
[1:46:47] i
[1:46:47] understand that people can only say what
[1:46:50] they hear
[1:46:51] amen and spirits will get involved in
[1:46:53] the hearing
[1:46:54] and begin to constrict and and to bow
[1:46:57] down in other words people will listen
[1:46:59] the same tape you're listening to
[1:47:01] but they won't hear that tape they won't
[1:47:04] hear the things the prophet of god said
[1:47:06] he said but if we would open up our
[1:47:08] heart amen and let the spirit come into
[1:47:11] us
[1:47:12] amen that we would be able to say the
[1:47:14] things that a prophet of god would have
[1:47:16] to say
[1:47:17] when i say that today i realize this i
[1:47:19] realize that people speak the way they
[1:47:21] speak because of the things they hear
[1:47:23] and i pray today let us have an ear to
[1:47:25] hear what the spirit of god
[1:47:27] is saying to the church don't let my
[1:47:29] confession
[1:47:30] be different than the confession of a
[1:47:32] prophet of god
[1:47:33] people say brother wayne how can you say
[1:47:35] that the bride of christ
[1:47:37] is omnipotent because william branham's
[1:47:39] head the bride of christ
[1:47:41] amen if she will surrender to god she's
[1:47:43] omnipotent
[1:47:45] how can you say that there's no claim
[1:47:47] against the blood at all
[1:47:49] because brother branham said there's no
[1:47:51] claim against the blood at all
[1:47:53] how can you say and look at the church
[1:47:56] and look at all the problems
[1:47:58] and say to the church that god don't
[1:48:00] have one
[1:48:01] sin against you at all how can you
[1:48:04] say that because i heard the prophet of
[1:48:07] god
[1:48:08] say that how can you stand there and
[1:48:10] begin to tell the church
[1:48:11] that all things are possible to them
[1:48:13] that believe because i heard
[1:48:15] the prophet of god say that if you can
[1:48:18] hear it
[1:48:19] you can say it if you can hear the word
[1:48:23] speak to you you've got a right to say
[1:48:25] whatever that word said
[1:48:27] now i got i got to say this to you today
[1:48:29] because i realized this
[1:48:31] i realize that you you can hear this
[1:48:33] message and then you can get under an
[1:48:34] influence
[1:48:35] and they can begin to tear away from
[1:48:37] that in the things you hear
[1:48:39] and they can begin to try to control the
[1:48:42] way you hear
[1:48:43] amen but i say this because in this very
[1:48:46] testimony
[1:48:46] that little girl who heard and spoke for
[1:48:49] the first time
[1:48:50] in 18 years went home and started
[1:48:52] telling her parents about this miracle
[1:48:55] can you imagine a child speaking for the
[1:48:56] first time and her parents being
[1:48:59] unbelievers
[1:49:00] said you're making it up there ain't no
[1:49:02] such a thing
[1:49:03] you you you could speak the whole time
[1:49:05] you were just faking can you imagine
[1:49:07] that
[1:49:08] can you imagine that kind of miracle
[1:49:10] happening in a life
[1:49:11] and people saying that it's not real
[1:49:13] it's nothing happening
[1:49:14] there's nothing to it can you imagine
[1:49:17] and you know what happened
[1:49:18] that little girl began to listen to her
[1:49:21] own family
[1:49:22] and that woman 75 year old told me
[1:49:24] something i don't understand by the way
[1:49:25] weeks later
[1:49:26] she said that little girl lost her
[1:49:28] ability to speak and hear
[1:49:30] amen she said do you have any idea what
[1:49:32] happened i said i do
[1:49:34] the prophet of god moved that spirit off
[1:49:36] of her but she
[1:49:38] should have held her confession she
[1:49:40] should have confessed and when that
[1:49:41] devil
[1:49:42] come back she should have said devil
[1:49:43] you're a liar amen you you have nothing
[1:49:46] to do with me
[1:49:47] listen god can come in a meeting and he
[1:49:49] can deliver you
[1:49:50] and give you authority he can fill you
[1:49:52] with anointing
[1:49:54] he can charge that demon to get back off
[1:49:56] of you
[1:49:57] but if you leave this building and go
[1:49:59] out here and say nothing happened today
[1:50:01] that was just in motion there was
[1:50:03] nothing coming from god
[1:50:04] do you do you know that spiritual circle
[1:50:07] right back
[1:50:08] and it'll begin to haunt you and if
[1:50:10] you'll lay there and fellowship with it
[1:50:12] it'll stay with you for weeks until it
[1:50:14] takes possession again
[1:50:16] but let me tell you something this
[1:50:17] morning you have a right this morning
[1:50:20] to tell that devil i'm not going back
[1:50:22] there
[1:50:23] amen god did a work in my life
[1:50:31] listen to me this morning don't give up
[1:50:33] your confession
[1:50:35] don't you do it you said preacher what
[1:50:36] are you saying i'm saying
[1:50:38] that joshua went into the land and the
[1:50:40] book of joshua is nothing more
[1:50:43] than a book of confession of what moses
[1:50:45] said they could have
[1:50:46] and when joshua went in that land every
[1:50:49] giant
[1:50:49] rose up and said you can't have that
[1:50:51] land and you can't have that land
[1:50:53] and you can't have that and had they
[1:50:55] listened to those giants
[1:50:57] they would have had to go back across
[1:50:59] the river and join the wilderness
[1:51:01] journey
[1:51:02] but let me tell you this morning there
[1:51:03] was a joshua there
[1:51:05] and he knew where he was he knew what
[1:51:07] belonged to him
[1:51:08] he was already anointed with god and
[1:51:11] when the battle got hot
[1:51:12] amen he knew exactly what he was able to
[1:51:16] do
[1:51:16] let me tell you this morning the church
[1:51:18] of the living god you've got a right to
[1:51:20] stand against every devil
[1:51:21] that says it don't belong to you every
[1:51:23] redemptive right
[1:51:25] that god has given you you have a right
[1:51:27] to this morning
[1:51:28] i don't believe we ought to let anybody
[1:51:30] rob us of anything
[1:51:34] now can i say this paul said this from
[1:51:36] hebrews chapter 3
[1:51:37] and he said let us let us partake of the
[1:51:39] heavenly call and consider the high
[1:51:41] priest of our profession in christ jesus
[1:51:43] let us consider the high priest of our
[1:51:46] profession
[1:51:46] hebrews 4 paul says this he says jesus
[1:51:49] passing
[1:51:50] into the heaven jesus the son of god let
[1:51:53] us
[1:51:53] hold fast our profession let us hold
[1:51:57] fast our profession
[1:51:58] who wrote that paul wrote that can you
[1:52:01] imagine
[1:52:02] paul while you're floating on us on a
[1:52:05] driftwood
[1:52:06] in the middle of a shipwreck amen
[1:52:08] because of your testimony
[1:52:10] got you out there floating on a stick in
[1:52:13] the middle of an ocean
[1:52:14] and looking like you're forsaken and
[1:52:16] looking like you're not going nowhere
[1:52:18] but you're going down and you're going
[1:52:19] to die one of them probably one of them
[1:52:22] one of them
[1:52:22] jailbirds looks over it paul said what
[1:52:24] do you think about it now
[1:52:26] but paul said don't change your
[1:52:27] confession it don't matter what
[1:52:29] condition you're in
[1:52:31] don't you change your confession it
[1:52:33] don't matter what the devil is told at
[1:52:35] you
[1:52:35] don't you change your confession hold
[1:52:38] fast
[1:52:39] to your profession of faith the snake
[1:52:41] reached out and beat him what paul do he
[1:52:43] didn't change
[1:52:44] he didn't say oh no i'm going to fall
[1:52:46] apart now he shook the snake back in the
[1:52:48] fire
[1:52:49] listen this morning you don't have to
[1:52:51] just take what the devil shows you
[1:52:53] or what the devil throws at you amen
[1:52:55] come on paul
[1:52:56] let's go to the chopping block let's put
[1:52:58] your head on the top of
[1:53:00] what do you think about jesus now what
[1:53:02] do you think about this message now
[1:53:04] you know what paul did paul turned
[1:53:06] around and looked right in the face of
[1:53:07] his enemy
[1:53:08] and said oh death where is thy sting and
[1:53:11] grave where is thy victory
[1:53:13] you know why he could do that because
[1:53:15] paul knew exactly where he was standing
[1:53:17] in the word of god
[1:53:19] and this morning i think it's time for
[1:53:21] the bride of christ to
[1:53:23] challenge the devil that is challenging
[1:53:26] her
[1:53:27] [Applause]
[1:53:29] sitting there this morning things
[1:53:30] challenging your life you don't have to
[1:53:32] sit there and accept that
[1:53:34] you don't have to sit there and say well
[1:53:36] i this because this has come up then
[1:53:38] what they said must not be true and i
[1:53:40] must not be who i thought i was and this
[1:53:42] you don't have to accept that you've got
[1:53:43] a confession from the word of god
[1:53:45] you've got something that god has given
[1:53:47] you i know we're we're in the middle of
[1:53:49] covet
[1:53:50] i realize that people teach everything
[1:53:51] and people are sick
[1:53:53] and devils are saying everything about
[1:53:54] the people but let me tell you this
[1:53:56] the confession of our faith don't change
[1:53:58] one ounce
[1:54:00] under any condition whatsoever is thrown
[1:54:02] at us
[1:54:03] now can i can i say this to you if you
[1:54:06] can hear it you can say it
[1:54:09] if you can hear it you can say it if you
[1:54:11] can catch it you can say it that's why
[1:54:13] paul said in romans 10 the word of faith
[1:54:17] which we preach
[1:54:18] is nothing even in thy mouth
[1:54:22] do you recognize why you're hearing the
[1:54:24] word this morning if you catch a word
[1:54:27] it becomes a word of faith amen just a
[1:54:30] little word
[1:54:31] minister to you in the middle of a
[1:54:33] meeting
[1:54:34] it becomes a word of faith how many
[1:54:36] people has left church with a word of
[1:54:38] faith
[1:54:39] you come in the house of god and maybe
[1:54:40] something's trying to take over your
[1:54:42] life and all of a sudden you reach out
[1:54:43] and catch something
[1:54:44] and it becomes a word of faith well
[1:54:46] you've got to remember that word of
[1:54:47] faith is given to you for a reason
[1:54:49] because that's going to be your weapon
[1:54:52] that's going to be what you're going to
[1:54:53] get out of the trouble with
[1:54:55] that's what you're hey man god didn't
[1:54:56] say you wasn't going to get into
[1:54:57] something he said i'm going to give you
[1:54:59] something to overcome it
[1:55:00] i'm going to give you something to get
[1:55:01] out of it amen it's a word of faith
[1:55:03] which we preach
[1:55:05] now if that word of faith is preached
[1:55:07] and you catch it in a believer and i'll
[1:55:08] not be too much longer
[1:55:09] but you catch that word of faith in
[1:55:11] there now listen what happens to
[1:55:13] believers what happens to people
[1:55:15] is they get into shells they actually
[1:55:18] get into shells anybody ever been there
[1:55:20] in the middle of this all this junk's
[1:55:21] going on this cold weather thing people
[1:55:23] staying by their cells and they're
[1:55:24] getting along
[1:55:25] and they're they're they're not
[1:55:27] fellowship and and things are
[1:55:28] things are rough on some people some of
[1:55:30] the young people i understand there's
[1:55:32] things that are way different and
[1:55:33] everything
[1:55:34] 2020 calls things to be different but
[1:55:36] godding different
[1:55:38] and people start getting into this shell
[1:55:40] and and the next thing you know
[1:55:42] they begin to believe there's no way out
[1:55:44] of it they begin to believe that what
[1:55:47] their
[1:55:47] what they're imagining what they're
[1:55:49] hearing from the enemy
[1:55:51] what they're accepting what they're
[1:55:52] thinking they begin to think that is the
[1:55:55] reality
[1:55:56] amen but it's nothing but a shell that
[1:55:59] is trying to
[1:56:00] block the power of the resurrection away
[1:56:02] from your life
[1:56:03] and if you get yourself in that kind of
[1:56:06] place do you not realize you can get out
[1:56:08] of that
[1:56:09] you don't have to just lay down and say
[1:56:11] that's the way it is
[1:56:12] you've got to write this morning as the
[1:56:15] bride of jesus christ
[1:56:17] to say to this this this thing that's in
[1:56:20] front of you
[1:56:20] amen that this will not stand in the
[1:56:23] face of the word of god
[1:56:25] i'll tell you this amen that if you just
[1:56:27] begin to
[1:56:28] you can break any wall you can tear down
[1:56:30] any opposition
[1:56:31] you can destroy any enemy with the word
[1:56:34] of god
[1:56:35] that is actually in your mouth if you
[1:56:37] can hear it
[1:56:38] you can speak it if you can get it in
[1:56:40] you now
[1:56:41] i i think sometimes that sometimes we we
[1:56:44] get weary
[1:56:45] we get tired and we said brother wayne
[1:56:47] i've already tried that i've
[1:56:49] i've spoke the word of god and i've
[1:56:50] professed the word of god you again
[1:56:52] get a little weary with it but let me
[1:56:54] tell you something the bible talks about
[1:56:56] daniel in the bible
[1:56:58] and he prayed to the lord do you know he
[1:57:00] was exactly 21 days before he ever even
[1:57:02] got an answer
[1:57:04] he was 21 days before the lord answered
[1:57:06] his prayer but think about this
[1:57:08] amen i always wondered why brother brown
[1:57:10] used a chicken egg but do you know that
[1:57:12] when a chicken is coming out of an egg
[1:57:14] that there's a 21 day hatch period that
[1:57:16] that chicken has to begin to beat on
[1:57:18] that egg
[1:57:19] and you know what he's got to make up
[1:57:21] his mind that he's going to come out of
[1:57:22] that
[1:57:23] amen let me say something to you this
[1:57:24] morning amen you've got to make up your
[1:57:27] mind you're going to come out of it
[1:57:28] you've got to make up your mind that i
[1:57:30] have what it takes
[1:57:32] and i'm coming out of this you've got to
[1:57:34] let the spirit speak in your heart
[1:57:36] that i am a child of god i do not belong
[1:57:39] in this situation
[1:57:40] this spirit is not supposed to be my
[1:57:42] home i will not
[1:57:44] i will not allow myself to be blocked
[1:57:47] off from the power of god
[1:57:48] amen and watch when that word begins to
[1:57:50] generate in that heart
[1:57:52] you can begin to speak the word of god
[1:57:54] which is a thus saith the lord
[1:57:56] and the prophet of god said is like a
[1:57:58] little eagle or a chicken
[1:58:00] pecking on like he's pecking on the
[1:58:03] shell
[1:58:04] now now if you go and read a little bit
[1:58:06] you'll find out something
[1:58:07] that when when a chicken is pecking
[1:58:09] inside a shell do you know that you
[1:58:11] can't help him
[1:58:12] do you know you can't actually break the
[1:58:14] shell for him
[1:58:15] you know you can't actually help that
[1:58:17] little chicken he has to come out of it
[1:58:20] on his own he's got to make up his mind
[1:58:23] that
[1:58:23] life is worth it i've got to live
[1:58:26] there's life outside the shell
[1:58:27] let me tell you this morning there is
[1:58:29] life outside of discouragement
[1:58:31] there is life outside of nervousness
[1:58:34] there is life
[1:58:35] outside of drugs and addictions and
[1:58:37] alcohol there is
[1:58:38] life and life abundant
[1:58:41] let me say to you this morning there is
[1:58:44] power
[1:58:45] in the word of god that is spoken by the
[1:58:47] lips of a believer
[1:58:49] and when you begin to speak amen look at
[1:58:51] this i can't put nothing in you that
[1:58:53] ain't already in you
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:56] when a prophet of god talks about him
[1:58:57] coming out of that shell what he needs
[1:58:59] is already in him
[1:59:01] amen how he gets out of there you all
[1:59:03] know how he gets out he gets out through
[1:59:04] his mouth right
[1:59:05] he actually pecks his way out of that
[1:59:06] shell he actually peeps his way
[1:59:09] and the prophet of god taught that to a
[1:59:11] believer taking the word
[1:59:13] and peeping his way out of the situation
[1:59:16] and speaking against it until it has to
[1:59:19] move
[1:59:19] and let me say this if you'll take that
[1:59:21] word and you'll just keep pressing
[1:59:23] and you'll just keep speaking that word
[1:59:25] after a while a little crack will come
[1:59:27] in it
[1:59:28] and a little daylight will start and
[1:59:30] then a little bigger hole will come
[1:59:32] and if you will just keep it up after a
[1:59:34] little while
[1:59:35] there'll be a room enough that you can
[1:59:37] take a step
[1:59:38] outside of whatever that is only amen
[1:59:40] that's trying to circle you in
[1:59:46] what am i talking about i'm talking
[1:59:47] about coming out of it i'm talking about
[1:59:50] breaking out of it
[1:59:51] i'm talking about a breakout this
[1:59:53] morning a breakout break out of the
[1:59:55] thing

[2:00:04] and i'm doing it today
[2:00:07] he said oh preacher hey man you ain't
[2:00:09] talking about nothing but a bunch of
[2:00:10] words well let me tell you this
[2:00:13] the prophet of god said if you get the
[2:00:15] word the world bred out of you
[2:00:18] that you'll say what you want and it'll
[2:00:19] happen if you'll get the word

[2:00:30] and get the pure word of god
[2:00:32] amen you'll break out of anything with
[2:00:34] it amen let me say this did samson do it
[2:00:39] bit samson he was already anointed to
[2:00:41] kill philistines
[2:00:44] he was already anointed so when he come
[2:00:46] to that jawbone of that mule
[2:00:48] and he picked that mule bone up he was
[2:00:51] already anointed to do it
[2:00:52] so he started beating down philistines
[2:00:55] he beat down a
[2:00:56] thousand philistines with that jawbone
[2:00:58] amen it wasn't the jawbone of a hybrid
[2:01:01] it was a jawbone of a purebred animal
[2:01:04] because it represented
[2:01:06] amen and anointed people in the last
[2:01:08] days that with their mouth
[2:01:10] they shall overcome every devil that
[2:01:13] stands before them
[2:01:14] i'll tell you this if samson could kill
[2:01:17] a thousand
[2:01:18] philistines with his jawbone what about
[2:01:20] the church of the living god
[2:01:22] the pure mouth of the bride of jesus
[2:01:25] christ
[2:01:25] speaking the word of god over every
[2:01:28] situation
[2:01:29] over every devil over every trial tear
[2:01:32] down every wall
[2:01:34] i know i know it sounds crazy but let me
[2:01:36] tell you this to every goliath there's a
[2:01:38] rock
[2:01:39] amen to every wall there's a joshua
[2:01:41] through every situation there's a way
[2:01:43] out
[2:01:44] and there's a way to break out of that
[2:01:45] this morning there's a way
[2:01:47] and you've got to speak it out there
[2:01:49] you've got to place the word of god on
[2:01:51] your lips
[2:01:52] and say satan get out of me get out of
[2:01:54] the front of me
[2:01:55] i curse you in the name of jesus christ
[2:02:00] brother wayne you're going crazy no i'm
[2:02:02] not
[2:02:04] time for the bride of christ to actually
[2:02:05] recognize the power of the word
[2:02:12] recognize the power of the word that's
[2:02:13] enter you can speak
[2:02:16] now when you say that there's a whole
[2:02:18] group now saying that there's no more
[2:02:21] prayer lines and there's no more the
[2:02:23] move of god and
[2:02:24] because if you preach about the spoken
[2:02:25] word then all of a sudden they think
[2:02:28] that means
[2:02:29] there's no spiritual manifestation of
[2:02:31] like a prayer line i asked brother tim
[2:02:33] this morning i said
[2:02:34] what does people think that we're doing
[2:02:37] in those prayer lines
[2:02:39] waving feathers over somebody
[2:02:43] now there's a lot of you come through
[2:02:45] prayer lines a lot of our group there
[2:02:47] and true word tabernacle comes through
[2:02:49] prayer lines
[2:02:50] ain't nobody waving feathers over nobody
[2:02:53] amen the word of god is spoken over the
[2:02:55] lives
[2:02:56] the word of god is spoken over hearts
[2:02:58] you know you know just just this last
[2:03:00] sunday brother timothy came up to the
[2:03:01] church and
[2:03:02] i'll tell you what what a powerful
[2:03:03] preacher man golly the spirit of god
[2:03:06] moved
[2:03:07] what a what an anointing i probably
[2:03:09] wouldn't proper english to say that like
[2:03:10] that but
[2:03:11] forgive me the hillbilly's coming out
[2:03:16] the spirit of god used him ideally
[2:03:20] mightily we heard him we heard him give
[2:03:22] a testimony of when i was here a long
[2:03:24] time ago and
[2:03:25] well just how did i see you
[2:03:29] yeah right there wait a minute yeah
[2:03:32] transformed he gave testimony about the
[2:03:35] night you came in
[2:03:37] well you know what's amazing is we have
[2:03:39] a justin
[2:03:40] in our church and he's been out
[2:03:44] i can't say that he's not been in church
[2:03:46] like he should be in the last while
[2:03:50] and you know what when brother timothy
[2:03:53] gave that i don't even know if he knew
[2:03:54] that we had a justin
[2:03:55] that was needing to get some things
[2:03:57] right or get a touch from the lord
[2:03:59] but when he gave that testimony it
[2:04:01] wasn't long and justin's mama come up
[2:04:03] there
[2:04:04] and she couldn't even talk to us she
[2:04:06] just held up two fingers like this
[2:04:08] well i knew what the two fingers were it
[2:04:10] was a son and daughter-in-law
[2:04:13] and and when she did that there was
[2:04:15] something coming to my heart powerful
[2:04:17] because you know what i did
[2:04:18] two nights prior to that the lord gave
[2:04:21] me a dream
[2:04:22] about the her daughter-in-law
[2:04:25] and showed me she was at the church and
[2:04:27] she was singing a song
[2:04:29] and in the song she was saying i'm no
[2:04:31] longer
[2:04:33] a slave to fear i
[2:04:36] am a child of god and she was singing
[2:04:39] that song when that mother-in-law come
[2:04:41] up there
[2:04:41] i said sis i said let me tell you a
[2:04:44] dream i just had
[2:04:46] and in the dream the girl was singing
[2:04:47] the song and while she was singing the
[2:04:49] song
[2:04:50] i fell in the intercessory prayer it's
[2:04:52] right in the church just fell out
[2:04:54] in the dream fell an intercessory prayer
[2:04:57] and the spirit of god just kept moving
[2:04:58] through me i told her this dream
[2:05:00] brother timothy's standing right here
[2:05:01] and i'm talking this girl the brother
[2:05:03] was leading the songs about as far as
[2:05:04] from here
[2:05:05] back there to the exit door he's on the
[2:05:08] other side of the sanctuary
[2:05:10] and when i told the dream the brother
[2:05:12] changed the song from what he was saying
[2:05:14] and started playing the song i'm no
[2:05:16] longer
[2:05:17] a slave to fear i am a child of god when
[2:05:20] they begin to sing the song the spirit
[2:05:21] of intercessory just fell right in
[2:05:23] and literally i couldn't even stand on
[2:05:25] my feet for the power of prayer
[2:05:27] that come into me you know what it was
[2:05:29] because god's fixing to do something
[2:05:30] with some lives
[2:05:32] he's fixing to do something with some
[2:05:34] lives and that that isn't just a prayer
[2:05:36] line
[2:05:37] but there's some words being spoken and
[2:05:39] those are words of faith
[2:05:41] and i'm speaking them words right now
[2:05:42] i'm putting them out in the air for a
[2:05:44] purpose
[2:05:45] because my confession of faith says
[2:05:47] they're going to come home
[2:05:49] amen that everything that has happened
[2:05:50] will disappear
[2:05:52] that the spirit will be annihilated amen
[2:05:54] and i'm saying that this morning that
[2:05:56] things that's going on
[2:05:57] in life seem like it seems like it's
[2:06:00] completely
[2:06:01] beyond the possibility in the realm but

[2:06:52] and be delivered you ought to stand up
[2:06:54] and say i'm going to be delivered right

[2:06:59] i'm not going to allow the spirit
[2:07:05] i'm not going to allow it it's a spirit
[2:07:07] of unbelief and it's trying to hinder
[2:07:09] your life
[2:07:10] and i'm telling you in the name of the
[2:07:12] lord it is the time for you

[2:08:01] jesus christ
[2:08:02] i curse that devil by the power of the
[2:08:05] holy ghost

[2:08:20] not for you
[2:08:21] you're never going to get the miracle
[2:08:23] and you know what you ought to do take
[2:08:24] that word of faith
[2:08:25] and say the miracle is already on its
[2:08:27] way

[2:08:33] can't do it for you and the mama chicken

[2:08:39] can create an atmosphere
[2:08:41] that'll keep that baby alive until it
[2:08:44] can get itself out of that situation

[2:08:48] model eagles in this place

[2:08:52] keep the anointing of god alive
[2:08:55] until every child of god is able to
