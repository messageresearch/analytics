magnify you Lord the name that is above every name we love you father Lord we praise you and thank you for this time together in Jesus name amen amen let's turn to Zechariah 4. amen us going just a few weekends ago to brother Dale Smith's and and um had a wonderful time there with him and his congregation and and um was able to spend some time in fellowship with him and also he wants me to maybe make sure that I give his greetings I haven't been here on a Wednesday night to minister in a few weeks for their uh Matthew McGary was here that weekend that went Wednesday after I got back and brother Aaron last Wednesday and man we just had a wonderful time of the Lord amen I'm just so thankful for Real Men of God and that will stand shoulder to shoulder and declare the promises of God and amen without fear of favor amen and we're just thankful for that and uh so we've been a little bit sick and body but we're getting over that and we're thankful for the strength tonight to ministers this is looking here at Zechariah Zechariah Chapter 4 and verse 1. it says the angel that taught with me came again and wake me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep it said unto me what see is thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold and a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees buy it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other on the left side thereof so I answered and spoke to the angel and talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me nois thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto his removable saying not by might nor by power but my by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts amen we'll let you be seated I'd like to speak to you this evening on the light the fire fire amen you know as brother Brandon would bring this scripture out in the Patmos vision he would begin to explain the things and and reveal the things that were spoken here and it was talk about the trees that were on either side of this lamp that was Burning Brightly he said it was Burning Brightly because it had plenty of oil amen and so it was getting all from both sides and it was forgetting from these two olive trees and these two trees represent the old and the New Testament and of course the oil test tip typifies the Holy Ghost now I I think that's a wonderful statement that it had plenty of oil that it wasn't something that was about to run out or something that was in even in the context of worrying about but it was filled to the brim and I I believe that the the word of God is full of the promises of God they're full of the goodness of God they're full of the mercy of God they're full of everything that we have need of amen and I'm thankful that we don't have to worry about or that's something in Our Minds tonight that it's running out because it's not running out because there's still power that lays in the word of God and so of course it all typifies the Holy Ghost which who alone can give the light of God to the people and the angel spoke to Zechariah as much saying this is what you see it means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power it won't accomplish anything by its own theologies or its own intellectual conceptions or its own abilities it'll only accomplish things by the power of the Holy Ghost that's why Paul would come and he would say I do not come to you in word or deed only but I come in you to you in spirit and demonstration of the spirit of God Amen because it's not by my own might it's not by my own intellect now Paul could have he had intellect intellectual ability he had great school and he he had the abilities to put words together and maybe uh speak about the Greek words and all those things he might he could have maybe done all of those things but he was not relying upon that he was relying upon the one he met on the road to Damascus and the one that he met on the road to Damascus the light of God the pillar of fire amen that is what he would rely on throughout his whole life and his whole journey and I believe that's what we are relying on tonight but you notice you couldn't put a pipe in there amen or something you had to have a certain uh to draw the oil up it had to be something that that could that that was had a certain consistency about it or a certain nature about it that when he was dipped into the oil it couldn't be metal or it couldn't be a pipe or it couldn't be uh just it's anything you want it was a special thing that you would take and run down through there it was called a wick and brother Brandon would talk about that he said a wick is Faith he said well Wick is Faith and it's got to be run down into the oil of God and when it's run into the oil of God he said when you have your faith one end of it lit up by the fire of God the other end of it dipped in God's holy the ghost all there's going to be a Shining Light there's going to be something take place amen but we examine the lamp stand and we examine this Reservoir and we could see that in the central of it would bring out seven arms and we know those seven arms would typify amen seven Church ages and and and and and it would come out as we know the seven candlesticks would speak about each Church age and this but the same oil that burnt in this first church AIDS of the same oil that burns through every seven every one of the seven pipes and and another thing about this that that light never went out amen the priest what they would do they would just keep pouring oil in the bowl amen that's what I believe as priest of God we ought to make sure that our lights never go out amen that we continue to pour the all of God into the lamps amen that they continue to burn now as we know this lamp was lit in a very special way it wasn't lit by Moses it wasn't lit by Aaron it wasn't lit by the first priesthood amen but the priests would take a fire from the sacred altar which was originally lit by the fire of God when the fire of God would come down and it would come down to that sacrifice and it would light that first burnt offering amen that would continually feed that fire excuse me for a moment they would continually feed that fire and that lamp would begin to continually burn because it was to be lit by the original fire and so it would go from the first one to the second one to the third one to the fourth one to the fifth one to the sixth one lit by the original fire amen lit by the original fire the Holy Fire from God's altar being passed from lamp to lamp he said what a wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven Church ages the original outpouring of Pentecost which the outpouring came direct from Jesus on The Mercy Seat isn't doing his church through seven ages and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a never-changing God in his Essence and his ways amen so that fire it was signifying that God is always the same amen the light that Lit the first one is the light that lits lights the last way amen it isn't the intellectual abilities of Paul that lights the seventh Church age it isn't the abilities of Peter that lights the seven churches but it's the original light of God amen as Jesus would say I'm Divine ye are the branches he is the main Vine which come out of the original root from the original seed that has the life in it now that vine does not bear its fruit it's the branches that does that but you can say you can take any kind of citrus tree and you can graft other limbs you can take an orange tree and you can graft a grapefruit or you can graft a lemon or a tangelo and all those limbs will grow but if that life of that tree ever puts off another Branch it'll have the light of the the life of the root inside of it amen and I believe that's what we're looking at tonight if the life of Jesus Christ is putting off another Branch it has the same attributes it has the same life it has the same power it has the same Spirit it has the same light it has the same fire it has the same Holy Ghost amen it will be the same kind of Branch amen it was brought forth at Pentecost man it will speak in tongues it will prophesy it'll have powers and signs of the resurrected Jesus Christ and because it's thriving on the natural resources of the vine itself hallelujah amen we're not thriving on our own resources we're not thriving on our own abilities to gain strength or to be stronger or to be a strong movement that's not what we're thriving on we're thriving on the resources of the Vine and in the resources of the vine there's Divine Healing amen there's power they're speaking of tongues there's prophesy there's all of these things in the resources of the Vine amen but you see it wasn't you can't be grafted in it has to be born in Amen to be part of the original that's the problem with a lot of people we get grafted members amen say a few good things make a good pledge shake hands with a few people and we grafted them in they have a new theology they have a new message they have they've got that got the rules and the regulations this that and the other listen we don't need rules and regulations that's not what this message is about this message is about a life amen the message did not produce new rules and regulations the message pulled from the resource amen amen and it's in the resource is where it is pulled from it's in the Bible that's where it comes from and that's what gives us trees amen is not man amen is not it's not our denominational thinking it's not you know denominational thinking that can direct men you know a human I remember you know some folks that showed up one time and and they thought that we just regulated our sisters in a certain way that they wore dresses and that's just what they'd done and and you know one of the ladies said you know if we just talked about the Tim I'm sure he would let us wear pants and you know that's what she thought she thought it all come from a man amen they thought that you were wearing what you were wearing or doing what you were doing because of the decrees of a man no that's not why we do what we do we do what we do because we're born amen into the vine there's a life that flows through us and comes out of us and we can't help Who We Are [Applause] amen so if you expect to change who I am amen I can't help who I am amen I can't help that I was amen born a Son of God I can't help that I was born amen after the same life that Paul was born after and Peter was born after and all the other men throughout the ages that were born of The Same Spirit therefore we have the same life we have the same attributes we have the same God moving through us it's not regulated by man amen is regulated by the resource it's in the Bible but you know how thrilling you know is to think of these seven lamps drawing life or light from the resources of that Main Bowl because their Wicks were dipped therein each age Church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost good his work he's drawing the very Life of Christ by it gives out light to the church what kind of light is he given the very same light the first one gave Hallelujah we don't have a different light we have the same light we don't have a different life we have the same life we don't serve a different Jesus we have the same Jesus the same one Paul priests is the same one we believe amen the very same light that was in the first lamp that was lit and right on down to the ages to the last day messenger the same life the same light is manifested by a life that's hidden Christ and God he said well that's wonderful praise the Lord that's the messengers he said but it also speaks of what speaks of the messenger but every True Believer is also dramatically depicted here too amen they're all drawing from the same source Hallelujah they all have been dipped into the same Bowl they have dead to themselves are alive for their lives are hidden Christ and God and they're sealed in by the Holy Ghost no man can pluck them out of his hands their lives cannot be tampered with the visible life is burning and shining and giving light and manifestations of the Holy Ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in God and fed by the Lord's word Satan can't touch them not even death can touch that amen so it's very important that we have the original light that was lit not just another secondhand light you know we worried about secondhand smoke you need to be worried about secondhand light amen God don't have grandchildren you have to be born of the same light your mom and daddy were born up and if they weren't born of that light you still have to be born of that life amen listen we don't want secondhand light we want God's original light we don't want life that's passed down amen by traditions of something that's been passed down through ages and times that's not what we want it's just some tradition but we want the original light the original life the original Holy Ghost the original Power moving into Hearts moving in our lives moving to the homes moving in our churches Hallelujah we need to be at church that's on fire not with the laodicea and fire and smoke that's going to burn no sir that's not the fire we're looking for but the original fire that fell on the day of Pentecost is back again and it's moving and it's touching and I'll say God let it touch me [Applause] but we're also dealing with Strange Fire you know my uh Aaron's Aaron's two sons would come into the here they were called to be priests and they would come to do their duties and they would just bring their incense in and the Bible called said they offered Strange Fire before the Lord in other words it was a fire it was a fire that God had not lit amen they had to bring the same fire that God had lit not of their man-made ideas and then Petco quotes and how they want things to add up and how they want things to be no we want the fire of God amen we want the same fire that he lit and then went out of fire from the Lord and devoured them brother Brian will talk talk about it says these lamps they had it was their duty to take it in there but they had to be lit by the fire that God had lit Aaron's sons went in with some strange fire and God slew them in the door that's right Strange Fire he said if a man tried to go in the holy of holies if somebody started in the holy holies about coming through here he died Aaron's sons took Strange Fire one day he said some denominational fire amen when it wasn't and it said denominational fire and they died at the door they were were to take the same fire that God had lit and in not doing so it brought death amen we must be careful that we do not come with some to God with some man-made ideas or or man-made fire but we get the original fire that fell on the day of Pentecost amen man today is playing with fire and has broken into God's laboratory and has created his own fire and when it's going to bring death by nuclear destruction to Untold Millions of innocent people who has nothing to do with it and this is exactly what happens if a priest is not careful it does not bring what God the fire god lit but he brings a man-made idea or a man-made Creed or a man-made Dogma that's not what we want we want the original fire of God because that brings life but we know God dwells in fire go through scripture did we try to just go through this he called his people by fire that's what he did an angel the Lord appeared to Moses in a blazing fire in the midst of a bush he led his people by fire amen he led them with a cloud by day and then all night with a light of Fire amen David would say it like this he said he spread a cloud for recovering and a fire to Illuminate by night oh my amen that sounds like some people of this day amen that has the cloud in the fire it's showing the same God as in this Exodus once again it's not a calling out by man's decree amen it wasn't a man that called you to where you are today come on now there's not a man can put you where you are today amen we listen to some of y'all stories and how they man and how God orchestrated this and how he done this and how he moved this obstacle and how he done that listen that was not man that was the pillar of Fire and God is covering over his people amen he said he brought the cloud as a covering it would cover them during the hot days of the summer and walking through that desert and would keep those burning Rays off of them and would protect them amen and shield them to where their enemies couldn't even find them and then at night when they need to make a way and they didn't know where to go a light would appear and it would begin to burn and move and they would get behind that light and follow it wherever it went foreign he is described as fire in Exodus 15 it says you overthrow your adversaries by your great Majesty you Unleash Your burning Wrath it consumed them like stubble Exodus 24 says in the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a consuming fire on the Mountaintop foreign formal religion somehow not if you got the fire in it no no Deuteronomy 4 24 says for the Lord your God is a consuming fire a jealous God second Samuel 22 9 said smoke Rose from his nostrils and consuming fire came from his mouth glowing coals Blaze forth Psalms 97 3 says fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side Isaiah 33 14 says the Sinners and Zion are afraid trembling grips the ungodly who of us can dwell with a consuming fire who of us can dwell with Everlasting flames Daniel 7 says I beheld to the Thrones were cast down and the Ancients of days sit whose garment was white as snow and his hair on his head was like pure wool his throne was like the fiery Flame and his wills as burning fire but man we have the ability or the right to the original fire yet man wants to replicate the fire man wants to build their own fire man wants to decree how it should act and how big it should get and how how wide it should be how it should move to the church but God lit the church so if God LED his church with the original fire how are we supposed to tell him how his fire is supposed to act he's supposed to tell him how his word is supposed to move and to touch and who he's supposed to touch who he's not supposed to judge you how he's supposed to touch it and either they're getting out alive people like to build their fires in their own box some people are spiritual fire extinguishers brother Brown would call them wet blankets but their spiritual fire extinguishers see a little something happen and they want to sit down on and Camp down on it and say it ain't so if the church is going to move in power and demonstration it'll have to be the original fire or otherwise no matter the shouting the dancing the jumping the Sid or the sitting on your hands none of that matters not saying a word doesn't matter but if that original life is not there than that original fire is not there we need that original fire the Reynolds said like this he said Moses needed a touch I guess I'm just supposed to go slow tonight he tried to do it intellectually he tried to do it in his own power and he said that's what's the matter with the churches of our day we're trying to do it through schooling foreign we're trying to do it through denominations and we're trying to do it through education and we're trying to do it through Reformation but what the church needs is a new birth a baptism of the Holy Spirit the touch of the seventh sin the sixth sense that sets the soul on fire that touch will bring the sinner out of the root Hallelujah area that touch will bring him out of pornography that touch will bring him out of sin that church will bring her Amen to a life of overcoming power God needs to touch the church amen he said well I don't know well you know man was being ordained one day and the elders stand around said Lord wrap them up and Burl up sat burlap sacks pour kerosene on him and set him a fire for the gospel hey boy it sounds like some real praise the Lord religion wrap him up and burn up burlap sacks pour carousel on all seen on him and set him a fire for the gospel that's what we need today on fire turn him loose then and let him run he said it used to Brand cow calves and we'd take a calf so I know you roped and hogtied them anyone I guess he said we used to Brand them someone said aren't you ashamed to pack that hot iron and stick that on that poor little calf side aren't you ashamed of that brother Brown aren't you ashamed you know Peter and all them other people aren't you ashamed no that's pretty simple I like that they got to give you no reason no aren't you ashamed of the presence of God falling in the church aren't you ashamed when somebody gets a little drunk on the spirit and they got to be toted out aren't you ashamed amen when the tongue starts speaking and God starts prophesying no he said I stick that on his side oh he'll have a kicking fit he'll Squall he'll Bellow but when he's turned loose he has a spasm and he'll really run but he knew from then on who he belonged to Hallelujah he knows as long as he lives I belong to this one Hallelujah that's what happens to a true born-again Christian that when the fire god falls upon you there's never no doubt anymore I belong to I know who I am and who's my daddy Garner you your shame of those people down there acting like that no you may scream you may cry you may act funny but you'll know who you belong to from then on for you're sealed into the kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit it's the seal he said but God's goodness can come and it's become so common to we don't enjoy it like we used to if God can open our eyes and give us a desire to do something for him second night of Revival 150 people in the audience do you know I wonder what would happen if our eyes could see what our Lord did last night to see what he will do any night amen each Christian Soul should be so zealous and so full of the fire of God his eyes open to see the coming of the Lord for these are the signs and Mild post of his soon appearance even science is declaring it moving the clock up 90 seconds to midnight and they're saying they're being optimistic we're closer than we ever been we see signs we see mild post of a soon appearing we see it in the Gentile world is just about to end we see all these things and we yawn and we Pat our mouths and we go to sleep and say why does he preach so long that's a direct quote 57 12 the door of the door and the Lord comes down and performs things as he said he would but it was Moses there was any trained man who could depend on intellect Moses would be the man had to degree degrees all over his wall of Egypt and how he led him in this battle in that battle and smartest man in Egypt went out to try to deliver his Brethren made a mistake fled and there he was on the backside of a desert for 40 years for God to beat some of that theology out of him to take the clay and beat it down until it was ready but one day this man was out there minding his own business for attendance of some sheep and he see that thing burning over there and he said it and he was 80 years old now and he learned more in the in the presence of that burning bush in five minutes then he learned in 80 years of school of Egypt sure when Moses lacked the bush had what the church lacks the bush has amen what you like the Holy Ghost has [Applause] you don't have to find Dr Dobson he ain't got it neither does any other psychologists they ain't got it but the Holy Ghost has got it you find him you'll find what you like foreign God he said what he said the Holy Ghost says God the same fire of God what the schools need is fire amen and what the schools need is fire Holy Ghost and Fire in the presence of fire he had an experience he was running from Egypt before the bush after the bush he's running to Egypt sometimes God can do things so ridiculous to the carnal mind could you imagine the next morning Moses tells his wife the poor that we're saddled up get the kid on each hip Moses with old dry stick Whiskers hanging down inside praising the Lord going down over the hills if that ain't a pitiful sight looking to buy the carnal mind somebody say Moses where are you going I'm going down to Egypt to take over a one-man Invasion but think of it the thing of it was he did it the thing of it was he did it he had had an experience he didn't care how many Egyptians he had slew first time he slew one and got in trouble Run next time he slew the whole Army he hadn't experience with god what the church needs tonight is not more schooling it needs an experience with God a fire spiritual Holy Ghost and Fire experience foreign service I was here but I've mentioned it again because I love this story Brandon had that experience with a fire found him a turtle thought man old Turtle walked up to him you know that Turtle does sucks up in his shell reminds me some turtles in church say something a little bit on there on their toes fire goes by their head preacher gets on them a little bit amen odd looking creature I just want you to understand if you're a turtle in church in a Holy Ghost and Fire Church you're an odd looking creature when the power of God's Fallen the people rejoice and you're sitting over in your little shell you're an odd looking creature that's just a little extra as soon as you got up to him he pulls himself back in that shell closes up read your duet direct quote puts me in mind of a whole lot of so-called Christians as soon as you mentioned Divine Healing or you mentioned the Holy Ghost oh no we don't believe in that well we wanted to see him move and he said I want to see the church move too amen but it couldn't move till you get his legs working and if the church won't move to the whole body goes to work I said just a minute brother I'll make a move went and got me a switch poured it on to him didn't do no good you can beat it beat him you can beat them and beat him or you whip more the tighter they get how can I make a move I found me a water some water and I put him in the water and I held him down until just a few bubbles come up he said I know you had all kind of baptisms sprinkling porn made denomination of what happens go down and drive Center come up a wetland doesn't do any good you can beat it into them you can't beat it into them nor you could Nate nor can you baptize it into them you know what I did I got me some sticks and a little piece of paper and I made a fire and I set that old boy on top of it I just put this in your mind this is pretty hilarious I know Peter wouldn't like this story but I like it amen who get you some sticks build your fire and put that turtle on top of it and I made that fire then and boy did he begin to move if there's anything that'll move the Church of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost fallen again not some new theology not some new way to baptize but just let the Holy Ghost fall in the church the fire the light of God the trouble of his you took the fire off the altar and it was a god-led fire William Branham didn't like this fire I'll get to that in a minute is a gauntlet fire the trouble of it is you took the fire off the altar it needs to be on the altar it needs to be in every heart again an old-fashioned Saint Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost is way Awakening powers of God what the church needs tonight is not a weapon not a theology but the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire that's what's going to make the church move set the church on fire with the gospel set the fire of God down on them through the baptism the Holy Ghost how to make a move praise God forever that's what it takes to make the church move under the blood the blood brings the fire the sacrifice was offered by fire the blood on the fire begins to make smoke and the smoke goes up as a sweet smelling Savior and it went to the Savior himself foreign we need fire we need fire to leave here just as an astronaut we need fire to leave this atmosphere to go into another one the Bride of Jesus Christ has to have fire to leave here you can have the beautiful rocket you can have the all the beautiful engine and you can polish it and you can make it look all good but if they ain't fire it ain't going nowhere amen that's what he would say in countdown he said there's an entrance there's a place a way of Escape and he said there's a countdown that's going on but there has to be fire there has to be fire there has to be the power to make it rise the same power they received on the day of Pentecost the same way it has been all the time the same one because it's the same door how do we get in this body by the same door Jesus is the door to the body now the door is just about to close and Leo to see it just last countdown and the church is fixing to take its orbit above all tribulations above all the destruction above all the things that are going on here in the earth and is about to rise into another atmosphere is that morning when John Glenn took off everybody was on their faces crying and praying wonder if he's ever going to be able to achieve what he set out to achieve first thing you know fire begins to spread from them Adams is that great big missile lifted off there at Cape Canaveral going up in the air like that people screaming and crying and wondering what happened to their astronaut that was going up but old church Glory she's spreading some fire too the church is spreading some fire to the countdown's on justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost layout of sin that church age where at the end Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what's the matter ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero there won't be no crime but they'll be seeing and shouting and praising God as the church takes his astronaut moving to the skies by the power of the Holy Ghost [Applause] foreign he said in a natural achievement they've taken off to the moon but in a spiritual achievement we've taken off towards heaven Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is lifting her up above the moon stars right Beyond everything could ever be achieved by man the church will take your flight into the bosoms of God one of these morning friends a man has been able to achieve what they have by their natural things but God is achieving even more by the supernatural Hallelujah but the church needs tonight it needs the Holy Ghost and Fire to get the church moving for the kingdom of God it'll walk then a Revival except Christ the word believe it let it sink down the fifth rib on the left side till it anchors in the bottom of the heart then floods of Joy will spring up joy unspeakable and full of Glory the holy spirit will make you sing feel my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly Dove it'll do something to you what we need is that fire it puts an energy in there it puts an energy in there listen if you get the fire of God in your services it'll put an energy in there the children of Israel one time halting between two opinions there was some that was worshiping Baal and there were some that was worshiping God it got to the point that Elijah thought it was only him but God told him said no I've got seven seven thousand I believe it was Souls that has not been in the knee hey man I'm glad that seventh one was in there Elijah came to him and said why halt he called him to Mount Carmel I've been able to stand on that mountain said how why how long are you going to Halt between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if they'll be God follow him and the people answered not not a word and Elijah said unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but Bell's Prophet are 450 Men Let Them therefore give us two Bullocks let them choose one bullet for themselves and cut in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under it and I will dress the other Bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under it so we're going to both play on a Level Playing Field and you call the name of your God and I'll call on the name of the Lord and the god that answers by fire he has scripture for this the god that answers by fire let him be God and all the people answered said it's well spoken we know the story as they begin to build their Altar and they begin to cry aloud and they and they begin to dance and holler and brothers said they were sincere they wouldn't make believe and they were sincere enough to cut themselves they they were looking for something to happen but they were serving a dead God a dead Creed a dead letter a theology foreign of God looked down after them and called even to noon and he and there was no voice to answer they began to leap Elijah looked at him and mocked him he said well cry louder either he's talking or he's pursuing or he's on a journey maybe he's sleeping and must be awakened that scripture I'm reading it right out must be awakened and they cried louder and they cut themselves more until the blood gushed out of them but it came time to the evening sacrifice and they will have neither voice nor had any answer and they had no answer to what was going on they couldn't say what was happening Elijah said okay that's enough he said he called the people said come here and the people came here and he repaired the altar of the Lord he brought everything back into his position he put the 12 Stones back in their place hey amen he put amen the godhead back in his place he put serpent seed back in his place he put the baptism back in his place he put all the Lost truths down through the Dark Ages back in their place [Applause] and he said I want you to understand this ain't rigged bring me water bring me one and put what bring me water and they pour buckets of water until it soaked the trench or soaked Altar and filled the trench that was around the altar when he had put it all in order they brought fill four barrels of water and poured on the burnt sacrifice do it a second time so there's eight barrels and the water ran about the Altar and it filled the trench and there came time Pat came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice in the evening time it shall be light God doesn't make mistakes Church he puts things in there as types and he's showing his people in that day but in his mind he's looking to a people in the last day and he's like gonna be a lot of people with theologies and dead gods and historical gods and historical ideas but I'm here to tell you there is one true Living God amen and he began to stop and he said oh Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let him be known this day that thou art God in Israel and I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy Word so apparently Elijah had Visions as well after Thy word Hear Me O Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and thou has turned what turn their heart back again do you see yourself on Mount Carmel it turned their heart back again so they'll know it has nothing to do with me they'll know it's not the seventh grade the educated Prophet it's not me but it's you oh God it's nothing that I conjured up it's nothing that's my own doing it's not my intellectual abilities but I've done at Thy Word [Applause] and the fire of God fell and consume the burn sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is God the Lord he is God I say in this age Let The God Who Answers by fire let him be God because let me tell you he does some wonderful things with this fire he destroys your enemy with this fire he makes a way with this fire he
