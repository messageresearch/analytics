[19:41] those that suffer
[19:43] was the cry
[19:45] [Music]
[19:47] those that weep
[19:49] stand with them amen let's pray together
[19:52] tonight father we come humbly in your
[19:55] presence
[19:56] knowing Lord that you know all things
[20:00] you're the great creator of heavens and
[20:02] earth
[20:03] desired that you could have fellowship
[20:05] with man and you set aside your Priestly
[20:08] garments and your kingly robes
[20:11] came down into Mankind and
[20:14] bridged a gap and made a way that we
[20:16] could have fellowship with you
[20:19] Lord there's nothing that we can bring
[20:21] of ourselves
[20:25] but just yield to you Lord
[20:27] say Have Thine Own Way Lord Have Thine
[20:30] Own Way Thou Art the Potter and we are
[20:33] but the clay
[20:34] mold us and make us Lord into your image
[20:37] into your likeness
[20:40] Lord tonight we've come and to the house
[20:43] of God where you would come and speak
[20:46] words of life and your word would come
[20:48] forth and those that are bound could be
[20:50] delivered and those that have come
[20:52] bearing burdens Lord those burdens could
[20:55] be cast down at your feet and they could
[20:57] walk out without the Yoke of bondage
[20:59] Lord but taking your yoke Lord that is
[21:02] easy for your burden is light
[21:05] Lord you've made a way where there is no
[21:07] way and we thank you for that this
[21:09] evening

[21:58] inspired to his heart and may it be bred

[33:09] amen that's wonderful
[33:11] you know if we can come
[33:15] making him our everything
[33:18] making him our Focus laying aside
[33:21] everything and we spoke last time on the
[33:23] power of one mind and getting in one
[33:25] mind and one Accord and we'll kind of
[33:28] continue that a little bit you know
[33:30] I was thinking about it even at the at
[33:32] the meetings this weekend there in Ohio
[33:35] how you get that many people together
[33:37] and they come with one purpose and with
[33:39] one mind and it's about it's about God
[33:42] and it's about getting closer and it's
[33:43] about getting more and you see what
[33:45] takes place when people get in that
[33:48] Unity of mind and when they come
[33:50] thinking God you're my everything God
[33:52] you're my savior God You're My Healer
[33:55] God I just need more of you and in those
[33:57] moments and in those times there's a
[34:00] breakthrough
[34:01] and what we have to recognize within
[34:04] each and every one of us even as
[34:05] individuals
[34:07] is that we have a lot to do with whether
[34:09] or not there's a breakthrough in a
[34:11] service
[34:13] you have a lot to do with what happens
[34:16] to other people in a service
[34:20] so we can't come to a church service and
[34:22] be selfish I don't feel good I'm not in
[34:24] a good mood I'm working through
[34:26] something I'm upset I don't care people
[34:29] around you need you to enter in people
[34:31] around you need you to create an
[34:33] atmosphere there's people whose souls
[34:36] are hanging in the balance and you're
[34:38] creating an ice cube right there on your
[34:40] Pew and not allowing the spirit to break
[34:42] out in that spot
[34:44] and I hate to say it but there will be
[34:46] accountability for it because there's so
[34:49] only so many opportunities we get
[34:51] let's give him our everything tonight
[34:53] let's give him our all tonight let's
[34:56] just push through any feeling of
[34:58] tiredness any weariness
[35:03] let's remember why we're here hey
[35:06] before we go to the word I would just
[35:08] like to just briefly just say
[35:11] how proud that that I was of our young
[35:14] people this weekend and and even in in
[35:18] the travel the way they act and conduct
[35:20] themselves on the bus the way they
[35:22] conduct themselves in truck stops and
[35:24] restaurants along the way the way they
[35:27] conduct themselves at camp that they do
[35:29] evening light Tabernacle very very proud
[35:32] and I think we should give them a hand
[35:33] this evening
[35:38] they are an awesome group they are an
[35:41] awesome group but that don't happen by
[35:43] accident
[35:44] awesome parents an awesome church family
[35:47] that they're part of we thank each and
[35:49] every one of you and it was a wonderful
[35:51] Camp I'd also like to tell you I mean
[35:53] all the ministry was great but just to
[35:56] to brag on our own brother Timothy was
[35:58] just absolutely over the top this
[36:00] weekend above and beyond the Lord just
[36:03] came down and blessed and he did us
[36:05] proud it was just an awesome thing to be
[36:08] a part of and a little bit weary but
[36:10] we're glad to be back we're excited to
[36:13] be here so with that being said let's
[36:14] let's pray before we go to the word
[36:18] Heavenly Father Lord with all our hearts
[36:20] we just want to say thank you Lord thank
[36:22] you for this opportunity thank you for
[36:24] this church Lord thank you for each Soul

[36:33] forever Lord even getting texts today
[36:36] Lord from Brother Tom there in Ohio
[36:38] talking about his ten-year-old
[36:39] granddaughter getting the Holy Ghost and
[36:41] Lord my own daughter receiving the
[36:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[36:45] different ones Lord that traveled up and

[36:55] speak to us tonight Lord May the things
[36:57] that started this weekend made those
[36:59] fires Lord just be built up and get
[37:01] stronger Lord and fed Lord till they're
[37:04] just roaring and blazing in the lives of
[37:06] of the young people Lord but Lord that

[37:10] lives of us Lord each and every adult

[37:24] this service I pray Lord that all things
[37:26] will be said and done for your glory in
[37:28] Jesus name we pray amen
[37:31] amen we
[37:33] want to look into the book of Psalms
[37:38] Psalms 133 and 1.
[37:41] Psalms 133-1 we're going to continue a
[37:45] little bit on the kind of along the same
[37:47] lines that we spoke on last time we were
[37:49] speaking on the power of one mind and we
[37:50] were talking about one mind and one
[37:52] Accord tonight I want to speak on
[37:54] fighting for Unity
[37:57] fighting for Unity and it may be a
[37:59] little bit of a Sunday school lesson
[38:01] type tonight I had other things that I
[38:04] thought I was going to study out and
[38:05] Minister but you know the Lord's just
[38:07] really been specifically dealing with
[38:08] our church in a certain way these last
[38:10] few services and and the one that
[38:12] brother Joe preached right before we
[38:14] left was just incredible on forgiveness
[38:16] and that was an amazing service and we
[38:19] spoke about one mind and one Accord and
[38:21] now fighting for Unity the Lord just
[38:24] wanted me to go down this this line
[38:26] tonight so we're going to obey him it
[38:29] says
[38:30] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[38:34] for Brethren to dwell together in unity
[38:39] it is like the precious ointment upon
[38:42] the head that ran down upon the beard
[38:45] even Aaron's beard that went down to the
[38:48] skirts of his garments as the Dew of
[38:50] Herman and as the Dew that descended
[38:53] upon the mountains of Zion for there the
[38:55] Lord commanded the blessing even life
[38:59] forevermore amen you may have your seats
[39:02] we just pray that the Lord will add His
[39:04] blessings
[39:05] to the reading of the word
[39:08] like we said last time we were we were
[39:10] preaching on on on on the power of one
[39:13] mind and as and as we focus then on one
[39:16] mind and one Accord and and we're going
[39:18] to continue like I said today and and
[39:20] look at at fighting for Unity fighting
[39:24] for Unity we all know that that Unity is
[39:27] not something that has ever really come
[39:29] easy for man ever since the fall it's
[39:32] not easy to be in perfect Unity even
[39:34] with those that you love the dearest and
[39:36] love the most and people that you would
[39:39] give your life for sometimes you can't
[39:41] hardly dwell in unity because we all
[39:43] have different Natures we all have
[39:45] different things that make us tick
[39:46] different things that get on our nerves
[39:48] different things that make us happy and
[39:49] we're all different people different
[39:52] individuals and so Unity isn't really
[39:54] something that comes easy it is
[39:56] something that we have to fight for
[40:00] um and our history of humanity has been
[40:03] constant division constant fighting
[40:06] constant quarreling and that's why I
[40:08] down through history when you see times
[40:10] of unity it tends to be something that
[40:13] catches your eye when you study history
[40:15] it tends to be moments in history that
[40:18] People Unite for a common cause those
[40:21] moments really tend to stand out and
[40:24] it's usually in these times in history
[40:26] where great things are accomplished when
[40:30] people come together in unity that's
[40:32] during the time that you'll see great
[40:34] Innovation or you'll see great
[40:36] advancements or or times of unity bring
[40:39] Liberation or even the births of Nations
[40:41] because people were able to lay aside
[40:44] their differences long enough to unite
[40:46] together and fight for a common goal
[40:51] all right but it only takes a very short
[40:53] time it seems after that goal is reached
[40:56] and suddenly that commonality begins to
[40:58] wear off and suddenly the strength that
[41:00] came from that begins to deteriorate and
[41:03] once again people are right back to
[41:05] bickering and fighting and their
[41:07] disagreements and things of that nature
[41:08] you know just to give you a couple
[41:10] examples of this I was looking through
[41:12] at different Empires and different
[41:14] things and and I got to looking at Rome
[41:16] and how they United the world under one
[41:19] great Empire
[41:21] and at that time probably the greatest
[41:23] Empire that had ever been and it was
[41:25] because they all had the attitude that
[41:28] this is for the glory of Rome there was
[41:31] no one in it for the glory of themselves
[41:33] there was no one in it to build their
[41:35] own Empire everything they did was for
[41:37] the glory of Rome and because of this
[41:39] suddenly education spread to the world
[41:42] there were architectural and Engineering
[41:45] Marvels Road systems were built that
[41:48] were so intricate they're better than
[41:49] the roads that are currently in
[41:51] Shreveport still to this day
[41:54] and I don't okay that really wasn't a
[41:56] compliment was it
[41:58] but they built Road systems so intricate
[42:01] that even today it's a well-known saying
[42:03] that all roads lead to Rome it's
[42:07] something people said there were codes
[42:08] of law that served as the foundation for
[42:11] modern law literature literature spread
[42:13] like wildfire the very calendar we use
[42:16] and things like that were developed
[42:18] during this time medicine and and
[42:20] medical advancements developed in this
[42:22] time but over time it became less and
[42:26] less about Rome and more and more about
[42:28] individuals
[42:30] more and more about power about who
[42:32] would be in charge and who would get the
[42:34] credit for this Victory and and which
[42:36] politician was a was going to be the
[42:39] most powerful and which general was
[42:40] going to be the greatest and who would
[42:42] carry the most influence and even though
[42:44] Rome was eventually invaded by Germanic
[42:47] tribes the most historians will agree
[42:50] that the fall of Rome was due to
[42:53] division amongst themselves
[42:56] the division that crept in and became
[42:58] about individuals instead of about the
[43:01] greater good of the Empire we can look
[43:04] at our own Nation a nation of colonists
[43:06] a nation of farmers poor people without
[43:10] much weapons just little malicious but
[43:12] United against the greatest nation in
[43:14] the world they birthed the new nation
[43:17] they they got United at this idea of
[43:19] Liberty and this idea of freedom and
[43:21] they stood together and they laid aside
[43:23] their differences and they fought in
[43:25] unity and they won one of the most
[43:27] astounding victories in history but you
[43:30] only have to go a couple Generations
[43:31] later and there's a civil war ripping
[43:34] the very Nation apart that they fought
[43:36] in unity to buy but suddenly just a
[43:39] couple Generations later there's a civil
[43:41] war in the Nations being torn apart
[43:45] yeah there's been other times down
[43:46] through history just in my life that I
[43:48] can remember where Unity has brought
[43:50] what we would call maybe bounces in
[43:52] patriotism I remember being 10 or 11
[43:55] years old 1991 when Desert Storm took
[43:58] place and and all of a sudden everybody
[44:00] was proud to be an American again and
[44:02] and they were United against the common
[44:04] enemy you know everybody had signs in
[44:07] the yard God bless our troops you know
[44:08] and things like that and then that Fades
[44:11] away
[44:12] and then 9 11 happens and there for a
[44:15] short period of time we had a common
[44:16] enemy again and suddenly everybody was
[44:19] proud to be American again and yet then
[44:21] that Fades away
[44:23] and there was a time where a message
[44:25] came and struck this Earth and we were
[44:27] all just proud to be called out proud to
[44:29] be in the message proud to know that God
[44:31] sent a prophet proud to know that we
[44:33] were called proud to know that we were
[44:35] chosen but over time what has happened
[44:37] some of that has all slipped away and
[44:39] it's about when my church says this and
[44:41] my church says that and I don't see it
[44:43] like this and I don't see it like that
[44:45] listen I think Unity is something worth
[44:47] fighting for I think we should still be
[44:49] proud we should still put our arms
[44:51] around one another we should still love
[44:53] our brother and sister thank God you've
[44:56] heard the call thank God you've been
[44:58] called out thank God there's a Rapture
[45:00] for you thank God there's a Rapture for
[45:02] me and let our Unity Never Fade like
[45:05] like those natural things do
[45:08] amen United for a time period we were
[45:13] United in our commonality and not
[45:15] divided by our differences
[45:18] I'll think about this right here United
[45:20] in our commonality and not divided by
[45:23] our differences even like Tabernacle
[45:25] that's what I long to see and I believe
[45:27] that that's exactly what God longs to
[45:30] see it's where we're United by what we
[45:32] have in common and not torn apart by our
[45:36] differences United against a common
[45:38] enemy let me remind you you are not my
[45:41] enemy I am not yours your wife is not
[45:43] yours your kids nobody else is your
[45:45] enemy your enemy is the devil my enemy
[45:48] is the devil and if we will unite in the
[45:50] commonality of that and focus our our
[45:53] our our Warfare against him and quit
[45:55] fighting one against the other we will
[45:57] be an invincible Army if we'll focus
[46:00] that when we become United against one
[46:03] enemy United under the blood United
[46:06] under this message an invincible Army
[46:09] marching to Onward Christian Soldier
[46:14] if Nations and people
[46:17] can do Mighty powerful things in the
[46:20] natural when they become United
[46:22] what about the Bride of Jesus Christ in
[46:25] the spiritual when we become United I
[46:28] tell you we would do more than build
[46:29] roads and Science and education but the
[46:32] kingdoms of hell would be torn down
[46:33] prison bars would come open there would
[46:36] be healings and deliverances there would
[46:38] be refillings of the Holy Ghost if we
[46:40] would just unite one against the other
[46:42] I'm telling you the Rapture would get
[46:44] here a lot quicker sometimes we think
[46:45] we're waiting on God we're waiting on
[46:47] God and he's waiting on us to get into
[46:49] place because the scripture says that
[46:52] the marriage of the Lamb has come and
[46:54] the bride hath made herself ready
[46:57] we gotta quit fighting against each
[46:59] other and shooting against each other
[47:01] and realize we're in this together I
[47:03] need you you need me and let's love one
[47:06] another through our differences and go
[47:08] to war with the Devil
[47:10] amen what might we do
[47:14] my belief we would see the sick healed
[47:16] every service
[47:18] because there's power in unity
[47:21] there's strength in unity there's
[47:23] victory in unity when we all get in one
[47:27] Accord when we all get United for the
[47:29] same goal and against the same entity
[47:31] enemy
[47:33] I believe that heaven's open and Hell
[47:35] shakes
[47:37] hey man I believe that with all my heart
[47:39] God comes down and chains begin to fall
[47:41] off lives are changed and great
[47:44] advancements happen
[47:46] great advancements happen when the
[47:48] church comes in unity in one mind and
[47:50] one Accord not just things of temporary
[47:53] not just natural but Eternal
[47:55] advancements in the lives of men and
[47:58] women and in the lives of our children
[48:00] so as we say all this and we recognize
[48:02] the power of unity
[48:05] guess what the devil hates
[48:07] Unity
[48:10] he hates Unity
[48:12] and he's always coming to try to break
[48:14] apart our Unity with jealousy With Envy
[48:17] with Strife listen sometimes it ain't
[48:20] none of that sometimes it's just with
[48:21] with personality differences
[48:26] listen we've covered this before we're
[48:28] going to cover it again it's okay if you
[48:30] don't like people it's not okay if you
[48:32] allow that to hinder spiritual things
[48:39] we're not all going to hang out I don't
[48:41] know why we're here again but we're
[48:42] going to talk about it
[48:45] this is just annoying me I'm gonna go
[48:47] ahead and move it
[48:48] I just noticed it
[48:53] we're not all going to be best buddies
[48:55] we're not all going to think every
[48:57] single person in here is the awesomest
[48:59] person because that wouldn't work
[49:00] mathematically that's not possible
[49:05] but we can lay aside our differences
[49:07] that's what I get out of the book of
[49:09] Acts when you see there are some buses
[49:10] and you see some quarrels and you see
[49:12] some disagreements that's not what I
[49:14] focus on I say isn't it awesome that
[49:16] they were so different had such
[49:18] different ideas and yet for the for the
[49:20] gospel's sake for the cause of Christ
[49:22] for the cause of the Holy Ghost breaking
[49:24] out in people's lives for the cause of
[49:26] Salvation they were willing to lay those
[49:28] things aside and be mature enough to
[49:31] walk on and March on and fight together
[49:34] in unity against the enemy and not make
[49:37] one another their enemies
[49:40] he tries to tear up Unity with
[49:42] backbiting
[49:44] with the tongue
[49:47] we're not going to have time to get into
[49:49] it today but man as I said I studied a
[49:51] lot of James 3 this week and it's all
[49:53] about the tongue and it says some pretty
[49:55] harsh things
[49:57] about the tongue and how evil it is and
[50:00] how no man can tame it and how it's held
[50:02] fire and all kind of things listen we
[50:04] got to be careful what we say if there's
[50:06] that much power in the tongue which the
[50:09] word says they're in why not what says
[50:10] there is why not use it for good
[50:12] why not use it to speak life and speak
[50:14] Victory and speak healing and speak
[50:16] Deliverance listen instead of speaking
[50:18] well that person this and that person
[50:20] that and that person is how about we
[50:22] speak Lord bless them Lord pour it out
[50:24] in their lives Lord help me Lord to love
[50:27] them the way you love them help me to
[50:29] look at that brother the way you look at
[50:30] that brother Lord I speak life in this
[50:33] situation
[50:38] Satan hates Unity
[50:40] think about the beauty
[50:43] and the unity of Heaven
[50:46] and all of its perfection
[50:49] Perfect Harmony
[50:51] it was absolutely perfect and in that
[50:54] setting
[50:55] in that Harmony and in that perfect
[50:57] Unity Satan starts a campaign
[51:02] think about it it couldn't have got any
[51:04] better
[51:04] [Music]
[51:07] it's not like God could have made it
[51:09] better and made Satan happy
[51:12] some folks just ain't gonna be happy
[51:16] no matter what
[51:20] that's why that's why I tell my wife
[51:21] sometimes when when we're looking at
[51:23] reviews like about certain hotels and
[51:25] it's negative negative and I'm like look
[51:27] listen you got to understand
[51:30] certain people are review people and
[51:33] they're generally not happy people
[51:37] now if I go there and it's a terrible
[51:39] hotel that's on me I should have
[51:40] listened to the negative people
[51:44] I should listen
[51:46] but I'm not typically a review guy and I
[51:48] said because some people you just can't
[51:50] make happy
[51:51] but Satan starts a campaign and he
[51:53] starts setting up sides
[51:57] he starts setting up see Satan loves for
[51:59] there to be sides because when there's
[52:02] sides there cannot be Unity
[52:06] when their sides there when there's
[52:08] Unity there isn't sides
[52:11] it's Unity
[52:13] so Satan loves for there to be sides he
[52:16] loves for this one to be against that
[52:17] one he loves for there to be bitterness
[52:19] and he loves for there to be hatred if
[52:21] you don't think that's the case look at
[52:22] the world we live in
[52:25] look around at the world we live in you
[52:27] know he took Jesus up on the mountain he
[52:29] offered him the kingdoms of the world
[52:31] and the reason he could do this he
[52:33] couldn't offer them to me unless they
[52:35] belonged to him they were his
[52:38] so look at the nature of the Kingdom
[52:41] that he rules
[52:43] constant fighting
[52:45] constant choosing sides this cause
[52:47] against that cause this shits you
[52:49] against that issue constant threats
[52:51] constant bickering
[52:53] you know if Jesus ruled over the
[52:55] kingdoms of this Earth we could stack
[52:56] all the weapons right now and never have
[52:58] to worry about it ever again
[53:00] you never have to lock your door you'd
[53:02] never have anxiety you'd never have fear
[53:04] because he's the Prince of Peace
[53:06] and there would be peace upon the Earth
[53:07] you would never have a worry but Satan
[53:10] rules right now
[53:12] in the world we live in is his Eden
[53:17] and it's obvious that it's his because
[53:19] he is the author he's the author of
[53:22] death he is the author of division
[53:25] sides
[53:27] how did he manage to make sides in
[53:29] heaven
[53:31] think about it
[53:33] you think he can't find fault in this
[53:35] church
[53:38] you think he can't find fault in the
[53:40] life of your brother and then put those
[53:42] thoughts in your head
[53:46] you think he can't find fault with the
[53:48] leadership
[53:49] he found enough fault
[53:52] in God
[53:56] that he turned one-third of the Angels
[53:58] against him
[53:59] no notice it was an actual fault because
[54:01] he's blameless but it was in the way
[54:04] that it was presented
[54:06] to the angels
[54:08] that's why we have to guard our ears
[54:11] that's why we have to guard our hearts
[54:14] we have to guard our tongues we have to
[54:16] guard our attitudes and we must have
[54:19] Grace for our brothers and sisters
[54:22] because what he's going to do is he's
[54:24] going to come in and he's going to
[54:25] magnify their faults in your eyes
[54:29] he's going to magnify my faults in your
[54:33] eyes and if I already if you already got
[54:35] a funny feeling towards me then that
[54:37] fault all of a sudden is going to be
[54:38] some huge thing that others may never
[54:40] notice
[54:42] but he's going to make sure you notice
[54:44] he's going to make sure it gets on your
[54:47] nerves he's going to make sure it
[54:49] bothers you
[54:51] he's gonna magnify that person's flaws
[54:53] he's going to twist their words in your
[54:55] mind
[54:57] and if we allow ourselves to dwell there
[55:00] it's where all we see is their fault and
[55:02] we don't have Grace and we don't have
[55:03] mercy and we don't see him the way Jesus
[55:05] sees them
[55:06] and we allow ourselves to dwell there
[55:08] and we dwell on it then what happens it
[55:11] begins to eat at us
[55:13] it begins to eat at us and it begins to
[55:15] canker and then we lend our mind to it
[55:18] and eventually we lend our tongue to the
[55:20] accuser of the brethren
[55:23] and we begin to speak the words that he
[55:26] would speak if he was standing here in a
[55:28] body
[55:31] think about it
[55:33] who am I to speak words of condemnation
[55:36] over one purchase by the blood of Christ
[55:44] grace and mercy for our brothers and
[55:46] sisters
[55:48] and we start using that tongue to tear
[55:50] down
[55:51] and we start using that tone to create
[55:53] sides
[55:55] do we realize
[55:57] look at look trust me then once again
[55:58] I'm in the same boat I was in last time
[56:00] to where I'm preaching to myself because
[56:01] as I was going through this and looking
[56:03] at these things I thought Lord I've been
[56:04] guilty
[56:06] I've been guilty
[56:09] there's a difference in having a
[56:11] conversation about someone listen if you
[56:12] if you know
[56:14] try to go a whole day without somebody's
[56:15] name coming out of your mouth and that
[56:18] and saying things in a negative slant in
[56:20] a negative tone and saying things in a
[56:22] way that people see your side
[56:27] do we realize how childish it is did you
[56:29] hear
[56:30] it's like it's like you're back on the
[56:32] Elementary playground by the monkey bars
[56:35] did you hear
[56:37] well no no no that's not what happened
[56:38] see I heard it straight from them and
[56:41] what really happened was well what they
[56:43] said well whose side are you on
[56:46] who sorry listen I'm going to tell you
[56:48] right now whose side I'm on I'm taking
[56:49] sides with the word
[56:51] I'm taking sides with Jesus where you
[56:53] don't understand who got offended who
[56:54] got upset you know listen I'll tell you
[56:56] what Jesus will fix it well you don't
[56:58] understand how mad he is about this and
[57:00] how Matt listened Jesus will fix it
[57:01] listen we're trying to over complicate
[57:03] things when I'm telling you is just
[57:05] start putting things in the hand of
[57:06] Jesus quit trying to fix everybody's
[57:08] problems quit getting caught up in
[57:10] everybody's issues and just put it in
[57:11] the hands of Jesus and say Jesus you fix
[57:14] me you fix me I know you can fix them
[57:17] and maybe I need a little bit more
[57:19] fixing myself I'm just gonna put it
[57:21] right here in your hands
[57:23] we don't have to get it all figured out
[57:26] we don't have to come to an agreement on
[57:28] the situation
[57:33] we don't have to come to we don't have
[57:34] to we don't have to get to a point where
[57:36] like okay well I see it your way okay we
[57:38] don't ever got to get to that what we
[57:40] got to do is let it go put it in the
[57:42] hands of Jesus and put our arms around
[57:44] one another and love one another and
[57:47] have Unity regardless of where we stand
[57:52] we have to let it go and focus that's
[57:54] the promise we get focused on
[57:56] individuality instead of focus on our
[57:57] common goal and our and becoming United
[58:00] in our purpose
[58:03] listen Unity isn't about all of us being
[58:05] the same
[58:06] that's not Unity Unity is having the
[58:09] same goals the same purpose under the
[58:12] same headship of the same word it's
[58:15] about laying aside the bickering and the
[58:17] rumors and that he said and the she said
[58:19] it's about forgiveness and letting go
[58:22] and focusing on our common purpose what
[58:24] is our common purpose our common purpose
[58:26] is we're gonna win we're gonna Rapture
[58:30] we're gonna make it out of here despite
[58:32] this little thing that you're going
[58:34] through this week I promise you on
[58:35] Rapture day it will matter nothing it
[58:39] will matter none you won't care who said
[58:41] what to who and who thought this and who
[58:43] thought that you're going to say I made
[58:45] it I would this was my goal this was my
[58:49] purpose this is what it was all about
[58:51] [Applause]
[58:58] all right
[59:00] our goal is to have a body change
[59:04] brother Branham says so why
[59:07] just let them go ahead and let's love
[59:09] one another
[59:11] don't fight one another
[59:13] he says as long as the devil's got you
[59:15] fighting one another he don't have to
[59:17] fight at all
[59:20] he will sit back and has a picnic
[59:22] watching you fight one another and laugh
[59:24] at you
[59:26] professing to have the Holy Ghost
[59:29] and fighting one another
[59:35] now I don't want to read too much into
[59:37] it I'm going to let brother Brown say
[59:38] what brother Brown said
[59:40] but he makes it sound like
[59:43] that you're not going to have the Holy
[59:45] Ghost
[59:46] and be fighting one another
[59:51] laughing
[59:53] at you
[59:54] professing to have the Holy Ghost and
[59:57] fighting one another
[1:00:00] Paul looks at this very thing going on
[1:00:02] and he says you're all a bunch of
[1:00:04] children
[1:00:05] we'll put it in our terms
[1:00:07] he says you're all a bunch of children
[1:00:11] I'll read it the way he said it
[1:00:14] First Corinthians 3 1 and I Brethren
[1:00:16] could not speak unto you as spiritual
[1:00:18] but as under carnal even as unto babes
[1:00:21] in Christ
[1:00:23] I have fed you with milk and not with
[1:00:26] meat for hitherto you were not able to
[1:00:29] Bear it neither yet now are you able in
[1:00:32] other words you hadn't got any better
[1:00:34] this ain't past tense
[1:00:35] you were a baby and you're still a baby
[1:00:40] for ye are yet carnal for whereas there
[1:00:42] is among you envying in strife and
[1:00:44] divisions are ye not carnal
[1:00:47] and walk as men he says I can't even
[1:00:50] speak to you like spiritual people
[1:00:53] but carnal people who worry too much
[1:00:55] after fleshly things too worried about
[1:00:58] who is right and who did what to who
[1:01:02] he says I have to speak to you like
[1:01:05] babies
[1:01:06] I can't even give you meat because you
[1:01:08] can't handle it
[1:01:10] well bless God I'm a mature Christian
[1:01:12] I've been serving God 25 years time
[1:01:15] ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:01:18] it's like I've heard boys say I can't
[1:01:21] wait till I turn 18 I'll be a man I'll
[1:01:22] be man I know a lot of 30 something year
[1:01:24] old folks that ain't men
[1:01:27] it ain't got nothing to do with time or
[1:01:29] how long
[1:01:31] well I'm mature well that means you have
[1:01:33] progressed that means you have grown
[1:01:35] that means you have grown up in the
[1:01:37] faith and you're not acting like a
[1:01:39] little child anymore have you grown up
[1:01:44] are you able to dwell in unity
[1:01:49] are you able to dwell in unity or does
[1:01:51] every little thing that pops up somehow
[1:01:53] stumble you and trip you up
[1:01:56] think about it here I'm just being real
[1:01:58] with this
[1:01:59] do you get caught up in every debate and
[1:02:02] every argument somehow
[1:02:07] you know there's some people that they
[1:02:09] just absolutely love drama
[1:02:11] and my favorite thing that they say is
[1:02:14] drama just seems to find me
[1:02:18] drama ain't never found nobody
[1:02:20] you're a magnet for it because your
[1:02:22] spirit feeds on it and you like it
[1:02:29] because there's some people and you can
[1:02:31] name them they can go their whole life
[1:02:32] and never even know drama is going on
[1:02:34] because they choose not to be in it you
[1:02:37] are in drama because you love it sorry
[1:02:39] that's just the truth whether you like
[1:02:40] it or not
[1:02:41] drama just finds me no
[1:02:44] you got a flashlight and you're hunting
[1:02:46] it
[1:02:52] them's just look I was too many years in
[1:02:54] a public school to know
[1:02:55] is always the same people it didn't
[1:02:59] matter whose problem it was
[1:03:01] somehow you end up in it
[1:03:04] and it ain't cause you're a good
[1:03:05] listener
[1:03:10] it just ain't
[1:03:13] notice Paul calls them babies
[1:03:16] and then he says why they're spiritual
[1:03:19] babies because among you there is
[1:03:21] envying and strife and divisions
[1:03:25] there is a direct correlation between
[1:03:27] unity and maturity in Christ
[1:03:31] you will never find a church torn apart
[1:03:34] by strife and Indians and jealousies all
[1:03:36] the time listen let's not act like
[1:03:38] things don't come
[1:03:39] I don't care what church I don't care
[1:03:40] who you are things come okay
[1:03:42] but if it's a constant thing then that's
[1:03:44] not a mature church if you're constantly
[1:03:47] living in drama constantly and
[1:03:48] backbiting constantly you're not a
[1:03:50] mature person
[1:03:51] you're just not there isn't a maturity
[1:03:53] there but unity and maturity go hand in
[1:03:56] hand
[1:03:58] listen it's important that we get to a
[1:04:00] place that we recognize that maturity is
[1:04:02] important he's not coming back for a
[1:04:04] little childlike bride he's not coming
[1:04:07] back for a bride that's fussing and
[1:04:09] fighting and arguing and bickering and
[1:04:10] caught up and all this he's coming back
[1:04:12] for a mature elect lady he's coming back
[1:04:15] for one who has made herself ready who
[1:04:18] has stepped away from all the immaturity
[1:04:20] and all the baby stuff and all the
[1:04:22] backbiting and all the Strife who has
[1:04:24] stepped away from that and said I no
[1:04:25] longer want a part of that I want to
[1:04:27] dwell in unity with my brothers I want
[1:04:30] to dwell in unity with my sisters and
[1:04:32] I'm going to mature into the place that
[1:04:34] I'm ready to be in that bride
[1:04:38] he doesn't want a little girl to marry
[1:04:42] there's a unity in this bride that can't
[1:04:44] be found in the world
[1:04:46] because she's not of this world she's of
[1:04:48] the kingdom of the Prince of Peace
[1:04:50] and I'm gonna tell you right now listen
[1:04:52] to me Unity is worth fighting for
[1:04:56] Unity is worth fighting for listen we
[1:04:58] have something special here
[1:05:01] I know there's a lot of wonderful
[1:05:02] churches there's a lot of wonderful
[1:05:03] people but this is where I'm at so this
[1:05:05] is who I'm talking to we have something
[1:05:08] very special here
[1:05:10] lovely people beautiful people who love
[1:05:13] the Lord and who love one another and
[1:05:15] like I said I've traveled all over been
[1:05:17] in a lot of great congregations with
[1:05:19] great people and yet I've still never
[1:05:20] found one in my opinion that is as
[1:05:22] closely knit together as this
[1:05:24] congregation I love the way we support
[1:05:26] one another
[1:05:28] I love the way we support each other in
[1:05:30] sickness and in Trials I love the way we
[1:05:33] come together for for young people and
[1:05:35] for their their graduations and for for
[1:05:37] their weddings and for that we support
[1:05:39] our young people I love that I love the
[1:05:42] way you Fellowship I love the way you
[1:05:44] worship
[1:05:45] I love the way you laugh together I love
[1:05:47] the way you cry together there is a
[1:05:49] special Unity here but don't think for a
[1:05:52] minute that the devil is going to allow
[1:05:54] it to go unchecked without coming and
[1:05:56] bringing an attack against it and trying
[1:05:58] to tear it down and tear you apart and I
[1:06:01] say when you see it come in be willing
[1:06:02] to stand up and fight against it and say
[1:06:05] we're going to have Unity we're going to
[1:06:06] have maturity we're going to stand
[1:06:08] together we're going to pray for each
[1:06:10] other we're going to fight for each
[1:06:11] other We're not gonna fall into those
[1:06:14] spiritual baby conditions
[1:06:17] where there's envying and strife and
[1:06:19] Division
[1:06:21] Unity is something worth
[1:06:23] fighting for
[1:06:25] because Unity brings victory
[1:06:28] Unity brings the Holy Spirit
[1:06:30] we dealt with that last time in one mind
[1:06:32] and one Accord that's what caused him to
[1:06:34] come down
[1:06:35] it's worth holding on to because it
[1:06:38] pleases God
[1:06:41] listen again
[1:06:43] to the word of God as he describes the
[1:06:46] importance of unity
[1:06:48] it is like the precious ointment upon
[1:06:51] the head
[1:06:53] he really cares this much about us
[1:06:55] getting along and caring and loving and
[1:06:57] fighting for one another
[1:06:59] that ran down upon the beard even
[1:07:01] Aaron's beard that went down to the
[1:07:03] skirts of his garments as the Dew of
[1:07:05] Herman and as the Dew that descended
[1:07:07] upon the mountains of Zion for there the
[1:07:09] Lord commanded the blessing even life
[1:07:12] forevermore now listen to where brother
[1:07:14] Branham takes and does with this
[1:07:16] he says and to think that you can come
[1:07:18] apart and gather like this
[1:07:20] whereas the psalmist says behold how
[1:07:22] sweet and pleasant for Brethren to dwell
[1:07:24] together in unity it is like the
[1:07:26] anointing goal that was on Aaron's beard
[1:07:28] that ran to the hymns of His Garment
[1:07:29] which that anointing oil which you know
[1:07:33] what the anointing oil done
[1:07:35] it preserved him to go into the presence
[1:07:37] of God
[1:07:40] Unity
[1:07:42] allows us
[1:07:44] to go into the presence of God
[1:07:49] see he had to be Anointed with that old
[1:07:52] before he went into the presence of God
[1:07:54] and when Brethren can dwell together in
[1:07:56] unity it is likened unto that oil
[1:07:59] when we enter into the presence of the
[1:08:01] Lord with that anointing of Brethren
[1:08:03] together in unity oil represents the
[1:08:06] Holy Spirit
[1:08:09] he goes on to say
[1:08:11] no I believe it was said once in the
[1:08:13] Bible
[1:08:14] it's another quote how sweet that
[1:08:16] Brethren to dwell together in unity it's
[1:08:19] like the anointing oil that was on
[1:08:20] Aaron's beard that run to the hands of
[1:08:22] his skirt I think there is nothing any
[1:08:24] more precious
[1:08:26] than to see a unified people
[1:08:30] in the spirit of the Lord to be unity
[1:08:32] all agreeing
[1:08:34] you know I think the 10 days that they
[1:08:36] were waiting for the original first
[1:08:38] outpouring of the Holy Spirit how that
[1:08:40] must have been a unifying time
[1:08:44] of the people all in one heart and one
[1:08:46] according every time now here we go
[1:08:49] why is it worth fighting for every time
[1:08:52] that man gets together like that since
[1:08:55] then the holy spirit always meets with
[1:09:00] them
[1:09:03] don't let the enemy get us separated
[1:09:06] because it's very important that the
[1:09:08] Holy Spirit meet with us
[1:09:10] our very lives depend on it we must have
[1:09:13] the Holy Spirit In Our Lives we must
[1:09:15] have them in our services we must have
[1:09:17] him in our home how we can apply what
[1:09:19] we're talking about to the home there
[1:09:20] needs to be unity in the home you want
[1:09:23] the Holy Spirit to meet it needs to be
[1:09:24] in proper order laid out the way the
[1:09:27] scripture lays a home out to be
[1:09:30] but we must have the Holy Spirit meeting
[1:09:32] with us don't let the devil tear us
[1:09:34] apart don't let him make us focus on our
[1:09:36] differences don't let Division and
[1:09:39] strife begin to come amongst us because
[1:09:41] instead of that coming amongst us I want
[1:09:43] the Holy Spirit to come amongst us that
[1:09:46] is the desire of my heart
[1:09:49] like I said our lives depend on it our
[1:09:51] homes depend on it
[1:09:53] listen who gets hurt the most when
[1:09:55] there's Division and strife in
[1:09:56] backbiting in a church
[1:09:58] listen the old heads ain't going nowhere
[1:10:01] sorry I hold heads
[1:10:04] okay I'll join in with you I'll be an
[1:10:07] old head
[1:10:07] it hurts the youth
[1:10:11] it hurts the young people
[1:10:15] the very lives of our young people
[1:10:17] depend upon the unity of the church that
[1:10:19] would allow the Holy Spirit to come in
[1:10:20] and change their lives and filled them
[1:10:22] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit the
[1:10:25] lives of your children are depending on
[1:10:27] it
[1:10:31] are you saying that there's not going to
[1:10:32] be any anything come up in any
[1:10:34] disagreements come up in the church you
[1:10:35] know better than that they'll probably
[1:10:37] be one by the time we all leave this
[1:10:39] parking lot tonight
[1:10:41] Humanity
[1:10:44] what I'm saying is let's lay those
[1:10:45] things aside and move in the unity of
[1:10:47] the spirit lay that thing aside and move
[1:10:49] in the unity of purpose you lay that
[1:10:52] thing aside and move in the unity of the
[1:10:54] faith and allow that Unity to completely
[1:10:56] dictate it dictate how we act how we
[1:10:58] talk how we think of one another and
[1:11:01] then when we get to that place where
[1:11:02] we're laying things aside and we're
[1:11:04] moving and operating in unity then we
[1:11:06] will have outpourings in these services
[1:11:08] that we can't hardly contain then you
[1:11:10] will have lives changed then you will
[1:11:12] have healings then you'll have people
[1:11:13] set free then you have people so full of
[1:11:16] the Holy Ghost that they get to the
[1:11:17] place like brother Branham said that the
[1:11:19] devil don't even know what to do with
[1:11:21] them Lord let that be me let me get so
[1:11:23] full of the spirit so full of an
[1:11:25] outpouring of the Holy Ghost that he
[1:11:27] don't know what to do with me and not
[1:11:28] just on Church days but on Mondays and
[1:11:31] Tuesdays and Wednesday and Thursday and
[1:11:34] Friday let me dwell in unity with my
[1:11:37] brothers and sisters that I might be
[1:11:39] filled to overflowing
[1:11:46] huh
[1:11:48] you know I coached football for 15 years
[1:11:52] and each team usually had 40 or 50
[1:11:54] players on it
[1:11:57] all those kids from different races
[1:12:01] different homes
[1:12:03] different ideas
[1:12:05] different socioeconomic backgrounds
[1:12:08] some people on the team were friends
[1:12:11] some didn't like each other
[1:12:13] some didn't have many friends
[1:12:15] some were super popular
[1:12:17] sounds like any crowd of people you get
[1:12:19] together
[1:12:22] but none of that ever mattered when we
[1:12:24] stepped on the field
[1:12:26] because we were a team
[1:12:29] because at that point we had one goal
[1:12:33] we didn't care where you were from what
[1:12:35] street you lived on how much money you
[1:12:37] made we cared about you doing your part
[1:12:39] to bring victory
[1:12:41] because we had a goal we had worked too
[1:12:44] hard to lose
[1:12:45] we had cooked too many days in 100
[1:12:47] degree weather in the blistering Sun
[1:12:49] preparing for this moment to worry about
[1:12:52] any of the things that made us different
[1:12:54] think about it for a minute and my big
[1:12:56] thing was I really love the way games
[1:12:58] I love games that were at the other
[1:13:01] team's field
[1:13:03] because I would always tell my players
[1:13:04] in the Huddle I said there is absolutely
[1:13:06] nothing better
[1:13:07] then coming on their field
[1:13:10] and taking it from them
[1:13:12] there's nothing I like better than to
[1:13:13] come to the place that they call home
[1:13:15] that they're comfortable in and
[1:13:17] absolutely ripping Victory from them
[1:13:18] right there and I'll tell you later see
[1:13:20] you don't worry me none listen I ain't
[1:13:22] worried about it no because it may be
[1:13:23] his eating it may be his home field it
[1:13:26] may be where he's comfortable but I'm
[1:13:28] telling you we're gonna win we may be
[1:13:30] the away team this ain't our home field
[1:13:33] but we're coming to win we're coming to
[1:13:35] be victorious we're going to take our
[1:13:37] children and go we're going to take our
[1:13:39] healing and go we're going to take our
[1:13:41] body change and go we're going to take
[1:13:43] our Rapture and go I don't care where we
[1:13:45] fight we'll fight them on land we'll
[1:13:47] fight him on see we'll fight him in the
[1:13:49] air we'll fight him and layer to see ya
[1:13:51] but we're gonna get a victory and we're
[1:13:53] gonna go and we're gonna do it together
[1:13:56] we're gonna come together and I'm gonna
[1:13:58] fight for you and you're going to fight
[1:14:00] for me and we're going to lay aside the
[1:14:03] things that divide us and we're gonna
[1:14:04] win
[1:14:05] hallelujah we're gonna win
[1:14:13] that's what it's all about
[1:14:17] we're going to win
[1:14:19] foreign
[1:14:21] we're going to go to the enemy's camp
[1:14:24] his home field
[1:14:26] we're going to take back our joy
[1:14:29] we're going to take back our peace
[1:14:31] we're going to take back our worship
[1:14:34] we're going to take our rapture
[1:14:36] and there ain't nothing he can do about
[1:14:38] it
[1:14:39] we're going to take it all and we're
[1:14:40] going to go because I say we've come way
[1:14:42] too far to turn back
[1:14:44] we've been working and practicing in the
[1:14:46] fires of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:48] oh yeah we're gold that's been tried in
[1:14:50] the fire and we ain't worried about the
[1:14:51] heat of laodicea We Were Made for This
[1:14:54] we were predestined for this this is the
[1:14:57] moment we've been living for this is the
[1:14:58] moment we've been working for this is
[1:15:00] what he had in his mind before the
[1:15:02] foundation of the world this is what
[1:15:04] it's all about and somebody's going to
[1:15:06] rise to the occasion I ain't scared of
[1:15:09] the moment the moment ain't too big for
[1:15:11] me this is what this my was made for is
[1:15:13] this moment predestined not to fall
[1:15:16] that's who you are
[1:15:19] hope we could ever get that in our head
[1:15:20] hey look as a coach one of the biggest
[1:15:22] things I had to do was make them believe
[1:15:24] they were going to win
[1:15:25] make them believe they were the better
[1:15:27] team because when you believe you're the
[1:15:29] better team You'll Play like the better
[1:15:30] team and when you realize you're the one
[1:15:32] going to win you're the one going to
[1:15:34] Rapture you'll live like somebody that's
[1:15:36] gonna Rapture you'll live like an
[1:15:37] overcomer you'll live with the devil
[1:15:39] under your feet you'll live with a
[1:15:41] worship coming out of your life you will
[1:15:43] live like one who knows I'm gonna win
[1:15:46] and there's nothing he can do to stop me
[1:15:48] what's there to be depressed about
[1:15:50] what's there to be down about today the
[1:15:53] prison doors are open you're the winner
[1:15:55] walk out claim it take it and walk and
[1:15:58] live and talk in unity
[1:16:02] in Victory
[1:16:04] with the purpose laid before you
[1:16:07] that we've come
[1:16:08] too far to let pettiness and strife
[1:16:11] derail us
[1:16:14] moving on to Ephesians 4 1.
[1:16:17] it says I therefore the prisoner of the
[1:16:19] Lord
[1:16:20] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:16:22] vocation we're with you are called
[1:16:25] with all loneliness and meekness and
[1:16:27] long-suffering forbearing one another in
[1:16:29] love
[1:16:31] endeavoring
[1:16:34] to keep the unity
[1:16:36] of the spirit in the bond of peace
[1:16:39] there is one body in one Spirit even as
[1:16:41] you're called in one hope of your
[1:16:43] calling one Lord One Faith one baptism
[1:16:48] one God and Father of all who is above
[1:16:50] all and through all
[1:16:52] and in you all
[1:16:55] he identifies this Unity here as the
[1:16:57] unity of the spirit
[1:16:59] and he tells us that we're going to have
[1:17:01] to Endeavor to keep it
[1:17:05] Endeavor here means to be diligent
[1:17:08] to exert oneself
[1:17:11] to do your utmost
[1:17:14] which tells me it's going to be attacked
[1:17:17] there's going to be someone trying to
[1:17:19] take that Unity away from us
[1:17:22] he's going to come against it there's
[1:17:23] going to be occasion
[1:17:25] now here's the kind of fighting we got
[1:17:26] to do because think about it there's
[1:17:27] going to be occasion where you get done
[1:17:29] wrong
[1:17:31] and you want to lash out
[1:17:35] I'm sorry but that is not endeavoring to
[1:17:38] keep the unity
[1:17:40] that's the moment where you have to
[1:17:42] Endeavor
[1:17:43] but they did me wrong I know
[1:17:46] now you have to Endeavor
[1:17:49] keep the unity
[1:17:52] there's moments where you're going to
[1:17:53] want your side of the story told
[1:17:57] but you've got to Endeavor
[1:18:00] to keep the you the minute you start
[1:18:02] telling your side their sides
[1:18:08] Endeavor to keep the unity
[1:18:11] because somebody's going to do you wrong
[1:18:14] I promise
[1:18:18] people are going to do you wrong
[1:18:20] and he says here to Endeavor to keep the
[1:18:24] unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace
[1:18:27] notice what Unity does it creates a bond
[1:18:30] of peace and a bond here talks about
[1:18:33] something that's not easily broken
[1:18:35] something that can't just be swept away
[1:18:37] or torn away or ripped apart not easily
[1:18:39] destroyed it's bonded together working
[1:18:41] together as a unit
[1:18:44] the root your word of unity
[1:18:47] one Lord One Faith one baptism if you go
[1:18:50] further down in the chapter it says then
[1:18:52] he gave some Apostles and some prophets
[1:18:54] and some evangelists and some pastors
[1:18:55] and some teachers that alone will preach
[1:18:58] but that's not where we're at tonight
[1:19:00] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:19:02] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:19:04] the body of Christ till we all come in
[1:19:07] the unity
[1:19:09] of the faith
[1:19:12] now notice this
[1:19:13] back in Corinthians what did he do he
[1:19:15] tied Unity
[1:19:18] with maturity
[1:19:20] follow along in this and of the
[1:19:21] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:19:23] perfect man under the measure of the
[1:19:24] stature the fullness of Christ that we
[1:19:26] henceforth be no more children
[1:19:29] right back to that
[1:19:34] toss to and fro carried about with every
[1:19:37] wind of Doctrine by the slight of men
[1:19:38] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:19:41] in wait
[1:19:43] to deceive
[1:19:45] a couple things here
[1:19:47] once again we already saw already
[1:19:49] pointed out there about the maturity and
[1:19:51] when we come to Unity it says then we
[1:19:54] henceforth be no more children
[1:19:57] in other words what's happened is we
[1:19:59] have matured enough
[1:20:01] that we can lay down what we think is
[1:20:04] best
[1:20:05] you're no longer a child it's about
[1:20:07] Unity but a child likes to fuss if he
[1:20:10] don't get his toy a child likes to kick
[1:20:12] and scream if he get a child don't like
[1:20:14] what you cook for supper they throw a
[1:20:15] little fit
[1:20:16] that's the actions of a child because
[1:20:18] they're worried about what they want but
[1:20:21] what he's saying here is you've matured
[1:20:22] to a point of unity to where you lay
[1:20:24] down your thinking you've matured enough
[1:20:26] to let go of your ideas and the way that
[1:20:29] you think it should be and our Focus
[1:20:30] isn't selfish anymore
[1:20:34] but now our focus is the faith
[1:20:37] the cause the reason
[1:20:40] the goal
[1:20:41] notice just like when in the book of
[1:20:43] Jude when he's telling you to contend
[1:20:45] here he he referenced it as the faith
[1:20:48] it's the unity of the faith
[1:20:51] so it's very specific what I'm preaching
[1:20:53] you tonight this isn't some economical
[1:20:55] message about hippie love and how we
[1:20:57] gotta you know be in unity with
[1:21:00] everybody and and be in unity with
[1:21:02] everybody and everything this is a very
[1:21:04] specific Unity
[1:21:06] it's a Unity among brethren in the faith
[1:21:12] Unity amongst those fighting the same
[1:21:15] fight and standing for the same faith
[1:21:18] that was once delivered to the Saints
[1:21:20] amen this isn't about agreeing with
[1:21:23] everyone
[1:21:24] it's about not fighting against those
[1:21:27] who are on your side
[1:21:30] there's plenty others
[1:21:32] and we shouldn't be fighting with
[1:21:33] anybody I'm just saying though
[1:21:35] there's plenty of people
[1:21:37] to disagree with and strive with and
[1:21:40] what why do it with the ones that's
[1:21:42] fighting with you
[1:21:45] why do it against the ones that's on
[1:21:46] your side
[1:21:48] and that's the unity we're talking about
[1:21:50] here we're not to be in unity with
[1:21:52] everyone and everything
[1:21:54] brother Brown tells us he says it's the
[1:21:56] same thing today separating separated
[1:21:58] found them they were not in unity they
[1:22:00] couldn't have no Unity cannot have Unity
[1:22:03] with day
[1:22:04] can a Believer have Unity within with an
[1:22:06] Infidel can a man who believes in all
[1:22:09] the word of God
[1:22:10] pay attention to this
[1:22:13] have Unity with them who just believes
[1:22:15] part of the word of God
[1:22:18] wants separators
[1:22:21] so when we're talking about Unity it's
[1:22:23] not Unity with everyone and everything
[1:22:24] it's Unity with the Brethren and the
[1:22:26] sisters of the faith
[1:22:29] those who are striving and fighting for
[1:22:31] the same thing we're not to sacrifice
[1:22:33] truth and standards for the sake of
[1:22:36] unity
[1:22:38] let that sink in we're not sacrificing
[1:22:40] truth we're not sacrificing standards
[1:22:43] for the sake of getting along that is an
[1:22:45] EC communical spirit
[1:22:48] brother Branham says and that's exactly
[1:22:50] the way old mother Jezebel has done the
[1:22:51] Protestant church has cropped in and now
[1:22:54] they're compromising on a few little
[1:22:56] doctrines they said they have so they
[1:22:58] can have Unity over the world and the
[1:23:01] first place the church got her locks
[1:23:03] bobbed off was at nicaea and she's going
[1:23:05] to Bob them again since she's been here
[1:23:07] that's her Secret
[1:23:10] is the word
[1:23:11] notice brother branham's talking about
[1:23:13] the word is our secret when he's doing
[1:23:15] he's tying this back into Samson
[1:23:17] and he's talking about how he was
[1:23:19] willing to give up his secret but in so
[1:23:22] doing his power was stripped away from
[1:23:24] him
[1:23:25] so tying this back in with the church
[1:23:27] and with Samson listen we're not giving
[1:23:29] up our secret
[1:23:31] this ain't about giving up on the word
[1:23:33] the the Lord went to great and Extreme
[1:23:35] Measures in this day to bring about the
[1:23:37] promise of restoration to make sure the
[1:23:39] word was completely restored and how
[1:23:41] dare us back off even a little for the
[1:23:43] sake of Fellowship
[1:23:46] I believe in fellowship and I believe in
[1:23:48] fellowship and even with those who don't
[1:23:49] see it exactly the way you do but that
[1:23:52] don't mean you back off your standards
[1:23:54] and back off the revealed word of the
[1:23:55] hour in order to do so
[1:23:59] we're not giving up our secret we're not
[1:24:01] giving up the word we're not backing off
[1:24:03] What the Lord Has Done in this day this
[1:24:05] isn't about that this is about letting
[1:24:07] go of personal opinions
[1:24:10] letting go of those little odd feelings
[1:24:13] that we have towards certain people
[1:24:16] putting our arms around our brother and
[1:24:18] repenting because of the hurt that we
[1:24:20] caused
[1:24:24] it's not easy
[1:24:26] and then giving forgiveness to those who
[1:24:28] have hurt us
[1:24:30] it's about being able to Fellowship even
[1:24:32] if we don't see eye to eye
[1:24:34] moving beyond wounds of the past
[1:24:37] staying the course why for the sake of
[1:24:40] the Gospel staying in unity for the sake
[1:24:42] of the moving of the spirit staying in
[1:24:45] unity so that God can have his way in
[1:24:47] our services listen we may be different
[1:24:49] we may have different ideas we may all
[1:24:52] come from different backgrounds
[1:24:54] but if we're holding the standard of the
[1:24:56] Gospel
[1:24:58] and if you're holding the standard of
[1:25:00] the new birth and we're both standing
[1:25:02] there fighting and striving for the
[1:25:04] Rapture then let's lay aside our
[1:25:06] differences and work together in unity
[1:25:09] for the common good for the common cause
[1:25:11] that God can move an evening light
[1:25:13] Tabernacle the way that he wants to move
[1:25:16] to where the breaks are off to where
[1:25:18] there's no spiritual fire extinguishers
[1:25:20] there's no little funny feeling come
[1:25:22] from a certain section going to another
[1:25:24] section
[1:25:25] listen you don't think it matters I was
[1:25:27] listening to brother Brown today and he
[1:25:28] says there's one person I don't know how
[1:25:30] big the crowd was he said but there's
[1:25:32] one person in here unbelieving
[1:25:35] he said I've discerned it and it's
[1:25:37] making it so very hard
[1:25:45] one person
[1:25:48] and it's making it so very he said
[1:25:50] brother won't you just help us
[1:25:53] he said you'd be better to support and
[1:25:56] quit hindering
[1:26:01] Unity matters
[1:26:05] Unity matters
[1:26:08] he says the Holy Ghost will follow God's
[1:26:10] word to the letter and a preacher behind
[1:26:12] the pulpit that ain't got Grace enough
[1:26:13] to preach it I doubt he's got it
[1:26:17] it's another one for another day
[1:26:19] he said that's just exactly well that's
[1:26:22] what the Holy Ghost is for is to give
[1:26:24] option to the preacher is to give
[1:26:26] Holiness to the group is to set the
[1:26:28] church in order is to bring a Unity of
[1:26:30] spirit
[1:26:31] is to unite us together with power is to
[1:26:35] unite us together with love brotherly
[1:26:39] love
[1:26:41] now I want to try to move quickly here
[1:26:43] as we're running out of time because
[1:26:44] what we know is brother Branham deals
[1:26:46] with this extensively and I'm going to
[1:26:47] skip some of the quotes but that the
[1:26:49] early church was United in spirit
[1:26:52] it was United in power and it was United
[1:26:56] in brotherly love
[1:26:57] and then what happened and we know this
[1:26:59] if you've read the church age book and
[1:27:01] the scriptures that the Palm or worm and
[1:27:03] then the locus and the canker worm and
[1:27:04] the caterpillar it began to destroy that
[1:27:06] early church and it began to Rob and
[1:27:09] steal from him the victory that the
[1:27:11] early church had and one of the things
[1:27:14] that they lost was Unity
[1:27:17] brother Branham says now the next great
[1:27:19] thing that come up was the Locust and he
[1:27:22] was the one who was to destroy the unity
[1:27:24] of the Believers in the Bible there were
[1:27:27] in Pentecost there was a unity and these
[1:27:30] people were with one heart and with one
[1:27:32] Accord and Paul said I believe in Romans
[1:27:33] the seventh chapter there was nothing
[1:27:35] could separate us
[1:27:37] from of the love of God that's in Christ
[1:27:40] Jesus there was nothing he said we've
[1:27:44] let the whole Palmer word come along
[1:27:46] with his stinger and break down
[1:27:47] Brotherhood break down Unity amongst us
[1:27:50] Paul said in the Bible that he wanted us
[1:27:52] to all speak the same thing he wanted us
[1:27:56] to be in unity
[1:27:59] that early church fought together they
[1:28:02] stood together they died together
[1:28:05] and because they had that Unity the
[1:28:06] power of God moved amongst them
[1:28:09] you see Time After Time God pouring his
[1:28:11] spirits out the gifts operating they was
[1:28:14] in a Brotherhood
[1:28:15] nothing he says nothing could separate
[1:28:18] them but then that Locus came and it
[1:28:20] began to take away the unity and then
[1:28:22] what happened was is a system of man
[1:28:25] with a forced Unity was put in its place
[1:28:29] and it wasn't a Unity of the spirit but
[1:28:32] it was a Unity led by man it was a
[1:28:34] man-made Unity you have to join this
[1:28:36] church or else you have to be baptized
[1:28:39] this way or else and what it did was it
[1:28:41] broke up the Brotherhood into different
[1:28:43] organizations
[1:28:45] and it broke up the unity and it was a
[1:28:47] spirit of denomination which separates
[1:28:51] and brother Branham says watch when it
[1:28:53] comes to The Showdown at the end time
[1:28:55] look at the weakness of it now 900 and
[1:28:58] something different organizations one
[1:29:00] pulling away and one the other there is
[1:29:02] no Unity among them and they're trying
[1:29:04] to bring Unity but here's the key not
[1:29:07] backed by the word of God
[1:29:10] God's original plan they are taking it
[1:29:13] in by politics
[1:29:15] and by organization and the devil brings
[1:29:18] a reason and he's like well surely if
[1:29:19] we're all you don't God want Unity don't
[1:29:21] God want us all together and surely if
[1:29:23] we're all together then then God's in it
[1:29:25] so maybe we should back off preaching
[1:29:27] some of those things so harshly maybe we
[1:29:29] should back off preaching some of those
[1:29:30] things that offend a little bit and
[1:29:32] maybe we should do it and just say it in
[1:29:33] a nicer way you know for the sake of
[1:29:35] unity and for the sake of Brotherhood
[1:29:36] that's true God does want Unity but he
[1:29:39] wants Unity under his word he wants
[1:29:42] Unity under the headship of his holy
[1:29:45] spirit he don't want worship to some
[1:29:46] denominational church he wants worship
[1:29:49] unto himself and we are united through
[1:29:52] the word and we are united by the word
[1:29:54] and you're United with everyone that
[1:29:57] stands for the fullness of that word
[1:29:59] that is where our Unity lies
[1:30:02] we are united today that Jesus Christ is
[1:30:05] the same yesterday today and forever we
[1:30:07] are united today that he still heals we
[1:30:09] are united today that he still fills
[1:30:11] with the Holy Ghost we are united today
[1:30:13] that this message is the truth there is
[1:30:15] unity in that unite underneath this
[1:30:18] glorious message if you have nothing
[1:30:20] else in common but this message it ought
[1:30:23] to be enough for us to unite under and
[1:30:25] fellowship under and live in unity under
[1:30:28] if that's all we have in common
[1:30:32] all right
[1:30:33] and that's what we've got to get our
[1:30:34] Focus back on tonight
[1:30:37] because the word was restored in this
[1:30:39] day to prepare a bride to take a rapture
[1:30:42] and the word called my name
[1:30:45] and the word called your name
[1:30:47] and because of that
[1:30:49] we should have unity in the faith listen
[1:30:52] we will never achieve Unity of opinion
[1:30:58] we will never achieve Unity of the
[1:31:00] thermostat in the sanctuary
[1:31:05] what happened
[1:31:07] we'll never achieve Unity of how it
[1:31:09] should sound
[1:31:10] we'll never achieve Unity of of who I
[1:31:12] think should be in charge and who should
[1:31:14] be running this and who should be
[1:31:15] running that and guess what
[1:31:17] that's okay
[1:31:19] we don't have to be in unity in that as
[1:31:22] long as we don't allow those things to
[1:31:24] become our focus and begin to worm its
[1:31:26] way in and tear us apart over things
[1:31:29] that do not matter
[1:31:31] what we have to be in unity is is our
[1:31:33] common goal we're going to win we're
[1:31:36] going to Rapture I'm going to be there
[1:31:38] in my Offspring with me I'm not leaving
[1:31:40] a hoof behind I'm not leaving a promise
[1:31:42] unclaimed I'm walking underneath this
[1:31:44] message and it's going to take me all
[1:31:45] the way and that's what we have to be
[1:31:47] United underneath it stay United in the
[1:31:49] faith stay United in the spirit that was
[1:31:52] part of the restoration of the broad
[1:31:54] tree that was part of it because that
[1:31:56] was part that had been stole and when he
[1:31:58] sends Malachi 4 brother Brandon actually
[1:31:59] says it here I believe I have the quote
[1:32:01] he makes this statement I won't read the
[1:32:03] whole thing he says if you believe that
[1:32:04] I've told you the truth and the truth is
[1:32:06] in the Bible that Jesus is the son of
[1:32:07] God and he sent me just his servant to
[1:32:10] help bring the Church of the Living God
[1:32:12] together in unity
[1:32:15] he sent Malachi 4 to bring a Unity to
[1:32:19] the church
[1:32:21] I wonder if he looked at the church
[1:32:23] right now if he would say oh I was
[1:32:25] successful in that
[1:32:30] I hope
[1:32:34] but are we letting too many things
[1:32:35] hinder to me things that don't matter
[1:32:38] too many things come in that would Rob
[1:32:39] away our unity and steal away listen I
[1:32:41] say let's fight for it
[1:32:43] I say let's contend for it make it a
[1:32:45] matter of importance that that devil is
[1:32:47] not going to come in and Rob this church
[1:32:49] of its Unity the first church had unity
[1:32:52] and the results speak for themselves
[1:32:55] I want First Church Unity with First
[1:32:57] Church results I want First Church Unity
[1:33:00] with licks of Fire coming down on each
[1:33:02] and every one of us I want First Church
[1:33:04] Unity with me being able to tell people
[1:33:06] Silver and Gold Have I None but that
[1:33:08] which I have I give you in the name of
[1:33:10] Jesus rise up and walk I want First
[1:33:12] Church Unity where we can lay our hands
[1:33:14] on someone as they receive the Holy
[1:33:16] Ghost and the place will be shaken and
[1:33:18] the walls will be shaken I want that
[1:33:20] kind of unity and then that Unity comes
[1:33:23] power
[1:33:26] in the unity and what about the unity of
[1:33:28] expectations
[1:33:31] what about that what about the unity of
[1:33:33] expectation and we are closing
[1:33:35] but do you think that those amazing
[1:33:37] meetings that we just had this weekend
[1:33:38] just happened by accident
[1:33:40] do you think there's a re what is the
[1:33:42] reason that they're different from any
[1:33:44] other night
[1:33:46] by the way you've been a lovely audience
[1:33:47] so I'm not hitting you over the head
[1:33:49] with this
[1:33:50] you've been awesome I'm just talking
[1:33:51] what's different between that and a
[1:33:53] Wednesday night
[1:33:55] the unity of expectation
[1:33:57] because I would bet there's a I don't
[1:33:59] bet sorry
[1:34:00] um I would venture to say
[1:34:02] per Adventure
[1:34:05] I would venture to say that not many of
[1:34:07] you gave too much thought to today's
[1:34:09] service until today
[1:34:15] I don't know I'm not trying to pick on
[1:34:16] you I'm being I've been there how many
[1:34:18] of you prayed for Wednesday night
[1:34:19] service on Monday
[1:34:25] but guess what happens at meetings like
[1:34:27] this went on and even the meetings we'll
[1:34:28] have in October we'll start thinking
[1:34:30] about about three weeks ahead of time
[1:34:31] we'll take vacation time for it we'll
[1:34:33] set time aside we'll think about the
[1:34:35] Ministries and we'll pray for the
[1:34:37] ministry we'll pray for the services
[1:34:38] we'll have a special need on our heart
[1:34:40] and we'll think this is going I need
[1:34:42] this gun I'm coming expecting this and
[1:34:43] you want brother Brown even says there's
[1:34:45] a reason that the last night of the
[1:34:47] meeting has greater results is because
[1:34:49] people have greater expectation because
[1:34:50] they're in Greater desperation because
[1:34:52] they know it's their last chance
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:34:54] what if we came on on Wednesday night
[1:34:56] going this could be my last chance this
[1:34:58] could be my last opportunity this is
[1:35:00] where I gotta get it what if we came
[1:35:02] with that expectation how do I believe
[1:35:05] hell would Shake tonight I believe the
[1:35:07] heavens would open tonight I believe he
[1:35:09] would pour it out tonight just like you
[1:35:11] did all weekend because the people came
[1:35:13] expecting
[1:35:15] there was a Unity of expectation do we
[1:35:18] think it's just an accident that
[1:35:20] preachers come out during a meeting and
[1:35:22] preach the best Services ever
[1:35:25] no it's the unity of expectation pouring
[1:35:27] it out of them and it pulls them to that
[1:35:29] level and it goes to another place it's
[1:35:31] the round that we can walk in every
[1:35:33] service
[1:35:36] oh somebody didn't think so I say why
[1:35:38] not
[1:35:41] why not
[1:35:43] what hinders
[1:35:44] it's a day on a calendar
[1:35:48] Unity of expectation brings results
[1:35:52] they went about in the book of Acts
[1:35:54] expecting for miracles to happen
[1:35:55] expecting for God to show up expecting
[1:35:58] for the Holy Ghost to fall and they go
[1:36:00] to places like Ohio and Dry Creek and
[1:36:02] here in October expecting that let's
[1:36:03] start expecting it on Wednesday and on
[1:36:06] Sunday and come and go on God I'm here
[1:36:08] United my expectations are right I need
[1:36:11] you tonight I need you to touch my life
[1:36:13] I need a healing you heal on Wednesdays
[1:36:16] I need a Deliverance you deliver on
[1:36:18] Wednesdays I need you to pour it out in
[1:36:20] my family tonight and you pour it out on
[1:36:23] Wednesdays let the unity of expectations
[1:36:26] rise to the level that it pulls him out
[1:36:29] of the heavens right down into the midst
[1:36:31] of the congregation
[1:36:33] let it raise up in a Unity
[1:36:40] you can stay standing musicians you can
[1:36:42] come
[1:36:45] I'm a finish while you're standing it
[1:36:46] makes you feel better
[1:36:55] Satan knows the power of unity
[1:36:58] and he knows
[1:37:00] what hindering one person can do
[1:37:02] that's why he fights so hard in your
[1:37:04] life leading up to meetings
[1:37:07] fights you hard on Wednesdays Wednesdays
[1:37:09] be your worst work day ever
[1:37:14] some days why is it why I'm gonna talk
[1:37:17] to him why am I so tired on Sunday
[1:37:18] mornings
[1:37:21] Church down to 11.
[1:37:25] I'll be like is the Sun up
[1:37:27] well it's like it's 8 30.
[1:37:30] some days I'm tighter than any other day
[1:37:33] why
[1:37:34] because you're lazy no
[1:37:37] no I caught that thought enough
[1:37:41] because he's fighting
[1:37:44] because he's fighting
[1:37:46] brother Branham says I'm gonna skip
[1:37:48] ahead and let you read this here it is I
[1:37:49] didn't have to skip ahead there it was
[1:37:51] do you know where there's disunity
[1:37:54] the spirit of God is not welcome
[1:38:00] Lord have I been guilty of creating
[1:38:02] disunity
[1:38:04] Lord I don't want to hinder
[1:38:07] Lord I want to be in unity
[1:38:10] he says this
[1:38:14] and I'll let this be the last one
[1:38:15] there's more but I'm gonna let this be
[1:38:16] the last one let it settle in
[1:38:18] he says but however they must be in a
[1:38:20] spiritual attitude
[1:38:22] for God worships where there is unity
[1:38:23] and spirit
[1:38:25] God will come to us this morning and
[1:38:27] he'll spare the life of this little
[1:38:28] darling girl
[1:38:31] and the many of you here who are perhaps
[1:38:33] dying with cancer with other diseases if
[1:38:39] we can only get in spiritual Unity
[1:38:43] with his word and with him
[1:38:46] God will reveal himself
[1:38:49] he always does
[1:38:51] think about the weight of that
[1:38:54] God will heal this person heal all these
[1:38:56] people
[1:38:57] if
[1:38:59] wow
[1:39:01] we can get into a spiritual Unity with
[1:39:03] his word
[1:39:04] he will come and reveal himself
[1:39:07] he always does
[1:39:12] prophet of God said that we're to be the
[1:39:14] final voice to the final age
[1:39:18] which means it's not going to be the
[1:39:20] final voices
[1:39:24] there's going to be a Unity
[1:39:27] it's going to be one voice
[1:39:30] what is your voice crying out
[1:39:34] I say let's lend our voices
[1:39:37] to the resurrection
[1:39:40] let's lend our voice that he's a living
[1:39:42] God
[1:39:44] listen to our voice that he's the same
[1:39:45] yesterday today and forever
[1:39:48] let's lend our voice that he's the Lord
[1:39:50] God that heals all our diseases
[1:39:53] let's lend our voice that we're two or
[1:39:55] three are gathered
[1:39:56] in my name I'll be there
[1:39:59] let's lend our voice to Unity
[1:40:02] let's lend our voice to Harmony
[1:40:05] and not lend our voice to the accuser of
[1:40:07] the brethren
[1:40:09] because I believe that through the word
[1:40:11] we've seen that in unity there's power
[1:40:14] in unity God moves
[1:40:17] so whatever I have Lord me
[1:40:21] whatever I have
[1:40:23] that would hinder Unity whatever
[1:40:25] feelings I have Lord
[1:40:27] I want to lay those aside
[1:40:31] I don't want to have a personal agenda
[1:40:34] listen we're not in unity if even in
[1:40:36] like Tabernacle is spreading our own
[1:40:39] agenda we're not in unity with the rest
[1:40:40] of the broad body
[1:40:42] what is our agenda
[1:40:44] to lift up the name of Jesus
[1:40:47] to lift up that there has been a message
[1:40:49] in this last day
[1:40:51] and that message broke through the
[1:40:52] darkness and tore through the darkness
[1:40:54] and it found Seeds of Life
[1:40:56] and now we have a purpose we can unite
[1:40:58] under Lord let that light keep shining
[1:41:00] Lord let that light go out and find more
[1:41:02] seeds let that light go out and get my
[1:41:04] children let that light go out and get
[1:41:06] my family let that light go out and
[1:41:08] dermatize more and germatize more and
[1:41:10] germatize more and let me be in unity
[1:41:13] until that light strikes the last seed
[1:41:16] and then that morning in unity we'll
[1:41:18] take a body change and unity will be
[1:41:21] gathered together in unity will praise
[1:41:23] the King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[1:41:26] through all eternity
[1:41:29] I say let's be in unity now
[1:41:31] so that we can be United then
[1:41:34] father we love you with all of our
[1:41:36] hearts
[1:41:37] Lord we thank you for the word that's so
[1:41:38] plain and so clear
[1:41:40] Lord we ask that you'll take anything
[1:41:41] out of our life that would hinder the
[1:41:43] Lord your move that would hinder you
[1:41:45] dealing with lives dealing with hearts
[1:41:47] Healing The Sick Lord anything in our
[1:41:49] life that would Hinder
[1:41:51] Lord let our life speak of unity let our
[1:41:54] lives speak of brother to Brotherly Love
[1:41:56] let our life speak of mercy and Grace
[1:41:58] for all those around us
[1:42:00] let us lay aside our personal feelings
[1:42:03] and Lord let us be United with you Lord
[1:42:05] in a perfect harmony and perfect Unity
[1:42:08] Lord I Thank you for this wonderful
[1:42:10] church this wonderful congregation and
