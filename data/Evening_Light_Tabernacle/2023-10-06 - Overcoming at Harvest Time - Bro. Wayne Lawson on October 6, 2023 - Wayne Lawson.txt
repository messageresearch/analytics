your all the way up there and brother Timothy and Andrew didn't they do a good job my goodness amen that was phenomenal amen I was so blessed you know I could on that power side and amen so it's really good I seen brother Jonathan sitting up here up front her cousin brother Jonathan Siler God bless you and amen and uh it's such an honor to see him here in the meetings tonight we uh have a few things upon our heart and we would like to if we could just before we read the word let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer and let's just speak to him just a moment and I I don't want to get in Tradition but if it's all right with you I'm going to ask you to help me pray tonight and just reach over maybe and put your hand on someone there and pray with them and maybe it's been a day or two since they've had somebody pray for them and I just want you to thank just for a moment and and just put your heart for that person next to you tonight father lord it's in your word that even in March 16 the Great Commission that you said they would lay hand one on the other and father as your great Saints Lord the children of the Living God lord as they lay their hands one on the other tonight Lord we reach out into the Supernatural and we invite you to this platform Lord we ask you for your mercy oh God lord Jesus before the people before Lord the world we acknowledge that we have nothing Lord that we could do or say but Lord Jesus we ask you to come tonight and take this meeting Lord and use it for your glory father as we humble our hearts before you we ask you for the supernatural land Lord that you would come in the midst of us Lord and that you would wipe away Lord the oppression of the spirit Lord that you would speak to the need of the heart and the souls Lord that need to touch from you tonight Lord we're asking you as we lay hands one on the other as we pray one for another Lord may it be like it was in the book of Acts Lord Lord when you come down and Lord clo in tongues of fire set upon each of them we invite you Lord in your full Glory tonight we don't just invite you here for theology or for Doctrine Lord but we invite you for the supernatural promises to make Supernatural manifestations Among Us oh God we invite you Lord in all of your glory and all your power Lord to come among us tonight and to bless your children Lord now father we take these few moments in your word we commit them into thy faithful hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles let's turn into the word of the Lord and I want to look at Revelations the 3r chapter and the 21st verse Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 and we'll also look in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 18-22 Revelations 3 and 21 I know to you that study uh the message this is a very familiar scripture to you um to him that overcometh now brother brandham said that's individuals that's right to him that overcometh well I grant to set with me in my throne now you watch that in my Throne on not on my Throne because in Revelations the 20th chapter there's Throne set up in the Millennium and you set on a throne but here in this scripture you're sitting in a throne and brother Bram said it's you're sharing Dominion even as I also overcame and him sat down with my father in his throne now let's read Ephesians 1: 18-22 you're going to read a similar text but it's going to read just a little different the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints so it's not just your inheritance it's his inheritance how many know the Lord's portion is his people the Lord's portion is his people and his what is the riches of Glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usw who believe according to the working of this Mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places far above principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also and that which is to come and Heath put all things somebody say all things Heath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated tonight I want to take for a text here and I want to I want to just speak to you a little bit tonight on overcoming at Harvest Time overcoming at Harvest Time you know uh I certainly believe we're at Harvest Time don't you amen I believe it's a time of overcoming I want to read to you from Matthew the 19th Chapter the 28th and the 30th verse and Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall set in the Throne of his glory you shall also set upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone that have forsaken houses or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a h hundredfold and shall inherit Everlasting lifej isn't that amazing amen for everyone that have forsaken now just uh I just had just spoke to our church a little bit there at home on Sunday and read this spe specific scripture to them uh it was it was odd because after uh the first weekend of October uh was marking 10 years of me being in bluon Ohio with brother Ericson and the true word Tabernacle there uh that and I remember it was the first weekend of October of 2013 brother Ron Spencer was there holding meetings for the first weekend that we were there you remember that it was been a long time he asked me if I had my passport because I was coming up from Arkansas to Ohio and uh amen and uh I kind of laughed I thought well it is a different country that's for sure and uh but uh but it's been 10 years ago and then of course this in this January some of you know maybe some of you don't know but in January um brother Erikson and I had made some decisions to go ahead and and move forward with uh a transitioning to pastorship and I was voted in to be the pastor there at True Word in the middle of January of this year and uh I I do want to say that it is a great honor Amen to uh to be received in such a level and for brother Erikson to Amen to to respectfully begin to pass the Baton amen I know that uh in the message sometimes it seems like that some of the Elder Brothers uh they they just don't never give up you know as far as as pastoring and they and they just hold it and hold it and hold it and hold it and hold it and hold it and and uh but brother Erikson being a gentleman and looking at the church and saying brother Wayne and we're going to go further so we want you to step up at this time and and I tell you my hats are off and my respect to our brother Ericson and he's going to remain there with us of course as a as a senior pastor and he's a Founder so he'll be with us as long as he can he can stay with us we we trust that God will give us many years together and the strength of him and we appreciate it I'll tell you uh and and what made this amazing to me is because when I read this scripture uh this is a scripture that brother Ericson read over me 10 years ago when I moved to Ohio and um he read that he said brother Wayne he said I believe God gave me this scripture to read to you because if uh if anyone ever left all they knew I certainly did that when I moved from Arkansas to Ohio away from my family and my home and everything that I knew but God said he would restore and when I went there my kids were just young and and they were they were just young children they were uh from 10year old to 16 and it was scary uh you know what how's my kids going to react and how they going to do and how they going to root down and and you know and those things uh happen and then but 10 years ago this happened and then this last weekend marked 10 years and I was sitting there preaching to the church and and the Lord has moved me up into the into the realm of leadership and I was sitting there looking over the congregation and there sit my son Zachariah who met a beautiful beautiful girl a good Christian message girl Anna and the Lord you all know the vision the lord gave brother Ron and and the Lord blessed us with that first grand baby and eie and then along June I actually had two more grandsons Bethany had a a son and then uh an and Zach had the second son and then I looked over there and there's Isaac and Bethany and then Mariah and Brian were sitting there and the Lord's gave me uh just recently uh I don't know probably everybody knows this but just recently the Lord has called Brian into the ministry and so the Lord has given me two son-in-laws called into the ministry he's given me Zachariah in love with the Lord and serving the lord and moving in his mercy and you know and when you stand back and you look at 10 years and you see that when you walked away from everything you knew but then to see the hand of God come upon it and reward it and bless it and you know uh when when things now I'm I'm I'm I'm speaking to you because there's sometimes in your life when you go to looking at things and you think how is this going to work out and how's this going to be but listen if you're seeking the kingdom of God Beyond everything else any man or woman that leaves their houses and their families and their and their lives and they give everything to Jesus Christ he said I'd pay you back a h hundredfold and I am here today as a witness to you that no man has given anything to God that God does not repaid him a h hundredfold God will not be in debt to no man God will not be in debt to any woman you're never going to outgive God amen and when you give to God he gives back to you and you know God God sometimes he he brings men in your life at a certain season and I I don't know maybe I was nearly uh 40 years old before brother brother Tim and I become good friends and and from that time God gave me amen great men around us and friendships and brother Ron and I become friends and the Lord has used these men greatly in my life and I and I stand here tonight to say this because amen listen God God causes changes to to come in your life he causes situations and and things happen and transitions take place and you wonder will I survive this will this will this be the thing that just finishes you or takes takes you out where you're no longer effective or you know the enemy has a way that he works with people in their minds and when you come through transitions of your life and and and I'll say this to you amen listen above all what you're going to have to learn is you don't quit is you don't give up you don't you don't get to a place in your life where you say Amen that that I can't go any further or this ain't going to be able to take because I I I'm going to tell you if you if you will overcome you're going to make it but you're going to be repaid a h hundredfold amen and can I can I say something to you real amen a a a a year is longer than a 10-minute conversation that you have or it's longer than a bad week or it's better longer than a bad month and 10 years is longer than a bad year amen but sometimes you got to realize that it takes overcoming amen we can turn around and look in 10 years and I can see all that God has did amen but there were days in those 10 years where I thought I I wasn't going to make it till tomorrow it ain't going to make it till the next week but you know the promise is if a man will overcome amen and and I say tonight sometimes what you really got to overcome is yourself you got to overcome your own feelings and your own offenses and your own ideas and your own desires to quit I don't know who you are or where you're from but I guarantee you every one of you's had a moment in your life in the last year where you've said I ain't going to be able to make it past this moment or I ain't going to be able to make it past this day amen but if you overcome there is a tomorrow and there's a next day and there's a next day and if you give it to God Amen God can take your hours and your days and your weeks and you'll turn around and look behind you and say look at the blessings of what God has done for me look at the bless listen I don't know if anybody sitting in here tonight if you're drawing breath in your lungs that shouldn't be able to worship God tonight and say thank you Lord thank you for the blessings thank you for the Holy Ghost thank you for the power of God thank you for what you've done thank you for the healings Lord thank you for the years thank you for the blessings thank you for the Miracles Lord and you know what sometimes we get so caught up in all the problems we forget what God is doing for us and if we would just begin to praise God everything else would begin to fade away and we will begin to rise up in another place in our lives there is no replace for thankfulness there is no replace for gratitude there's no replacement for it tonight when you begin to thank God from a heart and you begin to worship Him it changes a little bit of everything to you now the prophet of God tells us this he said to overcome he said is to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people say there is no devil it's just a thought and don't don't don't you believe that there's a real devil and he's just as real as you are or anybody there's a real devil and you must recognize him real and you must know he's a devil and at the same time you've got to recognize him and know he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you've got to recognize that God is in you and is greater and mightier than he is and the one that's in you has already overcome and by his grace you are more than a match for him that's real overcoming is recognizing is recognizing that urge to quit is the devil is recognizing that desire to give up is the devil to recognize that spirit that speaks to you and says you're not enough you can't make it you can't do it you ain't going to get over it that's the devil trying to hold you from the blessings that God has gave you and I just sometimes want to stop and think about this if the devil is working this hard to stop you then what must God have ahead of you that Satan is afraid of I tell you what you are Satan's worst nightmare the worst nightmare that Satan has is a child of God that won't give up that won't turn around that won't get discouraged that won't get offended come on church amen amen I got some Elder Christians in here tonight that's got their families they've got their grandkids they've got their kids kids amen and you know why they got that is because they never got offended and they never quit and they never gave up and they believed God Amen and if God did it for them I believe he'll do it for you I believe God can do things for people if they'll just hold on to God yes sir I believe it I believe we got to overcome ourselves I believe sometimes we got to overcome ourselves you don't hear where we are in the age we're living in the prophet of God tells us that we're like it was on Mount transfigurations he says that when Jesus was standing there he said that's when the prophets and everything else was finished there on that mountain that's where the law of Moses and the Prophet Elijah came and the law and Prophets begin to come to an end now a lot of people takes that and they go into error with it but but the Bible tells us that after John the law and the prophets ended but look at the next verse it said but after that the kingdom of God but after that the kingdom of God what is that speaking of brother random says in Hebrews chapter 1 in the last days he'll speak through his son brother ROM said that's prophecy that God would possess his own church that it wouldn't be a prophet it would be Jesus Christ the prophet of prophets that would come down and to live in the church that's why the the testimony of the Bride is the spirit of Prophecy in the last days because Jesus himself is living in bright form do you see this is the hour when the scripture says hear ye him now if he said hear ye him in the Bible that was a prophecy he would speak in the last days now today if God's going to speak he's got to have a voice amen and the prophet identified the voice and he said it's not the church he said the bride is the final voice of the final hour what is she she's the speaking blood is that right then when your life is being lived amen it's a living voice and if that voice is the voice of the blood of Christ it is deity that's speaking out of you amen it's not just your heritage it's not just your genology it is deity that is living in you and this is to happen in my Bible it says in the days when the son of man is being revealed I believe we're standing here tonight in the history of the opening of The Seven Seals we're not waiting for a prophet tonight to come and open the seals we're not waiting for a prophet to return and set up a tent and have a Tent Revival and restore the church amen the church has the message of restoration we have the Harvest we have the word we have the mind of Christ in this age amen it's written in the Bible in Joel chapter 2 I will restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which i s among you and you shall eat plenty and be satisfied praise the name of the Lord your God he had dealt wondrously with you you and my people shall never be ashamed you see what he's predicting is a harvest in the time of restoration he's talking about the the wheat of the word that would return to the church that we wouldn't be living in a Husk age or a stock age or a tassel age it would be when the wheat returns to wheat it would be when the original gospel is being preached again in its power well that's exactly when the Devil comes like a flood that's exactly when Satan runs in like he's never ran in before that was in the Harvest when shangar had to protect his family and his Harvest with a noox nod brother man said he was only a farmer he wasn't a military man but he was going to keep his Harvest and I believe the Church of the Living God has been given a message in this hour and if you're going to keep the Harvest of this word you're going to have to fight with whatever you can get your hands on I believe my Bible said that everything would be restored to this church we will be back to the original book of Acts we will be restored back to the original Pentecost but see not just the original Pentecost but the original Pentecost and it would take us all the way back to what the Garden of Eden possessed for the church we would restore our right to the tree of life it would restore our inheritance with God it would restore our sunship back as if we had never fail in the beginning amen we're talking about a people that is going all the way back in the mind of God now listen folks the mind of God has been delivered to us in this age by a prophet of God Amen it's what was being opened under the Seven Seals it was not the flesh Mind of a man it was the mind of God that was coming to the church then what we have to see tonight is that the message has been delivered the spirit of God has already been given to the church restoration and harvest has already been restored to the church you said preacher what do we need tonight Paul said we need our eyes opened we need eyes sa that we might be able to see you know sometimes it's just our seeing that needs changed you know Luke 24 Jesus walked with two on the road to amus when he went down to the evening time and he went into the end with them isn't it amazing he had already been resurrected he had already been to the father and paid the debt he all in debt had already been paid he was already in an immortal body he was already walk walking with them but they didn't know who that was among them but when their eyes were opened amen they saw what had already been done listen tonight folks amen the son of man has already been revealed Among Us amen the word has been opened up restoration has come to the church adoption has been poured out upon the Church of the Living God and if the eyes could come open tonight every which direction you could see you would realize it belongs to you it belongs to you if you can get out of the husk tonight you can see it's your promise it's your promise it's your promise it's your promise amen I'm in the Bible when Abraham come out into his land and he had his father and he had his uncle with him remember when he met mdct was right after he departed from them and mdct says to him lift up your eyes lift up your eyes now that you have separated and you can believe everything I said lift up your eyes and look to to the north and look to the East and look to the South and look to the west and it all belongs to you listen every promise in this book belongs to you if you get out from under denominational and traditional ideas every promise in this book belongs to the Church of the Living God and if we got to fight with an ox nood brother pick up the ox if we got to fight with the word pick up the word because it belongs to us for our children for our children's children for our churches for our people oh we must hold on to this word of life that's been sin into this age in Ephesians chapter 1 it said if our eyes were opened up that we could share the throne with him then we would see as I have overcame and sat down on my father's throne so will you share in my Throne if you overcome now overcoming means to stand the test isn't that powerful I was sitting in the hospital the other day and my my dad had just had a a mild stroke and we were sitting there with him for maybe a couple weeks in the hospital and I was just sitting there one day and I was just in my own world thinking about the scripture and and the spirit of the Lord spoke to me and he said and the tempter came and that just that little phrase caught me and the tempter came I said where's that at in the scripture and I ran over and started looking y'all know where that's at in the scripture it's when Jesus receives the Holy Ghost and when he goes into the Wilderness the Bible said and the tempter came do you know do you know that's when the tempter comes now now it's amazing is God our lord Jesus was God he was God in heaven who had a glory before the world began and he took on a human robe and he left all of his glory in heaven and he took on a humble human robe and came down to the Earth and he weakened himself to humanity Bible said come lower than the angels and took upon him the Seed of Abraham that he might be tempted tested in every manner like an unto us is that right so he wasn't tested as deity he was tested as a man but then he starved that body until body got so weak into 40 days of hunger that's when the tempter came when he was in the weakest weakest moment now you all you all could study the famines of the world you can study the history of the world and know that hunger is one of the greatest pools on a human being that people will do more for food than they will for anything else in the Bible it's recorded women ate one another's babies but when they got hungry enough they fed their children to one another come on now we're talking about serious hunger we're talking about people that had wrecks with their friends in the airplanes amen and ate one another because they got so hungry they turned into cannibals because a human pull for Hunger gets beyond what a man could possibly withstand when he gets into that place and the Bible said and when the tempter came he said to him cast these down and make these stones into bread and tempted him on the word of God remember what Jesus did he said but it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God remember then the devil come at him another way and tempted him to show off with this gift and then the devil tempted him another way and said I'll give you the kingdoms of this world Amen and you won't have to do anything for it you don't have to be crucified for it you don't have to be rejected for it you don't have to be thrown down for it if you'll just kneel down to me I'll give you the kingdoms of the world world isn't that amazing that the tempter offered a man brother man said it wasn't the kingdom in that day it was the kingdom in this day it was the kingdom in all of his glory when Satan had his Eden to the top in his climax that's what he showed Jesus but Jesus refused that in the great Temptation and he overcame and the Bible is telling us that you can overcome also look at what it was when brother Brandon was losing his wife and his daughter he said that's when the tempter came remember what he done he got him in that weak moment and as the tempter came to him he began to say brother Bram said at one place he said God wouldn't talk to me but Jackie said God wouldn't talk to me he said that's when the devil did he said when God wouldn't answer my prayer that's when the devil come to me and he said look all you've ever done is pray for God's children preach the gospel give your life he said and when you need him and brother Ram said I said I come into my mind to say that's right he said I was about to say well if he can't help me then I can't and he said listen now all human reason to serve God was gone from me all the human reason that I man would serve God was gone he said but sit down and my soul was a birth and he said out of that Birth come the words amen the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord he said and the pressure left me Hallelujah the pressure left me when the word answered the test the pressure left me and it put brother brandom in a place it put him in a position he put him in an authority that even in his passion years later a cross-eyed child would walk on the platform and he could look at them and make their eyes straighten up because he was sharing a Dominion because that he had overcome by the word do you recognize tonight amen that you're that you got things you got to overcome hjuj come on Church the devil's not coming at you when you're on your high pot he's not coming when you're on the top of the mountain but Satan waits till you get real low he waits till the sick die he waits till the trouble comes he waits till the failures happen in the family he waits till a little mixup gets in the church and then he comes and then he attacks you but I say to him that overcometh to him that'll stand with a word in the middle of the trial in the middle of the problem I say the Bible is telling us they will rule with him they will share in a dominion over Satan because they're able to hold on to that word listen this bride has the mind of christl and the prophet said nothing would persuade them different I love that don't you nothing would persuade them different they had the mind of Christ now what they've done is they've traded the finite for the infinite they think about trials differently than humans do humans think about a trial what' you do wrong humans think about a trial God must be punishing you for something but the infinite mind comes upon the finite and says God has a plan in this all things work together for the good of them that love God and are called according to his purpose God will get Glory out of this amen the Bible said if God before you who can be against you listen the devil's got to come that's his job but it's our job to cast him out to turn him around to take this word of life and hold our Harvest now you'll trade the finite for the infinite I don't have time to preach on that but I'll say this amen that's exactly what Rebecca did when she veiled herself in the field to meet Isaac brother Ram said when she put that Veil he said she didn't want any of her thoughts when she approached her husband he said from that time on Isaac was her thinking and here this bride has met this word and we veiled ourselves from our own thinking from our own decisions from our own per come on some of you left houses and homes some of you amen come out of Every Which situation and you gave up and forsook everything and maybe you're standing there in the middle of a trial saying God I've gave up everything and look where I'm at tonight let be assure you friend God has not forgotten your labor of love amen the Bible said any man that would give up I will restore to him H hundredfold yes sir I say he's here tonight I say the Creator's here tonight and if you could hold into the revelation of the word there's a power to push the enemy back to bring the life amen to restore that back to you now what will Revelation do for you revelation will trade the finite for the infinite other words to transfer the mind of God to the human it takes Revelation now if you want to transfer uh uh uh book knowledge to you you read a book but if you want to transfer Dynamic power you get Revelation Revelation is not an intellectual Affair Revelation is a spiritual Affair it has to spiritually Transform You by a transferring power of the spirit of God quickens his word and makes it live inside you it brings you Dynamic power not just knowledge but Dynamic power now do you see even the Rapture is a revelation even the Rapture is a revelation now you can't have Revelation without it being faith and faith is a revelation faith is a revelation how now the prophet will tell us this and another one's the end time he'll say now watch that first poll is a healing that second poll is a prophecy but that third pull is the opening of the word it's the mystery revealed and there's no more higher order to reveal the word than a prophet and the only way a prophet can be Vindicated is by that word and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in that word see the mind of Christ was sealed away from the church but when that message was opened up it opened the mind to the church now it's not a pull pit Affair it's not a pull pit Affair this not just an anointed man and a bunch of people trying to absorb some intellectual speech but this is a relationship Affair where the church has been taken back into the back part of God's mind hid away from the world transferred into the presence of God God by the power of the Revelation and in there is where every believer whether she's a whether she's a widow woman or whether she's a washwoman whether she's a simpler amen whether he's a great man it's not a pull pit anointing it's a broad anointing hallelujah amen it's to a place where if you can every person could catch the Revelation every man that cometh unto God could receive the revelation of this age and you don't have to be a preacher or a special person you got to be a believer you got to be an overcomer if you can overcome will I share with you the Revelation that brings you into Power Hallelujah now listen I I believe tonight that God has a way of inducting the church into Power it's Revelation the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized come on y'all know these quotes and now you got to be real careful cuz these are not intellectual got to be real careful cuz the letter kills the spirit gives life the importance of the Revelation is the True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more than perhaps you can understand because what happens is revelation is what contacts the soul now you got to you got to see something powerful is that you are a Triune being right you got a body you got a spirit you got a soul do you know that your body could be eat up with cancer and your soul a Christian do you know that you can have your spirit Afflicted with oppressions and nervousness and all kinds of anxieties and you're 100% a Christian because inside the soul is whether a man is saved or a man is unsaved and this outward body can take attacks from every which direction it can take attacks in the human body it can take attx in the spirit body but see there's a soul of a man if that Soul ever comes in contact with God that is a gene that come from before the foundation of the world that Gene seed of God cannot be changed can I say it to you like this the devil can't change what God done in eternity I don't care how sick the body gets I don't care how nervous the spirit gets as a soul on the inside of the believer that the devil can't touch that because it belongs to God I'll say this to you you can take a drop of water and drop it into a top drop it into a a little a little cup of wine and you ever get that water out of that wine you'll never do it because it becomes one with it and when the spiritual Revelation is given to a Believer no amount of tribulation will get that Revelation out of them you can beat them you can destroy them you can you can can hammer on them but there's something in them come on church I know what I'm talking about I'm s looking at brother Jackie tonight here with his walker amen but I tell you what the body's taking a eaten amen but the Soul on the inside of that man says I have overcome still holding the battle still believing the word why because there's an overcomer in there hallelujah hallelujah I don't I God bless you all I don't mean to make an example of you my bet he gets probably gets tired of it but brother Amen brother Ron's probably the best example I can give you in this building tonight I know I know the devil says well this is going to happen this going to happen but the devil's a liar right amen but somebody's got to hold and overcome no matter what their body's going through the word is still the word you said it's easy for brother on that's in his physical what about you that's holding that n that nervousness that anxiety and you're walking around thinking well I've sinned or I've done this or I've done that it's no different than some kind of sickness on your body and the devil's trying to do all he can do to tell you he has a right to be there but that's a lie he has no right to be there and as a Son of God I got a right to charge him tonight by the power of God and say Satan I rebuke you you're trespassing God's Property you have no right to be there you have no hold to be there amen I tell you what I tell you this if he wants to hook up to this spirit I tell him he better hold on brother cuz he's pring to get a ride of his life this is going to be a tongue talking Holy Ghost feel sound believer if he's going to hold on to my spirit he's going to have to hear the Praises and the testimonies I'll tell you what I think sometimes we are to pull the devil up a chair if you you want to come to church we'll come to church but you're going to come to watch me Rejoice oh Hallelujah somebody say hallelujah hallelujah you know the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against this the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against spiritual [Music] Revelation never do it the Gates of Hell will never against the Revelation the Gates of Hell will never Prevail that means they'll be after it but it will never Prevail over it it is revelation of God that gives you authority over the devil direct quotes it is a revelation that will give you a fire over the devil and the devil's been telling you he has authority over you but if you let the infinite transfer to the finite you would find out in the mind of God you've already been glorified in Romans the 8th chapter say many as he's called he's Justified and as many he's Justified he's already glorified and if you can overcome and get your eyes open you would find out that you are belonging to God and have authority over this [Music] devil it'll take the open of them themselves to do it thank God they're open Revelations 1 and6 you can see it change in scripture I love how scriptures are just written so beautiful yeah in Revelations 1:6 he said he's made us Kings and Priests y'all know what that means the highest of the civil and the highest of the religious Kings and Priests unto our God to be him be glory and Dominion forever now watch what we're Kings and Priests but to him be dominion and Glory before the seals when the seals open in Revelation chapter 5 and the 10th verse John changes his language and he said has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth look it went from Jesus having Dominion to we're going to have dominion what happened the man saw his name in that book he understood that the blood had spoke for him and every sin and every disbelief and every trial had been put under the blood and he knew if you could just get rid of the sin that man was made to be over the [Music] [Applause] Angels we're going to be Kings with him we sit on the earth and throne but right now we are spiritual Kings I know you know this scripture it's beautiful Romans 5:17 tells us this that we would reign in this life in Colossians 1:3 it tells us that we have been delivered from the power of darkness and translated into the kingdom reign of his dear son isn't that amazing translated into the a realm of where you have power out of Darkness into light now right now we reign with Christ having dominion over y'all know the quote sin right the World the Flesh and the devil yeah isn't that powerful right now you're already ruling these things showing forth the praise and the glory showing himself for it is Christ us willing and doing good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seted in Heavenly places in Christ right now SE in Heavenly places now not tomorrow not when you feel better right [Applause] now isn't it amazing to realize right now that you've been seated can I can I can I tell you this I'll tell you how brother Bram said it we're in the wheelbarrow come on yeah in other words it's easy for us to sit and say Jesus is seated come in power brother brandom seated in power but brother brandom explains it humble thyself in a very beautiful way what he says is he says look he said now the other day he said a man come and his Pastor was telling him a story and he said he said I can take this wheelbarrow and I can push it across this gap on this log and he said the man said to the pastor he said I believe you can he said the man come back and I'll shorten the story man come back and he said I believe I can push this wheel bear across here with you in it took a different Faith didn't it it's one thing to see a prophet doing something pushing a wheelbarrow but with you in it now it's a different kind of Faith because what you're seeing then is you're a part of the administration of what is happening in this age he put you in the willbur now can can I just say it hey man since we're since we're just old Hill belly folk we'll say it I got a wheelbarrow and a PhD postto diggers man I get deep with those things [Applause] too anybody got a PhD in here you see amen you if if you see it if you understand it you're in the wheelbarrow with him don't get out of the WHEB don't disposition yourself because the pressure the enemy is going to put on you the devil's going to do everything he can do to get you out of that wheelbarrow he's going to make fun of you he's going to tease you put pressure on you he'll say well you're a failure you're trying to make something of yourself you're trying to be amen but you know sometimes false humility is the worst problem we have yeah we might as well go ahead and preach since we come all the way down here well I can't sing now if you can't sing where's that put me well I tell you I can't preach well if you can't preach sit down but if God called you take the position and tell the devil to get out of the way I might not be the best preacher but God called me he called me and brother if God called me he'll back me up and I don't need a bunch of good words I need the power of God to drop into the church and anoint the hearts of the Believers that's what we need is Men Of God that know God called them men of God that are sure of where they're standing and why they're standing there I'm not here because a man put me here I'm here because God put me [Applause] here and if God give you the seat it's your seat come on church it's the truth now we're in the WHEB I believe right now we are sons of God you know I'm in the scripture 1 John chapter 3 or we are right now sons and brother B says see he says but if he says listen now he said if you can ever get the scare out of the church and let them realize who they are what they are positionally healing will be the simplest message to be preached or anything else but you're scared you're afraid you don't realize that you're Sons and Daughters of God now not you will be you are right now Sons and Daughters of God not off in the future somewhere right now you said brother Wayne this issue and this issue but the tempter came to him and his first words if thou be the Son of God he never said there wasn't a son of God he never scripturally said there wasn't coming a Son of God he just said if thou be he put a question mark over if you're the one and that's the thing the devil's too smart to say there's not a reality he's too smart to say there's not a real church or there's a real bride or there's a real Rapture he just says if there'll be well let me tell you this amen it's not because I made myself amen but a prophet came in this age and he identified this bride not as a church as the bride that was in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world and tonight we are seated in Heavenly places by the message of the hour I know what it's like people say well brother Wayne someday there's a great Revival coming and I really like how they do it and they all look back to that great Revival that was well I'm sorry but I'm interested in the one that's now I'm interested in what is tonight I'm not even talking about what was last night and what's tomorrow night I'm talking about right tonight this may be your last service this may be your last hour and you're putting it off over there or putting it off over there amen but God is here the devil is here you are here where are you going to stand are you going to let the devil just keep backing you in the corner telling you put it off till tomorrow put it off till tomorrow well listen devil I ain't putting it off another hour to another today right now right now right now we are Sons and Daughters of God and Satan is under our feet by the power Hallelujah God is real he's not a tomorrow God he's not a yesterday God he's the I am that I am and I am come down at my people right now this very minute what the prophet said amen he said right now I like that present tense right now right now do you know you know the prophet teaches us things of how to perform miracles do you know there's people don't even believe in miracles days of Miracles has passed isn't that amazing that we've come so far we've went back to Church of Christ teaching come on I'm not I'm not got to be straight with you I know what I'm talking about I've been the guy that preached on Miracles and other people come and say well that stuff was proved and brother brandom we don't need it proved anymore we just believe the word funny thing is there was a Church of Christ preacher told me the same thing about Paul Paul proved it now we got the word that's all we have to do is believe well I don't want any word that don't work today if that word ain't as good today as it was yesterday what good is it doing our children when our children are laying with addictions and troubles and problems we need a God that can come on the scene we need a God that can walk in a building and change lives and hearts and move people together that's the kind of God we need we don't need a God that'll show up next week or next month or next [Applause] year we need preachers and teachers that could call it present tense and you're never going to do it from your human El CU your human element was going to fail you but brother random taught us how to perform a miracle he literally taught us how you say how do we perform Miracles brother bam said this is how they're performed he said you believe God's word he says take God at his word and begin to believe it that's the only way to please him take his word that's the way Miracles are performed when God took his word the impossibilities Are Made Real when God has tooken his word and not questioned get it out of your mind this day this scripture is fulfilled that's the only thing in your mind refuse to see anything that disagrees with that word come on Church we've got living proof here tonight amen that God is able to defy the human body the doctrin the ideas of man and miracles are still taking place in the Church of the Living God the way Miracles are performed is when God has took it his word now to overcome and to stay with that word in the middle of the test is what sets you in power it's what sets you in power now I'm going to visit a scripture that you have heard preached I many of you probably many times you I I want to just put it back in your mind a minute y'all remember in Matthew 20 now the sons of thunder their mother came to Jesus amen and said now can my son sit at your right hand and your left hand yes and his answer was marvelous he said they can be baptized with my baptism and they can drink of the cup that I drank of but to sit at my right and left hand I cannot give them because the position is not in existence at this time he said it has been predestinated for a group that will be coming now I'll tell you what brother brandom says the position was not in existence at that time it will be granted to them who is it meant for one to set it one left and one at right it will be given after the trial comes you said what are you talking about what the seventh age of leoda is the great trial of the church yeah it's the great testing of the church it's the time when the Antichrist in Matthew 24 becomes so close and deceiving and so close it would deceive in every Point except the word but at that moment is when the bride overcomes and the Overcomer of Revelations 3 is the man and woman of Matthew 20 it's after the test comes that's when they'll be seated then this seating is something that is meant for the end time in Ephesians chapter 1 the Bible says that with all spiritual blessings we are put in Heavenly places brother Bram said positions positions positions he chapter 2 we have been raised up together to sit in Heavenly places in Christ isn't that something he's lifted you up and set you in a position above your enemy brother pom says you have been re raised up risen with him manifested attributes of God setting in the Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life setting in the heavenly places in Christ that means so much nowadays Church it means so much to see ourselves positionally placed in Christ now what's he saying we are already seated with him yes now can I just cut to the Chase and say something to you real straight Jesus said don't you know it's written in the scripture that you are Gods now just just get out of the weeds get out of the bus and get out in the Fairway a minute Jesus said you are Gods quit batting around in religion and worried about somebody hit it over the fence and you're out looking for it in the bushes get out in the Fairway you're God's forget AR with your heritage and your genetics and all of the issues Jesus said you are gods don't you know the scripture says this of you I don't have time to preach it but I'll say this is amazing to me because this is exactly why the devil said Jesus couldn't be him because he would suffer but it's amazing to me that the Bible said them that live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution so not only are we suffering it is predicted that we would suffer great are the afflictions of the righteous but God will deliver them through them all if I had time I'd preach another sermon right now we've been Afflicted but brother we're not defeated let the weak say they're strong let the poor say that they're rich I don't care what your body feels like tonight say I'm Ill it don't matter how low your spirit is I'm Victorious according to Genesis chapter 1 you've been given Dominion you were created for Dominion I love a prophet I I love a prophet don't you if his word is absolute truth this may choke you to death but you you know that men and women are sons and daughters are amateur Gods Amen Let me put the bottom of the quote amen the sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him bro oh brother over in the Millennium no sir no sir right here tonight sons of God will take every Power Satan has away from him you say they going to do it just like Jesus did it brother Ram said he never used one gift I'm so glad he didn't you know why you know why he said he didn't use gifts he said because there would be a lot of people in the end that wouldn't have that kind of gift he said so he used the word to set the weakest Christian in power over the devil amen if you could just say it is written you have been given dominion over the devil tonight maybe you don't have a special gift like some of the Great Men of God do but God gave you his word and if you can take that word you can take back everything the devil has taken from you and say Satan I am in power [Music] tonight oh when the church gets the revelation of the two spirits that work within the church y'all remember the quote she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army now it's amazing if she gets the Revelation within the framework of the church by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her now he knows if these people get the true Revelation if they get the transfer of the infinite into this finite mind mind they would take a revelation out of that that they were sons of God to begin with and whatever the devil has done to this son in time can't change what God did in eternity Satan does not have the power to change eternity and if you have eternal life you always were Eternal and God has came to redeem the Eternal attributes that he had in his mind before the world again and the devil can have every temper tantrum he wants to have but God has already made Appropriations to bring every child [Applause] home now he says this if she could find out what she stands for now you you you you all know there's a lot of people against a lot of things and I won't take a long time here but I think it's important to say now and again he a lot of people against a lot of things but I am just a little over sick with people against everything I'm just a little past put out with people who are against every move of God every little happening every little thing against against against against against amen you know where that's coming from it's this political atmosphere we're living in you you can see a video in this day they'll go to one of the Millennials and they'll say you know maybe they'll take one of the former former presidents or something and they'll say to them heyen what what do you think I'm against that guy and I'm against what I'm against I'm against and they'll say well what are you really for well well you know my life is too precious come on to give it to be against something but but I want to give my life for something I want to give my life to God for something Hallelujah now you say preacher what do you stand for I'll tell you this I stand for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I stand for the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming to every believer that believes could be sealed into the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the quickening power of almighty God I believe you can get it where you're sting tonight I believe you can get it at the altar I believe you can get it with hands laid on you I believe you can get it at the home of your church church I think we got too many regulations I think we've regulated God come out of the situation but I think we ought to do is back up and let God be God and say I'm for God I'm for God moving I'm for the holy ghost coming in the church can I tell you what I'm really for I'm for a move of God I'm for God starting at that side and moving Plumb across this congregation I'm for him starting at that wall and moving Plumb to that back wall we can't counsel every marriage we can't counsel in school every young person we can't we can't watch you and every little thing you do amen but we can turn loose the Holy Ghost in This Place and the deserter of Hearts can come to your home he can come to your life it can change it but we got to get out of his way oh yes sir the preacher we're going to cast that's all right amen I got a hch of haters already no I know you Ain young men I believe in Alder calls you know why I believe in that that's where I got the Holy Ghost and no matter what anybody says about Alder calls there's a place for them and I thank God somebody had alar call theight I need to get saved you might need to not need that altar I needed an altar I needed a humbling I believe in them I believe in alar cause I believe in people lifting their hands and accepting Christ why do we have to be so picky about how they get it how about just being for them getting it I'm for people getting help if they go to the hospital or they come to a prayer line thank God they got to help God help the people come on you know what I'm talking about that some people are so important and they're so self styled they got all the answers and they're so controlling if it don't happen in our church if it don't happen in my Ministry if it don't happen oh that ain't God that's God that ain't God that a amen who left you in charge anyhow I'm sorry I feel like preaching we've had enough popes we've had enough Bishops we've had enough men trying to rule the church why not not let God come and Rule his own church why not let the Holy Ghost loosen the church I tell you what I stand for I Stand For preachers standing behind a pull pit and preaching the gospel I stand for it I know that there's a whole group now don't believe in this no more they believe in just playing tapes but let me promise you something the real brother brandom said to preach the gospel they can sign their letter any way they want to but the real brother brandom said to preach the gospel somebody said well don't you love brother brandom yeah he said if you love me do what I told you to do and he called us and said go stand and say what I say and brother if it comes hell or high water if it comes addictions troubles problems situations you didn't like it huh I'm not talking about I'm talking about the pits of hell and it's come against the church in every which way that it can but somebody's going to keep standing somebody's going to keep preaching anyhow I stand for being a member of a [Applause] church well we might as well go ahead and preach have we I stand for it I stand for being a member of a church it's easy to stream somebody cuz there ain't no Pastor looking down your nose and preaching against your sin and your trouble and you don't have to rub shoulders with [Applause] people hey look can can I can I tell you one thing that I stand for above all things I stand for second chances I stand for second chances I do I stand for people getting a second chance and let me let me just take it past that I believe if a second chance don't work I believe in third chances and if a third chance CH don't work guess what I believe in the four chance pass out brother I believe in five chances and six chances and seven chances and as many as it takes because we don't quit we don't give up we don't stop we don't turn around we do it till it's right cuz we're children of God and we don't know what defeat means and we don't know what turn around means y'all know I'm telling you the truth here tonight somebody said well we ought to just throw them away I'm sorry they're too valuable to throw away as one soul is worth 10,000 worlds and if we had to dig through the trash pile to pull them out and help them well God bless you for helping somebody so you got to work with them that's all right God worked with you I believe this I think of this I think of this often when netan IH who the Israelites stood over there in Israel not too many years ago and the whole world was attacking him and you know what he said he said if I have to I'll Stand Alone one man in the entire world he said if I have to stand alone I'll stand alone I tell you what I think amen I would rather have five people and a tambourine out on that street corner and enjoying the things of God than a houseful of people all formalized and intellectualized and sitting down on the move of God come on church I would do it alone if I had to but thank God brother Tim we don't have to thank God that He gave us good pastors good churches good pews good music good singers good preachers we don't have to stand alone tonight look at what God has put in the house look at the brothers and the sisters that he's put around you you don't have to stand alone you can stand with a church Church of the Living [Applause] God the next time somebody says I'm against something won't you ask them what they're for then so I'm against what brother Tim's down what what are you for [Music] then now amen hope I ain't preaching too much like a pastor tonight you know what this I stand for this because I know that when this bride recognizes who she is she can do the greater work when she starts recognizing who she is and what she's here for she can do the Greater Works do you know that the Greater Works is the spoken word the greater meaning of the Greater Works is the spoken word did the prophet of God will tell us like this he'll say to this verily I say unto you little Gods if you'll say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you have said now the freaking that's that's that's not skim milk and Mark let me give you the scripture Mark 11 CH 23 for verily I say unto you whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and cast in the sea shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe the things which he sayith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith Matthew 17 and 20 Jesus said unto them because of the unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have the faith as a grain of a mustard seed you shall say to this mountain remove hence to under place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible to you in Matthew 21- 21 Jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if you have faith and not doubt you shall not only do this as which done to a fig tree but also if you shall say under this mountain be moved and cast in the sea it shall be done oh brother brandom said that wasn't a mountain of sin he was pointing at the Mount of Olives right now now when we say this tonight I know that it seems extreme but the prophet of God says an adoption message to the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak the word it is backed I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain and let it be now Romans the 8th chapter the 19th verse it said the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of Sons The Prophet says this is the day of the manifestation of the sons of God when the Mysteries that's been hid since the foundation of the world have been made known this is the hour Hallelujah that's a lot of words stacking up there the prophet said in Israel and the church he said there will be a real genuine anointing the Holy Ghost called out church he said they'll speak the word and it'll flash like lightning you know that we're living in a season that the prophet of God said limbs would be added were they've been missing before limbs that are missing off of people somebody said well how did he do it God created the first one if he can create a squirrel he can create an arm if he can create a squirrel he can create an eye you know several years back sister Carla sitting right there you remember that baby that white Camp baby when it didn't have kidneys amen and we took a prayer cloth went all across America having prayer for that baby and and you guys prayed for that baby and God grow kidneys in that child it didn't have organs but God gave it organs because a prayer of faith changes things I believe missing limbs could be added I believe whatever God did he could do it again now now folks I I believe this tonight you said preacher amen I'll tell you what these are hard things to believe but brother Bram said the same creative life that you see is in you and if you're a prisoner you can speak it and it'll and when it speaks it won't be you that spoke it will be God that spoke do you know the prophet said that the Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity then your bodies is the Temple of the Dynamics deity is not in heaven Hallelujah deity is in you now I know that you have so diminished your own personal self that you think that God in you is powerless but wouldn't it be something tonight if we took a chunk of uranium and we put it in a plastic bag and we brought that plastic bag and handed it to you do you think uranium could hurt you in a plastic bag well maybe you put it in a Piggly Wiggly bag maybe you put it in a brown bag maybe you put in a plastic bag uranium is still uranium and he still has just as much power whether it's in a paper bag or not in a paper bag and God is so powerful that you can put him in a young person or an old person an educated person or an uneducated person you can put him in a preacher or a teacher you can put him in a Schoolhouse you can put him in a mom you can put him in a daughter he still is God come on Church the Holy Ghost is not the second person of the godhead it is God and that God is in you and when you speak deity speaks look how the prophet in the wonders of unity he's preaching like this and he fills that Spirit he said Satan you know the scripture on that I love it Prophet said Satan you know the scripture on that I've just taught the people that God is in them and if God is in them and they speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt it in their heart right then that disease has to move for it's not them that speaks it's the father that dwelleth in them speaking oh my goodness if the Holy Ghost could do the talking tonight if you could overcome yourself the Holy Ghost do the talking God has took his power and put it amongst human beings you know he said this is the last thing that would happen in the church my new ministry the last thing that I know of there's nothing else it will be given to human beings to ask anything they desire and whatever they ask it shall be given to them Hallelujah speak to the mountain brother bam said I wanted to happen now that that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God she'll raise to her feet like a mighty marching Army the sick will be healed the word the blind will see the death will hear the dead will be raised up the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now my goodness I don't believe we are to ever live under our privileges but I believe we will live to the time of the maturing of the wheat seed I believe we're living in the harvest season when the alpha has become the Omega when the first has become the last I don't believe we're looking for that bride to rise up brother I believe she's here I believe the bride has resurrected and she's alive tonight I don't believe the mind of God is off there 10 million miles away I believe I'm looking at the very literal mind of God in flesh sitting here tonight brother I'll tell you this I find out this thing I believe the prophet of God said when man begins to speak his word he said now watch the translation of that scripture and it doesn't say quickly the mountain will be moved he said but actually it says by and by the mountain will be moved he said when you speak it and don't doubt it in your heart he said he said it translates and believe that it is happening you know how how things feel different when you know something's happening I was telling the church the other day I just I just broke my phone and uh and and and uh I called the place and they saidwell you got insurance on it so I called the AT&T and and they called me right back it's about 1:00 the day I sat in my house and I said I broke my phone I need a new phone and they said well you got insurance here said where do you live and I told them they said well it's 3:00 or 5:00 okay I said what they said well we'll have somebody with the Brom phone out there 3:00 or 5:00 I said today sure enough here they come come brought that brand new phone brought me a little package with it and said now as soon as you get that stuff transferred to that phone put that old phone in there and ship it back so I let the battery get dead and lost that dude and I thought man I don't know where it's at they called me about three times there about a week they called me once then called me again third time they called me lady said you send that phone back yet and I said no ma'am I said no I need to get that done she said yeah she said there's a$ 250 $ 5 deposit on that phone I went to looking I found I found that baby in there next to my bed and I got the package and put it together and gave it to Carissa and Carissa got it in the mail and that that afternoon the lady called me back she said she said did you get that phone in the mail I said yes ma'am she said well we won't be bothering you again cuz it's in process they hadn't got it but me putting it in in the mail settled it for him and see when you know something is moving and you settled in your heart you live different because you know that not the whole Mountain's gone but you know the moment you spoke that word a significant grain of sand was removed from that mountain and that mountain started moving the moment you started speaking I don't know if it'll take a year I don't know if it'll take a month I don't know if it'll take 10 years but whatever mountain is in your way tonight whether it be sickness whether it be trouble whatever it is say mountain move in the name of Jesus Christ and a significant grain of that sand begins to be moved out of that mountain as a man a child of God begins to speak that word things begin to be moved can I can I can I say to you tonight church that the word of God is in control of your future [Applause] listen I know where you're sitting tonight I know what the devil's doing I know what the devil has done to design you he said to you am mean you're not going to make it no you're not going to make it see you're going to get to a certain point and then that same old thing's going to come up but this time you ain't going to be able to get past it and then it's going to get you is that what he tells you let me tell you let me tell you a secret he don't control the future the devil don't know the future he is not a prophet he's a liar so he's trying to put a false prophecy over your life so he could use your faith to bring discouragement into your life but he's a liar he does not control the future he does not know what's going to happen tomorrow the devil don't know what's going to happen in 5 minutes from now but my Bible my Bible tells me tonight that God's got a future for you in the power of God and you begin to prophesy the word and things begin to change he's a liar prove it prove it right here you won't live over four months three years ago the devil don't know what he's talking about he don't know he said well you're going to fail you ain't never going to make it this is going to happen this is going to happen and look he told me 10 years ago you'll never make it if you leave here and you go do that you're never going to make it and 10 years later and 10 years later amen I'm looking at him and I'm saying my son-in-laws are preachers God give me miracles for babies amen God's given me a wonderful church with wonderful people he's GI me a faithful he's given me a life only a man could dream of but brother it took some overcoming it took some hours in my life to say Satan you're lying to me you're lying to me that ain't going to work like that that ain't going to be like that and until you learn to say to Satan you don't control me you don't know my future you don't know what's going to be amen the devil run you around yes sir can I say something I think it's time to take your faith and to challenge that [Applause] devil I know I know I know what the devil's telling you he's telling you if you'll lay back he'll take it easy on you he's a liar listen if Palestine and Israel if you learned anything Palestine promises if Israel give up part of their property that they'll have peace it's a lie Palestine wants property because they want to get closer to destroying Israel and Satan is not going to give you peace if you give up the prayer lines amen he's going to give you more sickness than ever if you give up the moving of the Holy Ghost he's going to be more punishing than ever he ain't going to back off of you he's going to press you and press you and press you but listen this is one preacher that will not be pressured and pushed into a corner whatever the Bible says is exactly what we have a right to in this age it's time to challenge that devil it's time to challenge that Spirit that's operating in your life that little thing that keeps that keeps you under that it's time for you to challenge it it's time for you to look back at the Devil and say I'm not no I that's not who I am that's not what I'm going to become that's not where I'm going hallelujah oh I know what he does yeah get you a little offended then you're going to run off somewhere by yourself and then you're going to sit and spend all that time by yourself talking to yourself and the devil's going to make everything that's ever been said to you I made your hurt and this person hurt me and that person hurt me and this person hurt me and really the only people that's ever hurt you is the devil but if you challenge that devil tonight and say Satan you drugg me down dark paths you brought me into depression you've ruined my family you've hurt me you've done this you've done I tell you what I'm not going to give you another moment of my life I'm not going to give you another moment of my life when is enough enough challenge that devil tonight you said what can I do believe God for a change sir what can Faith do to you tonight faith can save a life Faith could give you the Holy Ghost Faith could heal your body Faith could give you Miracle Faith could give you overcoming power it's the it's it's the thing that overcomes the world faith and faith can give you a word to speak victory over that Faith could give you something to believe for your family Hallelujah I'm sitting here preaching to people tonight it's got people sitting here that come in by [Applause] prayer isn't it time to challenge that enemy our musicians would come tonight isn't it time sir isn't it time time to turn and challenge challenge it wouldn't it be something if we really realized who our enemy was tonight

ain't going to be that way wouldn't that be something right now my future future ain't going to be that no devil I tell you what my future is going to be like it's going to be filled with the joy of the Lord it's going to be filled with the power of God it's going to be filled with wonderful [Applause] friendsall Hallelujah yeah that's the future I have that's the future you can have that's you can determine tonight I'm going to have that future God's going to give me that wonderful wife that believing wife because I've asked for it [Music] sure he's here that's not your brother Wayne Lawson

open right now my spirit's wide open people sometimes wonder maybe what me and brother Tim's connection is but Joel when there was a group piled on me trying to kill me that man stood by me that's right people were saying you're going to be this and you're going to be that and brother Tim was saying brother it's a lie God's going to use you like never before and you know what I believed him you you it's important who your friends are it's important who your friends are don't surround yourself with people that's always putting you down and beating you down you ain't never going to and you
