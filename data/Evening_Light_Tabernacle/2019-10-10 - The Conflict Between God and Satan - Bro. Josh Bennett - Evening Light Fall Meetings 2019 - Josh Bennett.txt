little something out tonight to make a little more room for Christ you just lift your cup up to it [Music] I'll tell you what I'd liked it to be in these meetings and your gal your cup gets so full that it runs down in your saucer you fulfill the scripture the David said my cup runneth over it's running over and you get so much out of these meetings that you can take it back to your home where have you come from or if you're here local you can take it back to your home in your church it's just running over forever need that's around you we live in a dying world and I an awful dark hour but it's in those dark hours that Jesus comes and he's here to come for you tonight to meet your need to speak to your life I believe he still deserves the thoughts and intents of the heart I believe

Father we just thank you Lord for this time Lord this what we consider it to be an opportunity in order to be able to come Lord into your presence and Noor we believe God that we're in your presence tonight Lord because you keep all your appointments and Lord you've already promised in your word that wherever two or three are gathered in your name that you will be in the midst and Lord we believe that you are in the midst tonight God we believe that you are here and Lord I believe that wherever you are the supernatural is a reality wherever you are Lord it's impossible that we could remain in the same condition that we're in Lord so I pray tonight that every person Lord just now with what settle it in their heart Lord that they're gonna leave different than they came we're gonna leave better Christians we're gonna leave Lord more in love with you with a closer relationship we're gonna rededicate and consecrate our lives but we're gonna take and seize the moment tonight and we're gonna Lord take this opportunity Lord to let's to come up to the Masters table and the Lord to draw nine to you and you already promised God that if we would draw nine to you that you would draw nine to us and Lord that's what we want to do tonight so God we just ask thee Lord as we take this Bible Lord how precious that it and Lord as we open it up God we know this is your word and it's it's anointed word Lord it's infallible heavens and earth will pass away but that word can never fail but Lord we as we open this Bible tonight God anybody can read the words but Lord we're asking the author of the book or just a drop down tonight and Lord make this word a living reality to us lord I pray that you would open every heart and Lord that we would receive the word with gladness Lord I pray as we receive that word Lord that we would become the word that's the desire we have tonight so God we just ask your blessing upon the service now and lord may you have preeminence god I pray Lord that your perfect will would be done among us in the name of Jesus Christ we ask a man in amen amen if you take your Bibles tonight we'll ask you to turn with us to the book of second Corinthians in the tenth chapter 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 and I'd like to read a few verses here this evening we'll be reading from the first verse 2nd Corinthians 10 and verse 1 now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence and base among you but being absent and bold toward you but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled revelations the twelfth chapter if you'd like to turn with us their revelations chapter 12 we'll just read this and let you have your seats tonight revelations 12 and we'll read from verse 7 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death may God just had his blessings you can have your seats this evening I mean he's glad to be an overcomer amen I'd like to read also from Ephesians 6 we'll just read this tonight as we as we just begin to enter into our thought Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 Paul says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and then the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you might be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and places I want you to notice that Paul is again saying we are not wrestling against flesh and blood so you can you can look at your neighbor tonight and say you're not my enemy a man your wife is not your enemy you mean your husband is not your enemy your brother's not your enemy we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you might be able to stand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all take the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen I'd like to just speak to you for a few minutes tonight by the help of the Lord on a thought and I would title it the conflict between God and Satan and I just want to approach this you know but even even our prophet when he preached the message he he titled Satan's Eden there in 1965 when he was taking that thought he said I just would like to bring something to enlighten you to make us better soldiers in the field that we're fighting in now Amen he says he would like to bring something to help us learn the tactics of the enemy so that we could block everything before it gets to us aiming to learn to keep the punches off of you amen and and so I would just like to approach it in that way tonight I believe that we need to know our enemy I believe that we need to know the battle that we're in tonight you see because we you know we can't we're not fighting in Luther's day we're not we're not living in Wesley's day but we're in a battle right now and we need something to equip us in the battle we're in right now amen and so how many knows you're in a battle Amen if you ain't in a battle I say you just go ahead and come on to the altar now because even if you're not in a battle then there's something wrong with your testimony amen because we are in a battle we are in a war but but this war didn't start with you and you're not the only one that's fought in this war and as a matter of fact the conflict is not even between you and Satan the conflict is between God and Satan it just so happens that many of us amen are identified with Jesus Christ amen and because we have taken sides with Jesus tonight he may we have become an enemy of his in other words amen Satan is his enemy and because we have taken sides with Jesus then Satan has now become our enemy amen you see what I'm saying even even though the conflict is between God and Satan amen now we have entered into this battle by identification amen but the war didn't start with us even it started in heaven I believe that if we can find the origin of this great battle of this war that's going on I believe would help us tonight so the battle started in heaven but the prophecy in the fourth seal it'll finish on the earth in the form of Armageddon amen and the greatest battle ever fought he said this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer in his angel - angel it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on the earth it originated in heaven and it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human means the battle even from Angels becoming human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation he meant what God had created for himself that was what his purpose was was to destroy it and then the battle begin here owners and it began in us and has been raging ever since Amen so we can see that this battle started in heaven but the Battle of Angels has now become human battles Amon but you know what I would like to point out to you tonight if you can see that the battle first started in heaven you can also see Amen that God was victorious there and if he was victorious there I believe that God will be victorious here and you can also see that there was some angels in heaven even the Bible says that they were elect angels amen and there was angels in heaven that stood with Michael Amen when he fought against Lucifer amen and I believe if there was angels in heaven even that were elected to stay with Michael amen against the lie the enemy amen and now the battle now started in heaven has come to the earth amen there's also a myth some humans on the earth even there's some people in the ER tonight that are elected of God to stay with Christ against the enemy tonight hallelujah amen do you believe that how many he's glad to be one of them oh yes Amen now we see in this great war that there's two powers Amen there's two powers really there's only two powers that are represented here and a power is the the capacity or the ability to direct or to influence the behavior of others or the course of events amen and brother BAM says in the greatest battle ever fought he says we've had Wars after wars and rumors of wars and if the earth stands we'll have plenty more wars but do you realize there's only really two powers in all the universe of all our differences between nations and differences between each other and everything it all mounts up to two powers there's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms all the rest the little minor things are connected to either one of those powers and those powers is God's power and Satan's power every war every disorder everything that comes alone is either controlled by God's power or Satan's power because that's the only two powers there is is the power of life and the power of death amen and Saint his power is a perverted power of God it's no real power it's a perversion of God's power everything Satan has death is only a perverted life a lies a treatments told adultery is an act misuse everything Satan has got it's something that's perverted but it is a power and we are here and and we are today sitting here and one or the other power is going to control us amen something is going to control you tonight what power the other even in this service tonight it's going to control you you're going to be influenced by either one of these powers tonight Amen so the prophecy so let's cast out the evil one and let's take our position like the stars of the heavens amen so as we look at this we begin to see there's two powers now you can call it whatever you want to right versus wrong wisdom versus faith fever or you know doubt versus faith or fear versus of love or you could you could give it all kind of names but in reality amen there's only two powers the power of God and the power Satan Amen so you recognize that tonight amen and so you're gonna be influenced by one of those powers Amen now I just would like to say that in this war or this conflict that we're in there's many battles amen and you know because there can be many battles within a war and and you're going through battles as a church and we're going through battles as the Bride of Christ and you know and there's you know for in others you know there's battles that we go through collectively as as a as a congregation but then aim in this war you got your own individual battles amen in the end so amen brother Bell says this he said to lose a battle is not to lose a war I don't know about the rest of y'all but that's encouraging to me because I for one have lost some battles but I have not lost the water hey I'm still here tonight amen listen I've got knocked down a few times but I didn't stay down is there anybody else that's been knocked down is there anybody else has lost a few battles along the way but the promise is to lose a battle is not to lose a warrior Patton lost several battles but he never lost the war that's right we'll lose a lot of battles too but will not lose the war hallelujah amen I'm encouraged by that Amen now remember amen there's a power of Satan the power of God now brother Branham there in the 55 he actually preached a series of sermons he preached the power Satan the power of God the power of decision even and in that one of those services there he says Satan does we do not want to be mistaken Satan has a power and that power is dead amen we see in Ephesians 6:12 we read where we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world and Ephesians 2 and 2 it says we're in times past we want the court according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so we can see even by the scripture that Satan has a power Amen but thank God there is a greater power than he has but how many believes there's a real devil how many can recognize tonight that Satan is real amen I know there's people out here trying to convince us that there ain't no real devil and there is no real demons and there is no you know and they're trying to you know just explain everything away and and take everything and they say that Satan you know I tell you maybe there's all kind of ideas and theories out there there's no real devil there's no real hell but I want to tell you there is a real devil he is real and he's got a power but if there's a real devil it's gotta be a real God and if Satan is real and he has a power I say God is more real and he has more power the power of God is greater than the power of the enemy amen the promise said the power of Satan is dead but the power of God is life amen and what is greater death or life I just I might get ahead of myself right here Bible go ahead and do it even you're gonna defeat the last enemy according this Bible there be a last enemy and that last enemy is death and it just so happens that you are our people that's anointed to defeat the last enemy you say brother how we ever going to do that because Amen Jesus the life of Jesus Christ defeated death 2,000 years ago and that same life will defeat death again hallelujah amen you're living in a time when the token life the literal life of Jesus Christ this is available evidence here it's not coming is here and that life will defeat this the power of the life of Christ is greater than the power of death do you believe that tonight Amen the probably just asked the question he said which is strong is life or death life which is stro is light or dark a lot even how many knows that light will always take supreme authority over darkness the only way that darkness can exist is for light to be absent come on darkness cannot overtake light the only way that darkness can exist is for light to leave that's why the church is in darkness that's why the world is in darkness because they put Christ on the outside hallelujah darkness could have never overtaken Amy where he was as long as life was there as long as life was there even the darkness could not overtake even the only way that darkness can exist is in the absence of light hallelujah so you can see that darkness cannot overtake or overtake light but this bill can be dark and you turn on a switch and light will always overtake the darkness hallelujah ôhe glad there's a man here that can turn on the light even listen even you might be here tonight and you're living in a world of darkness aiming your life's all covered up with sin and unbelief I got good news the ringing you there's a man here that can turn on the light hallelujah in just a moment he flipped a switch and we're darkness was black will exist because the power of God is greater than the power of the enemy [Applause] that's right God is much stronger the power of God is much stronger than the power of death because he's life he was spurt wick which was first life or death life now watch this amen the promises you got a weapon there to fight that sickness with it's in you God gave it to you why would you stand back like a coward why you'll stand on the sidelines let's follow the captain let's following the one that went to Calvary when he went to Calvary he was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were healed take what he gives you and fight sickness and sin fine unbelief away tell the devil he's alive I invite you to do it right now amen tell the devil he's alive well I tell you somebody needs to say it tonight aimin that Devils been telling you all kind of stuff a man is fighting always before you got here ain't me just take the opportunity tonight and tell the devil amen you're the promos that tell the devil is a liar Christ said he has overcome the world and greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world greater is the power of Christ in you than the sickness that you have in your body tonight greater is a power of Christ in you then that little bit setting sin that you can't overcome let's take that Holy Spirit and fight the devil down hallelujah how many like to do that tonight just take the Holy Spirit and fight the devil down and walk out victorious as heroes of the Cross Oh hallelujah amen that's what I want to do tonight first John four and for you I've got little children and over and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he tuss in the world you know what brother Brown said and how can overcome he said that's real overcoming first you gotta recognize that Satan is real and he is against you he said and then realize or recognize that greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world Oh hallelujah Amen listen friends amen you gotta first get a revelation that Christ is in you even you can't do that without a new birth even I'm convinced that some of us just need to get the Holy Ghost amen and recognize and realize even that greater is He that is in us than he that's in the world oh my hey watch what he said he that is in you greater what is he that was in David then the bear that stole his sheep greater is he that was in David than the line that come in and took one of his lambs greater was he that was in beta than the enemy amen listen I love our brother band with Taylor and you know here was glass standing out there and making his big boast and even telling all that he died but the promise said then words fell on the wrong ears that they hear come little David down there to the cap of Israel and he heard all that amen and they even begin to recognize something amen David I believe with all my heart David caught a revelation in 1st Samuel 17 and 45 and then David's then said David to the Felicity now coming to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the God of the armies of Israel whom thou has to find this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take that head from thee and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day under the fowls of the air and the wild beasts of the earth to all that all of the earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saith not with a sword and a spear for the battle is the Lord's hallelujah and He will give you into our hands I believe the revelation that David called was this ain't my battle this is God's battle I'm only here representing the side of the right and he is only here representing the side of the road so it don't matter how big he loots and how little I am a man I'm only represented all come on church David realized I'm not the one fighting this ain't my bad I might be small but I represent a big God I might be little but my god is great I might be weak but my God is strong and I don't care how big the daddy is my God's bigger I don't care how powerful he looks God's more powerful finally this ain't my battle this is God's battle hallelujah I love that revelation David Colt because David didn't get that revelation then go home sit on the couch come on church amen sometimes you start preaching you know this ain't your bow this is gone and we think well that's great so let's just sit down let God fine no David recognize this is God's battle but I happen to be here amen and God's gonna use somebody to defeat this enemy it might as well be me hallelujah God need some hands and God needs some feet and God needs somebody to believe his word amen stayed on the promises it might as well be us hallelujah this is God's battle tonight and Laodicea but we're here and God didn't call us to just sit down and be passive come on God didn't just call us to set on the pews to let the preachers do all the praying and the choirs do all the singing Amen have any cool Church a member you are here tonight to destroy the works of the devil that's what God told you to do that's what he commissioned you to do that's what he anointed you to do I say is there any Davis in this film tonight that will rise up and plea and say Amen I might be small I might be little but my god is great and this is not my battle this is his battle every enemy well come on his feet I seen a devil yet that could stand before my god cancer can do it lust came do it diabetes can't do it there ain't no devil name your name doctor said before the power of our God and His Christ because greater is He that is in you then heat us in the world [Applause] whoa thank you Jesus so powerful revelation when you begin to realize just st. my battle this is God's battle you know the children is okay maybe but I believe it was Jehoshaphat over there in second chronicles 20 there's three powers united against the children of israel they come to war against the children of israel Ava and Johanna or Judah rather and Joseph and king of Judah Amen you know Judah repre you know Judah means praise so now there's a great enemy coming to the war against praise Amen and Jehoshaphat when this went and listened they were outnumbered even go read your scripture they were outnumbered maybe the hearts were stacked against them but Jehoshaphat even caught a prayer meeting amen any-any assemble together all of the other of the children of Israel even both smiling great all of them the young ones old ones all of them got them all gathered up even they just decide to have Church you know what I think that's so amazing aiming that in their Time of Troubles they didn't ever come over to your house so fast fine mine you know thing man that is really things were really turned upside down and it seems like the Lord has forsaken us and everything is going wrong I think I'll just stay home you know I think I just lay out on Wednesday night he much seems like you know everything's went bad anyhow so I think you know I I'm kind of discouraged I just sit around the house know when everything was going wrong he said let's have a meeting let's have revival baby but don't you realize even all the all the armies are gathering up against you define yeah I think what we need to do is have Church even because we can't a man ain't it amazing that to us about never gathered all of his great generals together he didn't have a award meeting and putting the best military minds that he had together and try to come up with a plan to defeat the enemy he said let's have Church let's consult God let's see what God has to say about it apparently I'm right in the middle of all that even a young man begin to prophesy even Annie begin to tell them he says heart can you hold you need a whole you and happiness of Jerusalem amen and now King Jehoshaphat firt thus saith the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by the reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods tomorrow go ye down against them behold they have come up by the clip of Xia's and you shall find them at the end of the brit before the wilderness of Jarell and you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand you still and see the salvation of the Lord with you hold Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you now when you get home you can go read the rest of it you know what they did the Bible says they got up early amen do you realize they were outnumbered out man all the odds was against them amen and they were going down to a battle even it looked like it was impossible for them for them to win but they were so excited about it that they decided to get up early seemed like a good day to sleep in to me but they they decide to get up early and jehosophat say I tell you what we're gonna do any we're gonna sing the singers and the musicians out hallelujah and I want y'all to start praising God [Applause] amen and all the soldiers will follow and brother Browne said that's the order of God's army anyhow amen do you realize that's why we have church the way we do amen we started out with singing in music Amy you know what we're doing we're set in a battle in a reign hallelujah we can't ready to whip some Devils brother maybe that's why we're already singing and rejoicing because a battle is getting ready to take place and the Bible says while they were singing and praising God the Lord said and Bush was against the enemy and they began to kill one another and by the time the children ain't meant by the time Judah got down to the battlefield it was covered with dead bodies and none of them escaped the enemy was dead hi and they never drew a sword all they did was sing the praises of God and rejoice and lift their hands and ate and the word ain't God destroy their enemy I love you you know what I love about it even when they got down there front of them dead bodies God said now you go out there and get the spools and it took them three days to gather the spools of a battle that they never even drew a sword to fight brother that's how good your Guardians he said you just praise me and I'll fight your battles and when I get done destroying your enemy you can just gather all the spoils hi I say let's worship Him tonight let's praise Him tonight let's watch our God as a warrior tonight and when God is finished with this meeting are we gonna do it's just gather the swalls somebody's gonna get you joy back somebody's gonna get your health back somebody's gonna get your children back early because God it's destroyed our enemy and we forgetting us fools I say we got something to chat about we got some to single but we got some appraised I'll bet because while we're singing God is fighting just going crazy you know a that way because God takes an attack on your personal when the devil touches you you know what God God's attitude towards that is whatever you done to the least of these my little ones you've done it unto me I prove a table any wing take that scripture we take another scripture when when when Saul which became Paul was was met by an angel or the pillar of fire should say when when the pillar of fire come to Paul and he spoke the poet says he tells him I am Jesus whom thou persecuted I know now Paul never purchased you to Jesus in the flesh as a man anybody was persecuting the church but Jesus did not tell Paul amen I'm Jesus and you're persecuting my church he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecute us Eamon because when you persecute the church amen when the devil touches you God takes offense [Applause] excellent Exodus 23 20 by hold I send my angel before thee to keep you in a way to bring thee to the place I prepared beware vehement obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice how many won't so be the voice of the angel and do all that I speak then will even then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary under thy adversaries what a promise God is telling you even if you keep my word if you obey the voice of the angel oh brother I tell you that's why I don't care what they say about this message I don't let them criticize make fun I do whatever they want to do even I take this message even there's something in my heart I just want to say a man be it unto me according to thy word hallelujah even full of the Word of God entitles you to the token even and when you got that kind of attitude towards a towards the angel of the Lord Amen God is telling you even your enemy it's now my enemy and your adversary it's not my officer well I don't know what that does to the rest of y'all but I want to tell you what it does to me even when I realize even that my enemy is God's enemy I also realized I just got the victory hallelujah because I might not be able to defeat him I might not have the power to overcome him but my god is more than able hallelujah I love that my enemies using me God takes an offense when you're attacked he takes his attack on his self you know we got they got what they call NATO you know in this whole bunch of Nations they made an agreement if you're a part of that if you are a part of that agreement you're in that considered in that an attack on one is an attack on all and and because we're a part of NATO even if if they attack a foreign land ain't got nothing to do with us amen we are obligated and responsible to assist amen and we have to fight that enemy just like we have been attacked on our own soil oh brother I say if it's that way with NATO ever and I'm covenant that God that that that has nothing to do with God made by men Amen what about when you enter into a covenant with Christ amen when Satan attacks you God takes it personal but let's flip that over a little bit amen amen when somebody attacks this Bible it ought to be an offense to you when somebody attacks the name of Jesus Christ amen it ought to be an efficacy something on a rise up within you to stand against that spirit amen say brother that ain't my enter even the public all said everything that's anti word is your enemy anything that gets the word is your enemy I said direct quote by the way if it's against the word that's against you it's against your enemy hey but and if God takes it personal when you're attacked I believe that you and I ought to take it personal when he's attacked oh come on even I think they're not of Amen yeah yeah you know it ought to bother you when people start running this message down it ought to bother you when they start calling this prophet a false prophet amen and start talking about aiming the cloud and the pillar of fire even enough let me just tell you there's a lot of people escaping that stuff but I am not ashamed tonight tell me identify with a pillar of fire that was made visible in this last night I ashamed even to be identified with this message or the messenger I ain't embarrassed or ashamed to say tonight that William random was a prophet messenger this age and I certainly am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus classical it is the power of God unto salvation I ain't ashamed to sing in the name of Jesus I ain't ashamed of praying in the name of Jesus I'm not even ashamed to take on his name and water baptism [Applause] hallelujah when somebody starts they've been talking about my god you talking about this rich brother that's an attack on me take out a little bit a stepfather even when your brothers under attack come on I think we ought to adopt some of NATO's terms an attack on one is an attack on all come on friends amen we stand back sometimes you know watch a guy a men under him and the devil is really attacking him and all we can do is run him down and put him down amen he must done something to deserve it you know he had to do a man somebody he's a brother out here struggling as his church is really even having a hard time amen we just stand back say well I guess they done son you know Amen God must not be pleased with him may I tell you what Amen I might be true but I'm just going to say this tonight Amen we ought to have the spirit in us may be that when we see our brother down there's something in us want to lift him up anybody say brother were you talking about and say that was the Spirit of Christ in Abraham when he went after lot listen for his lot wasn't even the same category that Abraham was in LA was a penny and Abraham was a silver dollar even but it didn't make no difference to Abraham that was his brother anyhow and when the chips were down hey what's up man here took going restore his brother back [Applause] so spread of Christ in Moses let's stood in the gap if brother Tim's under attack I'm under attack listen if the devil is trying to stand and war against him in the work of God and this assembly Amen then I take it as an attack on our assembly and I know these brothers Amen that they this they'll stand behind me the same way a minute brother Ron's under attack I'm under attack a minute when the devil's attacking me and I'm in the cross crosshairs I know the men are praying for me Amen when I'm going through a hard time I know I got to do it's just asking there interceding in prayer amen brother that's how it's got to be in the local body that's how it's gotta be amen amen worldwide even we gotta recognize even that word one in Jesus Christ Haven an attack against what is an attack against all hallelujah amen I think we ought to a man adopt the military's attitude Amy ain't leavin no by behind no fallen soldiers a man we're leaving nobody on the field come on if it takes backing up a little bit we don't do that anyway if you take whatever get me wrong I mean we con compromise but what I'm saying is even if we got stopped a little while spit a little time do whatever is kind even we leaving no by behind come on church amen let's forget this attitude right now for no more even all this kind of even less even let I say we ought to stand out Moses Amen cuz Moses stood and Pharaoh gave him opportunity you go on out but Scott leave this you gotta leave that you're gonna leave this other day anybody I'll tell you what even we ain't going nowhere until everything that belongs to us goes with us we leave it one hook behind Anita hallelujah I say let the pastor's stand on that revelation amen brother we might not be able to take everybody in there but I'm gonna stand and preach Eli we can even in my attitude to the devil tonight is I believe it wouldn't look young person behind ain't leaving one muffled aha what daddy behind when we leave here maybe we ain't leaving nobody behind us we gonna leave no soldiers on the field [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh mercy I don't know what time I started said it's hard to tell when to stop I hope it's alright you see you got to know the tactics of your enemy how many said you got to know your enemy by the family he says he says you study your opponent you know he talks about a boxer and so forth and all this you studies like she studies movies you study what you do is you look what he done to others and you learn his tactics see the Prophet says see he says because we know the greatest battles going on right now and send the mind and what happened each stop for a moment that's all she had to do Satan had her caught and just reason it with her isn't that reasonable see his tactics what he's trying to do he's trying to anoint that precious woman there God's daughter with unbelief in God's Word that's exactly what he's trying to get her to do and that's why he's trying to get you to do honey brother Brown speaks to a sick sister there and and that's what he's trying to get each one of you to do out there anoint you and you're a free moral agent you can accept it if you want to but can't get out if Eve hadn't had stopped that moment don't to listen see don't stop for nothing don't stop when elijah toget Heiser said take my staff laid on the dead baby if a man speaks to you don't speak back he tries to stop you just keep right on going when you got the message keep going hallelujah I want to tell you tonight you got the message we're not waiting on a message we got the message keep going can I tell you a message from the Spirit of God tada Amen this is what the prophecy he said a message that the Spirit is saying to you move forward keep going don't stop for nothing hallelujah ain't better lay everything aside and just keep cutting through brother you got a sword in your hand just keep on chopping see Satan's army brings diseases God's army is commissioned to cast them out amen there you are every time Satan throws anything only God's army is to cast them out a man cast it out that's the very technique that God used Satan when he used the army of destruction to disbelieve God's Word and set up a better Kingdom than Michael had and God cast him out it's God's method is to cast out Amy what's brother been selling he's showing revelations 12 a man how did God handle in heaven he cast him out how did he handle it on the earth cast it out hello for his Michael cast him out of heaven when Jesus Christ was only on the earth even what did he do when he come to the man with a legion of devils he didn't leave him that way he cast him out hallelujah look maybe say why it's wonderful for God but what about us we'll just take this Luke chapter 10 in verse 1 after these things the Lord appointed other 70 also it sent him out two by two before his face into every city in place wherewith he himself would come verse 17 and the seventy returned again with joy saying Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning falling from heaven but hold I give unto your pyre the turtles serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing by any means a man shall hurt you Amen is that right even though that notice is even he said notwithstanding he me rejoice not that the spirits are certainly on you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven so we know what to rejoice about tonight how many knows your names written in heaven but notice this Jesus aim a commission or sent them out amen and what did he send them out to do he gave them power to cast out the enemy Francis is powerful because this is before the blood was shed this was before Pentecost this is before the Holy Ghost come and brother Graham says amen immediately after Jesus gave His disciples power against unclean spirits and they went casting out Devils he sent them out two by two and as you go preach the kingdom of heaven heal the sick cast out devils and they come back rejoicing happily and he said rejoice not because the Devils are subject unto you but rejoice because your names are written in heaven he said - hail Satan falling from heaven like lightning see the power of that church moving forward had just upset the whole kingdom of Satan you see any Psalm dropped from his places because God had again given power to his church to go out and he beheld him falling like lightning from heaven amen the power of that church anybody said I give you power over unclean spirits and that really upset the kingdom of Satan and what could we do with today notice frenzy 70 was commissioned by the Lord and sent out amen and given power over unclean spirits and even Jesus testified I beheld Satan falling from heaven like lightning under the power of that Commission group that was sent out and that was before Calvary or the Holy Ghost amen and the prophet of God said if they could do that then what can we do tonight hallelujah Amy listen church amen we just st. got a little anointing on us Amy we ain't just got a made a hands laid on us but the Holy Ghost is self a man it's here tonight Christ is here maybe he's hit the believer hey man listen even the blood Hema has prevailed tonight and the power is in you if they can upset the kingdom of Satan Amen with just that Commission what can we do tonight under mark 16 hallelujah these sons chef I don't know what y'all's Bible says but mine says chef they don't say maybe it might even could happen these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it will not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover as it is I need the commission of a prophet that's not a commission of the pastor that's not that is your commission how many believers during hey come on ashamed of it lift your hand how many believers anything say brother how I know I'm a believer do you believe that's what believers do Amen if you believe tonight Amen you're a believer mark 16 applies to youth these signs shall follow them that believe me but how many believes that maybe you are commissioned to cast out devils even you can say get away from me Amen what brother is saying the greatest battle he said take and wipe the devil and then if we don't move just go home and quit I mean if you try it one time it don't work then that must mean there's something wrong or something you know just get back the devil and if we don't move just give up any what he said he said why the devil whack he said cut him in the cutting with a word whether it be a demon whether it be an enemy whether it be sickness whether it be disease whatever it is take the word poor with a sword and whacking the first time if it don't seem to move whack it again and walk it again and walk it again and watch it until you chip a hole through hallelujah and then say where's the next one you know I fell around said it he said how did grant take Richmond he said just as he come to it is that right how did he take it just as he come to it you say how in the world we ever gonna get out of here how in the world are we ever gonna overcome how in the world we ever gonna feet the spirits of Laodicea just as we come to it brother one step at a time maybe I tell you what you need to do tonight it's put one foot in front of the other and just keep on moving and keep on walking and when the spirit rises up whacking if we don't move the first time like him again we don't go back whack him again and just keep old whacking him until you whack him out your way and then look for the next one amen brother I tell you if we have to defeat the devil one devil at a time let's just do it one devil at a time hallelujah if some of you are here tonight and you got all kind of spirits warned against you why don't you just start with one hallelujah even maybe got pride jealousy lust everything else maybe just start with one tonight and whack him and let's defeat one devil tonight and we'll get another tomorrow and another one oh come on hey before you know it you might get along tonight if I have to do it one at a time we'll do it one at a time hallelujah a me but let's just keep walking i doing whack the devil down you gotta study you gotta know your opponent rummy you know it's pretty I'll just give a little testimony you know God God God's such a good guy I thank God for every one of these brothers here and I tell you brother brother brother Tim's just I just love and respect him so much and look up to him and all these brothers temped he's just a just a dear friend of my heartening and brother Wayne I had over the years he's just been so close and and the way that the Lord just brought us together it's just supernatural and and and you know a lot of people don't would never know this but I was studying that door was dealing my heart on this thought some time back I was going there's just a lot of stuff you know going on I was young people coming up and had prayer and I seen what a battle that they were in the Lord just started dealing with me and and I took a series I don't remember how many was some of these poor people having to hear this stuff again but but but you know what was Supernatural about it his brother Wayne had been I don't remember where he's at he's somewhere overseas and he was overseas and he was coming back home and he pick up the phone to call me and somehow in the conversation we just got talking about something and he mentioned a certain sermon or something somehow it got brought up and I Savannah I was just preaching and I told him entitled my sermon he said you got to be kidding me he said man that is exactly what the Lord has put on my heart I think he was just getting ready to preach it that night or something like that and in and we just kept talking I said you know I said man I went I was listening to three sermons really around preaching the fifty five the power of Satan the power he said I listen them on the plane and it was so it was so supernatural Hal and and I said he said what was you getting out of I said well well in the main points I was really seeing was that the conflict is not between you and Satan but between God and Satan this is not this battle didn't start with you I mean this battle is not you're not alone in this war he's a man that's it's incredible because that's one of the very things that he was seeing out of it it was just amazing and in the conversation or it might have been I think was in that conversation he mentioned something about Muhammad Ali which trucker we were just talking to a fellowship struck a chord to me I went and started start looking at it and and you know it was some amazing about Muhammad Ali when he fought George Foreman you know in that in that by in that fight you realize that Muhammad Ali was a four-to-one underdog he was an underdog in that fight but but there was he realized he could not overpower George Foreman he had to outsmart him he had studied his opponent to the place he recognized in realism but he realized something that was very good that was very powerful for him because he realized this man ain't never went past six rounds of course everybody else looked at that and thought man they saw it and was afraid by it because George Foreman was undefeated he never went past six rounds because he hadn't knocked everybody else out by then but but Muhammad Ali began to realize he ain't used to going the distance so I all I gotta do is wear him out and outlast him and so you know the day come to the rumble in the jungle humming neighs you know here it comes they was gonna fight it out and here's it the great the great fight I mean you know at that time is one of the greatest sporting events has it ever happened and and they begin to fight and Holly just laid on the ropes and for six solid rounds he took punch after punch after punch after punch and he was late on them ropes and he went roll with the punches a man just took them licks and aiming Foreman was just beating him up I remember in that seventh round aiming there was all these even lay on the ropes and and Foreman was looking for that knockout punch because he began to realize I'm wearing down I got knocked this guy out I don't want to say going to the scorecards I need to knock this guy out so he ripped went up there and he got a good lick in on Holly amen and later on all the admitted it hurt real bad but at that time you know what he done he looked right at George Foreman he said George is that all you got is that the best you guys how you can do a mean look right straight I says that the best you can do amen and George Foreman lost the battle right there because he realized that he is the best I got that is all I got ami and Ollie when told to knock the guy out you know what he did he outlasted him hallelujah and I want to tell you this tonight Eamon this bride this Church of the Living God even as took leak after leak after leak for six solid church ages she has been knocked around and beat up finally but here we are in the seventh round I believe some of you tonight just need to look right at that devil and say devil is that all you got is that the best you got devil hallelujah brother he might uh give you some licks and they might hurt but you're still standing hallelujah George Foreman couldn't figure it out he said I'll hit him came in with a left hand I've hit it with a rock head I give him everything I got and he's still standing and the devil don't know what to think about you tonight he has hit you with every weapon out of hell he sent you in every spirit of discouragement and depression but you're still here Harley you're still standing and I want to tell the devil tonight devil we're gonna outlast you because when there is no more devil you don't still be where there is no more depression he'll still be when sickness is gold hallelujah whatever treatment is cast into the lake of fire this bride will still remain because greater is He that is in you that keen us in the world no wonder the prophet of God calls you an invincible army your eyes he called you an invincible army Ayman do you know what invisible means it means bulletproof impregnable indomitable insurmountable a man invulnerable unbeatable unstoppable unquenchable [Applause] that's the stuff you're made out of whoa brother the devil

over are solved do you realize you're an equation the devil kate's off [Applause] you're a problem the devil can't solve you're a mystery now he just can't figure out a man unstoppable a man you're
