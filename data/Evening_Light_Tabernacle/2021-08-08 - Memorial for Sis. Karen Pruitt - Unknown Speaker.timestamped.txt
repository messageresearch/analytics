[1:02:27] and wiped our tears away
[1:02:31] stepped in and saved the day
[1:02:34] but once again i say
[1:02:38] amen and it's still

[1:04:11] and as the thunder rolls i
[1:04:14] barely hear you whisper through the rain

[1:04:27] hands
[1:04:28] and praise the gods
[1:04:44] you are who you are
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:07] in this storm
[1:05:14] i lift my eyes to the hills

[1:05:20] my help comes from the lord the maker
[1:05:24] of heaven lift your voice now i lift my
[1:05:28] eyes into the hills where does my help
[1:05:32] come
[1:05:32] from my health comes from the lord
[1:05:36] the maker of heaven and earth
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:06:02] oh

[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:30] praise
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:44] is
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:54] hallelujah can you do that this morning
[1:07:04] so many times i've questioned
[1:07:08] certain circumstances
[1:07:11] of things i could not understand
[1:07:18] and many times in trials
[1:07:21] weakness blurs my vision
[1:07:24] and my frustration gets so out of hand
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:30] oh it's then i am reminded
[1:07:34] that i've never been forsaken
[1:07:37] i've never had to stand on one test
[1:07:43] and as i look at all the victories
[1:07:47] the spirit rises up in me and it's
[1:07:50] through the fire my weakness is
[1:07:53] made strong
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:08:07] it would not be hard to
[1:08:10] climb
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:13] he never offered your victories without
[1:08:17] fighting but he said help would always
[1:08:21] come
[1:08:22] in time
[1:08:25] just remember when you're standing
[1:08:28] in the boundary of decision and the
[1:08:32] adversary says give it
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:43] and he will take you through the fire
[1:08:51] well again know within myself that i
[1:08:54] was surely paris but if i
[1:08:58] trust the hand of god
[1:09:11] that the cross would not get heavy
[1:09:14] heavy here would not be hard to
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:27] he said help would always come inside
[1:09:34] just remember when you're standing
[1:09:37] in the valley of decision and the
[1:09:41] adversary says
[1:09:52] and he will take you through the power
[1:09:56] again
[1:09:57] so churches
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:05] and he will take you through the fire
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:14] again
[1:10:28] oh
[1:10:35] can you see this
[1:10:44] when you finally
[1:10:47] make your entrance to
[1:10:53] that city
[1:10:59] of jasper walls
[1:11:02] and bright golden and
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:09] that's where she's at
[1:11:12] as you behold all
[1:11:16] it's beauty and
[1:11:20] it's splendors
[1:11:26] there's just one request
[1:11:30] sister karen we'd all like to make
[1:11:34] from you
[1:11:38] look for me
[1:11:42] for i will be
[1:11:45] there too
[1:11:49] you want to make that promise to me i
[1:11:52] really

[1:12:07] [Music]

[1:12:47] that are waiting there for you
[1:12:55] but when you feel you've shared
[1:12:58] your story with

[1:13:07] who wants to hear you
[1:13:10] tell just how you've
[1:13:13] made it through
[1:13:18] sister karen look for me
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:22] oh for i wanna hear it too
[1:13:32] i realize when you
[1:13:37] ride there'll be so
[1:13:40] much to view
[1:13:44] after you've been there
[1:13:47] ten thousand years
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:13:57] for me
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:08] look for me
[1:14:13] for i will be
[1:14:17] there too
[1:14:33] i want to speak to you for a few minutes
[1:14:35] today
[1:14:37] on karen pruitt
[1:14:41] a virtuous woman
[1:14:46] proverbs 31 10 says
[1:14:50] who can find a virtuous woman
[1:14:55] for her price is far above
[1:14:59] rubies the question
[1:15:03] who can find is not that
[1:15:08] such women are non-existent
[1:15:13] but they are to be greatly admired
[1:15:19] because they're worth their value
[1:15:22] not only to god but to their family
[1:15:25] to their church family are of such
[1:15:29] great price
[1:15:32] they are very rare
[1:15:35] now among this group of believers today
[1:15:39] i don't think they would be as rare as
[1:15:41] they would be in walmart or
[1:15:44] someplace like that because one of your
[1:15:46] sisters get there and
[1:15:47] you see all the eyes that are on you
[1:15:50] they know that you are rare
[1:15:52] and unusual and today we have a
[1:15:54] gathering of
[1:15:56] very many of those rarities but when
[1:15:59] solomon wrote this this
[1:16:01] book of proverbs and it calls his name
[1:16:04] solomon had several names but
[1:16:06] in this chapter 31 he was identified as
[1:16:09] lemuel
[1:16:11] and there was only one woman in the
[1:16:14] bible that was actually
[1:16:15] attributed with this great attribute of
[1:16:18] being
[1:16:19] virtuous and that was the woman called
[1:16:22] ruth
[1:16:24] sarah's great issue was mary mary
[1:16:26] magdalene different ones but again
[1:16:28] ruth was identified as being a virtuous
[1:16:31] woman the word virtue is one that is
[1:16:33] strong
[1:16:34] and has something that emanates from her
[1:16:36] being now that's not the same thing of
[1:16:38] course as being a dominating female
[1:16:41] but it is something that comes from an
[1:16:43] inward
[1:16:44] something and solomon i remember this
[1:16:47] man
[1:16:48] had a thousand wives
[1:16:51] so it's not like that he wasn't a
[1:16:53] professional dealing with women
[1:16:57] to my life i i can't understand why one
[1:16:59] man would want that many
[1:17:01] wives anyway that's a sermon for another
[1:17:04] day
[1:17:06] but solomon knew
[1:17:10] many of those marriages were made on
[1:17:12] political agendas
[1:17:14] to make his kingdom strong but there was
[1:17:17] still a search
[1:17:20] for a virtuous one we know that solomon
[1:17:24] did find one he found her in the north
[1:17:26] country and
[1:17:27] he was up there surveying the northern
[1:17:29] part of his kingdom and
[1:17:31] he saw her out as she was a shepherdist
[1:17:33] of course
[1:17:34] and she was what we call a shulamite or
[1:17:37] the hebrew word is shula smith
[1:17:40] shulamite is the feminist form
[1:17:44] of solomon and he
[1:17:47] found one that one day so smoked his
[1:17:50] heart
[1:17:51] she was the very epitome here of
[1:17:54] proverbs 31 and we know that this is a
[1:17:56] type of course of the bride of christ
[1:17:59] but i believe sister karen pruitt
[1:18:02] was a virtuous woman
[1:18:06] he said who can find a virtuous woman
[1:18:08] for her price
[1:18:10] is far above rubies
[1:18:14] he says the heart of her husband
[1:18:17] doth safely trust in her
[1:18:21] so that he shall have no need of spoil
[1:18:26] that's right not only can brother tim
[1:18:30] say that today but every
[1:18:31] brother here that has this type of wife
[1:18:33] can say the same thing
[1:18:36] you know whenever you look at this
[1:18:38] solomon is writing from the
[1:18:40] epitome of experience and something that
[1:18:43] apparently he had been greatly affected
[1:18:45] by the daughter of pharaoh
[1:18:47] and some of these other wives that he
[1:18:49] had taken
[1:18:50] and he was having to take away from
[1:18:54] being the king that he was supposed to
[1:18:56] be
[1:18:57] to take care of so many marital problems
[1:19:01] and so many issues in his own home
[1:19:05] but somehow he knew there was a woman
[1:19:09] that if he could ever find that one
[1:19:12] that she would not pull away from what
[1:19:15] he was supposed to be
[1:19:17] but she would actually compliment and
[1:19:20] make him
[1:19:21] even more effective than what he was
[1:19:24] and in looking at this he said the heart
[1:19:26] of her husband
[1:19:27] does safely trust in her so he doesn't
[1:19:30] have to hire a detective
[1:19:32] to follow her around he doesn't really
[1:19:35] need
[1:19:36] an app on her phone to make sure that
[1:19:38] she's where she's supposed to be
[1:19:40] but her heart can his heart rather can
[1:19:43] safely trust in her
[1:19:45] so that he shall have no need of spoil
[1:19:49] why because she is actually
[1:19:52] his crown this kind of a woman
[1:19:57] is truly an asset to a man
[1:20:01] and not a liability
[1:20:04] she is a gift that no other gifts could
[1:20:07] ever
[1:20:08] replace and this is as we are here today
[1:20:11] and we are so
[1:20:12] grateful for sister karen's victory
[1:20:14] being completed but
[1:20:16] actually because of we are still here in
[1:20:19] mortal realms
[1:20:20] we're kind of pulled between two
[1:20:22] dimensions
[1:20:24] there's a part of us that's been
[1:20:25] affected by the heavenly dimension and
[1:20:27] we've felt
[1:20:28] surges of it as it's came by today
[1:20:32] but there's another dimension that we
[1:20:34] are affected by and this this one in
[1:20:36] time
[1:20:37] the lord jesus stood at the tomb that
[1:20:39] day of lazarus and
[1:20:40] he knew in a few moments he would raise
[1:20:42] him from the dead but he allowed himself
[1:20:45] so to
[1:20:46] enter in by his emotions and his
[1:20:48] feelings
[1:20:49] into the realm of deaths and he knew it
[1:20:52] was only a moment but i'm so glad that
[1:20:54] he did
[1:20:55] it so that he would be able to be a high
[1:20:58] priest that when we lose someone so dear
[1:21:00] and so close
[1:21:01] we go to him and he can say i understand
[1:21:06] i really do and the shortest verse in
[1:21:09] the bible
[1:21:10] jesus wept so it's not a sin to cry
[1:21:14] but we also know that the victory that
[1:21:16] our sister has attained to
[1:21:18] requires more than crying it is worthy
[1:21:21] of such great rejoicing
[1:21:24] i want you to notice that whenever
[1:21:26] solomon said this about her she will do
[1:21:28] him good
[1:21:29] and not evil all the days of her life
[1:21:33] this woman she is such an asset into the
[1:21:37] life
[1:21:37] of this man and now he's speaking of
[1:21:40] course of the state before the children
[1:21:42] have come along but she is constantly
[1:21:44] faithful
[1:21:45] to help this man and everything that
[1:21:48] he's called to do and we know that the
[1:21:50] prophet said it over and over again
[1:21:52] that behind every good man is a good
[1:21:55] woman
[1:21:56] brother branham said it even about his
[1:21:58] own wife if there was ever anything good
[1:22:00] that come out of the branham family
[1:22:02] he said it should be attributed to his
[1:22:04] wife now people probably saw
[1:22:06] that he was just being complementary and
[1:22:09] being nice but
[1:22:10] i believe our prophet was speaking great
[1:22:12] words of wisdom
[1:22:14] i personally feel like that pastors
[1:22:17] wives
[1:22:17] ministers wives are some of the greatest
[1:22:20] unsung heroes that there are on the face
[1:22:24] of the earth now we know that the gift
[1:22:27] in the man's life
[1:22:28] is what of course gives him
[1:22:29] understanding to the word
[1:22:31] and helps him to be able to preach and
[1:22:33] his wife of course doesn't have that
[1:22:35] but whenever he's setting their studying
[1:22:37] and laboring and trying to bring
[1:22:39] something to god
[1:22:40] his wife many times is praying for him
[1:22:42] and feeling the burden
[1:22:44] and she's there and has to give up her
[1:22:46] time it has to give up so many
[1:22:48] things and let me tell you something
[1:22:50] sisters when the lord jesus calls these
[1:22:52] men of god
[1:22:53] that have stood around the world and
[1:22:55] they've preached and they prayed for the
[1:22:57] sick
[1:22:57] and they've cast out devils you remember
[1:22:59] brother branham's dream when he's going
[1:23:01] to stand before the lord
[1:23:03] as great as his position was god
[1:23:06] would not let him walk up there by
[1:23:09] himself
[1:23:10] but brother branham had personal
[1:23:12] attendees and it was
[1:23:14] one wife on one arm and one on the other
[1:23:17] arm can you imagine
[1:23:18] elijah the fulfillment of malachi 4
[1:23:21] and he's going to stand up there but god
[1:23:24] did not want him to come by himself
[1:23:27] he wanted his queens to walk up there
[1:23:30] by him solomon went on to say in verse
[1:23:33] 13
[1:23:34] she seeketh wool and flax and work us
[1:23:37] willingly with her hands she is like
[1:23:41] the merchant ships she bringeth her food
[1:23:44] from afar now
[1:23:45] he's speeding speaking metaphorically of
[1:23:48] the woman and we know of course
[1:23:49] in this time of era even the women of
[1:23:52] the hebrew women
[1:23:53] could not be able to do many of these
[1:23:56] things that he was attributing to her
[1:23:58] but is taking her position that she had
[1:24:01] and showing how industrious that she
[1:24:04] really was
[1:24:05] her husband did not feel threatened by
[1:24:08] this
[1:24:08] because she was not trying to be the
[1:24:11] head of the home
[1:24:12] she was just found what she was supposed
[1:24:14] to be
[1:24:15] and he deemed her as being very
[1:24:18] complementary
[1:24:19] to what he was he said she rises
[1:24:23] also while it is yet night and give us
[1:24:26] meat to her household
[1:24:28] and a portion to her maiden she
[1:24:30] considereth the field
[1:24:31] now this would have not been allowed of
[1:24:33] course in their day
[1:24:34] she considers the field and bias it and
[1:24:37] with the fruit of the fields
[1:24:39] she planteth a vineyard she girdles her
[1:24:42] loins
[1:24:43] with strengths and strengthen us her
[1:24:46] arms
[1:24:47] she perceiveth that her merchandise
[1:24:50] is good her candle goeth
[1:24:53] out not by night the fact that her lamp
[1:24:56] did not goes out proves that this was a
[1:24:59] very diligent woman she was as the wise
[1:25:01] virgin
[1:25:02] of course in matthew chapter 25 verse 1
[1:25:05] then shall the kingdom of heaven
[1:25:06] be likened unto ten virgins five were
[1:25:09] wise and five were foolish five of them
[1:25:11] of course took oil
[1:25:12] and five did so here he's likening this
[1:25:14] wife
[1:25:15] to being this type of a woman she was an
[1:25:18] industrious type
[1:25:19] of individual she was not slothful she
[1:25:22] was not
[1:25:23] lazy but she had found her spot now
[1:25:26] all of us of course that knew sister
[1:25:29] karen knew that she was not the mayor of
[1:25:31] homer
[1:25:32] she was not the governor of louisiana
[1:25:34] she was not the vice
[1:25:36] president of the united states for her
[1:25:39] to have been called such a thing it
[1:25:41] would have been
[1:25:42] a slander
[1:25:45] why she was a daughter of god
[1:25:48] that knew her position and it's not in
[1:25:51] the white house
[1:25:53] telling mr biden what to do now i
[1:25:55] realize he does need somebody to tell
[1:25:57] him what to do
[1:25:59] but it was not supposed to be a woman
[1:26:02] to for sister karen to have been
[1:26:05] called the mayor of homer you you would
[1:26:09] have been better off to smack her in the
[1:26:10] face to call her
[1:26:12] the governor of louisiana she found her
[1:26:16] place
[1:26:17] the queen of this man's heart but she
[1:26:22] was not just restricted to being
[1:26:24] brother tim's queen but she was a great
[1:26:27] mother to her children
[1:26:29] to her grandchildren and to you church
[1:26:32] family
[1:26:34] it's not just the pruitt family that we
[1:26:36] say when i say lost you understand what
[1:26:38] i mean
[1:26:40] it's not just them that has lost someone
[1:26:42] but this church family has lost
[1:26:45] a very great great matriarch of faith
[1:26:49] one that that will never be replaced
[1:26:52] it's not like he's looking this morning
[1:26:54] but an individual like this can never
[1:26:58] be replaced will it be difficult i'm
[1:27:01] going to tell you
[1:27:02] it will there will be days come that you
[1:27:05] just think lord
[1:27:07] why why you know that that's that's not
[1:27:09] sinful
[1:27:10] you see this is something that people
[1:27:12] don't understand i think about the lord
[1:27:14] jesus
[1:27:14] that he was here he wanted to so partake
[1:27:18] of our humanity he allowed himself
[1:27:21] not only to say why but to
[1:27:25] feel why my god
[1:27:29] my god why
[1:27:33] why you see why
[1:27:36] is a powerful little word and we all ask
[1:27:39] it at one time or another
[1:27:40] and it's not necessarily sin when you
[1:27:43] ask it
[1:27:44] it's how you ask it when we ask it with
[1:27:47] an attitude and we're
[1:27:49] you know letting on as if so we know
[1:27:51] more about the plan of god than god does
[1:27:53] that is when we get in trouble but the
[1:27:56] lord jesus didn't just
[1:27:57] frame this three-letter word how many
[1:27:59] other letters it was in the hebrew
[1:28:01] but he allowed himself to feel why
[1:28:04] how many has felt why before why and you
[1:28:07] just didn't ask it
[1:28:09] but you actually felt why
[1:28:13] you see a person like this solomon goes
[1:28:16] on to say
[1:28:17] she lays her hands to the spindle
[1:28:21] and her hands hold the disc staff
[1:28:25] now he's actually quoting here what
[1:28:27] would have been in the time frame before
[1:28:29] the spinning wheel was actually
[1:28:31] invented by man so he's relating that
[1:28:34] she
[1:28:35] found whatever was there available for
[1:28:38] the time of the age
[1:28:39] now i know that we've certainly not been
[1:28:41] the only sisters that have lived down
[1:28:44] through time
[1:28:45] that were women of virtue martin luther
[1:28:47] in his time
[1:28:48] frame wesleyan the pentecostals they had
[1:28:50] great ladies
[1:28:51] but they were not given the same
[1:28:54] equipment that you sisters were
[1:28:56] we know that martin luther drank beer
[1:28:58] and you know smoked and this and that
[1:29:00] and the other and the ladies of that day
[1:29:02] were not the same caliber of the sisters
[1:29:05] that we have sitting here
[1:29:07] and this is why satan hates you he hates
[1:29:10] you
[1:29:10] your young sisters he hates you he wants
[1:29:13] to take
[1:29:13] your virtue from you but don't you let
[1:29:16] him have it
[1:29:18] and don't you when you get married
[1:29:20] sisters don't you feel like that you're
[1:29:21] no longer
[1:29:22] you know you can compare to the world
[1:29:24] that's right you no longer compare to
[1:29:26] them
[1:29:27] and you no longer want to compare to
[1:29:29] them
[1:29:30] because you have something that the word
[1:29:33] of god describes that's so much better
[1:29:35] than anything
[1:29:36] they will ever have as i was setting and
[1:29:39] the lord had placed this on my heart in
[1:29:41] a setting last night studying and
[1:29:43] brother
[1:29:43] tim had came in the room where i was at
[1:29:46] and there was a little table setting
[1:29:47] there
[1:29:48] in a little small bible that folded up
[1:29:51] and he said
[1:29:52] this is karen's bible i said oh my he
[1:29:55] said yeah this is hers if you'd
[1:29:57] like to pick it up and just thumb
[1:29:59] through it
[1:30:00] so everybody was preparing for bed and i
[1:30:03] picked up sister karen's bible i turn
[1:30:07] over to proverbs 31
[1:30:11] the place that she had underlined was
[1:30:14] verse 10 where i was going to start
[1:30:17] and i had several verses that i was
[1:30:19] going to go down through and i
[1:30:21] looked down through those verses to see
[1:30:23] how far she had read
[1:30:25] but i had kind of messed up a little bit
[1:30:29] because there was one verse i wasn't
[1:30:31] going to include
[1:30:33] but as i looked down and i kept on
[1:30:35] reading
[1:30:36] i found the crown
[1:30:41] i found the crowning and sister karen
[1:30:43] would underline one verse and then she'd
[1:30:45] miss a verse or two or three and then
[1:30:47] she
[1:30:48] should underline another you know how we
[1:30:50] are certain things that stick out to us
[1:30:52] and
[1:30:52] so she hadn't underlined the next to the
[1:30:54] last one but
[1:30:56] she had underlined the last now you're
[1:30:57] wondering where it's at but just give me
[1:30:59] a few minutes i'm not quite ready for it
[1:31:00] yet but i
[1:31:02] thought lord as i speak tomorrow
[1:31:05] i'm not going to be speaking about a
[1:31:09] person
[1:31:10] that just memorized some verses
[1:31:13] and i thought god what an honor you've
[1:31:15] given me
[1:31:17] to be able to stand and speak about a
[1:31:19] daughter of god that the word
[1:31:21] was so personal to her it was made flesh
[1:31:26] it was made flesh and you sisters don't
[1:31:29] feel like you have a lot to do
[1:31:31] brother branham called you the fifth
[1:31:34] gospel
[1:31:35] matthew mark luke
[1:31:39] john and mother
[1:31:43] think of it he didn't even call us
[1:31:45] brothers that
[1:31:47] mother watch this as we go on
[1:31:52] in verse 20 he says she stretcheth out
[1:31:55] her hand to the poor
[1:31:57] yea she reaches forth her hands to the
[1:32:00] needy
[1:32:01] she's not afraid of the snow for her
[1:32:04] household
[1:32:05] for all her household are clothed
[1:32:10] with scarlet i believe that
[1:32:14] the family has a great great thing to
[1:32:17] attribute to brother tim being a godly
[1:32:20] man
[1:32:20] and a great minister and a prince among
[1:32:23] preachers
[1:32:24] but also believe that sister can
[1:32:27] attributed a great
[1:32:28] deal to this family here the natural
[1:32:32] thing of course was scarded and if you
[1:32:34] understand much about
[1:32:35] the scarlet colors and the purple the
[1:32:38] tyrannian purple was the
[1:32:40] most expensive actually the
[1:32:43] linen and the flax that they would have
[1:32:45] used to make their garments out of
[1:32:47] the flax would have come from the plant
[1:32:50] that was grown on the river now
[1:32:52] it was worth more it was more
[1:32:55] valuable than gold
[1:32:59] this woman had found somehow
[1:33:03] access into scarlet
[1:33:06] the tyrannian purple and the scarlet was
[1:33:10] taken from
[1:33:11] a shellfish something like a mollusk
[1:33:14] and they would take hundreds and
[1:33:16] hundreds of them
[1:33:18] each little shellfish would produce
[1:33:21] one drop of dye
[1:33:24] so they'd have to work and work and
[1:33:26] another was a coxacillus
[1:33:28] which was a certain oak tree and they
[1:33:32] would take those
[1:33:33] certain parts of that tree that oak
[1:33:35] plant
[1:33:36] and they would take them and grind them
[1:33:38] and it would take bushels and bushels
[1:33:41] of those to be able to produce the color
[1:33:46] but when you saw a person dressed and
[1:33:49] tyrinian
[1:33:50] purple or scarlet or red
[1:33:53] you knew they were a person of great
[1:33:57] means because the common people could
[1:34:00] not wear it
[1:34:02] you see we're not just different from
[1:34:04] the world because
[1:34:07] our women dress different and our men
[1:34:09] dress different
[1:34:10] and we use quotes you know and things
[1:34:12] like that
[1:34:13] but it's because the price was paid so
[1:34:16] extensively
[1:34:18] for our garments we're able to stand
[1:34:20] today and preach the gospel
[1:34:22] because people foreran us
[1:34:26] these three daughters here that come
[1:34:28] from this matriarch
[1:34:31] and her son which she loves so much
[1:34:34] this legacy will be handed on down and
[1:34:37] sister karen made it easier for you
[1:34:39] daughters
[1:34:41] they will be clothed in scarlet
[1:34:44] and they themselves will have the
[1:34:46] ability to spin
[1:34:48] on the reveal word of the hour to take
[1:34:52] the acoxazillus
[1:34:54] and through the strenuous work and labor
[1:34:56] and the reproach
[1:34:58] and be able to manifest and continue
[1:35:00] this legacy
[1:35:02] as it keeps going she makes her
[1:35:05] self-coverings of tapestry
[1:35:08] her clothing is silk and purple
[1:35:12] evidences of her family as well oh the
[1:35:15] fruit family needless to say
[1:35:17] they would be nothing like the
[1:35:19] rockefellers
[1:35:20] they would be nothing like many people
[1:35:23] like that
[1:35:24] i would rather have their wealth than
[1:35:26] john paul getty
[1:35:27] i'd rather have their wealth than the
[1:35:29] owner of amazon
[1:35:31] his amazon stuff will do no good when he
[1:35:33] stands before the lord jesus
[1:35:35] they wouldn't be considered in one of
[1:35:37] their wealth his family know about it no
[1:35:38] doubt in claiborne parish
[1:35:40] but the way god looks at it a daughter
[1:35:42] of god was able to be carried across the
[1:35:45] breach of time
[1:35:46] and step out of that old ship of zion
[1:35:49] and closed in a theophany
[1:35:53] body you see when those who raise in the
[1:35:56] second resurrection
[1:35:58] and they stand before the white throne
[1:36:01] we know the reason
[1:36:02] of their condemnation is because the
[1:36:05] clothes
[1:36:07] they have on you see for those who raise
[1:36:11] and they raise in the same body they
[1:36:14] send
[1:36:14] in their clothes
[1:36:17] condemn them don't you understand when a
[1:36:21] saint of god
[1:36:23] moves into that theophany they have
[1:36:26] attained
[1:36:28] to the very attribute of the fullness of
[1:36:30] god
[1:36:31] and their clothes prove who they
[1:36:34] are she make us find
[1:36:38] linen and sell us it and deliver us
[1:36:40] girdles unto the merchant
[1:36:42] strength and honor are her closing
[1:36:47] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[1:36:50] so metaphorically the clothes are
[1:36:53] identified
[1:36:54] with her traits and her characteristics
[1:36:57] now
[1:36:57] sister cam was not a flamboyant woman
[1:37:00] she was not a pushy type of woman
[1:37:03] sister karen and my wife carol were a
[1:37:06] lot alike
[1:37:08] both of them were not very forward and
[1:37:12] they felt backward and
[1:37:13] quiet and misunderstood by a lot of
[1:37:16] people in reality
[1:37:18] they were not the type that had to be
[1:37:20] heard by everybody
[1:37:23] but i just imagine when she stepped out
[1:37:26] of that old ship of zion
[1:37:29] and put her foot up on the bank and
[1:37:32] started running her hands through that
[1:37:33] bluegrass
[1:37:35] and the lord god sent someone down by
[1:37:38] the river
[1:37:40] if she was able to look down
[1:37:43] my hands aren't bruised
[1:37:47] her clothes declared who she was
[1:37:56] she opened her mouth with wisdom and in
[1:37:59] her tongue
[1:38:01] is the law of kindness
[1:38:04] she looketh well to the ways of her
[1:38:07] household
[1:38:08] and he does not the bread of vitalness
[1:38:11] is this right children
[1:38:13] her children
[1:38:20] oh mothers you won't be great
[1:38:24] you want to be great what greatest thing
[1:38:29] could be said about you
[1:38:32] then for your children to arise
[1:38:36] up and call her blessed
[1:38:44] her husband also
[1:38:47] and he praises her you see as the
[1:38:58] children of a virtuous woman mature
[1:39:02] they also have this desire and they
[1:39:04] recognize the wisdom
[1:39:06] that they misunderstood in their use
[1:39:09] they recognize
[1:39:10] the fountain of love and the purity that
[1:39:13] their mother handed to them
[1:39:15] it'll become more real to these
[1:39:17] daughters and this son
[1:39:19] as they go on her husband praises her
[1:39:23] by telling others how god gave him
[1:39:27] such a wife
[1:39:31] he praises her many daughters
[1:39:34] have done virtuously
[1:39:39] but thou excellest them all
[1:39:43] now i was going to stop with verse 30.
[1:39:46] favor is deceitful and beauty is vain
[1:39:49] but a woman that feareth the lord
[1:39:52] she shall be praised and sister karen
[1:39:54] didn't have that verse line
[1:39:55] underlined but she did this one
[1:40:01] give her of the fruit of her hands
[1:40:05] and let her own works praise her
[1:40:10] in the gates
[1:40:13] praise be to god
[1:40:19] heavenly father
[1:40:22] we thank you for such a lady
[1:40:26] that has lived among us we thank you for
[1:40:29] such a queen
[1:40:31] a daughter of god
[1:40:36] lord is was talking about it the other
[1:40:37] day and
[1:40:39] whenever she had her home coming most of
[1:40:42] us probably saw it
[1:40:44] whenever she was able to come through
[1:40:45] that bout of sickness
[1:40:48] lord they brother tim driving her home
[1:40:50] and she got out
[1:40:52] saints were there rejoicing and many
[1:40:54] many people saw it around the world
[1:40:58] they gave her a homecoming in our minds
[1:41:02] we was hoping this time would be similar
[1:41:05] maybe
[1:41:07] but this time you wanted to give her the
[1:41:10] homecoming
[1:41:14] but the tim couldn't take her where she
[1:41:15] needed to go
[1:41:18] her husband that so loved her her
[1:41:20] children that so admired her
[1:41:24] but nobody could take her horse she
[1:41:26] needed to go this time but you
[1:41:29] so you had to send a host to come down
[1:41:32] to pack her away but my what a
[1:41:36] homecoming she's had
[1:41:39] she's only been there a few days in the
[1:41:41] way that we measure time
[1:41:43] but she hasn't had a clock a watch
[1:41:48] she's not had one pain
[1:41:51] she's not felt one moment of sadness
[1:41:55] she's already met the prophet already
[1:41:58] met loved ones and friends she's not
[1:42:00] going anywhere she's not tired
[1:42:02] she's not weary lord jesus i pray you
[1:42:06] would help those of us that are left
[1:42:08] behind
[1:42:09] may we press the battle may we press the
[1:42:13] battle until that day arrives when we
[1:42:15] can all be gathered together
[1:42:18] i pray for my dear precious
[1:42:21] little buddy today
[1:42:24] that you're stricted
[1:42:28] help him father

[1:49:28] i want to read the lord's prayer if you
[1:49:30] read it with me today
[1:49:33] amen matthew chapter 6 and verse 9.
[1:49:38] the disciples knew that they would come
[1:49:39] to some very difficult situations in
[1:49:41] life
[1:49:44] and sometimes we just don't know what to
[1:49:45] say or how to communicate with god
[1:49:49] and he gave us one of the most simple
[1:49:53] prayers yet so incredibly powerful
[1:49:58] not praying it to a man or a preacher or
[1:50:01] a bishop
[1:50:02] or a cardinal but to god himself
[1:50:07] and he knew that in many times
[1:50:11] we were going to come to him in trouble
[1:50:14] and distress
[1:50:15] and heartbroken and looking
[1:50:18] at devastations that we
[1:50:21] humanly could not handle
[1:50:26] and he gave us an example
[1:50:30] our father which art in heaven
[1:50:34] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:50:38] thy will be done in earth as is in
[1:50:41] heaven
[1:50:42] give us this day our daily bread
[1:50:45] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:50:47] our debtors
[1:50:49] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:50:51] deliver us from evil
[1:50:53] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[1:50:56] and the glory forever amen
[1:51:00] you may be seated
[1:51:07] today we are here to honor a queen
[1:51:11] we're not ashamed to call her the queen
[1:51:15] she was the queen of louisiana
[1:51:19] she was a queen because she stepped out
[1:51:21] of the eternities
[1:51:22] of the thoughts of god and stepped into
[1:51:26] the realm of time
[1:51:27] through her mother and father she began
[1:51:30] to grow up and be a beautiful young girl
[1:51:33] she didn't
[1:51:34] realize but god had incredible plans for
[1:51:37] her
[1:51:39] shy quiet mischievous as she could be
[1:51:46] she had a way that she could smile that
[1:51:48] would warm your heart
[1:51:51] and the sharpness in her eyes
[1:51:54] that would win anybody's favor
[1:51:59] she would go to church with her mother
[1:52:00] and father
[1:52:03] and it would be one of their first
[1:52:06] services
[1:52:07] in this particular place
[1:52:10] young unmarried prince
[1:52:15] standing in the pulpit
[1:52:21] she didn't realize where life was about
[1:52:24] to take her
[1:52:26] but you see god watched over her through
[1:52:28] the eternities
[1:52:30] watched over her seed all the way down
[1:52:33] wanted to have that certain color hair
[1:52:36] that certain build
[1:52:38] certain mannerisms that she would have
[1:52:41] because she would need that
[1:52:43] to conduct herself as a queen
[1:52:47] she no doubt didn't realize when
[1:52:51] she began to fall in love and he began
[1:52:54] to fall in love that
[1:52:56] he was going to be one of god's greatest
[1:52:58] generals
[1:53:00] that would ever be on the face of the
[1:53:02] earth
[1:53:05] and she was going to be one of god's
[1:53:07] greatest queens
[1:53:08] that would be on the face of the earth
[1:53:11] as it has been said
[1:53:12] behind every great man is a great woman
[1:53:18] brother branham taught us to choose
[1:53:19] another bride he says
[1:53:21] we know the inside of a man by what he
[1:53:24] chooses
[1:53:27] now he can do a lot of things and make a
[1:53:29] lot of decisions
[1:53:31] but what he chooses as a wife reflects
[1:53:34] the very
[1:53:35] inside of him and so
[1:53:38] when brother tim chose
[1:53:42] her and
[1:53:46] she was more than just a message
[1:53:48] believer
[1:53:51] she was the characteristics of christ
[1:53:55] in human flesh more than quotes
[1:54:00] more than beautiful sermons but she was
[1:54:03] the
[1:54:04] embodiment of the ministry
[1:54:08] of tim pruitt
[1:54:11] now let's just be honest with you
[1:54:14] this lady let's give her her accolades
[1:54:16] just now
[1:54:18] she probably heard more preaching
[1:54:24] at 62 years old
[1:54:29] than any other woman in history
[1:54:40] give the lord a good hand
[1:54:52] it's that truth
[1:55:00] brother tim and i have we were counting
[1:55:03] it up at home the other day and we have
[1:55:05] spoke about 70 meetings together
[1:55:11] we've had an incredible time together
[1:55:14] all of us have had incredible
[1:55:15] relationships together
[1:55:18] we are honored to be friends and stand
[1:55:21] amongst god's generals
[1:55:24] no one greater than another
[1:55:28] but when god was choosing his best to
[1:55:31] live in laodicea
[1:55:35] god didn't do that haphazardly he
[1:55:38] called he called you to be his absolute
[1:55:41] best
[1:55:43] not actors not impersonators
[1:55:46] but real
[1:55:49] real people that could
[1:55:53] stand in the presence of god and be real
[1:55:58] then become models
[1:56:01] to the community if i wanted to be a
[1:56:04] christian i believe i would want to be
[1:56:06] like her
[1:56:08] now that's a testimony of a real lady of
[1:56:11] what a real
[1:56:12] pastor's wife is
[1:56:17] she was a lady whether it was in germany
[1:56:21] or in switzerland or in new zealand
[1:56:25] shenandoah valley she was a real lady
[1:56:29] and as a real lady she conducted herself
[1:56:32] that way
[1:56:36] she was mischievous
[1:56:40] she was a lot of fun she was incredibly
[1:56:44] competitive
[1:56:48] we invited brother donnie and sister
[1:56:50] carol
[1:56:51] to play putt-putt with us one night
[1:56:55] it was their first time and sister carol
[1:56:58] didn't quite how to know how to do it
[1:57:04] and she showed her every trick that she
[1:57:06] could show her
[1:57:09] let me just say this to you she was
[1:57:10] humble in everything except for
[1:57:12] competitiveness
[1:57:20] and to be very honest with you she beat
[1:57:22] me every time and
[1:57:24] let me know it
[1:57:28] brother tim really didn't care where he
[1:57:29] won or lost he he preached generally all
[1:57:31] the way the 18 holes
[1:57:42] you know that he was whether it was the
[1:57:45] new birth or
[1:57:46] whatever it was he was sharing his
[1:57:49] thoughts and his quotes and
[1:57:52] he had to take out time to hit the ball
[1:58:01] but she was a real lady and that's what
[1:58:04] that's what made her so much fun to all
[1:58:06] of us she captured our hearts
[1:58:09] you sisters know yes
[1:58:14] most of us thought she had wings but
[1:58:16] there were times that she hung them up
[1:58:20] she would be to me the best german
[1:58:23] chocolate
[1:58:25] cake maker in the world
[1:58:28] no i'm not being a politician today
[1:58:30] brother tim
[1:58:32] connie don't make german chocolate
[1:58:42] another story for another day
[1:58:48] it was at the last october meeting
[1:58:50] brother david mayer was staying in the
[1:58:52] same house with us and
[1:58:54] and sister karen asked us on the way
[1:58:56] home after service she said brother on
[1:58:57] what would you like to eat
[1:58:59] they had that chocolate cake hadn't been
[1:59:01] touched yet and i said
[1:59:02] boy i'd like to sure have a piece of
[1:59:04] that german chocolate cake
[1:59:08] brother tim was sure that that the cake
[1:59:12] named german didn't come from germany
[1:59:14] because he'd never tasted anything like
[1:59:16] that
[1:59:16] in germany and brother david was
[1:59:21] inquisitive of where it did come from
[1:59:23] and it would be that night that we would
[1:59:24] figure out that it was a man named
[1:59:26] german
[1:59:27] that came up with the recipe of that
[1:59:29] cake
[1:59:30] no that cake didn't last two weeks
[1:59:34] it was about three days
[1:59:37] and we enjoyed every bit of it the diet
[1:59:41] was over
[1:59:46] if you know anything about the pruitt
[1:59:48] house if brother tim's on a diet
[1:59:50] you're on a diet
[1:59:54] if he's feasting and having comfort food
[1:59:58] you are as well the other day when we
[2:00:01] were here
[2:00:02] brother donnie and we were here brother
[2:00:05] john
[2:00:06] we would go to strums and have some
[2:00:08] comfort food
[2:00:10] pie was necessary to have
[2:00:15] it was a time of a lot of deep thoughts
[2:00:17] a time of
[2:00:20] thinking about things of how they were
[2:00:22] where we were
[2:00:23] at but you see all of the sermons that
[2:00:26] she heard was preparing
[2:00:27] her for this day
[2:00:31] it's not a day of defeat
[2:00:34] it's not a day to where that we dreary
[2:00:37] and say this is the end
[2:00:38] her last heartbeat was only the
[2:00:41] beginning
[2:00:45] why we came and
[2:00:48] families came and i'd like to say thank
[2:00:50] you to the all of the sisters that were
[2:00:52] there to
[2:00:53] and the brothers that were there to help
[2:00:55] with watching over
[2:00:58] her and taking care of sister karen many
[2:01:01] visitors came and
[2:01:02] we were honored we were thrilled to come
[2:01:05] we wanted to come earlier but we
[2:01:07] couldn't get here just in time
[2:01:13] we were sitting in the room and i just
[2:01:14] want to share this with you we were
[2:01:16] sitting in the room and
[2:01:18] brother tim would sing to her but i was
[2:01:22] sitting in the chair and
[2:01:23] i noticed the octave level went to
[2:01:26] another
[2:01:27] another place
[2:01:32] i slipped around behind the bed where
[2:01:34] brother tim was standing and i got
[2:01:36] just toward the head of the bed and i
[2:01:38] wanted to join him for the moment
[2:01:40] and i could tell why because the angel
[2:01:44] of the lord
[2:01:45] that warm presence of god was standing
[2:01:48] at the head of her bed
[2:01:50] you see she had unseen guests as well
[2:01:57] sister esther as that presence would
[2:02:00] flow across you
[2:02:02] to let you know that you're just not the
[2:02:04] only one in the room
[2:02:06] i believe we come to realize today
[2:02:10] that we're not the only ones in this
[2:02:12] room
[2:02:14] we've heard it so incredibly placed at
[2:02:17] chapter 31
[2:02:18] never heard it any better and it
[2:02:20] couldn't have been for a greater lady
[2:02:23] of how great that she was
[2:02:27] no this queen doesn't need a chariot
[2:02:30] to ride out in front but god has sent
[2:02:33] representatives from all over the world
[2:02:37] to sit here to sit at her funeral
[2:02:41] at her memorial that are going home
[2:02:45] at our celebration today
[2:02:48] that you recognize that that was more
[2:02:50] than just a little poor girl
[2:02:53] from washington that predestination
[2:02:57] brought her to louisiana
[2:03:00] and watched over all the days of her
[2:03:02] life
[2:03:04] and as she come and she became a great
[2:03:06] lady
[2:03:07] in this house and you watched over her
[2:03:12] as she would turn her husband loose to
[2:03:13] go to battle
[2:03:16] she did her everything that she could
[2:03:20] to help him in every way that she could
[2:03:23] every need to make sure that the
[2:03:27] atmosphere
[2:03:28] was right in their home and she was
[2:03:30] quite a decorator
[2:03:34] she wanted that atmosphere right
[2:03:38] she was very conscious of the presence
[2:03:40] of the lord
[2:03:44] you see it was more than a sermon to her
[2:03:49] it was another step into eternity
[2:03:52] no she never complained and i was around
[2:03:55] her a bit
[2:03:56] she never complained at how long her
[2:03:58] husband spoke
[2:04:01] she never got weary at that
[2:04:04] she loved it she loved every service
[2:04:10] caused us some difficult moments
[2:04:15] she would come through them over and
[2:04:16] over we were standing in germany
[2:04:20] at an incredible meeting and she got
[2:04:23] called out into the
[2:04:25] into the aisle and god touched her
[2:04:28] and made her new she came home a
[2:04:31] different woman
[2:04:33] now that same lord jesus touched her
[2:04:35] many many years ago
[2:04:37] and made that little girl that was such
[2:04:39] a darling
[2:04:40] a real lady of grace
[2:04:43] now it's not just for her but it's for
[2:04:45] her daughters
[2:04:47] and her son and from the fruit of her
[2:04:49] womb would come another general
[2:04:52] that would stand on the scene and preach
[2:04:54] the gospel
[2:04:55] and she wasn't shy about telling you
[2:04:58] that he was one of her favorite
[2:04:59] preachers
[2:05:03] she loved her grandchildren she loved
[2:05:06] each and every one of you
[2:05:08] with no exception whatsoever
[2:05:11] she loved you with all of her hearts
[2:05:15] no she didn't die the other day she did
[2:05:17] that many years ago
[2:05:20] but what she did the other day was
[2:05:22] change clothes
[2:05:26] we were begging for another word from
[2:05:28] her
[2:05:29] we were begging for another hug another
[2:05:32] passionate kiss
[2:05:34] we were begging for a conversation with
[2:05:36] her over again
[2:05:37] but god was going to save that
[2:05:42] beyond the curtain of time
[2:05:47] she has met fanny crosby she's met the
[2:05:50] great ladies
[2:05:51] of grace she's met my mother
[2:05:55] she met her mother no doubt she's
[2:05:58] dancing she's enjoying it's hard for us
[2:06:02] to fathom
[2:06:03] but let me just say this you being a
[2:06:05] queen here
[2:06:07] she's a queen there
[2:06:10] jesus would remind us of these words
[2:06:14] let not your heart be troubled you
[2:06:17] believe in god believe also in me
[2:06:20] in my father's house are many mansions
[2:06:24] and if it were not so i would have told
[2:06:26] you i go to prepare a place for you
[2:06:30] that where i am there you may be also
[2:06:34] and whether i go you know and the way
[2:06:37] that you know
[2:06:40] and thomas sayeth unto him
[2:06:43] we know not whether thou goest or how
[2:06:46] can we know that way
[2:06:48] and jesus said unto him
[2:06:51] i am the way i am the truth
[2:06:55] and i am the life and no man cometh unto
[2:06:59] the father
[2:07:01] but by me and let me just say this to
[2:07:04] you
[2:07:05] more than a scripture took place the
[2:07:07] other day
[2:07:08] she didn't go to a home of brick and
[2:07:10] mortar and stone
[2:07:12] she stepped into a well body
[2:07:16] one that i'd like to just tell the devil
[2:07:18] if i could
[2:07:19] put him on notice you can't touch her no
[2:07:21] more
[2:07:25] you can't touch her no more you
[2:07:28] lose again
[2:07:45] you see there will not be another brain
[2:07:48] bleed
[2:07:51] there not be another one there'll not be
[2:07:54] more high blood pressure and anxiety
[2:07:56] that you'll have to deal with
[2:07:58] those demons had to go find somebody
[2:08:01] else
[2:08:04] because she said
[2:08:14] in her competitive nature if it's still
[2:08:16] that way sister connie she'd like to
[2:08:19] tell us
[2:08:19] sister carol i got here first
[2:08:37] isaiah would write it like this and it
[2:08:39] would be so incredible
[2:08:42] who hath believed our report and to whom
[2:08:44] is the arm of the lord revealed
[2:08:46] for he shall grow up before him as a
[2:08:48] tender plant as a rudolph
[2:08:50] to dry ground as a
[2:08:53] and he hath no formula calmliness and
[2:08:55] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[2:08:57] that we should desire him
[2:09:01] he is despised and rejected of men
[2:09:05] a man of sorrows acquainted
[2:09:08] with grief he had to become that way
[2:09:14] to know what you're going through today
[2:09:17] and knowing what you're going through
[2:09:18] today he knows how to help you
[2:09:22] he was wounded for our transgressions
[2:09:24] and bruised for our iniquities
[2:09:28] and the chastisement of our peace was
[2:09:30] upon him and with his stripes
[2:09:33] we are healed
[2:09:43] i'd like to proclaim to you that death
[2:09:45] has not won today
[2:09:48] it has not won but actually the opposite
[2:09:53] has taken place
[2:09:58] when i was studying this week to to look
[2:10:01] at
[2:10:02] anything that i could bring strength to
[2:10:04] you
[2:10:07] i was reminded of of the germany trip
[2:10:12] that morning brother tim brother raymond
[2:10:14] thompson
[2:10:15] spoke a sermon on who was jesus
[2:10:20] it would be that night that god would
[2:10:22] touch her and strengthen her
[2:10:28] and there was a almost a poem
[2:10:31] that was that was said there and i
[2:10:34] thought it would be so
[2:10:35] incredible i i'd like to share it with
[2:10:37] you today
[2:10:41] who is jesus
[2:10:46] he came from the bosom of the father
[2:10:49] to the bosom of a woman he put on
[2:10:53] humanity that we might put on
[2:10:55] his deity he became the son of
[2:10:59] man that we might become the sons of god
[2:11:04] he came from heaven where rivers
[2:11:08] never freeze winds never blow
[2:11:12] and frost never chills the air
[2:11:16] flowers never fade and no one
[2:11:20] is ever sick what a land
[2:11:24] there's no undertakers no graveyards
[2:11:29] for no one ever dies
[2:11:32] no one is ever buried
[2:11:36] he was born contrary to the laws of
[2:11:38] nature
[2:11:40] he lived in poverty reared in obscurity
[2:11:44] crossed the boundaries of the land only
[2:11:47] once in childhood
[2:11:49] he had no wealth nor influence
[2:11:52] neither training of formal education
[2:11:55] his relatives were inconspicuous and
[2:11:58] influential in infancy
[2:12:03] he startled kings in boyhood
[2:12:07] he puzzled wise men in manhood
[2:12:11] ruled the courses of nature
[2:12:14] he walked on the billows and hussed the
[2:12:17] sea to sleep
[2:12:19] he healed the multitude without medicine
[2:12:22] and made no charge for his services
[2:12:25] he never read a book yet all the
[2:12:29] libraries of the country could not hold
[2:12:31] the books
[2:12:32] that were written about him he never
[2:12:36] wrote a song
[2:12:37] yet he furnished the theme of more songs
[2:12:41] than all the songwriters combined
[2:12:44] he never founded a college yet all the
[2:12:47] schools together cannot
[2:12:49] boast of as many students
[2:12:52] as he has he never practiced psychology
[2:12:57] yet he healed more broken hearts
[2:13:06] then all the doctors
[2:13:11] could touch he never marshaled an army
[2:13:16] drafted a soldier fired a gun
[2:13:20] yet no leader has ever had more
[2:13:24] volunteers
[2:13:26] who under his orders made rebels stack
[2:13:29] arms
[2:13:31] and surrender without a shot being fired
[2:13:36] he is the star of astronomy
[2:13:40] he is the rock of geology
[2:13:43] he is the lion and the lamb
[2:13:50] he is the harmonizer of all discords
[2:13:55] the healer of all diseases
[2:14:00] great men have come and gone yet their
[2:14:02] lives
[2:14:07] herod could not kill him
[2:14:10] satan could not seduce him
[2:14:14] death could not destroy him
[2:14:17] and the grave could not hold him
[2:14:22] he laid aside the purple robe of royalty
[2:14:25] for a peasant's gown he was rich
[2:14:29] yet for our sakes he became poor
[2:14:38] he cruised the lake on another's boat
[2:14:42] he rode on another man's donkey he was
[2:14:45] buried in another man's tomb
[2:14:49] all have failed but he
[2:14:53] never failed
[2:14:57] this jesus that lived in sister karen
[2:15:03] was jesus
[2:15:07] was god was deity
[2:15:11] it conquered every sin that was in her
[2:15:13] life
[2:15:15] every failure and every complex that she
[2:15:17] dealt with throughout her life
[2:15:20] this jesus was so personal
[2:15:24] she stands as a pure and virtuous
[2:15:27] woman today no holes to be
[2:15:31] poked no faults to be said
[2:15:35] she is the queen not just here but she's
[2:15:38] now a queen
[2:15:40] in heaven
[2:15:48] i'd just like to say this to you jesus
[2:15:51] prepared for
[2:15:52] this event
[2:15:59] it did not catch him by surprise
[2:16:02] it won't catch you by surprise
[2:16:07] he's made preparations for us and just
[2:16:11] as his angel stood by her bed
[2:16:14] to take her home the song says swing low
[2:16:18] sweet chariot
[2:16:21] maybe you're here today and you don't
[2:16:23] know jesus that changed her life
[2:16:27] that helped her to con conduct herself
[2:16:29] as a queen
[2:16:31] to stand beside of a general and have
[2:16:35] pictures taken throughout
[2:16:36] life she was never ashamed
[2:16:41] of her general but she was never ashamed
[2:16:46] of her jesus
[2:16:52] never ashamed
[2:16:56] and john would write it like this as we
[2:16:58] come to a close
[2:17:00] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[2:17:06] for the first heaven and the first earth
[2:17:08] were passed away and there was no more
[2:17:10] sea
[2:17:11] and i john saw saw the holy city the new
[2:17:14] jerusalem
[2:17:16] coming down from god out of heaven
[2:17:18] prepared it
[2:17:19] as a bride adorned for her husband
[2:17:22] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[2:17:24] saying behold the tabernacle of god
[2:17:26] is with men and he will dwell with them
[2:17:29] and they shall be his people
[2:17:31] and god himself shall be with them and
[2:17:34] be their god
[2:17:36] and god shall wipe all away all tears
[2:17:38] from their eyes
[2:17:40] and there shall be no more death
[2:17:44] i hope satan's listening today there
[2:17:47] shall be no more death
[2:17:49] neither sorrow nor crying
[2:17:52] neither shall there be any more pain
[2:17:55] for the former things are passed away
[2:17:59] and he that set up on the throne said
[2:18:02] behold i make all things new
[2:18:06] not just back to where she was when she
[2:18:09] was 18 19 20 years old
[2:18:12] but at her very best what god thought of
[2:18:15] her
[2:18:19] and he said unto me right for these
[2:18:21] words
[2:18:22] are true and faithful
[2:18:26] and he said unto me it is done
[2:18:29] i am alpha and omega the beginning
[2:18:34] and the end and i will give unto thee
[2:18:37] that is a thirst the fountain
[2:18:39] of water of life freely
[2:18:44] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[2:18:47] things
[2:18:49] and i will be his god and he shall be my
[2:18:52] son
[2:18:55] she wants to hear her master
[2:18:59] say well done
[2:19:02] but i believe we as a body of believers
[2:19:04] could look at this
[2:19:06] at the end of this service today and
[2:19:09] from this side
[2:19:10] of the veil say sister karen
[2:19:15] well done

[2:20:12] different way

[2:20:17] piece of ammunition against the devil

[2:20:47] bad move

[2:20:53] nothing like a soldier with a chip
[2:20:56] on his shoulder
[2:21:00] more time to sharpen his sword
[2:21:03] more time to study more time to be alone

[2:33:39] i think about the land that she's in
[2:33:41] you know it always strikes me
[2:33:45] that when brother branham went beyond
[2:33:47] the curtain of time
[2:33:50] he had no difficulty describing what he
[2:33:54] saw
[2:33:56] he described it he tells us in great
[2:33:58] detail
[2:33:59] you know i saw the it was a rising hill
[2:34:02] and grass and it
[2:34:03] rolled up over and i saw looked like
[2:34:05] millions of
[2:34:07] sisters running and then men and he
[2:34:08] described them
[2:34:10] my said their their eyes looked like
[2:34:12] stars and
[2:34:13] and he described seeing his horse and
[2:34:16] his dog and
[2:34:17] and a woman that was he didn't recognize
[2:34:19] because she was past 90.
[2:34:21] he recognized hope he told us about it
[2:34:25] he told us about everything that he
[2:34:27] heard said he had no trouble
[2:34:29] relaying what he saw
[2:34:32] and what he heard but what he could not
[2:34:36] describe
[2:34:37] to his dying day was how he felt
[2:34:41] he said i don't have any words
[2:34:44] no way to describe it he said nothing
[2:34:48] could touch it
[2:34:49] that feeling that he had being there
[2:34:53] and that is the feeling our sister is
[2:34:56] enjoying today
[2:34:58] that make you then i throw your heart to
[2:35:00] think about that my trouble's over
[2:35:02] beyond the enemy's reach now
