[53:05] God what a message we have
[53:09] tonight it's a message that inspires
[53:12] Faith to believe for every promise of
[53:18] God as I was just reading here this in
[53:23] that last couple of days
[53:26] going over a few
[53:27] things about the supernatural gospel
[53:30] that God has sent in this last
[53:33] day how an angel came to a man in a
[53:38] cabin brother
[53:41] brandham an angel would come to
[53:43] him tell him about his mysterious life
[53:47] his misunderstood
[53:49] ways commission him to bring a
[53:54] message of Divine
[53:57] Healing he would tell us the angel would
[54:00] say the coming of the Lord is
[54:02] near that's our
[54:04] message we are here in the coming of the
[54:08] Lord it is a message of healing not just
[54:11] for the
[54:12] body but it would also heal us of our
[54:16] denominational ideas and and the and the
[54:20] theories of
[54:21] man and it would straighten it that
[54:24] those things out and bring a healing to
[54:26] the body of Christ and cause us to be in
[54:30] love with Jesus with all our
[54:34] hearts the angel said nothing with stand
[54:38] before your prayers not even
[54:41] cancer that's the way our message
[54:45] started it came with a
[54:47] commission to pray for the sick to L to
[54:52] to to cast out Devils with which is
[54:55] praying for the sick Healing The
[54:58] Sick As we are here
[55:02] tonight I think about 15 years
[55:09] ago I was commissioned to go and travel
[55:13] across the
[55:14] country to go and
[55:17] visit brother Ron Spencer who had been
[55:19] burned in a horrible
[55:22] fire and he was dying the doctors had
[55:25] given him up there was no
[55:30] hope but I walked into his hospital room
[55:33] and I said I have not come to anoint you
[55:35] for death I have come to anoint you for
[55:39] life we prayed there carrying all the
[55:42] prayers of all the saints had' been
[55:44] praying we carried them in that room
[55:46] with
[55:47] us and God gloriously raised him up to
[55:50] preach the
[55:52] gospel now about
[55:56] three and a half years
[55:58] ago he got the news that that he had
[56:02] stage for cancer and that they only gave
[56:06] him three months to
[56:10] live well we've seen that no
[56:14] doctor nor any devil can put a period to
[56:17] your
[56:19] life it is God who decides those
[56:23] things and God has raised him up and
[56:26] used him for the glory of God to preach
[56:29] the gospel now carrying it around used
[56:32] like never
[56:34] before and I want to just testify
[56:37] tonight that the message that started
[56:41] out with a with an admonition that not
[56:45] even cancer would stand before this
[56:48] truth of this word that we are here
[56:51] tonight to reaffirm that Jesus Christ is
[56:54] the same yesterday today and
[56:57] forever we got the nation Israel that is
[57:00] under
[57:01] attack all kinds of things that are
[57:04] happening there and you know where the
[57:06] enemy has come in
[57:09] and women and children pulled out in the
[57:11] streets out of their homes out of their
[57:13] beds and
[57:15] killed taken captive all kinds of things
[57:18] that are going on right now
[57:20] chaos you see that's Israel natural but
[57:23] Israel spiritual the devil wants to do
[57:25] the same thing he wants to come into
[57:28] your home and to your family or into
[57:31] your church and drag you out in the
[57:33] streets and haul you away captive or
[57:36] kill your loved ones or your
[57:38] family but I'll just tell you tonight we
[57:41] are at
[57:42] War and we're here to do battle we're
[57:46] here to stand on a Word of Promise God
[57:49] has given us this land and we are
[57:52] possessors of the enemy's gate
[57:55] and we will not back up we will not
[57:57] Retreat we will not give up land we will
[58:01] not let go of One Promise of God but we
[58:04] will see complete and total
[58:11] deliverance and
[58:13] tonight as we prepare for this
[58:16] service where faith will be built
[58:19] testimonies will be
[58:21] given these testimonies are not to
[58:24] glorify of man these testimonies are to
[58:27] lift up the name of Jesus Christ where
[58:29] that you can see that this is not a god
[58:33] of History this is a present God that
[58:37] he's right here now right now in this
[58:40] building to meet your need to speak to
[58:42] your heart to reveal himself to you to
[58:44] fill you with the Holy Ghost to drive
[58:47] out the spirits of the enemy that would
[58:50] be in your life that would be torment us
[58:53] and we're here tonight
[58:56] to do battle my sword is

[59:13] most high God we will drive them
[59:18] back we will take every
[59:20] promise are you ready for
[59:23] that as brother Brandon would be
[59:26] commissioned to pray for the sick he
[59:30] would take
[59:31] this news of this visitation to the
[59:35] bishop of the of the Missionary Baptist
[59:38] Church that was kind of over the
[59:41] churches and he would Mock and make fun

[1:00:03] somebody that'll believe it I'm looking
[1:00:06] at those somebody right here that
[1:00:07] believes it and around the world that
[1:00:10] are joining in with us right now that
[1:00:13] believe it we believe that
[1:00:20] message a little bit confused when the
[1:00:24] message message was
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:28] rejected couple of days later there was
[1:00:30] a man that got off of a bus and here as
[1:00:35] he kind of looked around bewildered and
[1:00:38] brother brandham was there to cash his
[1:00:40] check downtown in in
[1:00:43] Jeffersonville it's on a Friday
[1:00:45] afternoon and he noticed this man get
[1:00:47] off the bus he come over and
[1:00:50] said sir said are you a local do can you

[1:01:08] strange experience I live 200 miles from

[1:01:15] Kentucky and he said last night I had a
[1:01:18] dream and an angel came and stepped out
[1:01:21] of a light and said go to Jeffersonville
[1:01:24] Indiana and asked for a man by the name
[1:01:26] of brandom and he will pray for you said
[1:01:29] sir I've been sick for now for 2 years
[1:01:31] and I can't get over it said then and
[1:01:36] brother Brandon put his arm around him
[1:01:37] he said sir that angel met me the other
[1:01:40] day in the
[1:01:42] cabin and commissioned me to pray for
[1:01:45] the sick he knew right then that that
[1:01:48] angel was at
[1:01:50] work he would tell the testimony to his
[1:01:53] own church and that night they would
[1:01:56] they would sing this song for the first
[1:01:58] time only believe all things are
[1:02:02] possible and as he heard that song sung
[1:02:05] the angel of God Drew near and he knew
[1:02:07] it was a song The Angel like to
[1:02:13] hear and they would sing the different
[1:02:15] verses of it he would tell of this
[1:02:18] healing and the man came up in his
[1:02:20] church had been flashburn with welding
[1:02:23] and his eyes was burned it would be a we
[1:02:29] almost a couple of weeks before he could
[1:02:30] go back to work but he walked up to
[1:02:33] brother brandom said brother brandom I
[1:02:34] believe
[1:02:37] that pray for me he prayed for him he
[1:02:40] went back to work the next
[1:02:44] day and he was his boss then would come

[1:03:06] night and Jesus Christ has healed
[1:03:09] me he said you think he could help my
[1:03:13] wife she's laying dying in the
[1:03:17] hospital her name is Margie he said I I

[1:03:38] conscious and brother Bram took her by
[1:03:42] the hand like the angel told him
[1:03:44] to with his left hand with her right and
[1:03:47] he immediately felt for the first time
[1:03:51] that gift began to work where that he
[1:03:54] could tell the diseases that was in her
[1:03:56] body and he said what is this what is
[1:04:00] she got said she's got
[1:04:02] cancer and he prayed for her and it
[1:04:07] stopped the life went out of the
[1:04:11] cancer and and a immediately a vision
[1:04:14] came and he saw her as a nurse going and
[1:04:19] tending to her patience and he said thus
[1:04:21] say the Lord she will live and not die
[1:04:25] her doctor protested but you don't know
[1:04:27] sir her condition we did surgery on her
[1:04:29] we opened her up from the breast all the
[1:04:31] way down and said it's so wrapped around

[1:14:18] seated Isaiah chter 53 verse 1 not
[1:14:23] reading it just because it's a tradition
[1:14:27] or even for redundance but this is God's
[1:14:31] word it's his
[1:14:33] prescription and it's his cure sir who
[1:14:37] hath believed our report and to whom is
[1:14:40] the arm of the Lord revealed for he
[1:14:43] shall grow up before him as a tender
[1:14:45] plant as a root out of Dy ground and he
[1:14:48] hath no form nor cess and when we shall
[1:14:50] see him there is no beauty that we
[1:14:53] should desire him all right he is
[1:14:55] despised and rejected of men a Man of
[1:14:58] Sorrows acquainted with
[1:15:01] grief and we hid as if it were our faces
[1:15:04] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[1:15:07] him
[1:15:10] not can you read this with us now surely
[1:15:14] he hath borne our griefs and carried our
[1:15:18] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:15:21] and smitten of God and Afflicted but he
[1:15:25] was wounded for our
[1:15:27] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:15:31] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:15:33] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:45] healed
[1:15:49] Hallelujah Mark 16 and verse1 15 gives
[1:15:53] us the authority to have a service like
[1:15:55] this tonight and he said unto them go ye
[1:15:58] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:16:01] to every creature and he that believeth
[1:16:04] and is baptized shall be saved and he
[1:16:06] that believeth not shall be damned and
[1:16:09] these signs shall follow them that
[1:16:11] believe how many Believers are in the
[1:16:13] building now in my
[1:16:16] name shall they cast out devils and they
[1:16:19] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[1:16:22] take up serpents and if they drink any
[1:16:24] deadly thing it shall not hurt them and
[1:16:27] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:16:30] they shall
[1:16:34] recover brother Brandon begins to prayer
[1:16:37] and he says this and I think it's an
[1:16:39] incredible prayer Satan you are a
[1:16:41] defeated being on yeah you have no legal
[1:16:45] rights to begin with to torment these
[1:16:47] people you're a bluff and we're calling
[1:16:50] your bluff Jesus Christ defeated you in
[1:16:53] his death and Resurrection his blood
[1:16:56] paid for for his blood paid every price
[1:17:01] of sin that you coach the family of
[1:17:04] human race into and now we are sons and
[1:17:08] daughters
[1:17:09] again and his anointed spirit is
[1:17:12] speaking with us this evening and as he
[1:17:14] did with Adam in the cool of the evening
[1:17:17] therefore you cannot hold these
[1:17:19] Christians any
[1:17:22] longer I adure Thee by the Living God
[1:17:25] that you depart from these sick people
[1:17:28] and come out of them that they can go
[1:17:30] from this building Tonight free from
[1:17:33] sickness with a faith that's so
[1:17:36] predominating it'll drive out of their
[1:17:39] thoughts the in the Realms and in the
[1:17:42] name of Jesus Christ I commission Satan
[1:17:45] to leave these
[1:17:48] peopleall these diseases and the form of
[1:17:51] a disease which is the devil to depart
[1:17:55] from these people through Jesus Christ's

[1:19:13] whether it wasn't going to happen he
[1:19:17] said he he know it was going to happen

[1:21:34] the
[1:21:35] end of the
[1:21:39] road oh don't you love
[1:21:42] him I think when when Jesus
[1:21:45] comes it changes the atmosphere of the
[1:21:49] room when he comes he's always on a
[1:21:52] mission yeah now he he goes where he's
[1:21:56] invited and he's come where two or three
[1:21:58] are gathered he's come he's made a
[1:22:00] promise to come to you yes now whether
[1:22:03] you see him whether you feel
[1:22:06] him whether any of your senses grab a
[1:22:09] hold of it he's give you a promise that
[1:22:12] I I've come to this
[1:22:14] service that's right on and and let me
[1:22:18] just say this to you he's he's not a
[1:22:20] doctor like I visit every week
[1:22:23] a doctor that's just adventuring you
[1:22:25] know they're just trying to make life
[1:22:27] better and they're just kind of guessing
[1:22:30] along the way by their past studies and
[1:22:32] using certain medicines when he walks in
[1:22:36] the
[1:22:37] room he's got the cure to your
[1:22:47] problems now he knows before you would
[1:22:51] ask before that that even Satan could
[1:22:55] attack you he had to get permission from
[1:22:58] God now just think of where you are and
[1:23:01] how powerful that you are as a people
[1:23:03] you're the most powerful people on the
[1:23:06] Earth that's right they're not set
[1:23:09] sitting they're definitely not sitting
[1:23:10] in
[1:23:12] Washington right but you are the most
[1:23:14] powerful people on the Earth you're of a
[1:23:17] god race that's right you're a people of
[1:23:21] the open book
[1:23:23] you're Sons and Daughters of God that
[1:23:26] has been better explained to you than
[1:23:29] than any people upon the Earth as a
[1:23:32] matter of fact this is the Golden Age
[1:23:34] the bright age and you're you're the
[1:23:36] kind of the end of the end yes
[1:23:40] yeah you're a people if I could just
[1:23:42] explain it right that will never need a
[1:23:44] funeral tell
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:50] it now know they doubt many of you have
[1:23:53] insurance policies that that might put
[1:23:56] you in the ground and place you in a
[1:23:58] certain place but you know I would say
[1:24:02] that we're not going to use them all
[1:24:04] [Applause]
[1:24:06] right why why the funeral home won't be
[1:24:13] needed they won't have to send flowers
[1:24:16] come on now are you with me now I'm
[1:24:19] looking for a
[1:24:21] rapture
[1:24:23] I'm looking for him to step into the
[1:24:26] room more than just to heal my cancer
[1:24:30] that has attacked my
[1:24:31] body but he can change this body in the
[1:24:34] moment of the twinkling of an
[1:24:36] eye we're that
[1:24:43] people brother brandom no matter if he
[1:24:45] was an eighth in Penn Street in his own
[1:24:49] Tabernacle presence of God dropping or
[1:24:52] whether he was preaching a an
[1:24:54] Evangelistic sermon or or the seals or
[1:24:57] or any of the great
[1:24:59] sermons the presence of God would drop
[1:25:02] in the building the atmosphere would
[1:25:05] change hundreds would even stand outside
[1:25:09] listening through a radio and they would
[1:25:11] be listening and they were
[1:25:13] Spellbound not by the presence of a man
[1:25:17] but by the presence of the mighty Angel
[1:25:19] that's right whether it was in report
[1:25:23] here where it would be where whether it
[1:25:26] be sermons like on the wings of a snow
[1:25:29] white dove where the presence of God
[1:25:32] would just drop where your pastor said
[1:25:34] as a boy you see our Prophet had to
[1:25:37] leave the Earth but but the angel of God
[1:25:39] didn't that's
[1:25:41] right Hallelujah maybe it would be in
[1:25:44] the huge fields or coliseums no matter
[1:25:48] where it was at he would stand there
[1:25:51] because the angel of the Lord told him
[1:25:54] that he would be with him he would
[1:25:56] explain to us that he wouldn't be
[1:25:58] fearful or afraid because that angel
[1:26:01] whatever he told him to do that's what
[1:26:02] he would do just as Jesus would say I
[1:26:06] can do nothing except my father shows me
[1:26:09] first you see God had an eternal purpose
[1:26:13] on his mind in sending a message to
[1:26:15] gather you from all ends of the Earth
[1:26:18] people people that are watching here
[1:26:20] tonight may be laying in a hospital
[1:26:22] hospital room or maybe like sister Erica
[1:26:24] Reagan that's that's that's in a
[1:26:27] hospital now trying to get fluids or
[1:26:29] brother Joel forny that's in the
[1:26:31] hospital getting fluids God's the
[1:26:35] [Applause]
[1:26:37] answer brother Brandon would use
[1:26:39] statements like this he is
[1:26:42] here he would say for years you know I'm
[1:26:45] waiting on something and he would tell a
[1:26:48] story and he wasn't just idly just
[1:26:51] telling a story you know I'm waiting on
[1:26:53] something and then after a little while
[1:26:56] he would RAR his shoulders back and say
[1:26:58] I take every spirit in this
[1:27:02] building under my control in the name of
[1:27:04] the Lord Jesus christall we stand here
[1:27:08] not trying to make ourselves anything
[1:27:11] though they be great generals sitting
[1:27:13] behind us and Generals around the world
[1:27:16] but let me just say we have been
[1:27:18] commission with the same word and the
[1:27:21] same Authority
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:26] no one will diminish brother bram's
[1:27:29] Ministry but we're still assigned to lay
[1:27:32] hands on the sick and they shall
[1:27:37] recover
[1:27:39] Hallelujah now he would stand with the
[1:27:41] patient between him and he would say now
[1:27:44] you
[1:27:45] know that there's you feel something
[1:27:48] standing between you and
[1:27:50] I you feel that that you're nervous now
[1:27:54] that won't hurt
[1:27:58] you that won't hurt you that's
[1:28:02] him brother Jackie you preached around
[1:28:04] the world I'll probably get a little
[1:28:06] tent in heaven and you're going to get a
[1:28:08] great big castle God bless you for even
[1:28:11] being
[1:28:12] here you're a mighty General you're a
[1:28:15] general of General I want to be there
[1:28:16] that day when I hear your name
[1:28:21] called
[1:28:30] but you know when you're preaching you
[1:28:32] can feel that sweep of the Holy Spirit
[1:28:34] move through the
[1:28:35] room there's just none like him that's
[1:28:39] right there's just none like him no
[1:28:42] doubt you've said in many rooms and and
[1:28:44] and and many services if you've traveled
[1:28:46] a bit and you just know when that
[1:28:50] special presence begins to roll in
[1:28:52] right don't be afraid of
[1:28:55] that I would say I would say today as
[1:28:58] we've been hearing about worshiping the
[1:29:00] Lord we're the people that ought to
[1:29:02] really be worshiping the Lord if there's
[1:29:05] anything that we should be doing is
[1:29:07] giving him praise and Giving Him worship
[1:29:11] now let me just say God just didn't
[1:29:13] build you to see if he could build you
[1:29:15] come
[1:29:16] on he didn't just make a tree to make a
[1:29:20] tree he's got a purpose behind having
[1:29:23] you
[1:29:24] here hallelujah if I could just have a
[1:29:27] little conjecture here just for a moment
[1:29:29] and kind of reach out a little bit I
[1:29:31] believe that the angel of God was
[1:29:33] talking about me in that
[1:29:36] cave that not even
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:41] cancer not even
[1:29:44] cancer so here I stand as a miracle of
[1:29:48] God that should have been dead a long
[1:29:50] time
[1:29:50] ago
[1:30:01] Hallelujah but brother Ron you take
[1:30:03] chemo well let me just say this you as a
[1:30:05] doctor told me the other day he says now
[1:30:07] if anybody ever gives you a grief and
[1:30:09] says it's not a miracle that you take
[1:30:12] chemo he says I'll write a letter for
[1:30:16] you I'll write a letter for you and you
[1:30:18] can let them know that all these other
[1:30:20] patients are taking the same team know
[1:30:22] that you're
[1:30:23] taking and after about a year they're in
[1:30:25] a wheelchair if they make it a
[1:30:27] year he said you are a miracle my friend
[1:30:32] and we believe it with all of our
[1:30:45] hearts brother Tim and I was with
[1:30:48] brother
[1:30:49] bcll I'm just kind of kind of setting a
[1:30:53] a platform here for a moment we were
[1:30:55] sitting with brother Bisal and brother
[1:30:57] Samuel Ray's house after the
[1:31:01] meeting and we were sitting and we were
[1:31:03] just talking about supernatural
[1:31:06] things and
[1:31:09] as he would tell one brother Tim would
[1:31:11] tell a story and I would tell a story
[1:31:13] and after a little while there was a
[1:31:15] gathering of people I don't know exactly
[1:31:18] how many came into the room maybe 50 60
[1:31:21] people came came in and it was just
[1:31:23] people were videoing it and we begin to
[1:31:25] talk and toward the end brother Ed would
[1:31:30] the presence of the Lord would drop down
[1:31:32] and brother Ed would say many years ago
[1:31:35] I sat at a table like this and I sat
[1:31:39] with brother brandham at the table and
[1:31:42] he began to talk about Miracle after
[1:31:44] Miracle after miracle and we begin to go
[1:31:46] backwards and forwards and he said just
[1:31:49] in a little
[1:31:50] bit he says
[1:31:53] Eddie hanging just inches from you now
[1:31:57] is that Pillar of
[1:32:01] Fire the other night we were in alasas
[1:32:04] cabin and we begin to talk the
[1:32:06] supernatural things that we're seeing
[1:32:08] God do we're living in a book of
[1:32:12] Acts given time they'd write a book of
[1:32:15] Acts and we're living this is an action
[1:32:20] message it's a Liv life that's right
[1:32:23] it's a Invincible Army that's going
[1:32:26] forward whether you be in school or
[1:32:28] whether you be young parents or whether
[1:32:31] you're the oldest person in the building

[1:38:37] birthday present that you could give him
[1:38:39] might spend the best money that you've
[1:38:41] got and you would try your best because
[1:38:44] he's the king that's why we come to a
[1:38:47] service like

[1:38:50] player here right we definitely didn't
[1:38:54] come to worship the

[1:39:07] was a woman that heard Jesus was at a
[1:39:10] going to be at a certain
[1:39:12] place now no doubt maybe in her mind she
[1:39:15] wondered why he would even go there but
[1:39:18] you know because they're going to make
[1:39:19] fun of him but if I ever going to get to
[1:39:23] him I want to I want to get the best
[1:39:25] that I can
[1:39:26] get and she goes and gets the best
[1:39:29] perfume that she can get she buys the
[1:39:32] best she gets all of her all of her
[1:39:34] money out and she goes to the place and
[1:39:38] you know you hear brother brandham say
[1:39:39] says well you know you don't have to
[1:39:41] spend this much
[1:39:43] money she knew if I could only get to
[1:39:46] him that's right that's when I get to
[1:39:49] him I want him to know that I'm giving
[1:39:51] him the the best that I can
[1:39:59] get I don't know how you feel tonight

[1:40:34] here cuz God spoke to me if you can get
[1:40:38] to
[1:40:39] Jesus how that people would drive 17
[1:40:44] hours to be in a meeting with brother
[1:40:46] brandham and some of them would even die
[1:40:49] on the way there and brother brandham
[1:40:50] would come to their car yeah and he
[1:40:52] would pray for them and they would be
[1:40:54] healed yeah three years ago God touched
[1:40:57] me I drove 17 hours to this
[1:41:00] place listen you may take brother Tim as
[1:41:03] just another man come on
[1:41:06] now but I
[1:41:09] don't I don't Jesus lives in that
[1:41:13] body Jesus lives in these
[1:41:17] men when I left after 3 days of being
[1:41:20] here
[1:41:21] I drove back home I was sicker than I
[1:41:24] came down but when I got back home God
[1:41:27] gave me a strength
[1:41:29] yes and I work every day since that time
[1:41:33] with these boys they can tell you that
[1:41:36] yeah let me just say this you I drove
[1:41:38] this
[1:41:40] [Music]
[1:41:40] [Applause]
[1:41:43] time not to get to a
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:47] man I'm not preaching here to get to a
[1:41:50] man
[1:41:52] I'm not even here to impress
[1:41:54] you but if you and I can get to in the
[1:41:58] room where he's
[1:42:06] at if we can get to where he's
[1:42:09] at if we can get to his feet and wash
[1:42:14] his feet with our
[1:42:16] tears and worship him I believe that we
[1:42:19] can leave this building completely
[1:42:22] [Applause]
[1:42:37] different you know
[1:42:42] Satan it must baffle
[1:42:47] him that here we are a people
[1:42:51] that fight with our own selves that's
[1:42:55] right sometimes we have difficulty with
[1:42:58] with knowing who we
[1:43:00] are but even he knows if you find out
[1:43:03] who you
[1:43:05] are then you become a Tormentor to
[1:43:08] him you become a live voice that he
[1:43:12] can't
[1:43:17] stop there's a voice behind your voice
[1:43:20] yeah there's a life behind your
[1:43:22] life your tabernacling deity
[1:43:26] itself God's in his word amen and when
[1:43:30] God's in his word Satan's always
[1:43:32] standing near trying to defeat the plan
[1:43:34] of
[1:43:35] God but let me just say this you God has
[1:43:37] given you authority over every devil in
[1:43:42] hell
[1:43:45] Hallelujah Israel tonight is under
[1:43:47] intense
[1:43:48] attack their intense attack back and
[1:43:51] their enemies trying to destroy them
[1:43:52] with everything that they have but I
[1:43:55] want to repeat and say this whether it
[1:43:58] goes globally or not he don't have
[1:44:03] [Applause]
[1:44:07] enough I don't care if all the countries
[1:44:09] go against Israel if God is on your side

[1:44:41] [Applause]
[1:44:43] report I don't care what it looks like

[1:46:52] atomic
[1:46:53] bomb or a hydrogen bomb as powerful as
[1:47:03] pray cuz you're not praying to a dead

[1:47:39] bluff and we're calling your bluff and

[2:13:13] promise well brother Ron it don't look
[2:13:15] like it's going to happen well just
[2:13:16] think about it it's not about what you
[2:13:19] think that it looks
[2:13:25] like Abraham looked
[2:13:29] fatherless but he kept telling what God
[2:13:32] told him to
[2:13:33] say come on Sarah looked like it
[2:13:36] couldn't
[2:13:37] happen but Satan hang around a little
[2:13:43] while brother L we got
[2:13:46] promises we got promises we do not have
[2:13:50] to live like underprivileged
[2:14:02] children God says I'll make you the head
[2:14:04] and not the tail I'll bless you coming
[2:14:07] in and I'll bless you going out I'll
[2:14:10] bless
[2:14:11] you you are the Queen of
[2:14:16] Heaven
[2:14:23] on now if you'd have been looking for a
[2:14:25] while it looked like the tent was empty
[2:14:28] just Abraham and
[2:14:30] Sarah but God said I'll make you the
[2:14:33] father of
[2:14:35] Nations when he took him out he showed
[2:14:37] him the sand of the sea can you count
[2:14:42] him no that'd be impossible so shall thy
[2:14:45] seed be he showed him the stars of the
[2:14:50] heaven can you count them so shall thy
[2:14:53] seed
[2:14:55] [Applause]
[2:14:56] be well now we can look back thousands
[2:14:59] of years and say I'm one of
[2:15:16] them
[2:15:21] God said he'd give us our children he'll
[2:15:23] give us our
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:26] [Applause]
[2:15:30] children are you with me now he said
[2:15:33] he'd watch over you he'll watch over you
[2:15:37] I just want to drop a couple more things
[2:15:38] here you're better protected than the
[2:15:42] president of the United States of
[2:15:46] America
[2:16:00] now think about that just for a moment
[2:16:02] those guys that take care of the
[2:16:05] president Eagle One when they take care
[2:16:08] of him they can only protect him from
[2:16:11] things that they hear about on the
[2:16:13] internet are the things that they
[2:16:16] see but another realm there's demons
[2:16:19] that try to destroy
[2:16:20] you and they're in attacked for you
[2:16:23] because you're Sons and Daughters of God
[2:16:25] the pillar of fire just wasn't in
[2:16:27] Houston but there's a pillar of fire
[2:16:29] watching over
[2:16:32] you and Satan can see that fire living
[2:16:35] on the inside of you he can see it and
[2:16:38] you're his enemy but you are not
[2:16:44] alone you are not alone
[2:16:48] God has dispatched angels to watch over
[2:16:51] [Applause]
[2:16:55] you
[2:16:57] Hallelujah I'm going to need a quote
[2:16:59] brother Ron okay God

[2:17:25] going to let the devil's Kingdom raise
[2:17:27] him that's I'm going to let the devil's
[2:17:30] Kingdom pay for his education that's
[2:17:34] right but one day I'm going to tell him

[2:17:57] infested waters it and you may feel so

[2:18:03] what's Happening standing on your
[2:18:08] basket it's Gabel
[2:18:12] himself and there's tens of thousands of
[2:18:15] Angels standing
[2:18:18] on the sides of the river and every time
[2:18:21] a crocodile comes up to destroy you
[2:18:24] Gabriel pushes it back down sleep on

[2:18:57] days there's going to be some people
[2:19:00] that walk into the
[2:19:03] room it's going to be real
[2:19:05] special because it's in the
[2:19:08] promise all
[2:19:11] right it's going to be a brown-headed
[2:19:13] girl maybe her hair will be at her knees
[2:19:17] and she'll look like her wedding
[2:19:24] picture her name will be
[2:19:30] Karen now this isn't a fairy
[2:19:33] tale I'm I'm just telling you what the
[2:19:36] vision says that's
[2:19:42] right
[2:19:44] now now people say that you can't have
[2:19:47] Visions or God don't do that no
[2:19:50] more but I brought I brought little my
[2:19:53] little buddy up here a while
[2:19:55] ago and the devil whispered in my ear
[2:19:58] for three
[2:20:02] years Whitney couldn't have children and
[2:20:05] Davy was crushed in an
[2:20:07] accident and he couldn't have children
[2:20:10] but the vision said Isaac was on his
[2:20:16] wayall listen you you saw
[2:20:20] it you saw it's little bow tie you saw
[2:20:24] it you can say I I believe that maybe

[2:20:29] about
[2:20:30] it brother Jeremy's here from the church
[2:20:32] you know the story I walked into the
[2:20:34] room and they said let me tell you his
[2:20:35] name I said no I'll tell you his name
[2:20:38] it's Isaac Jackson Breeden that's right
[2:20:41] that's absolutely right yeah God wasn't
[2:20:46] guessing
[2:20:49] brother Brandon wasn't
[2:20:51] guessing we're going to take a half a
[2:20:53] step this way and they're going to take
[2:20:54] a half a step this
[2:20:58] way now I'm not going to just guess here
[2:21:00] for you now some of you walked into this
[2:21:03] building one way and you're going to
[2:21:04] walk out
[2:21:16] another

[2:22:29] truth your father was in the meeting in
[2:22:32] North
[2:22:34] Carolina and in North Carolina he had a
[2:22:36] great burden on his heart we' been in a
[2:22:39] tent meeting the week
[2:22:41] before and in the tent meeting he had a
[2:22:43] great burden and as as the service was
[2:22:46] coming to an in there was a man that had
[2:22:49] walked down the aisle and he had
[2:22:50] crutches and braces on and before even
[2:22:54] while we preached even before this the
[2:22:58] sermon was over that man walked to the
[2:23:00] front about where the edge would be and
[2:23:03] that man took those braces off and he
[2:23:06] throwed those things back and he ran
[2:23:08] back to the
[2:23:09] back he didn't get to me he got to
[2:23:13] him that's
[2:23:16] right
[2:23:27] and your father had a great burden on
[2:23:29] his heart because there was a letter in
[2:23:32] his anti-et
[2:23:34] case that had a lot of vicious things
[2:23:36] about it that's right and the Lord spoke
[2:23:38] from the pull pit gido paid no attention
[2:23:41] to that letter it's of the
[2:23:43] devil I didn't know that letter was
[2:23:46] there but God did
[2:23:49] in next week Brother G was standing at
[2:23:52] the end of the service and standing
[2:23:53] behind the curtain and I never forget
[2:23:56] this because there was a lot of
[2:23:58] resistance it didn't hear tonight but
[2:24:00] there was a lot of resistance to the
[2:24:01] service and and and there was two
[2:24:04] preachers that were turning against the
[2:24:06] message you can't stop
[2:24:10] God I said if God can't operate out here
[2:24:13] he'll operate behind the
[2:24:15] curtain and when I stepped behind the
[2:24:17] curtain you're getting ready to go
[2:24:18] preach when I Ste behind the curtain uh
[2:24:21] there was two kids Joe Green's son and
[2:24:25] and daughter-in-law right and God gave
[2:24:28] them a
[2:24:29] baby that's right God gave them a baby
[2:24:33] and it was born exactly a year
[2:24:35] later another couple had needed a baby
[2:24:38] for 17 years and played for a baby and
[2:24:41] God gave them a
[2:24:42] baby and now they're getting ready to
[2:24:44] have a second
[2:24:45] baby that's right where I'm coming to
[2:24:49] you gido was standing there and he was
[2:24:51] worshiping the Lord and I said brother
[2:24:53] gido there's a train coming for
[2:24:57] you it'll be all right to get on it and
[2:25:00] in just a few weeks that train came and
[2:25:03] he stepped Beyond this realm of Tears
[2:25:06] that's
[2:25:08] right there was a man standing there
[2:25:11] that it set in the service and this is
[2:25:12] why I'm going there it set in the
[2:25:14] service for decades his name was
[2:25:18] Terry and in that spot maybe you've sat
[2:25:21] here for years and you haven't made a
[2:25:22] move for God W you call your name right
[2:25:26] there and Terry I had hunted in his tree
[2:25:28] stand he had been a friend but he
[2:25:31] wouldn't make a
[2:25:32] move church was just entertainment it
[2:25:35] was a place to go it was a place to be
[2:25:37] he was a part of the good old boy
[2:25:41] club I'll never forget
[2:25:43] it he was standing there beside the wall
[2:25:48] brother Homer longor was standing beside
[2:25:50] of
[2:25:51] him he said I can serve a god like
[2:25:54] that and in that moment we begin to
