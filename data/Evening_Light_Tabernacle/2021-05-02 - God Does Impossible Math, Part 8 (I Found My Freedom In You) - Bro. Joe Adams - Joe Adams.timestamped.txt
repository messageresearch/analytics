[43:00] heavens you are there
[43:01] no matter where we are god you are there
[43:04] and lord we believe this morning that
[43:05] you are right here with us
[43:07] to give strength support comfort lord a
[43:10] word of encouragement to the believer
[43:12] during their time of struggle and strife
[43:14] we asked almighty god that you just make
[43:16] yourself visible among us
[43:18] and we thank you lord that you're
[43:19] present and that your presence is here
[43:21] already father
[43:23] and lord it's nothing that we had done
[43:24] on our own human merit our human ability
[43:27] but it's because you're god and i'm so
[43:29] thankful lord i can look back over the
[43:31] course of my life lord
[43:33] many of the decisions that i had made
[43:34] many mistakes and heartaches but yet
[43:36] father
[43:37] through it all you saw before the
[43:39] foundation of the world that my name
[43:40] would be written in the book
[43:42] and god not only my name but the
[43:43] believers that are sitting here this
[43:45] morning their name were pinned there as
[43:46] well father
[43:47] you're coming today father just to
[43:49] manifest that word to
[43:50] strike a word across that that name lord
[43:53] to bring
[43:54] forth life and we just committed to you
[43:56] this morning father
[43:57] and we say we love you lord and we're so
[43:59] thankful and we just give this service
[44:01] to you lord
[44:02] father you see what i'm fighting back in
[44:04] my emotions this morning
[44:06] i'm asking for your strength now father
[44:08] i pray lord you'll anoint your servant
[44:10] lord just to
[44:11] step aside this morning and allow the
[44:13] spirit of christ to move and the
[44:15] minister
[44:16] and i also pray that you'll anoint the
[44:17] ears of the hearer lord
[44:19] that we can both hear and receive lord
[44:22] from the word today
[44:23] for we ask it in jesus name amen and
[44:26] amen
[44:27] just want to first say before we get
[44:29] into the word this morning
[44:30] if you give me a little bit more volume
[44:32] up here brother tim that would be great
[44:34] thanks for all the prayers all the texts
[44:37] to myself to our family during this time
[44:39] many of you probably didn't know but
[44:41] my brother-in-law nathan was killed in a
[44:43] car accident on thursday night
[44:46] tragic accident so we're having to deal
[44:49] with that this
[44:50] week and i've been at home alone as a
[44:52] family's up in virginia and
[44:54] trying to fight back the emotions and
[44:55] things of that nature and yet
[44:58] preparing to be able to speak to you
[44:59] this morning but you know it's great to
[45:01] know that you're loved and supported by
[45:02] a family a church family and
[45:04] not only our local family but there's
[45:06] texts and there's messages coming in
[45:08] throughout all around the world that
[45:09] know that we're related and
[45:11] it's just so nice to be loved and we
[45:13] appreciate your love we appreciate your
[45:15] support
[45:16] we appreciate your prayers but i would
[45:18] ask that if you do me a favor
[45:20] keep my mother law in your sincere
[45:22] deepest prayer
[45:24] she's hurting right now and rightly so
[45:26] she's lost her only son she lost her
[45:28] husband a few years ago or dad a couple
[45:30] months before that
[45:32] but i told her this morning i said i'll
[45:34] be the son that you never had
[45:38] said i'm gonna love you the way you
[45:39] wanted to be loved by your son
[45:41] and i mean that from the bottom of my
[45:42] heart and i believe that we can't take
[45:45] these moments that we've been given
[45:47] frivolous we got to cherish every moment
[45:49] every opportunity
[45:50] so today i may come with more what seems
[45:52] like a more evangelistic message
[45:56] and i just trusted something to be said
[45:57] that will speak to you we're going to
[45:58] speak on god does impossible
[46:00] math part 8 but i want to give it a
[46:02] subtitle i found my freedom in you
[46:05] if you're not here today or if you're
[46:07] here today and you haven't found that
[46:08] freedom yet i want you to know there's
[46:10] freedom in christ
[46:11] there's victory in christ you don't have
[46:12] to stay bound you don't have to live
[46:14] under your god-given privileges
[46:15] not when there's been a price that's
[46:17] been paid so we're going to look here in
[46:19] psalms 119 and verse 57
[46:22] as we start this morning says thou art
[46:24] my portion o lord
[46:26] i have said that i would keep thy words
[46:29] i am treated thy favor with my whole
[46:32] heart
[46:32] be merciful unto me according to thy
[46:35] word
[46:36] i thought on my ways and i turned my
[46:38] feet unto thy testimonies
[46:40] i made haste and delayed not to keep thy
[46:43] commandments if
[46:44] also we're going to look here in james 4
[46:46] and verse 14.
[46:49] james 4 and verse 14.
[46:52] whereas you know not what shall be on
[46:56] the morrow
[46:57] we don't know what tomorrow holds
[47:01] but if you're a believer this morning
[47:02] you know who holds your tomorrow
[47:05] and if you're not a believer this
[47:06] morning you have no hope
[47:08] but i want to introduce you this morning
[47:10] to a hope to more than a hope of faith
[47:13] that you can be anchored in him it says
[47:16] for what is your life
[47:17] it is even a vapor that appears for a
[47:20] little time
[47:21] and then vanishes away you can be seated
[47:23] this morning
[47:25] so like i said we're going to speak this
[47:26] morning on
[47:29] i found my freedom in you and as i began
[47:32] to study this
[47:33] in lieu of what just took place in our
[47:35] family and the loss of my brother-in-law
[47:37] and
[47:38] i just couldn't help but think life is
[47:40] so precious
[47:41] when moments it's here the next minute
[47:43] it's gone
[47:44] the bible will say it's like a vapor you
[47:46] just breathe it it's a myth
[47:48] when you breathe it out you can never
[47:49] get it back and that's how life is and
[47:52] the prophet god would tell us in the
[47:53] hebrew series
[47:54] he said what difference does it make if
[47:56] i'm 80 there's we have 80 year olds here
[47:59] tonight or this morning
[48:00] if i'm 20 i'm only here for one thing
[48:03] and that's to serve the lord
[48:05] so we're not here to see one another
[48:07] this morning we're not here to
[48:08] to rack up a bunch of dead or a bunch of
[48:11] a nice house and cars and things of that
[48:13] nature but
[48:14] we're here for one thing and that's to
[48:15] serve the lord he said there's many a
[48:17] man
[48:18] 80 years old tonight and there's lots of
[48:20] children will die
[48:21] when i am 80 year old and without live
[48:23] of many of them
[48:24] he says what difference does it make
[48:26] it's your motive and your principles
[48:28] and we're here to serve the lord jesus
[48:31] that's all
[48:33] knowing this that this life is a vapor
[48:35] that a man speaks about
[48:36] that once was and then is not but if we
[48:38] have eternal life
[48:39] god has promised that he would raise us
[48:42] up again
[48:44] so in little of what just took place for
[48:46] my brother-in-law i mean
[48:47] we didn't have much contact with him
[48:49] over the last several months but
[48:50] i want you to know this morning you know
[48:52] we're given an opportunity
[48:54] this sunday you're given an opportunity
[48:57] whether you're young whether you're old
[48:58] whether you're middle age whatever your
[49:00] situation
[49:01] whatever the background in your life in
[49:02] god has given you that opportunity this
[49:05] morning
[49:05] to make sure that you can look on your
[49:07] ways and say you know what i'm going to
[49:09] turn my feet to the testimonies
[49:11] of the lord this morning he says about
[49:13] 21 years he goes one day i had a battle
[49:15] with
[49:16] this and i battled with the other and i
[49:17] couldn't make out whether i wanted to be
[49:18] a fighter whether i want to be a trapper
[49:20] where i wanted to be a hunter
[49:21] what i want to do but he says i met
[49:23] melchizedek and he gave me my commission
[49:25] i wonder if we can meet that same
[49:27] melchizedek coming back from the battle
[49:29] he's already
[49:30] won your victory this morning if we can
[49:32] meet him this morning he said well
[49:33] brother joe you know i got this hanging
[49:34] on me and i got that hanging on me but
[49:36] i'm here to
[49:36] introduce you to the melchizedek i'm
[49:39] here this morning to introduce you to
[49:40] the one that can liberate your change
[49:42] and break you
[49:43] from the bondage that's been holding you
[49:44] back
[49:46] he goes i met melchizedek and he gave me
[49:48] a commission
[49:49] and since then it was settled forever
[49:52] and when it comes to the end of the road
[49:54] and their
[49:55] death stares me in the face the way that
[49:57] i feel now i'll never dread it
[49:59] i'll walk i won't walk in the face of it
[50:01] knowing this
[50:02] that i know him who has made the promise
[50:05] that's right
[50:05] that i know him in the power of his
[50:10] resurrection and that's how we want to
[50:12] know him this morning
[50:15] nathan shaw will never get another
[50:16] opportunity but you're giving one this
[50:19] morning
[50:20] i'm giving one this morning
[50:24] you have that opportunity today to seize
[50:27] your call
[50:28] and to make your calling an election
[50:30] sure
[50:31] see when he calls from the dead i'll
[50:32] come out from among them that's right
[50:34] knowing him in the power of the
[50:35] resurrection what difference does it
[50:37] make whether i'm old whether i'm young
[50:38] whether i'm little whether i'm big
[50:40] whether i'm full whether i'm hungry
[50:42] whether i have a place to lay my head
[50:44] the bible will tell us in matthew 8 and
[50:46] verse 20 says jesus says unto them the
[50:48] foxes have holes and the birds have net
[50:50] but the son of god don't even have a
[50:52] place to lay his head
[50:55] so i want you to know this morning he
[50:56] was born in another man's stable
[50:59] he was reared in another man's country
[51:00] he ate another man from another man's
[51:02] table
[51:03] he drank from another man's well he wore
[51:05] another man's robe he rode on another
[51:07] man's
[51:08] donkey he preached in another man's
[51:09] pulpit he prayed in another man's garden
[51:12] he was convicted for another man's crime
[51:14] he was hung on another man's cross
[51:16] he was buried in another man's grave but
[51:18] i want you to know this morning he rose
[51:20] again for another man's victory
[51:22] he runs again so you can live a life of
[51:24] freedom you wouldn't have to be bound by
[51:26] sin
[51:26] and not believe let me tell you he
[51:28] didn't have a place to lay his head but
[51:30] he provided a place for you this morning
[51:33] not only a place to lay your head but
[51:34] you can lay that soul
[51:36] in his bosom this morning and if that's
[51:38] what take you you'll be in the heart
[51:39] of the heavenly father
[51:42] so it's not all about what we gain on
[51:44] this side or houses and cars
[51:47] i'd rather be broke with jesus
[51:50] then be rich without him this morning
[51:52] i'd rather drive a hoop teeth than
[51:53] driving mercedes
[51:54] without him this morning i'd rather live
[51:56] in a shack
[51:57] than in a mansion without christ this
[51:59] morning i'd rather have
[52:01] jesus and all this money all the silver
[52:05] all the gold to live without him this
[52:08] morning
[52:10] you can have this whole world you can
[52:12] have all the fame you can have
[52:14] all the fortune you can have all that
[52:16] you just give me christ
[52:19] it's settled for me i remember when i
[52:22] was
[52:22] a young 21 year old 20 years old and
[52:24] that voice spoke to me in my car
[52:26] turned your car around that settled it
[52:30] for me and i trust today something will
[52:32] settle in your heart tonight
[52:34] or this morning rather that you can look
[52:36] back over your former conduct
[52:38] and your duties and your actions and you
[52:39] can turn your steps
[52:41] in your heart toward christ he said
[52:44] brother joe most of us are
[52:46] saved here this morning but some of us
[52:47] are not
[52:49] so we're going to preach evangelistic
[52:50] message and i just trust that you'll
[52:52] just support it this morning
[52:53] allow me to share my heart with you see
[52:56] today is the day of salvation
[52:59] seek god when he can be found you're not
[53:01] promised to walk out of these doors
[53:05] you're not promised tomorrow but you're
[53:07] given this opportunity today
[53:10] you know brother battle will talk about
[53:11] moses is moses began to think on his
[53:13] ways
[53:15] how he had went off on his own school
[53:17] and he know that there was a call of god
[53:18] in his life
[53:19] but he tried to work it all out on his
[53:21] own
[53:22] how many of you try to do it on your own
[53:26] oh we think we're somebody we use our
[53:27] intelligence to try to step ourselves up
[53:30] above somebody else and look down on
[53:32] others that
[53:32] maybe or don't have the fortune to be as
[53:34] intelligent you know they didn't make a
[53:36] 36 or 34 they may have made a 16
[53:38] on the a.c.t and yet we think we're
[53:42] above them because of our intelligence
[53:44] that doesn't mean anything
[53:48] you know moses tried this he knew he he
[53:50] had been reared he'd been he's been told
[53:52] all his life
[53:52] you're the promised son you're the
[53:54] special one you're going to deliver
[53:55] god's people
[53:56] and what did moses do he did it under
[53:58] moses efforts
[53:59] and not god's effort and any time we go
[54:02] off without god
[54:03] we become failures we become we we look
[54:06] back and we see oh i made this mistake
[54:08] and i hurt this people and i've done
[54:09] this and moses ran from the presence of
[54:12] the lord
[54:13] and he was on the back side of the
[54:14] desert for 40 years wandering around
[54:16] and around and around and it looked like
[54:18] his life didn't amount to much
[54:20] nothing but a sheep herder and that may
[54:23] be where we are this morning just
[54:24] wandering around and around what is my
[54:26] life
[54:27] i felt this call of god but yet here i
[54:29] am
[54:30] hurting my father-in-law's sheep i don't
[54:32] even have my own sheep
[54:33] what have i amounted to in life
[54:36] and no doubt the devil's there just
[54:38] sworn on moses moses look
[54:39] you did this and you did that and you
[54:41] shouldn't have done this and you
[54:42] shouldn't have done that
[54:44] but like like moses many of us we tried
[54:46] on our own
[54:48] and what do we do we scar those that
[54:50] love us
[54:52] and we have our lives full and he
[54:54] already wrote moses name there
[54:55] to honor that word to fulfill that
[54:57] commission and i'm going to tell you i
[54:59] don't care what you're going through
[55:00] this morning
[55:00] god has already saw your name there he's
[55:02] already saw the situation
[55:04] and he's already prepared you to receive
[55:06] that experience
[55:07] that you know that you know that you
[55:09] know that god is real
[55:11] he's not a fictition he's not a story of
[55:13] yesterday but he's a living god
[55:15] he's a present god he's an old-time guy
[55:18] and he's your god this morning
[55:23] see there was a germ of life placed on
[55:24] the inside of moses
[55:26] and it was called the call of god see
[55:28] moses had this call
[55:30] and that call of god led moses to a
[55:33] backside of the desert experience
[55:35] and he came in the presence of the
[55:36] burning bush because of a call that was
[55:39] placed there
[55:40] mama didn't give him that call daddy
[55:42] didn't give him that call
[55:43] god gave him the call and that's why
[55:46] you're here this morning
[55:47] you may have thought you just traveled
[55:48] all these miles
[55:50] to come see family god placed you here
[55:54] because he's got a burning bush for you
[55:58] oh god's got a burning bush it ain't
[56:01] being consumed
[56:04] notice now and the call of god in your
[56:06] life will lead you
[56:08] to that same burning bush program says
[56:11] if you'll realize that you're a son and
[56:12] daughter of god
[56:13] that deposit was made in calvary and you
[56:16] got a checkbook
[56:17] in your hand write anything you want on
[56:19] it there god's promise to take care of
[56:21] it
[56:23] many times we're afraid to sign the
[56:24] check i got paid on friday how many you
[56:27] got paid on friday
[56:29] okay last friday there's bills you got
[56:32] to pay
[56:34] you're not going to write that check out
[56:35] if you doubt that there's money in it
[56:37] no but when you got the confidence that
[56:39] you got the money in the bank
[56:40] you write that check out happily maybe
[56:44] depends on how big it is right but here
[56:47] it is god is telling you
[56:48] that your name on the checkbook is just
[56:51] as good as the father's
[56:52] and i'm going to tell you even like
[56:53] tabernacle you can't exhaust the
[56:55] inexhaustible fountain of life you got a
[56:58] need this morning
[56:59] just write it out this morning he's the
[57:01] knee supply you need healing he's a
[57:03] healer you need deliverance he's your
[57:05] delivery
[57:06] you need salvation he's here to save
[57:08] he's already paid the price
[57:09] you need the holy ghost he's here to
[57:11] drop the holy ghost into your heart this
[57:13] morning
[57:17] see god is infinite and when god speaks
[57:19] it's perfect
[57:21] so don't try to alter it and you find me
[57:23] in there trying to alter god's word
[57:25] if you're trying to make it say this and
[57:26] they can say that just say what it says
[57:29] let god come and bring it to pass see we
[57:32] can't alter god's word
[57:34] we have to alter our thinking that's why
[57:36] the bible will tell us let the mind that
[57:37] was in christ
[57:39] being you because when you take the mind
[57:41] of christ in you then you no longer
[57:43] alter
[57:43] your thinking or his thinking but you
[57:46] alter your thing into him
[57:48] see there's no man that comes into the
[57:50] presence
[57:51] of his own past but when he gets tore up
[57:54] about it
[57:56] how many you got to pass this morning
[57:58] how many would like to come up here this
[58:00] morning if i gave you an opportunity
[58:01] and share with the church what your past
[58:03] was
[58:06] you'd be humiliated some of it ain't
[58:09] more speaking about
[58:14] well the prophet of god would say
[58:15] there's no man that comes into the
[58:16] presence of his past
[58:17] but when he gets tore up for the things
[58:20] that he's done
[58:21] maybe the people that he's hurt the
[58:23] words that he has spoke
[58:28] and moses began to think on his way as
[58:30] an old man here he is now 80 years old
[58:32] and he
[58:32] begins to think i ruined my life
[58:37] i'm 80 years old i thought that when i
[58:40] was a young man i would have done the
[58:41] right thing
[58:42] but now it's too far now i've seen away
[58:45] my day of grace i had my opportunity
[58:47] when i was 40. you know 40 is not old
[58:50] for y'all that's 40.

[1:00:32] notice now moses hughes's intelligence
[1:00:36] his strength his knowledge
[1:00:37] his human ability but none of that
[1:00:40] produced the manifestation of the word
[1:00:43] none of that none of his effort
[1:00:45] produced the efforts or the
[1:00:47] manifestation
[1:00:49] only the encounter with the burning bush
[1:00:53] only the encounter with the angel of the
[1:00:54] covenant produce
[1:00:57] what moses was supposed to be what moses
[1:01:00] was god ordained to be
[1:01:01] and that was the prophet to deliver the
[1:01:03] people
[1:01:04] and it's not until you meet that same
[1:01:06] burning bush it's not until you meet
[1:01:08] that same christ
[1:01:09] that same angel that you become the very
[1:01:12] manifestation
[1:01:13] of the word of this hour a bride for
[1:01:15] christ
[1:01:18] the bible tells us or the prophet of god
[1:01:20] will tell us in god's commission of
[1:01:21] moses he said
[1:01:22] moses slipped off his shoes and started
[1:01:24] walking in
[1:01:26] see the angel lord jesus christ was
[1:01:28] setting in that bush
[1:01:30] that's why that bush didn't consume
[1:01:32] because it wasn't the bush that was on
[1:01:34] fire
[1:01:34] it was god radiating from the midst of
[1:01:37] the bush
[1:01:39] the angel of the covenant was jesus
[1:01:40] christ he was a rock in the wilderness
[1:01:42] he was the brass serpent he was
[1:01:44] in all the patriarchs he was in david
[1:01:46] and he was down through the new
[1:01:47] testament and he's in the church tonight
[1:01:49] just the same jesus the same yesterday
[1:01:52] today
[1:01:53] and forever and notice
[1:01:56] all the stories that his mom told him
[1:01:59] didn't produce it
[1:02:03] all his human ability never produced it
[1:02:08] but one encounter five minutes in the
[1:02:11] presence of the angel of the lord
[1:02:13] gave moses the commission that he knew
[1:02:16] there was a call in his heart for
[1:02:18] notice it changed moses's thinking not
[1:02:21] just for a month not till just the next
[1:02:23] service
[1:02:24] or to the special preacher came by no
[1:02:25] but it changed moses his thinking
[1:02:28] not his doctrine it changed moses's
[1:02:30] heart it turned his heart from
[1:02:32] sheepherder
[1:02:33] to now to be a man of god commissioned
[1:02:35] to do
[1:02:36] what god ordained him to do here he was
[1:02:38] 40 years he carried the guilt
[1:02:40] of killing one egyptian and failing to
[1:02:42] deliver god's people
[1:02:43] this hung on moses and hung on moses
[1:02:45] every day he went out
[1:02:46] to heard the sheep and he was all alone
[1:02:49] and no doubt
[1:02:50] satan was there to remind him look you
[1:02:51] killed this man and you did this and
[1:02:53] you're nothing but a failure most and it
[1:02:55] circled around and circled around
[1:02:57] 40 years he dealt with that but i'm
[1:02:59] gonna tell you one moment in the
[1:03:00] presence of the angel
[1:03:01] one moment in the presence of the
[1:03:03] burning bush all that guilt left
[1:03:05] all that sin left all those chains of
[1:03:07] bondage
[1:03:08] left moses and now he was coming to his
[1:03:10] commission
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:13] now he could go back and face his egypt
[1:03:18] not face egypt as a runaway prophet but
[1:03:21] as god's anointed servant to deliver the
[1:03:22] people
[1:03:24] god's anointed servant to fulfill the
[1:03:26] scripture he was no longer bound by his
[1:03:28] failures and his mistakes
[1:03:30] but now he was free to serve god in
[1:03:32] whatever capacity
[1:03:33] the lord desired him notice the mission
[1:03:36] may have seemed foolish
[1:03:38] but moses moses found his freedom in the
[1:03:40] burning bush
[1:03:43] and i trust this morning if you haven't
[1:03:45] found that freedom yet
[1:03:46] you'll find it in this burning bush
[1:03:50] through the same angel lord that meant
[1:03:51] moses he's been appearing in evening
[1:03:53] light's tabernacle
[1:03:54] he's been appearing at these camp
[1:03:55] meetings in virginia he's a period in
[1:03:58] oklahoma he's appearing around the world
[1:03:59] doing what
[1:04:00] he's setting the bush on fire to attract
[1:04:02] the attention of god's elect
[1:04:04] so that they too can have that same
[1:04:05] commission so that they too can be set
[1:04:07] on fire
[1:04:08] so that they too can enjoy the presence
[1:04:10] of the almighty and be free from
[1:04:12] anything that would try to hold over
[1:04:13] them
[1:04:14] remember i spoke to you just the other
[1:04:15] night on you you may have a past but
[1:04:17] your past
[1:04:18] doesn't have to have you no you come in
[1:04:21] the presence of that same burning bush
[1:04:23] it's here to liberate you from your
[1:04:24] failures
[1:04:25] from your mistakes it's here to to give
[1:04:27] you power and anointing to face your
[1:04:29] egypt
[1:04:29] not face your egypt but to conquer your
[1:04:31] egypt that's what god has called us to
[1:04:33] do in this hour we're in the midst of
[1:04:35] laodicea every
[1:04:36] every tension of man his own evil all
[1:04:38] the politics every law that they're
[1:04:40] writing is against us as a believer
[1:04:42] but if god can turn your attention this
[1:04:44] morning to him
[1:04:45] and to his word it'll give you something
[1:04:47] they can write any law they want but
[1:04:49] they can't put you back in bonds
[1:04:51] they can't put you back in chains
[1:04:53] because the liberator has come
[1:04:54] and he that the son is made free he's
[1:04:57] free indeed
[1:04:57] he's free to serve god he's free to
[1:04:59] worship god he's free without failures
[1:05:02] he's free without mistake he's free
[1:05:03] without his past he's free this morning
[1:05:06] and if you can experience that freedom
[1:05:08] i'm telling you oh you couldn't sit
[1:05:09] there and be quiet you'd understand my
[1:05:11] god is real
[1:05:12] he saved me he delivered me he set me
[1:05:15] free
[1:05:15] i can't go back to hell i can't go back
[1:05:18] to the boss
[1:05:19] i've been liberated i've been free
[1:05:22] [Music]
[1:05:26] think about the jews when they when they
[1:05:28] come out of the concentration camps
[1:05:32] you couldn't look at one of them and say
[1:05:33] go back
[1:05:35] go back no they've been mistreated
[1:05:38] they've been starved they've been
[1:05:40] butilized
[1:05:43] they were made to work when they had no
[1:05:44] strength
[1:05:46] and when they came in there and they
[1:05:47] liberated them the jews made a decree
[1:05:51] never again never
[1:05:54] again what about it bride
[1:05:58] you're liberated this morning but the
[1:06:00] devil's here constantly trying to put
[1:06:02] you back in chains
[1:06:03] it's cause they try to put you back in
[1:06:05] bondage well there's got to be something
[1:06:07] rise up from within never again
[1:06:09] never again i've been liberated i've
[1:06:12] been set free
[1:06:13] all the things that i used to do i don't
[1:06:15] do no more i can't be held accountable
[1:06:17] to that
[1:06:17] because i've been forgiven
[1:06:23] so he'll fill you with the holy boldness
[1:06:25] that no matter what the obstacles you
[1:06:26] face
[1:06:28] there is no devil there's not enough
[1:06:30] devils
[1:06:31] to distract you from your commission
[1:06:35] oh i love it god give you a mission
[1:06:38] god put a calling in your heart to be
[1:06:40] the bride
[1:06:42] and in his presence we find the freedom
[1:06:45] we find the boldness we find the courage
[1:06:48] to do what god's called us to do
[1:06:50] we face in our prayer lines brother
[1:06:54] aaron can testify with me
[1:06:56] i was in a prayer line with brother
[1:06:57] danny seaman we had it here in our
[1:06:58] easter meetings
[1:07:00] demons begin to cry out see demons don't
[1:07:02] want to let you go if they got you
[1:07:04] i had one cry out i said leave me alone
[1:07:08] raised up leave me alone say oh you
[1:07:11] don't picked on the wrong son of god
[1:07:12] today
[1:07:14] leave me alone nothing you're coming out
[1:07:17] because that's our commission
[1:07:19] oh let me tell you every son and
[1:07:20] daughter of god deserves to be set free
[1:07:22] and if you don't believe in casting out
[1:07:24] of them i'm gonna tell you to come too
[1:07:26] late but god seen god do it once
[1:07:28] twice three four however many times
[1:07:30] god's never walked into a battle but
[1:07:32] when he come out packing a victory he
[1:07:34] can do it in an evening life he can do
[1:07:35] it in virginia he's done in oklahoma
[1:07:37] he's done an easter camp i'm gonna say
[1:07:39] he's the same god this morning
[1:07:43] brother larry and i was praying with a
[1:07:44] young girl just here a few weeks back
[1:07:47] and that demon spoke out you can't have
[1:07:49] her
[1:07:50] handle bound by change oh before the
[1:07:54] service was over
[1:07:55] god had her because his chains
[1:07:58] ain't strong enough to defeat the power
[1:08:01] of god
[1:08:02] no but it's in the presence of the angel
[1:08:05] chains began to break off
[1:08:10] when you think on your path the prophet
[1:08:11] of god would tell us it'll either drive
[1:08:12] you to god
[1:08:13] or drive you away from god and i trust
[1:08:16] this morning some of you this here
[1:08:18] you can think on the things you've done
[1:08:19] your past
[1:08:22] let that drive you to god don't let it
[1:08:24] drive you away
[1:08:26] but let it drive you to him this morning
[1:08:28] maybe you're a backstop or smoking
[1:08:31] maybe you're in a saloon whiskey
[1:08:32] drinking and things of that nature you
[1:08:34] defiled your life to foul
[1:08:35] others lives so cheated denied the
[1:08:37] gospel that you're trying to represent
[1:08:38] maybe you've done these things
[1:08:40] but won't you turn from it today god is
[1:08:42] wanting you to be different
[1:08:44] god wants us to be dead he requires us
[1:08:46] to be different
[1:08:48] he don't want us to to live in bondage
[1:08:50] when he's been he's coming he sent his
[1:08:51] only son to break those
[1:08:53] chains of indifference and unbelief and
[1:08:56] you know the the
[1:08:57] the reality of our the not the reality
[1:08:59] but the
[1:09:00] the haunts of our past see those that
[1:09:03] can come to him
[1:09:04] like peter can find mercy and the bible
[1:09:07] would tell us that god is rich
[1:09:08] in mercy we find that in ephesians 2 but
[1:09:12] god who is rich
[1:09:13] and however however how many of y'all
[1:09:15] ever met a rich man
[1:09:17] don't look oh you yeah some of y'all
[1:09:18] have read him met a rich man i'll tell
[1:09:20] you you like to be around the rich man
[1:09:22] don't you
[1:09:22] man he pays for everything you go to

[1:09:31] for the tab somebody rich man is fun to
[1:09:34] be with hannah you want to be friends
[1:09:35] with the rich man
[1:09:37] but there's one thing about the rich man
[1:09:38] he has to go and make more money
[1:09:40] to replenish what he's already spent but
[1:09:42] this god that we serve he's a rich man
[1:09:44] he's a god who's rich in mercy
[1:09:46] and he never cannot he never has to go
[1:09:48] back and replenish his mercy
[1:09:50] he's the inexhaustible fountain of life
[1:09:52] he's the inexhaustible fountain of mercy
[1:09:54] and mercy of grace and the fountain of
[1:09:56] healing
[1:09:56] and the fountain of the he's a rich god

[1:10:01] you gotta need this money he'll just
[1:10:03] sell a few so that he can make a way for
[1:10:04] his sons and his daughters this morning
[1:10:08] oh my
[1:10:12] it's so funny sometimes you know you got
[1:10:13] young kids that think you're rich
[1:10:16] oh brother joe you're rich when they say
[1:10:19] you live in a nice house let's say you
[1:10:21] drive a nice car
[1:10:22] those things are not not riches
[1:10:25] those are just things of time things
[1:10:28] that's gonna perish if you want to look
[1:10:30] at brother joe and say he's rich look at
[1:10:31] what god has done for brother joe
[1:10:33] look what god has done for you if you
[1:10:35] want to talk about being rich
[1:10:37] you're rich in mercy some of you've
[1:10:39] received that mercy in your life
[1:10:41] some of you that you you wouldn't have
[1:10:42] given a nickel for but god rich and
[1:10:44] mercy came by your way and done
[1:10:46] something supernatural
[1:10:47] that's being rich oh we're all rich this
[1:10:50] morning this church is so rich in talent
[1:10:54] just so i put you on record i had a
[1:10:55] dream the other night that i could sing
[1:10:59] i was like god please let that come to
[1:11:00] pass man i was behind here preaching and
[1:11:03] started singing brother aaron just tore
[1:11:05] it up i felt so good i woke up
[1:11:06] i was like man praise god tried to sing
[1:11:10] again
[1:11:10] like oh that was flat so you know the
[1:11:14] bible says you just gotta stay in your
[1:11:15] column where with your calls
[1:11:17] so i'm gonna stay there but god is rich
[1:11:20] in mercy
[1:11:22] he's rich in grace he's rich in love
[1:11:25] he's rich and he's done so much for us
[1:11:28] never take
[1:11:29] the opportunity to walk through these
[1:11:30] doors for granted
[1:11:33] because it may be your moment and it's
[1:11:35] not for you it may be your child's
[1:11:36] moment
[1:11:36] and not for your child it may be your
[1:11:38] grandchild's moment that they meet the
[1:11:40] god that you met
[1:11:42] they may meet god on the backside of a
[1:11:43] desert and that burning bush begins to
[1:11:46] crackle and pop
[1:11:47] and begin to call their name and draw
[1:11:49] them to himself
[1:11:54] see if you can see the day that he was
[1:11:55] smitten for you
[1:11:57] then you wouldn't continue to live in
[1:11:58] sin you will continue to live a halfway
[1:12:01] christian life
[1:12:02] if you can see what he'd done for you
[1:12:03] the price that he paid
[1:12:06] if you could visually see the nail scars
[1:12:09] if you could see his back
[1:12:11] who was stripped with catalyned tails if
[1:12:13] you could see the nails in his hands and
[1:12:14] appeared
[1:12:15] the spear that pierced his side i don't
[1:12:17] think there would be a one of you today
[1:12:19] that could stay the same thursday night
[1:12:22] i drove out to a crash site
[1:12:24] because i got a call that maybe my
[1:12:26] brother-in-law was in an accident
[1:12:28] he may not make it when i got there i
[1:12:31] asked the officer i said sir i said
[1:12:33] i just saw the ambulance go by said did
[1:12:35] they take him to the hospital he said
[1:12:37] uh they don't take dead bodies to the
[1:12:39] hospital
[1:12:41] and i was floored i said he didn't make
[1:12:43] it he said no he didn't make it he's
[1:12:45] right over there
[1:12:48] he's right over there
[1:12:52] see he's never going to get that
[1:12:53] opportunity back but you had that
[1:12:55] opportunity today
[1:12:58] you had that opportunity today so he
[1:13:01] said well brother joe this is
[1:13:02] this is just we're all saved here we're
[1:13:04] all christians here we may be but there
[1:13:05] may be some of you struggling with your
[1:13:06] freedom
[1:13:08] some of you may be struggling what god
[1:13:10] has really done for you and yeah you may
[1:13:12] be free to
[1:13:12] a certain point and we're going to get a
[1:13:15] little bit further into this because we
[1:13:16] have
[1:13:17] all you know like brother tim would say
[1:13:18] we got all day
[1:13:20] i don't plan on preaching to you all day
[1:13:21] we'll let brother aaron come step up but
[1:13:23] nevertheless if we could see what he'd
[1:13:25] done for us
[1:13:26] if we could see that body laying on a
[1:13:28] cross
[1:13:30] for your sins for my sins
[1:13:34] i woke up this morning at four o'clock
[1:13:36] in the morning with that image of my
[1:13:37] brother-in-law in my head
[1:13:41] i can just imagine if i could see the
[1:13:42] image of christ visible
[1:13:44] when he gave up the ghost and said it is
[1:13:46] finished and every one of you came in
[1:13:48] mind
[1:13:50] every one of you passed by his mind it
[1:13:52] is finished
[1:13:53] two thousand years later in the midst of
[1:13:54] laodicea and even like tabernacle i'll
[1:13:56] pay for this one
[1:13:57] and that one and that one and that one
[1:13:59] and that one and that one
[1:14:01] and that one and that one you'll never
[1:14:03] get that image
[1:14:04] out of your head if you can see what
[1:14:07] he'd done for you
[1:14:08] he'll run to the cross of calvary
[1:14:11] they would say that the the roman
[1:14:13] soldier there that
[1:14:14] pierced his side and he saw the
[1:14:16] blackness come and the blood washed out
[1:14:19] and
[1:14:19] the water come out of his side and
[1:14:21] everything and it was all over he began
[1:14:23] to look back on it
[1:14:24] and he said he's nothing but almighty
[1:14:27] god
[1:14:28] and the prophet of god would say he
[1:14:29] turned and he looked at his ways and he
[1:14:31] gave his heart to god at the foot of the
[1:14:33] cross
[1:14:34] i wonder how many of us can do that in a
[1:14:36] sunday service
[1:14:37] we can push our pride aside
[1:14:41] and so yeah you know what i'm tired of
[1:14:42] pretending
[1:14:44] and let this be your sunday service that
[1:14:47] you see that visible body
[1:14:49] that paid that price for you never get
[1:14:52] that image out of your head
[1:14:54] crucify so that you could be free hung
[1:14:57] on a cross so you wouldn't have to hang
[1:14:59] put in a tomb so you wouldn't have to go
[1:15:01] there went to hell so you wouldn't have
[1:15:02] to go to hell
[1:15:04] he's here today to do something
[1:15:06] supernatural for each of us that's here
[1:15:09] he's here today to rewrite your story
[1:15:11] what satan says it's got to be this way
[1:15:13] god says no
[1:15:15] i'm here to rewrite their story see your
[1:15:17] life doesn't have to end in tragedy
[1:15:19] but you can come from tragedy to triumph
[1:15:23] you can rise above it now it may look
[1:15:25] like everything's going against you you
[1:15:26] may have been a moses where
[1:15:28] you're on the backside of the desert and
[1:15:29] it seems like you're just hurting sheep
[1:15:31] and
[1:15:31] you know life has been unfair and you've
[1:15:33] been dealt a bad hand and you've been in
[1:15:34] this marriage and that marriage and
[1:15:36] you know just all these failures but yet
[1:15:38] today you can rise from tragedy
[1:15:40] to triumph and you can find your freedom
[1:15:43] in christ
[1:15:44] and when you ever find it and experience
[1:15:47] true freedom
[1:15:48] there's not enough devils in hell can
[1:15:49] put you back in bondage
[1:15:51] there's not enough devils in hell can
[1:15:53] put you back in bondage pilate
[1:15:54] they was here in matthew 27 verse 24
[1:15:57] when pilate saw that
[1:15:58] he could not prevail nothing but rather
[1:16:00] rather but
[1:16:01] that rather a turmoil was made he took
[1:16:03] water and he washed his hands before the
[1:16:05] multitude
[1:16:06] and saying i am innocent of the blood of
[1:16:08] this just person notice
[1:16:11] they couldn't find any fault in christ
[1:16:13] the pharisees couldn't find fault
[1:16:15] sadducees couldn't find fault pilate
[1:16:17] couldn't find fault there was no fault
[1:16:19] in our lamb
[1:16:20] the fault is in us the fault is in us
[1:16:25] and the only way that we'll ever get the
[1:16:27] blood off our hands is to put it in our
[1:16:29] heart
[1:16:30] to accept what he's done but i want you
[1:16:32] to know this morning there's still a
[1:16:33] fountain filled with blood
[1:16:35] drawn from emmanuel's veins or the
[1:16:38] center

[1:16:41] beneath that flood and lose all their

[1:19:54] start a minute
[1:19:56] you know we allow fear to come back and
[1:19:57] it grips us and we can't move we allow
[1:19:59] complexes worried about what somebody
[1:20:00] else thinks about us how we're going to
[1:20:02] worship and it may not be the norm who
[1:20:04] cares about how
[1:20:04] what people think about us and we could
[1:20:06] come with depression and we come with
[1:20:08] anxieties and we got all these things
[1:20:09] that we bring into the house of god but
[1:20:10] i want you to know he's here to liberate
[1:20:12] you this morning
[1:20:13] all that you got to do is say mr ups
[1:20:15] agent i'm not signing for it i refuse to
[1:20:18] have it the bible says to resist the
[1:20:20] devil and he shall flee
[1:20:21] it's time that we as sons and daughters
[1:20:23] of god show the devil what we're made
[1:20:24] out of
[1:20:24] and tell them look i ain't going to take
[1:20:26] it any longer
[1:20:28] you can take this stuff back you can't
[1:20:30] you can't block me mr devil
[1:20:32] i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god
[1:20:34] i'm made out of stuff that don't bluff i
[1:20:36] receive my freedom and that entitles me
[1:20:38] to every promise of god and entitles me
[1:20:41] to liberation
[1:20:42] it entitles me to the blessing and every
[1:20:44] promise in his word
[1:20:45] it entitles me to healing and
[1:20:47] deliverance and salvation and i free
[1:20:49] from depression
[1:20:50] and i free from fear and i free from
[1:20:52] anxieties and i free from conflict
[1:20:54] it entitles me to that this morning you
[1:20:56] can take your stuff mr devil
[1:20:58] and go to hell with it i'm a son of god
[1:21:02] i've been liberated
[1:21:03] i've been set free from the bonds of
[1:21:05] seeing this
[1:21:06] crimp my life see it gives you a
[1:21:10] boldness
[1:21:11] when you recognize your freedom when you
[1:21:14] recognize you're not bound any longer
[1:21:16] it puts something on the inside of a
[1:21:18] believer
[1:21:20] you recognize it's god calling you it's
[1:21:23] god's placing you
[1:21:24] it's god positioning you
[1:21:27] see god didn't call you and position you
[1:21:29] to be defeated but god called you and
[1:21:31] positioned you
[1:21:32] to be a mighty conqueror
[1:21:37] see the devil would put us in a pawn
[1:21:38] shop but jesus came to redeem us
[1:21:43] we've all been in a pawn shop and the
[1:21:46] problem is that some of us still have
[1:21:48] pawn shop mentality
[1:21:51] you got a checkbook with his name on it
[1:21:56] you can go to macy's and you're going to
[1:21:58] the pawn shop
[1:22:00] why get something used when you can get
[1:22:02] something new
[1:22:04] why get somebody else experienced when
[1:22:06] you can get his experience
[1:22:07] why copy some preacher where you can get
[1:22:09] the preacher of preachers
[1:22:11] experience why get go sign up for a
[1:22:14] doctor's healing when you can get a true
[1:22:16] healing and a true deliverance
[1:22:18] oh let me tell you the pawn shop
[1:22:19] mentality the devil may have put you
[1:22:21] there because
[1:22:22] our forefathers are adam and eve sold us
[1:22:25] into sin
[1:22:26] but jesus christ had paid the price he
[1:22:28] paid the ultimate price
[1:22:29] and you don't have to be in seeing any
[1:22:31] longer you don't have to be in the pawn
[1:22:33] shop any longer
[1:22:34] you can break that pump shop mentality
[1:22:36] and say i've got a credit card i got
[1:22:38] a checkbook with the name of jesus
[1:22:39] written on it i can go down to macy's
[1:22:41] and get anything i want
[1:22:44] i can come into the house with god and i
[1:22:46] can worship and i can praise god
[1:22:49] because i got a checkbook this morning i
[1:22:51] can pray for my lost loved ones
[1:22:53] i can pray for healing i can pray for
[1:22:54] deliverance i can pray for whatever i
[1:22:56] need prayer for
[1:22:57] and god's gonna respond god's gonna
[1:22:58] answer god's gonna move because why
[1:23:00] because i recognize
[1:23:01] i'm not in the phone shop anymore i've
[1:23:03] been set free
[1:23:05] reminds me brother brown our brother man

[1:23:08] he called johnny crow he scared all the
[1:23:10] other crows away

[1:24:57] sin so long that you don't know you
[1:24:58] that you've been released but one step

[1:25:02] freedom
[1:25:03] one path one step past that chain sin
[1:25:05] can't hold you any longer
[1:25:06] fear can't hold you any longer
[1:25:08] depression can't hold you any longer
[1:25:09] suicide can't hold you you take that
[1:25:11] first step past that chain

[1:25:21] eagle a flying eagle as you can soar

[1:25:33] he said the devil may have tied you up
[1:25:35] but that's a good man jesus christ who
[1:25:37] redeemed you
[1:25:38] he cut every string loose from you when
[1:25:40] you see the rest of them rise into their
[1:25:42] feet and believe in it
[1:25:43] go the same way man you see the movement
[1:25:46] of the spirit and young people begin to
[1:25:48] move and fall out and just enjoy the
[1:25:51] presence of the lord
[1:25:52] come on johnny don't sit there critical
[1:25:56] johnny
[1:25:57] don't sit there with that negative
[1:25:58] mentality i'm tied up you ain't tired
[1:26:02] no you the the the good man of the house
[1:26:04] has come by jesus christ
[1:26:06] he come and paid your price and he cut
[1:26:08] those strings
[1:26:09] that's held you bound the prophet god
[1:26:12] will tell us you're free
[1:26:13] every one of you jesus cut loose that a
[1:26:16] long time ago
[1:26:17] you're not bound any longer on calvary's
[1:26:19] cause he freed you there
[1:26:21] he loosed you there you don't have to be
[1:26:22] bound any longer by your past mistake
[1:26:24] he set you free at calvary's cross
[1:26:29] just refuse to have it
[1:26:32] revelations 1 and verse 5 says and from
[1:26:35] jesus christ
[1:26:36] who is the faithful witness and the
[1:26:38] first begotten of the dead the prince of
[1:26:40] the kings of the earth
[1:26:41] unto him that loved us and he washed us
[1:26:46] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[1:26:48] that word washer means
[1:26:50] loosed so he loosed us from our sins
[1:26:54] in his own blood he said isn't that
[1:26:56] wonderful because if you're spiritual
[1:26:58] minded did you catch it it was
[1:27:00] his own blood that looks just completely
[1:27:02] from our sins it was not the blood of a
[1:27:04] human it was not the blood of god peter
[1:27:05] would call it the blood of
[1:27:06] blood of christ paul would call it the
[1:27:08] blood of the lord and the blood of jesus
[1:27:09] not three persons
[1:27:10] but one person there is that revelation
[1:27:13] again one god
[1:27:15] the omnipotent jehovah god came down and
[1:27:17] made himself a body by means
[1:27:19] of a virgin birth and dwelt in it that
[1:27:21] it might be the blood of god that would
[1:27:23] free us
[1:27:23] loose us entirely from our sins and
[1:27:27] present us spotless
[1:27:28] before him with exceeding great joy
[1:27:31] notice
[1:27:32] since it was the blood of god it's a
[1:27:33] perfect blood
[1:27:35] and if it was a perfect blood that
[1:27:36] loosed us then it's a perfect loosing
[1:27:39] you can never be bound again
[1:27:43] there's therefore now now in this
[1:27:45] service this morning
[1:27:47] no condemnation who shall lay anything
[1:27:50] to the charge of god's elect but it's
[1:27:52] god that justified
[1:27:53] otherwise it's god that declares you
[1:27:55] righteous this morning
[1:27:57] it is he who is he that is condemned but
[1:27:59] is christ that died
[1:28:00] he said there it is his death gave us
[1:28:02] blood the blood has loosed us
[1:28:03] there is there now no condemnation how
[1:28:06] can there be
[1:28:06] there is nothing to be condemned for
[1:28:08] because the blood has loosed us
[1:28:11] from sin we are free
[1:28:14] we are guiltless he says don't listen to
[1:28:16] man listen to the word you are loose
[1:28:19] by the blood
[1:28:22] and the revelations of jesus christ he
[1:28:25] would give a
[1:28:26] an accommodation or he would give a word
[1:28:28] of encouragement he said now don't get
[1:28:29] tied down again by traditions and creeds
[1:28:31] and organizations
[1:28:34] we've found that men have taken this
[1:28:36] message and what a pure
[1:28:38] unadulterated word it is
[1:28:41] and men had gone to seed on their own
[1:28:43] ideas because maybe back then when it
[1:28:44] started they didn't have all the
[1:28:45] messages
[1:28:46] in the table form that we have today to
[1:28:48] search it out and study it and man come
[1:28:49] up with their own quotes and their
[1:28:51] cherry pictures and cherry pick that and
[1:28:52] put it all together and they come with a
[1:28:54] little slanted idea but here's what he's
[1:28:56] saying
[1:28:56] he said don't take the ideas of man
[1:28:58] we've got men today don't believe in the
[1:29:00] prayer line we've got men today they
[1:29:01] don't believe in an altar call we got
[1:29:02] men and they don't believe in the
[1:29:03] movement of the spirit we got men today
[1:29:05] they they just they go they stay they
[1:29:07] they anchor down on formalism
[1:29:10] and don't think you got to move as i
[1:29:11] said the other day you got song leaders
[1:29:13] today they sing two songs in the
[1:29:14] beginning of the preaching two songs at
[1:29:16] the end
[1:29:16] and they shut the complete experience of
[1:29:18] god down
[1:29:21] why do we do that because it's man's
[1:29:24] idea
[1:29:25] we don't want man's idea god has loosed
[1:29:27] us from man's idea
[1:29:29] god's freed us from man's idea what i
[1:29:32] want i want a pentecostal idea
[1:29:34] and i'm not talking about azusa street
[1:29:36] i'm talking about the first pentecost
[1:29:37] i'm talking about an upper room where we
[1:29:39] stagger out of here like drunk men
[1:29:40] and they begin to wonder oh what's going
[1:29:42] on with these look at them they're
[1:29:43] staggering out even like tabernacle
[1:29:45] they're off in the highways they're all
[1:29:46] drunk sagging out like a bunch of drunk
[1:29:48] men
[1:29:48] well but there's got to be a spokesman
[1:29:49] step up and say you know what you know
[1:29:51] what this
[1:29:52] is this is that this is what joel
[1:29:54] prophesied about this is what he said
[1:29:56] i'll pour out my spirit
[1:29:57] in the last days it goes beyond the
[1:29:59] mentality of man
[1:30:00] it goes beyond the traditions of man it
[1:30:02] goes beyond their thinking
[1:30:03] if what because it's freedom when god
[1:30:06] sees forth the holy ghost
[1:30:07] he sees a chain breaker in the myth he
[1:30:09] said i'm gonna do it i don't care what
[1:30:10] man says about it i'm gonna throw out my
[1:30:13] spirit i'm gonna feel young people
[1:30:15] i'm gonna feel young men i'm gonna feel
[1:30:17] young women i'm gonna fill them with my
[1:30:18] power
[1:30:19] my presence and they may act completely
[1:30:21] insane but it doesn't matter because
[1:30:23] this is that
[1:30:25] oh tell you what you can keep that if
[1:30:28] you ain't got this
[1:30:29] because you can't take me to something
[1:30:30] better
[1:30:32] i'll keep this until that comes
[1:30:37] well brother joe you look foolish i
[1:30:38] don't care
[1:30:41] i've looked stupider in my days
[1:30:44] you ain't gotta agree with me brother
[1:30:46] tony
[1:30:48] oh i looked man but when i was out in
[1:30:49] the world serving the devil under sin
[1:30:52] i did stupid stuff stuff i'm not proud
[1:30:55] of
[1:30:55] that's right but this is that
[1:31:01] that's why i could preach sometimes i
[1:31:03] may preach and it may be all over the
[1:31:04] place
[1:31:05] but i'll tell you if you understood the
[1:31:07] joy that i have and knowing where i've
[1:31:08] been
[1:31:09] and where i'm headed and what he's done
[1:31:11] for me those chains of sin
[1:31:13] those chains of alcohol those chains of
[1:31:16] just that
[1:31:17] that that unrighteous life is gone and
[1:31:19] let me tell you i've never woke up since
[1:31:20] the day i gave my heart to the lord
[1:31:22] and wished that i could go back
[1:31:25] because this is that you can let the
[1:31:28] naysayers say what they want
[1:31:30] this is that the problem is they're tied
[1:31:32] up
[1:31:33] problem is some of them been loose we've
[1:31:35] been having all these meetings the good
[1:31:37] man's coming by and then loosen them and
[1:31:38] loosen them in time but they keep going
[1:31:40] around in a circle because why it's a
[1:31:41] tradition
[1:31:43] oh johnny crow walked around and around
[1:31:45] and around and around and sometimes
[1:31:47] that's our problem
[1:31:48] some of you can't come to the alt summit
[1:31:49] you can't offer up praise and worship of
[1:31:52] god because i understand you may have
[1:31:53] gone around and around and it seems like
[1:31:55] the devil's constantly buffing to you
[1:31:57] and buffing you but i'm here to tell you
[1:31:58] this morning he's already loosed you
[1:32:00] and it's a perfect loose thing it's a
[1:32:02] perfect blood it's that bloody
[1:32:04] shoe this morning ain't no devil can
[1:32:06] take you back and tie you back to that
[1:32:08] post
[1:32:08] because why you've experienced your
[1:32:10] freedom you found your freedom in jesus
[1:32:12] christ
[1:32:13] you found your freedom in this world you
[1:32:15] found your freedom in this message
[1:32:17] this message was sent to liberate sons
[1:32:19] and daughters of god
[1:32:22] they want to say when they left this
[1:32:23] message they found liberty no you didn't
[1:32:26] no you didn't you went back to bondage
[1:32:30] oh let me tell you i know what i'm
[1:32:31] talking about i came out of the world
[1:32:32] went to a baptist church
[1:32:34] went from a baptist church to a
[1:32:35] methodist church from a methodist church
[1:32:36] to assembly church
[1:32:37] i never found what i got today
[1:32:42] oh i can tell you they ain't free
[1:32:47] they're not free because the bible says
[1:32:49] he that the son is made free
[1:32:51] is free what is this message it's a
[1:32:54] message from the son
[1:32:57] declaring you free
[1:33:00] see redemption means that the devil put
[1:33:02] you in a pawnshop
[1:33:04] but jesus come to take you out that old
[1:33:07] crowd had been tired so long till he
[1:33:08] still thought that he was tired
[1:33:10] he didn't know that somebody had
[1:33:11] redeemed him
[1:33:14] i wonder about some of us tonight or
[1:33:16] this morning
[1:33:17] brother man i said that's moving a lot
[1:33:19] of people tonight friends you've been in
[1:33:21] sin so long serving the enemy
[1:33:23] until you think you're still tired and
[1:33:24] you're really loose he goes oh
[1:33:27] let's go to calvary tonight let's get
[1:33:30] out of the things of the world oh my
[1:33:31] he's wonderful
[1:33:34] know that we're free and who that the
[1:33:36] son is made free
[1:33:38] is free indeed see we find in john 8 and
[1:33:40] verse 33
[1:33:41] or verse 32 jesus tells me says now and
[1:33:44] you shall know the truth
[1:33:46] and the truth shall make you free
[1:33:50] and you shall know the truth and the
[1:33:52] truth shall make you free
[1:33:54] and notice their response and they
[1:33:57] answered we be abraham's seed and we're
[1:33:59] never
[1:33:59] in bondage to any man how saith thou
[1:34:03] you shall be made free see they were in
[1:34:06] bondage but they didn't realize they
[1:34:07] were held bondage
[1:34:09] harriet tubman we all know who she is
[1:34:11] the underground railroad
[1:34:12] harriet tubman made a statement she goes
[1:34:14] i freedom a lot of slaves
[1:34:16] and i would have freed them many more if
[1:34:18] they only recognized they were slaves
[1:34:22] i sleep ah i liberated i freed
[1:34:25] a lot of slaves and i would have freed a
[1:34:28] lot more
[1:34:29] if they had only recognized that they
[1:34:30] were slaves
[1:34:33] so we find people today they can't be
[1:34:34] freed
[1:34:36] because they don't realize they're
[1:34:37] slaves they're okay with just coming to
[1:34:39] church
[1:34:40] they're okay with just a halfway
[1:34:41] christian life they're okay with just
[1:34:43] you know just going through the motions
[1:34:45] church has got to be more than going
[1:34:46] through the motions
[1:34:48] when he's come during emancipation a
[1:34:51] proclamation what was that a declaration
[1:34:53] that all slaves could be free
[1:34:54] some slaves were freed and they thrived
[1:34:57] other slaves
[1:34:58] needed a master
[1:35:02] see slave mentality is in the mind
[1:35:06] while others like johnny crow never come
[1:35:08] to the realization that the change of
[1:35:10] darkness has broken off their life
[1:35:12] and they go around and around and around
[1:35:15] and around and though they're free they
[1:35:17] were servants to the post
[1:35:20] they never come to realize the joy and
[1:35:22] the promises of serving god
[1:35:24] they never experienced a life of victory
[1:35:26] to worship without condemnation
[1:35:29] they never experience coming into church
[1:35:32] and can offer true praise
[1:35:33] without a guilty conscience it's no
[1:35:36] different than a man who's married to a
[1:35:37] woman but he cheats on her
[1:35:39] and commits adultery he can never give
[1:35:41] his spouse
[1:35:43] true intimate relationship because his
[1:35:45] conscience condemns him
[1:35:48] and sometimes that's what we bring into
[1:35:49] the house of god a guilty conscience
[1:35:52] but i want you to know you've been
[1:35:55] liberated
[1:35:56] you've been set free let's do away with
[1:36:00] slave mentality
[1:36:02] you'll find people they carry baggage
[1:36:03] after baggage after baggage and they
[1:36:05] just keep coming and they keep coming
[1:36:06] and
[1:36:07] you know and it gets heavier and heavier
[1:36:08] as the years pass
[1:36:11] and whether you know it or not you
[1:36:12] become a slave to that baggage
[1:36:14] some of us it's negativity some of us is
[1:36:16] complex and some of us is nervous some
[1:36:18] of this
[1:36:18] depression fear anxieties all these
[1:36:20] other things and we become a slave to
[1:36:22] those things
[1:36:24] and we always ask god why me god
[1:36:27] when you ask why me that's slave
[1:36:29] mentality
[1:36:31] why me why me
[1:36:35] you know god doesn't make one mistake
[1:36:40] so that tells me we should never ask him
[1:36:42] why me
[1:36:43] god chose you he saw something in you
[1:36:45] that you didn't see in yourself
[1:36:47] and he knew there's something that can
[1:36:48] rise above the situation that you're
[1:36:50] facing but we find we have all these
[1:36:53] things and
[1:36:54] and they weight us down year after year
[1:36:55] and we think well this is just normal i
[1:36:57] have to live with this
[1:36:58] church is anything but normal
[1:37:02] when jesus died on the cross he paid for
[1:37:04] everything all your redemptive blessings
[1:37:07] don't bring in depression in the house
[1:37:08] of god and take it home with you and
[1:37:10] live with it and cater to it and
[1:37:11] and pamper it and all this stuff and say
[1:37:13] well it's just who i am as part of my
[1:37:14] makeup no it ain't
[1:37:16] that's what the devil wants you to know
[1:37:18] he's trying to put you back in a pawn
[1:37:19] shop but you've been free sons and
[1:37:20] daughters of god
[1:37:22] it's anything but normal it may be
[1:37:24] common but it's not normal
[1:37:26] see they didn't recognize here that they
[1:37:27] were in bondage
[1:37:29] and until you recognize that you're in
[1:37:31] bondage you can never be
[1:37:32] set free they saw themselves as god's
[1:37:36] chosen people not slaves to sin not
[1:37:38] slaves
[1:37:38] all these different things but yet at
[1:37:41] the same time
[1:37:43] they were held bondage they wanted to
[1:37:45] worship god when the spirit passed by
[1:37:47] they just clamped down because there was
[1:37:48] something
[1:37:49] that they couldn't be intimate with god
[1:37:50] for
[1:37:52] and so they they just wouldn't worship
[1:37:54] they wouldn't praise god
[1:37:56] and so we find church that it's like an
[1:37:58] eagle brother man talked about the eagle
[1:37:59] in the cage
[1:38:01] he said this bird was destined for the
[1:38:02] heavenly skies and he was he was meant
[1:38:04] to soar in the heavenlies but now he's
[1:38:06] in a cage and he's beating his head
[1:38:07] his brain's out trying to get loose
[1:38:10] and he said if i could just raise enough
[1:38:12] money i'd pay the price to get that
[1:38:14] eagle out of that cage and he said i
[1:38:15] thought of a more pitiful sight than
[1:38:16] that and that's a man who's caved with
[1:38:18] sin
[1:38:21] i watched a man caged in sin alcohol
[1:38:26] drive him to an early grave there was an
[1:38:29] eagle behind that destined to get out
[1:38:33] and there was a way that was already
[1:38:35] made there was a price that's already
[1:38:37] been paid
[1:38:38] but you got to recognize where you are
[1:38:41] if you ever plan on climbing out of that
[1:38:43] jail cell you got to recognize
[1:38:46] that you're an eagle johnny crow would
[1:38:48] cry out i'm still tired i'm still tired
[1:38:51] he wanted to worship he says i can't
[1:38:53] worship i'm tired
[1:38:54] i can't overcome i'm tired i can't be
[1:38:56] healed i'm tired i can't receive the
[1:38:57] holy ghost i'm tired i can't praise god
[1:38:59] i'm tithed
[1:39:00] i can't surrender my all i'm tithed see
[1:39:02] but we've been freed from our past
[1:39:04] but he didn't recognize it we've been
[1:39:06] free from man's idea but he didn't
[1:39:08] recognize we've been free from
[1:39:09] denominational cages but he didn't
[1:39:11] recognize we've been free from formalism
[1:39:13] but he didn't recognize it but one step
[1:39:15] past that chain
[1:39:17] one step past that chain is all you need
[1:39:20] to do to this morning
[1:39:21] to recognize your freedom
[1:39:25] one step past that depression so you
[1:39:27] can't hold me anymore
[1:39:29] you're free this morning but obama say
[1:39:31] that's the way it is with men and women
[1:39:33] tonight
[1:39:33] who don't know their position and christ
[1:39:35] the devil may have tied you with tb may
[1:39:37] have tied you with cancer may have tied
[1:39:38] you with many things
[1:39:39] but christ a good man has stood your
[1:39:41] judgment now has set you free
[1:39:45] you know in the in the days of slavery
[1:39:49] the days of slavery the
[1:39:53] the slaves were bound and we find that
[1:39:56] this is back in the days early days not
[1:39:59] back in the early 1800s or anything of
[1:40:01] that nature this is going back to egypt
[1:40:04] we found there was a law that there was
[1:40:05] a jubilee year
[1:40:07] and no matter what they've done they
[1:40:08] sold their children to slavery
[1:40:10] and the sound of that jubilee trump they
[1:40:12] could be made free
[1:40:15] and we find though that many times
[1:40:19] they knew that that day was going to
[1:40:20] come maybe it was the next morning and
[1:40:22] they knew the jubilee was going to be
[1:40:24] just around the corner and we'd find
[1:40:25] here that
[1:40:26] the slaves would begin to climb to the
[1:40:27] top of the mountain you know it was a
[1:40:29] struggle some of them had to climb
[1:40:31] and some could climb further than others
[1:40:34] some could a little bit more stamina
[1:40:35] they could come a little bit higher than
[1:40:36] others and
[1:40:37] we find that they would climb up to the
[1:40:38] top of that mouth and when they see the
[1:40:40] sun rose
[1:40:41] they knew then that they were free and
[1:40:44] they'd begin to cry back down and back
[1:40:45] down you're free
[1:40:46] you're free you're free you're free
[1:40:50] and no matter what they was doing in the
[1:40:52] valley they may have been hoeing for the
[1:40:54] master they may have been beat they may
[1:40:55] have been kicked they may have been done
[1:40:57] this and done that
[1:40:58] what he's telling you this morning
[1:40:59] you're no longer bound you're free this
[1:41:01] morning
[1:41:01] you no longer have to live in sin you
[1:41:03] can go home and be free you don't have
[1:41:04] to owe any debts
[1:41:05] he goes you can drop that cigarette you
[1:41:07] can jump that chew in the back and you
[1:41:08] can drop that whiskey bottle

[1:41:15] quit cutting their hair men can start
[1:41:16] cutting their hair and wear manly
[1:41:18] clothes

[1:41:19] to let society rule you i'm here to tell
[1:41:22] you you're free this morning
[1:41:23] he's already paid the price you may have
[1:41:25] come in here a slave but you can walk
[1:41:27] out free
[1:41:28] you can throw that old hoe down and turn
[1:41:30] around and look at that slave master
[1:41:32] and say you can't touch me again you
[1:41:34] can't take me again
[1:41:35] you can't put this sin on me again you
[1:41:38] can't put your whip on me again
[1:41:40] i'm free this morning i'm a son of god

[1:42:13] the emancipation proclamation is
[1:42:16] sounding out this morning
[1:42:18] this message is your freedom
[1:42:21] this message this message declares that
[1:42:24] whosoever the son is made free
[1:42:26] is free indeed but this man after he had
[1:42:30] offered one sacrifice for sin
[1:42:32] forever he sat down at the right hand
[1:42:34] one sacrifice he said brother joe well i
[1:42:36] got
[1:42:36] i'm not worthy you're right you're not
[1:42:38] worthy but god's not looking at you he's
[1:42:40] looking at your lamb
[1:42:42] brother joe i've done this and i've done
[1:42:43] that i l i didn't live true
[1:42:45] i've been a drunkard i've done all these
[1:42:46] things that's right you may have done
[1:42:48] all that but god ain't looking at you

[1:43:00] morning you don't have to look at
[1:43:01] yourself you look at yourself you see
[1:43:03] your failures
[1:43:04] you see your mistakes you see your scar
[1:43:06] but if you can look to the land this
[1:43:07] morning
[1:43:08] that lamb paid your price that lamb is
[1:43:10] your sacrifice and i'm gonna tell you
[1:43:11] it's a perfect lamb
[1:43:13] it's a sinless slam and that lamb played
[1:43:15] it for you
[1:43:16] and you're free this morning you're free
[1:43:18] to worship a living god
[1:43:19] you're free to experience the joys of
[1:43:21] the lord you're free to get drunk in the
[1:43:23] holy ghost
[1:43:24] you're free to speak in tongues you're
[1:43:26] free to dance
[1:43:28] you're free
[1:43:31] you're free and don't you ever ask to
[1:43:33] underestimate jesus
[1:43:35] and what he will do well he said well he
[1:43:37] don't do that in my church
[1:43:39] that's fine that's your church but in
[1:43:42] this church he's free
[1:43:45] he's free to move however he wishes and
[1:43:48] he's here today to break chains
[1:43:50] off of your life he says now
[1:43:53] god in the beginning when he saw sin he
[1:43:56] saw what had happened
[1:43:58] and he spoke the word and jesus was a
[1:44:00] was a slain
[1:44:01] jesus was slain before the foundation of
[1:44:03] the world and every person was saved was
[1:44:05] saved
[1:44:06] according to the bible when the lamb was
[1:44:08] slain in the mind of god
[1:44:10] before the foundation of the world so
[1:44:13] every person was saved
[1:44:15] before the foundation of the world you
[1:44:17] were there in his mind
[1:44:19] you were there on the cross you were
[1:44:21] there in hell
[1:44:22] you were there when he rose again oh
[1:44:25] church
[1:44:27] so he that the s he that the son is made
[1:44:30] free
[1:44:32] is free indeed and when god slayed the
[1:44:35] sun before the foundation of the world
[1:44:37] he was just as much slain then as he was
[1:44:40] at calvary
[1:44:41] it's a finished product when god said so
[1:44:44] see it's god's that's called us it's god
[1:44:46] that chose us in christ
[1:44:50] it's all god nothing that we had to do
[1:44:53] with the church didn't call you
[1:44:57] man didn't call you god called you
[1:45:01] god began to move on your heart god
[1:45:02] began to deal with that life
[1:45:04] some of you were here this morning not
[1:45:06] because man called you god called you
[1:45:08] god placed that burden in your heart to
[1:45:10] come and say what is it all about
[1:45:13] what is it what's going on in even light
[1:45:17] what's happening down there god's
[1:45:20] calling
[1:45:23] and romans 8 1 says therefore there is
[1:45:25] now no condemnation
[1:45:27] no demolitory sentence to them that are
[1:45:30] in christ jesus who walked knock out
[1:45:32] through the flesh but after the spirit
[1:45:33] of god
[1:45:34] for the law the spirit of life in christ
[1:45:36] jesus has made us free
[1:45:37] from the law of sin and death for what
[1:45:39] the law could not do and that it was
[1:45:41] weak through the flesh
[1:45:42] god sending his own son in the likeness
[1:45:44] of sinful flesh
[1:45:45] and for sin he condemned sin in the
[1:45:47] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[1:45:49] might be fulfilled in us
[1:45:50] who walk not out to the flesh but after
[1:45:53] the spirit
[1:45:54] see when man sinned there was a chasm
[1:45:57] that separated
[1:45:58] man and god there was no way to bridge
[1:46:01] that chasm
[1:46:05] there was no way to get back god
[1:46:06] accepted a substitute but that
[1:46:08] substitute can never bring man back
[1:46:10] fully in the presence of god
[1:46:12] but when god sent his predestinated lamb
[1:46:14] jesus christ
[1:46:16] it not only breached the chasm but it
[1:46:18] completely took the chasm away
[1:46:20] and the prophet of god would say and now
[1:46:22] there's not even a chasm there
[1:46:23] man and god become father and son again
[1:46:26] oh church if you recognize where we were
[1:46:29] and what god had done for us
[1:46:31] he said that don't even cover he said
[1:46:33] you talk about the blood of bulls and
[1:46:34] goats it only covers sin but
[1:46:36] see we're talking about a blood that can
[1:46:38] not only cover sin but it annihilates
[1:46:40] sin
[1:46:41] not only bridges the chasm but it takes
[1:46:42] the chasm away and we find that
[1:46:45] in micah 7 and verse 18 the bible will
[1:46:47] tell us who is god
[1:46:49] or who is like unto thee that pardon
[1:46:51] iniquity and passes by
[1:46:53] the transgression of the remnant of his
[1:46:55] heritage he retained it not his anger
[1:46:57] forever because
[1:46:58] he delighteth in mercy here it again
[1:47:00] he's a god who's rich in mercy
[1:47:02] in verse 19 he will turn again he will
[1:47:04] have compassion upon us
[1:47:06] he will subdue our iniquities and thou
[1:47:08] will cast
[1:47:09] all their sins into the depths of the
[1:47:11] sea one thing about god
[1:47:13] god is infinite we are fine like we can
[1:47:15] forgive but we never will forget but god
[1:47:18] is so big that not only does he forgive
[1:47:20] he forgets about it he throws it over
[1:47:22] and to see is his forgiveness he don't
[1:47:24] even have one memory
[1:47:25] one trace of your sin if you'll just put
[1:47:28] it in the blood and there's a power in
[1:47:29] that blood
[1:47:30] it's a power dissociation and when that
[1:47:32] sin drops into that blood
[1:47:34] it dissociates it and it goes back on
[1:47:36] the head of the enemy
[1:47:37] until the time of judgment i'm gonna
[1:47:38] tell you this morning you're free this
[1:47:40] morning
[1:47:41] the blood of jesus has disassociated you
[1:47:44] in your past
[1:47:45] that chasm has been bridged you're no
[1:47:47] longer held by sins change
[1:47:49] and unbelief you're sons and daughters
[1:47:51] of god
[1:47:55] we can forgive but we never forget
[1:47:59] he can forgive and he never remembers
[1:48:05] mercy he never remembers
[1:48:09] brother johnny that passed
[1:48:12] he has no memory of it for the tony
[1:48:16] that pass no remembrance
[1:48:20] for the jeremy that passed
[1:48:23] what are you talking about he don't know
[1:48:27] so why don't we keep bringing it up
[1:48:30] we're free i found my freedom

[1:51:18] and today church we did not become
[1:51:22] seed because we could be reborn
[1:51:26] but we could be reborn because we were
[1:51:28] always seed
[1:51:30] brother william
[1:51:34] you didn't become seed because you were
[1:51:35] reborn but god before the foundation of
[1:51:38] the world
[1:51:39] placed a seed on the inside of you and
[1:51:41] at a certain time a certain age a
[1:51:43] certain service
[1:51:44] in the right atmosphere the spirit of
[1:51:47] god stroked that seed and because there
[1:51:50] was a seed there
[1:51:51] rebirth could take place oh church what
[1:51:54] does that rebirth that's your freedom
[1:51:57] that's where the chains of the world
[1:51:58] begin to fall off when you recognize
[1:52:00] i'm a seat of god and some of you this
[1:52:03] morning you got
[1:52:04] children out in the world and let me
[1:52:07] tell you it looks hopeless for some of
[1:52:09] them
[1:52:10] it looks
[1:52:16] like there's no hope it's useless we
[1:52:18] might as well give up but the prophet of
[1:52:20] god said a son of god can go a long time
[1:52:22] before he ever recognizes
[1:52:24] he's the son of god and brother e.j i
[1:52:27] know you're streaming with your father
[1:52:29] a son of god can go a long time before
[1:52:31] he ever recognizes he's the son of god
[1:52:33] you know that sun may resist that sun
[1:52:36] may be hardened
[1:52:37] that sun may just he may push back and
[1:52:39] push back and push back but eventually
[1:52:41] the light of that word is going to
[1:52:43] strike that seed
[1:52:44] okay see some of us were cultivated in
[1:52:46] good ground some of us
[1:52:48] are under concrete but if there's a seed
[1:52:50] in there that
[1:52:51] seed is going to come to life he that
[1:52:54] the sun is made free
[1:52:56] will be free there ain't enough devils
[1:52:59] in hell
[1:53:00] to keep that child that son of god down
[1:53:03] let me tell you we've heard it and we've
[1:53:04] heard and we've heard it but the devil
[1:53:06] don't have enough
[1:53:06] he doesn't have enough some of you that
[1:53:09] got kids out there in the world you need
[1:53:10] to be claiming
[1:53:11] every morning call their name before god
[1:53:12] in prayer god you said it ain't enough
[1:53:14] devils in hell can keep my daughter down
[1:53:16] keep my son down keep my husband down
[1:53:18] keep my wife down there ain't enough
[1:53:20] devils in hell can keep me down
[1:53:23] not when we've been free notice redeem
[1:53:26] means to buy back it's restored back to
[1:53:27] the original
[1:53:28] god by his death shed blood brought back
[1:53:31] his own
[1:53:32] he says my sheep hear my word and they
[1:53:34] will follow me
[1:53:36] you always was a sheep that's right
[1:53:40] for the hell you never was a pig
[1:53:43] you never was a dog just a felicia you
[1:53:46] always
[1:53:47] was a sheep
[1:53:51] think about that
[1:53:54] well i'm in my 50s i'm in my 40s we just
[1:53:58] come to the message three years ago you
[1:54:00] may have just came three or four years
[1:54:01] ago
[1:54:02] but she always was sheep you always was
[1:54:05] seed
[1:54:06] see a son of god can go a long time but
[1:54:09] if there's a seed that was deposited
[1:54:11] before the foundation of the world there
[1:54:12] ain't enough devils in hell can cover it
[1:54:15] up
[1:54:15] can stop it from coming to life it's
[1:54:17] gonna find its way to come to the word
[1:54:20] and when it comes to the word and when
[1:54:21] the word comes to the word what happens
[1:54:23] it brings forth freedom it brings forth
[1:54:26] life it brings forth jubilee
[1:54:28] it brings forth emotion it brings forth
[1:54:30] praise it brings forth adoration
[1:54:32] it brings forth victory i'm here to tell
[1:54:34] you this morning it brings this focus as
[1:54:36] well it ain't the work of a man
[1:54:38] it's the work of almighty god only god
[1:54:40] can put that together
[1:54:41] only god can put that together only god
[1:54:44] can bring this substance
[1:54:45] into that and bring it to this son and
[1:54:47] create life
[1:54:48] only god can do that
[1:54:52] only god can call a man from his depths
[1:54:54] of sin and despair
[1:54:56] and place him and make him a real son of
[1:54:57] god
[1:55:01] don't try to impersonate it he said
[1:55:04] that's what the matter with pentecost
[1:55:05] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:55:07] today too many trying to impersonate
[1:55:09] that they got the holy ghost too many
[1:55:11] trying to impersonate divine healing
[1:55:15] i'm sorry but the days of impersonation
[1:55:17] are gone
[1:55:18] now we're criticized for the movement of
[1:55:21] the spirit
[1:55:22] now we're criticized for praying out
[1:55:24] loud
[1:55:26] now we're criticized for altar calls now
[1:55:28] we're criticized
[1:55:29] for young people getting victory
[1:55:33] we're criticized you're not criticizing
[1:55:36] us
[1:55:37] you're criticizing him
[1:55:42] you're blaspheming the holy spirit
[1:55:45] for what he does in a life
[1:55:48] if you'd have been miriam and look back
[1:55:51] over your taskmasters

[1:56:00] maybe you came with fear and it had you
[1:56:01] bound and you were scared to go do this

[1:56:05] complexes he thought everybody was
[1:56:07] against you nobody loved you nobody
[1:56:08] cared for you but one day when you cross
