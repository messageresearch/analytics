[27:10] these words to speak to the hearts are
[27:12] you people or does someone can gain
[27:15] strength father that Lord healing can

[27:26] you to appreciate you Lord you're so
[27:29] good to us or do so wonderful tools or
[27:32] they don't tell you that enough I know
[27:34] is how much Lord you mean to us such a
[27:38] good God such a good God and we're so
[27:41] thankful Lord that you're not just a god
[27:44] but your father or through our
[27:47] relationship we belong to you

[27:53] Father for these things we just bless
[27:55] your name tonight we praise you with all
[27:58] that was with it as lord thank you for
[28:00] bringing sister Karen home from the
[28:03] hospital Lord and being merciful during
[28:06] this time father or we're just looking
[28:08] for complete restoration once again Lord
[28:12] we thank you for these things in Jesus
[28:14] name
[28:18] was turning up our Bibles if you would
[28:22] to Habakkuk to Habakkuk 2 and verse 2
[28:31] hey man it's good to be in the house of
[28:34] the Lord and to speak to you tonight
[28:36] just pray these things can be a blessing
[28:39] as we was getting ready for Sunday
[28:41] amen these things were a heart but the
[28:44] Lord knows the timing of everything and
[28:46] so amen were just resting in that
[28:49] Habakkuk 2 and verse 2 and the Lord
[28:52] answered me and said write the vision
[28:54] and make it plain upon tables that he
[28:58] may run that readeth it for the vision
[29:02] is yet for an appointed time but at the
[29:05] end it shall speak and not lie though it
[29:10] Terry wait for it because it will surely
[29:13] come it will not tarry Amen we'll let
[29:17] you be seated this eden-like to speak to
[29:21] you on the vision is yet for an
[29:24] appointed time the vision is yet for an
[29:27] appointed time we know the Word of God
[29:31] will be fulfilled in his time and his
[29:35] season and it has an appointed time it's
[29:38] a it's not time as what we would think
[29:40] of is maybe days or years or months
[29:44] because God's Word is not depending
[29:47] necessarily on time or it is not is not
[29:49] needful of time it's an eternal thing
[29:52] and so you know many times we put a time
[29:56] or a time limit on what God says or how
[29:59] what we think or how he thinks God is
[30:01] going to bring things to pass but it's
[30:03] not our words is not or our thinking is
[30:06] not what we have or what we're trying to
[30:08] do is God's Word and the vision we're
[30:11] speaking of is not our vision for or
[30:14] what we would like to happen or how we
[30:16] would like it to happen or what time we
[30:19] would like it to happen you know we can
[30:21] have a thought and we can bring it into
[30:23] fulfillment but our thoughts can change
[30:25] and we can make that the fulfillment
[30:28] different than the original thought but
[30:31] not God
[30:32] what he sees or what he says or what he
[30:34] thinks he brings to pass exactly how he
[30:37] said he would do it and when you know
[30:40] when we have thought or hey you know
[30:42] have a thought it may take years to
[30:43] bring it to pass or months or days or
[30:46] there may be something that rises up and
[30:48] stops it but not God amen because what
[30:51] he says he will bring to pass and so
[30:55] time has no bearing on it nothing can
[30:57] stop him
[30:58] remember the Brennan would say it like
[30:59] this he said when a vision speaks for
[31:01] when a vision is ready for fulfillment
[31:04] he said all Devils in hell and all his
[31:08] forces cannot stop it amen it will come
[31:11] to pass the time is there the spoken
[31:14] word of God is ready to come to pass and
[31:16] nothing can stop it so and but when you
[31:20] know when God pronounces a blessing upon
[31:22] somebody or a blessing upon something it
[31:26] don't have to happen just in the spur of
[31:28] the moment you know as I said I had this
[31:31] ready for Sunday brother Tim mentioned
[31:33] this very very thought here are this
[31:35] very story here in his sermon Sunday but
[31:38] talking about those two ladies that came
[31:40] to the prayer line and one came for a
[31:43] Gorder and one had a stomach trouble and
[31:45] and the vision spoke to them and told
[31:47] him who they were and what they were
[31:49] going through and and told him exactly
[31:51] what had taken place and then it spoke
[31:54] and said thus saith the Lord you're
[31:57] healed
[31:57] now the healing didn't take place right
[32:00] it at thethe event right at that time or
[32:02] how that person may have wanted it or
[32:05] thought it or expected it to take place
[32:07] but if the word had spoken and there was
[32:10] nothing that could stop it from coming
[32:11] to pass and no doubt doubt tried to
[32:14] garrison and fear try to come or or the
[32:17] next symptom when it arose if he in the
[32:19] following days or weeks that it would
[32:21] get worse and and seemingly nothing was
[32:24] taking place but the Word of God had
[32:26] spoke and there wasn't a snuff symptoms
[32:29] it wasn't enough demons there wasn't
[32:31] enough power to hold that word from
[32:33] coming to pass and so you know as they
[32:37] would go home we know the story and I
[32:38] recounted again other woman
[32:41] had the growth and the woman who had the
[32:43] stomach issue you know she's been one of
[32:45] them when she went away she said well if
[32:47] the man was able to tell me all about me
[32:50] and what I was going through it and how
[32:53] it would be I believe it will be that
[32:55] way and so she went away believing and
[32:58] maybe it was five or six weeks later
[33:00] amen they come to a meeting and here was
[33:02] their testimony that that woman with the
[33:04] stomach trouble and she couldn't eat at
[33:07] all she would vomit up everything that
[33:09] she would heat him and every time she
[33:11] would confess I'm healed I'm healed and
[33:13] and the neighbors begin to rise up and
[33:16] say well you know you need to quit
[33:17] saying all that because you're bringing
[33:19] a reproach on the name of our Lord Jesus
[33:21] he's better be careful he said she said
[33:24] but look I have that tape and it was not
[33:27] him that said that part it was the Lord
[33:31] that called it out it was the Lord that
[33:33] Senate so she kept with it week's
[33:35] passing time past to mourn go but one
[33:38] morning the children went to school and
[33:40] and her husband went to work and she was
[33:42] washing the dishes and here she was
[33:44] standing there all of it wants a real
[33:47] cool feeling went over her she thought
[33:50] she never thought nothing about it but
[33:52] in a few moments she got real hungry and
[33:54] she picked up some toast and ate it she
[33:56] ate some other things that were left
[33:57] over some eggs that was their bowl of
[34:00] oats who was there and just having a
[34:02] jubilee and she got her big cup of
[34:04] coffee in and just really went to town
[34:07] having a good time with it and she
[34:09] waited a little while nothing happened
[34:11] and she said mom I'm feeling so good I
[34:13] need to go testify to my neighbor and
[34:15] she runs down there and the neighbors
[34:17] shout and she'd got up that morning was
[34:19] combing her hair and realized that not
[34:22] her throat was gone just vanished and
[34:24] she was shaking out the sheets trying to
[34:27] find it and they both begin to rejoice
[34:29] what was it the presence of the
[34:31] supernatural had come to visit them and
[34:35] nothing could hold it back he met here
[34:38] he had come the healing angel walking
[34:41] through the neighborhood and I believe
[34:43] he's still the healing angel tonight I I
[34:45] believe he's still watching over his
[34:47] word and fulfilling his word
[34:49] and it may seem like nothing has
[34:51] happened it may seem like things are
[34:53] going in the wrong directions and and
[34:55] way you know Church is going in the
[34:56] wrong direction what we thought was
[34:57] going in the wrong direction what were
[34:59] you figured how we figured was going the
[35:01] wrong way but it might be those very
[35:04] moments that we're in our homes and
[35:05] we're having the things and all of a
[35:07] sudden the feeling just sweep over us
[35:09] amen something takes place and and we
[35:12] haven't before we realize it we've had a
[35:15] visitation of an angel I believe that
[35:18] God is still visiting his people I
[35:20] believe God is still fulfilling his word
[35:23] amen circumstances doesn't change it
[35:25] symptoms doesn't change the diseases
[35:27] doesn't change it nothing can stop the
[35:30] fulfillment of God's Word amen amen I
[35:33] believe it's going to be like that one
[35:34] of these morning when things are going
[35:36] on the husband's went to work the
[35:38] children are on just normal days is
[35:40] going all normal things are happening
[35:42] normal things are taking place in a
[35:44] normal life on there but just another
[35:46] day but all of a sudden something that
[35:49] begin to change and we look over there
[35:51] and there's not old grandpa there's
[35:53] young grandpa there's not old daddy
[35:55] there's young daddy it's not an old sick
[35:57] for a woman that put up putting the
[35:59] grave or young person they got putting
[36:01] the gray but it's a new body sitting
[36:04] there and will be changed and you
[36:05] couldn't put enough Devils to line it up
[36:08] to keep it from happening it's going to
[36:10] take place and I'm going to be there
[36:13] holding the line believing for their

[43:48] walk off here rejoicing well hallelujah
[43:52] Amen it's time we turned our faith to
[43:55] the things of God's Word and we begin to
[43:57] believe it as if it's already happened
[43:59] just like blaming just like Abraham did
[44:02] he hoped against hope people leave
[44:04] things that were not as though they were
[44:07] because God said so God said you're
[44:11] gonna have a son so he bruh have turned
[44:13] from his thoughts and his thinking as
[44:14] impossibilities and from his vision and
[44:17] how he thought he's going to bring it to
[44:19] pass and turn it to God and say God is
[44:21] beyond my control it's beyond what I can
[44:24] do
[44:24] it's beyond what I can think of what I
[44:27] can comprehend I'm placing that in your
[44:30] hands and God brought it to pass
[44:35] hallelujah I remember he meant with
[44:37] hand-drew my son Andrew when he was born
[44:40] he meant fighting for his life standing
[44:43] there watching the doctor had it
[44:45] delivered him actually was the
[44:46] pediatrician had come in there and it
[44:49] was fighting for his life there in
[44:50] Minden for they shipped him to
[44:51] Shreveport and he's trying to get oxygen
[44:54] to him and I was looking at him turning
[44:55] blue and purple everything else and just
[44:58] crying out to God asking God to move on
[45:00] the scene Amen in my vision wasn't very
[45:03] good right there and the devil had come
[45:05] in and told me hey he began to speak to
[45:08] me and said you know you must have done
[45:09] something really bad for you to be going
[45:11] through this you must have really really
[45:13] done something gods I'm angry at she's
[45:14] mad at you that's why you're going
[45:16] through they say all these thoughts
[45:17] running through my mind and that was
[45:19] what my look my thoughts were going as I
[45:21] was looking at I'm thinking God amen
[45:24] forgive me if I've done something but
[45:26] moved on don't let an innocent baby
[45:27] suffer because of what I done but I
[45:30] beginning to realize is I found out
[45:32] later as I would turn on a
[45:34] oh station going down the road as I
[45:36] would go to Walmart to pick up a few
[45:38] things and there was a preacher that was
[45:40] reading the scripture and all I heard
[45:41] was abraham believed in God and it just
[45:45] went through me like a like I've been
[45:47] hit upside the head with a gong or
[45:49] something there's woo woo woo abraham
[45:51] believed in god i said that's exactly
[45:53] right and he's my father and if abraham
[45:57] believed you I can believe you
[45:59] and Abraham planted false and I got
[46:02] false words you still brought forth your
[46:03] promise and then all of a sudden it hit
[46:05] me again Amen I said the Scriptures
[46:08] begin to come to my mind and as God
[46:10] began to speak to me so what you need to
[46:12] look he's under you're under the New
[46:14] Covenant and I looked and I began to
[46:17] look in the Old Covenant under blood of
[46:19] bulls and goats Abraham's folks were
[46:21] listed but under the New Covenant there
[46:24] ain't a fault listed no hallelujah Amen
[46:28] I said and the same covenant applies to
[46:31] me and my vision begin to change I begin
[46:34] to realize I wasn't under this we're
[46:36] going through this because of punishment
[46:38] I was going through this because God was
[46:41] wanting to move on the scene for my
[46:42] behalf and to give me a testimony then I
[46:46] could have my own personal experience
[46:49] with God and God can fight my battle oh
[46:53] it's good to tell somebody about God
[46:55] fighting somebody else's battle I've
[46:57] enjoyed telling sister Linda's testimony
[46:59] it's a wonderful testimony remember
[47:01] there's nothing like seeing God worked
[47:04] for you God come and change your vision
[47:09] or what you're looking at or how you're
[47:11] looking at something and begin to turn
[47:13] you back to something that's eternal by
[47:16] His stripes Andrews healed and God came
[47:21] on the scene and it changed the whole
[47:23] situation around to a healthy young man
[47:26] today a man and this is where well the
[47:29] Brennan was walking up to this boy in
[47:31] Finland and he said but when a vision
[47:35] speaks the situation is already under
[47:39] control that's some powerful words right
[47:43] there and what we need to realize
[47:47] it says brother Tim talked about stories
[47:50] and things being Abraham's story or this
[47:52] story that's good if along a great-great
[47:54] great-great-grandfather but what about
[47:56] us is we have been spoken a vision by
[48:02] His stripes were healed I want to tell
[48:08] somebody tonight the situation is
[48:10] already under control God said so that
[48:16] is not my words that wasn't Isaiah word
[48:19] that wasn't a man's words that was God's
[48:22] words and the situation is already under
[48:27] control no glory he already knows about
[48:31] it before you got there before cancer
[48:34] came he already had the answer he
[48:36] already knew about it he saw it before
[48:39] it ever got there or sugar diabetes or
[48:41] high blood pressure or whatever you're
[48:43] going through tonight he already saw it
[48:46] before he got there and the situation is
[48:50] already under control because there's a
[48:53] word that's already has been spoke over
[48:55] you Oh hallelujah and this word was
[48:58] spoke before cancer was before any kind
[49:02] of disease was or any kind of depression
[49:04] or anxiety there is another word and in
[49:08] a man's word that'll fall to the ground
[49:10] and not be fulfilled but it's God's word
[49:13] that has to come to pass hallelujah
[49:17] it cannot fall to the ground this
[49:20] testimony was vision was seeing some
[49:22] several years before of the lapping
[49:25] rocks and the heels of the little boy
[49:27] that is going to be raised from the dead
[49:28] and it gets to it employee realized that
[49:31] he's walking in a vision oh my god many
[49:36] times today you are at the all day today
[49:38] you've been walking around many of you
[49:40] didn't realize the whole day you've been
[49:41] walking in a vision things are taking
[49:44] place God is moving hey man he said when
[49:48] I realized where I was like I said
[49:50] there's nothing that can stop it the
[49:52] situation is under control faith that
[49:56] was in my heart was anointed he's at all
[49:58] if I could only explain that
[50:00] said but only thing I had to do is speak
[50:02] the word and the little boy rose from
[50:04] the dead hallelujah but we get impatient
[50:08] we wanted to happen when we wanted to
[50:10] happen we wanted to come and we wanted
[50:12] to come how he wanted to come what we
[50:14] expected what we wanted how we want it
[50:16] to be and many times we we're trying to
[50:19] turn the knobs and and line it all up
[50:21] let God do it Isaiah 40 and verse 28
[50:29] says hast thou not known hast thou not
[50:34] heard that the everlasting God I mean
[50:39] that right there is enough to make

[54:14] paths lead me in thy truth and teach me
[54:16] for thou art the God of my salvation all

[54:31] of good courage and he shall strengthen
[54:35] thy heart wait I say on the Lord Romans
[54:41] 8:24 says we are saved by hope but hope
[54:44] that is seen is not hope but what a man
[54:48] seeth why doth he yet hope for but if we
[54:52] hope for that which we that we see not
[54:54] then do we with patience wait for it
[54:59] because we know it's worth waiting for
[55:06] Alleluia do you know how it is when you

[55:18] something you've been wanting that well
[55:20] you know you have a certain amount of
[55:23] confidence in the delivery system and
[55:24] things and I know things get a little
[55:26] hairy even nowadays but you don't have
[55:28] to have no worry with this delivery
[55:30] system this delivery system amen the ups
[55:35] and us beYOU know States Postal Service

[55:49] it means that some packages may not ever
[55:52] get to some package get lost and they
[55:53] only know where they came from where or
[55:55] where they're at they get lost you don't
[55:57] you're like how how do you lose
[55:58] something but somehow it happens lose
[56:00] luggage on the airline that happens but

[56:35] love
[56:36] it's a sinful and wicked world but yet
[56:39] all all yet all these things has to be
[56:42] mastered in the Lord Jesus who told us
[56:44] that all things working or working
[56:46] together for the good to them that love
[56:48] God and we're consoled this morning to
[56:51] believe that many of these things are to
[56:55] bring us to our knees and we like to
[56:57] think of the Scriptures that they that
[56:59] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[57:02] strength they shall mount up with wings
[57:05] as an eagle in other words you're going
[57:07] to have victory over that issue

[57:12] defeat but I'm going to give you victory
[57:14] over that just wait upon it they shall
[57:19] mount up with wings as an eagle they
[57:22] shall run and not be weary they that
[57:25] walk will not faint as the poet said
[57:28] teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait he
[57:31] said I'd let us today as we're waiting

[57:37] and from the mouth of our Savior to the
[57:39] Holy Spirit that we will wait patiently
[57:42] to hear his voice speak loving things to
[57:46] us through his word speak pardons for
[57:49] our sins speak healings for our
[57:51] sicknesses and may we leave this
[57:53] building this morning rejoicing and
[57:55] saying like those that came from Emmaus
[57:58] did not our hearts burn within us as he
[58:01] talked with us but we truly believe that
[58:03] he is a risen Lord as he was they found
[58:06] him that day and he is again in the
[58:08] midst of his people and we shall not be
[58:11] weary and our hearts will not grow faint
[58:13] but let us renew our strength each hour
[58:15] and do God grant it today Lord Jesus
[58:19] what a prayer I said then remember if he
[58:24] is his word is true and if he required
[58:30] you to meet certain circumstances and
[58:32] you did he's obligated to bring it to
[58:36] pass don't back off I don't care what
[58:42] happens don't back off of it but then
[58:45] preach that the other day hold the line
[58:48] don't back off
[58:50] so oh I'll never got never get healed I
[58:52] never got here he said that's weak don't
[58:55] believe that if everything's confessed
[58:57] and you've met God refined requirement

[59:24] showdown and God will come and meet your
[59:27] needs you know he loves to test us he
[59:30] loves to see the reaction of your faith
[59:32] I can't ever forget myself just said
[59:37] this other day I believe but just so
[59:39] struck me a brother Giovanni in New York
[59:42] been praying for those believers there
[59:44] whether you've on carry on the church
[59:47] was actually supposed to be there in the
[59:49] next weekend or so to minister for them
[59:51] but with the circumstances we've had to
[59:54] postpone it but his wife searching for a
[59:58] child and seeking for a child and
[1:00:00] constantly as Hannah agonizing day and
[1:00:02] night he takes her to the pastor with a
[1:00:06] dish full and does that his wits and
[1:00:08] some pastors talk with her several times
[1:00:11] I remember the story correctly and said
[1:00:15] did she I finally asked her this
[1:00:16] question sister what if he don't answer
[1:00:19] what if he don't give you a child
[1:00:21] then what said she just kind of hung her
[1:00:25] head all of a sudden her eyes come up
[1:00:28] direct and looked him direct and I said
[1:00:31] I was still loving serving anyhow
[1:00:35] her response moved the master he's
[1:00:42] wanting to know sometimes how you're
[1:00:43] going to react are you going to wait
[1:00:46] patiently or you gonna get all agitated
[1:00:48] and aggravated and just move off when
[1:00:51] the answer was on the way I remember my
[1:00:56] father's told this about Lydia being so
[1:00:58] sick with some kind of virus stomach
[1:01:02] virus you she was a little kid the high
[1:01:03] drayton i sucking in he's rocking her in
[1:01:10] a chair and praying Ford asked him God
[1:01:13] to be merciful he said also they looked
[1:01:16] down them over lo black eyes was looking
[1:01:18] at him and she just loves a little girl
[1:01:21] said daddy ain't God good it moved the
[1:01:27] heart of the master within a moment or
[1:01:30] just a little while she was completely
[1:01:31] healed God is looking for our reactions
[1:01:37] how are we going to respond what are we
[1:01:39] going to do how is our faith gonna act
[1:01:42] react
[1:01:42] is it gonna react and are we going to
[1:01:44] react with doubt or fear anxiety or
[1:01:47] depression or worrier follow away or
[1:01:50] what are we going to do are we going to
[1:01:53] stand there and say don't God slay me oh
[1:01:56] I'm gonna trust him though he take a
[1:02:00] knee Lord giveth and the Lord taketh
[1:02:01] away blessed be the name of the Lord no
[1:02:04] matter what takes place I'm gonna stand
[1:02:07] on the promises of God I'm not gonna
[1:02:09] back up from it what God said God will -
[1:02:13] it's his word is not mine when you met
[1:02:19] in his requirements
[1:02:20] he said don't run off like a coward God
[1:02:23] can't use that there's no way for him to
[1:02:26] use it there's no way for him to answer
[1:02:28] you when you run off he only answers
[1:02:30] faith then all of a sudden you run off
[1:02:33] from it from the promise and he can't
[1:02:35] answer but real true faith I stand there
[1:02:38] being sure God is and you're certain
[1:02:42] that he is and if God asks this thing to
[1:02:44] be done to confess your sins and so
[1:02:46] forth and you've done it and your
[1:02:47] request has been made and everything is
[1:02:50] certainly your core request will be
[1:02:52] granted did you hear me tonight your
[1:02:56] requests will be granted hallelujah oh
[1:02:59] my he goes on he says see when you come
[1:03:03] to that moment where you can wait upon
[1:03:06] the Lord you shall renew strength you
[1:03:09] shall mount up with wings as an eagle
[1:03:11] he'll snatch you out of that cancer
[1:03:13] he'll snatch you out of that situation
[1:03:15] he'll snap
[1:03:16] that problem I think that you seemed so
[1:03:19] unbearable for you to bear god I move on
[1:03:21] the scene in a moment it don't take but
[1:03:24] a moment with him moving because when he
[1:03:26] moves he moves hallelujah
[1:03:30] sometimes they don't tape it just that's
[1:03:31] nothing but the truth all sudden there's
[1:03:35] something response on your heart say yes

[1:04:01] can lay hold on the promise and you wait
[1:04:03] for word he said wait upon thee for wait
[1:04:06] upon him for the salvation for the
[1:04:08] baptism of Holy Ghost for the joy of
[1:04:10] your heart for the healing of your body
[1:04:11] for every redemptive blessing that he
[1:04:14] died for at Calvary wait for it and
[1:04:17] gotta bring it to pass
[1:04:20] hallelujah today the wait upon the Lord
[1:04:26] shall renew their strength
[1:04:29] not our vision God your vision not what
[1:04:34] we want what you want he said I love
[1:04:37] that he said that's what I've had to do
[1:04:40] all my life and I'm happy I had to do it
[1:04:43] I wait every day in every hour just on
[1:04:48] what he will do I have no abilities of
[1:04:51] my own no education to depend on I just
[1:04:54] have to depend on him an hour by hour
[1:04:57] I'm waiting on him to see what he will
[1:05:00] tell me to do he says try not to get
[1:05:03] frustrated to get frustrated when
[1:05:05] hundreds of calls are sick and died he
[1:05:07] said if you get all frustrated then God
[1:05:10] can't use you just sit still
[1:05:12] he's big enough to tell you he's big
[1:05:16] enough to tell you just keep on speaking
[1:05:19] terms with him he'll tell you what to do
[1:05:21] when you get there it's best to just
[1:05:24] carry out a commission and then let him
[1:05:26] tell us what to do
[1:05:28] after we get there just keep walking
[1:05:31] with Jesus just keeping one day at a
[1:05:34] time through Jesus that's all I'm asking
[1:05:37] from you
[1:05:38] the scripture says again they that wait
[1:05:40] upon the Lord let me go on down here he
[1:05:47] said see he said Lord nothing in my arms
[1:05:51] I bring simply to that cross I clean you
[1:05:54] promised it Lord that's the kind of
[1:05:56] condition the reason people think that I
[1:05:58] I'm an isolationist but in the room and
[1:06:01] over the side of the desert that's the
[1:06:03] condition you got to get into before you
[1:06:05] walk into this pulpit here because Satan
[1:06:08] is always dropping little imps to try to
[1:06:11] upset something oh yeah you must be
[1:06:14] trying you must be right holding on to
[1:06:16] the cross not trusting in your own
[1:06:18] ability not trusting in your own
[1:06:19] thoughts not leaning to your own ever
[1:06:22] light not not leaning to your own
[1:06:23] understanding but leaning on the
[1:06:25] everlasting arms claiming no
[1:06:27] intelligence claiming no mind of your
[1:06:29] own
[1:06:30] you're just opening yourself up and
[1:06:32] letting the Holy Spirit speak that's the
[1:06:35] condition God wants his church in oh I
[1:06:39] thought that was the prophet of God
[1:06:41] that's the condition God wants his
[1:06:44] church in and then the next sentence get
[1:06:47] in that condition hallelujah
[1:06:52] not our own ideas not what we want not
[1:06:55] our own intelligence not our own
[1:06:57] understanding but I'm leaning on the
[1:06:59] everlasting arms get in that condition
[1:07:02] get in that moment because Satan is
[1:07:05] always there to drop his little imps and
[1:07:07] say hi you just made that up he ain't
[1:07:10] gonna do what he said huh it's
[1:07:11] impossible i bla bla bla
[1:07:13] he's got all kind of bla bla bla bla bla
[1:07:15] and that's all it is is a bunch of bla
[1:07:19] bla bla bla but God's Word says and what
[1:07:23] God's Word says shall come to pass
[1:07:27] God might try and he will every Sun that
[1:07:31] cometh to God will be tried chasing but
[1:07:35] if we walk up and say I believe Jesus
[1:07:37] Christ as the Son of God he died for my
[1:07:41] sins
[1:07:42] rose on the third day wounded for my
[1:07:44] transgressions bruised for my nickel
[1:07:47] tees say what are you doing you're
[1:07:49] putting yourself in the vision you're
[1:07:51] seeing yourself in the vision oh it's
[1:07:54] all okay to say sister he was bruised
[1:07:56] for sister Elena's I can see that yeah
[1:07:58] he was he was wounded for a sister
[1:08:02] Mariah's oh yeah I can see that our
[1:08:05] sister cares yeah I can see that but he
[1:08:07] was wounded for my transgressions he was
[1:08:13] bruised for my what are you doing you're
[1:08:18] seeing yourself in the vision hallelujah
[1:08:24] he don't do no good to see so-and-so in
[1:08:26] the vision that's great that's wonderful
[1:08:28] but what about yourself
[1:08:31] can you put yourself there he did
[1:08:36] hallelujah yes say yes Lord that was me
[1:08:39] all glory to God you say yes Lord that's
[1:08:42] me I accept it right now
[1:08:45] I accept he was wounded for my changes
[1:08:49] he was bruised for my iniquity and by
[1:08:52] your stripes God tests us we'll go
[1:08:58] through things but they that wait upon
[1:09:01] the Lord shall renew their strength your
[1:09:07] strength will be the strength other
[1:09:09] words a strength will be given to you to
[1:09:11] fulfill the Word of God and it won't be
[1:09:15] your strength it won't be what you can
[1:09:17] manufacture it'll be his strength
[1:09:19] placed inside of you to say your sword
[1:09:24] accepted you know they just put out
[1:09:28] brother Michael different ones on the
[1:09:30] team has been putting out these
[1:09:32] different clips different sections or
[1:09:35] what's the name for them looking for
[1:09:37] episodes episodes the brother had
[1:09:40] bisko's testimony this is here recently
[1:09:43] the green checkered shirt come out it's
[1:09:48] powerful
[1:09:49] the venom in this quote to become with
[1:09:52] us to fulfill all righteousness a
[1:09:54] wonderful service
[1:09:55] wonderful sermon he's looking at going
[1:10:00] on a on a hunting trip and he tells
[1:10:02] about how that he was going to kill this
[1:10:04] these had trophies it was a big
[1:10:08] chocolate-colored a member of correctly
[1:10:11] chocolate-colored trophy and then a bear
[1:10:14] big silver shining bear huge mammoth
[1:10:19] animal and in there he also saw
[1:10:21] something that seems so to us or to what
[1:10:24] we would think very insignificant a
[1:10:27] green checkered shirt and it seems like
[1:10:32] out of all of that why would that be so
[1:10:35] important why how would that have such
[1:10:38] significance but something there stood
[1:10:40] out and he's going there and he speaks
[1:10:45] about how would they he saw these little
[1:10:47] hands that reach down to hold the tape
[1:10:49] and he hears a voice says it's 42 inches
[1:10:52] and he go getting so that's all he tells
[1:10:55] us tell us about it and go watch that
[1:10:57] clip is very very wonderful but as we
[1:11:01] know where they had he giving his
[1:11:02] testimony talked about he slipped he's
[1:11:04] gone that trip he he had had this green
[1:11:07] checkered shirt and he he thought well
[1:11:09] you know it's had a rip or some kind of
[1:11:10] tear in and it seemed like he didn't
[1:11:12] have much use anymore and he asked his
[1:11:14] wife just to get him a new one
[1:11:15] and but she saw him still you notice of
[1:11:18] course there was other things that you
[1:11:19] can hear the testimony of that hindered
[1:11:21] her Benna to go get her him a new him a
[1:11:24] new shirt but she saw that where she
[1:11:26] could fix it but not realizing that she
[1:11:28] was fixing it she was holding in her
[1:11:30] hand something that had been seen in a
[1:11:33] vision just going about everyday life
[1:11:35] and and making decisions but holding
[1:11:38] something that had to be in his place at
[1:11:41] a proper time and had to be in a bag on
[1:11:43] a certain trip and a certain place and
[1:11:46] and God's timing working these things
[1:11:48] out because God had already seen the
[1:11:50] months ahead or whatever it was did you
[1:11:58] hear that
[1:12:00] sometimes we think God only and don't
[1:12:02] even know what we're doing today God do
[1:12:05] you know what I'm going through today do
[1:12:07] you see he already is way
[1:12:09] interview God do you realize what I'm
[1:12:13] suffering with you he's already way
[1:12:16] ahead of you
[1:12:19] here she is puts this thing back in the
[1:12:22] bag mins and puts it back he don't even
[1:12:24] realize it until he's walking out and
[1:12:25] falls in the creek gets wet gets it in
[1:12:27] the cold and so he goes a brother man
[1:12:29] run back and change reaches in his shirt
[1:12:31] what does he pull his bag was he pulled
[1:12:33] out this green checkered shirt he's like
[1:12:37] I told my wife to throw this away and
[1:12:39] here it is and so he puts it on and even
[1:12:41] him not realizing what's taking place
[1:12:44] what's going on just going everyday
[1:12:46] about like another another day you know
[1:12:49] things
[1:12:49] accidents happen things happen things go
[1:12:51] on and he's moving right in a vision
[1:12:54] things are taking place right in the
[1:12:56] vision I want you to understand your
[1:12:58] everyday life is taking place right in a
[1:13:00] vision
[1:13:02] God's already saw this he's already seen
[1:13:05] it now you may not foretell every day
[1:13:08] you get to how he did that day or he's
[1:13:10] done other days he may but they meant
[1:13:12] but no matter what God's already seeing
[1:13:14] the day that you're in and the day that
[1:13:17] you're getting to and the weeks ahead in
[1:13:19] the months ahead years ahead if he tears
[1:13:21] whatever God already knows about it but
[1:13:27] it's so struck me as I got to thinking
[1:13:31] about this worthless checkered shirt you
[1:13:37] know you know I'm not trying I'm not at
[1:13:40] all trying to make brother ed to be the
[1:13:42] devil or anything like this he was doing
[1:13:44] what we need us would do get rid of an
[1:13:46] old shirt this ragged and torn but that
[1:13:48] shirt had been seen in a vision but the
[1:13:51] same in the same aspect the same kind of
[1:13:54] thought the devil wants to take
[1:13:56] something that seemingly has no value or
[1:13:59] to make it of no value or to tear it
[1:14:01] apart and rip it apart and throw it in a
[1:14:03] waste bin somewhere and say it is
[1:14:05] nothing but it has to be at a certain
[1:14:07] place home I remember me I was a green
[1:14:14] checkered shirt one time a man been tore
[1:14:17] up ripped up and we rented for the
[1:14:18] garbage can so to speak but somebody
[1:14:21] that
[1:14:22] rich and mercy reach down to where I was
[1:14:24] and picked me up and began to mend my
[1:14:28] life back and made me renewed me again
[1:14:31] to where I could be in my place in my
[1:14:33] part in a vision and I want you to
[1:14:37] understand

[1:14:40] can throw you in a trash can somewhere
[1:14:42] or destroy your life or to take you down
[1:14:45] to something ain't enough Devils that
[1:14:47] can take you out

[1:14:57] seen overcoming and Satan's very own
[1:15:00] easy hallelujah and some of you he's
[1:15:04] tried to water and throw in a trash can
[1:15:06] somewhere but God rich in mercy picked
[1:15:10] you up and said no he's not destined for
[1:15:13] a trash can he's not destined for hell
[1:15:15] that wasn't made for him and was made
[1:15:18] for you devil that was made for you
[1:15:20] devil but for this one he's in a vision
[1:15:22] this one's in a vision this one's in a
[1:15:24] vision not the world vision not
