lord god of of my body lord god of my voice lord i'm asking you to have complete preeminence lord lord that you would shut my mouth where need be and allow me to speak freely what it is you'd have spoken but we turn our attention to you now lord and ask you to come and ask you to move for truly that's why we have gathered we ask these things in your precious name jesus name amen amen if you would turn in your bibles with me to luke the first chapter and the 26th verse and then when we're done there we're also going to look over in ruth the second chapter amen luke 1 and 26. it says in the in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women we'll look over it now and to ruth the second chapter and we'll start at the 10th verse it says then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou should take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger and boaz answered and said unto her it hath been fully showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how that has left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust may god add his blessings now you may have your seats tonight we're going to speak on thou hast found favor and with the subtitle being favored through your trials favored through your trials the last time we spoke we spoke on thou hast found favor and we're going to continue that tonight going into favored through your trials and last time when we spoke we saw that mary was visited by an angel with a message and as we know that message came to her and told her that she was going to have a son that the holy ghost would overshadow her and that she was going to bring forth jesus the savior and in the delivering of that message the angel tells mary on two different occasions in their conversation the angel tells her on two different occasions that she has found favor in luke 1 28 it says held art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and then in luke 1 and 30 it says and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and i believe in this day that we're a people that has received this same message i believe that we've heard an angel messenger come and say fear not little bride thou has found favor despite what you see and what's going on around you there's a message that has come to you to tell you that you are in god's favor and this is to put your mind at ease this is to give you peace to understand that his grace and his favor is upon your life and if we'll look to that and look at every situation that we go through and recognize that even in this trial even in this situation i'm still in god's favor his favor and grace are upon us it'll help us to see things through a whole different viewpoint and look at it in a different way many times it's so difficult for us to make sense when the scripture says that all things work together for good and you struggle with that and notice it doesn't say all things are good it says that they'll work together for good and a lot of times the reason we do struggle with that so often is many times we look at things through materially to our flesh how is this helping me and yet many times god looks at blessings and god looks at good through a spiritual standpoint regardless of how difficult this is on your flesh regardless of how difficult this is on your everyday life in the end in eternity which is what matters this is working out for your good and so that's where we have to come to and realize that that we are favored one thing that stood out to me as i studied about mary along the way is is the emphasis that brother branham put on her thinking he put a great emphasis on her thinking and what she was dwelling on and how her thoughts were on the word how her thoughts were on a living god there were a million other things going on in the world at that time that she could have easily been thinking about as she walked along that day her people had become cold and formal and they had they had become a people of tradition they had become lukewarm and and the world politically was in an upheaval there was all these things that she could have put her mind on turmoil and rebellions in the land she could have been thinking about her upcoming wedding that would have been something that would have been very normal for her to be thinking about the upcoming wedding and maybe how are we going to afford this this ceremony that i've always had or maybe the stress of joseph's job and joseph's work and and the things that have been going on there at the carpenty carpentry shop and and how are we going to get all this stuff between now and then and and and there's so much stress and there's this everything's coming up and i'm trying to plan a wedding and this is going on and there's stress and there's uncertainty and yet we find her walking down a path with her mind stayed on jesus we find her walking down a path thinking about his goodness we find her thinking about his love and what a wonderful god he is and that's where her mind is she's thinking about the scroll that her and joseph had read together and because of this brother branham will tell us that's why she receives a visitation church let's get our mind back on him tonight there's been a lot of turmoil in the land in the last few months and even longer than that and with with the cove and the things we've talked about so many times but in this moment let's stop let's recognize where we've been where our focus has been and let's get our mind back on jesus tonight may it be that even tonight when you walk out you can say my mind has stayed on jesus and when i wake up in the morning my mind has stayed on jesus and look things are going to come throughout the day trials are going to come you're going to get hit in the face things are going to stress you out that's part of life but in that moment say god my mind is stayed on you i'm gonna keep my mind stayed on you and on your goodness get your mind back on his goodness tonight back to thinking on eternal things and less about the temporal things that surround us in other words let's prepare ourselves for a visitation let's prepare for a visitation your life may be an absolute turmoil right now you may have had the worst day you've ever had this may have been the worst week you've ever had this may be the worst month you've ever had it may be the absolute worst year of your life and yet i'm telling you prepare for a visitation prepare your hearts prepare your home for a visitation because it only takes one moment in that visitation to change it all that situation you're dealing with and the things you're going through one moment one visitation one second with that presence and it can change everything that you're facing we're gonna keep that in mind tonight one moment one moment listen one moment and let me tell you the devil may tell you that yours isn't coming listen you have a moment you have a moment and that moment is on the way you are rapidly approaching that moment with every second that ticks off the clock every minute that ticks off the clock you are approaching your moment where the angel is going to step on the scene for your need step on the scene for your home for your children for your sickness your moment is coming and you have to have your mind stayed on him so when the moment arrives you recognize the moment don't miss your moment don't miss your moment don't let the moment pass you by don't let the moment be something that's already gone and you say where is it where is it abraham was in the tent door he was in the tent door looking and that's why he had the visitation don't miss your moment because it's coming your moment is on the way you won't miss your moment if your mind has stayed on him brother branham says if you want the honor of an angel visiting your home have a home ready for him to visit ready and under the blood of the lamb the angels of the lord come to such places and the angels come to such people people looking to him people thinking on him people prepared for a visitation be that kind of people tonight so we know mary found favor with god and because of this favor she received a blessing the angel would say blessed art thou among women and she receives the honor and the privilege that she's going to bring forth our lord jesus christ it was a great honor as a matter of fact i would say that i could stand up here and try my best and i would never be able to put into words the magnitude of this honor that was bestowed upon her we could never really truly explain what what an honor this is and that she has found this favor with god but what we don't usually talk about is the struggle that would come along with this favor the lifetime of being shunned the lifetime of ridicule the doubt and the speculation that would follow her every day for the rest of her life she was an unwed mother not only unwed but if you take it a step further and think about unwed and joseph's not even the father of the child in her humanity in that moment we've all been there when you get news or something happens and it's amazing how many things you can think about just in a couple seconds all the things and the situations and you can play out all these things just in a moment in her humanity she had to know in her humanity she had to know i'm going to be pregnant what are people going to say how are people going to treat me i'm going to be an outcast the rest of my life i'm going to be called all manner of names they're going to try to stone me what's joseph going to say think about all the thoughts that must be running through her mind think about all the fears think about satan being there whispering think about the doubt trying to creep in and in all of that the fear the threat of death all the things i'm fisting to give up my entire life i'm fisting to be tormented i'm going to be an outcast no one will socialize with me for the rest of my life be it unto me in the moment when she weighs it out when she weighs the favor of god with the trials and the hardships that are going to come with it her response is that be it unto me she looked at it and she put enough value on god's favor she valued it enough that it didn't matter what came with it in the negative it didn't matter the trials that would come it didn't matter what a tax would come when she put it in the balance and she weighed it she said i want that favor i want that blessing be it unto me lord and tonight i say lord no matter what we go through whatever we have the world may say you're laying this aside and you're missing out on that and you may be called holy roller in old-fashioned whatever be it unto me lord i'll take whatever comes my way as long as i know i'm in your favor as long as i know i have you standing with me by my side be it unto me she deemed his favor greater than the struggle she knew she would face she deemed it greater than any hardship greater than any trial greater church his favor is greater than anything you can name tonight anything you can imagine anything you can hope for god i want your favor it is a greater once visited by the angel once she had received her message she knew no matter what i faced today i'm favored no matter what happens tomorrow i'm favored it was that favor that from that point on would define her life the life of struggle did not define mary the life of struggle is not what defined her and once you have received his favor that is what defines you listen you are not that health problem you were not that depression you were not that anxiety cancer does not define you those suicidal thoughts you've been having that does not define you that's not who you are you have been favored by the lord jesus christ that's who you are that's what he called you he called you bride you are his favored bride the other stuff doesn't define you cast it aside and look on them i will not i will not be made be known as cancer or depression or anxiety i'm going to walk in his favor that is what defines me that is who you are we can't allow satan to elevate the trial or the struggle that we're in to the point to where it outweighs in our own mind the favor that god has given us all that mary would go through watching her son be tortured watching him die the labels that were put upon her well there's his mother that's the mother of the one up on the cross you know about her right you know you know what happened with her right you've heard those crazy stories none of this changed the favor that was given her she knew that she had received a visitation she knew she'd received a visitation here and here's where we're at tonight here's where i want to preach is that your circumstances your trials your hardships whether they be a day's worth whether they be a week's worth whether they be a month's worth a year's worth and and in some cases a lifetime's worth no matter what they are does not change the fact that an angel came to tell you thou has found favor with god none of that changes that thou has found favor with god the satan wants to come and worm his way in and we know that satan is the master of mind games he's the master of torment and he loves to bring doubt he loves to bring fear and he loves to bring worry and anxiety and he loves to attach them to you when you're already low he loves to come when you're already weak when you're already going through a trial when when you are in the fight of your life that's one thing as christians sometimes we need to recognize is we need to be empathetic towards other people's trials because what may be so terrible to me brother joe may look at and go that's got you down or i may see what brother joe's going through and i'm like they don't seem like that big of a deal but i'm not the one in the arena fighting the fight that he's fighting you're not the one in the arena fighting the fight that i'm fighting and so you have to understand that what may seem so simple what may you know well they're going through some anxiety what's the big deal to them it may be the very fight of their life it may be the point in their life where they're at a tipping point god i need you god you have to move in my life god i'm struggling i need you and we as christians need to get behind those people and get behind and realize they are in a fight we are all in a fight and just because i may not understand your trial i understand the god that can bring your trial to an end and i understand that i need to be on my knees crying out for god's people because they are under attack satan is on the rampage and he's trying every little thing listen he studies you in that thing that doesn't seem like a big deal to me he understands that it's a big deal to you and that's where he attacks you because he knows your weakness and as a church body let's come together and pray one for another because every single one of us are in the fight for our lives every single one of us are in a fight we're at the end time and he's pouring everything he's got against you but i'm telling you we're not gonna lose we're gonna overcome we're gonna be victorious because we have found favor with almighty god in these moments the enemy's going to come he's going to begin to torment try to make you question and doubt and most of the time what you find with the devil is he's not going to make you question and doubt god although he will do that but most of the time that's not where he comes most of the time he wants you to question and doubt yourself he wants to come and bring attention to to you and get you to dwelling on you and if he can have you dwelling on you then he's got you dwelling on your worst enemy he's got you dwelling on the one that gives you the most problems he wants to have you thinking about having you think your own thoughts and he wants you thinking on your failures your weaknesses your unworthiness he wants you dwelling on your past and the thing with this is a lot of times he don't even have to do all the digging because we like to dig it up ourselves oh you know what a failure i mean you know how i messed up here and you know how i messed up there no no there's a blood there's a bleach that wiped all that away and and it was put in the in the sea of god's forgetfulness and satan's not allowed to go and get those things it's us sometimes that bring it up it's us that bring up our own doubt it's us that lays our own past trust in the bleach of his blood trust that the work is finished look to your sacrifice and trust that the sacrifice was sufficient that it's finished that those things are in the past and don't allow satan to beat you around a stump over your past at least you have a future at least you have an eternity that you're going to his past is no better than your past it's probably much worse but at least you have a future he has no future in his future he is defeated in his future he is destroyed in my future i will be dancing on the streets of gold while he is in hell in torment paying for the sins that he accused me of that is my future do not do satan's job for him do not give satan a voice let your testimony be i am redeemed i am bought with the price i'm justified i'm sanctified i'm filled with the spirit i am an overcomer say what the word says about you we were taught by a prophet that our mental attitude plays such an important role the thoughts that you dwell on the words you say and just as we know that the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass the wrong mental attitude towards the promise of god will hinder that promise from being brought to pass brother branham says you have to move your thinking get away from reason and move your thoughts from your own way of thinking to what god thinks let the mind that was in christ jesus be in you and then when you begin to think his thoughts you'll begin to live his life listen to that now when you begin to think his thoughts you'll begin to live his life and do the things that he did he says always rely upon him never use your own mind take his thoughts let his thoughts be your thoughts take them into your carnal mind and repeat them over and say oh god take all my doubt away let my thoughts be your thoughts and you sick people do that as we're speaking just take away cast away thoughts of sickness take god's healing thought let them become your thoughts think upon these things the bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things so even in the midst of your trial when you're under attack mind body soul every single place that he's attacking he's coming you're under attack think about yourself the way god thinks about you brother timothy's been preaching on casting down imagination cast down those thoughts that come about come against you and let this mind be in you i know the thoughts that i think of you thoughts of good and not of evil in his mind there are no evil thoughts towards you so many times it's what god's judging me i know the thoughts that i think of you his thoughts say i'm healed his thoughts say i'm saved his thoughts say i'm delivered his thoughts say i'm gonna make it his thoughts say i never did it in the first place those are his thoughts that's where we must dwell that's where we must live in his thoughts his thoughts say i am favored in church his thoughts are eternal thoughts they cannot change brother brown says and the only thing you have to do to know he is here is get yourself out of the way see as long as you're in the way then god cannot do nothing for you when you think your thoughts then god's thoughts don't have a chance but if you'll quit thinking your thoughts and think his thoughts my thoughts is not your thoughts he said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things because see this is where the devil would get us when the trial starts when the trouble starts when everything's going against you and it seems like the whole world is falling apart he comes and he whispers this is all your fault you've done something wrong and we begin to question ourselves we begin to examine ourselves now get this we begin to examine ourselves through the filter of the accuser instead of through the word we begin to look at ourselves through the filter of the accuser instead of through the word and through that filter you are a failure through the filter of the accuser we are all failures through that filter we see everything that we've ever done wrong and we begin to wonder am i still in his favor have i sinned is god angry with me does god even love me is god punishing me god have i lost your favor i hate the devil i hate him and just forgive me as i let him know i hate him he's a liar he's a thief he's a murderer he's a vulture he's a snake he's lots of other things that i wish i had words to describe him with listen to me you have not lost favor god loves you satan is a liar he died for you he gave his life for you he sent back the holy spirit for you he sent a message for you and he's going to send you a body change he's going to rapture you he's going to take you home because you have found favor satan is defeated he's a liar and he can't hold you here you're going home you're going in a rapture you have not sinned you have not lost favor you have been forgiven you are filled with the spirit you're his bride he's poured it out upon you and satan is a liar the current trials you are going through are not your fault i'm going to say it again it is not your fault listen to the prophet of god he said job went through trials and the tests his children taken everything else taken the church members came accused him of being a secret sinner they tried to say everything against him but he wouldn't listen to any of it he knew he had met god's requirements he knew that there's no seed of satan trying to tempt him he knowed it was the devil and as long as satan can make him believe now listen as long as satan can make him believe that his sickness was his god doing it he had job whipped but when job once struck that revelation that it was not god he was only going through this trial to make him something it wasn't god doing it it was satan doing it it's not you it's not god it is satan it is your enemy putting you through this it is your enemy bringing this attack it's him trying to get you doubting god's favor oh satan how a liar you are brother branham would say he is lying to you tonight he worms his way in and begins to cause complexes in our mind makes you think less of yourself and digs down deep into your past and into your life and brings suicidal thoughts and brings anxieties and depressions church tonight god's bringing some different thoughts to you cast aside those thoughts you are redeemed you are loved you are beautifully and wonderfully made it is not your fault the trial that you're going through tonight you've been forgiven whatever sin whatever lie whatever thing he's holding over your head he is going to suffer the payment for those sins he's going to pay for it not you you've been bought with the price you've been redeemed the blood has paid for that you never did it in the first place you have not lost favor you're having trials that's a part of life it says when you see something going wrong for a fellow that don't mean that he's being whipped by god it might not even be that he's out of the will of god he knows in his heart whether he's listening to the trumpet or not and we're not saying i'm not trying to say or or make it sound like that god never will use your circumstances to get your attention sometimes we're not saying that god doesn't allow things to come sometimes to draw you closer to him but satan uses these things to make you assume that you are guilty of some type of sin okay and his purpose is to keep you from operating in the full authority and favor that god has provided for you to keep you living below your privileges because when you feel like you're out of the favor of god then you feel like you're not on speaking terms with god because you're not in favor with him and you feel like you're not on speaking terms so you're afraid to approach the king for your need and that's why he tries to keep this over your head but once you realize that you're favored and that you can have an audience with the king and that you are on speaking terms listen once mary realized that she was the virgin from the book of isaiah then all the trials and anything that anybody said didn't matter to her anymore once she found her place in that book and realized that's me that's me i'm that virgin and once you realize that you're that bride without spot or without wrinkle that it speaks of in the scripture then what does it matter what trials you must face what does it matter what somebody would say that's me that's me right there and if i can see myself there that i can see myself in a rapture i can see myself overcoming i can see myself in eternity that's me man has struggled job said that man is born of a woman a few days and full of trouble and yet they are not the reflection of your standing with god he says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of god's disapproval the cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval on any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and he manifested that he loved us and he brought us to himself and he gave us us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass how do i prove my love to him by acting in joy in the trials that he and his wisdom has allowed to come to pass look if you think that the trials that you're going through or because of your failures because of your shortcomings or your inadequacies or perhaps maybe even some sin i'd like you to listen to the description of a man in the scripture if we can look at job one and one if i just read the first verse of job i'd say man i'd like to be that man if that's where you stopped job 1 1 says there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect wow perfect what a description what a description of a man even written under under the law you know this isn't even a situation where we're looking at it in the new testament like where it talks about abraham and says he's staggering this is right there in the old he's perfect he is perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil what a man i i i dare say it's not easy to get this testimony written about you this is no small achievement let's go down to verse 8 it says and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job this is god himself speaking that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and skeweth evil now notice why job is about to go through everything he's about to go through notice why the tests are coming is it because of his failures because apparently he hadn't none is it because he has sinned as we go on satan here it actually actually shows his nature and it's a nature that you see reflected many times in humanity and he says in verse 9 then satan answered the lord and said doth job fear god for naught has not thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land so satan is actually accusing job of only fearing god because of material blessings and what it is is that's satan's own nature speaking out he would only be subservient to god as long as he received a reward he thought he should receive as long as he received the position he thought he should receive and the honor he thought he was so he's speaking of job the way he thinks himself job's only doing this because of the blessings you've given him and no doubt he's encountered this many times in many different people ever since the fall had taken place and so he just assumes job is just like all those other people and i'm telling you satan has probably encountered that same attitude in different churches and different denominations down through the ages as he come with this temptation in this trial and they fell away when the material blessings fell off or when things got harder where things got difficult and he's looking at this church and he's looking at this bride and he's saying no doubt they will fall the exact same way that these other did but i'm telling you there's a there's a church here that's like job that says no matter what happens no matter what comes my way i'm gonna serve him because i know my redeemer lives i know what he's done for me i've seen the change in my life i know and it doesn't matter what trials it doesn't matter what i'm stripped of or what's taken from me i know my redeemer lives he may come against us thinking we're going to fall like everybody else but this one will stand this one will stand the test of time this one will go home in a rapture he accuses him of serving god for the material blessings verse 14 we're going to go through this and i'm going to skip some as we go just to get the point it says then there came a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the ass is feeding beside them and the sabians fell upon them and took them away they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword verse 16 while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the fire of god has fallen from the heavens and hath burned up the sheep and the servants verse 17 while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the chaldeans fell upon the camels and have carried them away and slain the servants and while he was yet speaking guys this is just while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the oldest brother's house behold there came a great win from the wilderness smoked the four corners of the house it fell upon the young men and they are dead now notice here there's a key in the scripture to how you overcome when you're in the deepest darkest trials of your life first of all we've established that job is not going through this because of any shortcoming or any sin hear that for yourself you're not going through the trials of life that you're going through because of anything you've done wrong but here is a key that job that's written in the scriptures how you overcome and how you rise above when these things come upon you when everything is dark and everything is against you verse 20. then job arose rent his mantle shaved his head fell down upon the ground and blamed god fell down upon the ground and said i know i've done wrong fell down upon the ground and said i've sinned it's all my fault fell down upon the ground and fell into a deep state of depression so that everybody could see how awful his day had been and how awful his life was and began roaming to and fro looking for people to feel sorry for him i dare say that there's never been another day like the day job experience to one person and he fell upon the ground and worshipped that guy set the standard really high really high because it's so easy to get down but the minute you get down is the minute that he hits your ear and begins to talk but let me tell you what when you're walking through this world in the midst of chaos and you're praising god and your mind is on god and you're worshiping god and you're thanking god despite what happened at work yesterday and despite what you know you're gonna face tomorrow but you're thanking god anyway and you're worshiping god anyway you give the devil no foothold you give the devil no place to even come in and attack you don't even let him see for a moment and the devil's sitting there going i thrown everything at this man i put everything on him i put and he won't crack no matter what i put on those people and even like tabernacle there's a shout and there's a praise and there's a worship that comes out of their life and i can't stop them i can't make them crack because in the midst of it all they worship the king of kings in the midst of it all their life is a praise and there is the key there is a key right there to getting through your trials and through your hardships and job says naked i came out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord in all of this job sin not nor charged god foolishly and this wasn't even the end of the testing this is the first chapter that's chapter one brother brown says but all at once all the people got against him yeah everybody turned him down then the cyclones come killed his children killed all of his animals everything he had was gone then comes some of his then comes some of his very best maybe the deacons of his church see come to give him comfort and they were accusing him now job you know a man that was favored with god like you and all this happened to him there has got to be something wrong you've done something wrong job said i'm satisfied that i never my heart is clean before god i've made my sacrifice there you are then stand on it if you met god's requirements you stay right there don't you move church the sacrifice has been made the atonement has been made stand on it and don't you move no matter what the enemy says no matter what come stand right there stand right there at calvary where the blood was shed for your sin for your mistakes for your past stand right there and don't you move tonight don't accept anything that the devil would put upon you because you are justified you are sanctified you're bought with the price tonight you can say exactly like job said i know my redeemer lives but why is it because he doesn't want you to recognize the favor you have because he knows that if you operate in that favor you are absolutely unstoppable he knows that when you operate there he he can't stop you when you come to the revelation of who you are so he tries to cover you up and he tries to cover you up and he tries to bury you and i like that little saying i saw the other day said satan must not know i was a seed or else he wouldn't have buried me he must not have realized that all you is going to do is come on right on up through that and sprout out anyway because he can't put enough on you he can't bury you deep enough there's a son calling there's a deep calling to the deep and it doesn't matter what he's put on you and your life you are a seed and you will come up through that you will break through you will overcome because that seed has been germinated by a message that said you are highly favored it's germinated that seed something has awakened on the inside of you and all this stuff's on top of you but it won't stop you because the sun's drawing you the sun's drawing you and you're going to come forth and you are going to be beautiful just like he said you'd be without spot and without wrinkle he wants you to fail to operate and grasp the favor that god has bestowed upon you this goes back to the quote he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works and she will be an invincible army so everything he does is to keep you from that revelation because when you operate in the revelation of who you are that you are the very queen of heaven that you are bone of his bone that you are flesh of his flesh you are absolutely unstoppable you are that invincible army that he spoke of there in that quote never doubt god's favor in your life based on earthly circumstances circumstances do not change favor job did not lose favor listen if you have repented you are forgiven of every sin and every wrong you ever committed stand right there stand right there you you are forgiven now listen on the other hand if you truly need to repent of something then repent and move on repent and move on it's that simple we over complicate it so much we make it so difficult just repent and move on don't stay there and wallow in the mistake don't put yourself through some purgatory of your own creating repent move on brother bradham would say may the grace of god the power of the holy ghost if there's any evil in our hearts any evil in our hearts lord reveal it to us first and we'll make it right and then we know we have favor with god that seems so easy so simple we're going to repent we're going to make it right and then we know then we know that we have favor with god we have peace with god we get what we ask for because we have no condemnation granted lord in jesus name i pray amen it's over the thing you've been dealing with and the thing that's been tormenting you and the thing that's been fighting you it's over move on from it walk away from it walk towards that well body walk towards that deliverance walk towards that peace in your home walk towards that peace in your own mind walk away from the anxiety walk away from the sin that has been hindering you or what satan has been trying to put on you walk away from it repent and move on tonight because every single time you have a trial or every time you have trouble you can't go back to your mistakes and say well this is why this is why why why why why and you're bringing them up and you're bringing them up walk away from them quit going back to them every single time you're going through let me tell you why you're going through this you're going through this because god knows you're going to make it out you're going through this because god knows you will overcome it that's why you're going through it the prophet of god says right here now remember when god has counted you worthy same reason job went through it you've been counted worthy is why you're facing this trial you have been counted worthy is why you're facing this test god has counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail this don't fail to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of god has found you have found favor with god and the devil's been telling me this whole time i was going through this trial because i was out of favor with god a prophet says you're going through this trial because you found favor with god amen it's very true his thoughts are not our thoughts it's very true because us as humans would never think that or say that but a prophet of god says you're going through this because you have found favor with god and god believes that you will stand the test you remember he did the same thing with job satan said oh yes i've seen job down there said he's god god said he's a perfect sermon there's none in a perfect servant there's none in the earth like him there's nobody like job he's a perfect man now my he's my pride and joy satan said oh sure he gets everything he asked for said let me have him once said i'll make him curse you to your face said i'll just make him curse you god said he's in your hands but don't you take his life see god had confidence in job amen when it looks like everything has gone wrong god is giving you a trial he's got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid you're a real christian the devil's been telling you you're not a real christian while you're going through this brother brown says you're going through it because you're a real christian because god's got confidence that you're going to overcome he's given you a test see to see what you'll do about it amen no wonder peter said these fiery trials why count it's joy it's more precious to you than gold and many times we hum-haul oh well if i just well that will that's something god gave you he said well that's something god give you to overcome he knows you'll do it he's put his trust in you he's put his trust in you i'd like each and every one of us right now to remind the devil and let him know from your own lips god has confidence that i'm going to defeat you god has confidence in me you've been trying to tell me i'm a nobody you've been trying to tell me i'm no good and i can't make it i'd like to tell you that the king of kings and the lord of lords has looked down on me and said i've got confidence in you i believe you'll overcome laodicea i believe you'll make it through i know you're going to overcome you have my favor i've got confidence in you satan he has confidence in me he has confidence that i'm going to overcome him i've been hand picked for the trial that i'm in the middle of handpicked by god satan came in whispered satan came i'd like to tell him you thought that this trial was going to destroy me you thought this depression was going to destroy me you thought this sickness was going to destroy me you thought this stuff was going to bring me down and all it's done is brought jesus on the scene from my case all it's done is brought me closer to my lord and savior and because of that satan you are in big trouble you're in big trouble because now jesus is on the scene it was the waves that was trying to sink the boat that jesus came walking on and when he got there the devil didn't stand a chance he's walking on the ways of your life tonight he's walking on the waves coming to your boat in your trial and that trial that satan sent to destroy you is bringing jesus closer and he's coming right now to your pew to your situation to your trial because you're going to be victorious the thing is when it's all said and done i'm going to be stronger closer to god and blessed more than i ever was before the trial even started that's in the scripture i see it right there in job job 42 and 10. and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had 14 000 sheep six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses he had also seven sons and three daughters job knew what it was to go through hard times and yet in the hard times he found that he was favored what favor are we seeking what is it that we're putting first place what is it that keeps drawing us back when he's right there with his favor trying to give it to us trying to offer it to us now we won't be able to get into this tonight but even though we have found favors bestowed upon our life he still desires that we seek his favor daily he still desires that we look for his favor in every situation that we seek his favor and we seek his will hard times come usually unexpected and when they do what you're going to find out church is that the only way you're going to make it through those hard times is if you're 100 sold out if you've given everything you have and you're sold out you can make it through the trial we find in the scriptures that hard times came for naomi and ruth and ruth makes a decision i'm going to sell out i'm going to go all the way notice when they get there and things aren't just perfect and things aren't rosy and you know she comes to this this new land after her husband had died and her brother-in-law had died and her father-in-law had died and everything had turned against them and and she and she tells naomi i'm going to go with you and she gets to this new land and a lot of times when people make moves or they go places or there's a change in season you hope when you get there things are better you go there expecting things to turn many times in the middle of a trial you think you're just about to turn the corner and you do you turn the corner and you realize there's more of this ahead of me than there is behind me maybe i went around the wrong curve and we get our hopes dashed because we thought that was the end we thought that was the answer i thought for sure that was it this time i thought for sure it was over with ruth and naomi get she comes back with naomi and things are no better as a matter of fact things are not good at all to the point that they're gleaning for food now if you do a little bit of research you find out this is what the poor beggars did if you're gleaning for food it's because you're starving you don't have your own so you're relying upon the goodness of others to allow you to get their scraps things aren't good for and yet notice that she doesn't run back as soon as times get tough remember she's gleaning she has no other source of food she's on the very verge of starvation and she doesn't look back to moab and go i know if i go back there i could be welcomed back to my father's home and he would take care of me i know if i go back to moab i'll have a better life and the food was better and i had plenty to eat notice she's actually just the opposite of what the children of israel did the children of israel the minute the trials hit they're like well we can go back to egypt but she's different she's made of different stuff when the trial hits it's not i'm going back it's i've made my decision and i'm going to stand right here no matter what it takes i'm going to stand right here and fight this battle your god will be my god your god will be my god and i'm going to stand right here and that's what we've been trying to tell you tonight stand right there stand right there and she doesn't look back to mobad moab but she says i left everything behind it doesn't matter how hard life gets i'm going to stay right here in this land church you've been returned to the land you're in a good land and sometimes things get hard sometimes things get tough stay in the land stay in the land that's where you're going to be blessed that's the only place you can be blessed ruth says it doesn't matter if i have to glean to survive it doesn't matter i'm willing to do it so be it i'd rather glean here i'd rather struggle here i'd rather have hard times here than ever go back to what i came from church that's got to be our attitude i will not go back it matters not how hard it gets i'll glean here i'll struggle here i'll fight right here if needs be i'll die here but i will not go back i have sold out your god will be my god listen that's the attitude that's the attitude that will find favor with the kinsmen a sold out attitude that's the attitude that finds favor with the chemism this is where you find favor in your situation you sell out you don't turn back you stay with the word brother branham says the reason the church lost favor with god is they straight away from the word stay with the word and the lord of the harvest takes notice when you stay there and you stand there he takes notice listen ruth chapter 2 verse 8. then said boaz under ruth hearst thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine irons be on eyes be on the field that they do reap go thou after them have i not charge the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go into the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn then she fell down on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou should take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger he noticed that she had sold out listen in verse 11. and boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband how thou has left thy father and thy mother in the land of thy nativity and our come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore now notice what ruth seeks at this point she's already been given permission to glean she's been given permission to glean she has permission to go around and find the scraps but listen to what she seeks she recognizes the importance of his favor verse 13. then she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for thou has spoken friendly unto thy handmaid though i be not light unto one of thy handmaidens the prophet of god says and did you notice naomi returned in barley season just exactly at the right time when they were gathering barley and boaz was her kinsmen and he was harvesting his great fields the lord of the harvest and ruth the young gleaner went out into the field to glean a type of the gentile church gleaning picking up just what they could the gleaners going ahead oh they say you all haven't got the pentecostal blessing oh yeah we're gleaning all right look at the lord of the harvest when he looked down and seen the little woman ready to glean and pick up what she could a little blessing here and one there which was life to her beautiful type of the church today he said he said to the reapers every once in a while drop a handful oh i like to find them don't you just drop a handful for her said because she's found favor with me amen i like that she might be an off-cast a holy roder or whatever you want to call her but just drop a few handfuls now and then see i like her whoa i like those last three lines and boaz looked out there and said i like her the lord looks down he sees you may be struggling he sees it may have been a hard week a hard month a hard year a hard couple years and he says drop him a few handfuls on purpose i like them that's my queen i like her drop him something sustain her i'm jehovah jyrah this will get you through you still have my favor i like her what did it matter then what other thought what did it matter then what others said she found favor with the lord of the harvest she found favor with the one that could give it to her all it didn't matter then that the other said look she's a beggar look she's a holy roller look how they act in their services look how they run around and shout and speak in tongues i don't care i found favor with the lord of the harvest i found favor with the one that owns it all so your opinion doesn't matter anymore this trial doesn't matter anymore i found favor with the lord of the harvest what does it matter then what does that trial you're going through even matter this is greater this favor is greater you have found favor with a wealthy kinsmen you found favor with the wealthy kinsmen then what about that sin debt what about that debt the devil keeps trying to bring it up you've got a wealthy kinsman that paid it all what about that past you've got a wealthy kinsman i found favor with this kinsman and he paid the debt in full what about that need that's been in your life there's a wealthy kinsman he's in the building tonight to meet that need you've been granted an audience with the king tonight and he's telling you you have favor you found favor and he's asking you what are you going to do about it what about that need you came here with brother branagh says in 1965 we know this if we have favor with god we can ask him anything like you would any other friend and he is a very present help in the time of trouble he is a very present help in a time of trouble god can change that hard time in an absolute instant he can change your circumstances in just a moment see the devil tries to make you think the situation you're in is permanent he tries to make you think that sickness that you're going through that depression that you're going through is long term this affliction is here to stay you're going to be dealing with it forever you're going to be this and i'm going to have you this and what he knows and what he's trying to get you not to see that right now it can end right now it can be over as he sweeps through this building he can break that chain off your life you said he's broke every chain begin to believe it belinda confess it the kinsman is here and he's breaking chains this very moment he's here to pay your debt but all you got to do is say lord can i find favor in your sight i'm looking for favor in this moment i need you to move right now and break this chain off my life break this chain off my life he wants you to think this disease is long-term do not stop in your trial the minute you stop in your trial that trial becomes permanent those circumstances don't change because you're standing in the middle of it and you stopped you must press on you must keep walking because even in this trial that you're in you found favor with the kinsmen rule 3 11 says and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman boaz took notice of the life that she lived she felt downtrodden she felt outcast her family had been taken away she had nothing but she had a testimony and boaz took notice she sold out she sought his favor she had already been given permission to glean you've already been told you're favored but for this need tonight are you willing to say god i need your favor i need you to move right now this sickness this trial this hardship you're in it is not forever you are eternal this is not forever and it can end in a moment how how fast can it end brother aaron how quick can this all change one day ruth was gleaning in the field and the next day she owned it one day she was gleaning in a field starving to death and the next day she owned the whole thing the lord of the harvest has spoken and he said don't give up on the harvest don't give up on the harvest it's harvest time it's harvest season and you found favor with the lord of the harvest he's telling you i love you you still have my favor you've done nothing wrong that's a lie of the enemy i've noticed the life you're living i see that you've sold out you're a virtuous woman and i'm here to provide all that you have need of will you bow your heads with me tonight favor i'm so thankful that he has bestowed his favor upon us i'm so thankful that even when it seems like we've lost everything and the world has fallen apart around us we have a wealthy kinsman that has taken notice of all that we've gone through and yet he sees your testimony he says what about that past what about those things the devil keeps bringing up i've paid for it all you have found favor with the lord of the harvest what are you going to do with that favor you've been granting an audience with the king let me encourage you tonight that if you're in the midst of your battle you are not forsaken you are favored i know the thoughts that

appears where he steps right into your path like mary on the way says your favor i've got a plan for you that one moment oh i remember that one moment when my wife was blind peripheral vision gone laying in a bed being helped to the bouncing back and forth with a brain bleed a little grandson sat down at the end of the bed crippled never was able to walk 18 months old couldn't get up couldn't stand by himself or able to get up off the floor by himself one moment one moment that's all it took and one moment it changed forever eyesight came back a baby walked didn't walk he ran all over the house one moment one moment in his presence can change you forever oh i tell you you need to be looking for that moment you need to be expected for that moment you ought to be living for that moment remember when the angel will come by your way but you made him welcome you've been talking about him you've been praying you've been reading the word of god you've been listening to the tapes you've been under expectation and in that moment he comes just that one moment he changes things forever one moment a beggar in a field the next moment the owner of the field your touch [Music] is what i love [Music] this is mary she could say it [Music] is [Music] in that moment when god changed the things for job he could say your touch [Music] is [Music] had that never happened to job he would never have the revelation when the clouds roll back and the sun is coming through and say i know my redeemer lives and then the last day he'll stand and i'll know him i'll see him for myself and not another it was that those trials that brought him to that great revelation and it's these things in life that brings us to places but we receive that one touch from god you may be right on the cusp of your touch right on the edge of it because i said sunday don't give up on the harvest don't quit now press in harder than you ever have before and then surrender your life to god and say lord change me in your presence your touch is what i love you have here in the cross [Music] in the cross [Music] that i have to carry too long shall find the rest [Music] me [Music] jesus [Music] we're going to sing one more song and we're going to be dismissed as soon as jesus and my pardon this i surely know we've got a couple announcements we want to make i want to remind you sunday december the 6th we're having two services that sunday we will be having communion foot washing we will be having a thanksgiving christmas church dinner here where we'll come together and fellowship on that day i have something very special planned for that service that day where um that i'm going to be ministering on and uh i believe the lord has got something prepared for us also there is a christmas play that is planned that will be just before christmas and there's going to be a meeting right here after the service so the parents should stay for that so that you can get instructions about your children the rest of you of course can be dismissed if you don't have children that will be in the play amen amen god bless you it's been good to be in the house of the lord hadn't it amen how many can say thank you lord we can see a purpose in the trials that we go through that it's really your favor on our life that everything's gonna work together for our good amen there's nothing bad can happen to a christian amen give me the first verse i was in sin start prison oh so dark and cold [Music] said i have signed your pardon
