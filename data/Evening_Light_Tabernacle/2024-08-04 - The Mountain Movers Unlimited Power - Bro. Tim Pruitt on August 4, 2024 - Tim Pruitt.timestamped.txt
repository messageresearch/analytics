[56:29] the great outpouring of love that you
[56:32] showed to The Adams Family this week and
[56:36] um I uh you know just um um was so
[56:43] appreciative of everything that you did
[56:45] um the uh attendance you know of course
[56:50] course you know as I do that um moments
[56:53] like those are difficult they're
[56:55] difficult for the family
[56:56] they're difficult for us all but um you
[56:59] know together we we draw together and
[57:02] give support and give strength and you
[57:05] know uh you know even when they don't
[57:08] have any strength others don't have any
[57:09] strength we lend them our strength we
[57:12] surround them we encourage them we help
[57:14] them and you couldn't make me more
[57:16] prouder than what you did um uh this
[57:20] this week and uh with the outpour of
[57:23] love the meal that you provided this
[57:26] support for the family your attendance
[57:28] at the services the graveside the the
[57:31] memorial service this is very important
[57:34] um and um you you showed Christ in that
[57:38] also the outpouring of love that you
[57:40] shown from evening light Tabernacle we
[57:44] have um collected just from the church
[57:47] here about
[57:49] $25,000 to help in in their time of need
[57:54] you know um they uh
[57:56] I Converse back and forth with the
[57:59] GoFundMe uh situation of course you know
[58:02] it's better to give it directly to
[58:03] church than through GoFundMe because
[58:05] they take 3% or so and um here we they
[58:10] get it all you know just directly handed
[58:13] you can actually get a tax donation by
[58:16] writing it out to the church and and
[58:18] then we write a check out to her to to
[58:20] sister Beth and so you know um it it's a
[58:24] it works better for you as a church
[58:26] member or even some of those that are
[58:28] listening out there that want to give a
[58:30] contribution now listen you know the the
[58:34] Bible said that pure religion you know
[58:36] is actually showing support for the the
[58:40] widows and and the uh fatherless and so
[58:43] this is this is part of our our
[58:46] religious duty to help out in serious
[58:49] needs and situations like this and you
[58:53] have risen to the task and I want to
[58:55] thank you for it and express my
[58:58] appreciation now like I said about to go
[59:00] fundme I uh Converse back and forth with
[59:03] different ones and I set a goal for
[59:07] $85,000 on that and and you say well why
[59:10] brother Tim I I tell you we got about a
[59:13] we got about a $68,000 mortgage that
[59:16] I've got I I I want to see paid off and
[59:20] um you know where that that family can
[59:22] live free and clear without that worry
[59:25] and uh I believe that we can provide
[59:27] that I believe that God will provide it
[59:30] amen and so you know um I if you look
[59:34] around and just look at our building
[59:37] that we have here then I want you to
[59:39] think of the the um the youth facility
[59:43] that we have it's a beautiful facility
[59:45] for the young people I'm going to be
[59:47] meeting with them in a in a few weeks
[59:50] there and and then look behind us and
[59:52] over here we have um the the hope of
[59:56] bilon that was provided everything that
[59:59] you see on this 40 acre campus is
[1:00:02] totally paid for we've never owed a dime
[1:00:05] on it you know why that is is because
[1:00:08] God is Jehovah Gyra he is more than
[1:00:13] enough and he is able to provide now you
[1:00:17] know I did that without begging for
[1:00:20] money without um you know without taking
[1:00:24] pledges without asking you to you know
[1:00:27] somehow or another give so much a month
[1:00:30] we didn't do any of that you know God
[1:00:32] provided it put it in my hands and and
[1:00:36] and God took care of it and I I believe
[1:00:38] that God will do the same in this kind
[1:00:41] of situation right here so my faith is
[1:00:44] big and I'm looking to a big God Amen
[1:00:48] who has more than enough so I'm just um
[1:00:51] speaking that this morning amen across
[1:00:54] the the waves you know um we we got a
[1:00:58] need our brother Tony Adams he was um
[1:01:01] precious brother I remember you know him
[1:01:05] in his very early days when you know he
[1:01:08] didn't have any nickel to rub between
[1:01:10] his his fingers it all and just a single
[1:01:13] boy and just out of sin and you know
[1:01:16] still had some of the the effects of
[1:01:19] that that was lingering on and then you
[1:01:21] know he got stabilized and God gave him
[1:01:25] a wife wife and and then five children
[1:01:28] and and um now so soon he's taken from
[1:01:32] us but you know we're here and we're
[1:01:35] family and we're here to be their
[1:01:38] support and I want you to I want sister
[1:01:40] Beth to know we have your back we have
[1:01:43] you we are here for you and we love you
[1:01:46] and and the whole family and our hearts
[1:01:49] are hurting with you today as you go
[1:01:51] through this time but at the same time
[1:01:54] we realize this is part of life every
[1:01:57] person that is born into this world has
[1:01:59] got an exit from it and so there will be
[1:02:02] an exit for you one day I don't know I
[1:02:05] would hope it would be by the Rapture
[1:02:07] the change of the body that's the that's
[1:02:10] the hope for us all but until that time
[1:02:13] you know well we will see ones like this
[1:02:16] that will depart from us but anyway you
[1:02:20] know uh with that said I am going to
[1:02:23] move on to some more happy things
[1:02:26] and and more uh joyous things and even
[1:02:29] though I'm rejoicing over you know the
[1:02:32] many of the things that have God has
[1:02:34] blessed us with here because it's h
[1:02:36] absolutely the blessings of God already
[1:02:38] pouring out upon this family and our
[1:02:42] church here so but we got to you know as
[1:02:46] life changes and things goes and you
[1:02:49] know chapters turn in our life and and
[1:02:53] decisions are made
[1:02:55] there can be some very wonderful things
[1:02:58] happen and we got a couple today that I
[1:03:02] want to
[1:03:03] recognize that have decided to get
[1:03:07] married and they're going to be engaged
[1:03:10] and they are announcing their engagement

[1:03:58] it's so such a wonderful thing I think

[1:04:06] remembers that he's got a wedding plan
[1:04:08] too a marriage supper in the sky that
[1:04:12] we're all going to and this is only

[1:05:30] just pray Lord you'll watch over and
[1:05:32] protect them let them walk in the love

[1:05:40] the church family and they always do
[1:05:43] that which is right in your
[1:05:45] sight as they have made pledges to each
[1:05:48] other
[1:05:49] already and Lord these pledges are so
[1:05:53] important we don't take them fre
[1:05:56] privilously we realize their value and
[1:05:59] we ask Lord now as they look toward that

[1:06:52] together bind us to
[1:06:56] together with
[1:06:59] love amen if you'll stand with me we'll
[1:07:02] turn to St John chapter 15 and verse 7
[1:07:08] St John 15 and verse
[1:07:11] 7 these are the words of
[1:07:16] Jesus and he says if you abide in
[1:07:20] me and my words abide in you you shall
[1:07:24] ask what you will
[1:07:26] and it shall be done unto
[1:07:28] you and then let's back up a chapter to
[1:07:32] verse 12 of chapter 14 and let's read
[1:07:37] this verily verily I say unto you this
[1:07:40] is this is not a
[1:07:43] stammer he's not stuttering he's
[1:07:47] emphasizing it's surely surely or
[1:07:49] absolutely absolutely it's it's where he
[1:07:53] says the word double time he's doubling
[1:07:55] down on this
[1:07:57] promise he that believeth on me the
[1:08:01] works that I do shall he do also and
[1:08:05] Greater Works than these shall ye he do
[1:08:08] because I go to my father God bless you
[1:08:11] can be
[1:08:17] seated now today as we just look to the
[1:08:20] Lord
[1:08:21] for his anointing and his Spirit to be
[1:08:24] Upon Our Lives today
[1:08:27] and and I and I just want
[1:08:30] to I just want to be sensitive to the
[1:08:33] Holy Spirit and just kind of follow his
[1:08:35] leadership as we as we um approach this
[1:08:40] subject and look into these things you
[1:08:43] know because I don't want it to be so
[1:08:46] mechanical but I want it to be where the
[1:08:48] spirit of God is is can use us and speak
[1:08:52] through us today to
[1:08:54] you but in doing so I I want to just
[1:08:58] remind you of some of the things that we
[1:08:59] have been speaking on as we have been
[1:09:02] speaking of the mountain movers today
[1:09:05] we're going to be speaking on the
[1:09:07] unlimited
[1:09:08] power and and I want to remind you that
[1:09:12] we
[1:09:14] originally were made for
[1:09:18] Dominion but through the fall and and
[1:09:21] brother Bram told us is um and I quote
[1:09:24] this get a lot of this from the sermon
[1:09:27] the found fundamental foundation for for
[1:09:31] Faith and and in there brother Brandon
[1:09:34] would tell us that it's like the
[1:09:36] plumbing as it was in our brain or the
[1:09:40] outlet where Faith was to flow through
[1:09:44] has been clogged up and he said even
[1:09:46] even now it gets clogged up with
[1:09:49] business Affairs or with home life or
[1:09:51] domestic things or it gets clogged up
[1:09:54] even with theology or you know wrong
[1:09:58] teaching that we've had in the past or
[1:10:01] maybe as we have been going through it
[1:10:03] what the crowd is
[1:10:05] saying and and so it gets clogged up
[1:10:08] until God cannot operate through those
[1:10:11] channels that he made man for and and so
[1:10:15] we know when God made us he made us um
[1:10:19] as we are wonderfully beautifully and
[1:10:21] wonderfully made by God he made it
[1:10:24] wherever part is a part to
[1:10:26] play and whether it be your teeth or
[1:10:30] your eyes or your nose or your ears you
[1:10:33] know God has got a purpose for every
[1:10:35] part of it you know and he was he did
[1:10:38] everything in Perfection to make man
[1:10:42] where he could live and operate here
[1:10:44] upon the Earth so we know then if God
[1:10:47] would be so
[1:10:49] meticulous in how he designed the human
[1:10:52] body then we know that he would also be
[1:10:56] very meticulous in the way that he
[1:10:59] designs his body the
[1:11:02] church and so again we realize that when
[1:11:07] when he does this if he designed us uh
[1:11:10] designs his body he designed us that we
[1:11:13] can come together in a Heavenly
[1:11:17] atmosphere and have the supernatural
[1:11:19] workings of God and where that his um
[1:11:23] his his utterance such as prophecy or
[1:11:27] his wisdom which is a gift of his or his
[1:11:30] knowledge which is again the gift of
[1:11:32] knowledge the word of knowledge is is
[1:11:35] also another gift and Gifts of healing
[1:11:37] all these other gifts they are to be
[1:11:40] Outlets where God displays his power and
[1:11:44] lets out his Revelation to the church so
[1:11:48] now of course this is not one
[1:11:50] individually of course having everything
[1:11:53] but we are just cells of one body and
[1:11:57] that body is the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:12:00] the bride of Christ so now we we look
[1:12:04] and we see in Fallen man in his Fallen
[1:12:07] condition we see that operating within
[1:12:10] our being is the laws of sin and death
[1:12:14] that is um that that we are now in that
[1:12:18] realm of where our body came because of
[1:12:22] sin it came because of the fall and
[1:12:24] we're in as it was a hybrid condition
[1:12:28] because we were originally not to be
[1:12:30] brought by by sexual birth but we were
[1:12:34] to be bought by the supernatural by the
[1:12:38] spoken word of course you know when we
[1:12:41] are born again according to Peter he
[1:12:44] said you are born again not of
[1:12:46] corruptible seed but of Incorruptible
[1:12:49] seed of the word of God that liveth and
[1:12:52] abideth forever so every new birth is a
[1:12:56] birth from the spoken word of God and
[1:12:59] brother bandam tells us in spoken words
[1:13:02] Original Seed he says that you know be
[1:13:06] being that you were born of the spoken
[1:13:08] word of God you are birthed by like you
[1:13:12] should have been at the beginning so you
[1:13:16] know you bypass that and you lost that
[1:13:21] opportunity to be born from the hand of
[1:13:23] God to come through the sexual birth and
[1:13:26] to have to live here dominated by sin
[1:13:29] and and and sickness can come and rain
[1:13:32] in your body and because of that the law
[1:13:35] of Satan rules over your body and and
[1:13:38] here you come and you have heartaches
[1:13:40] and and you you know you Satan will send
[1:13:43] cancer and and your man recognize that
[1:13:47] Satan sends heartaches and we recognize
[1:13:49] it and we receive it so if Satan and by
[1:13:54] his power can make his laws work within
[1:13:57] man the law of sin and death then how
[1:14:01] much more should god with his power make
[1:14:06] the law of spirit and life work within
[1:14:09] man so you see you see if we if we can
[1:14:13] just if we can just tap in and work
[1:14:16] according to the laws of God then among
[1:14:19] his people will be recognized Divine
[1:14:23] Healing revelation power gifts
[1:14:26] manifestations of the Spirit of God now
[1:14:30] so you
[1:14:31] see again you know the law of the
[1:14:34] liberty of Christ has come to set us
[1:14:37] free from the law of sin and death now
[1:14:40] that is already taking place within your
[1:14:43] soul God has begun from the inside out
[1:14:47] and when he does he claims your body for
[1:14:49] the resurrection every person who is
[1:14:52] filled with the Holy Ghost will r eyes
[1:14:55] in the resurrection or they will if
[1:14:57] they're living they will be changed in a
[1:15:00] moment in the twinkling of an eye but
[1:15:02] we're as brother bandam said it and I
[1:15:04] want to quote this verbatim he said I
[1:15:07] believe this with all my heart I believe
[1:15:10] we're nearing the age that when people
[1:15:13] are going to recognize those things that
[1:15:15] we've had so much vain philosophy and so
[1:15:18] forth and teachings that ought not to be
[1:15:20] until it set the human mind to
[1:15:23] Revolution of thinking on matters of
[1:15:25] this and that and taking it away from
[1:15:28] the word of God and he said if we could
[1:15:30] just throw ourselves completely to God
[1:15:33] and to his will and be lost to our own
[1:15:36] thoughts and just let the mind of Christ
[1:15:40] be in us then them operations of the
[1:15:43] spirit would work just the same as
[1:15:45] Natural Things does Amen so Jesus said
[1:15:49] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:15:53] you you can ask what you will you see
[1:15:57] God and His word are
[1:16:01] inseparable amen you cannot you cannot
[1:16:04] truly have the word without having the
[1:16:07] spirit and you cannot have the spirit
[1:16:11] without having the word you see because
[1:16:14] God is the word and God is the spirit
[1:16:18] and God's spir word is spirit and Truth
[1:16:24] now so you you see you cannot have god
[1:16:27] without having his word and when you
[1:16:29] have his word you have God so I tell you
[1:16:32] if there was ever people that ought to
[1:16:34] have a lot of God it is a people whom
[1:16:37] the word has been restored
[1:16:39] to but now you can have theology without
[1:16:42] having God but if it's truly the word it
[1:16:45] will contain not just the knowledge of
[1:16:48] truth but the spirit of truth I want you
[1:16:52] to remember truth is a
[1:16:55] Spirit he said when the spirit of Truth
[1:16:58] has come he will lead you and guide you
[1:17:01] into all truth so it's called the the
[1:17:03] holy spirit is called Spirit of
[1:17:06] Truth so now again we we want to realize
[1:17:11] that when you really have the word you
[1:17:15] will receive the spirit with it now of
[1:17:18] course you know because of sin we were
[1:17:23] in our first birth we we are born we
[1:17:26] were born
[1:17:28] defeated and we were born with our our
[1:17:31] power lines clog the communication
[1:17:34] between us and God the flow of Heaven
[1:17:38] back down to earth and and so again we
[1:17:43] we come back to a place in our new birth
[1:17:46] that we realize uh a confidence in God
[1:17:51] that whatever we get what we ask for
[1:17:54] because God cannot take back his word
[1:17:57] and he has to stay with his word and but
[1:18:00] of course that is all going to be
[1:18:02] dependent upon working upon with the
[1:18:05] laws of God now again we we were made
[1:18:09] for that purpose we were made to have
[1:18:12] dominion but through the fall it was
[1:18:14] taken away from us but Redemption is
[1:18:17] brought back
[1:18:19] again now so brother bradam tells us
[1:18:23] that the only thing that hinders us as a
[1:18:26] human race today from being Superior and
[1:18:29] controlling like they did in the
[1:18:31] beginning is because the power lines of
[1:18:33] the outlet of God made in the human
[1:18:36] being has been clogged
[1:18:40] up so then he said sometimes Theology
[1:18:43] and church doctrines have clogged up
[1:18:45] your faith line clogged up your lines
[1:18:48] until you you have been taught things
[1:18:52] that those things can't be and that puts
[1:18:54] a block in the way so again it is
[1:18:57] hearing from the crowd now you know
[1:18:59] Jesus became us so that we might be
[1:19:04] conformed to his image is that right to
[1:19:07] bring many Brethren and also that we can
[1:19:11] have his
[1:19:15] mind amen I mean it's been prophesied of
[1:19:19] you that the bride will do only his will
[1:19:22] that they have the mind of Christ and
[1:19:24] they know what he wants done with his
[1:19:26] word right yes sir now you know again we
[1:19:31] know God became flesh to make all of
[1:19:34] this
[1:19:35] possible amen the word became flesh the
[1:19:38] word actually was made a human
[1:19:42] being and and there's where God became a
[1:19:46] Kinsman he he through death he came so
[1:19:50] that we could have his life he became a
[1:19:53] sinner that we might become his
[1:19:56] righteousness now let me clarify that
[1:19:58] because we know Jesus did not sin but he
[1:20:01] took on your sins amen so again he
[1:20:05] became poor that through his poverty I
[1:20:08] might become rich amen so you see he
[1:20:12] became what I was so that I might
[1:20:15] through his grace become what he is so
[1:20:19] you then you talk about the powers of
[1:20:21] God because if that's true then the
[1:20:23] power LS within the Believers now again
[1:20:28] you see the church the Gentile church
[1:20:32] was never to be a servant they are
[1:20:36] called Sons and Daughters that's what
[1:20:39] they are you know Israel was God's
[1:20:43] servants but the but here the bride of
[1:20:46] Christ is his
[1:20:49] children so you see you're we must get
[1:20:53] away from the SL slave
[1:20:56] mentality amen we were not when we're
[1:20:59] born again we were not born slaves when
[1:21:02] we born first we were born a slave to
[1:21:04] sin we were born a slave to the devil we
[1:21:09] obeyed the lust of our flesh amen but no
[1:21:13] longer are we
[1:21:15] slaves we died to that old life and
[1:21:18] we're born again new and we're no longer
[1:21:22] slaves I'm not a slave to sin
[1:21:25] I'm not a slave to his unbelief I'm not
[1:21:27] a slave to the works of the devil amen I
[1:21:31] am a child of
[1:21:34] God now so we must understand who we are
[1:21:39] and our position in
[1:21:43] Christ now I want you to look we'll just
[1:21:48] digress a moment and just say originally
[1:21:52] there was no confusion for example in
[1:21:54] the New
[1:21:55] Birth and the placing of sons in the New
[1:21:58] Testament I mean everybody knew that
[1:22:01] when you received the Holy Ghost you
[1:22:03] receive power you had adoption robe upon
[1:22:06] you you you operated as a son you had
[1:22:08] the Ring of authority you you walked out
[1:22:11] with Peter and John and said Silver and
[1:22:13] Gold Have I None but what I've got I
[1:22:15] give to you that's I have something I
[1:22:18] have
[1:22:21] dominion amen I I I'm a son I've been
[1:22:25] born a son I mean this is right after
[1:22:28] the upper room
[1:22:30] experience oh yes wasn't years and years
[1:22:33] and years and years and years of endless
[1:22:35] growth and what day I'm going to be
[1:22:40] on no
[1:22:42] sir no sir it
[1:22:44] wasn't when they were filled with the
[1:22:46] Holy Ghost they were equipped with Power
[1:22:53] Authority hey amen now the
[1:22:56] confusion only came because of the
[1:23:00] process of in which it was
[1:23:03] restored for example you know
[1:23:07] Catholicism had taken the original
[1:23:09] experience of being born again and
[1:23:11] reduced it to being saved because you
[1:23:14] were born into a Catholic
[1:23:16] Family so you're automatically you were
[1:23:18] Christian at Birth you know and from
[1:23:21] there you're baptized into the church
[1:23:23] you're born again there
[1:23:25] therefore you were a Christian you were
[1:23:27] saved and through works and Penance you
[1:23:29] work out your salvation and one day if
[1:23:32] you're good enough it'll be confirmed
[1:23:33] over in glory but right now you really
[1:23:35] don't even
[1:23:37] know what a mess the church was in and
[1:23:41] you know there was a um a a priest his
[1:23:45] name was Luther and he had access to a
[1:23:48] Bible because everybody else didn't
[1:23:51] that's right so you know there in the
[1:23:53] monastery he had actually access to a
[1:23:55] Bible that others didn't have and he
[1:23:57] happened to read in the Bible one day
[1:23:58] that the just shall live by
[1:24:01] faith and when he did you know he he
[1:24:04] realized then salvation wasn't because
[1:24:06] of works or being born but was by faith
[1:24:10] in Jesus
[1:24:12] Christ and and then I kind here it it
[1:24:15] goes along for a while you know and okay
[1:24:17] you know um and and this is everybody
[1:24:21] say okay well then you're saved when you
[1:24:23] believe you're saved when this this is
[1:24:26] the infilling of the Holy Ghost when I
[1:24:28] believed I I I I was
[1:24:30] justified and Wesley come along and read
[1:24:33] it and he concluded that forgiveness of
[1:24:37] sins was necessary and something but
[1:24:40] something had to be done about
[1:24:41] Christians living a sinful
[1:24:45] life all the while they were claiming to
[1:24:48] be
[1:24:48] forgiven and and they
[1:24:51] would yet they were still living and
[1:24:55] doing and having Vice and sin in their
[1:24:59] lives and so he come along and he taught
[1:25:02] well you not only must have
[1:25:05] forgiveness you need a sanctification be
[1:25:08] holy as I'm holy that's what God Said
[1:25:12] right so he began to preach
[1:25:15] Holiness and he began to say there's got
[1:25:18] to be a work of
[1:25:20] cleansing and this would come with with
[1:25:23] with actually
[1:25:24] a demonstration of power they would fall
[1:25:27] out under it and they would actually the
[1:25:29] old Shad methodists
[1:25:31] they they would uh revive them with a
[1:25:34] bucket of water throw it in their face
[1:25:36] and get them up and you know uh because
[1:25:39] um you know they were so overcome as
[1:25:43] that experience of sanctification where
[1:25:46] he Sanctified their lives and they were
[1:25:48] cleanse the vices and sin that had held
[1:25:51] them down then the isus of Pentecost
[1:25:54] came along and said yes righteousness is
[1:25:57] imputed through forgiveness of sins and
[1:25:59] you must surely be Sanctified from Evil
[1:26:01] and his habits but you also be must be
[1:26:04] anointed or baptized by the spirit and
[1:26:07] have its
[1:26:09] gifts and so they spoke in tongues and
[1:26:11] prophesied and they were
[1:26:14] real and it was the Holy Ghost amen it
[1:26:17] was it it was the spirit with his
[1:26:19] anointing coming in and and here they
[1:26:22] would speak in tongues and prophesy
[1:26:24] and so on but you know again again as we
[1:26:29] come down to this we want to bring it
[1:26:32] right back down to where we're at
[1:26:33] because the message comes along to bring
[1:26:36] us back to what the apostles
[1:26:41] had what was lost and the apostles had a
[1:26:45] Justified life a Sanctified life an
[1:26:47] anointed life but they were also placed
[1:26:51] with the token the literal Life of
[1:26:54] Christ Christ where you are sealed to
[1:26:56] the day of redemption and by receiving
[1:26:59] the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the
[1:27:01] Holy Ghost like the apostles had it
[1:27:04] makes us children of God and places us
[1:27:08] with full Authority as Sons amen and you
[1:27:13] tell a Son of God or a child of God
[1:27:16] something from the Bible and they'll
[1:27:17] just believe
[1:27:19] it
[1:27:23] amen but you know we're still
[1:27:27] human and we we deal with where Satan
[1:27:31] comes with his laws and our body you
[1:27:34] know accepts cancer and it accepts this
[1:27:36] and it accepts that and all kinds of
[1:27:38] other
[1:27:40] things and when we get in a
[1:27:43] crisis we often forget who we
[1:27:50] are and we will allow the crisis
[1:27:54] and the unbelief of the
[1:27:57] crowd and even things that even science
[1:28:01] will say or whatever doctors will say or
[1:28:03] whatever you know or or maybe things
[1:28:07] that somebody else did and they prayed
[1:28:09] and they failed and and we will allow it
[1:28:13] to
[1:28:15] clog the communication and the flow of
[1:28:18] the
[1:28:21] spirit now but but as sons of God you
[1:28:27] are co-equal or coair with Jesus
[1:28:32] Christ now I want you to read it in the
[1:28:34] Bible Romans 8:16 the spirit itself
[1:28:37] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:28:40] are the children of God listen when when
[1:28:42] the Holy Ghost comes upon you is God
[1:28:44] bearing witness you're his
[1:28:49] child amen now when you make a
[1:28:51] profession in Jesus Christ you're saying
[1:28:53] he's your savior but when you get the
[1:28:56] Holy Ghost he's saying you're my
[1:28:59] child you see one you're making a claim
[1:29:02] on God two it's him making a claim on
[1:29:07] you he is say this is what he did at the
[1:29:09] River Jordan he said this is my beloved
[1:29:12] Son in whom I please to
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:15] dwell right that's what happened on the
[1:29:18] River Jordan is the spirit beared
[1:29:20] witness that's my son this is the son of
[1:29:25] love and when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:29:28] you it is God bearing witness that you
[1:29:32] are his
[1:29:37] child and then so now if we are children
[1:29:41] then that gives us certain benefits then
[1:29:44] we are hires and we're Heirs of God and
[1:29:47] join airs with Christ which means we are
[1:29:51] co-equal with him
[1:29:54] amen if if so be that we suffer with him
[1:29:57] we may also be glorified
[1:30:02] together now this is what makes the
[1:30:06] devil angry that's right and this is
[1:30:08] what raises the hair on the devil and
[1:30:11] his hackles comes up and he comes and
[1:30:13] attacks and snarls and you even get it
[1:30:14] from pulpits across the world is when
[1:30:17] you start telling people who they are
[1:30:19] and who we are in Christ and what God
[1:30:21] has promised and stand for what that and
[1:30:24] declare it as
[1:30:26] true then they side with the crowd and
[1:30:29] want to Stone
[1:30:32] you but if if the Church of the Living
[1:30:35] God that has claimed to have kissed the
[1:30:37] blessings off the realm of the cup if
[1:30:40] God could just take this gospel and
[1:30:42] Shake us to the place until we realize
[1:30:44] who we are and what our rights are are
[1:30:47] God given Privileges and that's what I
[1:30:50] want to talk about this
[1:30:52] morning is to help you to remember who
[1:30:55] you are because this age deals with a
[1:30:59] horrible disease that once attack us all
[1:31:02] and it's called spiritual
[1:31:07] Amnesia
[1:31:12] right and you've never seen it even it's
[1:31:15] something in the spiritual real what
[1:31:17] you're seeing in the natural is not
[1:31:18] natural it's actually
[1:31:20] spiritual when you see boys that don't
[1:31:23] know whether they're boys and they think
[1:31:24] they're
[1:31:26] girls that's
[1:31:28] Amnesia when you see girls who want to
[1:31:31] be boys and try to think they're boys
[1:31:33] and can fight like boys and all of that
[1:31:35] that's
[1:31:37] Amnesia there's something seriously
[1:31:39] wrong and you don't understand you think
[1:31:41] it's a physical thing it's not physical
[1:31:43] at all yes it's manifested in physical
[1:31:45] but it's a spiritual
[1:31:50] problem and and let me just tell you you
[1:31:52] know we can we can take a girl dress Her
[1:31:54] Like a Lady and with long hair and and
[1:31:58] you know just dress her like a lady with
[1:32:00] a nice dress but if you don't ever get
[1:32:02] the spirit
[1:32:04] changed you still got a dominating
[1:32:06] female in a
[1:32:08] dress amen you still got masculinity and
[1:32:12] a masculine spirit in this from the
[1:32:14] spirit realm trying to take with
[1:32:17] confusion and perversion and the same
[1:32:19] thing with a man that won't take his
[1:32:21] place and his position in Christ
[1:32:24] and won to allow Christ to be the head
[1:32:27] of
[1:32:27] him amen and and so he can be the head
[1:32:31] of the home because I know you know
[1:32:33] woman you listen to what I say let let
[1:32:35] me just tell you man come under the
[1:32:37] Dominion of Christ
[1:32:45] first you know I I don't
[1:32:49] know some of you want to scream at some
[1:32:51] of these young ladies and H husband's
[1:32:54] drunk and he's a dopehead and he's a no
[1:32:57] gooder and and then tell her you got to
[1:33:00] be subject to that thing no you don't
[1:33:02] you got to be subject to
[1:33:05] [Applause]
[1:33:07] this you better listen to your head do
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:12] it amen you see because the head of the
[1:33:16] man is Christ and if Christ is in his
[1:33:19] head don't listen to him same thing with
[1:33:22] a pastor in the church go don't make any
[1:33:26] difference amen as a pastor in a church
[1:33:29] same way if his head is in Christ if
[1:33:32] he's not subject to the word don't
[1:33:34] listen to him you leave the
[1:33:36] man get
[1:33:39] out don't let your shirt tail hit your
[1:33:41] back
[1:33:45] either
[1:33:48] now so we want to understand whose sons
[1:33:52] and daughters
[1:33:54] and then how we stand before God now
[1:33:56] brother Brandon poses a question in a
[1:33:59] message called the kinsman redeemer he
[1:34:01] says who has the most power before
[1:34:04] God what is an angel an angel is a
[1:34:07] servant that's right there his servants
[1:34:10] what are you his son or
[1:34:12] daughter and who has the most power in
[1:34:14] heaven then a sinner that has been saved
[1:34:17] by grace or an archangel that's been
[1:34:20] standing by his right side the s sinner
[1:34:24] that has been saved by grace has more
[1:34:26] Authority in heaven than the Archangel
[1:34:29] that Stood Beside his by his side
[1:34:31] without sin because he's a
[1:34:34] son and a son has more Authority than
[1:34:37] the
[1:34:39] servant but we forget what we are we
[1:34:42] forget many times what we are and we
[1:34:45] forget how we got
[1:34:47] here what did God do to make us what we
[1:34:50] are we're sons and
[1:34:52] daughters and so Jesus would say all
[1:34:56] power in Heaven and Earth is given my
[1:34:59] hand and he says go and I'll go with you
[1:35:02] now I want to ask you how's he going to
[1:35:04] go with you he said it this way as the
[1:35:07] father has sent me so send I
[1:35:10] you how did the father send him the
[1:35:13] father that sent him came in him it's
[1:35:15] not me that do the work my father was
[1:35:17] dwelleth in
[1:35:19] me he's doing the
[1:35:21] work I can't do this
[1:35:24] humanly I'm doing
[1:35:26] this as a son that's right cuz my father
[1:35:30] is living in me yes are you with me now
[1:35:34] so you see again so he said he says all
[1:35:40] power in in Heaven and Earth is given to
[1:35:43] my hand go and I'll go with you whatever
[1:35:46] you bind on Earth I'll bind it in
[1:35:50] heaven and what you loose on Earth I'll
[1:35:53] loose it in
[1:35:54] heaven and he says oh if the great holy
[1:35:58] church only realizes power to do these
[1:36:00] things but there's so much doubt and
[1:36:03] fear and trembling wonder will it happen
[1:36:05] could it happen now again those are
[1:36:07] voices from the
[1:36:09] crowd now those of you that have been
[1:36:11] here in my other services you know what
[1:36:14] I'm talking about the crowd was when
[1:36:17] they were going to try to cast this
[1:36:19] devil out of this boy and the disciples
[1:36:21] couldn't do it and the and Jesus found
[1:36:24] the crowd questioning
[1:36:27] them and and so you know the the crowd
[1:36:30] will always will always question you
[1:36:34] know and and the crowd can come from
[1:36:37] well these were Jews and they should
[1:36:40] have been
[1:36:42] Believers and if anybody should have
[1:36:44] been able to beli that God could move
[1:36:47] mountains that God could heal that God
[1:36:50] would deliver that he was a God of all
[1:36:52] power it should have been am but they
[1:36:56] couldn't oh you can only do things this
[1:36:59] if you're a prophet or if you're this or
[1:37:01] you're that or when the Messiah comes or
[1:37:03] one day in the future one day when the
[1:37:05] squeeze comes one day when the third
[1:37:07] pull
[1:37:09] happens that's the
[1:37:13] crowd you said well brother Tim what
[1:37:17] about
[1:37:18] that I know people are waiting on the
[1:37:20] third
[1:37:21] pull I don't know what you're waiting
[1:37:23] waiting
[1:37:24] on the third pull was the opening of
[1:37:28] those Seven Seals the revealing of the
[1:37:32] Mysteries it is not something coming it
[1:37:36] is something that is
[1:37:40] here amen so you see the third pull of
[1:37:44] course was third phase of brother
[1:37:46] Brandon's Ministry which would be the
[1:37:47] opening of the word so I'm saying to you
[1:37:50] every promise in the book has been and
[1:37:53] open to you and handed to you as a
[1:37:57] Believer how else are you going to take
[1:37:59] a
[1:38:00] [Applause]
[1:38:03] Rapture amen so as long as there's so
[1:38:06] much fear and doubt and trembling could
[1:38:08] it happen as long as that that exists
[1:38:11] the church can never stand upright
[1:38:13] whenever talk of fear is vanished oh God
[1:38:16] help my tongue and the Holy Spirit is
[1:38:19] completely in control of the church then
[1:38:21] all fears are gone and the church has
[1:38:24] that power why they have everything that
[1:38:27] heaven owns behind them they are
[1:38:29] ambassadors of the throne an ambassador
[1:38:33] of Christ has the authority and anything
[1:38:35] that Christ owns belongs to that
[1:38:37] Ambassador and he said go into all the
[1:38:39] world you are my witnesses that the Holy
[1:38:42] Ghost has come upon you and what is a
[1:38:44] witness it is an ambassador is to come
[1:38:47] and witness something the whole powers
[1:38:49] of Heaven is right in your hands oh why
[1:38:52] do we say
[1:38:54] and the church is Barren and we set
[1:38:58] dormant because we don't recognize these
[1:39:03] things so what God's wanting to do is
[1:39:06] wake you out of spiritual
[1:39:09] Amnesia it ain't that you're not who you
[1:39:13] are it's because of Amnesia you forgot
[1:39:17] who you
[1:39:18] are you don't realize what God sent you
[1:39:22] here to
[1:39:24] do the works that I do shall you do
[1:39:30] also so Ephesians 1 will tell us that we
[1:39:34] are seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:39:37] Jesus we're
[1:39:38] enthroned with him to rule with Christ
[1:39:41] with all things under our
[1:39:44] feet amen and the message of Grace has
[1:39:48] been to restore a fallen man back to his
[1:39:51] original position
[1:39:53] in in so much that we will actually be
[1:39:58] the people in this last days will be
[1:40:00] standing on their feet and be changed in
[1:40:03] a moment in the twinkling of an
[1:40:05] eye now in Ephesians 1 Paul says this to
[1:40:09] the Believers to the ones that are in
[1:40:11] Christ Jesus and I want to remind you
[1:40:14] this message is the adoption message it
[1:40:18] is sent to us by Malachi for to rest
[1:40:23] store us back to our original position
[1:40:26] in
[1:40:27] Christ and brother bradam looked from
[1:40:30] you know for for example brother Bram
[1:40:33] looked over in a meeting he was just in
[1:40:36] and he looked over where the night
[1:40:37] before there had been a whole row of
[1:40:41] wheelchairs and and in that in that
[1:40:44] meeting um there was he he would come
[1:40:48] the next day and he' look and there was
[1:40:50] only one or two left in there and we
[1:40:53] don't know if them were new arrivals or
[1:40:56] what but he says if he said I'm so
[1:41:00] thankful that whole row of wheelchairs
[1:41:03] there there's only two or three left in
[1:41:05] here if every believer knew their
[1:41:09] place lady on the cart man on the
[1:41:11] crutches there there wouldn't be a
[1:41:14] feeble person in this building in the
[1:41:16] next 20
[1:41:18] minutes that's right if every per man
[1:41:21] could simply find his place are her
[1:41:24] place in Christ Jesus what a difference
[1:41:26] it would make amen now he said I know
[1:41:28] you I feel your mind rolling fast
[1:41:31] brother brandom now I I know where I'm
[1:41:34] at he said you think you do that's it if
[1:41:38] you did it would be
[1:41:44] different
[1:41:45] now we must know the power that is
[1:41:49] available to us through Redemption
[1:41:53] when the disciples were confronted by
[1:41:55] that demon that they couldn't cast out
[1:41:57] they wanted to know
[1:42:01] why right and the disciples had the
[1:42:04] power they had the word the word had
[1:42:07] given them power Jesus the word made
[1:42:11] flesh had sent them out as said cast out
[1:42:15] Devils amen heal the sick that's right
[1:42:20] amen he he had given them the command
[1:42:22] and and the word was there he'd given
[1:42:25] the power but they were lacking the
[1:42:28] faith to operate the power they had and
[1:42:31] the question Jesus why couldn't we do it
[1:42:34] and why couldn't they because they had
[1:42:37] listened to the crowd and their faith
[1:42:40] had turned from Faith to unbelief you
[1:42:43] know if if I can explain something about
[1:42:45] that just for a minute you know unbelief
[1:42:46] is actually
[1:42:49] faith is Faith aimed in the wrong
[1:42:51] direction
[1:42:57] you know if you're an atheist and you
[1:42:59] believe that everything come from a
[1:43:02] chemical reaction out there and there's
[1:43:04] no God there's a that unbelief requires
[1:43:07] a lot of
[1:43:13] faith it's Faith turned in the wrong
[1:43:16] direction in fact of the matter atheism
[1:43:19] is a religion
[1:43:23] amen it's a worship of man a worship of
[1:43:25] self and a worship of nothingness out of
[1:43:29] which nothing
[1:43:32] came so you know when when we're coming
[1:43:35] back around to this you remember even
[1:43:37] Malachi 4 is kind of like a magnet you
[1:43:39] know you got a two poles within
[1:43:42] you a magnet has the negative and the
[1:43:46] positive and one pulls and one
[1:43:49] pushes and so when when you were a
[1:43:52] sinner
[1:43:53] you were born with the pole being
[1:43:56] negative toward God and pushing him
[1:43:59] away and you were drawn to the world and
[1:44:02] sin and to the
[1:44:04] devil but Redemption comes and even
[1:44:06] Malachi for comes to turn the heart back
[1:44:10] to Faith again so he he he listen what
[1:44:13] he does he turns that faith that you had
[1:44:18] come on and answered in the right
[1:44:20] direction where now you believe God and
[1:44:23] you believe his word and you believe
[1:44:25] it's true and you reject the devil's lie
[1:44:29] and you know what happened in your life
[1:44:32] amen once you were pulled to the world
[1:44:34] and pulled to sin and you resisted God
[1:44:37] and God turned your heart and now you're
[1:44:39] pulled toward God and pulled toward his
[1:44:41] word pulled toward Bel and you resist
[1:44:44] the devil and he's got to plee from
[1:44:51] you oh yeah
[1:44:56] amen now if you sat down on me for the
[1:44:58] rest of the service you at least got
[1:45:01] that but there's
[1:45:03] more there's
[1:45:06] more
[1:45:07] now they had the word the disciples did
[1:45:12] the word was flesh
[1:45:14] then and the word told them I give you
[1:45:17] power and they had the power but they
[1:45:20] didn't have the faith to operate the
[1:45:21] power now
[1:45:24] apparently before they had had it
[1:45:27] because Jesus had even said I witness
[1:45:29] Satan fall like like lightning from
[1:45:34] Heaven I I I wish I witnessed the power
[1:45:38] at work and that made Satan fall but now
[1:45:41] they face a demon which is in this
[1:45:44] epileptic child and they can't cast it
[1:45:46] out because the crowd is
[1:45:50] questioning and now it just will and
[1:45:53] down they go and like I said we got a
[1:45:56] crowd of unbelief in this
[1:45:59] world coming from every direction
[1:46:01] yelling screaming from the crowd you
[1:46:09] can't they can't believe in prophets
[1:46:11] they can't believe in
[1:46:13] prophecies and those that can believe in
[1:46:15] a prophet and prophecies can't believe
[1:46:17] that God speaks now
[1:46:23] they denied all the gifts until the
[1:46:25] point they don't even believe in the
[1:46:26] fivefold ministry
[1:46:30] gifts Satan has effectively did what he
[1:46:33] could to put God in a box and make him
[1:46:35] yesterday and not
[1:46:38] today but you see if you are born again
[1:46:42] Faith was born into you and faith is a
[1:46:46] characteristics of a Believer uh the
[1:46:48] word gives you power and but faith is a
[1:46:51] channel through which the word does its
[1:46:55] work so brother bandam would teach us in
[1:46:58] the message perfect faith that Jesus had
[1:47:01] Faith with his power and he says I can
[1:47:04] do nothing in myself now we all realize
[1:47:07] that
[1:47:08] humanly when I pray for somebody I I
[1:47:11] can't help
[1:47:14] them you know it reminds me of U Jack Co
[1:47:18] who got some inspiration from Brother
[1:47:19] brandham we've talked about it before
[1:47:22] and he got inspiration and started
[1:47:23] believing in Divine Healing he was a
[1:47:25] skeptic at first brother Bram called him
[1:47:27] a convert to Divine
[1:47:30] Healing and he and Ja Jack Cole had a
[1:47:33] had a guy that was just hideously
[1:47:36] crippled and he was just malformed I
[1:47:39] don't know I I didn't see it but I mean
[1:47:41] from what his testimony was he was
[1:47:43] really malformed and it just looked like
[1:47:45] an impossible
[1:47:47] situation and Jack Cole looked at this
[1:47:50] man as he you know hideously dis
[1:47:54] deformed and coming toward him in the
[1:47:56] prayer line and he said man
[1:48:01] I I've seen God do a lot of things I
[1:48:03] don't know if I got the faith for that
[1:48:05] that's what he's he's battling you know
[1:48:07] in his mind when that guy gets up to his
[1:48:10] turn he said you go back to the end of
[1:48:13] the
[1:48:16] line so guy works his way back to the to
[1:48:20] the front again he sends him back again
[1:48:23] go go back to the end of the
[1:48:28] line does it again go back to end of the
[1:48:30] line finally there wasn't no end of the
[1:48:32] line he was the end of the line there
[1:48:35] was all you know everybody had been
[1:48:36] prayed for but him he stands up there
[1:48:39] and he said God I don't know what to do
[1:48:41] I don't know if I have faith for this
[1:48:44] and the spirit of God spoke to him
[1:48:48] says
[1:48:50] Jack I'm the Healer not
[1:48:58] you we got to remember there's more than
[1:49:01] just
[1:49:04] humans amen we are vessels filled with
[1:49:08] deity the spirit of God is in us and we
[1:49:12] are commissioned by a word to do a work
[1:49:23] uh so Jesus had Faith with his power he
[1:49:26] real realized he relied he said on what
[1:49:31] he
[1:49:32] was notice he relied in knowing that he
[1:49:36] was the word
[1:49:41] amen and he had faith in God who made
[1:49:43] him the word he was God the word and the
[1:49:45] Word was in him and that gave him Faith
[1:49:47] because he understood his position well
[1:49:49] brother Tim if if I was if I was born
[1:49:53] sinless like
[1:49:54] Jesus shut your
[1:49:57] mouth you
[1:49:59] were and your New
[1:50:04] Birth come
[1:50:06] on Amen who are you identifying with
[1:50:10] that old man that was buried in water
[1:50:12] and baptism and you raised up in newness
[1:50:15] of Life are you identifying with that
[1:50:17] don't identify with that identify I am a
[1:50:21] new creature
[1:50:23] in Christ Jesus all things have passed
[1:50:26] away and behold all things are
[1:50:28] [Applause]
[1:50:36] new
[1:50:38] well Jesus said glorify me Lord with the
[1:50:41] glory that I had with thee before the
[1:50:42] world
[1:50:43] began see Jesus knew he was God he knew
[1:50:47] he was always God he you know he was
[1:50:49] born knowing he was God and you know I
[1:50:52] I'm not that way I I'm I was born a
[1:50:55] human and
[1:50:57] and I'm not that way let me explain
[1:51:00] something about
[1:51:02] Jesus the Bible tells you in his
[1:51:07] humiliation that he put aside his
[1:51:11] godship to become human yes
[1:51:16] sir so Jesus as a man could not re
[1:51:21] remember what he
[1:51:26] was because like us it's veiled to
[1:51:31] us but what he did was believed what the
[1:51:34] word said about
[1:51:37] [Applause]
[1:51:38] him just like you have to
[1:51:42] do well if I do you know when you're
[1:51:46] born again I was chosen and him before
[1:51:49] the foundation of the world
[1:51:54] I came from God and I'm going back to
[1:51:58] [Applause]
[1:52:02] God you
[1:52:06] know Jesus talks about the Holy Ghost is
[1:52:09] something you know and that day you will
[1:52:11] know I'm in the Father the father me and
[1:52:14] I in
[1:52:18] you so you see what did it gave him his
[1:52:22] position this is why you've got to read
[1:52:24] the word you've got to read what God
[1:52:28] said about you not what the crowd is
[1:52:32] saying that's right not what your past
[1:52:36] says that old man is
[1:52:40] dead you're born a
[1:52:44] new now that gave him Faith cuz he
[1:52:47] understood his position he knew what he
[1:52:50] was and I want you get
[1:52:54] he knew what he was because the
[1:52:58] scripture had said he was
[1:53:02] this what do you think that I go back
[1:53:04] into the scripture over and over and
[1:53:06] over again and and remind you of the
[1:53:10] prophecies in the word of God that
[1:53:13] they're not just stories in the Bible
[1:53:14] but they're prophesying of you Jesus
[1:53:17] would do the same he said as Jonas was
[1:53:20] in the belly of the whale three days and
[1:53:21] night so the son of man be in the heart
[1:53:23] of the earth what was he doing he looked
[1:53:26] in the word and he
[1:53:29] saw his
[1:53:31] position and he saw that his Jonah was
[1:53:34] in the belly of the Well in that dark
[1:53:36] valy belly of death so will I go down
[1:53:39] into death but I'm going to rise out of
[1:53:43] [Applause]
[1:53:45] it amen that's why we ought to be able
[1:53:48] to look at the word and we can see Enoch
[1:53:50] the seventh from Adam and here we are
[1:53:53] the seven age from the second Adam and
[1:53:55] here we are in the last day of people
[1:53:57] walking with God hallelujah while the
[1:54:01] rest of the world is going on and
[1:54:03] groping in sin and darkness we're
[1:54:05] walking with God and one day we're going
[1:54:07] to take our final step into a
[1:54:13] theophany Hallelujah because we are
[1:54:17] Enoch and because Enoch
[1:54:20] prophesied of the coming of the Lord
[1:54:23] [Applause]
[1:54:24] and we're here in his coming and he
[1:54:26] prophesied of
[1:54:29] us
[1:54:31] hallelujah amen Jesus knew he was he
[1:54:35] understood his position because the
[1:54:37] scripture said it was
[1:54:42] this he said in three days I'll
[1:54:46] rise how does he know cuz he says David
[1:54:50] said I'll not leave his soul in hell
[1:54:52] that's the grave neither will I let my
[1:54:55] Holy One see
[1:54:57] corruption amen come on so he knew
[1:55:01] corruption comes in 70 72 hours so he
[1:55:04] says three days I'll
[1:55:07] rise cuz it's prophesy to me oh David
[1:55:10] that was set of David David said that
[1:55:12] that was set of David he realized that
[1:55:15] David he was
[1:55:19] prophesying Hallelujah Abraham was Pro
[1:55:23] prophesying Sarah was prophesying of a
[1:55:26] Barren 2,000 year old church that's
[1:55:29] going to bring back the promised son
[1:55:35] prophesying the scripture has
[1:55:41] spoken he knew what it was cuz the
[1:55:43] scripture said he was this and every
[1:55:45] scripture tied in to prove that he was
[1:55:48] exactly what the scriptures said he
[1:55:50] would be and he knew what he
[1:55:53] was
[1:55:55] therefore he relied upon what God had
[1:55:58] made
[1:56:00] him and if he did that then can't we
[1:56:03] rely upon what God made us as
[1:56:06] Believers these signs shall follow them
[1:56:09] that
[1:56:11] believe he had faith in what he was and
[1:56:13] if you're a Believer you have faith in
[1:56:16] what you
[1:56:18] are you are a believer
[1:56:22] yes amen reminds me when my wife had her
[1:56:26] first brain bleeding she was in the
[1:56:28] hospital my children family gathered
[1:56:31] together in the the the waiting room
[1:56:33] there we couldn't go into ICU room where
[1:56:37] she was out and we gathered there and I
[1:56:39] could look and see upon the face of my
[1:56:41] children the concern they had for their
[1:56:46] mother and when they did you know I
[1:56:49] looked upon them and I said you know
[1:56:51] this is not a time to Fe here this is a
[1:56:54] time to
[1:56:57] believe this is a time to believe I said
[1:57:00] we are believers I said like brother
[1:57:03] John leay and I use him for an example
[1:57:06] there I said you know brother John he's
[1:57:09] a
[1:57:11] Minnesotan so I you know I went through
[1:57:14] him around house about different things
[1:57:17] can can we can can can you do this or
[1:57:21] can you do that can you fix this can you
[1:57:23] repair that oh yeah yeah that's what we
[1:57:31] do that's what we
[1:57:33] do you see he that's what he does and I
[1:57:37] said and we're
[1:57:39] Believers in moments like this we
[1:57:42] believe cuz we're Believers and that's
[1:57:44] what we
[1:57:46] do and when I said that out of my mouth
[1:57:49] came and she will be in the icy room
[1:57:53] tonight and tomorrow she'll be in her
[1:57:55] own bed here in this hospital and then
[1:57:57] the next night she'll be at
[1:58:00] home and God gave us six more years to
[1:58:04] spend
[1:58:05] [Applause]
[1:58:07] together but that's what happens when we
[1:58:13] believe God would have took her then oh
[1:58:16] yeah but you see like
[1:58:18] Hezekiah he asked God for some more time
[1:58:22] amen sometimes God will take you he you
[1:58:25] know your time's up he don't give an
[1:58:27] extra
[1:58:29] day so that's why you always have to be
[1:58:33] ready love where you can love care where
[1:58:36] you
[1:58:37] care hold on to what you
[1:58:40] got if you're a Believer you have faith
[1:58:42] in what you are you are a Believer and
[1:58:45] and if you got faith in God then the
[1:58:47] Bible says this in 1 John 3:21 if our
[1:58:51] hearts can Dem
[1:58:53] us then we can't have faith or or you
[1:58:56] know if our hearts condemn us you know
[1:58:59] we can't have confidence with God and he
[1:59:02] said so he said if our heart's condemn
[1:59:04] us not then we have confidence toward
[1:59:07] God so you cannot get anything when you
[1:59:10] got sin in your life that's condemning
[1:59:12] you it clogs the
[1:59:16] flow so you go and you get that settled
[1:59:19] first that's right amen it's okay settle
[1:59:23] it then come back and believe why did
[1:59:26] Brother brandom tell them that we're
[1:59:28] harlots and and whatever else
[1:59:30] that came into his prayer line and they
[1:59:32] were Sinners
[1:59:35] repent and you can
[1:59:39] receive amen I mean you know well you
[1:59:43] got to have many many many years of
[1:59:46] works and whatever and prove yourself
[1:59:48] good and worthy and it ain't on your
[1:59:50] worthiness or your goodness is on what
[1:59:51] God
[1:59:54] said so if our hearts condemn us not
[1:59:57] then we have confidence toward God that
[2:00:00] he hears us so as long as we're doing
[2:00:02] things wrong you can't have confidence
[2:00:04] with God you actually put yourself back
[2:00:06] as a sinner that's right that's right
[2:00:09] you see but when your heart don't
[2:00:11] condemn you and you know you're a
[2:00:13] Believer and there's nothing between you
[2:00:14] and God you can just ask what you will
[2:00:16] and it and know it'll be done because
[2:00:19] the word's given to you just like it was
[2:00:20] to the disciples
[2:00:23] amen now the only thing you have to do
[2:00:28] according to the prophet is have faith
[2:00:30] in what you are have faith in what the
[2:00:32] word says you
[2:00:34] are so we're just going to look at that
[2:00:37] just for a few minutes here and and and
[2:00:41] um and and just realize what did the
[2:00:45] word say let's just go over some of the
[2:00:47] things from the
[2:00:49] Bible and and he tells you
[2:00:52] that therefore If any man is in Christ
[2:00:57] he is a new creation the old has passed
[2:01:01] away and behold the new Has Come All
[2:01:05] Things Have Become new so he says old
[2:01:08] has passed away the new has come that
[2:01:10] new creation it means something just
[2:01:16] made uh which is uncommon or new or
[2:01:19] unheard of
[2:01:22] you see we're not cleaned out and
[2:01:23] covered over we are brand
[2:01:26] new we're a new
[2:01:33] species you know the devil had never
[2:01:37] seen anything like
[2:01:41] Jesus I mean every one of them even they
[2:01:45] all had to testify behold this is the
[2:01:47] Son of God devil had never seen a man
[2:01:50] like Jesus that's right
[2:01:52] when he when he stuck his finger into
[2:01:54] him and he pulled it out went down into
[2:01:56] hell and conquered death hell in the
[2:01:58] grave and Rose
[2:02:00] up he had never seen a human being ever
[2:02:05] rise above death that's
[2:02:09] right he had never seen a species like
[2:02:12] this that no matter which way he tempted
[2:02:15] him he stayed with the
[2:02:18] word this was a brand new SP
[2:02:22] species but on the day of Pentecost that
[2:02:25] new species gave birth to 120 in the
[2:02:29] upper room and out of the upper room
[2:02:31] came 120
[2:02:35] Jesus sons of God filled with the spirit
[2:02:39] of God come on somebody and when they
[2:02:42] were filled with the spirit of God they
[2:02:44] would speaking Heaven's
[2:02:46] language amen Supernatural was taking
[2:02:49] place amen it gave Satan had never seen
[2:02:53] anybody here he thought he'd run him
[2:02:55] away there he was in glory he had went
[2:02:57] away but now he's back on Earth in
[2:03:01] 120 filled with the same Spirit of Jesus
[2:03:04] Amen the same power of Jesus the Same
[2:03:07] Authority is
[2:03:11] Jesus
[2:03:13] Hallelujah and what do you believe about
[2:03:15] the coming of the Lord in this day and I
[2:03:18] saw another Mighty Angel come down from
[2:03:21] heaven
[2:03:23] amen I believe there's a new species on
[2:03:26] the earth that's are the same species
[2:03:29] that Jesus Christ was and there are
[2:03:31] people the devil don't know what to do
[2:03:35] with
[2:03:38] Hallelujah they'll be tempted by
[2:03:40] everything in the Satan's eating that
[2:03:42] will overcome I say they will overcome
[2:03:45] cuz the Bible said they would that him
[2:03:48] that overcometh will I practice it with
[2:03:51] me in my
[2:03:53] Throne he couldn't say that unless
[2:03:55] somebody would overcome and fact the
[2:03:58] very word release creates you into
[2:04:03] being you are the very creation of the
[2:04:05] word of
[2:04:07] God that's right the word being made
[2:04:12] flesh in bright
[2:04:15] form God taken men and women who were
[2:04:20] slaves of the devil
[2:04:23] setting them
[2:04:24] free and now their hands which once
[2:04:28] served the devil serve God their mouth
[2:04:32] that once spoke lies now speak only
[2:04:37] truth their feet that was quick to shed
[2:04:40] blood is now obedient to the
[2:04:43] word
[2:04:46] flesh you Lord
[2:04:53] Ephesians
[2:04:55] 4:24 for we are his
[2:05:00] workmanship I can't say it enough God
[2:05:03] didn't make any
[2:05:07] junk he's not a bad
[2:05:09] Craftsman when he made you he made you
[2:05:12] perfect
[2:05:15] that's amen as far as God concerned it's
[2:05:18] over
[2:05:20] with right right right amen he already
[2:05:23] listen he has already seen you in
[2:05:30] Perfection it's like brother brandham
[2:05:32] would declar somebody healed cuz he saw
[2:05:35] in the
[2:05:38] future like you know like Bill da he
[2:05:41] said Bill da he said You know here he's
[2:05:43] dying 90 year old he's under oxygen tent
[2:05:45] for I don't know how many days and he's
[2:05:47] dying and and they've given him up and
[2:05:49] he gets there
[2:05:52] and as he's talking to him praying a
[2:05:54] vision breaks he said build
[2:05:57] out I will shake your hand again in the
[2:06:02] front of the blue Bo
[2:06:07] Restaurant you're
[2:06:10] healed I don't know it might have been
[2:06:12] one day two days three days four days 5
[2:06:15] days before he come out from under that
[2:06:17] oxygen tent but it was already
[2:06:20] done and God has already seen a people
[2:06:23] in a Rapture he said I'll have a bride
[2:06:25] and she will be without spot or without
[2:06:27] Reco or without a blemish and he can't
[2:06:30] go back on his word I don't care how
[2:06:32] many false docum have I don't care how
[2:06:34] much evil there is I don't care how much
[2:06:35] wickedness in the world God would have a
[2:06:38] bride without SP without a wrinkle
[2:06:40] without a bleming a woman of faith
[2:06:54] let's just
[2:06:56] go Ephesians 4:24 it says we're created
[2:07:00] after the likeness of God and true
[2:07:02] righteousness and
[2:07:04] Holiness so we're
[2:07:06] created after the likeness of God
[2:07:09] remember we were first to come by
[2:07:12] creation that's why that's the way sons
[2:07:15] of God are
[2:07:16] born they would become straight from the
[2:07:19] hand of God by the spoken word amen
[2:07:22] but because of the Fall we come through
[2:07:24] sex and because we come into the sexual
[2:07:26] birth we're born in in Incorruptible
[2:07:34] bodies so well brother Tim you got all
[2:07:37] this power why don't you just call it
[2:07:38] all to an end can't till the last name
[2:07:41] comes on the
[2:07:44] book what if it happened somebody called
[2:07:47] to an
[2:07:48] end 500 years ago you wouldn't be here
[2:07:51] here your granddaddy great granddaddy
[2:07:54] nobody God has a purpose he has a plan
[2:07:57] and since all of us have to come this
[2:07:59] way he's got to wait until every name
[2:08:02] that's on the book I know man gets
[2:08:04] impatient wants to close the book and
[2:08:06] wants to wants to say Mercy's
[2:08:09] over I don't know who when God died and
[2:08:12] left you in
[2:08:13] charge but Mercy isn't
[2:08:16] over Mercy will not be over until the
[2:08:20] last pred destinated seed whose names
[2:08:23] are in the book are manifested on the
[2:08:28] Earth right so here we
[2:08:32] are and we are his we are created after
[2:08:36] the likeness of God and true
[2:08:37] righteousness and Holiness in Ephesians
[2:08:40] 2:10 we are his
[2:08:43] workmanship created in Christ Jesus for
[2:08:47] good
[2:08:48] works amen which God prepared beforehand
[2:08:53] that we should walk in
[2:08:55] them amen so God prepared it and we're
[2:09:00] going to walk in
[2:09:04] it now look maybe you're not all
[2:09:09] there but just keep
[2:09:14] walking amen you're going to walk in
[2:09:16] true righteousness and pure Holiness
[2:09:19] you're going to do the good works
[2:09:22] you have been created in Christ Jesus as
[2:09:26] the Bible said in 1 Peter 2 and9 you are
[2:09:29] a chosen
[2:09:32] Offspring that's a chosen race a royal
[2:09:36] priesthood you got a right to go before
[2:09:38] the throne of grace you are a priest
[2:09:40] nobody's got to intercede between you
[2:09:42] and
[2:09:45] Goden you are a holy nation you are
[2:09:48] people for his own possession that's
[2:09:51] what it means peculiar you are people
[2:09:53] for his own
[2:09:56] possession I created you for my purpose
[2:10:01] yes the devil had you but I took you I
[2:10:06] redeemed you I washed you I cleansed you
[2:10:08] I remade you I mean you're really not
[2:10:11] something made over you you are a new
[2:10:13] creature and in all of this you are my
[2:10:17] possession I did this for my own
[2:10:19] possession
[2:10:21] cuz you're bone of my bone Flesh of My
[2:10:23] Flesh and life of my life and spirit of
[2:10:24] my spirit and all that I am you
[2:10:28] are in fact Ephesians 1:4 said even as
[2:10:32] he chose us in him before the foundation
[2:10:36] of the
[2:10:39] world now you think you've done
[2:10:41] something that you can keep God from
[2:10:43] loving you before you ever did it he
[2:10:46] chose
[2:10:47] [Applause]
[2:10:50] you somebody ought to
[2:10:52] shout before you ever S one sin he knew
[2:10:56] what you would do he knew the kind of
[2:10:58] life but he chose you in him before the
[2:11:02] foundation of the
[2:11:06] world Hallelujah he did not choose you
[2:11:10] because you were holy you were not
[2:11:14] holy but he chose you to be
[2:11:18] holy what you couldn't do on your own he
[2:11:22] chose you to become
[2:11:26] that you are not

[2:13:34] prophet in the name of a prophet will
[2:13:36] receive a prophet's
[2:13:38] reward and brother Brandon was asked the
[2:13:40] question what is a prophet's reward he

[2:17:27] of God this morning to you Amen to the
[2:17:30] world is not given but to you it has
[2:17:33] been know made known the mysteries of
[2:17:34] the kingdom of God hallelujah you've
[2:17:37] been made privy because why you're his
[2:17:40] lover his sweetheart and he's pulling
[2:17:43] her you up to him and has whispered to
[2:17:45] you the L secrets
[2:17:51] what I've been doing it come down
[2:17:52] through Seven Ages there were others in
[2:17:54] the book who was not there at Pentecost
[2:17:56] I had to I had to sit on the throne and
[2:17:58] intercede and I've been interceding for
[2:18:00] Seven Ages until the last one but now
[2:18:03] we're in the last age and I'm releasing
[2:18:05] The Secret of My coming and I'm pouring
[2:18:08] out my spirit and there's a mighty Angel
[2:18:11] and empowerment that's coming to empower
[2:18:13] bride in this last
[2:18:15] [Applause]
[2:18:19] day no longer do I call you
[2:18:22] servants for the servant does not know
[2:18:25] what his master is doing but I have
[2:18:26] called you
[2:18:30] friends for all that I've heard of my
[2:18:33] father I've made known to
[2:18:36] you and when he went
[2:18:39] back to being God
[2:18:41] again leaving manhood
[2:18:45] man manship going back into godship he
[2:18:49] comes to to John on the aisle of patmas
[2:18:54] and he reveals the
[2:18:56] coming what will happen in the end time
[2:18:59] that's why the Book of Revelation is a
[2:19:01] special book in this last day because
[2:19:04] it's the
[2:19:07] unveiling the
[2:19:10] Apocalypto the making known the
[2:19:14] manifestation of all the end time
[2:19:18] events and so we are because we're
[2:19:21] friends we are we are join hirs
[2:19:24] therefore we have a part in
[2:19:28] this now Jesus stood there with Mary and
[2:19:31] Martha and he he said take away the
[2:19:36] stone why he was God he could have
[2:19:39] spoken into Oblivion say St be no more
[2:19:42] that's right the power was there but
[2:19:45] they had to do
[2:19:47] something it was a part they had to play
[2:19:51] you know he would look upon the Harvest
[2:19:53] and he' say and and he's the lord of the
[2:19:55] Harvest and he says to the disciples
[2:19:57] pray the Lord of the Harvest that he'll
[2:19:59] send labors into his harvest in other
[2:20:02] words you ask me to do what I'm going to
[2:20:08] do I'm going to do this but you got to
[2:20:10] ask me to you know why because it's
[2:20:13] going to be through your prayers through
[2:20:15] your intercession through your working
[2:20:18] that that that will actually be The
[2:20:21] Works will be done through you so you
[2:20:24] ask me you intercede you call Heaven
[2:20:29] down you've got something to
[2:20:33] do amen and brother Brandon says we're
[2:20:37] buddies talk about us and God we're
[2:20:42] buddies it's a church we got something
[2:20:45] to do ourselves he said here's the
[2:20:47] gospel I know it but if you just sit
[2:20:49] there and Don't Preach it what good is
[2:20:51] it going to do you got to do something
[2:20:53] you got to make an effort you say well I
[2:20:56] believe God can heal but I just don't
[2:20:58] know stand up and let that word become
[2:21:01] your word believe it don't reason it
[2:21:03] just believe it
[2:21:06] amen so you see again uh when we pray we
[2:21:11] got to
[2:21:13] understand you know that we have to
[2:21:15] leave the realm of human
[2:21:19] thinking and in into the
[2:21:23] spirit because Jesus said if you ask the
[2:21:27] father anything in my name I will do it
[2:21:30] and brother brandom said you realize
[2:21:32] what that means do you realize if we go
[2:21:35] before God In The Name of Jesus it's
[2:21:38] just the same as Jesus himself praying
[2:21:41] that's
[2:21:42] right isn't me praying anymore if I come
[2:21:45] in his name and he recognizes his name
[2:21:47] and Jesus said whatever you ask the
[2:21:48] father in my name that I do
[2:21:51] then I go to the father in jesus' name
[2:21:53] it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus
[2:21:57] it's his Spirit praying through
[2:22:00] me and then I got to receive what I
[2:22:02] asked for because he said it and it's
[2:22:05] God's Own word it can't do nothing else
[2:22:07] but produce
[2:22:10] it
[2:22:12] hallelujah amen so you know and I'm
[2:22:17] going to get into it but we're already
[2:22:19] out of time
[2:22:24] yep you don't realize we've been here
[2:22:27] for an hour and a half that I've
[2:22:29] been with
[2:22:31] everything that's but I want you just to
[2:22:34] stop a minute for a moment let's just
[2:22:37] focus just for a
[2:22:39] minute because we're going to discover
[2:22:43] as a minister on
[2:22:45] this cuz I know the question comes
[2:22:49] in just like it did with
[2:22:55] laus if he could Open the Eyes of the
[2:22:59] blind if he could make the lames to
[2:23:04] walk couldn't he have caused Lazarus not
[2:23:08] to
[2:23:10] die that was their question that was the
[2:23:16] crowd they looked and said if if if he
[2:23:20] could do that if that was really real
[2:23:22] then why did he let Lazarus
[2:23:27] die and that's the question comes back
[2:23:30] around to us today after we've even
[2:23:33] received
[2:23:34] loss and we say well if we could ask
[2:23:38] anything in his name and he'll do it why
[2:23:41] is there still death and
[2:23:44] dying and this is what we're going to
[2:23:47] understand about the laws of God
[2:23:50] and really realizing that you can't go
[2:23:53] beyond his
[2:23:57] laws and the law of God says the day you
[2:24:00] eat thereof that day you die so there's
[2:24:02] still going to be dying and
[2:24:04] death
[2:24:06] until the end is called when is that
[2:24:09] going to be when the last name on the
[2:24:11] book is manifested on the earth and
[2:24:15] until then we're going to have people
[2:24:17] get
[2:24:18] sick and some will go by the way of the
[2:24:22] Grave well if you can do anything listen
[2:24:26] again we work according to the law of
[2:24:31] God and the law of God is the will of
[2:24:35] God and as I've explained God has a set
[2:24:38] time for every one of us he and and we
[2:24:42] realize we can't live here forever he's
[2:24:45] ordained it so he's got a graduation for
[2:24:48] every one of us that's right amen he's
[2:24:51] going to take us out of this body of
[2:24:53] Flesh and he's going to move us into the
[2:24:56] Heavenly realm or one day he's going to
[2:24:58] bring the Heavenly realm here and take
[2:24:59] us out of here and we'll meet him in the
[2:25:02] air come on but we work according to the
[2:25:06] law and the will of God right why didn't
[2:25:09] Jesus when he said La has come forth
[2:25:11] just scream out come forth and all the
[2:25:13] dead raised it couldn't happen till his
[2:25:16] death burial and
[2:25:18] Resurrection he had to pay for the sins
[2:25:20] of the Old Testament Saints to be able
[2:25:23] to raise them all and bring them from
[2:25:26] Paradise and into new bodies and so the
[2:25:29] law of God's Own word kept him from
[2:25:33] doing
[2:25:35] so but the laws of God's Own word even
[2:25:38] would keep things from happening to
[2:25:40] Jesus for
[2:25:42] example that
[2:25:44] day the
[2:25:47] crucifixion we're going to hurry this up
[2:25:49] boys the Passover it's going to be and
[2:25:51] these old boys are still on the cross
[2:25:53] and the thieves are groaning this one in
[2:25:56] the middle Jesus he slumped over looks
[2:25:59] like he's
[2:26:01] dead but I'll tell you what to hurry
[2:26:03] this death along you know because what
[2:26:05] they would do is in the
[2:26:07] crucifixion it was such a gruesome death
[2:26:12] where where the lungs would be where you
[2:26:16] know where you would have to pull
[2:26:17] yourself up with your arms to breathe
[2:26:20] and
[2:26:20] and get a breath and then your strength
[2:26:23] would go and
[2:26:25] you now you can't breathe you're all
[2:26:27] collapsed down get a breath so they
[2:26:31] struggle back
[2:26:34] up now their arms are tired they
[2:26:37] struggled back
[2:26:41] up Jesus has already given up to
[2:26:48] ghost Passover times coming got to get
[2:26:52] these boys off the
[2:26:56] cross so they go up and break the
[2:27:01] legs
[2:27:03] literally go up with blow after blow
[2:27:06] until the bones are broken in the legs
[2:27:09] and these boys can no longer push
[2:27:11] themselves up and get a
[2:27:15] breath they beat one they all go over
[2:27:20] they bypass
[2:27:23] Jesus and they walk up to him and they
[2:27:27] beat this one they come
[2:27:31] back and their arms are pulled
[2:27:35] back and they're ready to do it but
[2:27:38] there's a
[2:27:40] word and the word says not one of his
[2:27:44] bones will be
[2:27:48] broken but the word said they pierced
[2:27:51] him with the sphar in his
[2:27:54] side and all of a sudden a Roman
[2:27:59] soldier don't even know what's going on
[2:28:03] but from an unseen realm something
[2:28:07] happens and his his Club is thrown down
[2:28:11] and a spear goes up into his
[2:28:16] side because the law of God's word had
[2:28:20] forbidden a bone to be
[2:28:30] broken every one of
[2:28:33] us will go down into
[2:28:37] death but there is a people on the
[2:28:42] Earth right now who there is a word
[2:28:46] spoken over them
[2:28:50] and they are called the alive and
[2:28:53] remain and no matter how much death
[2:28:56] worketh in our members which it
[2:28:59] does Amen I'm getting older I'm looking
