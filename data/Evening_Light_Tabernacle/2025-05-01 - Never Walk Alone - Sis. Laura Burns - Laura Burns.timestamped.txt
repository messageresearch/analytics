[0:15] If I knew then what I know now, I
[0:19] wouldn't have doubted you.
[0:23] I wish I could tell my younger self just
[0:28] to have
[0:30] faith. There's so many mountains you
[0:34] have moved and valleys you have led me
[0:39] through. And it's only by your
[0:44] grace I'm standing here
[0:48] today. I'm a witness to your
[0:52] faithfulness in every storm, in every
[0:56] step looking back. Never once did you
[1:01] let me
[1:04] go. And no matter what the future holds,
[1:09] you're working it for my good. I know
[1:13] you are
[1:14] faithful and I never walk
[1:20] alone. My life is full of miracles. The
[1:26] stories that I could
[1:29] tell. All that you've healed and all
[1:32] that you've done, I can't
[1:36] forget. So even if my life doesn't go
[1:41] the way I planned or how I
[1:45] hoped, our
[1:47] history has
[1:49] shown. You've never failed me
[1:52] yet. I'm a witness to your
[1:57] faithfulness. In every storm, in every
[2:01] step, looking back. Never once did you
[2:05] let me go.
[2:09] And no matter what the future holds,
[2:13] you're working for my good. I know you
[2:17] are faithful. And I've never walked
[2:22] alone. So I've never walked
[2:25] alone. Nothing and no one can separate
[2:30] me.
[2:31] [Music]
[2:33] Oh, you go behind me and before
[2:38] me.
[2:40] Oh, cuz nothing and no one can separate
[2:45] me.
[2:48] No, cuz every moment I know you're with
[2:54] me. And no matter what the future holds,
[3:00] you're working for my good. I know you
[3:04] are faithful. And I never walk
[3:09] alone. I never walk
[3:16] [Music]
[3:18] alone.
[3:20] Oh, I never walk alone.
[3:25] [Music]
[3:29] [Applause]
