and welcoming our friends Jackson and Laura Burns so we're going to do our very very best um to keep it comfortable you know I told I was telling them in the back I said you know you know all these people you've spoke to just about all of them that most of the people here have probably heard the story before but just in small groups never like this this is different you know but I want them to be comfortable and we and I want them to speak just as if they're in their living room just visiting with you and talking and so we can so we can get this story you know personally um I first met Jackson in in 2003 and of course we maybe maybe he'll mention that in his testimony it's pretty big deal you know yeah maybe not um but in 2003 and and struck up a friendship and and what I've seen is is God has just done in incredible Works in their life and in their family and and we are so grateful and so blessed that that they're now so Journey with us at evening like Tabernacle and just to to get us started tonight down this down this journey I kind of what I'd ask them to do is each one of them give us a little background about their own personal upbringing um what their childhood was like what their life was like just a little bit to to bring us all up to speed as it were and so what we'll do is we'll we'll let brother Jackson start tonight and um begin the testimony with his his side of things well I do appreciate everybody coming out um when uh brother Mike asked or uh this kind of this kind of spawned on Aaron's front porch and Mike was kind of pouring out his heart for his vision and him and Aaron were going back and forth about about some things that they would like to see and sometimes you get caught in the crossfire when you're kind of the third whe and they said well why don't we do this experiment on you we'll have you and Lor give your testimony and I said okay well we can do that and a lot of you guys have heard it we've shared it a lot um I A lot of times with a testimony it can be it it's super I want it to be super positive there's ups and downs within a testimony um there's definitely times where you uh you had your struggles and and things in life didn't maybe go as you thought would be um but I always look back and I see that uh God had a plan in it all right as he's ordaining your footsteps and you know I as I was just um visiting with my mom this week and asking questions about well remind me about this and and remind me about this and then we we had pictures laid out it was just it was a good time to go over uh things in life and where you came from but it also just showed me that if I were to question maybe something well why did it happen this way or or I wish it would have been different it it always reminds me that God was planning something the whole time amen and you look back over your personal life and you realize that um I might want to rewrite some things uh within myself but I don't because I know God was orchestrating it the whole way and even through the tough times and even through the times that I thought I might not be able to keep going on he was pressing through and I see that now and I look back and so when people ask our testimony I love to share it uh I I it has it has a lot of of highlights there's some tough times in there uh but also just a lot of times it can be an encouragement and I think even as brother Mike alluded to when you give your testimony it just allows others around you to clamp onto something uh there's a portion of it that someone can grab a hold of and that's really uh what I want to convey tonight um so origin I'm from Texas uh my parents were Ronnie in Judy Burns I was born in 1980 uh we were born in Dallas I was born in Dallas and um I was reliving the story with my mom she said I I want you to know how proud your dad was when he had you he had me and my brother a little later on in life uh he was 35 when he had me and he was 39 when he had Cody um but my mom told me that my dad came to the hospital and he he wanted to know everybody that he had a son his son's name was Texas Jack and that that has just always lived with me and so when people ask me my nickname or I've had events at work when they said what are some of the names you went by well he called me Texas Jack so he comes to the hospital and he picked me up at limousine he picked me and my mom up in at limousine and he wanted to he just went around town uh he wanted to show everybody his new you know his son so we went showed showed me off to family and friends and my mom was just like he would just go anywhere that day as long as he had maybe rented the limousine and was like I want to show off my son and uh so it was that was really funny um and I just like as I was thinking about it this week I'm like wow he didn't know that like he had a you know he had a seat of God and maybe he didn't know it at that time but he was he was taking the seat of God around a limousine and I just thought okay that's that's really that's really cool um so then after that um I I didn't know this but um I later my mom was telling me that right after that she was uh the to one of the first things in my life she was struck down with cancer so so right from the get-go um she had me in November she went for her six-month followup uh to go uh to the doctor for a checkup and then within her they found like a 12b mass in her stomach and so I remember as she was young she had it cut out by God's grace everything went well uh but I do remember and you know we've had different ones uh friends and family you know they go down to MD Anderson in Houston and I just remember as a young you know as as she would have follow-up visits as I got older um she would constantly be down there and that was just you know that was a little thing that happened early on in life um and so she was you know relaying some of the things that that it you know some of the pressures it put on us growing up uh also uh she was a nurse so she went and um she took herself back to college and I think she graduated around 1990 from nursing school so growing up she was a real Rock in our family my dad traveled a lot uh he worked and um he was a pipe fitter he did a little bit of HVAC but he traveled a lot out to the Carolinas Kentucky Tennessee things like that uh he so he was on the road a lot uh which caused some hardships um uh a lot of times you we would might have a routine or something like that and then my dad would be gone for six months and he'd come back and next thing you know he'd be like hey we're doing this this and the other and we're like well we've got a schedule and we got a routine and and you know my mom would be like well this is not how we're operating so you know those were those were some some tough struggles uh in the beginning um and so but you know you look back and and you see things happen for a reason um when I um I was trying to think when I was in high school um that is when um that's when I first met Laura well hang on just a minute before we go all the way to high school I think we have a picture of you with your mom and dad oh no at about could you give us a guess about what I think I was three cuz Cody Cody wasn't born yet okay so this is right before Cody's born you know I look at that and I I see uh proud parents that looks like the a dad that would run a limousine and drive his son around right well and and then go back home to apartment right and then so at you know it's funny at that time we lived in an apartment on the Rough Side of Town um so when I think my mom was relaying to me when we were going through you know he was letting everybody know in the apartments that he rented a limousine so you better watch [Laughter] out so your parents stayed together up to high school yeah up to high school and um I would say started to happen is maybe my freshman year I was always into sports so played a lot of I played soccer more than anything and then from there played uh football basketball track we were in a 3A school so we um you know always being an athlete and things like that but then that's when I first started uh my mom my dad was on the road my mom was real maybe loose with uh she was working all the time so that allowed me and Cody to be at home and I just started you know I started experimenting in it so uh I would say some of the first things in high school was um start off with the small things I would dip in snuff so dip and snuff and then that was then that led to smoking cigarettes um then that led to marijuana and then other substances so at that time my life started to change uh more to the party scene and you could see you know kind of like with Athletics and things like that that started to um not be my focus and I love sports even to my senior year where I didn't actually just quit the football team because I got so involved in partying and drugs and things like that where it's just like that was really my main focus so before we give Laura the opportunity to tell her um early life you brought us up to your senior year and you you mentioned you just kind of you made mention that there was things in in your home life that you felt like turned you down that road senior year is that when you're your home split yeah so that is I was asking my mom today so in 98 my junior year is when um they had split I went with my mom uh Cody went with my dad and then at that time um we lived in a trailer so from Denton we bought a trailer and then when I was three from three all the way till 18 um but our trailer burnt down so I live with my mom Cody lived with my dad uh the trailer burnt down that forced them to move to emerel okay so your dad and Cody left they left and went to tamarillo and you stayed in what was it what town were you Glenrose GL we lived in Glenrose okay um one funny story is I did meet Laura in Geometry when you hear her side of the story sometimes it it it seems to be alter but I do remember her flirting in with [Laughter] me and so she would always need to borrow a pencil one time it seemed like it was a lot more than that day once a day okay um so we met in Geometry we got to kind of know each other a little bit there one funny story is I really thought you know I thought she was pretty in high school and so down in our cafeteria it had three levels so I always tell this story I sat down on the the bottom level and that's where all the football players would sit so Lura would come off of the top level and she was going to go sit at her table and I would always lean over to my buddy and I would say hey hey watch this so Lord walked by and she'd be getting close getting close and I'm just going to demonstrate it cuz it's better this is an exaggeration so she would walk by and I would say hey Laura and she'd go that's awesome well now that we've we're going to get that part told again before we leave just so we can see that so we brought it up to the point where you know who who Laura is but I believe you told me it would really be your your senior year when y'all really got to know one another correct yeah so to kind of just finish up my first side of it um yeah we we knew each other uh throughout High School uh and then my senior year um I'm going to go ahead and give those details before I turn over to her but my senior year I during spring break we were going down to South Padre Island me and a bunch of friends and we were going to do the big party scene and I got a DWI on the way up South Padre so we stay we only barely get out of town I get pulled over we got marijuana we got I've been drinking I get a DWI but we still got on the Padre come back go to court the judge says he was a military guy so he said if you go to the military then I'll dismiss this DWI so I said okay well my dad was in the Air Force so I said well I'll go to the Air Force well with a DWI you can't go to the Air Force so I said well I'll go to the Navy so then that's when I signed up for the Navy well then that summer Laura and I that's when we started dating okay so now we're going to turn it over to your side of things and you can start very early in life now a lot of I don't know this is on but um our testimony always involves my dad so I don't know what point at what I need to bring Just go with it that is so just go ahead okay just when you get to it just feel okay well I was born okay this is can I just lay it down that was a good pose yeah so I was born in Brooksville Florida and um I know there's some folks here I found out that we're from that area too um but I'll just go ahead and go into my dad's cuz it's just going to blend right in we can't separate the two um my mom and dad are both from Florida and um my dad grew up um really rough not really a religious background um went to the Army when he was of age and was in Germany for almost 4 years and he said that whenever he was getting caught smoking cigarettes or smoking hash over there which was really big instead of um Sergeant wood I guess I don't know what they do in the Army I guess you get in big trouble but he would preach at the boys and tell them his testimony he tell them about the book of Acts um tell them about repentance and so you know that just made them squirm but uh it was doing something to my dad so fast forward comes back from Germany and um goes to a little Baptist Church that he had went to just a couple times as a kid because it was his uncle's Baptist Church um like Dad said they'd go whenever there was like dinner on the grounds cuz they were real poor um so he ended up getting baptized there and don't if I should tell that story but um got baptized there and that's a funny story for another time but um after that he was still hungry and the preaching there wasn't really doing much for him so he prayed about it and was driving around the Okala area or dun Ellen there in Florida and he saw a UPC Church and the billboard said we preach with the Bible teaches so he said the Lord spoke to him and said you'll find the truth there so my dad goes in there and takes in a service afterwards goes and talks to the preacher which is brother erson and he goes to the back and um brother uran tells him he can pick a book from a study a ton of books so dad picks a book and ends up being a sermon of William brandom's um Dad believes it was broken sistern so brother Aron then goes into the detail about that he'd been to his meetings supported the meetings I think it was in Birmingham Alabama um talked about that you've better make sure if you go up there you've got things under the blood because the Lord shows him a lot cuz he has he's a prophet um so dad was interested read the books wanted more uh contacted voice of God Recordings cuz the address was on the back of the book so how old are you at this point I'm not born yet okay so this all happened pretty happen PR y so um he's getting few books tapes here and there um meets my mom at this church they end up getting married have me there in Brooksville um my dad had put himself through college courses and got a job at the power plant out there at Florida Power and then was transferred to Texas when I was three um so dad through this town did not know there was message churches um he just was getting books and tapes that he loved um so I grew up Church hopping so we were always in church very denominational um my dad just a regular 5 days a week guy at the power plant um my mom took me to brownies and then the Girl Scout so typical childhood um I was see only child so I was kind of weird my pets were like my siblings I loved my bets um but I always had friends over all the time um just totally normal do we have a picture of Laura in elementary school there we go those were my favorite glasses fifth grade um so about how old were you here I think it was fifth grade so I was probably what's that like 11 mhm so to this point in your life church hopping dad works at the power plant but your home's a pretty normal home as far as you as far as you know as far as I'm concerned it was very normal home yeah yeah um I started band at sixth grade and did it till I graduated I was trumpet did marching band where the ugly hats and their ugly red uniform um but so if we skip too far ahead here you can back up so your home H stays normal up until High School yeah semi-religious mhm yeah yeah um we were always regularly involved in the churches we were going to um there's only a few things looking back that I remember like um as far as dad cuz he was getting like message books and was reading them of course we still did not know there's message churches um there is a time where some friends of mine at the charismatic Baptist Church for getting baptized but was Trinity and uh I wanted to get baptized but Dad he wouldn't let me because um he had already talked to him they went baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he had heard the truth on that um but as far as I was concerned it was you know very normal so what point did things turn towards the negative um so yeah there was just a time when I was a teenager and I really don't know the details what was going on but my parents I guess I was see a freshman you're about 14 15 so sometime around there my parents quit going to church um the Baptist Church and um Jennifer Carter and Joe Boyd were Varsity cheerleaders and they're really good Baptist girls and I was a freshman they'd pick me up and I'd go to the Baptist Church with them um so that kept me while my parents weren't going but once they graduated and my mom she she loves the Lord and she has turned from this path um she professes Christianity and madees things right right but the devil just slipped in like you give it an inch he's going to take them all um so she just did not so her Wild Oats growing up um was raed raised very like legalistic UPC um just very religious and so um you know I don't know she let the devil in and uh you know just to help Laura feel more comfortable she'd Express how she really wants to share this aspect of her testimony but but she wants to be um she doesn't want to say anything that would even offend or or her mom or anybody they were ever to watch watch this and also some of the things aren't easy to talk about yeah but we want her to know that everybody in here has got things in their life that wouldn't be easy to talk about lots of stuff you know that we've maybe never shared you know so just feel free to to express how much you want to okay um so when this was going on we we're getting close to met at a party me and Jackson but um my mom it was like she became a teenager again and she started buying me beer and then um she started smoking pot and so I started smoking pot with her um start getting high with my mom and then of course um you know when your parents go down that kind of path and you don't have an anchor I mean but typically what you do um you just follow down the same path and um so there is drinking um smoking pot with my mom um then I started going down the party Road pretty hard and that's where me and Jackson met um I did my first line of cocaine my mom bought it um she had in Glenrose during this time I think when all that started I was the end of my junior year and there's like 2,000 people that lived in Glenrose it very small Texas Hill Country Town so one of my neighbors was in high school she was in Jackson's grade and the other neighbor they were both coaches and teachers at the high school so words spread pretty quick um things that was going on I mean there were things that I got involved with in my mom as far as uh witchcraft tarot cards seances very it went dark pretty quick um and then the embarrassment of what was going on with my Mom leaving my dad dad during this time I couldn't handle the pressure of not belonging anymore because I'd left all my friends for another crowd and the embarrassment of everything going on in my family I'm in a small town at spread quick so I dropped out of school and went to an alternative campus to graduate early and at this time is when me and Jackson start hanging out so let's bring you I'm hakai so is this uh and y'all can you can flip through the pictures so they can see we don't show any of these pictures in any way to glorify anything that happened that you could even tell as Sister Laura talked it's not something she's proud of at all but to recognize that God's going to get you yeah wherever wherever you are whatever you're going through if you're his he's going to get you and we believe that so this would be senior year that is if I need a mic that picture is actually me going to the Navy um I am at the air I am at the airport about to fly to Chicago uh so I did sign up uh for the Navy right before there and I got one and that's this is the summer of 99 uh this is when I got my second DWI so now I've had a DWI within just a few months of one another this judge now knows that I'm about to leave and he's also doesn't want to ruin my life as a young man so he's letting me get out of town so if I can just get out of town in the next three weeks then both DWIs will be dismissed and so this is me at the airport um in my hand is is uh cranberry juice because I have just smoked weed a few hours before and I think I'm going to go there and life is going to change and so I am trying to drink as much as I can so that I can pass my drug test so it was an old druggy wife's tail that this drink worked to clean your system brother Mike you would know about this so I'm trying to clean up um it doesn't uh so I I fly to Chicago I uh get into the military we stay up for almost 72 hours in this story make sure you share the part about the position you took in the na oh man so we get up there uh we're up we're getting um we're doing our drug tests we're getting all of our clothes we're getting our Barracks everything we get assigned to where uh we're going to be at and I am at this point I'm ready I've left my small town I'm in Chicago I'm going to be going to the Navy life is about to start changing for the better for me um and at this time me and Lura were still dating still we're writing one another uh and then maybe some phone calls in there um and they come one day and they say well we need a chaplain and I'm like and I and I really had kind of skimmed over the Bible a little bit and I thought why be perfect for a chaplain so so in that crowd nobody raises their hand and I don't know if this was the first time God tucked at me or if it was just me but I said well I'll be the chaplain and everybody's like okay so I'm like all right what do we got to do so we I start I think I go to maybe one chaplain class um and but this time boot camp is eight weeks long and I'm supposed to and usually within the first week they know when you fail your drug test you're in you're out you're General dischar General discharge well I had been in there for 6 weeks and I'm two weeks away from graduating I tell my mom I tell Laura everybody my brother they're making plans to come see me and I uh out of nowhere they pulled me in there and they said well you've you've failed your drug test and so you're going to be getting kicked out of the Navy and at that time I said well I I want to do I want to be in here I yes I party before I left but I don't want to go back and they said no you're get a you're going to get a general discharge so I get a general discharge but now I don't know what did I tell you guys so I got a phone call my parents were in town and uh you know my dad and my grandpa they had both been in the military but I go in there and announce that they're discharging Jackson from the Navy and that he said they did it because him and another guy got in a fight and he hit him over the head with a still toed boot so that's a no no my dad and my grandpa are like people fight in the military all the time I Ain never heard nobody get kicked out for that I'm like I don't know that's that's what he said so so were you just too embarrassed I really was I called everybody and told them I got in a fight so then people who know me they're like I don't think Jackson in high school ever got in a fight like he's not the fighting type why why would he all a sudden go get in a fight so that story wasn't going well around [Laughter] town so you come back so I come back and now I don't want to be in Glenrose uh the town that we're from these are where around the area where I got my DWI so I move off to Austin Texas um moved down there with some buddies me and Laura are still communicating she's coming to see me her and her mom they'll drive down there um one of the times that they have to drive down there I call them because I have went out and I have was in a bar and I stole some liquor at the bar and I got thrown in jail down there in Travis County so I tell her hey I need you to come bail me out well I don't know if her if your dad was like well I don't know if we y'all need to go down there so quick but they let me stay in there for several days before they came and got me out so they come down there they get me out and then I realize that this is right around uh at the end of 1999 and we're about to go into Y2K so they bring me back to Glenrose so that we can all be together because Y2K is about to happen and the world is going to end and so better so we better party hard so if I if we're skipping something that's important stop me but we've kind of laid the foundation of what life was like where y'all were when did things begin to change for the positive so shortly after the Austin pickup is when my parents ended up divorcing um and so at this time I lived at our old family home for about 6 months with my mom because that was kind of what the court orders were um per my request that she live there so she could get a job and get on her feet um and then Dad would come back and sell the home so 6 months goes by a terrible dark time there at the house with my mom uh dad comes in and reclaims the house she's got to leave and at this point um my dad had gotten so desperate cuz um you know I'm in the party scene drugs um my mom's left him she's in drugs and he just got rid of everything uh sold everything um just didn't want any memories but he did keep the box of uh tapes um there may have been some CDs in there and some books of Bo and Brandon that he got from voice of God Recordings and my mom left with uh Bobby and I end up having to stay there with my dad and still partying um going to the clubs all the time um Dad at this time gets on the internet and types in William Brandon because he had gotten his books out because he had just got so desperate like he went back to what he knew fed him um I think this was around 2000 yeah so he TPS Willam Brown the internet and I think it was the voice of God Recordings directory list for churches pops up so my dad's flored at this point he's like all these years I've Church topped and there are churches is out there so he finds Brother David and sister lesie calls them and they didn't pick up but Lesley called back and they talked and my dad starts going to church he's driving an hour and a half to Fort Worth because we were way further down south um so sell the family house and me and my dad move into an apartment together there in Glenrose and um I knew he was going to a church and it was all the way in Fort Worth but I was like well you know this is making him happy you know that's his thing I'm not going to go but you can go so he's going and uh he's been real faithful and I can see a change in my dad cuz he kind of had shaggy hair and he kind of had one leg in and one out leg out um as far as like with God and with the world and and nothing bad like he do a social drink once in a while um but I just started noticing um that was gone the way he talked was gone the way he looked was gone he was starting to cut his hair shorter um just there is a change and I was happy for him but I wasn't ready and um so dad was really good about he never pressured me um because he knew he knew how much ID went through and he knew like unless you're born again like you just can't pressure someone into right being born again you can't do it you've got to let God do it um he had told me today I'd called him and just wanted a little more detail um but he had said going to church that one night on his way home it was late it was either a Sunday or Wednesday night and he had stopped at a railroad crossing and the lights were going on they're flashing and the guard was down and he was listening to a tape and brother Brandon was saying um it was at the end of a tape where he was Discerning people were up for the prayer and a woman came up and brother brandham asked what it was she needed and she she goes to tell him and my dad said he thought you know if I was right there what would I tell him I wanted and he said I tell him I want my daughter saved and so he said right there he said Lord I want my daughter saved and he said brother Brandon finish the prayer with that woman and he told her what you've asked for and what you've said that that's how it's going to come to pass if you believe it so dad was like that's it like I claim it so he gets home and Brother David McGary calls him and uh dad answers and I think brother day was just checking on make sure he got home okay um and dad just told him what was on his heart and what had happened and he said I just want my daughter saved and Brother David said if that's what you want you're going to get it just claim it so Dad said ever since that he was done he knew it was going to happen and he said he just sat back and watched me and waited for God to move um watched me go into the parties he knew everything I was doing I mean it was very apparent um of course there was times when I'd leave to go out and I'd see my dad sitting on the couch by himself it kind of felt bad be like bye dad you know but he was so good with um not pressuring he would just sometimes say hey tomorrow uh if you want to go to church with me you can go and so one day I took him up on his offer and went and it was pretty convicting but I didn't go back for a while after that and then uh you know me and Jackson still together they're in Glenrose and um the first time I remember hearing brother brandom's voice was my dad stopped me and that night I was going to go out to a party and um he said hey Laura listen to this this is so interesting and he pushed play on the tape machine and it was marriage and divorce and and brother Brandon was talking about if you look at a woman and lust after her you've committed adultery with her even though you haven't committed the act and talk about conviction to someone that's going to clubs wearing in modest clothes um that's the first time I remember feeling a pretty big prick in my heart so after that I didn't have the full Revelation so if I was out at a club somewhere if I saw an older man I'd be like oh don't look at me you know cuz I was like oh I remember what he said on that date she would say anybody that she thought might be married she would all try to cover herself because she didn't want them looking at her go around and be like look at my friends don't look at me um so so your dad starts going my dad starts going he's inviting you you went once mhm um and then at some point you taught Jackson go with because your dad asking you to go and you're like I don't want to go up there by myself no no because it was convicting and I think May me deep down inside deep down inside I knew it was right I mean there wasn't a question it was like once that sprung like that was it I knew it was right so tell us from your Viewpoint the first time she tries to get you to go so she invites me to go and uh it's a Sunday night and she says hey will you go to church you know my dad's been going to church he's changed I've gone a few times maybe with him will you go this time and I'm like okay that's fine so we're going to leave at maybe 4 3:00 to get up there early um so what I'm going to do that day is I'm going to go play golf so I've planned to play golf and I'm like all right if I drag it out a little bit maybe have a beer or two then I can let her know that I'm not going to be able to make it so I do exactly that and I'm like ah I'm not going to be able to make it and if anybody knows Laura you know she has a way with words and um and so many words she was like you need to go or else and so I was like oh man so I skipped the last four holes go to my car meet her go jump in the car we go up there and um I didn't really grow up into the church and when I did grow we or when I went to church we'd go to the Baptist church and we were the ones that went on uh Christmas and Easter and I don't understand why we have to drive an hour and a half to church and then when we get there it is a double wide trailer and so if anybody's ever took in a service at brother David's uh the old church in Wataga it's a double wide trailer and now I don't really understand like normal churches have like a normal building but this church is like a double wi like I I'm not understanding we go the long way for this we yeah so I don't understand it we go in there and I always tell this part because I think it's really funny uh but we get there and um it's uh small crowd but there's the McGary boys so Aaron Davey and Matthew and I think Mike Jr and a brother named Glenn well we're all young and but I need to let them know that this is my girlfriend so not that they were looking but I'm like well normally you got to kind of like throw out vibe to everybody that this is your girlfriend so they know so we're in service and I just have my arm around her and I'm just letting all I mean there's not a lot of us there at that time and I'm just letting them know I this is my girlfriend so you Brothers don't try to move in on her so somewhere through the course uh Brother David he he's preaching a phenomenal service and he's talking about and if anybody knows his testimony it's super powerful uh but he's talking about if there's a seat of God in you that you can try to cover it with with drugs alcohol women things of the world but if that's seed there then there's it'll always come to know the truth and so by the end I don't know what happens I'm there to support her by the end of service I'm the one that's breaking down I'm crying so Brother David at the end of service he comes over and I think the boys come over and they all pray with me and we were're walking out of service and like I have a pack of cigarettes in my pocket and Matthew's like hey what's that in your pocket and I'm like those are cigarettes he's like let's tear those up and I'm all crying I'm like yeah let's tear them up so we we go in the bathroom and we rip them out we start tearing up these cigarettes right there in the bathroom um so that was that was my f so and then on the way home um we're listening to a tape and I think that's really the first time I think I heard brother brandom in the discernment so really it was the discernments that got me so we go back home and from there we were live we still living together right still problematic still a problem we're living together but every once in a while we would go to church with your dad so now this is 2002 and going to church with her dad I didn't really know a lot but I I knew when we did go to church that we would always listen to tapes and it just got me that this was something different I didn't really grow up in the church but when I heard brother brandom I knew it was different um and then at at the end we would it just seemed to always cuz it was an hour and a half there an hour and a half back we always made it to the part at the end of the tape with the discernment and um so it was just always powerful to know that um how God was dealing and I didn't know that that God worked through men like this and so it was definitely something that stuck out to me so at some point you get more serious a little bit Yeah tell tell us where Jackson she makes that that break with the with the the trip so we I noticed that Laura is she's going she's a little bit uh more serious than I am um we both were kind of in the beginning um interested but then the interest really just starts to fade so she wants to H we're planning a big family vacation we're going to go to uh Lake wasal there in Arkansas saw we're going to have a houseboat uh it's going to have a Jacuzzi on top with a slide coming out like I'm ready and I'm inviting her and I'm I said hey do you know you want to go with us well God's dealing with her sometimes she's wearing skirts sometimes she's not she's really just starting to make that transformation so I invited her to go and she's like well I'm going to I'm going to pray about it and I'm like all right I don't know what to pray about but okay so she's like I'm going to pray about it so she literally L makes a pros and cons list Pros are going to be um I'll have time to read my Bible and pray every day I'm going to read the Seven Seals Seven Seals book I'm going to bring the church age book it'll be so relaxing cons are going to be like well they're going to be partying it's going to be a bad influence so at this point I'm like I don't want her to come on this trip she's going to be dragging me down on this trip so in the end she really battles all the way up to the very end and we literally we leave our town of Glenrose we go to the next town over which is Grandberry we she's still coming I'm still not wanting her to come deep inside and we get there and finally she wrestles with herself and like I'm just not going to go so she so she literally stays there and we we wind up leaving her there we leave the house the property and she's there because Matthew and her dad are going to come pick her up so she at that point she anchors down and she is now like that's her stake in the ground she is now sold out and I believe it was that is around the summertime so then right after that it was August is when you got baptized I think there may be a picture of her baptism that's awesome that's awesome so so at this point and I don't know if I do I need this mic so at this point is there a clean break from Jackson for the most part um I would because you're living with Chad around this time um him and a friend moved in together um of course I still loved him dearly um because we were together for almost four years so um I did go over to his house when he was with Chad I think twice and I told Jackson if I give you a shoulder massage for the whole tape will you listen to this and he did it and Chad would sit there and listen to too and my arms would be Jello but I just so wanted him to listen cuz I was believing for a change um I mean it was just it's just hard to let go when you've lived with someone and been through so much with somebody through parents divorcing um the whole drug scene and it was a really tough Detachment at that time um but then there was where I just had to completely let go and what was it you told him on it to the me when we first met she told you she didn't love you that what so so she gets baptized and um we listen to a few tapes and then at that time um there at Christian Life Tabernacle they had their meetings their annual meetings in December so they have brother Isaiah Brooks out so they she invites me Friday night to come to the meetings and that's when I go to the meetings Friday night and that is actually the first night that we met that's so we cross paths and fud Ruckers there um Matthew introduces me and you as the first introduction and then we don't see we don't meet again till Youth Camp of the next year um so that was Friday night I didn't go Saturday Sunday morning she I told her okay I'll meet you at the Burger King at 8:30 then we're going to drive up there so I don't meet her there she her and Bruce Bruce is like hey let's just go it's a big meeting we're going to be late she comes to my house I think it's she knows where the keys at or it's unlocked it was unlocked it was unlocked she steps over everybody that's passed out wakes me up because I had promised her that I was going to come to service so she gets me up I get cleaned up as best as I can and then we're out we go to service well you know how a special meeting is where it's we show up and it's packed especially in that small Church um the only three seats that are open are the first three seats on the front row so there's the pulpit these three seats are open and um they set us up front in her mind she's like oh how can the deacons do that they I mean they should set us in the back what what are they thinking um I said see how God works so at the end of service phenomenal service once again they make kind of an altar call and they ask who wants to give their heart to the Lord so when you were standing here and the pulpit is right here to get to the altar you only have to do that and it was so I I didn't have to do the Walk of Shame like all the way from the back cuz I probably would have never done that but when you just have to make a half step because you're right there uh it made it easy so that was in so that was uh that's always a neat part of it and then fast forward right to uh now it's Janu or it's December 31st of 2002 um we have one more big blowout party at my house it's New Year's Eve the next morning um you can well you can kind of tell us what happened that night like for you oh so um typically I was at the big blowout New Year's Eve party and so um I was so burdened and just sick that I knew what Jackson was doing and I determined that I'm going to pray for him all night long and tomorrow I'm driving to his house and I'm going to see results so that's what I did my knees were sore the next morning I fell in and out of sleep the whole night night uh woke up that next morning just still on my knees and got dressed and drove myself over to the house and uh when I pulled up he actually wasn't there but his friends were there uh Jackson went to town to go get more beer and so I went in there cuz they were actually at your mom's house is where y are doing it and waited for him to show up and and um he did and he walks in the back door and I'm standing there in the kitchen with him and at this point um my dad has decided to move me and him up to kind of the Fort Worth line to get me closer to church because he sees how vital that is for me that's still a very new Christian um always describe to my dad that when I first gave my life to the Lord until I got really anchored that it felt like there's a vacuum cleaner constantly following me around and I could just feel the suction all the time and my dad made a very wise choice in getting me closer up to the church so I could fellowship with u it was mostly the McGary boys sometimes Heather and vong Guy were there um but I needed that um so I came over to tell Jackson that um my dad's decided to move us up close to the church and so she always tell this part so she tells me that she's moving she that that I'm a bad influence she's ready to move on I'm only dragging her down it's the vacuum that she talked about and it's just keeps trying to suck her back to the world and so she lets me know she's moving well she makes like one of the boldest statements I've ever heard she says I want you to know that I don't love you but I would love to see your soul saved and so I was like oh man and that was deep so I I I think I think I finish out that day doing whatever we were doing but at that point that was that was the last time that I ever drank smoke did anything that that day I laid it down so what happened so you prayed all night and the next day would be the last day he ever did any of those things so you got the results you were looking for I did that's awesome that's awesome testimony right there and um so with that I um then I got so then I wanted I wanted to give my heart to the Lord um so finished the day that was it and then got baptized January of 2003 so around that time I I know that oh yeah I think there's January so it was cold it's January we didn't have a baptismal we do it there in the river um I love Brother David so I always give him a hard time about this but we I got baptized first then there was another brother that got baptized and Brother David he had on a he had on a wet suit under his clothes that couldn't be seen and I didn't know this at the time um so he so he's out there and he's fine well the third the third person that got baptized was a sister when she got baptized it was so cold that when she came up she kind of went into shock and kind of stumbled so when she stumbled she fell into Brother David and they both went under the water so I always give him a hard time about that saying that that we got him back for that and um so that was 200 uh that was third week in January at that point I in my head I make the statement I go I got God I got the girl this is going to be a piece of cake and that's when the Lord is like no no no so so I always use the type that U at that point how how uh God hardened Pharaoh's heart there in Egypt I always say God really truly hardened Laura's heart at that season she was done with me we were over um we we had basically talked and said hey we're going to go our own separate ways and that's when we basically split up and I realized now that all that was just really so that we could have our own walk because there was times early on I was batting well is did I do it for me did I do it for the Lord did I do it for her like who am I doing it for so when he cut that off uh that's when we went our separate ways and then really the first event was the 2003 Louisiana Camp um that was when brother Ron Spencer was there and brother Danny steeman was there um we had just a a fabulous service if anybody has ever heard about those times or those Services um I didn't know a lot about Camp history it was both of ours first Camp ever yeah it was both of our first Camp ever yeah and um brother Ron preached the mighty conqueror on Saturday night and the Holy Spirit just fell in waves upon waves I thought you know you everybody's been to service now but I thought like we were there for like 10 hours I just thought man this like it's got to be 4 in the morning or something like what time is it and it just went wave after wave after wave uh and that's really where for me God really just anchored down and completely changed my life when I realized that uh there was a power in God and what he was doing and what he was trying to accomplish uh and I had just seen I say almost for a quick work but um it was pretty instantaneously when I got baptized I gave my heart to the Lord and things of the the world really just fell off um and then the anchor that for that service um was just super powerful and I know you had some experiences there and and we were screaming and shouting and running I'll never forget brother Jackson this was the first time we' ever hung out and at some point during all that he goes is this how it always is I'm like no not always but um it was a wonderful experience during that time um I know Sister Laura had went her way you went a different way it's funny because seed sewn then or even while we're sitting here tonight and that brother Jackson to to avoid seeing her would start coming over here almost every other weekend and he would come over here almost every other weekend for about a year and um I always think that a real important part of his testimony is the first time he ever visited our church and uh he got in on that Friday night and um about 3: in the morning or something crazy CU he worked all day then drove over and then we me and brother Tim winers got him up at 5:30 to go fishing and um and and this a funny story and I'll tell it briefly but he he comes in he's never even met brother Tim CU When we got to Tim's house and spent the night Tim was already asleep and so Jackson I wake him up on the C off the couch like hey man we're going fishing he goes okay and he he stumbles into the kitchen he still hasn't met Tim and he looks there and there's this cup of coffee and he goes man Aaron made me a cup of coffee that's awesome' it's just how I like it and he picks it up and he's drinking his coffee and Tim walks around the corner and just stops and stares at him and Jackson's like Su Jackson Tim goes that's my [Laughter] coffee so that that was their introduction to each other well the next day we'd kept him up all night and Jackson's fired up for the Lord man so he sits on the front row oh yeah and he says it's an exaggeration but I'm going to tell it the way I've always told it and the way I remember it he was tired and it was a it was a Sunday morning we'd been going for a while and I and I look up there because I'm I'm married at this point so I'm sitting with lyan Jackson on the front row and he's done passed out and he's done slid down a little bit and I see his hand touching the floor next to the bench next to us so we tell that story to brother juel forny a while later and then brother juel comes to preach at our church while Jackson's visiting and so brother juul's preaching along and just preaching all a sudden he just stops and says where's Jackson at is he [Music] awake that was rough so during this time they stayed apart for a while and and let's move it forward to the time where you ask her to um to come visit your your mom so all that all that had a purpose in there um this was also time when I literally was traveling going to camps uh traveled out to Arizona that's when I met the Dexter boys out there we had a nice little running out there in Arizona in 2003 2004 is um and during this time I'm passing out tracks I'm witnessing to people bringing people to church people are getting baptized people are going to Camp uh one person in particular uh was a young lady that I was a coworker of mine her name was Jess iica had given her some tracks um she started coming to church a lot of times if I was witnessing uh maybe to uh a female or something like that I would do what I can to get them to service and then after Ser or then after a few Services if I could turn them over to a sister or something so they could be um a little you know have a little bit more fellowship with the sisters than I would do that so one her in particular I turned uh her over to Laura her and Laura got to become uh real good friends she came to Camp she got baptized uh and then she really started to just have some family struggles um just the pressure from her family and wearing skirts and and not cutting her hair and no makeup this was a total transformation for her uh but it was really neat because even at work she worked in the only position I'd worked for I worked for Walmart at that time in their Distribution Center um and she had the only position that had a um that had a uniform and she she's like I want to change position so that I can wear skirts and we prayed about it and God opened the door for her got her into the HR and she was able to wear skirts so she was kind of struggling a little bit with wearing skirts a little you know at work and then maybe a day at pants but she really was starting to have a a solid testimony but Laura was she had not been or the girl Jessica had not been coming to church for maybe for a little bit so lur reached out to me so this has been now I would say a year that we've U kind of been separated and that's where she's you're coming back to Glenrose and so she comes to Glenrose and I just said she says hey can you get me Jessica's number I haven't been in contact with her so I get her in contact um and I said hey if you don't mind would you would you come stop by the house you know we we dated for so long there's been a change in my life my mom my brother and them they would like to see you um if you if you would feel comfortable would you come by so she says yeah I'll come by she comes by we talk and really it's just like um we're just fellowshipping and then instantly I on that it's like we reconnected uh I mean she fell in love again it was amazing so it it just was the Lord's timing she uh we just started talking again so I I I talked to her dad and I and this was all new to me dating courting all the those kind of things so I uh I always would ask uh brother Matthew McGary he was my best friend and so I'd ask him hey how do you do all this and so he's like well you need to talk to her dad so I talk to her dad and I asked if um okay that's when we uh started talking again right there so we're making the we're making the the change back and uh he says yeah I've seen a transformation in your life I've seen God just cleanse you you're a different person uh I would love for you guys to you know start talking again um so during that time um that was in the middle of 2004 um then we get engaged in October of 2004 um and then we get married and yeah yeah engagement was pretty quick and then we get married in January of 2005 that was an engagement picture my aunt she always is taking pictures and so she was like we were there for I think Thanksgiving so she's like I want to run inside and she grabbed something to put on Laura's head cuz we were engaged so and then we want then we then we get married January of 2005 compare what you're looking at here to the pictures of them just a few years before that's Ain ain't God good he's awesome and and I do want to just for the sake of people understanding you you made the statement earlier you know I got God I got the girl everything's going to be easy as we begin to wind this towards the present I I would like you to have the opportunity to share you the big tragedy that hit you in your life soon after you you do really have the girl now you're married and then you find out you're going to have Zoey and then what comes from there so early on in our Christian walk you know the lord always gives you this amazing uh I say Zeal but he just he put you up on the Mountaintop and allows you to just you know Fly Above everything that's coming at you um and so we we get we're married um we're things God's just put a hedge of protection around us he really starts to solidify us as as in our own walks our walks as a married couple uh and then I think then really the first big test comes uh in December of 2006 we realized that we're going to have Zoe um I called my dad I let him know that hey we're expecting our first um he super excited for us and then my uh then later on a few weeks later my mom's grandfa or my mom's dad my grandfather she he passes away a few days right before Christmas my mom and my brother they go up to the funeral I'm I I'm having to work I wasn't able to break away for whatever reason um during this time my brother spends time with my dad um the day before my Grandpa's funeral my brother's with my dad uh my Mom leaves amarella goes about 45 minutes north to Dumis picks up Cody around 10 o'clock that night and then somewhere between 10:00 that night and 2: in the morning my dad wakes up and commits suicide side uh he shot himself and it was really the first big blow to me as a young Christian because it was just so many mountaintops you know so many high peaks that you know I you know I guess you you know I realize that those things are going to happen but uh it was a real big blow to us uh a lot of times you know I look back and there there was no notes there was no signs there was no um understanding and so really at that point um you know I'm I'm just question a lot of things it doesn't rock my anchor and and who I am and what God has planned for me but you know you start to battle questions about why and what and you know then did I say enough you know what I mean because we had a witness he had knew our testimony um I always believe that um that he saw the change in me and Laura I think he knew that we were at a good place we were starting our family he knew that me and Cody were very close uh that I could help take care of him my mom was at a good spot uh they still had a friendship even though they had separated all those years uh and so that was really kind of the first big blow as a Christian uh to me um and I will say this one of the testimonies that came out of it is if anybody knows Brother David mcgary's testimony he comes out of a uh he he he came out of a real uh past past with drugs and alcohol and bikers and stuff like that so I asked him would he do the funeral and he says I'll do anything you need uh so we he flies up to amarello and you you talk about um a funeral with a rough crowd my Dad ran with a really rough crowd and Brother David just preaches a masterpiece and he just uh because he can relate he can be in those channels uh he's preaching uh Salvation and repentance and opportunities and I just know that several several folks got spoken to uh they came up afterwards after the service and just thanked him enough and you know I just was always super appreciative of that because you never know when for what situations when God is reaching seeds or different things like that and what what the impact can be um so that was that was really one of the first um big battles that we went through and through that all The Anchor Holds and so we've seen God bring youall to Salvation allow you to walk on your own bring you back together you're married we we have um Zoe's born then you go through this tragedy and then then we can't forget Silas silus is born and and um and you have 18 years um there in Fort Worth you want you to share a little bit about about that just for a minute yeah so we um you know uh I I always always thank Brother David because you know he was he married us he did my dad's funeral he uh baptized our kids uh we had a phenomenal uh group of friends there and there's just such a an amazing work there uh in Texas and so then I would say this and and then so we I I do I always give him also a hard time because um I remember he asked me if I wanted to be a deacon uh or what I pray about being a deacon over there and at that time uh I was in my mid 20s and I um I look back now and my thoughts are different but I'm like deacons are for old guys like why why would he want me to be a deacon um and uh I look back now I'm like well the brothers that were deacons over there they weren't old why did I think that uh but I said I said I'll pray about it and um and he said you pray about it you see how you feel and then uh we'll see how the people feel and then we'll vote on it so I said okay we'll do that so everything's going well I always tell them this 18 months later uh Brother David comes to me he's like all right I feel like it's been a few months Let's uh let's let's go before the people I said Brother David it's it's been 18 months he's like what whoa where's the time going so so we we still do it we make it official um and so we serve in that capacity and during that time uh Laura Sunday school teacher and helping out and doing things and um just really putting our shoulder to the wheel uh there for that work uh and then this last year it um that's kind of when things started to change God started doing a stirring in our heart um about you know potentially moving and what to do well uh if you've ever you know you've heard other people's testimony and at this point um if I wanted to say that I thought life was perfect uh we're at a great church um I've got the best job that I ever had uh we love the the school that the kids went to their two days at school three days at home um you know this just like your perfect picture if you could write it up um we had it and then all of a sudden God's stirring on your heart to move so we prayed about it um we left we went to Florida and we had such a great time in Florida we're on vacation and always tell this um that we came back and then all a sudden it was like whoa we should move to Florida it's amazing and I'm like no wait that we're just on a vacation High you know we're just wait we shouldn't move to Florida that's not where the Lord's leading us we're just on a vacation High let's really pray about it so uh we continue to pray about it and then I uh met with Brother David and he gave me some great advice and um you know told him kind of what was on our heart then uh later on I called brother Tim cuz I really wanted to make sure that I met with the two pastors just told them to what's been on our heart and then so uh the minute we kind of felt led to come and to finalize everything it's just like and you know you know several of you have raised your hand that you've just moved here over the last few years um it just went it just happened quick we were able to uh talk to my boss let him know what was going on uh put the house on the market um it sold really quick and then we were able to to just make a transition and several people here just helped us through that whole transition and um just kind of really let us up to to this point you know that God is still unfolding maybe the reasons and the testimonies of why he's doing things but you know you just believe that uh your footsteps are ordained Amen brother Mike do you have the the picture from um from Virginia this year you I want y'all to think back to the pict that we saw of them where God brought them from to where God has brought them to [Music] today and I tell you what I don't mean to embarrass people but Zoe come on Silas come on come stand with your mom and dad let's just this is a picture but you can stand with them I'm going to get out of the way and say this is what God has done and it's marvelous in our [Applause] [Music] eyes amen now as we begin to bring this to a close uh this this part of the service we just all want to say thank y'all for sharing um I know sometimes things ain't easy to talk about get in front of a crowd and and just talk like that thank you so much I know it blessed my heart to hear it from beginning to end to see the hand of God moving and drawing and calling and and for each one of us that still have those out there that we wanted to get a hold of he found them in Glen Rose he found them in the party scene he found those that who who's even had gone down roads that are unimaginable and suffered the unimaginable he's going to get yours too he's going to find yours too and I believe that with my whole heart and and this isn't just a story this is a living testimony of lives dedicated to the Lord Jesus Christ and let's give him a hand again for Sharon y'all y'all can go back to your seats now the last thing that I do want to do um is we we don't have time for a a a long question and answers session but we did think it would be uh uh if there was anybody that had something that maybe in the course of the testimony that you you didn't quite understand or you had a question or something that you thought maybe they could clear up just briefly we want to give you the opportunity if there's somebody that had a question that they'd like Jackson and Laura to answer we're not we're not going to grill them they're not on the witness stand well actually you are you're witnessing right now um but is there we wanted to give that opportunity before we moved on just in case there was um something that you wanted to ask them that just means y'all did a really good job y'all nailed it brother Michael if you'll come man of many hats and and take the service from here and I just want to say I know you were a great blessing in Dallas um to that church and you've been a great blessing to us through the years and Mike made a great point you know maybe you've just come here permanently but you've been part of us for for 18 19 years now and we're blessed to be a part of your testimony and I know that each one here um can say they love you dearly and love your testimony we thank God once again amen amen well why don't we just stand for a moment and uh amen I know you know we talk about the new ones here how many's been here for over 25 years how about that oh brother Tim it's good to have you all right well I know um you know there's there's certainly a lot of of ranges of the time that people have been here and I think one one huge blessing is Sister Lori and uh sister Lor just been so faithful with plain and asked if she could man I um I just there's a song that just says you are worthy of it all and I think when we hear a testimony like this we can just say that song Amen you are worthy of it all you are worthy of it all oh and from you amen and to you are all things you deserve the glory oh just tell them you're worthy you are worthy of it all you are [Music] worthy and from you are all things to you are all things you deserve oh one more time you're worthy Lord you are worthy of it all you are worthy worthy of it all and from you are all things you deserve the glory and thank you Jesus before the Grace that you have given us and though I can repay from my heart oh that I thank you I want to say thank you Jesus oh for the grace that you have given us oh I can repay I like to say [Music]
