[39:21] also and Greater Works than these shall
[39:24] he do because I go unto my father let's
[39:26] look here in 2 Corinthians
[39:29] 61 says we then as workers together with
[39:33] him so notice we're workers together
[39:35] with Christ and in John 14:12 The Works
[39:38] that he did we are to do also says
[39:41] beseech you also that you've received
[39:43] not the grace of God in vain for he
[39:45] saith I have heard thee in in a Time
[39:48] accepted in a day of salvation have I
[39:50] secured thee be behold now is the
[39:54] accepted time behold now is the day of
[39:56] Sal salvation giving no offense in
[39:58] anything that the ministry be not blamed
[40:02] but in all things of proving ourselves
[40:04] as Ministers of God in much patience and
[40:06] afflictions in necessities and distress
[40:09] itties so each of us here tonight have a
[40:12] Ministry within ourselves and that
[40:14] Ministry is to to in Even in our
[40:17] afflictions in our Necessities in our
[40:19] distresses is not to bring any blame to
[40:23] the ministry he says in stripes and in
[40:25] imprisonments in tumults in labors in
[40:28] watchings in fastings by pureness by
[40:31] knowledge by longsuffering by kindness
[40:33] by the Holy Ghost by Love unfeigned by
[40:36] the word of Truth by the power of God by
[40:38] the armor of righteousness on the right
[40:40] hand and on the Left Hand by Honor and
[40:43] dishonor by evil report and good report
[40:46] as deceivers and yet true as unknown and
[40:48] yet well- known as dying and behold we
[40:51] are we live as chasten and not killed as
[40:54] sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor
[40:57] yet making many rich as having nothing
[40:59] and yet possessing all things that's our
[41:03] ministry tonight we find here in 2
[41:05] Corinthians 5: 18 and all things are of
[41:10] God who ha reconciled us to himself by
[41:13] Jesus Christ and has giv us the ministry
[41:16] of reconciliation to it that God was in
[41:20] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[41:22] not imputing their trespasses upon them
[41:25] and had committed unto us the word of
[41:28] reconciliation now then we are
[41:30] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[41:32] beseech You by us we pray you in Christ
[41:35] dead be reconciled to God you can have
[41:38] your seats
[41:40] tonight I want to speak to you tonight
[41:43] Lord willing for a little while and I
[41:45] wrestled over many directions to go here
[41:48] tonight because I have 62 pages and I'm
[41:51] not going to unload 62 pages on you
[41:53] tonight my family yeah that's what they
[41:55] said
[41:57] Glory said please do a part three part
[42:00] four whatever but please don't unload
[42:02] all the hay on the fork tonight I said
[42:03] you got it but I want to look tonight on
[42:07] we will finish it the last time I spoke
[42:09] I spoke about he will finish it and we
[42:11] was referring to Christ but tonight I
[42:13] want to bring it back home to us and I
[42:15] could go many different directions
[42:17] tonight and I believe that from the
[42:18] front end of this it may appear that I
[42:21] kind of was going to title this we have
[42:22] been anointed to finish it and that may
[42:25] be kind of where we lean but we just
[42:26] kind of feel the direction of the Lord
[42:28] but we find here in 2 Corinthians 5 and
[42:30] verse 20 says now we are ambassadors for
[42:33] Christ so what is an ambassador brother
[42:35] Joe the Ambassador is an
[42:38] agean an elder an ambassador means to
[42:41] act as an ambassador sometimes merely to
[42:44] deliver a message for another without
[42:46] being empowered to do anything more than
[42:49] explain or enforce it notice and he's
[42:52] calling us we are ambassadors we are to
[42:55] Proclaim claim not our own ideas not our
[42:58] own thoughts not our own ways but we are
[43:01] to Proclaim his word his thoughts his
[43:04] ideas it's not for you and I to enforce
[43:07] it it's up to him to enforce it but we
[43:10] are his ambassadors that means we are we
[43:13] are on a mission to do the work that
[43:15] he's called us to do and it also here
[43:18] that's uh Bloomfield but also Webster
[43:20] would tell us an ambassador is a
[43:22] minister of the highest rank employed by
[43:26] one Prince or state at the court of
[43:28] another to manage the concerns of his
[43:30] own Prince or state and representing the
[43:34] dignity and the power of His
[43:37] Sovereign we're here to represent him
[43:40] when we start building our own kingdom
[43:42] we're not doing the father's business
[43:44] we're doing our own business but we find
[43:46] that we have been called ambassadors we
[43:48] got our work to do and we're called to
[43:51] not do our own work build our own
[43:53] kingdom build our own church but we're
[43:54] called to build his Kingdom to build his
[43:57] church to glorify his name to lift up
[44:00] his Banner so that he can be received in
[44:03] us and we be received in him notice an
[44:07] ambassador is one that is sent to do
[44:09] what the Sovereign would himself do if
[44:11] he were
[44:12] present see they were sent to make known
[44:15] the will of The Sovereign and to
[44:16] negotiate matters of Commerce of War
[44:19] confused tonight cuz we know that when
[44:21] Jesus bowed his head and he said that it
[44:23] was finished the entire Plan of
[44:25] Redemption was finished right there and
[44:28] everything that that entails was
[44:30] finished right there and brother br will
[44:32] tell us in why had to be a shepherd He
[44:34] says when the Great Shepherd was
[44:39] smitten the great sheep Shepherd or
[44:42] sheep Prophet when he was smitten back
[44:44] there he said it is finished in that
[44:46] minute as soon as the shepherd was
[44:48] smitten it was over sin was settled
[44:50] there was no more sin they were clean
[44:53] the penalty was paid the Believers whose
[44:55] name was written on the Book of Life
[44:57] predestinated from before the
[44:58] foundational world it was finished that
[45:01] very minute that Jesus said it was
[45:04] finished do you believe that he said he
[45:08] the great Shepherd had come for his
[45:10] sheep it was finished God's right hand
[45:12] was pulled from his bosom smitten then
[45:15] on Easter he returned it amen he raised
[45:18] up again to his bosom and he extended it
[45:20] down to you and I in the form of his
[45:22] word to redeem us back to the original
[45:25] Garden from which sin took us from so
[45:28] when he bowed his head and said that it
[45:31] was finished everything that Christ died
[45:35] for the entire Plan of Redemption was
[45:38] finished right there your healing was
[45:40] finished your deliverance was finished
[45:42] your salvation was finished your Holy
[45:45] Ghost was finished your rapture was
[45:47] finished everything that it entails was
[45:50] finished right there and you say well
[45:53] brother Joe why did you preach he will
[45:55] finish it but because we're human right
[45:57] and sometimes we're in the midst of the
[45:59] battle we're in the midst of the trial
[46:01] sickness has ravished our body we begin
[46:03] to wonder God when will you finish
[46:07] this come on somebody work with me
[46:09] tonight we wonder we question God when
[46:12] will you finish this when will you bring
[46:15] my healing to pass when will you deliver
[46:17] me from these tormented when will I
[46:19] receive the Holy Ghost I want you to
[46:21] know that's the human nature but it's
[46:24] already finished he's already started
[46:27] the work and what he started he will
[46:29] finish it and when he bowed his head and
[46:32] he took those nail Prince and he took
[46:34] that Spear and he said it is finished
[46:37] the entire plan Hallelujah of redemption
[46:40] was finished God right there had
[46:42] encapsulated a body and he encapsulated
[46:45] a bride and he finished the work right
[46:48] there and your name was on that book
[46:50] your name was in that Plan of Redemption
[46:53] when he sent Christ to be the lamb slain
[46:55] you were right there with them and when
[46:57] he said it was finished there ain't one
[46:59] here tonight whose name was on that book
[47:01] that won't be finished it's paid for
[47:04] it's a finished work but I want you to
[47:06] know tonight just as he finished the
[47:08] work that was a lot for him we're here
[47:11] to finish the work that's been allotted
[47:12] to us we got a work to do brother and
[47:16] sister we can't just put it all on
[47:20] Christ
[47:22] notice so Jesus had a work
[47:26] and just as he finished a work that was
[47:28] a lot of for him so must we finish the
[47:31] work that was a lot of for us some of
[47:33] you here tonight are sick and body but
[47:35] you got to work to claim your
[47:40] healing to not be discouraged not be
[47:43] dismayed not be uh fearful and fretful
[47:47] but to believe you got a work to
[47:50] do notice Revelations 19 and verse
[47:54] 6 and and I heard as it were a voice of
[47:57] a great multitude and as a voice of many
[48:00] Waters and a voice of Mighty Thunder and
[48:01] saying Allelujah for the Lord God
[48:04] omnipotent
[48:06] reth let us be glad and
[48:09] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[48:12] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[48:15] wife has made herself ready so that
[48:18] phrase made herself ready means to make
[48:21] the necessary
[48:23] preparations She's Not Just twilling her
[48:26] thumbs hoping and waiting pining away
[48:29] one day he's coming no she's making
[48:31] preparations what is she doing she's
[48:33] trying to find what is the things that
[48:35] please him I'm going to do the things
[48:37] that please him I'm going to do the
[48:39] things that make him happy I'm going to
[48:41] do the things that bring attention to
[48:43] myself so that he will desire me
[48:45] otherwise what is she doing she's making
[48:48] the necessary preparations so that she
[48:50] can be received as his wife so that she
[48:52] can be received as the one that has the
[48:55] privilege to to be called Miss Jesus
[48:58] Christ the same character that he had
[49:01] the same spirit that he had the same
[49:03] mind that he had she makes herself ready
[49:07] to be a
[49:10] wife oh come on now some of you young
[49:14] girls tonight are making the necessary
[49:17] preparations to be a wife some of you
[49:20] seven eight years old already got your
[49:21] marriage planned out who's already going
[49:24] to be in your re your wedding reception
[49:27] all the Bridesmaids and who the guy is
[49:29] and you done got his all his guys picked
[49:31] out and the colors and and you're only
[49:34] eight or nine years
[49:36] old oh see you're making
[49:40] preparations we find here in verse eight
[49:43] says and to her was granted that she
[49:45] should be arrayed in fine linen clean
[49:48] and white for the linen are the fine
[49:50] linen is the righteousness of saints and
[49:52] he saith unto me right blessed are they
[49:55] which are called unto the Mary supper of
[49:58] the lamb and he sath unto me these are
[50:01] the true sayings of
[50:02] God that word called there is the Greek
[50:06] word Calo it means to Bear a name or a
[50:10] title so we have been given the title of
[50:16] bride now I I don't want you to let this
[50:19] pass over you because we speak about the
[50:20] bride and we talk about the bride but I
[50:22] want you to understand there is a true
[50:24] distinction from being the church and
[50:27] from being the bride and you must
[50:29] recognize who you are and who you are
[50:31] not you are not the church but you are
[50:34] the bride that means you have been given
[50:36] the
[50:37] responsibility or the privilege to bear
[50:40] that title because why because you have
[50:42] been called out you have been called to
[50:46] the marage supper of the Lamb you have
[50:48] made the necessary preparations and
[50:51] because of that he's called you and he's
[50:53] given you the honor to Bear the title of
[50:58] bride see not everyone can bear this
[51:01] title or this name but it's only for the
[51:03] chosen only for the elect those that
[51:06] were chosen before the foundation of the
[51:08] world in the Rapture message brother BR
[51:11] says the very Word Church means called
[51:13] out as Moses called a nation out of a
[51:16] Nation the holy spirit is calling a
[51:19] bride out of a
[51:22] church how many of you are that bride
[51:24] tonight
[51:26] what a glorious
[51:28] calling to know that that's your
[51:31] distinction to know that you have been
[51:33] called to that
[51:36] honor I flew all the way to Hawaii to
[51:39] propose to my
[51:41] wife you know that was a good thing it
[51:43] was a great feat we've been happily
[51:45] married 21 years at least in my
[51:49] eyes but he left all the
[51:52] glory to come and propose to you yes to
[51:55] send you a message to send you an
[51:57] eleazer to get you
[52:00] ready and that's what he's that's what
[52:02] this message is about is to prepare a
[52:04] bride ready for her
[52:07] husband and just as he finished his work
[52:12] we're going to finish our work yes oh I
[52:15] just love this notice he says now as
[52:17] Moses called a nation out of a Nation
[52:20] the holy spirit is calling the bride out
[52:23] of a church a church out of of a church
[52:25] members from every denomination making
[52:28] up the bride the bride tree how many of
[52:31] you were catholic or come from a
[52:32] Catholic Family what about Methodist
[52:35] Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal we come
[52:39] from all some of you many of us are
[52:41] message but it's got to be more than
[52:43] just message by denomination or message
[52:46] by title we're message because why
[52:48] because we're Pentecostal by
[52:50] experience and we're messaged by
[52:52] experience not by some title not because
[52:55] because we just believe God sent a
[52:56] prophet and we believe the teachings of
[52:58] a prophet but we're message we're we're
[53:00] Pentecostal because we had a Pentecostal
[53:03] experience we' met a living God and he's
[53:06] alive in us and it's not us that liveth
[53:08] but Christ that liveth in us and the
[53:10] life I live I live now for for
[53:13] him notice now he said a bride coming
[53:17] out call and that's the one the brid
[53:20] tree is the bride rather is the one
[53:22] that's going to be in the Rapture that
[53:24] alone nothing but the bride the elected
[53:27] ones forn by God from the beginning the
[53:30] father's spiritual genes so this title
[53:34] of
[53:35] bride is only for the elected ones
[53:39] because he's only coming for that
[53:42] one when I proposed to Jessica and we
[53:45] came and we we consummated our wedding
[53:48] vows I wasn't expecting two or three
[53:51] ladies up here that I was going to
[53:52] choose at that moment I'd made my choice
[53:55] I've made my
[53:56] decision and so has Christ made his
[53:59] decision he's made his choice and that
[54:02] choice is you and I and many Believers
[54:05] around the world tonight who are
[54:07] privileged to Bear the title of Miss
[54:10] Jesus
[54:11] Christ Revelations 2 and verse1 17 says
[54:14] he that hath his ear let him hear what
[54:17] the spirit saith unto the churches to
[54:19] him that overcometh will I give to eat
[54:23] of the Hidden mana and will give him a
[54:25] white stone and in a stone a new name
[54:27] written which no man knoweth saving he
[54:30] that receiveth it now Jesus is the
[54:34] hidden
[54:35] Mana Christ is the church's Mana this is
[54:37] from question and answers 1961 what is
[54:40] mana mana is the Old Testament was what
[54:42] got came down from heaven fresh every
[54:44] night to sustain the church in his
[54:46] journey he says now in the New Testament
[54:48] what is hidden Mana a little while the
[54:50] world seeth me no more hidden yet you
[54:53] shall see me I'll be with you even in
[54:55] you to the end of the world and Christ
[54:57] is the hidden Mana that comes from God
[55:00] out of Heaven aresh every day every day
[55:03] says oh we can't say well two weeks ago
[55:06] I had a great experience with God but
[55:07] what about right now well you know at
[55:10] Easter Camp I had a great meeting and
[55:12] experience with God or at Ohio Ohio
[55:14] Youth Camp I had a great experience with
[55:17] God but what about tonight what about
[55:19] this day what about this week what about
[55:21] where your experience that day it's got
[55:23] to be a freshh up to dat to experience
[55:26] each and every day if we plan on
[55:28] finishing the work that's a lot for us
[55:30] we can't just rely on something of
[55:32] yesterday we can't rely on an experience
[55:35] of of of a camp meeting last week or
[55:37] last year or whatever or your mom or
[55:40] dad's experience you got to have your
[55:42] very own uptodate genuine Pentecostal
[55:45] Born Again sin killing sky blue God call
[55:49] to experience each and every day Church
[55:51] to make it out of
[55:53] here now notice now he says every day
[55:56] fresh a new blessing a new something
[55:59] coming from God the hidden Mana coming
[56:01] down from God out of heaven and we Feast
[56:04] upon this Mana which is Christ and he
[56:06] sustains us through the Journey till we
[56:09] reach the land to the other
[56:11] side so to the Overcomer has been given
[56:15] the right to Feast on hidden Mana or let
[56:19] me say it like this to the
[56:21] Overcomer in each age has been given the
[56:24] right to to Feast on the message of that
[56:27] age and to Feast on the hidden Mana of
[56:31] that age she's been given a right to
[56:34] receive of the mysteries of God because
[56:37] the mysteries of God are only going to
[56:38] be revealed to an elect group of people
[56:41] so the hidden Mana that's revealed to
[56:43] the Overcomer is the word for their day
[56:47] and so we find now that this is a
[56:50] special group and this group has been
[56:52] given a white stone which is a pure
[56:54] revelation in a pure a pure word which
[56:57] means it tells them who their name is
[57:00] their name is in that Revelation because
[57:02] I can't tell you you had the Holy Ghost
[57:04] brother L but you know
[57:07] yes the Bible says you get a new name
[57:09] which no man knoweth but saving he but

[57:15] can't tell you you got it I can't tell
[57:17] you you you don't have it you have to
[57:19] have that personal pure Revelation a
[57:22] white stone and in that stone a new name

[57:27] old name of Aaron Oglesby that old name
[57:29] of el lell that old name that old
[57:32] personality that old nature no that old
[57:34] Nature has to be shooked away and God
[57:36] gives you a new revelation that you come

[59:09] that what I mean you people I'm going to
[59:11] call you
[59:13] bride so that you'll understand it so
[59:17] notice right here in the first seal he

[59:20] distinction we put our own words to it
[59:23] as ministers and we say I know longer
[59:25] call you church but I'll call you bride
[59:28] CU that's essentially what God was doing
[59:31] he was causing a distinction calling a
[59:34] bride out of a
[59:36] church you say brother Joe why are you
[59:38] laboring this cuz I'm trying to show you
[59:40] who you are so you understand you're

[59:46] doubt that you can finish what he's what
[59:47] you started but if you know who you are
[59:50] you know whose you are and you know that
[59:52] you're one in Christ and just as he
[59:54] finish you will finish so I'm going to
[59:56] labor this evening just on this little
[59:58] bit CU I want you to know who you are
[1:00:00] tonight that we are the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:03] Christ I didn't call you bride brother

[1:00:09] whoever brother bradam we didn't call
[1:00:11] your bride but God Almighty he come down
[1:00:13] through a prophet's voice and he says I
[1:00:15] want you to catch who you are tonight I
[1:00:18] want to cause the distinction tonight
[1:00:19] he's notied in paraphrasing I will no
[1:00:22] longer call you a church but I'm call
[1:00:24] calling your bride I'm causing a
[1:00:26] distinction I'm calling a bride out of a
[1:00:28] church I'm calling people out of a
[1:00:30] denomination I'm calling my sons and
[1:00:32] daughters they're going to come from
[1:00:33] every Walk of Life some's going to come
[1:00:35] from the streets fam many are going to
[1:00:37] come from the houses of God but yet God
[1:00:39] is doing the work God is doing the
[1:00:41] calling and he's calling the bride for
[1:00:42] this hour somebody that'll receive a
[1:00:45] message and be transformed by the word
[1:00:47] of
[1:00:48] God
[1:00:50] hallu
[1:00:53] now inside of each of us
[1:00:56] tonight the material lays within you to
[1:01:03] finish I know you look in the mirror and
[1:01:05] you see
[1:01:09] failures but in you right now who has
[1:01:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:01:14] tonight everything the prophet of God
[1:01:17] said everything that you need in this
[1:01:19] journey is in you right then when you
[1:01:23] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:01:24] you don't need no more faith you got it
[1:01:27] it's there there ain't nothing that
[1:01:29] you're lacking it's there everything
[1:01:31] that we have need up in this journey and
[1:01:34] some of you it's been a long journey but
[1:01:36] you're still here you're still on the
[1:01:39] road you're still traveling you're still
[1:01:41] believing you're still
[1:01:43] finishing notice now he says we know
[1:01:46] that there's going to be a bride this
[1:01:47] isn't the marriage of the lamb and
[1:01:49] there's going to be a wedding supper
[1:01:50] served in the
[1:01:52] skies that's just as sure to be as God
[1:01:56] is because it's his
[1:01:58] word and we know that those that are
[1:02:00] going to make up the bride is going to
[1:02:02] be his church and they're going to be
[1:02:03] they're going to appear before him
[1:02:05] without a spot or wrinkle notice and
[1:02:08] they have the material on earth now to
[1:02:10] make themselves
[1:02:13] ready if you notice it said that she had
[1:02:16] made herself ready so the material they
[1:02:21] have we have the material right now
[1:02:26] we have over 1200 sermons we have the
[1:02:29] Bible
[1:02:31] unadulterated word of God we have
[1:02:34] everything that we need all the material
[1:02:37] to make ourselves ready if you're not
[1:02:40] ready it's because you're not making the
[1:02:42] necessary
[1:02:44] preparations see everything that we have
[1:02:47] need of is already there 1 Corinthians 3
[1:02:50] and verse 9 so we have something to do
[1:02:53] Church
[1:02:54] amen the Bible says for we are laborers
[1:02:57] together with
[1:03:00] God 1 Corinthians 15 verse 58 therefore
[1:03:04] my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast
[1:03:06] unmovable always abounding in the work
[1:03:10] of the Lord so we got to be about the
[1:03:12] father's business not our own
[1:03:15] business we find here as a bride we got
[1:03:18] to make the necessary preparations we
[1:03:19] have a work to do we must be fellow
[1:03:21] laborers with him we got to remain
[1:03:23] unmovable in the work of the lord we
[1:03:26] must
[1:03:27] overcome come on right otherwise it
[1:03:31] takes an effort to overcome how many
[1:03:33] believe that some of you Elder folks
[1:03:36] tonight you understand the effort it
[1:03:38] takes to overcome to continue to serve
[1:03:41] and to to continue to press to battle
[1:03:43] through many hard and difficult
[1:03:45] trials see it takes an effort to
[1:03:48] overcome it takes determination to
[1:03:50] overcome it takes perseverance to
[1:03:53] overcome and it takes
[1:03:56] work it takes work to overcome listen
[1:03:59] what brother Brown says in the marriage
[1:04:01] of the Lamb he says so many says well if
[1:04:03] the Lord will take this evil spirit from
[1:04:05] me from drinking or from gambling or
[1:04:07] from lying or stealing I'll serve him he
[1:04:10] said but that's he said but that's up to
[1:04:13] you and we want God to do all the work
[1:04:16] but what about us we got a work to do we
[1:04:20] got to finish it he's done his part we
[1:04:23] got to do our part heart that's right he
[1:04:26] says you see you got something to do
[1:04:28] they that overcame shall inherit all
[1:04:30] things they that overcome you had the
[1:04:33] power to do it but you must be willing
[1:04:35] to lay it
[1:04:38] down she has made herself ready brother
[1:04:41] sister I like that word you see God
[1:04:43] could not push us through a little pipe
[1:04:45] pull us out on the other end and then
[1:04:47] saying blessed is he that overcome you
[1:04:50] had nothing to overcome he just pushed
[1:04:53] you through
[1:04:55] and many times that's what we want God
[1:04:58] take this from me God do this God you
[1:05:01] know you see the trial just make it easy
[1:05:03] God push me through the pipe pull me out
[1:05:06] the other side let it all be God and we
[1:05:08] give God the glory and God's just
[1:05:09] waiting on
[1:05:11] us God's waiting on us to do something
[1:05:14] to prove that we are in fact Believers
[1:05:17] notice but you got to make decisions for
[1:05:19] yourself I got to make decisions for
[1:05:21] myself and in doing that we show our
[1:05:24] faith in our respects to God so we
[1:05:27] question why do we have
[1:05:29] trials cuz God's got a pipe for
[1:05:33] you God's got a pipe for you and you're
[1:05:36] going to get through it you may go
[1:05:39] kicking you may go screaming you may go
[1:05:42] clawing but you're going to go through
[1:05:44] it because I'm looking at Overcomers
[1:05:47] tonight I'm preaching to Overcomers
[1:05:49] people that are not just expecting God
[1:05:51] to do it all but God help me to do my
[1:05:53] part
[1:05:55] he says Abraham was promised a child but
[1:05:58] he must maintain his promise for 25
[1:06:00] years notice Abraham had to hold on for
[1:06:03] 25 years you talking about some ups and
[1:06:07] downs some dips and valleys some
[1:06:10] struggles some mind battles yes sir he
[1:06:13] wasn't getting any older his body was
[1:06:15] dying by the day her womb was already
[1:06:18] dead how in the world is this going to
[1:06:20] come to pass but he said for 25 years he
[1:06:23] must maintain
[1:06:24] must maintain the promise through all
[1:06:27] the ups and downs that he held the
[1:06:28] Temptations in those 25 years but he
[1:06:31] held to the Word of
[1:06:33] Promise and we've been waiting on a
[1:06:35] Rapture we've been waiting on a body
[1:06:38] change but one day brother and sister
[1:06:39] it's going to happen somebody is going
[1:06:42] to finish it they're going to be the
[1:06:45] manifestation of the word that's been
[1:06:47] revealed for this
[1:06:48] hour one day we're going to see loved
[1:06:50] ones walk through the door and I pray
[1:06:53] hey we're going to have to change
[1:06:54] service time between 6:00 and 9: cuz
[1:06:55] that's when it's going to
[1:06:58] happen it's 11:00 12:00 bit ain't going
[1:07:00] to cut it we're going to be already
[1:07:02] gone but one day between 600 and 9 we're
[1:07:05] going to see loved ones come walking
[1:07:07] through and we're going to know it's on
[1:07:08] at that point see we're going to finish
[1:07:11] the work that's been alloted for us
[1:07:13] we're going to finish the scriptures
[1:07:15] that are responsible for the bride we're
[1:07:18] going to finish our work cuz we've been
[1:07:21] anointed to finish cuz I'm sure showing
[1:07:24] you now who you are and by knowing who
[1:07:27] you are then you know who you are not
[1:07:29] and you can't be confused wondering what
[1:07:32] if I will how I will you just worry
[1:07:35] about rest on

[1:07:39] Promised Land but they had to fight for
[1:07:41] every
[1:07:43] inch you know sometimes we we brag about
[1:07:45] wanting to be Fighters and we fight and
[1:07:47] we fight and my goodness we fight in the
[1:07:50] backyard but in the front yard we

[1:08:12] ground no wherever the soldier a foot
[1:08:15] tread upon he said that I've given you
[1:08:17] God said to Joshua it was all there the
[1:08:19] land was there God gave it to them but

[1:08:36] it's time that we fight don't be afraid
[1:08:38] to
[1:08:39] fight the Bible tells us the violent
[1:08:41] take it by
[1:08:43] force they're
[1:08:45] Fighters so this word I look this word
[1:08:48] up cuz you hear it all the time you got
[1:08:50] to fight for something you ever heard
[1:08:52] that you got to fight for something or
[1:08:54] someone so that means to fight in honor
[1:08:57] of someone well we're fighting in honor
[1:08:59] of the king tonight I'm not fighting in
[1:09:01] honor of some movie star I'm not
[1:09:03] fighting in honor of some ball star I
[1:09:05] remember when I was in high school in
[1:09:07] junior high somebody pick on one of your
[1:09:09] buddies you go to fight for him well I
[1:09:11] ain't fighting for my buddy tonight but
[1:09:13] I'm fighting for the body of Christ
[1:09:15] tonight and that's what we do brother
[1:09:17] Aaron and I brother Tim and brother
[1:09:18] Timothy and other ministers when we
[1:09:20] study we get into that word cuz we're
[1:09:22] fighting for you we're fighting for your
[1:09:24] families we're fighting for your
[1:09:25] marriages we're fighting for your
[1:09:27] healing we're fighting for your
[1:09:28] deliverance we're fighting for your
[1:09:30] sanity we are fighting to elevate your
[1:09:32] faith so you can in fact believe what
[1:09:35] the word says about you that you know
[1:09:37] who you are and that you've been
[1:09:39] anointed in this hour to finish the work
[1:09:41] that's been allotted for
[1:09:44] you notice to fight in honor of someone
[1:09:47] or something to struggle to gain or
[1:09:49] secure someone or something to go to
[1:09:52] battle for the bus benefit of someone or
[1:09:55] something to fight for something I don't
[1:09:58] know what you're here for tonight
[1:10:00] probably because we have to have church
[1:10:02] on Wednesday night but you're fighting I
[1:10:04] hope you're fighting for something
[1:10:06] that's bigger than
[1:10:07] you fighting for a cause that's bigger
[1:10:10] than you bigger than your own
[1:10:13] ideas bigger than your own
[1:10:17] agenda brother man says I've been behind
[1:10:19] the pull pit going on 31 years and every
[1:10:22] inch of that has been fight constantly
[1:10:25] he contended and contended and contended
[1:10:28] for the
[1:10:29] faith he stood when many of his own
[1:10:32] contemporaries turned their back on him
[1:10:35] he stood for Divine Healing but more
[1:10:37] importantly he stood that God was going
[1:10:39] to Rapture a
[1:10:41] church he stood between the church and
[1:10:44] the
[1:10:44] bride and he was calling out when the
[1:10:48] church was saying we're all
[1:10:50] one but he knew there was a distinction
[1:10:53] in and he was contending for he was
[1:10:55] fighting for 30 years behind the pulpit
[1:10:57] in the ministry and he said every bit of
[1:11:00] it has been a fight constant it
[1:11:01] certainly has but we must fight if we
[1:11:04] should
[1:11:05] Reign so we find out that the bride has
[1:11:08] to make herself ready be willing to lay
[1:11:11] aside every weight that does so easily
[1:11:13] beset us that we might run with patience
[1:11:15] the race that's set before us we must
[1:11:18] lay them aside
[1:11:20] ourself so your biggest hindrance is
[1:11:25] yourself so you got to lay yourself your
[1:11:28] ideas your thoughts
[1:11:31] aside every sin I'm not saying you're a
[1:11:34] sinner I'm not saying you're a sinful
[1:11:35] but when your thoughts exhort over the
[1:11:38] thoughts of God or the word of God then
[1:11:40] it becomes sin and you must lay those
[1:11:43] things aside see you come lay them aside
[1:11:45] we got to do that ourselves so if we're
[1:11:47] to fight for the cause of Christ if
[1:11:49] we're going to hold the banner of this
[1:11:50] mess as a word then we got to lay down
[1:11:54] everything that's not like God and we
[1:11:56] must be willing to fight make ourselves
[1:11:59] ready fight and be battle ready fight to
[1:12:01] be word ready fight to be Rapture Ready
[1:12:05] sir Revelations 19:7 says let us be glad
[1:12:09] and rejoice and give honor to him notice
[1:12:11] for the marriages
[1:12:15] come there's no longer waiting and
[1:12:18] waiting for that day the marriage is
[1:12:21] come and now the bride has made herself
[1:12:24] ready his wife has made herself ready
[1:12:27] brother says in the birth pain said the
[1:12:28] Bible said that his wife has made her
[1:12:31] self ready at the End of the Age how did
[1:12:34] she make herself ready to becoming his
[1:12:37] wife what does she do what kind of
[1:12:41] garment she had on his own word he says
[1:12:44] what kind of garment she had on his own
[1:12:46] word she was dressed in his own
[1:12:49] righteousness so she's not dressed in
[1:12:51] her own ideas ideology she's not dressed
[1:12:54] in Traditions of man man-made Creeds
[1:12:56] man-made religions she's dressed in his
[1:12:59] word she's dressed not in her she's
[1:13:02] dressed herself in the message of the
[1:13:04] hour which is him which is his word so
[1:13:06] we find that the Bride of each age
[1:13:08] dressed herself in the word of that
[1:13:12] age and she received the messenger of
[1:13:15] that age so what the word speaks of him
[1:13:18] also speaks of
[1:13:20] her for the two have now become one so
[1:13:25] you can't say something about me but
[1:13:26] what you offend my wife and you can't
[1:13:29] say something about my wife but what you
[1:13:31] offend me and you can't say anything
[1:13:33] about his bride but what you offend him
[1:13:36] and when you touch her you touch the
[1:13:39] apple of his
[1:13:41] eye that's the Center focus of his
[1:13:44] thinking oh Church don't you see how
[1:13:47] special you are how do you think you
[1:13:50] can't
[1:13:51] win you can't lose that's right you
[1:13:55] can't lose we're going to finish and I'm
[1:13:58] going to tell you we're going to finish
[1:14:00] strong we're going to finish Mighty
[1:14:03] we're not going to go down barely
[1:14:05] scraping by G crawling through the door
[1:14:07] trying to get in we are going to finish
[1:14:10] this
[1:14:12] fight notice
[1:14:15] now brother B says but the spirit that
[1:14:18] was in him he sent back down to the
[1:14:22] church so the church when this Covenant
[1:14:25] is brought into full strength when the
[1:14:27] Covenant is confirmed with God the
[1:14:28] church the people that goes into this
[1:14:31] body here to be his bride will be
[1:14:33] exactly the same spirit that was upon
[1:14:37] Christ now for those that have a problem
[1:14:39] with emotion those that have a problem
[1:14:41] with signs and wonders those that have a
[1:14:43] problem with the supernatural then you
[1:14:44] got a problem with this quote yes
[1:14:47] because the people that goes into the
[1:14:50] body to be his bride will be exactly The
[1:14:54] Same Spirit that was upon Christ notice
[1:14:56] now doing the same things the same
[1:14:59] Ministry the same power and it will come
[1:15:03] together and be word by word the same
[1:15:06] confirming the
[1:15:08] Covenant see you find to there's
[1:15:10] minister they refuse they don't want to
[1:15:12] testify what God is doing or what God
[1:15:15] has done they feel like if they testify
[1:15:17] then they're pulling something away from
[1:15:19] brother brandom or they're pulling
[1:15:20] something away from Christ you're not
[1:15:22] pulling anything away from brother
[1:15:24] Brandon to testify of the miraculous
[1:15:26] Supernatural power of God his great hand
[1:15:29] to deliver to to heal of cancer or
[1:15:31] whatever it may be to call prodical back
[1:15:33] home that's not pulling anything away
[1:15:35] from a prophet that's not pulling
[1:15:37] anything away from Jesus Christ that is
[1:15:39] proof that the word works that is proof
[1:15:42] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:15:45] forever that is proof that you are Miss
[1:15:48] Jesus Christ for the spirit that was in
[1:15:50] him is now in you confirming the word
[1:15:53] word with signs and wonders it's proof
[1:15:55] Church don't be afraid to declare what
[1:15:58] God has done in even like Tabernacle
[1:16:00] don't be afraid to declare the
[1:16:01] miraculous power of almighty God it is
[1:16:04] proof that this message is real and God
[1:16:06] is here and he's transforming life and
[1:16:09] he's calling out of people God is here
[1:16:11] doing that man ain't called you God has
[1:16:14] called you God is declaring this work
[1:16:16] with signs and wonders following the
[1:16:21] ministry it's proof that the ministry
[1:16:23] Min that was in Christ and operated
[1:16:24] through his Prophet is the same Ministry
[1:16:28] that's in operation through his
[1:16:30] bride same signs same Wonder same word
[1:16:34] same in every detail except one part the
[1:16:38] Corporal
[1:16:39] body that's the only difference see it's
[1:16:43] proof that the bride has become one with
[1:16:45] the groom doing the same thing same
[1:16:47] Ministry same power word by word the
[1:16:51] same confirm confirming the Covenant so
[1:16:55] if your life is not producing any signs
[1:16:58] any wonders any miraculous any
[1:17:01] Supernatural then you are not in
[1:17:03] Covenant because the Bible says these
[1:17:05] signs will follow shall follow the
[1:17:09] believer now I'm not to say that
[1:17:11] everybody's going to do Supernatural
[1:17:13] things but the signs will be among the
[1:17:17] Believers the nine spiritual gifts will
[1:17:19] be in operation in every local Assembly
[1:17:22] not every church is going to have the
[1:17:24] fivefold but every church will have the
[1:17:26] nine spiritual gifts notice
[1:17:30] now excuse me here he said God cannot
[1:17:34] change he's unchangeable God times
[1:17:36] change people change God is infinite he
[1:17:38] cannot change he must remain the same
[1:17:40] yesterday today and forever he must
[1:17:42] always remain and if we believe this to
[1:17:44] be the word of God we can put our
[1:17:46] confidence on anything that he says so
[1:17:49] it's proof church it's proof
[1:17:53] that he hasn't changed when he's doing
[1:17:56] the same things today that he did then
[1:17:58] is proof that he's the
[1:18:00] same and it's proof that you're a bride
[1:18:03] because he's only going to do it through
[1:18:05] his
[1:18:08] body brother said he took Christ which
[1:18:10] is a seat of Abraham on Calvary he tore
[1:18:13] him apart he took the spirit off of him
[1:18:15] he put his body in the grave his soul in
[1:18:16] the hell raised him up on the third day
[1:18:18] raised his body brought it up to Glory
[1:18:21] there he sent Spirit back down kept the
[1:18:23] body at the right hand his side he said
[1:18:25] he sent the spirit back down to live in
[1:18:27] a church to make the church just so much
[1:18:30] with the Life of Christ that in the
[1:18:32] Resurrection the two will come together
[1:18:34] bride and bridegroom the church and
[1:18:36] Christ will be exactly alike with the
[1:18:39] same kind of ministry oh my so the bride
[1:18:45] has a
[1:18:47] Ministry yes sir well I thought that was
[1:18:49] just for brother Aaron Brother him
[1:18:53] brother Donnie these Great Men of God
[1:18:55] that we we set on pedestals because we
[1:18:57] reverenced them because of the gift that
[1:18:59] God's placed in our life now the
[1:19:02] bride unequivocally the bride has a
[1:19:09] Ministry notice now he says but when the
[1:19:12] current is Flowing freely the word of
[1:19:14] God it expresses itself The Works that I
[1:19:17] do shall you do
[1:19:19] also and in the last days it shall come
[1:19:22] to pass behold I'll send Elijah the
[1:19:24] prophet and he shall turn the hearts of
[1:19:25] the children back to the faith of the
[1:19:27] fathers and in there there would be a
[1:19:30] Time come forth when we we could express
[1:19:33] himself or when he could express himself
[1:19:35] in the fullness of his godhead deity
[1:19:38] through his church to have preeminence
[1:19:41] in his church that's what he's looking
[1:19:44] for is preeminence that word preminent
[1:19:45] means to have first
[1:19:48] place first in everything first in
[1:19:51] importance first in honor first first in
[1:19:54] exaltation that's what he wants in your
[1:19:57] life to be first first before the video
[1:20:00] games first for the YouTube for the
[1:20:02] reals for the Tik toks for all these
[1:20:04] other things that consume your time he
[1:20:07] wants to preeminence and let me just say
[1:20:08] it he will have preeminence in his
[1:20:12] bride I'm not saying you can't do human
[1:20:15] human things but he will have first
[1:20:17] place in your
[1:20:19] life okay notice now now see the
[1:20:23] anointed Anointed with the word no let
[1:20:26] me go back excuse me let me back up and
[1:20:28] there there would be a Time come forth
[1:20:30] when he could express himself in the
[1:20:32] fullness of his godhead deity through
[1:20:34] his church have preeminence in his
[1:20:36] church oh my what the anointed man now
[1:20:39] the anointed
[1:20:41] people see we've been anointed to finish
[1:20:44] now the anointed people oh my to bring
[1:20:46] back that anointed bride and bridegroom
[1:20:49] anointed by why accepting what Eve
[1:20:52] turned down and Adam coming back with
[1:20:55] the anointing of the word because he
[1:20:57] said my word is spirit see Anointed with
[1:21:00] the word when Eve turned down he comes
[1:21:03] back and we accept so that's what we've
[1:21:06] accepted we've accepted our part of the
[1:21:10] ministry to fulfill the part that he
[1:21:13] didn't
[1:21:14] fulfill they said brother branam
[1:21:17] question and answers would the bride of
[1:21:20] Christ would the bride of Christ have a
[1:21:21] Ministry before for the
[1:21:24] Rapture he says sure that's what's going
[1:21:27] on right
[1:21:28] now I think this is a beautiful
[1:21:31] quote sure that's what's going on right
[1:21:33] now the bride of Christ certainly it's
[1:21:35] the message of the
[1:21:38] hour see the bride of Christ sure she
[1:21:41] consists of Apostles prophets teachers
[1:21:43] evangelist pastors is that right that's
[1:21:45] the bride of Christ sure she's got a
[1:21:47] Ministry a great
[1:21:49] ministry it's a Min it's the ministry of
[1:21:52] the hour and it'll be so humble so we
[1:21:55] have a work we have a Ministry it has to
[1:21:58] be because a woman and her husband
[1:22:00] become one they become one so does the
[1:22:03] bride and Christ become one the ministry
[1:22:05] of the bride and the ministry of Christ
[1:22:08] is the
[1:22:09] same so when God calls a man he calls
[1:22:13] his
[1:22:15] wife and when God's
[1:22:17] called when he sent Christ to do the
[1:22:20] work of redemption he didn't do it just
[1:22:21] for the sheer pack of dying on the cross
[1:22:23] he did it for his wife he did it to pay
[1:22:27] the penalty that we couldn't pay so we
[1:22:30] find here he says now
[1:22:32] notice and the world is falling apart he
[1:22:34] said the hour that we're living in oh
[1:22:36] God the world is falling apart they in
[1:22:38] the hangers there hangs in the hangers
[1:22:40] bombs there's there's hangs to things
[1:22:43] just to be exactly the church is ready
[1:22:46] she sealed in ready to come there will
[1:22:48] be a great outpouring of the
[1:22:51] spirit
[1:22:53] notice the church is ready she's sealed
[1:22:55] in ready to come he said there will be a
[1:22:57] great outpouring of the spirit yes sir
[1:23:00] to grab that church or take her into the
[1:23:02] skies exactly because see the church the
[1:23:05] word the bride see in Christ to Ministry
[1:23:08] his ministry is in his bride which is
[1:23:11] his body the celestial body you see mean
[1:23:13] when I say the supernatural body of of
[1:23:16] his here on the supernatural body on the
[1:23:18] earth his spirit is is in there living
[1:23:21] his life right out until him and the
[1:23:23] church becomes one in the wedding see
[1:23:26] they become one he takes them just a
[1:23:29] little minority in the last days but see
[1:23:31] his ministry is in the ministry of his
[1:23:35] bride he says but before at this time
[1:23:38] there's going to be a great outpouring
[1:23:40] of the spirit see a great outpouring
[1:23:42] that's what we've been witnessing today
[1:23:44] is a great outpouring of signs and
[1:23:46] wonders of the
[1:23:48] Supernatural Supernatural outpouring not
[1:23:50] only in this church even life but in
[1:23:52] many churches around the world a great
[1:23:54] outpouring of the spirit of God not just
[1:23:56] in word but in manifestation in signs
[1:23:59] and wonders prodical are coming home
[1:24:01] sick have been healed demons have been
[1:24:03] cast out families have been restored
[1:24:06] Hearts have been discerned Church
[1:24:07] situations have been
[1:24:09] discerned my wife and I were just over
[1:24:12] in Belgium and I got a testimony from
[1:24:13] the service from one of the brothers
[1:24:15] just a couple days after we got home he
[1:24:17] said I just wanted to let you know that
[1:24:19] God used you beyond you could ever
[1:24:21] imagine last WI
[1:24:23] day this morning a brother in the church
[1:24:25] asked for forgiveness to the whole
[1:24:28] church the day before you preached he
[1:24:30] had this meeting with the pastor today
[1:24:33] he testified and he said it seemed like
[1:24:35] brother Joe was in that meeting too how
[1:24:37] scripture was repeated exactly the same
[1:24:40] like the day before he said a lot of
[1:24:42] lives have been
[1:24:43] impacted when I woke up that morning
[1:24:46] there was a Wednesday morning I woke up
[1:24:47] and I my wife can tell you I wrestled
[1:24:50] and wrestled and wrestled with the
[1:24:51] thought that that I was being led to
[1:24:53] preach I'm like why are you wanting me
[1:24:55] to preach this
[1:24:56] here I mean this is not a sermon for
[1:24:59] overseas this is not a sermon for I want
[1:25:01] to be an evangelist I want to rip you
[1:25:03] know rip it up but it wasn't that type
[1:25:06] of sermon our preach a message on
[1:25:09] finding forgiveness in the midst of pain
[1:25:11] and it was exactly what the church
[1:25:14] needed see because that's the great
[1:25:17] outpouring of the Supernatural That's
[1:25:19] the great outpouring of the spirit of
[1:25:21] God it may be in all the emotion it may
[1:25:24] be in all the hurah we had a a
[1:25:26] magnificent service there with Brother
[1:25:28] David mayor the Sunday following and God
[1:25:30] came down and done many mighty works
[1:25:32] there great miraculous signs wers many
[1:25:35] sick were healed and different things of
[1:25:36] that nature but yet in this service
[1:25:38] unexpected place in an unexpected way
[1:25:41] God brought down and healed the church
[1:25:43] body because there was things going on
[1:25:45] and for a man to get up in front of the
[1:25:47] entire church and ask forgiveness that's
[1:25:50] nothing but the hand of God a super
[1:25:53] outpouring and that's what we can expect
[1:25:55] from the ministry of the Bride for the
[1:25:57] ministry of the bride and the ministry
[1:25:59] of Christ are one in the same church he
[1:26:01] is still a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:26:03] intents of the heart and he is still
[1:26:05] here moving and working in situations
[1:26:08] and families and homes and lives he is
[1:26:10] still God and the work that he did we're
[1:26:13] here to finish the work for
[1:26:17] us notice let me figure out a place to
[1:26:20] start bringing this down
[1:26:23] I didn't say I was bringing it down
[1:26:24] figure out a place to
[1:26:26] start brother BR says when he begins to
[1:26:29] reveal himself into the seed form again
[1:26:31] the same one that went into the ground
[1:26:33] come back to be the bride just the bride
[1:26:36] in the groom is the same Flesh and Blood
[1:26:38] the same Ministry the same things doing
[1:26:40] just exactly what he done I'm so sick
[1:26:44] and tired of hearing these men preach a
[1:26:47] an emotionless religion preaching
[1:26:49] there's no power preaching there's no we
[1:26:51] got the authority of of the word of God
[1:26:53] to have the same signs the same wonders
[1:26:55] the same Supernatural to lay hands on
[1:26:57] the sick and expect God to recover
[1:27:00] expecting to be healed expect prodical
[1:27:03] to come home expect the supernatural we
[1:27:05] got to right why because we got the same
[1:27:07] Ministry Jesus never walked up to the
[1:27:09] blinded eyes and wondered who he was or
[1:27:11] wonder could this be wonder if it was
[1:27:13] going to happen he knew who he was he
[1:27:16] knew he was called he knew he was
[1:27:18] anointed and we have been anointed
[1:27:20] Church to do the very same thing the
[1:27:22] same Ministry that was in him is the
[1:27:24] same ministry that's an operation in the
[1:27:27] bride today don't you fear to lay hands
[1:27:29] on the sick don't you fear to ask God
[1:27:31] anything for the ministry of the Bride
