TRANSCRIPT
========================================
When the spirit of God is so far into the church that they know nothing about casting out devils, they know nothing about the spirit of God moving. They know nothing about the Holy Ghost and a genuine in infilling. When it gets to that place, they have a name that they're living but are dead. I want to know, are you a Christian by name only? Are you a message believer by name only? If the veil was open in your heart, is the pillar of fire there? I want to know, are you living on past reputations when he raised down his hand for me? [Music] or are you living on past reputations [Music] or what you once were? Have you lost that first love has murmuring got in your heart and you no longer can break the bread with singleness of heart and unity of the spirit. He's reaching down for you today. Let him speak. Let him talk to you in a personal way and you examine your life. Where am I? If the voice would change, if it would change from the voice to the trumpet, would you hear the call? Are you a bride prepared to meet the bridegroom? Or is there things in your life you just really need to deal with to be zealous and repent when he reached down his hand for me. I'm so thankful he did. He's reaching down this. [Music] Well, I was lost. I was undone without God. [Music] One more time. Sing it. Is your wall on the altar? Is the murmur gone out of your heart? Are you still just worried about clicks and clams and everything else rather than the sweetness of the Holy Spirit that makes us all? Is it time to really dedicate your life a new or maybe dedicated for the first time? This altar is open. You are invited. The spirit of the bride say, "Come." When he reached down his hand for me, when he reached way down for me. [Music] Well, I was lost. I was undone. God bless you, son. There's more. There's more. Just find your place there.
