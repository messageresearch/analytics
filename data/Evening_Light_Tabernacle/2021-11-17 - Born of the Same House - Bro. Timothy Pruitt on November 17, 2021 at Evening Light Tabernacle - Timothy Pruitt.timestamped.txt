[39:24] bring healing deliverance to salvation
[39:26] father by your word
[39:29] we ask it in jesus name
[39:31] amen
[39:34] let's turn to hebrews
[39:36] chapter 6 and verse 13.
[39:47] amen
[39:52] it says for when god made the promise to
[39:54] abraham because he could swear by no
[39:57] greater
[39:58] he swore by himself
[40:01] saying surely blessing
[40:03] i will bless thee and multiply
[40:06] i will multiply thee
[40:08] so and so after he had patiently endured
[40:11] he obtained the promise
[40:13] for men verily swear by the greater an
[40:16] oath for confirmation is to them an end
[40:18] to of all strife
[40:20] wherein god willing more abundantly to
[40:22] show into the heirs of the promise
[40:24] the immutability of his counsel
[40:26] confirmed it by an oath
[40:29] that by two immutable things
[40:31] in which it is impossible for god to lie
[40:35] we might have a strong consolation
[40:38] who have fled for refuge to lay hold
[40:40] upon the hope set before us
[40:43] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[40:45] soul
[40:46] both sure and steadfast and which
[40:49] entereth into that within the veil
[40:51] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[40:54] even jesus
[40:56] made a high priest forever after the
[40:58] order of melchizedek
[41:01] amen we'll let you be seated today
[41:07] i could speak to you on
[41:09] born of the same house
[41:13] born of the same house
[41:15] i'd like to start out with a quote that
[41:17] i read even wednesday night
[41:19] from melchizedek the great prince and
[41:22] king been studying this message
[41:24] it says faith never rushes itself
[41:28] faith knows what it's talking about
[41:30] said you've never seen our master
[41:32] excited about anything
[41:34] standing by the grave of a dead man he
[41:36] was just as calm
[41:38] as he was when he sat on the mount and
[41:41] looked over jerusalem
[41:42] standing on a troubled sea and or on a
[41:45] troubled ship in the troubled seas and
[41:47] waves being tossed about he was so
[41:50] completely rested in god
[41:53] until he never even paid attention to it
[41:55] enough to wake up
[41:57] always undisturbed faith is
[42:00] he said we find here that the reason we
[42:03] can be undisturbed because it was given
[42:06] to our father and to his children
[42:09] and god and the god who gave the promise
[42:12] swore by an oath that he would confirm
[42:14] it and keep it and that and that he has
[42:17] done
[42:18] and we find the children of abraham are
[42:20] not just jews outwardly but through
[42:22] abraham come isaac through isaac come
[42:25] christ through christ he has blessed the
[42:28] world for it is said unto abraham to and
[42:30] to his seed which was in christ and
[42:33] through there that all tribes of the
[42:35] earth were to be brought into this
[42:37] covenant we'd also read in galatians 3
[42:40] and verse 27 says for as many of you has
[42:43] been baptized in christ you have put on
[42:46] christ
[42:47] need there is neither jew nor greek
[42:49] there is neither bond nor free there is
[42:52] neither male nor female for ye are all
[42:54] one in christ jesus
[42:57] and if you be christ then you are
[42:59] abraham's seed and heir according to the
[43:02] promise
[43:03] amen so if you have received the spirit
[43:06] of christ or the life of christ this
[43:08] makes you abraham see
[43:10] amen it makes you that you're born of
[43:12] the same house the same household of
[43:15] faith and in this house it has faith in
[43:18] this house it has the ability to believe
[43:21] in the supernatural
[43:22] in this house it has the ability to amen
[43:25] to believe in healings and deliverances
[43:27] and salvations if you're born of this
[43:30] house amen amen in your house that you
[43:32] was born naturally into this world you
[43:34] may have been born a pruitt a smith or
[43:37] whatever your last name would be maybe
[43:39] in that house there wasn't always
[43:41] there wasn't faith there there wasn't
[43:43] the ability to believe there there
[43:45] wasn't the faith wasn't taught or faith
[43:47] wasn't received but when you received
[43:50] this life when you received this life
[43:52] amen you're born of a different house
[43:55] amen and so therefore you have the same
[43:57] faith you have the same ability to hold
[43:59] on to the promise you have the same
[44:01] endurance you have the same
[44:03] determination amen because it's no
[44:06] longer a pruitt doing it it's no longer
[44:08] someone else doing oglesby or adams amen
[44:11] it's god working on the inside of you
[44:13] and through you amen so therefore you
[44:16] can have the same ability abraham had
[44:19] that he endured faithfully and holding
[44:22] on because he knew god had swore by
[44:24] himself and god was going to confirm the
[44:26] oath that he had given him amen it
[44:28] wasn't resting upon abraham it was
[44:30] resting upon god
[44:33] so it didn't matter if he was two years
[44:35] 3 years 10 years or 20 years that made
[44:37] no difference to abraham abraham knew
[44:40] god said it and in this house we believe
[44:43] what god says
[44:44] amen so we're going to have it anywhere
[44:47] because god said so you know if god says
[44:50] so that's a good reason to believe it
[44:53] amen so he said i can you know brother
[44:54] i'm so i can imagine he went and he got
[44:56] little things together and pens and
[44:58] things getting ready to have a baby why
[45:00] god said so no matter how impossible
[45:03] amen in this house there are no
[45:05] impossibilities
[45:07] amen in this house there's nothing
[45:09] there's no there's no sickness that is
[45:11] incurable there's there's no disease too
[45:14] great and this house that we're born of
[45:16] that i'm speaking of tonight is the
[45:17] house of god amen there's nothing that
[45:20] is impossible
[45:22] amen and so he said no matter how
[45:25] impossible it seems god said so that
[45:28] settles it so 20 years passed no baby
[45:31] yet but abraham still believed in god
[45:34] and he didn't get weaker he got stronger
[45:37] he kept saying pray for giving praise to
[45:40] god no matter how impossible it may seem
[45:43] that meant nothing to it amen that show
[45:46] you i mean if you look at the thing and
[45:47] you say you know it's there's no way
[45:50] that maybe this can happen or maybe
[45:52] there's nothing to it amen it shows you
[45:54] you need to be born again
[45:57] it shows you if you cannot believe for
[45:59] the promises of god and hold on to the
[46:01] promises of god no matter how many
[46:03] devils comes up no matter how many
[46:05] impossibilities comes if you can't hold
[46:08] on to it it shows you need to be born
[46:10] again
[46:12] amen abraham's children will hold on to
[46:15] the promises of god because abraham held
[46:17] on
[46:19] amen he says you know we're being dead
[46:22] in christ we take on abraham's seed and
[46:24] therefore we're heirs according to the
[46:27] promise that gives every believer that's
[46:30] been born again the same faith that
[46:33] abraham had
[46:35] amen to call what god said to be the
[46:38] truth and to call what your eye says or
[46:41] anything that contrary to the promises
[46:44] of god you call it a lie
[46:48] amen so because we don't go by sight we
[46:51] don't walk by sight we don't go by
[46:54] feelings in this house it's not a house
[46:56] of feelings
[46:59] well i got my feelings i'm worried about
[47:01] you need to put your feelings outside
[47:02] the door because in this house our
[47:05] feelings don't matter what matters is
[47:07] what god says
[47:09] amen we go by god's word no matter
[47:11] what's outside looks like we still
[47:13] believe it if you're abraham's seed and
[47:16] you're dead in christ and you receive
[47:18] the baptism of the holy spirit that
[47:20] which makes you abraham's seed and gives
[47:23] you the same faith that abraham had that
[47:26] will call those things that are not as
[47:29] though they are
[47:32] it'll call you healed even though you
[47:35] don't feel healed it'll call you
[47:37] delivered even though you feel bound and
[47:40] and unworthy it'll call you set free
[47:45] amen no matter how you look or how you
[47:48] feel like it's what god said about it
[47:52] amen abraham called those things which
[47:54] are not as though they were see he
[47:57] didn't look at the natural things
[48:01] neither does abraham see
[48:03] he didn't he looked at the unseen
[48:06] so does abraham's seed
[48:08] amen i'm not looking at the natural
[48:10] things even in this building amen you
[48:12] know we're looking at the unseen because
[48:15] we know in the unseen there's pillar of
[48:17] fire there's angels there's god moving
[48:19] in our midst there's things that are
[48:21] happening even though we may not feel
[48:23] like it's happening even though we may
[48:25] not think it's happening even though we
[48:27] may not want it to happen it's still
[48:29] happening
[48:34] it's because what god said god will keep
[48:36] it and abraham knew he would keep his
[48:39] word abraham's seed knows god will keep
[48:42] his word
[48:44] so he believed it he testified of things
[48:46] he didn't see as though it already
[48:48] happened
[48:51] amen
[48:52] he said i hope you get it he says i i
[48:55] said i hope you can grasp this he said
[48:57] if you can take the same thing
[48:59] the same faith the same determination
[49:02] and says god promised it amen by jesus
[49:06] christ stripes i'm healed i believe it
[49:09] no matter what takes place how i feel
[49:12] how i look i'm healed anyhow why because
[49:16] god said so and you stay right there and
[49:20] don't move watch what it will do
[49:25] i tell you what it'll do when you stand
[49:27] there in that kind of faith believing
[49:30] and confessing the word of god it'll
[49:32] make the blind eyes come open on a
[49:34] barber chair
[49:37] when critics are around him and telling
[49:39] him he needs to disbelieve but he's
[49:41] still saying by his stripes i'm healed
[49:45] and he jumps out of a barber chair amen
[49:48] with his eyesight again amen that's what
[49:50] faith of abraham will do for you if you
[49:53] can stand there and not waver from it
[49:56] amen see things wants to come and we
[49:58] begin to look at the waves and we begin
[50:00] to look at the things around us and we
[50:02] don't have to look at those things
[50:03] because that really ought not be what
[50:05] we're looking at
[50:06] amen
[50:07] abraham instead of getting weak
[50:11] well you know we said well
[50:13] if god don't answer right away
[50:15] well i failed to get it
[50:17] that's not abraham
[50:19] god didn't answer him right away he gave
[50:21] the promise and he said this is what's
[50:23] going to take place
[50:25] he didn't tell him it's going to be 25
[50:26] years later
[50:28] he just said this is what's going to
[50:29] take place
[50:31] amen abraham got stronger knowing the
[50:34] longer it lasted the longer it took the
[50:37] greater miracle it's going to be
[50:41] oh hallelujah amen your parents have
[50:44] been crying out for your children don't
[50:46] get weaker get stronger
[50:48] knowing it's going to be a greater
[50:49] miracle
[50:51] god's going to do a greater thing god's
[50:53] going to move more in possibilities the
[50:55] devil may throw another one and another
[50:57] one another one that just means god's
[50:59] going to do more
[51:01] god's going to change the sin god's
[51:03] going to rewrite their lives
[51:08] instead of getting weak let's get
[51:09] stronger in the faith
[51:11] saying god you said it you promised it
[51:14] to me and i'm not backing off of what
[51:16] you promised
[51:21] it'd be a greater miracle
[51:23] see if you're the children of abraham
[51:25] you got that kind of faith
[51:29] abraham got stronger as the days went on
[51:32] amen he got weaker in his body he got
[51:34] maybe uh
[51:36] you know it seemed like more critics
[51:38] rose up and making fun and as even his
[51:40] wife was laughing and this that and the
[51:42] other abraham gets stronger
[51:46] abraham gets stronger amen if god called
[51:49] abraham and abraham had that kind of
[51:52] faith abraham's children will have the
[51:55] same kind of faith the only reason that
[51:57] abraham had that kind of faith is
[52:00] because god seen that quality in him and
[52:03] call to him and talk to him face to face
[52:06] and every person that's elected by god
[52:09] comes in and gets that same faith of
[52:11] abraham because you've talked face to
[52:13] face with god
[52:16] the spirit of the abraham that was
[52:18] rested upon abraham the spirit of christ
[52:21] is now living in you therefore you can
[52:23] take the same promises and stand
[52:26] toe-to-toe with the devil and say i'm
[52:28] not backing off of what god has given me
[52:32] i'm gonna hold it with everything that's
[52:34] gone i'm gonna press forward i'm gonna
[52:36] get stronger let me let you in on
[52:38] something this bride is not getting
[52:40] weaker
[52:41] she's not getting weaker and weaker and
[52:43] weaker no she's getting stronger
[52:47] hallelujah we're gonna see more healings
[52:50] more deliverances more prodigals coming
[52:53] home
[52:54] more of god's goodness being revealed to
[52:56] his
[52:58] people because we've been talking face
[53:01] to face with god
[53:03] amen there's a people that has a direct
[53:05] line to the throne room
[53:08] amen
[53:09] we being dead in christ take on
[53:11] abraham's seed and her heirs according
[53:14] to the promise
[53:15] the same promise he give abraham is the
[53:18] promise he gives us
[53:20] so he promised abraham his son how come
[53:23] he can't promise you your son
[53:29] mercy
[53:30] amen if we being dead in christ we take
[53:33] on abraham's seed and our heirs
[53:35] according to the same promise then the
[53:37] same faith that was in abraham dwells in
[53:40] his children who will call those things
[53:43] which are not as though they are because
[53:46] why god said so
[53:50] he said if we could really grab ahold of
[53:53] that kind of faith there not be a feeble
[53:56] mercen among us in the next five minutes
[54:02] all right
[54:04] friends
[54:05] how many receive the holy spirit
[54:09] ye are sons and daughters of god
[54:12] you are the seed of abraham join heirs
[54:15] with him in the kingdom and the same
[54:18] faith i'm gonna hammer this down the
[54:20] same faith that was in abraham is in
[54:23] every believer tonight
[54:26] by his amazing grace
[54:29] we just heard we just sung about it
[54:31] about his amazing grace the same one
[54:34] that called you out of the slop pens of
[54:36] the world and give you the holy ghost
[54:39] not because you deserved it
[54:42] not because you deserve it but he called
[54:45] you to it unconditionally
[54:49] he didn't call you because you deserved
[54:51] it he didn't call you because you were
[54:52] born in a certain family he called you
[54:55] unconditionally
[54:58] he didn't call you because he was free
[54:59] of drugs he didn't call you because you
[55:02] was free of sin he called you because
[55:04] you were his
[55:07] listen you didn't you wasn't his at the
[55:09] altar you were his before the foundation
[55:12] of the world
[55:16] that ought to give you something to
[55:17] shout about amen i was his before i ever
[55:20] smoked a cigarette i was his before i
[55:22] ever did a drug i was his before i ever
[55:25] committed one sin
[55:27] [Applause]
[55:31] he didn't call abraham because he was
[55:33] some worthy person he caused abraham
[55:36] because he was his son
[55:43] god by his amazing grace called you out
[55:45] of the slop pen of the world give you
[55:47] the holy ghost not because you deserved
[55:49] it but because he calls you called you
[55:52] to it unconditionally not because you
[55:54] were good
[55:55] not because your mother was saved but
[55:58] you was called by god's elected grace
[56:03] oh senator friend he says if you're here
[56:05] lukewarm church remember these things
[56:07] that you see going on the holy spirit
[56:10] making manifest the resurrection of
[56:12] jesus it's the covenant that god said
[56:15] and poured it out through christ the
[56:17] saying very same things that i do shall
[56:20] you do also even more than this for i go
[56:22] to my father a little while and the
[56:24] world will see me no more yet ye shall
[56:27] see me for i'll be with you even in you
[56:29] to the end of the world oh my the holy
[56:32] spirit is not a guest so it's not a
[56:35] maybe so it's not a probably so it's not
[56:38] i'm guessing at it but i know jesus
[56:40] christ lives i know he reigns i know
[56:44] he's the same yesterday today and
[56:46] forever and his holy spirit is in this
[56:49] place tonight to do the very same things
[56:51] he did while he was on earth
[56:56] oh hallelujah he met abraham and he gave
[56:59] him the covenant
[57:01] and it wasn't a covenant that said
[57:02] abraham you do certain things and then
[57:05] i'm going to do a certain thing
[57:07] you do this and then i'll do that
[57:10] no his covenant with abraham was i've
[57:12] already done it
[57:14] it's already done
[57:16] it's already been
[57:17] fixed amen hey i've already made the
[57:20] covenant with you i'm going to save you
[57:23] i'm going to bring you home with your
[57:24] father at a ripe old age nothing you can
[57:26] do about it i've already done it you say
[57:28] well brother if i only had god to say
[57:31] that to me he said wait a minute god
[57:33] said abraham and his seed after him
[57:38] so you have had it god say that to you
[57:41] because he said it to abraham and your
[57:43] seed after you we don't establish it we
[57:46] are the seed of abraham
[57:49] amen so he's given you the same covenant
[57:52] that he gave abraham because you've been
[57:54] born in the same house
[57:57] it's an unconditional covenant it's not
[57:59] that you got to do something and i'm
[58:01] going to do it you got to do this and
[58:03] i'm going to do it you got to be this
[58:04] and then i'll do it you know i've
[58:06] already done it
[58:09] i've already provided healing i've
[58:11] already provided deliverances i've
[58:13] already provided amen a way back for the
[58:16] prodigal i've already done it
[58:19] i just need somebody to believe what
[58:22] i've already done
[58:25] we are the seed of abraham
[58:27] the same faith that abraham has come to
[58:30] us by the baptism of the holy spirit
[58:33] that's the reason we can believe in
[58:34] divine healing
[58:38] because we're of the same household
[58:42] amen
[58:43] you know
[58:44] it's the spirit of the living god that's
[58:46] in the church
[58:48] that gives it the faith that abraham had
[58:51] so if the spirit of god is not there
[58:53] then the faith of abraham will not be
[58:55] there
[58:56] amen call to be able to call those
[58:58] things which are not as though they are
[59:01] because god said so there's a covenant
[59:03] that god made
[59:04] so what did he do as he did with abraham
[59:07] he would tear apart the animals and he
[59:09] would lay them in half god did the same
[59:11] thing he tore christ apart and he took
[59:14] his body and he set it on the right side
[59:16] of him and sent the other part back the
[59:18] holy ghost down to earth to baptize the
[59:22] church with the same faith to give him
[59:24] the same faith that he had to do the
[59:26] same for works that he did the same
[59:28] thing that i do shall ye do also
[59:33] so he has not left you here to perform
[59:35] the word he has come himself inside of
[59:38] you to do the work in you
[59:42] it's the same faith producing the same
[59:45] words the same signs the same wonders
[59:48] the same glory
[59:52] amen men are not infallible so i'm
[59:54] thankful he didn't put this all on a
[59:56] fickle man
[59:59] good lands if our salvation depended
[1:00:01] upon a man
[1:00:02] as far as a a man you know a sin born
[1:00:06] man i'll put it that way
[1:00:08] man born of sin and he can make a
[1:00:10] decision today you know what it'd be one
[1:00:12] day he'd love you the next day he
[1:00:14] wouldn't
[1:00:16] he'd love you as long as you did this
[1:00:18] dotted every eye and you crossed every
[1:00:19] team you bowed down you've done this
[1:00:21] that and the other
[1:00:22] he would love you all the way but until
[1:00:24] when you cross something
[1:00:26] then that love will change
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:33] but that ain't god
[1:00:36] the many of us gave god millions of
[1:00:38] reasons not to love us but he still
[1:00:40] loves you he gave us millions of reasons
[1:00:43] not to he gave him millions of reasons
[1:00:44] not to call us out of sin and out of
[1:00:47] darkness but he still did it anyhow
[1:00:50] oh hallelujah because his covenant is
[1:00:52] not on a fickle man but it's on an
[1:00:55] unchangeable
[1:00:56] god and this god cannot lie
[1:01:01] so if god called you he's not going to
[1:01:03] change his mind about you
[1:01:08] he could have changed his mind about
[1:01:09] abraham
[1:01:10] abraham gave him plenty of reasons to
[1:01:12] change his mind
[1:01:14] he went down to egypt he done all kinds
[1:01:16] of things but that it wasn't dependent
[1:01:18] on abraham as depending on what god said
[1:01:21] so god would work it back around to his
[1:01:23] to the to his word could be fulfilled
[1:01:25] and abraham and that's exactly what he
[1:01:27] does in our life now you may go through
[1:01:29] some horrible times in your life because
[1:01:30] your own stubborn self but god will work
[1:01:32] you back around to perform his word in
[1:01:35] you
[1:01:37] i'm thankful for that i'm thankful he
[1:01:39] didn't give up
[1:01:41] because i gave him plenty of chances to
[1:01:42] give up on me
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:46] our faith is not in the wisdom of man
[1:01:50] but our faith rests in the power and the
[1:01:53] word of god
[1:01:55] that's where the true seed of abraham
[1:01:57] rests their promises because they can
[1:01:59] only be the seed of abraham by the holy
[1:02:02] spirit without the holy spirit they're
[1:02:04] not the seed of abraham but when they
[1:02:06] have that spirit the same faith that was
[1:02:08] in abraham comes into the believer
[1:02:12] and no matter what comes about the
[1:02:14] believer still believes a man still
[1:02:16] marches on we can see this same
[1:02:19] the same path all the way through the
[1:02:20] bible you can look at it you can see it
[1:02:22] what household they were really quick
[1:02:26] amen we can see that the 10 spies or
[1:02:29] other 12 spies that went to come back
[1:02:31] with a good report and 10 with a bad
[1:02:33] report
[1:02:34] but only two of them's report lined up
[1:02:36] with the word of god
[1:02:38] the other 10 was their own report and
[1:02:40] what they saw and what they believed
[1:02:42] they totally did away with what god had
[1:02:44] said but the other two said it doesn't
[1:02:46] matter what i saw it matters what god
[1:02:48] said so it showed very quickly whose
[1:02:51] house they were born of
[1:02:54] come on now when you get somebody that
[1:02:56] says you know god doesn't heal no more
[1:02:58] the days of miracles are past and god
[1:03:01] doesn't do those kind of things it shows
[1:03:02] you really quick whose house they're
[1:03:04] born of
[1:03:06] if they're born of the seed of god they
[1:03:09] would know he's the same yesterday today
[1:03:11] and forever
[1:03:17] but we see it
[1:03:19] as they come back on that from that
[1:03:21] report
[1:03:23] there's giants over there and great big
[1:03:25] governments and spears my goodness they
[1:03:27] got chariots and we look like
[1:03:29] grasshoppers
[1:03:33] in god's report
[1:03:35] i never did see you mention one thing
[1:03:36] about how big the walls was
[1:03:39] or how many chariots they had or how big
[1:03:42] their spears was or or if they were if
[1:03:44] you're going to look like grasshoppers
[1:03:46] in there that wasn't in god's report
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:50] but joshua
[1:03:51] amen was born of a different house then
[1:03:54] these other 10 spies and he jumped up
[1:03:56] and he said man and brethren not only
[1:03:58] are we able to go over and take the land
[1:04:00] we've been made more than abel
[1:04:03] amen why because he was a seed of
[1:04:05] abraham and god gave the promise it was
[1:04:07] my his possession and god gave it it
[1:04:10] didn't matter what the opposition was a
[1:04:12] true seed will take it no matter how bad
[1:04:15] it looks
[1:04:16] or how impossible it looks
[1:04:23] brother adam said well now there
[1:04:25] stands at that same place there stands
[1:04:28] that today the church of the living god
[1:04:31] i don't care what anybody says what the
[1:04:34] doctor says what an unbeliever says we
[1:04:37] are more than a match for anything that
[1:04:40] comes along
[1:04:47] what shall we say to these things if god
[1:04:50] be for us who can be against us
[1:04:53] amen that's where we stand no we are
[1:04:55] more than a match
[1:05:03] because we are abraham's seed and we
[1:05:06] will possess
[1:05:08] we will take hold we will not let go
[1:05:11] therefore healing is our salvation is
[1:05:14] our the holy ghost is ours
[1:05:18] there can be thousands of preachers that
[1:05:20] says it ain't so but the cedar abraham
[1:05:23] knows it's so
[1:05:27] oh they'll wait right into it they'll
[1:05:29] possess it no matter what takes place
[1:05:31] his seed is going to take it amen there
[1:05:33] joshua stood this little fellow
[1:05:36] seemingly standing all by himself him
[1:05:37] and caleb i don't care how big they are
[1:05:40] i don't care what kind of spear they got
[1:05:42] i don't care how high their cities are
[1:05:44] how great it is our promise is this is
[1:05:47] our land let's go take our land
[1:05:51] we're more than a match for them
[1:05:58] a lot of them that was born of natural
[1:06:00] seed said well we just can't do it
[1:06:03] there's no need of trying
[1:06:05] we're outnumbered
[1:06:07] we're outclassed
[1:06:08] we're everything
[1:06:10] they were looking at what their eyes saw
[1:06:13] instead of what god said
[1:06:15] and this is where you'll know if you're
[1:06:16] still of natural seed you rely on what
[1:06:19] you see right here
[1:06:22] or what your mind can put together or
[1:06:24] how you can figure it all out with your
[1:06:26] human abilities and human understanding
[1:06:28] and you'll totally discredit what god
[1:06:31] said and or not even bring it into the
[1:06:33] equation
[1:06:38] it ain't what god said is not the
[1:06:40] equation
[1:06:41] what god said is the answer
[1:06:45] to the equation
[1:06:47] amen what god said is is the ultimate
[1:06:50] final it doesn't matter if some other
[1:06:52] scholar can come along and show you that
[1:06:54] this map adds all up and his brother
[1:06:56] brother joe's been preaching so
[1:06:57] wonderfully on impossible math and adds
[1:06:59] all up to a different answer that
[1:07:01] matters not what matters is what god
[1:07:04] said and that is the final answer and if
[1:07:07] he said it's your land then it's your
[1:07:09] land if he said it's your healing then
[1:07:11] it's your healing it doesn't matter how
[1:07:13] many devils line up and say it ain't so
[1:07:15] it doesn't matter how many uh false
[1:07:17] prophets arise and say it ain't so if
[1:07:19] it's your land and god said it's your
[1:07:22] land it is it's so it doesn't matter
[1:07:24] what anybody else says
[1:07:30] the seed of abraham doesn't look at
[1:07:32] natural things
[1:07:34] they look at what the lord said
[1:07:36] whose report are you going to believe
[1:07:39] what if abraham would have looked at the
[1:07:40] natural
[1:07:41] and a woman now 90 years old
[1:07:44] he was a hundred
[1:07:46] been with her since she was a little
[1:07:47] girl him a little boy no seed yet he
[1:07:50] didn't look at those things
[1:07:52] he said he counted those things as
[1:07:54] though they were not for he only looked
[1:07:56] at what god said i'll bless you abraham
[1:07:59] and i'll give you a seed by sarah he
[1:08:02] believed it you don't have to look at
[1:08:04] the opposition you look at what god says
[1:08:10] amen
[1:08:12] but we we find that you know the child
[1:08:14] didn't arrive till 25 years later
[1:08:17] but as we've been hammering instead of
[1:08:19] getting weaker he got stronger
[1:08:24] i mean i know the promise of the coming
[1:08:25] of the lord is seemingly delayed and
[1:08:27] it's further and further and further and
[1:08:29] you know people's come up with dates for
[1:08:31] years and numbers come to pass but that
[1:08:33] don't mean there ain't a date
[1:08:35] there is a date
[1:08:37] no man knoweth the hour but there is an
[1:08:39] hour
[1:08:40] no man know at the time but there is a
[1:08:42] time
[1:08:43] amen so it doesn't matter about what's
[1:08:46] going on but it ought to make our
[1:08:48] expectations greater
[1:08:50] not minimize it make it greater amen not
[1:08:53] make it less make it more if sarah was
[1:08:56] one month older it ought to be one more
[1:08:58] month one month greater in expectation
[1:09:00] because god is going to keep his word it
[1:09:03] wouldn't be a lot better to her for her
[1:09:05] to have a child at 100 or 60 it wouldn't
[1:09:07] matter but it's greater miracle all the
[1:09:10] time so you don't get weaker you get
[1:09:13] stronger and we are the seed of abraham
[1:09:16] the bible said and we're dead in christ
[1:09:18] and we take on abraham's seed and heirs
[1:09:20] according to the promise of abraham
[1:09:22] because abraham was given that promise
[1:09:25] and we are the same heirs that he was
[1:09:32] amen
[1:09:36] but born of this house
[1:09:39] of the same house
[1:09:40] the same house of faith or the household
[1:09:43] of faith or or the body of christ or or
[1:09:47] or the building of the lord
[1:09:49] of this house
[1:09:52] your natural seed cannot believe
[1:09:54] in the in the supernatural
[1:09:57] you know it's nothing really in a
[1:09:59] natural thing to believe or otherwise
[1:10:01] even esau or some of the others but
[1:10:03] jacob and those along that line or that
[1:10:06] lineage of abraham the promise was
[1:10:08] flowing through they were able to
[1:10:10] believe the supernatural signs that were
[1:10:12] taking place
[1:10:14] amen why because there was something on
[1:10:16] the inside of them you know they you
[1:10:18] know there has to be a supernatural seed
[1:10:21] to be born of the supernatural to have
[1:10:23] the same faith amen born not by natural
[1:10:26] birth but by supernatural birth by
[1:10:28] supernatural faith amen a faith that is
[1:10:31] supernatural
[1:10:33] or that supersedes the natural
[1:10:38] that goes beyond what a natural eye can
[1:10:40] see or our natural heart can believe
[1:10:43] amen it goes beyond all of that
[1:10:47] and it'll hold it hold on to it for
[1:10:49] years
[1:10:51] time doesn't matter
[1:10:53] to god's word
[1:10:55] it may look like it's full of moth balls
[1:10:57] may look like it's moss growing over it
[1:11:00] but it's still there just as true as it
[1:11:03] ever was
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:08] god
[1:11:09] looking for people to believe in the
[1:11:11] supernatural
[1:11:14] so
[1:11:15] the covenant
[1:11:17] was given to abraham
[1:11:20] unconditionally
[1:11:22] not abraham if you do this then i'll do
[1:11:24] that
[1:11:25] but i've already done it
[1:11:28] we have the same covenant
[1:11:31] it's already done
[1:11:34] it's not what we do it's what he did
[1:11:39] it's not what we are it's what he's done
[1:11:42] for us
[1:11:44] it's nothing that we could do or our own
[1:11:46] merit to merit anything or you know to
[1:11:49] be righteous enough or to be good enough
[1:11:56] the only thing we can do
[1:11:58] is accept
[1:12:00] and be grateful for what he's already
[1:12:02] done
[1:12:05] that's why we can sing
[1:12:07] amazing grace
[1:12:09] amazing grace it's not just grace it's
[1:12:12] amazing grace
[1:12:14] because i knew what i used to be
[1:12:16] i knew what i used to do i i knew where
[1:12:19] i knew i used to dwell at and the things
[1:12:22] i used to dwell on i knew all of that
[1:12:27] if you knew like i knew
[1:12:32] what he done for me
[1:12:34] if i knew like you knew
[1:12:36] what he done for you
[1:12:38] you could look at that and say that is
[1:12:40] not just grace that's amazing grace
[1:12:44] that's unmerited grace
[1:12:46] i didn't deserve what i got but he still
[1:12:49] gave it to me anyway
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:59] lebron was saying like this he said i'm
[1:13:01] positive
[1:13:02] that many times in people's thinking
[1:13:05] they try to make divine healing some
[1:13:07] great outreach in something if i could
[1:13:09] only reach it
[1:13:11] he said could you imagine jesus said let
[1:13:13] me check my faith
[1:13:14] and see if i got enough faith to do this
[1:13:17] see if i have to fast a while to see if
[1:13:19] i have enough faith to do he was
[1:13:21] unconscious of the faith he had he just
[1:13:24] spoke it and knew it was going to be so
[1:13:28] he said just like you're coming from
[1:13:29] your homes today
[1:13:31] you probably want to return to your home
[1:13:34] told your wife and loved ones when you
[1:13:35] went to work or whatever today i'll be
[1:13:37] back sometimes
[1:13:38] right afternoon or about five o'clock
[1:13:40] whatever time you get off how do you
[1:13:42] know you are
[1:13:43] you're not trying to figure it out do i
[1:13:45] get enough faith to get back home
[1:13:48] have i got enough faith to drive my car
[1:13:52] no you just unconsciously turn your key
[1:13:54] on and drive away and go home
[1:14:00] it's an unconscious faith that does that
[1:14:03] that's the way it is christ in christ we
[1:14:05] are unconscious we just say that's his
[1:14:07] word that settles it there's no more to
[1:14:10] it and you just go home and be well
[1:14:20] so you don't worry about it you go home
[1:14:22] and be well you say well brother timothy
[1:14:23] at me when i get home i'll be well no it
[1:14:25] might be five weeks
[1:14:27] might be five months
[1:14:28] might be five years
[1:14:32] could be five minutes
[1:14:37] but abraham
[1:14:39] received the promise after he patiently
[1:14:42] endured
[1:14:45] he obtained the promise this is the
[1:14:46] house we're born of
[1:14:49] you know i had a neighbor one time he's
[1:14:50] passed on now but he said he'd say to me
[1:14:52] all the time tell me i pray to god for
[1:14:54] patience and i tell them i want it right
[1:14:56] now
[1:15:01] that ain't always how it works
[1:15:04] abraham patiently enduring
[1:15:08] enduring as seeing what
[1:15:10] an unvisible god as though he's visible
[1:15:14] standing right before him after he
[1:15:16] endured the hard test and the hard trial
[1:15:19] and the hard fight he inherited the
[1:15:21] promise
[1:15:25] you know it looked like god would have
[1:15:26] spoken and he'd reach down and he would
[1:15:28] have done it right away
[1:15:30] he could have done that
[1:15:32] he could have worked it right out he
[1:15:34] goes abraham i'm going to give you a son
[1:15:36] he went right home amen and had the son
[1:15:40] but god don't always work that way
[1:15:43] but the children of abraham will believe
[1:15:45] no matter if it's five minutes five
[1:15:47] weeks five years or whatever long it is
[1:15:50] god said it i believe it
[1:15:55] look at hannah another seat of abraham
[1:15:57] amen born of the same household when she
[1:16:00] was at the temple and she was praying
[1:16:01] and eli come out and said that she
[1:16:03] thought she was drunk she said i'm not
[1:16:04] drunk i'm praying that god will take
[1:16:06] away my reproach and he said the lord
[1:16:09] god grant thee thy request
[1:16:11] god could have placed little samuel in
[1:16:13] hannah's arms right there
[1:16:18] he's a creator
[1:16:20] he can do all things he can just speak
[1:16:23] it into existence he could have put that
[1:16:25] baby into our arms but instead of that
[1:16:28] it was a process of time
[1:16:31] maybe nine months maybe 12 months maybe
[1:16:33] whatever he could have done it instantly
[1:16:35] but he didn't do it yesterday he just
[1:16:37] gave her the promise that he would
[1:16:44] isaiah 40 and verse 28 said hast thou
[1:16:47] not known
[1:16:49] hast thou not heard
[1:16:52] that the everlasting god
[1:16:55] the lord
[1:16:56] the creator of the ends of the earth
[1:16:59] fainteth not
[1:17:00] neither is weary
[1:17:02] and there's no searching of his
[1:17:05] understanding
[1:17:07] in other words he's probably got it
[1:17:08] figured out better than you do
[1:17:13] so why you tore up about it
[1:17:16] rest in his promise
[1:17:18] he knows the perfect time to move
[1:17:21] he knows the perfect time to answer
[1:17:24] we want it right now and it's a lot
[1:17:26] easier on us the west because that's why
[1:17:28] we want it now because it's easier right
[1:17:30] but god don't always do it that way
[1:17:32] he'll let you go through treatments
[1:17:37] he'll let you go through tests and
[1:17:38] surgeries and all kinds of things
[1:17:42] but that doesn't change his word
[1:17:44] that doesn't change who he is
[1:17:47] he giveth power to the faint
[1:17:49] and to them that might that have no
[1:17:51] might he increases strength oh
[1:17:53] hallelujah so if you feel wore out
[1:17:55] tonight he's got something for you even
[1:17:58] the youth shall fade and be weary and
[1:18:00] the young men shall utterly fall but
[1:18:03] they
[1:18:04] that wait upon the lord
[1:18:06] shall renew their strength and they
[1:18:08] shall mount up with wings as eagles and
[1:18:11] they shall run and not be weary and they
[1:18:13] shall walk and not face
[1:18:18] hallelujah that's the faith of abraham
[1:18:23] working in the believer
[1:18:25] so when god told moses
[1:18:27] when he started out to go to the
[1:18:28] promised land all that all that promise
[1:18:30] he said i give abraham years ago is all
[1:18:32] walled up by the philistines and jericho
[1:18:35] and all kinds of great people the
[1:18:36] warriors
[1:18:37] now it's all yours
[1:18:40] there's
[1:18:41] amorites there and there's havits there
[1:18:43] and there's
[1:18:45] parasites there
[1:18:47] and there's juvenites there and there's
[1:18:50] philistines there and there's all kinds
[1:18:53] of things there there's cancer there
[1:18:56] there's sugar diabetes there
[1:18:58] there's sin there and there's all kind
[1:19:00] of issues there
[1:19:02] there's all kind of problems there but i
[1:19:04] give it to you it's your land
[1:19:07] grown up with weeds and it's been
[1:19:09] untaken care of for seven
[1:19:11] seven church ages but i'm giving it to
[1:19:13] you
[1:19:15] i'm giving you this land it's yours
[1:19:21] but you got to go take it you got to go
[1:19:23] possess it you got to go do something
[1:19:25] with it you got to grab your sword and
[1:19:27] go after your believer
[1:19:30] go after your promise go after the
[1:19:32] things that you want
[1:19:37] and i'm so sick of the church being
[1:19:39] backed into a corner it's time we go on
[1:19:41] the offensive
[1:19:43] i i i gotta let that run through my mind
[1:19:46] many times brother josh shared our
[1:19:48] meetings a couple years ago talking
[1:19:49] about muhammad ali and being on the
[1:19:51] ropes remember that
[1:19:53] in the seventh round it was time to get
[1:19:55] off the ropes
[1:19:58] for 66 years 6 000 years the church has
[1:20:01] been on the roads but in this age it's
[1:20:03] time to get off the ropes it's time to
[1:20:06] go take what is yours it's time to say
[1:20:08] devil i've had enough of you being on my
[1:20:10] property this is mine just saith the
[1:20:13] lord this is mine
[1:20:16] my inheritance my children
[1:20:21] i'll give it to you it's yours now go
[1:20:23] possess it
[1:20:26] he said i hope you see it
[1:20:28] it's something i want to get your faith
[1:20:29] to where it belongs
[1:20:32] he said many
[1:20:33] people got faith that they only know how
[1:20:35] to put it to work
[1:20:38] he said benjamin franklin one time found
[1:20:40] electricity
[1:20:42] story is i wasn't there but apparently
[1:20:44] the story is he flew a kite up into
[1:20:46] electrical storm
[1:20:49] had something some kind of metal on it
[1:20:51] it popped him pretty good
[1:20:53] and he said i got it
[1:20:55] i got it
[1:20:57] but he didn't know what he had
[1:21:00] and along came thomas edison said it'll
[1:21:02] work and we'll find something that it'll
[1:21:04] work through
[1:21:06] and he tried thousands of wires and yet
[1:21:08] he found a wire that would finally carry
[1:21:10] the electricity through the wire he knew
[1:21:13] it was the power and the power would
[1:21:15] work and our benefit he said we found
[1:21:18] salvation will save us from sin we found
[1:21:20] it would take the violence woman or the
[1:21:22] violence man the drunkard the prostitute
[1:21:25] and make them a child of god if that
[1:21:27] same faith and that same power will lift
[1:21:30] up a fallen man or woman like that it'll
[1:21:32] work for us in more ways than that
[1:21:36] it'll heal bodies it'll move mountains
[1:21:39] it'll change lives
[1:21:44] hallelujah
[1:21:46] he said see it's like if i had a i had a
[1:21:49] farm on one side of the hill and it's
[1:21:50] full of corn but it was dying from the
[1:21:52] lack of water and on the other side was
[1:21:54] artesian well
[1:21:56] and if i could make that artesian well
[1:21:58] throw water down there up on this side
[1:22:00] of the hill to water that corn he said
[1:22:02] what happens i gotta survey that land i
[1:22:04] gotta find out that that water will take
[1:22:06] its own current and of course and it'll
[1:22:08] come around and water the crop if it'll
[1:22:10] if it'll do it if i'll just let it run
[1:22:13] in its own channel
[1:22:16] that's the same thing with the holy
[1:22:17] spirit in god's promise if we'll just
[1:22:20] let it run its way
[1:22:22] not us get in the way not us throw our
[1:22:24] doubts in there and cause it didn't do
[1:22:26] that it didn't do this and it didn't
[1:22:28] happen what i thought it would just let
[1:22:30] god's holy spirit work in you and you
[1:22:34] rest on the promise and while you rest
[1:22:37] it'll work
[1:22:39] it'll do what god said it would do
[1:22:43] oh my
[1:22:45] it's what abraham did
[1:22:48] abraham received the promise a hundred
[1:22:49] years old
[1:22:52] and he rested on el shaddai
[1:22:55] which means the breasted one
[1:22:58] the strength giver
[1:23:01] brother branham would talk about it
[1:23:02] being as a woman would take a young
[1:23:04] suckling child to herself and it would
[1:23:06] nurse and gain strength this is what
[1:23:08] abraham did
[1:23:10] he just began to nurse from the strength
[1:23:12] giver
[1:23:13] he wouldn't dwell on his doubts he'd
[1:23:15] pull from the strength river
[1:23:18] hello somebody that'll help you with a
[1:23:20] lot of your mind battles if you quit
[1:23:22] dwelling on them and you start pulling
[1:23:23] from the strength giver
[1:23:25] those mind battles are designed to tear
[1:23:27] your strength down
[1:23:28] amen to tear your life down to tear your
[1:23:31] hopes down to tear your everything about
[1:23:33] you down but if you'll take your mind
[1:23:34] off of that and put it back on the
[1:23:36] strength giver
[1:23:39] hallelujah amen and start nursing from
[1:23:42] the promises of god and the things of
[1:23:45] god like a baby to his mother and
[1:23:47] strength for the baby we do the same
[1:23:49] thing when we come to god and we see his
[1:23:51] promise and we lay ourselves right into
[1:23:53] that promise and we draw from the word
[1:23:55] the strength of god and given in its own
[1:23:58] course not our mind just believing it
[1:24:00] and after we endured we shall obtain the
[1:24:03] promise
[1:24:06] the same thing works for salvation it's
[1:24:08] the same thing that works for divine
[1:24:10] healing
[1:24:13] he said surely i will bless thee
[1:24:15] and we'll multiply thee
[1:24:20] we see that he can said he said in our
[1:24:22] scripture
[1:24:23] he swore by
[1:24:25] a greater an oath as confirmation
[1:24:27] confirmed
[1:24:28] as an end-all
[1:24:30] god swore to abraham that he would keep
[1:24:32] his covenant with him and with the seed
[1:24:34] forever
[1:24:36] he swore by himself that he would do it
[1:24:38] and in doing so under the old law
[1:24:41] he made an oath under the old law he
[1:24:42] killed an animal animal cut it in two
[1:24:45] and then old law they would take that
[1:24:46] host
[1:24:48] stand between the animals
[1:24:50] they'd write on up out on a piece of
[1:24:51] paper a certain contract and they'd tear
[1:24:53] it apart give one to one another to the
[1:24:55] other
[1:24:58] and god having no other no one greater
[1:25:00] to swear by he swore by himself
[1:25:03] and he took himself to calvary and he
[1:25:06] tore his body apart
[1:25:09] and he lifted up his body to sit on the
[1:25:11] right hand and send it back send back
[1:25:12] the holy spirit to being every believer
[1:25:17] hello every believer
[1:25:19] to do the same thing in every church and
[1:25:22] every believer he did in christ when he
[1:25:24] was here on earth proven that he would
[1:25:26] raise him up in the last days and set
[1:25:29] him with him in his own kingdom
[1:25:33] and today to see the same holy spirit
[1:25:36] that is upon jesus christ working the
[1:25:39] same in the church
[1:25:41] confirming the word exactly the same
[1:25:49] he proved it
[1:25:51] by the immutability of his counsel
[1:25:54] that there was two immutable things
[1:25:57] which one being impossible
[1:26:00] for god to lie
[1:26:06] that we might have a strong consolation
[1:26:10] and have fled for a refuge to lay hold
[1:26:13] upon the
[1:26:15] hope set before us
[1:26:18] we can see
[1:26:19] what a marvelous promise god cannot lie
[1:26:22] and be god
[1:26:24] therefore what he said in his word he
[1:26:26] has to bring to pass or therefore he's
[1:26:28] not god
[1:26:30] but we have seen him bring it to pass
[1:26:33] time after time after time after time
[1:26:39] if there's any fault
[1:26:42] it's in us not in god
[1:26:44] for god is obligated to his word
[1:26:48] brother would say it like this
[1:26:50] said somebody said he said somebody said
[1:26:52] to him said the holy ghost
[1:26:54] wasn't given it was only given to the 12
[1:26:56] apostles on the day of pentecost
[1:26:59] you know it's funny they're trying to
[1:27:01] say that again today
[1:27:03] say well then what about the 120 that
[1:27:05] was in the same time when they received
[1:27:07] it
[1:27:08] how about those down at the house of
[1:27:10] cornelius when the gentiles received it
[1:27:12] how about 33 years later when paul asked
[1:27:15] the baptist if they had received the
[1:27:17] holy ghost since they believed and he
[1:27:19] laid his hands upon them and they
[1:27:20] received the holy ghost
[1:27:22] setting the church in corinthian order
[1:27:24] he said in the church at that time
[1:27:26] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:27:28] gifts of healing all those marvelous
[1:27:30] gifts years and years before beyond
[1:27:32] pentecost
[1:27:35] and today it's to every believer
[1:27:37] go into all the world preach the gospel
[1:27:39] to every creature how far all the world
[1:27:42] how many all people
[1:27:44] and he that believeth and is baptized
[1:27:45] shall be saved
[1:27:48] and he that believeth not shall be down
[1:27:50] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:27:52] by their belief in my name they shall
[1:27:55] cast out devils and heal the sick
[1:27:58] there you are the promise to every
[1:28:01] believer
[1:28:04] it's god's promise that he swore he
[1:28:05] would do it no matter how many tries to
[1:28:07] rise up and counterfeit it or say it
[1:28:09] ain't so or try to contradict it and
[1:28:11] take it down and ripe it off it's god's
[1:28:13] word it's not man's word
[1:28:24] therefore we have a great hope
[1:28:27] a faith
[1:28:29] an anchor of the soul
[1:28:31] that's what's in this house
[1:28:34] there's an anchor
[1:28:36] in in your house it may be
[1:28:39] a double-minded man i don't know but in
[1:28:41] this house
[1:28:42] there's an anchor
[1:28:45] in your house you might think one way
[1:28:47] one day and think another another way
[1:28:48] but in this house there's an anchor
[1:28:51] that the storms may rage and the storms
[1:28:54] may blow and the wind may come against
[1:28:55] the boat but there's an anchor
[1:28:58] there's a holding place there's a line
[1:29:00] that holds it it may flip around one way
[1:29:03] and the other you may not can see land
[1:29:05] you may not can see things around you
[1:29:06] makes me so dark but there's an anchor
[1:29:09] that goes down
[1:29:10] amen to the bottom of the sea and it
[1:29:12] catches upon a rock and every person
[1:29:14] that's received jesus christ as a
[1:29:16] personal savior been born again with the
[1:29:19] holy spirit you have dropped an anchor
[1:29:23] if you're sick amen and your hope is
[1:29:26] built on christ you have dropped an
[1:29:29] anchor the doctor may say this and the
[1:29:31] doctor may say that but that doesn't
[1:29:33] move you because you have dropped an
[1:29:36] anchor
[1:29:37] critics may rise this one may start a
[1:29:39] youtube channel that one may do this but
[1:29:42] it doesn't bother you you have stopped
[1:29:45] an anchor
[1:29:46] [Applause]
[1:29:48] that's what's in this house
[1:29:56] what have you got your hopes built on
[1:30:00] the doctor says it may be gone
[1:30:03] medicine says it can't do nothing
[1:30:05] surgery says it's failed
[1:30:07] but my hope's not built on that
[1:30:12] we have our hope within the veil
[1:30:16] through the shedding of his blood that
[1:30:18] tore his spirit from his body to where
[1:30:20] we can have the same promises
[1:30:22] and we can hold on to the same things
[1:30:25] amen we have an anchor it's steadfast
[1:30:27] it's unmovable it holds
[1:30:30] when everything around us is moving
[1:30:32] everything around us is changing
[1:30:35] how quickly as our society changing even
[1:30:38] the last amen a few months
[1:30:40] much less years
[1:30:42] things are changing so quick but god's
[1:30:44] word don't change
[1:30:47] government's change but god's word don't
[1:30:49] change man's minds change but god's word
[1:30:51] don't change
[1:30:53] churches doctrines can change but god's
[1:30:55] word don't change
[1:30:57] preachers can change but god's word
[1:30:58] don't change
[1:31:02] it's steadfast it's unmovable it holds
[1:31:06] it's steadfastness
[1:31:09] it may the doctor may say there's no
[1:31:10] hope for you
[1:31:12] not a hope for you to live
[1:31:14] but that don't change nothing
[1:31:18] you know you already died a long time
[1:31:20] ago
[1:31:22] therefore you can't die
[1:31:26] what kind of assurance did abraham have
[1:31:31] what kind of assurance did sarah have
[1:31:34] they had what god said
[1:31:36] they believed what god said
[1:31:39] we can read in our scripture that he was
[1:31:41] a forerunner jesus was a forerunner that
[1:31:44] entered in for us
[1:31:45] he's the forerunner of what
[1:31:48] he's the forerunner of our salvation
[1:31:51] physically and spiritually for he was
[1:31:53] wounded for our transgression he's
[1:31:55] bruised for our iniquity the
[1:31:56] chastisement our peaceful opponent and
[1:31:58] with his stripes we're healed the
[1:32:00] forerunner of our salvation and healing
[1:32:03] is already entered in
[1:32:06] what is a forerunner it's something
[1:32:08] that's forerunning something that's
[1:32:10] coming it's a wave sheath
[1:32:13] it's something that's saying there's
[1:32:15] more to come just like me
[1:32:17] so he's already forerunned our coming
[1:32:22] that he has another body just like his
[1:32:24] glorious body it's the bride of jesus
[1:32:27] christ and she will overcome as he
[1:32:30] overcome she will rise above it as he
[1:32:32] arose above it she'll walk on the winds
[1:32:34] in the way she'll walk over every devil
[1:32:37] come on somebody she'll walk over cancer
[1:32:40] she'll walk over every disease of every
[1:32:41] kind she'll walk over every drug and
[1:32:44] every addiction she'll walk over it all
[1:32:47] right because he did it
[1:32:51] the father of this house did it
[1:32:55] therefore the children of this house can
[1:32:57] do the same because the same blood that
[1:32:59] run through the father now runs to the
[1:33:02] children by the spirit of
[1:33:07] that's god
[1:33:10] bless us hope blessed hope we have
[1:33:12] that christ the full runner has already
[1:33:15] come
[1:33:16] something that runs before
[1:33:18] or goes ahead
[1:33:20] an example of a church
[1:33:23] that the church
[1:33:25] would do what he did
[1:33:27] that the church would finish what he
[1:33:29] started
[1:33:32] or continue his works
[1:33:34] after he completed his sacrifice at
[1:33:35] calvary
[1:33:38] a forerunner
[1:33:40] and that's why he would say a little
[1:33:41] while
[1:33:43] the world will see me no more
[1:33:45] but you shall see me
[1:33:47] for i'll be with you
[1:33:49] even in you
[1:33:51] to the end of the world
[1:33:54] so we could see abraham
[1:33:58] we don't have time to get all into this
[1:33:59] but we can say abrahams he's called out
[1:34:01] he brings his daddy he brings lot he
[1:34:02] brings all things he wasn't even
[1:34:05] that wasn't even called
[1:34:07] and we see things that had to be
[1:34:08] separated off of his life for him to
[1:34:10] obtain the promise
[1:34:14] brother branham would say it like this
[1:34:15] he says
[1:34:18] he said i hope this finds a resting
[1:34:20] place but maybe the reason some of you
[1:34:23] are not getting along so well
[1:34:25] you're holding on to things we ought to
[1:34:27] let go of
[1:34:29] there's got to be a separation maybe
[1:34:32] it's a doubt or a little wonder or a
[1:34:34] little skeptic
[1:34:35] wonder if it's right could this be could
[1:34:37] that be how cut loose from all of that
[1:34:41] lay aside every weight and sin that so
[1:34:43] easily beset you
[1:34:44] and run the race looking under jesus
[1:34:47] christ the author and finisher of our
[1:34:49] faith what we see is lot he
[1:34:51] he went down towards sodom and we know
[1:34:53] the story
[1:34:54] and this is where i'm coming down to
[1:34:58] i got down there and and and sodom and
[1:35:00] gomorrah
[1:35:02] and and there was some kings that rose
[1:35:03] up and they came and took him and took
[1:35:06] him out and his family with him and
[1:35:07] abraham heard of it
[1:35:11] and abraham said
[1:35:12] i got to go after him
[1:35:15] my brother has been taken
[1:35:18] he said look what brother i said look
[1:35:19] what lord had done to him
[1:35:22] look what would have taken place
[1:35:25] but look look at the heart of abraham i
[1:35:28] got to go back and get him
[1:35:31] see abraham's brother was taken captive
[1:35:34] and so he armed his trained servants
[1:35:38] his trained servants
[1:35:43] born
[1:35:44] of his own house
[1:35:47] 318
[1:35:50] born of his own house
[1:35:52] hey brother adam said why did abraham
[1:35:54] not go get somebody else to help him
[1:35:56] fight
[1:35:58] why did he not go and ask some country
[1:36:00] next to him or some king somewhere or
[1:36:02] someplace somewhere to align themselves
[1:36:04] but he found men born of his own house
[1:36:08] he said because they had the same faith
[1:36:10] abraham had
[1:36:12] so therefore they would fight like
[1:36:14] abraham would fight
[1:36:16] they would believe like abraham would
[1:36:17] believe they would go and take back what
[1:36:20] was rightfully theirs they wouldn't sit
[1:36:22] back and say well we came we got part of
[1:36:24] it and we're okay we're going to go back
[1:36:26] now no they wasn't satisfied with
[1:36:27] getting just part of it they wanted all
[1:36:29] of it they wanted it all back hey man he
[1:36:32] said see went and got men of his own
[1:36:35] house
[1:36:39] oh my he had enough servants to fight an
[1:36:41] army with and he pursued them and took
[1:36:44] it all back brought back all the goods
[1:36:46] bought back everything lot had all his
[1:36:49] goods all the women all the people
[1:36:51] everyone
[1:36:53] why because he found people that would
[1:36:56] believe just like he believes
[1:36:58] he said abraham his brother had gone a
[1:37:00] lot his brother hadn't gone astray he
[1:37:02] said but see abraham a picture of the
[1:37:05] true church or a true believer of god
[1:37:07] that's blessed of god and has the
[1:37:09] promise of god as the covenant of god
[1:37:12] has faith in the covenant he said if
[1:37:14] you'll count here there's about 10 or 15
[1:37:16] kings out there that abraham had to face
[1:37:19] how many servants did they have abraham
[1:37:21] counted that he had all that he had was
[1:37:24] faithful and born in his own house
[1:37:28] born in his own house the faithful
[1:37:30] servants he could depend upon it was his
[1:37:33] servants who had come under the same
[1:37:35] circumcision he had come under and was
[1:37:38] included in the same promise he was
[1:37:40] included in
[1:37:42] he said it's a perfect picture of christ
[1:37:45] and the church
[1:37:47] the holy spirit leading the faithful
[1:37:50] ones that has been born in the same
[1:37:53] house of the holy ghost where christ was
[1:37:55] born out and is pursuing after the
[1:37:58] wayward
[1:38:01] why i keep preaching about the prodigals
[1:38:03] because i'm pursuing after them i'm not
[1:38:05] giving up on one of them they're all
[1:38:07] coming home
[1:38:09] we're not leaving a hook behind i've
[1:38:11] been born in the same house the house of
[1:38:14] abraham so if he can go after the
[1:38:17] backslidden i can go after the
[1:38:19] backslidden
[1:38:21] well come on now amen pursuing after the
[1:38:24] wayward pursuing after the blacks the
[1:38:26] backslidden and listen to this and
[1:38:28] slaying every evil thing that's overcome
[1:38:33] them
[1:38:33] [Applause]
[1:38:38] hallelujah do we have some servants here
[1:38:41] that's been born of the same house that
[1:38:44] has the same faith under the same sign
[1:38:47] of seal of circumcision and you're
[1:38:49] willing to go and say let me go after
[1:38:51] that one devil you had them long enough
[1:38:53] that's a child of god take your dirty
[1:38:56] rotten hands off of me
[1:38:58] i'm coming after them in the name of
[1:39:00] jesus christ i believe it's time that
[1:39:02] the servants of god start sharpening
[1:39:05] your swords
[1:39:08] start sharpening your sores and saying
[1:39:10] we got enough of depression we got
[1:39:12] enough of anxiety we got enough of
[1:39:14] things that is tearing down the house of
[1:39:16] god i'm going after in jesus name
[1:39:19] just like we heard sunday there's uh
[1:39:21] there's servants of the house of abraham
[1:39:24] that are willing to defend the rights of
[1:39:26] the lamb
[1:39:27] [Applause]
[1:39:30] somebody want to come up and say there's
[1:39:32] no such thing as worship there's no such
[1:39:34] thing as being happy in the house of god
[1:39:36] and joy in the house of god i got a
[1:39:38] sword for that
[1:39:41] amen i have the right to be as joyful as
[1:39:43] abraham was joyful when he received the
[1:39:46] promise when i receive it i got a right
[1:39:48] to be joyful
[1:39:51] i've been born in the same house
[1:39:58] oh my
[1:39:59] slaying every evil thing
[1:40:02] i have seen right here
[1:40:06] servants of abraham take their swords
[1:40:08] and walk down and cut a lot lust off of
[1:40:10] people's lives
[1:40:12] cut addictions off of people's lives
[1:40:15] cut pornography right off
[1:40:21] got it right to it
[1:40:24] he said what is it you begin he said
[1:40:26] overcoming sin laying aside all weight
[1:40:28] speaking to people about their lusts and
[1:40:30] things they're doing and cut it all off
[1:40:32] their sicknesses and all preaching to
[1:40:34] them the gospel and bringing them back
[1:40:37] to the full fellowship with god
[1:40:42] my my my
[1:40:45] that's what we got to do that's why we
[1:40:47] got to fight for our god-given rights
[1:40:50] because as we heard sunday the devil
[1:40:52] wants to come in and take it from us
[1:40:55] make you sit down make you shut up make
[1:40:57] you
[1:40:58] you know worry about who's seeing what
[1:41:00] who's saying what no
[1:41:01] no
[1:41:03] i'm worried about his rights
[1:41:07] i'm a defender of those rights
[1:41:10] because i'm of the same house
[1:41:13] and they ain't the house of pruitt's
[1:41:15] or the house of paris's or the house of
[1:41:18] patents or
[1:41:20] house of butts or tuschner's or masons
[1:41:25] her atoms or oglesbees
[1:41:29] or dexters
[1:41:31] twiners
[1:41:34] it's not that house
[1:41:38] it's the house of god
[1:41:41] and in his house
[1:41:43] we got a right to worship
[1:41:44] him and in his house
[1:41:47] we've got a right to have an atmosphere
[1:41:49] and a place that prodigals can come home
[1:41:51] and give their heart to god
[1:41:53] in his house
[1:41:54] are you born of that house
[1:41:58] that you're willing to say you know what
