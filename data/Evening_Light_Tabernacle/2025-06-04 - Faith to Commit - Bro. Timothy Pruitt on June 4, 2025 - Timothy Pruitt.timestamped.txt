[17:33] Holy,
[17:36] [Music]
[17:38] holy,
[17:40] hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have a praise
[17:43] report from brother Jason Tagert. He
[17:47] said his mother, Sister Laura Tagert,
[17:50] called. She's been having some health
[17:52] issues. They did a scope on her to see
[17:56] if they if she may have some cancer.
[17:59] She'd been up for prayer in church for
[18:01] healing and when they did the scope,
[18:03] they didn't find anything and he wanted
[18:05] to praise the Lord for that. Amen. Well,
[18:08] thank the Lord for his grace and his
[18:10] mercy. Also, Sister Sharon Baxter had a
[18:15] surgery today to break up some kidney
[18:18] stones
[18:19] and things went well with that, but
[18:22] she's recovering. I want to pray that
[18:24] the Lord will just touch her body as she
[18:27] continues to recover from that
[18:29] procedure. Also, Brother Ben Coleman is
[18:31] continuing to need a touch in his body
[18:33] as he recovers. Remember him in prayer
[18:37] tonight. Sister Gabriel Puit requested
[18:40] prayer for her mother. She fell and
[18:42] broke several bones. She has surgery
[18:44] planned for tomorrow. So, we want to
[18:47] remember that need in prayer tonight.
[18:50] Also, brother Derek asked if we can keep
[18:53] him and sister Debbie in prayer as they
[18:56] uh fly to Washington to deal with a
[18:59] family needs there. So, pray for wisdom
[19:03] and discernment and the Lord would lead
[19:05] and guide them as they travel and deal
[19:06] with
[19:09] that. There's a number of other needs
[19:11] I'm sure represented here
[19:13] tonight. Amen. Let's just all bind
[19:16] together. If you have a need on your
[19:18] heart, you just want to lift up to the
[19:19] Lord
[19:20] tonight. Just tell him how great he is
[19:23] and how
[19:25] wonderful. Amen. I believe that the sick
[19:27] are healed and the dead are raised at
[19:29] the sound of his name. Amen. Let's go to
[19:32] him together in prayer.
[19:34] Father, Lord, we thank you that we can
[19:36] come together, Lord, and bring our needs
[19:39] to you,
[19:40] [Music]
[19:41] Father. Lord, you would just simply tell
[19:43] us to ask and it shall be given.
[19:48] Seek, Lord, you see the needs that are
[19:50] on the heart. Some that are very
[19:52] pressing, Lord. Lord, some that have
[19:55] been seeking answers maybe for days or
[19:58] months or even years, Lord, looking for
[20:01] direction. But Lord, I pray that you'll
[20:03] come down, Lord. Move amongst each pew
[20:05] tonight. Give the answer, Lord, that
[20:08] those are seeking for, Lord. Give the
[20:10] healing that those Lord that are lifting
[20:12] up their hands to you and asking for.
[20:15] Lord, some that have just recently hurt,
[20:18] Lord. This one of Sister Gabriel Puit,
[20:21] her mother that hurt, fell and hurt her
[20:23] bones, Lord. Lord, I pray you'll touch
[20:26] her. But Lord, there's others that are
[20:28] dealing with hurt deep down inside,
[20:30] Lord. Physical, spiritual, family hurts,
[20:34] Lord. You see what those are. I pray
[20:36] you'll move on this congregation. Lord,
[20:39] touch each one. Father, you know my
[20:42] needs, Lord. You know the needs of the
[20:45] musicians up here, Lord. The needs of,
[20:47] Lord, each one in the pews in the
[20:49] congregation, Lord. Lord, we lift our
[20:52] hands to you where our help comes
[20:54] from. Lord, we give ourselves to you,
[20:57] Lord. We give our worship to you, Lord.
[21:00] Lord, we want this tabernacle to be a
[21:02] sweet smelling savor to you, Lord. that
[21:05] you would just move in, Lord, and dwell
[21:07] amongst us, Lord. Lord, that you would
[21:10] feel welcome to come in, Lord, and s
[21:12] with us, Lord. Lord, I pray that you'll
[21:15] touch each heart, Father. Touch those
[21:18] that are streaming, unable to be here
[21:19] tonight. What? Whatever the situation
[21:21] would be, Lord, I pray you'll go to
[21:23] them, Lord. Those that are shut in,
[21:26] Lord, feeble, weaken body, those that
[21:29] are
[21:30] traveling. Lord, you see the broken,
[21:32] Lord.
[21:34] Lord, you see the
[21:36] wearied. Lord, I just am reminded of the
[21:40] word, Lord,
[21:43] that my mother and my father forsake me,
[21:46] the Lord will take me up, Lord. And if
[21:49] there's someone tonight that feels
[21:51] forsaken, I pray that they'll feel your
[21:53] arms just come and wrap around them
[21:56] tonight, Lord. Show your love. May the
[21:59] peace of God just come upon this
[22:01] congregation, Lord, upon each need that
[22:04] was spoken, Lord, and the many
[22:07] unspoken, Lord. Anoint this place with
[22:10] your presence. We pray be with brother
[22:11] Timothy as he prayers prepares to
[22:13] minister,
[22:15] Lord. Lord, the gift you placed in his
[22:17] life, Lord. I pray that you'll use it in
[22:20] a supernatural way tonight. Be with the
[22:23] tithes and the offering. We ask in Jesus
[22:25] Christ's

[36:49] Lord, for you to have rulership and
[36:52] leadership in our thoughts and mind.
[36:55] what we would have to say tonight. Lord,
[36:57] we we don't want our own thinking, but
[36:59] Lord, we want you, Lord. We just ask
[37:01] God, you'd come and move and touch
[37:03] hearts and lives. We pray by the word.
[37:06] We ask it in Jesus
[37:08] name.
[37:10] Amen. And you turn to First Peter
[37:13] 4. Verse 12. It's always good to be in
[37:17] the house of the Lord.
[37:23] Amen.
[37:28] 1 Peter
[37:30] 4 verse 12 it says, "Beloved, think it
[37:34] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[37:37] which is to try you as though some
[37:40] strange thing happened unto you. But
[37:43] rejoice in as much as you are partakers
[37:45] of Christ's suffering, that when his
[37:47] glory shall be revealed, you may be glad
[37:50] also with exceeding joy. If you be
[37:53] reproached for the name of Christ, happy
[37:55] are you. For the spirit of glory and of
[37:58] God resteth upon you, and on their part,
[38:01] he is evil spoken of, but on your part
[38:03] he is glorified. But let none of you
[38:06] suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as
[38:08] an evildoer, as a busy body in other
[38:10] men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as
[38:13] a Christian, let him not be ashamed. But
[38:16] let him glorify God on this behalf. For
[38:19] the time has come that judgments m must
[38:22] begin at the house of God. And if it
[38:25] first begin at us, what shall the end be
[38:27] of them that obey not the gospel of God?
[38:30] And if the righteous scarcely be saved,
[38:33] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[38:36] appear? Wherefore let them that suffer
[38:39] according to the will of God commit the
[38:42] keeping of their souls to him in
[38:45] welloing as unto a faithful creator.
[38:49] Amen. We let you be
[38:52] seated. Something has been on my heart
[38:54] for a little while like to speak to you
[38:56] this Eden
[38:58] on faith to
[39:01] commit. Amen. I I'd like to look at
[39:03] again this this last verse. It says,
[39:06] "Wherefore letting them that suffer
[39:08] according to the will of God commit the
[39:12] keeping of their souls to him in
[39:15] welloing as unto a faithful creator."
[39:19] How many is thankful he's faithful? that
[39:21] you might be going through something
[39:23] tonight and situations and and things
[39:26] that that that sometimes may surprise
[39:29] you in in life and not expecting it to
[39:32] happen or not expecting it to go quite
[39:34] the way that it's went. But amen, we we
[39:37] must realize that we we're we're we're
[39:41] walking in the will of God and God is
[39:44] has his has his hand upon our lives. I
[39:47] also want to look at this a little
[39:48] further on this word commit. Also find
[39:51] it in Proverbs 16 and verse 13. It says,
[39:54] "Commit thy works unto the Lord and thy
[39:57] thoughts shall be established." Now, if
[40:00] you look at this word commit, it means
[40:02] to a release of something. Amen.
[40:05] Releasing it by letting it roll from you
[40:08] onto something else. A release as in
[40:11] taking your burdens to the Lord and
[40:14] leaving them there. Amen. The only way
[40:16] you can get relief from your burden is
[40:19] to leave them in God's hands. Amen. If
[40:21] you continually put bring them back and
[40:23] you continually worry about them or you
[40:25] continually look at them or you
[40:27] continually dwell upon them, amen,
[40:30] you're under the weight of that burden.
[40:31] But unless unless you can take that
[40:33] burden, that burden that maybe has
[40:36] crushed your spirit or or it's a burden
[40:38] that you've tried to work out on your
[40:40] own and you've gotten it all tangled up.
[40:43] If you'll let him take it, if you'll let
[40:45] him put it in order. If you'll, Amen.
[40:47] Commit it to him and trust him. Amen.
[40:50] With all your heart. Proverbs 16:3, I
[40:52] read it in a different a different
[40:54] translation. It says, "Roll your works
[40:56] or your ways upon the Lord or commit and
[41:00] trust them holy to him, and he will
[41:03] cause your thoughts to become agreeable
[41:06] to his
[41:07] will." Come on now. That's very
[41:10] important because Amen. It's very
[41:12] important that our mind or our thoughts
[41:14] become agreeable to what he has or what
[41:16] he desires. Amen. This is where Peter
[41:19] would say, "Think it not strange." In
[41:21] other words, don't have these thoughts
[41:22] that this is a strange thing that you're
[41:24] going through this trial or you're going
[41:26] through this situation because this is
[41:29] according to the will of God. And if
[41:31] he's a faithful creator and he's allowed
[41:33] you to go through this or he's allowed
[41:35] you to walk in this certain path whether
[41:37] it be whatever that you're facing
[41:39] sickness or situations of your life if
[41:42] God has allowed it God has a way through
[41:45] it. God has a answer. Amen. And we we
[41:48] must be willing to to look at our own
[41:50] thoughts and our own thinking and submit
[41:53] it to the will of God. Amen. that in pro
[41:55] in Psalms 55 and verse 22 it says cast
[41:59] your burden on the Lord or release the
[42:02] weight of it. Release the weight of it
[42:04] by allowing yourself to bring it
[42:07] allowing it to roll off of you onto
[42:09] other something else and he will sustain
[42:12] you. He will sustain you. He will never
[42:15] allow the righteous to be moved or made
[42:18] to slip or to fall or to fail.
[42:22] Hallelujah. That's something worth
[42:23] shouting about right there. Amen. He
[42:25] will sustain you and he will not let you
[42:28] fall. He will not let you fail if you
[42:31] will release your burden upon the Lord.
[42:33] And and it's more than just talking to
[42:35] the Lord about it. It's more than just
[42:37] praying to the Lord about it. It's more
[42:39] than that. It's actually allowing that
[42:42] weight, amen, to be transferred off of
[42:44] you onto him. Amen. He's more than able
[42:47] to bear it. Amen. He's more than able to
[42:50] carry the need. Brother Brandon would
[42:51] talk about this. He'd said, "The most
[42:53] powerful weapon that God can put in the
[42:56] hand of man is committal." It's
[42:59] committal. Amen. And the confession,
[43:00] it'll do it every time you believe it
[43:03] and you accept it upon the bases and
[43:05] believe it and stay with it. Confess it.
[43:07] He said, "We know when a lot of people
[43:09] look at symptoms, they always go around
[43:10] and say, "Well, I I don't feel any
[43:12] better." That doesn't have one thing to
[43:14] do with it because it's not what you
[43:16] feel, it's what you believe. Amen. If if
[43:20] he he said, "If there's any man that had
[43:21] a good case of symptoms, it was Jonah.
[43:24] He was backslid. His hands were tied
[43:26] behind him and he was in a sea and
[43:28] swallowed up by a fish in the belly of a
[43:31] fish and down in the bottom of the sea
[43:33] and and a man knows that a fish, you
[43:35] know, when he feeds, he goes to the
[43:36] bottom and and he's sitting there on the
[43:38] bottom and it looks impossible and it
[43:40] looks uh like it's no way out." And you
[43:43] know what? What Jonah had to do? He had
[43:45] to align his thoughts with the will of
[43:47] God. Amen. because his thoughts got him
[43:50] in the play in that belly of the whale.
[43:52] His thoughts got him there. God told
[43:54] him, "You're to go to down to Nineveh."
[43:56] And he thought, "No, I'm going to go
[43:57] over this way. I'm going to go to
[43:58] Tarses. I I got a different path. I got
[44:01] a different way or I got a way of
[44:03] figuring it out on my own. And I got a
[44:05] way God this is really how God wanted to
[44:07] be." And so, he finds himself in the
[44:09] wrong direction, but God knows how to
[44:12] get you back in his will. Sometimes it's
[44:14] going to hurt. Sometimes there's going
[44:16] to be a lot of stuff you go through, but
[44:18] God knows exactly how to get you back in
[44:21] his will and in the place that he
[44:23] desires for you to be in. And so he
[44:25] finds himself in the belly of this well
[44:27] and and he and he comes to this place. I
[44:29] have to commit now my situation to God
[44:32] because I can't get myself out of here.
[44:35] I can't pray myself out of here as far
[44:37] as my own in my own abilities or anyway.
[44:39] I have to I can't do that. I can't I
[44:42] can't do anything on my own. And so he
[44:44] what did he do? He said, "I'm going to
[44:46] turn my eyes, Amen, towards the temple
[44:49] of God." And he maybe he didn't even
[44:51] know which way it was. So by faith, he
[44:53] committed his situation to God. He said,
[44:56] "God, I I've done wrong. I've found
[44:58] myself in this situation and and I've
[45:00] come to this place and and I'm I'm just
[45:03] going to commit it to you." And and when
[45:05] he committed his will and his way to
[45:07] God, and then God brought him to where
[45:10] he wanted him to be. And so that's
[45:12] exactly how it is with us. He said, "If
[45:13] God did it for Jonah under those
[45:15] circumstances, if he could believe God
[45:18] under those circumstances, how much more
[45:20] you and I ought to believe God tonight
[45:23] that no matter what we're going through,
[45:24] maybe we made mistakes. Maybe it's
[45:26] because we what we've done, we're in the
[45:28] condition or the situation, maybe it's
[45:31] not what we've done, but maybe it's just
[45:33] we find oursel in this place and
[45:35] sometimes it's a crushing thing.
[45:37] Sometimes it's so weighing upon our
[45:39] hearts and our lives. But God knows
[45:41] exactly how to get you where he wants
[45:44] you to be. Because God's eyes is not
[45:46] just upon this temporary flesh or this
[45:49] temporary world or this temporary things
[45:52] that we're living in. His eye and his
[45:54] goal is something more than what you saw
[45:56] today or what you'll see tomorrow. His
[45:59] goal is eternity. So he's going to do
[46:01] whatever he's got to do to get you
[46:03] there.
[46:05] Amen. But we go to reason and we go to
[46:08] wonder and we go to and it builds
[46:09] burdens and it builds weight upon our
[46:12] soul and upon our heart and you know you
[46:14] we you can't reason it out. Sometimes
[46:16] God's ways are so hard to the human mind
[46:19] to comprehend. You might just think it's
[46:21] ridiculous. But faith is also ridiculous
[46:24] to a carnal mind. It's crazy to anything
[46:27] to accept God and the one who has the
[46:29] faith. Amen. But God by fa But you by
[46:32] faith can believe things that your eye
[46:35] or your mind does not declare. Amen. You
[46:38] cannot see it, but it's because you
[46:41] believe it. Sure. But reasoning comes
[46:43] and it comes against the word and it
[46:45] comes against the anointing and it comes
[46:47] against the power and it comes against
[46:49] your faith and it gets in your mind to
[46:51] try to muddle it up and try to think
[46:54] about this and why this why ain't this
[46:56] turned out this way and why ain't why
[46:58] ain't I already received my healing or
[47:01] why ain't I already received the promise
[47:02] or why hasn't my child already returned
[47:05] back why hasn't and it begins to become
[47:08] a crushing weight
[47:11] and a crushing ing
[47:13] burden. The only way to get rid of it is
[47:16] to turn your faith back to what God
[47:19] said. God is able to perform what he
[47:23] says.
[47:24] That settles it. He is a faithful
[47:27] creator. Amen. So, he's he's able. Don't
[47:30] don't try, well, now, you know, well,
[47:32] how could this be? We're, you know,
[47:34] we're living in a modern time and we we
[47:36] ought to have this and that and keep
[47:38] that out of your mind. Don't even take
[47:40] another thought. Just take God at his
[47:42] word. You might ha have you might make
[47:45] the decision right now that what God
[47:47] says God can keep. It's not my business
[47:50] to figure out how he's going to do it.
[47:53] If God said it, God's going to keep it.
[47:55] Amen. I don't have to figure it out
[47:57] because if I do that, I'm working in my
[48:00] own intellectual
[48:02] realms. Come on, somebody. How much
[48:04] trouble have we got ourselves in working
[48:07] in our own intellectual realms? in our
[48:10] own intellectual thoughts and our own
[48:12] intellectual abilities and we try to
[48:14] figure this out and we try to do this
[48:16] and we try to do that and meanwhile God
[48:18] is saying look if you'll just roll that
[48:20] over on me I've already got the answer
[48:23] for it and you don't have to be under
[48:26] that crushing weight or that crushing
[48:28] burden of that because God's able to
[48:30] perform what he said.
[48:33] This is what Eleaser found. He found
[48:35] when he was sent to go find a Rebecca,
[48:38] you know, he he was under this burden
[48:40] like, okay, I've been sent to find this
[48:43] the right woman for Isaac. That's quite
[48:45] a burden, right? To find to try to put
[48:47] two people together, that's a burden.
[48:49] And so he he's trying to figure it out.
[48:51] And he said, I got to find this right
[48:53] right lady for Rebecca. And so he begins
[48:56] to pray and he he commits it to God. He
[48:58] said, "God, I'm going to say it. I'm
[49:00] going to ask you that that that she not
[49:02] only gives me a drink, but she also
[49:04] waters my
[49:05] camels." And he just committed to God,
[49:07] and that'll be the one that you have
[49:09] chosen. I can't make this choice. I
[49:13] can't do this on my own. I can't in my
[49:15] own mind pick the right one. I I can't.
[49:17] If I do, I'm going to pick the wrong
[49:19] one. No doubt. Amen. We saw when men
[49:22] picked, they picked the wrong king. They
[49:24] picked Saul, right? Because he was head
[49:25] and shoulders above everybody else. He
[49:27] was the biggest, tallest, baddest,
[49:29] whatever kind good, most good-looking,
[49:31] whatever he was. It's something stood
[49:33] out to him in front of other men. But
[49:34] that ain't who God picked.
[49:37] God picked somebody that nobody else
[49:39] picked.
[49:41] Matter of fact, his own brothers didn't
[49:42] pick him. His own daddy didn't pick him.
[49:45] Nobody in his family thought surely this
[49:47] is the one. No, they just left him out
[49:48] there tending sheep when Samuel came to
[49:50] anoint somebody. And he goes down all
[49:52] the sons. He said, "Do you not have
[49:54] anybody else?"
[49:56] He said, "Yeah, well, I got one more."
[49:57] And you know, but it wasn't it wasn't it
[50:01] wasn't who God who they thought God
[50:04] would want cuz he was just a little
[50:06] humble shepherd boy and this but see
[50:08] God's way beyond our thinking.
[50:12] Amen. So, you know why, you know, if if
[50:14] God is so far above our thinking, why
[50:17] would we trade what God said for what
[50:21] somebody thinks?
[50:25] Come on, somebody. Amen. A lot of people
[50:27] get under burdens of what somebody
[50:29] thinks about them or what somebody
[50:31] thinks about their situation or what
[50:33] somebody thinks, how they are, how they
[50:35] look or how they act or or how they sing
[50:37] or whatever. All kind of burdens get put
[50:40] upon them in this complexes because
[50:42] they're under what somebody thinks.
[50:44] Listen, I'm not under what somebody
[50:45] thinks. I want to be under what God
[50:48] said. Cuz the one that is thinking that,
[50:51] they ain't the one that they ain't the
[50:52] one that called you. They ain't the one
[50:54] that elected you. They ain't the one
[50:56] that bled for you. They ain't the one
[50:57] that died for you. They're not the one
[50:59] that rose again for you. I'll take what
[51:01] he said about me.
[51:06] Amen. So he comes to this place. Let it
[51:09] be your choice, Lord. I'm committing it
[51:11] to you. I I cannot make this choice. He
[51:15] said, ' If we could only learn to be a
[51:16] trusted servant of God like that, we
[51:18] could commit things to God. It's the
[51:20] most powerful thing I know of. Committ
[51:23] Commit thy ways unto the Lord. Commit
[51:25] your thinking to him. If you're sick and
[51:27] the doctors can't help you no more, just
[51:30] commit your case to God and act like
[51:32] it's already done.
[51:35] Something will have to take place cuz he
[51:37] is a faithful creator.
[51:40] Hallelujah. Amen. The word of God is a
[51:43] seed though and the seed is planted in
[51:44] the ground and that seed has to be
[51:48] watered. It has to be watered and it
[51:51] springs forth into life. And I I love I
[51:53] have to go back to to Eleazar as he went
[51:56] to Isaac or went to find a bride for
[51:58] Isaac. Here's here Rebecca come to the
[52:00] well and she said and he and he asked
[52:02] for a drink and she said, "I'll not only
[52:03] just give you a drink, I'll water your
[52:05] camels also."
[52:09] Listen, that was a lot of water. That
[52:12] wasn't just a little cup full out of the
[52:13] out of the water water fountain out
[52:15] there. That was barrels and buckets of
[52:18] water. Camels drink a lot. Amen. She had
[52:21] to make a committ. She had to commit
[52:24] herself to to to this and something
[52:27] moved on her to make this commitment
[52:29] back to God. And God and and Elijah
[52:32] recognized that was her that is the
[52:33] bride for Isaac. And brother Ron breaks
[52:36] right into that and it's so beautiful if
[52:37] you study it. He said, "What was she
[52:39] doing? She was actually watering the
[52:42] beast that was going to take her back to
[52:44] her Isaac.
[52:46] And he said, "What do you do with your
[52:48] praises and and water of thanksgiving
[52:51] and and when you're in a trial and and
[52:53] you're in a test and you're in a
[52:54] situation, but you just continue to
[52:56] water the word of God and you continue
[52:59] to water the seed of God and you
[53:01] continue to water it day and night and
[53:03] day and night, it will bring forth a
[53:06] harvest." Amen. What you don't realize,
[53:08] you're watering the very thing that's
[53:10] going to take you back to your Isaac.
[53:17] But this is why Satan wants to keep us
[53:18] under a
[53:19] burden cuz he wants to keep our arms
[53:22] full so we can't keep our arms
[53:25] up. Come on
[53:27] now. Amen. You know what I'm saying? You
[53:30] got burdens you're you're carrying and
[53:32] you're you're carrying them from one day
[53:34] to the next day and the next day to the
[53:35] next day and the next service to the
[53:37] next service, the next service and it
[53:39] keeps you down and depressed and worried
[53:42] about this or worried about that. How's
[53:45] this going to work out? How's that going
[53:46] to happen? And before you know it, you
[53:48] done been through five weeks of services
[53:50] and hadn't got nothing from God because
[53:52] of the burden Satan has allowed to be
[53:54] placed there or you have allowed
[53:56] actually to lay there in your life.
[54:00] Come on, somebody. Because we don't
[54:02] trust him enough to know he has the
[54:04] answer. That he has the ability. He can
[54:07] move. He can move when there seems to be
[54:10] no way of moving. Amen. Every He said,
[54:12] "Every apple that's in a tree is in the
[54:14] tree when it's a sprig." No more than
[54:18] that. You know, I get I get amazed. walk
[54:23] out into my yard, there's a little tree
[54:25] that I planted and now it's getting to
[54:27] be a big tree showing me my age. But I
[54:31] remember there's a big magnolia tree in
[54:32] my front yard now that I remember that
[54:35] when my dad planted it was only a twig.
[54:37] It looked like it looked like it'll
[54:39] never amount to nothing. Just about that
[54:42] tall. But you know what he did? He
[54:44] committed it to the ground.
[54:47] And now I didn't notice and I didn't
[54:48] never see him go out every day pull it
[54:51] out to see if it growed any or to see if
[54:54] the roots are bigger. He didn't do that.
[54:56] He committed it to the ground. He put it
[54:59] in the ground believing the ground was
[55:01] there, the nutrients and the atmosphere
[55:03] would be there, the sun, and he would
[55:05] bring water and he would just water that
[55:07] or he'd bring fertilize and he would
[55:09] fertilize around. And now today that
[55:11] thing is as tall nearly as this
[55:13] building if not taller. way out.
[55:16] Beautiful magnolia tree. It's got leaves
[55:19] and and flowers on it. It It's got
[55:22] wonderful shade and but everything that
[55:24] tree ever had was in that little twig.
[55:28] But it just needed somebody to have
[55:30] faith in it. Amen. That to have faith
[55:34] that the ground would have what it would
[55:36] have need of and the water would supply
[55:38] the need of the thirst and the
[55:39] fertilized would give the lack. Hey,
[55:41] make up for the lack. And it would have
[55:43] somebody that had faith that this
[55:45] thing's going to be a big tree. It
[55:47] didn't look like a big tree. It looked
[55:49] like it would never be
[55:51] anything. But today we look at it and
[55:54] today we want and wonder at the big old
[55:56] beautiful magnolia flowers and the smell
[55:58] it gives off and the big beautiful
[56:02] leaves not realizing one day it was just
[56:05] a
[56:07] twig. Come on.
[56:10] This is what we got to do with the word
[56:11] of
[56:12] God. You plant a the word of God is a
[56:15] seed. He tell that's what he said. The
[56:18] sewer went forth to sew a seed and the
[56:20] and the fulfillment or the uh um think
[56:24] of the trying to think of the word. But
[56:26] when he when he came and he made the
[56:27] parable
[56:28] plain sometimes your bra your brain just
[56:31] don't work.
[56:33] Sorry. Made the parable plain to him. He
[56:36] said the seed is the word of God.
[56:40] And he and he showed there that that
[56:42] that seed has everything that it'll ever
[56:44] have on the inside of it if it's left in
[56:47] the right place.
[56:50] It will not grow in your worry.
[56:54] It will not produce one fruit in your
[56:56] fredding
[56:59] and you're digging it up and wondering
[57:00] if it's going to happen or how it's
[57:02] going to be and you're worried about
[57:04] this and you're wor it's not going to
[57:06] grow one bit. But if you can leave it in
[57:09] the right place in the bed of faith,
[57:13] that faith will grab a hold of it and
[57:15] it'll start putting out roots and it'll
[57:17] start putting out limbs. It'll start
[57:19] putting out leaves and it'll start
[57:21] putting out fruit.
[57:23] Come on, somebody. Amen. This is why we
[57:25] can't get we can't get disheartened
[57:27] about people sometimes. Sometime we
[57:29] don't see growth right away and we
[57:30] wonder, man, are they really a
[57:31] Christian? Look. Amen. Leave them in
[57:33] that place. If they stay in that
[57:34] atmosphere, if there's a seed on the
[57:37] inside of them, it will come to life.
[57:41] It will grow.
[57:46] Blooms and and and limbs and stuff don't
[57:49] don't just come out of thin air. They
[57:51] come out of the ground. But the bloom is
[57:54] already in the tree. The apple, if it's
[57:56] apple tree, is already in the tree. It's
[57:58] already in the seed. The tree planted in
[58:01] the ground, the only thing he has to do
[58:02] is drink. And when it goes to drinking,
[58:04] it has to drink more than this
[58:07] portion. Come on, somebody. Drink more
[58:11] than this portion so it can spread out.
[58:13] It can push out. That's the way we're
[58:15] planted in Christ Jesus through an
[58:16] inexhaustible fountain of life. We start
[58:19] drinking and the more we drink, the more
[58:21] we can push out.
[58:23] Amen. Amen. That's the gift that God has
[58:26] called you to. Amen. The trouble it is
[58:28] you don't drink. You got to drink. You
[58:30] don't believe is inexhaustible. You
[58:32] don't maybe believe he's a faithful
[58:34] creator, but if you'll keep drinking,
[58:37] you'll keep pouring in the wool and and
[58:39] the wine we heard about Sunday and
[58:41] eating of the bread of life, amen, it
[58:43] will bring forth fruit.
[58:46] It will bring healing out of your body.
[58:48] It will bring amen peace in your mind.
[58:54] The devil don't care how much you come
[58:57] as long as you don't drink,
[59:01] right?
[59:02] He could care
[59:03] less. He comes to church every time,
[59:06] too. But he don't
[59:10] drink. You know, we've we've used this
[59:13] analogy before,
[59:15] but you know, when we had
[59:19] goats, you couldn't make them drink
[59:21] nothing or any animal for that matter.
[59:24] Even just goats. Can't make them do
[59:26] nothing. I mean, if you see them,
[59:28] they're sick and you see they have a
[59:30] need or a situation. And my my my my
[59:32] dad, brother Tim, was one of the best in
[59:35] in our area with goats and because he
[59:37] raised them for so long, knew so much
[59:38] about them, even vets would call him up
[59:40] and get get advice from
[59:42] him. And here here he would see some he
[59:46] was very good at it. He would check
[59:47] their eyelids or he would check
[59:49] different parts of their body, their
[59:51] hair, and different things to see if
[59:52] they had parasites. And he said, "That
[59:54] one, Timothy, that one needs worming.
[59:55] And then you need to give them this much
[59:57] of this and that much of that." And I'd
[59:58] go in there and I'd draw it up and I'd
[1:00:00] come out there and I'd grab that goat by
[1:00:01] the by the neck and I'd hold it. They
[1:00:03] didn't want that stuff I about to give
[1:00:05] them. But it was good for them. And I'd
[1:00:08] poke it down their throat and I'd push
[1:00:10] it in. They didn't have a
[1:00:12] choice. Oh, they might have ran around a
[1:00:14] minute, but I was going to catch them
[1:00:15] sooner or later.
[1:00:18] Amen. And so we'd catch them. would grab
[1:00:19] them, put it down their throat, and a
[1:00:21] few days later, you'd see their their
[1:00:23] skin start showing a better color and
[1:00:25] their hair being better and their
[1:00:26] eyelids not being pale, but back to pink
[1:00:28] again. And the destroyed that medicine
[1:00:31] went and destroyed the parasites within
[1:00:33] their body. Amen. They didn't have a
[1:00:35] choice. They they didn't have a choice.
[1:00:36] That's the difference between an animal
[1:00:38] and you.
[1:00:40] Amen. We can bring the water. We can
[1:00:42] bring the food. We can bring the
[1:00:43] nutrients. We We can bring those things.
[1:00:45] The service after service, the tapes
[1:00:48] have them. Amen. You can have them. But
[1:00:50] if you don't eat and you don't drink,
[1:00:51] you won't receive the benefits.
[1:00:57] There's a fountain open flowing freely.
[1:01:00] Just drink till you just can't drink no
[1:01:04] more. Hallelujah. Fill my cup,
[1:01:09] Lord. Be drinking from the saucer
[1:01:12] because your cup's overflowing.
[1:01:14] Amen. There's a fountain open. It ain't
[1:01:16] a little trickle. It's a fountain. Just
[1:01:18] drink till you can't drink no more.
[1:01:20] Drink more than what is your
[1:01:23] allotment. Amen. He said that's what's
[1:01:26] the matter with Christians. They don't
[1:01:27] drink enough. Well, if you took that
[1:01:30] little clip, you could cause a lot of
[1:01:31] problems, couldn't
[1:01:34] you? They don't drink enough. But you
[1:01:37] want to drink till you just spread out
[1:01:40] and you let somebody else see what you
[1:01:43] got. Amen. You push out. You get a
[1:01:45] testimony. You commit it to God. You
[1:01:47] believe it. You step out on it. You
[1:01:49] claim God's promise. You commit it to
[1:01:51] God. Commit thy ways to the Lord and he
[1:01:54] will bring it to pass. Whatever you
[1:01:56] want.
[1:01:59] But he can't do it as long as you're
[1:02:01] holding
[1:02:02] it.
[1:02:04] Hello. He can't do it as long as you
[1:02:07] holding it. Saying, "Now, I I I'll just
[1:02:11] see if I'm any better. I'll see if this
[1:02:13] will work." No. You commit it to him and
[1:02:16] forget about the rest of it.
[1:02:19] It's not what you see, it's what you
[1:02:21] believe. So, when you sew a seed, you
[1:02:23] don't dig it up every morning. How
[1:02:25] many's ever done that? No. You don't dig
[1:02:27] it up every morning and see if it if
[1:02:29] it's come to life. No. If you did did,
[1:02:31] that seed will never come up. You got to
[1:02:33] plant it and commit it to the earth and
[1:02:35] leave it alone. It's up to nature, God,
[1:02:38] to water it and to see that it produces
[1:02:39] what it's supposed to. That's what you
[1:02:41] do with the word of God. accept it in a
[1:02:43] good heart, fertilized, and all the
[1:02:45] creepers, all the rocky places, all the
[1:02:48] stony doubts taken away in a good rich
[1:02:50] soil of faith, and you believe it, and
[1:02:52] you commit it to God, you walk away, and
[1:02:54] you testify that you have received what
[1:02:56] God has promised you. Amen. And he is
[1:02:59] the high priest of your confession to
[1:03:02] make anything right that you confess
[1:03:04] that he's already done. That's the
[1:03:06] gospel.
[1:03:11] So what are we scared about? We should
[1:03:14] just believe. And then the master
[1:03:16] because the master said all things work
[1:03:19] together for the good.
[1:03:22] Nothing can harm us.
[1:03:26] Hello. Death is only a a a a vehicle to
[1:03:30] get you into the other realms.
[1:03:34] Nothing can harm us. Just as peaceful we
[1:03:36] ought to be. He said, "Just as peaceful
[1:03:38] as little children playing
[1:03:41] around."
[1:03:43] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Not all
[1:03:46] our spirits all tore up and worried and
[1:03:48] threatened. It's easy to do, right?
[1:03:50] We're humans. But we got to be reminded
[1:03:53] by the word. That's not what he created
[1:03:55] us to be. Amen. He didn't create you to
[1:03:59] be a warrior. He created you to be an
[1:04:02] overcomer.
[1:04:04] He didn't create you to be a doubter. He
[1:04:06] created you to be somebody that
[1:04:08] believes.
[1:04:12] He said, "I I used to have to shift for
[1:04:14] myself. I assume that means fight for
[1:04:16] myself or stand for myself. But since I
[1:04:18] found him to be my father or try to make
[1:04:20] a way for myself, he does that for me. I
[1:04:23] found out in this my 21 years of
[1:04:25] experience of preaching the gospel, any
[1:04:28] job that's too big for my Lord to
[1:04:30] handle, what's the use of me trying?"
[1:04:34] Hello, somebody. Amen. If it's too big
[1:04:36] for him, it's too big for you.
[1:04:40] But I can promise it might be too big
[1:04:41] for you, but it's never too big for him.
[1:04:44] Amen.
[1:04:46] Amen. He's more than able. I just
[1:04:48] committed to him cuz he said he would do
[1:04:50] it. And if he can't do it, I know
[1:04:52] there's no need of me trying it. So if
[1:04:54] we just live peacefully and go on, he
[1:04:57] will bring it out. All right. So there's
[1:04:59] no need of getting fredded up or stewing
[1:05:01] about it. He's going to make it all all
[1:05:04] right.
[1:05:07] Hallelujah. He might not do it on this
[1:05:09] side, but I can promise you one day it's
[1:05:11] all going to be made be right.
[1:05:16] I love that. You can go look it up in
[1:05:18] the Mother's Day message where he's
[1:05:19] speaking. He said, "One day those
[1:05:21] majestic hands will come down and
[1:05:24] untangle all those knots that have been
[1:05:26] formed in our
[1:05:31] minds." Hallelujah.
[1:05:34] Jesus said, "Every word of God's a
[1:05:36] seed." Every time you see see this Bible
[1:05:39] say anything, it's a seed. We're sowed
[1:05:41] with the incorruptible seed of God. And
[1:05:43] if a man will take any divine promise of
[1:05:45] God in his heart and water it with
[1:05:47] faith, it'll produce exactly what it
[1:05:49] said it would do. Don't care what it is.
[1:05:51] Just take God's promise. If you plant
[1:05:53] the seed and you go over it every
[1:05:54] morning, dig it up and see if it's
[1:05:56] growing. It won't grow. Never will.
[1:05:58] Commit it to God and leave it there. He
[1:06:01] said, "Of course, I'm just showing you
[1:06:03] the it's all all through the message if
[1:06:05] you look at it on committed to God. Your
[1:06:07] first duty when you get sick, of course,
[1:06:09] is go to your
[1:06:12] doctor." Well, that kind of stunned some
[1:06:14] of us, didn't it? He does all he can do.
[1:06:16] When he does all of he can't do no more,
[1:06:19] you have a right to go to the great
[1:06:21] specialist. We're not against doctors. I
[1:06:23] have many precious doctors friends that
[1:06:25] are my buddies, fine men, but who
[1:06:27] believe in God. I pray for them and they
[1:06:29] pray for me. That's right. We get a
[1:06:30] patient and they can't do nothing with.
[1:06:32] Many times doctors, of course, I hold I
[1:06:34] hold back their name. Many they're not
[1:06:35] filled with the Holy Ghost and things,
[1:06:36] but they're they're good men. They say,
[1:06:38] "Well, Brother Brown, there's nothing I
[1:06:39] can do with this case. If you'll just
[1:06:41] take it." I say, "Send it over. I can't
[1:06:44] do it, but Jesus can." I'll commit it to
[1:06:47] him and let him do it. That's fine.
[1:06:51] I I I know and and it gets in the
[1:06:54] message ranks that that, you know, we
[1:06:56] shouldn't we shouldn't go to doctors. We
[1:06:58] don't believe in doctors. That's not in
[1:06:59] the message.
[1:07:01] Amen. You can find it all through the
[1:07:03] message. Brother Brandham even had a had
[1:07:04] a vision about somebody telling them to
[1:07:06] go to a doctor and he had a certain
[1:07:08] treatment for them and they would get
[1:07:09] well.
[1:07:12] Come on, somebody. Amen. But it's not
[1:07:14] denying your faith to go to a doctor
[1:07:16] because we know doctors cannot heal.
[1:07:20] They can assist. They can do things to
[1:07:22] assist. It's like setting a bone. They
[1:07:23] can set it, but they can't heal it. It's
[1:07:25] God that does the healing.
[1:07:32] And so you can look at this thought on
[1:07:34] committing even with a broken arm. What
[1:07:36] would happen to a broken arm if you took
[1:07:38] your cast off every day to see if it's
[1:07:41] healed yet? Has there anybody ever
[1:07:43] thought about doing? No, you leave it
[1:07:45] committed. You believe a doctor's word,
[1:07:48] he'll take it off in a few weeks or
[1:07:49] whatever it is. And you just leave it
[1:07:51] there and you walk around with it, get
[1:07:53] people to sign it, whatever.
[1:07:56] Sometimes it's a badge of honor,
[1:07:59] whatever. And you got faith that you've
[1:08:02] committed what the doctor has done that
[1:08:04] it's going to be all right when he takes
[1:08:06] it off. Well, if we can have we can have
[1:08:08] faith in what a doctor has done, how
[1:08:10] much more can we have faith in what God
[1:08:12] said?
[1:08:14] Because what God says is what God does.
[1:08:22] There's so many here and I I don't
[1:08:23] really have time to go through all of
[1:08:24] them, but he it's it's a theme through
[1:08:26] the message. If you start looking up
[1:08:28] seeds and you start looking up
[1:08:29] committing and and all those things you
[1:08:32] it's incredible a lot of the things that
[1:08:34] he says about it, how to how to receive
[1:08:37] healing is is committing it to
[1:08:39] God, allowing God, Amen, to work that
[1:08:43] work in you. It's not you can't heal
[1:08:45] yourself,
[1:08:47] but God can.
[1:08:49] You can't deliver yourself, but God can
[1:08:51] deliver you. Come on, somebody. Maybe
[1:08:54] there's somebody here with a with a
[1:08:56] crushing weight that's you've been
[1:08:58] worried and you've been just tore up and
[1:09:00] you don't know. Give it to him.
[1:09:04] Say, "God, I it does and done me a bit
[1:09:07] of good worried about this. Ain't done
[1:09:09] nothing but maybe cause my blood
[1:09:11] pressure to go up and other things go
[1:09:13] on. That's all it does." Listen here.
[1:09:17] Listen. Listen to this. A couple things
[1:09:18] here in questions and answers. He says,
[1:09:21] "Dear brother Brandon, my wife and I
[1:09:23] were separated and she's suing me for
[1:09:25] divorce. She's not a Christian and I
[1:09:27] believe the message and I want her to be
[1:09:29] saved." He said, "Isn't that nice?
[1:09:31] That's a real Christian spirit. Want I
[1:09:34] want her to be saved and believe. What
[1:09:36] must I do? We also have two
[1:09:38] boys." He said, "Now, let me tell you,
[1:09:41] if she's going to sue you for divorce,
[1:09:42] that's Satan. Shouldn't do that. If
[1:09:44] you're a Christian, does nothing in the
[1:09:45] world to hinder that woman, then that's
[1:09:46] Satan doing that. He's only trying to
[1:09:49] tear you
[1:09:50] up. But if she is one of God's elected,
[1:09:54] she will come to
[1:09:56] him. If she's not, she's not worth
[1:10:00] worrying
[1:10:02] about. Hello,
[1:10:05] somebody. I know that's cutting, but
[1:10:07] that's just the way it is. If she's not,
[1:10:09] it's not worth worry. She not worth
[1:10:11] worrying about. Then if you're worried,
[1:10:13] but the worry what it does, it'll break
[1:10:15] your health down. And that's what Satan
[1:10:18] wants to do to you. He's working. And
[1:10:21] then you you may not be hopefully
[1:10:23] nobody's going through a divorce
[1:10:24] tonight, but there might be something
[1:10:26] else that that he's he's put upon your
[1:10:29] life to try to get to you. And he's what
[1:10:31] he's doing. He's trying to bring that
[1:10:33] worry. And he's trying to bring it to
[1:10:36] break you down. That's what Satan wants
[1:10:38] to do. He's working, I know, at you. So
[1:10:40] you just commit that whole thing to God
[1:10:43] and go right on serving God just as
[1:10:45] happy as you can be and God will take
[1:10:48] care of the rest of it.
[1:10:51] All that the father has given me will
[1:10:53] come.
[1:10:58] Get down on your knees. I'll pray with
[1:11:00] you or anything. I'll pray over the
[1:11:01] matter. Just say, "Lord God, I love her.
[1:11:03] She's a mother of my children, but I
[1:11:05] commit the whole thing to you, Lord. I
[1:11:08] want them saved. You know I do. But I
[1:11:10] can't go no further. She's given me a
[1:11:12] divorce anyhow. I haven't done nothing.
[1:11:14] If I have, reveal it to me. I'll go make
[1:11:16] it right. I'll do anything. But then
[1:11:18] commit it to the Lord and just let it
[1:11:20] alone. Let it alone. Go right on living
[1:11:24] just the same as nothing has ever
[1:11:26] happened. And God will take care of the
[1:11:29] rest. And you pray and commit your
[1:11:31] children to God and hold on to God
[1:11:33] believing they are saved.
[1:11:46] made another statement in questions
[1:11:47] answers is ask him will will all of the
[1:11:50] believing children of of of Holy Ghost
[1:11:54] paraphrasing but of Holy Ghost filled
[1:11:56] parents be saved or will all the
[1:11:58] children of Holy Ghost filled or
[1:11:59] believing parents be saved? He says no.
[1:12:06] He said, 'But you pray and you commit
[1:12:09] your children to God and you hold on to
[1:12:12] God believing they will be saved.
[1:12:16] He said because God, he goes through he
[1:12:17] said God doesn't he he talks about where
[1:12:19] he got it from David Duplicuses I think
[1:12:21] he said God doesn't have grandchildren.
[1:12:24] So just because a child's born in a
[1:12:26] certain house does not give them a right
[1:12:28] amen to go to go to go to in the
[1:12:30] rapture. What gives you a right to go in
[1:12:32] the rapture is a token.
[1:12:35] And that token is not given by natural
[1:12:37] birth. It's given by spiritual birth.
[1:12:39] And this is what he says. But he said
[1:12:40] but you pray and you commit your
[1:12:43] children to God and hold on to God.
[1:12:44] believing that they will be saved. And
[1:12:47] he goes through his own experience with
[1:12:48] his daughter
[1:12:50] Rebecca just just he said I just went
[1:12:52] through it. I you just committed to God.
[1:12:55] So when she got to be a little
[1:12:57] teeny
[1:12:58] teenager, bunch of
[1:13:02] teenies and she was going on going with
[1:13:05] some girls when she first went out there
[1:13:07] going run over some girl's house taking
[1:13:09] music lessons and one day this girl was
[1:13:12] sitting I come by and here this girl was
[1:13:14] sitting in talking about his home
[1:13:15] sitting in the piano playing rock and
[1:13:17] roll. Well I thought that's just enough
[1:13:19] for me. I I told I told her stay away
[1:13:22] from over there. She said, 'Well, that's
[1:13:24] it's the only place I got to go to take
[1:13:26] music. So, you know how teenies
[1:13:29] get. I said, 'Every ch kid has to go
[1:13:32] through that. Practically everyone goes
[1:13:34] to that age. You did and I did.
[1:13:38] And we got our we got but but we got to
[1:13:40] think their thoughts. And then a few
[1:13:42] days after her mother got after
[1:13:44] something, she sassed her and that and
[1:13:46] not that's not Rebecca at all. Took off,
[1:13:48] slammed the door, almost knocked the
[1:13:50] things on the wall, went to school. I
[1:13:52] ought to have seemly taken my belt off
[1:13:54] and follow hered out in the yard and
[1:13:55] brought back brought her back with warps
[1:13:57] around her. But I thought, wait a
[1:13:58] minute, I got to think 18year-old
[1:14:03] thoughts. She and I and I come back in.
[1:14:06] I said, "Mother," and you know me, she
[1:14:08] started crying. I said, "I know you
[1:14:09] don't you've done all you can do and
[1:14:11] I've done all I can do. It's out of our
[1:14:13] hands. We have to take the next
[1:14:17] step." Now, Becky never did do that to
[1:14:19] me. See, but when her mother said
[1:14:21] something about it, she slammed the door
[1:14:23] and said, "You expect me to sit here and
[1:14:24] be a wallflower all my life and blam
[1:14:26] me?" She slammed the door and went out.
[1:14:28] That was the devil.
[1:14:31] But I said, "Me to take your hands off."
[1:14:33] She said, "Me? That's my kid." I said,
[1:14:35] "Isn't it mine, too?" I said, "If she
[1:14:37] was dying this morning, you would have
[1:14:39] to commit her to God for her eternal
[1:14:40] destination. So, why can't we commit her
[1:14:42] to God now for her earthly journey?"
[1:14:45] Amen. She said, "Well, that's my kid." I
[1:14:48] said, "It's mine,
[1:14:50] too." Hello. Ain't just your home. I
[1:14:53] have a a little
[1:14:56] tiff. I said, "Now, can can you take
[1:14:58] your hands?" And she said, "Me not say
[1:15:00] nothing to her?" I said, "I never said
[1:15:03] that. You We'll quit scolding her and
[1:15:05] just advise her. She needs a buddy, and
[1:15:07] you're the one to be her buddy. You and
[1:15:09] I, we are her parents. These kids today
[1:15:12] needs a buddy."
[1:15:15] Amen. So, we got down on our knees and
[1:15:17] committed to God. I said, "I I know
[1:15:19] she's 18 years old, being a few days and
[1:15:21] and a girl that age would think about
[1:15:23] boyfriends and we've kept her in." I
[1:15:25] said, "I never wanted to see her get
[1:15:26] married. I wanted to put her in the
[1:15:28] office here to do work. I want to see
[1:15:29] her, but at first I want to see her
[1:15:30] filled with the spirit and live like
[1:15:33] that. We all wanted that." And she said,
[1:15:35] "Well, we can't do that. She just won't
[1:15:37] listen." I said, "Wait a minute. We've
[1:15:39] raised her all we can. Now, it's time to
[1:15:42] put her in the hands of God and commit
[1:15:44] her
[1:15:47] So when and I said when she does
[1:15:49] something like that, you say, "Becky,
[1:15:51] darling, mother don't want you to do
[1:15:53] that, but I'm your pal and I'm your
[1:15:56] friend and I'm going to stick by you no
[1:15:58] matter
[1:16:00] what." Quite a committal because our
[1:16:04] first reaction is to strike back.
[1:16:07] Come on, somebody. But I think it's good
[1:16:10] to take a prophet's advice, and I don't
[1:16:12] know why God put this in my notes, but
[1:16:13] he did. So here we are.
[1:16:15] Amen. But we we our first reaction when
[1:16:18] we go through anything not just with our
[1:16:19] kids is to strike
[1:16:22] back to say something to do something
[1:16:26] and but if we don't then we start
[1:16:28] carrying this burden you know we think
[1:16:29] well that's the way I got to release
[1:16:31] myself I got to just got to say no you
[1:16:32] don't just have to say something you can
[1:16:35] say something say the word of God
[1:16:37] but not our own thinking not our own
[1:16:39] thoughts not not how we you know I
[1:16:42] believe it's a good thing to live by uh
[1:16:44] is to treat others how we want to be
[1:16:46] treated.
[1:16:49] Hello.
[1:16:54] Lord, I didn't mean to get here, but
[1:16:55] we're here.
[1:16:58] Doesn't matter if you're the boss or the
[1:17:01] employee. Well, I'm the boss. I can do
[1:17:04] and say how I want. Are you doing it
[1:17:05] according how Jesus would do it? Are you
[1:17:08] talking how Jesus would talk?
[1:17:11] Are you treating how Jesus would treat?
[1:17:14] Come on, somebody. And then if you're
[1:17:16] the other side, are you responding how
[1:17:18] God would respond?
[1:17:21] This is what he's trying to teach his
[1:17:23] wife. Listen, it ain't the time to hit
[1:17:24] back. It's the time to say, "Hey, I'm
[1:17:27] your friend. I'm here for you anytime
[1:17:29] you need me." Put your arms around
[1:17:34] them. Hallelujah. Said it before, y'all
[1:17:37] voted me as assistant pastor. So, here
[1:17:39] we
[1:17:44] are. I just be honest. There comes a
[1:17:46] time that weapons don't work no more.
[1:17:50] You can beat them till they're 18, 20
[1:17:52] years old, and they ain't going to do
[1:17:53] nothing but hate you more. But if you
[1:17:55] can show them the love of Jesus Christ,
[1:18:00] I I believe in correction. I I believe
[1:18:02] in the rod. I I believe to a certain
[1:18:05] place, but God grant us wisdom to know
[1:18:08] when it's time to just commit them to
[1:18:10] God. I've done all the teaching I can
[1:18:12] do. Now it's up to him. Yes.
[1:18:16] He says, see, listen here. He
[1:18:19] says she's go she's going to get but we
[1:18:22] know let her know that you love her.
[1:18:23] She's going to get somebody that'll love
[1:18:26] her. It might be the wrong woman. It
[1:18:28] might be the wrong person if you don't
[1:18:30] love her. I said, 'We, you be the woman
[1:18:32] that does the loving.' I said, 'Honey,
[1:18:34] that sounds kind of crude, but people
[1:18:35] come everywhere and set from personal
[1:18:37] interviews and things. I'm so common.
[1:18:39] We're so common to one another because
[1:18:40] we're husband and wife, but we never but
[1:18:42] we never let that happen. You must
[1:18:44] remember this is in the name of the
[1:18:46] Lord.
[1:18:48] She said, "All right." We got down and
[1:18:50] committed it to God. Said we take our
[1:18:52] hands off of it. That afternoon, she
[1:18:55] came in. She said, "Well, I guess you're
[1:18:56] still saying I can't go over
[1:18:58] there." Ma said, "No." I never said
[1:19:01] nothing about that. Said, "You know,
[1:19:03] mother doesn't want you to do it. You
[1:19:05] know that it like to killed your daddy
[1:19:07] when he heard you up there playing that
[1:19:08] boogie woogie music." Ever what it was
[1:19:11] with that girl. Said, "Now, he didn't
[1:19:13] want you to do that and we don't want
[1:19:15] you to do that, Becky, but we've
[1:19:17] committed you to the Lord and I want you
[1:19:19] to know I love you and whatever you do,
[1:19:22] I'll still love you."
[1:19:26] She hollered, "I'm going anyhow.
[1:19:31] said, ' Okay,
[1:19:33] dear. All right, I'll have supper when
[1:19:35] you get back. But she never did
[1:19:39] go. She never went since. Not long after
[1:19:42] that, she met George. George is a
[1:19:44] Christian. That settled it. Then she was
[1:19:46] telling trying to tell Mrs. Woods about
[1:19:47] it the other day. Said, "Oh, I got awful
[1:19:49] wild." Said, "Daddy, mother just
[1:19:51] committed me to the Lord. Awful wild." I
[1:19:54] said, "But that was wild to us and we
[1:19:55] don't want any wilder than that.
[1:20:00] But let it go like
[1:20:03] that. Commit it to God. He said, "What
[1:20:05] if a farmer went and planted a great big
[1:20:07] field of wheat and every morning he got
[1:20:09] out there and dug it all up to see if it
[1:20:11] sprouted? As long as it keeps digging up
[1:20:13] the seed, it'll never grow. Every time
[1:20:16] you dig it up, it delays it another
[1:20:20] day. Every time you look at your
[1:20:22] symptoms, it delays you another day in
[1:20:25] your healing."
[1:20:27] That's what he said. The farmer just
[1:20:29] commits the seed to the ground. He gets
[1:20:31] the best seed he can find and he puts it
[1:20:33] in the ground because he made a
[1:20:35] decision. He wants a crop. He goes and
[1:20:36] gets the best seed. He He wouldn't have
[1:20:39] very much faith in a crop that might be
[1:20:40] mixed up with gyms wheat or white top or
[1:20:42] daisy so forth. He wouldn't find much
[1:20:44] faith to kind of seed. But he got the
[1:20:46] best seed that he could buy, germatized
[1:20:48] seed, and he lays in the ground. He
[1:20:51] commits it and he don't look at it
[1:20:53] anymore.
[1:20:55] That's up to God to take care of the
[1:20:57] rest of it. And the best seed I know of
[1:20:59] is the word of God
[1:21:03] because it's eternal. You commit it to
[1:21:05] your heart, not to your head, to your
[1:21:08] heart and faith. Well, you keep digging
[1:21:10] around. So, well, the doctor said so and
[1:21:12] so. Say, listen, doctors will keep you
[1:21:15] upside down and
[1:21:17] backwards. I just witnessed it the other
[1:21:19] day. I I hope it's okay. But brother
[1:21:21] Ron, you know, we just had heard he had
[1:21:24] heard from three or four doctors that
[1:21:25] his kidneys were
[1:21:28] cancer-free. And he he comes down to the
[1:21:31] last doctor and she said,
[1:21:32] "Well, we ain't got such and such tests
[1:21:35] yet back." So, I wouldn't quite say that
[1:21:42] yet. If that's what he was standing on,
[1:21:44] he's flipped upside
[1:21:46] down. But that's not what he was
[1:21:48] standing on. He said, "I'm standing on
[1:21:50] the word of God."
[1:21:52] It doesn't matter five doctors, one
[1:21:54] doctors, 10 doctors, whatever doctors
[1:21:56] say. It does not matter. It matters what
[1:21:58] God says. Amen. That's where you have to
[1:22:01] stand on. He said, "If I ask tonight of
[1:22:03] cancer cases and blindness and lame and
[1:22:04] halt and all kinds of diseases by tens
[1:22:06] of thousands healed, it worked. If
[1:22:08] you'll put it in the right place, but if
[1:22:10] you lay it in the shelf, it'll never do
[1:22:12] no good." Did not Jesus say, "Unless a
[1:22:14] corner of wheat fall into the earth and
[1:22:16] die." See, you got to let it die. Just
[1:22:19] commit it to your heart and forget about
[1:22:22] it.
[1:22:24] Your
[1:22:25] decision, that decision, God will take
[1:22:29] the rest of
[1:22:30] it. This is what he said in Psalms 37
[1:22:34] and verse three, and I'll read out of a
[1:22:35] different translation. Trust or lean on,
[1:22:39] rely on, be confident in the Lord and do
[1:22:43] good. So shall you dwell in the land and
[1:22:46] feed surely on his faithfulness and
[1:22:48] truly you shall be fed. Delight yourself
[1:22:51] also in the Lord and he will give you
[1:22:52] the desires and the secret petitions of
[1:22:55] your heart. Commit your way to the Lord
[1:22:59] or roll and repose each care of your
[1:23:02] load on him. Trust, lean on, rely on, be
[1:23:06] confident also in him and he will bring
[1:23:09] it to pass. Amen.
[1:23:13] The way we understand commit again is to
[1:23:16] roll yourself upon like a burden is
[1:23:19] rolled onto something else to be carried
[1:23:21] away completely relieving you of the
[1:23:24] burden and the weight of
[1:23:28] it. You know, we can think about this
[1:23:30] burden we roll on the onto God in
[1:23:32] different a couple different ways. your
[1:23:33] way, your choices, your actions, your
[1:23:37] plans, what happened to you, what's
[1:23:40] going on in your life, your direction
[1:23:42] you take or the burden yourself, your
[1:23:45] health, your needs, your wishes, your
[1:23:48] thoughts, your emotions, your heart, or
[1:23:51] your
[1:23:52] spirit. Get
[1:23:54] burdened. People get crushed under these
[1:23:56] burdens because they're not trusting in
[1:23:59] God.
[1:24:03] Matthew 11 and verse 28 says, "Come unto
[1:24:06] me all ye that labor and heavy laden and
[1:24:10] I will give you
[1:24:12] rest." I will give you rest. In other
[1:24:14] words, are you weary of carrying a heavy
[1:24:17] burden. Then come to me and I will
[1:24:20] refresh your life for I am your oasis.
[1:24:26] Hallelujah. If you're weary and gloomy
[1:24:27] and feel like everything's against you,
[1:24:29] come unto
[1:24:31] me ye that are burdened with a heavy
[1:24:35] burden and I will refresh you. I will
[1:24:40] give you life because I am your
[1:24:45] oasis. You'll never find rest in
[1:24:49] worry. You'll never find it in fretting
[1:24:52] and anxiety or fears. You'll never find
[1:24:55] it in trying to figure out because the
[1:24:57] devil will send you down a thousand
[1:24:59] different
[1:25:00] directions. The only real true rest is
[1:25:04] to come to
[1:25:05] him. Let's bow our hearts
[1:25:07] tonight. Ask the musicians to come.
[1:25:22] Maybe you've been under a heavy
[1:25:26] burden, heavy
[1:25:29] weights,
[1:25:32] thoughts, thoughts that just come one
[1:25:34] right after
[1:25:36] another. How's this going to be? How's
[1:25:39] that going to be? What's this going to
[1:25:41] do? What's that going to do? How's this
[1:25:43] going to work out? I
[1:25:47] Come unto
[1:25:48] him. Come to his
[1:25:52] word. Come to his
[1:26:06] word. Maybe you've been like somebody
[1:26:08] just walking uphill with a pile of
[1:26:12] logs.
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:17] Remember brother Brown telling about
[1:26:19] Paul Rder who wrote only
[1:26:22] believe got sick deathly sick was
[1:26:26] dying as he was in that state he had
[1:26:29] this dream or vision or something of
[1:26:32] being
[1:26:34] a a
[1:26:37] man logging lumber and logging trees and
[1:26:40] he cut down this big old tree and he is
[1:26:43] wrestling with it, trying to get it,
[1:26:46] trying to get it to camp, trying to pick
[1:26:49] it up, and he's straining with all that
[1:26:51] he had. And he fall down and pick it
[1:26:53] back
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:55] up. All of a sudden, he hears a voice
[1:26:58] says,
[1:26:59] "Paul, there's a river right down there
[1:27:02] that goes to camp. Why don't you just
[1:27:04] roll it off in that river and just get
[1:27:06] on and ride?"
[1:27:12] came to himself screaming, "I'm riding
[1:27:14] on it. I'm riding on it. I'm riding on
[1:27:17] it." What does that try to tell you
[1:27:19] tonight? I'm trying to tell you the
[1:27:21] promises of God were not meant to be a
[1:27:25] burden. They were meant to be a vehicle
[1:27:27] to take you to where you need to
[1:27:32] be. You don't have to get burdened over
[1:27:36] it. Rest on it.
[1:27:41] rest on
[1:27:45] it. Ride on the promises of God. That's
[1:27:47] what they were meant. Let it be a
[1:27:49] vehicle that takes you and it moves you
[1:27:52] into other places. Not something that
[1:27:54] crushes you or you worry about how is
[1:27:56] this how in the world is this going to
[1:27:59] I'm just resting on it. He said he's the
[1:28:02] Lord God that heals all my
[1:28:03] diseases. And I'm just laying myself on
[1:28:06] that
[1:28:07] word and I'm going to ride it to my
[1:28:13] healing. I'm just laying myself on that
[1:28:16] promise that says they shall be there
[1:28:18] and their offspring with them. I the
[1:28:20] promises unto me and to my children. I
[1:28:22] I'm going to just believe that's my
[1:28:23] promise and I'm going I'm I can't bring
[1:28:25] it to pass. I can't I can't save my
[1:28:27] children. I can't I can't bring them out
[1:28:29] of the world. Lord, I can't do none of
[1:28:30] that, but I'm just going to rest on
[1:28:34] it. Rest on his
[1:28:37] promises. Rest on his
[1:28:40] word. Rest on what he
[1:28:42] said. He's in control of every
[1:28:46] situation. He's in
[1:28:48] control. He is a faithful
[1:28:53] creator. He's the faithful creator.
[1:28:59] Hallelujah.
[1:29:02] Father Lord, sometimes we get so
[1:29:04] burdened down with things
[1:29:06] and worries and wonderings how in the
[1:29:09] world is this going to work or how is
[1:29:10] that going to
[1:29:12] be? How Lord, if we could just roll it
[1:29:16] off of our arms and put it onto you,
[1:29:19] cast your cares upon the Lord for he
[1:29:23] cares. God, I'm so thankful you care
[1:29:25] tonight, Lord. I'm so thankful you care
[1:29:28] for
[1:29:30] us. There may be some that came in here
[1:29:32] weary and gloomy and burdened about
[1:29:35] things. How's this going to work out,
[1:29:36] brother T? I don't
[1:29:38] know. I just know he said it. And what
[1:29:42] he said he's going to do.
[1:29:46] Oh God, we just ask Lord that we could
[1:29:48] come back to that place of
[1:29:50] rest, resting upon your
[1:29:53] promises, resting upon the word of God,
[1:29:56] resting upon the power of
[1:30:01] God. It's what that's what Rebecca did.
[1:30:04] She climbed up on that camel and she
[1:30:08] rested. She waited to meet her Isaac.
[1:30:13] Oh God, may we climb up into the
[1:30:15] heavenlies where we're ordained to be
[1:30:17] and rest in the promises of
[1:30:20] God. We ask it in Jesus
[1:30:24] name. Lord granted father I
