and in these times and know that you're here with us ask god to just be with us this evening lord touch us father by your word we pray in jesus name amen amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen you can be turned into mark chapter 10. amen mark chapter 10 verse 46. it is very wonderful to have my wife sister ruth here tonight amen through many dangerous toils and snares we've come but amazing grace has brought us safe this far amen and you know you know how the world is they tend to commercialize everything you've got father's day and mother's day and this day and that day but understand that this is pastor's appreciation month i don't know why we have to have a month to appreciate a pastor but i really do appreciate our pastor all that god has done through his ministry for our lives amen amen but if it's just to set aside a time to say thank you i want to say thank you amen god bless you tonight mark chapter 10 and verse 46 and also you can turn to second corinthians 10. it says and they came to jericho as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy upon me and many charged him that he would hold his peace but he cried a more the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me what would you do if he was blind amen and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man said unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus and jesus answered and said unto him without what with thou should that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight and jesus said unto him go thy way that faith has made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way ii corinthians 10 and verse 3 it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ we let you be seated also would just like to read first corinthians 2 16 says for who hath known the mind of the lord that we may instruct him but we have the mind of christ now we know that we can only have his mind by being born amen into the family of god amen to take on his dna and to take on his thoughts to take on his thinking it only comes by the holy ghost taking preeminence over our lives now i i just seen this quote that was actually up on the uh overhead as as was watching it play through i just want to read it again because i thought it was very wonderful even with what we're speaking tonight now i would just like to continue on casting down imaginations it says the first thing i want went to the to a person and found their birthplace and what sign they were born under and could tell what their birth was which way it set in their natural nature sets them in a certain line now he's saying your natural birth what sign you're born under sets you in a certain line but when they are reborn again they're over in another nature amen when you find into this nature the first nature inside conscience inside of reason all those things but once you move into the that's a natural birth but once you move into the other amen there's something different and and he goes on he says he said the inside you know would say oh i just know when you hear the word of god it says oh i just know your mind begins to to come from the inside as your heart begins to line up to the word it says oh i just know it lines up with the scripture and said they'll start to do it but the first thing you know satan on this outside will show all kinds of defects in it he'll show every kind of loophole in it he'll show all kinds of things and then they'll begin to say well i guess and they begin to reason what are they doing they're listening to satan he said but you've got to take that inside something what's on the inside of you the scriptural and don't let satan stand anywhere hallelujah that's his duty to stand there and pound at you like that but don't you listen to him hallelujah that goes for in church or wherever you're at amen satan comes at you every day of your life in your dreams at night all kinds of to any time that he can find a little place to come into amen to get into your thoughts into your thinking you know i mean i i i woke up in the morning i mean he's ever had a dream that seemed so real and you thought man did i really do that and then satan comes and he tries to anoint dreams he tries to come into your conscience your subconscious to do everything he can to distract you or to or or to show you things or little flaws or little of defects in it but there's no defect in the word of god there's no defect in the spirit of god there's no defect in the life of god amen what is it satan is just trying to find a place to stand and he will stand there as long as you allow him to stand there he'll stand in your thoughts as long as you allow him to stand in your thoughts he'll he'll stand in your reasoning as long as you allow him to stand in your reasoning he'll stand and he'll stand wherever he can find a place wherever whatever little crack whatever every little crevice he'll try to find that place to pound at you to try to get you off of the path amen but what is it when those things come you have to cast them down you have to push them aside you have to say no that might have been the old man but that's not the new man i might have been with my brother timothy or timothy pruitt a long time ago but that's not timothy pruitt today that might be this that might have been me back in that day and what i used to do and how i used to think and how i used to act or how i used to believe or what i used to do but that's not me no more because i can point to a place where my life changed i can point to a place where i step from the natural into the supernatural i can point to a place where the holy ghost came and took preeminence upon our lives to where we don't think like we used to think thank god we don't think like the world thinks today amen we don't even think how the world used to think 30 years ago or 40 years ago we we don't think how the world thinks we think how christ thinks the mind of christ so it's very important no matter where you're at to get your mind upon the lord amen to get your mind upon his doings and his word and his thinking amen you know here's another one here as we go into this he says i think it's a great thing as we could look at a christian life and there had to be a bridge to span the way for the human race to leave this world somewhere someday and there was no one could do it no angel no archangel no seraphim no cherubim nothing could do it but god himself came down in the form of a man to bridge away to make a way for amen from the grave to glory and it sure showed the reflection every listen there's every nerve in his body every thought in his mind every power that was in him was tested by the enemy amen well you know how your nerves get every nerve in his body every thought in his mind every power that was in him was tested by the enemy let me let you in on something it's the same enemy you're facing tonight and if he would test our savior and our lord like that how dare we think that we're going to get by without being tested devil the devil's going to come time after time thought after thought reasoning after reasoning trying to get us to doubt who we are why we're here amen why why why we're here in the first place but he stood the test hallelujah and when he stood the test death itself everything under it he conquered it hallelujah so therefore amen that enemies against you is a conquered enemy hallelujah we're in the last days it's the last hours of days and we're seeing him now in his word and all of his word is being made manifest right here before us we're seeing amen prophecies that laid for thousands of generations are being fulfilled very rapidly right here before us amen as he would say as it were in the days of sodom or as it was in the in the days of noah we're seeing it fulfilled right here before us very quickly and very rapidly but he says old church of the living god amen get to your feet amen here there's a place that you can stand we did talk we've been talking about the place the devil can stand but there's a place here to stand and that's on the word of god get to your feet believe in him with all that's in you hold to that little wheel in the middle of the wheel let it stabilize every move let it stabilize every moses motive let it stabilize every motion let it stabilize every thought hallelujah there is something here that can stabilize your thinking there's something here that can stabilize your thoughts he said what is it may every motive every move every thought be controlled by this tower that's on the inside of you hallelujah but reading about blind bartimaeus could you imagine i i i try to today you know just somehow times lord knows i don't ever want to be go through what a blind person goes through there's a lot of other things i would pick before being blind but could you imagine the mind battles of a blind person you can see what's ahead of you you can see around you you can walk and you can be walking and you can you can hit this and he's oh that's just a speaker but i mean what what is a blind what's in the imagination of a blind person and here this man no doubt set day after day after day with with reasonings and imaginations and and and there's problems that were real problems greater problems than any of us probably has ever faced because i don't know as far as i know ain't nobody in here ever been blind but i mean here here i know this man had all kinds of things and and he's sitting there and dwelling upon them and thinking about them and wondering brother branham would go dramatize in many different places he said wondering how he's going to get his next meal and wondering how he's going to provide for his family he said history would tell us he was a married man but he was had to be he had to beg and he had a family to provide for and could you imagine the the emotional drain every day this man went through and the problems that he had to deal with that we don't ever have to deal with and we think we got a bad day the problems of just going from point a to point b the problems from just getting up out of a pew and going out there to the restroom or going to get a drink of water amen your great problems and his mind and the battles that he had to go through and he said i could see old blind bartimaeus sitting there this he said just just imagine we can see him and can catch what he was thinking about he said i imagine he was sitting there shivering winds were blowing his ragged sleeves hanging down if he could be operated on him for his blindness he wouldn't have the money to do it anyhow he had no hopes perhaps he couldn't do nothing for him if they if he did have the money here he sat there shivering in his thoughts and i'd imagine him being a believer he would think you know think back you know what i'm sitting right here by the wall right out about a hundred year yards from him was the very same highway that the great warrior joshua would march down through amen and move toward the gates and right out there beyond that was where the captain the host of the lord stood with his sword drawn and the same jericho where this blind man said i can imagine bartimaeus saying oh if i could only been living then if i could only bend there then i would be healed this is his thinking this is mine if i could be there if i could be in a different church service or if i could have been at that place i know how to receive what's wrong with tonight amen if i could have just been there when jehovah was really doing the miraculous but i mean the priest is telling me those days are gone now and and the hundreds of years ago he used to do them but he don't do them no more and then it was the same road that elijah and elijah would walk down with their arms around each other to the jordan where they struck the water and then the water parted and and they walked across on dry land and i can my imagine blind bartimaeus thinking oh if i could only lived in the day when the great mighty prophet walked down that aisle if i could just been in brother branham's meetings if i could have just been there then or in some great atmosphere then i could receive my healing these were the thoughts in this man's mind if i could have been there the prophet of god would have had mercy on me and would have given me back my sight but now the priests are saying the days of miracles are passing we don't have those kind of services no more and and it seems like jehovah's lost all of his strength this was his thinking but this was the day his thinking was about to be changed amen from a historical god of what he could have had and what could have been to a god of right now that'll meet my needs right now and this is where you get into battle when you come to the house of god or it might be another service and the devil's always trying to pound that into you next service next service next service or if i could have been back there or if we could just have another service like that what about this time amen this is the same building cancer was healed in this is the same building that alopecia would be wiped away this is the same building amen god would come down and heal a woman of a brain bleed this is the same place is not the place even greater than that then we serve the same god and he's not a god of history he's a god of today but we've got to change our thinking to say god you're right here right now even now to meet my need hallelujah i can imagine him saying these things and thinking on this maybe jehovah's lost all of his strength ain't that what the devil wants to make you think today god just you know he done some great things back in the 50s and 40s and 60s but where's he at today he's lost his strength you know he's not lost his strength you need to change your thinking amen he's really he's you know but he's he's still jehovah god he still has the same power he still has the same compassion he always has and he always will be they had them at that day who denied his power denied his miracles denied his signs and we got them today we got them that will preach you right into a tribulation preaching message material preach you right into a tribulation amen we got them in those days here but they still you know have those that are you know well we got to go through this and we got to do that and we got to be this and we got to go we got to go through trials and our tribulations we we how dare you think you're going to get by on a flower to bed who said we are but he said we also got them in those days who still believed we got them today that believes hello somebody and if there'll be a tomorrow they'll still be believing and they'll still be receiving amen jesus said i'm with you till the end of the world i'll be with you i'll walk by your side as a companion a fellow citizen i'll walk with you i'll guide you on the passage of go if you just let me oh he said i love that i'll be with you to the end of the world till it's all over i will be there then he thought oh if i could only lived in the days when miracles were real here i'm beyond the doctor's reach i'm a poor beggar i have a family at home maybe today i'll never even get a coin from my begging my family my children to go hungry my wife she's already she's already given all she can to the children i have no other way of making a living if i could only see if i could i could give me a job over somewhere but i can't see but as he sits there god begins to deal with his heart to prepare him for his healing because if his thinking didn't change he would have never received his healing come on now it'll pass right by him and been on the cross hanging there amen but here comes his opportunity but god always gives a person an opportunity god always gives a time amen a place or somebody can come to to get their thinking changed amen he said he began to deal with his heart and prepare him for something oh hallelujah have you ever had those times you're driving to church and all of a sudden your thinking changes and you're beginning to realize something's about to take place tonight what is it god is changing some thinking and thoughts and saying hey we ain't got to wait for another service tonight we can have that kind of night tonight we can have the supernatural among us tonight we can have jesus christ walk in the building and raise the dead make the ones in the wheelchair get out tonight we can have the ones amen there's having breathing problems all of a sudden a deep breath come to them tonight we can have jesus come and touch the blind among us hallelujah and open our eyes to realize what day we're living in [Music] he said it's just around the corner but he said it's when you begin to think about divine healing how many come to church tonight thinking about divine healing oh come on now how many come to church thinking about god amen amen he said what is it you have to get your thinking on christ about christ keep him on your mind if there be any praise if there be any virtue if there be any good thing think on these things if any thought comes by well maybe yeah maybe somehow kick it out get your mind right back think on things that's positive hello somebody he said never let a negative thought come through don't think sitting there in a wheelchair you're hopeless or helpless come on now i don't even see anybody here tonight in a wheelchair so we're not even in that place or in barter blind bartimaeus place those so let me tell you this right now there's nobody in this building that's hopeless or helpless hallelujah because at any moment he could fall in our prayer in our midst and change everything so you're not hopeless you're not helpless that's the devil lying to you don't let that negative thought come and get an anchor sometimes you can't help it from coming into your mind but don't let it stop there you know i'm amazed by people that have severe handicaps and you can see they have a strong mind because they don't let their handicaps get to them i mean you see people that don't i was just actually today was watching this video on a farmer and he's doing all of his row cropping and things it was just interesting watching him how he operated this crazy high dollar equipment so as i said he's got a podcast and stuff so i just happened to see it and watching it and he began to say he said you know he said i i i i got to give a shout out to so and so don't remember his name he said because he's a man who farms he said he runs tractors he does all kinds of things plants corn grows corn i don't remember all the stuff he does with no arms he said so i don't have any problems today well if you get your thinking right tonight you realize i don't have any problems because god's already took care of it [Music] hallelujah amen what happens though he said a bird can come over and start flying over your place but you don't have to let him make a nest you get a double barrel shotgun and shoot him out of his roosting spot it's time some of you break out your weapon tonight i mean the devil's been taking place and he's got a big old nest you ever seen a barn swallow a barn swallow make the nastiest mess you've ever seen on the side of your house it'll bring mud and mud and mud and cakes and mud and and all of a sudden mud's going down your house and underneath there's nothing but bird mess everywhere that's what the devil's got in some of your people's brains amen we've got people so cobwebbed up to where they can't believe in divine healing they can't believe it and the holy ghost is for them they can't believe that god's the same yesterday today and forever they can't believe why because they've allowed their thinking to be changed amen they can't believe in altar calls no more prayer lines are out why because they got a lot of cobwebs up there a lot of birdness has taken place and they've aligned all kinds of things to support their thinking come too late to tell me a prayer line don't work a couple wednesday nights ago we had a preaching prayer line some people might think that was out of order but apparently god didn't think so because all i know a woman with a brain bleed it has changed her to where she's now moving forward and got some fight in her living life hallelujah all i know is it took a little boy that had thyroid issues and now the doctors for the first time in three years says that his levels are going back to normal and they're going to cut it and cut his medicine in half expect them to be off of it the next few little bits come on people this is god moving on to sage so how dare you come and tell somebody prayer lines don't work no more when god wants to hold a prayer line it'll shut the critic's mouth hallelujah you can't help them from coming by but you don't have to let them roost them well what i got got a double belt shotgun old new testament it's got enough ammunition there to blow the devil and everything he's got hallelujah we keep saying the devil ain't got enough he don't have enough but god's got enough amen he's got a bullet for every enemy he's got enough to drive every devil he's going to back into the lake of fire to their destruction forever amen god's got enough but blind bartimaeus sitting there with all this passing through his mind passing through his mind if i could only bend whether great prophets were if i if i could just have them stop for a moment and talk i believe jehovah would give me my sight but all of a sudden he heard a noise all of a sudden you know you know it's amazing people scare the noise but brother branham over and over and over said when jesus comes there's always noise and it said the noise started taking place people began to scream and shout so i'm waiting all screaming praises and shouting some were screaming away with him he's like he's a crazy man he's bials above but there was others screaming hosanna hosanna blessed be the rock hallelujah there were things taking place and all of a sudden blimey martinez said who is that who's coming to the place who's coming down the street and he said maybe it was some little nice woman sitting by him and said hey that's jesus from nazareth he's the one who raised the dead he's the one who gave the leper back his pure skin he's the one who'd done this and he began to realize hey this ain't a god of history no more this is the god of right now hallelujah and he began to scream out jesus thou son of david have mercy upon me amen just a few moments ago he was thinking god was a god of history but all of a sudden he's screaming out jesus have mercy on me hallelujah is there anyone here tonight and say god change my thinking change my thoughts to when i come into a service i'm screaming out jesus have mercy on me touch my heart touch my life help my family god why is it sometimes we sit around like we don't have any needs we go through service after service like we don't have an old needs and let me watch family's falling apart and things are taking place and we don't have nothing in us to realize he's here right now and just a little bit of a move it can change it all an action to cause a reaction i don't ever want to be guilty of sitting in a building letting jesus walk through and meeting every call in his name because i'm so obscured with other doubts and mind battles and things and other that i allowed him to walk right by and i never even mentioned him then we walked out didn't get nothing out of that one well whose fault was it come on now let's just be honest let's hit the road get the rubber on the road tonight i know we want to blame the song leader and blame the musicians and blame this and whose fault is it when we don't get nothing out of the service look in the mirror amen hallelujah let's just smile a while it's like that boy you know you heard the story watched his uncle reach in his pocket when the offering come by and he got a dime throated in it man didn't really like what the preacher said so when he walked out he reached over and got his dime put it back in his pocket and his boy looked at him he said what are you doing he said well i didn't like what the man said so i'm getting my dime back he said hey little boy said hey you know if you put more in you'd have got more out hello somebody think about the woman who watched jesus feet she put all she had in you know about mind battles amen what kind of mind battles that woman was facing and she walked back to the house to go get all the money she had not knowing if he was going to reject her or turn her down or call her a or whatever but she was willing to lay it all on the line [Applause] hallelujah i heard a wonderful message of hold the line but i think we ought to hear it lay it all on the line say god here it is i'm giving it all to you i'm laying myself out before you i want everything to be holy and righteous and if you find anything there i want to go some were screaming away with him confusions away with him others were saying hosanna hosanna but here came along the very captain joshua met hallelujah the very pillar of fire that led to children of israel here he was again and people were screaming while he stood there days of miracles are passed all hopes are gone and here comes the captain of the host of the lord walking by just on time he always arrives just right and here he come by i called of course a blind man he didn't know i could imagine him listening his head turned around somebody began to tell him that there is jesus and something began to rise up he said what happened after after all the things began to change a new hope rose up amen i knew hope rose up here he was beginning to hear the word faith comes by hearing amen somebody told him that's jesus the prophet who's here healing the sick well it must be jesus walking right here amen what could stop him nothing could stop him but a scream jesus his faith stopped jesus in his tracks what can your faith do he says the lord looked at him and said what do you want well you'd think that would be obvious what do you want he said i might receive my sight he says thy faith healed you he said i can see that as he turns around on up the road oh blind bartimaeus standing there he told me when i was healed and then i can see him looking at his hand and someone trying to say see you still can't see it but he told me went back to the word he told me see you still ain't seen a rapture but he told me see you still ain't seen a body change but he told me see you still ain't received your healing but he told me go back to the word but he told me that i could be saved he told me that i could be healed he told me i could be delivered he told me and right in the middle of all their doubts his eyes come open why because he refused to believe what they were saying and only believe what jesus said he said a man who probably couldn't even sign his own name if his faith could stop jesus of nazareth and a multitude of people crying for his blood with a burden on his heart his eyes toward calvary how much more can your faith stop him tonight and bring him to your individual need but you know it's when you begin to think about god when you keep him on your mind you know we sit in church and we think about everything else but god all right let's just have an honest service tonight how we're going to do how much washing we got to do how much we got to do at the office tomorrow how are we going to do this or how we're going to do that keep your mind off of that and keep it on god the bible says if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things well you know you begin to he said people begin to think well i wonder i wonder if i'll be called in a prayer line i wonder if god will speak don't think that kind of negative thought don't let don't let it go through your mind make every word positive and ever thought positive as the disciples on the road amen to amaze me as cleopas at what was it they began talking about jesus they began thinking about jesus and when they begin talking and thinking about him he steps out of the bushes hallelujah while they were thinking on him while they were meditating on that's the same way jesus does today and we wonder why we ain't seen him sometimes it might be because we ain't thinking about him or talking about it or meditating on him come on now amen he said see in my heart in my mind all day long let me walk with the lord in the light of his word with the heavenly dove let me have fellowship with him all day long but if you have so many other things on your mind it's another quote sometimes we'll come to church thinking about it tomorrow i got to do this the next day i've got to do that and when we come to church we ought to lay aside every thought and everything of the world and enter into fellowship with christ in worship meditating worshiping in our hearts giving songs and praises to him thinking of his goodness and what he means to us worshiping in the spirit singing spiritual songs making melodies in our heart even the bible said if there is there's any afflicted let them sing songs be happy be in meditation always expecting god at any moment to appear to you my goodness that changed a lot of days in our lives wouldn't it if you're always expecting god at any moment to appear to you he would say in another place he said while i'm praying and speaking he said i want every person in here to have this on your mind as soon as prayer begins to go for the sick every one of you is going to get up and walk out of the building well that was two different thoughts right there wouldn't it have this on you might do that on purpose have this on your mind as soon as prayer begins to go for the sick every one of you is going to get up and walk out of the building well man i think we ought to expect that why not amen why not why not me why not now amen why not don't have anything else on your mind keep thinking that i'm going to get up and walk out of here well you can't get anything from god with a negative thought he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him lebron would talk about the slaves and how man was bought as a slave ended up being a king son remember the story talking about mind battles going from being a king son to a slave here he was offered a man bought him took him to his place one day a broker come by and he saw a bunch of slaves working on a certain plantation a hundred more slaves and they were sad their minds were tore up negative thoughts they thought they would never go home again they thought about babies they would never see papa and mama they'd never see a relationship the relations that they would never see they were very downcast as it is so easily to become it's a lot easier to get downcast than it is to get happy especially in the world that we living in there's a lot more in this world to be down about than there is to be happy about as far as the world's concerned because there's no hope in this world there's nothing that you can pull happiness from he said that's what the devil likes to work on you and oppress you you know that's the trick of the devil to oppress but when this christian knows his legal rights when you can quote god's word it says i'll never leave thee or forsake you that takes all the oppression away when you realize he's never left me in my job troubles he's never left me and my problems at home he's never left me amen situations he's never left me hallelujah he's never left me hallelujah mr rachel i feel to tell you this god's never left you you may have lost your husband you may only be going through a terrible time right now seem like but god's never left he knows what's going on he's seen it hallelujah he saw the letters he saw everything he knows all about it and he's never left me amen he's never left you and sure the devil tried to pour on oppression after oppression after oppression but take the word of god my god's never left me my god's still here with me my god still fighting my battles my god's still moving on my behalf my god is still watching me because if he's watching the sparrow and not one little bird can fall without him knowing about it i know he knows his son i know he knows about his daughter can you let me think about it right now the concern that you have for your daughters and your sons when they're out driving they're out doing things they're concerned and the things you're thinking about them god's still thinking about you he tries to pour it on but there's one slave the man didn't have to whip him he had his chest stuck out and his chin up just willing to work do anything a snappy brilliant fella the broker said i'd like to buy that one the guy said he ain't for sale he said why is he the boss he said no he's just a slave maybe you feed him better no he's out in the galley with the rest of them what makes him so much up and at it he said i've always wondered myself till i found out something i found out his father is a king though he's an alien yet he still knows he's the son of a king though he's a slave he still knows i'm a son of a king brother though we be alienated in this world where sin and chaos is we need to stick our chest down and throw up our heads yes you're sons and daughters of a king not a king the king what kind of person are we to be he did that to keep the morale of the rest of them up and he said that's what we got to do who's born again of the holy spirit keep up a good courage hallelujah what kind of people should we be knowing that our heavenly father is the king and only one thing the slave never knew he never knew if he'd be back home again but there's one thing we know we're going home again jesus said i'll come and receive you myself and where i am there you may be also don't let your heart be troubled don't think about anything else keep your mind on these things he said brother that'll make a mockingbird sing in the night amen if i don't make a mockingbird sing in the middle of the night what ought to be to a son or a daughter of god who knows this ain't my home i'm just passing through i got a place i'm going to had a lawyer i am a son of a king i am a daughter of the king [Applause] mary went walking down the street as she walked down the little dirt path for a sidewalk all of a sudden she began to realize there's something around her a real strange feeling he said that's the most wonderful experience he said i trust everybody here has that kind of experience sometime i say yes lord if you haven't this would be a wonderful night to start woo glory to god amen just how do i start brother timothy how do i start just start thinking about him so simple and worship him in your heart and all of a sudden you'll feel the closeness of the holy spirit around you and it gets so anointed to you can't hold it any longer and all of a sudden your hands are shoot up or something to happen you can't stand still when that comes she was thinking not noticing what was around her little lady perhaps with a pair of sandals on their feet walking down a little dusty path but thinking of the lord and his promises of things to come she was thinking and all of a sudden the feeling got so great around her until she raised up her head she just raised up her head and they're standing before her was a light and that of that light steps gabriel the angel the archangel of god he says if you want angels to appear to you listen if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on god and off the things of the world go about your business go to church go to your washing whatever but keep your mind on him all day and all night then god will do something you're drawing close to him you're the world is being shut out just you and him together mercy the appearance of the angel no doubt frightened the little virgin she had been taught in those days that made that days of miracles were passed but she had seen something happen the angel said hell mary hill means to stop he had a message for her and when the angel comes he's got a message when the holy spirit comes amen god's angel is here tonight with the message for every believer keep your mind on him keep thinking about him think about how lovely he is how sweet he is think about his promises if you're sick get that off your mind if you're sick get this on your mind he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace were upon him and with his stripes i was healed keep your mind centered like that and something will start happening all of a sudden there's something drawn out of you and anointed will come and out of the chair you'll go drawn out of the lord and he'll draw nigh to you but it's usually when you've got your mind on him it's reasonably usually at times when you're thinking about him when he appears you know when you're thinking about getting right or doing something right that's when he comes to help you it must have been about that time supernatural started taking place this is one of my favorite quotes and looking to the unseen yes that i think he said i think the holy spirit can lead a man and tell him things and make him act different and make him believe things and receive things that this world could never believe can happen that's the difference the holy spirit i'm a witness he said i was a blind man once myself practically had to be led so i now know what i'm talking about that is the holy spirit he said oh can't you feel that pulsation of the spirit begin to rise on your heart saying jesus christ is in our midst oh can we turn our thoughts to this for a moment jesus christ is in our midst how do you know wherever two or three are gathering my name there i'll be pulsation something begins moving like a heartbeat it's pumping energy into your spirit it's pumping energy into your mind then let the things your eyes just black out and see not the things of the world see the things of god see what god's doing see like noah he just let it all black out all the critics all the naysayers all the people walking away just let it black out don't listen to him don't give a dime of your time to a critic give it all to jesus if noah would have gave a dime a time diamond timer to the critics he had he'd have never built the ark but he kept one nail after another nail board after another board jesus said god said it's going to rain children this is not a dream this is a visitation it's going to rain it's going to rain these little chihuahuas believe the sign not a dime let them go let them go on there might finally be made manifest but there's still a people that's saying no my eyes are on jesus we see where it led them to anyhow oh i'm walking away from a cult and then they walk away from god altogether not a dime of time i don't know why i'm saying that over and over maybe somebody had been trying to listen to quit listening to them let it go it ain't worth it they can't offer you anything better yeah or even as good anything in comparison he says believing what god said he said oh tonight in this and angelus uh temple could so tune our hearts not our literal minds let it go cast down reason but with our hearts could tune into the word of god to see a revival break forth to see the altars full to see the church pact to see a revival spreading through los angeles a fire that cannot be put out our hearts would begin to pulsate under the power of the holy ghost there would be such a prayer meeting over los angeles night if it could happen certainly he said what in the when the church is in tune that's what happened in the upper room when they got an all one mind and one accord who's mine his mind not peter's not any other his mind he said when what if the people here tonight that sick could just begin to think this right here three words god is god well if he's god then cancer has to bow covet has to bow demons of every kind has to flee if god is god amen if he isn't why are we serving him hallelujah but if he's still god he's still a healer if he's still god he's still the deliverer if he's still god he's still the same yesterday today and forever if he's still god his word is still true and i say he's still god and god is god amen and he made a promise he won't break it if god is god he has to keep it and then all of a sudden a pulsation begins to rise in the heart something's going to take place nothing's going to stop this it's a fire as like a building on fire on a windy day it just keeps blowing as the holy spirit fans that fire and it keeps burning until it becomes a reality to you because why god is god apparently the world's thinking don't believe that they don't believe in a god christianity don't really believe in the god that we talk about because apparently their god has no power apparently their god has no power to cleanse them from smoking drinking adulteries every kind of filth in the world they can just come and be a christian but still live like a sinner that's all it is it's just changing a name not a nature we want a nature change but the god that i talk about still has the power the god that i'm speaking about still can raise the dead he can still heal the blind he can still save the lost hallelujah god is god let me read this last one here as we as we bring this down deny your thinking deny your mental conceptions just believe god's word and say it's true and march on with it keep moving you get sicker keep moving after a while you're going to break through every barrier and be free then you'll see him then he'll reveal himself to you that then the son of god who made the promise will be real if a man could ever catch the vision of the invisible god not not just to hope so not just a maybe so not just a god of yesterday oh remember what god did over here and that a god who's present always present there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble he'll still look upward above the things that are happening around him because why he caught a vision of the unseen oh how abraham the reason he believed it because god said it and god said it he was going to look at look at the promise no matter what took place and call it present tense and rest upon it where if you look at with your eyes and you see now our nation is shaken trembling war clouds are flying everywhere the stresses perplexities of time every sign that jesus said was happening it would happen it's happening there will be signs in the heaven and the earth all these things are taking place but he commanded his church to lift up their heads change your thinking in that day to look up for the unseen christ were to be appearing pretty soon so if we would walk by sight we'd be children of darkness sure enough now but i'm so glad to know that there's a light that shines in every believer's heart until the eternal day when jesus will return god change our thinking may we not ever sacrifice a service to our thoughts of tomorrow how many services have we sacrificed on thoughts of yesterday thoughts of tomorrow thoughts of what we got going on and what we're going through and we sacrifice that service god help us i believe we're in the time that we better be in tune because the supernatural is going to start happening so quick that if you're not watching for it you're going to miss it aspire heads just in those last few hours of christ hanging on the cross how many prophecies were fulfilled and they missed it god open our eyes change our thinking tune in when you come through these doors one thought god is god start worshipping him giving him glory giving him praise and honor in the position and place he deserves let him draw nigh to you i wonder how many would just say lord i i want that kind of experience i want to experience the holy spirit to just surround me and draw me into a place a place that may be beyond my comfort level but lord long as it's with you that's where i want to be in your presence lord that's where i belong yes lord father satan tries on every hand every hand lord to bring doubts and confusion and fear lord how many mind battles we fought just in the last few weeks devil trying to punch at us over and over and over again because lord you've been with us every step of the way through every bit of we can say god is god you've been there for us lord thank you jesus thank you father for watching over us i personally want to thank you for watching over me and my family my wife to these dark times we've been through lord my mother thank you lord lord i don't want to be like one of those lepers who never came back to give you praise to thank you for what you've done lord i want to thank you for every healing that took place here lord every deliverance father ever every soul lord that found you thank you jesus oh god we know we're here at the closing ends of time lord and so close satan's trying every kind of way to get our mind on every kind of thing lord the lord may our thinking be on you jesus our thoughts on you lord you've seen the hands that were raised lord god to have that supernatural visitation lord there is a lady here on the earth lord has received a visitation from an angel thank you jesus i thank you for this word lord many have walked away but i thank you for it it's been a lifesaver where would i be lord if it wasn't for your grace where would i be lord if it wasn't for you god

grace he bestowed on you and your life where would you be if it wasn't for this grace where would you be if it wasn't for him moving and touching your life and changing you and oh hallelujah thank you
