it a good fight real fight amen that's what I would like to speak to you this evening we have an opportunity so let's make it a good fight amen a real fight we must remember we are not on a picnic we are on a battlefield you know many people think when they become a Christian that it's all settled there's no more fights there's no more battles he said don't ever get that you became a Christian to fight and you fight the good F amen I become a Christian to get in the battle Christian Soldiers we have been trained we have been taught we have to know how to fortify our we have to know how to fight the fight we can only do that as the Holy Spirit has revealed it to us he says anything I hate to see is a spineless person call themselves a Christian God wants somebody with some grip that has a back Lord give me a back let me fight the devil as long as I got a tooth in and when I don't have a tooth let me gum him till I die so you have to be determined get ready you're going to go to have a fight but let's make it a good fight amen he said when you do that and you come with determination you will take over God said so let's go take it it's our inheritance it's our fight God wants us to have he's willing to give it to us and we receive it he made the promise and it's my promise Satan you take your hands off you remove yourself this is my place this is my position this is what God called me for amen the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far as many as so the promise is here you have to fight Hallelujah you have to battle for it's not easy it's not easy being a Christian no you're going to have wars you're going to have struggles you're going to have battles but he promised you I'll be with you I won't leave you but I won't leave you com I will come I will fight for you amen just as the children of Israel they have been given a natural land we have been given a spiritual and it's time we go and take it over let's take over our healing take our joy let's take our promises let's take what God has for amen amen amen Joshua and Caleb went over to spy out the Land There were 12 Spies 10 came back and said we can't take it we look like grasshoppers who told them that I doubt very seriously that they walked up to a giant and they said what I look like the giant said you look like a grasshopper no it was in their minds amen they were defeated because they looked at the circumstance look at what was around instead of looking at what God amen that's what you have to do you have to turn your eyes off what you see and what you cannot see it ain't our circumstances it ain't our situation it's the promise of God and God has said we can amen when Joshua and Caleb went he wasn't looking at walls they weren looking at how high they were they wer looking at how great they were you know what Caleb was looking for Joshua I'm going to build my house I'm putting my garden right there that's my place right there give me my give me my we're not just able we are more we're not just able to obain the promise we're not just able to take we are more than give me my no matter how high wall matter if they look like giant quit looking at the Giants and start looking at God's word hallelujah amen when men and women quit looking at their sickness quit looking at the diseases and they start looking at what God said about over amen hallelujah can I have just a little bit more sound up here amen you will take over amen ask what you will in my name and it will be done let nothing can you say nothing let nothing stand in your way stop looking at the thing you're looking at right here look to the Unseen God said we can do it said it is promise me my promise me my promise me the promis me everything in the word amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen how you going to cross the river how you going to get over that's not my business my business is to walk down make a way through hallelujah how you going to overcome it's not my buiness I just got to walk down when I get there Make A Way hallelujah amen it's not my business how I'm going to be heal it's God's word amen it's God's business to open up the way it's God's business to you but if you'll dare take it he said any man in the Bible any man through any age that's ever had any get up about them that's dared to stand and call black black and white and take God at his and stand there God will bring it to pass amen amen we talked about David earlier how he got to the place and he heard that cry that that challenge of that go he said the devil's like that when he gets the edge on you and he thinks he's got you there you know he's bigger than what you are than what you are but it ain't about who you are it's about who he is hallelujah it's not about what you've done you send the best man send the greatest nobody would go go fight him but he said I can see God speak to David's heart and said go up there and it begins to move up into that place and Li has come and made his great big ha he said ha one too many times I'm giving a warning to the devil tonight you have haha W too many times you can haha all you want to we are going to get the last last

didn't laugh he said yeah you laughed in the T behind the prophet said God would have struck her down he said but he couldn't because she was part of Abra hallelujah amen amen he would have struck us down too when we laugh said it wasn't possible we laugh said I don't know how it's going to happen God Made A Way in spite of it all and here she comes and she and she's given this body change and she's given a child and she names him Isaac Isaac you know what Isaac means it means laughter God gave her the last laugh and I'm I'm here to tell the devil this bride will be given the last life

Holy Spirit spunk some get out there and do something about amen amen say devil I got a sword and I'll take your head off this day this day you going to fall this is my moment this day you're going to fall before Hallelujah we look at David what did he do he reached down in the valley I was able to go down there in Israel I saw the mountain on this side the mountain on this side and there was a little Brook right down the middle I got me some of those rocks out I'm a giant killer amen David is my father he taught me well amen and I reached down and they got me some of but I got to thinking about that David didn't have to wait for the promise he only had to walk down to where the promise the promise was already laid hallelujah amen amen I lay you out a promise here you can walk right down into the valley and you can grab a hold of whatever you need Hallelujah you don't have to wait for it already here grab a hold of it put it in that sling of Faith around it go it'll kill sickness

what a mighty man of God get PE on what a mighty warrior get be on no no I've seen little Warriors about 13 years old take the word of God and cast Satan out amen my wife was facing some severe troubles several years back and what eight or nine years ago probably yeah Andrew was 10 years old and she was had severe pain in her body and I was busying building the church she was sitting at her

long enough you stayed in my family long you stayed in my marriage you stayed in my situ the amen hallelujah amen sometimes that devil wants to holler boo you need a boo back he's nothing but a bluff amen you take th the lord it's written so what Jesus did when he was driven into the Wilderness he didn't use his pow he used the word already it is written it is written it is written amen showing that the weakest Christian take the word of God and put it upon their it's the same as am it is Rich it is Rich amen hallelujah David didn't just walk into the battle he ran into that's not a fearful fellow right there the Bible says he ran he took it and he slung the stone and hit that you know you would think when a rock H something no it hit him and he fell forward CU everything will bow to the power Hallelujah and the Bible says he ran and he took a sword and he pulled it out of his sheet and he cut his head off amen and he grabbed that old head and he picked it up he's dead [Applause] more hallelujah amen I happen to be over there in Israel and they showed to where he brought that head he brought that head and he placed it right there at a cross and he put it on a spear and he put it up where all Israel see it Champion is their Champion is dead Hallelujah you know it was the same place that an Old Rugged Cross come and it would be put in the same place and he would hang himself showing the champion death has been conquered it is over with is amen hallelujah he said I wanted to speak something to you that Enlighten you to the promise of God for this age that's why we need the promises of God for this age he said I thought I'd try to bring something to your mind that would Enlighten you make you a better Soldier the field to learn the tactics of the enemy so you can block him before it gets to you that's the main thing is to learn how to keep the punches off of you as much as you can amen amen you know how you do that you stay behind the word amen you put the word in front of amen amen this is exactly what takes place you know brother BR said it like this he said one day he was walking taking his daughter I I think he was taking her to school and he was listening to a broadcast and you know on this broadcast I was telling how creation just started from some ashes blowing a few chemicals and also you know the big bang bang I agree it was a big bang it was let there be it was a spoken word of God somebody wants to believe that somehow in all this nothingness two little tiny things got together and we are who we are today fa to believe that then to believe there's a there's a there's a Creator behind the creation there's a designer in charge and he spoke a word and he said let there be and when that word spoke took place I agree it was a big b it was the word of God amen amen so it was explaining how all this took place and you know he said there's no such a thing but Satan was trying to punch at me he said so after I took my little Rebecca to school I turned the radio on again I thought well I probably just getting that stuff again so I turned it off and as I was going up the street Satan said to me do you know that this man that you called Jesus he was just a man like any other man like a Billy Graham or he was just a man that they could begin to have a few people get and say he's a great man and after a while he became greater and then he become a God to them and now it's scattered all over the world and he's dead and that's all the prophet had mine battles too amen amen and I thought Satan how a liar you are Satan you that's talking to my conscience I want to ask you a few who was it that the Hebrew Prophet spoke of would come who was that anointed Messiah who was it that those men who foresaw him his life thousands of years he was numbered with the transgression he worth for our he made his grave with a rich he up on the and he promised his Holy Ghost and I've got it so you might as well get away because it's written in his word and every word is true and he left just give him the word give him the word cannot stand the word Glory Proverbs 18:21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof what the scripture is saying is that words that you speak have the ability to give life or to give death and they have the ability to motivate or discouraged they have B your tongue how many has a tongue yeah we all have it amen sometimes it sounds like y'all's tongue is tied because I don't understand anything you saying but sometimes what your words will speak will either lift people higher or them lower it can Inspire the greatness or push them down to nothing life and death are in the power of Matthew 1237 say says for by thy words thou shal be justified and by th words thou sh be condemned amen amen very important what we speak I thought we was going to make this a good fight we don't use this we don't beat the a we use this amen amen there's power in the words that we why it's important you watch what you're speaking verse 14 seeing then we have such a high great High pass from the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession Hebrews 10:23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith amen the Bible says a double-minded man is unstable in all amen amen this hang tight we're getting somewhere Psalms 19:14 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight Lord Psalms 141 and verse 3 set a watch oh Lord before my mouth keep the doors lip amen Proverbs 6 and verse 2 thou art snared with the words of thy mouth and th taken amen Proverbs 133 he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life he Wiest lip shall Proverbs 154 a wholesome tongue is the Tree of Life but perverse prach in the spirit amen this tongue is powerful but what what what what where does these words come from it has to be a thought before it becomes a word so therefore we got to watch on think he said well brother brother Timothy how do I know if it's my thoughts this question was asked brother please explain how person knows if he's thinking thought or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make him think wrong especially when you don't want to very easy if it's contrary to the word it's theil Amen it's not your thoughts it's not your thinking it is the devil's thinking if it's with the word goding if it's the wrong thought it's the devil the good thoughts and God God Amen so let's put the blame where it really belongs it's not your thoughts amen amen I know as intellectuals that's hard to take but it's not your thoughts the greatest battle ever amen amen Satan is trying to attack your mind negativity there he puts negativity towards yourself prach pic anything constantly trying to anoint that come on now that is the devil thinking another question in the case may may may be that the devil's placing thoughts about a certain thing how may it be that I can overcome or get rid of he said you take the very opposite from if you're a Christian and he tries to make you think you're not a Christian take the opposite say I am aan I am a Son of God I am a daughter of Amen when you answer this he said please pray that I overcome this he said God grant your overcoming whoever you are may your thoughts go right back to the other side say I am a Christian I am a believer Satan you have no hold on me listen to this now he says frankly I'm standing right here the same keep from fainting right here in the pull pit five times has come and I've had to speak the same so the devil he comes at everybody doesn't matter who you are Jesus had mind battle hello somebody I know we think he was God but he was also building human flesh he came and took on human battles the Bible said he was tempted in all things amen just bring it very clearly there was a brother one time that was that was talking to another man and he was having marriage TR trouble because he was having homosexual tendencies and he was sitting there and he said pastor I I don't want to deal with this I don't I this is not who I want to be I don't know what to do but how can you help me you've never went through what I you never been here you never how can you help the Pastor said I bow my head I said God help me he's right I I've never been here I don't know what to say and he said the spirit of the Lord will you tell him I [Music] have hallu Jesus was tempted in all things we don't like to think about that he was temped in all he knows what it's like to go through every Tri every mind and he over he over but not did he just overcome he died and he s his life come inside of you you can overcome that devil the devil wants to sit on you take your life you're not worth nothing you have nothing to give nobody loves you but God says I love you I paid the price amen you tell that devil to take his slimy hands off amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen the Bible says whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest or just or Pure or lovely or of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on amen amen he's the high priest of our confession therefore he cannot do anything until first you he already done therefore you have to speak I'm free I'm delivered I have the Holy Ghost I desire more of God I am amen amen amen amen he was wounded for my transgression he from [Applause] my not will be am hallelujah amen amen yes sir hallelujah hallelujah amen sir he said when God reveal something to your heart speaks to you and gives you Deliverance you only have one testimony he healed me because if you testify to the other side well I just don't feel right don't feel like it it'll come back worse than ever was let that's weak say I'm strong let him that's poor say I am rich I have now accepted Jesus Hallelujah he says say it over and over you keep saying it I'm heal I'm heal I'm Healed and you say it until you actually believe it when you believe it it's going to take place when every time you say I feel bad today you go right back to the same Ro there's not a man or woman that's ever been baptized the ho but if you would start your confession say I lost it gone for me you'll go right back down don't ever have a negative Tes testify positive matter how you feeling feeling has nothing to do with amen if you don't feel the presence of God that has nothing to do with whether he's here I know he's [Applause] here amen and he's here to accept the challeng he's here to heal every disease he's here to save every amen well I'm not a Christian you dropped off right there soon as you begin to testify that well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's what the devil wants you to you're talking his language hallelujah amen you must never say that amen amen amen amen sometimes we come we become very fluent in the devil's language we can quote him more than we can quote a scripture I don't want to be fluent in the devil's language in his negativity amen I know people get negative about all kinds of things it's too hot it's too cold too loud music's rock and roll I've heard it all but I why don't we just make it about what is who really why don't we make it who it's really about these meetings our life our everything it's not about ourselves it's not about our comfort it's not about it's about him amen just drop something in in here for free up in the north there was a there was a p big pond and it was getting cold and freezing over and you know uh that you know the Ducks and the geese they go south for the winter so there was this Turtle he said uh I want to go south I don't like more dug looked at him and said how are you going to he said well I don't have wings he said but what I can do is we'll find a stick and one of you grab this side and one of you grab this side and so they do they take offs pick him up out of the water tur going south go a couple hundred miles they come along another group of ducks another group of ducks looks at this turt like wow wow that's a great idea who thought of that tur said his mouth got him in trouble he opened his mouth and he lost the STI fell to the ground come on now we don't need no turtles in am hey I'm here we're going to have fun Turtle got a shell it's always depending upon that shell it gets a little hot pulls in it gets a little tough got a lot of turtle Christians like come forth back into their I got my own but brother came he said I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to put him in some water I'm going to make this turn to water he said I didn't work I didn't work he said I tell you what I do [Applause] [Music] me I you what need [Applause] Glory am hallu so what's the lesson your mouth can kill you amen hallelujah what are you supposed to say I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him no matter what let your testimony always be positive he said sometimes a negative thought will come you can't help that but don't entertain it he said it's like a farmer said about you can't help them from flying over you can sure keep them from building you happen to be talking to a farmer I know what he's talking about for you green people right now Tree Huggers this might be the time you want to be dismissed little right now when I get to be myself I'm dangerous hey we have
