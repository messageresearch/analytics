bought with the price chicklet redemption this morning bill I am reading [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen I'm so glad for redemption it's sung it down through the ages but we're a part of the people that's been called in this last day a man who are the redeemed of the Lord alive in our generation I remember the scriptures said that to them that are alive and remain that they come in love the Lord I think it means more than just being breathing but I believe there's a people that's really living that's really alive in Christ a man that remains faithful and constant right to the end amen god bless you let's turn to numbers chapter 33 and we'll read from the third verse for our scripture reading this morning appreciate each one of you that has come out to be in the service of the Lord today numbers 33 verse 3 and they departed from ramiz's in the first month on the fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians for the Egyptians buried all their firstborn which the Lord had smitten among them upon their gods also the Lord executed his judgement man god bless you can be seated we're going to be speaking this morning on the night of the Exodus as we just look further into the Word of God and there's some things here that I want to bring out in the service today that has to do with this evening time that we're in and it's certainly a great hour that we're living in yet it's also a time of darkness yet at the same time as Paradoxal it's a time of a great light because the scripture said in the evening time after day of darkness and dismal time it shall be light now Israel had received a prophet vindicated with the pillar of fire with signs proof that he had a message from God you can't imagine God sending Moses down there and that haven't not yet met with him no pillar of fire no vindication no sign no nothing that he was truly son of God ah you know this would have never worked because they had to be sure that this was God because this would bring on some times of great persecution even and great trouble and tribulations because of the message that of deliverance that they had received and so it would take the vindication of God first of all to show that Moses was truly sent from God now as the Exodus were approached they were told as we have been going through it to take a lamb without blemish and applies blood upon the doorpost and upon the lentil and I think it's a wonderful parallel because we too have received the message that the Holy Ghost must be applied even as Israel applied that the blood the token sign of the Holy Ghost the literal life of Jesus Christ must be on display and I don't think these things can be overemphasized because as brother Branham would say you're the token message is the highlight of my ministry my entire ministry so I think if it's a highlight you know that's the focus this is what God wanted to highlight in this day that there would be a people that would have his own life and to have his own life would have his own attributes his own his own signs his own power now so the token sign of the Holy Ghost the literal life of Christ must be on display and that we as believers are in Passover as we went through last week the Passover is not just a feast that um that we would partake of but it would be it would be something that we are in continually they're eating the lamb taking of the unleavened bread preparing for the journey until the summons to come out now I want to review again first Corinthians five and seven because this scripture has been popping out to us as we have gone along remember this is a scripture that would open up to brother Branham there after seeing the vision of the binding of the of the the the deadly snake if he said if you bind this one you bind everything underneath him and so this is of something very key to us being able to bind the Death Angel in this day and that is that we are in a continual communion or Passover with the Lord that it's not a as was often thought if I just get the Holy Ghost you know but just get that initial experience i if I just if I just you know feel the presence of God if it just comes down on my flashing if it just sebade over my spirit you know I error everything's okay I can be I can be done with it I can come just sit back and rest on my laurels and and you know sit back at my pew and just pretend you know that everything is is okay but it's not that way at all because it brings you into a time of Passover into a fellowship with God and it is a continual fellowship it's not something that that just is one initial experience and I want to encourage every person in here who's have an experience with God to seek for another one to seek for a fresh and up-to-date experience with God that it's not just just something you got at the altar twenty forty years ago but it's a renewing of the Holy Ghost and a constant refreshing in his presence and I think this is very important and that we understand that that we cannot none of us can allow our ourselves to get in a place of doldrums at lukewarmness and the end where we're dilatory and slothful and lazy and Laodicea like but we must be a people where you said if any man will open the door I will come in and I was sucked with him and he with me that there will be the Lord's Passover this is a fellowship meal with the Lord that you enter into a relationship with God so it's not just an experience but it's a relationship that you enter into so he said purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are eleven for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feasts notice keep the feast it that Paul is not saying this is a day this is one once a week this is something that we do once a month this is something that we do once a year as Israel would do but let us keep the feast it is a continual feast all right not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth this hour recalled in for transparency it is calling for dedication and sincerity notice on this night in in Egypt I just imagined among the the encampment of the Jews down in Goshen there is not anyone out on the streets there is has been no curfews that's been imposed by the Egyptians but there's no parties going on there's no drinking there's no carousing there's no going in and out is not running to the neighbor's house and back and forth but all the Israelites have applied the blood and have closed the door they have entered into a time where there's no go in the in and out no up and down no no you know in the is someone but their foot it's still out in the world and their heart out in the world and maybe part of them in a Passover but no everybody shut inside a man the Passover lamb has been accepted and is in there being eaten leaven which is a type of sin has been removed now let me explain this to our young people you wonder what Lebanese lemon is it's like a sourdough is a yeast that is put in in their in the meal in the in the flour and you put it in there and it starts expanding and growing and growing and it puffs up the bread and makes it you know pleasurable and light what we call light bread and you know it can be if it makes something instead of being a flat bread which is seemingly real plain it becomes a real puffed up and easy to eat and and it's a type of sealing that's what it is it's a type of sin and it don't take much leaven or much sin to leaven the whole lump because what happens is is that it begins to grow you let sin come in in one form it just continues to grow and expand and gets bigger and a bigger now it's kind of like brother branham a described um the the maniac there at Gadara and he said he he done one little sin maybe he told a lie and then that in the led to another that would led to another until he was now had legions of demons he get invited him one at a time to come in until he is now totally possessed so you see a little bit of leaven starting out with just a little devil may open the way for another devil and it opened up another devil until he became he became not even known by who he was a meant but but known by the devil's that had possessed him his name became a legion right hey man but anyway again you know there there was no eleven that the word is nothing added to it there's no Creed's to puff it up no man's wisdom added to it no schools of theology putting their own ideas into it and and making it a easier gospel to swallow but just the plain simple gospel of Jesus Christ in its saving power and its life-giving measures are you with me hey man so again you know no leaven the type of sin is removed the stop is in the hand the shoes are on the feet you're ready to lead preparations being made now brother branham said this and who do you say this is we're in a critical hour how many would agree with that the world is but the church the real church not the denomination but the church itself is ready for the greatest triumph it ever made the coming of the groom to the bride so here we are you know in a critical hour but what an hour we are from are in for the church it's the greatest triumph it ever made my every age has been waiting for this time as Israel would have been talking about no doubt when they when they arrived there in Egypt again and then that taskmasters came and the people begin to long oh that we had a to go back to our homeland oh that we can return back you know that we could go you know here again we're at a point where we're looking at this world and we're beginning to say Lord we want out of here we're getting what we want to leave this place we believe there's a homeland that we heard about that Abraham saw a city whose bill maker is God and whirring dwelleth righteousness and we want to go to that land we're tired of the sickness and the sorrow and the death and perpetuating the ages and man we want to see it all finished up and there's a longing in our hearts that to hear that we are in an exodus Mallen now this time a Passover is where we're at and you must have the presence of the Lord in your dwelling that's a church in your home and in your body we are in Passover and we're not to leave it until we're called out of this dimension into that great exodus when the trumpet of sounds but I want you to know it's a very dark night and we can hear the sounds and the screams coming from every level of society and it's trying to come in and permeate it's like like a you know what's a demon has been cast out of a person even sickness you know he still wants to come back knock on the door with fear or weed out or some kind of a fresh - frustration you know what I'm talking about and then man he comes back and announced but you got to keep the good man of faith they're holding the door shut and men standing behind the token and saying no I was delivered of that and I'm not taking that thing back hey man I'll never receive that thing again I know what it means to be free and I'm not going back to his slavery and it's bondage again how many feels that way this morning I'm I now of course in this hour of darkness it was a great hour of darkness that Moses when he came to Israel it was in their darkest hours and there was a Jennison Jamboree the Bible said that we stood Moses and I want you to realize why they withstood Moses they came to try to produce to make years look like it meant nothing they come along with with signs themselves to try to devalue the voice of God they came along and Dennis and Jambres were there impersonation remember they're the ones that would threw down their rod and it would become a serpent - hey man and they were they were there would be ones who would imitate or impersonate what Moses was doing to try to detract from the message that God had sent and calls a hardness of heart among the Egyptians amen but it not only caused the hardness of heart among the Egyptians it even caused the Israel to doubt it even caused them to fear it even calls them to wonder and I just want you to understand that we're in a time where where where there's a lot of things that are going on because the message of God has been whispered by every kind of thing you can imagine a man and the enemy has come in in every way he comes in through every time a voice to try to discredit the messenger and his message a man it causes and as we're right here on the birds of the Exodus and and Peter would tell us Peter would tell us it right here at the exodus golfers would arise hey man and these golfers would arise saying where is the sign of his coming you see causing people to doubt the sign and then to doubt the voice and the doubt the message but I'll tell you there is no greater message than a message that will bring you in the fellowship with Christ in the Passover and put silicide a man bring you in love with Jesus Christ and with his word there's no greater message than that hey man now I want you to as we look at this because remember they had their impersonations and they were able to convince many not to get under the blood think about it Jamison jammers were able to convince many not to really get under the blood this is a time of darkness when impersonators will abound what an hour to be living in I just want to go over just a little history as we relate to this age and this night that we're in we'll talk about that in a minute because some will disagree with me that this is night but I just want to make you understand mourning doesn't come till the Sun rises and until Jesus comes mourning ain't here yet so we're in the time of darkness it's a time of great darkness upon the earth now we're not of that darkness and we do have light come on amen Israel is there with light in their dwellings and they're eating the Passover but outside on the other side the blood is all darkness everywhere is that right it's a dark night and there's every kind of hoodlums and every kind of eerie spirits and every kind of creepy thing and let me tell you it's only worse in this day because the Bible speaks of coming out of the river Euphrates in Revelation 9 that are released given permission supernatural demons you can read it in the Bible 300 million of them more coming in this age the what there's ever been so all the sin and doctors heaped up plus things that have been bound loosed God permitted them to come to bring about this end time to bring about this evil age that wetland and Satan now has a Satan's Eden now every kind of thing is right at your fingertip for every sin every kind of darkness every kind of evil is right there it permeates your mind you're thinking your attitudes and you are having to wrestle you are having to wrestle with things that are being said in the world today that science is saying that education is saying that society is saying every time of darkness trying to get in your doors come on you got to have the blood applied hey man if you don't have that blood applied let me tell you you young people going to college you don't have the Holy Ghost it'll sweep you right away you'll get in these liberal arts and they'll change your thinking change your attitude and Mark you Mark you into a demon yourself it'll happen without the Holy Ghost you'll become a legion now not only that in school wherever you are it's part of the society that we're living in now it's the time of Darkness impersonations abound but I want to go back to this walk in our to be delivering it to be to be living in a time of deliverance the angel of the Lord we have had in this generation have visited a little Kentucky preacher and held heralded one of the greatest divine healing moves ever to forerun the second coming of Christ to prepare a people for an exodus hey mom now this would happen and God would saying and sound out of heaven as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second of second coming of Christ this would be resounded there among the the Pentecostals and the meetings there in 1946 1947 on and on and on Pitts there these prophecies would break out and announce that this man was coming with a message that would four-run the second coming of Christ that would prepare a people for an exodus now 1955 and I'm going back on a little bit of history but I I want you to understand this because I've pondered a lot I've pondered a lot about what happened in the divine healing movement and wide that it died why that it just went out to nothing and Men went right back out into organizations worse than what they were most time it didn't help a bit it made him worse than what they were they want to talk about William Branham getting off it in let you know because of him bringing the word to us let me tell you about all Robertson him getting out on the end maa ala then with him getting off at the end I'm an attack Co and him getting off at his end I'm there and oil Jagger's and him getting off in his office and they they don't talk about that I remember because that brother branham wouldn't go with the fluid denomination he got off wonder what happened they a Alan who died a drunk or are all Roberts who God was threatening with his life you know to build a with to raise millions of dollars for him before he left and make it pleas for money and died in disgrace impersonators that Follies have been made known none of them had a message every one of none of them have a message I'm an only there of the one the man who the angel came to wound up with a message and that message is going to turn somebody's heart I believe is turning our hearts back to the faith again are you with me now in 1955 brother Branham was taken consideration of his ministry divined the healing campaigns by this time in less than a decade had turned into who has the biggest hint or who has the most subscribers to their magazine or you see it become all about preachers eagle and kingdom building yet the man who had the angel come to to him and was the most gifted William Branham had no magazine he had no tent and he had no he had no tip he had no magazine and he had no organization I want you to think about this now because this man was set apart from all the others every one of them even Jack Cole when he'd talk about it in the meat he said now tomorrow night brother Brandon will be here he was revered and honored among all of them as being the man who were inspired the whole movement brother Branham talked to Bobby he said I had a magazine he said you know when I started out I you know that they'd come to me and said be good to take some of the money races in the campaigns and start a little magazine to publish what God is doing and let people know and he said one day while I was praying God gave me the name voice of healing and he said in a rank right with my ministry the voice of one crying in the wilderness and so forth and I gave it the name voice of healing so he said God gave me the name for that voice of healing it coordinates with my ministry as the voice of one John the Baptist who was pride in the wilderness outside ended on the denominational ranks and saying come out of her a man come to the Lord yet William Branham would actually he had signed his paper over to Gordon Lindsay and even gave his organization the it's a healing away he signed it over to Gordon Lindsey along with his tent and and he would actually actually have to rent his own tent from the voice of healing this is actually true this is history brother Branham said himself and I'm just quoting him he said I started in I organized a little paper called the voice of healing and and they still have it here well I found out in it that then there was a lots of finances and things hooked up to it and I'll wash my hands of that stuff a long time ago so the voice in healing is not my paper I have nothing to do with it not at all that belongs to brother Lindsey and at Shreveport Louisiana and come to find out I got into that and I thought I was getting out of organizations and I got into one and it was just almost just organized down to every one of them in there and I belong to and hey but he said I belong to just the Lord Jesus and then I can come and go where I wish to and where he leads to me I can be free so this man William Branham was so humble and so sincere too sincere and too dedicated to God to manage a big organization they thought and the historians look back on his life and and they talk about him being too ill illiterate or too naive or perhaps they even insinuate he was too stupid to build a huge Kingdom for yourself and you you know if you just look at it in a way here's a man more gifted than all of them can build the biggest Kingdom the greatest have the greatest name out there had the biggest following had the most money and he refused to build it up because he wants to be true to God in his message and he don't want to build another Kingdom and he's not looking for a following and he's not worried about a news and ambien having the most subscribers and the most famous because he knows what a get a preacher is money women and popularity and so he shuns at all the man gave up his own paper to voice of healing that God gave him the name of gave his tanner to Gordon and the voice of heal and then paid rent on his own town I'm telling you the truth 1955 he would actually abruptly quit and go home because there was not enough money to cover the campaigns he was out in California and was fifteen thousand dollars in debt that's equivalent to a hundred and thirty thousand dollars in today's money now wikipedia reports that during this subsequent investigations it was found that his manager Gordon Lindsey was accident skimming off most of the money for his own use you know brother branham didn't want it so I'll put it to use so it was reported that brother Branham had a salary of seven thousand dollars while Lindsay made eighty thousand to manage the campaign today's money brother Brandon would make a salary of sixty-two thousand a year while Lindsay pocketed seven hundred and fifty thousand a year and when all of this went to build the Christ for the nations in Dallas Texas in its Bible School because then Lindsay would change the name of it from voice of healing to Christ for the nations now it wasn't at all that God had failed to provide it was that men with their own greed and agendas were misusing the funds and by now the field was so crowded with impersonators each one of them touting who had the biggest tent and the biggest magazine with the most subscribers to be you know the and the and the man with the greatest gift who was visited by the message or by the angel with the real message was pushed aside by the masses and the masses followed the impersonators rather than the real one that went out first and the rescue only copied I'm getting somewhere I'm gonna try to bring something down to you about this these impersonators are rows you know Oral Roberts had come to Brother Brennaman in brother branham's Tim brother Brandon would tell about it the Ministry of Oral Roberts first time I remember the first time I met all Roberts a little ragged Tim sitting on the other side I was in I was in Kansas City Kansas and he was in Kansas City Missouri we met around behind the stage and he shook hands with me said brother branham do you think God would answer my prayers for the sick and I said he'll answer anybody's prayer for this thing we got her pictures together it's an old copy of the voice of healing if many of you have it and that's how oral got started out look how his ministry growed and now into millions and millions and millions of dollars now building a big school of theology an oral would go out and impersonate as you know God gave brother Branham a sign in his left hand well oral comes out claiming the power of God in his right hand and turn it you know and of course at the power of God's in anybody's hand it takes away from the virtue of Christ the power of God is not in a man the power of God is he is in the world a man now so again you know then then of course oral would turn off to a prosperity gospel promoting the plan and must see the faith in his ministry sending him money God will bless you financially and return it he would join himself to the Methodists and deny his Pentecostal roots and finally finally he would end his ministry with a with a false vision of a 900 foot tall Jesus telling him to build a great building in Denver and then later God would would tell him supposedly tell him that if you didn't raise three million dollars that he he life would be taken and and so you know he began to you know move on his subscribers to to put ascended money to keep him from dying in the magnons in disgrace Jaco we've talked about him his meeting a brother branham bruh he would have to admit William Brandon was sent here for dispensational purposes Jack go with his big ego starting out a little humble man but then his ego grew and his quest to be the best he would go and measure all roberts10 and built one one foot bigger so he could boast of having the biggest tent in the biggest magazine with the most subscribers and in 1956 he would die he would get sick over here and in Hot Springs Arkansas and go back to Texas and died just a young man 38 years old and died of about of a Harville disease and in his ministry would in and and just go into shatters started out a little Pentecostal preacher Assembly of God another another minister hey Alan an assembly God began with his tenth began being arrested for drunkenness finally found dead at the age of 59 the police found his body in a room stru strung with peels and empty liquor bottles and so they they concluded after 12 day investigation an autopsy the coroner's report was Alan died from the liver failure brought on by acute alcoholism he had enough blood alcohol content of point 36 which was to ensure a deep coma this is how he comes to the end the Bible said their folly will be made known now if this wasn't enough now the pinnacle so started manufacturing tongues and impersonated the gift of tongues by confusing the language rather than having the experience a Pentecost they begin to have where they would teach you how to speak in tongues and you sink your chin and say Jesus over and over again real fast and do you had a confusion of language this is no Pentecost this was an impersonation now remember we're talking about the impersonations are rising and impersonators oh well Jagger's he was another Assembly of God preacher was so inspired by the miracles that he saw and brother Brad was meeting no doubt these amendments start off humbly but see him that he can be enriched by the crowds that were attracted not having an angelic visitation or the gifts he starts promoting the sale of blood and oil that he got from a woman's body and sold it for the purpose of healing next he's selling and marketing vitamins from the Dead Sea and then baptizing unto eternal life claiming that those he would baptize would never die that they they were dead they could never physically die there was that would be not baptized into eternal life now brother Randleman entice and spirits talks about this and he's dealing with all of these impersonations and this is 1955 that he mentions this he said people can jump up and down and shout on mine and speak in tongues like pouring Peas on a dry cowhide and walk out in the morning with enough temper to fight a buzzsaw and go right on and tell something in the church that it caused the whole church to be broke up is nothing in the world but enticing demon spirits oh did you hear that that's what we're we're out of the face in this in this time of darkness enticing spirits seducing spirits and doctrines of devils that all come out in the night of this Exodus he said they go out right out and tell us something that brings up the whole church and nothing in the world but in Tysons the the spirits want to come back to the word for its God is pure da man that's right in Tyson spirit and that verse in the Word of God there's a man not long ago got a little woman this was o L Jagger's he's talking about he said the Catholics got a dozen over there in the time of her menopause she comes out in her hands and in her forehead and if a good Holy Ghost preacher I thought that man that had a bottle of that stuff out of her hands going around and knowing people with it mercy its Antichrist I don't care the blood comes from her nose her head or where brother it's not blood that will take the place of Jesus Christ the Son of God that's the only blood I know she may have had oil in it pour out of one hand and wine out of the other but you use it in a form of religion it's the devil just see our preachers will fall for such as that what we need is to come back to the guidebook back to the Word of God this is the Word of God this blessed old Bible so well I'm afraid to become that brother branham I'm afraid I'll lose some of my joy he said what's the matter you don't know what joy is so then this is what brother Brennan said I'm not trying to take away your joy I'm trying to get your joy in a real experience with God and in Tison Spirit says hey you said I don't condemn a drunkard for going out and getting drunk he's all Moody and he don't know he gets that in the morning he's got the blues a hangover and goes out and gets him two or three bottles of beer and goes out gets him some whiskey and all kinds of stuff little cigarette suckers head back and smoke and bullet to his nose like he was a freight train I don't blame him that's all the joy he knows that's all he knows about he's a pig by Nature but shame on you but profess to be a Christian and rely on such things for joy when the Holy Ghost is nothing but one great big powerhouse of joy the Holy Ghost is a perfect intoxication for every man that's got the booze you can take a you'll drink a drink of the gospel of Jesus Christ I'm filled be filled with the whole goes you're drunk until you leave this world a man joy unspeakable and full of glory that's a constant stimulation it's a constant intoxication drunk day and night Amen that's the Word of God I'll tell you it's time some of us that are in this Passover take another good drink of the wine of the life the blood of Christ and get a new free filling of the Holy Ghost and stay drunk on that where it changes your vision of the world changes our vision about sin and iniquity and the things that are going on it gives you a view like God has because you're influenced by the wine that you're drinking now because of the impersonators now brother branham is ready to quit the ministry he has a vision of the third pole the tenth vision we're not going to go and cover it all of that but I want you to remember that when it comes into that third pull of his ministry he sees a place a little room where miracles are being performed in this little room out of the view in the eyes of the impersonators so he's telling us the third pull when you really come into this world when you really get into Christ nobody can impersonate that said they've impersonated these other gifts but this they will never impersonate Satan we'll never get it now but he also saw the church had come away that had to come away from the carnal impersonating the Holy Ghost because now this is what was happening they were impersonating the gifts and they were impersonating the Holy Ghost and Pentecost had turned into a huge a huge Rauh of just him person Asians they're impersonating the Holy Ghost down at the altar bringing and bringing about a forced confusion of language you know hitting them on the head and saying Jesus over again then taking their their chanting and jiggling that until he gets a confusion of language and call that the Holy Ghost and yet they don't have that hip life yet they never enter into Passover brother Brendan said meaner something mean to come out there you know meaner that and with a temper of the fight a buzz saw there's no nature change that's what he's trying to say but in this brother Brandon began to preach on what Pentecost failed he would look at the whole thing to hold divine healing healing movement and he said here's why I failed and I like I said I pondered I looked at it a lot of times how come in how come it came up and and then died how come it rose up and just a little short time they all melt back in organizations why is it that the great campaigns would just you know go out and he would see it that they would have more emphasis on on money than the altar call and then he see began to preach on why Pentecost fail and in this message he's preaching about adoption and he says it wouldn't grow up into Christ but we're just perpetuating their babyhood I want to get something to you this Passover is not perpetuating your babyhood it's not just remaining an infant Christian immature all the time it's growing in Christ is maturing in Christ it's it's gotten straight from the lamb if you know you're not staying in the weakened condition remember I talked about the little woman the 90 year old laying in the bed granny this time need a bite of this lamb she didn't remain the same drink came into her for the journey and I'm trying to tell you you know you cannot remain a weak Christian with a stunted growth in your life my man but it must be a constant fellowship and a strengthening and growing going from strength to strength and from glory to glory remember that Paul said it that way he didn't say you looked in the word you get weaker and weaker he said you look in the mirror of this word and you are changed from glory unto glory well I'm trying to tell you you know all of us we need to reach out for another glory the glory of yesterday was great remember it's time for another glory is that what bloody Tim you know you you told me the other day and convinced me oh I'll have the Holy Ghost that was him working there and whatever listen I'm trying to I'm not trying to convince you of anything I'm trying to tell you you've got to have a consert fellowship with Christ not a one-and-done experience you see Ephraim wanted to he would explain it he from wanted to plant corn in manassas field in other words everybody wanted a healing ministry for the money and the fame that went with it but what they needed was to grow up into the fullness of the Holy Ghost he preached I'm not a message one of my favorite sermons you want to go to it it's not my most favorite but one of the greatest ones that I have fed over and pondered over and wrote out notes on and just bathing all through the years is the impersonation of Christianity and their brother branham would tell us that the Christian life was being impersonated by claims of sinking the preachers hand her easy believe is amore some kind of fanatical sensation yet lives were not changed instead there was a cheap impersonation of the gospel now remember everybody's not going in the Exodus it's only for the elected I realize in that Exodus that was a mixed multitude that win but that is the way it's going to be in this Exodus only the elect of God is going in the rapture hey man now this is what brother Branham said in in the rapture message he said now so were you if you got eternal life you weren't God before there ever was a world you're a part of son of God an attribute of God he knew that very easy were coming he predestinated you to that age somebody ought to take comfort in that a man to take that place and no one else can do take it care how many impersonation and things you got to be there because he knew you would be there now you are made manifest and now you can fellowship with him and that's what he wants he's longing for fellowship to be worship but if your life that did not always was an attribute in God you're just a mimic of Christianity and there will be millions and billions of them that are just being mimics of Christianity and I'll tell you we got millions who are claiming Christianity today and they're just mimics sheep reproductions imitations impersonations but I read of a rapture or somebody's going to be real and that's what gives me some hope for you and you and you and you and you they're there somebody gonna be real in this age there's somebody gonna be like Enoch whose name was dedicated who walked with God hey man now some brother branham with treats they hidden life with Christ the same the same thing he'd he would name it a lot of different things he would show why the people why some can't keep the victory that's another title Nene in explain that matter isn't lasting there you know what they're eating oh they're running out of it it's going to stay open breeding worms right and he says they're light they're light it keeps going out and because he said you know it hasn't it just has to have a constant care to the lampstand and it keeps going out but he said you know but come he said into the holiest of Holies notice into the secret place coming to the house cut there behind the token come and buy and shut the door and the world sealed off the veil closed combine the veil and there there's a pot of manna that is the same manner that was there on the day of Pentecost and this manna never runs out and it never grows old it never gets failed it's always fresh coming through the inside come into this inside with Christ because in here the light doesn't go out it's a Shekinah glory and it never fades it never dims out it never grows even they'd never have Saba a refilling you know of oil to keep it going it's always constant delight the holy ghost a mile in there behind the veil as he would explain it even a dead stick had come to life and blossom and boom and you can come there dead a man in your sins and trespasses and come through the washing of the water of the word and then there behind the veil and once you come in that veil you can't remain dead remember to god you're gonna be like Aaron's rod your blossom and bear fruit and that's what God's warning in this hour of people that are producing his life this is the age the literal life of Christ this shows that we must be in Passover sealed away with Christ where you're sealed in Satan's sealed out where the constant fellowship with Jesus my man this shows that the hidden life where one is in Passover will not be impersonated and you might impersonate one or two little things but you can't live the hidden life now the life of Christ must be present now the commandment was you stay in the house and don't leave you don't allow under the protection of the blood until you're called out in the rapture this must be eating and the state of preparedness and ready to go and from the slaying of the lamb of the Passover lamb at Calvary now I want you to take it back the impulse said Christ is our Passover so now from password from taking the lamb slain until he comes back we are in Passover a man going back again all the way from there till now we're not to eat we're not to eat 11 bread come on we're not to partake of sin we're to be in fellowship with Christ we're to drink of His Holy Spirit this would happen from Calvary to now every member of the bride of every age had to come in this relationship now so you see Anne from Calgary to now from the time of the slaying of the lamb and the and the sending of Christ and him going away it has been night and we must say and pass over until the trumpet sounds in the morning now look the next Exodus 12 and verse 22 and you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that's in the basin strike the lentil and the two side posts with the blood the Sun that's in the basin and none of you none of you kind of say it again none of you shall go out at the door of his house on the morning so notice shall the blood you don't need snake oil I mean you don't need an impersonation we have the blood and if you don't have the blood get out of that and find somewhere that the blood is mine we have the Holy Ghost and it must be applied strike the doorpost the two side posts strike the lentil a man with the blood that's in the basin oh now listen I'm quoting this from brother Branham if you're sick you see the working of the Holy Spirit don't think you have to have oh brother Jones pray for me to have more faith you got it just take the simple hyssop we'd just found anywhere and apply the blood so you don't need more faith hey man you don't need me to pray for you so you'll have more faith you need to take the faith your God and apply the blood hey man oh god that's it it's something it's not something superstitious or something dang go you go through that isn't it it's just simple childlike faith to apply the blood believe it with all your heart and it'll happen hallelujah hey man what a word that is just believe it with all your heart and it'll happen a man no not somebody come lay hands on me give me that faith no take that faith that you have and start applying the blood just start putting the Platinum things put it on your sickness you'll be healed put it on your sin you'll be saved whatever it is put the blood by faith hey man and none of you said none of you shall go out of that door of his house until morning now watch this is important brother branham would preach the sermons Watchmen water the night he would do this from Isaiah 21 11 the burden of Douma he called it to me out of Seir watzmann what are the night watchmen what are the night the watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if you inquire inquire ye return come brother Branham would preach from this sermon or this this passage in Isaiah watzmann what are the night because he's established and we're in the night but there's a morning coming and that's where I want you to look out today is is you know no matter how dark it is no matter how many impersonation demons run into the street and the Death Angel is howling everywhere but oh brother the night will not last all the time there's a morning coming and we're right here in the last watch before the morning Dawn's Oh hallelujah we're in a time it meant dawn is a time where it's morning yet it's night it's morning yet it's not it's morning yet it's night you get up early in the morning for the Sun is up you say it's morning good morning everybody well you know you know it's not light outside The Sun ain't up it's still dark but yeah this morning and we're in the wee hours of the morning well that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise and where in the morning we're in the dawn hadn't yet broke yet the dead in Christ ain't here yet he hadn't come yet but he's announcing his coming and he's for running his coming and he's telling you the day is about to dawn be awake it's not a time to sleep Watchmen what of the night now the Jews had three watches they would last respectfully from 10 p.m. from sin sunset to 10 p.m. from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. from 2 a.m. to sunrise so that would be the third watch from 2 a.m. to sunrise and then with the establishment of the Roman supremacy the number of watches including an increase two to four and this is what you read about in the in the New Testament when you hear about the case of the fourth Watson Matthew 14 25 and are the terms even of midnight crowing in morning and these would terminate respectfully at 9:00 p.m. and then at midnight 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. so their mornings or their watches was different and I want to get it to you I watched the watts of this night is different it is seven watches because each age had a watch and a watchman and each messenger of every age would bring a message of the condition of the night the rapture message brother Branham tells us notice inna the type of the church here he's also typed in the 7th church age can you think of that the 738 notice that the sounding how many believes are seven messengers so the four the seven churches or we will all believe it if we believe the Bible if we don't believe the Bible course we don't believe it but there has been and we're living in the seventh church age and when the Bible said this seventh church age when the messenger the seventh church age begins the sounders message that the mysteries all these things that's been twisted up all down to the age would be revealed in that time and here we see it the Son of man coming among his people doing exactly kin and confirming his message as he said he would do and here we find it in this last age and the seven watches notice seven watches like the seven watts of one come he didn't come into first watch second watch third fourth but come in the seventh watch that was Enoch the seventh which was translated Noah being a type of the remnant of the Jews is to be carried over now in the Bible times talking about the watches and there were nights were not delivered in two hours in in Bible time the night was not that was not divided in the hours in Bible time he was divided it watches and there were three watches but in ours there's seven it's night but morning comes none of you go out of the door till morning until morning finally gets here until the trumpet sounds don't get out from behind the bug stay in Passover eating the lamb I Passover and keeping the leaven out but it's not morning yet the world is in darkness and we've got light because of the seventh the seventh star in the seventh golden candlestick now I know there's something that are getting a hurry saying well the nights already over we're no longer even in the church ages but that's not true someone to pretend they've already been raptured also that the lamb has let the mercy see because the seals are open but are they true that's impersonators we're stealing in the night of the church ASIS we are as morning stars reflecting and announcing the coven day man the morning isn't fully here until the dead in Christ Rises some just tell you we don't leave the seventh angels message and we stay in the house under the token until the trumpet sounds and my watchman was like a morning star his for running and announcing the coming Sun so so this message was a afar running of the coming of the morning of the Resurrection and the literal coming of Jesus Christ oh my that's why this is why there are stars and lampstands how many remembers in Revelation chapter one and remembers that in the Bible where that rule one and two it tells about seven golden candlesticks seven stars right hey man we know that reply word that speaks of seven church ages seven lamps of fire right all of these things that that are speaking up and brother Branham would tell us in the pathless vision he stands amidst the lamb stands with the stars in his hands remember seven stars in the hands of Jehovah his night but that's when we use lamps for light and that is when the stars are seen shining and reflected the light of the Sun and it's dark and the church is walking by faith in the darkness her Lord has departed from the earth but the Holy Spirit still shines through the church you see the Sun left the Son of God has sended and we went into a time of the absence of the Sun and in his absence he would send seven stars seven messages come on he would send seven lampstands all of us to give a light in his apps so as long as he's not here and then we've got to have the stars for light till the Sun rises until Jesus comes back so now he said her Lord departed this earth but the Holy Spirit is still shines out to the church giving light to this old cinders world and these stars reflect his light also the only light they have is his life how dark it is how spiritually cold yet when he comes into the myths it's light and warm and the church is empowered and through him does the works that he did he would say again in the fees in church age he is there he is with seven stars in his right hand the right hand or arm signifies the power and authority of God sums 44 and 3/4 they got nothing but the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arms save them but thy right hand and I'm armed and the light of the countenance because thou has favored unto them in that in that right hand of power seven stars we who according to revelations 120 or seven church messengers they're angels to the church messengers Angelo's earthly messengers this signifies that the very power and authority of God are behind his messenger to every age and they go forth and fire and power the Holy Ghost with the word and their stars because they reflect light and the light they reflect is his light and they have no light of their own that Kendall not their own fires that man may walk in the light of their sparks Isaiah 51 it is our 11 it is night for that is when the stars come out it is that it is night of the blackness of sin for even the whole world has sinned and are constantly falling short of the glory of God there you are so watchman what are the night and he said the Holy Spirit is that watchman now I want you to notice spirits of God anointing seven messengers and man one Holy Spirit manifests himself in seven different ways to seven different Church ages a man we have been under the watchman of the Holy Ghost God using his messengers to tell us and warn us of the dangers of the night are you with me hey man Luther would do that and tell him that I see a dark horse coming and he's selling novenas and he's selling this and he's selling that don't go fallin after him his death hey man I read his for sale I seemed coming out and he's got a sword in his hand and his slaughter sixty-eight million because of the are they there they for some the Trinity down upon them and killing out and wipe it out but don't don't do that don't you know don't go there be faithful straight through it's a death angel Paul would say you know he's coming on a white horse I see the enemy in the night it's even person ater it looks like Christ it ain't Christ but he's coming in and then city of spirit coming in with it without even without even Erised his bow he's a fake he's not real he's not true he's he had a Christ and he's starting out in the infancy of the church and William Branham would come in this last day and say he's an impersonator and he's a mixture he's all three of them combined the white and the red and the black and His name is death and he'll follows him and I'll tell you what if you want to know what's fixing to happen he'll we'll follow the coming of this death angel hey man we're in a we're in a very horrible two hour and a very dark time but a wonderful hour for those who are called to those who received a message the Holy Spirit is at Watchmen who's making ready the people given warnings from God he's been sent as a watchman we see the sickening healed blinded eyes come in open deaf ears been unstopped cripples walking the lame leaping like a heart what is it it's the coming of the Lord pressing on hey man that's what I can say as a watchman from this pulpit Minh when we see the Holy Spirit moving among us hallelujah when we seem calm and change lives when you see the people becoming desperate for his touch the source of life I being safe in his presence man that ought to give us something to rejoice about when we see the Holy Ghost moving among us healing the sick making the lame walk making the brain bleeds leaving the blind eyes come open Redmon come on somebody and then the Holy Spirit moving out among his people and so Watchmen standing on the wall influenced by the Holy Spirit I want to say to you it's the coming of the Lord man that's what we've been looking for he's coming and all these things and these warnings and people constantly press on right through their beer party see they just go right on and have a beer - yeah you don't matter how about dress yeah ha ha you know and they're using their times of folly and frolic and they dance and they eat and they drink and they marry and they're given in marriage just that God said to be in no way of stopping them then you notice in this great church age according to revelation 3 this saves now one was coming who was given the morning star just before they come in what's scriptural Isaiah was when he said watzmann what are the night the morning cometh and the night also the morning comes but the night comes before the morning what is it anyone knows that just before the break of day just the hours of the approaching day it turns darker than it ever was hallelujah amen we ought to take hope this morning when we look and we see our nation going further into darkness evil encroaching on every side atomic warfare and earthquakes in diverse places all kinds of things that are happening plagues and doctors don't know what to do about that are coming up on the earth it ought to give a real hope in our heart today to note this darkness has to come before the dawn remember it is holy let us know there's a light that is here that is pressing back the darkness it's making the darkness gathered together oh I'll tell you who are you gathering with this morning gather with the light don't gather with the darkness don't let the world push you out in the sin and the d % kidding the light oh my friends he says you know listen to just say the lord if you consider me to be a servant it's just before the break of day that's why this horrible gloom is over the earth it's just before the coming of the Lord Jesus there's no more hope left to nothing but it's coming nations are against nation and their food with God's laboratory till they got power to blow one another into atomic asses and their wicked and their unreligious and their own christ-like and the only moon of the house and objective is to destroy listen they are inspired by the destroy an angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men remember you God does that sometimes it was when he wanted a you have to be to seed remember it meant come a lion spirit out of hell and said I can do it said I'll be a lying spirit in the in the mouth of his prophets man and I'll convince him to go down there to ramoth-gilead and be killed they meant to bring the pasta word Lord listen God has allowed this society man he's allowed it they are inspired by the destroying angel can somebody hear me please inspired by the destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men God in other words has permitted Satan to inspire men with the death angel inspiring making video games movies every other kind of attraction every pornography every other kind of evil that you can imagine proliferating sin pushing down righteousness everywhere that you go to get it every person that doesn't have the seal let me say in the name of the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit has sinned as a watchman on the tower and as the people cry out of the night people cry water the night and until you I'm crying what are the night I'm saying are you weary of this life there anybody weary of it are you arias said is there anybody weary of sin are you weary of funeral processions are you weary of sickness are you weary of ungodliness of ever hand has the night been long and weary a man one of the night watchman and he says the morning cometh the moaning covers and there not be another fear of possession the morning cabinet there be no more prayer for the sake the morning cabin and there won't be another sinner Saints will be over come we'll be hot out in the middle of the night like Romeo come and got Juliet out of the night and stole her away as a thief in the night the morning comes that's the Comfort wherefore comfort one another with these words the Lord Himself the light will come again The Sun will come he'll descend from heaven with a shout with a voice with a drop look at perfect harmony with the scripture that Isaiah was in the regular course of nature always that the approaching of the Sun congeals the darkness together makes it dark he's darkened before the day than any other time in the night why it is approaching light that's making it dark and it's approaching of the Lord Jesus now that's a bringing this gloom upon the earth did not he say when these things become they come to pass lift up your head for your Redemption draweth nigh Palestine is a nation the Jews of life returned from all over the earth and her place there to seem come as God said they would learn the parable of the fig tree when he put forth his buds he said so will it be and that this generation shall not cease shall not be done away with it shall never end until all these things be done now it's today that we're living in the watzmann what of the night he said it would be a time like it wasn't sodom and gomorrah tell me aren't you coming out in the night aren't to beating on the door everywhere aren't they demanded their rights aren't they trying to push right down on righteous lots around to try to force themselves even into his into his home to defile the very angels of God isn't Sodom and Gomorrah I've never had internet in our schools isn't it be puts in our colleges isn't it been priests in our society what of the night its Sodom out there just before the fire burns now the Sun leaving the earth that leaves the moon to take care in the moon shines in the absence of the Sun because the light that we walk in the light of the Sun reflected from the moon now that's what the church is supposed to do reflect the presence of this of God while the Sun is gone and then when the Sun comes up and the moon is gone just before day did you notice the moon gets real pale and it goes out and I'm telling you the church has already paled it's anemic it's got away from the blood it's got away from salvation and the Holy Ghost and the teaching of the word and it's become anemic my man and just cause we got a message sign on our churches don't keep it out a man because it got away from the blood they got away from salvation got away from the Holy Ghost got away from the real truth of the word goes down what happens the Sun is approaching then that doubt darkest hour the night is this before dawned salius science claims it's the night the Sun is approaching pressing coming on pressing congealing the night together because it knows it's got just a little while and the day will break and just before daybreak what comes out the morning star a man now that morning star means the brother to the Messiah he's not the Messiah just a brother to Messiah and the morning star is a herald of the dawn he is saying look here and then I'm up here I'm above the world I'm up here but I'm where the like concern on me and I'm signing back to the darkest dark a night he's coming somebody with me now that's what God did by swinging a prophet he was a hell that the down he was announcing that the son Jesus Christ is coming back to the earth and that's why the miracles of science of wonder everything else it was announcing that Jesus was coming with this power it was the Sun of righteousness shiny with healing in his wings now moving the darkness away now for the church we tour to be morning stars we're to be announcing his coming the light shining on us not dark like the world the light shining on us reflecting back to the world that there is a greater light coming and you are to be a reflection of that light that's what her to be doing in this Passover is reflecting the literal life of Jesus Christ a man now oh he said all morning stars rise and shine it's time to say the coming of the Lord is at hand reflecting his presence reflecting the uncommon Sun given the same signs jesus said it was as it was in the days of Sodom it'll be the same thing in the coming of the Son of Man the same ministry the Sun went down in the same light he went down in his coming in the resurrection power and the morning stars reflecting that light and we cry what ceman what are the night the morning cometh and the night also and now we're in the dark time the Laodicean Church age man is lukewarm not able to stand the things of God that pull themselves off separating like it was in the days of Noah but the morning star signs right on them just the same the power of God the Holy Spirit though jesus said the what should I do shall you also and greater than these say you do for I go to my father he promised the power little while world will not see me no more but you'll see me there God's light will be reflected in his church and more powerful than ever just before the coming of the Lord Jesus watzmann what are the night hey man oh ma listen now I'm gonna try to bring down a few more points now just hang on but in the Laodicean age he says yes this age boast see they're just like the spirit of these impersonators boast of these tremendous doors of worldly goods but the people are less happy than ever this Saints blows of its spiritual attainments but people are less sure of themselves than ever this ain't Bruce a better moral values and more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its knowledge and its science but it's fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that are come up on the earth in one generation we've gone all the way from horse and buggy Age to the species we are proud and boastful about it but there's a dark void a cavern that is crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could be well called the age of neurotics and it's only getting crazier it boasts but it cannot back it up in Christ peace and there is no peace it cries great aptitude of all things and it keeps burdened with a desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith my god to the wicked they are miserable that means their objects to be pitied pitied they scorn pity they're full of pride they've want what they have but then what they have will not stand the test of time they are built upon quicksand rather than the rock or the revelation of God's Word come at the earthquake soon that will come the storms or the wrath of God in judgment then come a sudden destruction and in spite of all their common preparation they're still unprepared for what comes on the earth and I'll just tell you they can't prepare you for this Exodus and let me just give a message to all the Preppers out there that are preparing for all the terrible times coming you can't build a wall tall enough you can't dig a hole deep enough you can't provide enough food enough weapon you cannot do it there's only one thing that have prepared you for what's coming there and that's the escape that God comes provided it's called a rapture the coming of the Lord Jesus I know I know all about Preppers because my family was Preppers before it was popular they knew they leave they went out there got him a hundred and twenty acres where the bride could come and write we can escape tribulation and trouble that's coming in and all of this and it's not a place of safety everything we learn you know running after armadillos and how to cook them in meat and opossum and raccoon and living off the land and nature and all of that is nonsense means nothing it amounts to nothing there's only one thing to prepare you and that's this preparation I'm telling you about get in that secret place with Jesus you can't fortify your family except behind the blood you can't protect them listen you can try to protect them or you want to but you can't protect them from you right you can't protect them from demons there's only one thing they'll protect him and that's the blood that's why ever house must come under the blood vii watch for the seventh Church AIDS the sin of the

here there's an Adam beside hallelujah somebody's got a water the camel just bring me a glass of water sterile my desk these are things happen on the Laodicean age I just want to go through and I'm and I and I've gathered about 75 things and every one of these are snippets just little phrases from brother branham's sermons down through down mother most of them most of me they're from the church age book her from this room after the seals a few scattered here and there but listen this all happens in the night in the last age just before the Sun rises would you like to hear it would you like to know what what this messenger said of the night just before the trumpet blows for the dead and Christ to rise the messenger The Herald of the dawn the one with a message to full run is coming starts telling us some things about the night what's happening in the night as we're making ready to leave here and remember part of this Exodus here's the preparation the staff is in the hand and it shoes are on the feet you know the loins are girded up you're ready for travel so part of this house over is preparations for the journey getting you ready for a rapture given your faith revelation / rapture that's part of the Passover know so all of these are snippets I made this call them 1 or 2 3 just but they're not in some chronological order I've just put them put them here God is building in seven Turk changes a bride for Christ so all through this night he's been building the bride got one of every age that's the whole of the church ages is God dealing with the Gentiles and calling out a Gentile bride to himself now you know what all this is about that makes the church ages in the fullness of the Gentiles the one of the same thing so when the church age is over the fullness of the Gentiles is over the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age the church ages are represented by seven golden candlesticks who walketh in the midst of the candles seven golden candlesticks Christ is in their midst one should understand Oh a lever Church aids crisis in the myths Christ walks in the midst of the church in this Passover you're not alone the lamb is his fire is there the Holy Spirit is present behold him is even now walking in the midst of the churches through all the ages this very hour he's walking in the midst of the last ages candlestick oh he's still here how is he here in the form of his Holy Spirit not in his corporal coming now he stands in the midst of the church as he stands there revealed who he is in this last age with him in her myths with him motivating her she becomes a wonderment of all his party and the fullness of him that filleth all in all somebody say a man that's why he could look right down to the last stage we'll all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his a missus an up nipping it he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing the midst of the church receiving glory from his brethren if he did not make sure what he was as he walked in the first days he is even now in this last age Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever for seven out of seven ages I said I've seen nothing but men esteem in their own word above mine and certainly that happened among the impersonators so at the end of this age I'm spilling you all out of my mouth it is all over I'm gonna speak alright yes I'm in the midst of the church the a man of God faithful and true will reveal himself and it will be by my prophet in this last day there is to be a prophet there is but one prophet messenger to this age there is what this one in Revelation 10 7 is a seventh age messenger and in the days of the voice of the seventh and messenger when he said beginning the mister of God to be finished as he hath declared his servants of prophets notice revelation 10 107 all the mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by the messenger of the Laodicean church we stand in the Laodicean Church age the Prophet messenger of revelation 10 7 must already be in the land the seventh messenger and it is a man and he's going to be is to bring a message from God and his message and ministry is going to finish the mystery of God as he declared to his servants the prophets in the days of the Laodicean age the messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul and now in this age we'll come back to the capstone revelation the most important revelation of Godhead in the whole Bible in this days of Laodicean age that messenger will reveal the mysteries as revealed to Paul he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul listen to the earth indicated prophet of God who appears in this last day what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word and neither can the word climb above any Laodicean Church age we're in the last stage not back in the Pentecostal age there we are over here in the last eight and the first stage began with the word which was Christ and the last ages to end with the word which is Christ those electrodes him and that day will be the ones who truly manifests the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth by the messenger to this age those who receive that prophet and become a bride of the last day the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing but it's also fact that the profit for the last days must be bringing an important message from God that will forerun the second coming of the Lord for by His Messenger were the hearts other by his message we're the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal father's and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of power thus this church beginning in acts is God's blueprint for all ages until she closes out in the Laodicean age what sit carefully let every age take heed for what is going on is only the start that little tree that is what's planet is going to grow it's going to grow through the ages then this then is a message for every Christian through every age until Jesus comes the seventh age a very short one very short age gathers itself and gathers up and do itself for one quick work yet all the reality of Pentecost in the last days there will be a group raise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the Spirit that word has never failed in the mouth of believing Christians and then this last age is stronger and greater than ever in the two word bride it rare will be the fullness of Pentecost for the Spirit will breathe bringing the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord God isn't going to plan a new church but it's going to bring his original planning back to original seed this is the age of restoration it is age of the Venice cycle the Pentecostal age speaking of Azusa Street did not restore but God has to restore because he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration and God will bring take the church back to Pentecost of the beginning the age of the restoration by another outpouring like in the beginning in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ for in this this last season is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride hey man you like these words man they were spoken about right here this aids is 7 watts hey man now coming down this is a 45th snippet now so we come to this last stage the Laodicean age that is our age amen we are living on up here to the bride age that called it out of the church and getting it together for the rapture that's age we're now living we are living in the Laodicean age we are in the seventh church age before the king Texas throne we are worshiping now under the Feast of Tabernacles the seventh church age we are at the end of the seventh church age when I say them that doesn't mean it's this very hour this very minute this is the bride age this is evening light this is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern this is Luke 17 30 to be fulfilled the age in which the true church would be returned to be in the bride she was at Pentecost the first time there will come forth for the bride age for resurrection out of duck denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has returned back again in his full power hey man what a message I said what a message found that that there's a message a message that what that the full maturity the word has returned back and it's full power oh man to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and sat down with my father in his throne we find the true vine true spirit true church people exalted to the very throne of God with the highest compliment ever paid to a humble steadfast spiritual group to be given to you you're going to sit with me on my throne you're gonna have a rapture harvest time this is age this age is the last of the seven Church ages what began at the first of vision age must and will come to full fruition and harvest in the last or Laodicean age the two vines where you'll define fruit both the true and the false find the corner wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground and I see has come back to the original word grain again the Laodicean age comes in quickly bringing the rate wheat to harvest just at the end of the Laodicean age just before Jesus come the church would go back to go being a word seed bride being a wheat seed bride again and now we're right back like all nature acting right back to the original see right from one church to another and then this last stage here here we are right back to the original thing that fell in the day of Pentecost to fulfill every scripture the bride the church will mature and her ripeness will be an identification with the Lord by the means of the word in her head who will come to her in some mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ the original wheat seed a Pentecost was to come back in the last age and it's to mature at Laodicea this the true seed already maturing and then the harvests the Laodicean age is the harvest time of the gathering of the tears for the burning and the binding and the burnin and the gathering of the wheat for the Lord yet it is the harvest time in the wheat was also almost must mature and to her God is sending the prophet messenger with a vindicated ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they will hear him as the first church heard Paul and she will mature in the word on to becoming a word bride and the mighty works will be found in her that's always attended up on pure word and faith oh listen to this is not only that but this is resurrection our rapture our it was the seventh age when he came and woke up all those sleeping virgins the dead in Christ he's talking about through the ages the years the ages he's built a bride born a bride begotten a bride on earth for Christ from the seventh age the seventh church age all the way back three woke up and these are in this church age 11 they were changed in it was raptured the seven suing that it's the seventh church age that takes a rapture that knows no doubt we're in the seventh church age we all know it now the seventh church age that takes the rapture we we know him as much as our limited senses can let us but one day it will be face to face he is coming and this is that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age and partial realization will be made perfect realization complete it realization [Music] hallelujah partial realization oh brother I don't care how much you know about him no I don't care how much you've learned about him I don't care how much you've experienced it's still only partial but we're living in the hour there's going to be a people come to face to face with Jesus Christ in the Corporal coming face-to-face what's it going to be like partial realization give way to perfect realization this is the last warning there will not be another the spirit will not speak in another age so where in my age pass the spirit won't speak there the ages are over but thank God at this moment this age is not over layout is here it hasn't ended when it ends the church is gone so as long as the church is here it hasn't ended are you here age is still going on the bride when she's taken from the church the church age will cease they ought to see her goes in the chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation sets in Watchmen what are the night what do we expect in this time do we just look to protect pets wait and go into another another watch or not there's no other watches the last watchman has already came and described and told us what happens in this watch what was it boy it was to make you ready and he tells you that you must be under the token that the Holy Ghost must be applied and it must be the more than just the initial striking of blood and you just go delight as though nothing happened this is a cup of the Lord and you'll either have the goods or you'll be left behind this is a time impersonation in acting I get and pretending will get you nowhere nowhere but the tribulation this is a time that calls for more sincerity more dedication more consecration but the musicians come because we're rejecting the message of the exodus there will be many many left behind I got said in Egypt there was a mixed multitude they left with Israel but not this time only those that are washed in the blood of Jesus filled with the Holy Ghost will go in this rapture Exodus you see in that time anybody could kill a lamb put their butt on the door and get behind it and escape the Death Angel it was physical so you could be an Egyptian and go kill a lamb put this blood you could go and you can also eat the lamb the Passover do all you can go through all the acts but in this time it ain't possible it's not a little blood it's the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost is required to go in this rapture to escape to come in judgments and those judgments will begin at the resurrection of the Dead I'm gonna leave you with something the Bible tells you they spent all their time bearing their dead want you to stand with me right now I spent their time burying their dead there would be mourning and death and dying all over the land of Egypt when morning Dawn's six sealed judgments of God began in the spiritual manner when the Church of Laodicea rejected a message it'll turn physical the things that they did in the plagues against the Jewish people driving there which simply drove them back to their homeland will return in vengeance as vials of poured out and if you look at the vials and the trumpets they parallel each other what happened and the water here happened the water there and the parallel each one of them all the way down to the seventh trumpets and the seven vials and what they did to God's people in the trumpets the dryer that slowly served the drive Israel back to their homeland where they murdered and killed six million Jews and no telling how many other people it'll be turned back in vengeance as a wrath of God begins to fall on this world and the vials of judgment are poured out it'll turn physical the rejection of the message for their deliverance began the judgment on the church in a spiritual manner forced out of people out of the church to go back to their homeland that we've been preaching about it will turn physical they'll pay for their rejection and the church who thinks they're under the blood but didn't really apply the blood you see they maybe they just got it in one realm or another and they never come into Passover and not hidden life but went on about just frolic we'll go into the tribulation and be punished for her deeds of rejecting the atonement of the blood that could have saved them that's what's happening in this dark hour now then Matthew 27:51 play that song he's coming soon involved the tail of the temple was rent in twain from top to bottom and the earth did quake in the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many of the bodies which slept arose and came out of the grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to mithi this is what happened in that resurrection a word appeared e is a word in Ponzo which means that showed oneself come to view it was seen a beard by too many came out of the grace [Music] let me read you a little quotation from the sixth seal we should have visualized now it's the last night it's the last watch of the night we eating the Passover staff is in our hand we're prepared to leave as soon as the trumpet sounds the sixth seal God let the people be quickly awakened Lord those who have their names on the book of life when this light when this flashes across her path they they see like the little in fairly old faint woman at the well that day she recognized quickly and she knew the scripture and our Father I pray that you receive that all will receive you at this time in the hearts and will settle it forever in the South that their finish was sin that arise and made preparations now for public confession of the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin to show they believe God has forgiven them and they take on the name of Jesus Christ and father poured down the holy oil spirit of Holy Spirit of oil upon them that they may be placed into the service of the service of the Lord that there may be workers in this last day but we realize that we have just a short time and the church might go at any time the lab might at any time leave the sanctuary up there in the throne of sacrifice come forward from the throne of God with his sacrifice Laden and it's over there's no more hopes of the world she's finished then she goes into frustrations of great spasms of earthquakes and great shakings like was at the resurrection like I just read about and as Christ rose from the grave when the saints rise the same thing will take place lord it could be at any minute we're watching for that glad day to arrive take your children under your arms father now draw your little lambs to your bosom granite and feed them on the word till they're in strength for service I want you to think of this the sounding of the trumpet but Jesus Rose the dead in Christ roots with him appeared to me the Bible said it was a great earth brother Brent said the same thing will happen again you realize we've been waiting on when prophesy I mean this man this man's prophesied accurate time on time and time again over and over nope never failed one time stood there in 1965 shoes another bride said there's a bride being chosen you gotta have the characteristics of Christ he's coming for a virgin somebody to recruit then he spoke about Los Angeles how long you'll that's your hangover like a sand bar it's just quaking beneath you now the works had been done in Sodom and doesn't you you you know their Sodom would have repented but you would not you don't know what hour you'd be laying at the bottom of the sea and right now we're just looking they're calling it they're calling it the swarms of earthquakes it's trembling everywhere just hit over again in the Mojave devlin desert of seven point something the earthquake they said the big one hadn't hit we don't know what's gonna happen when it does but I'll tell you what we know this the dead in Christ gonna rise this parallels exactly that coming and there's an earthquake about to hit the world will go into nervous frustrations six seal will open with every kind of judgment can imagine every seat will be cast out of heaven as the bride goes up you don't have a short time of darkness upon the earth before the Millennium day dawns that's when Jesus coming back to have you come in the Passover are you really in that fellowship I want you to think about it God made a desperate soul when you come in you say I've gotta be you can't go in Oh mum and dad's experience somebody else's you got to know Christ yourself he just paid him a fire we gotta have something real here you can't cook lamb with a painted fire Kate serve it raw got to come to the right temperature and I'm asking where are you having Christ you make your call and election sure today the other day I stood at this pulpit told you about brother Branham binding the summit him taking the Bible he said Lord my children are coming they'll wake up any moment so just let me find the place in the scripture and it opened right there the first Corinthians that I read purge out that old eleven crisis our past so far you've got to have that sincerity truth when I read when I realize that even some old timers are letting the blood get off the door I'm asking you in a time for a fresh application of it at that time for a renewing of the Holy Ghost in your own life won't you ask him to do it would you draw nigh to God you know nothing you a man we know he's coming soon this can't play with it they're famous laughter you you may just be one step ahead but he'll get you but he can be bound there's got to be a church alive and remain that can bind that Death Angel that can say all God have mercy on my brother no they've been given the power to buy are you ready to walk into that sincerity I'm asking this church over you are you ready as it church people to come in that sincerity and that dedication with God are you ready for a rapture interrupt her atmosphere already in your heart and your hearts gonna come and you're not a scuffle you're not just ridiculing you're not just sitting back to look warm but you'll fire for God ask him with all your heart [Music] [Applause] [Music] we well [Music] ha jumpy da [Music] Harry [Music] [Music] behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling

immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death Oh death Oh death angel you're gonna be swallowed up in victory is that people of that promise is loaning a man would be right here and was swallowed up in victory swallow us up and then the shat must change and it did
