[20:15] One More Time Lord that these mortal
[20:17] bodies would take on immortality Lord

[20:28] strive with our flesh but Lord we would
[20:30] yield to the spirit that is within us we
[20:34] love you with all of our hearts Lord and

[44:43] I believe we're in the season Lord of
[44:45] all things are possible
[44:47] the season Lord of your return Lord the
[44:50] where these old bodies will take on new
[44:52] bodies and
[44:53] the dead in Christ arise and we'll go to
[44:56] meet you in the air what a day that'll
[44:58] be Lord
[44:59] Lord we don't want to ever forget
[45:03] to give you praise for all that you've
[45:05] done and magnify
[45:08] you Lord the name that is above every
[45:11] name
[45:12] we love you father
[45:14] Lord we praise you and thank you for
[45:16] this time together
[45:17] in Jesus name amen
[45:21] amen let's turn to Zechariah 4.
[45:29] amen us
[45:33] going just a few weekends ago to brother
[45:35] Dale Smith's and
[45:37] and um had a wonderful time there with
[45:40] him and his congregation and
[45:42] and
[45:43] um was able to spend some time in
[45:45] fellowship with him and also he wants me
[45:48] to maybe make sure that I give his
[45:51] greetings
[45:52] I haven't been here on a Wednesday night
[45:54] to minister in a few weeks for their uh
[45:57] Matthew McGary was here that weekend
[45:59] that went Wednesday after I got back and
[46:01] brother Aaron last Wednesday and man we
[46:04] just had a wonderful time of the Lord
[46:06] amen I'm just so thankful for Real Men
[46:09] of God and that will stand shoulder to
[46:11] shoulder and declare the promises of God
[46:13] and amen without fear of favor amen and
[46:17] we're just thankful for that and uh so
[46:20] we've been a little bit sick and body
[46:21] but we're getting over that and we're
[46:24] thankful for the strength tonight to
[46:26] ministers this is looking here at
[46:27] Zechariah Zechariah Chapter 4 and verse
[46:31] 1. it says the angel that taught with me
[46:33] came again
[46:35] and wake me as a man that is awakened
[46:38] out of his sleep
[46:40] it said unto me what see is thou and I
[46:43] said I have looked and behold a
[46:45] Candlestick all of gold and a bowl upon
[46:48] the top of it
[46:50] and his seven lamps there on and seven
[46:53] pipes to the seven lamps which are upon
[46:56] the top thereof and two olive trees buy
[46:59] it one upon the right side of the bowl
[47:02] and the other on the left side thereof
[47:04] so I answered and spoke to the angel and
[47:07] talked with me saying what are these my
[47:10] Lord
[47:11] then the angel that talked with me
[47:13] answered and said unto me nois thou not
[47:16] what these be and I said no my Lord then
[47:19] he answered and spake unto me saying
[47:21] this is the word of the Lord unto his
[47:24] removable saying not by might nor by
[47:28] power but my by my spirit saith the Lord
[47:32] of hosts amen we'll let you be seated
[47:37] I'd like to speak to you this evening on
[47:38] the light the fire
[47:41] fire amen
[47:43] you know as brother Brandon would bring
[47:46] this scripture out in the Patmos vision
[47:48] he would begin to explain the things and
[47:51] and reveal the things that were spoken
[47:53] here
[47:54] and it was talk about the trees that
[47:55] were on either side of this lamp that
[47:58] was Burning Brightly he said it was
[48:00] Burning Brightly because it had plenty
[48:02] of oil
[48:03] amen and so it was getting all from both
[48:06] sides and it was forgetting from these
[48:08] two olive trees and these two trees
[48:11] represent the old and the New Testament
[48:14] and of course the oil test tip typifies
[48:18] the Holy Ghost now I I think that's a
[48:22] wonderful statement that it had plenty
[48:24] of oil that it wasn't something that was
[48:26] about to run out or something that was
[48:28] in even in the context of worrying about
[48:31] but it was filled to the brim and I I
[48:34] believe that the the word of God is full
[48:37] of the promises of God they're full of
[48:40] the goodness of God they're full of the
[48:42] mercy of God they're full of everything
[48:44] that we have need of amen and I'm
[48:47] thankful that we don't have to worry
[48:48] about or that's something in Our Minds
[48:50] tonight that it's running out because
[48:53] it's not running out because there's
[48:55] still power that lays in the word of God
[48:58] and so of course it all typifies the
[49:00] Holy Ghost which who alone can give the
[49:03] light of God to the people and the angel
[49:05] spoke to Zechariah as much saying this
[49:08] is what you see it means that the church
[49:11] cannot accomplish anything by its own
[49:15] might or power it won't accomplish
[49:17] anything by its own theologies or its
[49:20] own intellectual conceptions or its own
[49:23] abilities it'll only accomplish things
[49:25] by the power of the Holy Ghost that's
[49:29] why Paul would come and he would say I
[49:30] do not come to you in word or deed only
[49:33] but I come in you to you in spirit and
[49:35] demonstration of the spirit of God Amen
[49:38] because it's not by my own might it's
[49:40] not by my own intellect now Paul could
[49:43] have he had intellect intellectual
[49:45] ability he had great school and he he
[49:47] had the abilities to put words together
[49:49] and maybe uh speak about the Greek words
[49:52] and all those things he might he could
[49:54] have maybe done all of those things but
[49:55] he was not relying upon that he was
[49:58] relying upon the one he met on the road
[50:01] to Damascus and the one that he met on
[50:03] the road to Damascus the light of God
[50:05] the pillar of fire amen that is what he
[50:08] would rely on throughout his whole life
[50:10] and his whole journey and I believe
[50:12] that's what we are relying on tonight
[50:13] but you notice you couldn't put a pipe
[50:16] in there amen or something you had to
[50:18] have a certain uh to draw the oil up it
[50:21] had to be something that that could that
[50:23] that was had a certain consistency about
[50:26] it or a certain nature about it that
[50:28] when he was dipped into the oil it
[50:30] couldn't be metal or it couldn't be a
[50:32] pipe or it couldn't be uh just it's
[50:34] anything you want it was a special thing
[50:36] that you would take and run down through
[50:38] there it was called a wick and brother
[50:40] Brandon would talk about that he said a
[50:41] wick is Faith he said well Wick is Faith
[50:45] and it's got to be run down into the oil
[50:47] of God and when it's run into the oil of
[50:50] God he said when you have your faith one
[50:52] end of it lit up by the fire of God the
[50:55] other end of it dipped in God's holy the
[50:58] ghost all there's going to be a Shining
[51:00] Light there's going to be something take
[51:03] place amen but we examine the lamp stand
[51:06] and we examine this Reservoir and we
[51:09] could see that in the central of it
[51:11] would bring out seven arms and we know
[51:13] those seven arms would typify amen seven
[51:15] Church ages and and and and and it would
[51:18] come out as we know the seven
[51:19] candlesticks would speak about each
[51:22] Church age and this but the same oil
[51:24] that burnt in this first church AIDS of
[51:26] the same oil that burns through every
[51:28] seven every one of the seven pipes and
[51:31] and another thing about this
[51:34] that that light never went out
[51:38] amen the priest what they would do they
[51:40] would just keep pouring oil in the bowl
[51:43] amen that's what I believe as priest of
[51:46] God we ought to make sure that our
[51:48] lights never go out amen that we
[51:51] continue to pour the all of God into the
[51:53] lamps amen that they continue to burn
[51:56] now as we know this lamp was lit in a
[51:58] very special way it wasn't lit by Moses
[52:01] it wasn't lit by Aaron it wasn't lit by
[52:03] the first priesthood amen but the
[52:06] priests would take a fire from the
[52:08] sacred altar which was originally lit by
[52:11] the fire of God when the fire of God
[52:14] would come down and it would come down
[52:15] to that sacrifice and it would light
[52:17] that first burnt offering amen that
[52:20] would continually feed that fire
[52:24] excuse me for a moment
[52:26] they would continually feed that fire
[52:28] and that lamp would begin to continually
[52:30] burn because it was to be lit by the
[52:33] original fire and so it would go from
[52:35] the first one to the second one to the
[52:37] third one to the fourth one to the fifth
[52:39] one to the sixth one lit by the original
[52:42] fire amen lit by the original fire the
[52:46] Holy Fire from God's altar being passed
[52:49] from lamp to lamp he said what a
[52:51] wonderful type of the holy spirit in the
[52:54] seven Church ages the original
[52:56] outpouring of Pentecost which the
[52:59] outpouring came direct from Jesus on The
[53:01] Mercy Seat
[53:02] isn't doing his church through seven
[53:05] ages and showing forth perfectly that
[53:08] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[53:11] and forever he's a never-changing God in
[53:14] his Essence and his ways amen so that
[53:17] fire it was signifying that God is
[53:20] always the same amen the light that Lit
[53:23] the first one is the light that lits
[53:25] lights the last way amen it isn't the
[53:27] intellectual abilities of Paul that
[53:29] lights the seventh Church age it isn't
[53:32] the abilities of Peter that lights the
[53:34] seven churches but it's the original
[53:36] light of God
[53:39] amen as Jesus would say I'm Divine ye
[53:43] are the branches
[53:44] he is the main Vine which come out of
[53:47] the original root from the original seed
[53:49] that has the life in it now that vine
[53:52] does not bear its fruit it's the
[53:54] branches that does that but you can say
[53:56] you can take any kind of citrus tree and
[53:58] you can graft other limbs you can take
[54:00] an orange tree and you can graft a
[54:02] grapefruit or you can graft a lemon or a
[54:04] tangelo and all those limbs will grow
[54:06] but if that life of that tree ever puts
[54:10] off another Branch it'll have the light
[54:12] of the the life of the root inside of it
[54:14] amen and I believe that's what we're
[54:16] looking at tonight if the life of Jesus
[54:19] Christ is putting off another Branch it
[54:22] has the same attributes it has the same
[54:25] life it has the same power it has the
[54:28] same Spirit it has the same light it has
[54:32] the same fire it has the same Holy Ghost
[54:36] amen it will be the same kind of Branch
[54:39] amen it was brought forth at Pentecost
[54:45] man it will speak in tongues it will
[54:48] prophesy it'll have powers and signs of
[54:51] the resurrected Jesus Christ and because
[54:53] it's thriving on the natural resources
[54:57] of the vine itself
[55:00] hallelujah amen we're not thriving on
[55:03] our own resources we're not thriving on
[55:05] our own abilities to gain strength or to
[55:08] be stronger or to be a strong movement
[55:11] that's not what we're thriving on we're
[55:13] thriving on the resources of the Vine
[55:17] and in the resources of the vine there's
[55:20] Divine Healing amen there's power
[55:22] they're speaking of tongues there's
[55:24] prophesy there's all of these things in
[55:26] the resources of the Vine
[55:29] amen but you see it wasn't you can't be
[55:33] grafted in it has to be born in Amen to
[55:35] be part of the original that's the
[55:37] problem with a lot of people we get
[55:39] grafted members
[55:44] amen say a few good things make a good
[55:47] pledge shake hands with a few people and
[55:49] we grafted them in they have a new
[55:51] theology they have a new message they
[55:53] have they've got that got the rules and
[55:55] the regulations this that and the other
[55:56] listen we don't need rules and
[55:58] regulations that's not what this message
[56:01] is about this message is about a life
[56:06] amen the message did not produce new
[56:09] rules and regulations the message pulled
[56:12] from the resource
[56:14] amen amen and it's in the resource is
[56:17] where it is pulled from it's in the
[56:20] Bible that's where it comes from and
[56:22] that's what gives us trees
[56:25] amen is not man amen is not it's not our
[56:29] denominational thinking it's not you
[56:31] know denominational thinking that can
[56:33] direct men
[56:36] you know a human I remember you know
[56:39] some folks that showed up one time and
[56:41] and they thought that we just regulated
[56:43] our sisters in a certain way that they
[56:45] wore dresses and that's just what they'd
[56:47] done and and you know one of the ladies
[56:49] said you know if we just talked about
[56:50] the Tim I'm sure he would let us wear
[56:52] pants and you know that's what she
[56:54] thought she thought it all come from a
[56:56] man
[56:57] amen they thought that you were wearing
[57:00] what you were wearing or doing what you
[57:01] were doing because of the decrees of a
[57:03] man no that's not why we do what we do
[57:07] we do what we do because we're born amen
[57:11] into the vine there's a life that flows
[57:14] through us and comes out of us and we
[57:16] can't help Who We Are
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:21] amen so if you expect to change who I am
[57:24] amen I can't help who I am
[57:29] amen I can't help that I was amen born a
[57:32] Son of God I can't help that I was born
[57:34] amen after the same life that Paul was
[57:37] born after and Peter was born after and
[57:40] all the other men throughout the ages
[57:42] that were born of The Same Spirit
[57:43] therefore we have the same life we have
[57:46] the same attributes we have the same God
[57:48] moving through us
[57:51] it's not regulated by man
[57:55] amen is regulated by the resource
[58:00] it's in the Bible
[58:02] but you know how thrilling you know is
[58:04] to think of these seven lamps drawing
[58:05] life or light from the resources of that
[58:09] Main Bowl because their Wicks were
[58:11] dipped therein each age Church age
[58:15] messenger is depicted here his life is
[58:17] on fire with the Holy Ghost
[58:21] good
[58:22] his work he's drawing the very Life of
[58:25] Christ by it gives out light to the
[58:28] church what kind of light is he given
[58:30] the very same light the first one gave
[58:35] Hallelujah we don't have a different
[58:37] light we have the same light
[58:40] we don't have a different life we have
[58:42] the same life we don't serve a different
[58:45] Jesus we have the same Jesus
[58:48] the same one Paul priests is the same
[58:51] one we believe
[58:55] amen the very same light that was in the
[58:58] first lamp that was lit and right on
[59:00] down to the ages to the last day
[59:02] messenger the same life the same light
[59:05] is manifested by a life that's hidden
[59:08] Christ and God he said well that's
[59:09] wonderful praise the Lord that's the
[59:11] messengers he said but it also speaks of
[59:14] what speaks of the messenger but every
[59:15] True Believer is also dramatically
[59:18] depicted here too
[59:21] amen they're all drawing from the same
[59:25] source
[59:27] Hallelujah they all have been dipped
[59:30] into the same Bowl they have dead to
[59:32] themselves are alive for their lives are
[59:34] hidden Christ and God and they're sealed
[59:36] in by the Holy Ghost no man can pluck
[59:39] them out of his hands their lives cannot
[59:41] be tampered with the visible life is
[59:44] burning and shining and giving light and
[59:47] manifestations of the Holy Ghost
[59:53] the inner invisible life is hidden in
[59:55] God and fed by the Lord's word Satan
[59:58] can't touch them not even death can
[1:00:00] touch that
[1:00:02] amen so it's very important that we have
[1:00:04] the original light that was lit
[1:00:08] not just another secondhand light
[1:00:14] you know we worried about secondhand
[1:00:16] smoke you need to be worried about
[1:00:17] secondhand light
[1:00:20] amen God don't have grandchildren
[1:00:24] you have to be born of the same light
[1:00:26] your mom and daddy were born up and if
[1:00:28] they weren't born of that light you
[1:00:30] still have to be born of that life
[1:00:32] amen listen we don't want secondhand
[1:00:35] light we want God's original light
[1:00:39] we don't want life that's passed down
[1:00:41] amen by traditions
[1:00:43] of something that's been passed down
[1:00:45] through ages and times that's not what
[1:00:47] we want it's just some tradition but we
[1:00:50] want the original light
[1:00:52] the original life the original Holy
[1:00:56] Ghost the original Power moving into
[1:00:59] Hearts moving in our lives moving to the
[1:01:01] homes moving in our churches
[1:01:06] Hallelujah we need to be at church
[1:01:08] that's on fire not with the laodicea and
[1:01:11] fire and smoke that's going to burn no
[1:01:13] sir that's not the fire we're looking
[1:01:15] for but the original fire that fell on
[1:01:17] the day of Pentecost is back again and
[1:01:20] it's moving and it's touching
[1:01:24] and I'll say God let it touch me
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:01:32] but we're also dealing with Strange Fire
[1:01:36] you know my uh Aaron's Aaron's two sons
[1:01:40] would come into the here they were
[1:01:42] called to be priests
[1:01:44] and they would come to do their duties
[1:01:47] and they would just bring their incense
[1:01:48] in
[1:01:49] and the Bible called said they offered
[1:01:52] Strange Fire before the Lord
[1:01:55] in other words it was a fire
[1:02:00] it was a fire that God had not lit
[1:02:05] amen they had to bring the same fire
[1:02:08] that God had lit
[1:02:10] not of their man-made ideas and then
[1:02:13] Petco quotes and how they want things to
[1:02:16] add up and how they want things to be no
[1:02:18] we want the fire of God
[1:02:22] amen we want the same fire that he lit
[1:02:32] and then went out of fire from the Lord
[1:02:33] and devoured them
[1:02:35] brother Brian will talk talk about it
[1:02:37] says these lamps they had it was their
[1:02:40] duty to take it in there but they had to
[1:02:42] be lit by the fire that God had lit
[1:02:46] Aaron's sons went in with some strange
[1:02:48] fire and God slew them in the door
[1:02:50] that's right Strange Fire he said if a
[1:02:54] man tried to go in the holy of holies if
[1:02:56] somebody started in the holy holies
[1:02:57] about coming through here he died
[1:02:58] Aaron's sons took Strange Fire one day
[1:03:01] he said some denominational fire
[1:03:06] amen when it wasn't and it said
[1:03:08] denominational fire and they died at the
[1:03:12] door they were were to take the same
[1:03:15] fire that God had lit and in not doing
[1:03:18] so it brought death
[1:03:21] amen we must be careful that we do not
[1:03:23] come with some to God with some man-made
[1:03:26] ideas or or man-made fire but we get the
[1:03:29] original fire that fell on the day of
[1:03:32] Pentecost
[1:03:33] amen man today is playing with fire and
[1:03:36] has broken into God's laboratory and has
[1:03:38] created his own fire and when it's going
[1:03:41] to bring death by nuclear destruction to
[1:03:44] Untold Millions
[1:03:46] of innocent people
[1:03:48] who has nothing to do with it
[1:03:52] and this is exactly what happens if a
[1:03:55] priest is not careful it does not bring
[1:03:58] what God the fire god lit
[1:04:01] but he brings a man-made idea or a
[1:04:04] man-made Creed
[1:04:06] or a man-made Dogma
[1:04:10] that's not what we want
[1:04:12] we want the original fire of God
[1:04:15] because that brings life
[1:04:22] but we know God dwells in fire
[1:04:26] go through scripture did we try to just
[1:04:29] go through this
[1:04:30] he called his people by fire
[1:04:34] that's what he did an angel the Lord
[1:04:35] appeared to Moses in a blazing fire
[1:04:38] in the midst of a bush he led his people
[1:04:42] by fire
[1:04:44] amen he led them with a cloud by day and
[1:04:47] then all night with a light of Fire
[1:04:51] amen David would say it like this he
[1:04:53] said he spread a cloud for recovering
[1:04:56] and a fire to Illuminate by night
[1:05:00] oh my amen that sounds like some people
[1:05:03] of this day amen that has the cloud in
[1:05:06] the fire
[1:05:09] it's showing the same God as in this
[1:05:11] Exodus once again it's not a calling out
[1:05:14] by man's decree amen it wasn't a man
[1:05:17] that called you to where you are today
[1:05:21] come on now there's not a man can put
[1:05:24] you where you are today
[1:05:26] amen we listen to some of y'all stories
[1:05:28] and how they man and how God
[1:05:30] orchestrated this and how he done this
[1:05:32] and how he moved this obstacle and how
[1:05:34] he done that listen that was not man
[1:05:36] that was the pillar of Fire
[1:05:40] and God is covering over his people amen
[1:05:44] he said he brought the cloud as a
[1:05:46] covering it would cover them during the
[1:05:48] hot days of the summer and walking
[1:05:50] through that desert and would keep those
[1:05:52] burning Rays off of them and would
[1:05:54] protect them amen and shield them
[1:05:58] to where their enemies couldn't even
[1:06:00] find them
[1:06:03] and then at night when they need to make
[1:06:05] a way and they didn't know where to go a
[1:06:07] light would appear and it would begin to
[1:06:09] burn and move and they would get behind
[1:06:11] that light and follow it wherever it
[1:06:13] went
[1:06:16] foreign
[1:06:22] he is described as fire
[1:06:26] in Exodus 15 it says you overthrow your
[1:06:28] adversaries by your great Majesty you
[1:06:32] Unleash Your burning Wrath
[1:06:35] it consumed them like stubble
[1:06:38] Exodus 24 says in the sight of the glory
[1:06:41] of the Lord was like a consuming fire on
[1:06:45] the Mountaintop
[1:06:48] foreign
[1:06:53] formal religion somehow
[1:06:56] not if you got the fire in it
[1:07:00] no no Deuteronomy 4 24 says for the Lord
[1:07:03] your God is a consuming fire
[1:07:07] a jealous God second Samuel 22 9 said
[1:07:10] smoke Rose from his nostrils and
[1:07:13] consuming fire came from his mouth
[1:07:15] glowing coals Blaze forth Psalms 97 3
[1:07:19] says fire goes before him and consumes
[1:07:22] his foes on every side
[1:07:26] Isaiah 33 14 says the Sinners and Zion
[1:07:30] are afraid trembling grips the ungodly
[1:07:33] who of us can dwell with a consuming
[1:07:35] fire who of us can dwell with
[1:07:37] Everlasting flames
[1:07:41] Daniel 7 says I beheld to the Thrones
[1:07:45] were cast down and the Ancients of days
[1:07:48] sit
[1:07:49] whose garment was white as snow and his
[1:07:52] hair on his head was like pure wool his
[1:07:55] throne was like the fiery Flame
[1:07:59] and his wills as burning fire
[1:08:06] but man
[1:08:09] we have the ability or the right to the
[1:08:12] original fire yet man wants to replicate
[1:08:15] the fire
[1:08:16] man wants to build their own fire
[1:08:20] man wants to decree how it should act
[1:08:23] and how big it should get and how how
[1:08:25] wide it should be how it should move to
[1:08:28] the church but God lit the church
[1:08:32] so if God LED his church with the
[1:08:35] original fire how are we supposed to
[1:08:37] tell him how his fire is supposed to act
[1:08:41] he's supposed to tell him how his word
[1:08:43] is supposed to move and to touch and who
[1:08:45] he's supposed to touch who he's not
[1:08:47] supposed to judge you how he's supposed
[1:08:49] to touch it and either they're getting
[1:08:51] out alive
[1:08:56] people like to build their fires in
[1:08:58] their own box
[1:09:03] some people are spiritual fire
[1:09:05] extinguishers
[1:09:07] brother Brown would call them wet
[1:09:09] blankets
[1:09:11] but their spiritual fire extinguishers
[1:09:14] see a little something happen and they
[1:09:16] want to sit down on and Camp down on it
[1:09:18] and say it ain't so
[1:09:22] if the church is going to move in power
[1:09:24] and demonstration it'll have to be the
[1:09:27] original fire
[1:09:29] or otherwise no matter the shouting the
[1:09:31] dancing the jumping the Sid or the
[1:09:33] sitting on your hands none of that
[1:09:35] matters not saying a word doesn't matter
[1:09:37] but if that original life
[1:09:41] is not there
[1:09:43] than that original fire is not there
[1:09:50] we need that original fire
[1:09:52] the Reynolds said like this he said
[1:09:54] Moses needed a touch
[1:09:57] I guess I'm just supposed to go slow
[1:09:58] tonight he tried to do it intellectually
[1:10:02] he tried to do it in his own power and
[1:10:05] he said that's what's the matter with
[1:10:07] the churches of our day we're trying to
[1:10:09] do it through schooling foreign
[1:10:12] we're trying to do it through
[1:10:14] denominations and we're trying to do it
[1:10:16] through education and we're trying to do
[1:10:18] it through Reformation
[1:10:21] but what the church needs is a new birth
[1:10:24] a baptism of the Holy Spirit the touch
[1:10:28] of the seventh sin the sixth sense that
[1:10:31] sets the soul on fire
[1:10:37] that touch will bring the sinner out of
[1:10:40] the root
[1:10:43] Hallelujah area that touch will bring
[1:10:46] him out of pornography that touch will
[1:10:49] bring him out of sin that church will
[1:10:52] bring her Amen to a life of overcoming
[1:10:54] power
[1:10:58] God needs to touch the church
[1:11:04] amen
[1:11:08] he said well I don't know
[1:11:10] well you know man was being ordained one
[1:11:13] day and the elders stand around said
[1:11:15] Lord
[1:11:16] wrap them up and Burl up sat burlap
[1:11:18] sacks pour kerosene on him and set him a
[1:11:21] fire for the gospel
[1:11:24] hey boy it sounds like some real
[1:11:27] praise the Lord religion
[1:11:30] wrap him up and burn up burlap sacks
[1:11:33] pour carousel on all seen on him and set
[1:11:36] him a fire for the gospel
[1:11:39] that's what we need today
[1:11:43] on fire turn him loose then and let him
[1:11:47] run
[1:11:50] he said it used to Brand cow calves and
[1:11:53] we'd take a calf
[1:11:55] so I know you roped and hogtied them
[1:11:57] anyone I guess he said we used to Brand
[1:11:59] them someone said aren't you ashamed to
[1:12:02] pack that hot iron and stick that on
[1:12:03] that poor little calf side
[1:12:06] aren't you ashamed of that brother Brown
[1:12:08] aren't you ashamed you know Peter and
[1:12:11] all them other people aren't you ashamed
[1:12:17] no
[1:12:21] that's pretty simple I like that they
[1:12:24] got to give you no reason no
[1:12:27] aren't you ashamed of the presence of
[1:12:30] God falling in the church
[1:12:34] aren't you ashamed when somebody gets a
[1:12:37] little drunk on the spirit and they got
[1:12:38] to be toted out
[1:12:40] aren't you ashamed amen when the tongue
[1:12:43] starts speaking and God starts
[1:12:45] prophesying
[1:12:47] no
[1:12:49] he said I stick that on his side oh
[1:12:51] he'll have a kicking fit he'll Squall
[1:12:54] he'll Bellow but when he's turned loose
[1:12:57] he has a spasm and he'll really run but
[1:13:00] he knew from then on
[1:13:02] who he belonged to
[1:13:06] Hallelujah he knows as long as he lives
[1:13:10] I belong to this one
[1:13:14] Hallelujah that's what happens to a true
[1:13:17] born-again Christian that when the fire
[1:13:19] god falls upon you there's never no
[1:13:22] doubt anymore
[1:13:24] I belong to
[1:13:26] I know who I am and who's my daddy
[1:13:34] Garner you your shame of those people
[1:13:37] down there acting like that no
[1:13:44] you may scream you may cry you may act
[1:13:46] funny but you'll know who you belong to
[1:13:49] from then on
[1:13:51] for you're sealed into the kingdom of
[1:13:53] God by the Holy Spirit
[1:13:54] it's the seal
[1:13:57] he said but God's goodness can come and
[1:14:00] it's become so common
[1:14:01] to we don't enjoy it like we used to
[1:14:06] if God can open our eyes and give us a
[1:14:08] desire to do something for him second
[1:14:10] night of Revival 150 people in the
[1:14:12] audience
[1:14:13] do you know I wonder what would happen
[1:14:15] if our eyes could see what our Lord did
[1:14:18] last night
[1:14:19] to see what he will do any night
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:25] each Christian Soul should be so zealous
[1:14:27] and so full of the fire of God his eyes
[1:14:31] open to see the coming of the Lord for
[1:14:33] these are the signs and Mild post of his
[1:14:36] soon appearance even science is
[1:14:38] declaring it
[1:14:40] moving the clock up 90 seconds to
[1:14:42] midnight
[1:14:45] and they're saying they're being
[1:14:46] optimistic
[1:14:50] we're closer than we ever been
[1:14:53] we see signs we see mild post of a soon
[1:14:57] appearing we see it in the Gentile world
[1:15:00] is just about to end we see all these
[1:15:02] things and we yawn and we Pat our mouths
[1:15:05] and we go to sleep and say why does he
[1:15:07] preach so long
[1:15:11] that's a direct quote 57 12 the door of
[1:15:15] the door
[1:15:18] and the Lord comes down and performs
[1:15:22] things as he said he would
[1:15:30] but it was Moses
[1:15:33] there was any trained man who could
[1:15:34] depend on intellect Moses would be the
[1:15:36] man
[1:15:38] had to degree degrees all over his wall
[1:15:40] of Egypt and how he led him in this
[1:15:42] battle in that battle and smartest man
[1:15:44] in Egypt
[1:15:47] went out to try to deliver his Brethren
[1:15:49] made a mistake fled
[1:15:52] and there he was on the backside of a
[1:15:54] desert for 40 years for God to beat some
[1:15:57] of that theology out of him
[1:15:59] to take the clay and beat it down until
[1:16:01] it was ready
[1:16:02] but one day this man was out there
[1:16:03] minding his own business for attendance
[1:16:05] of some sheep
[1:16:07] and he see that thing burning over there
[1:16:10] and he said it
[1:16:12] and he was 80 years old now
[1:16:16] and he learned more in the in the
[1:16:17] presence of that burning bush in five
[1:16:20] minutes
[1:16:22] then he learned in 80 years of school
[1:16:26] of Egypt
[1:16:29] sure when Moses lacked the bush had
[1:16:34] what the church lacks the bush has
[1:16:38] amen what you like the Holy Ghost has
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:43] you don't have to find Dr Dobson he
[1:16:45] ain't got it
[1:16:49] neither does any other psychologists
[1:16:51] they ain't got it but the Holy Ghost has
[1:16:53] got it you find him you'll find what you
[1:16:56] like
[1:16:58] foreign
[1:17:00] God
[1:17:02] he said what he said the Holy Ghost says
[1:17:04] God the same fire of God what the
[1:17:06] schools need is fire
[1:17:10] amen and what the schools need is fire
[1:17:13] Holy Ghost and Fire in the presence of
[1:17:16] fire he had an experience he was running
[1:17:19] from Egypt before the bush after the
[1:17:22] bush he's running to Egypt
[1:17:25] sometimes God can do things so
[1:17:27] ridiculous to the carnal mind could you
[1:17:29] imagine the next morning Moses tells his
[1:17:31] wife the poor that we're saddled up get
[1:17:33] the kid on each hip Moses with old dry
[1:17:36] stick Whiskers hanging down inside
[1:17:37] praising the Lord going down over the
[1:17:39] hills if that ain't a pitiful sight
[1:17:42] looking to buy the carnal mind somebody
[1:17:44] say Moses where are you going I'm going
[1:17:46] down to Egypt to take over a one-man
[1:17:48] Invasion but think of it the thing of it
[1:17:51] was he did it
[1:17:57] the thing of it was he did it he had had
[1:18:01] an experience he didn't care how many
[1:18:03] Egyptians he had slew first time he slew
[1:18:06] one and got in trouble Run next time he
[1:18:08] slew the whole Army
[1:18:12] he hadn't experience with god what the
[1:18:14] church needs tonight is not more
[1:18:17] schooling
[1:18:19] it needs an experience with God
[1:18:24] a fire spiritual Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:18:27] experience
[1:18:31] foreign
[1:18:37] service I was here but I've mentioned it
[1:18:39] again because I love this story
[1:18:41] Brandon had that experience with a fire
[1:18:47] found him a turtle
[1:18:50] thought man old Turtle walked up to him
[1:18:52] you know that Turtle does sucks up in
[1:18:54] his shell
[1:18:57] reminds me some turtles in church
[1:19:00] say something a little bit on there on
[1:19:03] their toes
[1:19:07] fire goes by their head
[1:19:12] preacher gets on them a little bit
[1:19:17] amen
[1:19:22] odd looking creature
[1:19:27] I just want you to understand
[1:19:30] if you're a turtle in church in a Holy
[1:19:33] Ghost and Fire Church you're an odd
[1:19:34] looking creature
[1:19:37] when the power of God's Fallen the
[1:19:39] people rejoice and you're sitting over
[1:19:40] in your little shell you're an odd
[1:19:42] looking creature
[1:19:44] that's just a little extra
[1:19:49] as soon as you got up to him he pulls
[1:19:51] himself back in that shell closes up
[1:19:53] read your duet direct quote puts me in
[1:19:56] mind of a whole lot of so-called
[1:19:58] Christians as soon as you mentioned
[1:20:00] Divine Healing or you mentioned the Holy
[1:20:01] Ghost oh no we don't believe in that
[1:20:06] well we wanted to see him move
[1:20:09] and he said I want to see the church
[1:20:11] move too
[1:20:14] amen but it couldn't move till you get
[1:20:16] his legs working and if the church won't
[1:20:20] move to the whole body goes to work
[1:20:22] I said just a minute brother I'll make a
[1:20:24] move went and got me a switch poured it
[1:20:26] on to him didn't do no good you can beat
[1:20:28] it beat him you can beat them and beat
[1:20:29] him or you whip more the tighter they
[1:20:31] get how can I make a move I found me a
[1:20:34] water some water and I put him in the
[1:20:35] water and I held him down until just a
[1:20:37] few bubbles come up he said I know you
[1:20:39] had all kind of baptisms sprinkling porn
[1:20:41] made denomination of what happens go
[1:20:43] down and drive Center come up a wetland
[1:20:46] doesn't do any good you can beat it into
[1:20:49] them you can't beat it into them nor you
[1:20:51] could Nate nor can you baptize it into
[1:20:53] them
[1:20:56] you know what I did
[1:20:58] I got me some sticks
[1:21:00] and a little piece of paper
[1:21:03] and I made a fire and I set that old boy
[1:21:06] on top of it
[1:21:08] I just put this in your mind
[1:21:10] this is pretty hilarious I know Peter
[1:21:13] wouldn't like this story but I like it
[1:21:15] amen who
[1:21:19] get you some sticks build your fire and
[1:21:22] put that turtle on top of it and I made
[1:21:25] that fire then and boy did he begin to
[1:21:28] move
[1:21:30] if there's anything that'll move the
[1:21:32] Church of God is the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:36] Ghost fallen again
[1:21:43] not some new theology not some new way
[1:21:47] to baptize but just let the Holy Ghost
[1:21:49] fall in the church the fire the light of
[1:21:52] God the trouble of his you took the fire
[1:21:54] off the altar
[1:21:57] and it was a god-led fire
[1:22:02] William Branham didn't like this fire
[1:22:07] I'll get to that in a minute
[1:22:10] is a gauntlet fire
[1:22:14] the trouble of it is you took the fire
[1:22:16] off the altar it needs to be on the
[1:22:19] altar it needs to be in every heart
[1:22:21] again an old-fashioned Saint Paul's
[1:22:24] Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost is way
[1:22:26] Awakening powers of God what the church
[1:22:29] needs tonight is not a weapon not a
[1:22:31] theology
[1:22:35] but the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:37] Fire that's what's going to make the
[1:22:39] church move set the church on fire with
[1:22:41] the gospel set the fire of God down on
[1:22:43] them through the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:22:45] how to make a move praise God forever
[1:22:47] that's what it takes to make the church
[1:22:49] move under the blood the blood brings
[1:22:51] the fire the sacrifice was offered by
[1:22:54] fire the blood on the fire begins to
[1:22:56] make smoke and the smoke goes up as a
[1:22:59] sweet smelling Savior and it went to the
[1:23:01] Savior himself
[1:23:03] foreign
[1:23:08] we need fire
[1:23:11] we need fire to leave here
[1:23:15] just as an astronaut we need fire to
[1:23:18] leave this atmosphere to go into another
[1:23:20] one the Bride of Jesus Christ has to
[1:23:22] have fire to leave here
[1:23:26] you can have the beautiful rocket you
[1:23:29] can have the all the beautiful engine
[1:23:30] and you can polish it and you can make
[1:23:33] it look all good but if they ain't fire
[1:23:36] it ain't going nowhere
[1:23:39] amen that's what he would say in
[1:23:42] countdown he said there's an entrance
[1:23:43] there's a place a way of Escape
[1:23:46] and he said there's a countdown that's
[1:23:48] going on but there has to be fire there
[1:23:51] has to be fire there has to be the power
[1:23:53] to make it rise
[1:23:56] the same power they received on the day
[1:23:58] of Pentecost the same way it has been
[1:24:01] all the time the same one because it's
[1:24:03] the same door how do we get in this body
[1:24:05] by the same door Jesus is the door to
[1:24:07] the body now the door is just about to
[1:24:10] close and Leo to see it just last
[1:24:11] countdown and the church is fixing to
[1:24:14] take its orbit above all tribulations
[1:24:16] above all the destruction
[1:24:19] above all the things that are going on
[1:24:21] here in the earth and is about to rise
[1:24:24] into another atmosphere
[1:24:30] is that morning when John Glenn took off
[1:24:32] everybody was on their faces crying and
[1:24:34] praying wonder if he's ever going to be
[1:24:36] able to achieve what he set out to
[1:24:37] achieve first thing you know fire begins
[1:24:40] to spread from them Adams is that great
[1:24:42] big missile lifted off there at Cape
[1:24:44] Canaveral going up in the air like that
[1:24:46] people screaming and crying and
[1:24:47] wondering what happened to their
[1:24:49] astronaut that was going up but old
[1:24:51] church Glory she's spreading some fire
[1:24:54] too
[1:24:55] the church is spreading some fire to the
[1:24:58] countdown's on justification
[1:25:00] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:03] layout of sin that church age where at
[1:25:05] the end Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:25:07] today and forever what's the matter ten
[1:25:10] nine eight seven six five four three two
[1:25:13] one zero
[1:25:17] there won't be no crime but they'll be
[1:25:20] seeing and shouting and praising God as
[1:25:23] the church takes his astronaut moving to
[1:25:26] the skies by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:29] [Applause]
[1:25:36] foreign
[1:25:38] he said in a natural achievement they've
[1:25:40] taken off to the moon but in a spiritual
[1:25:42] achievement we've taken off towards
[1:25:44] heaven
[1:25:45] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is lifting her
[1:25:48] up above the moon stars right Beyond
[1:25:50] everything could ever be achieved by man
[1:25:51] the church will take your flight into
[1:25:53] the bosoms of God one of these morning
[1:25:56] friends a man has been able to achieve
[1:25:58] what they have by their natural things
[1:26:00] but God is achieving even more by the
[1:26:03] supernatural
[1:26:06] Hallelujah
[1:26:09] but the church needs tonight
[1:26:11] it needs the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:26:14] to get the church moving for the kingdom
[1:26:16] of God it'll walk then
[1:26:18] a Revival

[1:26:23] sink down the fifth rib on the left side
[1:26:25] till it anchors in the bottom of the

[1:26:37] you what we need is that fire it puts an
[1:26:40] energy in there
[1:26:42] it puts an energy in there listen if you
[1:26:45] get the fire of God in your services
[1:26:47] it'll put an energy in there
[1:26:57] the children of Israel one time
[1:27:01] halting between two opinions
[1:27:04] there was some that was worshiping Baal
[1:27:07] and there were some that was worshiping
[1:27:09] God it got to the point that Elijah
[1:27:11] thought it was only him but God told him
[1:27:13] said no I've got seven seven thousand I
[1:27:16] believe it was Souls that has not been
[1:27:19] in the knee
[1:27:22] hey man I'm glad that seventh one was in
[1:27:24] there
[1:27:26] Elijah came to him and said why halt he
[1:27:29] called him to Mount Carmel I've been
[1:27:30] able to stand on that mountain
[1:27:33] said how why how long are you going to
[1:27:35] Halt between two opinions
[1:27:37] if the Lord be God follow him
[1:27:40] but if they'll be God follow him
[1:27:43] and the people answered not not a word
[1:27:45] and Elijah said unto the people I even I
[1:27:48] only remain a prophet of the Lord but
[1:27:49] Bell's Prophet are 450 Men Let Them
[1:27:53] therefore give us two Bullocks let them
[1:27:55] choose one bullet for themselves and cut
[1:27:57] in pieces and lay it on wood and put no
[1:27:59] fire under it
[1:28:02] and I will dress the other Bullock and
[1:28:05] lay it on wood and put no fire under it
[1:28:09] so we're going to both play on a Level
[1:28:11] Playing Field
[1:28:14] and you call the name of your God and
[1:28:17] I'll call on the name of the Lord and
[1:28:19] the god that answers by fire
[1:28:24] he has scripture for this the god that
[1:28:27] answers by fire
[1:28:30] let him be God
[1:28:34] and all the people answered said it's
[1:28:36] well spoken we know the story as they
[1:28:38] begin to build their Altar and they
[1:28:40] begin to cry aloud and they and they
[1:28:42] begin to dance and holler and brothers
[1:28:44] said they were sincere
[1:28:47] they wouldn't make believe and they were
[1:28:49] sincere enough to cut themselves
[1:28:52] they they were looking for something to
[1:28:54] happen
[1:28:55] but they were serving a dead God a dead
[1:28:59] Creed a dead letter
[1:29:03] a theology
[1:29:06] foreign
[1:29:08] of God
[1:29:10] looked down after them and called even
[1:29:12] to noon and he
[1:29:15] and there was no voice to answer they
[1:29:17] began to leap
[1:29:19] Elijah looked at him and mocked him
[1:29:22] he said well cry louder
[1:29:25] either he's talking
[1:29:27] or he's pursuing or he's on a journey
[1:29:31] maybe he's sleeping
[1:29:34] and must be awakened
[1:29:36] that scripture I'm reading it right out
[1:29:39] must be awakened
[1:29:42] and they cried louder and they cut
[1:29:44] themselves more
[1:29:47] until the blood gushed out of them
[1:29:52] but it came time to the evening
[1:29:55] sacrifice
[1:29:58] and they will have neither voice nor had
[1:30:01] any answer and they had no answer to
[1:30:04] what was going on they couldn't say what
[1:30:05] was happening
[1:30:07] Elijah said okay that's enough
[1:30:10] he said he called the people said come
[1:30:12] here and the people came here and he
[1:30:14] repaired the altar of the Lord
[1:30:18] he brought everything back into his
[1:30:21] position
[1:30:24] he put the 12 Stones back in their place
[1:30:28] hey amen he put amen the godhead back in
[1:30:32] his place
[1:30:33] he put serpent seed back in his place he
[1:30:36] put the baptism back in his place
[1:30:39] he put all the Lost truths down through
[1:30:41] the Dark Ages back in their place
[1:30:44] [Applause]
[1:30:47] and he said I want you to understand
[1:30:49] this ain't rigged bring me water
[1:30:52] bring me one and put what bring me water
[1:30:55] and they pour buckets of water until it
[1:30:57] soaked the trench or soaked Altar and
[1:31:00] filled the trench that was around the
[1:31:02] altar
[1:31:06] when he had put it all in order
[1:31:08] they brought fill four barrels of water
[1:31:11] and poured on the burnt sacrifice
[1:31:13] do it a second time so there's eight
[1:31:16] barrels
[1:31:18] and the water ran about the Altar and it
[1:31:20] filled the trench and there came time
[1:31:23] Pat came to pass at the time of the
[1:31:26] offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:31:30] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:31:38] God doesn't make mistakes Church
[1:31:41] he puts things in there as types and
[1:31:43] he's showing his people in that day but
[1:31:46] in his mind he's looking to a people in
[1:31:47] the last day
[1:31:51] and he's like gonna be a lot of people
[1:31:52] with theologies and dead gods and
[1:31:54] historical gods and historical ideas but
[1:31:57] I'm here to tell you there is one true
[1:31:59] Living God
[1:32:01] amen and he began to stop and he said oh
[1:32:04] Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let
[1:32:08] him be known this day that thou art God
[1:32:10] in Israel and I am thy servant and that
[1:32:14] I have done all these things at Thy Word
[1:32:18] so apparently Elijah had Visions as well
[1:32:21] after Thy word Hear Me O Lord hear me
[1:32:24] that this people may know that thou art
[1:32:26] the Lord God and thou has turned what
[1:32:30] turn their heart back again
[1:32:36] do you see yourself on Mount Carmel
[1:32:39] it turned their heart back again so
[1:32:42] they'll know it has nothing to do with
[1:32:44] me
[1:32:46] they'll know it's not the seventh grade
[1:32:48] the educated Prophet it's not me but
[1:32:52] it's you oh God
[1:32:54] it's nothing that I conjured up it's
[1:32:57] nothing that's my own doing it's not my
[1:32:59] intellectual abilities
[1:33:01] but I've done at Thy Word
[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:06] and the fire of God fell
[1:33:12] and consume the burn sacrifice and the
[1:33:15] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:33:17] licked up the water that was in the
[1:33:19] trench and when all the people saw it
[1:33:21] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:33:23] the Lord he is God the Lord he is God
[1:33:30] I say in this age Let The God Who
[1:33:32] Answers by fire let him be God
[1:33:40] because let me tell you he does some
[1:33:43] wonderful things with this fire he
[1:33:45] destroys your enemy with this fire he
[1:33:47] makes a way with this fire he shows you
[1:33:49] the way with his fire

[1:33:56] be God
[1:33:58] and let his word be true
