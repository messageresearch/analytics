[17:50] [Music]
[17:52] he's been with us through many difficult
[17:55] times
[17:56] we went through a lot of different dark
[17:58] valleys
[18:00] down through 220 2020
[18:04] we we've had
[18:06] a lot of new different
[18:07] obstacles and things to overcome
[18:11] we're here tonight
[18:13] gathered again when we had to cancel
[18:15] services last year and
[18:17] but now god has permitted us one more
[18:20] time
[18:21] we don't ever know but what this could
[18:23] be our last time
[18:25] so we want to put everything we have
[18:27] into every service
[18:29] get everything we can out of each
[18:31] service
[18:33] brother branham said in perfect faith he
[18:35] said then trying to get the church
[18:38] into a place where we could really see
[18:41] apostolic times moving among us
[18:44] that's what we all hunger
[18:46] and it's just laying right at the door
[18:49] now if he could say that that many years
[18:51] ago
[18:52] where are we at now
[18:54] amen we should be right into the very
[18:58] presence where things are happening
[19:01] he said we see it but we want to see
[19:03] more of it

[19:07] help to us
[19:08] and us flow out to others
[19:11] amen
[19:13] so may god stir up that faith in our
[19:15] hearts tonight
[19:17] now in order for there to be healing
[19:19] delivered salvation it's got to be
[19:22] preached amen
[19:25] faith comes by hearing
[19:27] the word of god
[19:29] so we are here tonight to hear god's
[19:31] word
[19:32] let it produce a faith in our hearts
[19:35] but then release that faith and see that
[19:38] faith go to work on the behalf of god's
[19:40] children
[19:42] amen
[19:43] it's the hour and the time for the
[19:45] dynamics to come to the mechanics

[19:50] a car that would run down the road to
[19:52] healing to delivers to salvation

[56:49] to luke chapter 4
[56:51] and verse 23 this evening
[56:58] i'd like to speak to you this afternoon
[57:00] on living
[57:02] a secret life
[57:07] living a secret life
[57:13] sometimes we
[57:15] sermons come on our hearts and they're
[57:16] there for weeks and we think that
[57:19] we'd like to go a different direction
[57:22] but we have a boss that knows exactly
[57:24] what the need of in this building is
[57:28] and though this be simple i believe
[57:29] he'll get right to our point this
[57:31] afternoon
[57:33] luke chapter 4 and verse 23
[57:36] and he said unto them
[57:39] ye will surely say unto me this proverb
[57:42] physician
[57:44] heal thyself
[57:46] and whatsoever we have heard done in
[57:49] capernaum
[57:51] do also here in thy country
[57:54] and he said verily i say unto you
[57:57] no prophet is accepted in his own
[57:59] country
[58:00] but i tell you of a truth that many
[58:03] widows
[58:04] were in israel in the days of elias
[58:07] when the heaven was shut up three years
[58:10] and six months
[58:12] when great famine was throughout all the
[58:14] land
[58:15] but un but un
[58:18] unto none of them
[58:20] was elias sent
[58:22] save the serapha
[58:24] a city of sidon
[58:27] unto a woman
[58:28] that was a widow
[58:31] and many lepers were in israel in the
[58:33] time of elias
[58:35] the prophet
[58:37] and none of them was clean cleansed
[58:41] saved
[58:42] naaman
[58:43] the syrian
[58:46] second kings chapter 5 and verse 1.
[58:51] now naaman the captain of the host of
[58:53] the king of syria
[58:56] was a great man
[58:58] and with his master and honorable
[59:02] because by him
[59:04] the lord had given deliverance
[59:08] unto syria
[59:09] incredible words right there
[59:12] even also a mighty man in valor
[59:17] but he
[59:19] was a leper
[59:21] you may be seated
[59:28] we're struggling and even hearing today
[59:30] of people that are passing from
[59:32] covid
[59:33] it's a fearful thing it's a
[59:36] terrifying thing when it comes into your
[59:38] home
[59:40] not too bad when it was in china but now
[59:42] it's here
[59:49] it always it's always personal when it
[59:50] gets to your house
[59:55] it's a very dreadful thing
[59:59] but it's literally nothing compared to
[1:00:00] leprosy
[1:00:03] leprosy was one of the most dreaded
[1:00:04] diseases that there was in the land
[1:00:08] leprosy was
[1:00:09] a disease to which it was a flesh-eating
[1:00:12] disease bones would deteriorate
[1:00:16] literally limbs would fall off
[1:00:19] rot stink
[1:00:21] and it would pass from one to another
[1:00:24] to to have leprosy would send you in
[1:00:26] exile to a to even a different island or
[1:00:30] a different country
[1:00:32] it would definitely separate you from
[1:00:34] your family
[1:00:36] and you would have to openly scream
[1:00:38] unclean unclean
[1:00:41] and it was a very difficult disease
[1:00:43] nobody had an answer for it
[1:00:46] many in the land had leprosy
[1:00:49] so it would be a horrible thing when it
[1:00:51] visited your home and become a part of
[1:00:55] your family
[1:00:56] it would it would cause many many great
[1:00:59] separations
[1:01:01] we find a man here that we begin to
[1:01:03] speak about even jesus talks of him
[1:01:06] this man was an incredibly great man
[1:01:09] he was a man that was used by god
[1:01:12] to fulfill actual prophecy
[1:01:16] to which the which they would go and and
[1:01:18] deliver
[1:01:19] syria
[1:01:21] this man was a not a foot soldier but he
[1:01:24] was the captain of the host
[1:01:26] he would be one of the highest officers
[1:01:30] in any king's castle or any inner circle
[1:01:34] he would be one of the men that would
[1:01:36] set at the most important tables
[1:01:38] he would be there to where that
[1:01:40] they would converse back and forward of
[1:01:43] the safety of the nation
[1:01:45] of of putting military men in certain
[1:01:48] spots
[1:01:49] he would be a man of great importance
[1:01:53] incredible importance
[1:01:55] but even in the mind of god this would
[1:01:57] be a man that god would use
[1:01:59] to fulfill elijah's prophecy
[1:02:06] even of ahab being perish
[1:02:09] so this man would
[1:02:10] would have great importance in the mind
[1:02:12] of god
[1:02:15] it would be unfathomable
[1:02:18] for a man in this position
[1:02:22] to tell his friends i have leprosy
[1:02:29] he will live a very secret life
[1:02:32] leprosy writes his own flesh
[1:02:53] i'm fine with this anyway
[1:02:56] yeah okay
[1:02:58] always enjoyed lollipops when i was a
[1:03:00] little boy
[1:03:02] if i get to the center of this one
[1:03:04] tonight we've done something
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:16] were we at
[1:03:19] this man had to keep this a secret
[1:03:23] leprosy is much like sin
[1:03:29] you didn't think i was gonna stay four
[1:03:30] or five thousand years ago did you
[1:03:33] leprosy's much like a sin it will cause
[1:03:35] you to live a secret life
[1:03:41] even in the message
[1:03:45] without the seal of the holy ghost on
[1:03:47] your life
[1:03:48] you're a target of the devil
[1:03:51] to bring in habits and situations in the
[1:03:54] home
[1:03:56] things on your phone things on your ipad
[1:03:58] things on your computer
[1:04:01] little habits that consume you
[1:04:05] and an enemy that comes along with it
[1:04:07] that is always there
[1:04:10] and maybe even allow you to go to church
[1:04:12] but he always reminds you
[1:04:16] now you know in the public eye
[1:04:18] naaman would wear his armor
[1:04:21] and he would look the part
[1:04:24] no doubt on the under that armor he
[1:04:27] would wrap himself
[1:04:30] with such a wrap until the smell
[1:04:32] wouldn't get out
[1:04:35] and he would wrap himself to where that
[1:04:37] the ooze wouldn't come out
[1:04:40] can you imagine how uncomfortable it was
[1:04:44] that he would wear such an attire
[1:04:47] and live such a and he knew
[1:04:50] but he couldn't let his even closest
[1:04:52] friends know
[1:04:54] i want you to follow
[1:04:56] his closest friends could not know or he
[1:05:00] would be exiled
[1:05:02] thinking i'll lose it all
[1:05:06] i'll lose it all if anybody else knows
[1:05:10] i lose my standing i lose my position he
[1:05:13] enjoyed where he was at
[1:05:16] speaking with king speaking with
[1:05:18] generals
[1:05:19] speaking with great and listen when he
[1:05:21] walked down the street he was a
[1:05:23] celebrity
[1:05:25] he would what we would call a national
[1:05:27] hero
[1:05:32] but he had a secret
[1:05:36] champion
[1:05:38] of champions
[1:05:40] but he had a secret
[1:05:42] day after day he would go home
[1:05:45] you know
[1:05:46] and then and his home
[1:05:48] the secret was known
[1:05:53] and he would take his armor off
[1:05:56] lay his armor down
[1:05:58] and he would begin to unwrap
[1:06:00] today with new oozes
[1:06:04] and knew breaking out
[1:06:06] cleaning up the stink
[1:06:10] his family would know
[1:06:13] but they dare because they didn't want
[1:06:15] to lose their standing either did not
[1:06:17] dare tell the secret that was consumed
[1:06:19] in this home
[1:06:24] and they would watch him and how he
[1:06:25] would suffer but yet everybody was
[1:06:28] propping up
[1:06:30] everybody was propping up the law
[1:06:37] hmm
[1:06:38] now remember
[1:06:41] he couldn't tell
[1:06:43] it was a secret
[1:06:45] but at home he could relax
[1:06:48] and at home he was in his atmosphere
[1:06:53] when he was at battle and he and he went
[1:06:55] into israel
[1:06:57] they would they would gather treasures
[1:07:00] to bring home
[1:07:02] an interesting thing was that he brought
[1:07:05] a girl
[1:07:07] a young woman to help his wife
[1:07:10] in the home
[1:07:12] and he brought her there
[1:07:15] and he brought her to his home to be a
[1:07:16] slave
[1:07:18] brother branham reminds us that though
[1:07:20] we are aliens
[1:07:22] from another country
[1:07:26] we are to conduct ourself in a certain
[1:07:28] way
[1:07:29] [Applause]
[1:07:32] now now let me just let me just let this
[1:07:35] be a real basis tonight let me just say
[1:07:37] this to you naaman was not the most
[1:07:40] powerful person in the home
[1:07:46] naaman though he be a the
[1:07:48] captain of the host
[1:07:50] a general of generals
[1:07:52] a national hero
[1:07:55] sitting at the most inner circle of all
[1:07:58] of the camp
[1:07:59] of the highest order of all the land
[1:08:02] in his own home he wasn't the most
[1:08:04] powerful person there
[1:08:07] it wasn't his wife it was that slave
[1:08:11] girl
[1:08:12] because she believed a message
[1:08:19] and that message was a message of
[1:08:22] deliverance
[1:08:24] it was a message that had power to it
[1:08:27] it was a message that there's a power of
[1:08:29] a god in our land
[1:08:31] we have a
[1:08:36] prophet and though she be not in her own
[1:08:40] home
[1:08:41] not with her own family
[1:08:44] not with her own friends
[1:08:46] though she be a slave
[1:08:49] she conducted herself as a believer
[1:08:53] regardless of her conditions
[1:09:00] you may be under all kind of
[1:09:01] circumstances in your life
[1:09:03] and think that your world is completely
[1:09:06] upside down and there's nobody with you
[1:09:08] to support you
[1:09:09] god's always with you
[1:09:13] god's always got your pots
[1:09:20] now this girl
[1:09:22] would watch naaman
[1:09:26] naaman was the individual that took her
[1:09:28] captive
[1:09:31] naaman was the one that
[1:09:33] had brought her to this place
[1:09:36] no doubt this house
[1:09:38] was a much nicer house than she lived in
[1:09:42] but it wasn't home
[1:09:44] no doubt he treated her good
[1:09:47] but it wasn't her family
[1:09:49] no doubt there were many friends and
[1:09:51] other workers that were in the home
[1:09:54] but they wasn't her friends
[1:09:59] but this little girl operating in this
[1:10:01] room
[1:10:03] she had power to get him delivered
[1:10:12] but would she
[1:10:18] sometimes we become slaves to different
[1:10:21] things
[1:10:24] and things come into our lives
[1:10:27] will we allow it to
[1:10:29] cause dominion over our home
[1:10:33] over our life
[1:10:35] will we allow it to take us out of
[1:10:37] church
[1:10:39] will we allow it to separate us from
[1:10:41] fellowship with god
[1:10:43] or will we operate in our god-given
[1:10:46] rights
[1:10:47] [Applause]
[1:10:48] regardless of the conditions
[1:10:53] she must have power to forgive him
[1:10:58] she must have power to forgive him for
[1:11:01] taking her captive
[1:11:03] she must realize that it is her purpose
[1:11:05] in life to get that man that has
[1:11:08] fulfilled the prophecy of the word of
[1:11:10] god to get that man deliverance
[1:11:14] [Applause]
[1:11:24] willy believer
[1:11:29] will he trust her
[1:11:35] now let's just think about it just for a
[1:11:36] little bit
[1:11:38] first of all
[1:11:40] naaman's got to come to a spot in his
[1:11:42] life
[1:11:44] to where he would do anything
[1:11:47] to get rid of this
[1:11:56] send a lay in your life and become your
[1:11:58] slave master
[1:12:02] and it'll lay there in war with you
[1:12:05] until you get sick and tired
[1:12:09] of being enslaved
[1:12:12] come on church
[1:12:16] let me just say this to you i struggle
[1:12:18] and i war with cancer but it does not
[1:12:21] have dominion over me
[1:12:27] i do not worship the disease that is
[1:12:30] fighting for my life
[1:12:32] you do not have to worship the disease
[1:12:35] that is trying to destroy you
[1:12:38] because god is greater than every
[1:12:40] disease that there is
[1:12:57] maybe little habits
[1:13:00] that creep into your life
[1:13:02] and you think nobody knows
[1:13:07] situations
[1:13:09] tempa maybe the dna pool pulled a lot of
[1:13:12] things down in your life
[1:13:14] and there's jealousies in your family
[1:13:17] and in your home
[1:13:19] listen they stink
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:24] you go to church with people and you
[1:13:26] don't want them to know but your family
[1:13:28] knows
[1:13:31] little habits that you have in your life
[1:13:34] you know
[1:13:35] your family knows
[1:13:37] you would love to be rid of those things
[1:13:41] [Applause]
[1:13:44] and you got an enemy in your ear
[1:13:45] constantly
[1:13:54] you know sometimes sin has to the point
[1:13:56] to little convince a man he's it's doing
[1:13:58] right
[1:14:02] and he he finds himself in one situation
[1:14:04] after another situation
[1:14:06] and then he finds that
[1:14:08] i can't go back or what if people find
[1:14:10] me out i lose my standing i'll lose my
[1:14:12] situation i'm preaching to you
[1:14:14] [Applause]
[1:14:16] i'll be exiled from the church i'll be
[1:14:18] gone they put me off on an island
[1:14:23] but don't realize if they could really
[1:14:25] get to the altar where god wants them to
[1:14:27] get
[1:14:30] they could get cleansed of that thing
[1:14:34] and it won't be their enemy no more
[1:14:37] but it'll be a reminder of a war that
[1:14:40] they pass fault and it's over with
[1:14:47] how many warriors that we have sitting
[1:14:49] throughout the building tonight
[1:14:51] and you have fought through different
[1:14:53] things in your life
[1:14:55] the power of forgiveness to forgive
[1:14:58] yourself
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:03] the power over condemnation
[1:15:10] doubt promises i'll never go back to
[1:15:11] that pornographic site again
[1:15:19] promises no doubt to never take a sip of
[1:15:21] that again
[1:15:25] not let lust rule in my life
[1:15:28] temper
[1:15:32] you just go ahead and put whatever there
[1:15:36] you let the discerning of the word just
[1:15:38] come to where you're at now
[1:15:41] let me just say this to you in a sermon
[1:15:43] like this this is not to down you this
[1:15:45] is lift you up
[1:15:49] don't let the devil whisper in your ear
[1:15:51] now that preacher's after you i'm here
[1:15:53] to help you
[1:15:56] i'm here to bring you deliverance you
[1:15:58] don't have to stay there
[1:16:02] i'm like a little girl we've got a
[1:16:04] prophet in the land we got an angel
[1:16:07] that's among us
[1:16:09] we've got a perfect message that'll come
[1:16:11] to deliver you
[1:16:22] no doubt there was a many a day even at
[1:16:24] war in that hot suit
[1:16:27] only dreaming
[1:16:30] that i could get rid of this
[1:16:33] dreaming
[1:16:35] haunted at night
[1:16:37] itching oozing stinking
[1:16:40] rotting
[1:16:42] checking
[1:16:44] am i sealed up good enough to go out in
[1:16:46] public
[1:16:49] sitting in a room
[1:16:51] and many others around him and
[1:16:53] checking himself to make sure that
[1:16:55] nobody else smells the stink
[1:16:59] am i coming home
[1:17:12] no doubt he cried tears
[1:17:15] he had fulfilled prophecies
[1:17:23] is there any deliverance for me
[1:17:27] no doubt there was times that he thought
[1:17:29] well
[1:17:30] you know i'll just give it up i'm gonna
[1:17:31] i gotta go to the doctor to get some
[1:17:33] help
[1:17:34] but if that doctor would
[1:17:42] tell i could find some medicine
[1:17:46] that would help me
[1:17:47] i'd give it all
[1:17:57] this little girl overcome
[1:17:59] her bitterness
[1:18:03] she overcome her captivities
[1:18:06] and she realized who she was
[1:18:12] that's who you are
[1:18:13] she realized who she was
[1:18:18] she decided now today
[1:18:21] i know he could kill me
[1:18:24] but i got to talk to him
[1:18:26] i got to have a conversation with him
[1:18:30] somewhere in that conversation i've got
[1:18:32] to convey
[1:18:35] that i don't hate him
[1:18:37] but i love him
[1:18:42] maybe brother branham would do that
[1:18:44] standing in the prayer line
[1:18:46] put his foot up the side of a man or
[1:18:48] measure to see if his
[1:18:50] suit would fit their suit
[1:18:53] and was trying to find compassion for
[1:18:56] them
[1:18:59] and no doubt there was many things that
[1:19:01] he told people that didn't make them
[1:19:02] happy
[1:19:05] but it brought them deliverance
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:08] when nathan talked to david
[1:19:11] it wasn't a judgment of law
[1:19:14] but it was grace to him
[1:19:17] let me just say this message is grace to
[1:19:20] us
[1:19:22] it set us free
[1:19:24] it's not law to us it's love to
[1:19:27] to jesus christ
[1:19:30] it's more than brother branham it's more
[1:19:32] than your favorite preacher it's god
[1:19:35] himself
[1:19:36] that is here in the room
[1:19:38] to bring you personal deliverance
[1:19:41] [Applause]
[1:19:45] this this little girl begins to speak to
[1:19:48] him
[1:19:49] now naaman
[1:19:51] yes
[1:19:53] name and i
[1:19:56] i know you've got leprosy
[1:20:01] but
[1:20:02] name i know where there's some help for
[1:20:05] you
[1:20:09] i know where there's some help for you
[1:20:12] i i know you you don't have no help here
[1:20:16] but where i come from
[1:20:20] there's a prophet over there
[1:20:27] jesus even reminds us
[1:20:30] no other leper had ever been healed
[1:20:35] but this little girl's revelation
[1:20:39] was beyond
[1:20:42] the impossible
[1:20:44] it had never happened before
[1:20:47] but her testimony was if you can get to
[1:20:49] the prophet
[1:20:56] i want to say this to you if you can get
[1:20:58] to jesus
[1:21:00] if you can make your way to where jesus
[1:21:03] is at
[1:21:04] he'll heal you
[1:21:06] he'll deliver you
[1:21:16] maybe she was even afraid to look in his
[1:21:18] eyes
[1:21:19] if you could get to him
[1:21:23] no
[1:21:24] he first of all
[1:21:26] had to catch the revelation for himself
[1:21:29] i gotta go
[1:21:33] now let me just say
[1:21:34] they were enemies those two nations were
[1:21:41] so naaman does what a lot of people do
[1:21:44] i'm going to work it out for myself
[1:21:48] to where i can get to it
[1:21:51] because i work i walk in certain circles
[1:21:54] i'm going to use my circle
[1:22:02] so it won't look so bad
[1:22:07] now i want you to understand now he's
[1:22:09] got to convince a king
[1:22:12] don't throw me away
[1:22:14] i have leprosy
[1:22:17] it's an incredible deliverance for you
[1:22:19] when you admit
[1:22:21] [Applause]
[1:22:25] because who he was
[1:22:30] allowed him enough grace will you send a
[1:22:33] letter
[1:22:34] to the king of israel
[1:22:37] that i want to come see the prophet
[1:22:40] that i would get deliverance
[1:22:43] the king of israel becomes wrath
[1:22:48] he looks at it as a fight
[1:22:51] this is a man that has come and
[1:22:53] destroyed our kingdom
[1:22:57] he don't look at him as a man that has
[1:22:59] become a national hero and fulfill the
[1:23:01] prophecy
[1:23:02] he looks at this man as he is going to
[1:23:05] insurrect a fight
[1:23:07] he's going to bring leprosy to my
[1:23:10] kingdom
[1:23:14] because under the influence
[1:23:17] of a lot of powerful people they bring
[1:23:20] sin into your life
[1:23:21] [Applause]
[1:23:27] because sin is kind of transferable
[1:23:31] you just entertain a spirit a little
[1:23:33] while and before long you got it
[1:23:35] [Applause]
[1:23:39] you just entertained the wrong thing in
[1:23:41] your home a little while and before long
[1:23:43] something else is ruling your home
[1:23:48] the king has to make a decision and i'm
[1:23:50] going to let this man come
[1:23:54] and bring leprosy to my kingdom
[1:24:05] you can imagine his situation
[1:24:09] you can imagine
[1:24:10] the difficulty
[1:24:12] of what it would be like
[1:24:14] to have to make a decision come on
[1:24:19] the prophet hears about it
[1:24:23] he sends word
[1:24:25] let him come on
[1:24:29] let him come on
[1:24:31] well naaman
[1:24:33] being who he is and as powerful he is as
[1:24:35] rich as he is
[1:24:37] thinks he can buy it
[1:24:42] god don't need your money
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:48] it doesn't bother about what your last
[1:24:50] name is
[1:24:56] naaman loads up all of the animals and
[1:24:58] they begin to make a journey
[1:25:01] you know no doubt he had great
[1:25:02] expectations when he got to the
[1:25:04] prophet's house
[1:25:06] he was used to lining and dining with
[1:25:08] some of the greatest
[1:25:10] he was used to being the red carpet
[1:25:12] treatment
[1:25:14] but getting a new birth
[1:25:17] is you got to be ready to go to a pigpen
[1:25:21] you got to be willing to die out to
[1:25:23] yourself
[1:25:25] you got to be willing to die out to
[1:25:27] everything and lay it down and say
[1:25:30] tonight i'll never go back ever again
[1:25:37] naaman comes to this position he and all
[1:25:40] of his servants that were with him his
[1:25:42] men that were carrying his arm and all
[1:25:44] of these things you can imagine the
[1:25:46] parade that comes to the prophet's house
[1:25:49] and the prophet didn't even go out to
[1:25:51] see
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:25:59] i can imagine
[1:26:00] i can imagine like a lot of people well
[1:26:02] the pastor didn't even call me back
[1:26:09] he didn't even cannot shake my hand
[1:26:12] he didn't even give me a great dinner
[1:26:15] here
[1:26:16] he sent his servant out
[1:26:23] he just sent one of the boys out to give
[1:26:26] me a message
[1:26:30] don't he know who i am
[1:26:32] don't he know who my last name is
[1:26:35] let me just say naaman was still
[1:26:37] stinking as bad as it ever stunk
[1:26:42] and being who he was did not impress the
[1:26:44] prophet of god none whatsoever
[1:26:48] being a captain didn't impress elijah
[1:26:52] being set in a greater inner circle did
[1:26:54] not impress us
[1:26:56] but he had prayed
[1:26:58] [Applause]
[1:26:59] he had got ready and he had an answer
[1:27:03] this message has the answer that you
[1:27:06] need
[1:27:13] you don't have to go to 42 different
[1:27:15] preachers to try to figure out what you
[1:27:17] need in your life
[1:27:25] well i didn't get the answer i'm looking
[1:27:26] for here so i'm going there i'm going
[1:27:28] there i'm going to listen moving will
[1:27:30] never change your problem you've got to
[1:27:33] die out to yourself
[1:27:45] you gotta die
[1:27:47] you gotta die to your problem
[1:27:50] it'll only get worse if you just keep it
[1:27:52] up
[1:27:53] but so many times we want our way
[1:27:59] and her own stubborn will
[1:28:03] david had the same problem with his
[1:28:05] brothers
[1:28:08] david was going to be the king
[1:28:11] but his brothers were taller
[1:28:14] handsome
[1:28:15] better warriors
[1:28:17] they made fun of him they intimidated
[1:28:20] him but i don't read anywhere where any
[1:28:22] of those went and fought goliath
[1:28:27] [Applause]
[1:28:30] so they had a family secret
[1:28:33] they was jealous of one another
[1:28:35] [Applause]
[1:28:40] come on church so many times we can't
[1:28:43] recognize the pastor because he's our
[1:28:45] younger brother
[1:28:52] we can't recognize so and so in their
[1:28:54] great gift cause we're older
[1:28:57] we've got more ability
[1:28:59] but god's using them
[1:29:02] you see you got a family secret
[1:29:05] and what you need to do is go to the
[1:29:07] prophet's word and get washed
[1:29:10] [Applause]
[1:29:15] and the servant came out and told him
[1:29:17] said
[1:29:19] go to jordan
[1:29:25] and go dip in jordan seven times
[1:29:30] jordan was muddy
[1:29:34] jordan was nasty
[1:29:37] jordan stock
[1:29:43] and being he was a warrior and knew the
[1:29:45] country well
[1:29:46] he picked
[1:29:48] two different bodies of water that would
[1:29:50] suit him better
[1:29:56] that'd be wonderful instructions but
[1:29:58] i'll go dip here i'll go to that church
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:06] i'll go to that place
[1:30:10] that preacher ain't hard
[1:30:14] that preacher let me get by
[1:30:17] but if you go there you'll still stink
[1:30:28] if you go where you want to go you'll
[1:30:30] still be rotten
[1:30:33] if you choose your own religion you will
[1:30:35] still stink and have to go into exile
[1:30:39] but if you go to the word where the word
[1:30:42] tells you to go
[1:31:00] you see to get a miracle you got a wash
[1:31:06] so many times we want deep mysteries
[1:31:08] when we really haven't got a bath
[1:31:12] we want to understand
[1:31:15] all the deep seals
[1:31:18] we want to understand all the great
[1:31:20] things that put it together
[1:31:23] but really we don't have a birth
[1:31:30] and when
[1:31:32] we get crossed up
[1:31:33] all the sudden under pressure
[1:31:36] we expose
[1:31:37] our leprosy
[1:31:42] and so many times we bypass
[1:31:45] the new birth
[1:31:48] kind of like satan making an offer to
[1:31:51] jesus i'll give you the kingdom of the
[1:31:53] world
[1:31:54] i'll give you everyone
[1:31:58] and jesus says this is written it is
[1:32:01] written it is written
[1:32:06] many times we know the truth
[1:32:09] but we want to work our own will
[1:32:15] listen it's in everybody's dna to want
[1:32:17] an easier way
[1:32:25] brother branham didn't mind being a
[1:32:26] prophet
[1:32:28] if he could be a trapper
[1:32:34] because he loved the woods and he loved
[1:32:35] hunting he hated the pressure
[1:32:39] he actually even made up in his mind i'm
[1:32:41] going to go up into canada i'm going to
[1:32:43] maybe buy a little store i'm going to
[1:32:44] i'm going to be a guide up there
[1:32:48] and when god speaks to me i'll come down
[1:32:49] and i'll preach that saith the lord
[1:32:54] he wrestled with his own human will
[1:32:57] don't tell me you don't wrestle with
[1:32:58] your own human will
[1:33:00] [Applause]
[1:33:02] i wrestle because of this sermon's got
[1:33:04] to be delivered
[1:33:10] but i learned a long time ago are you
[1:33:12] with me now
[1:33:14] that the one that is keeping the cancer
[1:33:16] away
[1:33:20] he's after you
[1:33:22] [Applause]
[1:33:25] and listen
[1:33:26] he's got the prescription to take care
[1:33:28] of you
[1:33:30] [Applause]
[1:33:32] our world is battling
[1:33:35] over inoculations
[1:33:38] some force some against will it work
[1:33:41] won't it work
[1:33:42] is there going to be side effects
[1:33:45] don't get cold now
[1:33:50] we're wrestling with it it's i want the
[1:33:53] best shot i want this i i i want that i
[1:33:55] don't want this i i i got to have this
[1:34:02] wow i get the right spot there didn't i
[1:34:06] it's the same thing with the word
[1:34:09] it has an inoculation that goes with it
[1:34:13] and we've got 40 some thousand
[1:34:15] denominations that think they got the
[1:34:17] right shot
[1:34:20] but i want to tell you i'm a from a
[1:34:22] citizen of another kingdom
[1:34:24] and god sent us a prophet
[1:34:27] it's not even negotiable
[1:34:32] it don't matter to me that you don't
[1:34:34] want it
[1:34:53] now let me tell you how it worked on me
[1:34:57] i didn't get a fever the next morning
[1:35:02] i didn't get the shakes
[1:35:04] i didn't get hives
[1:35:07] i didn't get a headache
[1:35:11] but i was an addict the night before
[1:35:16] oh you thought i was talking about
[1:35:18] coping
[1:35:21] but i was an addict the night before but
[1:35:23] when i got the inoculation
[1:35:39] you see i walked into church like maybe
[1:35:41] some of you walked into church tonight
[1:35:43] and i was stinking
[1:35:46] i was i was under a suit but i was
[1:35:49] stinking
[1:35:50] i was afraid because i was a preacher's
[1:35:53] son i was afraid that others would smell
[1:35:55] me
[1:35:57] but i hadn't been in church in a long
[1:35:59] time but it didn't matter that my name
[1:36:00] was spencer
[1:36:02] i
[1:36:02] had leprosy
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:16] naaman looked at his soldiers and he
[1:36:18] said can you believe this
[1:36:22] i've got the king convinced that i can
[1:36:24] come to the prophet
[1:36:27] and i finally got here
[1:36:30] and he tells me to go to jordan
[1:36:37] how can i being who i am go to jordan
[1:36:44] the scriptures bears out that
[1:36:47] those
[1:36:48] men had more revelation than naaman did
[1:36:55] the man gave you an inoculation and told
[1:36:57] you you could be well
[1:37:01] why don't you just do what he said
[1:37:15] well brother but brother ron i'm afraid
[1:37:16] i'll slobber and i'm afraid i'll cry
[1:37:25] listen maybe your children will watch
[1:37:27] you daddy and mama walk to an altar and
[1:37:30] finally get rid of your leprosy
[1:37:34] then that leprosy won't rule your home
[1:37:36] no more
[1:37:39] i pray in this meeting tonight that
[1:37:42] there'll be a refilling of the holy
[1:37:44] ghost
[1:37:45] in people's lives where they be
[1:37:47] recharged by the dynamics of the holy
[1:37:50] ghost
[1:38:02] should not be ashamed of the new birth
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:06] we should not be ashamed to worship
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:13] we should not be ashamed of the prophet
[1:38:15] of this hour
[1:38:17] we should not be ashamed of the fivefold
[1:38:19] ministry that god has sent us
[1:38:22] in this day
[1:38:23] to cleanse the church
[1:38:26] to wash you and keep you clean
[1:38:28] [Applause]
[1:38:31] whether you know it or not god has
[1:38:32] anointed the greatest ministry in the
[1:38:34] world to come and preach to you
[1:38:37] not what you want to hear
[1:38:41] but what you need to hear
[1:38:50] forgive me anybody can push play
[1:38:54] when they know what's on that tape won't
[1:38:56] bother what's in here
[1:39:05] sometimes the longest walk you will ever
[1:39:07] make is not on a treadmill
[1:39:09] it's to an altar
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:15] listen it don't matter how long you've
[1:39:17] been in church
[1:39:18] you need to be
[1:39:20] [Applause]
[1:39:24] washed we're not careful i don't want to
[1:39:27] offend nobody here
[1:39:29] because i'm getting in this group
[1:39:34] sometimes in nursing homes they have to
[1:39:36] beg the patients to take a bath
[1:39:41] i knew you'd get quiet
[1:39:46] and i've had too many in the church that
[1:39:47] told me he said brother ron
[1:39:49] i just took a bath last week
[1:39:51] i haven't done anything
[1:39:55] but i feel like that sometimes in church
[1:40:02] just come take a bath
[1:40:09] just come take a bath
[1:40:11] it'll make you feel better
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:19] it'll clean your hair up
[1:40:23] gotta give you a perfume to make you
[1:40:25] smell better
[1:40:28] he'll sweeten your spirit to where you
[1:40:30] can get along at home
[1:40:36] care won't be hard to do
[1:40:40] but you need to get a bath
[1:40:42] [Applause]
[1:40:48] donnie they may give you another service
[1:40:58] i imagine as he stood there looking at
[1:40:59] jordan
[1:41:09] well this is what he said
[1:41:15] this is what he
[1:41:16] said it'll take care of my music
[1:41:22] it's going to take care of my movies
[1:41:26] it's going to take care of all that
[1:41:27] nonsense in my life
[1:41:33] if i could see myself on the other end
[1:41:35] of this miracle
[1:41:37] i'm going to have skin like a baby
[1:41:41] but on the way in he could smell itself
[1:42:07] he walks down in that muddy
[1:42:10] stinking water
[1:42:15] and he remembers those little girls
[1:42:17] words
[1:42:19] you can be healed
[1:42:23] and it's been a long journey to get here
[1:42:26] but i'm here
[1:42:29] i don't know how many miles you took you
[1:42:30] to get here
[1:42:32] but you're here
[1:42:34] you may as well dip
[1:42:48] i don't know who i'm preaching to but
[1:42:49] i'm i'm well aware that i'm preaching to
[1:42:52] somebody here tonight
[1:42:53] don't go home the same way
[1:42:58] don't go home the same way don't don't
