journey i bet we are getting closer [Music] [Music] my so [Music] and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that the whole world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenis was the governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone in his own city [Music] and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth and to judea into the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be tasked with mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered [Music] and she brought first forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swallowing clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the flock keeping watch over there by night and oh the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were so afraid [Music] and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david which is christ the lord and shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with an angel and multitude of the heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory to god in the highest on earth peace good will towards men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us not go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger [Music] [Music] look lord jesus [Music] lord jesus [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] i am a very busy man why have you bothered the great king
