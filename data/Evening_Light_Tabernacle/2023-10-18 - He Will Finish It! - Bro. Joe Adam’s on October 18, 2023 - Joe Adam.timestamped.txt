[40:49] we would come as a people Lord I know
[40:51] many of us our hearts may be heavy
[40:53] tonight but God may you just take the
[40:55] words and break the bread of life Lord
[40:57] and on our ears to hear what the spirit
[40:59] would have said in this hour for this
[41:01] service for this moment Lord we ask it
[41:03] now in Jesus name amen if you have your
[41:05] Bibles tonight we have you look here in
[41:08] Philippians 1 and verse
[41:10] 6 we're also going to look in Hebrews 12
[41:12] and verse2 for our our two places of
[41:15] scripture reading tonight we find here
[41:18] in Philippians 1 and verse6 it says
[41:19] being confident of this very thing that
[41:23] he which began a good work in you will
[41:26] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[41:29] so notice
[41:31] he he which began a good work in you
[41:34] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[41:38] Christ also Hebrews 12 and verse2
[41:40] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[41:43] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[41:46] that was set before him he endured the
[41:48] cross despising the shame and he sat
[41:50] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[41:52] God God bless you Saints you can have
[41:54] your seats tonight
[41:57] I want to speak to you tonight as I was
[41:59] sitting here Sunday and taking in the
[42:02] great message that brother Tim had
[42:03] preached on on the crossing over and
[42:05] believe that we are people that has
[42:07] crossed over I believe we got to come
[42:08] out of this time element that we're in
[42:11] understanding that we live in it day by
[42:12] day but I think this is we got to look
[42:14] beyond the the natural the humanity and
[42:16] look into a land that flows with milk
[42:18] and honey and I was as I was thinking
[42:21] there and just listening to it the Lord
[42:22] just kind of dropped this in my heart he
[42:24] said he will finish it so I want to
[42:27] speak to you tonight on he will finish
[42:29] it and we find here this word finisher
[42:32] in Hebrews 12 and verse2 it means he
[42:34] will he's the completer he's the
[42:37] perfector so this is who God is this is
[42:40] one of his attributes is he is a
[42:42] completer he is a perfector he's not
[42:44] like you and I who could start a job
[42:46] only to stop halfway God doesn't stop
[42:49] halfway if God ever starts something
[42:51] God's going to see it all the way
[42:53] through to completion and we find here
[42:56] that you as sons of God and and myself
[42:58] we as Believers tonight we can be
[43:01] confident of this very thing that he
[43:03] which began the good work he that
[43:06] started this good work in you will
[43:10] perform it otherwise he will
[43:13] completed so this good work is a work
[43:15] that only God does it's not anything to
[43:17] do with man this is called the work of
[43:19] God the work of the Lord or the work at
[43:21] Christ and Paul is affirming here that
[43:24] man has nothing to do with this work
[43:26] this is solely on God and God's merits
[43:30] and God's claim and God's uh God's uh
[43:33] purpose for your life man has nothing to
[43:36] do with it we find in John 1 and verse2
[43:39] but as many that have received him
[43:41] notice to them gave them or he gave them
[43:45] the power to become the sons of God
[43:47] nothing that we had to do nothing that
[43:49] your favorite preacher had to do nothing
[43:52] that a service had to do with it but God
[43:54] Almighty because he knew there would be
[43:57] Sons and Daughters of God that would
[43:59] come to this truth so God started the
[44:01] work and God provided you the avenue to
[44:04] which you can become yet a son and
[44:06] daughter of
[44:07] god notice he says now even to them
[44:11] which believe on his name which were
[44:13] born not of blood nor of the will of
[44:15] Flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[44:18] all this is because
[44:23] God so we find here we can be confident
[44:27] that's right even in our lowest days our
[44:30] lowest weakest moments Even in our most
[44:33] frail uh uh humanity and our sickest
[44:36] elements in life notice the times of
[44:38] Despair when we lose a loved one we can
[44:41] still be confident of this very thing
[44:44] that he that began the good work and let
[44:47] me tell you it's a good work Church some
[44:50] of you look back over your life and see
[44:52] where you were and see where you are now
[44:54] it's a good work matter of fact it's a
[44:56] great work and not man could do this
[44:58] work man doesn't have the longevity to
[45:01] perform this but almighty God does God
[45:04] started it God will finish it yes sir
[45:07] notice now we can be confident that God
[45:10] began the work notice where did he begin
[45:12] it in the thoughts in his thoughts you
[45:16] know brother Jackson you got good
[45:18] thoughts but tomorrow your thoughts can
[45:20] change but if God ever had a thought
[45:22] about you it's a perfect thought it's an
[45:24] eternal thought it's lasting thought
[45:27] it's a thought not only in your
[45:28] beginning in your origin but God's
[45:30] already saw that thought to completion I
[45:33] say oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[45:35] tonight some of you are facing some
[45:37] difficult moments in life but I want you
[45:39] to know God has already seen the
[45:40] finished product God has already seen
[45:43] you in Victory God has already said I am
[45:45] going to finish it I started it I'll see
[45:48] it to completion am he desired notice
[45:51] God desired to have fellowship with you
[45:54] amen come on church this should have
[45:57] been a better amen than
[45:58] that God desired to have fellowship with
[46:01] you he knew what age to bring you in he
[46:05] knew what family to allow you to be born
[46:06] into he washed over that seed he knew
[46:10] what church to place you
[46:12] in cuz a certain atmosphere can Quicken
[46:15] that sea and bring the full development
[46:17] of what God has
[46:19] intended see if God was so careful to
[46:21] bring you in this age into the
[46:24] prospective family which you were born
[46:26] in a family that believes the message
[46:28] place you in the right church with the
[46:30] right atmosphere I ask you won't he
[46:32] finish what he started if he thought so
[46:36] much and wased over that seed all the
[46:38] way down through world wars through
[46:40] fires and calamities God has always
[46:42] watched over that sea he began it not
[46:45] when you came to the Earth not when you
[46:47] came to the altar not when you were born
[46:49] again but God started that in his very
[46:52] thoughts that he had of you before you
[46:54] ever came here right notice and the
[46:57] Bible tells us that the work now that he
[46:59] started he's going to complete this word
[47:02] work there means something which he
[47:04] undertakes it can be done by the
[47:07] accomplishment of his hands or the
[47:10] industry or his mind right right so God
[47:13] started in his mind God was not God but
[47:16] before yet he made the angels and when
[47:19] he made the angels and they worshiped
[47:20] him then he became God but God wanted
[47:23] somebody that would love him somebody
[47:26] that will reciprocate that same love
[47:28] that he has for his creation therefore
[47:30] God thought of you come on even tonight
[47:34] wake up tonight God thought of you why
[47:37] cuz you're the only one that can
[47:38] reciprocate the love of
[47:41] God oh my he said he will perform it
[47:46] that word there performing to bring to
[47:48] an end to finish to complete to perfect
[47:52] you look in the mirror every morning and
[47:54] you see a lot of flaws at least I do oh
[47:57] but when I look through godm when he
[47:59] looks at me he's not looking at my frail
[48:01] Humanity he's not looking at my
[48:03] weaknesses he's not looking at me in my
[48:05] difficulties no God is looking at me at
[48:07] the very thought that he have and as
[48:09] your Prophet said he took a picture you
[48:11] at your
[48:12] best come on even the light he took a
[48:15] picture of you at your best you didn't
[48:17] remember that but God does because you
[48:20] was in his thoughts and what he saw
[48:23] there he's going to manifest here amen
[48:26] notice he will perform He will carry it
[48:29] forward to completion he will perfect it
[48:33] yes sir that's right it will be carried
[48:37] through to the end so when did this work
[48:39] begin you find the answer in the Easter
[48:41] seal he said there's only one life one
[48:44] eternal spirit one eternal life and
[48:46] that's God God Alone is eternal and then
[48:50] we being his children are part of him
[48:52] that is the attributes of his thinking
[48:55] and the thought is expressed and becomes
[48:57] a word then each individual
[49:00] here come on are you here tonight amen
[49:03] let your mouth know it let your head
[49:05] know it let your body know it I'm here
[49:07] we're here he says we're here tonight
[49:09] that possesses eternal life was before
[49:12] the foundation of the world in God's
[49:16] thinking so all of you here tonight that
[49:19] was that are here and I'm assuming you
[49:20] are that you possess eternal life you
[49:23] was in God thinking before the
[49:25] foundation of the world he said it's the
[49:28] only way it could be cuz you're an
[49:30] attribute so you are an attribute of God
[49:35] that's right you and all your
[49:40] issues all your family strains all that
[49:44] that God mixed into that and made you
[49:46] who you are yet God said that's my
[49:50] attribute and yet all we can see is all
[49:52] the issues but God don't see issues God
[49:55] sees
[49:56] Perfection because God's not looking at
[49:59] the in between he's looking at the
[50:00] beginning Alpha is going to be Omega and
[50:03] Omega is going to be Alpha they're going
[50:05] to be the same church and notice what he
[50:07] says now we become Sons and Daughters of
[50:10] God through that same Spirit by the same
[50:13] forn knowledge of God we are an
[50:15] attribute of God that's an expression of
[50:17] a thought and has become a word and the
[50:19] word has to take in life and it's
[50:23] Eternal oh Church yes it means that what
[50:27] he started out with Genesis he will
[50:29] finish in Revelation
[50:32] am not that oh I'm going to have stars
[50:35] and I'm going to have moons and I'm
[50:36] going to have mountains and I'm going to
[50:37] have beaches and I'm going to have this
[50:39] age and that age no God had a lot more
[50:41] going on in the beginning amen God had a
[50:44] desire an overwhelming desire what was
[50:48] God doing God had a desire to have a
[50:51] family I know I preached on this but I'm
[50:53] going to keep preaching on until God
[50:54] gets it off my heart but God had a
[50:56] desire to have a family you know I told
[50:58] my wife when I got married I was
[51:00] predestinated to be married I didn't
[51:02] like to be
[51:04] alone come on oh man I got one two
[51:08] brothers got their hand raised up come
[51:09] on Church man I hated being alone oh but
[51:12] I'm going tell you I was meant to be
[51:14] married and God hates to be alone God
[51:17] didn't want to just dwell with his
[51:18] thoughts God wanted those thoughts to
[51:20] come into manifestation he wanted
[51:22] somebody that he could love and more
[51:25] important he wanted somebody that would
[51:27] love him
[51:29] back so you were in God's thinking when
[51:32] God was Desiring a
[51:35] family see he was expressing this great
[51:38] desire to have a bride and God when he
[51:40] had those thoughts he had you in his
[51:43] mind that's right you were part of that
[51:46] before you was ever born before you ever
[51:48] had that first trial that first sickness
[51:52] that first heartache over a loss of a
[51:53] love him before you ever felt lonely
[51:55] being rejected and dejected God had you
[51:58] in his thinking where did he what did he
[52:01] say to job job where were
[52:04] you you know job had a lot of calamities
[52:06] in life job's lost his health he lost
[52:08] his wealth he lost his children his wife
[52:11] someone you just cursed God and die and
[52:12] yet God said Joe where were you before
[52:15] all this took place before you was ever
[52:17] born he was reminding job job you was on
[52:20] the other side with the sons of God
[52:22] shouting and rejoicing God didn't see
[52:25] job's difficulties he didn't see job go
[52:28] down in defeat no but God saw job
[52:30] rejoicing over his calamities God saw Jo
[52:34] rejoicing in Victory because he didn't
[52:36] let these things P him down because he
[52:38] knew that oh blessed be the L of the
[52:40] Lord though the skin worms destroy this
[52:42] body yet in this place I'm going to see
[52:45] my Creator I'm going to see the one that
[52:47] had me in this thought before the
[52:48] foundation of the world see God and God
[52:52] doesn't see your defeat church he sees
[52:54] your VCT Victory yes sir amen he sees
[52:58] your Victory that's right the Bible
[53:00] would tell us in 2 Thessalonians 2 and
[53:03] verse 13 that God ha from the beginning
[53:06] chosen you to Salvation through
[53:08] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[53:11] of the truth where unto he called you by
[53:15] Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory
[53:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ so we were
[53:20] chosen not from our birth that's right
[53:23] we were chosen not when we accept Christ
[53:25] as our savior we were chosen not when we
[53:28] came to the altar at a special meeting
[53:31] but we were chosen from the
[53:36] beginning he would tell us in Ephesians
[53:39] that we are chosen where in him that's
[53:42] right oh Church never forget these
[53:44] fundamentals because when you're flat on
[53:46] your back and the devil's Waring you
[53:48] need to realize where you came from you
[53:50] need to realize that God has
[53:51] jurisdiction over your life not the
[53:53] devil you didn't come from the devil you
[53:56] came from God you came from the Eternal
[53:58] thoughts of God and if those thoughts
[54:00] are Eternal and you were yet there and
[54:02] now you possess the holy spirit that
[54:04] means that God's going to see what he
[54:06] started way back then all the way
[54:08] through and you will be here when there
[54:10] is no tomorrow you will be here when
[54:13] there is no more devil you will be here
[54:14] when there is no more cancer no more
[54:16] heart trouble no more diabetes you will
[54:19] still be here why because you came from
[54:22] almighty God and God is here today to
[54:25] tell you even like Tabernacle I will
[54:28] finish it I will finish what I started
[54:31] don't be distracted by what's going on
[54:33] in the political system in the Nations
[54:35] around us don't be afraid of what you
[54:37] see I God put you here I will see you
[54:41] through we were chosen in him before the
[54:45] foundation of the world that we should
[54:47] be holy Without Blame before him in love
[54:50] having made known unto us notice he made
[54:53] known unto us not not everybody but unto
[54:56] us that's right the mystery of his
[55:00] will according to the good pleasure
[55:02] which he had purposed in himself now in
[55:05] the church
[55:06] age I love what brother Braham says
[55:08] there he says herein now is set forth
[55:11] the love of God anybody want to know
[55:13] this are y'all ready to me just close
[55:15] and go on home and we had
[55:17] Church see he Des notice he said he
[55:20] desired in love a family of his own yeah
[55:24] a family Sons Sons like
[55:27] himself see there before him lies all of
[55:31] mankind as one lump of clay and out of
[55:34] that same lump he will now make vessels
[55:37] unto honor and unto dishonor the
[55:39] choosing will be his own
[55:43] choosing then those chosen ones born of
[55:46] his spirit will be trained to conform to
[55:49] the
[55:50] image in where in their walks so they're
[55:52] going to be they're going to be trained
[55:54] to conform in the image of their walk
[55:56] and if you go into Christ The Mystery of
[55:57] God revealed we understand that in the
[55:59] back part of God's mind I love how
[56:02] brother Wayne brought this out the other
[56:04] night or the other day when he was
[56:05] talking about uh uh our brother Matthew
[56:08] Spencer and how he was born and at what
[56:11] time he knew what time he knew this he
[56:12] knew his weight he knew all these things
[56:14] but yet he doesn't have any recollection
[56:16] the only way that he remembered only way
[56:18] that he knows is because it was sat in
[56:20] the memory of his mother and what am I
[56:22] telling you tonight you may not remember
[56:24] your origin you may not remember these
[56:26] things but in the mind of God God
[56:28] remembers it and therefore God is coming
[56:30] to tell you I'm going to finish it this
[56:33] is what I'm thinking of you're not some
[56:35] cast down little nobody just barely
[56:38] getting by you are the Queen of Heaven
[56:40] you almighty God is in love with you
[56:43] tonight and he's just looking for you to
[56:45] love him back look beyond your fears
[56:47] look beyond your diffic difficulty and
[56:49] look to the author and the finisher of
[56:51] our faith tonight he's the one
[56:55] so in his great mind he wanted these
[56:57] attributes to be expressed in him was
[57:00] love in him was to be a father in him
[57:02] was to be a son in him was to be a
[57:04] savior in him was to be a Healer all
[57:07] these great attributes that we see
[57:09] already expressed they were in
[57:12] god notice God had a purpose and a
[57:16] hidden
[57:18] Mystery and he says and that's what I
[57:20] want to speak on in this church is his
[57:22] hidden Mystery of God that he had in his
[57:24] mind before the the world ever began and
[57:26] how that it's unfolded itself right down
[57:29] to this present hour that we're living
[57:31] in I don't think we had to cut this off
[57:33] and say that only applied to 1963 but I
[57:36] believe we can bring that down today
[57:38] church that God is still unfolding that
[57:41] hidden Mystery and it's a revelation to
[57:43] those that will receive the revelation
[57:45] of it notice God's great mystery of how
[57:49] it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody
[57:51] know nothing about it even the angels
[57:53] didn't understand it and the reason
[57:55] there was silence in heaven for a space
[57:58] of a half hour and the Seven Thunders
[58:00] utter their voices and John was
[58:01] forbidden to write it see it's the
[58:03] coming of the Lord so this great mystery
[58:06] this great mystery secret was his coming
[58:09] but not in Groom form this secret was
[58:12] his coming in Bride
[58:14] form see it's him coming now manifesting
[58:18] your life him living and manifesting in
[58:21] the sons of God bringing forth the
[58:23] attributes that all all things that God
[58:25] had wanted ever since the foundation of
[58:27] the world he had typed it in the Bible
[58:30] he had typed Abraham and a Sarah that
[58:32] somebody's going to have a body change
[58:34] and go back to youth again he typed at
[58:36] church he typed it all the way down
[58:38] through with Boaz and Ruth he's going to
[58:40] take a gentile bride he typed it in
[58:42] Joseph taking a gentile bride he typed
[58:44] it in salon and Rahab there why and
[58:47] Rahab was found in the lineage of God
[58:49] cuz some of us we've been ungodly some
[58:51] of us have prostituted our time but God
[58:54] ain't looking at today God is looking at
[58:56] what he had in his mind and he said I'm
[58:58] going to finish it I'm going to finish
[59:00] what I started you was in my thinking
[59:02] I'm going to bring it down into the
[59:03] manifestation in Leia I'm going to call
[59:06] out a
[59:08] bride excuse my excitement but this
[59:10] Thrills me
[59:12] amen notice now he has showed it or
[59:15] revealed it in every type that's in the
[59:18] Bible therefore the entire Bible is the
[59:21] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[59:23] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[59:26] goal right woo one goal God ain't
[59:30] flirting around with denominational
[59:32] Believers he's got one go I want a wife
[59:35] oh my there's men they go all over this
[59:37] country looking for them a good wife
[59:39] some of them came here we had to kick

[59:44] Brothers him we got good women I mean
[59:46] good sisters excuse
[59:48] me sorry about that we got we got a high
[59:52] standard not just anybody and God's
[59:54] looking looking he's looking for
[59:56] somebody that's going to match be a

[1:00:01] of his character life of his life is she
[1:00:04] suitable to be my wife to be my bride
[1:00:08] cuz he St he's he's looking for those
[1:00:11] thoughts being made
[1:00:12] manifest notice we find everywhere in
[1:00:15] the scriptures it's always been about
[1:00:17] Christ and a

[1:00:55] love
[1:00:56] him that's your purpose is to love God
[1:01:01] do you realize nobody can love him like
[1:01:03] you that's right and nobody can love you
[1:01:06] like him that's right it's a match made
[1:01:09] in
[1:01:11] heaven sir did you hear what I said it's
[1:01:13] a match made in heaven and let me tell
[1:01:16] you when I proposed to my wife and I
[1:01:18] flew to Hawaii and I arranged it all me
[1:01:20] and sister Rachel from the airplane this
[1:01:22] is what I want this is the time I want
[1:01:24] it I want to do this I had party
[1:01:26] pre-arranged everything all I had to do
[1:01:29] was wait till she got there oh
[1:01:31] Hallelujah if you understand what I'm
[1:01:33] talking about right now God has been
[1:01:35] waiting he's made all the arrangement
[1:01:37] he's going to finish it he's just
[1:01:39] looking for his wife to get there to get
[1:01:41] in position and let me tell you brother
[1:01:43] when she got in position I stepped out
[1:01:46] oh there's just a moment of time when
[1:01:48] you get in that Godly position that God
[1:01:50] ordained you to be in he's going to step
[1:01:52] out from the round parts of glory and
[1:01:54] come down and snatch away his bride and
[1:01:56] take her to a wedding supper of the Lamb
[1:01:59] he's going to finish this work Church
[1:02:02] he's made you a proposal he ain't
[1:02:04] backing off of it he's steadfast and TR
[1:02:07] he's going to go through with this
[1:02:09] marriage but you got to get yourself
[1:02:13] ready you got to allow yourself to get
[1:02:16] ready he said he would take out a
[1:02:19] gentile for his name's
[1:02:22] sake notice when the Jews rejected it
[1:02:26] the Gentiles received it which was a
[1:02:28] type of the Bride so he would call out a
[1:02:32] people out of the Gentiles for his name
[1:02:35] and let me just say this Satan is doing
[1:02:37] everything he can to uous
[1:02:42] Union Satan is doing everything he can
[1:02:46] to keep this marriage from
[1:02:49] happening to keep the bride from uniting
[1:02:51] with the groom to get the bride to fall
[1:02:53] out of love with with him and to fall
[1:02:55] into love with all these other things
[1:02:57] right all these vices and oh now you can
[1:03:00] really be free and no longer held in
[1:03:03] bondage by all these laws of dos and
[1:03:05] don'ts but I want you to know Church
[1:03:07] Satan doesn't have enough power to stop
[1:03:09] what God already set in
[1:03:12] motion he doesn't have enough power he
[1:03:14] doesn't have enough imps he does have
[1:03:16] enough devils in hell that can stop what
[1:03:18] God already set in Motion in the
[1:03:20] beginning right when God thought of you
[1:03:24] yes
[1:03:24] those starts are going to come to
[1:03:27] completion so God so loved you that even
[1:03:29] when Satan marred Eden's Perfection and
[1:03:33] he was casting out his son and his
[1:03:35] daughter he said hold up a second and he
[1:03:38] brother Brown would tell us those
[1:03:40] four-letter word L begin to fall down
[1:03:43] and the blood slapping bloody sheep skin
[1:03:46] slapping against His Garment as they
[1:03:48] were walking out but he said hold up I
[1:03:51] will put imity between thy seed and the
[1:03:53] seed of the ser serpent what was he
[1:03:55] saying he said there is going to come a
[1:03:57] savior God was saying this is not the
[1:04:00] end of it I'm going to finish this I'm
[1:04:03] going to provide you a savior and his
[1:04:05] heel will bruise his head and his head
[1:04:08] will bruise his heel what was God saying
[1:04:10] God said this ain't over this ain't the
[1:04:13] finality of it I'm still on the throne
[1:04:15] I'm still going to see this work all the
[1:04:17] way through I will have a bride and I'm
[1:04:19] going to take her back to another Eden
[1:04:22] and this time let me tell you Church in
[1:04:24] Satan's eating he's calling out a
[1:04:25] Perfect Bride oh Hallelujah somebody
[1:04:29] should say Amen to that in all the chaos
[1:04:31] you look around wars and rumors of wars
[1:04:33] National strife and yet and through all
[1:04:35] of this God is calling out an
[1:04:39] elect oh
[1:04:42] Hallelujah see Satan was
[1:04:45] confident that he conquered God's
[1:04:47] purpose and he ruined his his plan of
[1:04:48] perfection of a garden and a
[1:04:51] family but God had attributes see God
[1:04:54] had attributes to be a savior so in
[1:04:56] other to be a savior he had to have man
[1:04:58] to be able to fall in order that he
[1:05:00] could be the Savior notice now he says
[1:05:03] how could he save L there's something
[1:05:04] lost and if God was attributes before
[1:05:07] there was an angel or a molecule or
[1:05:09] anything God was by himself alone but he
[1:05:12] wasn't God cuz God is an optic of
[1:05:14] worship there was nothing for him to
[1:05:16] worship or to worship him nothing to
[1:05:19] worship him but his attributes
[1:05:21] attributes displayed something and made
[1:05:23] an Angel then he was God then he made
[1:05:27] man give him free moral agency and he
[1:05:30] fell then when he fell he became a
[1:05:32] savior and in the fall he took sickness
[1:05:35] so he became a Healer see it's all
[1:05:37] displaying God's
[1:05:40] attributes but in this great God Elohim
[1:05:43] was attributes there was attributes to
[1:05:45] there to be God attributes to be a
[1:05:46] father attributes to be a son attributes
[1:05:49] to be a savior attributes to be a Healer
[1:05:51] all these attributes was in God God
[1:05:54] that's right and it looked like it was
[1:05:57] over Perfection was over God was God was
[1:06:02] only making a a masterpiece
[1:06:06] yes that's right God started a
[1:06:09] masterpiece what he was going to do and
[1:06:11] bring it out all the way and it's going
[1:06:13] to bring it through seven Church ages
[1:06:15] he's going to have a bride out of every
[1:06:17] age but let me just tell you she's going
[1:06:19] to culminate in that final
[1:06:21] age oh what he planted in that first age
[1:06:24] is an infant bride she's going to come
[1:06:25] to maturity and she's going to be bone
[1:06:27] of his bone flesh of his flesh power of
[1:06:29] his power she is going to be the very
[1:06:31] manifestation of God himself everything
[1:06:35] that he believ she believ she knows what
[1:06:37] he wants done with his word or she keeps
[1:06:39] still she's not moving unless Papa God
[1:06:42] or husband tell her to move why because
[1:06:44] her desires is to him and to him alone
[1:06:46] it ain't to family it ain't the friend
[1:06:48] it ain't the favorite preacher it ain't
[1:06:50] to some church it ain't to some
[1:06:51] denomination it ain't to some job it
[1:06:53] ain't ain't to some school it ain't to
[1:06:55] some career her love and her affection
[1:06:57] is solely unto her
[1:06:59] Creator and he knows that therefore he
[1:07:02] comes service after
[1:07:05] service that's why he chips that's why
[1:07:07] he mows that's why he rubs that's why he
[1:07:10] shakes because God is shaping a
[1:07:12] masterpiece and some of you ouch some of
[1:07:16] you oh well somebody must have told the
[1:07:17] preacher and stepped on my toes no God
[1:07:20] is perfecting his
[1:07:22] Masterpiece cuz he's going to finish it
[1:07:25] what Michelangelo had in his mind
[1:07:26] brother Tim he had to see it all the way
[1:07:29] through
[1:07:30] fruition and when it met it met what he
[1:07:34] felt was perfect then he spoke to it and
[1:07:38] struck
[1:07:39] it oh Church don't you see what God is
[1:07:42] doing in this hour God said you must
[1:07:45] prophesy again you had reached that
[1:07:48] final perfecting element to where now

[1:08:10] for his own his love he loves them and
[1:08:14] cares for them His Eye Is ever upon them

[1:08:22] touches the apple of his eye let me tell
[1:08:24] you you are the very apple of God's eye
[1:08:27] and when you look into the apple or the

[1:08:31] reflection of the man otherwise it's
[1:08:33] called the little man of the eye and
[1:08:35] what God is saying when I look into your
[1:08:37] eyes I see myself and when you look into

[1:16:00] planted in the Old Testament in the New
[1:16:01] Testament and it isn't through
[1:16:03] denominations God had a plan and that
[1:16:06] plan was always revealing his word

[1:18:11] denomination it died perish but evening
[1:18:14] time message will show evening time
[1:18:17] light will show evening time results
[1:18:19] evening time message Jesus time midday
[1:18:22] message showed midday results but the
[1:18:25] beginning message showed the beginning
[1:18:27] the beginning results made creation he
[1:18:30] made a son In His Image in the midday
[1:18:32] but in the evening time he makes a bride
[1:18:35] for
[1:18:36] it what by by the word how did he formed
[1:18:39] the Earth he said he spoke it into
[1:18:40] existence by the word who is who who was
[1:18:43] the son his word in the beginning was
[1:18:45] the word the word was with God and the
[1:18:47] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:18:49] and dwelt Among Us how will he take his
[1:18:52] bride by by the word that's right not by
[1:18:55] a new cart not by some the Theologian
[1:18:59] idea but according to his word he will
[1:19:02] identify her and the fact that you can
[1:19:05] receive this message and receive a
[1:19:08] prophet and receive the prophet's reward
[1:19:11] what is that becoming the bride that's
[1:19:14] right shows that God has got you as his
[1:19:18] Focus but we find today in the hour in
[1:19:21] which we're living in mama just speed on
[1:19:23] through here but we find in the hour
[1:19:25] we're living in in the evening time
[1:19:27] there's also a thing called Satan's
[1:19:29] eating and we find that Satan is so
[1:19:33] longed to have what God have that he
[1:19:36] injected himself in humanity because
[1:19:39] Satan could not create in the beginning
[1:19:40] he cannot create now but he knew that
[1:19:43] God had a plan God had a desire that
[1:19:45] desire was to to have a family and Satan
[1:19:48] so long to inject himself in humanity
[1:19:51] that he crossed over he knew that he
[1:19:52] couldn't come into Humanity but he came
[1:19:54] through The Serpent and the serpent
[1:19:56] seduced Eve that's how for he injected
[1:19:58] himself into the human race and he
[1:20:00] brought all the fall brought all the
[1:20:02] destruction but yet it was all working
[1:20:04] according to the plan of God because in
[1:20:07] God's mind he wanted to be a savior he
[1:20:09] wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a
[1:20:11] deliverer when cancer would strike your
[1:20:13] body he wanted to be the one that says I
[1:20:14] put my foot on it I finishes tonight in
[1:20:18] the name of Jesus Christ no cancer can
[1:20:20] stand before the believer's prayer not
[1:20:22] even cancer church and if it means so
[1:20:25] much for that what about every promise
[1:20:27] that lays in there Satan has attacked
[1:20:29] his body he's attacked his bride but God
[1:20:31] has the final
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:34] say brother B said he had 6,000 years to
[1:20:37] create this seed and what a wonderful
[1:20:39] creation we're living in yes I mean look
[1:20:42] at Israel right now bombarded on every
[1:20:44] side yes look at the LBGTQ agenda coming
[1:20:48] after your kids look at the stuff that
[1:20:50] you can't even hardly listen to on the
[1:20:52] on the radio radio anymore because it's
[1:20:54] all a conglomeration of Filth things on
[1:20:56] the movie scene you got nothing if you
[1:20:58] have any kind of commercials trying to
[1:21:00] look at anything decent and there's
[1:21:02] commercials it's all about filth it's
[1:21:03] all about from that region of Darkness
[1:21:05] everything is just coming up with the
[1:21:07] purpose in the plan to destroy the
[1:21:10] elect but see see Satan's plan his
[1:21:13] purpose was to inject himself in the
[1:21:15] human race in order to destroy the seed
[1:21:17] line of
[1:21:19] God but God's purpose in his plan
[1:21:23] is to protect that's right to protect to
[1:21:28] Shield to finish what he started that's
[1:21:32] right he's going to have a masterpiece
[1:21:35] he would tell us in the exposition of
[1:21:37] the church ages Christ in the true the
[1:21:40] true church is a continuation of the
[1:21:43] book of Acts notice but the Book of
[1:21:45] Revelation shows how that the Antichrist
[1:21:48] Spirit would come into the church and
[1:21:49] defile it making it lukewarm formal and
[1:21:52] and Powerless and see that's Satan's
[1:21:54] whole desire is that to get into the
[1:21:56] message churches today and make them
[1:21:58] formal lukewarm and have no power to
[1:22:01] live a righteous Life to Live above sin
[1:22:03] Don't Preach on a motion or you can't
[1:22:05] have emotion because that's power you
[1:22:07] can't have this you can't have that and
[1:22:08] you got to you just got to receive it
[1:22:10] just as it comes we got the word now the
[1:22:11] revealed word that's Sor you got to just
[1:22:13] nod your head to it don't say Amen cuz
[1:22:14] that makes too much of a Ruckus but I
[1:22:17] heard today brother Brown said
[1:22:18] everywhere Jesus went there was a lot of
[1:22:19] Racket that's right put yourself in
[1:22:22] blind bought a M's shoes you would be
[1:22:23] calling on him
[1:22:25] too you'd be calling on God you said by
[1:22:28] your stri time he'll finish it
[1:22:30] now but he says notice now he says he
[1:22:33] knows that if the people get the true
[1:22:35] revelation of the true church and what
[1:22:37] she is and what she stands for and that
[1:22:39] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[1:22:41] an invincible Army if they get a true
[1:22:43] revelation of the true spirits of the
[1:22:46] two Spirits within the framework of the
[1:22:48] Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:22:50] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:22:52] spirit so we find that Satan has
[1:22:54] injected himself through co- formal
[1:22:57] theology that's
[1:22:58] right co- formal theology got him into
[1:23:03] the human race his purpose is destroy
[1:23:05] the sea line of God to have preeminence
[1:23:07] in the church to be worshiped as God
[1:23:10] sitting in the temple of God so Satan's
[1:23:12] purpose brother BR says from Eden was to
[1:23:14] make himself an Eden and exalt himself
[1:23:17] above so that the stars of God will
[1:23:20] worship Him Sons would worship Him and
[1:23:22] he absolutely had carried it out
[1:23:26] now now if Satan has brought his Eden to
[1:23:29] its
[1:23:30] Perfection what about
[1:23:32] God God ain't promising another Eden
[1:23:35] here but he's promised perfection in the
[1:23:38] Eden what is that Perfection it's a body
[1:23:41] it's a
[1:23:43] bride and she is going to be bone of his
[1:23:46] bone life of his life so Satan's purpose
[1:23:49] was to seduce and deceive the elect seed
[1:23:51] of God to work worship him in his Eden
[1:23:55] by his man-made religion which mirr is
[1:23:59] true worship but lacks the power to live
[1:24:01] a Victorious Life it's a religion built
[1:24:04] on education intellectual understanding
[1:24:06] and not a revelation but God's purpose
[1:24:08] is to preserve and to and protect that
[1:24:10] elect sea to Rapture and catch away the
[1:24:12] elect from out of Satan's a that's so we
[1:24:16] go on to find here brother Brown would
[1:24:19] tell us in the pergan church age he said
[1:24:21] in these last days
[1:24:23] the true bride Church Christ seed will
[1:24:25] come to The Headstone she will be a
[1:24:28] super
[1:24:30] church this is what he's talking about
[1:24:32] you tonight he will she will be a super
[1:24:35] Church a super race as she nears him
[1:24:38] they and the bride will be so much like
[1:24:40] him that they will even be in his very
[1:24:42] image this is in order to be United with
[1:24:45] him they will be one they will be the
[1:24:48] very manifestation of the word of the
[1:24:50] Living God and he he says from this
[1:24:53] little group of true seed of the word
[1:24:55] God will present Christ with the Beloved
[1:24:57] bride she is Virgin of his word she is a
[1:25:00] virgin because she knows no man's Creeds
[1:25:02] or dogmas but by and through the members
[1:25:04] of the Bride will be fulfilled all that
[1:25:07] was promised of God to be manifested in
[1:25:09] a
[1:25:14] virgin and he would tell us I no longer
[1:25:18] call you
[1:25:19] church but I call you bride notice that
[1:25:23] was a name not that a prophet put on you
[1:25:26] but God put on you God was showing a
[1:25:29] distinction that's right you're not part
[1:25:31] of this I've separated you from this I'm
[1:25:35] calling you bride I'm calling you
[1:25:38] separated see you're a different race
[1:25:40] you're you're a super race you're a
[1:25:42] super church he said it was anointed man
[1:25:44] then but now it's the anointed people
[1:25:46] why aned by what by by accepting what
[1:25:48] Eve turned down Adam and Eve coming back
[1:25:51] with the anointing of the word he said
[1:25:53] my word is spirit see Anointed with the
[1:25:55] word what Eve turned down he comes back
[1:25:58] and we accept what do she turned down
[1:26:01] she turned down an opportunity at life
[1:26:03] that's
[1:26:05] right but today he's come back in this
[1:26:08] hour yes and now there's a bride that's
[1:26:11] not going to fall there's a bride that's
[1:26:13] not going to turn them down but she's
[1:26:14] going to accept his message she's going
[1:26:16] to accept his life she's going to accept
[1:26:19] his seed
[1:26:21] right
[1:26:22] so insteading instead of refusing this
[1:26:27] we accept it he says oh Satan he goes oh
[1:26:31] you know but she turned around and
[1:26:32] listened to him but Eve but the Eve in
[1:26:34] this last day is not going to do it oh
[1:26:37] come on evening light bride around the
[1:26:40] world the even this last day oh she's

[1:27:03] blemish oh Hallelujah and he says now he

[1:35:47] beautiful and I looked at her and she
[1:35:48] passed by and said that's the briide
[1:35:52] woo Hallelujah but he said now we're
[1:35:56] going to review the
[1:35:57] churches said that's the Bible now we're
[1:35:59] going to review the churches look like
[1:36:01] it got worse I've seen them such filthy
[1:36:03] bunch in my life or goes I've never seen
[1:36:05] such a filthy bunch in my life and I
[1:36:07] heard a noise next and it was here comes
[1:36:09] the American group and he showed me each
[1:36:11] church as they come up out of the ages
[1:36:14] oh my how vulgar and the last one was
[1:36:17] just the last day Church which was led
[1:36:19] by a witch
[1:36:21] they were so immorally dressed so filthy
[1:36:24] looking and they were marching to the
[1:36:25] time of twist and rock and roll and
[1:36:27] those women throwing themselves just in
[1:36:29] the twist withholding just a paper gray
[1:36:32] hypocritical worship a gray paper
[1:36:35] looking paper holding in front of them
[1:36:37] with the lace like a hoola skirt holding
[1:36:38] in the front and completely new from the
[1:36:41] waist up and was marching to the time of
[1:36:44] twisting and carrying on with the music
[1:36:46] walking up and I said is that is the
[1:36:49] church each one of them had their
[1:36:51] haircut real short frizzy looking things
[1:36:54] haul over like that real shortcut hair
[1:36:56] full of makeup absolutely nothing but
[1:36:59] look like street
[1:37:01] prostitutes and he said and is that the
[1:37:04] church he goes when it passed by me my
[1:37:07] heart like to fainted and I thought if
[1:37:10] that's what I'm trying to be or if
[1:37:12] that's what is trying to be presented to
[1:37:14] Christ as a bride oh all the efforts and
[1:37:16] things that man has put forth to try to
[1:37:19] bring forth a bride for Christ and
[1:37:21] vulgar and dirty and filthy looking
[1:37:23] prostitute like that to be the bride of
[1:37:25] Christ it made me sick to my
[1:37:27] heart she passed by in the whole back
[1:37:30] part there was no covering and she
[1:37:32] passed by and he said I fell faint and
[1:37:36] sickly see Church it all seemed but
[1:37:39] lost through all the efforts of
[1:37:42] theologians all we could produce is a
[1:37:46] filthy church one that would dress
[1:37:48] immoral one that would be nbed from her
[1:37:51] waste up one that would come walking in
[1:37:52] and her church services would be full of
[1:37:54] twist and rock and roll women throwing
[1:37:56] themselves completely new from the waist
[1:37:58] up and no covering on the back part and
[1:38:00] now you have these these tights that
[1:38:02] they wear all over the place even to the
[1:38:04] house of God that's nothing but
[1:38:07] nudity see it seemed that Satan had won
[1:38:10] there was no power in the church to live
[1:38:13] a Victorious Life no strength to live
[1:38:15] above sin and Satan's vices and his cold
[1:38:18] form of powerless religion his plan of
[1:38:21] perversion to deceive The Godly seed
[1:38:25] prevailed so it it appeared but we find
[1:38:28] in Matthew 242 24 it says that it would
[1:38:31] decede the very elect if it was possible
[1:38:35] oh but it's impossible to deceive the
[1:38:38] elect he said the church positioned
[1:38:40] before the foundation world when when
[1:38:42] God in his labor pain was bringing forth
[1:38:44] bringing her forth knowing what she
[1:38:46] would do he positionally placed her in
[1:38:48] his own body to be a housewife to be a
[1:38:50] former to be a preacher to be a prophet
[1:38:52] to be this to be that he placed you
[1:38:54] positionally he says now then God having
[1:38:57] predestinated the church he said all the
[1:38:59] peoples there was million times millions
[1:39:01] that walked very religious and they were
[1:39:03] deceived only the ones that will not be
[1:39:05] deceived will be the ones that come over
[1:39:07] into the promised land just as we heard
[1:39:09] Sunday those that have crossed over into
[1:39:12] that promised land they won't be
[1:39:13] deceived why church because they've
[1:39:15] already crossed over they left Cades
[1:39:18] Baria they quit going around and around
[1:39:20] and around the mountain they have
[1:39:22] crossed into the supernatural they have
[1:39:24] crossed into the Born Again experience
[1:39:26] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost let
[1:39:28] me tell you you get that in your heart
[1:39:30] you'll never be deceived you won't be
[1:39:32] that church going down in destruction
[1:39:34] but you'll be that church that God sees
[1:39:37] in AB
[1:39:39] Vision he said false Christ will rise in
[1:39:41] the last days will de seeed the very
[1:39:43] elect if it was possible but it's not
[1:39:46] possible he said no sir the elect was
[1:39:49] for ordained so he he said they will not
[1:39:53] be deceived the bride will come into
[1:39:56] preview
[1:39:58] again oh brother Derek it looked like it
[1:40:01] was lost it looked like every effort
[1:40:03] that man had done to put God a church on
[1:40:05] the scene oh she went down in
[1:40:06] destruction but God said oh that that
[1:40:09] bride not the church but the bride is
[1:40:12] going to come back in preview oh God is
[1:40:15] determined brother Tim to finish it what
[1:40:18] she was at the beginning is why she's
[1:40:20] going to be in the end
[1:40:22] time the bride will come into preview
[1:40:25] again and here the bride came behind her
[1:40:28] the very same looking bride that passed
[1:40:31] by at the beginning oh my heart jumped
[1:40:33] for joy and they don't want us to get
[1:40:36] excited oh they don't want us to get
[1:40:39] emotional no sir I see myself in the
[1:40:41] vision I'm not that one going down in
[1:40:44] destruction oh but here I come again and
[1:40:48] what she was in the Ephesian age is is
[1:40:51] what she is in the L of C

[1:41:07] very same looking bride that passed by

[1:41:13] bride she will be made the same thing
[1:41:15] clothed in the same thing the one that
[1:41:17] was at the beginning she is to be called
[1:41:21] he goes now he says I know that to be
[1:41:23] the truth if this isn't the truth then
[1:41:25] every Vision that I've had he goes in
[1:41:27] the back has been wrong and anyone knows
[1:41:30] that not one thing as I've ever told you
[1:41:32] but what was been the truth it came to
[1:41:34] pass and he's telling you this is the
[1:41:38] truth the bride is in preview again the
[1:41:42] bride passed by in the same position
[1:41:45] that she was in in the beginning he said
[1:41:47] all the others went off in that chaos
[1:41:49] they left they disappeared here still
[1:41:51] beating to the music making real funny
[1:41:53] sounds shaking their bodies one side to
[1:41:55] the other oh but wait the bride must
[1:41:58] come again I said Oh Glory to God
[1:42:00] brother the bride is here she's here

[1:42:05] is on the scene the manifestation of the
[1:42:08] sons of God we are here we have crossed
[1:42:11] over into the promised land and what she
[1:42:13] was in that day she is again the same in
[1:42:16] this day he will finish it he will
[1:42:20] finish finish it she's perfectly the
[1:42:23] second time like she was the first time
[1:42:25] musicians please come oh but the bride
[1:42:28] came back because she was Alpha and
[1:42:32] Omega God the great sculpture had made
[1:42:35] him a masterpiece for it his piece of
[1:42:37] his first masterpiece like he made in
[1:42:40] the Garden of Eden took a piece from and
[1:42:42] made another piece and that marred and
[1:42:46] failed and now he's been all time
[1:42:48] building it up again and he brought
[1:42:49] forth this master Masterpiece and was
[1:42:52] smitten in order that the part was
[1:42:54] smitten was in order to bring back again
[1:42:56] the Masterpiece again so the Masterpiece
[1:42:59] of the Son of God the Masterpiece and
[1:43:01] the bride is peace of him which must be
[1:43:05] the fulfilling of the word the word has
[1:43:07] been fulfilled and we're ready for the

[1:43:28] he will have a church without spot
[1:43:31] without wrinkle without blemish that's
[1:43:34] the reason the bride came in preview the
[1:43:36] second time there has to be a church

[1:46:27] into a church service
[1:46:30] defeated he will finish it bow your
[1:46:34] heads with me if you
[1:46:35] would father how we thank you
[1:46:38] tonight what a word you've given us Lord
[1:46:42] through a prophetic message Lord not my
[1:46:44] message but the message you sent through
[1:46:46] a prophet a Vindicated mouthpiece for
[1:46:48] this hour Lord declaring that you showed
[1:46:51] a distinction between the church and the
[1:46:54] bride and Lord and we can see that what
[1:46:57] man has produced has produced a church
[1:46:59] that is out of rhythm with everything
[1:47:01] that this Bible stands for but there is
[1:47:04] a bride Lord and she's a match piece to
[1:47:07] you same character same life same Zeal
[1:47:11] Same Love Bone of your bone flesh of
[1:47:14] your
[1:47:15] flesh and Lord you showed her to a
[1:47:17] prophet in a vision you gave him an
[1:47:21] example of what that first church or
[1:47:23] that first bride looked like that one
[1:47:26] that was first planted in the Ephesian
[1:47:27] age and you knew there would be there
[1:47:30] would be other ages Lord and that church
[1:47:32] would go down in destruction go down
[1:47:33] through the Dark Ages but she'd begin to
[1:47:35] rise again Lord because you was always
[1:47:38] working on that
[1:47:39] Masterpiece and what father Satan has
[1:47:42] had his intellectual denominational
[1:47:43] bride working on her Lord bringing her
[1:47:46] here into this age but father we find at
[1:47:48] that age that bride goes down in
[1:47:49] destruction but this one here what she
[1:47:53] was in the beginning is what she is now
[1:47:55] God what a promise of
[1:47:57] finishing you show us through the
[1:47:59] message God you show us through the
[1:48:01] scriptures it's always been about you
[1:48:03] and a bride and we got down to the end
[1:48:06] of the age Lord through a prophet's
[1:48:07] message and again you're showing us the
[1:48:11] bride father help us to see who we are
[1:48:14] not our failures not our defeats not our
[1:48:16] difficulties not our our loneliness not
[1:48:19] our complex and our fears and depression
[1:48:21] but God help us to see exactly who we
[1:48:25] are we are that sinless virtuous bride
[1:48:28] of Jesus Christ never done it in the
[1:48:32] first place Lord I ask that you bless
[1:48:34] your people
[1:48:35] tonight Lord I pray you would be with
[1:48:37] them go with them strengthen them Lord
[1:48:39] Lord if they ever have a doubt may they
[1:48:41] just come back to this message tonight

[1:48:45] thankful and so so grateful that we have
[1:48:47] a ministry here at even light Tabernacle
[1:48:49] Lord not that it's the only Ministry
[1:48:51] that there is but God it's a great
[1:48:52] ministry and sound Doctrine great
[1:48:55] preaching comes from this Pulpit Lord
[1:48:57] atmosphere that the word can be received
[1:49:00] because Lord this is not about a man but
[1:49:01] this is about building your kingdom
[1:49:04] pointing man to your kingdom getting
[1:49:05] that bride ready for a
