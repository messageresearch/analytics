[59:12] holy
[59:13] sacrifice so thankful to have the Lamb
[59:15] of God that took my
[59:17] place amen
[59:19] and you know just this week we had a the
[59:22] passing of our brother Kenneth Middleton
[59:26] and he'll be greatly missed and uh we
[59:30] found him to be a man who really loves
[59:32] the Lord and died in faith and he didn't
[59:36] die a loser either he's not a loser amen
[59:39] he's a winner amen you know I I was
[59:41] visit him here just a few days before he
[59:44] passed and he actually was very cognant
[59:47] and able to speak quite a few things to
[59:50] me and and he said his grandson I
[59:52] believe Caleb had asked him he said
[59:54] Granddad he said if you ever ever if you
[59:57] ever have the O ever would have the
[59:59] opportunity to stand behind a pull pit
[1:00:02] and speak you know but kthy I don't know
[1:00:04] how many times he read the Bible and
[1:00:07] listening to the message all the way
[1:00:08] through and quite a well studied man um
[1:00:13] he said but if you had the opportunity
[1:00:15] to speak what would you speak on he said
[1:00:18] I would preach on the danger of going to
[1:00:20] church and he said his grandson's like
[1:00:23] wow that that surprises me what he what
[1:00:26] what do you what would where would that
[1:00:28] go and he said well you know there's the
[1:00:30] dangers of just going to church and just
[1:00:32] going through the motions and and not
[1:00:34] ever really getting anything from God he
[1:00:36] said but I found the danger of going to
[1:00:38] church is it'll kill
[1:00:41] you he said I found out that that old
[1:00:45] man that I used to be it
[1:00:48] died
[1:00:50] amen amen
[1:00:58] you know I got to thinking about Enoch
[1:01:00] and how he lived 60 and5 years and then
[1:01:03] he beget Methuselah and then the
[1:01:05] scripture says then Enoch walked with
[1:01:07] God after he beet Methuselah so there
[1:01:10] was a period of time he didn't walk with
[1:01:13] God Amen but then he he began to walk
[1:01:16] with God and and we know the story is he
[1:01:19] was found not for God took him and we
[1:01:23] have to say again brother Kenneth didn't
[1:01:25] die
[1:01:26] he's still just as alive today even more
[1:01:29] so than ever amen and and he's not here
[1:01:32] with us for God has received him on the
[1:01:35] other side and so I I just want to thank
[1:01:38] the Lord for brother Kenneth's life and
[1:01:41] what he meant to us and um I can
[1:01:44] remember a lot of times in my early
[1:01:45] Ministry calling him and talk to him
[1:01:47] about things and him encouraging me and
[1:01:51] and always really appreciated our
[1:01:52] brother and thankful that I was able to
[1:01:55] serve of what time we had here on this
[1:01:57] side but this is not the end it's just
[1:02:01] the beginning amen and it's the what a
[1:02:04] beginning for our brother to you know to
[1:02:06] never have to go back to a wheelchair
[1:02:08] again to never have to go back to a
[1:02:10] crippled up body and and and to go
[1:02:12] through cancer and different things you
[1:02:15] know actually you know I actually
[1:02:16] thought he'd never die just because all
[1:02:18] the things he went through and overcome
[1:02:20] but uh he he told me very in a personal
[1:02:23] way he said you know I I I said this may
[1:02:26] strange sounds strange he said but I I I
[1:02:30] love the Rapture and the thought of the
[1:02:31] Rapture and taking the body change he
[1:02:33] said but honestly he said I've always
[1:02:35] wanted to go on to the other side he
[1:02:38] said because I want to be one of those
[1:02:40] that comes back with him I want to see
[1:02:43] Jesus and so that was his desire and and
[1:02:47] uh actually I would pray and and talk to
[1:02:49] him on that day and and you know still
[1:02:52] believing God could touch him I'd get
[1:02:54] through with my prayer and he said and I
[1:02:56] said brother Kenneth I'll see you again
[1:02:58] he looked at me and he said yeah on the
[1:03:00] other side that was that was in his
[1:03:03] heart and he knew it and uh so we just
[1:03:05] want to take a moment to think about our
[1:03:07] brother and and to be thankful for the
[1:03:11] life that he lived here and I know he'd
[1:03:14] be greatly missed not only by this
[1:03:15] church but by his wife sister Loretta
[1:03:18] and and the family and and he was father
[1:03:21] to many there and so we just want to
[1:03:24] take a moment to think about him and
[1:03:26] then we'll pray let's just take a moment
[1:03:28] of
[1:03:48] silence
[1:03:49] father we want to say how much we are
[1:03:52] thankful for lives Lord that live for
[1:03:57] you no doubt if Hebrews 11 could
[1:04:00] continue to be wrote our brother's name
[1:04:03] would even be written
[1:04:05] there died in
[1:04:07] Faith Lord God we just ask Lord that you
[1:04:11] would just come and comfort Hearts as
[1:04:14] only you can Lord he's got a dear wife
[1:04:17] that's going to miss him children
[1:04:20] grandchildren we ask Lord that you would
[1:04:22] come and move on their behalf as only
[1:04:24] you can
[1:04:26] cuz you are the comforter Lord we can
[1:04:28] say things we can say words and we can
[1:04:31] mean him with all of our heart and this
[1:04:34] it brings Comfort but nobody Comforts
[1:04:37] like you can Lord in those moments of
[1:04:40] Sorrow you can just remind us of the
[1:04:42] good times and the good things and Lord
[1:04:45] I'm so thankful for our brother Lord
[1:04:47] he's not suffering anymore and he's in a
[1:04:50] body of Deliverance complete whole never
[1:04:54] to go back again to that old mortal
[1:04:56] realm Lord but forever a son of yours
[1:04:59] and a young body and health we ask Lord
[1:05:02] you'll just Comfort us as a church
[1:05:05] during these times because we'll miss
[1:05:06] him Lord as you come in and added his
[1:05:09] little lick of fire and clapping of His
[1:05:12] Hands singing worshiping unto you God
[1:05:15] we'll miss him Lord but Lord what a
[1:05:17] grand reunion day Lord when we come to
[1:05:21] that moment of change Lord and our
[1:05:23] bodies we see our loved ones rise up
[1:05:25] from the grave and Lord not in their old
[1:05:28] decrepit bodies not in their old
[1:05:30] wrinkled skin and
[1:05:31] gray-headed Lord bounding wheelchairs or
[1:05:35] whatever kind of humanity but Lord young
[1:05:38] and Lord a perfect body and perfect
[1:05:41] health Lord the faith that arise in our
[1:05:44] hearts as we feel that change sweep over
[1:05:47] us Lord to go to match them and to be
[1:05:50] gathered together to meet you what a day
[1:05:52] that'll be Lord and I I believe it's not
[1:05:54] just a fairy tail or some sand castle
[1:05:57] somewhere that'll be washed away but
[1:06:00] it's a living reality Lord Lord help us
[1:06:03] to catch the vision of that other land
[1:06:06] lord lord that we can see there's
[1:06:08] there's more to that land than there is
[1:06:10] to this land and it's more real than
[1:06:13] here father and Lord today as he would
[1:06:16] join that cloud of witnesses and today
[1:06:18] we once again hear his voice saying
[1:06:21] press on Don't Stop keep going it's
[1:06:24] worth it it's worth every trial it's
[1:06:27] worth every pain it's worth every thing
[1:06:29] that you would ever go through to re to
[1:06:31] be able to experience what I'm
[1:06:33] experiencing now father we ask Lord

[1:06:47] Lord and allow you to minister to our
[1:06:50] hearts and needs cuz God I I'm I'm
[1:06:53] incapable I I can't do anything or
[1:06:55] anything on my own that would be of any
[1:06:58] really any benefit especially not
[1:07:00] Eternal benefit but Lord it takes you to
[1:07:03] anoint the word to our heart and we just
[1:07:05] ask God that you would move in a mighty
[1:07:07] way we pray in jesus' name

[1:07:14] amen good to be in the house of the
[1:07:17] Lord amen turn our Bibles to Genesis 1

[1:07:30] Amen brother Tim will be home tomorrow
[1:07:33] evening and he's had a good time a lot
[1:07:36] of lot of good things have been done in
[1:07:38] Newland and now in New Brunswick there
[1:07:41] and we're thankful for that we happened
[1:07:44] to be away this last Wednesday at
[1:07:45] brother Jason Jackson's and last minute
[1:07:48] kind of trip and and but the Lord I
[1:07:52] actually was going to go pick up a
[1:07:53] little piece of equipment that I wanted
[1:07:55] and and he he asked me if I would stop
[1:07:58] by and Minister for them and and Lord
[1:08:00] had more in plan in the plan than my
[1:08:02] little piece of equipment and we're
[1:08:04] thankful that he he's in control of
[1:08:07] every every situation and I saw that you
[1:08:10] had a wonderful time here as well and
[1:08:12] and what a mighty God we serve amen it's
[1:08:16] I tell you that that service Wednesday
[1:08:18] night that sermon Wednesday night was
[1:08:20] just a tremendous blessing and and uh
[1:08:23] challenged my own heart amen
[1:08:26] and uh I I I believe that more I believe
[1:08:30] everybody ought to hear that and and
[1:08:32] just just say Lord help me amen I
[1:08:35] believe but help thou my unbelief amen
[1:08:38] and help me to line up to the word of
[1:08:40] God Genesis 1 and verse 14 says and God
[1:08:43] said let there be lights in the
[1:08:45] firmament of the Heavens to divide the
[1:08:47] day from the night and let them be for
[1:08:50] signs and for seasons and for days and
[1:08:53] for years and let them be for lights and
[1:08:56] the firment of the heaven to give light
[1:08:58] upon the Earth and it was so in Matthew
[1:09:01] chapter 4 verse
[1:09:04] 16 it says the people which sat in
[1:09:07] darkness saw great light and to them
[1:09:11] which sat in the region and shadow of
[1:09:13] death light is sprung up and from that
[1:09:17] time that time Jesus be to preach and
[1:09:21] say repent for the kingdom is of Heaven
[1:09:25] Heaven is at hand amen we we'll let you
[1:09:28] be
[1:09:30] seated I
[1:09:32] um actually was preaching on Wednesday
[1:09:36] again at brother Jason's on the season
[1:09:38] of
[1:09:39] change and um begin to as I I spoke
[1:09:43] there I I hit a few things on there and
[1:09:45] I kind of sparked some more thoughts
[1:09:47] upon on this on the line here on this
[1:09:50] same line but I'd like to speak to you
[1:09:52] on the light the change because I I
[1:09:55] believe that's what we're looking for is
[1:09:57] the ultimate change of our bodies amen
[1:10:00] but there had to be another change
[1:10:01] before we'll ever see that
[1:10:03] change and and you know in reading the
[1:10:05] scripture uh brother Brandon would take
[1:10:07] from the scripture and preach a message
[1:10:09] on from that time and at that and we'll
[1:10:12] go into that some uh this morning but
[1:10:14] from that time amen this light had come
[1:10:18] and and they they that sat in the region
[1:10:20] in the shadow of death light is sprung
[1:10:23] up and you know I find it very awesome
[1:10:26] as I begin to look into these things
[1:10:27] that every time in the Bible and even in
[1:10:30] our day as we go into it amen when God
[1:10:33] is ready to make a change whether it be
[1:10:35] a change in in a life or or a change in
[1:10:39] in in um dispensation a change there's
[1:10:43] always a light that accompanies that
[1:10:45] change and and then I and I see it here
[1:10:48] as he put in his word he gave these
[1:10:50] lights for for signs and for seasons and
[1:10:53] so he would declare that this light had
[1:10:55] to be here amen so that change could
[1:10:58] take place upon the Earth and and if we
[1:11:00] read about the Earth we could read about
[1:11:02] in The Genesis 1 and the beginning God
[1:11:04] created the Heaven and the Earth and the
[1:11:06] Earth was without form this without form
[1:11:09] is considered something of no value it's
[1:11:12] a waste a Barren place it was without
[1:11:15] form and void and void is an empty space
[1:11:18] needing to be fulfilled and so the
[1:11:21] darkness was upon the face of the earth
[1:11:24] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:11:26] face of the waters and God said let
[1:11:28] there be light and there was light see
[1:11:31] God didn't want to leave the earth and
[1:11:33] the condition that it was and and the
[1:11:35] barren condition and and and a something
[1:11:38] that of of no value just a wasted Barren
[1:11:41] place but he desired to create an Eden
[1:11:44] upon that Barren place and so in order
[1:11:47] to create that Eden he had to First
[1:11:49] create light and that Light Came Upon
[1:11:52] the Earth for the first time and it was
[1:11:54] signifying that change is about to come
[1:11:57] upon the earth that is going to leave
[1:11:59] and go from a Barren wasted condition
[1:12:02] Amen to a Garden of Eden and it was
[1:12:05] going to change the look it was going to
[1:12:07] change the feel it was going to change
[1:12:09] the landscape of all the Earth amen when
[1:12:12] light comes it changes things and God
[1:12:15] has always used light to Mark a change
[1:12:18] he he would use it in Abraham's day when
[1:12:21] Abraham would go into a deep sleep and
[1:12:23] and God would put him into a deep sleep
[1:12:25] and he would divide the sacrifices and
[1:12:27] all those things you know the scripture
[1:12:29] and but it they read the Scripture it
[1:12:31] said a light begin to walk between the
[1:12:33] sacrifices and brother randam said that
[1:12:35] was showing that there was to be a
[1:12:37] change amen a covenant that was coming
[1:12:39] upon the Earth that it wasn't no more I
[1:12:41] do this and you do this and if you do
[1:12:43] this I'll do this but I'm going to do
[1:12:46] this no matter what you do that it's an
[1:12:48] unconditional Covenant and light marked
[1:12:51] that change it was also in the burning
[1:12:53] bush it was Moses you know the prophet
[1:12:56] of God that had become just a sheep
[1:12:58] herder and turned his back upon the
[1:13:00] promises of God and walked away from it
[1:13:02] and and forgot about it for 40 years but
[1:13:06] you know on that morning that he rose up
[1:13:08] it was different from all other mornings
[1:13:10] and and Moses begin to think about his
[1:13:12] way and how how he had went off on his
[1:13:14] own schooling and his own training and
[1:13:17] and he tried to produce something and
[1:13:18] he' killed one Egyptian and he was
[1:13:20] thinking about these things no doubt and
[1:13:22] something happened a little crackling on
[1:13:25] a heel C his attention and he looked
[1:13:27] over there and there was a light that
[1:13:28] had come down in a burning bush and and
[1:13:31] he said I'm going to turn aside and see
[1:13:33] what this what God has done and and he
[1:13:35] walks up there and out of that light
[1:13:37] speaks a voice and and that voice begins
[1:13:39] to remind him who he was and why he was
[1:13:43] here on Earth and and what he was to be
[1:13:45] and what God has had ordained him to be
[1:13:47] and and and he began to give all of
[1:13:49] excuses and say this that and the other
[1:13:51] but all the excuses God had an answer
[1:13:54] and and God be to tell him I am has come
[1:13:57] down to deliver my people now they had
[1:14:00] been in slavery some 400 years but there
[1:14:03] came a light down to declare A change is
[1:14:06] upon the Earth A Change Is Coming upon
[1:14:09] on on on the behalf of my children and
[1:14:11] we know how God moved in a mighty way
[1:14:13] and that Pillar of Fire would come down
[1:14:16] and move through Moses and and go
[1:14:18] through there and he would begin to
[1:14:19] speak the word of God and he said go
[1:14:21] tell Pharaoh let my people go now that
[1:14:24] changed it happen all at once but it
[1:14:26] when when it it was just as good as done
[1:14:29] because the word had spoken and it was
[1:14:31] going to happen it didn't matter how
[1:14:33] much Pharaoh hardened his heart or how
[1:14:36] how how it seemed to get worse make more
[1:14:38] bricks without straw all these things
[1:14:40] that did not change God's mind it did
[1:14:42] not change God's nature it did not
[1:14:44] change his his abilities but God was
[1:14:47] more determined than ever to bring this
[1:14:49] change upon his people and we know the
[1:14:52] light stayed there among them amen as it
[1:14:54] was stay there in Goan it would be light
[1:14:56] in Goan and dark in Egypt amen it was
[1:14:59] showing there's a change that is coming
[1:15:01] upon your behalf amen and they would go
[1:15:03] out amen with a light and that light
[1:15:06] would go with them and that light would
[1:15:07] open the Red Sea that light would give
[1:15:10] them good Waters to drink that that
[1:15:12] light would provide food that light
[1:15:14] would provide all kinds of things for
[1:15:16] them amen that light would lead them all
[1:15:19] the way into the promised land it didn't
[1:15:21] matter if they believed it or not it
[1:15:23] didn't matter if they walked away from
[1:15:25] or not it didn't matter if they denied
[1:15:27] it or not that light remained with the
[1:15:29] children of Israel and it led them into
[1:15:31] the promised land amen and I I believe
[1:15:33] the same thing has come in our
[1:15:35] generation a light came down in our
[1:15:37] generation what was it go tell Pharaoh

[1:15:49] by lost truths amen that had those
[1:15:52] truths had have been bound up and mixed
[1:15:53] all up but the light came and it showed
[1:15:56] upon those truths and it be to tell what
[1:15:59] was what and what was not and what was
[1:16:01] true and what wasn't true and it brought
[1:16:03] the god head back in his place and it
[1:16:05] brought serpent seed back in his place
[1:16:07] what was it the light be to Dawn upon
[1:16:09] the word and the word begin to speak to
[1:16:12] our hearts and the word begin to say hey

[1:23:00] it's God in
[1:23:02] us amen and a change took place and and
[1:23:06] he said on the day of Pentecost when the
[1:23:07] Holy Ghost fell upon these people we
[1:23:10] said we're talking about people that
[1:23:11] were
[1:23:12] ungodly people that had sin in their
[1:23:15] life people that had denied him people
[1:23:19] that had walked away from
[1:23:22] him and the Holy Ghost fell upon these
[1:23:25] people and they acted like drunk men and
[1:23:28] women they staggered under the impact of
[1:23:31] that
[1:23:33] light come on now Hey listen we got a
[1:23:37] whole world that's staggering under the
[1:23:39] impact of
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:42] Darkness they're staggering like drunk
[1:23:44] men and and they don't know which way is
[1:23:46] right and which way is wrong they're
[1:23:48] staggering they don't know if it's a man
[1:23:50] or a woman or this that and the other
[1:23:51] what is it they're staggering in the
[1:23:53] Darkness
[1:23:55] but I want you to understand also the
[1:23:57] light has an effect upon
[1:24:00] you amen and they staggered like drunk
[1:24:04] men and women under the impact of the
[1:24:06] Holy Spirit and walked away wagging
[1:24:08] their heads and and these others walked
[1:24:10] away waging these men are drunk of new
[1:24:13] of some kind of wine and so forth he
[1:24:15] said but it was absolutely the
[1:24:18] light the word that had been prophesied
[1:24:22] made manifest
[1:24:25] as we heard Wednesday night if we're not
[1:24:27] preaching that pattern you're not
[1:24:30] preaching light you're preaching
[1:24:33] Darkness amen we know we wonder why our
[1:24:36] services can't ever get off the ground
[1:24:37] sometime it's because men have preached
[1:24:40] the move of the Holy Ghost right out of
[1:24:41] their churches and they preach Darkness
[1:24:44] instead of
[1:24:51] light had somebody tell me well I don't
[1:24:55] think that
[1:24:56] we we should think every service ought
[1:25:00] to be high all the
[1:25:02] time I don't think we should we think
[1:25:05] that it's going to be dancing and
[1:25:06] shouting and carrying on all the time I
[1:25:10] said well I I I don't think that
[1:25:12] either that's not what that's not what
[1:25:16] you know determines to me if it was a
[1:25:18] great service or
[1:25:19] not sure do I enjoy those times of
[1:25:22] course I do I've watch watch that into
[1:25:24] of that last service over and over cuz I
[1:25:27] enjoy
[1:25:29] it I enjoy that move in that in that
[1:25:32] manner but also enjoy times that I can't
[1:25:34] even hardly talk and tears are coming
[1:25:36] down on my face and I got my hands up I
[1:25:39] enjoy those moments
[1:25:40] too but I told my wife the other day I
[1:25:43] said you know I understand all of that
[1:25:45] and I understand that that's not that's
[1:25:48] not a problem but what I don't
[1:25:50] understand is how come we can't expect a
[1:25:53] service to be as high as
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:25:58] possible amen why can't we come with the
[1:26:01] expectation that every service is going
[1:26:03] to go as high as it possibly can
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:08] go amen I don't know about you but I'm W
[1:26:10] to go higher than this Earthbound
[1:26:13] creature that I
[1:26:14] am I want to go so high one day I want
[1:26:17] to be like EA I don't come
[1:26:20] back Timothy PR walk with God and want
[1:26:24] not because God took
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:29] him but we want to we want to put we
[1:26:32] want to limit the expectations and if
[1:26:34] we're not careful we'll preach in such a
[1:26:36] way that people don't expect
[1:26:40] anything brother Brandon preached
[1:26:43] expectations he said what you get is
[1:26:45] what you expect that's
[1:26:48] right
[1:26:50] amen you know it was light on the day of
[1:26:53] Pentecost so that was showing a change
[1:26:56] yes amen things that was about to take
[1:26:59] place amen men looked at it and said
[1:27:01] well that's just a bunch of just a bunch
[1:27:03] of crazy people they they're they're
[1:27:05] drunk already and and how and he said
[1:27:08] how can these things be it's only the
[1:27:10] third hour of the day we're not drunk on
[1:27:13] wine as you suppose but we are drunk on
[1:27:16] wine cuz in Joel chapter two it said
[1:27:19] amen in the last days I'll pour out my
[1:27:21] spirit upon All Flesh and now sons and
[1:27:23] daughter of prophesy old men will see V
[1:27:26] dreams and the young men see Visions
[1:27:28] amen what was it he said yeah there is a
[1:27:30] wine you can get drunk on Amen there is
[1:27:34] something that can get you stimulated
[1:27:36] amen and get you to believe enough to
[1:27:38] move past your doldrums and move past
[1:27:40] your unbelief and move past your flesh
[1:27:43] and move past your pride and move past
[1:27:46] what you think and move passing to The
[1:27:51] Impossible right
[1:27:54] it's a
[1:27:55] light that that that showing a change
[1:27:59] you know I mentioned this actually at
[1:28:00] brother Jason's and this is part of what
[1:28:03] got me on this was you know there was a
[1:28:05] time brother brandom I believe had a
[1:28:06] dream or Vision I failed to look that
[1:28:08] part up but he had this moment that he
[1:28:11] heard this lamb that was caught in the
[1:28:12] bush that's right you heard that
[1:28:14] remember that story and he said by by
[1:28:17] and he said the closer he got to it it
[1:28:19] started by a M
[1:28:21] Town M Town and he said you know I
[1:28:25] didn't even know where miltown was now
[1:28:27] how far was that we went there about 20
[1:28:28] minutes from Jeffersonville by a car and
[1:28:32] now you
[1:28:33] know that wasn't that far away and he
[1:28:36] didn't know where it was world has
[1:28:40] changed I told this too I I I can't ever
[1:28:43] get past this there's a there's a a
[1:28:45] black man that lives over close to
[1:28:46] brother Jeff's sister Esther uh that was
[1:28:49] somebody had talked to him about him his
[1:28:51] when ask him where where he met his wife
[1:28:53] and he said well she wasn't from these
[1:28:55] parts so where was she from he lives on
[1:28:58] Germantown Road said well she was on the
[1:29:00] other side of
[1:29:03] Homer but she wouldn't from these
[1:29:06] parts that's how much the t uh things
[1:29:10] have
[1:29:11] changed and so here he begins to ask
[1:29:14] around where's miltown and finally
[1:29:16] somebody told him and he goes up there
[1:29:18] and he begins to begins to walk down the
[1:29:20] street and he said he got him a soap box

[1:30:37] mercy what kind of spirits can get a
[1:30:40] hold of
[1:30:41] people and here they are and here he is
[1:30:44] and he said finally he didn't know what
[1:30:46] else to do but go pray and he said I got
[1:30:48] out there and I be to pray and I was
[1:30:51] like Lord I need your direction I've
[1:30:53] tried and ain't worked I don't know what
[1:30:55] to do and he said you know the Briars
[1:30:57] got started sticking me and he said I
[1:30:58] moved over and he said the mosquito
[1:31:00] started buzzing right you know that's
[1:31:01] how the devil wants to do just when
[1:31:03] you're about to press through and get
[1:31:04] into something he's always there to
[1:31:06] distract you the phone will ring this
[1:31:08] will happen that'll go on he's always
[1:31:10] there to try to keep you from it but he
[1:31:11] said if you'll just keep pushing
[1:31:14] through amen if you'll just keep pushing
[1:31:17] through amen God will show you
[1:31:20] something and he said about that time
[1:31:22] when I got into the spirit and I began
[1:31:25] to pray and God began to move he said I
[1:31:28] looked up and there was a
[1:31:30] light he said this same light the same
[1:31:34] light that was hanging there in that
[1:31:36] Dogwood Bush was shining right there and
[1:31:38] said the voice spoke and said go by way
[1:31:40] of Carter's for thus sayith the Lord
[1:31:43] she's going to be
[1:31:45] healed the light had come to declare
[1:31:48] it's time for a
[1:31:50] change amen she's been in this moment
[1:31:53] long enough she's been in this season
[1:31:55] long enough she's been in this disease
[1:31:57] long enough but I have come down to
[1:31:59] deliver Georgie Carter you're not going
[1:32:02] to have to do it William brandom I'm
[1:32:04] going to lead you and I'm going to show
[1:32:06] you how to how it's going to happen and
[1:32:08] he walks into that place and he begin to
[1:32:10] speak the word of God and he this little
[1:32:12] frail 30 something pound girl 50
[1:32:15] something whatever it was almost little
[1:32:17] sticks for legs jumped up out of bed and
[1:32:20] she begin to run around praising God and
[1:32:23] she begin to go go out and kiss the
[1:32:24] grass and the trees and all of that why
[1:32:27] God the same one she read about had now
[1:32:31] come the lighted come into her room and
[1:32:33] it brought a
[1:32:37] change
[1:32:40] hallelujah hallelujah and you know
[1:32:43] what's so wonderful about that story I
[1:32:45] just caught just a few days ago amen she
[1:32:48] went to lessons to play the piano and
[1:32:50] she was ravished and trying you think
[1:32:53] God you think she would allow the devil
[1:32:54] to cram her life with some complex over
[1:32:57] that or some fear over that no sir as
[1:32:59] soon as she got delivered what did she
[1:33:01] go back to playing the
[1:33:05] piano Hallelujah you have to push past
[1:33:09] what you see and look to the
[1:33:13] Unseen I got a quote here you said well
[1:33:15] I don't see the pillar of fire well you
[1:33:17] know what brother Brandon said he didn't
[1:33:19] always see it
[1:33:22] either there's a quote right here I got
[1:33:24] it he said you know what the pillar of
[1:33:27] fire is here he said I don't see it with
[1:33:30] these two eyes he said but I see it by
[1:33:32] what his word
[1:33:36] said Hallelujah then we can have the
[1:33:39] same faith we may not see it with these
[1:33:42] two eyes but we can see it by what the
[1:33:44] word says and if what does the word said
[1:33:48] I'll never leave you or forsake you
[1:33:50] where two or three are gathered in my
[1:33:52] name there I will be
[1:33:55] what name the name above all names the
[1:33:58] name of Jesus Christ and when you speak
[1:34:01] that name light appears and darkness
[1:34:05] FS why do you think sometimes even while
[1:34:08] the preaching of the word is going forth
[1:34:10] what is happening light is being
[1:34:13] released amen and light can go and cut
[1:34:15] out darkness and people be delivered
[1:34:18] right at that
[1:34:22] moment why do you think in the scripture
[1:34:25] he said they shall lay hands upon the
[1:34:26] sick you know why cuz light is being
[1:34:31] released you can read it brother brownon
[1:34:33] talks about it he said W you lay hand he
[1:34:35] said them hands he said when you lay
[1:34:37] them on each other there's light that
[1:34:39] goes back and
[1:34:42] forth speaking of a change Saul on the
[1:34:45] road to
[1:34:46] Damascus going to put the Believers in
[1:34:49] Chains and persecute the Church of the
[1:34:50] Living God and a light shined on him
[1:34:54] and knocked him off his horse we can
[1:34:55] read about in Acts chapter 9 verse4 he
[1:34:58] fell to the Earth and heard a voice
[1:35:00] saying to him Saul Saul why persecutest
[1:35:03] thou me and he said who art thou
[1:35:06] Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom
[1:35:09] thou
[1:35:10] persecuted I thought I was persecuting a
[1:35:13] Jew or a
[1:35:15] gentile I thought I was doing it to
[1:35:17] somebody you was but it wasn't to who
[1:35:20] you thought cuz behind that somebody was
[1:35:22] Jesus that's
[1:35:24] right amen I am Jesus whom thou
[1:35:28] persecutest it's is it it is hard for
[1:35:31] thee to kick against the Pricks and he
[1:35:33] trembled and astonished said Lord what
[1:35:35] will th have me to do and the Lord said
[1:35:36] arise and go into the City and it shall
[1:35:39] be told the light came and changed him
[1:35:42] from Saul to
[1:35:44] Paul amen he went from being a
[1:35:46] persecutor of the church to the
[1:35:48] messenger of the
[1:35:50] church that's a paradox amen the very
[1:35:54] one don't don't don't you know it took
[1:35:56] him a little while to trust old
[1:35:57] Paul amen he done throw a bunch of them
[1:36:00] in jail and he was persecuting the
[1:36:02] righteous amen and here he was coming
[1:36:04] against them and throwing them in jail
[1:36:05] and doing this bringing them before the
[1:36:06] law and all of a sudden he has a
[1:36:09] testimony I was on my way to throw you
[1:36:12] in
[1:36:13] jail I was on my way to throw you in
[1:36:15] jail and to get your wife and throw her
[1:36:17] in jail and your children and all this
[1:36:19] for preaching what you were preaching
[1:36:21] but on my way I met a light yeah and
[1:36:24] that light spoke to me and said Paul why
[1:36:28] persecutest thou me and here I thought
[1:36:30] it was you brother har but I realized
[1:36:32] right behind
[1:36:35] there it's no longer Jesus in the law
[1:36:40] but now it's in his
[1:36:42] grace a change and that light came and
[1:36:46] changed Paul to where he would now come
[1:36:48] from Saul the law to Paul
[1:36:52] Grace and he would begin to to go
[1:36:55] through the Old Testament and pull out
[1:36:57] what was what was pertaining to our
[1:37:01] day that's why he's a messenger same
[1:37:03] thing with brother brandom you wonder
[1:37:05] why didn't he pull it all out because
[1:37:07] he's a word prophet he knows what
[1:37:09] pertains to our
[1:37:11] day amen he knows exactly what's in
[1:37:15] there and so the light changed him from
[1:37:18] the persecutor to the messenger Peter
[1:37:20] was in jail he was bound held by two men
[1:37:24] by his side and two at the door you
[1:37:26] think they wanted that man out no no
[1:37:29] what we're talking about the same one
[1:37:32] that said I don't know
[1:37:35] him I wasn't with him I wasn't a part of
[1:37:39] him I don't know who you and he did it
[1:37:41] three times and
[1:37:45] cursed what what was the curse about he
[1:37:48] was calling Down Heaven if I've told a
[1:37:50] lie let me be cursed
[1:37:56] I love how brother brother Aaron brought
[1:37:58] that out on Wednesday night and go tell
[1:38:05] Peter what I love about that is even in
[1:38:07] his death burial resurrection and Peter
[1:38:10] denying him all through that he woke up
[1:38:12] and come out of the grave and his mind
[1:38:15] was still on

[1:38:35] saw you as you were and I said God I
[1:38:37] looked at you and I called you by who
[1:38:39] you were amen the light came and changed
[1:38:42] you and here's Peter a denier and now
[1:38:46] he's in jail not for
[1:38:48] denying for preaching the
[1:38:51] gospel for causing such a St
[1:38:54] hey they want to throw him in jail for
[1:38:55] it you're talking about a change that
[1:38:58] have been brought in his life hey he
[1:39:00] faced all kinds of things and he never
[1:39:02] one more time backed up from
[1:39:08] it but in the moment that he was in that
[1:39:12] darkness of that cell guarded and was
[1:39:15] going to be kept there amen what

[1:43:59] was just born just at the morning
[1:44:01] morning right before the break of the
[1:44:02] morning it was testified over and over
[1:44:05] and over of a light that be to circle
[1:44:07] around his
[1:44:08] bed and that light would follow that
[1:44:10] little boy and he would hear things see

[1:44:42] sitting in the
[1:44:43] darkness and all of a sudden he
[1:44:46] hears and a light
[1:44:48] appears and the light begins to Glow
[1:44:51] brighter and brighter until out of that
[1:44:53] light steps a man about six foot tall
[1:44:56] hair down around his
[1:45:00] shoulders white garment Olive complexion

[1:46:10] were saying but it was the pillar of
[1:46:12] fire the light the fire that came
[1:46:14] service after service after service and
[1:46:17] that light would make such a change in
[1:46:19] William bram's life till his ministry

[1:48:28] sudden I felt something moving and I my
[1:48:32] wife grabbed me by the hand said honey I
[1:48:34] said sweetheart just a moment the angel
[1:48:37] of the Lord is here and that's he said
[1:48:39] Howard said Bill you're not going down
[1:48:41] there look people are screaming and
[1:48:43] carrying on you're not going on down
[1:48:45] there I said Howard stand aside son the
[1:48:47] angel of the Lord is now telling me to
[1:48:49] go down there and ushers begin to throw
[1:48:51] their hands together made a line and I
[1:48:53] be to walk up the down to the platform
[1:48:56] and I said I do not claim to be a Divine
[1:48:58] healer don't think hard of Mr best
[1:49:01] although he had hired some photographers
[1:49:03] to come listen to this he hired a
[1:49:04] commercial photographer at the Douglas
[1:49:06] Studios write them and see if you want
[1:49:07] to find out about it connected with the
[1:49:09] American photo photographer Association
[1:49:12] he had hired Mr kipperman of the of that
[1:49:14] Association and all this and he said he
[1:49:16] had done all this to try to prove God
[1:49:19] didn't do what he said he does
[1:49:25] so then when I started to go down the
[1:49:27] platform they said no more pictures so
[1:49:31] forth because they had taken pictures in
[1:49:33] the meeting they would sell them it's
[1:49:34] not right commercializing anything that
[1:49:37] belongs to God that's not right that's
[1:49:38] the wrong thing to do so we stopped all
[1:49:41] the pictures so they didn't let pictures
[1:49:43] be taken so don't think anyone anyone
[1:49:46] think hard of Mr best I think he was
[1:49:48] sincere to he look down the row of
[1:49:50] stretchers and Cs and things laying here
[1:49:52] these people laying there with cancer
[1:49:54] it's going to be dead in a few days if
[1:49:55] God don't help them the doctors are
[1:49:57] giving up on them they've done their
[1:49:58] very best where they can't do no more I
[1:50:00] believe he sincere he said he felt sorry
[1:50:03] for those people he can't feel sorry for
[1:50:06] those people and then try to Rob
[1:50:10] them and black out the only hope they
[1:50:13] have of living how can you feel sorry
[1:50:15] for them like taking food away from a
[1:50:18] starving man and saying you feel sorry
[1:50:20] for him
[1:50:25] said I don't believe that was sincere
[1:50:26] but anyway anyhow he come running to the
[1:50:29] platform brandom yes sir as a man I
[1:50:31] admire you as a preacher I don't think
[1:50:33] much of
[1:50:35] you that's a
[1:50:38] paradox so brother brandom said that's
[1:50:42] mutually
[1:50:47] felt I don't think the prophet would say
[1:50:49] it well he did
[1:50:54] he said he walked on off the platform
[1:50:56] that was all and I said all right look I
[1:50:58] don't claim to be a Divine healer I was
[1:51:00] reminding my Lord when he came said come
[1:51:03] down they said come down and perform and
[1:51:05] let us see and we'll believe you and
[1:51:07] some devil he was on the cross they put
[1:51:09] a rag around his face and said if you'll
[1:51:11] tell us who hit you we'll believe you be
[1:51:13] a prophet he knew the woman at the well
[1:51:16] she had five husband he knew Nathaniel
[1:51:18] he knew all things he knew the fish had
[1:51:21] a corn in his mouth if you're a prophet
[1:51:23] prophesy tell us who hit you and he
[1:51:26] didn't open up his mouth and they put
[1:51:28] him on the cross said if you be the Son
[1:51:30] of God come down and let us see prove it
[1:51:32] that same Soul Spirit them preachers had
[1:51:35] back
[1:51:36] there that same Spirit lives now in
[1:51:39] other preachers right on down through
[1:51:41] every
[1:51:43] age you don't have to be a preacher to
[1:51:46] preach a gospel and stand behind the
[1:51:48] pull pit your life is a written
[1:51:51] epistle your life preaches more than
[1:51:53] anything else
[1:51:58] does said heal this one let me see heal
[1:52:00] this one he past the P of Bethesda heal
[1:52:04] one
[1:52:05] person and they was questioning him and
[1:52:08] he said he just simply said verily
[1:52:09] verily I say unto you I can do nothing
[1:52:11] except the father show me for the father
[1:52:14] loves the son and shows him what to do
[1:52:16] and He will show you greater things than
[1:52:19] the healing of this diabetic or
[1:52:20] tuberculosis or whatever that you may
[1:52:22] Marvel but I can do nothing except I see
[1:52:24] a vision of what the father has
[1:52:27] done they said well what about these
[1:52:29] lame Hal blind Twisted with Twisted all
[1:52:32] of this he said I can't heal no
[1:52:35] one this I do say when I was born up in
[1:52:39] the state of Kentucky according to my
[1:52:41] dear Mother and those that were with her
[1:52:43] and has been Vindicated through all my
[1:52:45] life there came a light in the room in
[1:52:48] that little old house there a little
[1:52:49] Shack no floor in it didn't even have a
[1:52:51] window
[1:52:53] just a little door and they pushed it
[1:52:55] around about 5:00 in the morning and
[1:52:57] that light circled in just about the
[1:52:59] breaking of day I said since that time
[1:53:01] that light has been with me it's the
[1:53:04] angel of God he met me in person a few
[1:53:06] years ago down through my life he told
[1:53:08] me things that have happened and I've
[1:53:10] told him just as he told me and I
[1:53:11] challenge anybody at any place to go to
[1:53:14] any City where I was raised or anywhere
[1:53:16] that a statement has ever been made in
[1:53:18] the name of the Lord what it came
[1:53:20] exactly the way it said it would
[1:53:27] now not by me it was by him that
[1:53:33] light I said it would it he's always
[1:53:37] told the
[1:53:38] truth he's always he said if he doesn't
[1:53:41] back up what he said he never made it he
[1:53:43] never said it but if he made the
[1:53:46] statement God will stand behind what he
[1:53:50] promised he said I don't know how that
[1:53:52] makes you feel he I don't he said don't
[1:53:54] think I'm off off my sense of balance I
[1:53:56] know where I am but I know what I'm
[1:53:58] talking about every man that's born of
[1:54:01] the spirit of God every woman knows what
[1:54:04] they're talking about that whether you
[1:54:07] can appropriate the faith I don't know
[1:54:09] but what God says it's the
[1:54:11] truth and if I told the truth he will
[1:54:14] testify to the truth and at that
[1:54:19] moment coming down over the hard and S

[2:01:25] scientific World once and for
[2:01:32] all with that light he came down for
[2:01:35] more than just a
[2:01:37] picture he came down to make a
[2:01:43] statement Revelations 10:1 I saw another
[2:01:46] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[2:01:50] clothed with a cloud and rain upon his
[2:01:52] head and his face was as it were a sun
[2:01:55] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[2:01:57] had in his hand a little book
[2:02:00] open now if you read just a few verses
[2:02:03] chapters before it was a closed book and
[2:02:06] John's weeping but now the angel has it
[2:02:09] the light has it and it's
[2:02:11] opened a change that took place and he
[2:02:14] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[2:02:16] left foot upon the earth a change had
[2:02:18] taken place I have come down to take
[2:02:20] Dominion
[2:02:22] amen and the angel which I saw stand
[2:02:24] upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up
[2:02:26] his head hand to heaven and swear by him
[2:02:28] that liveth forever and ever who created
[2:02:30] heaven and things that are in on the
[2:02:32] earth things that are there in the sea
[2:02:34] things that are in that should be time
[2:02:36] no
[2:02:39] longer time for denominational ages no
[2:02:43] longer they're no longer in power sin is
[2:02:46] no longer in
[2:02:48] power the time of darkness is over with
[2:02:52] for my people oh sure darkness is going
[2:02:55] to continue on just like it did in Egypt
[2:02:58] just like it did when Jesus was here on
[2:03:00] Earth but his people Contin saw a great
[2:03:03] light and those that sat in darkness
[2:03:05] moved to the
[2:03:08] light amen this is what he's saying the
[2:03:11] time amen of denominations and there's
[2:03:14] ideas and their Creeds and their dmas is
[2:03:17] over with
[2:03:22] it's time for a
[2:03:26] change and in the days of the voice of
[2:03:28] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:03:31] sound the mystery of God should be
[2:03:32] finished as he declared to his servants
[2:03:35] the prophets and the voice which I heard
[2:03:37] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[2:03:39] go and take the little book which is up
[2:03:41] open upon the hand of the Angel which
[2:03:43] standed upon the sea and upon the Earth
[2:03:45] and I went unto the angel and said him
[2:03:47] give me the little book and he said unto
[2:03:50] me take it and eat it up who is John
[2:03:52] representing
[2:03:53] here the bride amen there's a change of
[2:03:58] dispensation from the angel to the
[2:04:01] people amen and you take the book and
[2:04:04] you eat the book but it'll make thy
[2:04:06] belly
[2:04:07] bitter Hey listen sermons like Wednesday
[2:04:10] night's going to Bitter all to tear you
[2:04:13] up it'll get you in some soft
[2:04:17] spots I'm not even going to ask for
[2:04:19] hands how manyan his feet were stomped
[2:04:20] on
[2:04:25] but if you eat the book it's going to
[2:04:27] cause some
[2:04:29] turmoil it's going to cause all that old
[2:04:32] ungodliness to move out and that
[2:04:34] darkness and light's going to
[2:04:36] win light's going to win and light and
[2:04:39] he said but it'll be in thy mouth sweet
[2:04:40] as honey and I took the little book out
[2:04:42] the Angel's hands and ate it
[2:04:44] up eat it up and it was in my mouth
[2:04:48] sweet as honey as soon as I eat it my
[2:04:50] belly was bitter and he said thou must
[2:04:52] prophesy
[2:04:54] again it's time for a
[2:04:58] change amen from the prophet to the
[2:05:03] prophecy for the bride now now now it's
[2:05:06] not just a God above us God With Us God
[2:05:09] in us or now even God visiting a prophet
[2:05:12] it's God and a bride right and the light
[2:05:15] has come down to show there's a change
[2:05:18] that is taking place
[2:05:24] he said this bride will be the final
[2:05:27] voice to the final age I believe brother
[2:05:31] brownan was part of this bride but this
[2:05:33] bride will be the final voice to the
[2:05:36] final age
[2:05:40] yes 1 Thessalonians 5 says but of the
[2:05:43] times and Seasons Brothers you have no
[2:05:46] need I write unto
[2:05:48] you for you yourselves know perfectly
[2:05:50] that the day of the the Lord shall come
[2:05:53] as a thief in the
[2:05:55] night for when they shall say peace and
[2:05:57] safety then sudden destruction cometh
[2:05:59] upon them and travail upon a woman with
[2:06:02] child and they shall not
[2:06:04] Escape but ye Brethren are not in
[2:06:08] darkness Hallelujah I thought there'd be
[2:06:11] a few praise the Lords there cuz this is
[2:06:13] our
[2:06:16] scripture Paul even though he thought he
[2:06:18] was going to fulfill this he didn't
[2:06:21] right he didn't know there was going to
[2:06:23] be seven more Church ages the difference
[2:06:25] between us and Paul is we know we are in
[2:06:27] the last one that's
[2:06:29] right so this is speaking about the body
[2:06:32] change so this is the last age so Paul
[2:06:36] is actually writing to you hallelujah
[2:06:40] hallelujah when they shall say peace and
[2:06:42] safety then sudden destruction cometh
[2:06:44] upon them as travail upon a woman with
[2:06:46] child and they shall not Escape but ye
[2:06:49] Brethren on you're not part of this
[2:06:53] Darkness you're not part of this
[2:06:56] destruction cuz the light has come
[2:06:58] you're not part of this that that day
[2:07:01] should over or that day would take you
[2:07:02] as overtake you as a thief but ye are
[2:07:04] all the children of
[2:07:08] light the children of light and the
[2:07:10] children of the day and we are not of
[2:07:12] the night nor of Darkness therefore let
[2:07:14] us not sleep and do as others but let us
[2:07:17] watch and be sober for they that sleep
[2:07:20] sleep in the night and they that be
[2:07:22] drunken are drunken the night but let us
[2:07:24] who are of the
[2:07:26] day be sober put it on the breastplate
[2:07:29] of faith and love and for a helmet the
[2:07:31] hope of salvation for God Oh Glory for
[2:07:35] God has not appointed us to
[2:07:38] wrath woo I'm not going through the
[2:07:41] tribulation period I'm not going through
[2:07:44] the torment I'm going in a
[2:07:47] Rapture how do you know there's going to
[2:07:49] be a Rapture cuz the light is come and
[2:07:52] declare the change is upon
[2:07:57] us not appointed us to wrath but to
[2:08:00] obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[2:08:03] Christ oh God I pray this shuts ever
[2:08:06] line devil up wants to come tell our

[2:08:19] accident he didn't put you here amen for
[2:08:22] no purpose and no being and just I see
[2:08:24] if he
[2:08:26] could he put you in a certain
[2:08:30] family that believed a certain
[2:08:35] message and maybe today they don't
[2:08:37] believe it no more but God still put you
[2:08:40] there and God still is orchestrating
[2:08:42] your life and God is still moving on
[2:08:44] your behalf and God is still CU he has
[2:08:47] not appointed you to Wrath
[2:08:51] I need to say that again cuz somebody
[2:08:53] needs to hear he has not appointed you
[2:08:56] to
[2:08:59] wrath but to obtain
[2:09:03] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who
[2:09:05] died for us that whether we wake or
[2:09:09] sleep whether we alive and remain or we
[2:09:11] go by the
[2:09:12] grave we should live together with him
[2:09:16] wherefore Comfort yourselves together
[2:09:19] and edify one another even as also you
[2:09:23] do Ephesians 5 says you are were
[2:09:27] sometimes in
[2:09:28] darkness but now are ye
[2:09:32] light you Ephesians 5:8 for you were
[2:09:35] sometimes Darkness but now are ye light
[2:09:38] in the Lord therefore walk as children
[2:09:42] of the
[2:09:43] light sometimes
[2:09:45] Darkness but
[2:09:49] now was Darkness but
[2:09:53] now wasn't doubts and frustrations but
[2:09:56] now what bound but
[2:10:00] now wasn't all kinds of sin and
[2:10:02] ungodliness but now was all confused but
[2:10:09] now from that
[2:10:12] time God called you from a life of
[2:10:15] darkness by light and it has caused a
[2:10:18] change
[2:10:22] you may not know exactly the moment that
[2:10:24] happened it may not be as dramatic as it
[2:10:26] was with
[2:10:27] Saul or
[2:10:29] Moses but you just know that one day I
[2:10:32] was this and now I'm
[2:10:38] this I I believe we ought to ought to
[2:10:41] know that that we know that we know that
[2:10:43] we
[2:10:44] know but it can happen in just a
[2:10:47] moment it could happen at a quick
[2:10:49] repentance at an altar your seat or and
[2:10:51] the car
[2:10:55] wherever you say well I don't know about
[2:10:57] what I
[2:10:59] do go back a few years and look at our
[2:11:02] brother Jason Ron's
[2:11:05] Post in a car what it Miss a red light
[2:11:07] or red light something happened and got
[2:11:09] him angry and he said he
[2:11:12] cursed and it brought conviction to his
[2:11:15] heart and right there in that car he
[2:11:17] said Lord I'm
[2:11:19] sorry I want to give my myself to you
[2:11:23] God can use whatever he wants to
[2:11:27] use he used a mechanical light for
[2:11:29] goodness
[2:11:31] sakes he can use a donkey he can use
[2:11:33] whatever he
[2:11:35] wants however he
[2:11:40] wants just know that to yesterday I was
[2:11:43] one thing but today I'm
[2:11:46] different and the difference is the
[2:11:49] light the difference is
[2:11:52] him he made the difference in my
[2:11:59] life I just say I'm trying to trying to
[2:12:01] help somebody here because some people
[2:12:03] some people they look for that light to
[2:12:05] just beam and knock them off a
[2:12:07] horse it don't always happen like that
[2:12:11] it can be some situation I I heard of a
[2:12:13] young man I believe it was your nephew
[2:12:15] who just walked into his room and the
[2:12:16] pray he's a gone out in the world would
[2:12:20] maybe not even think think about God
[2:12:21] walks in his room and the angel was
[2:12:24] there and it met him and it changed him
[2:12:27] in his
[2:12:29] room I want to ask you why was that
[2:12:31] angel there well the same reason that
[2:12:33] angel came to
[2:12:34] Peter there was some people that was
[2:12:37] praying for Peter and said God we got
[2:12:40] your son over there in the jail house go
[2:12:42] get him
[2:12:44] out and sometimes it can happen in such
[2:12:46] a supernatural way it takes you a long
[2:12:48] time to believe it even happened amen he
[2:12:51] walked up to those very same people that
[2:12:53] were praying for him and he knocks on
[2:12:55] the door and d one of the girl I think
[2:12:57] it was Dorcas or somebody like that came
[2:12:59] to him open the door and say I Peter and
[2:13:01] slam the door in his
[2:13:04] face it can happen sometimes you have a
[2:13:07] hard time believing it happened but just
[2:13:09] keep
[2:13:11] watching just keep watching it'll come
[2:13:14] and it'll keep on coming it'll move and
[2:13:17] it'll keep on moving doubts will fall
[2:13:20] off chain will fall out unbelievable H
[2:13:27] off hallelujah amen let's get in one
[2:13:30] mind right now for a moment if we can
[2:13:32] all begin to pray for our loved ones and
[2:13:35] and those that are out there in prison
[2:13:37] and those that are out there and the
[2:13:39] devil is said I got guards over them
[2:13:41] they ain't coming out but a little mama
[2:13:43] will begin to pray and a daddy begin to
[2:13:45] pray and a church begin to pray and God
[2:13:48] rich in Mercy went to where they were
[2:13:54] it might be a light that gets
[2:13:57] him put
[2:13:58] up red light or whatever it is God get
[2:14:10] them go listen if you would like to from
[2:14:13] that
[2:14:14] time he says you know as a little boy
[2:14:16] girl child some things happened that you
[2:14:19] can point back to and say from that time
[2:14:22] such and such has taken place and from
[2:14:24] that time thus and thus he said maybe
[2:14:27] the immoral woman could say something
[2:14:28] like this I was a virtuous girl I was
[2:14:31] raised in a strict Christian Home by
[2:14:33] Godly father and mother one day I was
[2:14:35] just as pure as a lily until one day one
[2:14:38] night I took a ride with a certain boy
[2:14:40] and we drove up to a dance hall and from
[2:14:42] that
[2:14:44] time you can always relate back to
[2:14:47] sometime something happened
[2:14:51] whether it's good or whether it's
[2:14:53] bad he said here not long ago he was in
[2:14:56] New York City with the Dr bir he was a
[2:14:59] pastor of bethl Tabernacle they had some
[2:15:01] missions down on the calls it the Bowery
[2:15:04] he I wanted to visit
[2:15:07] it I used to hear as a little boy song
[2:15:10] It's a picture of a life on the other
[2:15:11] side someone who's fell by the way of
[2:15:12] Soul that's gone to out with the tide
[2:15:14] that might be happy some might have been
[2:15:16] happy
[2:15:17] someday there were men laying all under
[2:15:20] that great tra Vel some of them
[2:15:22] perfectly helpless laying on the street
[2:15:25] awful impure
[2:15:28] conditions there there was Chinatown
[2:15:31] just below it where they'd buy all their
[2:15:32] dope and drugs and things so I said to
[2:15:35] Dr bird perhaps these men come from real
[2:15:38] bad homes never had a
[2:15:40] chance he said very surprising brother
[2:15:43] brandham those men many of them were at
[2:15:45] one time great
[2:15:48] men hear that fellow laying over there
[2:15:51] see that fell lady I know him let's see
[2:15:53] if we can wake him up and I went over
[2:15:55] and I shook him gray whiskers all over
[2:15:56] his face stuff running from his mouth
[2:15:59] his shirt dirty he almost smelled like a
[2:16:01] pig pin I thought must be somebody's
[2:16:04] Daddy some poor soul that fell by the
[2:16:06] way I said what's your name sir and he
[2:16:09] wanted me to give him some money for a
[2:16:10] drink I said oh I can't do that I'm a
[2:16:12] minister just come to I couldn't give
[2:16:14] you money to drink I'll buy you
[2:16:15] something to

[2:16:22] condition I said no sir he began to talk
[2:16:26] to him and he said you're a minister I
[2:16:27] said yes sir he said help me up and I
[2:16:29] put my arm around and tried to stand him
[2:16:31] up he was just too helpless he just kind
[2:16:33] of squatted down on the street and
[2:16:35] follow fell over and I stooped down
[2:16:36] leaned him over on my
[2:16:38] shoulder said mister he said mister I I
[2:16:41] don't want you don't want W hard to
[2:16:43] believe my story I suppose but no more
[2:16:46] than five city blocks from here I was a
[2:16:49] president of that bank right there
[2:16:51] said sir is that true he said go ask
[2:16:54] them I said 'well what happened I come
[2:16:57] home one day where I had a lovely family
[2:16:59] and I found a Dear John Letter laying on
[2:17:01] the table I loved her so much I couldn't
[2:17:04] forget her and from that
[2:17:07] time he said there you are from that
[2:17:09] time that time marked
[2:17:12] something something marks it you can ask
[2:17:15] the drunk the alcohol when did you start
[2:17:17] drinking I never drank a day in my life
[2:17:19] until one night I was out with a bunch
[2:17:20] of fell in a little celebration took my
[2:17:22] first drink and from that time it starts
[2:17:30] something he said I talk he said I
[2:17:32] talked to a lady here not long ago
[2:17:34] trying to Rite her with her husband I
[2:17:36] said bring your husband and come see me

[2:17:45] him and see if he'll talk me back take
[2:17:46] me back I said what's so bad she said

[2:17:52] could be we moved into a neighborhood
[2:17:53] went to a church did what was right one
[2:17:56] day a tall tall dark handsome salesman
[2:17:58] knocked on a door and I invited him in
[2:18:00] and from that time I've tried to
[2:18:03] straighten up every new year and start
[2:18:05] back again but I've never been able to
[2:18:07] do it from that
[2:18:10] moment here some time ago I went to an
[2:18:12] emergency room in a certain building
[2:18:14] there was supposed to be insanity and I
[2:18:16] walked through the door and there was
[2:18:17] this lovely pretty young woman about 25
[2:18:20] years old sitting there looking at me
[2:18:22] and I said how do you do some of them in
[2:18:24] straight jackets and cursing and filled
[2:18:26] with demon power and I said well it's
[2:18:29] kind of hard to tell where to start
[2:18:30] praying first and she said if you don't
[2:18:32] mind sir start with me and I said with
[2:18:34] you she said yes sir I said you're not a
[2:18:36] patience he said I sure am well what's
[2:18:38] wrong with you said well I'm supposed
[2:18:40] I'm insane said sure don't look like it
[2:18:43] could you listen to my story certainly
[2:18:45] she said when I was a young girl brother
[2:18:47] brandham I was raised in a real
[2:18:48] Christian home I started going with a
[2:18:50] boy that smoked first thing you know I
[2:18:52] was smoking one night he spiked the coke
[2:18:54] with whiskey and started me drinking and
[2:18:56] then I started from that into
[2:18:57] prostitution and I lived in the very
[2:18:59] gutters of the blackest of hell I served
[2:19:02] four years in Catholic institution a
[2:19:04] good Shepherd's home in there I turned a
[2:19:05] new page and I said when I get out of
[2:19:07] here I'm going to go straight and I
[2:19:09] meant it but as soon as I got with that
[2:19:11] crowd again it was all over did two
[2:19:14] years in a women's State Penitentiary
[2:19:16] here in this state then I thought truly
[2:19:17] I was reformed I came home joined
[2:19:19] another church told the pastor pastor we
[2:19:21] went down the altar talked it over I
[2:19:23] just can't keep from it I it started
[2:19:25] again one night I said lady don't you
[2:19:28] want to be a real lady and have a
[2:19:29] husband and babies like a real woman she
[2:19:31] said oh with all my heart but look at me
[2:19:33] now I've tried but you haven't tried my
[2:19:36] Lord
[2:19:38] yet Hallelujah yes I have too brother
[2:19:41] brandom I've signed pledges and vows and
[2:19:43] made promises that's not what I'm
[2:19:45] talking about as oldfashioned the way it
[2:19:48] seems to be it's a devil yeah yeah he
[2:19:51] said she said I always believe that he
[2:19:54] drives you to do things you don't want
[2:19:56] to
[2:19:57] do I believe that would there be hope
[2:19:59] for me I said certainly and we knelt
[2:20:01] down and prayed and a while she raised
[2:20:03] up brother beautiful woman great soft
[2:20:05] looking eyes tears running down her
[2:20:07] cheeks he said now brother brandom I
[2:20:09] believe I'm going to go out and make a
[2:20:10] new life say sister dear you ain't done
[2:20:12] nothing but turn a page I won't doing no
[2:20:15] good you go back and do what you've done
[2:20:16] before stay until God speaks back to you
[2:20:21] we got down again together and prayed
[2:20:22] and I left her pray come back she said
[2:20:25] after a while she rose up from there and
[2:20:27] she looked around the room those big
[2:20:28] eyes looking at me she said something
[2:20:31] has happened to
[2:20:33] me and I said now you got it now you got
[2:20:37] it you don't have to learn new pages
[2:20:39] it's over
[2:20:40] with from that time she was a changed
[2:20:43] person she's married got a lovely home
[2:20:46] and two children now and you can point
[2:20:48] her fingers to at anytime something that
[2:20:51] happened to her that was Immortal
[2:20:56] Life it was a light when that light
[2:20:59] comes Life Changes there's something
[2:21:01] that can happen to a person you cannot
[2:21:04] be the same after this you meet this God
[2:21:07] you meet this light for yourself and
[2:21:08] when a man meets God he's changed
[2:21:10] something happens to him he's never the
[2:21:12] same once he meets
[2:21:14] God face to
[2:21:18] face so he talks about
[2:21:22] Abraham Abraham needed a
[2:21:25] change he done got on now on a 100 years
[2:21:29] old his wife up to about
[2:21:32] 90 it looked
[2:21:34] impossible he said but all of a sudden a
[2:21:36] light came down to earth and it picked
[2:21:40] up dust and it created a
[2:21:46] body and it created two more bodies for
[2:21:50] Angels to walk in and he comes walking
[2:21:53] down a Dusty
[2:21:55] path and Abraham looks up there those
[2:21:58] three men he said my
[2:22:01] Lord see Abraham didn't have no problem
[2:22:03] with the godhead he knew there was only
[2:22:05] one
[2:22:06] God and he goes and prepares him a meal
[2:22:09] is going to host him I think that's a
[2:22:12] good thing to do when God comes by be
[2:22:15] prepared to entertain
[2:22:17] him stay a while
[2:22:20] I think we learned a valuable lesson
[2:22:22] Wednesday night stay a while if you want
[2:22:25] more of God just stay for a moment just
[2:22:27] like when he walked down the road of me
[2:22:29] and he made on as if he was going to go
[2:22:31] further and they constrained him to come
[2:22:34] in here and eat with me and when they
[2:22:37] brought him into that inner Place into
[2:22:38] that moment he began to break bread unto
[2:22:41] them just as he did when he fed
[2:22:45] 5,000 you want more of God just stay a
[2:22:48] moment allow God to speak to you allow
[2:22:51] that's what we learned just with this
[2:22:52] girl right here she tried too quickly to
[2:22:54] get
[2:22:55] up amen we want to be prepared to allow
[2:22:59] God and to entertain him and say God I
[2:23:01] have a
[2:23:03] need I need you to speak to me I need
[2:23:05] you to touch my heart and here he had it
[2:23:09] and he goes prepares a calf sandwich and
[2:23:11] some milk and we've been hearing about
[2:23:14] it from our pastor but he needed a
[2:23:17] change he heard the promise he heard the
[2:23:21] word God had spoke to him about himself
[2:23:23] and and and his wife Sarah and how that
[2:23:25] they was going to receive a child but he
[2:23:27] knew I can't do it that's I can't do it
[2:23:29] in this Old Rag of a body I'm in that
[2:23:32] ain't possible Sarah back there fuming
[2:23:34] that
[2:23:36] morning laughing scoffing she knew she
[2:23:39] couldn't do it she had all kinds of
[2:23:41] faults and failures she needed a change
[2:23:44] but a light came
[2:23:46] down and that light be to discern her
[2:23:48] heart and begin to tell her what was was
[2:23:50] going on in her life and how she was
[2:23:52] laughing at the promise and all the
[2:23:54] things but don't worry she's going to
[2:23:56] receive a
[2:23:58] child amen and they got that promise and
[2:24:01] brother R said that light begin to
[2:24:03] change their
[2:24:05] body and it changed them from a old man
[2:24:07] and woman to a young man and woman it's
[2:24:09] a mystery of the change written right
[2:24:11] there in scripture amen we know it is
[2:24:14] common knowledge many people glass right
[2:24:16] over and one don't even know that it
[2:24:17] even happened matter of fact was was
[2:24:20] speaking to some people one time and
[2:24:22] they didn't think the Rapture even was
[2:24:23] real and we begin to show them Enoch and
[2:24:25] show them Abraham and Sarah and all
[2:24:27] these saying they say hey this is not
[2:24:29] just a
[2:24:29] fable it's written in
[2:24:34] scripture but light had to show on it
[2:24:37] and light changed these bodies from a
[2:24:39] old ragged woman to a woman a king would
[2:24:45] want and that light is changing you from
[2:24:47] an old ragged human being into somebody
[2:24:51] a king
[2:24:53] desires amen a king desireth thee he
[2:24:57] don't want you in your Rags of humanity
[2:24:59] he don't want you in your old feeble
[2:25:00] body he don't want you in your old down
[2:25:02] Tred State and your mind battles he
[2:25:05] wants you as he
[2:25:07] is so therefore he has to send the light
[2:25:11] down to produce the
[2:25:18] change and here we can read about all
[2:25:20] all the ones through the scriptures and
[2:25:21] we can go through different others again
[2:25:24] but I want to get down to a few things
[2:25:26] as we bring this down to a
[2:25:29] close of
[2:25:33] course I always get moved by the woman
[2:25:35] at the
[2:25:37] well had a lot of husbands made a lot of
[2:25:45] mistakes you had a lot of husbands
[2:25:50] a lot of people that tried to change
[2:25:51] your
[2:25:53] name come on now try to put all kind of
[2:25:57] names on you doubt unbelief
[2:26:01] fear pornography smok and drinking
[2:26:04] whatever kind of name denominational
[2:26:06] names all kind of
[2:26:08] husbands and you left
[2:26:12] one trying to get away and you're trying
[2:26:14] to find Freedom and you find yourself at
[2:26:17] a
[2:26:18] well and all in her mind she is trying
[2:26:21] on her own she had her water
[2:26:24] pot and she's walking up there to get
[2:26:27] her get some water and this voice of
[2:26:29] this little frail
[2:26:31] looking homely looking body said it was
[2:26:35] no beauty that we should desire him
[2:26:38] sitting over there and he's looking at
[2:26:40] her watching her as she walks to the
[2:26:42] well watching her she begins to dip her
[2:26:44] jug down in there to get a drink and he
[2:26:48] said woman will thou give me a
[2:26:53] drink she saidwell it ain't customary
[2:26:56] for samarit for Jew to speak to a
[2:26:58] Samaritan you know it's very
[2:27:02] religious he said if you knew who I was
[2:27:05] you would ask me of a
[2:27:07] drink and she said well ask you of a
[2:27:11] drink what good would that do you don't
[2:27:12] have a water
[2:27:14] pot the drink he wanted to give her had
[2:27:17] nothing to do with the Earthly water pot
[2:27:19] that's right
[2:27:21] and he begins to reveal himself what was
[2:27:23] it the light came to visit
[2:27:26] her and it begin to illuminate her life
[2:27:28] to the point he could tell her and I and
[2:27:31] I Can't Help It The Chosen picked it up
[2:27:34] as he begin to discern her heart and
[2:27:36] tell her what her husbands were like
[2:27:38] tell her how she liked oh he he smelt of
[2:27:41] oranges on their wedding night and she
[2:27:42] loves oranges and then I don't just just
[2:27:45] part but he begin to discern her heart
[2:27:48] begin to tell her about what she had
[2:27:49] done all all the things she had done so
[2:27:54] apparently he told her a lot of details
[2:27:56] about her life and he brings her to a
[2:27:58] point that she begins to realize this
[2:28:00] ain't more this ain't just a Jew this
[2:28:03] ain't just a Prophet this is something
[2:28:05] more than a prophet and he said that the
[2:28:07] Messiah would come he would tell us all
[2:28:09] thing he said I
[2:28:11] he and she left her water pot and ran
[2:28:15] into the city what was it the light had
[2:28:18] come and changed her
[2:28:21] so she wasn't no more worried about
[2:28:22] Earthly things she wasn't worried about
[2:28:24] her old water pot no more her other
[2:28:26] husband her name had been
[2:28:37] changed what a mighty God we speak we
