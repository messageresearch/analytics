[Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] new [Music] oh jesus [Music] jesus [Applause] [Music] we're here today to remember my papa who was a very funny man he was he could be stern and serious but he also really liked to laugh so i'm going to try to make you smile today um by sharing some short memories from our family uh little moments that made up a man's lifetime and legacy i'm going to start with a story of how our family began jerome butts met linda carroll farmer in a small town in mississippi and of course when they saw each other for the first time had no idea that they would be spending the next 57 years together um part of that is because like the rest of us they cannot see their future but also there was the small inconvenient fact that papa was dating nana's friend sander at the time it kind of slowed things down just a little bit didn't slow things down for long and later on things had rearranged nicely i'm told with the help of a lady named sister bertha and on november 27 1964 jerome butts married linda carroll farmer with sandra serving as the maid of honor uh something about papa was he had a very soft spot for animals the last few years if you knew papa you knew about his dog frankie he was absolutely crazy about that pug and i'm convinced he shared more pictures of the dog than he did his grandkids um papa could bark and sound a lot like a dog which caused a lot of grief for nana as my mom remembers papa would go into the backyard of their house start barking and howling and getting every dog in the neighborhood barking and howling along with him proving that he was a wonderful neighbor um but he had a soft spot for some animals my mom remembers a time when he rescued a baby bird took care of it and managed to train the bird to come to him whenever he whistled he tried um hunting a few times he spent several years getting hunting licenses going out waiting for the deer but whenever he saw them he would lift his gun aim but then bring the gun back down he said the deer were too pretty to kill um so after a few years of that he stopped buying the hunting license uh something you may not know about him was he had a very interesting set of scars on his leg papa served for six years of active duty with the national guard but as far as i know he never actually saw any action but he had a pistol at home and one day he was practicing with the gun and as i understand he was aiming across the street a car started driving by so he put the gun down and shot his leg the bullet went in and out a couple times from what i understand um and because papa was a big prankster when he went inside the house and showed nana told her that he had shot himself she was like oh jerome that's just ketchup but as he liked to say it was ketchup that wouldn't stop so they they did take care of it um papa was a hard worker i remember many days being at his house when he came home from work um he would clean up eat a bowl of cereal and treat his various cuts and scrapes with something called merthyalate which he told me was monkey's blood which you know i kind of questioned the myth the science of that but i recently learned that merthyolite actually had mercury in it so the monkey's blood might have been better we could talk a long time about the things that papa was there are also a few things he wasn't for example he was not a patient driver he had an absolute intolerance for drivers who were in his way or who were doing things differently from you and you definitely didn't want him in your passenger seat if you were the one driving he was also probably not the best teammate he was fiercely competitive a trait that he shared with his dad and his siblings aunt denise said you really didn't want to be on his volleyball team however he also had a soft spot in sports as my friend rebecca remembers he always pitched her a ball she could hit during the church softball games andrew remembers papa taking him and cody to the pond walking with him through the woods and how papa was always trying to pinch him with his toes joshua remembers all the cold water bottles to the neck delaney the tug of a ponytail emily remembers the tickling sessions and how abigail would get them out of those tickling sessions by squealing so loud that nana would finally tell him to quit abigail remembers how nan and papa would sweetly tolerate the musical productions in the living room everyone remembers how much he loved solitaire i have lots of little memories of papa how he loved to show off the frog in his arm he usually smelled like motor oil or old spice he would take pictures of pictures and he'd love to show them to you even if they were your pictures if you lost papa and walmart you could always find him in the tv section watching whatever was playing when he really laughed his eyes and nose would scrunch up and he would grin real big he was so excited when emily was born and he found out that she had crooked pinkies just like him his hair was thin and wispy on top and would blow around at the slightest breeze it had to be covered with either a hat or a can of hairspray to keep it from waving at you constantly he drove us crazy on facebook we're not going to say much about that one day we uh had a moment of panic when the grandkids started getting requests from him on snapchat um turns out he really just liked the filters that made him look like a dog and he quickly um got tired of the app he loved to pester people especially his mama and nana he was so proud of his family he loved to tell other people about their jobs their accomplishments their talents even their dental records were deemed worthy of his boasting he especially loved to hear his family sing and play in church and this past monday morning after getting the news that he had died i was getting ready to go to nana's and the church bells down the road started playing the song god be with you till we meet again and that was just perfect um we loved papa so much he was our patriarch and we will miss him terribly but we know that we will meet him again he'll be laughing and god will be with us until that day amen such wonderful memories of such a wonderful man now i can't leave facebook alone one of my all-time favorite is somebody had posted something uh apparently very testimonial or i can't remember exactly the post but he come under there and he said hog is good well he didn't know that there was an edit button apparently so he comes right under there and he says i meant to say god is good but i do love bacon yeah i laughed a long time oh i want to see him look upon his face amen right after this we're going to ask brother dan pruitt brother jerry and brother phillip wrong call it to come sing right after the through brother david butts is going to say a few things oh i want to see him look up on his face [Music] let me live [Music] [Music] [Music] and as i [Music] many arrows [Music] sing forever [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] in [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] all the streets of glory let me lift my voice [Music] [Music] missing [Music] is [Music] many times i'll be frightened by the storm raging [Music] [Applause] [Music] see the sun as it shines [Music] praise god [Music] satan says you're losing ground but don't you listen to him [Music] cause friend you're nearer today than you've ever ever been before so just look up and you will see that you're nearing that show you are near [Music] see the sun [Music] praise god you are hearing that's yours praise god you are nearing the snow [Music] don't get my reader yep we're all near that shore old or young doesn't matter the bible says make your call in an election sure and it doesn't matter the age but i got my notes here i'm a short-winded speaker so y'all don't get too excited but i didn't want to let this opportunity pass without saying just a few words about my dad probably one of the greatest men that i know that's lived on earth and have no doubt that he's probably the last of some of the great generations that's lived here uh when mom called me monday morning to tell me about dad as soon as i saw her number on the phone i knew it knew what it was because mom never calls me but but this sorry mom but i just immediately had the scripture come to mind it's first kings two and three i'll the first part what came to mind is when i got home i looked it up but i read the amplified version it said i go the way of all the earth be strong and show yourself a man keep the charge of the lord your god walk in his ways keep his statutes his commandments his precepts and his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses that you may do wisely and prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn this is how i want my life to be lived and i believe dad led lived his life exactly like that one of my earliest memories of dad was in the old old church uh in a service maybe brother james the one you talked about this morning where dad gave his heart to the lord was i can actually still see the picture see the color of the paneling behind my dad as he had his hands up in the air sliding down the wall just surrendering his all to the lord maybe the same service that brother jimbo was drunk out on the ramp i'm not sure but i do remember that too as kristen said all who remember my dad remembers his real gentle spirit of all the countless messages i've gotten over the past few days time after time after time they just said what a gentle man your dad was what a christian man your dad was just a sweet gentle nature he wasn't always gentle as some of my siblings can attest except maybe liz and lorian who could get by with murder but when lauren would get in trouble she'd say dad don't use the belt and he wouldn't use anything so i don't i'd never worked for me but he could be a real disciplinarian but i can honestly say every spanking i got i deserved probably not nearly what i needed but everyone was done in love and i appreciate that i learned so many skills from my dad probably wore the paint off many fenders of cars just watching him work on him and handing him tools and just learned a lot of skills that served me to this day i can look at a nut and tell you what size wrench goes on it pretty much right now he was a hard worker and like kristin said his hands were always beat up just from the type of work he is as a machinist and i always thought he was one of the strongest men that i knew just big forearms burly and uh anything he wanted to take loose or i wanted to loose i could take it to him and he could get it loose but over the past 15 years or so as i remodeled a couple of houses and he would come over to help me many many times i noticed he didn't have the same stamina the same strength and i remember thinking then that dad's getting old uh and it surprised me because you know your dad's supposed to be strong forever but even as a a weak older man he was always willing to help out even when he was building the church here he'd come and he couldn't do much but he could sweep and he did that countless times and just helped out any way he could and there's an old song that comes to mind about dad's hands and i'm not going to sing it because that would really mess you all up but i sing a few quotes with my daddy's hands or sing tell you a few lines i remember daddy's hand silently folded in prayer and reaching out to hold me when i had a nightmare you could read quite a story in the callison lines years of work and worry had left their mark behind daddy's hands were soft and kind when i was crying daddy's hands were hardest still when i'd done wrong daddy's hands were always gentle but i've come to understand there's always love in daddy's hands and he did he worked hard to supply everything that we had needed we weren't rich by any means but we never lacked and uh he just put family first all the time uh was a very selfless man when it come to his family and i'm i'm going to close with a quote from brother branham out of the law having a shadow he said death has set in this old mortal body here it's creeping it and turning it great taking it down but bless god every adam and every light and every light meter within this body will return at the resurrection to its perfection hallelujah death has no reign over righteous hallelujah the soul of man never dies when my spirits turn loose yonder with the king of spirits at the resurrection it'll scream and every atom that ever made this body when it was as strong and the best it was will zap to its place again yes sir thank you man thank you buddy amen wonderful let's sing this song when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that'll be but after through as brother philip and brother jeremy and sister say did he come and say oh sing the wondrous love of jesus see his mercy and his grace [Music] want to take [Music] see jesus [Music] but when [Music] so let us then be true and faithful trusting serving every day just one glimpse [Music] oh [Music] victory [Music] we'll be home [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i wanna [Music] jesus [Music] shame is a prison as cruel [Music] love is [Music] hold is body [Music] hold down body down [Music] when i hear that trumpet sound i'm gonna rise up [Music] is [Music] is [Music] gonna hold my body down there ain't no grave gonna hold my body down [Applause] i'm gonna rise up out of the ground [Music] gonna hold my body down [Music] was crucified he took back every key [Music] gonna hold my body down [Music] there ain't no [Applause] gonna hold my body down [Music] out of the i'm out of the graveyard [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there ain't no gonna hold my body down [Music] rise up [Music] gonna hold my body down [Music] there ain't no grace [Music] down [Music] amen let's stand together this time and we'll just go to prayer give you a chance to rest here just a moment from sitting and let's talk to the lord a moment father it's in the name of jesus that we bow before your throne of grace lord we thank you for the songs that we have heard sung prayers that have been offered to you and the testimonies lord of a wonderful life that has lived before us and we thank you for your grace upon us today we ask for the comfort of your holy spirit as we look into the word of god to take our consolation from today lord give us strength give us courage give us faith and ability in the in the years and days ahead lord keep your hands upon us we pray be with our loved ones here each one as they will go from this place today and deal with life's burdens and lord i pray that you'll lift them from the sorrows of this world and give them a joy within their hearts we pray in jesus name amen amen you can take your seats i just want to say what a wonderful legacy that um brother jerome has left in a heritage that we all have today we are richer um people because of the life that was lived among us because of brother jerome his testimony and his love for the lord and so with that we just want to greet to you as the saints of god here this afternoon and to the family of brother jerome to our guests that are here and to evening like tabernacle and to those that are streaming from wherever you are today and because we are here to pay a tribute to a giant of a man among us here at evening light tabernacle as as you know brother jerome was one of our first deacons who actively served here for for 38 years and was an honorary deacon until just this week and we certainly want to express our love to his wife's sister linda and their children lori ann tuschner and husband jeff and denise hamilton husband george and brother david butts and his wife alana and steven butts and and his wife corey and daughter elizabeth and son ben and all his grandchildren his brothers uh his sister danette and loved ones everywhere the butts family is is greatly loved and admired here at evening light tabernacle and have been pillars here in our assembly as i mentioned today at the graveside that you know it was some 40 uh 45 years ago that brother jerome had a a life-changing experience there actually it was 40 46 years ago there and um in the year was um 1975 when uh the butts family consistent of lovitt and louise and karen dinette and tim all came into the the church building one tuesday night and i had my first chance an opportunity to minister to them that night and uh then later on just within the next few days of i think it was the following sunday jerome linden laurie and david and stephen came and denise so you know we um we had this um uh wonderful addition that became a part of our church and um brother jerome held a very important position of deacon with honor and he fulfilled it in every way and he performed he performed well in that office and was faithful in fact he was maybe a little bit too faithful sometimes but he was faithful one particular time that we all still remember and laugh about today was um you know i had it was in the early 80s and i was um had advanced into the computers and and it prepared a sermon on we're using a computer and had a nine print uh nine hole uh print uh feeder feed printer there and you know it's the kind that every page is connected and on the sides were the little holes there that pulled it through the printer and so before i went to the pulpit that day i had taken the side tabs off and and discarded them but i had forgot to uh disconnect every paper from the one in front of it or behind it and um so as i as i um came up to speak i found that i had a sermon and it was a big fan fold page paper like this you know and and uh so i i tore up the first page and put it there in front of me and and as i did i noticed it was picking up on my lapel microphone you know so i said i i don't want to make that kind of noise every every few minutes you know ripping on this so brother jerome was sitting there close and i handed him my notes and i said here take these to the back room there and tear these apart for me so in a few minutes um he came back and sat down and and uh he you know was looking like a job well done and uh i looked over at him and i said where are my notes and he said you told me to take them back there and tear them apart or tear them up the man had taken my notes and shredded them into pieces like i said he was faithful to a fault [Laughter] amen but anyway you know it was moments like that that was very special very precious in our memories today and and um we are so thankful for brother jerome and his life his testimony his service to the lord and he's a great friend great brother i want to read the scripture of john 14 verse 1 that's because we want to take our consolation today from the word of god that's where we get our comfort from and the bible said let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go i and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also so you know when we come to these moments like today it really makes us long for another world a place called heaven where there's just no more suffering people as i went to brother jerome's bedside in the last few weeks and went several times in the last month but just um as early or late as uh saturday before he passed on monday i was there and spoke with him we got to share our last i love yous and say our goodbyes and i talked to him about you know where he was going and the darkness that would enfold the light that would come and to move toward that light and and um i i i reminisced you know at a moment and i think it's special in a moment like this that when his daddy brother butts was crossing over just um just a few days before he would sat up in the bed in the in the rehab room of his hospital and he would cup his hands to his mouth and and he would he would yell out and look out into the distance somewhere and calling to someone well it alarmed the family my wife karen called me and said daddy is really um acting strange and we don't know what to think said come come quickly so i was coming back from shreveport and i i rushed over into the hospital room and i spent a few minutes with them and then asked to if i could just have a few moments private with him and everybody left and i sat down with him and i said papaw i said you know i i know you're nearing that shore and i i know in this moment uh they're they're telling me you're seeing things or something is happening and i want to know about it he said well yeah he said uh he said don't you see the big white bird standing right behind you and and i looked and i said no i don't see any birds but you know i don't doubt they're there i said what it is is you're blending dimensions you're still here but you're already beginning to see the other side and i said but who are you calling to and and uh he said why it's my brother my sister uh estelle and iyuna and they're they're right right over there and they've been calling to me and i said well what are they saying and they he said they're saying come on over here and he said i was replying to them and answering them and so you see you know heaven is not a place of fiction heaven is a real place and it is a place where there is no sickness no sorrow no pain or death it's not a place like said of you know playing harps at all or sitting up on a cloud and our or an eternal church service where that we just sing and shout and you know do some kind of mindless chance forever no heaven is a real place and it's just the same as this is a real place in fact it's really more real than here because this is only a shadow or the negative of the positive there so heaven is a real place that we're going to where we will go to enjoy we're going to live we're going to a real eternal life where we will work where we will communicate with one another for some of you that wasn't there this morning i referred to brother ron spencer having a recent dream of his father-in-law uh who's passed over just just uh came to him in a dream the other night and and uh he was a young man and he said ronald is really wonderful over here said um why he said i'm getting to meet new people all the time and he said you know that those young people that were killed in a plane wreck here the other day said are here some years back now where uh some of some acquaintances that we knew that the young people were using a small plane and flying into the grand canyon and and crashed and uh all four of them were killed and and said you know i i i've been talking to them and hearing their story you see heaven's not a place uh that is just a fiction it's not a place of boredom it's not a not a place of of an eternal church service where we just sing countless songs but rather it's a place where we live in a body without sin or sickness or pain and we'll be there with many others people that we love and finally upon a restored earth will live in a place of gardens and rivers and mountains and untold adventures and this is what heaven is so referring to the coming heaven or the to the coming of heaven which will be on the earth the bible said we will be there and are offspring with us so you see it's a place that we will gather with our families and be a part of a great eternity laying ahead and this life that we're living in is only a preparation a place of preparation for that life this is at best temporary and we know that jesus will return to the earth in a visible body for a church that has redeemed the bride and take her out of here and regardless of what comes or what goes or fashions or or what people say or the popular trends you know they can go on in total darkness if they want to and believe anything they will waste but jesus christ will return again and we'll be caught up to meet the lord in the air think of that missing people that they won't be able to see you anymore the world will not but you'll be getting together with the rest of the group and we're looking forward to that time for those that we speak of as dead or not dead they are only asleep and that's only referring to their body because there there's no soul sleeping they're just active talking walking enjoying one another embracing hearing one another's story sharing the most wonderful moments together and they're they are enjoying life a greater life than this life and you see when it comes to temporary of course this life is temporary because god meant it to be so because we cannot live in this life of evil and sin in this world uh and and continue to live in eternally in in these bodies of decay and of humiliation so god puts a time limit upon these bodies but he puts no time limit upon his children because we will be with him through the eternal ages but who what is temporary is satan satan is temporary he is not eternal his kingdom his life of sin and death and sorrow it will all end and it will give way to a place of peace and joy and love that is what is in the kingdom of god also sin is temporary it will have a sin one day evil will all come to an end sickness is temporary cancer and aging is only temporary and now you know the the condition that tormented brother jerome is now dead the cancer that he once fought is now dead the old age problems that's all gone but he is not he is alive he's in a new body he is young he is whole he can be felt and he can be touched and that's it there is absolutely no end to a child of god we came from god and we're going back to god we were eternal in his thoughts and we are eternal now we are not temporary beings but this life that we now live in is temporary and as i said god meant it to be so now originally mankind lived in paradise and this present world this earth in his fallen condition it's a poor and dim reflection of that paradise you see that paradise was actually heaven on earth from for man man enjoyed heaven until sin entered the picture man was immortal but when sin came human life became temporary because a merciful god will not allow us to live in the state of decay and trouble and sorrow so he only allows it for a certain time and some of us have that time with long days upon the earth and others with a much shorter time but you cannot stay in this mortal life forever you see god did not bring sin and sickness no you can't blame that on god sin and sickness and the sorrow it brings it came by man's own choice he chose to partake of knowledge and through that he would come to know both good and evil but when god made it everything was good till man messed it up you see as we reflect upon that we remember in the beginning the bible tells you he made the light and said it was good he would make them the waters and then separate the waters and the earth and the dry land the gathering together the waters called the seas and god said that's good and then he would look again and begin to bring up all kinds of seed now it was not an evolution but it was like an evolution god would start with the smaller things of life and he would create and be and bring it up from from nothingness and from smallness into greatness and from one to greater species until finally he would make man so he would make the grass and the herbs of the fields and the trees and and god said that's good and and then he he would he he made the lights to rule the days and and and separated light from darkness and let light shine upon the earth removing the the great cover that was upon the earth and the waters then he would call out of the waters to come abundant life and there would be fishes and there would be um fowls of the air then that would fly in the heavens and beasts of every kind and ever as as he did this he looked at it and he said it's it's all good and and then six times he would say it is good and finally after everything that he had created he was so satisfied with the goodness of what he had created and saw everything that he made and then he said behold it is very good you see god made everything on earth perfect maybe good made it for his children to enjoy just like heaven will be in fact earth was as it was an extension of heaven so eden was a paradise of perfection it was literally heaven on the earth and in god's eating there was no death there was no grace there we we were never to have to experience the heartache of separation that would be caused by death yet there was that potential that life could be turned to death and the earth turned to satan's rule where death would reign that potential was there but it was not there without a warning from god first that saying that they were not to partake of the knowledge of the tree of good and evil because by partaking of that knowledge they would come to know death they would come to no sorrow they wouldn't come to know heart-wrenching pain and taken of this knowledge would become the reason that we would need doctors and hospitals and medicines to try to alleviate the suffering and the pain of mankind but the fruit of knowledge itself would cause the sorrow that we would feel today and its fruit would cause every grave upon the earth and the tears of sorrow we would lay our loved ones and but god was diligent he did his part he didn't make a man um as the animals without a choice he put a soul with him and that soul is a choice chamber and so he had the ability to choose and he could choose between life or death and he chose the knowledge of evil of good and evil which would bring about death instead of life and he left life to experience all kinds of evil all kinds of sorrow and trouble you see god did not want men to die god never wanted us to have to have a service like we've had today when we planted a seed in the soil and and talked about a resurrection god never wanted that for man he never wanted us to ever have to talk about somebody in in past tense in this life he he wanted it to be an endless joy that's the way he made it and so he didn't want man to die it was never his will he didn't want to make the man to experience pain suffering but yet he didn't force his will upon man but rather he left it to his choice and for a time we don't know how long it could have been millions of years it could have been a thousand it could have been a day we don't know but for a time man enjoyed heaven on earth in god's eden where everything was good think about it never a fear never a worry never a problem never talking about how bad the weather was never talking about oh it's too hot or is too cold or this is miserable it was all one great big joy and so he man enjoyed heaven on earth where everything was good but then they chose knowledge and took of the tree of death and now every human would have to be born in bodies that are mortal and because they are mortal they get injured or sick and they die our first parents would enjoy life like that for many who knows how long but then they would have to come to know them because of their choice the pain of separation when jealousy turned to hate and produced the first murder where one brother killed another and their son abel died and and then they would become the first tears to at a graveside the first funeral the first separation and the first of a long line of death and dying so you see there was two trees man was made to give a choice of one or the other the tree of life which would represent christ or the tree of death which would represent satan and his knowledge and when man refused to obey god and his warnings and took a bite from that tree of knowledge then deaths and then entered in and man has tried with his knowledge to bring back health and happiness and peace and but everything that comes from that tree of knowledge also has evil with it even as we try to help mankind with medication and and science tries to do it all has its evil side effects we make travel easier with cars and trucks but with it comes poisonous gases that pollutes the atmosphere and the air that we breathe and horrible accidents will happen that will shorten our life men bit off the tree of knowledge bit off gun powder and it killed his brother has been off the tree of knowledge and and bit off um nuclear bombs by which he will threatens now to to destroy all life upon the earth but there was another tree in the garden and it was not a tree of death it was a tree of life and when jesus came he came as the fruit from that tree of life and even as he was life he was a giver of life and he said i am the bread that came down from god out of heaven that if a man will eat of me he will never die for he says in john 6 47 verily verily i've seen you he that believeth on me hath eternal life i am that bread of life he would say in verse 50 this is the bread that cometh down from heaven that if a man may eat thereof may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world so here jesus comes that after man had brought sin to the earth and defiled his purity god immediately would start bringing reconciliation to man and all this time since the fall of man um from life there god has been working to bring heaven back to man again and so in the very instance of the fall when when man was going out of the garden and leaving heaven's atmosphere cursed and sent out because of disobedience at that same time god released a plan that he would become the seed he would be the seed of the woman who would bruise the head of the serpent and he would deliver man from the from the fear of death and that's why jesus came that when man couldn't bring heaven down upon the earth god came to earth and brought heaven down and while upon the earth jesus showed and revealed his plan of reconciliation and everything he did when he attended funerals he raised the dead when he you see when he met a blind man he opened the eyes of the blind to show i am the restorer i am the one who brings life and from that life i'm restoring sight he healed the leper to show he is the lord over the most dreaded diseases and as a man jesus faced every trial and hurt that is known to man and he came to bear the penalty of sin to make a path to heaven and as the promised seed he was bruised he was ground to make bread so that we could eat and partake of the fruit of the tree of his life and live forever and jesus came to make the way back from man to live eternally he came to make the way back to life again a life of heaven and it was this clear path to life and from death that jesus made for us but however when brother jerome when his old house could no longer sustain him because it was broken down by age and illness jesus was there to receive him and give him a complete health and a new house one not made with hands one that this body at best only reflects a poor image of and i must say to the family here at this moment this time you have your right to your time of mourning but it may need not be for years and years it can be difficult i'll tell you from experience it'll come sometimes very difficult with waves of emotion sometimes it'll creep up and spill over at the most unexpected times but you know like an eagle blown down in a storm we don't have to stay down we can right now plan to rise again to rise above our grief i'll just tell you may not comfort us much but actually millions times millions have been exactly where you are today and at some point you have to open the door to allow the fresh winds of joy to blow through your wings where you can fly in the heavens again and i've had to do the same thing after it just experienced the loss of my own wife jerome's sister some nearly 11 months ago now and sometimes people get some odd ideas you know jesus he just came and took our loved one from us that's a cruel god that would take a young child or our loving parents or a grandparent that we loved our spouse and just jerk them out of our arms and take them into heaven that that's a cruel god to take him away from us god doesn't do that god does not come and forcibly take our loved ones from our families and from our beloved friends but rather when our bodies can no longer work when the heart quits beating jesus is there to receive them to give them a new body a body from heaven one that can't die one that will never get sick one that will never sorrow or ever have pain i go to prepare a place these are the words of jesus this place will be heaven for you so that when your mortal frame can no longer sustain life anymore i'll receive you into a mansion now sometimes we think mansions all will be gold knobs and all beautiful sitting up on a hill and radiant and oh my everything is just exclusive and and more more beauty than you can ever wonder the real mansion is a new body the real mansion that he went to prepare for you a way to enter out of mortal life into immortal life and to live in a mansion this house we live in at best is a pest house it is far from a mansion it decays and as the song would say you know about the old house we're living in is needing repair and the windows and and the shutters are letting in the cold cold air and and you know the whole thought of it is is that this body here can only sustain life for just a little while and it's only a temporary dwelling place and i want to say thank god it's only temporary thank god that there is a door called death that we can enter into that no longer has to scare us as believers but we can enter in there knowing that we will or enter into life into the joys of of that has been prepared from the foundation of the world that day of brother jerome's passing i can think we can all envision that glorious entrance that happens as the saints eagerly await to welcome the new arrivals i think of jerome how many times that i saw him exhibit his his uh his little trait that he had a lot of times you know and get out off from work he would show he still had some energy left after the day was over and walking out with from from his work he would jump up and click his heels together i can just imagine the other day about eight o'clock in the morning when he drew this last breath he stepped over there into that bluegrass field and looked around for a moment and realized where he was and the kind of clothes he had on he no longer was wearing the rags the old chattered garment of age with gray hair he was young again his hands were new he could look down his feet was new i can imagine all of a sudden he just jumped up and clicked his heels together amen you see when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and he saw that wonderful place he said they were coming to him by the millions and they were screaming with the light and and many of them were just clapping him on the back saying we knew you were coming you you finally arrived and i think of it when my own wife pastor 11 months ago you know just the night before that she passed there she had been laying comatose and unresponsive for two weeks had moved a muscle and had been you know had not talked had not opened her eyes and not responded for right at two weeks and in the middle of the night i get a call from the hospital there and said mr pruitt we have to inform you we found your wife on the floor and i said no how did that happen they said we don't know i said where the rails up yes they were all up except the end one on the end of the bed and to get down there she would have to scoot down to the end of the bed and then throw her feet on the side and she said it was as if she stood up and put her feet on the floor and having her the little socks on slid there on the floor and sat down and laid over and that's how we found her we just been out of the room 10 minutes you see she was reaching for that supernatural realm no doubt she was already seeing the other side and and was already moving out of her bed reaching moving toward that you see just a few days before her passing one of our brothers here had a he's a very solid christian never wanted to make up stuff and whose words can be trusted but about six o'clock in the morning he was awakened and there as he was awake a man came walking into his bedroom holding a parchment paper in his hand of an official document and the angel said this is the status to certify that karen pruitt is to be ushered to the other side and so what does this tell us it tells us that his eyes on the sparrow in the smallest details of life so i know that he watches me he's got our lives in his hands he has us in his control our days are numbered here upon the earth and he limits the time of our suffering here you see you see satan could not drown noah in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he couldn't burn the hebrew children up until the purpose of god was finished he could not kill job with boils and and troubles until the purpose of god had been finished lions could not eat daniel until god's purpose had been finished and neither could death and old age take abraham until the purpose of god is finished and neither can he take you or me until god's purpose of our life here is finished and our brother jerome his life was certainly not without purpose nope god used him as a vessel to support me as this pastor to support this church to help us to herald the message around the world he helped to make this church what it is today and yet today is not the end life must go on this church must go on as i preached to you recently that we're at a junction this is part of that junction the family must go on and today we are still here as mortals but brother jerome is not he has entered the realms of the immortal you see jerome had a terminal disease as we all do think of it you'd be shocked if the doctor told you you're terminally ill but i'm telling you today you've got a terminal situation going on the current death rate of your condition called mortality is 100 and unless jesus comes we are all going to die and we don't like to think about it but you see we are forced to have to think about our own mortality and and of course that means that worldwide three people die every second that means 180 die every minute that means nearly 11 000 every hour and since the bible is right about what happens to his after death it means that more than 250 000 people every day either go to heaven or hell so we got to be prepared we got to be prepared to leave this realm of mortality and to enter the realm of the immortal and it's going to happen by death or by rapture so what will you have done with your life you know brother drum gives me a whole lot to work with unfortunately i have buried some that didn't give leave me much to say but brother jerome gave me a life that i could we could talk about hours of a christian life and christian examples and and i'll tell you this you want to see you want to see his testimony you want to see his works look at his family look what god has done with him look at the heritage look at the testimony you are written epistles of his life and his testimony but the time will come where you will also have to give an account what will you do today with the rest of your life we ought to be able to walk out of here inspired by this man and his ministry to press on higher to pick up the torch that he left us by his departure that he was forced to lay down and we must now run to the finish line we got to finish the race as i spoke with brother jerome one of the last times that i spoke with him i you know he was failing to thrive the doctor said and i did everything i could to kind of encourage him and say jerome you know you know i need you you know you've been my support you've been a strong arm you've been an encouragement and i still need you and the church needs you you're you you you've been a blessing to us you got to just kick yourself in the rear and and get going and you know drink water eat food do whatever you got to do get stronger get a goal in mind walk toward a perfect a well person but you see jerome had decided i'm ready to go he was fighting his last few battles his life was short short yeah it's too short even when we die at 79. but life is like that is but a vapor but james said you don't know the least thing about what may happen tomorrow or what's the nature of your life you're just a wisp a vapor a puff of smoke a mist that is visible for a little while and this disappears from this realm into midair it's gone all our strength finally turns to weakness yeah that man that was so strong to work all day on the job walk out and click his heels together since turned to vapor the bible said you've made my days a mere hand breath the span of my years is nothing before you each man's life is but a breath he says again remember how short my life is how empty and futile is this human existence no one can live forever speaking of here on the earth all will die no one can escape the power of the grave and so that reminds us that life passes quickly don't put it off don't put off what is really important you need to know that every moment slips quietly into the past and that should inspire us to make the most out of every second of our life because we're going to give an account you see even limited in regret and the should haves and the could haves and the woodhouse it should give us courage to make the best and to give the best of me every day but as we think about for a moment i want to just close you know as we as we think of this because we we are we we are really living in the very climax of this world's history and the present earth where we live is an in-between world it is touched by both heaven and hell and earth leads directly to heaven or directly to hell this life affords you a choice between two you say oh that was adam he shouldn't have done that but you see before you is set the tree of life or the tree of knowledge or death and you today have the right to choose between death and life which tree you will eat up jesus said if you eat of me you will never die because his the fruit from his tree brings us into immortal life and the fruit from the tree of knowledge only brings more sorrow and more death and finally an eternal separation from god and in to life completely for the soul that sinneth the bible said it shall die so for the believer this wretched life is the closest you will ever come to hell think of that the wretched life that we have is the closest you'll ever come to hell but for the sinner this is the closest you will ever come to heaven think of that the best of this life center is the only taste of heaven you'll ever have this present earth before it's renewed and the new jerusalem comes down upon it is an in-between world and it's touched by both heaven and earth and hell and in this dimension in this realm demons come and they inhabit people and in this realm spirits a spirit comes to inhabit people it's called the holy spirit so you're going to be possessed by one or the other and you can choose who's the king in your life so in this realm angels come angels have been seen in this realm not through the bible just in the bible days but in this day angels have been seen in this realm and they they can live they can walk they can experience things in this dimensions it's their spirits the bible said he made his angel spirits and there's one particular spirit that comes to live within us it's called the holy spirit and that's what we receive when we're born again so in this present world it's an in-between world and is touched by both heaven and hell so you've got to make a choice you're here presented a choice between life or death and you cannot go on pretending that this world is the only world we'll ever know that we'll ever live in because one breath from here is another world and that's how far away our loved one is he's just one breath away never forget you're that close you say well i can't see it i can't feel it it's but it's beyond the senses the human senses around the mortal but it's not that far away one breath and this life is only a temporary life but let me tell you you know there there is not just a heaven but there is a hell people don't want to hear about that but it's bible and you're going to go to one place or the other and it is never god's going to send you there you're going to choose to go it lays within your choice there was a man he was a an atheist a self-declared atheist he was a a great artist he made sculptures he he had his phd and an art and he was a teacher a professor his name was harold storm and he was very successful in what he did and um he was in france with his students and he was very vain very proud he was an atheist let everybody know there was no god when while he was in france on one of his tours with his artwork he took a a problem within his stomach and his bowels were cut off and he was dying and as he was dying there they were trying to get emergency surgery but be in france they and the way that it was running at that time it was a holiday and the doctors went home and the life the life given surgery that he would need to extend his life was now the chance was gone he only had a short window that this operation would have to be done and so he was in such pain and agony and as he was he was dying and he told his wife goodbye and he just turned his face to the wall as it was and and and could not and his wife was could not look upon him and was sitting there crying and and he was dying he was drawing his last breath and suddenly he was outside his body and he was looking down at his body and he was well he was fine he was wasn't sick at all and he saw his body laying there but he felt fine so he he went over to his wife and tried to speak to her and said i quit crying and i'm i'm fine i i'm i'm i'm fine now and she didn't hear him she just went on crying and he screamed at her and she could not hear and he began to curse her and say all kinds of vulgar things and she never heard there was a man in the in the company bed in the room that was also waiting on the surgery and he went over to him and he began to try to talk to him and he couldn't see him and he didn't couldn't rouse him but he said i was alive and i looked around and and i was frustrated because my wife couldn't hear me and this man and and i screamed at him and i was i said you know i i i i must walk out and see and he walked to the door and he found that there was a company of men that and women that had come there and said we're we're going to we're going to take you now you're to go with us and he said oh good he said i'm sick you know and i need this surgery and i must have it it'll spare my life and i've been waiting here yes you know follow us and we know all about it and they begin to follow me and they kept going and going and going he said surely we'd have got to the operating room but now they're moving out of that realm and to another and to another into another and they'll keep going and and and the further he goes he's and he begins to realize there's something wrong uh you know you're not what are you doing where where are we going and then they begin to mock him and curse him and make fun of him and and he he he began to protest no i'm not going with you another step and they began to punch him and pull at him and tear him tear at him and and and they pulled him down into a place of darkness and he said in this place of darkness every one of these began to tear at me and he said i was i was could handle myself i was like a could like a boxer and i was landing some blows at them and hit him back and everything else but dave was tearing at me and they tore pieces of me and they tore my eyeballs out and they tore other body parts off and and finally i was just just a mass of wretched humanity laying in the floor haunted by all of the horrible things that i'd done and in the moment he began to hear a voice that said to him pray and he says i don't believe in god i'll tell you what you get in that place you'll be a believer i don't believe in god and the voice said back to him pray and he said well i don't know how to pray i've never prayed in my life or when i was a kid maybe i might have said a bedtime prayer and you know how how can i pray what what's what shall i say and and he began to he began to think of anything you know uh god bless america my country's history and and uh you know all kinds of things uh trying to think of something about god that he could mention and he noticed when he would mention the name of jesus or speak about god it would terrify these these uh ones that was torment him around him and so he began to say it louder and he began to call out jesus jesus and as he began to call out jesus they moved further away from him and and he said if i ever wanted to believe in jesus it was now ever i ever wanted to believe that he was real i wanted to believe now and i cried out jesus help me come to me help me save me and he said from a distance i saw a light approaching and he said that light became greater and greater and out of it stepped a man and he picked me up and he took me and he put me all back together all of my broken pieces and he held me like a child to his bosom and from there he was carried through dimensions faster than than you could think into a realm of eternal bliss into realm where he saw a new jerusalem we saw redeemed people people just like him who had accepted the pardon of almighty god he could then say jesus loves me it became personal to him rising up from out of that he would live to go through the surgery and then become a preacher of the gospel telling others of the horrors of the land that we don't want to go to and of the choice that heaven offers i want you to think about it today you have a choice a man like jerome our brother can be a witness to you there is a christian life there is a power of overcoming there is a joy in serving god and there are benefits that come by serving him all the benefits are not in the land beyond but they're right here the choices that he made has had effects upon now generations of his family the choice you make well how consequences from this moment on and i'd like you to bow your head with me just a moment because i want to encourage you today to choose life you do not have to keep going down the path of sin you cannot don't have to go on pretending that everything is all right you can have that encounter with god as jerome did now 46 years ago where he gave his life to the lord and i baptized him in christian baptism the only way the only name that you can be saved in the name of jesus christ and i buried him in his old past in the name of the lord jesus christ and a watery grave and that old man had died and he rose again a new creation in christ out of that watery grave which was typing the death burial in the resurrection and water baptism and he rose to live a new life and i want to ask you today i want to invite you today to make your calling your election sure because one moment one day you will come to this very place one breath away where will you be maybe in this moment the bible said draw nigh to god he'll nigh to you perhaps in this moment and i won't even look myself i'll just let you have a private moment and look down here at the pulpit myself but maybe you just like to make just a little move toward god just maybe it's not much but just a hand that would just raise toward him and say god today i make that right choice right here as we conclude this service and we speak about this legacy and the heritage that this great man left and the testimony of his life and the power of his god i want to know that christ too and i want to have him in my life i want to have the peace and the joy that all comes with it i want to surrender my life to him maybe today you'll just slip up a hand to him right now as we pray father in the name of jesus that name that is above all names that we have taken on lord by being obedient to your word having repented of our sins as the scripture said when peter was asked those words how what must we do to be saved repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost but this promise is to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call lord i don't know if you called any today but i pray lord if there was a hand lifted up towards you lord that today will be a day that they choose life and they move from this realm into a realm of coming to know you as lord and savior king of their life and their lives can be changed forever in your presence i ask it in the name of jesus that you'll bless your people that has assembled here today this family our loved ones lord this is my family i thank you for them i thank you for what they mean to me and the blessing they have been to us and this assembly lord we our lives are richer better because of men and women like jerome and linda butts lord we thank you for them their life their testimony their love for you and for their children and i thank you lord that there are great men that are still going to be raised up great young men great young women that stand here in this last day for truth and righteousness i commit them now to you to you i ask for your peace and mercy to be theirs in jesus christ's name amen amen [Music] with [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] story [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Applause]
