[31:23] just move me out of the way Lord that
[31:25] all things that we say tonight Lord be
[31:27] pleasing to you and Lord in the right
[31:29] Spirit Lord and and Lord if if we do

[31:43] control of this this service Lord we
[31:45] thank you for your presence that's here
[31:48] Lord we thank you that your word never
[31:49] fails L we commit it now into your hands
[31:52] in Jesus name amen
[31:55] amen amen tonight
[31:58] I'm going to have a a PowerPoint that I
[32:02] that I use that way it makes it easier
[32:04] on the on the people in the booth
[32:06] whenever I have a a lot of scriptures or
[32:09] a lot of quotes it makes it easier for
[32:11] me to to do it that way so tonight we're
[32:13] going to speak to you on on called out
[32:16] to conquer called out to conquer and I
[32:20] believe as a people that we're called
[32:22] out to more than just coming out it's
[32:26] more than just than just coming out but
[32:28] we're we're called out to more even than
[32:30] just
[32:31] salvation uh but we've been called out
[32:33] to conquer and to conquer to conquer
[32:36] everything that that's placed before us
[32:38] and and not just making it by on the by
[32:40] the skin of our teeth not just barely
[32:42] getting in and and just if I can put it
[32:46] like this not just overcoming sin not
[32:49] just overcoming sin and the things of
[32:50] this world but overcoming even the the
[32:53] fruits of the curse that try to rise up
[32:55] in our flesh you know whether it be
[32:58] things you know like like even temper or
[33:00] things like that many times we get saved
[33:03] and we see things fall off of our lives
[33:05] and and we're happy about that and we
[33:07] should be but then we stay in that spot
[33:10] the rest of our lives that's as far as
[33:13] we go or as far as we progress we're
[33:15] delivered we're saved but we haven't
[33:17] gone any further and I believe that
[33:20] we're supposed to apply the token to
[33:22] every aspect of our life every part of
[33:27] our life and in other words let the
[33:28] power of God work in
[33:31] everything not not not just cleanse you
[33:34] from sin
[33:35] but some people may not look at this as
[33:37] spiritual but I'm was going to say it
[33:39] let it make you be a better
[33:41] neighbor let it make you be a better
[33:44] person a more understanding person a
[33:47] less selfish person let it operate in
[33:49] everything Conquering the parts of
[33:51] ourselves that many times we chalk up to
[33:55] personality oh that's just my
[33:56] personality and
[33:58] and yes our focus is always going to be
[34:00] spiritual it's even spiritual in this
[34:02] thought tonight but I just want us to
[34:04] see that God wants us to go forward and
[34:07] to progress and to conquer in all
[34:10] aspects of our life so with that and in
[34:14] mind we're going to turn to the
[34:15] scripture this this evening numbers 13
[34:18] and verse
[34:19] 25 numbers 13 and verse 25 and we're
[34:23] going to read down through verse 30
[34:28] it says and they returned from searching
[34:30] of the land after 40 days and they went
[34:33] and came to Moses and to Aaron and to
[34:36] all the congregation of the children of
[34:38] Israel unto the Wilderness of pan to
[34:41] Kadesh and brought back word unto them
[34:44] and unto all the congregation and showed
[34:46] them the fruit of the land and they told
[34:49] him and said we came unto the land
[34:51] whether thou sent us and surely it
[34:53] floweth with milk and honey and this is
[34:56] the fruit of
[34:59] it nevertheless the people be strong
[35:02] that dwell in the land and the cities
[35:04] are walled and very great and moreover
[35:07] we saw the children of anac there the
[35:09] amalekites dwell in the land of the
[35:12] South and the Hittites and the jebusites
[35:14] and the amorites dwell in the mountains
[35:16] and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and
[35:18] by the coast of Jordan and Caleb stealed
[35:21] the people before Moses and said let us
[35:24] go up at once and possess it for we are
[35:27] well able to overcome it amen I pray
[35:30] that the Lord will add his Blessing to
[35:32] the word as you have your seats that's
[35:34] how I feel this evening about every
[35:36] trial and every tribulation and
[35:38] everything that that stands before us we
[35:40] are well able to overcome it amen we
[35:45] know this story well of The Exodus how
[35:48] how they come up out of Egypt and and
[35:50] and how that God's children were loose
[35:52] by the power of God and they came out
[35:54] under the message of a prophet it's
[35:57] something that we can relate to so
[35:58] easily and and relate it to this day how
[36:01] how they come out under the message of a
[36:03] prophet and and the ministry of that
[36:05] Prophet was accompanied by signs and
[36:08] wonders vindicating that God was with
[36:11] him amen and it Vindicated that what he
[36:13] told them was the truth and and we know
[36:16] that they journeyed and and as they
[36:18] journeyed that that the Lord went before
[36:20] them by day in a pillar of cloud and he
[36:23] also went before them by night in a
[36:25] pillar of fire and and we know all the
[36:28] the the amazing things that happened
[36:29] along the way the Red Sea was opened and
[36:32] Mana rained down from heaven and bitter
[36:35] Waters were made sweet and water came
[36:37] out of the Rock and and what was it it
[36:39] was just God continually showing them
[36:42] that I'm in your midst no matter what
[36:44] you have need of no matter what you come
[36:46] up against don't worry I'm with you I'm
[36:48] in your midst I'm going to supply your
[36:51] every need and and and they were moving
[36:53] under a mighty message once again
[36:55] something we can relate to We Are moving
[36:58] in this day under the most powerful
[36:59] message that has ever struck the face of
[37:02] the Earth and and yes there had there
[37:03] had been trials but God had delivered
[37:06] can we testify to that and there had
[37:08] been hardships but God's mercy sustained
[37:11] them and that they came and they fought
[37:13] with amalec and they won and and and and
[37:16] even after they made the golden calf and
[37:18] angered God so much even then he still
[37:21] came and and and in Exodus 34 he renews
[37:24] his promise and his Covenant with them
[37:27] he says behold I make a covenant beh
[37:31] before all thy people I will do Marvels
[37:34] such as have not been done in all the
[37:36] Earth nor in any nation in all the
[37:38] people amongst which Thou Art shall see
[37:41] the work of the Lord for it is a
[37:43] terrible thing that I will do with thee
[37:46] observe thou that which I command thee
[37:48] this day behold now Focus right here
[37:52] behold I drive out before Thee the
[37:55] Amorite and the Canaanite and the itte
[37:58] and the perizzite and the hibit and the
[38:01] jebusite and you know if each one of us
[38:04] began and would go back to the beginning
[38:05] of our Christian walk I feel like we
[38:08] would all have a list similar to the
[38:10] list that that Israel experienced to
[38:12] where when we came up against something
[38:14] we didn't know what was going to happen
[38:15] God parted the waters and let us go
[38:17] through when we came up against enemies
[38:19] that we didn't know how we were going to
[38:20] defeat God came down and defeated those
[38:23] enemies for us when we didn't know how
[38:25] to pay the bills when we didn't know
[38:27] where where where you know when all our
[38:29] friends turned against us he was there
[38:31] in every situation we have a testimony
[38:34] that can match up to that of Israel and
[38:36] even when we have failed him how many
[38:39] times has he come back and confirmed his
[38:42] Covenant with us again look you messed
[38:44] up but I want you to know I'm still with
[38:46] you look you messed up but I want you to
[38:48] know I'm still going to drive out your
[38:49] enemies look you haven't done all hadn't
[38:52] kept your end of the bargain but I want
[38:54] you to know that I'm going to keep my
[38:56] end of the bargain
[38:58] every time we fall he's there saying
[39:00] look I knew you were going to fall
[39:02] that's why I died I knew you were going
[39:03] to mess up that's why I
[39:06] provided and he's there reconfirming his
[39:09] Covenant to the
[39:12] people and the thing is if we could ever
[39:15] truly get that into our hearts tonight
[39:18] that no matter what God has never left
[39:21] us no matter what God has never failed
[39:24] us no matter the situation he's seen you
[39:27] through it every time if you could get
[39:29] that truly in your heart I believe you
[39:31] could walk out of here tonight in
[39:33] perfect faith knowing I'm going to make
[39:35] it I know I'm going to overcome I know
[39:37] the promises are true because he's seen
[39:40] me through every single time he's kept
[39:43] me this far he brought me through this
[39:46] trial he brought me through this flood
[39:48] he brought me through this attack he's
[39:50] going to see me all the way through to
[39:52] the Rapture if he's kept me this far and
[39:55] he said he would never leave me and
[39:56] never forsake me and his word's always
[39:59] been true it's going to continue to be
[40:01] true you can trust in this God tonight
[40:04] amen so whatever faces you today you
[40:07] don't have to back down from it you
[40:09] don't have to back off of one promise
[40:11] that you're holding on to it it may be
[40:13] the greatest battle you've ever been in
[40:15] in your whole life but just like every
[40:18] other time let me go ahead and tell you
[40:20] the outcome you're going to win it may
[40:23] take months it may take years but you're
[40:25] going to win his promises will never
[40:27] ever fail it won't return unto him void
[40:29] you just stand there and hold up your
[40:31] end of the bargain and say I believe
[40:33] Lord and I'm going to fight for it
[40:37] amen but under that message and under
[40:40] the leadership of the pillar of fire and
[40:43] the testimony of all those victories
[40:46] they arrive at Kadesh all
[40:49] right and I realized that this is a
[40:51] major event and that this is where they
[40:54] they fail to go over and they fail to
[40:56] take the land and they fail to conquer
[40:57] all that God has given them so I don't
[41:00] mean to
[41:01] trivialize this at all or make it seem
[41:03] like it's not such a big thing but as we
[41:07] journey you're going to face Kadesh over
[41:10] and over and over and over again you're
[41:14] going to have many situations where you
[41:16] stand at Kadesh in your life times where
[41:19] you have to decide whether or not you're
[41:22] going to trust trust God and press in or
[41:25] whether you're going to sit there and
[41:26] allow the circumstances to be stacked up
[41:28] in a certain way that makes you back off
[41:31] as a matter of fact we kind of every
[41:33] time we get up look in the mirror every
[41:35] single day we stand at a Cades what am I
[41:37] going to do today am I going to hold my
[41:40] ground today am I going to hold the
[41:42] faith today am I going to stand today
[41:46] because every single day circumstances
[41:48] are going to be stacked up against you
[41:49] that's just the world we live in as a
[41:51] matter of fact facts will be stacked up
[41:53] against you you can stack facts in any
[41:55] way you want to present an argument the
[41:57] devil's really really really good at it
[41:59] as a matter of fact they used facts at
[42:02] Kadesh there's Giants in the land
[42:04] there's walled cities those were facts
[42:07] those those weren't lies they were
[42:09] telling the truth but they took those
[42:11] very facts things that they should have
[42:12] just looked at and said that's fine
[42:14] that's just that's what we're going to
[42:15] overcome that's what we're going to
[42:17] conquer but they allowed the fact
[42:18] stacked up in a certain way to make them
[42:20] say let's turn around and let's go back
[42:23] we can't do it listen brde of Jesus
[42:25] Christ there is nothing that you can't
[42:28] do there is no devil you can't conquer
[42:30] there is no stronghold you can't possess
[42:32] tonight because he's already promised it
[42:35] to
[42:36] you
[42:38] amen we face this every single day as we
[42:41] war with our
[42:43] flesh every single day are you going to
[42:46] conquer today are you going to rise to
[42:49] the challenge today and as we go through
[42:52] this thought tonight I want you to make
[42:53] it
[42:54] personal this isn't a group thing
[42:57] tonight this isn't a church thing
[42:59] tonight this is a you thing tonight this
[43:02] is a me thing tonight Caleb showed that
[43:05] it was personal even with with with his
[43:07] testimony and his life in other words
[43:09] the whole group of them said we can't do
[43:12] it but he showed it's not a group thing
[43:14] it's an individual thing he said look I
[43:16] don't care what you guys do give me my
[43:18] Mountain I don't care what you decide to
[43:21] do I'm going on with Jesus I don't care
[43:23] if you don't possess it I'm going to
[43:25] this is a me thing I'm going to stand
[43:28] for what the word said I'm going to take
[43:30] what God Said I can have and you have to
[43:33] make that same decision for you he said
[43:36] I didn't come to play church I didn't
[43:38] come all this way to go back to Egypt
[43:40] I'm not going to be a slave again I came
[43:42] to conquer I came to win and I believe
[43:46] that's the attitude of every son and
[43:48] daughter of God you've been called out
[43:51] to take the land we haven't been called
[43:53] out to wander in the wilderness that's
[43:56] not what we were called called out for
[43:57] you've been called out to take the land
[43:59] overcome just as he overcame and in the
[44:02] end after every devil has been conquered
[44:05] you've been called to
[44:06] Rapture
[44:08] amen you've been called to conquer just
[44:10] like the groom conquered when he was
[44:12] here upon the Earth so with that in mind
[44:16] we can't be a stagnant
[44:18] people we can't be a people camp down in
[44:21] one place not moving not
[44:24] progressing people who remain in the
[44:26] same place around the same Mountain year
[44:28] after year after year going around the
[44:31] same mountain and yet
[44:33] satisfied because we're called
[44:36] out satisfied that we're a chosen people
[44:39] so were the
[44:42] Pharisees satisfied that we've been
[44:44] brought out of Egypt a lot were and
[44:46] Jesus said they're everyone
[44:48] dead satisfied that we're following
[44:51] Moses and most of them didn't enter
[44:54] in we can't be satisfied ified where
[44:57] we're at we can't just sit here and go
[45:00] around and round and round but we got to
[45:02] be a people ever progressing ever going
[45:05] forward ever taking more Lord where
[45:08] where can I get more today how can I
[45:10] gain more today where can I improve as a
[45:13] person today how can I take another step
[45:16] in my walk with you
[45:18] today and I say all that as if it's
[45:20] something easy but I'm going to go and
[45:21] tell you it's not easy at all it's never
[45:24] been easy and it's not going to be easy
[45:28] it's something you have to be willing to
[45:30] fight for and that's why so many people
[45:32] never progress because I just think it's
[45:35] going to come easy I'm G to give my
[45:36] heart to the Lord I'm gonna get saved
[45:37] I'm G get filled with the Holy Ghost I'm
[45:38] just going to walk through this thing
[45:40] it's going to be so easy I'm going to
[45:41] cruise right onto the Rapture and when
[45:44] they bump up against things and they
[45:46] bump up against trials and they run into
[45:48] heartache and they run into situation
[45:50] they Camp down right there and they go
[45:51] well this far enough I can't take
[45:54] that there's a giant in my way and I
[45:56] can't take that but that's not God's
[45:59] people God's people looks at and says my
[46:02] promise is on the other side of that
[46:03] giant so that Giant's got to fall that
[46:06] Giant's got to move that mountain in my
[46:09] way is going to hear my voice as I say
[46:12] pick thyself up and be cast into the sea
[46:14] because I've got to get to my
[46:18] promises something you got to be willing
[46:20] to fight for and as I read through these
[46:23] Scriptures it struck me how many times
[46:26] that the word tells us exactly what's
[46:28] going to
[46:29] happen it tells us exactly how it's
[46:32] going to be and then we get shook when
[46:34] it turns out it was
[46:38] right we get All Shook Up when it turns
[46:40] out it was the
[46:42] truth I want to go back to Genesis 15
[46:45] and when God talks to Abraham about this
[46:48] land and at this point he's already said
[46:50] uh told Abraham in Genesis 12:7 and also
[46:53] in Genesis 13:15 that the land was given
[46:56] to him and his seed was going to to
[46:58] possess the land but once again here in
[47:01] Genesis 15 and
[47:03] 18 He says in the same day the Lord made
[47:07] a covenant with Abram saying under thy
[47:10] seed have I given this land from the
[47:12] river of Egypt unto the Great River the
[47:14] river Euphrates now notice the canite
[47:18] the kenites and the kenites and the
[47:21] cadon ites and the Hittites and the
[47:23] perizzites and the reims and the
[47:26] amorites and the Canaanites and the
[47:28] geosites and the
[47:31] jebusites what was he saying that's
[47:33] where the chapter ends but what was he
[47:35] saying to him there what was he doing he
[47:37] he was telling Abraham Who currently
[47:39] dwells in the land and who's going to
[47:42] have to be dispossess in order for you
[47:44] to possess the land there's things
[47:46] you're going to have to dispossess in
[47:48] order for you to take that place and he
[47:51] tells Abraham at the very beginning when
[47:53] your seed goes these people are going to
[47:55] be there that's they're going to be
[47:58] there when you get there and now look
[48:01] again as he talks to Moses about the
[48:02] land in Exodus 3
[48:04] and8 and I am come down to deliver them
[48:07] out of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[48:09] bring them up out of that land unto a
[48:11] good land and a large and unto a land
[48:13] flowing with milk and honey unto the
[48:15] place of the Canaanites and the Hittites
[48:19] and the amorites and the perizzites and
[48:21] the hivites and the
[48:24] jebusites once again he tells Moses at
[48:27] this point right now here's who's living
[48:29] in that land and these are the people
[48:31] that's going to have to be dispossessed
[48:33] in order in order for Israel to claim
[48:35] their
[48:36] promises and so the spies are sent over
[48:38] to to check out the land and spy out the
[48:41] land and if you look at their testimony
[48:43] at the beginning It lines up exactly
[48:46] with the message that was given to them
[48:49] the fruits are there just like he said
[48:51] look we even brought some back the milk
[48:53] and honey is there just like he said we
[48:56] even and notice they're actually
[48:58] rejoicing in the fact that what the word
[49:01] said is the
[49:02] truth he said it was there and here it
[49:05] is he said these were there and here it
[49:08] is and wait for
[49:10] it we can't take this land because he
[49:13] said there was going to be people there
[49:15] and there they
[49:19] are think about it they got shook
[49:22] because the word was exactly right look
[49:26] at numers 13 and 29 the amalekites dwell
[49:29] in the land of the South and the
[49:32] Hittites and the jebusites and the
[49:34] amorites dwell in the mountains and the
[49:36] Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the
[49:38] coast of
[49:40] Jordan I want you to notice something
[49:42] with Caleb Caleb's a type of the True
[49:44] Believer and up to this point he doesn't
[49:46] have any reason to disagree with his
[49:48] brothers they're saying man they dwell
[49:51] there and they dwell he don't even
[49:52] realize they're saying this as a
[49:54] negative in the mind of a believer he
[49:56] just going yep that's exactly what the
[49:58] word said so far so good so far this is
[50:02] perfect they he said there'd be milk and
[50:04] honey and it was there he said there'd
[50:06] be fruits and it was there he said
[50:08] there'd be devils in the land and
[50:10] they're there and he said we could
[50:11] conquer it so we're going to conquer it
[50:13] so he responds to this yes sir and I say
[50:16] we go take it right now we're more than
[50:19] able that's Caleb's response to it let's
[50:21] go take
[50:24] it but the men that went up with him
[50:29] said we' be not able to go up against
[50:31] the
[50:32] people look they had just kept agreeing
[50:34] with the word this is the first place
[50:36] they've kind of veered
[50:39] off for they are stronger than we if you
[50:44] ever stop and think about how
[50:45] nonsensical this is Egypt was stronger
[50:48] than
[50:49] we everybody we've defeated thus far is
[50:53] stronger than we but we won anyway
[50:55] because our God God goes before us we
[50:58] want anyway cuz God's on our side but
[51:00] all of a sudden the devil turns it and
[51:03] they get the same interpreter that Eve
[51:06] had and when they
[51:08] do can't be they're stronger than
[51:13] we they go so far as saying let's make
[51:16] captains and go back to
[51:19] Egypt why well we're going to do that
[51:21] because it's exactly how the word said
[51:23] it would be it's nonsensical right but
[51:27] see what happens is is now the sword is
[51:31] being placed in their
[51:33] hand think about it they're going to
[51:35] have to take God at his word and go to
[51:37] battle they're going to have to swing a
[51:40] sword and take the land it's about it's
[51:43] going to be them squaring off face to
[51:45] face with the devil and suddenly they
[51:47] don't want no part of
[51:51] that what am I telling you I'm telling
[51:54] you that the word has told us it's going
[51:56] to be home
[51:57] Lord the word has told us it's going to
[52:00] be a fight the word has told us it's
[52:02] going to be an evil day it's going to be
[52:04] a dark day the word has told us that
[52:06] there's going to be scoffers in the land
[52:08] the word has told us that that they're
[52:10] going to ridicule you and make fun and
[52:12] that and that the love of many would wax
[52:14] cold and that there' be Rebellion like
[52:16] never before and lovers of self and
[52:18] lovers of pleasure and we look at it we
[52:21] go it's exactly like the word said it
[52:23] was it's not time to run away it's time
[52:26] to go well if all of that's true then so
[52:29] is the rest of it I am the Lord God that
[52:31] Health thee amen there's going to be a
[52:34] body change I'm going to have a church
[52:37] without spot a wrinkle if all that's
[52:39] true then so is this he's my healer he's
[52:43] my deliverer he's my savior He's My All
[52:45] In All Because the word is the
[52:50] truth we were told that we were going to
[52:52] have to fight brother Brandon would say
[52:54] for every single inch of ground
[52:59] that's why he would preach sermons like
[53:00] how can I
[53:01] overcome possessing the gates of the
[53:05] enemy we were told we were warned and
[53:08] now as we press into the to take the
[53:11] land and as we try to take another step
[53:13] we're faced with the reality that it's
[53:15] just exactly like they said it was going
[53:18] to
[53:19] be it's just as evil as the word said it
[53:22] would be there are attacks coming on
[53:25] every single side
[53:27] and now as you stand at
[53:30] Kadesh having seen the
[53:32] fruits as you stand at cadis knowing
[53:36] it's the
[53:37] truth knowing the reality of it knowing
[53:40] that it's
[53:40] real and the enemy stands over there
[53:43] right on top of your promise and he's
[53:46] daring you to take that next
[53:49] step it's going to be
[53:52] hard it's going to be a
[53:54] battle it's going to be tough
[53:57] and he's daring you to take the
[53:59] land and so I ask you will you
[54:04] conquer will you take the land will you
[54:07] take the next step there's evidence
[54:09] there we've seen the evidence we've seen
[54:12] that it's real over and over again God's
[54:14] been Faithful over and over again we got
[54:17] testimonies right here of healings over
[54:19] and over again salvation over and over
[54:22] again marriage is turned around
[54:25] financial trouble that that that was
[54:26] turned around you've seen situations
[54:29] that seemed absolutely impossible get
[54:31] resolved by God it's the fruit of the
[54:33] land it's a real land it's a real place
[54:36] there's real power it's exactly what the
[54:38] word said it would be but battles await
[54:44] you brother bam says you fight every
[54:47] inch of the way he said God down in
[54:50] Egypt give Palestine to the Jews but
[54:53] they fought every inch of the way God
[54:56] told Joshua everywhere The Souls of your
[54:58] feet rest that have I given you
[55:00] footsteps mean Victory possession and
[55:03] just as far as you can climb into the
[55:05] kingdom of God now this is what I was
[55:08] talking about even at the beginning and
[55:09] not just being satisfied with salvation
[55:11] but let's go beyond he says if you just
[55:14] want to climb a little piece and say
[55:15] well I believe I may not have to go to
[55:18] hell but I believe that I'll be saved at
[55:19] the end if I join Church you ain't got
[55:22] much ground yet but every promise in the
[55:27] Bible is yours but you'll have to fight
[55:30] every devil guard away from it with a
[55:32] two-edged sword and claim it for
[55:35] yourself be persistent walking right
[55:38] into it notice the devil's got a guard
[55:41] sitting on every single promise but
[55:44] brother Brown says you're going to have
[55:45] to fight them away with the two-edged
[55:47] sword I loved hearing about it the other
[55:49] day that that that sword that came down
[55:51] and how it's being yielded by a hand of
[55:53] faith if you got a hand of Faith tonight
[55:55] there's some devil standing on your
[55:57] promises that you're going to have to
[55:59] fight off tonight you're going to have
[56:00] to swing the sword you're going to have
[56:02] to get bloody you're going to have to go
[56:04] into battle you're going to have to not
[56:06] be a
[56:09] coward he says amen there you are the
[56:12] believer today yet we're heir to All
[56:15] Things yet we're air to every spiritual
[56:18] blessing notice it's yours you're air to
[56:21] it every physical blessing every
[56:24] blessing the bible promises
[56:27] yet you have to fight for every inch of
[56:29] it that's the way God's got it set up
[56:32] it's always been that way you have to
[56:34] fight to possess what you know is your
[56:37] own you have to fight to possess it and
[56:40] that's what we have to do now you have
[56:44] to fight to possess what you know is
[56:47] your
[56:49] own and that's what Israel wasn't
[56:51] willing to do they weren ready they
[56:54] wern't ready to do that they didn't mind
[56:55] the come com out they didn't mind the
[56:58] provisions along the way it was great
[57:01] when God defeated Egypt by the prophet
[57:04] speaking the
[57:06] word it was great when the Red Sea
[57:08] opened and then closed again and
[57:10] destroyed their enemy because the
[57:12] prophet lifted his Rod up over the
[57:14] waters oh it was all great then it was
[57:18] great when it was God doing and it was
[57:20] the prophet doing it but now that same
[57:22] God's promising Victory but he's saying
[57:24] I'm going to use you to do it I'm going
[57:27] to put the sword in your hand and I'm
[57:29] going to send you into battle and you're
[57:31] going to go face to face with the Enemy
[57:34] the prophet ain't going to do it you're
[57:37] going to swing the sword you're going to
[57:39] have to have faith over fear you're
[57:41] going to have to face your complexes

[57:44] strains you're going to have to go in
[57:46] and Conquer this time it's up to yes
[57:49] I've already bought it yes it's already
[57:51] yours but you got to fight for what you
[57:53] know is yours

[58:03] contact it's going to be face to face
[58:05] you're going to feel the breath of the
[58:06] enemy that means it's going to get
[58:09] bloody that means you're going to be
[58:12] ridiculed that means your faith is going
[58:14] to be tried and that means you're going
[58:16] to have to put the sword in action
[58:18] you're going to have to fight for it he
[58:20] promised to pour His Spirit out on All
[58:22] Flesh you're going to have to fight for
[58:25] it he promised that that that your
[58:27] children would be saved you're going to
[58:30] have to fight for
[58:32] it he he promised that there would be a
[58:34] Rapture in this day guess what you're
[58:37] going to have to fight for it he
[58:39] promised you could have peace you're
[58:41] going to have to fight for it he
[58:43] promised you could have joy you are
[58:45] going to have to fight for it he teaches
[58:48] it over and over again you want healing
[58:50] you're going to have to fight for it
[58:53] willing to draw the sword but what a
[58:55] weapon we have the sword that's coming
[58:58] this day the open word faith is restored
[59:01] faith is elevated now take the sword and
[59:03] fight for what is yours in this
[59:10] day that's one thing that the devil
[59:12] likes to
[59:15] do don't don't let the fact that you're
[59:18] fighting for it make you think it isn't
[59:22] happening every matter of fact most
[59:25] things aren't
[59:27] instantaneous most things you got to
[59:29] hold on to and fight for and claim and
[59:32] struggle and wrestle it out like Jacob
[59:35] did it's not just going to come
[59:37] instantaneous and quick you got to be
[59:39] ready to fight for it well I left the
[59:42] World Behind and I'm following the
[59:44] message and I'm a Believer awesome now
[59:46] it's time to
[59:47] conquer now it's time to take the land
[59:50] now it's time to fight look he conquered
[59:53] when he was here and what was the whole
[59:54] point of that so he could send back his
[59:56] life he conquered now he sent back his
[59:59] life to live in you so that you could
[1:00:01] conquer and he expects you to conquer
[1:00:04] and he's telling you to swing the sword
[1:00:06] it's time for you to turn the stone
[1:00:08] loose he gave you the stone he gave you
[1:00:11] the rock he gave you fi t f AI t h he's
[1:00:15] put it there and don't just stand there
[1:00:17] slinging it around and around and around
[1:00:19] turn it loose tonight turn the word
[1:00:22] loose the power that you need is already
[1:00:24] within you but there comes a point where
[1:00:26] you got to release it and let it go to
[1:00:29] work on your
[1:00:31] behalf it's time to swing the sword it's
[1:00:34] time to to release the word I tell you
[1:00:37] what it's not time
[1:00:38] for it's not time for murmuring and
[1:00:43] complaining it's it is time for that to
[1:00:46] stop and I don't just mean about about
[1:00:49] church I mean about
[1:00:51] everything quit being a
[1:00:54] complainer brother Brown says I don't
[1:00:56] try to I I do not try to say too much
[1:00:59] about it you know around people
[1:01:01] complaining cuz I think one of the most
[1:01:04] horriblest things is to see a man or
[1:01:07] woman that's constantly
[1:01:09] complaining
[1:01:11] amen I've always thought God keep me
[1:01:15] from it well I bet the prophet was
[1:01:18] always praying about all these real deep
[1:01:20] things and all that and he's going to
[1:01:21] run praying God keep me from complaining
[1:01:26] we got to apply things
[1:01:29] practically God keep me from it see that
[1:01:33] that weakens Faith all the time you
[1:01:36] know and it doesn't just weaken your own
[1:01:39] faith it wears on the people that have
[1:01:41] to hear it
[1:01:44] constantly gripe and moan and gripe and
[1:01:47] moan and complain and the church this
[1:01:49] and and then my body this and this and
[1:01:54] this just stop
[1:01:57] stop complaining brother Brown says if
[1:02:00] you complain too much your water supply
[1:02:02] gets cut off look I don't know about you
[1:02:05] but I can't live very long without water
[1:02:07] we're not going to make it very long
[1:02:09] without water that's why you see people
[1:02:10] that walk around in a negative State of
[1:02:12] Mind griping and complaining they
[1:02:14] shrivel up and
[1:02:17] die I mean they may be walking around
[1:02:19] but it's a shell of a person there's no
[1:02:21] joy there there's no life there there's
[1:02:23] no overcoming there why because they're
[1:02:25] test
[1:02:26] puts them there they're a
[1:02:27] self-fulfilling
[1:02:28] prophecy they've come exactly what they
[1:02:32] say it's not a good day well guess what
[1:02:35] they're not going to have a good day
[1:02:37] that's that's just how it works they're
[1:02:38] kind of determined not to whereas some
[1:02:42] people wake up and say I'm going to have
[1:02:43] a good day it doesn't matter what comes
[1:02:46] God gave me this day I'm breathing today
[1:02:48] I got a family that loves me I I I got a
[1:02:50] church that loves me I got listen
[1:02:52] there's plenty wrong in my life just
[1:02:54] like there's plenty wrong in your life
[1:02:56] but I choose to point what's right I'm a
[1:02:58] Son of God I'm a Child of God He blesses
[1:03:01] me going and He blesses me coming he's
[1:03:04] my father and he loves me and that's
[1:03:06] enough to be positive about right
[1:03:10] there be
[1:03:13] positive testify of his goodness testify
[1:03:16] of his grace testify of his mercy and
[1:03:19] quit being a
[1:03:20] complainer quit airing out dirty laundry
[1:03:26] quit griping about your family quit
[1:03:28] griping about your spouse if you got a
[1:03:31] problem griping conquer that thing we've
[1:03:34] been called out to
[1:03:39] conquer some folks you don't know you
[1:03:41] would think God ain't never done a thing
[1:03:43] for them because you don't never hear
[1:03:45] about it but you hear about every trial
[1:03:46] the devil's put on
[1:03:49] them quit griping rise up above it and
[1:03:52] speak positive speak about the positives
[1:03:54] in your life and the goodness in your
[1:03:57] life listen attacks come and attacks can
[1:03:59] get us negative for a minute I'm not say

[1:04:05] Zippity
[1:04:08] dudah where attacks come bad days happen
[1:04:11] and you get down you'll probably have
[1:04:15] negative moments maybe a negative day
[1:04:17] but it can't be the way you live your
[1:04:19] life you got to rise above the attacks
[1:04:22] are going to come persecution is going
[1:04:24] to come facts are are going to be
[1:04:26] stacked up they like I said they use
[1:04:27] facts there at Kadesh bac's going to
[1:04:30] come and he's going to try to show you
[1:04:32] the backside of the
[1:04:34] camp think about it now he's going to
[1:04:36] show you this flaw and that flaw and
[1:04:38] this misstep and that misstep listen
[1:04:41] that that Spirit of of baac will point
[1:04:44] out the backside of the church
[1:04:47] leadership forget that for just a minute
[1:04:49] he'll point out the backside of every
[1:04:50] one of your brothers and
[1:04:54] sisters that that that's that's his
[1:04:56] that's his job he's going to he's going

[1:05:00] flaws and and and point out those things
[1:05:02] point out their Humanity point out their
[1:05:05] faults point out their failures brother
[1:05:07] brandom says he's going to point out
[1:05:08] their worst parts and never show you the
[1:05:10] whole
[1:05:12] picture that's what he does listen it's
[1:05:15] not spiritual to be able to do that
[1:05:18] anybody can
[1:05:19] criticize you catch somebody on a wrong
[1:05:21] bad day anybody can do it some people
[1:05:24] ain't got to be a bad day it's just how
[1:05:25] they roll
[1:05:26] but it's not spiritual to be critical
[1:05:29] it's not spiritual at all but what I
[1:05:31] want to know is when that comes up and
[1:05:33] that Spirit comes in the church WIll you
[1:05:35] conquer will you withstand when the
[1:05:38] backsides pointed out and the Humanity's
[1:05:39] pointed out and the flaws are pointed
[1:05:41] out when your brother's shortcomings are
[1:05:43] displayed for you to see will you
[1:05:45] conquer well brother Aaron how do you
[1:05:47] conquer that by pointing to the
[1:05:49] positives in that brother's Life by not
[1:05:51] entertaining and spreading the gossip by
[1:05:54] not letting it Sidetrack you from from
[1:05:55] the goal which is to
[1:05:59] Rapture by protecting that brother from
[1:06:01] the arrows will you be one that holds up
[1:06:04] Moses's arms when he gets weak or
[1:06:06] criticize him for being too weak to hold
[1:06:08] up his own
[1:06:10] arms where do you fall at where are you
[1:06:15] will you listen news
[1:06:17] flash evening light Tabernacle has back
[1:06:20] Parts what does that mean carnal
[1:06:24] Parts brother said they use the same
[1:06:26] tactics today if they find anything
[1:06:29] wrong amongst the elect that they can
[1:06:32] make a scandal out of they will shout it
[1:06:35] from the
[1:06:36] rooftops what is that it's the spirit of
[1:06:40] baac who's uh what is he trying to do to
[1:06:43] curse the children of Israel but if
[1:06:45] you'll go back and read that every
[1:06:47] single time he tried to curse them balam
[1:06:49] would get up and blessings would flow
[1:06:51] out of his mouth where it got to the
[1:06:53] point where bayac just said listen don't
[1:06:54] curse him don't bless them just quit
[1:06:56] talking cuz every time you open your
[1:06:58] mouth God blesses them I'm telling you
[1:07:00] let them curse let them talk bad let
[1:07:03] them put you down and the Lord just
[1:07:04] going to keep pouring out his blessings
[1:07:07] upon your life because you are a son and
[1:07:09] daughter of God and what people say
[1:07:12] about you has no
[1:07:15] effect it has
[1:07:18] nothing brother Brown says yes Israel
[1:07:22] had her back part carnal they had their
[1:07:26] side that wasn't
[1:07:31] praiseworthy
[1:07:34] yep me right there I see
[1:07:37] it but in spite of their imperfections
[1:07:41] by the purpose of God that works through
[1:07:43] election I also see me right there by
[1:07:46] grace and not by works they had the
[1:07:48] cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by
[1:07:51] night they had the smitten Rock the
[1:07:53] Brazen Serpent and the signs and wonders
[1:07:55] they were Vindicated not in themselves
[1:07:58] but in God little bride you are
[1:08:00] Vindicated not in yourself but in God he
[1:08:04] looks down he says I know you're not
[1:08:06] perfect but I am and it's my blood
[1:08:09] covering your imperfections now go take
[1:08:12] the land press the
[1:08:15] battle
[1:08:18] Hallelujah you know the first part of
[1:08:20] what the spies had
[1:08:22] said was perfect
[1:08:27] they agreed with the word they testified
[1:08:28] to its truth it's real look at the
[1:08:31] fruits we witnessed
[1:08:33] it and in our own walk in our own life
[1:08:37] if we would just stick to the original
[1:08:39] testimony that was the original
[1:08:41] testimony it's real it's true think
[1:08:44] about it now when you first fell in love
[1:08:47] with
[1:08:48] Jesus when the message first Shone light
[1:08:50] down in your heart when he first filled
[1:08:53] you with the Holy Ghost what was your
[1:08:56] testimony it's real there's the fruits
[1:08:59] I've experienced it I've seen it for
[1:09:01] myself you tell everybody you come up to
[1:09:04] and and people would ask oh it's real I
[1:09:06] I experienced it but if we're not
[1:09:08] careful when it comes time to
[1:09:10] conquer after a period of time when when
[1:09:13] when something comes up in the church or
[1:09:14] somebody says something ugly about you
[1:09:16] or family trouble comes up or sickness
[1:09:18] strikes your
[1:09:19] home and if you're not careful you'll
[1:09:22] let the second part of their testimony
[1:09:23] into your testimony
[1:09:26] instead of it's real everything's fine
[1:09:28] God's got this it's you don't understand
[1:09:30] how bad this sickness
[1:09:33] is but but he he said we're healed yeah
[1:09:35] but this is this ain't just some little
[1:09:37] cold this is big this is
[1:09:41] cancer yeah yeah but but but his word
[1:09:43] says that you know I will restore but
[1:09:45] you don't understand how long my kids
[1:09:47] have been out there you don't understand
[1:09:49] the situation you began to give voice to
[1:09:51] the strength of the very people that
[1:09:53] you're supposed to be dispos
[1:09:56] possessing the very devil you're
[1:09:58] supposed to be casting out and you're
[1:10:00] sitting there building him up propping
[1:10:02] him up by allowing the second part of
[1:10:05] the testimony to come in this trial is
[1:10:08] so big this temptation is so bad this
[1:10:11] family trait is so
[1:10:14] strong
[1:10:15] yes it's going to be a
[1:10:19] fight it's all going to be a fight it's
[1:10:22] all going to be a war brother brandom
[1:10:25] says he said I'll give it to you but
[1:10:27] it's full of giants you'll have to fight
[1:10:29] every inch of the way but every place
[1:10:32] The Souls of your footsteps that's
[1:10:34] possession go take it sure I'll be with
[1:10:38] you listen that's enough right there
[1:10:40] Lord as long as you go with me I'll go
[1:10:43] as long as you're with me in this trial
[1:10:45] I know I'm coming out as long as you're
[1:10:47] going before me I know I got nothing to
[1:10:49] worry about he said I'll go with
[1:10:52] you but that's the thing is it's easy to
[1:10:56] testify when it's fresh anybody can
[1:10:59] testify during a
[1:11:01] Revival anybody can testify and worship
[1:11:04] when they're on the Mountaintop but the
[1:11:06] minute the hardships begin they want to
[1:11:08] back up and back off and go
[1:11:11] back but real sons and
[1:11:15] daughters they got a certain kind of
[1:11:17] grit about them there's a certain type
[1:11:19] of toughness on the inside of them that
[1:11:21] they can't explain there's something put
[1:11:23] down on the inside of them that's made
[1:11:25] to believe there's something on the
[1:11:26] inside of them that's made to press on
[1:11:28] it's made to overcome it's made to win
[1:11:31] the battles It's Made To Conquer It's
[1:11:33] Made To Live eternally look I can't do
[1:11:36] it I can't keep pressing but there's
[1:11:38] something on the inside of me that's
[1:11:40] pushing and pulling and it says fulfill
[1:11:43] the word fulfill the word fulfill the
[1:11:46] word what what part am I supposed to
[1:11:47] fulfill that we're going to overcome
[1:11:50] everything that the groom left for the
[1:11:52] bride to overcome we've got to fulfill
[1:11:54] all right
[1:11:55] righteousness how we going to do it
[1:11:57] there's something on the inside of us
[1:11:59] driving us to do
[1:12:02] it oh yes even when hell's against
[1:12:06] you even when all around you is nothing
[1:12:10] but
[1:12:10] negativity it just Rises up even now my
[1:12:15] God is able even now in the fire he's
[1:12:18] going to move even now through the flood
[1:12:21] he's going to move Hallelujah and I'm
[1:12:24] going to conquer
[1:12:25] what does conquer
[1:12:27] mean conquer means to gain or acquire by
[1:12:31] Force of
[1:12:32] Arms bring under do domination or
[1:12:36] control especially by
[1:12:39] Conquest this doesn't sound like
[1:12:41] anything's being given
[1:12:44] away to gain a victory over to surmount
[1:12:48] to master to
[1:12:51] overcome see the thing about Israel and
[1:12:53] that in in that whole generation that
[1:12:55] wandered in the wilderness all those
[1:12:57] years is they never did conquer and I
[1:13:00] don't just mean at
[1:13:02] Kadesh they had never
[1:13:04] conquered not one time it was a constant
[1:13:08] failure with God bailing them out Time
[1:13:11] After Time After Time God had
[1:13:14] continually delivered them despite their
[1:13:16] attitudes continually delivered them
[1:13:19] despite their unbelief and and before
[1:13:21] kades they had never one time conquered
[1:13:23] it kades was just a repeat of what had
[1:13:25] always happened it was it was just a
[1:13:28] repeat it was the same old thing they
[1:13:30] griped at each place they griped at each
[1:13:32] hardship they griped every time they
[1:13:34] didn't see things the way Moses saw them
[1:13:38] but they were called
[1:13:39] out they were following the prophet
[1:13:42] following a
[1:13:44] message but it was a vicious
[1:13:47] cycle I know we said something about
[1:13:49] this Friday night young people but your
[1:13:50] problems don't just go
[1:13:53] away young people problems come grownup
[1:13:55] problems if you don't conquer
[1:13:57] it you got to conquer your problems you
[1:14:01] got to conquer your issues you got to
[1:14:03] bring yourself subject to the word if
[1:14:06] you constantly respond in doubt then
[1:14:09] you're going to constantly respond in
[1:14:11] doubt until you conquer that thing if if
[1:14:14] if you always respond with temper then
[1:14:17] you will always respond with temper
[1:14:19] until you conquer that thing you don't
[1:14:20] grow out of it you got to conquer that
[1:14:23] thing if it's always anger or always be
[1:14:25] anger if you always fall to the same
[1:14:27] thing then that thing's going to pop up
[1:14:29] in your life and you're going to fall to
[1:14:31] it Time After Time After Time same
[1:14:35] complex you're going to fall to it same
[1:14:37] fear you're going to fall to it it's
[1:14:39] time that you recognize I must conquer
[1:14:42] this thing by force or else it's going
[1:14:44] to raise up and be a thorn in my side
[1:14:47] every day of my life but today tonight I
[1:14:50] recognize I'm more than a conqueror I'm
[1:14:52] called to conquer and I'm going to gain
[1:14:54] a victory over this thing by Force of
[1:14:56] Arms I'm going to bring it under
[1:14:58] domination I'm going to control it with
[1:15:00] a conquest I'm going to gain a victory
[1:15:03] over the thing that has tormented me I'm
[1:15:05] going to be the Conqueror
[1:15:10] tonight you got to quit fooling
[1:15:13] yourself I got this under control no you
[1:15:19] don't no you don't until you've
[1:15:22] conquered it you don't have it under
[1:15:23] control
[1:15:25] that thing will pop it may be at six
[1:15:27] years from
[1:15:28] now but if you just buried that lust
[1:15:31] problem over the side somewhere and and
[1:15:32] ignored it and put your head in the sand
[1:15:34] say I guess that went away it'll pop
[1:15:35] back up and come again and try to try to
[1:15:37] drag you back into
[1:15:39] that until you conquer that thing until
[1:15:43] you put it underneath your foot God
[1:15:45] brought you here to conquer your bone of
[1:15:48] his bone life of his life power of his
[1:15:49] power he was the first to do it now he
[1:15:51] expects you to do it conquer
[1:15:55] what am I supposed to conquer brother
[1:15:57] and first of all you got to conquer this
[1:16:00] land you got to conquer this land right
[1:16:02] here and the way you do it is by dying
[1:16:05] out daily to your flesh and letting the
[1:16:08] Holy Ghost Reign it's not just a one
[1:16:10] time thing you got to die out every
[1:16:13] single day Paul speaks about in the
[1:16:15] scripture and brother Brandon would
[1:16:16] speak on it many many times he says now
[1:16:20] you will sin
[1:16:26] you're bound to sin because you just
[1:16:29] can't help it now notice before we run
[1:16:31] with that notice the next line but not
[1:16:35] willfully sin God's children never
[1:16:37] willfully
[1:16:39] sin he that sins willfully after he
[1:16:41] received the knowledge of Truth see
[1:16:43] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:16:44] sin but every day you're bound to sin
[1:16:48] and you're bound to be backsliding
[1:16:51] constantly
[1:16:56] wow this is why you can't go Sunday to
[1:16:59] Wednesday Wednesday to Sunday Sunday to
[1:17:01] Wednesday Youth Camp to Youth Camp it's
[1:17:02] got to be every single day that you
[1:17:05] commune with God that you pray or you
[1:17:08] read your Bible or you listen to a
[1:17:09] message whatever you do however you do
[1:17:12] it you better be doing something you're
[1:17:14] bound to be backsliding constantly so it
[1:17:17] takes a constant prayer to God Paul said
[1:17:20] I Die daily and if Paul had to Die daily
[1:17:22] how much more am I going
[1:17:25] I'm going to have to stay Dead all the
[1:17:29] time and he actually says this quite
[1:17:31] often you got to stay Dead all the time
[1:17:34] if Paul had to Die daily to stay right
[1:17:36] with God and so we'll all have to do
[1:17:38] that just die out to yourself and that's
[1:17:41] getting God's way amen see what happens
[1:17:46] is you kill the old man or you bury the
[1:17:48] old man but that old man tries to
[1:17:51] resurrect he tries to raise up time
[1:17:54] after time after time that Rebellion you
[1:17:55] conquered it's going to try to come back
[1:17:58] now if you truly conquered it you'll
[1:17:59] keep the victory over that thing but if
[1:18:02] you just pushed it aside and just let
[1:18:03] him rearm himself to come back and try
[1:18:05] again now he's coming back seven times
[1:18:08] stronger I'm talking about conquering
[1:18:11] but it's going to try to raise up don't
[1:18:13] be shocked when it tries to rear its
[1:18:14] head up again and and don't think that
[1:18:17] because you're having to fight it that
[1:18:18] oh no I must not have got anything from
[1:18:21] God I must not have really received
[1:18:23] anything because this thing coming back
[1:18:25] and it's fighting me again I must not be
[1:18:27] a real Christian because that old man's
[1:18:30] trying to
[1:18:31] resurrect the you know the devil loves
[1:18:33] to make you feel guilty for fighting
[1:18:36] battles he loves to bring Temptation and
[1:18:39] then make you feel like a failure
[1:18:40] because you were tempted you are going
[1:18:42] to fight battles and be tempted every
[1:18:44] single day of your
[1:18:46] life you're going to fight battles and
[1:18:49] be tempted but fighting a battle isn't a
[1:18:51] failure being tempted isn't a failure
[1:18:54] you're going to face Temptations you're
[1:18:55] going to face battles but you're called
[1:18:57] to conquer Temptations you're called to
[1:19:01] win those battles it's what you're
[1:19:03] called for you are an overcomer and not
[1:19:06] only have you been called for it but in
[1:19:08] this day you've been empowered for it
[1:19:11] listen whereas before you couldn't now
[1:19:13] you can whereas before you'd fall now
[1:19:16] you stand why because the life that was
[1:19:18] in him is now living on the inside of
[1:19:21] you and it's why you're here you're here
[1:19:24] to win you're here to take the land not
[1:19:26] make a captain and go back to Egypt you
[1:19:29] are going to
[1:19:32] win he says nothing less he that will
[1:19:37] follow me let him deny himself take up
[1:19:39] his cross and Die daily stay
[1:19:46] dead there on the cross that's
[1:19:50] right
[1:19:51] Agony there's several places where
[1:19:53] brother brandham actually says there's
[1:19:54] no way to
[1:19:55] conquer without suffering no way to
[1:19:58] conquer without
[1:20:00] Agony now what is the agony I thought
[1:20:03] man we're we're full of joy the joy of
[1:20:04] the Lord we're it's not a there is
[1:20:08] Agony because see it's easy to be who
[1:20:12] you are by
[1:20:15] Nature that's easy to do it's easy to
[1:20:18] revert back to family
[1:20:21] traits it it it's easy to be angry if
[1:20:24] you got temper problem think about it if
[1:20:26] you got a temper it's not hard to get
[1:20:31] angry that's
[1:20:32] easy that's not Agony that's
[1:20:35] easy it's easy to talk about people bad
[1:20:38] if you got a gossip
[1:20:40] problem but see the agony is crucifying
[1:20:43] and killing that part of yourself and
[1:20:46] keeping it dead when a situation
[1:20:48] situation arises you feel warrants
[1:20:52] temper somebody pops off to you and
[1:20:54] looks at you all crazy right then your
[1:20:57] normal response is oh it's go
[1:20:59] time let's do this
[1:21:02] now that's not Agony that's easy Agony
[1:21:06] is
[1:21:12] going
[1:21:14] Agony it
[1:21:17] hurts it
[1:21:19] hurts listen
[1:21:22] sometimes I've been accused of being
[1:21:25] smart it's wild stories out there people
[1:21:28] I'm telling
[1:21:29] you but I tell my wife all the time I
[1:21:32] should get a trophy for all the stuff I
[1:21:33] don't
[1:21:35] say they're way funnier than the stuff I
[1:21:37] do
[1:21:39] say but it hurts you're s there going
[1:21:42] that have been so funny that guy would
[1:21:44] have never spoke to me again but that
[1:21:45] have been
[1:21:47] funny it's harder to stop yourself than
[1:21:50] to just say
[1:21:52] it that's my battle God crucified that
[1:21:55] guy probably need to do it more
[1:21:57] regularly quit laughing
[1:22:01] Bethany it's a struggle you have strugg
[1:22:06] yeah you have struggles things that you
[1:22:08] got to deal with daily or else it'll get
[1:22:10] out of
[1:22:11] control battles that you got to fight
[1:22:14] you know you got to be willing to to to
[1:22:16] lay aside what you know cast down your
[1:22:18] ideas sometimes things worn a little bit
[1:22:21] of attitude you teenagers feel like
[1:22:24] and it's Agony to hold it back and
[1:22:27] smile and go yes
[1:22:30] ma'am it's hard be way easier just to
[1:22:33] pop
[1:22:34] off crucifying the flesh is Agony
[1:22:38] casting down your ideas and and
[1:22:40] crucifying your own thinking when you're
[1:22:42] confronted with the truth of the word
[1:22:43] listen it's okay to have your own idea
[1:22:46] it's okay to have your own thinking
[1:22:47] until you're presented with the word and
[1:22:49] you recognize it don't line
[1:22:51] up now you got to crucify it there's
[1:22:54] nothing wrong with your opinions we're
[1:22:56] all entitled to an opinion you're
[1:22:58] entitled to think what you want but when
[1:22:59] the word's presented to you and in its
[1:23:01] opposite crucify that
[1:23:03] thing lay it aside get rid of it let's
[1:23:08] quit allowing what we know to hinder
[1:23:11] us forget what you know and know Jesus
[1:23:15] Paul said he had to forget everything he
[1:23:17] knew to learn Christ and because of all
[1:23:19] he knew that's why he had to Die daily
[1:23:22] because if he didn't then those old
[1:23:24] thoughts of his own would begin to come
[1:23:26] in so he had to crucify that man day
[1:23:28] after
[1:23:29] day because we struggle brother BR says
[1:23:32] now I don't mean to say you went out in
[1:23:34] the world and you did this and that but
[1:23:36] you done
[1:23:38] something that's pretty broad I ain't
[1:23:41] saying you went out sinning but you done
[1:23:43] something you've got to repent and Die
[1:23:47] daily to live in Jesus Christ so every
[1:23:50] daily every day you got to die every day
[1:23:54] to to live in Christ if you want to
[1:23:57] progress spiritually there are things
[1:23:59] that you got to be willing to die out to
[1:24:01] within
[1:24:02] yourself things you got to let go we
[1:24:04] must be willing to take account of who
[1:24:07] we are and then be willing to crucify
[1:24:09] the parts that hinder us and Lam that
[1:24:12] you're called to conquer but in order to
[1:24:14] conquer you got to crucify the things
[1:24:16] that are keeping you from conquering you
[1:24:18] want Revival fires to keep going die out
[1:24:21] daily because that old man resurrected
[1:24:23] your life will kill a Revival fire real
[1:24:26] quick that old man raising up will make
[1:24:28] it all of a sudden where it's difficult
[1:24:29] for you to Worship in church sure it
[1:24:32] will it's the flesh that keeps you from
[1:24:35] praying praying through it's the flesh
[1:24:37] that keeps you from entering in on a
[1:24:39] Wednesday night it's the flesh sure the
[1:24:43] flesh is tired the spirit wants to the
[1:24:45] spirit on the inside of you you felt the
[1:24:47] joy of the Lord before you've been free
[1:24:49] in his presence before you know what
[1:24:51] it's like to get loose and you want to
[1:24:52] get loose you want to rejoice want to
[1:24:54] give him your all but you're
[1:24:58] tired you're a little bit
[1:25:01] upset In the
[1:25:04] Flesh you're mad at a brother because of
[1:25:07] something he said you got out upset
[1:25:09] about something somebody in your family
[1:25:11] did and now you're struggling just to
[1:25:13] break through in the
[1:25:15] service well if they would know it's
[1:25:17] time for you to die
[1:25:21] again but they
[1:25:24] it's time for you to die
[1:25:27] again he says I want to take my subject
[1:25:30] this morning how can I
[1:25:33] overcome now I chose this because I
[1:25:35] think it's a time that we should never
[1:25:37] let the spirit of Revival die now he's
[1:25:39] going to tell you how to never let the
[1:25:40] spirit of Revival die we've got to keep
[1:25:42] in Revival constantly revived every day
[1:25:46] how do we do it Paul said he had to Die
[1:25:48] daily that Christ could live and we must
[1:25:52] never let that Revival die within us how
[1:25:56] you have to Die daily lay down your
[1:25:58] thinking daily and press the battle
[1:26:02] listen the idea today isn't to stay
[1:26:04] where you're at the idea today is to
[1:26:07] progress and to take the land the idea
[1:26:09] isn't just come out the idea is to cross
[1:26:11] over the idea is to Rapture and the
[1:26:13] greatest enemy you have is complacency
[1:26:16] it is not your brother it is not people
[1:26:19] from another church it is not the
[1:26:21] ministry it's not your wife it is
[1:26:26] complacency getting comfortable where
[1:26:28] you are satisfaction with oneself and
[1:26:32] one achieve and one's achievements but a
[1:26:34] Christian wakes up and says I got to
[1:26:35] have more Lord I I've experienced you
[1:26:38] but I got to have more Lord that old
[1:26:40] man's trying to raise up so I'm going to
[1:26:41] crucify him today so more of your spirit
[1:26:43] can come in I'm going to cast down my
[1:26:45] ideas so so that your mind can be in my
[1:26:48] mind and I can be renewed by the word I
[1:26:51] got to have more I need a refreshing I
[1:26:53] need an outpouring that's where I'm at
[1:26:55] tonight not that I'm comfortable yes I'm
[1:26:57] thankful we were called out yes I'm
[1:26:59] thankful that we've been on a journey
[1:27:00] but tonight I want to take the land I
[1:27:02] want to take more I want to progress
[1:27:04] into more I want an outpouring in my
[1:27:07] soul today tonight right
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:16] now one of the problems we Face though
[1:27:18] is we tend to take pride at what we're
[1:27:21] best at and try to build build on that
[1:27:26] that's not how you get
[1:27:28] better you're already solid
[1:27:32] there but what you got to do instead is
[1:27:35] face what you're worst
[1:27:38] at find your weakness what is my
[1:27:40] weakness where can I improve the most
[1:27:43] and attack that area build in that area
[1:27:48] listen some
[1:27:50] people don't regularly self-reflect
[1:27:54] and it
[1:27:58] shows I believe in
[1:28:00] self-reflection looking and examining
[1:28:03] your
[1:28:04] life looking and examining yourself
[1:28:07] under a microscope look really closely
[1:28:10] how can I grow as a
[1:28:12] person how can I be a better
[1:28:15] friend brother Aon that's not very
[1:28:17] spiritual yeah it is it's testimony of
[1:28:20] who you are how can I be a better
[1:28:22] dad how can I be a better
[1:28:25] husband where can I improve what are my
[1:28:28] weaknesses basic practical things well
[1:28:32] brother Aaron sin is gone awesome I'm
[1:28:35] walking with the Lord
[1:28:37] awesome but are you willing to admit you
[1:28:39] have an abrasive personality that rubs
[1:28:41] people the wrong
[1:28:44] way thank you brother
[1:28:48] Daryl and instead of going that's just
[1:28:51] how I am making it a matter of prayer
[1:28:53] and going Lord
[1:28:55] let the same power that cleanse me from
[1:28:57] sin come and begin to mold me and make
[1:28:59] me a a more enjoyable person a more soft
[1:29:03] person with a better spirit that that
[1:29:05] that people enjoy to be
[1:29:08] around because look I know this is a big
[1:29:10] jump I'm just going to tell you Cain was
[1:29:12] told hey you got a problem but all you
[1:29:13] got to do is fix it and everything will
[1:29:14] be okay and instead of going okay he
[1:29:17] said this is just how I am you people
[1:29:20] can deal with
[1:29:22] it that's not that's not the spirit of a
[1:29:25] Christian now I'm not saying we got to
[1:29:27] go around trying to make everybody happy
[1:29:28] I think you we're mature enough to
[1:29:30] understand what I am saying though Lord
[1:29:32] work on me chisel away on the things in
[1:29:36] me that might would offend somebody in
[1:29:38] in the congregation I don't want to
[1:29:40] offend any of my brothers and sisters I
[1:29:42] I want to be in a way that that I I can
[1:29:45] be in harmony with them and I can dwell
[1:29:46] in unity with them whatever that may
[1:29:48] take Lord work on me recognize it make
[1:29:52] it a matter of Prayer
[1:29:54] you know self-reflection does you no
[1:29:57] good if we find no
[1:29:59] weaknesses it actually used to frustrate
[1:30:01] me when I was a school teacher because
[1:30:04] twice a year you got evaluated by by the
[1:30:08] district and they told me at the very
[1:30:10] beginning no matter
[1:30:13] what no matter what you may teach the
[1:30:16] most perfect lesson in the history of
[1:30:19] ever we are required by law to find two
[1:30:22] things wrong with it
[1:30:25] we are required to find two things wrong
[1:30:28] first I was frustrated by
[1:30:30] that so you mean I can't be
[1:30:35] perfect I never taught that perfect
[1:30:37] lesson anyway I'm just saying I'm just
[1:30:39] saying you know what am I even striving
[1:30:41] for but the point was no matter what try
[1:30:44] to get better you did this really good
[1:30:47] but you could get better at this I'm
[1:30:49] serving the Lord with all my heart I'm
[1:30:51] doing pretty good yeah but you could get
[1:30:52] better at it and lord said comes on
[1:30:55] Sundays and sometimes on on Wednesdays
[1:30:56] and Sundays and he comes with things and
[1:30:58] you're doing your best but he reveals
[1:31:00] things to your heart you say oh I could
[1:31:03] do better at that I could give more of
[1:31:05] myself there I can give you more Lord
[1:31:08] quit thinking I've got it down I've been
[1:31:10] serving the lord 30 Years nope we're
[1:31:12] going to find two things wrong and we're
[1:31:14] going to get better at it self-reflect
[1:31:17] and recognize there's places for me to
[1:31:19] improve as a
[1:31:22] person all of us
[1:31:28] and I don't want you to take this to an
[1:31:29] extreme this isn't about tearing
[1:31:31] yourself down it's about
[1:31:33] growing it's about progressing and not
[1:31:36] being satisfied where you are and one
[1:31:39] thing we do instead of self-reflecting
[1:31:41] that we spend too much time reflecting
[1:31:42] on others and where they can improve
[1:31:44] that's easy to
[1:31:46] see it's way easier to see where other
[1:31:48] people can get better versus yourself
[1:31:51] because it's harder to admit for
[1:31:53] ourselves
[1:31:57] this isn't to say you're not in a good
[1:31:59] place this isn't to condemn you for your
[1:32:02] failures this th this isn't to condemn
[1:32:04] you for your past the word says that
[1:32:06] there is therefore now no
[1:32:08] condemnation this isn't to try to take
[1:32:10] you backwards this is to take you
[1:32:12] forward yes I'm saved I'm called I'm
[1:32:14] chosen now let's let the power of that
[1:32:16] blood work in the in my life to the
[1:32:19] fullness in every aspect let it take
[1:32:23] complete control
[1:32:24] don't don't this isn't to encourage you
[1:32:26] to Waller in your failures and brother
[1:32:27] Aaron says I need to point out all my
[1:32:29] failures and and I need to see where I
[1:32:31] fail and we're I mess no we're not here
[1:32:33] to wallow in our failures and it's also
[1:32:35] not to encourage you to ignore them what
[1:32:37] it's saying is you have the power to
[1:32:39] face them you have the power to conquer
[1:32:42] them you can quit looking at those
[1:32:44] family traits and those cycles and going
[1:32:46] I can't I can't I can't I'm saying face
[1:32:48] it admit it's there and say I can I will
[1:32:52] I'm going to take this city I'm I'm
[1:32:53] going to take this wall I'm going to
[1:32:55] conquer this devil that has hindered me
[1:32:57] for all these
[1:33:01] years brother Bram says for God is with
[1:33:03] us then who can be against us the great
[1:33:06] morning star is over us the banner of
[1:33:09] Christ and we are bound to
[1:33:13] conquer but you can never apply the
[1:33:15] blood if you don't acknowledge the
[1:33:19] need but tonight I say it's time to
[1:33:21] overcome that thing that's been
[1:33:22] hindering you your life that crutch that
[1:33:25] you've been holding on to and I want to
[1:33:27] go through this before I close and I'm
[1:33:29] going to start bringing this
[1:33:31] down but but sometimes people don't even
[1:33:33] realize that they've crutched their
[1:33:34] whole
[1:33:36] life it's an excuse or a reason why they
[1:33:40] are the way they are listen I had to sit
[1:33:43] through a whole bunch of psychology
[1:33:44] classes in
[1:33:45] college I've dealt with kids for 15
[1:33:48] years in the school system I'm not
[1:33:51] ignorant to the fact that the way you
[1:33:54] are raised affects you that your
[1:33:57] childhood years have a huge impact on
[1:34:00] who you are I understand that and that
[1:34:03] being said I'm still going to say this
[1:34:05] you are the way you are because you
[1:34:07] choose to be the way you
[1:34:10] are because it's still a
[1:34:12] choice you still have to make the choice
[1:34:15] of I'm going to let all that stuff that
[1:34:17] hurt me and it did bother me I'm going
[1:34:19] to let it hold me down forever or I'm
[1:34:21] going to press on and I'm going to be
[1:34:22] different I'm gonna make a change it's
[1:34:24] like the story of the two brothers there
[1:34:26] was one brother there they were twins
[1:34:28] one of them was a successful businessman
[1:34:31] ran a big giant Corporation had a
[1:34:33] perfect family and was in church and did
[1:34:36] everything right and the other one was a
[1:34:37] homeless
[1:34:38] drunk and they went to both of them and
[1:34:41] said how did you end up
[1:34:43] here what happened and they both said
[1:34:46] the exact same answer I watched my dad
[1:34:53] one of them said wh dad was that way
[1:34:56] that's how I was raised that's how it's
[1:34:58] got to be and the other one looked at it
[1:35:00] and said I'm not going to be that I'm
[1:35:02] not going to let that hinder me I'm not
[1:35:04] going to use it as a crutch I'm not
[1:35:06] going to use it as an excuse I'm going
[1:35:08] to be different I'm going the other way
[1:35:11] quit going round and round and round in
[1:35:13] family cycles and say I'm not going to
[1:35:15] be that I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter
[1:35:18] of God I'm going to rise above my past
[1:35:21] I'm going to rise above my family traits
[1:35:23] I'm rise above who my daddy was and my
[1:35:26] mama was I'm going to
[1:35:29] conquer I'm going to overcome you're
[1:35:32] called to
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:38] conquer people raised poor bad past
[1:35:42] parents didn't love me didn't have
[1:35:43] parents I suffered horrible tragedy I
[1:35:46] have an emotional Scar from my childhood
[1:35:48] and it's not to make light of those
[1:35:49] things those are awful terrible things
[1:35:51] that hurt and definitely have impact
[1:35:53] fact but too many people choose to live
[1:35:56] in that hurt and lay in that hurt I said
[1:36:00] get up from that
[1:36:02] hurt but they always want to point back
[1:36:04] to that
[1:36:05] hurt every time you're around them you
[1:36:07] you feel drugged right back to their
[1:36:10] hurt right back to their pain no move
[1:36:15] on but you don't you don't understand
[1:36:17] you didn't go through what I went
[1:36:18] through I'm not saying they didn't have
[1:36:20] an effect I'm saying Turn the Page
[1:36:22] there's more to your story there's more
[1:36:25] to your
[1:36:26] story there's a lot more joy in the
[1:36:28] story but if you sit right there and
[1:36:30] read the same page over and over and
[1:36:32] over and over and over then that becomes
[1:36:34] who you
[1:36:35] are move on from that cast it down and
[1:36:38] move on because you can progress you've
[1:36:41] been called to
[1:36:42] progress the the struggles of our flesh
[1:36:44] are nothing more than the than the
[1:36:46] result of the of the Fall whether it's
[1:36:48] your temper your fear your complexes
[1:36:50] your pride whatever you want to place
[1:36:52] there tonight whatever your situation is
[1:36:55] but you've been called to overcome that
[1:36:57] curse by the power of the Holy Ghost but
[1:37:01] order to do so you got to start turning
[1:37:03] down the LIE of the
[1:37:04] enemy you got to start turning it down
[1:37:07] turn him down when he says your failures
[1:37:09] Define you turn him down when he says
[1:37:12] that you can't overcome your past turn
[1:37:14] him down when he says that you're always
[1:37:15] going to be just like this because in
[1:37:18] order to accept the promise you got to
[1:37:21] turn down a lie brother brandham says in
[1:37:22] order for e to accept the lie she had to
[1:37:24] turn down the
[1:37:26] word it works both ways you can't be
[1:37:28] dragging along your
[1:37:30] complexes and holding on to the
[1:37:33] promise you got to bury those complexes
[1:37:36] you know if you let those things stay in
[1:37:37] your life stay in your life and you get
[1:37:38] a little bit of reprieve and a little
[1:37:40] bit of reprieve you never know where you
[1:37:41] stand and you stay shook up one day on
[1:37:43] the mountain top the next day confused
[1:37:46] the next day I'm an overcomer the next
[1:37:48] day I'm a nobody look turn down the LIE
[1:37:51] of the devil there's only one truth
[1:37:53] about you and it's written in the word
[1:37:54] of God you're a Son of God you're a
[1:37:57] daughter of God you're a conqueror
[1:37:59] you're more than a conqueror you're
[1:38:00] going to make it you're going to be
[1:38:02] there your offspring's going to be there
[1:38:05] that's the truth that's the word that's
[1:38:07] where I'm going to
[1:38:08] stand grab a hold of that but in order
[1:38:11] to do it you got to cast down
[1:38:12] imagination cast down complexes cast
[1:38:15] down hurts cast down your past cast down
[1:38:18] the LIE of the enemy and clutch onto the
[1:38:21] truth of the word of God hold on to this
[1:38:25] if you want to be a
[1:38:27] conqueror
[1:38:30] Hallelujah me skip some of this down to
[1:38:32] a
[1:38:34] close you got to let the word change
[1:38:37] your thinking
[1:38:39] tonight feed on the word believe the
[1:38:42] word because what it does is it
[1:38:43] reinforces you every Spirit does the
[1:38:46] same thing negative people hang out with
[1:38:48] negative people critical people hang out
[1:38:50] with critical people people find people
[1:38:53] that agree with with them and they hang
[1:38:54] out with them to reinforce their
[1:38:55] argument it's human
[1:39:01] nature Christians do the same thing I
[1:39:05] get around other Christians because
[1:39:07] you're like me we got faith in the same
[1:39:10] way negative reinforces negative we come
[1:39:12] together and we let positive reinforce
[1:39:14] positive we feed off one another it's
[1:39:17] our job to reinforce one another it's
[1:39:19] our job to lift one another up unbelief
[1:39:22] will always point to the negative and
[1:39:24] downplay the positive it will
[1:39:27] acknowledge it yeah that's true
[1:39:29] but yes he's a Healer
[1:39:31] but yes but you don't understand that
[1:39:34] there's this giant and you don't
[1:39:36] understand there's this
[1:39:37] issue that's not how a conqueror thinks
[1:39:40] that's not how a son or daughter of God
[1:39:42] speaks we are to be positive people we
[1:39:44] overcome by our testimony promises are
[1:39:47] even brought to pass by our attitudes
[1:39:49] toward them brother Bram taught that and
[1:39:52] faith on the other hand May acknowledge
[1:39:54] the trial and it may acknowledge the
[1:39:56] fact that there's a giant oh yes there's
[1:39:59] a giant but they also have a butt
[1:40:02] there's a giant
[1:40:04] but there's a trial in my way but the
[1:40:08] devil set up all kind of fortifications
[1:40:10] but God said I can have it God said he's
[1:40:13] a Healer God said I'm a conqueror yes he
[1:40:15] said that there's Devils there but I'm
[1:40:17] here to take the land but I'm going to
[1:40:20] overcome but I'm going to be healed but
[1:40:22] I'm going to rap
[1:40:23] but I'm going with a new body yes the
[1:40:26] devil set everything up but I'm going to
[1:40:28] tear his kingdom down his walls are
[1:40:31] coming down his chains are falling off
[1:40:34] oh he's got he's a he's a worthy
[1:40:35] adversary but he will be
[1:40:38] defeated
[1:40:40] Hallelujah I've been called to more than
[1:40:42] coming out I'm called to conquer how can
[1:40:45] you say that because the word says that
[1:40:47] Romans 8:37 nay in all these things we
[1:40:50] are more than conquerors through him
[1:40:51] that loved us
[1:40:54] I'm not going to have time to finish all
[1:40:55] this so I'm going to finish on this as
[1:40:58] we talk about being
[1:41:00] positive I want to go back and look at
[1:41:03] Caleb there in the book of
[1:41:04] numbers after he steals the people and
[1:41:07] he says let's go take the
[1:41:08] land and the gripers and the Skeptics
[1:41:11] and the pessimistic folk all bring up an
[1:41:13] evil report and they cap it off with
[1:41:17] this this is their big oh yeah I know
[1:41:21] but what about this moment and there we
[1:41:24] saw the Giants the sons of anac which
[1:41:28] come of the Giants and we were in our
[1:41:31] own sight as Grasshoppers and so were we
[1:41:35] in their
[1:41:36] sight Caleb said let's take the
[1:41:39] land they said but they're sons of anac
[1:41:43] okay I got get that let's take the land
[1:41:45] God said we can have it we're more than
[1:41:46] able the word is true that's my
[1:41:48] testimony but you don't understand what
[1:41:50] the doctor said yeah I do I I heard I
[1:41:52] heard that that's that's awful but the
[1:41:54] word is true God said we can have our
[1:41:56] healing let's take the land but you
[1:41:58] don't understand where my wife and
[1:41:59] children are I I do understand that's
[1:42:01] awful but God said he's a restorer God
[1:42:04] said I can have it so let's take the
[1:42:05] land you following
[1:42:09] me constant positive they're pointing
[1:42:12] this out they're pointing that out but
[1:42:13] he's constant positive and now I want
[1:42:16] you to watch the Lord's
[1:42:17] attitude towards them versus Caleb this
[1:42:22] is in
[1:42:23] numbers
[1:42:25] 14:23 and the Lord says surely they
[1:42:27] shall not see the land which I swear
[1:42:29] unto their fathers neither shall any of
[1:42:31] them that provoke me see it but my
[1:42:35] servant
[1:42:36] Caleb because he had another spirit with
[1:42:39] him and hath followed me fully him will
[1:42:42] I bring into the land wherein to he went
[1:42:46] and his seed shall possess it I want to
[1:42:49] ask you a question at this point right
[1:42:51] here has Caleb possessed it
[1:42:54] no had he possessed it when he said
[1:42:56] let's go take it let's bring it down are
[1:42:59] you already healed have you already been
[1:43:01] delivered no but the word says I am the
[1:43:03] word says I am the word says I can have
[1:43:06] it so I'm going to say like Caleb I'm
[1:43:07] going to have it let's go take it let's
[1:43:09] go cake it and the Lord says there and
[1:43:11] goes because my servant had a different
[1:43:14] spirit because he had a right confession
[1:43:16] because he was positive because he said
[1:43:18] I can have it I'm going to give it to
[1:43:21] him and I'm going to bless him and I'm
[1:43:23] I'm going to renew right now my Covenant
[1:43:25] with you and say those that have held
[1:43:27] the word who have stood for truth who
[1:43:29] wasn't back down you're going to take a
[1:43:32] Rapture you're going to get it I promise
[1:43:35] you're going to have it
[1:43:38] Hallelujah it wasn't even manifested yet
[1:43:42] he was just testifying what the word
[1:43:44] said and because of his testimony the
[1:43:47] Lord confirms it to him now you can
[1:43:50] stand to your feet with me as we read
[1:43:52] one last scripture
[1:43:55] but I want you to watch it's not just a
[1:43:57] promise although we count his promises
[1:44:00] as good as
[1:44:01] done there's a
[1:44:05] manifestation there's a posit there's a
[1:44:07] promise then there's a positive
[1:44:09] confession then he reconfirms the
[1:44:11] promise and then there's a
[1:44:14] manifestation I want us to watch this
[1:44:16] because in judges it talks about the
[1:44:18] failure of them to complete the conquest
[1:44:21] and I want you to notice the same people
[1:44:24] who had failed to go over before once
[1:44:27] they get over are still failing to
[1:44:29] complete the conquest they still never
[1:44:32] conquered they're still failing and the
[1:44:34] scripture says Benjamin did not drive
[1:44:37] out the jebusites neither did Manasseh
[1:44:40] neither did Ephraim neither did
[1:44:44] Zebulon and they gave Hein unto
[1:44:48] Caleb as Moses said in my favorite part
[1:44:53] my favorite part you remember that thing
[1:44:56] that they said the reason we can't go we
[1:44:58] can't go because they're sons of anac
[1:45:01] Caleb said I'm going to deal with them
[1:45:02] first the very first thing he did you
[1:45:05] said I can't devil watch this you said I
[1:45:08] was never going to possess it watch this
[1:45:10] you said I couldn't be healed watch this
[1:45:13] you said I could never have my children
[1:45:15] watch this you said I'd never take a
[1:45:17] body change and he expelled this the
[1:45:21] three sons of anoch this is your
[1:45:23] champion and he's going down oh this is
[1:45:26] the one you lifted up as to why I
[1:45:28] couldn't possess the land but I'm taking
[1:45:31] him down first thing right now what is
[1:45:34] it in your life temper what is it pride
[1:45:38] what is it a a crutch and he says you'll
[1:45:41] never change I say tonight you take it
[1:45:45] down the thing you thought you had me
[1:45:47] with on this night I ended on this day
[1:45:50] I'm claiming my mountain on this day I'm
[1:45:53] progressing on this day I'm taking
[1:45:55] another step on this day I'm going
