his wife caitlin have had a little baby and it was promised to them one year ago today in a prayer line the lord promised them a baby and uh only on the year to the date the baby has been born and we now now the enemy of course wants to strike it down with some kind of illness or problem but i want to just say again satan ain't got enough amen not with the god that we serve and i'm asking that god to put a wall of fire around our church around our people to keep this coveted away from us amen that's not too hard to ask of him either let us pray and believe father in the name of jesus we come before that throne of grace it's there where we find help in our time of need lord we've just seen a miracle walk up here and give greetings a little testimony of the grace of god lord where you brought her back from the brink of death and there she is healed and made well for the glory of god and we want to thank you for that we believe that not only will have you healed her but lord you've fixed every problem that will never happen again lord we're asking o god for this brother ben goss and his mother who has various physical needs lords some very serious will you just undertake for him lord and bring deliverance lord in that home and that family it's your people that is crying out to you a little pastor there in florida under demand of demonic attack and lord oh god satan has come in a way that seems lord that it's impossible to get around but i'm asking god that you'll bring a deliverance because nothing is too hard for you you're greater than any sickness disease spiritual bondage any kind of any kind of demonic attack you're greater than at all i pray you lord for brother jake's sister jenny that you'll touch them the siler family and many in his church lord brother and sister ward and faithful evangelist who now has has had the coveted virus and lord is his wife suffering migraines and sister erica lord a poor little soul little little girl lord oh god she's so small to have to deal with this cancer that would want to try to take her down it looks so big but lord in comparison to you it's a little nothing it's no more than a headache so i'm asking in the name of jesus that you'll touch her body and healer our brother wrong lord who has been faithful to believe lord we have come through this cycle of 212 weeks and we believe that there's a fulfillment that is right here upon us we ask in the name of jesus as we believe this month is a month of miracles we have had now seven months seven months we're worried that the enemy has come even as joseph saw in his dream seven years and we've seen month after month after month in 2020 where the enemy has come with bad reports but this month is a month of new beginnings it's the eighth month and we're walking into new beginnings oh god new beginnings of healing and deliverance and the power of god being made known i ask in the name of jesus that you'll bless your children oh god every one of these

moment amen amen i told you we don't do everything conventional around here man brother drew he had a song on his heart this this evening when he walked into church he walked straight into the music

grace and mercy in our lives as sword you bless us tonight father lord it should move in our hearts move in our midst lord as we've already felt you may you just continue to move i pray continue to touch hearts and lives we ask it in jesus name amen and amen hallelujah turn your bibles to deuteronomy chapter 20. amen my very special moments tonight amen to see what the lord has done in our midst and amen to put a little song on a heart amen that he's a waymaker amen he is a waymaker mercy praise the lord and we will just see here tonight as he made a way for israel and many through the bible it says in deuteronomy 20 and verse 1 when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and see as horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee oh don't i just give you confidence as long as he's with me i'll not go unless you go with us amen which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and it shall be when thou when you are come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people and shall say unto them hear o israel ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them for the lord your god is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you amen we let you be seated amen just like to continue on the thought of let not your hearts faint fear not do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them you know as he said here in the first verse he made it very clear in the first few uh words that they would have battles he said when thou goest out to battle against thine enemy everyone has battles and everyone has trials everyone it does not matter if you're saved or you're unsaved or if you're going to make it to heaven or you're not going to make it to heaven everyone has battles and trials no one is exempt everyone through the bible had times of testing had times of battles but all the testings and all the trials and all the battles didn't matter as long as god was there to fight them amen and when he is there everything else doesn't matter amen everything else doesn't matter you know brother branham would say it like this in the manifestation of the spirit he said i trust that god will heal every sick and crippled person in our midst that comes i believe he will if we can just only have faith in him the work is complete and he goes on to say something that's very uh you know very ticky tacky or not very important but he said i see it's very warm and sticky and said we can't govern the weather but god does that and he says but i'm happy to be in god's serve a service whether it's real real cold or real real hot it doesn't matter amen just so he's here that's all that matters and i believe you know if we could have that attitude towards anything whether it be the heater or the or the ac or whether we feel good or we don't feel good or or whether we feel like being here we don't feel like being here only thing that matters is if he's here or not and if he's here nothing else matters as long as he's here when he's in the house he's all that matters i know last wednesday i talked about a lot about what don't matter or what does not matter but what i want to speak more on tonight is what does matter because he is all that matters amen you know he said every sinner he said i don't care how dull you may feel or how black your life may be in the presence of christ you can live again because he's all that matters amen no matter how sick you are tonight that doesn't matter what matters as you get in his present and he is a god that can heal all of your diseases amen when he when when he is all that matters this is what he would tell the children of israel when you come against your enemies don't look at how many people there are how big the whole how many horses how many chariots how big the wall there are because that doesn't matter the only thing that matters in this equation is me and i am here with you to fight your battles amen a god that matters and an enemy that don't matter hallelujah a god that matters in the enemy that don't matter and you know hey brother braden would say it like this he said who is more important than jesus what's more important than this service than jesus it doesn't matter the songs or the music or or how many people's here or not here it does not matter who's here who's not here only thing that really matters is if he's here or not and we know that his word declared he would be here because he said where two or three are gathered in his name there will i be and so we know that he is here because his word says he's here he is the most important person that can ever knock at your door hallelujah i mean we might be very pleased you know if the president would come knock or some government official or somebody that we love very much but there's nobody more important that can knock at your door than jesus christ and he's here at every service knocking on hearts doors but you know that what really matters is you know brother brandon would illustrate it in that painting he would say you know the painting of jesus knocking on the door amen but you know why wouldn't he just open the door and go in and the artist said well it's because the latch is on the inside so what matters is you open the door amen and you allow him to come into your life and and to speak to you and to touch your heart amen a minister can study and a minister can apply himself amen he could give all he's got but what really matters is if you had taken and say that's my word that belongs to me he's speaking to my heart and what are you doing you're opening the door for god to come in and minister to you that's what matters amen it doesn't matter how many services you come to or how many services you don't come to amen but long as you get to jesus and god comes on the inside of you and begins to speak to your heart how by you opening the door amen i've seen ministers great ministers of god that would speak and and you'd think man the altars would be full or there'd be many hearts moved but in some way that was going on with the individuals or something was going on the church and people would not receive it it didn't mean it didn't come from god it didn't mean that god wasn't speaking to them but what mattered is they would not open the door and allow god to come in and i believe that's what we ought to do every service and say god in this service tonight i want to forget about everything else around me i want to forget about my troubles i want to forget about the trials i want to forget about the fuss i had on the way to church i want to forget about everything around me i want to focus in on you and when you come i want to open the door i want you to speak to me i i want you to touch me i i want you to change something in my life and if there be any vowel thing take it away if there be any sin reveal it to me whatever it is god i want you to have freedom in my heart and in my life amen here's the most important thing there is no one more important than jesus hallelujah there's no one that can touch you like jesus there is no one that can save you like jesus there is no one that can heal you like jesus oh praise the lord amen he had a little boy be anointed tonight to sing a song that he's a waymaker listen i want you to understand that was a very supernatural moment whether we realize it or not that a little boy would get something on his heart walk into a music room and say i got a song tonight i want to sing jesus is a waymaker hallelujah not even knowing that his mom is a grandma wanted a movie he wanted to come up and and wave to you and to testify and to show you amen what was it god moving on a little heart of a child and that child opening the door if we could have child like faith to just open the door and say god use me touch my heart change me because there's nobody like jesus there's nobody that can touch my heart like he touches me there's no one that's healed me like he healed me there's no one that saved me like he saved me i mean he can testify that tonight there's not a government there's not some kind of help program that's ever saved me like jesus saved me well hallelujah amen he is the most important thing in this building tonight your feelings are not important whether they feel good or they feel bad that's not important i know bad feelings they like to be elevated and their extent you know to be essential and we've seen a lot of things that were elevated in this last seven months to be essential that's not really essential amen we saw them elevate abortions to be essential we saw them elevate all kinds of things to be essential that's really not essential amen what was it demonic forces trying to push their way out and say i mean something i'm important i matter oh hallelujah but there is something very essential tonight you get to jesus that's the most essential thing you could ever have in this service you say well i don't feel like it that's not essential what's essential is i'm going to push past what i feel or don't feel how i feel or don't feel what i believe or don't believe i'm going to push past it until i can get a conference with god hallelujah because he's a waymaker amen he'll make a way through your problems and your financial struggles and and the situations that's bothering you tonight if you can get to him he'll make a way through it hallelujah but the whole armor of god is by faith everything of the christian church is a faith act everything's supernatural nothing is natural when it comes to the house of god and you know and that's where if we could catch that because you know that satan wants to come on our natural realms even when it pertains to church or what we get out of churches is more along on the natural rounds well i didn't feel nothing i i didn't i didn't see nothing happening i i didn't i didn't hear god must not have been there and so he's constantly against the natural things but we as believers know that's not our guidance that's not what guides us is what we can see taste fill smell or hear amen what guides us is a supernatural realm and we can look beyond a natural realm of maybe nothing going on or seemingly what we can see happening and look beyond what we can see into the unseen and realize there's a supernatural realm here tonight amen jesus is walking among us and there's angels walking among us there's things happening and things in other realms there's demonic there's spiritual battles going taking place amen spiritual battles that are taking place and so we get we begin we begin to look past the things that are natural because we should be operating by the supernatural amen the only thing we base on our our walk on is faith and what god said to be the truth and we look to the unseen and we call those things which are not as though they were like abraham did amen you know i got reminded of my own situation not like abraham's today with brother nate green and his wife being in the hospital and and the baby having issues and having to be flown to another hospital and he's got a wife and one and a baby in another and i know what that feels like i i know the the helplessness you feel and you feel so helpless what do i do how do i what what you know of course satan's in those moments of helplessness to try to attack you and begin to come against your mind and tell you all kinds of things and tell you you must have done something wrong for you to be going through this or you must have sinned really bad or god wouldn't have put this on you you must you must not be one of he tells you all kinds of things in those helpless natural moments but if you can look beyond the natural moment and realize there's something happening in the supernatural realm god is moving on your behalf hallelujah god is moving on your behalf i hope somebody can catch that tonight god is moving on your behalf i feel to say it again god is moving on your behalf even though you can't see nothing but natural things and natural feelings and natural responses god is moving on your behalf and he's all that matters hallelujah amen when i went to go there to the the to the walmart to pick up a few things you know the store tell it again because it got reminded i've seen the pictures today brother nathan and his wife it brought black flashbacks with the same thing little baby in a little bubble and the mama being able to touch it for a few moments and it's gone helplessness natural feelings yes they flood you but that's not what matters what matters is he's fighting for you [Music] hallelujah amen i remember as i walked i went down the road and turned on the radio and a preacher was reading a scripture and said abraham believed in god and i just caught that moment and i turned it off and began to worship the lord i said that's right abraham believes you god and i'm a son of abraham and if abraham can believe you when things looked impossible i can believe you when things look impossible i just saw my baby trying to struggle for a breath and turning purple and the doctor saying don't let him die here on me send him to another hospital a lot of feelings were going on natural things were happening but there was also something in the supernatural and that's all that mattered god was moving on my behalf and my wife's behalf and that's all that mattered god was fighting for me god was fighting for me to save me in the middle of my struggle and that's all that mattered [Music] hallelujah if you can look beyond tonight what you see and realize god is fighting for me god is working it out on my behalf god is here to save me god is here to heal me god is here to deliver me god is here to set me free oh hallelujah when you can realize he's doing it for me i i turned the radio off and began to praise the lord went back to the hospital room and i told sister i don't know what we're about to face but we're going to believe god and we're not going to look at monitors what the doctor says what anything else going on around us we're going to look at the promise and it got worse it didn't get better it got worse days of getting worse and worse more a ventilator and then an oscillator and just a baby that was paralyzed looked impossible and it got worse and worse and worse but god was working on our behalf hallelujah hey man he told me in that moment it ain't what you've done it's what i did hallelujah maybe somebody need that tonight it ain't what you've done is what he did under the blood of bulls and goats abraham's faults were all listed out but you turn over to the new covenant find one fault find one mistake they don't talk about abraham going down to egypt when god told him not to or lying he don't talk about any of his mistakes god was fighting his battles and god came down in the form of human flesh and took on human battles he took on abraham's faults he took on abraham's failures and he conquered them all and he said abraham staggered not at the promises of god but was strong in the faith hallelujah that's what it's telling you tonight you hadn't done nothing it's what i've done i've already conquered your problem already conquered your sin already conquered your sickness name any sickness it's already conquered name any sin it's already conquered well come on somebody name any problem you're going through tonight it's already conquered he's already done it and that's all that matters but abraham so you're going to have a baby he'd get up and say how you feeling sarah this is no different well glory to god we're going to have it anyhow go get the bird eye and the pens and the baby bed and everything get it ready another month pass how you feeling no different well sarah what about it no different 10 years no different 25 years no different but instead of abraham getting weaker he got stronger and stronger listen to this devil instead of the bride getting weaker we're getting stronger and stronger you can pour out all your things you want to you can put out all the sicknesses you want to you can put out all the nonsense you want to the spooky feelings you want to we're not getting weaker we're getting stronger it's been 50 years 60 years don't matter we're not getting weaker we're getting stronger there's more that believes that all things that are possible there's more that's looking into the miraculous there's more that say an egg when god speaks that's all that matters it's not my feelings it's not by sight it's by faith what's everything you ask when you pray believe you receive it and hold on to it amen hold on to it don't you move you stay right there but demons demons come demons attack they're spiritual battles spiritual beings the doctor says you got cancer or you got tb or you got a cataract or you got pleurisy or you got this it's a devil it's a life and i want you to understand with covert 19 there's a lot of fear coming with it but don't forget it's a devil it's not an incurable disease it's a devil and at the mention of the name of jesus christ every devil has to flee [Applause] it's a life behind that life is a spirit you can see that in cancer or cataracts as a spirit it's got a life hallelujah amen now you know i i was listening today as brother branham was calling out some cancer he said do you not see that or hear that he said look at that he said that devil over there of cancer is crying out to this devil over here cancer you know why he's crying and screaming because he knows his time is finished oh if we could really see what's going on in the spiritual realm if we can really see what is happening or in another realm just a little bit faster or a little bit different than where we're at amen there's demons screaming in services they begin to scream out help me help me why because they know their time is finished the devil knows he only has a short time and it ain't very long his time is over [Applause] he says when jesus would walk to the life of a tree so there's a formula of that tree that has a life and he said curse it be you you don't have any fruit you'll never have any from this time forth they passed by it was about eight o'clock that morning they passed by about 11 o'clock later that that day peter said look at this tree it's dead from the roots up what was it jesus rebuked the life it was the roots and the whole thing died how many believes that that same christ is here to rebuke cancer from the roots the whole thing will die amen he's here to rebuke whatever kind of sin or sickness that is here today and it'll die from the roots wasn't even a speck of that tree left oh he said cancer tumor cataracts everything else will have to go when christ speaks why he cast out devils and he said in my name you shall cast out devils speak with new tongue take up serpent or deadly things it will not harm me if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover he still cast out devils so i'm beginning to realize hope you are tonight that cancers life don't matter amen oh hallelujah brain bleeds knives don't matter hey man i know some of you out there said it wednesday at the in the church so a few of our teachers here they it's probably curling their toes when i say it don't matter but it don't matter doesn't matter don't matter same thing to me don't matter the devil don't matter spirits of hell doesn't matter demons that comes against you don't matter he matters he matters so much he was in a boat on the sea of galilee one night and that boat was being tossed tossed around and he acted like he didn't even pay it any attention how would the devil feel if we done him that way we don't even pay him no attention because he don't matter he was tired he needed some sleep and he didn't care what the devil was going to do he's going to get sleep he wasn't paying him no attention he said he he said something had to happen had happened he said it was at a junction he said he put his foot on the braille the bow of the boat and looked up and said peace be still and i tell you the very creator of heaven and earth laid in a boat but nature still had to obey him when omnipotence speak the miraculous takes place hallelujah when omnipotence speak that means having unlimited power when it speaks the miraculous takes place a leper full of leprosy but it didn't matter went one day to a lord who did matter and he said lord can if thou will can you make me clean he said i will be thou clean what happened it was the omnipotent speaking and the miraculous took place and the leprosy vanished like a sun flying behind a cloud somewhere hallelujah when the voice of omnipotence speaks and he's here to speak again in this last day and when he speaks nothing else matters amen just like a lion when he would roar in a jungle everything else just shuts up because he's the king he matters when omnipotence comes out and you may be going through the world's roughest day of your life and your boat's been rocking back and forth but all of a sudden tonight jesus steps to the plate and he steps on the bow of your boat and he says peace demons could be in the middle of a sentence they go ah they can be in the middle of trying to strike you down and they got to stop because he matters and they know he matters do you understand the devil knows your god the devil knows exactly the power he has he knows exactly the abilities he has he knows when jesus comes on the scene his time is finished it's over with he don't have nothing else to say he don't have any more power he's lost it it's done it's finished when jesus comes on the scene cancer has to stop when jesus comes on the same blame breeze have to stop when he comes on the scene depression has to flee when he comes on the scene every kind of spirit of hell has to shut its mouth when he comes that's why the most important person you can meet with tonight is jesus when omnipotence speaks the miraculous happens he healed the sick he raised the dead he opened the eyes of the blind proving to the people i have the power to lay my life down i have the power to take it back up and no man can take it away from me amen he says brother as a gospel preacher this morning i believe that the holy ghost speaking through mortal lips today anointed ministers are speaking anointed ministers are speaking the time has come and the time is here omnipotence has answered and the miraculous is taking place hello did you hear that i believe god has anointed ministry on this day that says the time has come amen when you go out to battle you're going to need a miracle because you're powerless on your own how many times you have to show the children of israel you can't do it on your own and without me you're nothing they would go out and serve other gods and the next thing you know the enemy could take them like they were just water through a drain nothing but then he would come back on the scene and anoint a little man and kill 500 kill 600 kill a thousand whatever it took kill uh 200 000 with just music being played thousands on top of that what was it god showed them time after time i am all that matters and this world has forgotten that this nation has forgotten that this nation one time believed god mattered mattered so much they'd put it on their coins they would put it on their money they would put it over on their creeds and the things and the papers that wrote this nation and built this nation but today they they it don't matter no more god does not matter you don't matter enough to have them in their schools he don't have he don't matter enough to have them in their everyday lives he don't matter enough to have them in their job he don't matter enough to have them at sports events he don't matter at all to them and they're going to learn very quickly when you take god out and he don't matter then you don't matter it's the truth when he done all the miraculous the omnipotence was speaking god manifested in flesh he would come this the roman centurion would come and said speak the word lord and my servant will be healed my servant will live he knew whatever whatever he said they had to do it because he was a man of authority so i say to this command come he said i'm a man of authority i say this man come and he comes this man goes and he goes i'm a man of authority and everything under my authority obeys me and lord i'm not worthy that you'd come into my house so just speak the word i mean he knew that was omnipotence and he knew when omnipotence spoke the miraculous would take place it did at the grave of lazarus martha said lord if he had been here for my brother would not have died but even now omnipotence speaks whatever you ask god god will do it whatever you say he will do he walked to the grave omnipotence manifested here among us living with us god in christ reconciling the world to himself here he lived with us god proven his son christ jesus omnipotent and miraculous and if he's the same yesterday today and forever he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you to the end of the world how can we look for anything else but when he speaks that the miraculous will happen it's got to happen the miraculous will take place let me go on down here but god testing the patriarch abraham and every one of us is going to have tests every one of us is going to have trials god had given a promise when he gives a man a promise he wants to make sure this person is worthy of the promise i ask you tonight are you worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said or what he promised and abraham had been promised that his seed the whole through his seed the whole world would be blessed and he'd have a son and out of him would come forth a seed that would bless the whole earth abraham when the promise was given him maybe 75 or so years old sarah 65 but the bible tells us that abraham staggered not at the promises of god through unbelief but was strong in the faith praising god glorifying god giving god to praise year after year after year after year god time after time after time year after year testing him until he come to the final test before his blessing was going to happen and that's the way it is with all the seed of abraham god gives us the final test before he gives us the blessing and if this possible i'd like to say it here now the final test is how you react and when he gave abraham his test he found just how true he was what a blessing it would be this morning if we who take his promise of healing would just stand just as true as we could no matter what the doctor said just stand true just stand there because his word has promised healing to us it's promised deliverance to us it's promised healing salvation to us just stand there and here he come to this test to take his son's life he had testified all over the earth he acquainted with he was going to have a son now he's going to come back and destroy him destroy the only hope he had for a testimony to be fulfilled god seen her loyal heart pulled back he looked out of heaven and said i've sworn by myself i'll bless you and multiply you and your seed shall possess the gate of the enemy what a promise what a promise how many is here abraham's seed then you're to possess the gate of the enemy and when you draw an eye to the enemy and you see he's greater in number and he has more horses than you he has more chariots in you he has more ability to you than you fear not because there happens to be a god that when you're pulling that knife back he can create something out of nothing abraham there in his moment of trial just about to do what god said to do he said abraham hold it stop i provided the lamb i gave you what you have need of i've done this for you i have the ability i am able to provide when no one else can provide i'm able to give when no one else can give i'm able to bless when no one else can bless i'm able to give you what you have need of it because you trusted me and i'm the only thing that matters he would he would move on god's sworn promise the seed would possess the gates of its enemy so that god would give that kind of promise to you tonight he's got to make a way for you to possess it because we can see through the bible human abilities is not able to even possess a regular old city just natural enemies it's impossible so if naturally you couldn't produce it or possess it naturally how can naturally possess spiritually you get what i'm saying you can't do it it's impossible so he has to make a way if he said thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy that's his promise then he has to make the way to possess it so he has to give the power to possess it he has to give the ability to possess it he has to give something inside of you that no matter what if all hell comes against you you can stand no matter what comes again that you're going to possess the gate of the enemy that the gate that means the hell is going to be against you this is the pr this is in the promise hell's going to be against you but you're going to possess it you're going to take it over you're going to destroy it it's going to be your possession in other words it's going to be under you so to give that promise he's telling you it's going to come against you but there's going to be a power there to resist that thing and destroy that thing and conquer that thing and put it under your feet and i understand we all all of us have tried on our own to possess the gates of the gates of hell we've all tried to possess and take over pornography on our own we've all tried to take over spirits and things all these kind of things on our own women has other problems whatever things that you tried to do on your own year after year failure after failure and you realize i can't do it i can't live it it's not in my abilities it's impossible but then he gives you something possible it's the holy spirit it's the holy spirit working in you it's the holy spirit that comes inside of you that's why it's important that's what matters in this hours to receive the holy ghost amen what don't don't matter in this hour is to go to a certain church or to be a member of a certain church i had somebody today or this week that you know say i want to come in and be a member at your church that's not what's in my that's not what matters what matters is you get the holy ghost amen that's what that's what matters but the world to the world it don't matter the world the world wants to tell you well you can be a christian and you want to live this way you know nobody can be a real christian nobody can live that kind of life we we're all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god and they try to make it where it don't matter the word don't matter what he said in his word don't matter what he what what he said about hair or dress or or your body is a temple it don't matter and it does matter it's the most important thing in this world but you can't do it or possess it on your own it's impossible you got to get what matters and one of the most important things in our life is receiving the holy ghost the seal of god to come into our lives and you get that seal then you'll have to worry about joining the church he said when you get the holy ghost you'll be there when the doors are open hello somebody i know now we got a real good excuse you know we got coven just for anybody in our church has been streaming and you have been afraid to come we've been having church we're having a good time and the prophet of god said if the holy ghost is in your heart you'll be there when the doors are open he also talked and read it today he talked about as our pastor mentioned about women working he said you get the holy ghost and he'll take care of that i'll get you the quote if you want it that's what matters hello somebody that's what matters the holy ghost but i know people don't need a popular message no more it's more popular to preach popular things that you can live a certain life be a certain way and you're going to grow into token life you're going to grow there one day one day one day and it's always a carrot out there but how you get it is repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and say god i want you more than anything because you are all that matters he matters more than any job he matters more than any money in any account he matters more than anything this is what he said we told the story of the little flower man who found the magic flower heard the story said he was found his magic flower and he would flower and he would open up the riches whatever give him a wish as to be opened up the riches of the earth and he opened him up it was all kind of diamonds and trinkets and just unbelievable riches the man gets so enthralled and lays a little flower down it's like oh man look at all this i finally can pay off my house i i finally can have a little money i i finally can get somewhere in the world i i can have this and maybe buy myself a kingdom or or buy some i i'm rich and he grabbed something that he found that seemed to be important what mattered to him maybe it was a gold big old giant piece of gold and run to run out of the cave with it and he hears a voice don't forget the main thing and i'm afraid that's what we're doing in our lives in our churches we're forgetting the main thing we've got a theology got a crew got a dogma got our ways of living our what rights and our wrongs but what about the main thing what about the spirit of god moving in our churches what about the miraculous taking place what about signs and wonders being performed it's all in the word and if he's here then these things are happening they're taking place they're moving in the body and he throws that thing back in there and said well what can be more important than that and he found something else he thought was of greater value and he runs out and hears the voice saying don't forget the main thing what in the world can be the main thing and what's what's more important what this can buy me all kinds of stuff and he throws it back in there and it gets him a second job third job or whatever and he finds him a better job they keep him out of the house of the lord and he finds him something amen he pulls it out and he starts running with it and hears the voice don't forget the main thing and just forgot forget about it i don't know what's so important just let he throws it and he walks out and the cave closed behind him with the flower on the inside what gave him it in the first place hello somebody what gave you the ability to work in the first place what gave you the ability to provide in the first place what gave you the ability to think and to move and to live what gave you that in the first place all that matters we're not talking about a little magic flower here tonight we're talking about jesus christ we're talking not talking about something that's not real we're talking about something that's real more real than anything you can even see here tonight he's god of god and he's king of kings he's a jehovah jireh he's jehovah raphae he's everything that we ever had in need of and so much more i'm glad i could depend upon him when my mom was laying in a blood a brain bleed in a serious situation i'm glad that brother matthew could depend upon him when his daughter was losing all of his hair i'm glad brother david and sister atlanta could depend upon it when they're stricken with cancer i'm glad that the spencer family can depend upon him tonight i'm glad you can depend upon him tonight you can depend upon him for your family you can depend upon him for your finances you can depend upon this god because he never fails and he never will and he's all that matters it's essential you want to hear what's essential tonight the holy ghost is essential the spirit of god moving in our churches is essential other churches may say it ain't so but they're liars it's essential amen the freedom of the holy ghost to come and speak to someone to touch their hearts and to lift them up out of their situation that's essential that means more than the world to me to see somebody that comes in all beat down and all about just bowed down with cares of life and the spirit of god go to moving over the sanctuary and reach out and zoom right in on them and lift them up that's essential i know the devil's been telling this this whole year you're not essential he's a liar you are sensual you're essential to this church and i'll say it to you out there streaming you're essential to this church don't let the devil tell you you're not nobody cares nobody understands your god cares and he understands what else does anybody else matter it only matters god cares you heard the song song right before god god cares for you he cares for your needs he cares for your your your surroundings and the things that you're going through and your troubles and and your anxieties and the problems and all this world and this year has created god cares about it and he knows all about it and he understands it it's essential that we come together as believers i don't care what the world says they can say it ain't so it is so because his word said so his word said forsake not the assembling of yourselves so if his word said it is essential to me amen so but if we're abraham's seed how many does abraham see then your heirs to every promise and every promise in there is essential to me i ain't one of them that's a little bitty to me i want every one of them amen he said i don't believe that the true seed of abraham will fail that ought to make somebody shout how many is the seed of abraham i don't believe the true seed of abraham will fail they'll stand just as gallant and loyal as abraham ever did hallelujah we see that god cannot say anything or make any promise unless he fulfills it he has to in order to be god years later when the same people the promised people of abraham the seed of abraham were journeyed across there amen what was it god's promise held true god took care of them god provided for them and he said whoever curses israel will be cursed and whoever blesses him will be blessed oh hallelujah god promised him and he took care of him daniel was promised and he took care of him amen the children of illinois the three of your children was promised and he took care of them oh hallelujah and you were promised he said i'm going to have a bride without spot without wrinkle and they're standing on the earth today you are a people of the promised here for ordained of god and ain't a devil in hell can do anything about it and you're standing there all hell's against you you're standing though every kind of breath is blowing and hell is blowing and saying you're not essential and saying you're not there and saying you're not worthy you're still standing anyhow we want to do it again devil i'm still here and not only am i here but the host of the living god the armies of the living god is here standing with us on our behalf [Applause] hallelujah when jesus made the promise he had to bring it to pass he said these signs shall follow them that believe he made the difference he made the difference oh hallelujah we were going down through many of them that took up had battles listen to this he talks about he talks about moses and this is this is pretty amazing it talks about moses and the frogs and the fire and the storms and the rain and the hell and the red sea and all that hemmed in by pharaoh's army mountains and deserts moses stepped forward and possessed the gate across the red sea walking on a dusty road god said so and that settled it but a little was little year a few years later when trials come and the church got all shook up as it's so easy for a congregation of people to do when something isn't happening just the way it's supposed to be i don't think this year went exactly how we thought it was supposed to be and people have gotten shook up he said it's so easy to do when things don't happen the way it's supposed to be supposed to have graduation parties we're supposed to have birthday parties we're supposed to be able to meet together we're suppo and it don't happen that way he said god makes it that way the devil can't do nothing unless god gives him permission don't ever forget that covet could not be here unless god just said okay it's time for it world war world wars couldn't happen unless god said it's time for it spirits cannot have their way unless god says it's time for it because he's all that matters amen god brings tensions into the church i don't know about that brother timothy for every son that cometh to god must be tried proven and tested he let sickness strike you i thought this was rejoicing he lets disease come on you to test you and to prove you and show the world you are truly the seed of abraham the devil's only here to show the world who you are that's his whole purpose that's his whole purpose of being here is to show the world who timothy pruitt is who you are [Applause] he permits it by his own will he permits disasters he permits the friends to turn against you he permits all these things and he turns the devil loose to tempt you he'll do all but take your life he'll throw you in a bed of affliction he'll turn your neighbors against you he'll turn the church against you he can do almost anything if it's god's will for him to do it we're taught though that it's more precious than gold to us oh man that's kind of one of them quotes he put over there somewhere but it's the truth things come and it ain't always how we plan for it to be or we dreamed of it to be or how we wanted to be but he's what matters he's got a plan he's got a way to get a bride to a certain place he's got a way of of moving things and orchestrating things i mean you can see it god's hand and in battles through natural battles all the way down through our our history of our even our own uh a nation you can see god's hand moving in every situation and i know people want to say well that's just happenstance no god's planning something hallelujah he said here you come with abraham he allowed him to get to a spot he let abraham be tested to that final point he got to test you and me to that final point that time of decision when everything's away from you and you have to stand alone stand alone that don't sound fun hello but what are you going to how are you going to react what's going he's wanting to see your reaction how are you going to move are you going to trust him a song i can trust jesus can you trust him he asked brother ron can you trust me with your life he's asking every one of us can you trust me that i'll get you to a certain place that i'm improv i'm in provision here i i'm in control here i got this can you trust me he said what are you going to walk out and say in that final moment he said i want i want to say though he slayed me yet i'll trust him that's the seed of abraham that's the one who gives the promise no matter what the rest of themself the rest of them says or the rest of them do for me and my house we're going to serve the lord if the rest of them says there's nothing to experience and there's a bunch of excitement for me and my house we're going to serve the lord i'd like to take it up with paul here and say the way they call heresy so i worship the god of our fathers though they be tattlers and churches through there'll be twisters and they'll be all kinds of false prophets and everything comes out amongst the people and the neighborhood and everything but for me and my house we're going to serve them all the lord though all of them quit coming though the church gets cold and different in my house but as for me and my house we're going to serve the lord those that somebody has prayed for and didn't get well has nothing to do for them for it's me and my house we're going to serve the lord nothing else matters testing and trials men are not fallible or men are not infallible but god is men make mistakes of course you get your mind on a man he'll make a mistake he'll do it god permits him to do it so he can shake your faith away from that man our faith is not in the wisdom of men it's in the power of the resurrection of jesus christ that's where the true seed of abraham rests their promise because they can only be the seed of abraham when they receive the holy spirit hello somebody this or what have caused you to rise up in the middle of your chaos and say though god slayed me i'm going to trust him why because there's something else there's a greater power inside of you that when the flesh is willing or the flesh is weak the spirit is willing and able to stand up and say no devil i'm not bowing i'm not going that direction you know it didn't matter to joshua and caleb when they came to that land had been talked about promised to him been painted such a beautiful picture and did you notice how god does things i've said it before but he he tells them he's going to take them out he's going to take them in and he tells them nothing about what's in between because it didn't matter all that matters was him because i'm taking you out and i'm taking you in so the red sea didn't matter no water mattered no food didn't it didn't matter nothing like that mattered all that mattered was god said i'm taking you out i'm taking you in and he tells him i'm gonna take you to a land flowing with milk and honey did you notice there wasn't no mention of the jericho and the walls and the hittites and the jebusites and and the amorites and and the mighty armies and the chariots there was no mention he said i'm going to take you to a land flowing with milk and honey because none of that mattered to god jericho didn't matter they had great walls didn't matter had great chariots didn't matter god was going to tear it down god would deliver them from every enemy they would face if they would serve him that's all that mattered you serve me and any of these none of these enemies matter but if you don't serve me then these enemies will have you and they'll take your daughters and they'll take your sons and they'll slay you can read about it through the bible and so but when they go over to the spies and spies with the spire of the land all of a sudden man there's giants here there's walls this ain't possible it's it's impossible joshua and caleb it didn't matter they didn't come back talking about walls and chariots and no it's all come talking about the land god promised and we're more than able to take it this is our land god said so that's all that mattered i can i can just see as we look at this joshua and caleb didn't go over there to see how big the giants was they went over there to see where their house was going to be they went over to see where where's my land at caleb picked it out he said i want that mountain right there joshua when we come in here i want that and the mother spies no doubt said caleb have you not seen the giants on that mountain don't matter have you not seen all the armies and the cities on that mount don't matter god said i had it in his mind and he gave it to me that's all that matters listen if you'll start looking at your enemy once again that it don't matter whatever he has whatever sickness whatever problems whatever situation god said it's your healing god said it's your joy god said it's your deliverance god said it's yours that's all that matters because he matters more than your enemy does he said i can see joshua jump up on some kind of box and said to about 2 million people screaming out men and brethren we're more than able to take it he said what was it there was a seat of abraham god gave the promise it was their possession it didn't matter what the opposition was because the opposition don't matter hallelujah the true seed of abraham said we can take it because god gave it to you and he said there you stand this morning what are you going to say hello somebody every one of you is looking at an enemy right now what are you going to say to him hallelujah he said what will you stay when here stands the church of the living god he said i don't care what anybody says what the doctor says what the unbeliever says we are more than a match for anything that comes along hello did that kind of get you awake just a little bit this is wednesday night we are more than a match cancer we're more than a match high blood pressure went more than a match sugar diabetes we're more than a match the church of the living god is more than a match why we're abraham's seed and we're possessing the gates of our enemy no matter what the enemy is god gave the promise and that's all that matters it's yours it's your possession healing is your possession salvation is your possession holy ghost is your possession come on young people the devil's been trying to tell you it's not but the holy ghost is your possession there's great thousands of preachers and so forth in the land that might try to say it ain't so but to the seed of abraham it is so it is so why god said they would have it and that's the reason why we believe it because god said we can have it if god said i can have my healing that's all that matters if god said i can have my joy tonight that's all that matters if god said i could have my children then i that's all that matters come on hallelujah if god said i could have my mama tonight that's all that matters the devil can howl the devil can shout the devil can scream but his voice does not matter there is a line of the tribe of judah that's here to sound out on your behalf and when omnipotence speaks that's all that matters brain bleeds has to flee the red sea has to open and the way has to be made for the children of god [Music] that's all that matters he is all that matters and he said when you see your enemy that's greater horses more horses more chariots more people don't be afraid of them fear is the greatest weapon the enemy has with covet right now is fear the fear of the unknown the fear of it being untreatable the fear of it being impossible fear fear fear fear fear and they're pumping it fear fear fear fear fear but when you see them don't be afraid for the lord thy god is with thee hallelujah i mean he's been in a battle the lord thy god is with thee i said the lord thy god is with thee and he brought you up out of the land of egypt amen brother john has he brought you this far has he brought you this far hallelujah amen he's brought babe he's brought drew this far the lord thy god is with thee he's brought him this far into god and brought him this far will take him all the way why he's a waymaker he's a miracle worker he's a promise keeper he's more than able even now what will you say to your mountain what will you speak will you say oh i can't make it it's impossible or we say though god slay me i'm going to trust it and my hope my trust is in the almighty living god and he's here among us he's raising the dead he's healing cancer he's restoring the eyes of the blind he's bringing back strength into legs he's touching hearts he's moving aside obstacles he's making a way where there seems to be no way amen my god is able he's a waymaker he's your god away maker then you ought to tell your enemy right now my dog's a way maker my god's a miracle worker my god is the same yesterday today and forever my god is able yet more than evil can we hear the voice of god tonight speaking out of them and saying my god's able he's a waymaker he's a miracle worker he's a promise keeper and even when i don't see him working he's still working even when i don't see him saving he's still saving even when i don't see him healing he's still healing whoa even when it seems oppression is all around me the joy of the lord is still among us that's all that matters and if i was you i would begin right now to worship what matters hallelujah go ahead open your mouth you worship what matters you praise what matters you glorify what really matters you open your lips amen the preacher's done preaching it's your turn right now to glorify what matters amen the world is glorifying things that don't matter and they're trying to tell you you're not essential but you're here tonight because of the grace of almighty god and his calling his life and every devil in hell tried to stop you from being here but he couldn't every devil in hell tried to kill you but it couldn't everyday or devil in hell has tried to bring you down into the pits of hell but it couldn't why because the voices spoke over you and he said you're my child so if i was you i'd praise what matters we give voice enough to our problems we give voice enough to our sickness and our struggles let's give voice to the i am let's give voice to the king of kings and the lord of lords let's let the praise of god a shout of the king let it be in the camp right now there's a king in our midst well if there's a king in our midst let's praise him like he's a king let's glorify him like he's a king let's give him honor like he's a king well praise the

trying to work me up no i'm trying to tell you praise god the world is out there praising their gods and their worlds and their things they got and they don't even matter how about us when we see what he's done for us where he brought us from how he changed our children how he gave him the holy ghost how he moves and on our behalf and hills are sick and and walks a miracle right up here among two miracles amen right here among us moving right here right here in front of our eyes oh hallelujah and they heard jesus was coming and there was a man that heard him and he said jesus have mercy on me
