day and I know you're longing for two this is just a little reminiscence of what's going to be the Lord just kind of gives us a little preview as it were of what heaven's going to be like to be with Believers to enjoy the presence of the Lord and to be able to give him praise and thanks for all that he has done for us we could never we can never praise him enough for what he has done and just look into the Lord today and asking God to to um to continue touching your heart ministering to you and I pray that and I know that you've been ministered to in this um this meeting we just seen the Lord use our brothers today of course is our final service of this um the October meetings it's not our final service because we're going to go to a great Youth Camp amen I've got reservations made you know it ain't going to be no old people there they'll all be young amen will all enjoy one another in eternity forever and what a day that will be we're looking forward to that and ask the Lord to just give us continued pouring out his blessings and upon us as we press toward that Mark now we have just had just a wonderful time I've got a lot of things to give to all the the home folks here the church family and our deacons and trustees and and everybody else is just as pitched in to help us preparing and making for this and and I had a wonderful meal together and it went really good yesterday and I'll tell you I I'm just so proud I don't know what to say about it um I don't have words enough to say how proud I am of you the church here at evening light Tabernacle now I just tell you how I envision our church I'm Vision us as just a big old oak tree and where that others can come and rest under our branches and we are glad that you were able to come even for a weekend or some of you been through here since Wednesday and just to sit down and just rest under the coolness of the of the shade that the Lord has provided for us here and and uh I I just want to say that our God is more than enough amen he is a provider for every need that we could have if you look out on this campus and everything that we have had we've never taken a note on everything everything God gave us gave us everything debt free and we have been blessed abundantly because he's a God that does that he is more than enough and I'll tell you I challenge you just to believe God for your need because he's a god that is more than enough not just enough he's more than enough he don't just bless us he does exceeding abundantly above that which you're able to think or ask that's the God we serve so we're so thankful to the Lord for that and I want to say I appreciate the ministers that have come and we have the McGary uh church that has been here brother Billy in Bowie II and brother Matthew McGarry and and uh and and even brother Bowie's father-in-law all the way from the Congo so he's a pastor there and and in the Congo this is a very small church I mean this this group gives a very small group uh you know they they number in the thousands there sometimes you think oh on this one or two of us believes this message no God's got a people around the world and when the prophet of God sorry as a bride from every nation and the scripture says he's from every nation Kindred tongue and people and so therefore we have a responsibility as the children of God to um to welcome everyone from around the world because that's what God does Amen good to have the the Ministries here with brother Wayne Lawson from from Ohio to and and of course those that have came from the genyan why we just come from the East and West and wherever you're from we're just happy you're here amen and one day we won't ever have to part yeah it's always a little sadness when you come down to the last service of a meeting and and it is a little bit of oh my I wish we could just one one more day you know one more time every time you come into God's presence it's that way you just say just a little more Lord just a little more amen so we thank the Lord for his goodness today we're going to go to prayer for some needs we have our sister Danette Pruitt now this is really close to home this is my my brother's wife my brother Dan and we married sisters so this is my wife's Karen's sister and she has come down with uh indolent lymphoma she had a growth removed from her spine and it got down where she was not able to even walk and she needs to be able to walk again she's after surgery she's able to take a few steps but she really needs the Lord to undertake for her are and and she's undergoing radiation treatments starting tomorrow and they're going to do it five days in a row and break for the weekend five days for a room I think for about the next three weeks so we need prayer for her um nothing will stand before our prayers not even cancer not even cancers remember well brother Tim you know well then we don't need doctors or we don't now God uses doctors too you see I Envision it like the four living creatures Before the Throne and I think of it as God who who uses these anointings and of course we know the primary use was down to the church ages the lion the ox the man the eagle and the anointings that would come upon the people for the age to give them preparation but they were their anointings of Deliverance sometimes sometimes God gives us courageous Faith Like a Lion with real boldness and we we're with tenacity to hold on to a promise and take hold of the promise of God and other times you know it's the eagle anointing and it just snatches you right out of the out of your situation and the Miracle happens and that's God's way he does that amen sometimes you know the the face then will turn towards you and and it's the face of a man and God used the intelligence of a man and God will use doctors but he's the Healer doctors can heal but God will use them and set the arms he said well you know um if the arm was broke well yeah you'd go to a doctor and he'd set the arm but it would be God that would heal well God can do it without that we had a little little girl that fractured her arm and that was going to have to put rods in it and stay in there for a year and and after coming to the prayer line went back the next day no surgery needed totally healed you know it it's just that kind of God that does that they just put it in a cast to stabilize it but our God's A Healer so we don't look to man but sometimes sometimes the face will turn and it's the ox anointing or the calf anointing and it's the Beast of sacrifices it represents death but God even heals in death because in just one moment you can go from being the most sickest weakest down in the bed unable to move no nothing and they're turned back into a young person in just one second that's the ultimate healing amen so you know even in that that's not when people die that's not a denial of Faith or nothing wrong with our faith these all died in faith amen so we believe God no matter which way it is whether God wants to do it with the boldness of a lion with the miracle of the eagle with the intelligence of a man or whether it's even a graduation here is all God doing the healing so we're looking to him so we want to remember he said brother Tim what's his prayer requests mean and I and you know does it make a difference well let me just share with this with you last year we prayed for Wanda Underwood um sister Patty's sister this comes from Brother Stephen Massengale and she was not fully conscious she was on a ventilator at at Vanderbilt and the prayer request said needs the Lord to intervene she needs to wake up well now we're fast forward a year said let brother Tim know my sister-in-law that a request was put in for last year today's date a year ago came off the ventilator and is up and walking some with a walker and has to use a wheelchair but praise the Lord amen God brought her back amen we want to thank the Lord so you set before yourself a well person and now now look if you're if you're 80 don't expect to be you know 15 again but I mean put before you a well 80 year old that is healthy amen and take one step by that if you're 80. if you're 21 instead of 21 year old and if you have 68 to 68 year old but said it before you and step by step you walk into that vision and you begin to confess the promise of God to say it's mine and God has healed Me by his stripes I am healed it is my future it is now and today I'm taking another step into that body that I have set before me amen so we want to remember Sister Danette and we're encouraging her and she listens in and I you know just just um said it where she can see the audience right now and please on the cameras right now and said it where she can see the audience and I want you all to wave says to Sister Danette now and say we're praying for you amen God bless you Sister than that we love you all right we're going to remember Sister Linda Walsh she's struggling with arthritis and we're praying also for brother Jack guest he has an employment situation he's more than enough sister Natalie Parks he has the flu for Eddie Dodds that he was here in the service just recently but he's got some serious surgeries that are coming up soon and requests in prayer and then some precious Believers in the Philippines I believe that's where they far with the con with a contagious fever so let's go to the lord well let's um let's think of that song bring all your needs to the altar and let's just ask him today maybe you've got a request maybe you've got a

believe we're getting ready for change amen and that's what's on her heart this morning is change and I believe I believe that we have change upon us I believe it's the season and the hour of it I believe God has sent so many things into this age in time that we can no longer a man ignore what God has so graciously done in our generation we want to definitely say that we have enjoyed these meetings what a blessing and what a time of Fellowship that it's been we are highly honored to share the stage with these men of God and and I feel like that we're we're able to be a part of things that will be talked about for days to come amen and brother Tim we certainly appreciate and you and your church and family brother Timothy allowing us to come and stand with you in this in this time of fellowship and have confidence and we want to thank you as a church family of the evening like Tabernacle and all of you that has came we want to say special things to you all that was a part of our uh camp this in August There Our Youth Camp brother Nathan Erickson and brother Ronnie put on a wonderful Camp there Labor Day and we want to thank you all for your participation for your backing of it for your support and these men of God came by the Timothy and brother Andrew and they tore it up I I got to be there for all the services and I I was just just tremendously blessed by what they had to say and the way God came and backed it up amen and I think we just certainly appreciate it and from True Word Tabernacle and from our pastor brother Erickson we just want to thank each and every one of you God bless you for your for your support amen and today we have a few things upon our heart I'd like to if we could maybe just before we go into the word maybe we could just turn to prayer we just bow our hearts together gracious Lord we are so thankful today for the grace that you have shown us for the blessing Lord that you have given Grace Lord to our lives to father to let us stand and to preach your gospel in such a season father in such a time like this that we're living but there's something in our heart Lord let's look Beyond the Veil and the troubles and all the things that are happening and Lord we see something taking place in the Supernatural and I want to thank you for Sight to see it and Faith to believe it now Lord Jesus as we speak today from our heart upon things that I believe concerning this age and time I pray Lord that you would come by this way and bless it may you bless the hearer of the word Lord and father I pray that there'd be a special something for every young person for every Elder Lord for every person in this building may you bring your word may you feed your people father may you give them of your great mercies today Lord now Lord as we Endeavor to speak we ask you for your mercy in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you amen if you have your Bibles today we want to look into the scripture in the book of Philippians the third chapter in the 20th verse Philippians 3 20 21 and we'll also be looking at First Corinthians 15 and 51. amen what a what a tremendous message last night I don't have to ask you if you enjoyed it I know you did amen and it was a tremendous blessing to be able to be here and to fellowship and I was kind of hoping brother would just preach again today as is what my he he didn't even acknowledge me and uh amen but we appreciate him giving to us so wonderfully and of his energies in Philippians chapter 3 and verse 20. for our conversation is in heaven for once also we look for the savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body so Paul is not just asking he's declaring the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change out of our body that it may be fashioned like an under his glorious body now if one someone ever asks you if that there is an actual body of Jesus Paul believed that he said that it may be fashioned like an unto his glorious body according to the work and whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself now in First Corinthians 15 and 51 we want to read here Apostle Paul he's that Apostle to the Gentile Church he brought some beautiful things to us the letter to the Corinthians is a letter of Correction of course but he put some promises in there was very powerful in First Corinthians 15 51 I'm just going to read the one verse behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed we ask the Lord to bless his words you couldn't be seated this morning we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed I'd like to speak to you in just a few minutes today upon the mystery of our change upon the mystery of our change you know I believe we're living in Changing Times I don't really believe that we would have to stand here all day to declare that the seasons are changing the times are changing but I believe if you're just just living in this life just now that you see so many changes someone that who was born in the early 1900s that would still be here there's been so many changes from my parents in the from the 1940s till right now there's been so many changes on the planet there's so many things that's happening that there would just be impossible for you to deny that there is great change that has taken place and is taking place as we speak change is happening so quick but as the changes come development knowledge as the scripture said that it would come of course we know there's two great trees coming to fruit there's the tree of life and there's also the tree of knowledge into evil and it's all coming to to the to fertition at the same time now in this kind of time that we're living a prophet predicts the greatest storms that ever was given spiritually speaking would strike this age this would be the season of time when confusion would take over churches that it would become a famine to even understand what the real word of God is because so many people are saying so many things so clouds of lies and deceit and the storms of of denominational understandings and it would just be scattered so much that it would literally just become a Gloom over the Earth and people wouldn't really even know what to believe or how to believe it is a it is the tactic of the devil to cause confusion so that everybody doesn't trust anything that is said so that it breaks down the levels of trust now we realize that there's a lot of things said now I'm I'm just an old country boy and you all forgive me but I grew up raccoon hunting up there in Arkansas and we we did it with a with an old dog it was an old I had an Old Red Dog it wasn't very good actually mostly tree possum but I enjoyed going you know it was a it was always a good time to go and uh and you know 15 I couldn't hardly get anybody go with me so a lot of times I went by myself but sometimes it was better going by yourself because you didn't have to argue about Direction you know there's nothing worse than it is getting in the woods with a pile of guys and you know you're you're somewhere's way off from the pickup and you've been walking for three or four hours and a little bit of fog sales and there's no stars and we nobody carried compasses when I was a kid you know you just took off and went back to the truck but there was always those guys you know you get on the you get on flat ground it's a little different than it is in heels but there's always those guys that they are sure that the truck's that way and the truck is actually that way and that is the weirdest feeling you've ever had because you want to be nice and go with them but but but if you do you know I'm going to walk that way an hour and then I got to turn around and come right back where I'm at and so it's a little bit hard on you so so what you do is you you you know you're praying that somehow you can convince everybody this is the right direction you know and uh and you know brother Branham talks a lot about that when he talks about uh in Hurricane Mountain when he got lost chasing remember he got going around in circles but there was something about the story of Hurricane Mountain that was so powerful is that he said Remember the fog cleared enough that he got a view of Hurricane Mountain so what he needed was a view of a landmark to set a direction and once the direction was set he knew which way to walk now what we find then is that there are landmarks in the message of the hour there are quotes that stick out to the message believer and those are landmarks and we don't want to move the land and March because they're what keeps the right direction for the church for the people of God see in the season that we're living right now with all these things happening with all these troubles going on with the coved and with all the persecutions of the church and all these things it's easy for people begin to say well it looks like the church could start going through some tribulation or we've got some a great uh persecutions to happen into the church how many realizes that there's a whole movement of people that are looking for a great squeeze or a pressure to the place that the church is going to get in position if they get enough pressure put on them well I have to be honest with you you if you study very long or you're involved in a church actually the more pressure you put on people the more division comes if they don't like each other amen and you know somebody said well brother Wayne it was a I I know brother bam said some things early on but you know in 1964 mother Branham says this he said will the bride go through the persecution as the early Apostolic Church did this is a question amen will the bride go through a persecution as the early Apostolic Church did answer from a word Prophet no I just explained a few minutes ago the next thing is a rapture remember we're at the promised land we're at the border and you understand about the march of Israel now this is my thoughts ministering brother in my own way the way I feel the holy spirit is revealed to me the next thing that is to happen to the Gentile elected bride is to be caught up with the rest of the Gentile elected bride that's been down Through the Ages now the next thing so people say to me brother Wayne do you think we're going to have to go through these great trials and we're going to have a like a tribulation strike the church and there's going to be great what do you what do you think well let's ask a prophet what he thought and let that be the landmark so if it's a landmark it's the direction of the church that we're not looking for persecution we're looking for Rapture amen and it matters what you're looking for it determines on how you prepare for what you're doing if you're looking for a Rapture you want to get in the spirit of rapture if you're looking for a Rapture you want to get in the atmosphere of rapture amen now the scriptures uh declare it and I'm speaking here to a prophet he said now here in 1961 Abraham's Covenant he said now listen he says now one thing that did he did promise Abraham not one thing did he do to Abraham but what he's done to give this church except one thing that's the change of the body one thing the change of the body as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man we see the thing taking place right now what was the next thing the change of the body now here in the later in the quote the next thing coming of the Rapture of the church the change of the body of the sleeping of the Saints amen do you see what he's brother Ram is very specifically saying what we're looking to is the change of the body what we're looking for as a church is a change of the body amen now in north at night 1965 brother bam said I don't see one thing that will hinder he said the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ outside of the Readiness of the church amen there's nothing hindering this morning outside the Readiness of the church isn't that powerful Amen to know that there is no scripture barring us from the change of our body the prophet of God said the spirit of God Has Come For the setting order of the coming of the Lord now there's a lot of things that are in order and out of order and I know that but one thing is in order this morning is the change of the body listen if you're here in the middle of this meeting and you feel like changing your body just go ahead amen if you're here in this morning and the elements in your body start transitioning on you don't hold that back just let it go and the rest of us will join in with you because it's in order that's the next thing that could happen you know it can happen before you leave this meeting this morning this is so up on us in this generation it could happen before we left the meeting today I am living in expectation of the change of my body somebody said well I tell you what this one might go before the Rapture and this one might go but you know you might never have another day in your life as a mortal being there could be something strike this meeting this morning that will change your body I believe that should be the expectation of the Church of the Living God I don't believe we're expecting Amen to go through another 100 years I don't believe we're expecting a bunch of tribulation what we're expecting is one more sweep of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to catch a fire that's Church of the Living God and to change our bodies in the moment in the twinkling of an hour that is what I am under expectation for the prophet of God said let me tell you this I can prove to you those Visions none of those Visions are wrong and were they not all fulfilled yes each one of them has been fulfilled or is in the process right now amen this day this scripture where are we at in this abrahamic age he said this has been such a great time where we're standing the great hour we're living in all the Visions have been fulfilled amen now the prophet says in the Feast of the trumpets it's a mystery that's got to be revealed now in this day by the son of man the evening message he says See it'll turn it back the last sign that was seen was the discernment before the change of the body amen here again paragraph 304 the trumpet sounds for Israel two prophets is ready to appear what is it the church must get off the scene so they can appear The Church Must Get Off the scene so they can appear do you see what he's saying the prophet over and over is same this is the time for change the only thing that's holding up the tribulation is you amen the only thing that's between you and an entire world plunged into tribulation is the church that's why we don't believe the church goes through tribulation we are the ones holding the tribulation from taking place now right now we're we're all aware of this huge thing going on with Russia I mean it's all over the newspapers it's all over the news channels it's it's everywhere because even American president just said we are closer to Armageddon right now than we were since the missile crisis in the 1960s can you imagine the 1960s when they were at the brink of the of the chains right there prophet of God actually said he met one of the generals from the Army in a in a little meeting he said the man said he had received orders to fire the missile back there in the 60s he said but something wouldn't let him fire it he said brother Graham said see and a few minutes later they called him and said see it was a blip on the screen it's a good thing you didn't fire the missile he said now why didn't the missile fire he said because there was somebody left on the earth that was a reason because somebody was left on the Earth now Church of the Living God Amen that is the 1960s God was waiting for a generation now you might not think you're worth anything you might not want you might wonder why you're here this morning but God has held back the hands of the time and tribulation because there is a bride who was coming there was a generation of Promise in this Bible one that will not hinder the changing of our body there has got to be a generation on the earth that will let this word so get alive in them and it will change not only their habits they will only change the way they think it will change their mortal bodies this Russia pushing like it is amen and I'm president saying these things I believe it right now I believe it's so close I believe it's so close right now I mean you you know even the the super wealthy of the world they're buying bomb shelters and building and building uh caves out of them amen that they could hide in they're going to Ole missile silos and they're equipping them preparing to survive a nuclear war some of them amen like Elon Musk is trying to get to Mars they're they they know they know they're trying to get a different place to live they know this is coming there is no way for it to be brother man said but you know I'm glad that we have a shelter I'm glad that we have a shelter for the name of the Lord is a mighty town that the righteous can run in he said no matter how many pounds no matter how many anything else we're going to be safe there he said so the world and the sinner is having a shelter or they've got a safety place and a shaken time but I believe if I wasn't a Christian I'd go crazy thinking of what might happen anytime I know there's a bunch of mothers sitting in here right now I know amen you're wondering what's going to happen by the way and what's going to happen how's this going to happen my family what's going to take place in my kitties brother man said if he wasn't a Christian he said I would go crazy with a house full of kids and everything I wouldn't know what to do but I'm glad that I can stand in my house and introduce them to a shelter that no bomb can ever touch or nothing else under the protecting wings of the Lord Jesus Christ not by power not by my mind but by my spirit saith the Lord that is our protection we are not protected by bomb shelters we are protected by the power of the Holy Ghost the token is the Holy Ghost case pose there is no other token it is the literal life of Jesus Christ that has sheltered the Church of the Living God I'll tell you what amen I don't believe we have to be scared of hydrogen bugs amen but I believe as long as you've got Christ in your heart the best bomb shelter I know of is made out of feathers under these Wings abide don't worry about these things if you are a Christian if you are a Christian don't you worry about these things see amenities you know what I'm you know what I'm saying if you're hunting with some people and they're all saying we got to go this way to the truck and others are saying we got to go this way to the truck we need to we need to build some bomb shelters we need to get ready for this and we need to do this and we need to do this but I thank God Amen that there is a message I thank God there's a direction for the Church of the Living God I appreciate men of God that have caught the direction of God in this age you know amen I remember years ago as a young preacher here in brother Tim preach and I remember him saying something along these lines he said you know up till 1964 in the Feast of the trumpets brother random did preach persecution but there was a corner that was turned in 1964. amen and the opening of the word became a corner that purges the church not tribulation not persecution and it's a landmark and there are other men that know these landmarks are there we're not standing here by ourselves saying this is the landmark and we already go there's other men of God and have caught these things and saved them all over the world because this is a universal Rapture this is not a Rapture just for your church it's not a Rapture just for your family but this isn't a universal change it's coming over the Church of the Living God I don't care what language you speak I don't care what color you're seeing I don't care what social class you belong to amen there's a right you're coming from the church and the power of God is going to change these bodies it's the greatest bomb shelter there is if you're a Christian don't worry about these things [Applause] the door knocks let me let me show you brother Brandon's Spirit concerning this amen I stand the door knock brother Byron said something it's very good he got how many knows he ever he preached a message called the handwriting on the wall now that's a message of judgment if you ever heard one he breaks it down like Daniel shows you we're at the judgment but in a message standing at the door or not I found the prophet's spirit in a quote he said you know it's revealed to revealed in God's word to see the hour we're living in and surely we at the end yeah he was going to preach a message called handwriting on the wall but he didn't have a second service to preach so he only had one service so he would not preach the handwriting on the wall that day he waited till another time he said because I don't want to leave the people in that condition that without bringing another message to follow it to give the hope to the church that leaves the people wondering and makes them nervous he would not speak a message of judgment without speaking a message of change the prophet of God said I spoke handwriting on the wall on Sunday morning but then on Sunday night I preached the church rapturing before the tribulation so in the morning he preached judgments and in the evening time he preached a message of change and Resurrection in Rapture I don't know about you but he didn't preach the message of judgment for me he judged this world but he preached a message of rapture and changed for the Church of the Living God and I accept the message of change yes Russia is going to destroy the Vatican yes you don't have to worry about it this America is going to be in craters yes it's going to happen but before it can take place there is going to be a bride setting in glory that's the say of the Lord before it can take place before it can take place there's a church going to set in glory a prophet used the scripture and he said he told them as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Lodge he said the day lot left Sodom fire fell here that after Noah entered the Ark rain began to fall he said I can't do nothing until you come hither and God cannot do nothing in the way of judgment until the bride is out of the way do you see the anointing on us and you'll see the headship he said get out of the way Pride now how do I get out of the way I've got to get into the word and let the word begin to transform and let the spirit of God begin to move on me the planet word of the age that will begin to change me I believe we are to comfort one another with these words he says what Paul said we should comfort one another these words you know there's times in your life that only Comforts you're going to get is the word there's no comfort in the news there's no comfort in the world but in the word of God there's a comfort laying there if you believe it now God does nothing without purpose I'm absolutely positive God does nothing without purpose so if there is a tribulation there is a purpose for tribulation and if you discover the purpose then you know what's going on at that time the purpose of God was was divided in a three-part purpose by a prophet of the age now can I say this very clearly one of those purposes was not to destroy his bride now you say well brother Wayne when this takes when this Rapture takes place he said with all the Believers families wife and children go he said they are in faith and trusting in Jesus will they go yes yes will my family go on the Rapture yes now I when I was preaching a couple years ago I was looking at this quote and there was actually a sister on the line listening to when I was preaching she wasn't even in the church and told me after the service she said I've been worried day and night about my new babies wondering what was going to happen if judgment would fall if I would go on the Rapture would I leave my children at home he spent the prophet of God's asked the question I'm sure mother asked it amen will they go with us he said yes yes that's two and will they go in the family in the yes he says yes yes yes yes yes they will go you say preacher why in the world would you bring that up because you don't have to be old to go in the rapture you don't have to be dead to go in the Rapture listen the same God that can take an old person and make him young again can take a young person and make them 20 years old it doesn't matter which way God changes the body he can change the body he can listen I'm I'm I'm nowhere I'm standing he met his sharing roles beyond the curtain of time she was a six-month-old baby and she was 18 years old in the vision so God took me young and made them 20 year old and he took me all and he made him 20 year old because that's the age of the theophany he's a 20 year old brother man said a perfect place a perfect shape and God does nothing without purpose six sealed brother man said threefold to the purpose was number one he said of course it's to purge the foolish virgin he said of course it's the purge the hundred and forty four thousand and then it's to purge the Earth but the most beautiful part of that is what's not in his purpose not one place in that scripture will you find in the Sixth Seal that the bride is in there you can break it up any way you want you can dig it from corner to corner I have went over the Sixth Seal with every which direction you can go over it the bride is not in the tribulation you can't find her in there you can't put her in there you can't imagine her in there because God said she wouldn't be in there oh so preacher what are you saying there's no reason for her to be in there God would have to have a reason to put her there but he has no reason because the tribulation is to purge them who have not been formally purged but the prophet of God said it ought to be truly settled in every believer's heart the church the tribulation period you cannot put nowhere the church and tribulation the church sure but not the bride the bride is gone she has not won sin against her at all the grace of God is covered her the bleach of every has took every sin so far away there's not even a remembrance of the sin it's a thing of Purity perfect in the presence of God he said preacher how can you teach and a church don't go through tribulation because there's no reason for her to go in the tribulation there is not one sin against her at all oh Church the prophet of God said it's been took so far away from you the church has already been judged another quote and have accepted the blood and how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless I don't know what you think about yourself but this is a word Prophet he's not in the first pool here he's not in the second poll here he's in the third pool here he's not Discerning the heart of man he's not prophesied over you he's Discerning the heart of God he's looking in God's heart and he said he has not one thing against you at all said preacher what does that mean that means that somebody's sitting here right now is already absolutely sinless before the almighty God and either that's the truth or it ain't but if it is the truth then why are we living like we're underprivileged children and we're borrowing time and somehow something's going to catch up listen God don't have anything against you God ain't sitting there waiting just to smash you like a bug amen he is a god of Mercy he is a god of Grace and he is forwarding this bride from the foundations of the world that she might be holy and Without Blame before him in love he doesn't have one thing against her at all oh brother you say there ain't such a person brother man said it you say there ain't such a person he said every born-again believer every True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God [Applause] will how many born-again Believers we got here [Applause] absolutely perfectly sinless before God how can you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus is between him and God that would scatter sin until there be nothing left of it you said brother Wayne but I know about something happened back there in this ain't nothing left of it it's a preacher it's in my memory that's all right but it ain't God's [Applause] it matters who remembers it and God said he don't remember you might not be able to forgive but he has access to the Sea of his forgetfulness where he has took in our sins and thrown them into the sea somebody said well you ought not preach about the blood why not it's the promises of God is it not is that all we're supposed to do is beat you over the head with some kind of judgment is that all we're supposed to do is line everybody up and preach legalism every week well that might work for a foolish version but not for this bloodball bride listen you got the wrong class of people this bride has been in the blood of Jesus Christ and God is obliterated ever see him that's against that bride and because she stands there spotless before him it gives her our confidence before her God you can't make him a sinner now in the time of trouble he would hide me see you got to know who you are in the Bible I believe you need to identify who you are in scripture amen if you can see who yourself then you know what's coming amen if you can only remember and realize that there are types in scripture that's called bride types and one of the bright types was Rebecca amen everybody said well brother random wasn't nearly easy well if he wasn't you ain't Rebecca but if he was you are Rebecca and if you're Rebecca you were found in the evening light you wasn't found in the Morning Light it wasn't found in the Noonday but in the evening time elieza found Rebecca coming to the well at the time of the virgins he didn't know who he was there to choose but God had forordained it and the reason she received the message of Elisha is because the angel that sent him went with him and with 30 minutes in front of him and prepared the heart of her to receive that message before it was ever spoke to her you don't think God didn't prepare you before the foundations of the world before God ever even wrote the Bible he already knew who you were where you'd be found and what time listen I know what I'm talking about here there are people in this Bible that don't come to light to a certain moment in Scripture come on how long was Ray have the hearted out there in Jericho she was there the whole time that Moses was out there in the wilderness but she never came in light but the minute Joshua began to crush the Jordan there was a light that shined and there as she was in the promises under Joshua there's things written in this Bible you won't find till you come under evening light and in the evening light it began to reveal that was a Rebecca and Rebecca was a special woman she didn't really care about the gifts as much as she cared about making it to Isaac remember what they did with her they come amen and she was impressed with everything but really what she wanted was to go to Isaac that's really what she wanted was to to get on that Camel and go to the one that was the Lord and the owner of all the gifts come on church amen she wasn't just she wasn't just satisfied with a little gift she wanted to own the guy that give the gift [Applause] now I know there's a bunch of dirty Devils that'll take that try to make something else out of it but the point is he didn't only have a few he had them all come on church amen well we'll fight that another day but I'll say this to you amen Rebecca got up there on that Camel because she was given the opportunity to go to Isaac but she needed a ride brother come on she needed a ride how are you ever going to get there without help how are you going to get there without a ride and whatever brought Ellie easier was what was going to take her home whatever brought he must hurry right out of there and I say this I believe God sent this message I believe the Holy Ghost sent this word and if God brought the prophet on the Holy Ghost he'll take the bride out on the same Trail come on I'm riding on it I'm not riding on Theology and may have made ideas but the person of Christ has come among the church come on I think it's time to get on your horse and ride this message is supposed to make a second ride when I'm looking at it right here this morning it's happening the vision is in front of us well by the way and I can't take all this horror and you people do around here find out your type we don't go through tribulation but brother we do praise God come on we're not going to walk to our Isaac We're not gonna have to borrow a ride but we're going to praise God because Rebecca watered the cannibals of Isaac so the Church of the Living God will water the movie of the Holy Ghost say well why she's shouting so much her name is Rebecca she can't help it it's her time she can't outlive her time but thank God that if God had a type there is a greater time when the Fulfillment of it comes [Applause] so by the way and I'll tell you what man I don't know about all this well you get to watering it you'll find out brother man said that Camel represented a power and it's the power of the Holy Ghost that takes you to meet your Isaac and it's not some figment of my imagination there is a real Isaac come on everybody's trying to get us off of the camel we're trying to say well we've already met her Isaac I know the word has come I'm good with that I have no problem I have met the word I have met the revealed word but there is a Corporal body of Jesus Christ that is in another dimension and I am going to take the ride that God sent into the chairs to change Dimensions your bus won't get me there your airplane won't get me there your space shuttle won't get me there but the power of the Holy Ghost will break from one dimension to another dimension you got to know your types come on in the scripture you're a Rebecca in the scripture in the scripture you're the woman that Joseph met while he was in Egypt amen wasn't even of the Israel blood at all but while they thought he was dead while they thought that he was dead and had been done gone away but before Joseph ever before Joseph ever got captive before he was ever beaten before the blood was put on the Garment and taken to his father before any of that ever happened there was a vision that was a dream there was something that was out in front of him now watch the beauty of this because whenever they took those garments and told his father he was dead Israel believed he was dead he wasn't dead at all he was the Lord of another country he was the Lord of another people and out of that people he took his bride but brother now you say well he forgot Israel no he didn't they asked him one time said can you forget Israel he said prophet he said take a measure and stick and measure the sea amen count the Stars he said I cannot he said and neither could I ever forget Israel a mother my forget her suckling babe but I can never forget Israel and God's got Israel on his mind he's going to have Israel again but the scripture teaches us when he begin to reveal himself to his brother and he could not do that until his wife was in the palace I'll tell you what God cannot reveal himself to those Jews until this bride is sitting in the palace and to get to the Palace you need a ride you tell me how you're going to get there without the holy ghost ride but God sent a ride to take us from one dimension so brother Wayne can I get a ticket sure the token is available today [Applause] what I got to pay pay for now if the trumpet would give an uncertain sound who could prepare who can make preparations well I need to prepare I'll tell you what I'm preparing for paradox I'm preparing for Paradox that's actually what I'm doing in my little my little office sitting listening to those tapes what are you doing in there I'm preparing for something I'm not just preparing to speak to you I'm preparing to change these items now the change of this body according to Philippians 3 and 20 Paul said our conversation is in heaven which also we look for a savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vowel body Let It Be fashioned like an unto his golden glorious body according to the work of whereby he is able to subdue all things now of course this this word vile actually speaks of humiliation that's that's what the word means a vile body is a humiliated body it's a it's a it's a body of humiliation brother random in the junction of time said thankful Lord that someday we're going to be changed that this Old Vile body of humiliation that we live in will be changed and fashioned and made like an unto your body can you can you imagine God is promising the church that you're going to move from that body you're in to a body like God himself is dwelling in heaven except this will only be the body who has no scars this Tabernacle of humiliation amen we are veiled in these Tabernacles this is the earnest of our perfect and complete Redemption back there like it was in the Garden of Eden we have a foretaste of Glory Divine by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the refreshment coming from the presence of God to the water of the church to make it grow in Grace and when we have sick and have Redemption the blessing the attributes of Christ Divine Healing as a four sign to someday this Mortal will take on immortality someday this Mortal will take on immortality the prophet of God said like this someday we're going out of this tent someday from this Dwelling Place the Tabernacle of our humiliation we're going to be changed we're going to step over in another Land where's Purity when our feet first touches that blessed land when The Old Ship of Zion blows for landing we'll rush out and it's going to be over then sickness and cripples and afflictions and everything will be gone old age death sorrow natural things that was caused by this curse will be gone forever we'll be changed will be changed now look this is what he did for Abraham and this is what he's going to do for you I'm thankful to know that there is a change coming no matter what is happening in the world there is a change coming see we could look at our we could look at our Humanity today and we could say by this Humanity how could you think that there's going to be a change because of everything we are everything we look at everything about us is humiliation but do you know that the only man who was ever born right was our Lord Jesus Christ and our Lord Jesus Christ actually put aside his garments in heaven and came into the Earth and took on mortal flesh and he himself put up a tent of humiliation and stepped into humiliation so he could come to the place where you are and show you that God can take you from humiliation to glorification as a Son of God look what he did our lord Jesus he came down into the degradation of humanity you wasn't actually born here Amen in the world you wasn't supposed to be like this things were not supposed to be this way at all you should have never sinned you should have never had the first struggle with trials you should have never had the first problems in your life amen if things would have been as they were in the original Adam would have brought you in the Garden of Eden and there would have been no struggles there would have been no trials there would have been no problems come on now but God rich and mercy wanted you to know he was a Healer he wanted you to know he was a savior he wanted you to know so God allowed the fall to take place but listen before there was a fall there was a redeemer before there was sin that was a that was a savior before there was sickness that was a Healer amen before it could come into this place it was already something that could get you back to where you come from now our lord Jesus came down as our representative as a human almighty God came down and took upon him the degradation now I think it's amazing when you read the scriptures and you find out that our lord Jesus himself became humiliated while he was in the Earth our lord Jesus was humiliated now I know some of you are being humiliated by your trials by your diseases by your struggles by your problems by your human body it is humiliating for a millionaire to live in a shack it's humiliating that you have been removed from that great position of heaven and have been stuck in this Tabernacle of humiliation brother man calls a pest house where all the disease are living you're humiliates back be like a millionaire living down in one of the boarding houses in Shreveport in the slums down there and he's trying to explain to everybody in there look I really don't belong here I'm really a millionaire and and they're all looking like yeah you're just another bum like we are amen it's a humiliating position to be in but he really does have a place and I know people look at us and they think well y'all's just a nuts and nobody's but you don't understand that before I was here I was in the mind of God as the Son of God and when all of this is over I've got a mansion on the hilltop no wonder the world's fighting so hard that's all they've ever got but you and I amen we've got a place to go amen our Lord came down humbled himself and came into this Earth humiliated himself and he was amen that we could be brought nigh to God you know the Bible said that he was humiliated in judgment listen friends I I don't know if you ever read these areas in the Bible but if you read up there about the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus it's the most humiliating scene in the entire Bible that the king of all the kings the greatest Majesty of all majesties never was a man like him never was a man who ever be like him he was our Lord Jesus Christ and rather than honoring him and rather than crowning him with a king and putting him upon the throne they gave him a crown of thorns and they put him upon a cross and crucified him now why did they do that for you and me now I don't know sometimes if you want to stop and think about it a minute but whatever's whatever struggles you're going through whatever humility you're in I want you to know he took our shame when they beat him and they beat him at that post and they put him under judgment do you know he had a walk of shame like you would never walk in your life he walked from that beaten post to Calvary and let me tell you something he didn't stop halfway he didn't get under the load of the struggle and the problems and all the issues that was going on and say well never mind you say well he was just the anointed Son of God but you know the prophet of God said that he separated from the spirit of God In The Garden of Gethsemane and he went to the Cross as a man I don't know if you've ever thought about it but he was a mighty conqueror brother he was more than just a conqueror he was a mighty conqueror he didn't only conquer sin and disease he conquered the flesh and he obeyed God even when it meant the crucifixion of every desire the crucifixion of every hope and every every desire and every hope you know this Bible says he was tempted in every light man a man you are he wasn't a fake man he wasn't a half man he was an angel man the Bible said he came lower than the angels and took upon him the Seed of Abraham that he might be tempted in every light manner come on you're sitting there saying well I tell you what I don't know if he could survive the age we're in listen he took every bit of the Temptation you took and he supremely ruled over it come on Amen zachday at Calvary he took every devil every sin every demon and he carried them with him in the flesh unto Calvary a place he could destroy them I tell you what if you want to destroy spirits take them to Calvary [Applause] now the prophet has not taught us a lesson didn't he he said if you want to if you want to make a difference in your life and you want a new beginning a new start he said drive a steak drive a steak amen you didn't see brother Brandon was taking God's principle when God got ready to do away with all your sin when he got ready to change the entire plan when you got ready to reverse the problems God drove a stake and put the bloody son Jesus Christ on the state and said from this day forward sin is defeated sickness is defeated from this they fall Church of the Living God Jesus Christ is our Passover Lamb we're not looking for another sacrifice we are not looking for another Blood there is one man between God and man and that is the man Christ Jesus it's a preacher what are you saying I'm saying it's the way to start over God gives you ways to start over I'm going to preach to you a minute I feel it in the room God gives you a way to start over why don't you just start over today I read in the Bible I read back there when Joshua got ready to go in the promises just like you are ready to go into the promises but between him and the promises was a Jordan is that right but it wasn't a Jordan at any time it was a Jordan that had full banks you said why did it have full banks because the latter rains had come and the latter rains had blocked him off from that land but you know what God told him Joshua it's time for you to quit delaying these things Rise Up from where you are and cross this Jordan you know what he did he told he told the ferris excuse me told the doctors he told the men of God he said put put the word upon your shoulders and take off towards that Creek you take off toward that River and when you step into it it'll open up now they didn't know what was going to happen when they got there but they were definitely knew they were packing the word that would change everything they knew they had a word that could cause anything to happen brother you know what they did when they put their foot in there the Waters of the Jordan dried up in front of them and they walked across dry Trot into the promises of God and listen I tell you this if you're ready to walk into the promises of God God will drive for Jordan he'll pull back the Red Sea God Will Make A Way when there is no way because he remains you set the Red Sea yes sir the Red Sea you know what the prophet said he said God had Moses at the Red Sea to give you an example that when there is no way God Will Make A Way and let me tell you God's Made A Way by sending the message of the hour you know what happened when they when they crossed that sea you know what they told them when they crossed that Jordan River amen God told Joshua we said go get some stones and stack them up over here you know what he did he stacked up Stones right where those priests stood that day stacked them up right there because whenever the waters began to get lower whenever the waters would be moved they would be revealed again look at this he also made a stack upon the bank at gilgal there were two stacks of stones according to scripture amen do you know that according to to history amen that that is the same place that John the Baptist baptized Jesus Christ and when they said well you belong to this and you belong to this you know what it was he said to them God is able these stones to rise children under Abraham because if God gave a promise he's somebody it's going to fulfill the promises of God I don't care how long it's been I don't care how much troubles has happened God will fulfill his word it's also prophesied that's the same place that Elijah parted the waters and walked across dry trod and when Elisha got on the other side amen he didn't amen that that great that great range that great cloak began to come out of the Rapture cycle and fell on the ground Elisha didn't run around and say oh amen Prophet said this and and the prophet said now hey that's the Garment let the prophet hey that's what the prophet wore that's that's what the prophet had he didn't do that brother you know what he did he reached out and picked it up he took off the old clothes and he put on the new Elijah's message is a message of change it's time to change your garments take off this old coat and put on a new coat he took that coat and he struck the Waters of the Jordan and he said where is the god of Elijah and Elisha picked up where Elijah left off no he wasn't a part of the first pool no he wasn't a part of the second pool but he was a part of the third by predestination [Applause] so preacher what do you say and I'm saying if you say something about the third pool these days there's a bunch of heretic preachers they'll say well if you've got a third pool where's your first pull if you've got a third pole where's your second pull well the first two pulls were ministered by an Angel in 1947. hello church and the minister and Angel is assigned the hand the gift of discernment which was a Messianic sign that was given one time to an age amen but that third poll was the opening of Seven Seals which hid our mystery of redemption before the I'm a part of that third pool by predestination the word is what's changing this Pride notify somebody there's a lot of people that's got their names on that book but you're the first people to know your name is on that book and I'll tell you something I like better than that we as a bunch of preachers get the privilege to know we are preaching to people that's going to be that there ain't nothing in the world better than to know you're going to be successful and what you're doing and I am not preaching a message of rights are in vain but there will be some that are setting here today that will be apart I feel change well brother Wayne it's just been too long now tell me God waited 40 years to put Joshua in the land but when he went over do you know what time of day it was do you know what time of year it was do you know the season it was it was the same exact season when they come out as the very day they come out of Egypt when God had the children of Israel come out of Egypt in the Passover of Exodus 12. amen God said let it be a beginning of months unto you they've been down there 400 years but when God speaks to a prophet things start over [Applause] things begin when God's word comes to a prophet and they started over look what happened amen it broke open on them A New Beginning happened amen you said preachers new beginnings of course that's what happened at the Jordan that's exactly the same season that Ruth came and Naomi into the Moab eyes it's the same season and that's the season we are living in said preacher how do we get there amen there is a lamb it's a Passover Lamb who took on our degradation took on our humiliation I don't know what pictures you're looking at but they're very nice to our Lord but in actuality he had no loincloth now y'all you young men here despite you girls you young men one of the of you come up here and pull your shirt off in your pants and stand here and you stand here in your Skippers why wouldn't you do it it's humiliating isn't it it's shameful well listen they didn't even give you the Lord that much grace they put him before the entire world stripped naked on a cross beaten and riveted to shame him he said why would God allow it because you would never have to be ashamed again he took every bit of the shame upon your lives and upon the sin and upon the struggles that way when you get ready to go into Heavens amen you don't have to walk into heaven with your head bowed as a shameful bride but you're going to go back in the master of glory and the power thrust in the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's no more shame left on her that's no more the sin left on her not one Speck of sin a prophet has took the word and he's washed us and he's clearanced us the Bible said there will be a spotless bride it's not coming brother you are now The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ [Applause] I feel like I'm coming apart Hallelujah I said God there's a mercy in his act of humiliation he glorified you in his act of Shame he took the shame off of you thank you there's no soap will do it come on there's no there's no man that could do it but the blood that ease from his veins with the blood of almighty God it was a blood that washed it's the Fuller soap it's the thing that can wash any heart brother I'm talking about the blood of Jesus I'm talking about the lowest drags of humanity bring them in we'll wash them with the blood we gotta we got a soap that'll clean up their clothes it'll clean up their hair it'll clean up their makeup it'll clean up their lives this is the bleach of the blood you don't have to humiliate yourself no longer sister he was made lower than the angels and took upon him the Seed of Abraham and became the lowest among men being a footworks flucky he washed the Stitch from the feet of men who was much lower than him but being God he could humble himself he could do what no man could do no man could humble himself that long but the king of all glory could take himself beneath the lowest sinners in town and washed their feet amen with a Grace and the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ to clean them up yeah you you think about this you think about this God that could change he could so change lives he could so change them that when he got done with him the scripture says here he said who that can change I vile body look at this he said when you see all these problems come look up your Redemption when you see Russia threatening you'll see America bombing when you see these problems happening look up your Redemption draweth nigh why are we looking up look what the scripture said it said for our conversation is in heaven which also we look for our savior the Lord Jesus Christ who can change our vile bodies because we could look the word look actually speaks about amen it looks it's talking about people who have their conversation in heaven amen when you read the when you read the breakdown in the Greek on the word conversation there do you all know it actually speaks of a different kind of language that the people who are in Christ speak a different kind of language it's the truth you have a language of faith and it's sponsored by the word of God you were taught this in early stages of Christian Life and the longer you speak it the more developed you become and the more articulative you become and the more powerful your words become because it is the language of Faith which God has given a master's degree in this age a perfect faith we were not promised a perfect Faith decree in the Millennium but in the age of laodicea when every devil in every struggle and every darkness is upon the Earth God said I'll give you a language I'll give you a language that will change things it'll speak squirrels into existence it'll change the atmospheres it'll bring things back it'll wash the heart of a sinner it'll create an atmosphere in the church to change hearts and lives what is it it's a language that comes because we're citizens now I tell you what I I love how I love how they rendered this part right here somebody wrote it I don't even know who wrote it I thought it was powerful it said we Christians are citizens of a kingdom not of this world it actually means we're a colony of Heaven oh that we're really not a British colony we're a Heavenly colony now some of you folks here is from Africa this morning know you grew up speaking French and you're from and you're from a a totally country who was not French at all but the moment the French conquered your country the the African languages became the language of their conquerors that's why you can go to South Africa and you get to English and you go up to the Congo you get the French they still have a native language but another language has overcome and they speak it predominantly over and you go to one country it's one language one country another language it's the same continent different languages because of the conquers that live there and so is it in the Church of the Living God that's why you go to denominations and they speak a language and they speak Presbyterian and they speak Baptist and they speak Catholic but there is a bride who has a restored language of the original conquering power of my Lord Jesus Christ it's the word of faith Paul said which we preach and it is now the even inside now it's the most powerful language it will help you produce the name of Jesus Christ to say it with Clarity and power and when you speak that name of course that language has a citizenship a language the prophet of God said listen to me you should never say you're weak well my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking here's language you must never say that you remember your mama used to tell you don't you say that word I'm gonna wash your mouth out [Applause] I blew Suds for years I go to say something suds hey man I had a good Mama well if you ever get the Holy Ghost it's like having Mama on the inside you start to say something that ain't right and something will come on you and say don't say that boy you start to say well I'm no good some said don't you say that don't you go out with that because I have adorned you I have washed you I have clothed you I said come and walk with me Thou Art Worthy what rights you've got to say you're not worthy he said your word if he says you're worthy you're worthy I don't want to throw my wife under the bus honey I was walking through the house the other day and I said something real nice to her like hey I love you how do you show our pretty today yeah she said something about cooking I said I sure do like my I sure do like that cooking she said oh it ain't no good I said look I'm leaving this room she said why are you leaving the room for I ain't gonna let you talk about my wife like that listen to me don't talk about God's bride like that you are the Bride of almighty God the queen of all of Heaven what do you mean you're not worthy what do you mean you can't do it of course you can do it through Christ you can do all things you are more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus of course I can change this body of course I can put on the elements and change this body of course I can I can't do all you know I met a guy over there and with brother Matt and I were preaching uh remember that the other day we were over there and you know was that Wichita wasn't it with brother Parker that was a brother Webster there good name right Webster after the dictionary brother Webster was a quadriplegic amen and he was sitting in my services boy he was shouting us down I mean he wasn't growing that meeting got after the service and he got over where I was at he said preacher now that's my kind of preaching he said I believe in the god of Miracles and there he sits without arms or legs he said I believe in that kind of God I was preaching about one day God's going to add limbs back sitting in the middle of meeting he said that's my promise I'm believing that one he said let me tell you something preacher when I was a kid he said I got burned up in a fire and they didn't expect me to live he said they took me down the hospital he said and they didn't care for my wounds because I was a they was afraid that I would never recover he said so the infection set in they had to cut all my limbs off to keep it from killing me he said so my grandpapping them took me in because my parents didn't want me said when they took me home and they started raising me said I think he was about 10 years old he said I was out one day he said I was standing by a pond the guy was fly fishing out there he said I thought boy that was amazing prettiest thing I ever saw somebody fly fishing he said I got to tell that guy how I want to fly fish he said he told me he said you can't do this you'll never be able to fly fish he said well I went back home he said and I told my grandpa he said I was a grinder who wouldn't have it he said to me son what's wrong with you he said well he said I wanted to fly fish and I can't fly fish he said who said you can't fly fish he said well that guy down there he said son I want to show you something and they took him inside he said bro ain't he went in there and he said he found the old dictionary I thought it was good it was a Webster you know an old dictionary down there he said he pulled that dictionary up and opened to the page of the of the of the cans and where the cane should be he said but instead of the word can't he said there was just a big black blob he said it'd just been marked out right there he said do you see can't in this dictionary he said no it's not in this dictionary he said when my your grandma and me brought you home we knew you were going to be a special child so we took the dictionary out and we marked that out of the dictionary so that you would never think you can't do anything and I think it's time to take Kent out of the Church of the Living God yes we can we can change our body we can change the situations things can happen in our lives it's time to change our language you've underestimated these men of God you've underestimated this Pride yes they can [Music] I expect fully for things to change I expect fully for life to come and change these mortal bodies because the Bible said look for it any true expectations built by the word any true expectations built by the word the prophet of God said if you can expect it to happen if it's built on something and any true expectation is built on the word all Christianity is based on faith and as much Faith as you can have as much power as you can have the only thing that limits your power is your faith and if you turn faith loose all things are possible to them that believe as you release your faith you release it you're releasing it upon the things of God do you know that Jesus taught that his word his word was a seed now these promises that are laying here in the message of expectation brother Branham begins to quote these promises and he begins to say the gospel didn't come to us in word only but in power and demonstration he says these signs shall follow them believe now just teaching the word's not going to do this you've got to have the power of the Holy Ghost behind that word to make it come to life again brother man said you say brother Branham those things were written 2 000 years ago he said listen I will never critic to know this he said the other day in Life Magazine Gardeners of Egypt got some of that wheat that was put there there in Joseph's time they took it and planted it in the ground and it growed that seed was 4 000 years old and it growed listen to me if a natural seed can grow after four thousand years what about the seed word promises that are made to this generation I know Paul promised this to the church two thousand years ago but brother there's a germ in that seed and when the Holy Ghost comes upon the seed it begins to manifest whatever is on the inside this gospel I'm going to skip a bunch here this Gospel of course is the gospel of power it's the gospel that'll quickened the church and will transform it the prophet of God said if you want something to come to pass take the word and plant it in your heart if you want to go on the Rapture if you want to be a genuine Christian place the word Ezekiel said take this scroll and eat it up then we find out that the opening of The Seven Seals are a part of your change is it amazing that the opening of the book is what John was asked to eat that he was going to be asked to devour seed that had been sealed up and have been waiting for the time of manifestation which would be the manifestation of the sons of God do you know the whole earth has been waiting for this can you imagine this that the Bible said the whole earth was waiting and groaning for the manifestation of sons when this word is restored to Sons according to the Bible the Moon and the Sun and the planets and the earth is waiting for that time do you know the sons getting a hold of the word will set everything back in order it will deliver nature it'll deliver that the lion will lay down with the lamb it'll Deliver Us from time to Eternity I'm talking about the word now it will it will do exactly what God promised now if that word will do that for nature and that word will do that amen for the planet what would the opening of the seals do for our lives now what it is is God brings to us amen a word now the right mental attitude toward that word will bring it to pass look what he said if you ought to take that scroll and eat it up that is the Original Seed now somebody said brother Wayne someday this is going to happen brother Brown said that prophet and the word would be one as the ark and the word of God and God has promised this word and how to be fulfilled and how it will come to pass he chose his bride how it would be done and it's happening right before you in the name of the Lord brother Wayne how's all this going to happen brother Bram says it's happening before you in the name of the Lord Elaine how am I going to do all these things it's happening right now turn and tell somebody it's happening now the seed cannot grow in an atmosphere of wisdom the Holy Ghost seeds of this Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom not quoting Prophet directly but if you can get the atmosphere we already have the word it's not coming another prophet the message of William Branham is the message of our change the opening of The Seven Seals is the release of the Bride of Jesus Christ through every promise that's ever been given we already have the word God give us an atmosphere that'll make every word come to pass in its Moment In Time now he said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about you can go through you can go for a long time and you got the word you got the word you got the word but all of a sudden atmosphere change instant almost in the twinkling of an eye thought it would never change changed you walk out of the building completely different than when you came in so by the way it can't happen it's Heather cross here sitting right back there I got this from David so I wouldn't mess it up amen Heather come to these meetings it's two years ago now right one year ago Heather came to these meetings when she came in here she had been suffering with 15 years of extremely painful arthritis all kinds of doctors in the country couldn't figure out what was going wrong but Joe Adams told her he felt led to have her come through the prayer line and upon Saturday night he motioned her up in the prayer line and when y'all started praying that was an intense and radiant heat in front and above me and Heather and I and as it was standing behind her the swelling that she had experienced for that long drive from Louisiana started going down over the next few days and she has been a hundred percent better completely healed in one moment it was a tremendous Miracle God was so gracious to give our family 15 years of meetings 15 years setting in meetings just like this and over and over and over and over thinking about that healing but in one moment under inspiration Joe Adams felt led of God and God honored his leadership and the power of God healed her and today she sets a healed woman because of the atmosphere and the word of God came together if he can change if he can change the joint he can change the whole body if it could change the liver he could change the whole body if he could add the eye he could add everything oh brother Wayne it's been too long don't you go and tell me you can't don't you tell me this can't happen it's been too long well I love this Bible because it's full of people that it looked like things were just too long 12 years 12 years I believe it was she bled wasn't it 12 years let me ask you this how many hospital bills and doctor bills does a woman pilot in 12 years what would her coffee table look like after 12 years of a blood issue and she couldn't get over amen doctor visit after doctor visit after doctor visit amen going to the sanctuary and offering lambs and asking for healing and doing everything that is possible amen 12 years but somebody said there was this Messiah on the Earth but never mind him as he's just an illegitimate man and he has no real teaching he has nobody really behind him he's just kind of a free-for-all out there we really don't know about that guy amen but she had never saw him but when she heard he was passing by her way something happened in her little heart and said he's the only hope I got and the Bible says she went out there on the street and she was so shameful brother her lifestyle being under what she was she couldn't even touch him but she said if I could just touch the heel of the Garment of this man then I would be whole and the moment she touched him look what happens he turned and said virtue has gone for me what was it 12 years and in an instant she was completely whole pressure I don't know about all these things what about a man late 38 years he laid 38 years most of you ain't even 38 years old a late 38 years at the pool waiting for a healing for his body but the angel wasn't coming but they knew he was coming so they just kept waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting home at one day Jesus come walking by the well and took one man out of them all he said why are you why are you lame why why ain't you been healed how long you been coming here how long you been attending these meetings I love you why ain't you healed someone there ain't no man to help me in the water oh brother I tell you he's the man that can he's a man that can help you when nobody else can help you when nobody else will help you when nobody else sees your travel when nobody else thinks anything about you there's one here that cares about you and your situation I don't care how long I think it's safe to say his friends were tired of hearing him whining I think it was states to say he had laid there so long and everybody said don't mind him I don't think he's ever going to do anything he's going to lay here the rest of his life and it's never going to come no change to him oh but brother that morning was his morning that day was his day when Jesus come walking by amen 38 years Jesus said take your bed and walk I'll tell you don't leave there another day don't lay there another hour take up your bed and walk [Applause] oh brother Wayne I'll tell you things things happen so long well let me ask you this let me ask you this how long was Georgia Carter laying on the bed nine years the little girl laid there I tell you what when I study these things sometimes they just blow me away why would God let a girl lay nine years in that kind of shape her church her church took away all hope her church even her mama was a believer in Jesus but she said God don't do them kind of things no more that's not the ace for that God don't work miracles like that you might as well just lay there and forget all about this healing power and all this Supernatural stuff that's in days gone by but the little girl got a hold of a book can I say this she smelt the water and brother she knew somewhere there was a healing for her body [Applause] God sent a prophet down there nine years now now it's a it's an amazing story and I won't go into all of it but I won't tell you this part of it when brother random got a vision it was for one and when he got that Vision he went in the room as she was and remember what he said he said Georgie quieter in the name of Jesus Christ Rise Up from that man how many knows what she was sick with she was sick with tuberculosis tuberculosis caused by a fact of her uncle raping her and putting this kind of disease in this child's body amen some emotional hurt had so become real that it had affected the way she could live and now she was full of tuberculosis and she was laying there dying but a prophet stood there with a vision of God and said today is a day of change Rise Up from your bed Georgie and you say Preacher what's so important about that how did she get out of the bed brother how'd she do it her legs had been laying there so long she had no power she had no ability to walk but the god that told her to get up was the same God that could give her power to walk and I don't care how long you've been laying in the depths of sin and struggles of your life or whose fault it is your man forget it all rise up of your being and begin to walk in the power of God foreign I'll tell you I'll tell you as a preacher I read these things differently and I'll tell you what blew my mind when I read it was tuberculosis that got her when I read that I stepped there and just labored over that a minute and I said dear God this is not very many years past William Branham has lost his own wife to tuberculosis and now he's standing there in the face of the same demon that took his wife but under a vision he knew that God is still God it doesn't matter if someone dies with a disease it mean it was their time to go it does not mean that God lost his power over the disease the sighting thing you say preacher what are you trying to get at I'm trying to get it something right here that you're able to walk I say you're able to walk today because God has given to you amen there is one here right now that can change your body there's somebody in this building can change your mind you say we've been waiting I know he's coming I know he's coming I know the Lord is coming keep looking for him I know he's coming he said well what happens if I pass before he comes it's in the Bible already amen they came to him and they said to Robert's daughter is sick will you come and pray he said yes I will come to her and he started on his way but he was late getting there because in the middle of his journey they came and said the girl already died never mind he said no I'll go wake her [Applause] somebody said what does he mean by that brother man said it meant this it meant that her name was predestinated before the foundation of the world and though she was sleeping she could never die and he didn't only say it he proved it when he went down to her house and he called her name what'd he do he dismissed the believer unbelievers he dismissed the make-believers and had a resurrection with just a little group of people and I'll tell you what this end time Resurrection is going to take place somebody said well my loved one was well ready went on this one's already went on you will lose nothing waiting on Jesus you will lose nothing waiting on Jesus when Jesus gets here every believer that has been placed into the grave he will raise them up out of the Grave he'll call their name and no great could hold I don't care if they've been there 10 years 20 years 30 years I don't care how long they're there when he speaks the grades will open and they will raise from the dead [Applause] now job said it he said when he calls I will answer let me tell you this morning friends he's calling some of you are already resurrected I'm late I know other musicians come some of God's already called some of you you've already been resurrected you said already brother bam said your soul has already been changed [Applause] you've already left cigarettes you've already left tobacco you've already left the habits of the world the spirit quickening Power of Jesus Christ is already working on you the same one I hate time the same one that raised them is here to raise you whether they're sleeping in the grave or they're alive so brother Wayne what's the mystery of this brother Bram said that Abraham and Sarah received the word and their body materialized around that word he said preacher what are you say and I'm saying in John 14 and 19 it said because I live you live also what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is see two live two lives one's for the bride groom once for the bride but in John 14 and 20 it says this and at that day you will know that I am the Father the father me and I and you brother said what does that means it means God will become tangible he will take on flesh the changer is already in you the thing that'll change your bodies in you if they put me in the ground I'm coming up nobody's got to do nothing nobody's going to say anything he'll call and I'll answer [Applause] my goodness it's a change what will happen brother Brandon we said well he said there'll be just a change come over you somebody said brother Wayne I think when the saints appear that it's going to bring this quickening power upon the church and then we're all going to be changed well you could say that because brother Ram said maybe at one place he said you'll be out there hanging your clothes isn't that beautiful not any special day sister you're hanging your clothes and you look over and there stands a loved one he said then you'll be changed but don't get hung up there because there's another one that he says you'll get up maybe you'll be standing there and he said all of a sudden this change will come over you he said then you'll look around and you'll begin to see the loved ones that have went on already some of you will be changed and see them and some of you'll be seeing them and be changed what difference does it make you're going to change [Applause] brother Wayne what's going to happen we're going to be changed the living will be changed the dead will be changed he'll change us all if you're in the grave little man changed his teaching a bit and showed you the souls under the altar was speaking of the Jew and not the bride so the soul wasn't meaning theophany after the seals he taught us that it was an actually a body a tabernacle that you move into after you die right holding place but what about if we're alive he said that body come get us can you imagine right now that spirit that keeps sweeping through this room back and forth is preparing you for change okay the the feeling of that anointing when it comes that sweeping spirit same thing that changes your body the seed is already planted we're looking for the atmosphere to change I say let us have a body change in atmosphere welcome the one that changes everything can you imagine right now can you imagine this right now if you looked up brother Charlie come walking out on the platform with us don't think I'm a fool it's going to happen some of you are going to see it I really believe God will let some of the dear ones to us I believe that we may be having these fall meetings and sister Karen come I think the last time I was in a good meet my sister Karen she was running she was literally running around the place she was supposed to be uh supposed to be in a bed with stroke or something somebody sang a song she took off I seen I seen a miracle running the building I believe this I believe we could look around an 18 year old sister Karen come running right through here with us so I don't believe all that running stuff let me tell you something let me tell you something you let me look in a mirror at a 21 year old man you ain't never seen a fit in your life you ain't never seen shouting you ain't never seen dancing Jimbo if you looked over right now sister can't stand over her arm around you I figure a jig would be in that order so by the way and I don't know about all that listen amen I don't know about you but when I get in heaven I'm going to have the time of my life but why wait till we get to heaven [Music] I already got a promise and if I act like this with promise What's it gonna be when it actually changes on our flesh this ain't a power dream this ain't an imagination the feeling that's in our body will develop a change how the twinkling of an eye and we'll have new bodies the dead will be raised brother I tell you you ain't ever you ain't never Spirits nothing like what we're about to experience it won't just be brother Branham it won't miss brother Tim it won't be this brother Wade and Apostle Paul it won't just be the men of God who's been through the ages come on y'all know what mother Brown said he said he'd let us get together he said and let us meet one another he said and get all of that out of the way he said because the next thing we were going to do we were going to meet the Lord Jesus Christ brother let me tell you something you can say he's just a figment you can say he's just a spirit you can say whatever you want to say but that is my Jesus and one of these days I'm going to print my hands on those male scarred feet I'm gonna put my hands upon the face that died for me I'm going to be able to touch the body brother it's a promise I'm gonna see him and I'm gonna be with him for that eternity you can call me a fool you can call me crazy but brother one of these mornings you call me gold I won't be here I won't be on the search no more I'm gonna go home with my Lord I believe it if you said by the way there's a lot more to it I agree I got a bunch more here but I don't have time to preach it today friends change is upon using I believe it today God bless you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] well won't it be your time [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign
