[44:14] Words of Life Lord come forth
[44:17] in Jesus name amen amen if you have your
[44:21] Bibles with you and you'd like to turn
[44:22] with me to
[44:24] Psalms 42 and 1.
[44:28] Psalms 42 and 1.
[44:38] we'll read down through verse 7.
[44:41] it says as the heart panteth after the
[44:45] water Brooks
[44:46] so panteth my soul after thee o God
[44:51] my soul thirsteth for God
[44:53] for the Living God When shall I come and
[44:57] appear before him my tears have been my
[45:00] meat day and night while they
[45:01] continually say unto me where is thy God
[45:05] when I remember these things I pour out
[45:08] my soul in me for I had gone with the
[45:11] multitude I went with them to the house
[45:13] of God with the voice of joy and praise
[45:16] with a multitude that kept holy day why
[45:20] art thou cast down O my soul and why art
[45:22] thou disquieted in me
[45:24] hope thou and God for I shall yet praise
[45:28] him for the help of his countenance
[45:30] oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me
[45:33] therefore will I remember thee from the
[45:36] land of Jordan and of the hermanites and
[45:39] from the hill of Mazar deep calleth unto
[45:43] deep at the noise of thy water spouts
[45:46] all thy waves and thy Billows are gone
[45:50] over me
[45:51] I'd also like to read Psalm 63 and 1 it
[45:54] says
[45:55] o God Thou Art my God how many can say
[46:00] that tonight
[46:01] early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth
[46:05] for thee My Flesh longareth for thee in
[46:09] a dry and thirsty land where no water is
[46:15] amen you may have your seats tonight we
[46:18] pray the Lord or add his Blessing to the
[46:20] reading of the word I'd like to speak to
[46:22] you for just a moment tonight on The
[46:25] Thirst of the ages
[46:27] The Thirst
[46:29] of the ages and
[46:31] we know that God made man to fellowship
[46:34] with him
[46:36] we know that he was made to walk with
[46:38] him and to talk with him and and to
[46:41] dwell with him and and there's a place
[46:43] in the heart of man that still Longs for
[46:48] that Fellowship today it Longs for that
[46:51] communion with God and and the reason
[46:54] that is is because man was made to
[46:57] thirst
[46:58] we saw David talking about how much he
[47:01] thirsted and how much he longed for God
[47:03] and and man was made to thirst and and
[47:06] what thirst is is the recognition
[47:09] of a need for water
[47:12] it is the craving that results in the
[47:16] Basic Instinct to drink
[47:19] physically and spiritually man was made
[47:22] that he could not live without water
[47:25] he can't live without water the general
[47:27] consensus is that you can live for about
[47:29] three days without anything to drink and
[47:32] and if you don't drink anything you will
[47:35] become dehydrated and then body
[47:36] functions will start to shut down so so
[47:39] Somewhere In the period of that three
[47:41] days even if you're not dead yet because
[47:43] there's lots of levels of Health between
[47:45] healthy and dead
[47:47] but somewhere between that things are
[47:49] going to begin to shut down and and
[47:51] things are going to not function in the
[47:54] manner that they were intended to
[47:56] operate in so to live and to be healthy
[47:59] you must take in a certain amount of
[48:01] water on a daily basis
[48:05] a certain amount of intake needs to come
[48:07] in of water each and every day or else
[48:10] you begin to face the consequences of
[48:13] dehydration
[48:15] I dare say that with the natural typing
[48:17] the spiritual we got a lot of people
[48:19] walking around spiritually dehydrated
[48:21] today
[48:23] because there is a certain amount of
[48:24] water that you have to intake listen if
[48:27] you can only go three days before you
[48:29] die how is it that we can go from
[48:31] Wednesday all the way to Sunday without
[48:33] drinking how is it we can go from Sunday
[48:35] all the way to Wednesday without
[48:37] drinking I'll say this you might not be
[48:39] dead but you're somewhere in between
[48:41] healthy and dead things are not
[48:43] operating the way they should be
[48:45] operating if you're not taking in the
[48:47] water that your soul needs you to take
[48:49] in to function on a daily basis we have
[48:53] got to be drinking and in taking water
[48:56] from that well I say tonight we got to
[48:59] take another drink we have to take
[49:02] another drink tonight of that living
[49:04] water and then we don't wait till Sunday
[49:06] to take our next drink if you take a
[49:09] drink tonight then take another drink in
[49:11] the morning and then take another drink
[49:13] sometimes around midday and then take
[49:15] another drink sometime tomorrow night
[49:17] and every opportunity that you have
[49:19] through the day you need to be drinking
[49:22] from the Fountain of life we got to be
[49:24] taking it in we got to feed our
[49:26] experience we got to seek for a greater
[49:29] experience we got to get away from the
[49:32] mentality of will I drink on Sundays or
[49:35] I drink on Wednesdays or I drink at the
[49:37] special meetings or I drink at the youth
[49:40] camps or or even worse yet I took a
[49:42] drink 30 years ago from the Fountain of
[49:45] Life so I'm good
[49:47] come on now you can't go that long

[53:06] find you at
[53:08] he says it's still flowing
[53:10] he says the fountain is still flowing
[53:13] how there's something about getting into
[53:15] a flowing stream
[53:18] we don't got many of them around here
[53:19] that's why we have bayous
[53:22] but if you ever get into a flowing
[53:24] stream you know
[53:25] it's fun when it's ankle deep
[53:27] it's fun when it's knee-deep
[53:30] but when it's really a gusher and it's
[53:31] really flowing the deeper it gets the
[53:33] more powerful it is
[53:35] oh come on somebody you ever throw
[53:37] something in a flowing stream and then
[53:39] watch it it's gone in a minute you throw
[53:40] it in a snagnet pool and it sits there
[53:42] and it stays there you throw your sins
[53:44] in a stagnant pool and well there they
[53:46] are throw your sickness in a stagnant
[53:48] pool well there it is though your

[54:07] and let the gusher wash them all away
[54:09] take your pastor away take your failures
[54:12] away and be washed clean tonight
[54:16] Hallelujah
[54:22] see the enemy recognizes
[54:25] as he usually does
[54:28] he's good at recognizing
[54:31] but he recognizes the importance
[54:34] of water to the believer
[54:37] he recognizes that you can't live
[54:40] without it
[54:42] and so he does all that he can do to
[54:45] keep you away from it
[54:48] he will Point everything there is
[54:51] to keep you out of the house of God
[54:54] he will point to you everything there is
[54:56] any failure any anything any hypocrite
[54:59] you know I saw a thing that I can't
[55:01] claim credit for it
[55:03] I saw this thing where this guy was
[55:05] talking about not going to church
[55:06] because of all the hypocrites
[55:09] he said man there are sinners there
[55:12] he said there's people there struggling
[55:15] there's people there in all this and
[55:17] this other fella said yeah man
[55:19] he said that's the same reason I don't
[55:20] go to the gym
[55:23] he said there's people that are out of
[55:24] shape
[55:26] there's fat people there
[55:28] the other guy said do you ever stop to
[55:30] think that's why the Gym's there
[55:33] to help those people
[55:35] you ever stop to think of why the church
[55:37] exists we're here to help the ones
[55:40] that's struggling we're here to pick up
[55:41] those that are having a hard time we're
[55:43] here to be to put our harm around the
[55:45] one that's been a hypocrite and say you
[55:47] don't got to be a hypocrite you can be
[55:49] real you can be genuine you can be an
[55:52] overcomer I say lay aside your excuses
[55:54] tonight and get back to the well get
[55:57] back to the water
[55:59] we're here for that to be a place where
[56:02] people can come and drink where people
[56:04] can be restored
[56:07] he does everything he can do to try to
[56:09] keep you away
[56:10] to stop your access to the water
[56:14] he tries to stop the flow
[56:16] he tries to quench your thirst
[56:20] with things of the world
[56:23] I said at the beginning that God made
[56:25] man to thirst
[56:27] it's natural for you to have cravings
[56:31] it's natural for you to have have these
[56:34] desires but those cravings and those
[56:37] desires no speeching speaking
[56:39] spiritually now that thirst
[56:41] on the inside of you was put there so
[56:44] you would recognize your need of water
[56:48] what what are you talking about life
[56:50] giving water
[56:53] those things were put there on the
[56:55] inside of you so that you could
[56:57] recognize that you needed the Water of
[56:59] Life you were to hunger you were made by
[57:03] almighty God to hunger and thirst for
[57:06] righteousness
[57:08] you were made to thirst after more of
[57:11] God
[57:12] and God intended to be the thirst
[57:14] quencher
[57:16] he put the thirst in you so that you
[57:19] would desire more of him so that he
[57:21] could come to you and then quench that
[57:23] thirst that was his intentions he says
[57:27] now but God in his great economy for
[57:29] mankind has made man in the way that he
[57:33] wanted man to be he made man to thirst
[57:36] did you notice David here said my soul
[57:40] thirsteth for thee as in a dry land
[57:43] where there's no water just imagine said
[57:45] my soul is so thirsty God I'm thirsting
[57:49] for you just as if I was in a land where
[57:51] there was no water he must find water or
[57:55] perish
[57:57] oh can we get to that place tonight God
[57:59] I've got to find you or I'm going to
[58:00] perish
[58:01] I've got to have a drink from that well
[58:03] tonight or I'm going to perish
[58:06] he says God made man two thirst for God
[58:09] and the devil now listen close has
[58:12] perverted it and made him thirst for his
[58:16] kingdom
[58:17] for the world do you get it The Thirst
[58:20] in man is Godly for God made the man to
[58:24] thirst
[58:25] for God
[58:27] but Satan recognized long ago
[58:30] that if he gave man other options
[58:34] listen we all know we're supposed to
[58:36] drink water and it's healthy but how
[58:37] many of us reach for it
[58:43] maybe I'm the only one I'm pretty guilty
[58:45] of well I need some water I need a Coke
[58:49] man I'm thirsty
[58:51] let me get a Diet Coke because that
[58:53] makes it better
[58:57] man with options usually doesn't do too
[58:59] good
[59:01] Satan gives man
[59:03] all these other options and man would
[59:05] begin burying the desire that that God
[59:08] had gave him bearing a desire for God by
[59:11] satisfying that thirst with ungodly
[59:15] things
[59:17] now think about it now that thirst in
[59:19] man is for God
[59:21] and it's for the living water but man
[59:23] goes about choosing other things to
[59:25] satisfy that thirst
[59:27] so the devil came in and he perverted
[59:30] The Thirst and he knew if he could mess
[59:31] with the receptors
[59:33] in other words think about what would
[59:35] happen to you if your body never told
[59:38] you you were thirsty
[59:40] if the receptors in your brain got
[59:42] fouled up to where you never knew you
[59:44] were thirsty you never had a desire to
[59:47] drink physically what would happen to
[59:48] you you would die
[59:51] and so he comes in and and he starts to
[59:54] it's the same thing spiritually he calls
[59:57] man to go after things that would quench
[1:00:00] that longing or that thirsting for just
[1:00:03] a moment and cause him to lose his
[1:00:05] recognition or need for the things of
[1:00:08] God
[1:00:09] he quit thirsting for the things of God
[1:00:11] because there were so many options in
[1:00:13] the world
[1:00:14] he quit thirsting and logging I mean
[1:00:16] think about it how many people in the
[1:00:18] world today are walking around like
[1:00:20] David saying I'm so thirsty for God I
[1:00:23] must have God or else I'm going to
[1:00:25] perish
[1:00:28] why not because of the options they
[1:00:31] satisfied with drink or they satisfy it
[1:00:33] with pills are they satisfied with
[1:00:35] pleasures and they satisfy it with
[1:00:36] entertainment
[1:00:38] all the while what they're doing is
[1:00:39] they're covering up that Godly thirst
[1:00:43] they satisfy it with the lust of the
[1:00:45] flesh
[1:00:46] think about it
[1:00:48] they chase after one from one woman to
[1:00:51] the next
[1:00:52] or they chase from one man to the next
[1:00:55] whatever the case may be and in today's
[1:00:57] world
[1:01:02] they chase after all kind of things to
[1:01:04] cover up the desire that was put on the
[1:01:07] inside of them to thirst after God
[1:01:11] why does The Sinner sin
[1:01:14] why must they live the way that they
[1:01:17] live
[1:01:18] it's because they're
[1:01:21] it's because they're thirsty
[1:01:24] it's because they want something to come
[1:01:26] on the inside that'll satisfy that
[1:01:28] thirst
[1:01:29] that'll give them peace that passes all
[1:01:31] understanding why do they have to take
[1:01:34] this pill and that pill I'm not saying
[1:01:35] they don't have real problems when I'm
[1:01:37] asking you why don't they turn to The
[1:01:38] Well of Living Water
[1:01:40] why from this pill to that pill because
[1:01:42] they just want peace they just want
[1:01:44] their anxiety to go away they just want
[1:01:46] their depression to go away they're
[1:01:48] looking for a piece that'll never be
[1:01:50] found only in Jesus Christ that's where
[1:01:53] the peace is that's where Victory is
[1:01:55] that's where overcoming is but we got to
[1:01:57] get them to the well we got to get them
[1:01:59] to the water so we've got to live a life
[1:02:02] that makes them thirsty thirsty for God
[1:02:05] thirsty for for True Living Water
[1:02:12] it's because they're thirsty
[1:02:14] and so they're trying to satisfy that
[1:02:16] thirst trying to quench that longing
[1:02:18] that's deep down on the inside
[1:02:20] but you're never going to be able to
[1:02:22] quench a Godly thirst with stagnated
[1:02:24] Waters of the devil
[1:02:27] listen you don't need another cigarette
[1:02:29] tonight
[1:02:30] that's not going to bring you peace you
[1:02:32] don't need another drink tonight you
[1:02:34] don't need another pill you don't need
[1:02:35] another party you don't have to go back
[1:02:38] to that pornography addiction
[1:02:41] those things aren't bringing you peace
[1:02:43] I'm telling you tonight there is a
[1:02:45] fountain open in the House of David to
[1:02:48] all who will receive he says come and
[1:02:51] drink of the Waters of Life freely
[1:02:53] whoever is thirsty tonight come and
[1:02:56] drink
[1:02:57] that's where you're going to find real
[1:02:59] peace
[1:03:00] there are rivers of Life flowing tonight
[1:03:03] right here in this building
[1:03:06] how can you say that because The Thirst
[1:03:08] quencher himself is here in this
[1:03:10] building tonight
[1:03:12] and he says to all that are thirsty come
[1:03:16] listen
[1:03:17] you who may be struggling
[1:03:20] looking here and looking there and
[1:03:22] wondering where am I going to find peace
[1:03:23] where am I going to find my joy he is
[1:03:26] the only one that can quench your thirst
[1:03:29] he is the one that your heart truly
[1:03:32] desires he is the one that your soul is
[1:03:35] longing for listen I thank God for the
[1:03:37] desire for for that hunger on that on
[1:03:39] the inside of a man's heart that makes
[1:03:40] him to thirst
[1:03:42] and I thank God that he took mine that
[1:03:44] was heading in the wrong direction and
[1:03:46] he turned that thirst and he turned that
[1:03:48] hunger and he toured it towards the
[1:03:50] things of God oh listen let me tell you
[1:03:52] from experience there's no high that'll
[1:03:54] match this High there's no party that'll
[1:03:57] match what happens in this place there
[1:03:58] is nothing that the world can offer you
[1:04:00] that can match the pleasures of being in
[1:04:03] the presence of almighty God that
[1:04:05] matches the peace and the joy oh
[1:04:08] Hallelujah of having a true relationship
[1:04:11] with the Lord God Almighty there is
[1:04:14] nothing out there that matches it
[1:04:17] and you'll never find peace as long as
[1:04:19] that's where you're looking for your
[1:04:21] peace
[1:04:22] there is no joy like this Joy
[1:04:27] you can try everything you want

[1:05:07] heart become so thirsty that you must
[1:05:10] find Christ or die
[1:05:14] church tonight we can't become satisfied
[1:05:16] with anything less or anything short
[1:05:19] than his life living in US

[1:05:26] we can't be satisfied where you are if
[1:05:28] you're Justified I thank God for it and
[1:05:30] brother Tim even talked about it Sunday

[1:05:35] rejoice in that knowing that there's
[1:05:36] more for you and if you've made it to
[1:05:39] sanctification we rejoice in that and we
[1:05:41] celebrate that but celebrate that
[1:05:43] knowing that you must keep going to a
[1:05:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost you must
[1:05:47] progress and take another step don't be
[1:05:50] satisfied at just being forgiven don't
[1:05:53] be satisfied at just being uh Sanctified

[1:06:07] congratulations you've made it as far as
[1:06:10] the devil
[1:06:16] if that is what you have to stand on
[1:06:18] then you and Satan are standing in the
[1:06:20] same place
[1:06:23] you say that's pretty hard well
[1:06:24] according to the word James 2 19 says
[1:06:27] Thou believest that there is one God
[1:06:29] thou do as well the Devils also believe
[1:06:33] and tremble
[1:06:39] that's how far you've made it
[1:06:41] that's how far you've come I would
[1:06:44] recommend that we don't stop there
[1:06:47] I would recommend that we believe and go
[1:06:49] further and when we take that Milestone
[1:06:50] we go further and we take that Milestone
[1:06:52] we go further Enoch walked with God
[1:06:55] there is no place in this journey in
[1:06:57] this battle in this struggle to stop and
[1:06:59] relax you must be progressing from this
[1:07:02] well I need to get to that well I need
[1:07:04] more water I need more strength I need
[1:07:07] more life I need more peace I need more
[1:07:09] joy how do I get it drink tonight drink
[1:07:13] from the world get to the well that's
[1:07:15] gushing forth with life-giving water
[1:07:19] Hallelujah
[1:07:21] don't stay on the same plane as the
[1:07:23] devil is but let me bring the good news
[1:07:25] you have something that the devil don't
[1:07:28] have
[1:07:29] you've got something that he don't got
[1:07:31] and that is a thirst on the inside of
[1:07:33] you to be filled with the Lord Jesus to
[1:07:36] be filled with the spirit the devil
[1:07:38] don't have that you also have more than
[1:07:40] a thirst you have the ability to be
[1:07:42] filled with the baptism of Hallelujah of
[1:07:45] the Holy Ghost the Devil comes and he
[1:07:47] says well this well this well this and I
[1:07:49] say I've got something you don't have
[1:07:52] I've got the ability to be saved I've
[1:07:55] got the ability to be raptured
[1:07:56] Hallelujah
[1:07:58] you don't don't let that be quenched
[1:08:01] don't let that thirst be quenched with
[1:08:04] church Hannity
[1:08:07] don't let him cheapen that because you
[1:08:09] sit on a pew
[1:08:12] go further than that
[1:08:15] go beyond that
[1:08:17] don't let that thirst be quenched the
[1:08:20] thing that separates you from the Devil
[1:08:22] don't let it be quenched by joining a
[1:08:25] church and having religion
[1:08:28] all that does is cheapen The Thirst
[1:08:32] too many of us don't have that peace and
[1:08:34] that joy and that freedom
[1:08:36] because that River ain't on the inside
[1:08:40] come on now
[1:08:41] we've quenched it
[1:08:43] we've quenched the desire and the thirst
[1:08:45] for a living God to be dwelling down on
[1:08:48] the inside of us by simply being a
[1:08:49] church member
[1:08:51] by simply to say oh we believe the
[1:08:53] message
[1:08:55] listen I don't care where you go to
[1:08:56] church
[1:08:57] I don't care if it's First Baptist
[1:09:00] menden
[1:09:01] or evening like Tabernacle you better go
[1:09:03] beyond a church experience
[1:09:07] you better take it to the upper room
[1:09:10] because going to church here ain't going
[1:09:11] to save you going to church anywhere
[1:09:14] ain't going to save you you got to drink
[1:09:15] from The Well of Living Waters that's
[1:09:18] the only thing that's going to save you
[1:09:19] it's got to be more than a church
[1:09:22] relationship
[1:09:23] brother Brown says the devil has another
[1:09:25] way
[1:09:26] that he makes you to quench that thirst
[1:09:28] because after all it's a religious
[1:09:32] thirst
[1:09:34] it's a thirst after God then the devil
[1:09:37] tells you just go join the church that's
[1:09:40] all you have to do now listen to this
[1:09:43] listen this because this struck me
[1:09:46] he says that's almost as much hypocrisy
[1:09:50] or worse
[1:09:52] than going into the bar room to quench
[1:09:55] that thirst
[1:10:00] going to church to quench that thirst
[1:10:04] is just as much hypocrisy as going to
[1:10:07] the bar room to quench that thirst he
[1:10:09] says he finishes the quote and says
[1:10:12] except a man be born again
[1:10:17] church we must be born again
[1:10:19] we must be born again you want to go in
[1:10:21] the Rapture you must be born again you
[1:10:24] must have that token listen I'm gonna
[1:10:25] tell you something he don't care how
[1:10:27] much you shouted he don't care how much
[1:10:29] you danced in the spirit he don't care
[1:10:31] how much you've run around this church
[1:10:32] he don't care how many times you spoke
[1:10:34] in tongues he don't care about that if
[1:10:36] there's no life on the inside of you
[1:10:38] bubbling out forth manifesting that
[1:10:40] Jesus Christ is on the inside you're no
[1:10:43] better off than the denominations if
[1:10:45] that life's not on the inside of you
[1:10:47] you're not going in a rapture
[1:10:56] I'm thankful when the spirit Falls I'm
[1:10:57] thankful when you run I'm thankful when
[1:10:59] you shout I'm thankful when the gifts
[1:11:01] are manifested I'm so thankful for those
[1:11:02] things but at the end of the day is that
[1:11:05] life on the inside of you
[1:11:07] is it bubbling up is it living is it
[1:11:09] overflowing is it there
[1:11:13] I'm not sure if it's there
[1:11:15] it's probably not
[1:11:19] when you put something on the inside of
[1:11:21] you that's bubbling up and bubbling up
[1:11:22] and bubbling up you know it's there
[1:11:26] you know it's there
[1:11:30] he wants to keep you away from the water
[1:11:33] he'll let you jump he'll let you come to
[1:11:35] church he'll let you run around he'll
[1:11:36] let you shout or he'll let you sit there
[1:11:38] and not do any of those things let's not
[1:11:39] act like that's any better
[1:11:43] he'll let you sit there like a bump on a
[1:11:45] pickle and go straight to hell
[1:11:51] it's about that life
[1:11:54] it's about that life
[1:11:55] he wants to keep you from your own Upper
[1:11:57] Room
[1:11:58] listen that's what separated Judas
[1:12:01] when you get right down to it Judas
[1:12:03] performed all the Miracles too
[1:12:05] Judas had such a Ministry that when it
[1:12:07] when Jesus said that somebody was going
[1:12:09] to betray him none of them said it's
[1:12:11] Judas
[1:12:14] now as a matter of fact they were all
[1:12:16] willing to point their finger at
[1:12:17] themselves before they would accuse
[1:12:19] Judas well if somebody's going to betray
[1:12:22] him it's probably me
[1:12:24] no no it's gonna be me
[1:12:26] hey
[1:12:27] this is a contest
[1:12:30] the one guy
[1:12:33] why why didn't they accuse him
[1:12:36] the Miracles were there there was a
[1:12:38] Ministry there
[1:12:40] but he couldn't go to that Upper Room
[1:12:43] he couldn't go receive the baptism of
[1:12:45] the Holy Ghost brother Branham said
[1:12:47] that's where he showed his true colors
[1:12:49] it's about that life what are you saying
[1:12:53] I'm saying don't stop short of that
[1:12:54] tonight don't stop short get to the
[1:12:57] Fountain get to the well and once you've
[1:12:59] had that experience of the new birth and
[1:13:01] you drink from that Fountain and then
[1:13:02] deity comes and dwells on the inside of
[1:13:05] you and now the thirst quencher abides
[1:13:07] with you and goes with you and The
[1:13:10] Thirst quencher overcomes through you
[1:13:13] listen to this this scripture
[1:13:15] John 7 37
[1:13:19] so many times
[1:13:21] we don't go far enough and we think that
[1:13:23] River of Life Is there just by believing
[1:13:26] no it only comes with the new birth
[1:13:28] this it says in the last day that great
[1:13:31] day of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[1:13:33] saying if any man thirsts let him come
[1:13:36] unto me and drink that's the invitation
[1:13:39] tonight if there's a theme for tonight's
[1:13:41] service that's it right there if you're
[1:13:43] thirsty tonight Jesus says come and
[1:13:46] drink next verse
[1:13:48] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:13:52] has saith out of his belly shall flow
[1:13:55] rivers of Living Water Well brother
[1:13:58] Aaron it says right there all you got to
[1:13:59] do is believe on him there's nothing
[1:14:01] mentioned about the upper room there's
[1:14:03] nothing mentioned about the baptism of
[1:14:05] the Holy Ghost it just says believe on
[1:14:07] him and you shall have Rivers of Life
[1:14:10] flowing out of your belly that's why we
[1:14:12] read the next verse
[1:14:15] but this he spake of the spirit which
[1:14:18] they that believe on him should receive
[1:14:22] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:14:25] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[1:14:27] it's right there you want Rivers of Life
[1:14:29] coming out of your life you've got to
[1:14:31] receive the spirit you've got to receive
[1:14:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got
[1:14:36] to go to the upper room for yourself you
[1:14:38] got to be filled
[1:14:40] and then once you're so filled that it
[1:14:43] can't contain any more then Rivers of
[1:14:45] Life Will gush forth out of your life
[1:14:49] but there must be an upper room
[1:14:51] experience
[1:14:53] if you'll lay aside your other thirst
[1:14:55] quenchers tonight oh come on
[1:14:58] oh we all got them
[1:15:00] we all got those things we do that takes
[1:15:02] up time and does this to satisfy this
[1:15:04] and does this when we could be given
[1:15:06] more time to The Thirst quencher if
[1:15:08] we'll lay aside those things tonight lay
[1:15:11] aside our self-righteousness lay aside
[1:15:13] everything that has hindered us from
[1:15:15] having a full real true experience
[1:15:18] kept us from having a new birth if we're
[1:15:21] willing to lay those things aside the
[1:15:23] night and begin to drink from the rock
[1:15:24] oh come on he is that rock in a weary
[1:15:27] land if we'll begin to drink from That
[1:15:29] Rock tonight there will be an Artesian
[1:15:31] well that begins to flow on the inside
[1:15:33] of you it bubbles up it gushes forth it
[1:15:36] turns over you can't hardly stand still
[1:15:38] you can't hardly sit there you got to
[1:15:40] tell somebody you got a witness to
[1:15:42] somebody your Life's Been Changed you're
[1:15:44] a new creation you're a new person
[1:15:46] Hallelujah when you get it on the inside
[1:15:48] of you
[1:15:50] but you can't stop short
[1:15:53] you can't stop short
[1:15:55] at that point
[1:15:57] oh there's life in it it's not some old
[1:16:00] dead Creed
[1:16:01] it's not some dried up Church Hannity
[1:16:03] it's not a list of do's and don'ts
[1:16:08] listen list of do's and don'ts and and
[1:16:11] legalism and things like that has never
[1:16:13] produced overcoming lives
[1:16:16] It produced cycles of failure and ups
[1:16:19] and downs and people getting
[1:16:20] disillusioned and people falling away
[1:16:22] that's all it ever produces
[1:16:24] but if you want to get people living
[1:16:25] Victorious you want to get people that
[1:16:28] came back and overcome that can stand in
[1:16:29] this evil age that'll be there when the
[1:16:31] church doors open that'll show the
[1:16:33] fruits of the spirit that'll show
[1:16:34] brotherly kindness that'll love one
[1:16:36] another that'll be real true Christians
[1:16:38] quit trying to get them to church and
[1:16:40] get them to the upper room quit trying
[1:16:42] to get them to church and get them to
[1:16:44] Jesus Christ oh I understand I know we
[1:16:46] want them to come to church absolutely
[1:16:48] come I want you here but just getting
[1:16:50] you here won't save you
[1:16:53] you got a drink tonight
[1:16:55] and you have an opportunity tonight to
[1:16:58] drink
[1:16:59] because it's Living Water
[1:17:00] it's still flowing
[1:17:06] living Souls can never take their rest
[1:17:10] anywhere short of a living God
[1:17:13] they can never settle down for anything
[1:17:15] less than that
[1:17:16] one way you can tell if somebody has
[1:17:18] ever experienced it
[1:17:21] how do you know brother Aaron well
[1:17:22] there's no way for me to really know
[1:17:23] what what you have or don't have
[1:17:26] that's up for you to know but one way
[1:17:28] you get a pretty good idea
[1:17:30] is once they've experienced it they can
[1:17:33] never get enough of it
[1:17:36] once they've had a drink they want
[1:17:37] another drink
[1:17:39] once they get a little bit of that life
[1:17:40] flowing on the inside of them listen the
[1:17:43] the devil's addictions are just
[1:17:45] perversions
[1:17:47] you were meant to be addicted you were
[1:17:49] meant to be addicted to life you were
[1:17:52] meant to be addicted to where I gotta
[1:17:53] have more of Jesus I can't go today I
[1:17:55] need some more give me some more I want
[1:17:58] some more oh what an incredible setup
[1:18:00] that is girl you can't get enough of him
[1:18:02] and he never leaves your side it's the
[1:18:04] perfect setup I need some Jesus there he
[1:18:06] is I need some Jesus here he is I need
[1:18:09] another touch tonight he's here tonight
[1:18:11] the more you need him the more he's
[1:18:14] there and he never fails you he's here
[1:18:16] tonight to give you another drink if you
[1:18:19] desire that drink
[1:18:28] that doesn't mean we're going to preach
[1:18:29] long
[1:18:31] it just means I was getting pretty warm
[1:18:34] once you get the Holy Ghost
[1:18:37] at Life Giving water on the inside the
[1:18:40] more you want it all the time
[1:18:43] and he's right there all the time to
[1:18:45] give it to you listen some of you need
[1:18:47] to take another drink tonight
[1:18:49] I'll throw myself in there I need to
[1:18:51] take another drink but some of you
[1:18:52] really need to take another drink
[1:18:53] tonight
[1:18:55] some of you have been sober way too long
[1:19:01] some of it's been too long since you
[1:19:03] took a drink and you're a little bit
[1:19:04] sober and you say well I'm feeling a
[1:19:06] little bit dried out I don't know what
[1:19:08] all the excitement's about we'll get you
[1:19:10] a few drinks in you and you'll figure it
[1:19:11] out real quick you'll figure out what
[1:19:13] makes us so happy you'll figure out what
[1:19:15] makes us so exciting you'll figure out
[1:19:18] how you well I don't know if I'm gonna
[1:19:19] figure it out I'm not sure about all
[1:19:21] that jump in and shouting listen I done
[1:19:23] told you that ain't where it's all at
[1:19:24] but get a few drinks in you of the
[1:19:25] Living Water and you won't sit still

[1:19:33] inside of it get you moving get them oh
[1:19:35] oh come on y'all think about that one
[1:19:37] that got thrown on the on the bones of
[1:19:39] Elijah that time
[1:19:40] he'd been dead for a minute that's
[1:19:42] that's right there's some here there's a
[1:19:44] few dead ones but if we could ever get
[1:19:46] you to come in contact with that line it
[1:19:48] didn't even get down on the inside of
[1:19:50] him it just came in contact with it and
[1:19:53] then all of a sudden all the other
[1:19:54] Fanatics was running having a good time
[1:19:56] and he went Blowing by them whoa
[1:19:59] can you imagine what got into him oh
[1:20:02] some life got into him he was dead for
[1:20:04] years he sat there for years but one day
[1:20:07] he came in contact with some Living
[1:20:10] Water he couldn't stay in the Tomb no
[1:20:13] more he couldn't stay dead no more he
[1:20:16] was alive that's what it'll do to you
[1:20:19] tonight it'll bring life and when
[1:20:21] there's life there's fight and when
[1:20:22] there's fight there's overcoming and
[1:20:24] there's no quit on the inside of you
[1:20:27] so you got to get that water down on the
[1:20:29] inside
[1:20:33] brother Brown says I tell you what's the
[1:20:34] matter with the Christian tonight
[1:20:36] you're not drawing dividends
[1:20:39] on your baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:42] he says draw in
[1:20:45] and drink
[1:20:47] and drink and drink and drink till you
[1:20:52] push out salvation push out Divine
[1:20:55] Healing push out the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:57] Ghost just drink and drink and drink
[1:21:00] you're planted by the inexhaustible
[1:21:02] Fountain of Life which is Jesus Christ
[1:21:04] he's that there he's that thirsty let
[1:21:07] him drink him that heareth say come
[1:21:09] whosoever will let him come and drink
[1:21:12] from The Fountains of the Water of Life
[1:21:15] freely
[1:21:17] oh my
[1:21:20] oh my
[1:21:21] it's 8 15. we'll have to speed up so
[1:21:24] y'all bear with me or y'all buckle up
[1:21:26] and ride with me here we go
[1:21:29] so Satan understands the importance of
[1:21:31] water
[1:21:32] how much you need and he knows that
[1:21:34] there's no life without it he knows you
[1:21:36] can't bear fruits without it and so
[1:21:38] there's a constant battle for it
[1:21:40] even though the water's there and the
[1:21:42] supply is constant and the supply is
[1:21:44] ever present he will try to get you to
[1:21:47] look elsewhere
[1:21:49] the water's right there but he'll try to
[1:21:51] get you to look elsewhere he'll point to
[1:21:53] your hardships he'll point to your
[1:21:56] valleys and your hurts as a reason that
[1:21:59] you should move on
[1:22:01] try something else
[1:22:03] he's going to he'll bring a trial in
[1:22:05] your life and say see this land is no
[1:22:07] good this isn't for you you're being
[1:22:10] tried here but God has returned us to
[1:22:13] the land of the word and I'm telling you
[1:22:14] there's plenty of water here
[1:22:16] no matter how bad the trials get no
[1:22:18] matter how bad the Temptations Get You
[1:22:20] just stay put don't move out of this
[1:22:22] place that he's put you in notice here
[1:22:23] as he speaks to Isaac in Genesis 26 and
[1:22:26] 1. he says and there was a famine in the
[1:22:29] land beside the first famine that was in
[1:22:31] the days of Abraham and Isaac went unto
[1:22:33] abimelech King of the Philistines unto
[1:22:35] gurora and the Lord appeared unto him
[1:22:37] and said go not down into Egypt
[1:22:40] dwell in the land which I shall tell
[1:22:42] thee of
[1:22:43] sojourn in this land and I will be with
[1:22:47] thee and will bless thee For unto thee
[1:22:49] and unto thy seed I will give all these
[1:22:51] countries and I will perform the oath
[1:22:53] which I swear unto Abraham thy father
[1:22:58] and the enemy's going to come in he's
[1:23:00] going to do all he can do to get you to
[1:23:01] move out of the land even though the
[1:23:03] Lord said stay here
[1:23:04] don't go down to Egypt
[1:23:06] but too many times we get to looking
[1:23:08] around looking for our blessing when's
[1:23:10] it coming it's coming all of a sudden
[1:23:14] it's coming suddenly we've been hearing
[1:23:16] that
[1:23:16] it'll happen in just a moment you just
[1:23:18] stay put where God told you to be
[1:23:21] he said stay in this land and don't move
[1:23:23] you go where God said go
[1:23:27] when it doesn't make sense go
[1:23:31] and When God says stay you better not go
[1:23:33] if he says stay you better stay no
[1:23:36] matter how hard the things are how bad
[1:23:38] the famine is you stay where God said
[1:23:40] and you watch the blessings flow you
[1:23:43] watch his hand in your life look at
[1:23:45] verse 12. then Isaac sowed in that land
[1:23:48] and received in the same year a
[1:23:50] hundredfold
[1:23:51] and the Lord blessed him and the man
[1:23:54] whacks great and went forward and grew
[1:23:57] until he became very great for he had
[1:23:59] possessions of flocks and possessions of
[1:24:01] herds and great store of servants and
[1:24:03] the Philistines envied him
[1:24:06] for all the wells which his father's
[1:24:08] servants had digged in the days of
[1:24:10] Abraham his father the Philistines had
[1:24:13] stopped them and filled them with Earth
[1:24:17] now notice they recognize the importance
[1:24:19] of water
[1:24:20] if he don't have water he can't stay in
[1:24:22] this land
[1:24:25] sometimes that water gets to flowing too
[1:24:27] good
[1:24:28] things get to going too good in your
[1:24:30] life blessings begin to pile up some
[1:24:32] people are going man I wish I had that
[1:24:33] problem
[1:24:35] but blessings begin to pile up you're
[1:24:38] healthy marriage is good spiritually
[1:24:40] you're doing good and the enemy is going
[1:24:42] to come along and go no it's time to
[1:24:43] stop up some whales
[1:24:45] it's time to strive with them for the
[1:24:48] water and he comes and he tries to bring
[1:24:50] distractions and obstacles and trials
[1:24:52] and hurts and offenses to try to keep
[1:24:54] you from drinking why he knows that the
[1:24:57] well is where your Victory is
[1:24:59] he know that the well is where your
[1:25:01] blessing is it's where life is and he
[1:25:03] recognizes it's a daily bubbling up in a
[1:25:05] drinking of this life-giving water that
[1:25:07] you have to partake in
[1:25:09] so if you're not listening you may be a
[1:25:11] wonderful Christian on your way to
[1:25:13] heaven but if he can keep you from
[1:25:15] drinking the way you're supposed to he
[1:25:16] can keep you from fully manifesting all
[1:25:18] that you're supposed to manifest keep
[1:25:21] you from reaching the full potentials
[1:25:22] that Jesus expected you to reach he may
[1:25:26] not bring you to a lost condition but he
[1:25:27] can keep you struggling through things
[1:25:29] that you might not would have had to
[1:25:30] struggle through if you'd have just
[1:25:31] stayed in the water just kept drinking
[1:25:34] from the water
[1:25:35] so he tries to make you dried up in a
[1:25:37] lifeless Christian
[1:25:38] brother Brown says all the things in
[1:25:40] Arizona are trees is full of stickers
[1:25:43] everything has a sticker it's because
[1:25:44] it's dry
[1:25:45] now if that same Bush growed over here
[1:25:48] it'd be a nice lovely leaf see it's
[1:25:50] without water that's the reason it
[1:25:52] becomes a sticker
[1:25:54] he says and when the church becomes
[1:25:56] without the water of life it gets dry
[1:25:58] and sticky two sticking and punching at
[1:26:02] everything
[1:26:03] but where the Water of Life flows it
[1:26:06] opens up the leaf and makes it tender
[1:26:08] mellow sweet and holy and acceptable
[1:26:11] unto God so may the Lord God water us
[1:26:14] tonight that we won't be stickers but
[1:26:18] we'll be fine leaves at the Wayward
[1:26:20] people might sit down under the tree
[1:26:22] under the shade of our tree and find
[1:26:24] rest for their souls
[1:26:27] look I don't want to become a sticker
[1:26:29] I don't want the people of evening like
[1:26:31] Tabernacle to become stickers we're
[1:26:32] always poking and we're prodding and
[1:26:35] we're cranky
[1:26:36] and where I got a crowded Spirit about
[1:26:38] us we want to be full of life to our
[1:26:41] people can come here and feel welcome
[1:26:42] where they can come and relax where they
[1:26:44] can come and rest under the shade of our
[1:26:46] trees because there's life on the inside
[1:26:48] of us
[1:26:50] watch
[1:26:52] Genesis 26 18 moving quickly Isaac had
[1:26:54] to have that water
[1:26:56] so Isaac digged again the wells of water
[1:26:58] which they had digged in the days of
[1:27:00] Abraham his father for the Philistines
[1:27:03] had stopped them after the death of
[1:27:04] Abraham and he called their names after
[1:27:06] the names by which his father had called
[1:27:08] them and Isaac's servants digged in the
[1:27:11] valley and found there a well of
[1:27:15] springing water
[1:27:18] come on somebody
[1:27:20] they digged in the valley brother Aaron
[1:27:23] you don't understand I'm in the valley
[1:27:25] right now I'm in the midst of a hardship
[1:27:27] I'm in the midst of a great trial I
[1:27:29] don't know how I'm going to come out of
[1:27:30] this there's water in your Valley they
[1:27:33] found water in the valley if you'll just
[1:27:34] start digging where you're at today
[1:27:36] don't waste the waiting don't waste the
[1:27:39] waiting but while you're waiting on the
[1:27:40] Lord begin to dig begin to dig and
[1:27:43] suddenly all of a sudden you're going to
[1:27:45] strike water there'll be life-giving
[1:27:47] water there oh it's a trial but I've got
[1:27:49] water it's a valley but I've got water
[1:27:52] it's a hardship but I've got water
[1:27:55] there's water in the valley tonight
[1:27:59] dig
[1:28:03] Isaiah 41 18. some of you may be in the
[1:28:06] hardest times of your life listen to
[1:28:08] this and I will open rivers in the high
[1:28:10] places and fountains in the midst of The
[1:28:13] Valleys I will make the Wilderness a
[1:28:15] pool of water in the dry land Springs of
[1:28:17] water Isaiah 43 19 behold I will do a
[1:28:22] new thing now it shall spring forth
[1:28:24] shall you not know it I will even make a
[1:28:27] way in the wilderness and rivers in the
[1:28:30] desert
[1:28:31] he's going to supply the water
[1:28:34] sometimes you may have to dig for it
[1:28:36] sometimes you may have to fight for it
[1:28:37] sometimes they may strive with you over
[1:28:39] the well but he's going to supply the
[1:28:41] water
[1:28:42] amen
[1:28:45] Genesis 26 and 20.
[1:28:49] and the Herdman of Gerard did strive
[1:28:52] with Isaac's Herdman saying the water is
[1:28:55] ours
[1:28:56] and he called the name of the place esec
[1:28:59] because they strove with him and they
[1:29:01] digged another well and strove for that
[1:29:04] also and he called the name of it sitna
[1:29:08] what does strove mean
[1:29:10] it means to struggle
[1:29:13] or fight vigorously
[1:29:18] sometimes you're gonna have to fight for
[1:29:20] it
[1:29:23] but I thought it's open and it's free oh
[1:29:25] it is
[1:29:26] but the Devil comes and he knocks life
[1:29:28] off course
[1:29:29] Devil comes and he stirs up the home
[1:29:32] Devil comes and makes it hard for you to
[1:29:34] focus in the church service
[1:29:36] it's a daily fight fight to stay in the
[1:29:38] right frame of mind
[1:29:40] fight to create the right atmosphere
[1:29:42] fight to give everything you have when
[1:29:44] you come to church he fights to keep you
[1:29:46] cold and formal and you gotta fight to
[1:29:48] break through into the spirit he's
[1:29:50] constantly striving with you for the
[1:29:52] water it's my water oh I know but I'm
[1:29:54] gonna make you earn it I'm gonna make
[1:29:55] you fight for the Lord says here you go
[1:29:57] and the devil says no that's my water no
[1:29:59] sir we have a right to it but you got to
[1:30:01] be willing to stand and fight he fights
[1:30:04] to keep you backslid
[1:30:06] he fights to keep you in a position
[1:30:08] sitting there when the Lord's calling
[1:30:10] out to you tonight saying come to the
[1:30:12] water come to the water and he's telling
[1:30:14] you now you're okay you're okay you got
[1:30:15] to fight through that tonight you gotta
[1:30:17] push past that tonight
[1:30:19] because he's fighting to keep you from
[1:30:21] the water
[1:30:22] and he strives with you
[1:30:26] we're going to start trying to bring
[1:30:27] this down
[1:30:29] your life may have gone down past that
[1:30:31] you never thought it would
[1:30:33] you may be facing things that you never
[1:30:35] thought you would face
[1:30:38] and tonight the enemy may have got you
[1:30:39] in a place where you think can I ever
[1:30:42] taste that water
[1:30:45] David was in that place one time
[1:30:49] will I ever get the opportunity to taste
[1:30:52] of that water again
[1:30:54] can I ever get to Jesus again I've had
[1:30:56] opportunities in the past
[1:30:58] I've had opportunities and maybe I
[1:31:00] passed them by but I need him tonight
[1:31:02] will I ever have that opportunity to get
[1:31:04] to Jesus
[1:31:05] will I ever get a refreshing
[1:31:08] I feel like he's so far away
[1:31:11] just bear with me remember on the
[1:31:14] Wilderness Journey
[1:31:16] there was a rock that followed them
[1:31:20] The Rock followed them and Moses smoked
[1:31:22] the Rock and the waters gushed forth out
[1:31:24] of it Living Waters how much brother
[1:31:26] Aaron enough that two million people
[1:31:28] could drink out of it and all their ox
[1:31:30] and all their animals and everything
[1:31:31] they had this was a gusher
[1:31:34] that's what wash your sins away
[1:31:38] and this rock followed them with
[1:31:40] life-giving Waters and it was a type of
[1:31:43] the rock Christ Jesus
[1:31:45] being smitten at Calvary in the release
[1:31:48] of life-giving waters that would come
[1:31:50] forth out of him
[1:31:51] so in your situation and in your
[1:31:53] hardship and in your trial tonight and

[1:36:45] I'll even say the altar don't be ashamed
[1:36:47] to come to the altar
[1:36:49] I think that's so silly that we get this
[1:36:51] idea in our head that the altar is is
[1:36:53] only a place where Sinners go the altar
[1:36:55] is a place of worship
[1:36:59] should feel free to come to the altar
[1:37:00] anytime if that's what you need to do to
[1:37:02] get a refilling or to talk it over with
[1:37:04] the Lord don't be a a shame to come well
[1:37:06] what do they thinking brother Aaron I've
[1:37:08] got saved 20 years ago and here I am at
[1:37:10] the altar
[1:37:11] I drank water yesterday and I'm gonna
[1:37:13] drink more today does that make me crazy
[1:37:15] does that make me backslidden no I want
[1:37:18] more of what I got last time I was there
[1:37:20] last time I was up there it's real good
[1:37:22] he poured it out on me I want some more
[1:37:24] of that I want another drink of that
[1:37:26] pour it out on me again Lord I want more
[1:37:29] I'm here again saying Lord I'm thirsty
[1:37:31] my soul alone for you my heart longed
[1:37:34] for you I want a drink of Living Water
[1:37:36] tonight pour it out in my soul lord
[1:37:46] brother and this ain't what I was
[1:37:47] expecting tonight
[1:37:49] me neither
[1:37:53] but sometimes
[1:37:55] it's at the most unexpected times that
[1:37:57] we meet Jesus
[1:38:01] you know the woman at the well had tried
[1:38:03] everything to quench that thirst
[1:38:05] we all know her story
[1:38:08] why did she live the way she lived
[1:38:10] she was thirsty
[1:38:13] she was so thirsty we can read her story
[1:38:16] and tell her heart was good
[1:38:18] she wanted to be right
[1:38:21] she was probably even maybe raised in
[1:38:23] church she knew a little bit about the
[1:38:25] teachings and where they were going to
[1:38:27] worship and she knew these things she
[1:38:29] wanted to be right
[1:38:30] she was thirsty
[1:38:32] she'd been married five times
[1:38:36] the man she was living with wasn't her
[1:38:38] husband
[1:38:40] but on this day
[1:38:42] She was drawn to the well
[1:38:45] for an unexpected encounter
[1:38:49] it wasn't her intentions to meet Jesus
[1:38:51] that day
[1:38:54] had the Devils that had been trying to
[1:38:56] destroy her her whole life had any idea
[1:38:59] who was sitting on that whale waiting on
[1:39:00] them
[1:39:02] I promise you they went to a different
[1:39:05] will
[1:39:06] they would have tried everything within
[1:39:08] them to stop me or maybe they did
[1:39:10] maybe it was the worst month of her life
[1:39:13] maybe it was the worst week of her life
[1:39:17] maybe I'm talking to you
[1:39:21] maybe it's been the worst week maybe
[1:39:22] your life's been turned upside down
[1:39:25] maybe you don't know where to turn maybe
[1:39:27] you're perplexed
[1:39:28] there's somebody waiting on you at the
[1:39:30] well
[1:39:33] just get to the well
[1:39:36] just push through and give him an
[1:39:38] opportunity to change everything in your
[1:39:40] life
[1:39:41] push through that that's trying to
[1:39:42] hinder you
[1:39:44] maybe they're trying the demons they're
[1:39:45] trying to hinder you the Devils of fear
[1:39:47] of Doubt of unbelief maybe the torment
[1:39:49] of your past
[1:39:51] is trying to keep you from getting to
[1:39:52] the well tonight
[1:39:54] I'll say Lord I just want another drink
[1:39:56] I'm not ashamed to go to the well
[1:39:59] I'm not ashamed to see for people to see
[1:40:01] me go to the well I just want another
[1:40:03] drink tonight
[1:40:05] but she managed to get to the well and
[1:40:07] even though it wasn't expected
[1:40:09] she heard these words John 4 14.
[1:40:13] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[1:40:16] I shall give him
[1:40:18] shall never thirst
[1:40:20] but the water that I shall give him
[1:40:22] shall be in him a well of water
[1:40:25] springing up into everlasting life
[1:40:29] oh that must have been wonderful it was
[1:40:32] but that's not what makes the story
[1:40:33] wonderful
[1:40:35] what makes it wonderful is her reply in
[1:40:37] the next verse she could have said oh
[1:40:39] whatever it's just a Wednesday night
[1:40:41] oh whatever I don't even know what
[1:40:43] you're talking about but she says sir
[1:40:47] give me this water
[1:40:50] I'm so thirsty she recognized that it
[1:40:53] was a thirst she recognized she had need
[1:40:56] of it she said sir
[1:40:58] give me this water
[1:41:01] oh that's my heart's cry tonight Lord
[1:41:03] I've had it before but give me a drink
[1:41:05] tonight
[1:41:06] Lord give me this water tonight Lord let
[1:41:09] it spring up on the inside of me tonight
[1:41:11] and she took the greatest drink of water
[1:41:14] that one could ever drink and he's
[1:41:16] offering it to you tonight and he's
[1:41:17] saying take this drink if you drink this
